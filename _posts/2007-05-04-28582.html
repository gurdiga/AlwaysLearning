<br/>
indymediaroom-i see your passionate,obviously the way your message was delivered though it needs some tweaking to avoid offense! everyone learns differently so if having a TV doesn&#39;t work for you awesome. i can respect that. <br/>
<br/>
i used to not have cable (almost 6 years) because there&#39;s alot that i could do without.  i did miss though that which i enjoy, but not enough to hook up the cable. then i noticed my kids at others houses enjoying so much on cable. so i hooked it up. i still don&#39;t watch much TV but my kids love it, silly cartoons and adventure programs!  like tonight we as a family watched preditor vs prey on discovery channel. i learned watching a grizzly devour a baby elk (calf) is so vicious that i couldn&#39;t watch that part! one of my sons thought it was &quot;cool&quot; (the cycle of life). i thought the host is amazing with wild animals, something i personally wouldn&#39;t do but hey its something HE&#39;s passionate about and wants to share it with the world.<br/>
<br/>
how & what do you and your kids do together to explore the things you all love?   <br/>

  &gt; Can someone learn from &quot;information&quot; that is innacurate?<br/>
<br/>
  Absolutely. There&#39;s lots of learning that&#39;s not about the &quot;facts&quot; <br/>
  that someone may be saying. I&#39;d say it&#39;s an essential part of <br/>
  becoming a critical thinker to be exposed to all kinds of information <br/>
  from all kinds of sources. When you&#39;re not there to filter things for <br/>
  your kids, how will they have learned how to do it for themselves?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Have you ever noticed that video games make good little soldiers<br/>
  &gt; who are desensitized to destroying life?<br/>
<br/>
  Have you ever noticed the many, many kids who play video games and <br/>
  are clearly not characterized by the above? My son would be one of <br/>
  them. If you don&#39;t know kids like that, I&#39;m sorry for you. Perhaps <br/>
  you need to spend more time reading about and/or being with actual <br/>
  unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; There is absolutely nothing on TV that is accurate<br/>
  &gt; or valuable.<br/>
<br/>
  I think you don&#39;t realize that you are insulting the many people on <br/>
  this list who have found lots of valuable things on television. Aside <br/>
  from the &quot;accuracy&quot; debate, what about just pure fun? What about <br/>
  entertainment? Since you don&#39;t have a tv, I don&#39;t think you can <br/>
  accurately describe what&#39;s on right now as worthless. I could make a <br/>
  compelling argument that we are currently in a golden age of <br/>
  television. Sure there&#39;s lots of crap, but there&#39;s lots of crappy <br/>
  books and music and art, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Your description of the results of television on people is untrue. <br/>
  Real people can be more complex and more intelligent than you seem to <br/>
  give us credit for.<br/>
<br/>
  Paula, whose life has been vastly enriched by television and who <br/>
  still manages to be a non-racist, feminist lover of the environment <br/>
  who votes.<br/>
