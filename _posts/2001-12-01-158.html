<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236453356">Here is a cool website. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ams.org/new-in-math/mathdigest/">http://www.ams.org/new-in-math/mathdigest/</a><br/>
<br/>
 When you get there, you&#39;ll see lists of articles from the general media that <br/>
are about math. If you click on one, you&#39;ll get a very brief synopsis - maybe <br/>
2 or 3 sentence description of the article. Most are pretty much English as <br/>
opposed to Math-ese. Then, if you want to read the actual article, you can <br/>
click on that and it takes you to it. I just had a look at one that started, <br/>
interestingly, with the following first paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ian Stewart was turned on to mathematics at the age of seven. A broken <br/>
collarbone freed him from an uninspiring teacher allowing his mother to <br/>
ignite his interest in numbers while he was laid up at home. &quot; <br/>
<br/>
The above is from the article about Magical Numbers in Nature.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - not all articles are really lay-person accessible (hey - maybe you <br/>
don&#39;t realize this, but not all math articles are intelligible to all <br/>
mathematicians -- I can read lots of statistics-related articles, but not <br/>
advanced articles in any other field of mathematics, for example, and, to be <br/>
honest, there are MANY statistics-related articles that are off in such <br/>
specialized areas that I can&#39;t make sense of them) but anyway - these are <br/>
articles that were written, usually, for the regular person, not for <br/>
mathematicians and they can be kind of inspiring and informative in giving <br/>
you a feeling for what math is REALLY all about.<br/>
