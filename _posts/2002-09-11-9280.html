&gt; &lt;&lt;  No one had told me it<br/>
&gt; was OK to just be myself and that being an introvert was OK!!  I enjoy<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; with people and having fun, but I reach my limit after a few hours and<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; to be alone.  In fact, I wrote, &quot;I really just like to be by myself to<br/>
&gt; read<br/>
&gt; and think my own thoughts.&quot;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is exactly why unschooling is so great!  Honoring the individual<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; themselves, exactly who they are and what they need today.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t care for the previous reply about what this teen<br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
&gt; Good to hear from an introvert on this topic.<br/>

I am this way also. I enjoy parties, large groups seeing old friends but<br/>
after a while, I&#39;m done! Need my space.<br/>

Happy in this, she is not so old<br/>
But she may learn.<br/>
