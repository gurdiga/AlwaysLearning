<div id="ygrps-yiv-726160828"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;*He&#39;s 17 and kind of caught in limbo between two<br/>
&gt;different states&#39; regulations since he splits his<br/>
&gt;time between here and his Dad&#39;s....so the easiest way<br/>
&gt;to get him out of that in both states was to graduate<br/>
<br/>
&gt;him.  In May school will be out for the summer, so it<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t be as much of an issue, but then there are 3<br/>
&gt;months during the school year before he turns 18 in<br/>
&gt;November. I really abhore compulsory attendance.  <br/>
&gt;Tuck<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have a bill up for vote here in WA right now,<br/>
decreasing the age when compulsory attendance begins<br/>
to 6yrs from 8 yrs.  The argument the lawmakers are<br/>
giving is that 20 states have a starting age of 6yrs,<br/>
and WA is only one of two states which has a starting<br/>
age of 8yrs.  They neglect to mention that the<br/>
compulsory graduation age in WA is 18, as opposed to<br/>
16 in many other states.  So they would effectively be<br/>
adding 2 more years to a child&#39;s compulsory scooling<br/>
years in WA, and that means 2 years more of testing<br/>
and assesments for homeschoolers.  What happened to<br/>
the other 28 states anyways?  They only mention 22 of<br/>
them in their arguments.<br/>

age and kindergarten mandatory.  It is 7 right now and<br/>
kindergarten is optional.  Some parents and<br/>
politicians want to make preschool mandatory, starting<br/>
with 3 year olds.  <br/>
