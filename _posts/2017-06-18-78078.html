<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101981865">The best thing to send a parent is a paper copy of Pam Laricchia’s “Free to Learn.”  <br/>
<br/>
Ask them to read it, and you could discuss it with them.<br/>
<br/>
If they start a conversation about school or math or any such thing, all you need to say is “Did you finish that book?”<br/>
If the answer is no, ask them to read the book.<br/>
If they answer were to have been yes, they probably wouldn’t have asked the question.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t send them “Free to Live,” because that’s the stuff that will flip parents out.  Go with the learning first.<br/>
<br/>
My Big Book of Unschooling isn’t good to give grandparents.  It’s really for parents who already do want to unschool, or already are and want to do it btter.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve never seen a better thing that that book of Pam’s.<br/>
<br/>
There’s also a book for grandparents of unschoolers that might be a good second book for them, after a while. <br/>

&nbsp;<br>
How do they know what level their &#39;basic&#39; skills are? My son doesn&#39;t&nbsp;handwrite, but my MIL doesn&#39;t know that...He didn&#39;t read until he was 9, but my Dad didn&#39;t know that - even after staying with them for 3 weeks. I covered for him...the grandparents don&#39;t
 know if he can or can&#39;t do multiplication or knows his times tables...those are situations we make sure we don&#39;t get in to.<br>
<br>
But - maybe it is too late for that with your parents? If so, get better, and more confident, in explaining your children&#39;s interests in schooly terms, so that your parents *aren&#39;t* worried.<br>
<br>
I would suggest stopping talking about unschooling at all, to the point where maybe (hopefully) they forget you ever mentioned such a crazy idea.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you really feel like you need to give them thing&nbsp;-&nbsp;give them mainstream resources - there is a good Ted Talk from a maths teacher that might help -<br>

I show them all the amazing things and they are impressed. But then my dad says, &quot;you need algebra. You need to be able to write,&quot; to me, and yes, he loves to make cards and posters so they have seen his writing. I feel like, if I could demonstrate that these things really do come in their good time, and that the deeper benefits of unschooling eclipse memorized multiplication tables, they would be amenable to that. </div></div><div><br></div><div>There was a time when I had the attitude that I would do whatever I do and they would have to deal with it.

The writing that’s there now is mine—quotes from five places, similar theme, about the problem with placing options where there used to only be “have to” and “no choice.”<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177384720">I bought 2 copies of Free to Learn by Pam  Laracchia and 2 copies of Dear Grandma: your Grandkids are Unschoolers by Shelia Baronaski and gave both sets of grandparents them as gifts. Pam Laracchia also interviews Shelia on one of her podcasts, that&#39;s how I found out about the book, which is a great episode to listen to. <br/>
<br/>
My mother in law was concerned about what we were doing, and didn&#39;t really quite understand it. She also, like most people, &quot;is made of school&quot; (Sandra&#39;s phrase that  I love!) and raised 10 children and put them all through the school system, so I think she never really knew what to ask about my children and often had trouble connecting with them/us, because we do things so differently than she is used to. She read the Dear Grandma book in one night and she came to me the very next day chatty and positive and even saying she wished she had know about Unschooling when her kids were young. I think those books opened the door for all of us to start being able to talk openly about what we are doing because they now have some background on the lifestyle. Without it there was fear, ignorance and assumptions.</div>

<br/>
When I told stories like that, I would add, “But I didn’t *say* “algebra” to them, I’m just telling you the story.”<br/>
<br/>
Another way to help other adults chill out is to ask them (not when kids around, and in as nice a way as possible) where they’ve used algebra themselves, lately, in real life.  They might have an answer.  If so, cool.  It will be something practical.  Maybe about utility bills, or adjusting a woodworking pattern or something.  Keep it in mind for the future.  :-) You might ask them if they could still have figured those things out other ways. it doesn’t need to be a conversation with a big conclusing, just a little information for both sides.  Let it go for the moment; keep it for longterm.  <br/>

      <p>-=- I realize that one thing I do is refuse to talk about unschooling in schooly ways, and if I get over myself about it and say, &quot; Wallace made a times table chart last week!&quot; (Which is true) or &quot;Wallace is saving up for a WiiU and he used algebra to calculate that if he mows x lawns, plus allowance, plus his current capital, he&#39;ll have enough by y&quot; they will have the information translated into their language and I won&#39;t have to overcome the &quot;unschooling language-barrier.” -=-<br>
<br>
When I told stories like that, I would add, “But I didn’t *say* “algebra” to them, I’m just telling you the story.”<br>
<br>
Another way to help other adults chill out is to ask them (not when kids around, and in as nice a way as possible) where they’ve used algebra themselves, lately, in real life.  They might have an answer.  If so, cool.  It will be something practical.  Maybe about utility bills, or adjusting a woodworking pattern or something.  Keep it in mind for the future.  :-) You might ask them if they could still have figured those things out other ways. it doesn’t need to be a conversation with a big conclusing, just a little information for both sides.  Let it go for the moment; keep it for longterm.  <br>

&quot;Little Joe can  bake a cake all by himself!! &quot;<br/>
&quot;Little Ann is so good at building in Minecraft! She is an engineer and architect !! Her houses are strong stylish!”-=-<br/>
<br/>
(from Alex)<br/>
<br/>
Brags I used for my kids, for older relatives:<br/>
<br/>
When kids aren’t getting along at our park meet-ups, Kirby and Sara (Cordova, the oldest of the other organizer’s set of three kids) defuse and make peace.  They’re really good at it.<br/>
<br/>
Marty could roller skate the day I bought him Fisher Price skates, so the next day we got him real roller blades, and he skated away.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Holly came along the relatives were more confidence already, so I don’t remember bragging about Holly as much.  But when she was 16, she wanted to work in a flower shop near here, and couldn’t figure out how to  apply.  I wrote a letter for her to take over there saying she was homeschooled and great with making things like flower fairies (maybe I sent photos with it, I don’t remember), and if the owner would be willing to let her help out during an upcoming busy season (May:  Mother’s Day, high school proms, Memorial Day), I would be willing to pay them and it could be school credit for her.<br/>
<br/>
Instead they hired her.  So that was bragging (me to the store owner) that led to another brag (for the relatives), but she was nearly grown by then.  <br/>
