In my daughter Vivi&#39;s search for all things barbie, she came across these zombie dolls. She&#39;s also a horror movie fan, so they&#39;re just perfect. Each one comes in a coffin with a death certificate. We&#39;ve ordered one and she&#39;s hugely excited! She was keen on having a go at repainting a barbie&#39;s face, and now she&#39;s probably going to create a living dead barbie!<br/>
<br/>
If you click on &quot;Morticians&quot; in the left side menu, you can read the story of the creators. It&#39;s a cool story about following a passion and how that was supported by parents.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have these dolls?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002972631">I&#39;ve not seen these, but if you go to Ebay, and:<br/>
 <br/>
 click on dolls,<br/>
 <br/>
 then artist made dolls, <br/>
 <br/>
then OOAK (one of a kind),<br/>
 <br/>
 then &quot;Other, <br/>
 <br/>
you will find a lot of these types of dolls that people make themselves and  <br/>
sell.  I really like the ragdoll goth type, or outsider art dolls.<br/>
