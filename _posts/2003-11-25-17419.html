<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316401827">Hi <br/>
 I joined a couple of weeks ago, but I&#39;m not sure if I introduced <br/>
myself yet or not. My computer had been acting up & I think I forgot <br/>
to. Anyway, my name is Denise. I am a mom of 3. My eldest is 15 & <br/>
home schooled. My daughter is 10 & returned to PS this year againest <br/>
my better judgement & my youngest son is 17 months & will be home <br/>
schooled right from the beginning. I&#39;m looking forward to getting to <br/>
know everyone.<br/>
       Peace<br/>
       Denise</div>
