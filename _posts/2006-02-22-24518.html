<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Interestingly enough I have noticed that my DS has<br/>
&gt; recently stopped telling people he is homeschooling when they ask if<br/>
&gt; he is in kindergarten or first grade, he just says kindergarten<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter has gone from saying &quot;we homeschool&quot; to saying &quot;I don&#39;t go <br/>
to school.&quot;  It usually stops other questions from coming!  If people <br/>
are receptive I explain, if it is some man chatting with us in the <br/>
frozen foods section I just smile big and change the subject!<br/>
