Like almost everything having to do with laws on these national <br/>
(international!) lists, that varies. Here in Illinois, without passing state <br/>
licensed drivers ed a kid can&#39;t get a license until they&#39;re 18. To get a <br/>

Afghanis and Pakistanis and make them taxi drivers and then add thousands<br/>
of millionaires in throw-away mercedes and jags and let me tell you it<br/>
creates slight havoc. We bought a 4-wheel drive out of necessity as you do<br/>
not want to be smaller than other people! People here haven&#39;t quite figured<br/>
out that whole white line thing of keeping your car in your own lane nor<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my home town, learning to drive in the 1960s where there were NO traffic <br/>
lights, and the roads were ancient donkey-cart farm roads along tiny rivers <br/>
and irrigation ditches, around big trees, etc., people didn&#39;t bother to <br/>
signal if they were turning at their own road or driveway.  Why should they <br/>
tell you they&#39;re turning if you would totally EXPECT them to turn at their <br/>
own house?<br/>
<br/>
And many of the roads were dead end roads anyway, basically (or not through <br/>
streets anyway) so if someone was on Chimayo road, or San Pedro, or some <br/>
residential kind of thing, they will turn in an obvious place, and so other <br/>
drivers should be aware.  Store?  Church?  School?  People will be turning.  <br/>
Their own house?  Of course.<br/>
<br/>
So turn signals were used on the highway, or if you were turning <br/>
&quot;unexpectedly&quot; into a place you didn&#39;t usually go.<br/>

This is how I like it!! There are some on ramps here where it is <br/>
imperative that you hustle, and some people just don&#39;t get it.  I had <br/>
to delivery drive in Portland, OR for a while so I really got the <br/>
hang of hustling. Although there are some metering lights there too <br/>
(which I hated, but were necessary evils).<br/>
