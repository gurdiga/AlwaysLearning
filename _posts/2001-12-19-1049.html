<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123284755">my isp was having mail problems earlier in the week.  many messages to<br/>
my mailbox were delayed by up to 48 hours, and i suspect that some<br/>
messages were lost, as well.  if you&#39;ve sent me anything of importance<br/>
this week and i haven&#39;t responded in a timely manner, please resend or<br/>
give a call.  thanks!<br/>
<br/>
