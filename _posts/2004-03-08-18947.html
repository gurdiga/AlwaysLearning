<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034757008">Please help spread the word about the oldest homeschooling <br/>
conference in Maryland (since 1980, secular and unschooling friendly <br/>
to boot. John Holt was the key note speaker at one of the first of <br/>
these conferences!).<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to check out the MHEA conference at Anne Arundel Community <br/>
College (located midway between Baltimore and Annapolis) on April 3, <br/>
2004 from 8:00 am to 5:30 pm. The keynote speaker is Daniel Pink, <br/>
author of &quot;Free Agent Nation&quot; (http://www.fun-<br/>
books.com/books/8791.htm). Mr Pink makes a strong argument for <br/>
homeschooling being an excellent preparation for the changing <br/>
workforce.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the keynote speech, there will be lots of workshops <br/>
for new homeschoolers as well as veteran homeschoolers. There will <br/>
be a talent show, a panel of homeschool graduates speaking about <br/>
their experiences in the real world of college, work and the <br/>
military and much more! Lunch will be available on the premises.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there will be a Local Support Group fair with representatives <br/>
invited from every support group in Maryland, a Resource Fair with a <br/>
wide variety of vendors offering homeschooling materials (FUN Books, <br/>
www.FUN-Books.com, will be there with lots of great materials - you <br/>
can order in advance and pick up at the conference to save shipping <br/>
and ensure the items you want will be available, or you can request <br/>
specific items you want brought for you to see), and there will be a <br/>
used curriculum sale/swap/give-away fair.<br/>
<br/>
You can get details and registration forms at <br/>
