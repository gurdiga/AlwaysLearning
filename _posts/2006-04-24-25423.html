<div id="ygrps-yiv-878173537">I can honestly say that there have been days when I could of poked my <br/>
own  eyes out in sheer frustration,days when I think I understood why <br/>
some animals ate their young:)and these were, and still are the times <br/>
where I tread lightly.Experience has taught me alot about myself and <br/>
my limitations,in moments when stuff gets tense.Punishment is a <br/>
big &#39;ol word,and is highly charged,at it&#39;s least full of shame,at it&#39;s <br/>
worst.....:-(  Anarchy,my little anarchists,beautiful and strong,full <br/>
of themselves in away only children can be.I do step in when things <br/>
get hairy with the kids,because I am there mother and I feel that part <br/>
of my role is to give them tools to use in times of conflict show them <br/>
an alternative until they discover something that works better for <br/>
them.This said I am so far from where I am going as a parent that when <br/>
I have discovered one fine method to share with the world on child <br/>
rearing I will have forgotten long ago what it was we were talking <br/>
about.</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m probably an anarchist once removed. FIRST, I&#39;m a realist---and <br/>
realistic enough to know that anarchy works only if everyone&#39;s on board <br/>
with no other meddling agenda! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If everyone is working towards the same gentle, peaceful, trusting, <br/>
respectful principles, then anarchy works great. But when someone comes <br/>
in with a rusty sword---the idea of taking over the world or having <br/>
everything *his* way...well, then we get a chink in our armor. Every <br/>
poke, every jab weakens the solidity our little anarchy requires.<br/>
<br/>
So if you see your household as a place where every one can get what he <br/>
needs/wants, then it&#39;s working! Anarchy &quot;rules&quot; here because it <br/>
works---we&#39;re  all in it for the long haul. We each want the best---for <br/>
each other and for ourselves. It works.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment can only happen when *someone* is ruling---when someone has <br/>
the power and the need to control others.<br/>

<br/>
But with happy, controlled anarchy too, someone had the power to  <br/>
decide that anarchy would be the environment to culture or to allow.   <br/>
It&#39;s not REAL anarchy to live really loosely.  You still don&#39;t let  <br/>
passers-by into the fridge, and you trust that your bicycles and cars  <br/>
will still be where you left them.<br/>

Absence of any form of political authority.<br/>
Political disorder and confusion.<br/>
Absence of any cohesive principle, such as a common standard or purpose.<br/>
<br/>
When I say that unschooling isn&#39;t anarchy - it is more because of the  <br/>
third part of the definition. The first two are really about  <br/>
government, but I guess we could stretch it to mean lack of authority  <br/>
of the adults over the kids. If we did that, I&#39;d want to talk about  <br/>
authentic authority as opposed to purely political authority and all  <br/>
that, because I do think there is authority - we may choose, as  <br/>
adults, not to use our (political) authority to oppress our kids, but  <br/>
we have it, nonetheless. AND we have a lot of natural authority just  <br/>
by virtue of living longer and having had the chance to learn a lot  <br/>
about what makes life good and because our kids are dependent on us  <br/>
in very real ways. What we do AS unschooling parents is to set things  <br/>
up so that there isn&#39;t the disorder and confusion of anarchy - we are  <br/>
the ones who have determined that there are important principles we  <br/>
want to live by, those are the organizing principles in our family  <br/>
lives, and we&#39;re modeling and supporting the appreciation of those  <br/>
same principles in our children.<br/>
<br/>
The third meaning of anarchy - absence of any cohesive principles,  <br/>
such as a common standard or purpose -- THAT is truly the opposite of  <br/>
what I think of as life in an unschooling family. I think that is  <br/>
what people sometimes miss - they get the idea of not being the  <br/>
equivalent of an oppressive government, but they don&#39;t get that there  <br/>
IS something else, guiding principles that bring order and purpose to  <br/>
life, and that they, the parents, need to find ways for the whole  <br/>
family to live together according to those principles.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra repeatedly points out that the best way to do this is to live  <br/>
it yourself - treat the kids kindly and they learn to be kind, etc. I  <br/>
think some people brush this aside as too pat an answer or something.  <br/>
It really IS the most significant thing parents can do. Or they think  <br/>
they are facing more difficult challenges - their kids hit each  <br/>
other, for example, even though the parents don&#39;t hit them - so they  <br/>
think modeling isn&#39;t enough. Right. I agree. You also have to be  <br/>
clear about another principle - something like, &quot;Everybody should be  <br/>
safe from harm.&quot; Again, that&#39;s why this isn&#39;t anarchy - parents  <br/>
should step in (and use their authority) to make sure everybody is  <br/>
safe. The parent doesn&#39;t have to shame the kid who hit - the parent  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to yell - the parent doesn&#39;t have to say, &quot;You&#39;re so  <br/>
mean,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ve told you a million times, when are you going to  <br/>
learn,&quot; or any other derogatory statement - but the parent has to  <br/>
give clear, honest information: &quot;I&#39;m not going to let anybody hurt  <br/>
anybody else. Everybody should feel safe in their own home. If you  <br/>
were a grown-up hitting another grown up with a stick, you could go  <br/>
to jail for it.&quot; (Depending on age - I&#39;m not saying threaten or scare  <br/>
a little kid.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think some people are ashamed or embarrassed by kindness, or don&#39;t  <br/>
have much experience with really relaxing into generosity.  Maybe  <br/>
their love relationship has a hostile tension and they&#39;re afraid of  <br/>
being nicer to a child than to the spouse/partner.  Sometimes that  <br/>
sets a mark that other things are compared to, and acts as a block.   <br/>
So relationships in which the parents are honest and open and kind  <br/>
with each other make the other things easier (or possible).<br/>
<br/>
Some people seem to think the &quot;being kind&quot; can be done by rote, with  <br/>
words, as though it&#39;s some kind of etiquette-book formula, and they  <br/>
will &quot;try it&quot; but already are pretty sure it&#39;s not going to work.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re right.  It&#39;s not going to work if they&#39;re not BEING kind, in  <br/>
their being.<br/>
<br/>
Faking is better than nothing, and &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; is a  <br/>
valid stopgap or stepping stone.   But &quot;don&#39;t dream it; be it&quot; might  <br/>
be a better slogan (especially for the musical-theatre-ly inclined,  <br/>
or the musically/theatrically inclined).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I&#39;m thinking about state law and all...<br/>
<br/>
If a grown up is hitting another grownup with a stick, he WILL go to  <br/>
jail for it.<br/>
In Albuquerque, at least (and maybe the whole state; not sure),  <br/>
domestic violence calls have a mandatory lockup for at least one of  <br/>
the people involved, stick or no stick.<br/>
<br/>
Threatening or scaring isn&#39;t necessary, but as kids are getting  <br/>
older, I think it would be a disservice NOT to talk to them casually  <br/>
about criminal acts, and such things not being okay.<br/>
<br/>
For a few years Holly used to say &quot;Can I hit Marty?&quot; when she&#39;d get  <br/>
mad at him, knowing full well I would say &quot;Yes, when you&#39;re  <br/>
eighteen.&quot;  Or I&#39;d say &quot;Yes, when you&#39;re eighteen, if you have your  <br/>
own place. Invite him over, and then hit him.&quot;   And Marty would say,  <br/>
&quot;Yeah?  I&#39;m not going to your eighteenth birthday party, Holly.&quot;  She  <br/>
was seven, nine, eleven years old in those days.  Then they stopped  <br/>
discussing it. &lt;g&gt;  It was good to diffuse many situations, even when  <br/>
they were honestly angry.  One time Holly clenched her fists and  <br/>
yelled &quot;I can&#39;t wait &#39;til I&#39;m 18!!&quot;  We all got it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After that time she became seriously fond of Marty.  She totally  <br/>
admires him and is proud to be his sister.  And in the past year or  <br/>
so she took an interest in Kirby and started seeing good things about  <br/>
him, whereas before he had irritated her, and sometimes not been as  <br/>
nice to her as Marty was.   She even said &quot;Kirby&#39;s my favorite  <br/>
brother&quot; once last summer, which surprised us both.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that would be as likely to have happened if I had spent  <br/>
a lot of energy trying to make them be friends.  I didn&#39;t.  I helped  <br/>
them find separate things to do, and helped them not feel trapped  <br/>
with the siblings.  Hundreds of times, Keith or I took the least  <br/>
satisfied of the three out away from the house for one reason or  <br/>
another, real or trumped up, so the other two could relax and the  <br/>
angry or frustrated one could express herself or himself at length  <br/>
(or not, as she chose).<br/>
<br/>
When one of the younger ones would say &quot;Kirby&#39;s stupid&quot; or &quot;I hate  <br/>
Kirby,&quot; I would express sympathy and maybe slight agreement or  <br/>
acknowledgement that he could be irritating, and it must be hard  <br/>
having a brother so &quot;out there&quot; and sociable and sometimes  <br/>
insensitive, and I was sorry, and what could I do to make the moment  <br/>
better, but I would always point out some of this:  while I  <br/>
understood their frustration, I really loved Kirby, and that Kirby  <br/>
would have been an only child if not for them, and for me having more  <br/>
children, and so they might want to cut him some slack because his  <br/>
ideal life was interrupted by their presence.  I did the &quot;on the  <br/>
other hand&quot; commentary, at least a little.<br/>
<br/>
Or I&#39;d handle it with humor.  The Marty-to-Kirby humor, starting when  <br/>
they were very young, involved my offer to smite Kirby.  &quot;Kirby&#39;s not  <br/>
sharing.&quot;  &quot;Shall I smite him?&quot;  &quot;Yes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I would go to Kirby and say &quot;Marty wishes me to smite you,  <br/>
Kirby.  Is it possible you could share?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No smiting actually went on in those cases, but the idea of it seemed  <br/>
to satisfy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029950028">Chenzo (ds&#39; nickname among many) was so zen today it was scary.  The<br/>
nature of being a child... the nature of the child being, of the human<br/>
being.  He has been asking me &quot;remember&quot; things lately..  &quot;remember<br/>
when I ouchied my arm on the stove?&quot;  For sure he has *been*<br/>
remembering but now he&#39;s talking about it too.  <br/>
<br/>
I got so irritated at him yesterday and swatted him.  He didn&#39;t cry,<br/>
flinch or whimper but an eerie still look came over his face. <br/>
Watchfulness.  And I realized the kid is recording this moment and<br/>
he&#39;s going to have it to remember.  :(((((((  And so I talked with him<br/>
about that and apologized and said I really need to internalize better<br/>
ways of doing things, and promised that I will.  <br/>
