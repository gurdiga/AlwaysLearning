<div id="ygrps-yiv-262201006">Today is Marty&#39;s 18th birthday.  He can go to the community college  <br/>
now without taking a GED.   He&#39;s planning to take some classes, maybe  <br/>
summer or fall.  (Just thinking, at this point.)<br/>
<br/>
He can work at any job at the grocery store, not just &quot;courtesy  <br/>
clerk&quot; (bagging and cart retrieval and that).  Several departments  <br/>
have been courting and flirting since he first went to work there.   <br/>
He can&#39;t be a checker yet because he can&#39;t sell liquor, and he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to work stocking because they work overnight.  He might  <br/>
not even stay there, but he knows they&#39;ll might be pressing him to  <br/>
&quot;move up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly was offered a good babysitting job.  Well, the offer was  <br/>
public, and I wrote and said she might be interested, and the mom was  <br/>
really happy about that, because the older child knows and really  <br/>
likes Holly.  It will be nearly $100 a week, when it gets going, and  <br/>
last to May.   There&#39;s a toddler involved, and Holly really likes  <br/>
being around littler children (being a youngest, being 15).<br/>
<br/>
So everyone was saying &quot;Hey, Holly&#39;s got a job! on Satuday.<br/>
<br/>
Late that night, really late, I was playing Guitar Hero with Kirby  <br/>
and he said &quot;I got a call back from Client Logic.&quot;   Client Logic  <br/>
does customer support for World of Warcraft and Tivo and something or  <br/>
other else, I forget.  I asked what they said, and he said to come to  <br/>
orientation on Monday.   No interview?  Apparently not.   Why didn&#39;t  <br/>
you say so earlier?  Everyone was excited about Holly&#39;s job and he  <br/>
figured he&#39;d just wait.<br/>
<br/>
That was a very sweet thing for him to do, to let the excitement of  <br/>
the day be all hers, for her first job.<br/>
<br/>
Marty took a week off from work because Madelyn is visiting here from  <br/>
Seattle.  Every night so far there&#39;s been something planned going on,  <br/>
the first three nights involving me and other adults and teens all  <br/>
mixed.  Last night was Marty&#39;s birthday party, elsewhere.  Keith and  <br/>
I were invited, but we declined, to hang out at home by ourselves.    <br/>
Busy week, and fun.<br/>
<br/>

   <br/>
  Happy belated birthday to Marty!  And congrats on all of the good news in your household.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Question: once you turn 18 you don&#39;t have to take the GED to go to community college?  Is that in every state?<br/>

No.  Hardly anything&#39;s in every state. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For a long time people who were still of legal school age couldn&#39;t  <br/>
take the GED in New Mexico, so they would drive to Arizona and take  <br/>
it.  The Arizona certificate was good in New Mexico, and Arizona  <br/>
didn&#39;t mind giving them to people out of state.<br/>
<br/>
For readers in fancy exotic places, like British Columbia and  <br/>
Sedgefield, Cleveland, GED stands for Graduate Record Exam, and it&#39;s  <br/>
a less respected substitute for a high school diploma.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850299821">Late happy b&#39;day to Marty! I hardly ever post but wanted to share a bit of what my girls are doing. My middle dd age 16 started GED classes last week. She was mostly unschooled except for a few unit studies yrs ago, when I was still trying to wrap my mind around unschooling. I think its cool that she chose to do this on her own and has done amazingly well considering she had never taken a test in her life. In the placement tests she scored way high in language and not so well in math.. as she expected. But she is confident that she will do fine, even with math, after a few classes. My oldest dd now 22, took the GED when she was 18 and scored quite high. She was the one who put up with the most of my &#39;school-at-home&#39; ideas. I wonder what my totally unschooled, soon to be 12 yo dd will decide? Its been quite an adventure, learning to let go and to trust them. I still have my moments, but thankfully they are far and few between these days. Julie in MO<br/>
