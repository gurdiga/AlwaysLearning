<div id="ygrps-yiv-576685161">We have had major issues letting go of tv and computer time, food control, oh lots of things. We have let go finally. The kids weren&#39;t sure what to do at first when we started saying yes more. Food control is no more and they are doing just fine, actually eating healthier than they ever have before. However, we sat<br/>
with them and watched tv and played computer games with them. I am still not an anime fan<br/>
but their dad is. I enjoy watching their eyes light up as they talk<br/>
about their shows, movies, and games. I enjoy being right there with<br/>
them as they explore their worlds. My daughter and her friend are making their own manga graphic<br/>
novel. Her friend&#39;s parents thanked us for giving him an outlet for<br/>
those &quot;weird&quot; pictures he likes to draw. My son has created his own little world that he lives in with his best bud. We have relaxed and realized that we are here to love and guide, that school is so unnecessary especially school at home. Family and friend support has been close to nil, actually we have chosen not to let their negativity affect us and our decisions. We might have a year ago but now our confidence that we are doing the best thing for our family has built up. We still have days that we second guess and question our decision. We still have days where we revert to parenting the old way, but they are becoming fewer and far between. I do not expect to have perfect days everyday. <br/>
<br/>
I found I do not have to include what they like or are passionate about<br/>
in my list of things that I enjoy, however, I love their passion, their<br/>
enjoyment. I include them in the things that I love to do and I am<br/>
passionate about. Sometimes it is just curiosity to see what mommy is<br/>
up to and sometimes they actually enjoy the activity and other times<br/>
they just sit and we talk about things while I work on projects. My<br/>
husband and I have even grown closer and are more open than we ever<br/>
were before. We share so many more things. He has had more trouble<br/>
accepting unschooling as our lifestyle but he is making a concious<br/>
effort to read, learn and change his way of thinking. He is actually<br/>
considering unjobbing, of course there are a lot of fears to work past.<br/>
But he is looking at the world differently as well and seeing that we<br/>
can create our lives and live them the way we want.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I am being paged to see a block castle and I do think I saw the 4 yr old going down the hall with nails and a hammer, it must be a good one he wants to keep.<br/>

It was inspiring, that&#39;s true.  I didn&#39;t mean to let this post  <br/>
through, though.  I botched removing it.  I had the note ready to go  <br/>
to Debs saying please don&#39;t re-send or append full posts, and please  <br/>
don&#39;t post anything that amounts to &quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;me too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because the list is large and very active, it&#39;s more courteous to  <br/>
refrain from courtesies.   What&#39;s sweet and good in a group of fifteen  <br/>
or fifty people doesn&#39;t work when there are over a thousand.<br/>
<br/>
So, reminders, please crop the quotes and only quote the parts  <br/>
necessary to make your post make sense.    It&#39;s not unusual for a post  <br/>
to be sent back with a request to make each post something that will  <br/>
help others understand unschooling better.   That can be done with  <br/>
good questions, or stories of how it&#39;s working, or with comments on  <br/>
others&#39; stories or questions.<br/>
<br/>
When in doubt, choose learning over chit chat.  Let&#39;s assume that all  <br/>
posts are inspiring and that all the other readers are grateful. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
