<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586943580">Hi all,<br/>
I am in two homeschool groups in this area, for the play groups.  That is the <br/>
only thing that we go to.  Anyway... One group knows we are unschoolers and I <br/>
feel I can talk with the parents etc.  The second group we are just getting <br/>
started with and like I said we only attend the play group, it isn&#39;t <br/>
important to me that I have friendships with the parents.  <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, the second group has an E mail list that is supposed to be <br/>
for informational purposes like letting everyone know about a group trip <br/>
coming up etc.  Every once in a while I get some little junk E mail poem or <br/>
Bible quote, but not often and I usually just delete.  But this morning I got <br/>
a poem (which I cut and pasted below) and just wonder how you all would deal <br/>
with it.  Would you respond, I hate for all those people on the list to think <br/>
that everyone agrees with the statement it makes?  Or would you delete it <br/>
since the list isn&#39;t a discussion list and I really don&#39;t care what those <br/>
parents think?  If I respond I will be in the minority, not that I care.  The <br/>
poem just rubbed me the wrong way today, made all the little hairs on the <br/>
back of my neck stand up.  <br/>
<br/>
And the woman posting it was basically saying that none of &quot;our&quot; children <br/>
would dare try to express themselves, or even think they have rights.  And <br/>
the thought of a mother squashing those rights is cool.  Remember I live in <br/>
the Bible Belt.<br/>
<br/>
So against my grain Maybe I should just sit on it for a day and see if I <br/>
still have the same gut reaction tomorrow.  I know what I would say just <br/>
wondering if I should say it or let it pass?<br/>
 Thanks<br/>
Pam G.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I know that NONE of our kids would have an attitude like this :-) but <br/>
couldn&#39;t resist....Have a great weekend ,. -----<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;&gt;My son came home from school one day,<br/>
&gt;&gt;with a smirk upon his face.<br/>
&gt;&gt;He decided he was smart enough,<br/>
&gt;&gt;to put me in my place.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Guess what I learned in Civics Two,<br/>
&gt;&gt;that&#39;s taught by Mr. Wright?<br/>
&gt;&gt;It&#39;s all about the laws today,<br/>
&gt;&gt;The &quot;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;It says I need not clean my room,<br/>
&gt;&gt;don&#39;t have to cut my hair.<br/>
&gt;&gt;No one can tell me what to think,<br/>
&gt;&gt;or speak, or what to wear.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I have freedom from religion,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and regardless what you say,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t have to bow my head,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and I sure don&#39;t have to pray.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I can wear earrings if I want,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and pierce my tongue &nose.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I can read &watch just what I like,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and get tattoos from head to toes.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;And if you ever spank me,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll charge you with a crime.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll back up all my charges,<br/>
&gt;&gt;with the marks on my behind.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t you ever touch me,<br/>
&gt;&gt;my body&#39;s only for my use,<br/>
&gt;&gt;not for your hugs and kisses,<br/>
&gt;&gt;that&#39;s just more child abuse.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t preach about your morals,<br/>
&gt;&gt;like your Mama did to you.<br/>
&gt;&gt;That&#39;s nothing more than mind control,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and it&#39;s illegal too!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Mom, I have these children&#39;s rights,<br/>
&gt;&gt;so you can&#39;t influence me,<br/>
&gt;&gt;or I&#39;ll call Children&#39;s Services Division,<br/>
&gt;&gt;better known as C.S.D.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Of course my first instinct was<br/>
&gt;&gt;To toss him out the door.<br/>
&gt;&gt;But the chance to teach him a lesson<br/>
&gt;&gt;made me think a little more.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I mulled it over carefully,<br/>
&gt;&gt;I couldn&#39;t let this go.<br/>
&gt;&gt;A smile crept upon my face,<br/>
&gt;&gt;He&#39;s messing with a pro.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The next day I took him shopping<br/>
&gt;&gt;at the local Goodwill Store.<br/>
&gt;&gt;I told him,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Pick out all you want,<br/>
&gt;&gt;there&#39;s shirts &pants galore.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve called and checked with C.S.D.<br/>
&gt;&gt;who said they didn&#39;t care<br/>
&gt;&gt;if I bought you K-Mart shoes<br/>
&gt;&gt;instead of those Nike Airs.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;And I&#39;ve canceled that appointment<br/>
&gt;&gt;to take your driver&#39;s test.<br/>
&gt;&gt;The C.S.D. is unconcerned<br/>
&gt;&gt;so I&#39;ll decide what&#39;s best.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I said &quot;No time to stop and eat,<br/>
&gt;&gt;or pick up stuff to munch.<br/>
&gt;&gt;And tomorrow you can start to learn<br/>
&gt;&gt;to make your own sack lunch.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Just save the raging appetite,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and wait till dinner time.<br/>
&gt;&gt;We&#39;re having liver and onions,<br/>
&gt;&gt;a favorite dish of mine.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;He asked &quot;Can I please rent a movie,<br/>
&gt;&gt;to watch on my VCR?&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Sorry, but I sold your TV,<br/>
&gt;&gt;for new tires on my car.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I also rented out your room,<br/>
&gt;&gt;you&#39;ll take the couch instead.<br/>
&gt;&gt;All the C.S.D. requires is<br/>
&gt;&gt;a roof for over your head.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Your clothing won&#39;t be trendy now,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and I&#39;ll choose what we eat.<br/>
&gt;&gt;That allowance that you used to get,<br/>
&gt;&gt;will buy me something neat.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;m selling off your jet ski,<br/>
&gt;&gt;dirt-bike &roller blades.<br/>
&gt;&gt;Check out the &quot;Parents Bill of Rights,&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;It&#39;s in effect today!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hey hot shot,<br/>
&gt;&gt;are you crying,<br/>
&gt;&gt;and why are you on your knees?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Are you asking God to help you out,<br/>
&gt;&gt;instead of C.S.D..?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So you are using the second group for its play group and e-mail <br/>
list, but you object to the group using you to share amongst <br/>
themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that perhaps your attendance at their play group is <br/>
disingenuous?  I&#39;ll bet that they ARE looking for friends for both <br/>
themselves and their children through their playgroup and list and <br/>
you are essentially an intruder in their midst.<br/>
<br/>
While I too find the poem offensive, I would defend their right to <br/>
have a group that supports them and you are clearly not part of <br/>
their group.  Time for you to move on?</div>

<br/>
This came on the Pentecostal list I&#39;m on (I know, I know---but I sometimes just like to stir things up! &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
I replied that it was VERY sad that a mother would treat a child, whom she supposedly LOVES, so disrepectfully. That, by modeling such disrespect, she should expect the same as the child matures. How very, very sad!<br/>
<br/>
The poster wrote back that it was *just* a joke---a poem. What was I getting so upset about? I let it go. <br/>
<br/>
There are some real flakes on that list. I hate that they are representative of homeschoolers. (But they probably think the same of me! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I like to stir things up sometimes! <br/>

across the bow?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on a list or two like that (for some reason, they&#39;re always LOCAL <br/>
lists).  On one I just took to posting something that someone else wrote from <br/>
the exact opposite view.  They didn&#39;t like it.  hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and that particular poem pisses me off!<br/>

is common, so it wouldn&#39;t be EXPECTED to generate discussion.  The <br/>

<br/>
My answer is meant to go to the bigger question of why involve <br/>
yourself with people who are fundamentally not like you and then <br/>
insist that they conform to your values and beliefs?  Isn&#39;t that <br/>
just a set up for frustration?  Aren&#39;t most play groups designed to <br/>
support the participants and for possible long-term relationships?</div>

the Mom&#39;s night out, make yourself known.  It could be there is one person -<br/>
the one sending the posts - who is imposing her views, contrary to the rest<br/>
of the group.  It must be attracting people who desire a nonreligious group,<br/>
but maybe they&#39;re like you, thinking they are all alone.<br/>
<br/>
You might send an email to the person who sent it, suggesting that not<br/>
everyone on the list appreciates that type of &quot;inspiration,&quot; and that she<br/>
stick to business.<br/>

I understand your being upset about this poem. It&#39;s just sick in my opinion. It reminds me of someone on my local group.  I thought I was having a good discussion with about autonomy, and then out of the blue he sent a post which contained &quot;Just like a garden left to grow weeds, children , if left to themselves will produce evil&quot; I still haven&#39;t decided what to say to that! I was amazed, as he has always seemed so sensible! Is it even worth talking to these people? And is this attitude a general christian thing or what?<br/>

<br/>
You mentioned not having connections with the parents in that <br/>
group...you might want to spend some time getting to know them. If <br/>
you then find that the group as a whole has the view of the poem, <br/>
you could move on. It is great that you have the option of a couple <br/>
groups to choose from!<br/>

&gt; Bible quote, but not often and I usually just delete.  But this morning I got <br/>
&gt; a poem (which I cut and pasted below) and just wonder how you all would deal <br/>
&gt; with it.  Would you respond, I hate for all those people on the list to think <br/>
&gt; that everyone agrees with the statement it makes?  Or would you delete it <br/>
&gt; since the list isn&#39;t a discussion list and I really don&#39;t care what those <br/>
&gt; parents think?  If I respond I will be in the minority, not that I care.  The <br/>
&gt; poem just rubbed me the wrong way today, made all the little hairs on the <br/>
&gt; back of my neck stand up.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And the woman posting it was basically saying that none of &quot;our&quot; children <br/>
&gt; would dare try to express themselves, or even think they have rights.  And <br/>
&gt; the thought of a mother squashing those rights is cool.  Remember I live in <br/>
&gt; the Bible Belt.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen this floating around and was horrified too, even sent it to a <br/>
friend expressing my dismay with the point of view and she told me she <br/>
was so glad that I had -- because, get this, her *mother* then sent it <br/>
on to her saying what a great poem she thought it was! She said she was <br/>
glad she&#39;d seen it first and had time to process the negativity before <br/>
she received her mom&#39;s email. :/<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think there is a great segment of the population, either <br/>
childless or with their kids grown and they are so out of touch with <br/>
them, that they just don&#39;t see how awful the sentiments really are. <br/>
Since it&#39;s making the email rounds I would take it less seriously than a <br/>
private post from someone who articulates those same feelings in their <br/>
own words. Sometimes people just aren&#39;t that thoughtful about stuff that <br/>
they forward on. No sense getting into a discussion on a hometown list <br/>
that will just lead to less feelings of respect between the members.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it might be a good opportunity to take one of the <br/>
more objectionable sections of it, one that almost anyone would be <br/>
appalled at, and state your own feelings of dismay at reading it, <br/>
without implicating the original poster in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents worth<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504463457">I agree that these views are common in many Christian circles.  <br/>
However, they are distorted and &quot;taken out of context&quot; to fit a <br/>
rather blackhearted outlook, and not proper scriptural <br/>
interpretation.  What a horrible email... ew!  It&#39;s a paranoia that <br/>
many Christians have-- that the world is out to &quot;get&quot; them --which <br/>
is sometimes true but mostly not... so much so that many Christians <br/>
try to fight the evil out of their children.  Tragically <br/>
destructive.  We would all like to simplify and categorize because <br/>
it would seem neater to think about things, people and situations <br/>
like that, but life is much more complex.  <br/>

General fundamentalist attitude.  <br/>
He was generous not to suggest (as some do) that babies are born  sinful.<br/>
