Well, they did suggest -- at least twice -- getting one for your hubby, or even using one for Mom & Dad.  Can you imagine being married to someone who needed to be controlled with the Dreaded Consequences wheel?  <br/>
 <br/>
I will agree, tho, it&#39;s likely not as bad as spanking.  They seem to be pitching to the reluctant spanker crowd.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599288308">There&#39;s a woman on the state list who can&#39;t understand why her 8 yo <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to sit down at Abeka at 9am every morning. She laments that <br/>
the child doesn&#39;t see the work as &#39;important&#39; and she wonders why she <br/>
can&#39;t &#39;control&#39; her child.<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
All the other posters suggested ways of controlling the child. No <br/>
cartoons unless maths was done. No TV ever. Various punishments etc etc. <br/>
I of course, jumped in with Unschooling. Which went down like a lead <br/>
balloon. I don&#39;t know why I bother sometimes except the thought of that <br/>
poor child sitting at a table at 9am with a pile of curriculum books :-(<br/>

One mom in the satisfied customer quotes wrote; &quot;I think the kids were <br/>
intimidated and curious of the wheel when we first got it - now that we have had a <br/>
couple of spins I think they are getting the message.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Wow! She got that right, what kid wouldn&#39;t feel intimidated at the sight or <br/>
even the thought of a &quot;Wheel of Dreaded Consequences&quot;? Intimidated and curious, <br/>
like a dog with a brand new underground electric fence and collar. First <br/>
time, ZAP! Instant pain and confusion, yet the very nature of the dog makes it <br/>
reach out and feel for that boundary at least one or two more times before it <br/>
finally withdraws in defeat and pain. The name says it all. Then again, there is <br/>
a 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed, so I guess if the kids didn&#39;t fall in step and <br/>
toe the line ASAP, you could get your money back! &lt;eg&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Another thing I saw on the list of *suggested* wrongs that would make you <br/>
have to spin the wheel was &quot;Talking without permission&quot; Now if you didn&#39;t have <br/>
permission to talk, how would you ask for permission to talk? <br/>

here.  We need to do our own.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Wheel of Delightful Alternatives&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how you play:<br/>
<br/>
1. When you and your child can&#39;t agree on what to do, then you<br/>
   must &quot;face the wheel&quot;.  (Other themes available)<br/>
<br/>
2. Your child will spin the wheel, and you will both be required<br/>
   to participate in the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
3. We&#39;ll provide lots of options, but you can always fill in your<br/>
   own or use our template to print a custom wheel that will meet<br/>
   the needs of your unique family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the Delightful Alternatives we offer:<br/>
<br/>
 - stay home and watch a movie together<br/>
 - go for a swim<br/>
 - eat some ice cream<br/>
 - play a game<br/>
 - go to the store and buy something fun for under $1<br/>
 - read a story together<br/>
 - invite over a friend<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When my child first saw the wheel she was intrigued.  Then, when we<br/>
started to fill in the Alternatives we ended up spending the whole day<br/>
thinking of all the fun things we like to do together.  This wheel has<br/>
really changed our lives!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was getting a bit too depressed with the recent threads, and was inspired<br/>
to have some fun.  I&#39;m new to the whole unschooling thing, so my<br/>
Alternatives seem a bit lackluster.  I&#39;m sure you old-timers will be able<br/>
to come up with some great ideas for this ;-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s how you play:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. When you and your child can&#39;t agree on what to do, then you<br/>
&gt;    must &quot;face the wheel&quot;.  (Other themes available)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Your child will spin the wheel, and you will both be required<br/>
&gt;    to participate in the outcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. We&#39;ll provide lots of options, but you can always fill in your<br/>
&gt;    own or use our template to print a custom wheel that will meet<br/>
&gt;    the needs of your unique family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some of the Delightful Alternatives we offer:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  - stay home and watch a movie together<br/>
&gt;  - go for a swim<br/>
&gt;  - eat some ice cream<br/>
&gt;  - play a game<br/>
&gt;  - go to the store and buy something fun for under $1<br/>
&gt;  - read a story together<br/>
&gt;  - invite over a friend<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;When my child first saw the wheel she was intrigued.  Then, when we<br/>
&gt; started to fill in the Alternatives we ended up spending the whole day<br/>
&gt; thinking of all the fun things we like to do together.  This wheel has<br/>
&gt; really changed our lives!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was getting a bit too depressed with the recent threads, and was<br/>
 </span></blockquote>inspired<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; to have some fun.  I&#39;m new to the whole unschooling thing, so my<br/>
&gt; Alternatives seem a bit lackluster.  I&#39;m sure you old-timers will be able<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693158693">I think your alternatives sound great, Barbara! My kids love an ice cream outing, and it seems someone always wants me to play a game with him.  We could add an outing to our favorite bookstore -- where they have great toys under a dollar, too -- or the children&#39;s museum.....a trip to the zoo.... or a run thru the fallen leaves.... or unlimited pushes on the tire swing.... bowling... a dollar movie.... making hot cocoa and popcorn together.... baking cookies together..... building the tallest lego tower... the list is endless when you think about ways to reward everyone by having fun together.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for sharing that idea.  It really did brighten what has been a strange and troubling day around here -- unfortunately, just the latest of several such days. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690222925">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I am new here. I am on a few other homeschool/unschool lists. You guys are <br/>
great! Really informative, and inspiring. I have a 2 year old son who is <br/>
going to be unschooled. We have yet to convey this idea to my in-laws who <br/>
are pretty much against every other parenting idea we have implemented <br/>
(co-sleeping, breastfeeding, gentle parenting, etc.). My mil thinks that <br/>
all children need &quot;training&quot;. She once said &quot;Children are god&#39;s way of <br/>
punishing you for enjoying sex.&quot; Any ideas about how to bring up the idea <br/>
without getting kicked out of the will? &lt;g&gt; I was thinking of <br/>
articles/statistics...any good ones? Books are too much - I need some <br/>
fairly quick come-backs. I was thinking of bringing up homeschooling first <br/>
and not even broaching the idea of unschooling until I see how it settles.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot!<br/>
<br/>
~Flora, Sean (dh) and Liam (ds)</div>

The ones whose minds are already made up probably aren&#39;t reachable, but you<br/>
probably reached some of the ones who haven&#39;t made up their minds. Maybe<br/>
next time you might want to include a link here or to UnschoolingDiscussion<br/>

 <br/>
Welcome.  I don&#39;t really have any helpful ideas -- my inlaws are still slow to warm up about homeschooling, and we don&#39;t even say unschool!<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you could just remind her that any distress caused by any of your alternative parenting choices is just &#39;punishment&#39; for her having enjoyed sex with your fil. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Or maybe they&#39;ll have other grandchildren and need less vicarious gratification from your child/ren.  <br/>
