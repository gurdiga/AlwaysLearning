a hurricane people would &quot;storm&quot; in and buy up all kinds of supplies, <br/>
including cases of Spam. He said it was funny, because most of the time the stuff <br/>
would sit there for weeks and months at a time, but if there was a storm, people <br/>
had to nave spam -- more than any other canned food.<br/>
<br/>
The funniest thing was once when they had two big storms within a couple of <br/>
weeks of one another. He saw the SAME people, who had come in to buy cases of <br/>
Spam only weeks before, coming in to buy cases more.<br/>

Well, they had lived through the first one, and maybe they thought it was the <br/>
Spam that did it.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t mind Spam if it&#39;s fried or cooked into something, but my kids <br/>
have no interest, and that&#39;s probably very healthy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890714234">Spam....... ah, soon we&#39;ll be off to the land of Spam.  Did you know they buy/eat more Spam per person than anywhere else -- in Hawaii?!  Yes, while living in Paradise, where you can get fresh papaya and white (sweet) pineapple for breakfast, the locals love Spam!<br/>
 <br/>
It is hugely popular there. Personally, I don&#39;t eat spam -- just can&#39;t get past the smell.  That, and I don&#39;t eat meat that&#39;s been stored in a can!  Anyway, I&#39;m told (my husband, Gary, is from Hawaii) that the reason it&#39;s so popular there is that, being an island, for many years it was difficult and expensive to get meat there -- even local beef was costly.  During the war years (while my inlaws were growing up on the islands) Spam was widely available in gov&#39;t shipments, so lotsa folks in Hawaii became very familiar with it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Whenever we&#39;re there, Gary really enjoys the spam musubi -- a ball of rice smashed together with spam inside -- mostly because he never gets it at home!  I won&#39;t even come close enough to the stuff to buy or cook it.  So far, Andy (who won&#39;t eat meat) has refused spam, but I fear that Dan (who eats everything, especially if his Daddy is having some) will come to love spam and I&#39;ll have two clamoring for it.  Will had a brief thing for spam, but poor thing was forced to cook it himself and only when I wasn&#39;t home.  LOL  Wonder if he eats it now that he&#39;s on his own? <br/>
 <br/>
just random thoughts as I began my mental packing for summer at the inlaws.......  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331495673">No, it&#39;s summer at my inlaws&#39; house -- it just happens to be in Hawaii.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sure, we&#39;ll get fresh papayas for breakfast, shave ice, and nightly trips to the beach for the boys, but we&#39;ll also have crushing humidity, more shades of green than this desert rat can process (I&#39;m with Sandra --some places just have too many trees!) and nearly constant remarks that force me to bite my tongue and smile sweetly.  Stuff like.... how is Andy doing in his lessons?  What does he read? Does he do Math? Does he have friends?  What are his regular chores at your house, and what chores would he like here?  Wouldn&#39;t you like for Daniel to sleep somewhere other than your bed? Doesn&#39;t Dan bite when he nurses?  Doesn&#39;t Andy ever eat vegies or meat?   Daniel doesn&#39;t drink regular milk? And virtually all my replies are met with, &quot;oh....&quot; and a look that says she can&#39;t even begin to understand us and our choices. <br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, 4 weeks under the scrutiny of the eternally uconvinced grandparents, and the other family members there who just don&#39;t get me, who just don&#39;t understand why I &#39;let&#39; my kids stay up late, eat what they want, wear what they want, and pretty much do what they want.  <br/>
 <br/>
don&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m cranky...... we had an eventful night..... I bumped Andy in the mouth, making his very loose tooth bleed, but NOT fall out.... the dog got trapped in what we thought was an inaccessible spot, and woke us up to free her -- at 4AM -- as dh was heading for the shower to leave for work..... the boys (and I) never went back to bed, and now I have to go out to the store for Jello, because Andy can&#39;t eat and refuses to pull that darned tooth, and given my mood, I think I&#39;m PMS&#39;ing (never know when to expect that anymore)........  At least it&#39;s finally Friday<br/>

Thank you -- yes I&#39;d be thrilled to look up some unschoolers there.  We&#39;re there a month, most of our time in Hilo, but with some side trips. I&#39;m sure we could get out for a visit or two with some other kindred souls.  I&#39;m guessing that by day 3, I&#39;ll be desparate to hang out with folks who won&#39;t cringe when my kids&#39; hair isn&#39;t combed and I nurse the 2yo in public.
