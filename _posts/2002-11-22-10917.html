<div id="ygrps-yiv-60939688">,&lt;&lt;So anyone that is nice to your kids and raves about how cute they are is<br/>
automatically suspicious?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

I would have said the same thing back when all my kids were anglo, but now<br/>
that not all of them are, I know exactly what Joylyn is talking about.<br/>
People fumbling all over themselves, gushing, &quot;some of my best friends<br/>
are....&quot;, you know.  It really is different.  The radar goes way up.<br/>
<br/>
Some prejudices are so deeply ingrained, particularly in language, that I<br/>
catch myself.  &quot;Nigger-rigged&quot; is a common term here for something that is<br/>
put together is &quot;bailing wire and spit&quot;.  I was grown and married before it<br/>
dawned on me what I was saying about Black people when I used that term and<br/>
trust me, nobody that knows me would think of me as prejudiced.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a clue if Tuck is prejudiced, I don&#39;t think we can ever know a<br/>
person&#39;s heart.  What I do know is that when I read her statement about<br/>
cultural differences, I thought &quot;I wonder why she thinks its a cultural<br/>
thing rather than a personal thing.&quot;<br/>
