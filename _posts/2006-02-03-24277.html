<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938687372">We have a king bed.  Sometimes Sorscha sleeps with us in the bed, but most<br/>
often she sleeps in her &quot;special&quot; bed.  She gets too hot with us.<br/>
<br/>
Her &quot;special&quot; bed is on the floor next to ours.  She has a cushy egg-crate<br/>
thingy all wrapped with sheets, etc.  Since it is winter, she has a heating<br/>
blanket too.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who always ask us, &quot;when do you guys (my husband and I) get<br/>
to do it.&quot;  This always makes me laugh.  It is like the only place to do it<br/>
is in the traditional big, bed in the traditional master (parent only)<br/>
bedroom.  heehee<br/>
