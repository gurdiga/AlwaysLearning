<div id="ygrps-yiv-845798262">Though it wasn’t intended, I’ve created a sort of “Best of” Just Add Light, which you can see by going to this blog and scrolling back a couple of years. :-)  (that’s not very much, for this blog—I only post maybe once or twice a month in general)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A few years back, I started adding a link to a Just Add Light post and its photo.  So each time I have three pages ready to announce, I go through recent posts and pick one I think is one of the best of the past week or two.  <br/>
<br/>
The blog itself announces pages new to my site, or pages with additions people might want to catch if they’ve read the page before.  <br/>
<br/>
None of the newer pages (“newer” meaning seven or eight years) is in the randomizer at my site, but this blog has a randomizer.  I have a batch I’m still (slowly) working up to add altogether, but randomness is fairly easy to come by, either at the blog above or at<br/>

<br/>
If you get bored, explore and discover new ideas to fortify your mind and soul for unschooling joy.  If you see a great quote somewhere, and you know it’s not in Just Add Light (which you could discover by searching for a distinctive phrase), maybe send it to me to include.  Positive quotes are better than negative, naturally, for a cheery daily blog post. :-)  But I know there are hundreds of good bits that haven’t made it to Just Add Light and Stir yet.<br/>

(If you’ve subscribed, clicking the title of any post in the e-mail will get you to that blog, and there’s a randomizer there, too)<br/>
