<br/>
this is from the &#39;Principles and Purposes&#39; page - <br/>
<br/>
We, the member congregations of the Unitarian<br/>
Universalist Association, covenant to affirm and<br/>
promote <br/>
<br/>
The inherent worth and dignity of every person; <br/>
<br/>
Justice, equity and compassion in human relations; <br/>
<br/>
Acceptance of one another and encouragement to<br/>
spiritual growth in our congregations; <br/>
<br/>
A free and responsible search for truth and meaning; <br/>
<br/>
The right of conscience and the use of the democratic <br/>
process within our congregations and in society at<br/>
large; <br/>
<br/>
The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and<br/>
justice for all; <br/>
<br/>
Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of<br/>
which we are a part. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The living tradition which we share draws from many<br/>
sources: <br/>
<br/>
Direct experience of that transcending mystery and<br/>
wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a<br/>
renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces<br/>
which create and uphold life; <br/>
<br/>
Words and deeds of prophetic women and men which<br/>
challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil<br/>
with justice, compassion, and the transforming power<br/>
of love; <br/>
<br/>
Wisdom from the world&#39;s religions which inspires us in<br/>
our ethical and spiritual life; <br/>
<br/>
Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to<br/>
respond to God&#39;s love by loving our neighbors as<br/>
ourselves; <br/>
<br/>
Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the<br/>
guidance of reason and the results of science, and<br/>
warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit. <br/>
<br/>
Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which<br/>
celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to<br/>
live in harmony with the rhythms of nature. <br/>
<br/>
Grateful for the religious pluralism which enriches<br/>
and ennobles our faith, we are inspired to deepen our<br/>
understanding and expand our vision. As free<br/>
congregations we enter into this covenant, promising<br/>
to one another our mutual trust and support. <br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
