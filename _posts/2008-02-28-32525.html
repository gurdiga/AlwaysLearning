<div id="ygrps-yiv-73151757">I received this by e-mail yesterday, in response to my explanation of  <br/>
why a post had been returned.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nice power trip Sandra. I don&#39;t agree with your viewpoints. I feel  <br/>
so sorry for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This list has had 613 posts this month.  In the past seven days, 404  <br/>
of those.  There might be more before I finish composing this.<br/>
<br/>
I think probably only a dozen posts have been returned lately and  <br/>
most of those clearly spam.   Three or four were &quot;Sorry, this is  <br/>
inappropriate.&quot;  I missed the &quot;flame war&quot; one or that would&#39;ve made  <br/>
it four or five.<br/>
<br/>
I have some commentary on the sentiments expressed:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nice power trip Sandra.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH YES!   My life revolves around the hope of sending a post back,  <br/>
y&#39;think?   Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing to help unschoolers this  <br/>
week:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
Several others have also helped lots of people (I quoted some of the  <br/>
best of them).   A few people have just bitched and whined.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t agree with your viewpoints.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay.   I have no hesitations about my viewpoints.  I would unschool  <br/>
if every other person on the planet put their kids in school  <br/>
tomorrow.  I don&#39;t need people to agree with me to feel whole and  <br/>
right.  Apparently some people&#39;s mental health hinges on whether a  <br/>
post goes through to a list or not.  I suppose there must be a few  <br/>
million Yahoo groups by now.  There are others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I feel so sorry for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that&#39;s intended to wound or intimidate or manipulate me.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight people are coming over to my house eat and play a board game  <br/>
(or play with the game board and cards, anyway) and discuss the  <br/>
Crusades, 11th century to the 16th, or so.   People are bringing  <br/>
stories.  I have books out.  Holly and I have shopped and cooked.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly will be in on this discussion.  There will be ten or  <br/>
twelve people altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Later or tomorrow Holly and I are going to finish a Roman costume for  <br/>
her because Friday night she&#39;s going to a history of Italy party.  I  <br/>
have two good gold-plated  brooches someone gave me years ago and she  <br/>
can drive herself to the party, about fifteen miles from here.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t go with her because Friday I&#39;ll be in Arizona to speak at a  <br/>
conference the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
So given that this is the life someone has said she feels sorry for  <br/>
me about, picture these moments if you will:<br/>
<br/>
People are at my house, my food is out in one room and my game and  <br/>
books are out in another room.  I say &quot;Please don&#39;t throw the food at  <br/>
the ceiling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The response might be &quot;Nice power trip Sandra. I don&#39;t agree with  <br/>
your viewpoints. I feel so sorry for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m helping Holly get ready for a party and advising her on some food  <br/>
she might take.<br/>
&quot;&quot;Nice power trip, mom. I don&#39;t agree with your viewpoints. I feel so  <br/>
sorry for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having people over tomorrow night to watch Lost.  I don&#39;t know  <br/>
all of them well and one hauls out drugs.  I might say &quot;Don&#39;t smoke  <br/>
dope in my house,&quot; and they  might say<br/>
&quot;&quot;Nice power trip Sandra. I don&#39;t agree with your viewpoints. I feel  <br/>
so sorry for you.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not happening, for several reasons.  First and foremost,  <br/>
it&#39;s my house.  But more than that, I don&#39;t HAVE friends who are  <br/>
destructive or rude or who would use drugs without asking.<br/>
<br/>
Yet it happens on this list.  And I&#39;m presuming that all those on  <br/>
this list are the parents of children, and I have good reason to  <br/>
assume that those parents are involved in or claiming or imagining  <br/>
that they&#39;re trying to become more mindful parents, or better  <br/>
unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
Add this to the checklist, then:  Avoid acting like a Jr. High School  <br/>
girl.  I&#39;ve already been to Jr. High, three  years, and I was good at  <br/>
the whole deal.   And then I taught Jr. High.  And I&#39;m through with  <br/>
Jr. High.  The next person who writes (with intent, not quoting or  <br/>
commenting) anything like<br/>
power trip<br/>
flame war<br/>
hag<br/>
bat<br/>
will not be on the list, unless it happens this weekend when I&#39;m in  <br/>
Arizona.   You might need to wait a day or two to be thrown off the  <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
I have the power to cut the list down from 1626 members to 1625, JUST  <br/>
LIKE THAT!!!  I am so powerful.  Bwa-ha-haaaaaa.<br/>
