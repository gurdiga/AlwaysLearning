<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677741042">Shane is a pretty much thrilled his interview got so much attention.<br/>
He is going to try and get an interview from the other side but my<br/>
husband doesn&#39;t think the studios will talk to him. I think he&#39;s<br/>
planning on walking the picket line with the strikers tomorrow<br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on livejournal called him an &quot;alleged 15 year old&quot; I guess<br/>
that was meant as a complement ...<br/>
