<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965528204">Hi! I mostly lurk here (and love it) but I have to jump in about<br/>
sharing tv. My boys<br/>
are 6 and 3 and we just got a game cube 2 weeks ago. At first the whole<br/>
sharing thing<br/>
was driving me batty. But I decided that it was a sharing issue, not a<br/>
game cube issue<br/>
(like you). So I went back and re-read Siblings without Rivalry (great<br/>
book!)<br/>
<br/>
They suggested taking yourself out of the argument by letting the kids<br/>
decide between<br/>
them. Since my kids are only 6 and 3, I have found that it helps if I<br/>
stay there<br/>
to help them walk through the discussion, BUT I do NOT make the decision<br/>
for them.<br/>
What I have been doing is stating what I see (I see 2 boys who both want<br/>
to play the<br/>
game cube) and asking them how they want to work it out. Sometimes they<br/>
say they<br/>
don&#39;t know, so I will help them out by saying, well, Jason is worried<br/>
that he will<br/>
never get a turn if Kyle starts playing...Kyle when will you let Jason<br/>
have a turn?<br/>
And go from there until they come up with something that works.<br/>
But the ultimate deal making is left to themselves. I also explain that<br/>
I am not<br/>
going to decide who gets to go, because I can&#39;t choose between them...if<br/>
I do then<br/>
one will be happy and one will be unhappy. But if they decide between<br/>
themselves<br/>
then they both will be happy (or it is not a good solution and they need<br/>
to keep<br/>
trying!)<br/>
<br/>
I have been absolutely AMAZED at how well this has worked! I never<br/>
thought I would<br/>
see Jason (my 6 yo) *let* Kyle go first, but that is often how they work<br/>
it out. <br/>
It has helped in that Jason has learned that Kyle often wants to play<br/>
for a couple<br/>
of minutes and then will ask Jason to help. Also, since Jason has been<br/>
getting better<br/>
at letting Kyle play some, Kyle is not as possessive about his time on<br/>
the game cube<br/>
and is more likely to give the controller to Jason! And I have started<br/>
hearing them<br/>
work their problems out more rather then just grabbing the controller.<br/>
Not perfect<br/>
but a heck of a lot better then before!<br/>
<br/>
What I really like about it is that I no longer have to figure out what<br/>
is &quot;fair&quot;.<br/>
Because really, there is no &quot;fair&quot; in this situation...they both have an<br/>
equally fair<br/>
need to play their games as long as they want. By removing myself from<br/>
the decision<br/>
making process, I get to be more of a facilitator. I stay there to make<br/>
sure that<br/>
each boy gets heard (and help each of them put their feelings and<br/>
arguments into words).<br/>
I have used this approach with other things as well (including<br/>
disagreements with what<br/>
I want them to do) and it is amazing to watch it work. When I was<br/>
reading it, I <br/>
was a bit skeptical that it would work with my boys, but it has!<br/>
<br/>
That said, I would also get another tv LOL! We have 2 big tvs...one in<br/>
the family<br/>
room, one in the living room, both with tivo/direct tv. And we have 2<br/>
smaller ones<br/>
in my craft room and dh&#39;s office without direct tv. Makes tv life much<br/>
easier!<br/>
Not only with making sharing easier, but it has taken away the urgency<br/>
to want to<br/>
watch because either boy can watch whatever they want whenever they<br/>
want. <br/>
<br/>
I just read your second message...we do have the two tvs and believe it<br/>
or not, they<br/>
usually watch it together. We also have TIVO (digital recorder) and I<br/>
can&#39;t say<br/>
enough for it because it allows you to totally get away from the tv&#39;s<br/>
schedule! Basically<br/>
you can set it up to record all the shows you want and they are always<br/>
available. My<br/>
boys don&#39;t even know what times the shows are on...they just go into the<br/>
Now Showing<br/>
list and pick. They are also very selective about what shows they tape<br/>
which is cool<br/>
to see. I had many the same fears as you about running our life around<br/>
tv, but since<br/>
letting go of them, the tv has taken a less and less central role in our<br/>
life. It<br/>
is still there and on quite often, but we are doing lots of other things<br/>
as well.<br/>
Do you watch and enjoy shows with them? I have found if I am feeling<br/>
disconnected<br/>
from them, if I plop down on the couch with them we have some great<br/>
conversations<br/>
and we start getting into other things.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note...since getting the game cube my dh has been spending a<br/>
lot more time <br/>
playing with the boys. At first it bummed me out that it was &quot;only&quot;<br/>
playing computer<br/>
games with them (he doesn&#39;t like reading to them and tends to be too<br/>
competitive to<br/>
play board games and have fun with them). But they are working on this<br/>
one game<br/>
(Starfox Adventures) together and it is so neat to watch. Planning<br/>
strategies, looking<br/>
up cheats together...and then the other night while they were playing it<br/>
turned out<br/>
into an all out wrestle match (a fun one) in our living room...so by<br/>
spending time<br/>
playing computer games, my dh&#39;s relationship with the boys in improving!<br/>
They have<br/>
been more willing to ask him to help them with things (that they used to<br/>
only come to<br/>
me for). Not to mention that I get an hour after dinner to do my yoga.<br/>
So you might<br/>
really be surprised what will happen when you start enjoying what they<br/>
enjoy. I<br/>
may not personally think that the games they play or all the shows they<br/>
watch are fun<br/>
(although many of them are!) but watching them enjoy themselves helps me<br/>
enjoy it too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that this helps! Sorry that this got so long...<br/>
