<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228000818">.  The first question is &quot;How different are the<br/>
Perrys from the Osbournes?&quot;  Answer?  &quot;Ozzy goes on the road and the kids<br/>
stay home.  We all go.  We home-school our kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cool....I think.  I am thinking Ozzy is probably better off not <br/>
homeschooling his kids :)<br/>
I remember a conversation (was it here) some months ago about someone <br/>
watching the Osbournes show.  The usual weirdness was going on and the kids <br/>
were mad about being freaks on tv and getting teased at school....Ozzy said <br/>
something about homeschooling them.<br/>
The poster of this information said something about how she would have loved <br/>
to see an HSLDA leader watching that (ice tea spew for sure!)<br/>
That image has stayed with me!! Too funny.<br/>
