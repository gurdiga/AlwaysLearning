<div id="ygrps-yiv-464826439">We have lots of interesting news here, some of which is very frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
First, though, I had a delightful birthday yesterday. My partner Beth took <br/>
the day off work, we went to a Paint your own ceramics place, then lunch, <br/>
then saw Chicago (the movie...not the city or rock group.) I got lots of <br/>
presents.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we came home, and Julian&#39;s dad, Perry, came by. He and his wife have <br/>
decided to get a divorce (their saga is long and icky, and I won&#39;t go into it <br/>
here now... we&#39;ve covered that!). Well, Perry&#39;s mother, Alice, LOVES Elanah, <br/>
the wife, and has never approved of anything Perry has done except marrying <br/>
this woman who treats him very badly. So she was furious, and sure it was all <br/>
Perry&#39;s fault.<br/>
<br/>
THEN Alice (a retired teacher) tells him she was talking to a family friend, <br/>
who WAS Perry&#39;s principal in elementary school and is now a School <br/>
Superintendent in Massachusetts. (Turns out in the next town over from us.)  <br/>
He told her homeschoolers have to be tested every year, &quot;just like everyone <br/>
else.&quot;  It&#39;s NOT true.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite part was where she told Perry that he&#39;s already messed up HIS <br/>
life, but Julian still has a chance.  (Perry is a nurse, travels a lot, has a <br/>
spectacular son that he spends LOTS of time with, owns a house, etc....)  <br/>
Alice is an evil bitch.<br/>
<br/>
sigh....thanks for listening (or at least letting me type.)<br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t it true that in Mass. the superintendent has a lot of power to<br/>
make his own rules, like to &quot;approve&quot; or &quot;disapprove&quot; of homeschooling? <br/>
You could just inform your x-mil that in MA, every district has<br/>
different rules.  (That should undercut her phony expertise.)<br/>

<br/>
This is a perfect illustration of Sandra&#39;s concept that if a parent<br/>
defines success for their child very narrowly, then their children will<br/>
most likely fail to meet their standards.  So, let&#39;s all of us define<br/>
success broadly.<br/>
