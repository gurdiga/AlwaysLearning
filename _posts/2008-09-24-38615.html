<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397316457">I found this quote, and I&#39;ll tell you where in a minute:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unschooling causes me to rejoice because I have the sensation that  <br/>
we&#39;re running toward what is new, moving toward the future and all of  <br/>
the discoveries it will bring with joy and expectation rather than  <br/>
with fear. Meanwhile, we&#39;re examining the past, seeing and hearing  <br/>
and experiencing what already exists in the world with our hearts  <br/>
ready to learn. All the time, we&#39;re living in the present, not  <br/>
fearful, ready to learn. It makes me excited!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Sally Lopez, who&#39;s on this list, writing about &quot;The Influence of  <br/>
Art on Artists&quot; here:<br/>

I like that paragraph a lot, the tension (good tension) between  <br/>
embracing the future while examining the past, and being fearlessly  <br/>
right here right now.<br/>
