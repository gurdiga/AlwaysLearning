<div id="ygrps-yiv-697108152">Well, if your mother isn&#39;t open to switching drs then did she try to <br/>
up the dosage as he suggested? If she trusts him so much then why <br/>
isn&#39;t she currently following his advise? Some of the things your <br/>
describing to me like &quot;excessive worry&quot; sounds like it may be in the <br/>
anxiety spectrum and may better be treated by a drug like Paxil or <br/>
Zoloft. Also how about her age - is she getting close to menopause? <br/>
That may also place a harmone imbalance on a person that can result <br/>
in depression. You are being a good daughter by asking for advise on <br/>
helping your mother but when it becomes so taxing on you and your <br/>
daughter that you are feeling overwhelming anxiety then it is time <br/>
to demand that she do something other than just talk. Sure talking <br/>
helps and you don&#39;t want to stop talking to her but obviously there <br/>
is a point where you need to take therapy to a higher level - call <br/>
in the big guns so to speak. Also see if you can find a reputable <br/>
psychologist for her to have a conference with, no strings, if she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like him she doesn&#39;t have to tell him anything. I was not <br/>
comfortable talking to my primary physician about my problems but I <br/>
was lucky enough to find a great psychologist that will listen to <br/>
whatever I feel I need to share with him, I never in my life guessed <br/>
I would see a psyc but it has really changed my life for the better. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265368925">She has upped the prozac, and is taking Xanax - which probably isn&#39;t <br/>
working since she&#39;s been on it a long time as well.  The doctor may <br/>
wean her from the Xanac, presumably to try something else.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m at the point of feeling overwhelming anxiety, <br/>
(at least not most of the time) but I will definitly &quot;lay down the <br/>
law&quot; if and when that time comes.  <br/>
<br/>
She did go to a consult with a therapist of some kind, and then <br/>
didn&#39;t make the appointment for a follow up.  That&#39;s when she made <br/>
the comment that I was more helpful to her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot for your ideas.  Everyone has been giving such wonderful <br/>
advice, and it&#39;s helped ME to get it off my chest, and to look at it <br/>
with fresh eyes.<br/>

<br/>
  ****I took xanax for several months because they thought I was having anxiety attacks. When I tried to stop it I had serious withdrawals, we had to do it very slowly until I got down to just a tiny piece of the pill. Please be very careful weaning off that drug, it is so addictive to our bodies, I will never take anything like that again. I don&#39;t really have much experience with clinical depression myself but my mom has it and is on the right meds and she is wonderful as long as she takes them.<br/>

working. I have a friend in that situation. He was on something that worked <br/>
well for years, then it stopped working. He&#39;s been several years now trying <br/>
different meds, weaning off them, and trying new ones. So far nothing has <br/>
worked for long.<br/>
