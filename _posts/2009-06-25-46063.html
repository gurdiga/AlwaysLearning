<div id="ygrps-yiv-727237578">On YouTube, a new comment under the little video of Holly:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been schooled my whole life but I can still think for myself and  <br/>
learn what interests me in my own time outside of school. Just because  <br/>
you&#39;re in a school setting doesn&#39;t eliminate your ability to be an  <br/>
individual. Plus, by &quot;falling into line&quot; for the first 20 or so years  <br/>
of your life you&#39;re set up for big monies and easy living﻿ in the  <br/>
long run.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that person is past those &quot;first 20 or so years&quot; or  <br/>
not (profile says 21, but profiles say lots of things).<br/>
What I know about Holly is that at 17 she turns down jobs and has  <br/>
$1800 in the bank.   I&#39;ve been watching Annie lately as background  <br/>
noise, and reading &quot;big monies and easy living&quot; totally brought images  <br/>
of Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters and Carol Burnett singing and dancing  <br/>
&quot;Easy Street.&quot;<br/>

And the first comment under one of mine keeps making little rattly  <br/>
noises in my head even weeks later.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking about &quot;the universe inside your head&quot; and someone wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;very﻿ interest idea .. i like the parsed reality.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;i think it could be a mode of thinking if refined.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it was a positive comment, and the courtesy in such cases is  <br/>
to smile wanly and accept the vague compliment.  I&#39;m curious about  <br/>
what sorts of modes of thinking need to be refined, and who would run  <br/>
the refinery and how the refined mode of thinking would then be  <br/>
distributed for use by thinkers everywhere.<br/>

This sounds incredibly naïve.   This is the comment of someone who is on the<br/>
treadmill and wont realize the school, good job, easy retirement myth is<br/>
just a myth until his 401K runs out before he is done living.  He obviously<br/>
has not figured out that the majority of the people in this country who look<br/>
like they are wealthy are really in debt up to their eyeballs with a<br/>
negative net worth.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would like to know where my big monies and easy living went.  I fell<br/>
into line long enough to get a masters degree, and the highest paying job I<br/>
have ever had in my life was $36K.  That is about my income cap.  I will<br/>
never earn much more than that.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Big monies and easy living come to those who make themselves stand out in<br/>
some way.  Falling into line only prepares you to work for those with money.<br/>
It is the choices we make that determine our lives.  I hope my children will<br/>
always be active decision makers rather than living in default mode.  If<br/>
big monies and easy living happen to come their way as a result of the<br/>
choices theyve made, then fine.  However, that is not the goal.  I would<br/>
rather they are able to be happy with who they are no matter what<br/>
circumstances they find themselves in due to the choices they have made.<br/>
<br/>

Happy with or without money is what I want for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Just as every test and contest in school has a winner or two or three  <br/>
and a WHOLE bunch of kids who did not &quot;get an A,&quot; same with the end of  <br/>
any part of the treadmill of school-to-career.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wonder how falling in line helps someone be an individual!  I don&#39;t<br/>
even think falling in line helps set someone up for &quot;big monies and easy<br/>
living&quot;.  The only people that I&#39;ve known that have &quot;big monies and easy<br/>
living&quot; had really generous and wealthy parents.  Someone worked very<br/>
hard to earn that &quot;big monies and easy living&quot; to pass on to the next<br/>
generation.  Just look at Paris Hilton, the Hilton family started off<br/>
with a B and B, and the man who started the hotel chain, did all the<br/>
duties a bell boy would do, carry luggage to and from the train to the B<br/>
and B that his parents owned.  He worked HARD for years and took a<br/>
gamble at expanding and it worked.  I doubt very much that he &quot;fell in<br/>
line&quot; to get that hotel empire up and going!<br/>
<br/>
Every person that has been successful like that has NOT been a person<br/>
that has fallen in line!  Perhaps, one day, that person will realize<br/>
what I lie they&#39;ve been told!  I went to school for 17 yrs and I don&#39;t<br/>
have &quot;big monies and easy living&quot;.  I have small monies and happy<br/>
living.  Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m shy of the 20 yrs mark that this<br/>
person suggested.  Ahhh if only I&#39;d stuck it out for another 3 more<br/>
yrs... but I&#39;m thinking I&#39;d still be a stay at home mom, and my student<br/>
loans would just be bigger.  I have friends that pay out over a thousand<br/>
dollars a month for student loans.  That would be more like &quot;big monies<br/>
and hard living&quot; to me!</div>
