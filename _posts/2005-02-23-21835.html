<div id="ygrps-yiv-500315297">My husband sent this from work.  He should work. &lt;g&gt;  (He  might think I <br/>
should be making bread or mopping a floor or something, I  guess.)   It has photos <br/>
of origami made with money, and is pretty  cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379816175">Is anyone in the Birmingham area?  We are taking a family trip there<br/>
to visit my parents & to help my Grandma celebrate her 99th birthday<br/>
next month (March 18-30).  I&#39;m thinking it might be nice (and a sanity<br/>
saver) if we had a homeschool park group to visit.  We did visit with<br/>
a group last time we were there but I don&#39;t remember who/where/when! <br/>
My children are ages 9 (ds & pokemon lover) & 6 (dd).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
