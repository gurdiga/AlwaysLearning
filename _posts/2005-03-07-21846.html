<div id="ygrps-yiv-719510087">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I sat down yesterday morning and had the need to bleed.   Bleed out <br/>
some thoughts not wholly formed in my head, that is.  What came out <br/>
in words was not what I was expecting at all.  After a couple years <br/>
of homeschooling/unschooling I didn&#39;t even realized I was embracing <br/>
it as much for myself as for my children.  I hadn&#39;t really taken <br/>
time to analyze my own school situation in detail.  Bluck! Who wants <br/>
to do that?<br/>
<br/>
After writing my thoughts and considering the profundity of the <br/>
words (ok, at least they were profound to me), I just _had_ to share <br/>
them with someone.  So, I hope you don&#39;t mind and hope that it might <br/>
resonate with other&#39;s experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
-Dana<br/>
<br/>
The Invisible Authority<br/>
<br/>
As a child I was always trying to please the adults in my life.  <br/>
Probably the thing that school educated me in the most was pleasing <br/>
others for pleasing&#39;s sake.   With worksheet after worksheet of <br/>
questions, grades and tests I was in a perpetual pleasing fest.  <br/>
Never did it occur to me that this was not desirable. Certainly, the <br/>
teachers gave me ample positive feedback when I was the proper <br/>
soldier marching to their beat.  Any interest I had separate from my <br/>
teachers would be deemed not worthy, especially if it wasn&#39;t tested <br/>
and graded, so I became dependent on the system to assign me my <br/>
interests not to mention level of self worth.  The damage this has <br/>
done to me as a grown adult is difficult to calculate.  I wonder <br/>
what kind of person I would be today if I had developed my own <br/>
interests along the way untainted by school bias.<br/>
<br/>
With all the years of pleasing and meeting other&#39;s expectations I <br/>
believe that I was so accustomed to it that I was not comfortable <br/>
without the external pressures of school.  I was kind of lost <br/>
without someone to give me my marching orders.  After finishing my <br/>
schooling I tried staying in my comfort level by spending my time <br/>
trying to meet some kind of invisible expectation set by some <br/>
invisible authority.  This was completely subconscious of course.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling philosophy has given me a new perspective and, for <br/>
the first time in my life, I have the &quot;invisible authority&quot; to <br/>
pursue what interests me and go about it in a way that is free from <br/>
expectation and, for lack of better words, accomplished in a joyful <br/>
manner.  I need this &quot;authority&quot;, you see; I am still crippled from <br/>
the system I grew up under.  If it weren&#39;t for my parents turning a <br/>
blind eye to our performance in school and never having any ambition <br/>
for us (I can&#39;t remember a single time they asked to see my report <br/>
card), I might have permanently been in limbo with no self esteem to <br/>
speak of.  Still, with the large influence on me from 16 years of <br/>
school, I have spent a fair amount of my adulthood becoming <br/>
acquainted with who I really am.  This is really a shame if you <br/>
think about it; all my teachers who cared so much, yet managed to <br/>
suffocate and cripple me to the point where I had to be away from <br/>
the school system for more than a decade to repair the effects.  <br/>
Even then, I was not really seeing how much better things could be <br/>
before I was introduced to the concepts of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine what gift we are handing our children by allowing <br/>
them to get on with the business of self discovery and not putting <br/>
their lives on hold for some other &quot;authority&quot;.</div>

<br/>
I enjoyed reading your thoughts Dana.  I think we are giving our children a<br/>
huge gift by letting them grow up minus that lesson of learning to conform<br/>
just to make other people happy.  It has been interesting already to see it<br/>
play out in my young children&#39;s lives (they are 8 and 10 and always<br/>
unschooled) and I know that as they grow older it will continue to be<br/>
interesting to see how this freedom affects their lives.  I suspect that<br/>
they will already know themselves when they reach young adulthood and they<br/>
won&#39;t have to spend the next ten years figuring out who they are and how to<br/>
be true to themselves.  <br/>

It might be bigger than you imagine now, just as unschooling was bigger  than <br/>
you imagined.  But it might be just as big as a plain, happy  life.  <br/>

 <br/>
Freud talks about this.  He was in a rules-bound, schoolified culture,  and <br/>
within a more intellectual part of even that (meaning MORE school, MORE book  <br/>
worship).  He called that thing you&#39;re talking about &quot;the super-ego,&quot; the  part <br/>
of a mind that develops to control the rest of it.  The super-ego is  built <br/>
of the messages you&#39;ve received from others and the way to go along to get  <br/>
along in &quot;civilized culture&quot; is to have a well developed super-ego which will  <br/>
keep you from bad behavior or selfishness.  (That&#39;s my own summary, and  could <br/>
be tweaked or picked at by psychologists and psychiatrists, but that&#39;s  okay.)<br/>
 <br/>
If we want to change paths or beliefs, we have to wrestle with that  <br/>
super-ego and remodel it.  That&#39;s why unschooling is SO much more difficult  than <br/>
school-at-home with a curriculum.  That&#39;s just a private school, our  super-ego <br/>
says; that&#39;s a better student-teacher ratio, our super-ego says.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
&quot;Accomplished in a joyful manner&quot; could be worded &quot;lived in joy.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Accomplished&quot; might be something you leave by the side of the wagontrail  to <br/>
cross the mountains.  You can accomplish more, as regards unschooling,  by <br/>
not wanting to &quot;accomplish.&quot;   And at this point doesn&#39;t it sound  like a <br/>
spiritual message rather than a practical one?<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s practically necessary to change one&#39;s spiritual stance to live  <br/>
unschooling at its best.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but my super-ego was built of a lot of  <br/>
Baptist parts, and a lot of lower-class negative messages about not getting  <br/>
above yourself and all.  So if I want to believe that my children are whole  and <br/>
good, I need to negotiate this point with Miss Musick, my Sunday School  <br/>
teacher who reminds me still (dead though she&#39;s been since the 1970&#39;s or so)  that <br/>
children are born sinful and have to become good by obedience to Jesus as  <br/>
interpretted by that little brick building in northern New Mexico.  And  she&#39;s not <br/>
the only one in there.  But I&#39;ve worked at it, little by little  and fairly <br/>
constantly, to gain confidence in my own beliefs and not to ask for  approval <br/>
from the voices in my head.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
They meant to strengthen and toughen and mold and empower you.<br/>
All the justifications for that were in their own mental authority figures,  <br/>
in their own super-ego, and they felt they had accomplished something and  <br/>
succeeded when you bent to the system and &quot;succeeded.&quot;   It&#39;s not  worth being <br/>
angry with them.  Maybe you can heal your mental images of them  a bit too, as <br/>
your children live in their joyful freedom.    What  if your most uptight <br/>
teacher had had a happier childhood without so much  parental shaming, no <br/>
spankings, no belief that she was a vile sinner from  birth?  Maybe you can lend a <br/>
little pool of healing to the memory of her,  and all those in your super-ego.<br/>
 <br/>
What if my grandmother had been able to sleep late and daydream  sometimes <br/>
instead of getting up at the crack of dawn and working HARD on a ranch  with six <br/>
younger siblings for nothing, to the point that she would marry  the first <br/>
person who walked by and would get her out of there?   I  lend her some sympathy <br/>
and good wishes, though she&#39;s as dead as Miss  Musick.<br/>

<br/>
I was raised Catholic, so the ego self in me has some of those same<br/>
indoctrinated religious connotations in there. In more ways than just<br/>
words. As a child in Catholic school if you did not agree and submit<br/>
to their way of thinking, you were often times beaten. Back then,<br/>
there were no strict laws protecting children from that and what ones<br/>
there were, people were afraid to speak out against the church and the<br/>
school in particular that I went to.<br/>
<br/>
I for one, spent many years being beaten by being &quot;hit with a yard<br/>
stick&quot; on the knuckles and hair pulled etc.<br/>
<br/>
They knew no better, as you say as this is only what they knew. I am<br/>
grateful to the people who finally did stand up to the church and<br/>
school I was in by the time I turned 14, so that no other children had<br/>
to suffer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023794362">Yes, I will have to think about this one.  Here are my thoughts off the top<br/>
of my head. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess my real point in the previous message was that my parents did not<br/>
tag my self worth to my performance in school. I actually felt wholly<br/>
accepted by my parents, but there might have been a thread of blessing that<br/>
I needed with regards to my school work.   I think that it is probably more<br/>
accurate to say that there was a mismatch between what my parents valued and<br/>
what the school valued.  That mismatch, now that I&#39;m thinking about it,<br/>
might have left me more insecure as a person than I realize.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough though, when my mom and I speak as adults, I get a real sense<br/>
that she is the one person in my life that made it possible at all for me to<br/>
unschool.  Her disregard for school antics, such as issuing grades, I think<br/>
gave me the permission to dismiss it myself.  She fully supports my efforts<br/>
in unschooling. With sage-like assuredness, she makes comments like, &quot;You<br/>
can rest easy now and not worry a day more about your children.  They have<br/>
received such a firm foundation from you and are so secure in themselves<br/>
that, as long as you continue in the same vein, they need no more<br/>
intervention to grow up as whole and happy individuals.&quot;    The other thing<br/>
she says is, &quot;Children grow up like weeds.&quot;   I think she means by this,<br/>
that they are quite resilient and determined beings that will find their own<br/>
way through cracks in the concrete.  We can work to open up a crack for<br/>
them, but they just might find another crack that suite them better, and<br/>
make their way to the sunlight in spite of our efforts.  And, this is my<br/>
comment; I think our real job is to be there to celebrate when they emerge<br/>
however they emerge.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the observation.  My husband and I were actually discussing this<br/>
and he made a similar comment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just love exploring the psychology behind people&#39;s motives in life and<br/>
hearing other&#39;s viewpoints, so I welcome others comments.<br/>

on this art/academics charter school (which in comparison to most public<br/>

 <br/>
I still like schooly things.  We were at a baseball sign up at the  <br/>
elementary school cafeteria on Tuesday.  One of the teachers at the school  who is also <br/>
involved in baseball was working on some little cards for her class  the next <br/>
day.  So I was chatting with her in the teacher&#39;s lounge/work  room.  <br/>
 <br/>
You would NOT BELIEVE the cool equipment they have in teacher&#39;s  lounges <br/>
these days!  Giant laminating machines and a copier that will take  construction <br/>
paper and a die cut system that lets you make all the little fish  name tags <br/>
you want!  A row of paper cutters of every kind!  The old  inkie ditto machine <br/>
is a thing of the past!  <br/>
 <br/>
I had a great time helping her cut the cards after she ran them through the  <br/>
laminator.<br/>
 <br/>
But then, I always wanted to work at Kinko&#39;s, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127143428">There&#39;s a home laminating machine called the Xyron which will make<br/>
stickers as well as laminate.  It comes in several sizes - the largest<br/>
can do 8-1/2&quot; wide paper, I think.  There are home die cut machines from<br/>
Sizzix.  You can get dies for alphabet letters, shapes, gift tags...<br/>
Both can be found at Micheals/AC Moore/Joann&#39;s or other craft stores or<br/>
occasionally on home shopping channels.  In our area both Micheals and<br/>
ACMoore have 40% off coupons regularly and accept competitor coupons so<br/>
the cost can be cut considerably.  You don&#39;t have to think of them as<br/>
schooly - call them art supplies :-)  I use dies and stickers in my<br/>
scrapbooks.  Sometimes my kids draw badges/nametags and we make them<br/>
into stickers so they can wear them all day.  The last ones said &quot;I&#39;m a<br/>
fun kid!&quot;  Somewhat redundant since you can&#39;t be in their presence for<br/>
more than a couple minutes without realizing how fun they are, but they<br/>
enjoyed drawing and wearing them.<br/>

Its funny,  some of the kids I work with have no idea what we talk about <br/>
when we mention things like rotery phones and smelling the ditto machine <br/>
copies when your teacher passed them out.<br/>
Things like this, bifocals and boils have a way of making one feel old.<br/>

I didn&#39;t show any restraint then. I have the binder and would not live <br/>
without it now! I only have one xyron-the 8.5 x11 but LOVE it. My mom bought <br/>
the sizzic die cut and we take turns buying the dies. So far I&#39;ve used a <br/>
bunch and she cut out a word for one scrapbook page.<br/>

this might be my next toy!  My biggest problem with getting the die <br/>
cut machine is that I want the really big Ellison one with the <br/>
expensive dies ;-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265895846">Hey,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and have been reading up on some of the latest <br/>
posts.  I ran across this one and thought I&#39;d chime in.  <br/>
I love my Xyron sticker machine, and my kiddos do too when they can <br/>
pry it away from me-LOL-just joking!.  I just keep an extra cartrige <br/>
around just for rainy days.  I live in the Hickory, NC area and <br/>
there is a place for educators called the &quot;Creation Station&quot; and <br/>
anyone who educates can sign up and use their facility free (It is <br/>
funded by the State).  The have the super-duper dye cut machine and <br/>
over 200 dye cuts.  They also have laminating machines of all <br/>
sizes.  They have a play station for little kiddos that can&#39;t or <br/>
don&#39;t want to help.  We make an afternoon out of it sometimes.  If <br/>
you live in the area, you can email me offlist and I can give you <br/>
more information about what they offer all educators.<br/>
<br/>
PEACE, LOVE, HOPE, FAITH<br/>
PAULA<br/>
