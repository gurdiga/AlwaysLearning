<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Wow, I have  a recent experience with this very thing. I got an email from<br/>
&gt; Zack (my oldest, currently in PS, living with his conservative christian dad<br/>
&gt; and seciond family in GA.) He is fundraising for a program at their baptist<br/>
&gt; church for bibles to give to pakistanis in the area. He wanted me to donate<br/>
&gt; money. I told him I was very uncomfortable donating money to a cause like<br/>
&gt; that. He knows how I feel about proselityzing and also about the religion<br/>
&gt; his father and stepmother are forcing him to embrace (no I am not using too<br/>
&gt; strong a word they are extremely coercive parents) I felt terrible and as if<br/>
&gt; I was not supporting him in his endeavors but I finally decided that it was<br/>
&gt; much more important for him to see an example of someone who felt strongly<br/>
&gt; about their beliefs and stick to them. He understood. I also suggested to<br/>
&gt; him that if he felt strongly that passing out the bibles was important, he<br/>
&gt; should donate a portion of his allowance. I&#39;m not sure if he is going to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think we also have to be careful about cohersing ourselves.  There are <br/>
things I would not give my child money to do because they run counter to my <br/>
values. If he wanted to send money to...I don&#39;t know, Jerry Falwell, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it. I might offer suggestions about ways he could make extra <br/>
money to do so, but I would definitely tell him why I had a problem with it. <br/>
It&#39;s important to me to &quot;walk my talk,&quot; and important to me to model that to <br/>
Julian.<br/>
