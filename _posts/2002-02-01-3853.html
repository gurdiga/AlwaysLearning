&gt; We are fully addicted to that show, every once of us races to the tv when <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s one so we can guess what &#39;new&#39; ingredient will be unveiled and how the <br/>
&gt; chefs will prepare them..Then we try and fathom what they taste like (and <br/>
&gt; we end up with some gagging noises sometimes!!)..Matter of fact this has <br/>
&gt; sparked our newest &#39;idea&#39;..Once every other month we are going to <br/>
&gt; experiment with different types of foods, I think Japanese will be our <br/>
&gt; first since it&#39;s our &#39;inspiration&#39;..we&#39;re still working out the details but <br/>
&gt; we will either be attempting to cook a traditional meal or finding a <br/>
&gt; restaurant and experiencing a traditional meal :grin:..<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Since we bought the house I watch a LOT of HGTV. I like the decorating shows <br/>
that are funky, like the one where two families decorate each other&#39;s houses.<br/>
