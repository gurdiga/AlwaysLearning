<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008535053">Any Click and Clack (Car Talk) fans here? Well, I just finished reading their <br/>
(I think) latest book, In Our Humble Opinion : Car Talk&#39;s Click and Clack <br/>
Rant and Rave, and there&#39;s a great section on Education. The gist is that <br/>
education in this country, from early to late, is done badly. Tom says it <br/>
doesn&#39;t teach things that are useful, doesn&#39;t respect what the kid wants to <br/>
know, and doesn&#39;t consider learning motivation. He actually mentions a friend <br/>
who homeschools his kids as having the right idea. <br/>
<br/>
I think this guy needs to hear about unschooling.<br/>

useful!  Good car info.<br/>

&quot;There would be no greater joy than to see a beautiful park<br/>
that our children and adults can go to and learn about the<br/>
oil and gas industry.&quot;<br/>
