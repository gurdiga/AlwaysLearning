This is a story for all the people who ever asked us,&quot;What about math?&quot;,<br/>
or &quot;But how will she get a job?&quot; or said, &quot;You know, she can&#39;t just do<br/>
what she enjoys her whole life - someday she&#39;ll have to get a job.&quot; Well,<br/>
Rain turned 11 last month, and today she got a job. It pays minimum wage,<br/>
$6.75 an hour, and she&#39;ll worked 10 to 15 hours  week for the first month<br/>
and then 6 hours a week for the next 3 months. When she applied for the<br/>
job, she created a professional resume and was in competition with 30 or<br/>
more other people, for a total of 6 openings. Two people have been hired<br/>
so far, one of whom is Rain (the rest will be hired early next week). Not<br/>
that it really matters, but many of the applicants were adults. She was<br/>
one of the youngest to apply, if not the youngest.<br/>
<br/>
Rain will be working as an actress, playing one of the stepsisters in a<br/>
dinner theatre production of Cinderella. She had so much fun at the<br/>
audition that she was still walking on clouds an hour later, and the<br/>
stepsister is just a dream role for her. She would have done it for<br/>
free... but they&#39;re paying her for all rehearsals and shows, starting<br/>
from call time. The show rehearses for 4 weeks and then runs for 12<br/>
weeks, with two shows for school groups on Wednesdays and a show open to<br/>
the public on Saturdays.<br/>
<br/>
I may be biased, as her mother, but I thought she really stood out at the<br/>
audition. She was thinking, she was innovating, she was creating. She<br/>
remembered the basics - project, speak slowly and enunciate, stay in<br/>
character,don&#39;t block other actors  - while adding appropriate and funny<br/>
physical movements and hilarious expressions, interacting with the other<br/>
characters on stage, and saying her lines so they sounded fresh even<br/>
after 5 groups had run the same scene. I was and am very, very proud. <br/>

Sounds like you should be.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is the wonderful thing about homeschooling, unschooling in<br/>
particular is that you have the time, energy and support to follow your<br/>
passions.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane is 13 and working as an assistant coach at a local gymnastics gym.<br/>
She has talked about wanting to do this for several years and now she has<br/>
the chance.  She said, &quot;Just think mom.  I&#39;m only 13 and I&#39;m living my<br/>
dream.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>

And I should mention that she&#39;s been in 10 or so community theatre shows<br/>
already, where she had to audition to be cast, so she&#39;s definitely worked<br/>
at her craft and built her reputation, and she&#39;s not new to theatre -<br/>
