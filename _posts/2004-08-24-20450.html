<div id="ygrps-yiv-400354779">the best way that I can describe to someone who&#39;s curious what my family<br/>
does instead of school is to say that we live as though school doesn&#39;t<br/>
exist.  This is the reason that I don&#39;t even love to use the word &quot;unschool&quot;<br/>
<br/>
**Sounds like me. I gave up on using that term as an explanation years ago<br/>
and simply say &quot;my children don&#39;t go to school&quot; or that &quot;we live skool-free<br/>
lives&quot;. Thirteen years into this journey has left me with no tolerance for<br/>
anything schoolish...even the explanations.<br/>
<br/>
The qustions are resurfacing anew since the local (lousy) free parent<br/>
newspaper here in Columbus, Ohio has done a cover story on<br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot;...complete with only christian school-at-homers and H$LDA<br/>
quotes and stats. I cringe every time we&#39;re lumped into that category by yet<br/>
another well meaning but ignorant individual who thinks we&#39;re all the same.<br/>
Sigh,<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
