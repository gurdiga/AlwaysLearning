Our Mission<br/>

<br/>
Our Mission is not to entertain the children but to call them out. To <br/>
be always entertained is to be dwarfed and dependent. To be �called <br/>
out� is to follow the harmonious law of the soul�s unfoldment. Who <br/>
meddles with the rosebud? What fingers are deft enough to pry open that <br/>
marvel of folded beauty? We are wise enough to leave it alone to follow <br/>
the glad law of its own unfolding, but our children! Have we dealt as <br/>
wisely with these buds of marvelous possibilities? Have we always <br/>
remembered that they, too, must quicken and unfold through the innate <br/>
law of their own genius?<br/>

If you substitute &quot;unschooling&quot; for peace, it seems to me to be somewhat awkward stylistically, but still somehow right as conveying the concept that unschooling isn&#39;t a goal, but a way of life. <br/>
