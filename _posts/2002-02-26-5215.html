&gt; &gt;It&#39;s really too bad that kids don&#39;t get to medicate the adults in their<br/>
&gt; &gt;lives who have difficult behaviors.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now that would be some kind of fun!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the most part, I agree with you.  But I know a boy who came home crying <br/>
&gt; after being sent home yet again from the neighbour&#39;s for bad behavior.  He <br/>
&gt; told his mother that he really didn&#39;t want to act that way.  He just <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t help it.  He is one kid who has done really well since being <br/>
&gt; medicated.  But I don&#39;t believe there are very many like him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. My son has a good friend who, as his mother says, &quot;convinces the <br/>
people that don&#39;t believe in ADHD--when he&#39;s on medication.&quot;  She started not <br/>
wanting to have her son medicated for many reasons, but finally, after <br/>
agreeing to try it, realized it was exactly what was best for him. Jake <br/>
discovered another side to himself. She realized that this kid had NEVER been <br/>
able to just relax with anything, even things he desperately wanted to do. He <br/>
told her that he felt much happier and asked her to let him continue.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I also believe there are VERY few kids like Jake. And I bet their <br/>
moms know VERY early -- they don&#39;t have to have teachers or doctors diagnose <br/>
it.<br/>
