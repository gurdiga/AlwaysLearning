<div id="ygrps-yiv-508534198">***Is there really such a thing as &quot;newcomer&quot; questions for anything in <br/>
life? ***<br/>
<br/>
The first time I drove in Boston someone directed me to the rotary.  &quot;WTF is <br/>
a rotary,&quot; I asked.  Newcomer question.   I&#39;d already been alive forty some <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people come to unschooling email lists and say &quot;I&#39;ve been reading <br/>
and reading about unschooling and the philosophy resonates deeply with me.&quot; <br/>
(ok, cool so far...)  &quot;And I&#39;m all for trusting my kid to learn what he <br/>
needs from living life.&quot;  ( still cool...)  &quot;But all he wants to do is sit <br/>
and play video games, he&#39;s not interested in learning anything.  How do I <br/>
get him to do some math?&quot;   And WTF is that?   That&#39;s a &quot;newcomer&quot; question.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably the hardest thing.  When people come and say they don&#39;t know <br/>
much about unschooling and they have questions, everyone can understand <br/>
that.  It&#39;s easy to be patient with people who are trying to understand. <br/>
Unschooling is hard to get and anyone already doing it knows that and can <br/>
relate.   When people come, claiming knowledge and experience but revealing <br/>
through their writing that they don&#39;t *at all* understand, that&#39;s hard. <br/>
Those are the people who get defensive and angry.  It is hard to be patient <br/>
with people who want to be admired and complimented more than they want to <br/>
learn about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 ***Why such impatience? ***<br/>
<br/>
Sandra is patient.  She&#39;s been writing about unschooling for years, <br/>
answering the same questions again and again.   If unschoolers decided to <br/>
strap on pistols Sandra probably wouldn&#39;t shoot anybody.   Not even <br/>
newcomers.  Whoever wrote that should thank their lucky stars Sandra is so <br/>
patient, because if somebody wrote that kind of thing to me, I&#39;d be at their <br/>
door with a hatchet, demonstrating what impatience looks like.<br/>
<br/>
*** Just not really open to dialogue?***<br/>
<br/>
If ever there was a newcomer question, this is it.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra was writing for HEM magazine when my seventeen (almost eighteen!) <br/>
year old was little.  I think her email address was at the bottom of each <br/>
article.  Maybe even her street address!    She was writing at <br/>
unschooling.com when there was a busy message board.  She&#39;s been writing and <br/>
answering questions on email lists since there have been email lists.  She&#39;s <br/>
had this, her own list, for nine years.   That&#39;s a lot of years of being <br/>
open to dialogue.   None of that means she&#39;s obligated to give her time to <br/>
people who berate her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is especially hard when they&#39;ve got all kinds of formal education, <br/>
especially when their education is about education, and they are heavily <br/>
invested in thinking it means they already know all about learning, when <br/>
what they really know about is schooling.<br/>
<br/>
My own newcomer question (I&#39;m sure there were many, but this one still <br/>
rings in my ears):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So, you&#39;re telling me that if I just leave them alone they will, <br/>
eventually, pull their math books down off the shelf and do math on <br/>
their own?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Newcomer on SO many levels.<br/>
<br/>
That was 15 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been studying, reading, discussing, observing, writing, thinking, <br/>
analyzing, and living unschooling every since. Kind of like getting a <br/>
PhD and a decade of professional experience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I used to be very active on AlwaysUnschooled (and was even briefly a moderator there) and I eventually left partly because of life circumstances not leaving me the time, and partly because I just didn&#39;t have the patience for the sugar question or the TV question or the boys-playing-fighting-games question again. When I think about people who&#39;ve been doing it for a decade or more--and the people on AlwaysUnschooled who are still there answering the sugar question and the TV questions and the whatever question again--I&#39;m amazed and grateful to them.<br/>

I don&#39;t remember exactly what my newcomer questions were, but I do remember a question about pot smoking way back when Chamille was just 5 or 6.  Geez!  She was only 5 or 6.... She&#39;s almost 16 and isn&#39;t interested at all in smoking pot, or doing any kinds of drugs, she won&#39;t even try alcoholic beverages, even if I offered her one, and I have every once in a while offered her a taste of something, which she politely declines.<br/>
<br/>
What people have called me on, is some wording that I&#39;ve used that had more written into it than I&#39;d realized, and revealed areas in my thinking that I hadn&#39;t thought out well at all!  I still work on that, and many times write and then re-write what I&#39;ve written many times over so that it says exactly or as close to exactly what I want it to say and mean.  (and if that&#39;s not a confusing sentence right there, then, aw forget it, that proves it right there!)<br/>
