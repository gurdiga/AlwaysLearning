<div id="ygrps-yiv-505138389">I actually had an explanation for the haunted chair. &lt;g&gt;  I thought it<br/>

I have a friend who&#39;s an antiquities guy.  He doesn&#39;t buy or sell, he <br/>
appraises and analyzes.  OLD stuff. Pre-Columbian art and old Chinese <br/>
carvings and swords.<br/>
<br/>
He has a story of having been at a museum display of Mexican/Central American <br/>
stuff, mostly stone carvings, in New York, and talking to the curator and the <br/>
docents, and spending a day there observing himself...  there was one <br/>
non-ornamented but fair-sized piece that people would be drawn to and <br/>
repulsed by--that just kind of caused visceral reactions in people.  Some <br/>
wouldn&#39;t even get near it, as though it had an aura (and he figured it had).  <br/>
<br/>
Although it wasn&#39;t marked on the card or anything, it was a container for <br/>
blood or body parts or whatever from human sacrifices.  And he said the <br/>
energy in it was very powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Just Friday I was talking with someone I&#39;ve known a long time whose husband&#39;s <br/>
family is from northern New Mexico, where I grew up.   The daughter who is 13 <br/>
now went to a Hispanic art musuem and was unable to get close to a couple of <br/>
the colonial santos--the carved and painted figures of saints.   I told her <br/>
mom that there were a couple in the old Catholic church in Santa Cruz that <br/>
used to give me the physical creeps--not their appearance, which was fine, <br/>
but the standing in the place right in front of them, getting creepy feelings <br/>
of the people who had stood there before, and how much serious energy had <br/>
been poured out in the directions of those figures over a couple of hundred <br/>
of years--silent guilt and remorse and terror, and it felt like that.  Not <br/>
all over the church, but in certain spots.<br/>
<br/>
There might be explanations for that in the flow of the air in the building.  <br/>
<br/>
There are feelings and cross-miles communications that could have <br/>
explanations someday without proving the existence of multiple lifetimes.  <br/>
<br/>
My papaw, my mom&#39;s mom, who was NOT a superstitious or sentimental guy, who <br/>
didn&#39;t have trouble sleeping, got up and sat in his kitchen looking out the <br/>
window the night his mother died, and he sat looking out, he says, and other <br/>
witnesses at the time, until he saw his relatives coming by wagon, the next <br/>
morning, to tell him his mother had died just at the time he had suddenly <br/>
awakened and started to sit.   He wasn&#39;t the kind of guy to get up, nor the <br/>
kind of guy to worry, so ther&#39;s no alternative explanation like &quot;he probably <br/>
had gotten up like that fifteen times and once his mom happened to die.&quot;  His <br/>
mom wasn&#39;t sick and expected to die, I don&#39;t think.  <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of instances of what seems like mind reading around me, <br/>
between me and friends, and MAYBE we just glom onto what comes true that we <br/>
had thought, and ignore the thousands of things we fleetingly thought that did<br/>
n&#39;t connect to something within an hour or a day.  Maybe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most people don&#39;t know that relics still make up an important part of<br/>
worship and practice in some religions.  I don&#39;t know if Roman Catholic<br/>
churches still do this, or if Anglican or other &quot;traditional&quot; Christian<br/>
communions do, maybe someone else can say, but Eastern Orthodox altars have<br/>
relics encased within.  Ideally, they will belong to the saint to whom the<br/>
church is dedicated, although one imagines St. George has been distributed a<br/>
few more times than a normal skeleton would allow.  I used to attend a Greek<br/>
mission parish dedicated to St. Gregory of Nyssa, who, though very important<br/>
in eastern theology, does not have many churches named for him.  Our bishop<br/>
used to joke that when it came time to consecrate our own church building,<br/>
he&#39;d go to Greece and bring back a whole arm.<br/>

are also sometimes used as reliquaries.  When I visited England in 1999, it<br/>
was a little disconcerting at first to realize the cathedral floor was a<br/>
graveyard, and that there really were people in those sarcophagi.<br/>
Chichester Cathedral was very thought-provoking; they had a section of floor<br/>
removed and covered with glass so you could see the ancient Roman mosaic<br/>
beneath, and in another section we stumbled across the tomb of composer<br/>
Gustav Holst, alongside medieval nobles.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The day my childhood friend Kristin&#39;s dad died, I felt really odd and<br/>
panicky, and I bought a houseplant and a cockatiel; I had this powerful urge<br/>
to get living things into my room.  I knew he&#39;d been in the hospital, but<br/>
didn&#39;t know he&#39;d passed away until later that night.  Weird.<br/>
