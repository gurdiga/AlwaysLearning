<br/>
Puh-leez!  As if UNSCHOOLERS are even so prevalent in Mississippi!  The numbers certainly can&#39;t account for the number of cashiers who cannot make change!<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschool group is up in arms, both defending their own methods and coming to the defense of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you all have been keeping your sanity dealing with the aftermath of the GMA farce.  <br/>
<br/>
I am ready to spit nails!  I just cannot see how anyone in this JOKE of a state (education-wise) DARES to point fingers outside the public school system.  Maybe if the public schools were 6 months old and before that we were all unschooled AND showed these results, then maybe.  The way things are more people should be considering home schooling and unschooling since what we have from the gov&#39;t IS NOT WORKING.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it just amounts to not understanding nor giving enough effort to try, as well as wanting to point to something (anything) to make oneself look better, even if it is logically false.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kid is getting D&#39;s, but at least he doesn&#39;t sit on the couch all day watching TV.  I have heard some kids do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That idiot at the gas station couldn&#39;t figure my change.  I hope he didn&#39;t graduate from the same school my kid is going to.  Oo, I heard some kids get to do whatever they want all day.  He must be one of those.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grrr! Sorry for the rant.  I&#39;ll go try to calm down now.<br/>
<br/>
XAIPETE!  (Fare well, in Greek)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I almost jumped in this morning and asked her what &quot;ideal learning conditions&quot; are according to her and to ask her to demonstrate how she knows that it is true that they are met via traditional methods of education (as opposed to non-traditional methods).<br/>
<br/>
But I deleted it before I sent it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s lost in the circle of her own argument and it&#39;s not a repeating loop I want to get stuck in with her (well, I was, but I just got off).<br/>
<br/>
Every single person I know has at least one school story that is about being shamed and humiliated and that was detrimental to their self-concept (and confidence). I&#39;m so puzzled why those same people will stretch so far to defend school as being &quot;just as good&quot; (and often &quot;better&quot;) than alternatives that preserve a child&#39;s sense of self. And some of them will even &quot;fume&quot; about those better approaches (as per that annoying editorial).<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t get it. (Well, I do, but I wish I didn&#39;t.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah--it&#39;s pretty crazy.  I wrote the bit about common sense in response to her.  She proved my argument in her response and then went back on it--it IS a repeating loop.  I&#39;m not even sure what it is that she&#39;s arguing about anymore--and I honestly don&#39;t think she is either.  And she speaks of traditional schooling as though it&#39;s proven--a closed case of success.  I think that traditional schooling, and anyone defending it needs to prove their case every bit as much as she thinks alternative methods should.<br/>
<br/>
I had another response for her, but I&#39;ve decided as well to get off of the crazy-circling-ride.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I think many of us in that thread have made a very good case for the fact that ideal learning conditions--a piece that I brought in having to do with an emotionally safe environment without competition, with play, curiosity, etc.--are easy to create with unschooling.  She just seems bent on being defensive about traditional schooling.  It&#39;s like, the unschoolers want to write positively about unschooling, but she&#39;s determined to get us to weigh in on traditional schooling, and then accuse us of being negative.  She has a big mouth and tiny ears!<br/>

Hopefully I helped unconfuse her!  I wrote about her idea of coercive.  She seems to think that schools aren&#39;t coercive.  She agrees that coercive learning isn&#39;t ideal, so maybe that will help clear it up!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695394215">Well I could *learn* how to spell check for the word blasphemous! ;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not always focused on learning but then relationships are about<br/>
learning and learning is about relationships (not just with people,<br/>
see). Making connections with people and the things and ideas in the<br/>
world is learning, even when I&#39;m not consciously thinking about<br/>
learning per se. So learning works very well when I&#39;m not focused on<br/>
the learning that&#39;s taking place along with being with and sharing and<br/>
doing things together.<br/>
<br/>
Right the word &quot;relationships&quot; would make it seem as if I&#39;m talking<br/>
about something more generally understood in other ways.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve know unschoolers whose focus is on the relationship before learning, and it can be a slippery slope.  Here&#39;s an example:<br/>
<br/>
Two families, mine and another, rode to the beach together in one car.  The other mom&#39;s 9 yo son was not ready to leave when the rest of us all had decided that it had gotten chilly and windy and generally unpleasant.  He was allowed some time to do the thing that he said he hadn&#39;t had time to do, but when that wasn&#39;t enough, we packed up our stuff and headed to the car.  The rest of us waited and waited, and waited some more at the car while he went on digging his hole.<br/>
<br/>
The mom was unwilling to say anything remotely like, &quot;Hey, there are other people waiting and they would really like to go now,&quot; because she didn&#39;t want to &quot;coerce&quot; him.  It was all about him and how he felt.  I think that there was an opportunity missed to learn about how to be more sensitive to others in a group.  He could have learned some flexibility.  None of us wanted to force him into the car--we were willing to give him quite a bit of leeway, but that was more than exhausted, with no sense of reciprocation.  <br/>
<br/>
This mom is clear that her focus is on the relationship.  And that was his focus too--and not his relationships with other people.  He was entirely focused on his relationship with his mom and what she was giving him.  It seemed to me to become a very selfish experience.  I thought she should have helped him to see the bigger picture since he seemed unable to see it on his own.<br/>

<br/>
It seems that would be part of a partnership.  If one partner loses,  <br/>
they both lose.<br/>
<br/>
Next time if you take separate cars would she be offended?<br/>
Having heard the story I sure hope it was her car and not yours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742745255">If these mother knows that her son may need more time than others she should have driven her own car.<br/>
I would have told my kids that  if he needed more time I would come back another say just for him to stay and play as long as he <br/>
wanted , but that there were other people waiting  and it would not be polite or nice  to make them wait anymore.<br/>
 <br/>
Knowing my kids maybe ready to leave sooner or later than others are a reason I seldom share a ride with other families.<br/>
I did once for a trip when I was really broke and needed to take my dd to the dentist. We had mostly good moments, a couple bad and I would not<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t describe that as &quot;relationship-centered&quot; at all. I&#39;d call it &quot;child-centered.&quot; One reason I prefer to say &quot;relationship-centered&quot; (when I have to say anything at all) is deliberately as a way to break out of child- v. parent-centered. A relationship-centered response to the kind of situation you&#39;re describing, where one person is getting what he wants while nobody else&#39;s needs or wishes are being addressed at all, would try to take everyone into account, perhaps not equally (kids are less able to &quot;give&quot; than parents are, some kids are less able to &quot;give&quot; than others) but certainly nobody&#39;s meter should drop to zero while somebody else&#39;s is humming away at 100%.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not just one person in any relationship, so it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to say &quot;this is focusing on the relationship&quot; when it&#39;s really focusing on one person only.<br/>

I have a kid who, when he was younger, had a lot of trouble with transitions. It could be very hard for him to leave home to go to the beach, and then just as hard to leave the beach. Once or twice I turned down offers to ride together with other families precisely so that _I_ could help him with that transition--which could take a very long time--without inconveniencing the other people in our group. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879203266">***The mom was unwilling to say anything remotely like, &quot;Hey, there are other people waiting and they would really like to go now,&quot; because she didn&#39;t want to &quot;coerce&quot; him.***<br/>
<br/>
As the other mom there, I would&#39;ve said something to the kid.  Just the other day, Margaux and I were at a birthday party for a one yr old.  We&#39;d gotten a ride with the baby and his parents.  Margaux was stalling when it was time to go.  I told her that it was time to go and that we&#39;d like to leave and have a pleasant good bye at the park.  I waited until she was done with that one last thing, I stood there and made sure it was the one last thing and then we went over to a water fountain and washed off.  She was still stalling, so the driver politely told her that if we didn&#39;t hurry it up, we&#39;d likely be driving with a crying baby in the car because it was getting very near dinner time.  That sped her up.  It was a combination of me saying it and someone else saying it.  <br/>
<br/>
She could&#39;ve made it a power struggle.  I could&#39;ve made it one.  I could&#39;ve let her play and ignore our ride, but that would&#39;ve been rude.<br/>

They had privacy, though, to have whatever conversation she deemed appropriate.  I&#39;m guessing that it didn&#39;t sound like that because they didn&#39;t show up for so long.<br/>

<br/>
I mean - I&#39;m likely to be understanding of being imposed on by the need <br/>
to deal with a child&#39;s quirks or issues when I know the parent is <br/>
actually aware that I&#39;m being imposed on and is working on the problem. <br/>
She may have been avoiding imposing a complete and total crazed meltdown <br/>
on you in the car on the way home, for example, figuring making you wait <br/>
was the better of two difficult choices.<br/>
<br/>
Having had a kid who was easily frustrated and explosive, there were <br/>
definitely times that others waited for me to take time to help her <br/>
become calm and centered enough that we could move on without risk of <br/>
her falling apart at an even more inopportune time (driving down the <br/>
freeway in heavy traffic with her the back seat of the car with other <br/>
kids, for example). The more I rushed it, feeling pressured because <br/>
others were waiting, the worse things would end up. &quot;I&quot; knew that taking <br/>
time at the front end would make for a much smoother rest of the time. I <br/>
would apologize a LOT, though, and would avoid getting into situations <br/>
where we imposed on others, except for a few close friends who were <br/>
super understanding (and who had their own child issues and I was <br/>
patient with them, too).<br/>
