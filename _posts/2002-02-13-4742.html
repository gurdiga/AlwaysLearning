&gt; haven&#39;t already. Those are cool, too.<br/>

myself even more.<br/>

At Christmas each person in my family makes a gift for each of the others. <br/>
This year Beth (my partner, who is a Professional Girl Scout) and Julian had <br/>
been doing lots of skits for me. So I made them a kit based on Sandra&#39;s <br/>
Thinking Sticks, with characters and plot ideas for skits. You can take as <br/>
few or as many sticks out as you want. They LOVED it.<br/>
<br/>
I love this unschooling curriculum idea. I&#39;d love to help field test too.<br/>
