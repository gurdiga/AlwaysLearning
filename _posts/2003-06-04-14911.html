 </span></blockquote>I also wanted to add that &quot;gaps&quot; in knowledge are part of being human. There <br/>
is NO way that anyone is going to know about everything, so I guess we&#39;re all <br/>
doomed to have these gaps as long as we&#39;re living.:)<br/>
It&#39;s the gaps that make life interesting, that keep our curiosity alive and <br/>
make us ask questions. Gaps are a GOOD thing.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t remember who said it but there is a quote I love: &quot;there is nothing <br/>
that everyone needs to know&quot;<br/>
