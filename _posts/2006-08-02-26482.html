<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970736963">&quot;I am out of time and energy. Which way to turn? Where do I start?<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you all do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re trying to get involved in their worlds, but it&#39;s<br/>
not your responsibility to be there all the time!  You have a right to<br/>
your own interests and passions,just like they do. Ideally, you each<br/>
have your own interests and there are overlaps where all of you share<br/>
certain things.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really think you need to be right there for all of their<br/>
interests at every moment. Isn&#39;t your son 12 or so? Why isn&#39;t he<br/>
happily doing his own thing at times?  Being with our children to<br/>
connect with them and be interested in the things that make their<br/>
heart sing is GREAT!  Being there constantly isn&#39;t helpful in my<br/>
opinion, kids need their own space and time (different for each child<br/>
of course) in which to make connections.<br/>
<br/>
You aren&#39;t responsible for sharing your spouses interests, only<br/>
responsible for finding things you can BOTH enjoy together.  My<br/>
passions and interests are always going to be there, my family comes<br/>
in and out of those interests as they choose. Should be the same with<br/>
you. I don&#39;t recommend faking an interest in something, but I do think<br/>
it&#39;s advantageous to at least connect on things that bring joy into<br/>
our children&#39;s (or partners) lives.<br/>
<br/>
I have four children and manage to follow many of my own interests and<br/>
passions each and every day...so I KNOW it&#39;s possible.<br/>
