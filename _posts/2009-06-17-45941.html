<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294782888">Hi there.<br/>
<br/>
I just found this group and wanted to introduce myself.  I&#39;m new to homeschooling/unschooling, so I&#39;m here to learn.  I have 3 children ages dd11, dd9, and ds2.  We just began to unschool them this year.  It was really a non-churchy-yet-quite-spiritual revelation.  We were really just tired of all the negativity that we were inviting into our home on a daily basis.  Poo-poo to that!<br/>
My eldest is a little peeved that we decided to take her out of school.  We try to honor where she is at while still being upbeat about how this will be for her in the long run.  She is enjoying all the free time though.  She still hasn&#39;t figured out what she is to do with herself.  Initially, she felt that she wouldn&#39;t learn anything.  So we have just been reassuring her that whatever she needs - we&#39;ll will help her get there.  All in due time - and I can see how the stress and anxiety of public school is melting away.<br/>
My middle child loves it.  She has never really enjoyed school and has often been pidgeonholed to being a bit of a &#39;slow-learner&#39;.  That&#39;s crap.  She is brilliant when left to her own devices - she isn&#39;t all that interested in confined book-reading and structured creativity.  I&#39;ve noticed marked improvement in her interpersonal skills, and am rather happy about that.  Actually the whole family is.<br/>
Not much has changed for my youngest.  We are still doing what we have always done with him.  Living life.  Eating, pooping, playing, sleeping.  My perspective has changed though and I am seeing him and what &#39;he does&#39; in a different light.<br/>
Over the last couple of months it&#39;s been a bit woobly-goobly-timey-whimey in our house.  The kids having various emotional reactions to the transition.  Me feeling unsure of our decision.  Messy at times and rather clear-minded at others.  We are definately in the midst of deschooling and trying to be extra gentle with ourselves and each other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to have found you all,<br/>
Michelle in Ohio</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596010332">Michelle, I&#39;m going to point at some things that might move you one  <br/>
step closer to unschooling the way you&#39;d like to:<br/>
<br/>
-=-We were really just tired of all the negativity that we were  <br/>
inviting into our home on a daily basis. Poo-poo to that!<br/>
My eldest is a little peeved that we decided to take her out of  <br/>
school.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Having a child who is peeved is negativity that you brought into your  <br/>
home, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst aspects of school is that the children have no choice.<br/>
If you make one of the worst aspects of unschooling that the children  <br/>
have no choice, I see a problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She still hasn&#39;t figured out what she is to do with herself.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She shouldn&#39;t need to figure out what to do.  YOU find an array of  <br/>
wonderful things to do!<br/>

<br/>
-=-That&#39;s crap. She is brilliant -=-<br/>
<br/>
Negativity and harsh thinking.  And try to avoid &quot;brilliant&quot; as  <br/>
studiously as you avoid &quot;slow-learner.&quot;  They&#39;re both a problem.   Let  <br/>
your children be and learn and do where and when and how they are.  It  <br/>
will change gradually, but if you define them with tems like  <br/>
&quot;brilliant,&quot; it sets up expectations and molds that don&#39;t help  <br/>
unschooling thrive.<br/>
<br/>
-= My perspective has changed though and I am seeing him and what &#39;he  <br/>
does&#39; in a different light.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Despite my pickiness above, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here and I know this list  <br/>
can help you feel less &quot;woobly-goobly-timey-whimey&quot; about it all!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, you are right.  We&#39;ve discussed the decision many times and we have made an understanding that we&#39;ll try this on, really make a go of it - our best effort - and if in a year we see that it isn&#39;t working we can look at all the various options.  Initially, she was rather cynical, but over the past couple months her outlook and attitude regarding homeschooling has improved greatly.  So I chalk her peevishness up to more like temporary growing pains.  I really get that we placed her in an uncomfortable position.  We&#39;ve agreed to not make any new decisions about it for awhile - to just sit with it and see where it takes us.  She feels good about that.  <br/>

Museums, parks, sleeping in, lots of play/freetime, doing nothing, obsessive reading, cuddling, shopping, computer games, and just hanging out talking about nothing and everything.  I think my eldest is more stuck on the idea of busy work and being told what to do and when - that she was so used to in school.  This is also dissipating with time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You could give her some assignments - about unschooling! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe assign her a chapter a day of &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook.&quot; <br/>
Ask her to read the chapter and summarize it or answer questions about <br/>
it or something like that?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was 10 years old when we took her out of school and it was <br/>
slightly against her will, too. She agreed to a 6-week trial period, but <br/>
it only took her a couple of weeks to be 100 percent on board. That&#39;s <br/>
because we got very lucky and within two weeks we&#39;d become part of a <br/>
wonderful homeschool group and she&#39;d already gotten involved in being in <br/>
a play and was super enjoying her new friends.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; seems too mature for her (probably <br/>
isn&#39;t, though), then maybe she&#39;d enjoy reading Sandra&#39;s book, which is <br/>
collection of essays about their real lives: &quot;Moving a Puddle,&quot; or Rue <br/>
Kream&#39;s book, which is an easy read in question and answer format, <br/>
&quot;Parenting a Free Child.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
When I was about that age, I knew a girl down the street from me who<br/>
homeschooled.  This was a girl that I&#39;d gone to kindergarten and 1st<br/>
grade with and had loved her then.  She was one of my favorite friends<br/>
in school and I was sad when she left.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being really bored and lonely and wishing I had a friend, so<br/>
on a whim I walked over to her house to see if she remembered me.  She<br/>
did and her mom did too.  I stayed and played at their house, which was<br/>
this amazing place of all things crafty and homeschooly.  I felt like I<br/>
was in heaven!  We went to her room, where she&#39;d been in the midst of<br/>
beading and had it all over her floor.<br/>
<br/>
I was struck with the notion that if I wasn&#39;t in school all day, I&#39;d<br/>
have time to do stuff like beading and spreading my project all over the<br/>
floor and work on it all day long if I wanted.  It was an incredibly<br/>
profound moment for me, so much so, I still remember what the beads<br/>
looked and felt like and what my friend looked like and how her room was<br/>
set up.  Ever since that moment, every day in school felt like time<br/>
wasted, it was painful.  I begged my mother to let me stay home, but she<br/>
lacked the confidence to do it, something she regrets to this day.<br/>
<br/>
So when kids leave school and the schedule and rigor, it&#39;s really good<br/>
for them to see what they could do INSTEAD.  What is it that your child<br/>
loves to do?  It could be anything, it could be beading.  Whatever it<br/>
is, encourage that, buy new beads, buy new video games, get a new pet,<br/>
whatever it is that they never felt they had time for while in school.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That is a good idea - she has requested more guidance/structure for the time being.  This might be a good way to give her that while also opening her eyes to more possibilities.  Especially where it shows essays from other unschooled kids....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

My youngest has never been to school and we have always just had stuff around that you can do what you like with, one example being multilinkcubes - interlocking cubes you join together to make shapes.  Sarah had a friend visiting who went to school and I always remember her comment &quot;These are really cool.  We have them at school but we are never alllowed to just play with them.&quot;<br/>
