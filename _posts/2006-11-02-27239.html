Kerri, mom to: Amanda(16, she chose to attend high-school), Emma(14), Maddison(12), T(foster dd, 11), A (foster ds, 10), Jonah(9), Saige & Claire (id twin girls, 6), M(foster dd, 6), S(foster dd, 4), Teagan(ds, 3) and 3 dogs, 2 cats & 2 horses. The rest of the bios learn naturally at home but my foster children attend school. Everyday the school experience with the foster children validates even more that naturally learning at home is right for our family!!<br/>
