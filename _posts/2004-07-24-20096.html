<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138886258">snip~ &quot;My first choice is not to cook today at all, and I kinda wish <br/>
someone would come and cook for me.  But my wishing isn&#39;t going to make it <br/>
happen.  And I&#39;ll probably cook something later on. &lt;g&gt;  Not my first choice.  But I will choose to do it.  Not REALLY what I want, but what I will settle for.<br/>
<br/>
i often feel this way... <br/>
the way i would explain it is...  <br/>
<br/>
Because of choices i made earlier in the day (week, year, etc) i&#39;m going to cook tonight, even though i don&#39;t really feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it probably won&#39;t be one of my better meals!<br/>
