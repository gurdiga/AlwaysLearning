<div id="ygrps-yiv-699929939">The boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees<br/>
about an urgent problem with one of the main computers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He dialed the employee&#39;s home phone number and was greeted with<br/>
<br/>
a child&#39;s whispered, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a<br/>
<br/>
youngster the boss asked, &quot;Is your Daddy home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot;, whispered the small voice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;May I talk with him?&quot; the man asked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the surprise of the boss, the small voice whispered, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, &quot;Is your Mommy<br/>
<br/>
there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot;, came the answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;May I talk with her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again the small voice whispered, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left<br/>
<br/>
home alone, the boss decided he would just leave a message with<br/>
<br/>
the person who should be there watching over the child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is there any one there besides you?&quot; the boss asked the child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot; whispered the child, &quot;a policeman.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee&#39;s home,<br/>
<br/>
the boss asked, &quot;May I speak with the policeman?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, he&#39;s busy,&quot; whispered the child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Busy doing what?&quot; asked the boss.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Talking to Daddy and Mommy and the Fireman&quot;, came the whispered<br/>
<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like<br/>
<br/>
a helicopter through the ear piece on the phone the boss asked,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is that noise?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A hello-copper&quot; answered the whispering voice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is going on there?&quot; asked the boss, now alarmed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In an awed whispering voice the child answered, &quot;The search team<br/>
<br/>
just landed the hello-copper.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Alarmed, concerned, and more than just a little frustrated the boss asked,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are they searching for?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still whispering, the young voice replied along with a muffled<br/>
<br/>
giggle:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Me&quot;<br/>
<br/>
