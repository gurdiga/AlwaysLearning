&gt; he asked how I got an A, no one ever got A&#39;s from this professor.  I told <br/>
&gt; him that he was my easiest professor because I only had to recount the <br/>
&gt; professor&#39;s personal opinions as to why an event was important.  It made <br/>
&gt; history fun to see the big picture without having to memorize dates.  <br/>

corporate hiring and advancement.<br/>
<br/>
In history they will talk about a leader being charismatic, but they rarely <br/>
praise followers for being good at inter-personals, or psychic, or sensitive, <br/>
or whatever.  That&#39;s considered some kind of witchcraftery, and the person is <br/>
suspect.  Rasputin was good at what he did--and it&#39;s not considered &quot;fair.&quot;  <br/>
Sir Walter Raleigh knew what Queen Elizabeth wanted.  He was a cheater. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Oooh!  Oooh!  <br/>
I was just telling the story two days ago about waiting tables in an upscale <br/>
New Mexican restaurant when I was 20/21, and the &quot;career&quot; waitress in the <br/>
place, the ranking waitress, being tacky to me because I was a college kid, <br/>
and then being really irritated because my tips were better than hers.  But <br/>
she waited tables like most people do schoolwork--she did what the rules said <br/>
she had to do, and less if she thought she could get away with it, and wasn&#39;t <br/>
creative about it.  I dealt with the people as people, instead of &quot;4 at table <br/>
16&quot; as she did, and my tips were double hers.  <br/>
<br/>
That has helped change the way I advise my kids on how to interact, though.  <br/>
I learned a lot in that job.<br/>
