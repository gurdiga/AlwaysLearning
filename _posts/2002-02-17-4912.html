get to scanning it eventually :)<br/>

We were talking about what&#39;s missing in e-mail, and one thing is seeing what <br/>
people&#39;s handwriting looks like.  So there was a call for samples, with a <br/>
suggestion to use a John Holt quote or something else good for unschoolers, <br/>
and there are only two so far!   Others are welcome to put writing up <br/>
too--encouraged!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737873967">Thanks for explaining, I was like &quot;what the heck??!!&quot; LOL<br/>
You don&#39;t want to see my handwriting, it&#39;s horrible.  When I write I&#39;ve<br/>
reverted to using all capitals.  It&#39;s the only way anyone can read it.<br/>
Speaking of this, I&#39;m wondering if this is a legitimate way to teach my son<br/>
all his handwriting....all caps.  He knows what all the other letters look<br/>
like obviously since they&#39;re it books that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tamzin uses almost all capital letters when she writes. She <br/>
says &#39;it looks better&#39;. I think she finds it easier to form capitals <br/>
(doesn&#39;t require so many even little circles &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
Let your son &#39;teach&#39; himself. He&#39;ll choose which way works best <br/>
for him, Tamzin did. All learning is legitimate (even if the &#39;experts&#39; <br/>
say otherwise).<br/>
