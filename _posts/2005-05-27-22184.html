<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241019881">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t post often, a major understatement, I know, however, I have a little story to share.  Me and my 3 kids went to the Smithsonian-Natural HIstory Museum the other day, and I must say that I was a bit distracted by many of the parents...maybe I was just tuned into that side of it after the first jolt!  The first one that struck me, was a woman with a few 4-5 year olds...we were by the dinosaur femurs, and she snapped her fingers at them and said &quot;He-LLoooow! Look at the bones!  They aren&#39;t dog bones!&quot;...wow, my kids stopped short (we all did), and kind of were shocked into staring, for a moment or two...more than that for my 8yo!  He told his dad about it when we got home.  And then throughout the course of the time we were there, there were so many adults &quot;pushing&quot; education onto the kids.  Like one man, telling the 2  boys that he was with, upon coming up to an exhibit...&quot;tell me what kind of lesson you see here&quot;.  And a group of people...2-3 adults, and 6-7 kids...&quot;now how do<br/>
 these insects see...right...with their antenaes!&quot;  Which I heard from this group 2 more times, the same sentences...drilling in what the adults think the kids ought to get out of it.  I&#39;m happy that we went along, stopping where we wanted to, not where we didn&#39;t...all of us making that choice.  Too bad we didn&#39;t have longer!  We talked about getting locked in at night, and how cool that would be!<br/>

I was thinking about your observations and wondering if maybe that is why<br/>
&quot;museum&quot; always brought a negative feeling in me!  If children are left<br/>
alone to find the things that THEY think are interesting and have value to<br/>
THEM, &quot;museum&quot; will be exciting and an adventure instead of torture.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to point out the learning from objects in a museum, that&#39;s<br/>
why they are there!  You wouldn&#39;t want to distract your child as they<br/>
explore or admire some strange object!  Something for me to think about as I<br/>
feel that teacher in me bubble up when there&#39;s an audience.. (Does that<br/>
happen to anyone else?)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I went to the zoo with my children when they were very young I read<br/>
loudly the signs that were posted at each animal. I&#39;d often finish the<br/>
reading standing by myself. It didn&#39;t take me too long to figure out those<br/>
awesome signs were there for ME! I got to read and enjoy them without<br/>
worrying about whether my kids were &quot;getting the lesson&quot;! Wow, what an<br/>
epiphany that was! :OP<br/>
<br/>
When we go to museums or zoos now, my kids are often interested in the<br/>
written material of the parts they are interested in. I don&#39;t think I<br/>
negatively impacted their ability to appreciate written factual knowledge,<br/>
thank god! Guess I figured it out early enough!<br/>

 <br/>
Isn&#39;t that true of <br/>
movies<br/>
books<br/>
public parks<br/>
basements and attics<br/>
chores<br/>
food<br/>
beds and bedtimes <br/>
 <br/>
Most people can&#39;t imagine a kid planning to go to bed, WANTING to go to  bed, <br/>
arranging things just so and going to sleep happy every night.  <br/>
 <br/>
When parents/adults manage a child&#39;s life to the point of telling them what  <br/>
to look at, what to think, what and when to eat, and to sleep when they&#39;re not <br/>
 sleepy, a lot of things happen and none of them lead to peace, joy, personal <br/>
 awareness and natural learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372359317">This just reminded me... is this the list that was talking about Comanche, the horse who was the only survivor on the white man-side at the Battle of Little Bighorn? Rain and I saw him today, and I thought of the discussion on whatever list that was. He&#39;s in Lawrence, Kansas now, partially wrapped in padding and on a wooden frame, in a little room with a dehudifier (I think) going. His neck and head were visible, though, and his back. He&#39;s in the process of being moved to a new exhibit at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum, where he has apparently been for many (over 100?) years.<br/>
<br/>
We also saw the Panorama of North American Mammals, originally displayed at the 1883 World&#39;s Fair. Yes, it&#39;s a display of mounted and stuffed dead animals (along with a nice discussion of taxidermy), but it seems more acceptable since it&#39;s been around so long. There were other displays at the museum, of dinosaur bones and some live fish and snakes, too. We spent a couple of hours there, Rain and I, and then we went for coffee and hung out in downtown Lawrence, which is as close to California as one gets in Kansas...<br/>
<br/>
There was another family at the museum with 4 boys, who were carrying a paper to fill out based on the exhibits (we just had a map) and who were dashing top-speed through the halls and chasing each other whenever we saw them. I don&#39;t think they really wanted to be there, but we enjoyed it a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308036292">When we were in New York at the Natural History Museum, there were <br/>
school children there, even though it was a Saturday.  They were filling <br/>
out long, multi-page question/answer stuff.  It was kinda sad.  They <br/>
were reading all the displays just to find the answer to their questions <br/>
on their sheet Janene and Lexie and I were having a blast, comparing the <br/>
various prehistoric men to our various relatives, there  was one part <br/>
where they were showing up close anatomy, and the girls were very <br/>
interested in the uterus and ovaries and how the sperm gets out of the <br/>
body and some nearby folks got a bit of an education. <br/>
<br/>
We were lucky enough to be let into the natural history museum in Denver <br/>
early, very early, at 4am, and  that was very cool.  And we also got <br/>
into the Rock hall of fame early too.  I think those were the best parts <br/>
of the trip, the museums.  That and the Guggenheim museum.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
like all the abstract art, but Lexie sure did.  The building was very <br/>
very cool.<br/>

We were  lucky enough to be let into the natural history museum in Denver <br/>
early,  very early, at 4am, and  that was very cool.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=================================<br/>
 <br/>
I couldn&#39;t help but have two dozen zinging excited thoughts about that, but  <br/>
two big ones:<br/>
 <br/>
Can you imagine the craziness if a group of schoolkids (as a group, not the  <br/>
possibly-wonderful individuals) were let into a public place after (or before) <br/>
 hours?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And then I thought no, schoolkids are not up at 4:00 a.m., and if they were  <br/>
someone would say they should NOT be up then, because they haven&#39;t slept eight <br/>
 hours, and without eight hours sleep a night (every night, even in summer <br/>
and on  weekends) they won&#39;t be &quot;on schedule&quot; to be alert for school.  Anyone <br/>
who  has taken health education at school and gotten A&#39;s, as I have, could <br/>
recite  that truth and would of course live by it, just as with brushing teeth up <br/>
and  down.  NO WAIT... two years later they said only down on the top, and only <br/>
 up on the bottom, or else you would shove food under your gums.  OH HOLD  <br/>
ON!  Three years later they said do it circularly so you can get the food  out <br/>
from under your gums.  So do exactly what they told you in school and  you&#39;ll <br/>
be healthy, and being at a museum at 4:00 a.m. is NOT healthy because  it&#39;s <br/>
just not right.  And there is one right answer, and that is...   whatever they <br/>
said in school yesterday.<br/>
 <br/>
Until further notice.<br/>
 <br/>
Doesn&#39;t school specialize in removing people&#39;s will to think, and in   <br/>
neutralizing any confidence or new ideas they might&#39;ve been about to  vocalize?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad I went to school because I had a good time and didn&#39;t have the  <br/>
greatest home environment (not enough books, my first early-life book-worshiping  <br/>
thought), and because now I know deeply what my kids aren&#39;t missing.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Confessions of a bibliophile: When I read this sentence, I thought of<br/>
a book I loved as a child, about two children who run away to live in<br/>
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I had many daydreams about living in a<br/>
museum, sleeping on Marie Antoinette&#39;s bed, and bathing in water<br/>
fountains! The book was &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.<br/>
Frankweiler&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Science Museum in St. Paul occasionally has slumber parties, now I<br/>
think I&#39;ll have to find out when, &#39;cause my young scientist would<br/>
probably get a kick out of sleeping with the dinosaurs.<br/>
