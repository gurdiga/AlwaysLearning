<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843220116">I told Marty and Holly a month ago that Kirby&#39;s tweets had  <br/>
misspellings and I didn&#39;t want to correct him.  I still don&#39;t.<br/>

misspellings, so Marty thought I was wrong and unfair.<br/>

Kirby, who didn&#39;t go to school, just wrote this and I will analyze it  <br/>
for you, having been a professional teacher of language use for  <br/>
English speakers:<br/>

ready to pop if poked. Time to sleep through the second half of my  <br/>

One typo, one misspelling and one lack of punctuation.  Not really too  <br/>
bad.   &quot;Balloon&quot; isn&#39;t a native English word; neither is burrito  <br/>
(though I think that was just a typographical error).    Had he  <br/>
written it for publication, for real publication, he would probably  <br/>
have asked me or someone to check the spelling and then it would have  <br/>
said<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913423020">The word burrito may have been shortened due to the 140 character limit Twitter has. Same could be said for &quot;baloon&quot;.

I have lot of fun manipulating words & punctuation when playing on my personal Twitter account (also have 1 work account & I help another business with their Twitter for free - no playing there! All business).  <br/>

Ah, Gwen, you&#39;re nice.  You&#39;re nicer to my kid behind his back than I  <br/>
am behind his back!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re correct.  My kids can read license plate humor way better than  <br/>
I can (when people put words on vanity plates here, but they have a 7- <br/>
character limit) and certainly I waste much time with spelling out  <br/>
words in text messages.<br/>

<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t be wrong but my favorite commas &quot;rule&quot; of all time was  <br/>
learned in 1963 and it is &quot;When in doubt, leave it out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although grammarians have caused millions of kids to memorize tons of  <br/>
rules, few of them talked about the purpose of commas and periods, and  <br/>
that is to enable a person to read aloud with the tone or meaning the  <br/>
writer intended, or to read silently without confusion.<br/>
<br/>
If I were trying to communicate that rules make comma usage  <br/>
irritating, I would use a comma in this:<br/>
<br/>
But for all those rules, comma use is simple.<br/>
<br/>
Longer sentences were popular when those rules came into being.   <br/>
Robert Louis Stevenson wrote all those adventure novels with sentences  <br/>
as long as a night on the stormy sea.   In a shorter sentence, a comma  <br/>
can be distracting.      And in tweets, they cost as much as a w.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441698313">Twitter also has a character limit for each tweet. (You may already be aware of this.)  Maybe he was trying to condense the words balloon and burrito to express his entire thought.</div>
