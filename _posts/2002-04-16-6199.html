I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve guessed right about anyone yet! With my record, the<br/>
clearer the picture I have of someone, the more likely they&#39;ll turn out the<br/>
opposite of what I imagine. I &quot;knew&quot; that Sandra was tall and blond and<br/>
willowy and Pam would be dark to go with her last name. ;-) Someone said<br/>
they pictured me looking like Betty White! :-)<br/>

Joyce is short, about 5&#39;3&#39;&#39; with very dark hair pulled back low on her neck<br/>
Sandra I&#39;ve seen so I can&#39;t describe her.<br/>
AnneO has really long hair, light brown and very shiny and she wears lots of<br/>
purple and beads<br/>
Helen has short wavy blond hair, thick, and tucked back over her ears. She<br/>
has a very no nonsense look about her.<br/>
Pam has very blonde hair and fair skin to make a beautiful contrast with her<br/>
husband<br/>
I am 5&#39;8&#39;&#39; 115 lbs with HUGE boobs, a tiny butt with no cellulite or<br/>
stretchmarks and can walk in high heels for hours<br/>
NOT!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856958599">I&#39;ve realized that I mostly picture people by hairstyle!  I don&#39;t know why.<br/>
Joyce, you&#39;re supposed to have blond hair, Pam S. should have straight,<br/>
shoulder length black hair, and zenmomma shouldn&#39;t have bangs.  Ren looks<br/>
just right, and Elissa, you&#39;d better have short blond curlyish hair :0).<br/>

Me?  I still think I am in my early twenties, sunkissed with color, not<br/>
thin - but just right - then I look in the mirror and don&#39;t recognize<br/>
myself.  I want to know the aging alien that took over my body.<br/>

Sharon&#39;s hair is like my husband&#39;s kind of.  He has a braid and the braid is <br/>
still kinda blond, but the hair on his head is all grey and white.<br/>

Goodness, it is. I just looked at the pictures I took. I was remembering a<br/>
bit darker than mine and I think of mine as dark blonde. (It&#39;s the same<br/>
color as a used penny. :-) It looks a tad reddish in the picture which it<br/>
isn&#39;t at all.)<br/>
