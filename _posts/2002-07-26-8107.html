<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267324138">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago the family (me, Russ and four kids) did the train from CA to <br/>
MN, and then back again after a family visit.  The tricky part was getting <br/>
the reservations all lined up.  We were able to book the family sleeping car, <br/>
which was all across the back of the sleeping car, and was a wonderful space <br/>
for us.  Food was hard.  We couldn&#39;t bring enough to feed ourselves thro the <br/>
whole trip, and often the wait at the dining car was way too long for kids to <br/>
handle.  Totally different - prompt service on the return trip, so I guess it <br/>
depends on the staff.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is loving attending community college.  I spoke to her teacher <br/>
after the dance concert (my daughter was in the teacher&#39;s modern piece which <br/>
was all about the teacher&#39;s siblings and their father&#39;s death).  Her teacher <br/>
told me it was so refreshing to have a student that had some intellectual <br/>
grasp of what was going on.  Her nutrition instructor told her she loved <br/>
having her in class since she proved if you show up and pay attention you can <br/>
do well (ie -get good grades :-) ), and learn the material.  What can I say?? <br/>
My daughter is simply interested in what is going on there, and it shows.  Is <br/>
it because she didn&#39;t attend school until college, is it because she is <br/>
mature beyond her years, is it because she has always been academically <br/>
minded??  Who knows - but I am thrilled when she shares what she is learning, <br/>
and is excited about being and doing her life.  That excitement is my <br/>
definition of having focus and passion in your life.  <br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Connie<br/>
