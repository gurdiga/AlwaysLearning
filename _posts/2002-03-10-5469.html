 How about a picnic at the zoo or the lake? I might be able to wrangle a boat <br/>
 even. At the OTHER lake, my brother-in-law has a house and a boat---that&#39;s <br/>
 sounding even better. (Now I&#39;ll have to suck-up!).  Or we can just hang <br/>
here. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Yes, that kind of sightseeing is what I meant. I just thought it would be <br/>
cool to hang out away from the conference, with no agenda really. Beach, <br/>
park, pool, whatever.....<br/>
<br/>
My Trevor is really into gaming...he would be so thrilled to hang out with <br/>
kids that are into gaming or comics. He&#39;s 12....at the time of the conference <br/>
he&#39;ll be only a couple months from turning 13. All of my wee ones are coming <br/>
with, possibly dh too, it depends.  <br/>
I&#39;ll probably miss a lot of workshops if dh doesn&#39;t  come, because babsy boy <br/>
will be too hard to keep with.  Maybe some of the teens are into babysitting? <br/>
I guess Trevor could a little bit, but I really want him to have freedom to <br/>
wander and meet people.<br/>
