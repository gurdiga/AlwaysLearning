<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088674801">HI all -<br/>
Thanks Pam for passing along that essay....it stirred up a long ago <br/>
hurt....In 5th grade we had to write an essay about a voyage across the <br/>
ocean....like a 13 yo boy who signed on to work on a ship for his passage to <br/>
the new country or something....I started the essay like this:  (can you <br/>
believe I can still remember it!!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I don&#39; t know why I did it, but I did.  I signed up to work on the xxxx <br/>
ship so that I can get to America.&quot;  (something in there about being afraid <br/>
too)<br/>
<br/>
I felt very creative starting it out like a journal entry.....I was pretty <br/>
thrilled with my idea.....<br/>
<br/>
My favorite teacher of all time SQUASHED it!  Told me that it was not <br/>
appropriate.....totally shocked me with her red pen editing and criticizing <br/>
my creativity!<br/>
<br/>
Later that year, she used one of my writing samples on an overhead to point <br/>
out errors.....she didn&#39;t show my name but I was horrified.....here I was <br/>
walking around thinking I knew something about writing!   I read A LOT and I <br/>
remember specifically that I was playing with a style that I had noticed in a <br/>
book....ugh!<br/>
<br/>
Into college, I felt unsure of my writing ability.....taking risks with my <br/>
writing became very difficult and I mostly stayed on the safe side in high <br/>
school.....my parents use a different language so I felt that I was <br/>
rightfully unsure since I was using a &#39;second language&#39; so if others thought <br/>
my writing wasn&#39;t good, it probably isn&#39;t....<br/>
<br/>
even now, I feel that I should edit what I post.....<br/>
<br/>
ugh.....<br/>
<br/>
and then there are all those formulas for poetry, too....<br/>
<br/>
okay, nuff venting!  thanks for listening!<br/>
Jane<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697757479">I can believe it easily. :/ I had a similar experience in the English course<br/>
I signed up for in junior college. I wrote something fairly clever (if I do<br/>
say so myself &lt;g&gt;) and it got red marked everywhere for mistakes in grammar.<br/>
<br/>
Since I have a really big (gigantic, can&#39;t-get-through-the-door big &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
ego, I realized that the instructor lacked the wit to appreciate me, and<br/>
didn&#39;t go back. ;)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. You write quite well, IMHO. You are clear and it&#39;s easy to follow what<br/>
you&#39;re trying to say. But hey, just ask that English instructor what *I*<br/>
know. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve always just loved that memory.  &quot;Funny, [yet still mysteriously <br/>

I was seventeen and writing for someone who thought good and funny should not <br/>
occur in the same space.  I was writing for an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
I still have that paper.</div>

Humor often contains irreverence.  Dangerous stuff.  Authorities need to<br/>
keep a watchful eye out for it.<br/>
