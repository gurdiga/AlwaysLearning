<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892063501">Hi, <br/>
I just wanted to thank Sandra for writing about moving<br/>
the furniture in her house.  A friend of mine is<br/>
moving away, so we are having a big dinner on Saturday<br/>
night to say goodbye.  Our dining room is too small<br/>
for the number of people coming so I moved the dining<br/>
room into the living room today....what a difference! <br/>
My two older kids came home from the neighbor&#39;s house<br/>
and immediately tried out the new locations of the<br/>
couches, found projects that I had set on the table<br/>
that had been long forgotten and lost under the<br/>
radiator,  and set up cozy spots in the corners.  It<br/>
has been wonderful...I think we all feel like we&#39;re<br/>
living in a new space (very important in the middle of<br/>
a New England winter!)  and all it took was a little<br/>
muscle.<br/>
Thanks again, Sandra, for planting the seed......maybe<br/>
tomorrow we&#39;ll  do some shuffling upstairs!!<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Beth<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We found a dog toy that had been lost for two years, up on top of a  <br/>
bookshelf behind some games.<br/>
Another bonus of moving lots of things around.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are people who move every year or two and don&#39;t know how  <br/>
it can be to stay for six or twenty years.  I like the staying kind  <br/>
of life.  Holly seems to like the moving stuff.  She never had a room  <br/>
at our old house.  Since we moved she has been in four different  <br/>
rooms.  I&#39;ve lost a storage room, then my office, then a sewing room  <br/>
to Holly&#39;s desire to have a new room.  I don&#39;t mind too much.   <br/>
Unfortunately, I lose some things because I don&#39;t move as thoroughly  <br/>
as Holly does.  I&#39;m a straggler kind of mover. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Glad it worked well for you!<br/>
