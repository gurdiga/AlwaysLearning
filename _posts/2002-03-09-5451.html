<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647667373">&lt;&lt; Maybe an unschooling.com reunion?  Or union perhaps, since you can&#39;t have <br/>
&quot;re&quot; when you&#39;ve never met!! LOL &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the whole conference is an unschooling.com extravaganza!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 12y.o. ds buys the gaming guides for nearly everything he plays and <br/>
reads <br/>
them intently.  He loves having directions to help him figure out the games.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried to buy a game guide for PS2 Harvest Moon, which Holly is pretty far <br/>
into, Marty is not quite as far, and his friend Logan has been playing for <br/>
months.  Marty was relieved when I didn&#39;t find one.  I asked them how many <br/>
girls there were in the town.  They didn&#39;t really know, but he looked in the <br/>
little pamphlet that comes with the game.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did it name all the characters but told their birthdays and what <br/>
gifts they liked best.  Marty was appalled, shut the thing up as soon as he <br/>
saw that, and said maybe Holly would like to use that, but he would NOT, and <br/>
didn&#39;t want anyone telling him what it said.   <br/>
<br/>
To Marty, it was just like working a crossword puzzle by looking at the <br/>
answer key.  (OR, for Marty, maybe like working a jigsaw puzzle by looking at <br/>
the picture on the box!! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Strategy guides don&#39;t seem like directions.  When I think directions, I<br/>
think the vast numbers of sheets with text translated from Korean, often<br/>
poorly, with 500 little pieces and drawings - like for putting together<br/>
furniture.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always liked strategy guides - often getting them at the same time we<br/>
buy the game (which comes after renting the game and finding it is the one<br/>
in ten we&#39;ll really enjoy).<br/>
<br/>
The guides are full of &quot;clues&quot; and &quot;research info&quot;.  We like that.  For the<br/>
game we&#39;ve been playing with for the past couple months (ace combat 04)<br/>
Nathan and I have the strategy guide pretty well memorized.  (Now, we could<br/>
write some additional chapters.)  The directions are at a more general<br/>
level and based on features of the challenge. And the statistics for all the<br/>
planes and targets are there. Yummy...<br/>
<br/>
But what about &quot;cheat codes&quot;?  I think when it comes to video games, if<br/>
cheat codes help you reach the goal - which really is to have fun - by<br/>
changing the rules enough to match your skills to the game play level (thus<br/>
promoting flow), then they&#39;re cool. Once we have progressed in our skills,<br/>
we move on to more challenging play with the codes off.  We have gamesharks<br/>
for two of our consoles, but haven&#39;t needed one yet for the PS2.<br/>
<br/>
I think of these things as like training wheels.  Is that cheating?  Who&#39;s<br/>
losing? Who is being treated unfairly?  When my son and I play chess,<br/>
sometimes I start down a piece, occasionally it&#39;s the queen (it&#39;s up to him<br/>
based on how much of a challenge he wants) and then I know I am in for a<br/>
challenge.  But I&#39;m not being treated unfairly.  Unfairness is wrong,<br/>
dishonesty is wrong, but I think breaking rules is only wrong when the<br/>
consequences are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, people who make rules usually don&#39;t make them to be examined and<br/>
thought about.  They&#39;re not usually presented as &quot;optional&quot; or &quot;flexible.&quot;<br/>
Nathan and Cris and I have talked quite a bit about rules and the ethics of<br/>
play, how this relates to other situations, you know - &quot;the real world&quot;.<br/>
These conversations have grown out of Nathan&#39;s concern about the ethics of<br/>
using &quot;cheat&quot; codes since he knows &quot;cheating is wrong&quot;.  He is delightfully<br/>
honest.  It&#39;s one of the things I admire about him most of all.  So we talk<br/>
it through and think about different examples.  And as we explore, lots of<br/>
shades of gray emerge. Traveling further...colors!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anything in life is simple.  Really.  It&#39;s a curse, but there<br/>
it is.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, deeply, that real cheating is wrong.  If an Olympic skier takes a<br/>
shortcut on the cross-country course and wins, that&#39;s bad because games like<br/>
the Olympics are one of the few things in life that are designed to be<br/>
&quot;fair.&quot;  (back to the Princess Bride quote) But the distinction is in the<br/>
dishonesty, not the rule-breaking.  Athletes agree to the rules before the<br/>
game starts and it if they don&#39;t abide by them, they&#39;re disqualified.<br/>
That&#39;s how it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Games, though, aren&#39;t an applicable metaphor for all the things in life one<br/>
does.<br/>
<br/>
If two people are playing a game and both agree to change the rules, right<br/>
in the middle of the game, that&#39;s not cheating, that&#39;s innovation.  If<br/>
you&#39;re playing a video game, you can only cheat yourself out of a greater<br/>
challenge.  And that&#39;s your choice.<br/>
<br/>
Drawing on what I do for a living, if I go out to the web and find free<br/>
source code (or copy my co-worker&#39;s code) that solves a problem and get a<br/>
program written in half the time, that makes my boss very happy.  And my<br/>
co-worker is flattered.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the mindset I need for work is in the willingness to identify which<br/>
rules can be broken and which ones cannot, and seeing how much advantage can<br/>
be gained by breaking the ones that can be broken.  In my job, I&#39;d guess I<br/>
break more rules than I follow.  We call it thinking outside the box, but we<br/>
all know you can&#39;t wear Bermuda shorts and a tank top to work.  Ahhhh,<br/>
Balance.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing: Knowing the difference between different kinds of rules.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I try to communicate to Nathan in our play and daily life.  A<br/>
deeper understanding of how to play and live peacefully with others means<br/>
you need to have a sensitivity to the rules.  This carries over into family<br/>
rules, and honestly - he will negotiate changes if he thinks a rule my wife<br/>
and I have come up with could be changed or suspended.  This has been our<br/>
policy since he learned to talk.  And we have gotten really good at this<br/>
now, even though it baffles our friends and family when we take a time out<br/>
to have a little &quot;hearing&quot; ;)  The rule he can&#39;t break in the negotiations<br/>
is that the parents make the final ruling.  The ruling is probably final<br/>
when both parents agree on a precise finding.  It&#39;s definitely final when<br/>
both parents agree it&#39;s final.  Is negotiating-after-the-fact kosher?<br/>
Absolutely not.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that negotiation is fruitful for him, sometimes it&#39;s just<br/>
&quot;practice&quot; and he doesn&#39;t get what he was pursuing.  But I think it is so<br/>
much better training for adulthood than living with the sense that all rules<br/>
are unconditional and simply to be obeyed without thought or question.<br/>
Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
Way off course, but ok with it,<br/>

This is from a diary I used to keep on Marty.  He was four. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wed, Jul 28, 1993<br/>
&quot;The first thing he said after “good morning” was “Mom, if you count to <br/>
infinity, is it illegal?”<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I explained to him about infinity, with a million plus one and a <br/>
“gadillion” plus one.  He was fine with the explanation, and I said, “Who <br/>
told you you can’t count to infinity?”  He said I did, so I explained the <br/>
difference in things that are impossible and things that are illegal (have <br/>
consequences).&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807504253">We have had many, many &quot;infinity&quot; conversations in our house. The other day, <br/>
Casey asked me what eternal meant exactly. I described it like this:&quot;as <br/>
infinity is to numbers, eternal is to time&quot;. Those eternal questions about <br/>
inifinity paid off. She understood immediately.<br/>
