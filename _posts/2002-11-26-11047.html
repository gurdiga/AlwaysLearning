<div id="ygrps-yiv-555475208"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Be comfortable with tears, with sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t tell you the number of times I&#39;ve heard people say<br/>
&gt;they didn&#39;t want to bring up the death or loss because they<br/>
&gt;&quot;might make the person cry&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;As if not talking about it helped. What happens is the<br/>
&gt;person that is grieving feels isolated and cut off from their<br/>
&gt;friends. Because the friends are uncomfortable with tears so<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t call anymore, or don&#39;t talk openly about the loss.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The best kind of friend is fine with your tears.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This conversation reminds me of a conversation I had on the<br/>
phone with my oldest daughters boyfriend this past June. <br/>
<br/>
My dh and I were on our way back home (Helena, MT) from<br/>
Seattle. Running late we called home from Spokane and one of<br/>
our son&#39;s said we had to call Amy, so we did. <br/>
<br/>
She had just gotten back home after emergency surgery for a<br/>
tubal pregnancy, she was naturally crying, which was good. <br/>
<br/>
I spoke with her boyfriend and asked him how he was, of course<br/>
he said he was fine!  <br/>
<br/>
Then I said to him, don&#39;t stop my daughter from crying, she<br/>
has to get this out. Hold her in your arms all night long and<br/>
listen to her cry. He said, okay. <br/>
<br/>
When we got off the phone he apparently asked Amy how I knew<br/>
that he had been telling her to stop crying!<br/>
<br/>
As humans we are not comfortable with tears and crying. Look<br/>
at how we treat newborn babies, plug their mouths with<br/>
pacifiers and patting their backs, saying Sshhh and rocking<br/>
them all to be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all for rocking and snuggling, etc... but all my babies<br/>
were allowed to cry while I held them and listened.<br/>
<br/>
There is an art to listening!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love in...<br/>
