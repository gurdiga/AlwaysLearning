<br/>
Pursuing unschooling is an intellectual thing.  Talking and thinking<br/>
about education and the way people learn and live, is pretty<br/>
intellectual.<br/>
<br/>
This little bit was from Wikipedia (love Wikipedia!):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some intellectuals have been vehemently anti-academic; at times<br/>
universities and their faculties have been synonymous with<br/>
intellectualism, but in other periods and some places the centre of<br/>
gravity of intellectual life has been elsewhere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That would suggest that intellectual pursuits aren&#39;t the exclusive<br/>
property of schools.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What does it mean to be &quot;anti-intellectual&quot;? Is it the same as &quot;anti-<br/>
&gt; school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so.  The way that I see anti-intellectualism is; not being<br/>
elitist, but also, not allowing for thought expansion.  Thought that<br/>
deviates from typical life and understanding, is always frowned upon by<br/>
those that fear those thoughts.  People who don&#39;t like thinking outside<br/>
the box, who fear change and ideas would be anti-intellectual, and you<br/>
find a lot of those folks deeply entrenched in school (and religion).<br/>
<br/>
The way that schools have evolved, it seems more synonymous with<br/>
anti-intellectual, than the other way around!  The fact that individual<br/>
thought is not highly prized, and that common thought is preferred would<br/>
suggest that schools are very anti-intellectual!</div>

can certainly understand it - we&#39;re throwing out the schooling and the <br/>
connection between intellectualism and schooling is quite strong.<br/>
<br/>
But, I have one daughter who is VERY intellectual. We just had dinner <br/>
together and she spent the entire time giving me a detailed run-down on <br/>
Alexander Hamilton&#39;s economic plan for the US after the American <br/>
revolution. She loves critical analysis of literature. She soaks it up - <br/>
her eyes shine - she finds it hard to believe that I might just want to <br/>
read a book and be happy with that, not want to delve deeply into it and <br/>
consider all the symbolism and connections to world events and so on. <br/>
She&#39;s a TRUE intellectual - it has nothing to do with schooling at all. <br/>
She&#39;s a person who savors the use of her intellect to analyze, discuss, <br/>
learn about events or materials that are typically the subjects of focus <br/>
in a school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387565123">-=-Do you think unschoolers have a bias against intellectualism?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have a bias against people who consider themselves intellectuals.    <br/>
I don&#39;t have a bias against someone actually BEING intellectual. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
The latter is much rarer than the first.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-Are &quot;intellectual pursuits&quot; the exclusive property of schools,  <br/>
for instance?-=-<br/>
<br/>
No.  There are schools with very little intellectual pretension or  <br/>
actuality.  Then there are schools with lots of intellectualism.   <br/>
There are intellectuals outside of the teaching profession, too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What does it mean to be &quot;anti-intellectual&quot;?-=-<br/>
<br/>
In some actual instances in which that claim has been made, it&#39;s  <br/>
sometimes because someone came and tried to bypass actually showing  <br/>
unschooling experience or understanding by flashing a badge at us (a  <br/>
PhD in education, a couple of times; a master&#39;s degree in psychology  <br/>
or education or whatever other times).  Sometimes I was a moderator  <br/>
and said (as I would have in a public meeting, had I been a  <br/>
facilitator or organizer of a meeting) shhh..... wait.  Get your name  <br/>
on the list and we&#39;ll get to you.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people who haven&#39;t been allowed to cut the line because they  <br/>
were &quot;superior&quot; in the discussion thought up an explanation.  It  <br/>
couldn&#39;t have been their presumption or rudeness; it must have been my  <br/>
bias.<br/>
<br/>
I think in twelve or thirteen years it&#39;s probably happened half a  <br/>
dozen times.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is it the same as &quot;anti-school?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
For some people I suppose it is.  My personal bias isn&#39;t anti-school.   <br/>
I really enjoyed school, and I learned TONS in college.<br/>
<br/>
-=And what do you think would be the opposite of &quot;anti- <br/>
intellectualism&quot;?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Pro-intellectualism.<br/>
Intellectualism-ism. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;intellectualism&quot; divides learning into professional,  <br/>
important learning, and low-class, half-assed, insignificant learning.<br/>
<br/>
There is intellectualism that specializes in obfuscational jargon.    <br/>
When all the scaffolding is simplified (IF it can be simplified) the  <br/>
ideas are small and common.  There are profound ideas that can be  <br/>
stated in simple words.    I much prefer good ideas in simple language  <br/>
to long reports intended only for small, critical committees of those  <br/>
who certify future intellectuals.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen and read things by philosophers who seemed to have no  <br/>
personal philosophy, nor to have any idea that any such thing would be  <br/>
useful or desirable, but they can sure quote dead German guys.    It  <br/>
can be like a game, like quoting Monty Python and Shakespeare for the  <br/>
sake of intimidating the others in the room who might try to keep up  <br/>
but someone will eventually concede.  And the effect on the outside  <br/>
world was zip.  Nothing.  It was intellectual jackoff.  No one&#39;s life  <br/>
was made better.  No new ideas were spawned.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing happens sometimes with professional journals.  Some people  <br/>
need to publish.  They write something that finally squeaks by; the  <br/>
editors or committee members can&#39;t find any reason to reject this  <br/>
fourth or sixth attempt so they finally let one through.  It&#39;s kind of  <br/>
like school, because in a very real way is IS school, at that level.<br/>
<br/>
I used to want to stay in school my whole life--teaching, taking more  <br/>
classes, maybe being a professor.  Having an office in the English  <br/>
department, and unlimited library privileges.  Never being out in the  <br/>
real world, ever.  Heaven!   In some such cases there&#39;s  <br/>
intellectualism or self-actualization or both.   In some, it&#39;s stunted  <br/>
development, a desire to prove oneself, to keep getting grades and  <br/>
recognition, to be superior, to bypass social realities by pointing to  <br/>
a paper in a frame on the wall.  I&#39;m anti-that, especially when one  <br/>
brings it into an unschooling discussion.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it means fear of anything that smacks of thinking.  Maybe that&#39;s<br/>
it ... most of the time.  Probably because thinking has somehow been made<br/>
the domain of school for people who fear thinking.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m trying to come up with other instances that wouldn&#39;t somehow involve<br/>
fear and I haven&#39;t come up with any but there may be many... Oh! wait).<br/>
Avoiding any show of emotion at all times with everyone appears<br/>
anti-intellectual to me (as well as counter-productive to interpersonal<br/>
relationships).  Actually I take that back, since it&#39;s possible to be<br/>
intellectual while also being weak in the skills for relating<br/>
interpersonally.  And it may or may not involve fear.<br/>
<br/>
Also one can be conditioned somewhat not to think, by systematically giving<br/>
negative feedback to thinking that counters a way of life.  Like religious<br/>
doctrine, political ideals, cultural modes in school and at work, and things<br/>
of that nature.  Taken to extremes, I think of these as frequently<br/>
anti-intellectual and almost always the desire to promote the dominant line<br/>
of thought is an expression of fear.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I would not call &quot;anti-intellectual&quot;  --- fishing for response<br/>
by throwing out an idea that isn&#39;t conclusive.  I was kinda asking about<br/>
that when I put in a recent question about whether or not to correct our<br/>
children, or when or if it&#39;s appropriate and so forth.  I got some feedback<br/>
(to my idea fishing for responses) the same way that Karl gets feedback when<br/>
testing his idea in the little &quot;lagoon&quot; of whatever audience he has (me and<br/>
his dad usually).  The responses to my post were helpful to my further<br/>
thinking about correction.<br/>
<br/>
Put an inconclusive thought in a question format (or leave it as a<br/>
statement-- doesn&#39;t matter), and you&#39;ve got much of what learning is about,<br/>
what making experiments is about (that&#39;s a hypothesis) not just what school<br/>
and tests and grades are about.  This behavior is *not* what I would call<br/>
anti-intellectual.  It&#39;s a natural part of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Schools discourage this kind of thinking, opting instead to give grades for<br/>
coming up with answers that match the test key.  The very thing I want to<br/>
avoid doing as a parent unschooling my child.<br/>

<br/>
I have a friend who considers himself entirely intellectual and he has  <br/>
said that he doesn&#39;t like arguing with me because I use emotional  <br/>
arguments.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t like arguing with me  because he loses, but I had the  <br/>
interpersonal skills not to slam him to the mat with that one, at that  <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
He likes to think that logic is everything; numbers are the only proof  <br/>
of any point.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s someone newer in my life with those traits, but he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
mind arguing with me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
If someone is not an intellectual, should we be focussing on  <br/>
remediating the situation? I don&#39;t think so. For me, I value  <br/>
intellectualism, but I wouldn&#39;t try to force that on anyone in my  <br/>
family. Each person has their own strengths and interests.<br/>

was more valid than an interest in gaming, for instance. That somehow  <br/>

cap.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the opposite side of this coin is the idea that reaching the  <br/>
level cap is preferable to learning algebra. Maybe that&#39;s what the  <br/>

I think this is one thing that makes unschooling look anti- <br/>
intellectual, but it&#39;s not the only thing.  It seems there are several  <br/>
places where the anti-intellectual charge is made.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been big on Gardner&#39;s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, and that  <br/>
might be the crowbar that moves &quot;intellectualism&quot; out of its  <br/>
traditional position of superiority.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, since I was the one who made the comment, I can clarify that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t meant to privilege any interest or passion over another.<br/>
<br/>
What I observed was an effort to shut down lots of potential interests <br/>
because they looked too &quot;schooly.&quot; That&#39;s what I was labeling <br/>
&quot;anti-intellectualism&quot; on the part of some unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I have a math phobia, so that&#39;s something I&#39;ve worked hard not to pass <br/>
onto my kids. Part of that has been an effort to bring lots of numbers <br/>
play into their lives because language play comes naturally to me, but <br/>
numbers, not so much. There&#39;s one game called Countdown--a version of an <br/>
old game where you roll the dice, do the math, and be the first to flip <br/>
up wooden numbered paddles. I was talking about it once at a local <br/>
unschoolers group where I used to live and got told that bringing that <br/>
game into the house was like bringing curriculum into the house and that <br/>
it wasn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; unschooling, which would trust kids to come to numbers <br/>
naturally in the world around them and to ask if they wanted something <br/>
more than that in the same way they might ask to take guitar or piano, <br/>
for instance.<br/>
<br/>
That, to me, was an example of anti-intellectualism that I was talking <br/>
about--an active attempt on the parents&#39; part to keep &quot;schooly&quot; things <br/>
out of their kids lives. And I&#39;ve seen it other times and in other ways <br/>
over the years on the lists as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think it very much could be a part of the deschooling process on the <br/>
part of the parents, but I think sometimes it&#39;s worse than that--I think <br/>
sometimes the parents themselves have stopped valuing thinking and <br/>
inquisitiveness about topics that are perceived as the property of <br/>
academics because they&#39;ve been damaged by school and have yet to heal. I <br/>
think that damage can shut down the kids&#39; intellectual curiosity in <br/>
potentially damaging ways as well.<br/>
<br/>
I know people who won&#39;t even look at games marked &quot;educational&quot; or <br/>
wouldn&#39;t even consider bringing things that look educational or could be <br/>
construed as curricula material into the house. That&#39;s a shame, imo, and <br/>
no better than a parent who wouldn&#39;t have a tv or allow video games into <br/>
the house.<br/>
<br/>
Jim brought home a periodic table of the elements magnet that he got <br/>
from a vendor at a conference. He stuck it on our fridge, and the kids <br/>
eventually asked about it. They loved hearing about it, still do. Now, <br/>
we have a big poster of it, along with a different kind of one for <br/>
geology and minerals. We hang up all those cool posters that National <br/>
Geographic sends because they&#39;re cool and interesting to ponder once in <br/>
a while.<br/>
<br/>
These are the kinds of things that might get sidelong looks from certain <br/>
unschoolers as not being very unschooly materials to have around. I <br/>
don&#39;t value these materials any more than the huge bucket of Polly <br/>
Pockets or Bratz or Scooby Doo movies or Gamecube games, or all the <br/>
other things that we&#39;ve also invested in over the years. I don&#39;t value <br/>
Em doing Algebra more than I value her playing Webkinz or drawing or <br/>
reading graphic novels. I think it&#39;s awesome that she loves to do ALL of <br/>
that, and I see each and every one of those things as learning materials <br/>
in my kids&#39; world.<br/>

<br/>
For people whose kids were in school, it&#39;s probably good not to do  <br/>
things like that in the first few months.   My kids were never in  <br/>
school and they had lots of &quot;math games.&quot;  Because I didn&#39;t &quot;require&quot;  <br/>
or push them as more important than other games they had, they played  <br/>
them just as happily as anything else.  I didn&#39;t have them with the  <br/>
attitude that they would learn math *that* way, just that if they  <br/>
found math in fun ways and not classroom ways they might not have the  <br/>
aversion I grew to have.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between what I was doing and what some other parents  <br/>
might have done with the same set of materials was subtle.  I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
praising more for my kids playing those than for them playing games  <br/>
based more on words or history or stamina or aim or balance.<br/>
<br/>
  I didn&#39;t consider Treasure Mountain, Treasure Math Storm, Bazaar and  <br/>
rummy to be &quot;intellectual.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Well, since I was the one who made the comment, I can clarify that it<br/>

<br/>
There were people making the comment in unschooling discussions before  <br/>
you had kids, so you can&#39;t explain all of their prejudices and  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t need to try.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That, to me, was an example of anti-intellectualism that I was  <br/>
talking<br/>
about--an active attempt on the parents&#39; part to keep &quot;schooly&quot; things<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s crucial to deschooling.   Even with families whose kids never  <br/>
went to school, the parents themselves need to deschool, and if the  <br/>
parents keep schooly/academic things there with the idea that they&#39;re  <br/>
crucial, the parents haven&#39;t deschooled themselves.  If the parents  <br/>
can be confident that learning can and does happen in the absence of  <br/>
academic things, then the re-addition of those things (in my case from  <br/>
leaving them out but not &quot;assigning&quot; or glorifying them, which I  <br/>
called strewing when people asked me how I had gotten my kids  <br/>
interested in those things, or in any things)...   the readdition of  <br/>
academic resources won&#39;t seem schooly.<br/>
<br/>
There is schooly and there are academic things, and they&#39;re not the  <br/>
same thing, but the difference has to do with attitude, presentation  <br/>
and expectation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think it very much could be a part of the deschooling process on  <br/>
the<br/>
part of the parents, but I think sometimes it&#39;s worse than that--I think<br/>
sometimes the parents themselves have stopped valuing thinking and<br/>
inquisitiveness about topics that are perceived as the property of<br/>
academics because they&#39;ve been damaged by school and have yet to heal. I<br/>
think that damage can shut down the kids&#39; intellectual curiosity in<br/>
potentially damaging ways as well.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching, my students were 12 to 15 years old.  I love that  <br/>
age.  Many teachers don&#39;t.  They either want kids new to school, or  <br/>
high school kids they can threaten with the lack of graduation.   I  <br/>
liked the mid-kids because they appreciated interesting teaching (some  <br/>
of them), and they were hormonally suited for cognitive blossoms of  <br/>
various sorts.  Their thoughts and perceptions were unfolding in big  <br/>
ways.   Some of them had parents who despised schools and teachers.   <br/>
Some of those kids were sunk, because if they did poorly in school  <br/>
their parents were angry and if they did well in school (or came to  <br/>
LIKE school), the parents belittled them for that too.<br/>
<br/>
Are there unschooling parents who hate school and were damaged by it?   <br/>
There are many.  Are there people who are unschooling because they  <br/>
liked school and supported it and then were shocked by horrible damage  <br/>
inflicted on their children.  Thousands of them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know people who won&#39;t even look at games marked &quot;educational&quot; or<br/>
wouldn&#39;t even consider bringing things that look educational or could be<br/>
construed as curricula material into the house. That&#39;s a shame, imo, and<br/>
no better than a parent who wouldn&#39;t have a tv or allow video games into<br/>
the house.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Although I&#39;ve always had both kinds of things, I don&#39;t agree with your  <br/>
closing point there.  A TV doesn&#39;t tempt a parent to relax into  <br/>
schoolish expectations.   Video games don&#39;t remind ANY parent of their  <br/>
school days, even if the video game is Zoombinis.  Once the parents  <br/>
see the learning from those things, the other things won&#39;t be  <br/>
dangerous.  If the parents don&#39;t come to see it, the other materials  <br/>
will be a foot in the school.<br/>
<br/>
We have a periodic chart of the elements.  It lives in the bathroom  <br/>
part time.  At the moment, there are laminated summaries of  <br/>
terminology and principles from psychology and anthropology, because  <br/>
Holly&#39;s thinking about studying dreams and memory, and Marty&#39;s  <br/>
girlfriend is an anthropology student at the university, studying  <br/>
genetics.  Holly&#39;s boyfriend has a genetics degree.   I figured some  <br/>
of that terminology might be good to have lying around.   They&#39;re not  <br/>
the only reading material in the bathroom.  Sometimes they seem to  <br/>
have been pulled out, but I&#39;m reading them more than anyone, probably,  <br/>
because I studied anthropology and psychology in the 70&#39;s, and they&#39;ve  <br/>
both moved much more toward biology than they were then.   I&#39;m  <br/>
&quot;behind&quot;! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think calling elementary-level academic materials &quot;intellectual&quot;  <br/>
isn&#39;t a good use of the term &quot;intellectual.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might help to go back to the basic &quot;learning.&quot;   Will people limit  <br/>
the avenues for learning for 18 whole years?<br/>
Not if they want to be good unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Will they limit them early on?<br/>
Maybe, some of them, if they want to become good unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26843100">I went back to the original post because I thought of another angle,  <br/>
and I see that it was about a single recent incident and not about the  <br/>
past many years.  Sorry I misunderstood that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Something came up on the list the other day about anti- <br/>
intellectualism<br/>
among unschoolers. It&#39;s been rolling around in my head ever since.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a more general question about the regular charge of  <br/>
anti-intellectualism.<br/>
<br/>
So I want to tell some of the other stories I remember.<br/>
<br/>
One person got in a huff because she was advised to read critically,  <br/>
to think objectively.  She assured the list/forum (I think it was at  <br/>
unschooling.com&#39;s message board or list) that critical thinking was  <br/>
something they taught in school, and she was surprised to have  <br/>
unschoolers recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
Fairly recently someone said (where I was and behind my back somewhere  <br/>
else in a discussion) that I probably had a house devoid of books,  <br/>
which inspired me to videotape my office and the library.  That didn&#39;t  <br/>
include the books on TV and movies on the shelf in the den, or the  <br/>
long shelf of sewing books in the sewing room, or the four shelves of  <br/>
cookbooks in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
There have been people over the years who tried to say that IF a  <br/>
family would have a child in a music or theatre class or a martial  <br/>
arts or equestrian class, they were hypocritical if they objected to  <br/>
reading or math classes.  I&#39;ve suggested to some of them that they  <br/>
should read the story &quot;Pigs is Pigs,&quot; but y&#39;know... that&#39;s used in  <br/>
language arts and logic classes, so what kind of hypocrite am I!?   <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Also, the attitude toward the child becomes the main focus of  <br/>
that story when unschoolers read it, which can&#39;t be helped.<br/>
<br/>
Another possible aspect of the anti-intellectual gem is related to  <br/>
conferences.  There is an undertone of &quot;I don&#39;t go to hear the  <br/>
speakers&quot; related to conferences.  Sometimes people take pride in the  <br/>
fact (whether it&#39;s a fact or not, it&#39;s been stated) that they go to  <br/>
conferences just to see the other families, and they don&#39;t go to the  <br/>
presentations.  They might run funshops but they won&#39;t go to hear  <br/>
speakers.<br/>
<br/>
That, in part, spawned &#39;non-coms&#39; which were speaker-free.<br/>
<br/>
Some people seem to take pride in not being on discussion lists or  <br/>
reading much online.  They come, &quot;Discover&quot; unschooling, go home and  <br/>
do it oddly and inefficiently, and then come back and complain that we  <br/>
didn&#39;t explain it right.  Am I anti- or pro-intellectual by suggesting  <br/>
that they should&#39;ve stuck around and kept reading something every day  <br/>
and participated in lists?  Not everyone enjoys the flowing word as I  <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps in ALL those cases to think more in terms of clarity,  <br/>
understanding and learning than of any larger or secondary words.   We  <br/>
don&#39;t need &quot;academics&quot;; we need learning.   We don&#39;t need &quot;intellect&quot;;  <br/>
we need thought and the consideration of ideas.<br/>

<br/>
To me it seems that the parent&#39;s attitude surrounding any type of<br/>
material, schooly, semi schooly or non schooly, can make strewing<br/>
material harmful or beneficial to children.  Some people could bring<br/>
in anime or comics and convey a schooling emphasis through that<br/>
material because they are worried that the kids won&#39;t or can&#39;t learn<br/>
without direct guidance.  (One example is the guy who agreed to let<br/>
his teen son drop school in order to watch and critique films with the<br/>
dad, films which the dad chose ... entertainment a.k.a. education).<br/>
<br/>
I think strewing materials ---and making sure to leave up to the<br/>
children the preference for any information those materials contain---<br/>
makes it possible for them to learn in freedom from anything.<br/>
<br/>
That means having a variety of materials, some vaguely schooly, some<br/>
not  traditionally considered schooly, and yes, some actually marketed<br/>
as educational, which the internet is full of.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of deschooling is realizing that filtering the<br/>
information is not what you want nor is it really feasible once the<br/>
kids are on the internet.  Karl plays tons of schooly games on<br/>
NickJr.com.  Whose choice would it be to label such things schooly or<br/>
bar him from it?  He likes NickJr (although he doesn&#39;t play there near<br/>
as often as he used to).  All that &quot;good jobbing, good clapping, good<br/>
clicking&quot; (ugh) doesn&#39;t seem to faze him.  He doesn&#39;t take it to heart<br/>
as he would were it to come from me or Brian.<br/>
<br/>
Karl gets the choice of how long he plays and which links he clicks<br/>
and how much in depth he gets into any of those schooly sites.  The<br/>
same goes for youtube, where if a video is boring or weird or in some<br/>
way not interesting to him, he clicks a toolbar button which I set up<br/>
for the purpose of him getting back to his youtube favorites page, a<br/>
home base sorta.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing harmful about repeating a sequence in a movie or an<br/>
educational computer game as many times as a child likes ...  because<br/>
when a child is done with a repetition, it&#39;s easy to go on to<br/>
something else if the option is available.  For instance, in Karl&#39;s<br/>
latest DS game aquistion, Yoshi&#39;s Island at the moment, he skips right<br/>
over coin collection (one repetition) in favor of getting goals and<br/>
perfecting moves (other kinds of repetition).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can certainly understand it - we&#39;re throwing out the schooling and the<br/>
&gt; connection between intellectualism and schooling is quite strong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My parents are strong intellectuals.  They associate it with school and<br/>
academics.  My sister homeschools, and my parents approve highly of all<br/>
the classical education and intellectual stuff that my sister forces<br/>
onto her kids.  They all know that I don&#39;t do that.  It&#39;s not that I<br/>
don&#39;t value &quot;classical&quot; education or knowledge, it&#39;s that I don&#39;t find<br/>
value in forcing that onto my kids.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter met a kid that she had a lot in common with.  My mom<br/>
recognized right away that this kid was homeschooled and highly<br/>
intellectual.  She said something about how Chamille and this kid might<br/>
get along for a while, but that because Chamille isn&#39;t very<br/>
intellectual, the relationship probably wouldn&#39;t last because the other<br/>
kid might get bored talking about &quot;trivial&quot; stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille isn&#39;t what someone would call intellectual.  On the surface,<br/>
she&#39;s all about her artistic expression.  What I find really interesting<br/>
though, about people like my daughter, in general, when you get to know<br/>
them, they are often much more perseptive about the world than their<br/>
&quot;intellectual&quot; counterparts.  That perception, I&#39;ve come to understand,<br/>
is a very deep inward intellectual analysis of everything.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
look like book knowledge though, so it often doesn&#39;t count in the eyes<br/>
of people like my mother who really truly believes that book learning is<br/>
the be all end all.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has a lot of brilliant insights to things that a lot of people<br/>
miss.  She&#39;s not going to spout it off though, and a lot of people that<br/>
meet her really don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; her because she&#39;s not transparent with her<br/>
thoughts and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t consider her an anti-intellectual.  I think she really<br/>
does value knowledge, she just doesn&#39;t show it.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a home that was very intellectual.  Family dinners were<br/>
often platforms for political and philisophical discourse with strong<br/>
opinions argued logically.  I grew to have a love/hate relationship with<br/>
that and rejected it outright for many years, very reactionary!  I don&#39;t<br/>
want that for my kids.  I really really want them to value knowledge,<br/>
happily value knowledge and the acquisition of it.  I honestly don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s something that can be forced, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My sister&#39;s kids are forced.  They do value intellectual pursuits. <br/>
Mostly they are happy.  They like the positive adult feedback from those<br/>
pursuits.  One day, one of them will have a differing opinion than mom,<br/>
dad, or their grandparents.  When that day comes, there will be trouble.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I was separating &quot;academic&quot;  from &quot;intellectual&quot; in my response. <br/>
Intellectual seems like it implies a life focused on things happening in <br/>
the intellect, as opposed to focused on physical activity or emotional <br/>
or spiritual stuff. I don&#39;t consider Rosie or Roya to be &quot;intellectuals&quot; <br/>
because Rosie&#39;s focus is on physical activity (karate, soccer, American <br/>
Sign Language, dance) and Roya&#39;s is on art, crafts, and organizing <br/>
people doing activities together. Roya has a college degree and is <br/>
moving toward grad school - her goal is to get a clinical counseling <br/>
degree in art therapy. VERY academic, but not intellectual.  Rosie is <br/>
taking college courses - considering pursuing a degree in ASL, again, <br/>
academic but not intellectual. Roxana, on the other hand, wants to learn <br/>
and analyze and critique ideas - ideas from literature and drama and <br/>
history, mostly. That&#39;s what she loves - it is what makes her eyes light <br/>
up. It is intellectual activity whether or not it involves academic <br/>
activity. For years she was an intellectual who had no involvement in <br/>
academia. She&#39;d read and write and discuss (mostly online with other <br/>
intellectuals) all kinds of what I consider &quot;high-brow&quot; materials.Not <br/>
for grades, not for credit. For fun.She&#39;d like to be able to continue to <br/>
do this with other intellectuals and (hopefully) make a living at it - <br/>
that happens in universities, mostly, so that&#39;s probably where she&#39;s <br/>
headed.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m making too fine a distinction between these words, but it has <br/>
been useful for me to be aware of a difference between academic and <br/>
intellectual in supporting my own children&#39;s interests.<br/>

I think it&#39;s helpful to figure out how to breathe easy without having<br/>
anything remotely academic around to bolster your confidence in the learning<br/>
your children are going through just by living.  Until at least the parent<br/>
who is usually with the kids can more clearly see the learning in<br/>
everything, having educational materials per se could easily prevent being<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t mean this as anti-intellectual ....  I&#39;m saying it as pro-relational<br/>
and pro-family.  Without joy, it&#39;s harder for me to see the learning.   I<br/>
guess my deschooling difficulties lie elsewhere at the moment, and I want to<br/>
put more focus on joy right now.  They had that song about &quot;love and<br/>
marriage go together like a horse and carriage&quot; and sub the words &quot;love and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849522731">I think too that those of us that started out trying to educate our kids at home didn&#39;t start with a natural learning philosophy, but developed it over time. As we realized that the children we were trying to pour information into were built with their own passions, ideas, and ways of learning.  Some of us even had children who were violently apposed to forced learning and rejected suggested learning.  So short of having world war two re-enactments around the diningroom table we chose to listen to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Makes for a larger non-intellectual subject base as the highly academic minded are often sponges for information and do well with a planned curric.  If your control group is skewed in the first place....   Also many people in school  play at being intellectuals in order to win in the game of school.  I&#39;m not sure many studies take that into consideration.<br/>
<br/>
And some of us parents are still recooping from our time in the institutions and can&#39;t bare to be/encourage being too intellectual with the kids.   In conversation with non unschoolers we often take a position of anti-forced learning which is counter intuitive to intellectualism for many people. Who believe you need to chain them to their desks in order for them to have a hope of becoming as smart, well versed, knowledgeable, or well educated as they are because that is what was done to them.  Seems like a huge unnecessary risk for many who choose to participate in these debates as they see the results in themselves and feel that proves the method works.  They don&#39;t realize that a large portion of those kids in school who just didn&#39;t cope well or get anywhere in life were as intellegent or more so, but do to not being able to fit in the school mold were deemed failures (usually in early elementary) only because they couldn&#39;t squeeze themselves into<br/>
 the rigid space provided.<br/>

regularly, and they can&#39;t possibly help themselves, then removing all <br/>
overtly educational stuff from the kids&#39; lives is one tool to get <br/>
parents to see the learning that goes on in absolutely everything the <br/>
kids do. And sure, it can be an expedient tool, but I personally think <br/>
that recommendation should come with some caveats--along the lines, <br/>
maybe, Kelly Lovejoy&#39;s three stages article.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Although I&#39;ve always had both kinds of things, I don&#39;t agree with your<br/>
&gt; closing point there. A TV doesn&#39;t tempt a parent to relax into<br/>
&gt; schoolish expectations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think tv can tempt a parent into laziness. I think there are parents <br/>
who could be offering bigger and broader opportunities for their kids, <br/>
but who don&#39;t and then offer up unschooling as an excuse.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Video games don&#39;t remind ANY parent of their<br/>
&gt; school days, even if the video game is Zoombinis. Once the parents<br/>
&gt; see the learning from those things, the other things won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; dangerous. If the parents don&#39;t come to see it, the other materials<br/>
&gt; will be a foot in the school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are computer games like Clue Finders that are overtly educational <br/>
and could easily provide a parent with a foot in the school door an easy <br/>
way to feel good about video games. I know lots of parents who will only <br/>
allow these kinds of learning games and none of the others. So while <br/>
they may not remind us of our school days, they can serve to separate <br/>
the world into school and not-school.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think calling elementary-level academic materials &quot;intellectual&quot;<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t a good use of the term &quot;intellectual.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re meaning in terms of &quot;elementary-level academic <br/>
materials.&quot; I think intellect is developmental--whatever challenges <br/>
one&#39;s intellect at whatever age is an intellectual pursuit for that <br/>
person. Mazes, video games, etc. can all be intellectually challenging <br/>
as can analyzing a tv show, movie, or advertisement. Intellect doesn&#39;t <br/>
always look academic.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seemed like you were at first using intellectual pretty much to mean <br/>
academic in that first post - that&#39;s why I made the same point as you&#39;re <br/>
making in the above paragraph. Intellectual is not the same as <br/>
academic/schooly.<br/>
<br/>
Danielle***&quot;What I observed was an effort to shut down lots of potential <br/>
interests because they looked too &quot;schooly.&quot; That&#39;s what I was labeling <br/>
&quot;anti-intellectualism&quot; on the part of some unschoolers.***<br/>
<br/>
I also think there is sometimes an overly anti-intellectual tone to some <br/>
unschooling discussions. I don&#39;t think it is that people are <br/>
discouraging their children from using their intellects to think about <br/>
tv shows or video games, though. I think it is that intellectual <br/>
pursuits are viewed suspiciously because they are so strongly <br/>
associated  with academia. Maybe it would be more clear to say that <br/>
anything that seems &quot;scholarly&quot; is viewed with suspicion and negativity <br/>
by some unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater - is that <br/>
what you&#39;re getting at? Yes, we are tossing out the schooling - the <br/>
assignments, the lesson plans, the grading, the testing, the assessing, <br/>
the coercion, and all those other trappings of school. For some people <br/>
that means throwing out anything that is associated in their minds with <br/>
school and that can include anything that is intentionally designed to <br/>
support learning, especially if it is to support learning something that <br/>
is conventionally taught in schools. The &quot;Countdown&quot; game is a good <br/>
example. It is okay for kids to play Magic, the Gathering, because that <br/>
was designed just for fun and it is irrelevant that kids who play it <br/>
also become really good at mentally adding and subtracting. But <br/>
Countdown is touted as helping kids learn math, so that is an <br/>
unschooling no-no?<br/>
<br/>
At a conference, Scott Noelle told a story of finding a cool old school <br/>
desk and having it sitting in his house and then being embarrassed by it <br/>
when unschooling friends saw it there. My kids didn&#39;t even get why he&#39;d <br/>
be embarrassed - took me a second to catch on. He thought that those <br/>
unschoolers would think there was something wrong with having an old <br/>
school desk in his house because it was associated with school.<br/>
<br/>
So, true or not, there are people who are getting the impression that <br/>
unschoolers go overboard in rejecting absolutely anything (even <br/>
furniture) that has any association with school.<br/>
<br/>
If that is what you&#39;re talking about, Danielle, then, yes, I think it is <br/>
good to discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember some people at a park day seeming a little horrified because <br/>
they&#39;d read that Sandra&#39;s daughter had been doing workbooks. (In the <br/>
bathtub, as I recall.) WORKBOOKS? Sandra Dodd&#39;s kids were allowed to <br/>
have workbooks? What? They just couldn&#39;t imagine it. How could it be <br/>
unschooling if a kid was doing a workbook? I don&#39;t remember what led to <br/>
Holly&#39;s workbook in the tub, but Rosie loved to get workbooks that were <br/>
related to whatever she was into at the time. When she was into Disney <br/>
princesses, she&#39;d want Disney princess coloring books, paper dolls, <br/>
paint-with-water books, and, yes, workbooks. They were puzzle books to <br/>
her. Neither of my other kids liked workbooks, but Rosie always liked <br/>
that kind of page-by-page kind of thing. She&#39;s 18 and she still buys <br/>
coloring books - the Bellerophon and Dover ones -  and she&#39;ll sit and <br/>
color and watch tv or talk, for hours.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people don&#39;t get past those &quot;how to get started&quot; unschooling <br/>
conversations. They take the sound bites away with them, but not the <br/>
deeper and bigger principles. So, that&#39;s part of the problem. Another <br/>
part is that there are people who hate school so much that they really <br/>
do want to avoid having anything in their lives that even remotely <br/>
reminds them of school. Another thing is that some people really ARE <br/>
anti-intellectual, not just anti-school. There always has been some <br/>
suspicion and distrust of more scholarly people by those who aren&#39;t like <br/>
that. And, there are those who take things to an extreme for other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what we can do about most of that - just keep being clear <br/>
in our own writing and speaking the best we can. I am more aware of this <br/>
whole tendency now and I&#39;m more aware of what I might say that might be <br/>
taken away and used as justification for it.<br/>
<br/>
I have the same feeling about the no bedtimes, no chores, no limits -- <br/>
all that stuff. People also carry that away and repeat sound bites and <br/>
take it to extremes that I, at least, never intended. So I&#39;m a lot more <br/>
careful and clear about how I talk about that stuff, these days. I can&#39;t <br/>
do much about how other people talk or behave, so I&#39;ve focused on myself <br/>
and doing what I can to dispel such attitudes or  misperceptions.<br/>

I don&#39;t have an attic or a basement, but there are antique books  <br/>
stored in some boxes in the sunroom, and old encyclopedias and lots of  <br/>
magazines in the metal shed, and there are books in Keith&#39;s office,  <br/>
but those are mostly his books (except my hymnals, 25 or so, which are  <br/>
there, and some other music books of mine, but I usually think of  <br/>
music as being in filing cabinets--three drawers of which are music- <br/>
related).<br/>
<br/>
If I had an attic, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d have books there.  If I had a  <br/>
basement, I think not because my friends in Salt Lake City had a  <br/>
basement flood and they lost books galore.<br/>

misleading. It might be: &quot;....feeding your kids nothing but sugary <br/>
sweets.&quot; Or it might be, &quot;...mom doing all the housework and nobody else <br/>
ever lifting a finger to help.&quot; Lots of misunderstandings. Someone said <br/>

about critical thinking and analysis and ideas and logic and <br/>
reasoning....and lots of people are uncomfortable with all that <br/>
intellectual stuff.  People complain about the lists as not being <br/>
supportive. The complainers are probably not those who like highly <br/>
intellectual pursuits. So - those of us here, participating, are biased <br/>
toward a more intellectual approach to unschooling. We are a <br/>
self-selected group. There are lots of unschoolers out there who don&#39;t <br/>
find these lists appealing at all. They do go to conferences and read <br/>
books, sometimes, but I&#39;m always surprised at how many people DO <br/>
unschool with very little to go on - they do it because it &quot;feels&quot; right <br/>
to them. But, that that makes ME uncomfortable is undoubtedly MY <br/>
intellectual bias showing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
