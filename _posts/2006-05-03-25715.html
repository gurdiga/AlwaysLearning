<div id="ygrps-yiv-787452643">Thanks, Sarah, for your lovely description of television watching.  I have a<br/>
sister who sends her kids to a Waldorf school and though she and her<br/>
children watch lots and lots of movies...still, something of that &quot;dissing<br/>
television stuff&quot; comes around to us, though I suspect that much of it is<br/>
just talk.  I have been up and down about television, partly because of the<br/>
Waldorf influence (they have some really scary ideas about what television<br/>
does to the minds of children...though my mind seems to work after growing<br/>
up with a fair amount of t.v....my mother thought it was the best thing to<br/>
come along to help her raise seven of us)...still, I worried.  Then I read<br/>
the article on dyslexia that was posted on Sandra&#39;s website (my youngest has<br/>
been labeled &quot;dyslexic&quot;) in which the writer said he learned tons from<br/>
watching the BBC...since then, we&#39;ve joined Netflix free for a month and<br/>
last night we all watched Patton and have ordered some other WW II<br/>
movies...my oldest (15) does an online Math program (ALECS) and he loves to<br/>
put on an old Andy Griffith video while he works on math...it gets him going<br/>
in the morning.  And I remembered that I always did my homework to<br/>
television at night and was an honor student.  Anyway, thanks again, Sarah,<br/>
for the honest portrayal of television in our lives.  &quot;The truth shall set<br/>
you free.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;and yet on Star Trek all the aliens look like  <br/>
people. &lt;g&gt;**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS  Remember there was a Star Trek alien that looked like a box full of<br/>
colored lights.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Medusa like creature.  There was one with winged bat like creatures that<br/>
were transparent.  One landed on Spock, and the only way to kill it was with<br/>
light.  They thought he had gone blind but he really had an extra set of<br/>
eyelids.  One where they had evolved into nothing but brains; they looked<br/>
like glowing colored rocks under a glass dome.  Hmmm.. I spent too much time<br/>
watching Star Trek and too little time with homework.<br/>

&gt; TV is right up there with politics and religion.  I<br/>
&gt; mean this topic elicits more questions than &quot;What<br/>
&gt; about church?&quot; in the unschooling community.  I think<br/>
&gt; even sugar is less of a hot topic than TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And it really cracks me up.  Because TV is like a<br/>
&gt; godsend around here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My girls really like to wake up slowly watching TV.<br/>
&gt; This is great for me because it gives me a chance to<br/>
&gt; drink my espresso, read the paper (still looking for a<br/>
&gt; dog), switch the laundry, maybe do a little pilates,<br/>
&gt; and generally prepare for the day.  A moment to clean<br/>
&gt; in the morning is great for me.  I feel ready to say<br/>
&gt; lots of yeses when I&#39;m not saying, &quot;Let me just slick<br/>
&gt; this up first.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TV often offers us a moment to reconnect.  I can sit<br/>
&gt; down with the girls and laugh out loud or ask what<br/>
&gt; shows they like and why.  Many, many great<br/>
&gt; conversations have happened because of this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have the sit and spin and a mini tramp and puzzles<br/>
&gt; and games and art projects and a computer and Lego&#39;s<br/>
&gt; and baby dolls and magazines and books in the same<br/>
&gt; room as one of our TVs...people rarely just sit<br/>
&gt; passively and watch TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It offers siblings a chance to do something together.<br/>
&gt; Or, it can get them apart!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of imaginative games and pretend play have ensued<br/>
&gt; due to an idea gleaned from a television program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve discovered new crafts, new recipes, art<br/>
&gt; activities and science projects...all from TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many new concepts have come to us via TV:  from<br/>
&gt; beginning reading for my almost three year old to the<br/>
&gt; study of physics and &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; for<br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Half the music I like I found from watching TV and<br/>
&gt; movies...either from soundtracks or music videos or<br/>
&gt; musical guests or TV concerts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband turns it on at bedtime for white noise.  He<br/>
&gt; has to wake up earlier than us and this drowns out our<br/>
&gt; sometimes loud sounds late at night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; TV (I&#39;m thinking parody here) has given us many ways<br/>
&gt; to laugh about situations that have the potential to<br/>
&gt; make me cry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The TV offers a connection to history and literature<br/>
&gt; and language and culture and differing opinions and<br/>
&gt; glimpses of remote parts of the world I will probably<br/>
&gt; never see in person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I like to watch shows from my childhood...it is a<br/>
&gt; connection.  My kids learn more about me from what I<br/>
&gt; watched and liked when I was younger.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve learned how to cook new foods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband, a busy, busy man, will actually sit with<br/>
&gt; us if we watch a show together, and he finds things<br/>
&gt; for him and the girls to watch together.  Major<br/>
&gt; bonding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When my kids are in a &quot;TV phase&quot;, I like to look at it<br/>
&gt; as a great opportunity for me to catch up on<br/>
&gt; housework, phone calls, a new craft, or my sleep :).<br/>
&gt; These don&#39;t last long so instead of worrying I take<br/>
&gt; full advantage!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It really adds to our never-ending list of questions.<br/>
&gt; The topics take us to the library and on field trips<br/>
&gt; and into new artistic endeavors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ooooh, and here&#39;s a really good one: TV topics are a<br/>
&gt; great conversation link between my kids and schooled<br/>
&gt; kids.  They can talk about favorite movies or shows or<br/>
&gt; actors or musicians.  These topics are much better<br/>
&gt; than, &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have been introduced to so many fun games and toys<br/>
&gt; because of the *gasp* advertisements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It gives me a cozy, tucked-in, home-from-school<br/>
&gt; feeling.  My kids don&#39;t really have that, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; sometimes they get a nest-y cozy feeling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It connects us generationally.  My kids can talk to<br/>
&gt; their grandparents about shows they mutually like and<br/>
&gt; they can watch them together.  My grandparents don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go to the skating rinks and sledding hills and zoos<br/>
&gt; with us, but they can watch Mary Poppins with my kids<br/>
&gt; and laugh and bond together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Mom had the TV on all the time.  She loved it.  But<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t remember her sitting and just watching very<br/>
&gt; often. She crocheted and cooked and cleaned.  And she<br/>
&gt; and I both read in front of the TV.  I read many a<br/>
&gt; book in front of the TV just to be near her.  I did<br/>
&gt; most of my homework in front of the TV (and did really<br/>
&gt; well according to their standards).  And it still<br/>
&gt; gives me a chance to knit and paint my toes and other<br/>
&gt; things I like to do with some noise on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And guess what, even though I have these feelings of<br/>
&gt; regard for the TV and tell my kids when their favorite<br/>
&gt; shows are on and get them lots of movies and offer to<br/>
&gt; go to lots of movies, they probably end up watching<br/>
&gt; the same amount of TV as some kids with TV limits<br/>
&gt; watch.  Because they *want* full lives and have many<br/>
&gt; interests and love the outdoors and art and<br/>
&gt; experiments and friends and going out to eat and well,<br/>
&gt; you get the idea.<br/>
