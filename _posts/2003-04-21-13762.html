<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014509555">Our family is possibly looking at a move to the north<br/>
western area of Chicago.  Can anyone tell me what the<br/>
laws and the unschooling climate is in that area.  My<br/>
husbands office would be in Huntley and I assume we<br/>
would locate anywhere west of that area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012909335">Hi Leslie<br/>
I&#39;m in the southwest suburbs of Chicago, but in Illinois, home schools are considered private schools. No mandatory tests, reports or monitoring. Here&#39;s a link that may help you find a support group in the NW suburbs <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.illinoishouse.org/index.html">http://www.illinoishouse.org/index.html</a><br/>

 </span></blockquote>Huntley is pretty far west of Chicago. If you email HOUSE, they will hook<br/>
you up with a local group - there&#39;s a McHenry county group that&#39;s pretty<br/>
active, I think. <br/>
<br/>
Illinois is homeschool paradise, so far.<br/>

Paula, keeping fingers crossed about that one</div>
