<div id="ygrps-yiv-973373721">There&#39;s a brief article in the Sept. issue of Readers Digest about David<br/>
Sibley. <br/>
Although he is not a homeschooler or and unschooler, it is a good story<br/>
about a life spent pursuing what one loves, and how a real passion can&#39;t<br/>
be ignored.<br/>
There is a too small bit about how he learned the songs of birds just by<br/>
reading a description and seeing a chart, quite amazing. <br/>
You can get a feel from this article about the times in his life that<br/>
were inspiring and important and not one of them involved school.<br/>
David Sibley wrote the very good birding books, The Sibley Guide to Birds<br/>
and The Sibley Guide to Bird Life and Behavior. <br/>
