<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144875156">This is the year that I want to shift from our long-time homeschooling style (eclectic --- primarily determined by me with input from kids, scheduled table time, but not textbook dominated, lots of me reading aloud) towards more of an unschooling approach.     I have four daughters, ages 15, 13, 12, 11.....plus four grown children ranging from 21 to 30 who were all homeschooled, two all the time and two for a few years.     Because homeschooling in an eclectic style has been what has gone on in our lives since we took our oldest out of school in 1988, I am, shall we put it mildly, somewhat stuck in my ways and we have a definite pattern of life.   All of these girls were adopted internationally at various ages, and they&#39;ve had some issues to work on in terms of adjusting to our family.    They&#39;re doing great in terms of attachment.     One has developmental delays and one has a congenital medical issue.    The other two are healthy and on target developmentally.     <br/>
<br/>
If I can pull myself to truly make the shift away from formal table time, how would you recommend I approach this with the girls?     We are currently spending the summer at our cottage in Canada, where we are on a definite vacation schedule (for us).      Three of the girls are still engaged in finishing their Saxon math books.    I am reading history non-fiction several days a week, as well as an evening read aloud of  novels.     The girls read several hours each day.  They bike, play in the lake, play some computer games, and watch a very little bit of tv.    We return to our Montana home at the beginning of September, and the assumption is that we&#39;ll get back in gear, with the regular structure.    That has been that I read fiction for about an hour after breakfast, the girls do table work until lunch with my being available to help them with anything.    They use a textbook for math and a grammar text or workbook.    They have history and science books (that I selected) to read individually.   After lunch I typically read science and/or history, or we watch a video (again, my selection).     The girls take dance almost every day during the week.    The ballet studio is BIG in their lives.    We also all take knitting classes once a week which have now become more of help for their projects with two ladies in a lovely knitting shop.    We go to the library once a week, and three of the girls carry out a stack of fiction.    The other girl says she never finds anything she likes, although she reads heavily from our home library.    <br/>
<br/>
I know that if I didn&#39;t schedule anything, life would seem much like it is this summer, which the girls all describe as &quot;vacation.&quot;    They would still read lots, although I&#39;m not sure if they would willingly make a switch to reading non-fiction because they&#39;ve relied on me for that.      I don&#39;t know if I should make some kind of announcement, along the lines of &quot;Let&#39;s just keep doing what we&#39;re doing this summer,&quot; or whether I should just not say anything and simply not schedule things as I have been doing.     <br/>
<br/>
I should add that the girls feel considerable pressure from all of their &quot;schooled&quot; friends.    They keep getting told all the same things that the older kids were told ---- &quot;You&#39;ll never go to college if you homeschool&quot; ---- even though their older, always homeschooled sister is in her final year at Smith College and their older, always homeschooled, brother went to a four year state college (Evergreen in Olympia, WA) without any problems.    When I&#39;ve t;ried to wean myself away from the schedule before, the girls have told me they prefer having a weekly list of things to accomplish. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s obvious to me that they are relying on me for structure, that they are relying on me to provide too much in the form of assigned reading and read aloud selections.     I have no problem with the read aloud.   To me, it&#39;s been great and I absolutely love that time of our day.    But I am bugged that they aren&#39;t finding their own interests,  and yet I recognize that I created this by the schedule I have imposed.      They all have come to depend on that schedule too much.     I would love it if our lives could continue as they have during the summer, with some artificially imposed structure (dance times, knitting classes, library trips), but I would love it if the girls would find their own interests to pursue, other than reading fiction.     <br/>
<br/>
So, what&#39;s the recommendation for how a long-time homeschooling family can make the shift to becoming unschoolers?     Do I talk to the kids about what I am thinking?     Do I move back to our house in September and just not schedule table time and plan a structured program of books for the girls to read on various non-fiction topics?     <br/>
<br/>
Thrown into all this mix is that our fifteen year old is developmentally delayed.   If she were in school she would clearly be labeled borderline retarded. She has a tremendous language processing disorder that is complicated by the fundamental developmental delay.    We adopted her (and her sisters) from China, and we have no medical history on the girls.   We strongly suspect that our 15 year old may have neurological problems stemming from either an accident or birth injury, or it is also possible that she may have fetal alcohol issues.    Whatever, the therapists we&#39;ve consulted have told us that it really doesn&#39;t matter what caused the developmental delays, we would be doing the same thing.   The recommendation we&#39;ve received has been to review, review, review.     She can&#39;t handle money or tell time.   She reads fairly well, but comprehension is absent.       She can&#39;t retell a story to save her life.    She is very aware of her learning difficulties, and she compensates by being very social and funny, but it is hard to be a 15 year old who clearly can&#39;t do some fundamentals.   I also have to limit her computer access because of her lack of judgment in terms of communicating with people in chat rooms.    She was getting online in the middle of the night, so we put a password on the computer to keep her off at night.    If she were of something remotely close to normal intelligence, I wouldn&#39;t have been as worried, but she is in many ways a perfect candidate for victimization.   I don&#39;t have any confidence that if I don&#39;t schedule work with her that she would be able to make any progress in the fundamentals (time, money).<br/>
<br/>

Do you watch movies with them?  Would they  like to watch more TV?   <br/>
Are they all doing these things together, as a group?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you get home you could say you want to wait a while before  <br/>
doing school stuff.  Maybe find things to do like cooking things you  <br/>
haven&#39;t made before, or starting a hobby besides knitting (in  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe do things just enough differently that you kind of wean  <br/>
yourself and them from the schedule or the expectations.  Saying &quot;The  <br/>

occasionally, things you find on unschooling sites.  Read aloud just  <br/>
something from Joyce&#39;s page, maybe, or something some of the teens  <br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t artificially imposed.  They&#39;re real (except the library,  <br/>
which could be more flexible).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t criticize or discourage their reading.<br/>

life-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then that&#39;s not really reading, but no matter.  Can she read street  <br/>
signs and menus?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same way for all kids.  If you&#39;re not on an  <br/>

So?  If she can&#39;t get it, she can&#39;t get it.  Do things she CAN  <br/>
understand and enjoy, and if she never understands time and money  <br/>
ever, she woudn&#39;t have with you &quot;scheduling work with her&quot; either.   <br/>
She&#39;ll probably catch on later, when she has a need to and something  <br/>

<br/>
First things first.  You can divvy up everything and compartmentalize your<br/>
children&#39;s learning to fit academic modes, so that you talk about reading<br/>
and comprehension.  You can unschool.  You can&#39;t do both.<br/>
<br/>
Not only is comprehension not retelling a story (as Sandra said) but<br/>
comprehension is not reading.  It&#39;s like logic, which in some people might<br/>
not develop a great deal and in others may develop quite a bit.  The brain<br/>
doesn&#39;t fully develop for logic type things until after high school in many<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I got the &quot;bad at comprehension&quot; thing all through high school, and am still<br/>
not good at telling stories aloud because I&#39;ve been criticized enough times<br/>
in school and elsewhere that I never found a venue for getting good at it.<br/>
Which is a dirty rotten shame, as I am nuts about stories.  I make a<br/>
fabulous audience for just about anyone&#39;s story... I&#39;m a sucker for those.<br/>
Don&#39;t ask me to tell one (except in writing) though I might occasionally get<br/>
brave enough to volunteer a few comments.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Comprehension is absent.&quot;  Ugh.  That&#39;s real close to saying someone is<br/>
stupid.  How do you know there&#39;s no comprehension?  Maybe you don&#39;t have the<br/>
same interpretation of the stuff she&#39;s reading.  ???!!!  Is it your<br/>
opinion?  Or are you repeating someone else&#39;s opinion?<br/>
<br/>
I said I&#39;m a sucker for almost anyone&#39;s story.  For really really long long<br/>
posts-- not so much.  I apologize for that.  I wish I had it in me to read<br/>
as incessantly as people write in a single post.  I used to write the same<br/>
way until I realized how hard it is to wade through lengthy massive posts.<br/>

and comprehension was another aspect that we got graded on.  In unschooling,<br/>

Yes.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s worth remembering, too, when relatives seem appalled that a  <br/>
child &quot;isn&#39;t reading&quot; at the age of eight, or whatever.  Many school- <br/>
kids aren&#39;t either, though they may be making good marks in &quot;reading&quot;  <br/>
because they&#39;re circling the right word or copying out the right  <br/>
sentence or reciting the same few lines other kids just recited, or  <br/>
phonetically sounding out a pre-chosen set of words designed to be  <br/>
words they can sound out with the sounds they&#39;ve just &quot;learned.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Beginning readers&#39; books aren&#39;t real English in the wild.  They&#39;re  <br/>
practice books for phonics lessons, very often.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are levels of comprehension.  I might read a Spanish passage  <br/>
and understand a few words and guess at some others and that would be  <br/>
some low level comprehension. I might read Hunchback of Notre Dame  <br/>
and follow the story but miss layers of meaning.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all internal. If someone isn&#39;t comprehending -- getting  <br/>
*something* -- from what they read, then they choose to not read. Not  <br/>
so in schools, though. Kids are made to &quot;read&quot;. Then they&#39;re tested  <br/>
to see if they &quot;comprehended&quot;. But the internal comprehension and  <br/>
external (tested) comprehension aren&#39;t the same creature.<br/>
<br/>
When a mom or teacher says a child isn&#39;t comprehending -- as was  <br/>
stated in the post -- how do they know? They judge by asking  <br/>
questions that draw on what someone &quot;should&quot; remember from the  <br/>
passage. What if, as the child dutifully sounded out words, she tuned  <br/>
in to the parts she liked and the questions weren&#39;t about that? If  <br/>
someone asked me to list the main characters of a book I just  <br/>
finished I&#39;d fail &quot;comprehension&quot; miserably ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Is &quot;lack of comprehension&quot; as schools assess it, really an indication  <br/>
of how well a child is able to tune out what doesn&#39;t interest her?  <br/>
How many unschooled kids never pick up a book to read for pleasure  <br/>
until they discover some author of adult books? If they&#39;d been asked  <br/>
to read passages about apples and wheelbarrows before that, would  <br/>
they have failed comprehension tests? Kat took the SAT last year and  <br/>
I went through some practice tests with her to give her some  <br/>
strategies and the hardest part was paying attention to some of the  <br/>
reading passages! ;-)  (Though, I will give the test makers credit in  <br/>
that some of them were interesting.)<br/>
<br/>
So, as you say, there is no reading without comprehension. And  <br/>
unschooled kids choose not to read when they aren&#39;t yet  <br/>
comprehending. If an unschooled child is sitting reading a book they  <br/>
*are* comprehending on some level, otherwise why would they waste  <br/>
their time? (Though not all &quot;not reading&quot; is &quot;not comprehending&quot;.  <br/>
Some kids have other things they&#39;d rather do with their time! ;-) But  <br/>
in school kids can&#39;t choose to not read. They can&#39;t choose what they  <br/>
read. They&#39;re being made to read before they&#39;re ready to or want to  <br/>
comprehend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082389738">Down below is something from the University of Rhode Island about  <br/>
Reading Comprehension.<br/>
http://www.ed.uri.edu/tic2002/readlit2/comprehension/Definition%20and% <br/>
20Indicators.htm<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s all stuff we naturally do while reading for personally  <br/>
meaningful reasons, imagine being tested on it when made to read  <br/>
something you have no interest in.<br/>
<br/>
Some might argue that we&#39;ll eventually have to read things not for  <br/>
pleasure, like reports for a job. But even if we might not pick  <br/>
something up for pleasure, even if we&#39;d rather drive nails through  <br/>
our tongues than read Johnson&#39;s sleep inducing text ;-) we are  <br/>
reading -- and comprehending -- for a purpose. We&#39;ve chosen the job  <br/>
and chosen the level of competence we want to perform it at. And we  <br/>
*can* choose not to read Johnson&#39;s report! We can skim. We can hire  <br/>
someone to write a summary. We can call up Johnson and ask him to  <br/>
summarize it in one sentence ;-) It&#39;s only in reading class when  <br/>
we&#39;re required to comprehend random text just for the sake of proving  <br/>
to someone else we can comprehend.<br/>

<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
Text Comprehension:  The ability to understand or get meaning from  <br/>
text ( any type of written material). It is the reason for reading  <br/>
and a critical component of all content learning.<br/>
<br/>
*       It is the thinking done before, during, and after reading.  <br/>
(Fountas p.323) Comprehension is not something that happens after  <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
*       It is the interaction between the text being read and the  <br/>
reader&#39;s existing prior knowledge and expectations will generate  <br/>
meaning and comprehension (Leu and Kinzer, 1995).<br/>
<br/>
If readers can read the words but do not understand what they are  <br/>
reading, they are not really reading.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Indicators of Reading Comprehension<br/>
<br/>
Students are able to construct meaning from text.<br/>
<br/>
¨     Students are able to activate background knowledge before,  <br/>
during and after<br/>
reading text.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students are able to monitor their own understanding of text,  <br/>
identify what they do<br/>
not understand and are able to use appropriate (fix-up) strategies to  <br/>
synthesize<br/>
what they read.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students are able to create visual and other sensory imagery  <br/>
from text during and after<br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students identify and interpret vocabulary critical to the  <br/>
meaning of the text.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students are able to generate questions to integrate  <br/>
information from text.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students retell text orally and/or in written form.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students summarize text orally and/or in written form<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students use graphic aids and illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Students are able to examine and extend the meaning of the text.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students respond to text in oral discussion and written form.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students make inferences from text.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students are able to compare complex concepts of text.<br/>
<br/>
¨      Students can analyze the text structure and story elements.</div>

<br/>
Continue to do similar things, but in a child chosen way. Instead of  <br/>
reading for comprehension, or reading for any other purpose, read for  <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of following a science book from beginning to end, leaf  <br/>
through and find the experiments that look like fun.<br/>
<br/>
Ease out of the idea that jumping through hoops will result in  <br/>
learning and move towards the idea that interest is the key to learning.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Three of the girls are still engaged in finishing their Saxon math  <br/>
&gt; books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depending on their personalities, I&#39;d give them the choice on whether  <br/>
to continue each day or not. But I&#39;d also have better options  <br/>
available. Some kids can absorb the idea as well as parents that they  <br/>
can&#39;t learn unless they use a textbook. Taking away the textbook  <br/>
might feel like &quot;I don&#39;t care if you learn math or not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Zoombinis is a great math game. Cooking. Video games. Puzzles. Board  <br/>
games.<br/>
&gt; I am reading history non-fiction several days a week, as well as an  <br/>
&gt; evening read aloud of novels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let them choose what they want to hear. But treat it as a family  <br/>
together time rather than a necessity in their learning. If they want  <br/>
to hear Stephen King&#39;s &quot;The Shining&quot; then that&#39;s what it should be :-)<br/>
<br/>
You might reassure them that they can choose anything in the library.  <br/>
Some kids can pick up that it&#39;s like an unspoken test to see how well  <br/>
they&#39;ve absorbed what they &quot;should&quot; be reading.<br/>
&gt; The girls read several hours each day. They bike, play in the lake,  <br/>
&gt; play some computer games, and watch a very little bit of tv.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Self chosen to watch a little bit of TV?<br/>
<br/>
You might want to read:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a> and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a> (down the right hand side is a section  <br/>
on TV).<br/>
&gt; That has been that I read fiction for about an hour after breakfast,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How about discussing a day&#39;s schedule? And discuss it again later to  <br/>
see if it needs tweaked?<br/>
&gt; the girls do table work until lunch with my being available to help  <br/>
&gt; them with anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How about crafts at the table?<br/>
&gt; They use a textbook for math and a grammar text or workbook. They  <br/>
&gt; have history and science books (that I selected) to read individually.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How about puzzle books? Playing a game together?<br/>
&gt;  After lunch I typically read science and/or history, or we watch a  <br/>
&gt; video (again, my selection).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of great TV shows (especially on cable) that are science.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t *need* to do that, but it might be a way not to feel you&#39;re  <br/>
yanking the rug from beneath them. If a home goes from structure to  <br/>
&quot;Do anything you wish,&quot; it can end up being like a stampede.<br/>
<br/>
It depends on personalities, of course.<br/>
&gt; The girls take dance almost every day during the week. The ballet  <br/>
&gt; studio is BIG in their lives. We also all take knitting classes  <br/>
&gt; once a week which have now become more of help for their projects  <br/>
&gt; with two ladies in a lovely knitting shop. We go to the library  <br/>
&gt; once a week, and three of the girls carry out a stack of fiction.  <br/>
&gt; The other girl says she never finds anything she likes, although  <br/>
&gt; she reads heavily from our home library.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that if I didn&#39;t schedule anything, life would seem much  <br/>
&gt; like it is this summer, which the girls all describe as &quot;vacation.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would feel like vacation to who? To you? To the girls? Would  <br/>
permanent vacation be a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
Our Puritan roots says so! But if you look at the lives of long time  <br/>
unschoolers, what people imagine will happen with permanent vacation  <br/>
doesn&#39;t. Kids aren&#39;t vegging in front of the TV. We are natural  <br/>
learning machines. We&#39;re naturally curious about life. What  <br/>
interferes with that is school and being made to learn before we&#39;re  <br/>
curious about something.<br/>
&gt; They would still read lots, although I&#39;m not sure if they would  <br/>
&gt; willingly make a switch to reading non-fiction because they&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; relied on me for that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t really know.<br/>
<br/>
And would it be a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
Conventional wisdom says yes. But is someone who is made to be well  <br/>
rounded a better person than someone who has the freedom to explore  <br/>
what interests them?<br/>
<br/>
If we project the &quot;freedom to explore&quot; onto schooled children,  <br/>
parents know they&#39;d never voluntarily do math or science or  <br/>
literature or whatever the child hates. And they&#39;d be right because  <br/>
those subjects have been made cringeworthy by *school* forcing it on  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
But in real life, there are parts of everything that will interest a  <br/>
child. While my daughter isn&#39;t a science nut, she does enjoy sciencey  <br/>
tv programs and science experiments. On her own she does a lot of  <br/>
drawing and playing guitar and talking to friends, but because  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t make her learn science and I find something interesting, she&#39;s  <br/>
happy to watch it with me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if I should make some kind of announcement, along the  <br/>
&gt; lines of &quot;Let&#39;s just keep doing what we&#39;re doing this summer,&quot; or  <br/>
&gt; whether I should just not say anything and simply not schedule  <br/>
&gt; things as I have been doing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends on their personalities.<br/>
<br/>
If they had a choice, would they choose vacation or going back to a  <br/>
schedule? Whatever, do that, and ease towards greater freedom to  <br/>
explore.<br/>
&gt; When I&#39;ve t;ried to wean myself away from the schedule before, the  <br/>
&gt; girls have told me they prefer having a weekly list of things to  <br/>
&gt; accomplish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean no schedule. Schedules help us accomplish  <br/>
what we plan to do! :-)<br/>
<br/>
What isn&#39;t conducive to unschooling is imposing a learning schedule  <br/>
on kids.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s obvious to me that they are relying on me for structure, that  <br/>
&gt; they are relying on me to provide too much in the form of assigned  <br/>
&gt; reading and read aloud selections.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Start asking more. It&#39;s okay if they don&#39;t know at the beginning.  <br/>
They&#39;ve absorbed that there&#39;s a right way to learn and you asking  <br/>
might feel like putting the burden of doing it right onto them.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe some are more bold and will be happy to take up the freedom  <br/>
to choose and can help ease the rest.<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t expect them to structure their days. Limitations can  <br/>
sometimes be freeing. When you can do anything you want anytime you  <br/>
want, some people freeze up and don&#39;t know how to choose! Maybe help  <br/>
them make lists of *fun* things they&#39;d like to do and help them make  <br/>
their own schedule to accomplish them.<br/>
&gt; I have no problem with the read aloud. To me, it&#39;s been great and I  <br/>
&gt; absolutely love that time of our day. But I am bugged that they  <br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t finding their own interests, and yet I recognize that I  <br/>
&gt; created this by the schedule I have imposed. They all have come to  <br/>
&gt; depend on that schedule too much. I would love it if our lives  <br/>
&gt; could continue as they have during the summer, with some  <br/>
&gt; artificially imposed structure (dance times, knitting classes,  <br/>
&gt; library trips), but I would love it if the girls would find their  <br/>
&gt; own interests to pursue, other than reading fiction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Expectations can be happiness killers. If they can&#39;t do it, they  <br/>
can&#39;t. But be there to help them. Be their support. Help them start  <br/>
lists of what they&#39;d like to do and like to explore. And it&#39;s okay if  <br/>
they drop them. They *should* be dabbling right now.<br/>
&gt; So, what&#39;s the recommendation for how a long-time homeschooling  <br/>
&gt; family can make the shift to becoming unschoolers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rule of thumb is deschooling takes 1 month for each year of  <br/>
schooling. Getting unschooling can happen easily or take longer.<br/>
&gt; Do I talk to the kids about what I am thinking? Do I move back to  <br/>
&gt; our house in September and just not schedule table time and plan a  <br/>
&gt; structured program of books for the girls to read on various non- <br/>
&gt; fiction topics?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t announce anything but you could start talking about  <br/>
unschooling as you would to a friend. And I think the less control  <br/>
you have over what they do the better. I wouldn&#39;t require them to  <br/>
read non-fiction at a particular time, but doing a science experiment  <br/>
or cooking project or something after lunch (or whatever) might help   <br/>
you maintain a variety of flow through their lives. If you see the  <br/>
difference. You don&#39;t need to do science experiments, but if you have  <br/>
a hard time not falling into a rut, being mindful of the variety of  <br/>
things you can do, can help.<br/>
<br/>
Ask for their input.<br/>
&gt; The recommendation we&#39;ve received has been to review, review,  <br/>
&gt; review. She can&#39;t handle money or tell time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Apparently the review isn&#39;t working ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s often a recommendation, but most therapists are trying to get  <br/>
kids onto a school schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of delays, learning can&#39;t happen without interest. The  <br/>
more variety of things she enjoys in life, the more likely she&#39;ll  <br/>
come across something that will make time or money meaningful. So far  <br/>
she hasn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; She can&#39;t retell a story to save her life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people can&#39;t! It could be that even if she didn&#39;t have  <br/>
issues, she might not be able to tell a story.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the unfortunate things about labels is that everything  <br/>
gets filtered through that label. A friend of mine listed off a  <br/>
number of things that her Asperger&#39;s child couldn&#39;t do. (She was,  <br/>
perhaps unconsciously, using her younger daughter as a yard stick for  <br/>
him.) But several of them were things my daughter couldn&#39;t do either  <br/>
and she&#39;s perfectly &quot;typical&quot;, things like being sent off to get  <br/>
dressed on her own without getting distracted ;-)<br/>
