<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463026243">Keith and I just got back, 7:15ish, from having been at Holly&#39;s birthday show since we started setting up punch and snacks at 2:15.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith did pizza runs.  I kept glasses of punch filled.   <br/>
<br/>
The first three hours were her party.  Invited guests only, and there were bands, at a performance center in downtown Albuquerque called Amped.  Amped does all-ages shows.   Most of the regulars are over 21, but they spend their time there, not out drinking.<br/>
<br/>
Holly turns 21 next week.  Instead of wanting a party with alcohol, this is what she asked for--for us to help her organize this, and to provide pizza and snacks, and we gave the venue $150.  They like Holly very much, because she&#39;s a regular there (&quot;Part of the family,&quot; the owners told us) and her boyfriend&#39;s band performs frequentlyâ€”they offered to do it free, but Holly wanted to pay for the space.  <br/>
<br/>
After 6:00, they were charging $5 at the door as they regularly do, and we took the food away (legalities).  <br/>
<br/>
Holly had advertised both parts separately, on facebook and with paper flyers she&#39;s been distributing for three weeks.   She&#39;ll be there until 10:30 or after they clean up.  She often helps clean up.<br/>
<br/>
There were probably 50 people there, maybe not all at once, and there will be more later.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly didn&#39;t ask her boyfriend&#39;s band to play.  He helped host.  The drummer (his best friend and roommate) was there; the other band member had another gig--he does other musical things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling that because my whole life I&#39;ve seen people older, my age, younger, kids my kids&#39; ages, turn 21.  What Holly asked for, and her wanting us there, was not average.  We would have bought her liquor and hosted a party here.  We did for Kirby when he turned 21.   Marty went to Las Vegas with his girlfriend, partly a gift from her and partly with birthday money we gave him.  (From Albuquerque, Las Vegas is about an eight-hour drive.)<br/>
<br/>
So what Holly wanted wasn&#39;t even &quot;normal&quot; for our family.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Next Friday, her actual birthday, she&#39;s planning to go out for sushi and sake with her boyfriend, her brother Marty, and Marty&#39;s girlfriend Ashlee.  They will come back earlyish because she&#39;s in a women&#39;s choir and they have a lock-in (all-day intensive music practice) starting at 9:45 the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
I report this, for the record, as the candid behavior of our last-to-turn-21 unschooled child who has had and still has lots of choices and support from her family.   The &quot;normal&quot; behavior assumed of teens and young adults seems to be a reaction to limits, rules, school, shame, and pressure.  It&#39;s been a long, long time since I though of it as normal.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another thing, though, worth noting:  Everyone who attended Holly&#39;s party, and everyone in every band that came to play seven or eight bands will have played before the event is over) is at an all-ages, alcohol-free venue, because they&#39;re there to play or to hear local music.  That&#39;s special, too. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something for further reading, if anyone&#39;s wondering about what&#39;s normal with teens.  <br/>
