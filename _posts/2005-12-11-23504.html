<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418418611">Hey thanks for trying to answer my not so direct question all the <br/>
answers really helped me think and I guess what sparked the question <br/>
in the first place were two different homeschooling families I know.<br/>
  Family number 1:  they have 10 kids and insist that they unschool <br/>
the kids. But I have never seen any kind of enrichment or anything I <br/>
would deem as learning going in their family and (not that a big <br/>
family can&#39;t unschool ) I consider the stuff that goes on there <br/>
abuse and neglect and was just kind of wondering if what I was <br/>
seeing could be, under someones broad discription, (someone other <br/>
than that mother&#39;s) of unschooling.  Truth be told they are radical <br/>
religious people and do try to control the kids life and thinking <br/>
but are to busy with other stuff to do anything but say &quot;No&quot; to them <br/>
and limit their interaction with just about anything.  <br/>
   And then their is family number2: Who&#39;s Mother always  asks me <br/>
about what kind of homeschooling I do with my kids and I am afraid <br/>
to talk about unschooling to her for fear that I know what a limited <br/>
life she lives and I think she might take the &quot;no school time and no <br/>
text book&quot; part and forget or gloss over the &quot;get out and experiance <br/>
life part&quot;.  She isn&#39;t a very well rounded person (in my opinion) <br/>
and belives that a woman&#39;s place is in the house and so forth.   I <br/>
was posing that question as an &quot;Am I bad for not opening the <br/>
unschooling door for them&quot; question and an &quot;Am I thinking I am <br/>
better than her and so I am qualified to unschool and she is not?&quot;  <br/>
snobish kind of thinking and just wanted or rather was hoping for <br/>
someone to make me feel better in the feelings I posses with these <br/>
families<br/>
<br/>
sorry again for the long rambaling on but some soul searching on my <br/>
part is good<br/>

Jean, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to preface my remarks with the caveat that I am speaking outside<br/>
of situations of legally defined abuse and neglect, or situations where a<br/>
mother is actively hurting her child in your presence. <br/>
<br/>
I think you might be better off letting go of your fears about these other<br/>
families and your judgments about these other mothers. My experience in<br/>
myself of having these kinds of thoughts is that it ends up causing *me* a<br/>
lot of emotional anguish, distracts me from Jayn and my own family, and<br/>
affects the other families not at all.<br/>
<br/>
You just can&#39;t take responsibility for other people&#39;s children or control<br/>
how other people are going to take any information they receive. Even the<br/>
&quot;no textbooks&quot; portion is a positive step, rather than something to be<br/>
feared.<br/>
<br/>
This is partly why I don&#39;t do school conversations. Self protection.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect, and I could be wrong, but still, I suspect that your best path is<br/>
to stop focusing at all, in any way, on what these other families are doing,<br/>
and what they are labeling their home schooling, and turn all of your<br/>
attention to enriching your own children&#39;s lives - without making<br/>
comparisons.<br/>
<br/>
If you can be a shining light of contentment and joy and relaxed engagement<br/>
with your children, you will likely then attract the interest of other<br/>
mothers who genuinely want to receive the information about Unschooling<br/>
without becoming hostile. They start to want what you have and ask you how<br/>
you got there.<br/>
<br/>
I know that it is hard not to be evangelical about Unschooling - but no<br/>
message, regardless of how compelling and simple and joyful it is, will be<br/>
heard by those with closed ears. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Depends, I think.  A family with 10 kids is going to have to say &quot;no&quot; about 10 times more than a family with 1 kid, just based on the number.  Then having 10 kids means dealing with 10 schedules, likes and dislikes rather than 1.  I would think you are going to hear &quot;no&quot; or at least, &quot;I don&#39;t see how&quot; a lot, lot more than in your average size family.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>==============================<br/>
<br/>
Depends on what they&#39;re saying no about and how, and why.<br/>
<br/>
I talked Marty into a no the other night.  He wanted to go out and  <br/>
look at Christmas lights.  He was restless and just wanted to drive.<br/>
<br/>
The car he usually drives is in the shop.  He was in an accident; it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t his fault; the other driver (drunk and uninsured) left; Marty  <br/>
came home.  Had Marty stayed and called the police, our insurance  <br/>
would&#39;ve covered the repair.  He didn&#39;t know that and the damage  <br/>
seemed slight.  Wasn&#39;t so slight.<br/>
<br/>
So I told Marty I didn&#39;t think it was worth the risk considering lots  <br/>
of decorations weren&#39;t even out yet, Kirby would be away all weekend  <br/>
in one vehicle, and if another got damaged Keith would be way more  <br/>
upset than Christmas lights were worth, and that he should wait until  <br/>
we had more cars and there were more lights.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;say no.&quot;  He could&#39;ve made a counter argument.  I asked if  <br/>
he wanted to take Holly to help him drive carefully.  He really  <br/>
wanted to go alone.  He thought about it and said my arguments made  <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
i COULD have just said no, but this was more valuable, made me feel  <br/>
less guilty, made him a part of the decision, and though it took  <br/>
longer and was a negative response, it wasn&#39;t &quot;NO, you can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I talked Marty into a no the other night.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I have an only, so I can only imagine what it would be like to have<br/>
more kids.  But I also know that there are lots of different ways to say<br/>
no.  There is the outright &#39;no&#39;, which ends all conversations and creates<br/>
the power dynamic which I see in most families (parent is in charge, child<br/>
must obey).  This is the &#39;no&#39; I was referring to and the one that I see<br/>
used most often.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the conversation that might talk the child into a no, like<br/>
the example Sandra posted, but that supports the relationship between the<br/>
parent and the child and respects the child.  I know that Sandra creates a<br/>
positive relationship with her 3 kids, and I would guess that she probably<br/>
uses no even less than I do (I&#39;m still catching myself!)  So I&#39;m not so<br/>
sure that we can make a logical conclusion that if there are more kids<br/>
there will be more nos.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I will agree to add to my statement that they &quot;probably&quot; aren&#39;t<br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-71274989">Robyn, I just want to thank you for your post. I agree totally. I would also like to add that usually we don&#39;t really know what is going on in other families. We don&#39;t know what conversations they are having or what books, movies, or other experiences they may be enjoying. We also don&#39;t know what the learning styles of these children might be. One of the best things about homeschooling in general and unschooling specifically is that no one knows or loves a child as well as his or her parents and other family members.<br/>
  I have no doubt that to the outside observer my family looks kooky or lazy or maybe even abusive. I hope we look like a good example of a loving and thriving family... but you might have to come and live here a while to see that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Learning styles&quot; was a really exciting thing for teachers to think  <br/>
about 20 years ago.  Lots of educators earned their PhDs off that  <br/>
concept.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately it was misused and misunderstood by people trying to  <br/>
pinpoint a person&#39;s one singular learning style and that&#39;s no good.   <br/>
In trying to encourage schools to employ all KINDS of sensory input  <br/>

Even with a single child, I think learning should involve as many  <br/>
different kinds of input as possible.  What I&#39;ve felt AND heard AND  <br/>
seen AND smelled or tasted (if applicable &lt;g&gt;) will exist more wholly  <br/>
in my memory than something I&#39;ve only read about or imagined.  But  <br/>
one of those is better than none, and two or three are better than one.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent decides her child learns best by reading and provides  <br/>
lots of books but no physical stuff or movies or music, that&#39;s not  <br/>
very good in my opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782858817">Hi Sandra, I agree with you, I didn&#39;t mean learning styles in that way. I should have been more clear. Many years ago I went to a workshop for homeschoolers on learning styles and I didn&#39;t think much of it. I read the discriptions of the styles and couldn&#39;t really find myself or my children at all. However I do think that each person learns more easily in some ways rather than others.  <br/>
  My first kid learns very easily, she pretty much grasps whatever she is exposed to the first time it comes by. It can be something she reads about, hears, experiences physically or whatever, she remembers and understand it. This seems to be the case even if she isn&#39;t very interested in the material. My second girl is similar, but if she isn&#39;t interested, forget it. Unless she reads it, if she reads something she remembers it.<br/>
  My youndest is visually impared and we have to get more creative in helping her satisfy her curiosity.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My point was just that each family and child have their own approach(es) to family life and learning. <br/>
