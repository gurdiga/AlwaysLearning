<div id="ygrps-yiv-516211989">Half-price day at Savers, Holly wanted to go.<br/>
The parking lot was full.  We were in line to check out.  <br/>
<br/>
The mom in front of me said to one of her kids, &quot;Do you want a spanking?&quot;<br/>
I didn&#39;t look at the girl to see her response. I was looking at what I was <br/>
looking at, and I would have had to turn 90 degrees.   I didn&#39;t hear a response, <br/>
but the mom said, &quot;Do you want me to spank you in public?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I looked and the girl she was speaking to was at least 13, maybe 14.<br/>
She has a younger sister with her and a third, younger yet (9?) came up later.<br/>
<br/>
The mom had been using a normal speaking voice, not mean, not loud, not <br/>
sneaky-quiet.   And I was standing closer to her than her girls were, even, and I <br/>
said in the same normal-conversation voice, clearly to her, though I hadn&#39;t <br/>
gotten her attention first: &quot;If a man threatened to hit his wife, people would <br/>
call the police.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It was loud ough for her daughters and for Holly to hear. Maybe for the <br/>
checker, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sh<br/>
Ze paused and turned toward me toward the  checker (not all the way around <br/>
toward the kids) and said, &quot;It&#39;s different with kids, I think.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;No it&#39;s not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Neither of us had been sharp or mean.  We could&#39;ve been talking about a scarf <br/>
or the weather.   She said, &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; but she didn&#39;t say it as loudly or <br/>
with conviction.  <br/>
<br/>
Then her youngest daughter came up and said, &quot;I don&#39;t want one of those!&quot;  <br/>
(She was buying six plastic skeleton goblets, and the middle girl had seemed <br/>
really happy about it earlier.)  The mom said &quot;Tough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think Holly was more offended by that than the spanking threat.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a mother spanking a teenaged girl in a thrift store.   <br/>
<br/>
And just for the record, they were anglo, no southern accent, and the mom <br/>
seemed educated/intelligent.<br/>
<br/>
I was glad I said something.  If it doesn&#39;t make any difference now, it might <br/>
with the girls&#39; children later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453860899">I think it could also make a difference for the girls now, even if you <br/>
didn&#39;t convince the mom (although you planted a seed anyway).  Now the <br/>
girls know (if they didn&#39;t already) that there are other ways to be <br/>
treated.  And the mother knows that they know.  I admire your doing <br/>
that.  I don&#39;t know if I would have been brave enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856202512">This brought up an experience I had the other day at the store, that still is in my heart...probably because I didn&#39;t do anything.  Didn&#39;t know what to do.  I was standing outside the bathroom door waiting for  2 of my kids to come out.  I was next to the water fountain.  This mother (I gathered) came up with her cart with her 2 (or so) year old in it with 3 other 7-11 year olds.  She turned to them on her way into the bathroom, and said very harshly &quot;stay there...don&#39;t move...don&#39;t leave the baby&quot;.  The 8ish year old comes away to the water fountain (about 4 feet from the cart) to get a drink (just came into the store...hot summer here) and the mother stoped and very harshly said &quot;get back to the cart!&quot;  The child said, &quot;but I&#39;m thirsty!&quot;  Mother said &quot;get back to the cart&quot; (much more harsh).  The child said, &quot;but I&#39;m thirsty!&quot;  Mother said&quot; get back now...1...2(now she&#39;s making her way over to the girl, angrily)...3(while wacking her on the lower back...missed the butt in her<br/>
 anger).  The girl then went over to the cart, rubbing and looking at her back, while the mother went into the bathroom.    I think my mouth was open when the scene ended.   And, also for the record...anglo, no accent...educated, well that depends on in who&#39;s opinion...<br/>
