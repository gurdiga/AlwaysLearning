&gt; right out and buy that unit study.  They let their kid play all day<br/>
&gt; except for those two hours he has to sit down with the math text book. <br/>
&gt; That is not unschooling, and if a person wants to understand I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think it&#39;s helpful to let them go on thinking it is.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Noticing and allowing a kid&#39;s interest in insects seems kinder than saying, <br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t get to study insects this year, that&#39;s not until 3rd grade.&quot; Major <br/>
improvement.<br/>
<br/>
But, on the other hand, noticing that a kid is interested in insects and then <br/>
being so kind as to make their spelling words for that week be insect related <br/>
and letting them write their weekly essay on insects -- it just still doesn&#39;t <br/>
have that spark of unschooling in it and for our purposes, here on THIS list, <br/>
that needs to be said.<br/>
<br/>
And, now I&#39;m going to even contradict my first statement, above. If parents <br/>
are going to turn a kid&#39;s interests into &quot;dreaded school work,&quot; it might be <br/>
better if the parents did NOT notice the kid&#39;s interests. <br/>
