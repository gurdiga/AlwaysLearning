Cows shit HUGE big splats, you know.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday I made a cow pie joke, and Kirby and Holly, who were born in <br/>
and have never left New Mexico, looked at me blankly.  I explained.  &quot;OH!&quot; <br/>
they said, politely.  They didn&#39;t know the term.  They knew the object, and <br/>
dry ones are called &quot;cow chips&quot; (they&#39;re like frisbees, since things <br/>
dehydrate so well here.  They&#39;re frisbees you don&#39;t want to catch).<br/>
<br/>
Cows have a habit of eating gardens.  Probably you know all this.<br/>
<br/>
Well good luck with the cow thang.<br/>

Sandra, cow-free</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358892702">Cows also don&#39;t care if they step on you. A horse (well, any relatively nice<br/>
horse) cares. A cow just walks on you.<br/>
<br/>
Spend a lot of time with a real cow before you get one, if you haven&#39;t. They<br/>
look poetic in fields, but I wouldn&#39;t want to be on stage with one.<br/>

That&#39;s why the cow is a couple years down the road. I figure I&#39;ll start with<br/>
Chickens.<br/>
