<div id="ygrps-yiv-829667801">For years after I quit teaching (it tapered off--worst the first few years <br/>
after I quit)<br/>
I could not watch a news item about the state of the schools, or an <br/>
investigative report on ANYTHING school-related, or read an article in a <br/>
magazine about what would make the schools better.  Had to TURN IT OFF and <br/>
breathe through the irritation.<br/>
<br/>
So years passed and I was neutral.<br/>
<br/>
And last night I accidently saw enough of Boston Public (Marty was watching <br/>
it, and I came to spray carpet cleaner on some spots in that room) that I sat <br/>
and watched the whole thing with him.  <br/>
<br/>
And I was thinking, &quot;I could *so* do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And now that I&#39;ve slept and it&#39;s morning I remind myself that the last time <br/>
there was a spate of TV shows about school was during a teacher shortage.  <br/>
And maybe that&#39;s happening again.  So it&#39;s propaganda to make people want to <br/>
teach, and to make taxpayers want to pay  more.  (Maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
And then I remind myself that on TV shows the principal has a good script <br/>
writer.  And classes have sixteen to twenty students, not 30 to 40.  And it <br/>
only lasts an hour.  And you can change the channel!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m better now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And last night I accidently saw enough of Boston Public...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have seen only snippets of that program and I thought it was preachy.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the anti school me, but the few minutes I&#39;ve watched were<br/>
irritating.<br/>
<br/>
I had never thought about what it would be like for a teacher watching.  <br/>
That you&#39;ve completely stepped away from a chosen field is fascinating to<br/>
me.   The reason you chose it in the first place, the reason you left and<br/>
all the social and political stuff in between must always be with you.   <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate what you&#39;ve given all of us since you left all of that.<br/>

I&#39;ve stepped off the getting paid and earning seniority path, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t step away from fascination with learning and information, with <br/>
helping kids come from bad situations into better ones, or with helping <br/>
people learn who want to learn.  It&#39;s fascinating to me too, that I could <br/>
move so quickly toward what I thought was my goal, and so fairly-soon away, <br/>
but not so far away after all.<br/>
