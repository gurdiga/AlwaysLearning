<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036088194">When she blocks these folks is it that she doesn&#39;t look at them and<br/>
pretends not to hear them?  <br/>
Have you paid attention to what the people she&#39;s blocking out are saying<br/>
to her?<br/>
Are they quizzing her, I wonder?  So many people do this to homeschooled<br/>
kids, try  to get them to say what they&#39;ve learned.    Are they bossing<br/>
her?   Maybe she thinks it would be rude to say,  &quot; Grandma, please don&#39;t<br/>
test me.&quot;  or &quot;Please don&#39;t tell me what to do.&quot;  So she just pretends<br/>
she can&#39;t hear it.  We spend a lot of time encouraging kids to be<br/>
considerate of other people, maybe she doesn&#39;t know she has a right to<br/>
politely ask them not to do that thing that&#39;s bothering her.<br/>
Blanking might be the Tamzin version of &quot;would you look at the time, I<br/>
have to run!&quot;<br/>
I do it all the time!  To my mom, too!  It&#39;s a very useful tool.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are they people who arrive, maybe, when she had something else planned<br/>
that they are now interrupting?  Maybe she thinks THEY are being rude.<br/>
<br/>
Is she afraid if she shows interest and love for them she&#39;s being<br/>
disloyal to you?  <br/>
Some kids don&#39;t figure out right away that letting another person close<br/>
doesn&#39;t squeeze everybody else out.  <br/>
<br/>
Some kids are very good at reading body language and other cues, maybe<br/>
she feels they&#39;re not all that friendly and so is protecting herself. <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s basically a lot a rambling from a person who has no real<br/>

<br/>
No, they&#39;re definitely not quizzing her. *I&#39;d* blank<br/>
people too if they were quizzing her! But this can<br/>
happen even with other home/unschooling parents. My<br/>
mom almost never tells her what to do. She may suggest<br/>
something, but she never forces it. She&#39;s actually<br/>
very relaxed and hands off (maybe she&#39;s too hands off<br/>
with her?)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We spend a lot of time encouraging kids to be<br/>
considerate of other people, maybe she doesn&#39;t know<br/>

I do it all the time!  To my mom, too!  It&#39;s a very<br/>
useful tool.&lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always given her &#39;words&#39; to use to explain to<br/>
people if something is bothering her, but she doesn&#39;t<br/>
usually feel comfortable enough to use them. That&#39;s<br/>
where I usually come in, to translate. That&#39;s also why<br/>
I used to attribute this behaviour to shyness. I&#39;ve<br/>
been working with her for a long time now to be able<br/>
to communicate to people without my intervention.<br/>
Sometimes she communicates great and sometimes it just<br/>
seems too difficult for her. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Are they people who arrive, maybe, when she had<br/>
something else planned<br/>
that they are now interrupting?  Maybe she thinks THEY<br/>
are being rude.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, it can happen anywhere or even if we are the ones<br/>
coming into the situation. The park, shops, etc. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is she afraid if she shows interest and love for<br/>
them she&#39;s being<br/>
disloyal to you?  <br/>
Some kids don&#39;t figure out right away that letting<br/>
another person close<br/>
doesn&#39;t squeeze everybody else out.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is it. For example, she has a great<br/>
relationship with her stepmum and talks to me freely<br/>
about her affection for her. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Some kids are very good at reading body language<br/>
and other cues, maybe she feels they&#39;re not all that<br/>
friendly and so is protecting herself. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought this might be the case at first, but<br/>
sometimes she does it to a person and the next time we<br/>
see them (or even in the same day) she&#39;s all friendly<br/>
to them. Besides, my mom is hardly a threatening or<br/>
dangerous character &lt;g&gt;. In fact she&#39;s a real<br/>
kindhearted lady and is very loving. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Well, that&#39;s basically a lot a rambling from a<br/>
person who has no real idea.<br/>
Sorry Meghan,<br/>
Deb L&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, really, thank you Deb. This is just the sort of<br/>
thing that can maybe help me to stumble across a new<br/>
idea that I haven&#39;t thought of or tried. All feedback<br/>
is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Meghan :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038961182">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Some type of seizures? My niece did something like<br/>
this - she would <br/>
just seem <br/>
to zone out, usually just for a few seconds. Turned<br/>
out she was having <br/>
as <br/>
many as 80 little teensy seizures a day. <br/>
<br/>
--pam&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, she&#39;s definitely fully present. It&#39;s more like a<br/>
&#39;coldness&#39; to people rather than &#39;blanking out&#39;. I<br/>
suppose I didn&#39;t describe it very well.<br/>

just be supportive, <br/>
understanding and wait for it to pass.<br/>
Any ideas would be great though!!<br/>
Tamzin isn&#39;t the only one.<br/>
But Sierra is four, I really hope she outgrows this by<br/>
seven!!! oh <br/>
well.<br/>
Ren&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about sending that first one! Pressed return by<br/>
mistake before I&#39;d actually typed anything, whoops!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much Ren! That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m talking<br/>
about! My friend described it well when she said<br/>
Tamzin gives people the &#39;cold shoulder&#39;. I too thought<br/>
(and hoped) Tamzin would outgrow this behaviour. I<br/>
think it is getting more noticable (and socially<br/>
unacceptable) as she gets older. I just keep trying to<br/>
remind her how it would feel if she were on the<br/>
receiving end of the &#39;cold shoulder&#39;. The problem is,<br/>
I don&#39;t think she&#39;s ever been given the cold shoulder,<br/>
so she doesn&#39;t know what it feels like. Maybe I can<br/>
get someone to do it to her &lt;very sarcastic grin&gt;.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The problem is,<br/>

so she doesn&#39;t know what it feels like. Maybe I can<br/>
get someone to do it to her &lt;very sarcastic grin&gt;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if part of the problem is a lack of awareness of subtlety, she might not <br/>
recognize the cold shoulder, or it might not offend her one bit.   <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend now in her late 30&#39;s moved away, married to a guy with a cool <br/>
job and a PhD.  We NEVER would have guessed any of those things could have <br/>
come about twenty years ago.   But in times past when we did need to ask her <br/>
things like &quot;Please don&#39;t interrupt the main speaker&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t close your <br/>
eyes when you&#39;re talking, because it makes it impossible for us to signal you <br/>
to wait or stop,&quot;  she was never offended at all.  What would have been a <br/>
social 2x4 to some people was to her just communication.  And what was just <br/>
communication to most people was NOT communication to her.<br/>
<br/>
This might not apply one bit to Tamzin and if so that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
I was several times the one chosen to &quot;talk to Snail&quot; (her own self-chosen <br/>
nickname, and sadly fitting), and I would get my courage up, go WAY past the <br/>
point I was usually comfortable going, and she would look at me sweetly and <br/>
say &quot;Oh.  Okay.  I didn&#39;t realize that.&quot;   And I&#39;d need two days to recover <br/>
from having been so harsh with someone.<br/>
<br/>
But because she had her eyes closed and such like, normal everyday signals <br/>
didn&#39;t take.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786043919">My son seems to be doing this also but really he&#39;s not. You can see that he wants to answer, respond or acknowledge the other person and just can&#39;t. Over the years he has gotten better. It took a lot of prompting. Many times reminding him that &quot;um&quot; is not the answer I was looking for. Or even just looking straight at me and then walking away without answering. Argghh! I can only imagine how the people at work see him.<br/>

I thought that was it at first, but there seems to be<br/>
no pattern to it. Like I said, I didn&#39;t describe it<br/>
very clearly at the start. It&#39;s not like she blanks<br/>
out in a daydreamy, spacey way. She gives people the<br/>
cold shoulder. I still believe it&#39;s a shyness thing. I<br/>
just wish she would outgrow it, but I know there&#39;s no<br/>
rushing these things and if I don&#39;t pressure or push<br/>
her (just gentle reminders of how to treat others)<br/>
then I guess eventually she&#39;ll grow out of it.<br/>

<br/>
This is not the case though. Sometimes she&#39;ll be<br/>
friendly to people and then the next time she sees<br/>
them, gives them the cold shoulder. Also, it&#39;s not<br/>
only with other adults (mostly, but certainly not<br/>
always). When we walk into a situation and someone<br/>
says hello, I don&#39;t (and she doesn&#39;t, we&#39;ve talked<br/>
about it) feel that they&#39;re intruding on her mental<br/>
space. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s acceptable for her<br/>
to give someone the cold shoulder when they say hello<br/>
when we walk up to them (whether we know them or not).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean her introversion (I call it a sort of<br/>
shyness for lack of a better descriptive word. I find<br/>
that most people accept shy behaviour as pretty<br/>
natural) as something to be outgrown. What I meant,<br/>
was I hope she outgrows this cold shoulder behaviour<br/>
thing. <br/>
