 </span></blockquote>Temperament matters.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re ALWAYS going to feel like other people don&#39;t understand what you are <br/>
going through - because you have very explosive, dramatic, intense, <br/>
passionate children. Some people have easygoing, mild-tempered, and even <br/>
compliant children &lt;G&gt;. They think that because their son has a little <br/>
meltdown once in a while, when he&#39;s tired or hungry, that that is all that you<br/>
&#39;re dealing with.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people will always be judgmental about how you&#39;ve parented your kids - <br/>
because the kids will probably always be temperamentally like this and some <br/>
people are really uncomfortable around super strong emotions and they&#39;ll <br/>
blame YOU for not having &quot;tamed&quot; your kids. <br/>
<br/>
So - that&#39;s my first advice -- don&#39;t compare your kids to others and don&#39;t <br/>
think you&#39;re screwing up just because the kids are like this. You&#39;ll have <br/>
calmer times, times of more equilibrium, and rougher wilder times, but really <br/>
I think it is a good idea to assume you&#39;re never going to turn your kids into <br/>
calm and easy-going mellow people.<br/>
<br/>
 And there is nothing WRONG with perfectionist tendencies -- it just means <br/>
wanting to do things right. Do you want a doctor who is satisfied with <br/>
mediocre, so-so, muddling through? There is a place in the world for <br/>
perfectionists. So VALUE that in your children. <br/>
<br/>
That said -- you obviously want to help them be more happy - and pitching a <br/>
fit because they might get glue on their fingers isn&#39;t happy. This little guy <br/>
probably is going to need to learn that there are always going to be projects <br/>
that just aren&#39;t &quot;his thing&quot; -- so the best thing you can do is commisserate <br/>
while he&#39;s learning it - take him someplace else so he doesn&#39;t ruin the fun <br/>
for other kids -- and find him some stuff to do that he can enjoy. But once <br/>
you&#39;ve offered him something that he can enjoy, if he turns it down, let it <br/>
be. You also have to be sure you don&#39;t take on the burden of making him be <br/>
happy about it -- you do your part and then let him be happy or unhappy as he <br/>
wishes. <br/>
<br/>
That said, there probably is a lot you can probably do to reduce the amount <br/>
of fighting and melting down, etc. (Just don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to change <br/>
your kids&#39; natures.)  The book, The Explosive Child, is practical and useful.<br/>

A good way to avoid frustration with the crafts is to just have a LOT of cool <br/>
materials available to your kids that they can use when/how they choose.<br/>
Pens (thick and thin), crayons, tape, glue, string, pencils and REAMS of <br/>
paper are down in a set of rolling plasic drawers that my kids can access <br/>
easily at any time. Also paints and brushes are within easy reach, although I <br/>
have them let me assist in setting that up!<br/>
I also firmly believe in providing children with the level of art materials I <br/>
would use....well, ok, not quite as expensive in some cases (I won&#39;t hand my <br/>
four y.o. a $30 brush) but real items that work well. Nice pastels, quality <br/>
paints and good paper will inspire their creativity and besides, it feels <br/>
better.<br/>
We also have a bin of confetti, buttons, wire, beads etc... anything <br/>
interesting and possibly useful. They have access to wood, nails, a variety <br/>
of cloth and felt, nature items......<br/>
You get the idea.<br/>
Provide space, time and materials with no expectations and they will amaze <br/>
you.<br/>
We go to art galleries and demonstrations to get inspired.<br/>
They often come home with the desire to try a new material or process.<br/>
More freedom will probably equal less frustration for you.<br/>
There is no reason for a pre-destined outcome type craft with young children. <br/>
Only if they ask for one. <br/>
Keep a lot of artsy/craftsy books around and they&#39;ll let you know if <br/>
something looks appealing.<br/>
Other than that, turn them loose.<br/>

You made me laugh about the glue on the hand thingy.<br/>
We used to squirt glue on our desks in an oval shape, let it dry and then <br/>
attach to our fingernail as a fake nail. They were fairly convincing if you <br/>
got the shape just right! I was one of the impatient ones that couldn&#39;t wait <br/>
for it to dry. Did a whole set once though.....ah, the good parts of school.<br/>

<br/>
I agree that wanting to do things right should be valued <br/>
however &quot;perfectionism&quot; should not be.  Perfectionism, as defined in <br/>
the dictionary and the way I refer to it, means extreme or obsessive <br/>
striving for perfection.<br/>
<br/>
I know the difference between a perfectionist and a person that <br/>
strives to do a good job first hand.  I am a perfectionist.  My dh <br/>
strives to do a good job in whatever *he feels* is worth the effort.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of my perfectionism, I have achieved higher levels in certain <br/>
areas than dh has but he does not burn out and has fun doing what he <br/>
is doing.  For example, when I go on a bike ride it is to satisfy <br/>
some goal, it is hard for me to enjoy the moment.  When dh goes on a <br/>
bike ride, he can go and enjoy the scenery, the beauty of the day, <br/>
the smell of the air.   <br/>
<br/>
Being a perfectionist is not fun.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day I told my kids I was feeling a little worried about <br/>
whether I was up to the job of unschooling them.  They said &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
worry mom, you&#39;re good at everything&quot;.  I worry!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Uh oh.  Perfectionism is another one of those control<br/>
things.  Unschooling is not controlling....but you<br/>
still influence.  You are a perfectly good influence. <br/>
<br/>
All mothers worry. So worry already, don&#39;t obsess,<br/>
worry a little, it&#39;s OK to look out for the problems<br/>
and plan how to meet them. Being prepared  is OK.<br/>
Planning a little is OK.  And appreciating yourself is<br/>
OK, too.  <br/>
