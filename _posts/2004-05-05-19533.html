<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617012585">Hi Deanna,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to homeschooling.  My name is Ginnie and I have a 13 year old <br/>
son, too.  I also live in CT (Stratford).  If you are anywhere near <br/>
maybe you would like to bring your son here - I have a clay studio with <br/>
wheel and large kiln (I used to teach classes  to homeschoolers).  I&#39;d <br/>
be happy to show him the equipment.  I also have Ceramic Monthly <br/>
magazines and books with clay projects.  He could look through them and <br/>
we could make a copy of anything which was of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think,<br/>
<br/>
Ginnie</div>
