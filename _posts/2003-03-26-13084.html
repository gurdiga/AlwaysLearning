<div id="ygrps-yiv-510820657">I&#39;ve been wanting to tell this story for a week and a half.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday the 15th of March we had a cool learning experience.<br/>
<br/>
The boys were gone.  Kirby was at work, and Marty had gone to thrift stores <br/>
with friends (which turned into being gone for hours, which was okay).<br/>
<br/>
Keith came downstairs and said &quot;Holly&#39;s watching a movie in Spanish.&quot;  Keith <br/>
and I were watching some movie, I forget what, and eating in the den, and <br/>
just hanging out.<br/>
<br/>
Holly came down and said with some determination that she wanted me to find <br/>
out what movie she had just watched.  She said she had written part of the <br/>
name down but couldn&#39;t get it all, and would like for me to find it on video <br/>
and rent it.<br/>
<br/>
She had written down:  Cine de las...<br/>
<br/>
Ooops.  &quot;Holly, that&#39;s &#39;Movie of the...&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We laughed, but she was bummed.  <br/>
<br/>
We used to always get TV guide, but quit a few years ago.  So I got online to <br/>
see if I could find the schedule.  Couldn&#39;t.  Not for either Spanish-language <br/>
channel here.<br/>
<br/>
It was 9:00 Saturday night, and I figured we could go to the store and look <br/>
in the TV Guide.   Keith thought that was a weird thing to do, but he&#39;s used <br/>
to us.  I said I hoped we could find it on DVD with English subtitles, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 So we went to John Brooks, a little grocery just 1/4 mile away.  They were <br/>
all out of TV Guide. <br/>
<br/>
We went to Raley&#39;s, half a mile away.  They were almost out of TV Guide but <br/>
we found one.   <br/>
<br/>
These stations are both UHF, so you can&#39;t count on what channel they&#39;ll come <br/>
in on and what she was getting on her TV wasn&#39;t what was in the book.<br/>
<br/>
There were two movies in Spanish which had started at 7:00.   One was about <br/>
travellers to the Australian outback who meet a crazy dangerous guy in the <br/>
desert, as far as I could tell, reading what Spanish I could read.<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t it, she said.  <br/>
<br/>
The other was called &quot;Daniel el Travieso.&quot;  I had no idea about &quot;travieso,&quot; <br/>
but at least we had a likely movie.  &quot;Was his name Daniel?&quot; I asked, <br/>
pronouncing it in Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
YES!<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  I was reading through the TV-Guide blurb, and all I could tell was it <br/>
was a little kid who did blah blah, I didn&#39;t know what, to his neighbor Mr. <br/>
Wilson.   Played by Walter Matthau.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Holly! This is &#39;Dennis the Menace!&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s an American movie.  Used to be a comic in the newspaper.  Come on!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Between Raley&#39;s and our house was Hollywood Video.  Holly was pretty <br/>
skeptical about my whole theory, but I found the box, showed her the picture, <br/>
and she said yes, that was the one.<br/>
<br/>
Big Mystery solved, and I didn&#39;t even have to drive across town to find a <br/>
video store with a big section of Mexican cowboy movies and comedies to try <br/>
to look through in Spanish alphabetical order (though &quot;D&quot; for Daniel would <br/>
have been okay).<br/>
<br/>
Holly has been watching Back to the Future movies lots of late, and <br/>
Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson are both in Dennis the Menace and the <br/>
others as well.  <br/>
<br/>
For Holly, I paid attention to her and produced what she wanted within an <br/>
hour.  That can&#39;t always happen, so I&#39;m glad I did.  And I got to show her an <br/>
example of creative use of reference materials. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
