<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992370622">I FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  This isn&#39;t it.  This is another thing I <br/>
found while looking.<br/>
<br/>
It was in HEM in the May/June 1999 issue:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your House as a Museum&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once my kids were watching something or other on TV about woodcuts and block <br/>
printing, and somehow the subject turned to printed cloth.  I told them I had <br/>
some block-printed cloth and they got pretty excited about seeing it.  <br/>
<br/>
I found an Indian bedspread, printed in two passes, with blocks, and we <br/>
looked at where they had made some great matches, where they had missed, and <br/>
how it all might work (because I don&#39;t know what their work stations look <br/>
like, whether they do edges first, or what).  I found two scarves made of <br/>
fine cotton, block-printed each in one color only.  Then I found some <br/>
screen-printed silk handkerchiefs from China that a friend had given me after <br/>
his mother died.  Still in the packages, and some matching pairs, so we could <br/>
compare.  They might have been mass produced, but still...   Then I found a <br/>
piece of Hawaiian cloth.  I don&#39;t know the name of it, but my husband&#39;s mom <br/>
brought it from Hawaii.   I think it&#39;s a kind of Polynesian kilt <br/>
<br/>
 I also had a piece of woven paisley, a batik sari and a sari with gold woven <br/>
into it.  I didn&#39;t go into details about those except to point out that most <br/>
of those examples were made in India.  Someday I&#39;ll read them _The Road to <br/>
Agra_ which is a kids&#39; adventure novel and which deals in passing with the <br/>
child labor involved in weaving.<br/>
<br/>
With that my children decided that anything they might want to see, I would <br/>
have.  There have been many times that they were right!<br/>
<br/>
When they asked what pogs were supposed to be REALLY, I found an old <br/>
milk-bottle that had been stuck up in the top of a cabinet just in case a kid <br/>
might ever want to see it, next to the old molded Pepsi bottle, and the <br/>
not-so-old Coca Cola bottle.   I told them stories of picking up bottles to <br/>
turn in for the two-cent deposit.  It&#39;s the equivalent of picking up aluminum <br/>
cans now, but they&#39;re heavy and fragile.  The kids had never known about <br/>
bottle deposits like that, where the bottles were reused instead of melted <br/>
down.  I told them about people throwing bottles out of car windows on the <br/>
highways, and all the broken glass we walked on and around as kids, and that <br/>
people used to shoot at bottles for practice.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids nowadays take &quot;Keep American Beautiful&quot; for granted.  They can&#39;t believe <br/>
there used to be rusting bedsprings and old washing machines dumped all over <br/>
the place, and that hamburger wrappers were as likely as not to go out the <br/>
window of a car.  I told them about how the old glass would weather, and what <br/>
had been in the sand and sun of New Mexico for long enough would turn into <br/>
smooth-edged, opaque little jewels we used for hopscotch markers.  Pogs to <br/>
hopscotch--full circle, because I had those bottles.<br/>
<br/>
My maiden name was Adams, and I remember being taunted by kids singing the <br/>
theme song to The Addams Family TV show, but that line &quot;Their house is a <br/>
museum where people come to see &#39;em&quot; stuck with me always.  When I go to <br/>
other people&#39;s houses I love to see what they have.  The things they&#39;ve <br/>
chosen to keep, or collected over the years, teach me a good deal about those <br/>
people themselves--their interests, their history, their sense of humor, and <br/>
philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my kids get bored, and I can light up a half hour by digging into <br/>
some box or drawer and producing something they&#39;ve never yet seen.  Like a <br/>
magician pulling a bouquet of flowers out of a wand, I pull out a little <br/>
doll, or some Australian coins, electric curlers (for sorting, putting back <br/>
on the rods, and discussing), muffin tins, poker chips, grandpa&#39;s bow ties, a <br/>
hand-cranked egg beater to froth up soapy water (I wish I had a hand-cranked <br/>
drill; my dad did).  Whenever I pull these things out I tell the kids why I <br/>
have them and what I know about them.  I told about the gold strip in <br/>
Australian paper money, about ties my dad used to have with cowboys and <br/>
bucking broncos on them, about patterned muffin tins being pressed kind of <br/>
like steel car parts are pressed, of getting my hair stuck in electric <br/>
curlers when I was a teenager and crying because I was afraid my long hair <br/>
would have to be cut off.<br/>
<br/>
Can you remember visiting grandparents or older relatives when you were young <br/>
and finding cool &quot;stuff&quot; in their storerooms?  My granny had &quot;carding combs&quot; <br/>
I think she called them--steel brushes for cleaning cotton and lining up the <br/>
fibres.  She never spun, as far as I know, but she would use raw cotton to <br/>
put into quilts, taking the seeds out herself and carding the cotton.  When <br/>
my mom was little, their whole family had picked cotton by hand for a living, <br/>
moving from town to town in West Texas.  My other grandmother, my Mamaw, had <br/>
an ironing machine, and said they used to iron sheets and pillow cases with <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably things in your house that would fascinate your children <br/>
but you haven&#39;t thought to offer or they haven&#39;t found the good stuff yet.  <br/>
Consider interesting things you have which might be of interest for being <br/>
old, foreign, specially made or obtained under special circumstances:<br/>
<br/>
ornaments<br/>
dishes / pots /molds<br/>
silverware--even one old piece you know something about<br/>
egg beater<br/>
flour sifter<br/>
can openers (&quot;church keys&quot;)<br/>
old bottles or other containers<br/>
your old clothes from the 60&#39;s or 70&#39;s<br/>
recordings--reel to reel, 45&#39;s, 78&#39;s, 8-tracks<br/>
manual typewriter<br/>
push mower<br/>
pre-transistor radio<br/>
musical instruments<br/>
jewelry (and any old photos of people wearing that actual jewelry)<br/>
photos of people with cars (I try to get cars in photos to date them)<br/>
books, magazines<br/>
clippings<br/>
ribbons from 4-H, scout badges, school certificates, class photos, report <br/>
cards<br/>
toys from your childhood<br/>
awards / trophies (photos of the activity?)<br/>
funeral cards<br/>
wedding announcements/certificates<br/>
birth announcements<br/>
games (any old monopoly games in your attic?)<br/>
teach clapping games or jump rope (living history museum &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
foods no longer commonly used (find a fondue pot and make them something)<br/>
poker chips (patterns, counting, sorting)<br/>
sewing supplies / buttons<br/>
old shoes<br/>
uniforms<br/>
curlers / bobby pins <br/>
drafting supplies<br/>
typewriter eraser with a brush<br/>
old pens, paper, ancient stationery<br/>
flip-open address book like people had on desks in 1963<br/>
old phone<br/>
old phonebook or school annual with alpha prefixes--find out what your local <br/>
prefix used to be (if it&#39;s old enough)<br/>
art<br/>
music<br/>
things relating to WWII, Korea, Viet Nam<br/>
<br/>
Many people in the southwest have wagon wheels.  They&#39;re not flat—the hub is <br/>
out at an angle from the wheel, and the spokes hold it at that angle for <br/>
strength and stability.  It&#39;s fascinating to look at one, and touch it, and <br/>
know that it took an experienced wheelwright to make that wheel, and a <br/>
blacksmith to put the iron on it, and that the very wheel came here from <br/>
somewhere else—maybe Mexico, maybe Missouri, maybe Kansas.  It was made <br/>
somewhere, and came here, and now it&#39;s sitting in someone&#39;s yard.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have rocks or mineral samples?<br/>
Do you have an emerald or a ruby or a diamond?<br/>
Do you have a really old camera?<br/>
Any leather-bound books or boxes?<br/>
<br/>
My husband has something the kids haven&#39;t seen yet--a set of bongo drums.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s at your house?</div>
