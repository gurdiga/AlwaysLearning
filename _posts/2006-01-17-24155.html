That&#39;s a link to something I just received by e-mail, called<br/>
Life-long Learning<br/>
A project of<br/>
A COALITION FOR SELF-LEARNING<br/>
&quot;The White Paper&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a general report on alternative education, mentioned John Holt  <br/>
and has some info on homeschooling too.<br/>
<br/>
Their main page is<br/>

It&#39;s not directly about unschooling, but some of you might be able to  <br/>
use it for one reason or another.  It might serve as a bridge for  <br/>
some of you whose educator relatives think you&#39;re just off the wall,  <br/>
or those who are involved with alternative schools or who are former  <br/>
educators who just want assurance that all the school reform hasn&#39;t  <br/>
been forgotten... there it is.<br/>
