<div id="ygrps-yiv-89025570">I have just received a letter from my 8 yr old DS&#39;s paediatrician, for an appointment for the end of January, with regard to his Aspergers dx. I have managed to stall this appointment for some time but am now stuck.<br/>
<br/>
We have practically and emotionally moved so far away from this dx, however I don&#39;t think we can retract the dx from the records. Also we get disability benefits for him without which we would struggle more financially [eek]. <br/>
<br/>
There is currently a political culture here in the UK of finding &quot;hidden&quot; children who are, by the government&#39;s definition, at risk of abuse, so thus far we have attended medical appointments to avoid be flagged up as &quot;at-risk&quot;. DS knows he has a chronic bowel problem so we attend gastro-enterologist appointments, though we distort the truth about DS&#39;s progress out of pull-ups.<br/>
<br/>
This paediatrician appointment is different because we don&#39;t want to sit and discuss DS&#39;s &quot;autism&quot; in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know how to handle this appointment or how to talk to DS about it.<br/>
<br/>
How do others deal with these conflicts between the state machine and personal ways of living? Can anyone help me sort through all of this?<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate any thoughts.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

examined and the second appointment where you discuss his diagnosis and <br/>

<br/>
Or if they won&#39;t agree to that, can you bring another adult with you? That way your son can leave the office as soon as his exam is over and you can talk privately with the doctor.<br/>

<br/>
You could ask the doctor not to talk about &quot;Asperger&#39;s&quot; when you&#39;re there, not in front of your son.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe take some local UK articles about home education with you to leave with him.  If he expresses any concerns, ask him to read those and then call you.   He might not want to read them, which is fine.  But you have made your move, which is that you have a plan which he is welcome to read about, and you&#39;re willing to discuss it further, later, not with your son in the room, IF the doctor checks out what you&#39;re involved in.<br/>
