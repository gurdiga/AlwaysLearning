<div id="ygrps-yiv-176534116"><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>This week I had my first real &quot;Oh, I get it!&quot; radical unschooling mom moment.  (Phew, that&#39;s a mouthful.)</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>I am slowly (I mean, fossilization-slowly) working my way over the big 6 of unschooling to adapt our life to a radical unschooling lifestyle.  I still have plenty of hang ups but one that has never phased me is clothes.  I have a 5yo daughter and I&#39;ve always told her, &quot;As long as your clothes are clean and modest, I&#39;m not worried about what you wear.&quot;  And this has been a great sense of freedom for her.  Pink polka dot pants with a neon orange striped shirt?  Sure!  Pajama bottoms and a MLP t-shirt?  Great!  Snow White Halloween costume?  Don&#39;t forget the tiara!  My son is the same way.  If their clothes are dirty, I encourage them to change (if we are going out -- at home I&#39;m not so worried.  Long as they&#39;ve changed every 24 hours or so, I&#39;m good.) and I have asked my daughter to put something over the odd tank top t-shirt, but on the whole, it&#39;s worked out remarkably well.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>This week, my mother came over to visit with us and to watch my 2yo while my daughter and I were in seeing the optometrist.  My daughter had out on a pair of purple leggings pants and a purple and grey t-shirt with a sewn on vest, backwards.  I was going to ask her to turn it around but I got sidetracked and forgot about it.  If it had been facing the right way, it would have been cute.  But that&#39;s what she had picked out and that was fine with me.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>My mother arrived and she started helping me with my housework before we went to our appointments.  To my mother, this involved bathing my 2yo (he&#39;d had a bath the night before, I don&#39;t know why she felt the need to give him another one) and then helping my 5yo clean her room.  All the while I am running around trying to get my housework done before we leave.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>Suddenly my daughter comes down with the most sullen, angry face.  She&#39;s wearing different clothes -- a grey shirt with butterflies and a pair of burgundy pants that match the butterflies.  She also has a good from a puffy vest on her head (unattached to said puffy vest) and she is just miserable.  I ask her what&#39;s wrong and she states that she doesn&#39;t like her outfit.  I ask her why not and she said Nanny made her change it.  I asked why, since the other outfit was clean and perfectly fine, except the shirt was backwards.  She just shrugged.  So I asked my mother and she said that because her shirt was weird she made her change.  </span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>I was bothered by this -- how my mother just assumed that what she was wearing wasn&#39;t good enough and made her change.  So right there, in front of my mother, I told my daughter she could go change into whatever she wanted, or could put something else on to make the outfit hers.  But my poor sweet little girl was just so defeated at the idea of being forced to wear something she didn&#39;t want to that she just muttered, &quot;No, it&#39;s fine&quot; and moved on.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>Later on, my mother told her to take off the hood she still was wearing on her head, which she refused.  My mother started telling her she wasn&#39;t allowed to go anywhere with it on.  Of course, it did indeed look silly to be wearing a hood without a jacket or vest attached, but that&#39;s not how our family deals with things like that.  And so I stepped in, trying to help them both come to a satisfying compromise.  And then, my mother said something that just bore right through my heart.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess Nanny will just wait in the car when you go anywhere, since I don&#39;t want to be seen with you wearing that on your head.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>And at that moment, I realized that my daughter had no voice against my mother.  Nothing she said or did with regards to the hood would be accepted.  She had no worth or respect with regards to this hood.  Don&#39;t get me wrong -- my mother absolutely adores my children, and there&#39;s nothing my children love more than to visit with Nanny.  But this comment just broke me.  And I realized that if she had no voice, she couldn&#39;t stand up for herself.  She needed me to be her champion, to stand up for her and to say what she wanted to say without being in a place where she would be punished for speaking to an adult in what would be preceived as rude.  </span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span><br></span></div><p><span></span></p><div class="ygrps-yiv-176534116_209g ygrps-yiv-176534116_2vxa" style="direction:ltr;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><span>So I was able to help them come to an agreement.  My daughter agreed to wear the hood in the car, and to and from the stores we visited, but once inside the buildings, she would take it off.  I could see my mother was not very happy with this agreement, but frankly, at that point, I couldn&#39;t care less.  My daughter&#39;s heart and happiness was more valuable to me than my mother getting her way.  </span></div><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-176534116yui-cursor"></span></p></div>

<div dir='ltr'>I&#39;m glad you feel like you are starting to move in the right direction. &nbsp;I had a few thoughts about your post.<div><br></div><div>-=-&nbsp;<span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17.08px;white-space:pre-wrap;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">I am slowly (I mean, fossilization-slowly) working my way over the big 6 of unschooling to adapt our life to a radical unschooling lifestyle.-=-</span></div><div><font color="#141823" face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17.08px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#141823" face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17.08px;white-space:pre-wrap;">I wonder why so slowly.  From your post, it sounds like your mother is very controlling and you have a hard time standing up to her/establishing boundaries. I wonder if you are moving so slowly so as not to upset your mother.  (Also, I&#39;m not sure what the &quot;big 6 of unschooling&quot; is.)</span></font></div><div><font color="#141823" face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17.08px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#141823" face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:17.08px;white-space:pre-wrap;">-=- </span></font><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">My mother arrived and she started helping me with my housework before we went to our appointments.

Firstly, why is your mother deciding on her own that your child needs a bath and thinking that it is her role to make such a decision and act on it.  Are these her children or yours?  What if you had said &quot;Mom, he doesn&#39;t need a bath.  Please leave him be&quot;?</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div>Is there a reason that you need to run around making sure the house is spotless before you leave other than your mother&#39;s desire that it be that way? &nbsp;Maybe you like a spotless house. &nbsp;Maybe you appreciate your mom&#39;s help. &nbsp;But it sounds more like interfering than helping. &nbsp;Do YOU want it like that or do you want to please your mother? &nbsp;What would happen if you said &quot;Just leave it mom, I&#39;d rather focus on making a smooth transition for the kids to go out&quot;?</div><div><br></div><div>It sounds like your mother still thinks of you as her responsibility and she&#39;s coming over to make sure your house is clean before going out. &nbsp;Was her house spotless before she left? &nbsp;Is that how SHE likes it so she comes over to your house to make sure YOUR house is clean before you&#39;re allowed to go out? &nbsp;When you were young were you required to clean your room before being allowed to do things and this is a continuation of that? &nbsp;Things to think about.</div><div><br></div><div>-=-&nbsp;<span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">I was bothered by this -- how my mother just assumed that what she was wearing wasn&#39;t good enough and made her change.-=-</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">It is my opinion that this should bother you.  You&#39;re right - you are the girl&#39;s mother, not her.  For her to think she can just waltz on into your house and take control seems way out of balance to me.</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">-=- </span><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"> And so I stepped in, trying to help them both come to a satisfying compromise.  -=-</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">If you were talking about 2 children then I&#39;d say &quot;Great!&quot;  But you are talking about brokering a peace between a 5 year old and her grandmother.  Let me just say this - YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MOTHER&#39;S HAPPINESS.  You brought 2 children into the world and you are responsible for them.  You are not responsible for your mother.  You&#39;re not.  </span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">To me, part of my role as an unschooling mom is to act as a buffer for my kids from the outside world.  Grandparents and siblings (including in-laws) are part of that outside world and as such I do my best to ensure that those people don&#39;t damage my kids in ways that they damaged myself and my husband.</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">It&#39;s great to have extended family involved with our kids but unfortunately those relationships aren&#39;t always healthy and so for us they have become more complicated.  My relationships within my family come first - that means kids, husband and my own well being.</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div>-=-&nbsp;<span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"> Don&#39;t get me wrong -- my mother absolutely adores my children, and there&#39;s nothing my children love more than to visit with Nanny.-=-</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">Then hopefully she will be open to making changes in her behavior that will make things easier for you and your children.  It has been  my experience, however, that controlling Grandmothers have a hard time seeing that they need to change.  It is much easier if YOU stay the same.  Hence my questioning of your &quot;</span><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17.08px;white-space:pre-wrap;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">fossilization-slowly&quot; changes.</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17.08px;white-space:pre-wrap;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div>If you have a 5 and a 2 year old then you are really not unschooling yet. &nbsp;The older one would probably be going to school this fall and that&#39;s when you will truly be unschoolers. &nbsp;Let me ask you this - how do you think your mother is going to respond to the fact that your daughter will not be learning the same things in the same ways that she expects? &nbsp;What will you say to her if your daughter is 7, 8, 9 years old and not reading. &nbsp;Not adding and subtracting, doing work sheets, showing the kind of paper trail that she expects. &nbsp;Her friend&#39;s grandchildren will be doing things differently and she will most likely draw comparisons. &nbsp;I would suggest that if you are truly planning to unschool then you should start working on standing up for yourself and your decisions because it is not going to get easier. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>-=-&nbsp;<span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess Nanny will just wait in the car when you go anywhere, since I don&#39;t want to be seen with you wearing that on your head.-=-</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><font color="#141823" face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">This suggests to me that it will not be an easy thing to go against your mother&#39;s wishes.  I would suggest to you that it&#39;s time to stop pussy footing around her and get serious.  Because if you are going to let your mother stand between you and your children (not sure how her relationship is with your husband) then that is going to be a serious impediment to unschooling. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">The clock is ticking and I don&#39;t think you can afford to move at the pace of a fossil.  I would suggest that it&#39;s time to step up and start standing fully behind your choices.  If you can&#39;t do that then you may want to consider taking a more traditional path.  And if your going to take a more traditional path then you probably want to start getting your daughter ready for that.  Either way, it&#39;s time to get serious about it.</span></div><div><div><div id="ygrps-yiv-694205883ecxygrp-mlmsg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-694205883ecxygrp-msg" style=""><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-694205883ecxygrp-msg" style="">-Cass</div></div><div style="color:#fff;height:0;"></div>

Do you think she is truly just trying to help? Or is she perhaps trying to give you the message that you aren&#39;t good enough? Your kids don&#39;t measure up?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359367788"><p dir="ltr"><br>
-Don&#39;t get me wrong -- my mother absolutely adores my children, and there&#39;s nothing my children love more than to visit with Nanny.-</p>
<p dir="ltr">My grandmother was like this. She was bossy and image-conscious and had been a kindergarten teacher. When my sister and I were little, we adored her. She had lots of fiddly things-miniatures, Victorian knick-knacks, jewelry boxes. She would take us shopping and set up art projects. It was all well and good until we started to bridle against the condescension, the patronization, the manipulation. &quot;Do you hate me?&quot; when I refused to make the bed, a kid&#39;s table with macaroni when the adults had lobster, &quot;When do the girls start wearing padded bras?&quot; to my mother, in front of me, during my early teens; this stuff adds up. By the time I was 14, neither of us wanted anything to do with her, and we were practically estranged by the time she died. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I didn&#39;t like the way she treated my mother, and it is a life&#39;s work to undo the damage she did with the precedent she set for my relationship with my own mother and *her* relationship with *my* kids. I see in my mother a lifetime of living as less than her whole, true self, because of her loss of her father very youn and her domineering mother. The troubled and murky space in my life where an easy relationship with my mother should be is a constant gravitational force in my work towards mental and physical health. I love my mother, as I loved my grandmother, but there are times when I would gladly trade that love for just liking her more instead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don&#39;t let your children&#39;s current adoration (which is a complex emotion and different from easy affection and comfort, reverential and not necessarily reciprocated in kind) be an excuse for abuse, how ever &quot;gentle&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; it is. My sister had some serious body image issues as a teen-my grandmother, not my mother, was the only one to ever comment on her weight or her body, and we didn&#39;t even live with her or see her all the time. </p>
<p dir="ltr">This might sound a little harsh. As Gandalf says, &quot;I&#39;m not trying to rob you, I&#39;m trying to help you.&quot; I wish so much that my mother had had the tools of unschooling to repair and redeem and redefine her relationship with her mother and herself. She tried, using the tools she hadn but they weren&#39;t powerful enough. *Someone* has to break the cycle. Let it be you.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a> is the list<br/>

That’s not all she can do.  <br/>
GO EASY on advice.  Think through three or four moves, not just one move.  What kind of chess would that be!?<br/>
If you CAN move, move?  <br/>
No.  Think carefully.  Consider the children FIRST.  Taking a bath is better than losing a grandmother.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039097438">-=-I wonder why so slowly.  From your post, it sounds like your mother is very controlling and you have a hard time standing up to her/establishing boundaries. I wonder if you are moving so slowly so as not to upset your mother.  (Also, I&#39;m not sure what the &quot;big 6 of unschooling&quot; is.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wondered what that “big 6”  might be too, but was hesitatant to ask.  I’ve never heard of it.<br/>
<br/>
But as to slowly, there are VERY MANY good reasons to go slowly.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>
<br/>
Sudden change is unstable and dangerous.<br/>
Gradual growth and understanding is the only way unschooling will be whole and good.<br/>
Rushing into it has destroyed families completely.<br/>
Rushing into it with bravado loaned by the “support” of others saying “GO FOR IT, nobody can stop you,” has caused people to discover that they CAN be stopped—by the fathers of the children, by social services, by judges.<br/>
<br/>
Rushing into it with bravado has caused some mothers to lose custody of children, so please, please chill with the advice to hurry and cold-heartedly abandon anything or anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The original poster wrote:  <br/>
<br/>
-=- My mother arrived and she started helping me with my housework before we went to our appointments.  To my mother, this involved bathing my 2yo (he&#39;d had a bath the night before, I don&#39;t know why she felt the need to give him another one) and then helping my 5yo clean her room.  All the while I am running around trying to get my housework done before we leave. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Someone (doesn’t matter who, don’t look back to see, don’t claim it):<br/>
<br/>
-=-This statement is sending up lots of red flags for me-=-<br/>
<br/>
It didn’t send up one single red flag for me.  It might be interesting to know how old all the mothers and children are in the discussion, but although it would be interesting, I don’t really want to know. :-)  I have suspicions.   <br/>
<br/>
Let’s say that the mother who asked might not want to sever ties with all her relatives.  Then she needs very different ideas.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is my opinion that this should bother you. -=-<br/>
Bad advice.<br/>
Incindiary advice.  <br/>
Harsh-and-too fast.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you were talking about 2 children then I&#39;d say &quot;Great!&quot;  But you are talking about brokering a peace between a 5 year old and her grandmother.  Let me just say this - YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MOTHER&#39;S HAPPINESS.  You brought 2 children into the world and you are responsible for them.  You are not responsible for your mother.  You&#39;re not.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Rather than choosing sides, looking at partnership would be better.  And looking at a peaceful environment.  <br/>
<br/>
The woman we’re talking about is not simply the mom’s mother.  Stop, anyone who is thinking that.<br/>
Children have a REAL, honest, legal and biological relationship with their grandparents.  That is not something any parent should break up lightly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To me, part of my role as an unschooling mom is to act as a buffer for my kids from the outside world. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I’m glad you wrote “to me” because it might be too personal for sharing here.  Let’s go with peaceful general principles.  Why should a child need a buffer to live in the real world?  They need partners, and helpers.  They need guides and assistants.  And a grandmother visiting is not “the outside world.”<br/>
<br/>
-=-Grandparents and siblings (including in-laws) are part of that outside world and as such I do my best to ensure that those people don&#39;t damage my kids in ways that they damaged myself and my husband.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Part of regaining equilibrium after childhood damage (from parents, in-laws or siblings) should be to realize that not all people are damaged by their relatives.  Your children don’t need to be damaged by you, and cutting them off from their grandparents might be something from which they would never recover.  If someone projects their own childhood hurts on everyone around, their advice could be tainted, harsh and negative.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  The older one would probably be going to school this fall and that&#39;s when you will truly be unschoolers.  Let me ask you this - how do you think your mother is going to respond to the fact that your daughter will not be learning the same things in the same ways that she expects?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is borrowing trouble.  Peace now will lead to peace later.  Antagonism now could lead to a shitstorm that would last a decade, or a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This suggests to me that it will not be an easy thing to go against your mother&#39;s wishes.  I would suggest to you that it&#39;s time to stop pussy footing around her and get serious. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope the original poster will disregard that suggestion, and NOT “get serious,” but continue to gradually learn more about her own children, herself, and unschooling, at the pace that helps her.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The clock is ticking and I don&#39;t think you can afford to move at the pace of a fossil.-=-=<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange">http://sandradodd.com/gradualchange</a><br/>
<br/>
Rushing does not help.<br/>
Hurrying to unschooling doesn’t work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would suggest that it&#39;s time to step up and start standing fully behind your choices.  If you can&#39;t do that then you may want to consider taking a more traditional path. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not “a choice” nor even a  bunch of choices.  It is a way of living, and of seeing the world, and it cannot and does not EVER form up whole overnight.  It’s not a decision one makes and keeps.  It takes a while to really BE an unschooler.  The more carefully one takes the hundreds of small steps toward it, the more calm and solid it will be.  And if it’s done without panic or urgency, it can include the grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
Burning bridges behind oneself has always been considered a bad move.<br/>
Burning all bridges because they’re “the outside world” is a supremely bad idea.<br/>

The education part, letting our children learn naturally based on their interests and passions, I have absolutely no quams about it whatsoever.

Do you need help buying curriculum?  Look at the workbooks I bought them!&quot;  Ugh, frustrating.  I&#39;ve been trying to come up with an answer to this when it comes up.  She won&#39;t like it.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;"><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">-=- </span><font color="#141823" face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">This suggests to me that it will not be an easy thing to go against your mother&#39;s wishes.  I would suggest to you that it&#39;s time to stop pussy footing around her and get serious.  Because if you are going to let your mother stand between you and your children (not sure how her relationship is with your husband) then that is going to be a serious impediment to unschooling. </span></font><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">-=-</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;"><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div><font color="#141823" face="helvetica, arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">Not easy, no.  She&#39;s fairly good at manipulating with guilt.  But I&#39;m not worried about that.  I&#39;ve been dealing with it for years -- I can handle it.  As for my husband, they&#39;re not terribly close.  We both deal with our separate families as issues come up.  Works for us.  </span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;"><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;"><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">-=- </span><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">The clock is ticking and I don&#39;t think you can afford to move at the pace of a fossil.  I would suggest that it&#39;s time to step up and start standing fully behind your choices.  If you can&#39;t do that then you may want to consider taking a more traditional path.  And if your going to take a more traditional path then you probably want to start getting your daughter ready for that.  Either way, it&#39;s time to get serious about it. </span><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">-=-</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;"><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34,34,34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.8px;"><span style="color:rgb(20,24,35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">To be honest, that&#39;s a rather bold and cut and dry statement.  No one&#39;s unschooling looks the same as another&#39;s.  I don&#39;t need to rush myself or my children to the detriment of our relationship or objectives in order to satisfy my mother or anyone else.  I would rather frustrate others by taking things slow than ruin the experience for myself or my children.  I stand fully behind my choices -- I&#39;m just taking my time to make sure I&#39;m making the right ones for my family.  I am serious.  </span></div></div></div></div>

Don&#39;t make her out to be.  She lives full time in an environment that supports her choices.  It won&#39;t help her if you portray her at the mercy of her grandmother.  And it won&#39;t help you come up with more helpful solutions for both parties if you view your daughter in this way.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;white-space:pre-wrap;">&lt;&lt;Don&#39;t get me wrong -- my mother absolutely adores my children, and there&#39;s nothing my children love more than to visit with Nanny.

Not every child has that in their lives.  Try not to be too fragile.  Don&#39;t break so easily.  Your daughter will learn more from seeing how you competently handle the tricky parts in relationships, than she will from seeing you heartbroken.  Almost all relationships have tricky parts.  I wish they didn&#39;t, but they sure seem to, to me.  When possible, navigate them with an attitude of generosity.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798744605">Perhaps your mother could benefit from reading a parenting book, or Unschooling book, that resonates with your style. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe choose a time, when you are both relaxed, and in a good place, to have a discussion about all of this. <br/>
<br/>
Explain to her that your parenting philosophy is similar to hers but that you have some differences. Ask her if she would be willing to listen to them. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a little comparison chat about how her parenting may have differed slightly from her own mother, or grandmothers. <br/>
<br/>
Tell her that you value her as your mom, and as a grandmother to your children, and that it&#39;s important to you, for the relationships between all of you to be as good as you possibly can make them. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps mention that there are new studies, or schools of thought, that suggest there are real benefits to allowing children to make many of their own safe choices. That allowing them to have a voice, and showing them that their opinion, and feelings, are just as important as ours, adds great value to their confidence and sense of self, when they become adults. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe explain that your daughter felt upset about her forcing her to change, and ask your mom how she would feel if someone did that to her today. <br/>
<br/>
Many people do not understand, that our children have the same kinds of feelings, and reactions, that we do! <br/>
<br/>
Talk to her about all of this, with the spirit of creating a close relationship between all of you. Tell your mom that it&#39;s important to you, for all of you to be close, And you don&#39;t want anything to get in the way of that. <br/>
<br/>
Definitely support your daughter through all of this! Explain that some parents don&#39;t allow their children to pick their own clothes And that granny may not understand that it&#39;s ok for them to! If your mom is receptive, and understanding about you allowing your daughter to make clothing choices on own, maybe you could help facilitate a little apology between them? <br/>
<br/>
My parents have always been overbearing and intolerant of children. <br/>
<br/>
It took many years for me to begin to stand up to them.  I did it gradually, and with kindness. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I have had to be firm, with my parents,  like when they were being  verbally abusive.  Most times involved me physically leaving if they didn&#39;t stop. And I wouldn&#39;t make a huge deal at the time. Just say, well. I have things to do on the way home so we are going to get going. Then have the conversation later to say that&#39;s really not ok.</div>

<br/>
Karen James wrote that, but I wanted to expand on it a little.<br/>
<br/>
My kids had grandparents until they were grown, on their dad’s side.  My mother-in-law was kind of snarky about me, but I decided early on to never be mean about it, and I wasn’t.  She lived into her 90’s, and eventually, because I had been nice to her and had prepared my children for visits to her, instead of trying to change her to suit me, after a dozen years or so she totally appreciated what unschooling was doing for our family, and said so, in writing—that we were good parents and our kids were great.<br/>
<br/>
Cycles can be broken without screaming fights and door slamming.  <br/>
Either life is long and you have some time, or life is short, and it’s not important.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking up even more irritating things for the granddaughter to wear, you could (easily, and kindly) find something that will satisfy the grandmother and the child.  Without doing that, the problem is there, in the mother who wants to spite her own mother.  That’s not partnering with your child.<br/>
<br/>
A child who is not under attack doesn’t need a champion.  The “attack” is left over in the mom.  <br/>
<br/>
Here’s a page about how unexamined childhood hurts can keep someone from being a good parent.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/issues/">http://sandradodd.com/issues/</a><br/>
Also there are ideas to move beyond that, and it doesn’t need to involve dramatic confrontation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623654968">-=-However, I tried relinquishing as many restrictions as I could when my oldest was 3ish, which is obviously too young, and I was so stressed out in giving her more freedoms, I actually ended up having panic attacks.-=-<br/>
<br/>
“Freedom,” it turns out, has messed up many attempts at unschooling.  When I find older uses of the term on my site, I try to rephrase now, as it tripped up too many people, and others outside this discussion wave it around like a banner, not helping ANYone.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/freedom">http://sandradodd.com/freedom</a><br/>
So the bad thing is that the idea of “freedoms” caused you panic attacks.<br/>
The good thing is that changing just a bit, to thinking about options and choices, can cause you to be calm for life. :-)<br/>
<br/>
“Freedom” suggests a person can do whatever the hell she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
Making good choices will quickly show that each choice should be made in the light of immediate factors, for the good of as many people as possible.  <br/>

<p dir="ltr">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to bully people into being anyone else, anyway. Working on loving the person as they are, and being our own best selves, is the only hope for truly strengthening a relationship. Strengthening the relationship with your mom might be the best approach to smoothing the path with your children.

It became clear why I would become nearly ill before my visits with my mom and dad. &nbsp; Down came the pedastal. &nbsp;I experienced how soul-shattering it can be to look inside. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4521" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4521" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">In acknowleging the problems with my parents, I naturally circled back to the problems I had with my spouse and children. I had to admit that I had often chosen the same relationship strategies my parents had chosen, which was mainly to control the situation at all costs. &nbsp;I knew I could not stand over them in judgment. &nbsp;That has been hard, because I had not allowed myself to get very angry with them as a youth. &nbsp;I had defended and admired them, even when they were cruel, usually chalking their actions up to what any good parent would do. &nbsp;I elevated them to a lofty and unrealistic status. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4523" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">So when I did admit that they had made mistakes, it came in an angry flood. &nbsp;I believe I sat in a stupor an entire afternoon, experiencing wave after wave of disgust as each memory came to the surface. &nbsp;Then followed a period where I turned upon myself and recalled times that I had played out similar dynamics with my children.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4525" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4525" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">Now the dust has settled, and awareness has taken firmer root, and while I still get sad, hope is close at hand. Unfortunately, the relationship with my parents has worsened, which I know doesn&#39;t sound hopeful. &nbsp;But it has not worsened because of my realizatons. &nbsp;There has not been a confrontation or discussion involving what I have learned. &nbsp;What is happening to my parents, I believe would have happened regardless of what changes I have gone through. &nbsp;They have chosen the path of alcoholism and it seems to get deeper each year. &nbsp;So while that part of the story is not so uplifting, what HAS improved is my ability to deal with the situation in a healthy way. &nbsp;Without a doubt, I owe a big chunk of my positive movement forward to the loving and rational discussion that occurs on this list.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">This post about &quot;being a champion for my daughter&quot; and the discussion it sparked is a great example of how I have been helped here. &nbsp;Upon reading the original poster&#39;s account of the grandmother manipulating her granddaughter&#39;s attire, I could immediately feel an emotional response rising inside of me. &nbsp;My knee-jerk reactions were bubbling pretty fiercly by the time I concluded my reading. &nbsp;I was sympathizing heavily with the young girl in the story. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4527" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">I once had a pair of Converse All-Stars on which I had inscribed all of my favorite band logos. &nbsp;At thirteen, they were a prized possession. &nbsp;I wore them everywhere, so I had them on when we left for a holiday visit with extended family. &nbsp;About halfway through the carride, my mother noticed what shoes I was wearing and flew into a rage. &nbsp;She had my father pull the car over, came to the backseat where I was, and intimidated me into handing my shoes over to her. &nbsp;She instructed my father to continue driving and when he reached full speed, she tossed my shoes out the window, one at a time. &nbsp;When we reached our destination, she made a big deal about telling all of my relatives that we had to go to a department store to get me some proper shoes (which ended up being some awkward dress shoes). &nbsp;The way everyone coped with the shame of the incident was to make a big joke about it. &nbsp;My parents still tell the story and laugh about how rebellious I was. In a few years, I had fully internalized and accepted their claims that I was wickedly rebellious, and I began adulthood as a confused and frightened young woman. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4529" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4529" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">I felt a pang of grief while I pictured the young girl with her harmless hood and the grandmother who didn&#39;t want to be seen with her. &nbsp;Then, I read the first and inflammatory (albiet, with good intentions) response in the List. &nbsp;My blood started boiling and I wanted to shout an &quot;Amen&quot; as the writer challenged the original poster to confront the challenge with her mother head on. &nbsp;All of my hurt was merging with the hurt of the one I was reading about, and there was only the narrow feeling of wanting it to end NOW and at all costs.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4507" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4507" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">But then came the posts that are the reason I keep coming back here; the ones that point toward alternate paths, &nbsp;gradual change, and understanding. &nbsp;I come here not to get myself into flames of emotion or to attack issues. &nbsp;Letting my emotions addictingly take over has gotten me into enough messes. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4532" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4532" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">I am here because of the sensible examples of folks thinking things through and urging a course that is thoughtful and peaceful. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4534" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4534" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">I am going to see my parents in two days and I am feeling better about it than I have, probably, ever. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they are more steeped in alcohol than ever, but I am not angry about it and I know better than to take it personally. &nbsp;It is painful, but I have tools to deal with the pain constructively. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t want to let this day pass without thanking you (when I say &quot;you&quot; I mean everyone who posts so thoughtfully here) for your contribution to my healing.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4536" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4536" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998" dir="ltr">It is true that I regressed for a minute, getting caught up in the drama and pain of the wrongs of my childhood. &nbsp;You were there to remind me that I love my parents, that they didn&#39;t always have it easy growing up, and ultimately I want things to get better. &nbsp;For that to happen, &nbsp;I need to make conscious and loving choices. &nbsp;I need to let it happen one moment at a time, and not get in such a damn fury over it. &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4538" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4538" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">Many thanks! &nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4538" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4540" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998">Jennifer</div><div dir="ltr" id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4542" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"><br id="ygrps-yiv-223454998yui_3_16_0_1_1450301413078_4544" class="ygrps-yiv-223454998"></div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060201099">Jennifer, I’m really sorry about your mom throwing your shoes out the window.  That’s really awful.  She should’ve looked at you before you left the house (and many other times, lovingly, and kindly), and found other shoes at home.  Or just put them away when you got there.  I was sad for thirteen-year-old you when I read that.<br/>
<br/>
My mom threw a yoyo out the car window once because I wouldn’t put the string on my middle finger.  I had it on my index finger.  She got so mad that I wouldn’t do it the way she said to, that she said give it to me, and just threw it out.<br/>
<br/>
On a long car ride, she threatened to throw my teddy bear out the window because I was holding him up to an open window so he could “see out.”  Twelve-hour drive, parents smoking, me easily car sick…   Just the thought that she would CONSIDER throwing him out still hurts me.   I still have that bear, but my mom is gone and I don’t mind that.   Still, I was kind to her and tried to help her to the end.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone battles for years, they have either battled and won (caused a loss to the opponent), or have battled and lost (so it was a waste of time and energy, and surely did them harm).<br/>
<br/>
The world is big,  Avoidance is better than fighting. <br/>
<br/>
My own integrity and my own goodness/virtue/whatever one wants to consider that was more important to me than “winning” something that couldn’t be won and wasn’t worth winning.  My mom was sober for nine years, until Kirby was nine or ten, and she started drinking again.  It was a nice break, for me, but by then I was learning that I shouldn’t try to “fix her” or save her, because I couldn’t anyway.  Detachment.  By the time she started up again, I was stronger and more solid, and had three children, and knew first hand that NOT drinking was better for me, my relationship with my husband, and for my children.  So I lived there, and helped my mom a little when she asked, and stayed a polite distance when she wasn’t asking.<br/>
<br/>
Living so that our children have fewer traumatic memories is better than trying (vainly) to change the past, or to change their grandparents.  <br/>
<br/>
Jennifer’s ending is beautiful:<br/>
<br/>
-=- I need to make conscious and loving choices.  I need to let it happen one moment at a time, and not get in such a damn fury over it.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Amen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095554568"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">-=-On a long car ride, she threatened to throw my teddy bear out the window because I was holding him up to an open window so he could “see out.”-=-</span><br><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Sandra, my heart breaks for little Sandra when I read this. I read it for the first time a few days ago and have thought about it a lot since. Your innocence and sweetness juxtaposed to a jaded meanness makes my eyes well up with tears. </span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">The most beneficial thing radical unschooling has taught is empathy. True empathy. There may have been a time when one of my kid&#39;s would have been doing something that irritated me tremendously and I would have lashed out for them to &quot;stop it! I&#39;ll get rid of all those ______ if you don&#39;t stop bugging me with them!&quot; I cringe to remember that old self. That very reactive and unthoughtful self. And guess who I learned it from? My mom. My own mother, whom I love dearly and tenderly today, was a most reactive and quick tempered woman while I was growing up. She asked me questions and never listened, she was more concerned with men than me, and as a child, I was always much happier at my dad&#39;s house. And then, the day after my 14th birthday, my oldest sister died and suddenly my mother realized that her children were mortal and she worked on changing herself. The change didn&#39;t happen overnight, and like most of us, she&#39;s still working on becoming a better person. Even though she made big changes to herself, it took a long time for me to forgive her and when I had my oldest child at the young age of 22, a lot of the hurt she had caused me flooded my memory and heart in full force. Once I held my son in my arms, I thought &quot;how could she ever have treated me like that? She never loved me!&quot; And then as my son got older and more babies came, I found myself unconsciously mimicking her behavior toward me. I was reactive and short tempered. I didn&#39;t want to &quot;play&quot; with my children. I wanted lots of kids, but I thought being a mother meant keeping them clean, polite, and conformed to what society wanted them to be, even though I have been a rebel my entire life! As my oldest son floundered, I realized something had to change. And that something was me. I found radical unschooling and as per that short-tempered, do-it-now self, wanted to jump in head first and be a radical unschooler!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">But, I listened to the sage advice given on this forum and went slowly. One thing at a time, I told myself. I am SO GRATEFUL that my kids were all still quite young when I came to radical unschooling because they are getting the best of me and my husband! And I have truly forgiven my mother because if nothing else, unschooling has taught me empathy. Now, when my children are playing joyously, I feel inner joy and peace. When we&#39;re in the car and they want to play car games, I am so happy to play with them! I love that they consider me fun and attentive. I love that they give me big hugs and tell me how much they love me. And that when they&#39;re having a problem with something, or my oldest son is crying because he can&#39;t get his PS4 to work, I don&#39;t do what my mother would have done (get impatient and act incompetent as a helper), I EMPATHIZE with him and help. I tell myself &quot;imagine if you were him and something very important to you isn&#39;t working, how would you feel?&quot; And my husband does the same. We are all working together as a team and helping each other as though our own joy depended on it. And it does! Our children know that we are on their team--something I never got from my own mother. And that&#39;s okay now. I&#39;ve really forgiven her and she is now learning from me! She says to me all the time &quot;oh, I wish I would have had your wisdom and raised you all this way.&quot; </span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Little does she know, it&#39;s not really my wisdom :). It&#39;s the wisdom I&#39;ve learned here.</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">And, now I can empathize with her. And the way she was raised. In fact, she pours her heart out to me over the traumas she experienced with her own mother. She can still be reactive and she&#39;s still not the best listener in the world, but my children love her and so do I. She stays with the kids sometimes and raves about them and they about her. They know the difference--with Hunny (what they call her), they watch whatever she wants to watch on TV because she can&#39;t stand cartoons, and they&#39;re okay with that. They complain a bit, but the whole sum of the experience with Hunny is greater that the parts. </span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">My point in all this writing, is that radical unschooling can bring about such a sense of peace with one&#39;s own self, that it can be poured into the being of another. I *enjoy* finding ways to make other people around me comfortable, including my children. I *want* the people who come to my home to enjoy their experience here. Sometimes, we have to bend a little for others, and isn&#39;t that empathy? To feel another&#39;s feeling and adjust your own reaction to fit their need? Keeping peace has become the number one priority in our home, so sometimes we have to get creative to make that happen! Consideration for others is key.</span></div><div> </div><div>I hope this helps with the situation with your mom. It&#39;s funny because I called my grandmother Nanny too. And I loved my nanny so much! I miss her everyday! The gift of grandparents is real, so please try to make it work. </div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1095554568gmail_extra"><br clear="all"><div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1095554568gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><span style="border-collapse:collapse;"><font face="georgia, serif" style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"></span></font><font><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Warmly,</span><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"> </div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:book antiqua, palatino;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:book antiqua, palatino;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Megan</strong></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></div></font><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"></div><p style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;"><font face="georgia, serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;font-size:13px;"><font face="georgia, serif"><span></span><span></span><br></font></p></span></div></div></div>

<div dir='ltr'><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">Megan thank you so much for writing this.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">I personally have found it so helpful to read your beautiful reminder that empathy is one of the most beneficial things to come from radical unschooling.</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">It&#39;s a timely reminder for me too, &nbsp;in the week I found out that my mum is visiting again this summer from Australia, and for a long period.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;"><br

this also.</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">I had such a harsh childhood with my mothers temper and intolerance and meanness, and with physical violence, and often.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">I cried reading all the stories in this thread.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">I felt like empathy died in me eventually, and fear and anxiety grew in its place, and have clouded my whole life until I found radical unschooling.&nbsp;</div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;"><br style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;"></div><div style="line-height:21.299999237060547px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-size:15px;">I have written of the regrets I have with coming to this so late with my son, and I suspect he may still have some stored anger and resentment towards me in his memories....But I will keep on keeping on with kindness and empathy as my guides, and hopefully the burning fire like pain in his belly will be very tiny compared to the wildfire I had raging in mine for many years , and can still be ignited in her presence if I&#39;m not being mindful.&nbsp;</div><div

68);font-size:15px;">Deeply Loving connecting and empathising with my boys has helped me every day to keep that fire out, and in her presence especially.&nbsp;<span style="line-height:22.719999313354492px;font-size:12pt;">I wrote about that victory and realisation once on here, and its now on Sandra&#39;s healing page (anonymously though, just in case...).

  <div id="ygrps-yiv-1578661788ecxygrp-msg" style="">


    <div id="ygrps-yiv-1578661788ecxygrp-text">
      
      
      <br><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">-=-On a long car ride, she threatened to throw my teddy bear out the window because I was holding him up to an open window so he could “see out.”-=-</span><br><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Sandra, my heart breaks for little Sandra when I read this. I read it for the first time a few days ago and have thought about it a lot since. Your innocence and sweetness juxtaposed to a jaded meanness makes my eyes well up with tears.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">The most beneficial thing radical unschooling has taught is empathy. True empathy. There may have been a time when one of my kid&#39;s would have been doing something that irritated me tremendously and I would have lashed out for them to &quot;stop it! I&#39;ll get rid of all those ______ if you don&#39;t stop bugging me with them!&quot; I cringe to remember that old self. That very reactive and unthoughtful self. And guess who I learned it from? My mom. My own mother, whom I love dearly and tenderly today, was a most reactive and quick tempered woman while I was growing up. She asked me questions and never listened, she was more concerned with men than me, and as a child, I was always much happier at my dad&#39;s house. And then, the day after my 14th birthday, my oldest sister died and suddenly my mother realized that her children were mortal and she worked on changing herself. The change didn&#39;t happen overnight, and like most of us, she&#39;s still working on becoming a better person. Even though she made big changes to herself, it took a long time for me to forgive her and when I had my oldest child at the young age of 22, a lot of the hurt she had caused me flooded my memory and heart in full force. Once I held my son in my arms, I thought &quot;how could she ever have treated me like that? She never loved me!&quot; And then as my son got older and more babies came, I found myself unconsciously mimicking her behavior toward me. I was reactive and short tempered. I didn&#39;t want to &quot;play&quot; with my children. I wanted lots of kids, but I thought being a mother meant keeping them clean, polite, and conformed to what society wanted them to be, even though I have been a rebel my entire life! As my oldest son floundered, I realized something had to change. And that something was me. I found radical unschooling and as per that short-tempered, do-it-now self, wanted to jump in head first and be a radical unschooler!!</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">But, I listened to the sage advice given on this forum and went slowly. One thing at a time, I told myself. I am SO GRATEFUL that my kids were all still quite young when I came to radical unschooling because they are getting the best of me and my husband! And I have truly forgiven my mother because if nothing else, unschooling has taught me empathy. Now, when my children are playing joyously, I feel inner joy and peace. When we&#39;re in the car and they want to play car games, I am so happy to play with them! I love that they consider me fun and attentive. I love that they give me big hugs and tell me how much they love me. And that when they&#39;re having a problem with something, or my oldest son is crying because he can&#39;t get his PS4 to work, I don&#39;t do what my mother would have done (get impatient and act incompetent as a helper), I EMPATHIZE with him and help. I tell myself &quot;imagine if you were him and something very important to you isn&#39;t working, how would you feel?&quot; And my husband does the same. We are all working together as a team and helping each other as though our own joy depended on it. And it does! Our children know that we are on their team--something I never got from my own mother. And that&#39;s okay now. I&#39;ve really forgiven her and she is now learning from me! She says to me all the time &quot;oh, I wish I would have had your wisdom and raised you all this way.&quot;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Little does she know, it&#39;s not really my wisdom :). It&#39;s the wisdom I&#39;ve learned here.</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">And, now I can empathize with her. And the way she was raised. In fact, she pours her heart out to me over the traumas she experienced with her own mother. She can still be reactive and she&#39;s still not the best listener in the world, but my children love her and so do I. She stays with the kids sometimes and raves about them and they about her. They know the difference--with Hunny (what they call her), they watch whatever she wants to watch on TV because she can&#39;t stand cartoons, and they&#39;re okay with that. They complain a bit, but the whole sum of the experience with Hunny is greater that the parts.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;">My point in all this writing, is that radical unschooling can bring about such a sense of peace with one&#39;s own self, that it can be poured into the being of another. I *enjoy* finding ways to make other people around me comfortable, including my children. I *want* the people who come to my home to enjoy their experience here. Sometimes, we have to bend a little for others, and isn&#39;t that empathy? To feel another&#39;s feeling and adjust your own reaction to fit their need? Keeping peace has become the number one priority in our home, so sometimes we have to get creative to make that happen! Consideration for others is key.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I hope this helps with the situation with your mom. It&#39;s funny because I called my grandmother Nanny too. And I loved my nanny so much! I miss her everyday! The gift of grandparents is real, so please try to make it work.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1578661788ecxgmail_extra"><br clear="all"><div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1578661788ecxgmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><span style="border-collapse:collapse;"><font face="georgia, serif" style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"></span></font><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:'book antiqua', palatino;font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:'book antiqua', palatino;font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:'book antiqua', palatino;font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:'book antiqua', palatino;font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:'book antiqua', palatino;font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:'book antiqua', palatino;font-size:12pt;">Warmly,</span><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"> </div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:book antiqua, palatino;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style="font-family:book antiqua, palatino;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Megan</strong></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"></div><p style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><font face="georgia, serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><font face="georgia, serif"><span></span><span></span><br></font></p></span></div></div></div>

-=-I have written of the regrets I have with coming to this so late with my son, and I suspect he may still have some stored anger and resentment towards me in his memories....But I will keep on keeping on with kindness and empathy as my guides, and hopefully the burning fire like pain in his belly will be very tiny compared to the wildfire I had raging in mine for many years , and can still be ignited in her presence if I&#39;m not being mindful. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I stopped arguing with my mom or criticizing her, in her later years.  I wasn’t really loving, I was just neutral/cold.  I wish things had worked out so that I could have been warmer with her.  Yes, her upbringing was hard, but she had been shown lots of generosity by others as an adult and was cynical and suspicious and critical instead of accepting, most of the time.  Until friends of mine steered me toward Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings in 1985, I was still trying to rescue and repair my mom, to support her (emotionally) and to bail her out financially and physically when she needed it, which was pretty often.<br/>
<br/>
Although it inconvenience my mom, I’m glad I found people who told me that someone else can’t “fix” an alcoholic, and that I was allowing her to ruin more lives than her own if I lived in her shadow as an adult.  I didn’t turn by back on her; she came to live with us for a year, and went to AA, and was sober for nine years.  But still…if a relationship can be salvaged, or if children and grandparents are afforded contact even if the middle generation is pissed off and wary, there are lots of advantages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018435751">I completely understand the pain of being the resilient child :-/ the accounts mentioned above are unfortunately familiar family stories. I am so pleased that we have all seen that we can do better, and have chosen to parent in a different way! And thanks Sandra for all your effort in this!<div>I agree that when possible, working through solutions to meet everyones needs or diffuse potentially difficult situations is indeed the better choice. I am still frustrated with my family and their inability to even grasp that they were/ are extremely abusive and cold. I have (for my part) tried to meet them halfway, or better. For years, though, is has been the way Sandra described her polite distance. I would have LOVED it if they would have been in any way the extended family my kids deserve, so if there is any hope left in that relationship and you can manage, I would encourage you to give it several attempts before withdrawal.</div><div><br></div><div>As others here have noted, kids are remarkably flexible and adept when they are included in the planning/ problem solving. I get some of my best advice from them :-)</div><div>Maybe the things that bug you are magnified in light of your history, maybe preventative measure would make things better. Not perfect but manageable.&nbsp;</div></div>
