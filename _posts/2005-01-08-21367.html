For the mom who asked about science and moving more toward unschooling, I  <br/>
thought it could be inspiring.  Cameron is coming to visit us in February,  so I <br/>
forwarded it to my husband too.<br/>
 <br/>
Because my kids never went to school, they had no deschooling.  I had,  but I <br/>
worked at it consciously and pointedly  when they were  younger.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
sometimes that those who did go to school first can be  the most appreciative <br/>
of unschooling.  My kids don&#39;t know any other way  except by the reports and <br/>
responses of their friends.  When they were  little, friends would say &quot;you <br/>
won&#39;t learn anything and you&#39;ll never get a  job.&quot;  Now that they&#39;re teens, and <br/>
their friends are that age or older, the  friends say &quot;YOU ARE SO LUCKY!&quot; (or <br/>
&quot;How did you do that?&quot; or &quot;How did you know  that?&quot;).<br/>

&gt; I am  very interested to hear about children who  came to unschooling   <br/>
&gt; late.<br/>
&gt; My son is 12 now and we  have been unschooling for 11  months.  I  am <br/>
&gt;  really<br/>
&gt; starting to feel the sands of time slip  through my  fingers!  I  can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; believe that<br/>
&gt; he will have a   learners permit to drive in 2 1/2 years!   How long <br/>
&gt; did  it<br/>
&gt; take  your son to heal Kelly?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He  left school at the end of sixth grade. He was 12.5. That summer he <br/>
&gt;  went<br/>
&gt; to Australia with People to People for three weeks. We spent the  rest <br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; summer just hanging out. I read the .com boards and  learned as much as <br/>
&gt; I  could<br/>
&gt; about unschooling. I  *understood* it, but I had a hard time putting it <br/>
&gt;  into<br/>
&gt;  practice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When loading the car for a trip, I&#39;d point out that  that was geometry! <br/>
&gt;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d nag him that he hadn&#39;t  read anything in a while. I would read a  <br/>
&gt; short<br/>
&gt; story to  him and ask him to draw a picture of it or of how it made him <br/>
&gt;   feel.<br/>
&gt; After a trip, I&#39;d suggest that he write me a paper about  it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah----I know. It took a while to make it work!  &lt;bwg&gt; I<br/>
&gt; probably could have knocked six-eight months off his  deschooling if <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d quit  nagging<br/>
&gt; and just TRUSTED  him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He spent 18 months doing NOTHING but sleeping, watching TV,  talking on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; phone, and eating.  Seriously. It was  painful to watch. BUT he needed <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; time to heal. It was VERY  important!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Slowly, he started to do more. He started with IMing  his friends. He&#39;d <br/>
&gt;  hated<br/>
&gt; the computer in school,  preferring to write assignments by hand. But  <br/>
&gt; he got<br/>
&gt;  *really* fast on the computer and knew more about its capabilities <br/>
&gt;  than  my<br/>
&gt; husband or me in just a few short months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I have another son, eight years younger. We&#39;d go somewhere almost every<br/>
&gt;  day----the park, the zoo, the beach, the library, a <br/>
&gt;  restaurant----*somewhere*.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d ask each day whether Cameron would like  to join us: his answer was <br/>
&gt; always,<br/>
&gt; &quot;No.&quot; Then.....one day, I  asked and he said, &quot;Yes!&quot; It was all I could <br/>
&gt; do not<br/>
&gt; to   jump up and do the happy dance----but I did one inside!   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then he started to join us more and more----and we  started to do <br/>
&gt; things HE<br/>
&gt; wanted to do. He started drawing again,  so I bought him some really <br/>
&gt; nice papers<br/>
&gt;  and  charcoals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He and his friends started skateboarding, so we got  him a skateboard <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; sent him to Camp Woodward that summer.  Then he started filming other <br/>
&gt; skaters, so<br/>
&gt; we got him a camera.  That eventually led to more filming (and his <br/>
&gt; first 6.5<br/>
&gt; minute  film). Now he volunteers at the local independent film theatre <br/>
&gt; and  is<br/>
&gt; called on by local film-makers to do camera work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He  also asked for drums (who knows why!?), so he got drums one  <br/>
&gt;  Christmas.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s really gotten into music. He&#39;s playing with three  bands---all  <br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; styles. He&#39;s had a few lessons, but  does it mostly on his own; only  <br/>
&gt; going to<br/>
&gt; Danny when he&#39;s  struggling with something. He got a high-tech <br/>
&gt; metronome   for<br/>
&gt; Christmas this year. (My dad thought that was SOOOO funny---that  a  <br/>
&gt; child would<br/>
&gt; *ask* for a metronome! &lt;g&gt;) He plays  three-four  hours/day---sometimes <br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt; Luckily, the drums  are in our DEtached garage!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s traveled to  Seattle with Wilderness Ventures. He&#39;s made many road <br/>
&gt;   trips<br/>
&gt; on his own since he got his license. He&#39;s flying out to  Albuquerque  by<br/>
&gt; himself next month and to Europe with his cousin in  September.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He has three jobs: delivering a weekly paper to  businesses,<br/>
&gt; pet/house-sitting, and catering. He has his volunteer gig at  the <br/>
&gt; theatre. He has  the<br/>
&gt; film-making that keeps him  thinking and the drumming that has him  <br/>
&gt; finding/playing<br/>
&gt;  gigs at different bars every now and then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s so busy now  ----like he&#39;s making up for those lost months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He thought he was  stupid and was going nowhere without a diploma. <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what he  heard from his friends. NOW his friends think his life is <br/>
&gt; pretty  sweet.<br/>
&gt; So does he! &lt;g&gt; He has three friends from school that he  still hangs <br/>
&gt; with.<br/>
&gt; His girlfriend, who is also in school. But  most of his friends are in <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; 20&#39;s, with one in his 30&#39;s and  2-3 in their 40&#39;s! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s into Buddhism and is a  vegetarian (mostly &lt;g&gt;). He has a lot of<br/>
&gt; questions and is not  afraid to ask them. He LIKES his parents! &lt;g&gt; How <br/>
&gt;  novel!  &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just looked up at the subject. It says &quot;pros-cons  question for <br/>
&gt; Kelly.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Cons: He still doesn&#39;t care to read much.  He prefers non-fiction <br/>
&gt; anyway---always<br/>
&gt; has. Fiction he prefers  through movies. Well, documentaries too! He <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; prefers   his information that way. But he reads just fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He has his own  back accounts and has been overdrawn once in three  <br/>
&gt; years.  I<br/>
&gt; doubt that&#39;ll happen again soon! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He sat in  on a college class last spring and was appalled at how <br/>
&gt; little   the<br/>
&gt; students wanted to be there. He liked the subject and participated  in <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; class, but I doubt he&#39;ll go to college. Some may see  that as a con. I <br/>
&gt; see  it as<br/>
&gt; well-thought out at this time.  But he knows he could do the  work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s good to his  girlfriend and sweet to the animals. He&#39;s gentle and<br/>
&gt; patient with his  little brother. He&#39;s a loyal friend, but seems to <br/>
&gt; stay  away  from<br/>
&gt; the trouble some of them seem to wallow in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He  seems more and more comfortable in his skin every day. Happy with <br/>
&gt; who  he<br/>
&gt; is and what he&#39;s doing. THAT is the best part!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That  deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He needs <br/>
&gt;  to  know<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to  be left to <br/>
&gt; heal. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this  incredibly fine line between <br/>
&gt; leaving<br/>
&gt; him alone and letting him  alone. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. But <br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; know  it  AFTER you&#39;re through it! &lt;G&gt; Go figure!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Riding in the car  was a great place for us to talk---that&#39;s why we <br/>
&gt; went to<br/>
&gt; the  beach so much that first year! Duncan would fall asleep in the <br/>
&gt; back  seat,<br/>
&gt; and Cameron and I could talk and talk and talk with no  interruptions <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; without looking at each other (at night with  the lights off is good <br/>
&gt; too!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quit nagging. Offer cool  things to do and good movies to watch. Eat <br/>
&gt; out a<br/>
&gt; lot. Be his  partner. Work together. Let him know that you&#39;re willing <br/>
&gt; to let  him<br/>
&gt; heal from that school damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It gets better! It  gets GREAT!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
