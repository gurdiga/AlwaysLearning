Questions to ask ourselves<br/>
By Hugh Mackay<br/>
February 1 2003<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Dad, what&#39;s a just war?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not now, sweetheart, I&#39;m busy. Can we talk later?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But you said if I ever needed to ask you anything ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OK, OK. What&#39;s the question?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A just war. How can any war be &#39;just&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ah. Yes. Good question. How did this come up, sweetheart?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You know, like, Iraq and everything? I heard someone on television - a <br/>
bishop, I think he was - saying there is such a thing as a just war. Did he <br/>
mean a holy war?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, no, not exactly. A holy war is when people fight over their religious <br/>
beliefs. When they think they really have God on their side.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if they are fighting each other over religion, wouldn&#39;t they all think <br/>
God was on their side?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Absolutely, sweetheart. That&#39;s exactly what happens in a holy war. But it&#39;s <br/>
rather silly describing any war as holy - war is ugly, brutal, violent and <br/>
repressive, and holiness is supposed to be about the opposite of all those <br/>
things. Anyway, history shows us that war is a completely futile way of <br/>
trying <br/>
to settle conflicts. Some time in the future, I&#39;m sure people will look back <br/>
and wonder how humans could have been so stupid as to go to war over <br/>
anything. <br/>
No one ever really wins, but a lot of people suffer and the result never <br/>
turns <br/>
out quite the way anyone intended. Never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So you&#39;re against war?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everyone&#39;s against war, angel. How could anyone be in favour of killing each <br/>
<br/>
other and destroying each other&#39;s cities and towns? You think war is about <br/>
soldiers, but innocent civilians, even children, are always killed in wars. <br/>
Of <br/>
course I&#39;m against war ... aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So are you, like, a pacifist?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, no, not exactly, although part of me would like to be. I admire <br/>
pacifists, but I think there are times when there really is no alternative to <br/>
<br/>
fighting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So that&#39;s what people mean by a just war?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I guess so. A just war is when you have to defend yourself because someone <br/>
has attacked you. Or when a friendly country is attacked and its leaders ask <br/>
you to help them defend themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So if America attacks Iraq and Iraq defends itself, that wouldn&#39;t be a just <br/>
war for America, but it would be for Iraq. And if Iraq asks one of its <br/>
friends <br/>
to help it defend itself against America, that would be a just war for the <br/>
other country, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple, I&#39;m afraid. There are such things as good guys <br/>
and bad guys, sweetheart. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy, so we don&#39;t think <br/>
anyone would be justified in defending him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if he doesn&#39;t attack anyone, how can invading his country be a just war? <br/>
<br/>
According to you, invading another country would always be wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, usually, but, see, everyone thinks Saddam has these really awful <br/>
weapons ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Worse than America&#39;s?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not worse, no. But, well, because he&#39;s a bad guy, people think he might <br/>
decide to use those weapons against some other country some day, so America <br/>
wants to invade his country and destroy the weapons before he can use them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Has he threatened to use them? Like, who does he want to attack?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He hasn&#39;t actually threatened to use them against anyone in particular - <br/>
except the Americans, of course, if they invade his country.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And us? Aren&#39;t we going to invade Iraq, too? We sent some soldiers off last <br/>
week. I saw that on TV, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No-one really knows, sweetheart. We mightn&#39;t actually be planning to invade. <br/>
<br/>
We might be just trying to scare Saddam into giving up his weapons. We might <br/>
be calling his bluff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if he isn&#39;t planning to attack anyone, wouldn&#39;t that mean Saddam won&#39;t <br/>
use his weapons unless he has to defend Iraq against an attack? So wouldn&#39;t <br/>
attacking him be the best way of making sure he does use his weapons?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s logical, but I guess our Government must think there&#39;s a huge risk he <br/>
<br/>
will use them on, on ... on someone else if we don&#39;t get in first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our life skills teacher said the end never justifies the means. Was she <br/>
wrong?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know, honey, I really don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;By the way, whatever happened to Osama bin Laden? I thought he was supposed <br/>
to be the world&#39;s No.1 bad guy. Is Saddam even worse?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re both pretty bad. They&#39;re terrorists, see? They both place a low <br/>
value <br/>
on human life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hmm. Dad, are we still holding little children behind razor wire in those <br/>
detention centres?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are, sweetheart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So are we good guys or bad guys?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good guys, definitely. No more questions, OK?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
