Others have complained over the years (many others?  Some others? Do  <br/>
I know the majority of others on this planet?) that we &quot;claim&quot; to be  <br/>
nice to our kids, but we&#39;re not that nice to people on the list, or  <br/>
that we are willing to let our kids learn at their own pace but we&#39;re  <br/>
not willing to let people on the list take their sweet and wasteful  <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, I can&#39;t keep someone from hanging around unschooling  <br/>
for years and resisting actually relaxing into DOING it wholly and  <br/>
well.   Some people are still in the defensive mode of &quot;You can&#39;t  <br/>
make me,&quot; no matter how self-defeating it is, and no matter how much  <br/>
damage it does to their relationships with their kids to refuse to  <br/>
even try some of the parenting practices many on this list have used  <br/>
with good effect for many years.  (No, I don&#39;t know the majority of  <br/>
people on this list and I don&#39;t know the majority of years in the  <br/>
history of this planet, not even if there are only 6,000  of them.)<br/>
<br/>
But this list is a discussion of unschooling.  It&#39;s not a list so  <br/>
that people can have the opportunity to experiment in dabbling in a  <br/>
discussion of unschooling.  The richness of the ongoing discussion of  <br/>
unschooling is my reason for maintaining and participating on this list.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Jon Tsosie had a job on a crew building solar houses for a  <br/>
research project in the 1970&#39;s.  At Ghost Ranch, they built several  <br/>
houses that were similar and had somewhat different solar collection  <br/>
arrangements.  Then they were measuring and proving this&#39;n&#39;that,  <br/>
later on.  He learned a lot.  He was being paid to work on those  <br/>
houses.  Other people would come by and pay money to learn about  <br/>
solar heating, and they would work on the houses too, for a while (I  <br/>
guess there were workshops periodically).  So the purpose of the  <br/>
existence of those houses was...  Well, people were going to live in  <br/>
them.  But there was some kind of grant money paid for the results of  <br/>
the scientific comparisons.  And they were being used as educational  <br/>
demonstrations too, of solar-collection construction.<br/>
<br/>
One project can serve many purposes.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that one project can serve ALL purposes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If my kids joined this list, I&#39;d be sure that they understood how the  <br/>
list works. I&#39;d be sure that they understood that we are here to  <br/>
sharpen up our thinking, to uncover hidden pitfalls in our thinking.  <br/>
I&#39;d be sure that the kids knew this list is for deeply considering and  <br/>
critically examining any and all ideas related to unschooling, big or  <br/>
small, expressed intentionally or not, by anyone. I&#39;d warn them not to  <br/>
post if they didn&#39;t welcome a critical analysis of whatever they said.  <br/>
AND, most important, I&#39;d tell my kids to wait a few weeks, read a lot,  <br/>
get used to the list before posting, so that they wouldn&#39;t be taken by  <br/>
surprise and feel attacked when their posts were critically examined  <br/>
by multiple people.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, apparently I&#39;d say the EXACT same thing to my kids as we  <br/>
repeatedly tell the adults who come here, voluntarily, and then  <br/>
complain that we don&#39;t give them freedom and respect. What does that  <br/>
mean, anyway? &quot;Freedom&quot; doesn&#39;t even make sense in this context. By  <br/>
&quot;respect&quot; I think they are complaining that their posts were  <br/>
critically examined and that potential flaws in their reasoning were  <br/>
pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is the way the list works. If that isn&#39;t okay with you, don&#39;t post.<br/>
<br/>
There are a handful of people who post on some other lists that I&#39;m on  <br/>
(not this one), whom I have so little respect for that I delete all  <br/>
their posts without even bothering to read them. But reading a  <br/>
person&#39;s post and thinking about it and carefully analyzing where I  <br/>
think they might be going wrong in their thinking? That IS respectful  <br/>
in a big way - that is respecting that the person came here to learn  <br/>
and wants to hear other opinions and have their own thinking challenged.<br/>

<br/>
I think by &quot;respect&quot; they want people to treat their posts as though  <br/>
the words all made as much sense as any writing ever could, and that  <br/>
their ideas are as good as any ideas ever had.<br/>
<br/>
I think they want people to be undiscriminating in their blanket  <br/>
approval and &quot;support.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If all ideas are equal, we don&#39;t need this list at all.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to dinner tonight, not to eat, but to advise someone on a  <br/>
project he&#39;s undertaking.  I invited another person known well to  <br/>
both of us.  I thought the three people would be a good think-tank.   <br/>
The advisee let me know he&#39;s bringing his wife.  I don&#39;t trust her.   <br/>
This is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have a house full of food.  I&#39;m going out to let him feel like he&#39;s  <br/>
compensating me for sharing my experience.  Now my decision is how  <br/>
far to advise.  How detailed?  How candid?  Do I give him $15 worth  <br/>
of advice and call it even?  Or do I give him limitless advice?  (I&#39;m  <br/>
going to play it by ear, and count on the mind-reading abilities of  <br/>
my co-advisor.  It might or might not be a good night for subtle  <br/>
communication between us.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never come to this list thinking &quot;I&#39;ll just share a little advice,&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;I&#39;ll throw a crumb and they&#39;ll feel like they really got some  <br/>
good information.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because the purpose of the list is to really see what helps and hurts  <br/>
unschooling, I LOVE the reports of successes or of confusing moments  <br/>
we can dissect and throw ideas toward.  I like it when a person  <br/>
blossoms out a little more than before--when they have an &quot;OH!   <br/>
That&#39;s how it works!&quot; moment.  I don&#39;t hold back ideas here.<br/>
<br/>
If the list existed so that I would feel like I had shared  <br/>
unschooling information with people in as minimal a way as necessary,  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t share so much, but we&#39;re amassing ideas and experiences  <br/>
and I love the gathering and sorting of any kind of data about the  <br/>
effect of unschooling on people&#39;s lives.<br/>
