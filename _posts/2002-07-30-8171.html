My six-year-old can&#39;t say &quot;L&#39;s&quot;. They turn into &quot;Y&#39;s&quot;. Can&#39;t say &quot;SH&quot; either <br/>
(becomes an &quot;S&quot;). A friend said that his tongue isn&#39;t long enough---and that <br/>
we should have it cut (hers was cut when she was little). Ain&#39;t going to <br/>
happen! I figured that since I&#39;d never heard an adult have trouble with L&#39;s <br/>
and SH&#39;s, that he could work it out when he was ready/wanted to. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s just now noticing that some people can&#39;t understand some of his words, <br/>
so he&#39;s begun asking about it. We use Dr. Suess&#39; &quot;Big L little l. Little Lola <br/>
Lopp. Left leg, lazy lion licks a lollipop&quot;. Any ideas to help with the L? Or <br/>
with the SH? <br/>
<br/>
Oddly, my 14-year-old turned his &quot;Y&#39;s&quot;into &quot;L&#39;s&quot;! He&#39;s fine now. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858193291">I read that in Korea lots of parents are having tongue-clip operations on <br/>
their young children so it will be easier for them to learn English, later, <br/>
if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
Holly couldn&#39;t do &quot;r&quot; and it got to where if someone misunderstood her she <br/>
would ask me whether some particular word had an &quot;r&quot; in it.<br/>
<br/>
When she said &quot;Kirby&quot; it sounded like &quot;Coby&quot; and some kids made fun of her <br/>
about it and she decided she wanted to get help.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends who are speech therapists (three different ones, as it <br/>
happened) and I arranged for her to talk to two of them, separately and <br/>
casually, when she wanted to.  <br/>
<br/>
They were both really sweet to her (and already knew her), and one played <br/>
games with her about &quot;Roger Rabbit&#39;s Buried Treasure&quot; and the other talked to <br/>
her about how the inside of her mouth felt and whether she could tell what <br/>
her tongue was doing, but in neither case did they make her feel wrong or <br/>
little or &quot;behind,&quot; which was really wonderful.  And she messed around with <br/>
the things they had discussed until she felt better about it, and more in <br/>
control, and whether they &quot;taught&quot; her how to pronounce it or whether she <br/>
grew older and heard it better and could control her mouth better, I don&#39;t <br/>
know, but at seven she had problems and at ten not a trace. <br/>

<br/>
We tried a few of the suggestions people mentioned earlier on the car<br/>
ride home today, and although not successful it was definitely amusing.<br/>
She succeeded in doing a pretty good imitation of a growling attack cat,<br/>
which may also be useful someday ;-)<br/>

I remember learning to roll my r&#39;s at 7, when I played Bridget O&#39;Flynn in<br/>
a play. It just seemed to click....<br/>
