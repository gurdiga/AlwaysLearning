<br/>
Ten Questions with Sandra Dodd<br/>
<br/>
I haven’t listened yet.  I’ll probably think “DOH!  Should’ve said….”<br/>
And I didn’t mean to tell the story about Marty.  It just spilled out.  I hope it doesn’t scare newer unschoolers. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has questions about anything I said, ask here and I’m glad to expand.  I think. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Pam made it a really fun process.  I was having a good time.<br/>
