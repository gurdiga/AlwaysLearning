<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858247634">&lt;&lt;What&#39;s a Christian Unschooler to do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I too am Christian and a radical unschooler.  I believe that Jesus is about<br/>
as liberal as you can get.  I&#39;m pretty sure he was into &quot;judge not&quot;, and<br/>
&quot;love one another&quot;.  I believe that the &quot;do nots&quot; of Christianity refer to<br/>
our policing our own behavior, not the behavior of others.  I feel it is my<br/>
job to try to make the world a warmer place for all people, not just the<br/>
ones who live like I do.  In all of the New Testament versions I have read,<br/>
I don&#39;t recall Jesus ever judging anyone except people who set themselves up<br/>
as &quot;religious&quot;, rather than loving, and he was definitely &quot;yoked unequally&quot;<br/>
when he dealt with humans.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I have stopped a friendship was when the persons behavior<br/>
impacted me and mine.  So I have friends who are gay, friends who are<br/>
Jewish, friends who are Pagan, friends who are divorced, friends who are<br/>
alcoholics....I even have a pen pal in prison.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very important to remember that &quot;we have all sinned and fallen<br/>
short of the glory of God.&quot;  I sin daily, not proud of it, but I do.  The<br/>
prostitute&#39;s sin is no worse than mine.  The murderer&#39;s sin is no worse than<br/>
mine.  I find it amusing that people tend to  find pardon for their own sins<br/>
and to vilify the sins that they aren&#39;t tempted to engage in.<br/>
