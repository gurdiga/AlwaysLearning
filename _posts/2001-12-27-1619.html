<div id="ygrps-yiv-153839985">Hello,<br/>
  If anyone is involved in h.s state sponsored programs, or is knowledgeable<br/>
of them, or has an opinion, please write to me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wew99@...">wew99@...</a>. Our<br/>
local districts haven&#39;t done anything to entice the homeschooling community,<br/>
but one is asking questions, and if they are going to implement a program, I<br/>
would like to offer them the best examples or ideas.<br/>
