<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731451445">Greetings, unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m here in Ohio at the 3rd annual Unschooler&#39;s Winter Waterpark Gathering having a great time! These conferences are so much fun, and I really enjoy learning, meeting new people, and making new connections. <br/>
It makes me even more excited for The Autodidact Symposium, which is one month away!! Time is quickly running out, so please go ahead and register for this new, exciting, and different unschooling conference experience!<br/>
<br/>
All the information is on the beautifully crafted website by fellow unschooler, Allen Ellis.<br/>
