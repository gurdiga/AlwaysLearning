Kirby&#39;s riddle:   What has half the world seen but no one will ever see <br/>
again?<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s guesses:   America?    [No.]   That place where the Presidents <br/>
statues are?   [No.]<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s Answer:   Yesterday.<br/>
I asked him why only half the world had seen it. He said the rest were <br/>
asleep!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
I found that when I went to put a note in Kirby&#39;s diary file that he weighed <br/>
50 lbs when we took him to urgent care on January 15, 1993.   The receipt says <br/>
&quot;cut cheek.&quot;   I don&#39;t remember a cut cheek, but I trust my own writing and <br/>
the &quot;50 lb&quot; note.<br/>
<br/>
But the entry next to where I needed to insert that was the riddle above.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe he was thinking about the rotation of the earth, and it being <br/>
dark on one side while the other side is light.   Maybe he had the idea that <br/>
some are asleep while others are awake, but not the whole 24-hour-clock thing.<br/>

August 16, 1991<br/>
<br/>
This week Kirby has been talking about “the West,” and cowboys, and the <br/>
desert, and the Old West a lot.   I tried again to discuss directions with him, <br/>
and I talked about history, with examples like when Kirby was little we didn&#39;t <br/>
have a patio, and now we do, and when Marty was little we didn&#39;t have a door to <br/>
the patio, and now we do, and when the new baby comes those things will have <br/>
been there his whole life.   He seemed to be getting the idea that the cowboys <br/>
used to be in this same place, but it was a long time ago, and that before <br/>
our house was built, it was the desert right where our house is, etc.<br/>
<br/>
His most interesting expression about the whole matter was “People who live <br/>
in the East never get to see the sun go down.”<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I took him and Marty “to see the sun set out West in the desert.”  <br/>
 We drove out Friday after work to the other side of Bernalillo, where Keith <br/>
knew of a dirt road that leads to Rio Rancho.   We drove off on an old <br/>
leftover bit of highway, and off on this dirt road.   (We took some pictures, so <br/>
that&#39;ll be in the kids&#39; books.)   It was a little muddy, and they found good <br/>
sticks (Yucca stalks) and we saw cactus and could find no animal tracks at all, <br/>
even though the road and a little wash had been very well cleared out by the rain <br/>
and were muddy (dry enough to walk on, mostly)..   We found a horse&#39;s jawbone <br/>
with teeth (which Keith scouted out and let Kirby “find” and pull out of the <br/>
mud) but Kirby wasn&#39;t as impressed by that as he should&#39;ve been.   The sun <br/>
went down, and we came back.   Kirby fell asleep on the way home and he was <br/>
satisfied (for a while) about the west and the desert.<br/>
