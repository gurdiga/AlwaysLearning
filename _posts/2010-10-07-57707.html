<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768523942">Thanks so much Sandra and others for using the *makeup* example as a discussion <br/>
point to explain how many attachments society has placed on this rather benign <br/>
form of creativity!  When both my daughters were in school, I *let* them wear as <br/>
much makeup as they wanted (they seemed to want to do this the most in Grade <br/>
one, to the horror of many parents and teachers).  I just didn&#39;t get what all <br/>
the fuss was about...they were playing, experimenting...it wasn&#39;t about wanting <br/>
to *grow up too fast* or anything, but we were somehow seen as *wild*.  Anyways, <br/>
they too have both become rather disinterested in the whole makeup business (by <br/>
the ripe old ages of 11 and 9)...probably because they too had their fill of it <br/>
already:)  <br/>
