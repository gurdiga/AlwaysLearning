<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015669852">Last night we met a mom and kid at a restaurant.  I&#39;d like to write more <br/>
about that fascinating encounter later, but Holly and I talked 25 minutes <br/>
with a mom and her 12 year old son.<br/>
<br/>
The boy likes structure.  His questions about the possibilities of <br/>
unschooling were nitpicky about what KINDS of movies would be good and what <br/>
KINDS of books and games.  He will be great at it.  But he would be unhappy <br/>
if he jumped from where he is to where I am.  It would be too much.  So I <br/>
said maybe his structure could look like having one day a week always library <br/>
day, and one day (or every five days) movie-rental day, and maybe he could <br/>
make a chart of historical periods and of geographical locations,  and not <br/>
when he had read or seen something about that.  That idea made him relax.<br/>
<br/>
If he abandoned it in a month, or never, it still would be a stepping stone <br/>
toward less &quot;requirement.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the chart idea.  Did you mean to say *not* when he had read or seen something about that or when he had read or seen something about that?<br/>
<br/>
I thought it would be good for me to have an idea, could be written down &lt;g&gt;, of what movies and tourist sites would correlate to different historical periods.  This would be part of my enrichment plan, not an education plan and only if we wanted to see the movie or go to the tourist site.<br/>
<br/>
What would you give him to do regarding science?<br/>

exposure.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;What would you give him to do regarding science?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t give anyone anything to do regarding science.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t use the term &quot;science&quot; with my kids, nor &quot;history&quot; nor &quot;geography.&quot;  <br/>
For good reasons, but Holly wants to go somewhere now and I hope others here <br/>
can explain that reason.<br/>
<br/>
But the boy I met last night was deep into school terminology.  He&#39;s already <br/>
ruined, as to &quot;subject areas.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think Pat was wondering what you gave that boy to do about science.  If I <br/>
was dealing with a boy like that, I might tell him to get a book of science <br/>
experiments geared to about his age and pick one a week to do.  He might do <br/>
it for a week or two.  &lt;g&gt;  Or I&#39;d tell him to go outside for a while every <br/>
day and make some observations about his world, maybe write it down or <br/>
something.  But I wouldn&#39;t tell my son to do those things.<br/>

I know.<br/>
I wanted Pat to think about what &quot;giving...to do about science&quot; would be.<br/>
<br/>
If he does for history and geography, science will be there.<br/>
