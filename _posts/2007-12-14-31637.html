<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960554525">Hello everyone.  I&#39;m very new to yahoo and don&#39;t know any etiquette, <br/>
so tell me if I miss something.  Here&#39;s my question.  Am I doing <br/>
what I&#39;m supposed to do?  Am I doing too much?  I want to do less, <br/>
but will I be neglectful?  Here&#39;s where I&#39;m at.  We homeschooled for <br/>
3 years using a boxed cirriculum.  This September I started trying <br/>
to create individual cirriculum for each child.  Then I realized <br/>
that I was looking to the child to see where to go and that giving a <br/>
cirriculum was just getting in their way.  Now we start our day with <br/>
chores then I give them 1 math page.  We were just playing shopping <br/>
games at the grocery store, cooking, sewing, that kind of thing and <br/>
calling it math.  But my husband is a little freaked that they <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;Do Math&quot;.  So now I give a worksheet a day to make him <br/>
happy.  But the kids say the pages are fun.  And I still do those <br/>
other things mentioned above.  Then I read to them, history, fairy <br/>
tales, whatever else they ask for, or I want them to hear.  During <br/>
this time we look at maps and globes or read something else that is <br/>
sparked.  Then I have each kid read something, whatever they want.  <br/>
I do this so I can help them with hard words while I&#39;m fully focused <br/>
on them and not in the middle of something else.  Then I have them <br/>
spend some time working on any projects they&#39;ve been wanting to do.  <br/>
Again, I set time aside to do only this with the kids.  Then we have <br/>
lunch, and I start cleaning, checking on the animals (we have a <br/>
small hobby farm), and the kids do whatever they want.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
if this is still too schooly.  Am I still swimming upstream?  Should <br/>
I just go about my day and stop whatever I&#39;m doing when they come to <br/>
me?  And whatever I don&#39;t get finished that day wasn&#39;t important <br/>
enough to worry about and it&#39;ll get done later?  It&#39;s nagging at me <br/>
that 1/2 the kids day is involved with, &quot;I have them...&quot;  Is that <br/>
the clue here?  Stop &quot;having them...&quot; and just enjoy &quot;...with <br/>
them.&quot;  I&#39;m eager to hear your experience and opinions.  -Jen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757141034">I&#39;m going to respond in a swirly but detailed way.<br/>
<br/>
The only real advice I have yahoo-wise is to break your writing into  <br/>
paragraphs.  More people will read it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Here&#39;s my question. Am I doing<br/>
what I&#39;m supposed to do? Am I doing too much? I want to do less,<br/>
but will I be neglectful? -=-<br/>
<br/>
The answer to all of that is &quot;It depends.  It depends what you want  <br/>
to do and why.  Neglectful is in the eye of the neglected.  If you  <br/>
got to the point you were doing too little for your children, then it  <br/>
might be worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s nagging at me  that 1/2 the kids day is involved with, &quot;I  <br/>
have them...&quot; Is that the clue here? Stop &quot;having them...&quot; and just  <br/>
enjoy &quot;...with them.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one big clue.<br/>
<br/>
Avoid the word &quot;just&quot; as in &quot;just enjoy.&quot;  There&#39;s more to  <br/>
unschooling than &quot;just&quot; anything.  Enjoy a busy, happy, amusing,  <br/>
joyful, musical, artsy life with them.  They&#39;ll start learning like  <br/>
crazy at some point a few months after you stop doing anything like  <br/>
school.    It won&#39;t look like school, though.  It will look like life  <br/>
on a good day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now we start our day with<br/>
<br/>
chores then I give them 1 math page. We were just playing shopping<br/>
games at the grocery store, cooking, sewing, that kind of thing and<br/>
calling it math.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I recommend dropping three things from that list:<br/>
<br/>
--giving them chores<br/>
<br/>
--math pages<br/>
<br/>
--calling anything &quot;math&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of reading, but it would help you, I&#39;m  pretty sure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know if this is still too schooly.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-Am I still swimming upstream?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trying to get to unschooling, you&#39;re on the whole wrong river.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Should  I just go about my day and stop whatever I&#39;m doing when  <br/>
they come to me? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not for the first few years.  When they&#39;re older you&#39;ll be able to do  <br/>
that, and occasionally, but mostly find things to do together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301962017">Wow. This week, when we went shopping, the clerk asked the kids if <br/>
there was no school today.  I told her we homeschool, and she didn&#39;t <br/>
understand.  She kept asking when do they start?  I feel just as <br/>
clueless right now as she seemed to me then.<br/>
<br/>
Please be patient with me.  I learn best if I can hear then repeat <br/>
back, then be redirected.  So thank you in advance.  <br/>
<br/>
I went to the sights you recommended, and will go back more.  It&#39;s a <br/>
lot to digest.  Yes, I want to be on the Unschooling River.  But <br/>
that school thinking is insidious!  I have been trying to unschool <br/>
using school parts.  Deep in my intuition, what I see as unschooling <br/>
is so beautiful.  Yet it&#39;s hard to let go.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you ever read the Earth&#39;s Children series by Jean Auel?  What I <br/>
picture for my family, when I think of unschooling, is living like <br/>
the people in pre-history.  That is, being together, doing the basic <br/>
housekeeping to survive together, sharing the joys of discovery, <br/>
making things together, rejoycing when someone excells at something <br/>
unexpected.  Living simply, loving, playing, and lots of good food.<br/>
<br/>
Is that it?  I think I can do that, I know I can.  But lots of <br/>
sloughing is necessary.:) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think what you&#39;re doing is seeing what you want to get into your  <br/>
kids and finding ways to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about helping the kids reach out to what they think is  <br/>
fun or intriguing.<br/>
<br/>
What will help you maybe is to *not* see what you direct toward them  <br/>
as learning, but what they reach out toward as learning.  <br/>
Unfortunately for new unschoolers, what kids often reach out toward  <br/>
doesn&#39;t resemble school at all ;-) If they&#39;re interested, reaching  <br/>
out to TV and video games is as learningful as reaching out to maps  <br/>
and globes.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is less about &quot;important information&quot; and lots more about  <br/>
figuring things out. By playing and exploring what interests them,  <br/>
they figure out who they are and they figure out how the world works.  <br/>
It&#39;s much more learningful to figure things out than it is to be  <br/>
handed the information. (Though of course when they ask questions,  <br/>
that&#39;s reaching out too, and we answer.)<br/>
<br/>
They even figure out math by using it as a tool to explore their  <br/>
interests. There&#39;s more meaningful math in video games and guides  <br/>
than in a 4th grade math book. Kids *use* math to extract meaning  <br/>
from what they&#39;re doing and in the process learn -- as a side effect  <br/>
-- how numbers work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should<br/>
&gt; I just go about my day and stop whatever I&#39;m doing when they come to<br/>
&gt; me? And whatever I don&#39;t get finished that day wasn&#39;t important<br/>
&gt; enough to worry about and it&#39;ll get done later?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can invite them along with your day. Ask if they&#39;d like to help.  <br/>
(And accept no as an answer.) You can be with them, close enough to  <br/>
know what is fascinating them and be able to pick up enough to help  <br/>
them explore and have conversations.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s nagging at me<br/>
&gt; that 1/2 the kids day is involved with, &quot;I have them...&quot; Is that<br/>
&gt; the clue here? Stop &quot;having them...&quot; and just enjoy &quot;...with<br/>
&gt; them.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a pretty good direction to head :-)<br/>

<br/>
*But* give your children the freedom to create the worlds *they*  <br/>
envision.<br/>

What if they want to bring Oreos and video games and metal music and  <br/>
black nail polish and South Park into their worlds?<br/>
