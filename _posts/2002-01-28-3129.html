<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038049171">TV is a very hot topic. Personally, I think that people who advocate for<br/>
unlimited TV happen to have families that are not adversely affected by<br/>
TV.  This is not true of all families.  I know from personal experience<br/>
that TV can adversely affect young children.  And yes, I&#39;ve done<br/>
extensive experiments with both unlimited, limited and no TV at all.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Put it on and let it stay on for a full year. No, two years. The reason he<br/>
&gt; cannot limit himself is because you&#39;re limiting him. There is no way for him<br/>
&gt; to find his natural patterns if you&#39;re there either demanding or cajoling<br/>
&gt; him away from the TV.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree with this.  This might be true for an adult or older child,<br/>
but I haven&#39;t seen it be true for a young child (under age 6).  From<br/>
what I&#39;ve seen, a young child is more likely to watch enough TV to make<br/>
himself restless and miserable and still never want to shut it off. <br/>
Yes, you need to have freedom to find your natural pattern, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be at age two!  I didn&#39;t watch any TV during my senior<br/>
year of high school because I was so busy.  It didn&#39;t make any<br/>
difference how much TV I had watched in earlier years. <br/>
<br/>
I know many people will strongly disagree with me.  That&#39;s fine.  But as<br/>
I said, I suspect that their children do not become apathetic, miserable<br/>
whiners after watching TV. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I didn&#39;t watch any TV during my senior<br/>
year of high school because I was so busy.  It didn&#39;t make any<br/>
difference how much TV I had watched in earlier years.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would it have mattered how much you had watched at two?<br/>
<br/>
My kids use TV as they use CD players and cassette players, the radio, record <br/>
player.  <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m assuming there aren&#39;t families here who limit the use of those things.)<br/>
<br/>
The TV might be on or not, and the kids are still playing with Lego, drawing, <br/>
making little figures, dressing dolls, playing with cats and dogs, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s background sometimes.  Sometimes it&#39;s big focus.  We watched a video <br/>
yesterday called Mr. Rice&#39;s Secret.  Three people watched it, one came in <br/>
near the end and asked lots of questions.  Nobody was told &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;quiet.&quot;  <br/>
It was a thing to pay attention to or not, but it DID draw attention, and it <br/>
drew attention because it was fascinating.  And we discussed predictions <br/>
about what would happen, and why, and what it would mean, and what was <br/>
realistic, and what&#39;s good about treasure hunt stories (a favorite of boys <br/>
for centuries), and then it was over and we scattered.  No reports (except <br/>
I&#39;m telling you guys, but only because it&#39;s illustrative of a point), no <br/>
responsibility, just the advantages of adding to each person&#39;s store of ideas <br/>
and experience.<br/>
<br/>
-=- But as<br/>
I said, I suspect that their children do not become apathetic, miserable<br/>
whiners after watching TV. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Eeek.<br/>
<br/>
No, mine never have.<br/>
<br/>
But if they were miserable and whining, I&#39;d not blame the TV, but would see <br/>
what would cheer them up and make them feel better.  Maybe the apathy and <br/>
misery came first and TV was soothing to them.<br/>
<br/>
And if the whining followed someone ELSE turning the TV off, rather than the <br/>
children themselves turning it off, I contend that the TV did not in any way <br/>
cause the whining.<br/>
<br/>
I would do more than whine if someone snatched a novel out of my lap and tore <br/>
the end off and destroyed it.  Yet I&#39;ve seen parents say &quot;TURN IT OFF RIGHT <br/>
NOW&quot; about tv or video games, with no thought that they might be doing that <br/>
very thing to children they claim to love!<br/>

<br/>
My kids don&#39;t become apathetic, miserable whiners after any activity. Ever. <br/>
It would never occur to me to use those terms to describe their behavior. <br/>
I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m perfect, BTW. Far from it. But I think that the words we <br/>
use to describe someone else, tend to reveal an lot about our own biases.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The <br/>
railroads of the world? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh!<br/>
There was one on PBS once about the last run of a rail line in India.  I <br/>
hadn&#39;t known it would be on, just turned the TV on and it grabbed me.  By the <br/>
end, others in my house had come by and gotten stuck too.  <br/>
<br/>
They were saying (and it&#39;s probably still true) that in India they made parts <br/>
for old 19th century steam engine trains, and they keep them running!  <br/>
Instead of getting newer trains, they just keep those in operation and once a <br/>
year they dress them up (looked like paintings of them dressing elephants up <br/>
for parades) with garlands of flowers and flags and paint and stuff.   It was <br/>
SO COOL!!!  But this one train and rail line, up a mountain to a particular <br/>
town, was being shut down, and so they documented it.  It was HUGELY <br/>
world-expanding and breathtaking.  It was not ugly. It didn&#39;t try to get me <br/>
to buy anything, but if anything made me aware that some things cannot in any <br/>
way be bought, and some parts of history MUST fade away, against the best <br/>
efforts of those who would maintain a train over 100 years old (I don&#39;t <br/>
remember how old that particular one was), and that to see video, with sound, <br/>
of the train with people on it, with the commentary of regular riders, of old <br/>
men who had worked their whole lives with/on it--THAT is something I would <br/>
not have had without TV.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134401513">I think if a parent is describing their child that way<br/>
and the child&#39;s behavior is negative, it has a lot<br/>
more to do with their relationship than the tv.  I say<br/>
this from experience.  I once decided we should pitch<br/>
the tv because the boys were behaving &#39;badly&#39; and I<br/>
needed something to blame.  The truth is, they were<br/>
not being bad, they were not whining or fighting<br/>
because of the tv.  They were doing it because of<br/>
things going on within our family.  They were not<br/>
bouncing off the walls because they watched 2 hours of<br/>
Magic School Bus and Digimon, they were doing it<br/>
because they needed to get some energy out.  <br/>
<br/>
Blaming the tv for &#39;bad&#39; behavior is the same as<br/>
blaming music for kids killing each other.  Or blaming<br/>
a book for causing a kid to become a satanist.  If<br/>
kids are doing negative things, there is a reason that<br/>
probably goes a lot deeper than too much tv.<br/>

I know many people will strongly disagree with me.  That&#39;s fine.  But as<br/>
I said, I suspect that their children do not become apathetic, miserable<br/>
whiners after watching TV.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My children have certainly done their share of miserable, apathetic whining.<br/>
When Brit was 4, I spent about six weeks convinced that I was up for Worst<br/>
Mommy of the Year because the child could not NOT burst into tears 430 times<br/>
per day, every day, with or without perceivable provocation.<br/>
<br/>
To the best of my fuzzy memory, she was not watching any more or less TV<br/>
during that time.<br/>
<br/>
Then my friend Paula sent me a book called &quot;Your Four Year Old&quot; and I read<br/>
it and a huge weight was lifted as I read that four year olds do this. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
It didn&#39;t let me off the hook for making sure that her environment was safe<br/>
and pleasant, but it let me be much calmer inside that it was not something<br/>
hideous I was doing to her, and that helped us both a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Michael-Anne turned 4 in October, and is occasionally weepy, which is<br/>
strange and bizarre behavior for her, and so I changed some things around<br/>
that I could change (she wants to stay home a lot, so Wally and I have made<br/>
it a priority to let her have that option as much as possible) and I&#39;m<br/>
paying attention to what she seems to need and we&#39;re waiting it out.<br/>
<br/>
If I eat carrots and then get in the car and have an accident, it does not<br/>
mean that carrots cause traffic accidents. If my child watches TV and is<br/>
whiney and miserable, the fault is not necessarily with the TV.<br/>
<br/>
And even if I was convinced it was the TV, I would not arbitrarily banish or<br/>
limit it. I would have absolutely no way of knowing how much TV that child<br/>
could handle on a given day, or when that ability changed to less or more. I<br/>
would try, however, to help them identify what they were feeling and see<br/>
what we could do to make it better. There are lots of options along &quot;make it<br/>
better&quot; other than &quot;get rid of the TV&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this whole argument of &quot;well, your children are just<br/>
different than mine&quot; is that it can be given to anything -- I know several<br/>
women who were convinced they didn&#39;t have enough milk to breastfeed: did<br/>
that make all of them, or most of them, or ANY of them right? Probably not.<br/>
But I got the, &quot;well, I&#39;m just different than you&quot; speech.<br/>
<br/>
Children (and people, and things living and not) are all different, but IMHO<br/>
that doesn&#39;t excuse parental interference in a child&#39;s search of balance.<br/>
Part of unschooling is trust, and that includes in our house trusting them<br/>
to find their own checks and balances, with what help we adults can provide<br/>
that doesn&#39;t interfere with or over-ride or ignore their own knowledge of<br/>
themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034804156">I don&#39;t care if anybody else watches tv. I don&#39;t care if they think we&#39;re <br/>
warped or evil or just stupid, either, because we DO watch it and love it.<br/>
<br/>
But - this is a discussion list and those who declare that they think it is <br/>
better for kids to not have any tv or to have strict limits placed on their <br/>
viewing time or that most of tv programming is ugly are going to have to then <br/>
bear with hearing why other people think they&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
And if people don&#39;t let their kids watch tv at home - I think it is fine to <br/>
choose to miss out on something - life is full of choices and things we have <br/>
to give up to do something else. I&#39;ve never walked into someone else&#39;s house, <br/>
with no tv, and sermonized at them about the dangers of not having a tv even <br/>
though I think they&#39;re missing out on really really worthwhile stuff and <br/>
limiting their options as to how to learn about lots of cool things <br/>
needlessly out of misplaced fear of tv.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve had people shame MY kids about watching tv (&quot;Oh, your parents let <br/>
you watch tv?&quot; Said in an appalled tone of voice. &quot;I&#39;m surprised about that. <br/>
I didn&#39;t think they were that kind of parents.&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve had PLENTY of people preach at me about the evils of tv - it happens <br/>
frequently in the attachment parenting/homeschooling kinds of circles I hang <br/>
out in. They always recommend books I&#39;ve already read - books I read years <br/>
ago and I&#39;ve tested out the claims of those books against the realities of <br/>
what I see with my own eyes and observe in my own family and other families <br/>
I&#39;m close enough to so that I can really know what is going on with those <br/>
kids. I just don&#39;t see all those harmful effects of tv watching that are <br/>
predicted. My kids have unlimited tv and they are voracious readers, <br/>
intelligent, with passonate interests in all kinds of subjects and busy with <br/>
many wonderful activities and have not ended up depressed couch potatoes with <br/>
short attention spans or an inability to focus. And my kids are not little <br/>
anymore - they are 17, 14, and 11, so I think we&#39;re okay and I&#39;m no longer <br/>
afraid to come right out and say, &quot;Yeah, we watch tv and we enjoy it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people have sig lines like this: &quot;tv, the drug of the nation... &quot; --- I <br/>
think it is apparent who is doing the &quot;judging&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
S&#39;okay - maybe your kids will grow up and go to college and spend every day <br/>
in the activity center watching soap operas and, yes, looking like they&#39;re <br/>
drugged. I can pretty much guarantee my kids will never do that - they&#39;ve <br/>
learned to be far more discriminating about what they watch.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m serious - I walk through the student activity center where there are <br/>
always b&#39;zillions of college students sitting, slack-jawed,  with their eyes <br/>
glued to the screen, watching soaps. But I suppose they don&#39;t actually &quot;have&quot; <br/>
a tv, anyway, technically, so they&#39;re probably just fine &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252021486">wow, you seem really passionate about this, and you also seem to have some really<br/>
bad experiences with non-tv-ers.  please just know that not all non-tv-ers feel<br/>

us judge you for those choices, and not all of us ban/shelter our children from<br/>
tv in other peoples homes (my son has seen tv in other people&#39;s homes, but he<br/>
finds it boring and has never asked to watch it at home).  the choice to toss the<br/>
tv is simply that -- a choice -- and one that we think is appropriate for our<br/>
home and family.  frankly, even if we wanted to watch tv, i don&#39;t even know when<br/>
we&#39;d find the time, as i can&#39;t ever imagine it winning a popularity contest over<br/>
reading or biking or crafting, etc.  btw, the &quot;drug of the nation&quot; is not my sig<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720237284">Just a final thought.  There seem to be a lot of defensive comments around this<br/>
issue.  I&#39;m curious as to why whenever I say simply that I don&#39;t eat meat -- a<br/>
single, simple sentence, lacking judgemental adjectives of any kind -- I find<br/>
myself offending people who a) assume that I&#39;m judging negatively their choice to<br/>
eat meat and b) feel the need to tell me in detail (and often a combative tone)<br/>
why they think that meat-eating is good (or at least not bad) for you.  I&#39;ve found<br/>
the same thing happens when I say that I don&#39;t drink (at least not much, at least<br/>
not anymore &lt;g&gt;) or that I don&#39;t smoke.  Now I see the same kind of defensive<br/>
responses regarding the justification of tv viewing, which some of us may find to<br/>
be, like drinking or meat-eating, not the healthiest choice available.  I think we<br/>
can learn from these posts to communicate less defensively.  In fact, I wonder if<br/>
the judgemental adjective &quot;ugly&quot; had not been used, if this whole flood of<br/>
pro-tv-justification would have been avoided?  I certainly hope so...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d like to repeat someone else&#39;s comment regarding the AAP -- a pretty<br/>
conservative group -- which can provide references and resources regarding the<br/>
negative effects of TV viewing on little minds.  I believe they also suggest that<br/>
TV can be too stimulating or distracting for &quot;spirited&quot; kids.  Therefore, given<br/>
that advice, please don&#39;t treat those of us who avoid the tube as luddites who are<br/>
trying to shelter our kids from &quot;beautiful&quot; entertainment.  We&#39;ve just found<br/>
better things to do -- &quot;better&quot; in terms of OUR families -- just our families --<br/>
not necessariliy YOUR families.  So let&#39;s not be like the toxic MIL mentioned<br/>
throughout these posts.  Let&#39;s respect each others&#39; choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073936857">----------<br/>
Just a final thought.  There seem to be a lot of defensive comments around<br/>
this<br/>
issue.  I&#39;m curious as to why whenever I say simply that I don&#39;t eat meat --<br/>
a<br/>
single, simple sentence, lacking judgemental adjectives of any kind -- I<br/>
find<br/>
myself offending people who a) assume that I&#39;m judging negatively their<br/>
choice to<br/>
eat meat and b) feel the need to tell me in detail (and often a combative<br/>
tone)<br/>
why they think that meat-eating is good (or at least not bad) for you.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
If you came to my house and I offered you a ham sandwich and you told me,<br/>
&quot;Oh, no thanks, I don&#39;t eat meat&quot; you would not find me defensive. I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t grill you because frankly, I don&#39;t care, and I&#39;d offer you<br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
If you came to my house and I offered you a ham sandwich and you told me,<br/>
&quot;Oh, no thanks, I don&#39;t eat meat. I love animals.&quot; I would be mildly<br/>
irritated. In my younger days, I might have said, &quot;Me too, they&#39;re mighty<br/>
tasty.&quot; &lt;g&gt; But these days, I refrain from being too annoying to guests,<br/>
even if they annoy me first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
I&#39;ve found<br/>
the same thing happens when I say that I don&#39;t drink (at least not much, at<br/>
least<br/>
not anymore &lt;g&gt;) or that I don&#39;t smoke.<br/>
 Now I see the same kind of defensive<br/>
responses regarding the justification of tv viewing, which some of us may<br/>
find to<br/>
be, like drinking or meat-eating, not the healthiest choice available.  I<br/>
think we<br/>
can learn from these posts to communicate less defensively.  In fact, I<br/>
wonder if<br/>
the judgemental adjective &quot;ugly&quot; had not been used, if this whole flood of<br/>
pro-tv-justification would have been avoided?  I certainly hope so...<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a context issue here. The first poster on this thread wrote<br/>
(paraphrasing) that she wanted to talk about TV and limiting or not and<br/>
unschooling and that her son would watch TV all the time, never quitting,<br/>
unless she controlled it.<br/>
<br/>
When people argue with that, it&#39;s not the same thing as calmly declining a<br/>
ham sandwich in my kitchen. It&#39;s asking for opinion, and opinion gets<br/>
debated. This is not an unhealthy dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
Also, I&#39;d like to repeat someone else&#39;s comment regarding the AAP -- a<br/>
pretty<br/>
conservative group -- which can provide references and resources regarding<br/>
the<br/>
negative effects of TV viewing on little minds.  I believe they also suggest<br/>
that<br/>
TV can be too stimulating or distracting for &quot;spirited&quot; kids.  Therefore,<br/>
given<br/>
that advice, please don&#39;t treat those of us who avoid the tube as luddites<br/>
who are<br/>
trying to shelter our kids from &quot;beautiful&quot; entertainment.  We&#39;ve just found<br/>
better things to do -- &quot;better&quot; in terms of OUR families -- just our<br/>
families --<br/>
not necessariliy YOUR families.  So let&#39;s not be like the toxic MIL<br/>
mentioned<br/>
throughout these posts.  Let&#39;s respect each others&#39; choices.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I have no power to make you change your mind or lifestyle. I can give you my<br/>
opinion and that&#39;s it. I promise I will respect your choices by NOT mailing<br/>
you a television. Other than that, this is a discussion list and discussions<br/>
sometimes involve disagreement. It is not personal -- most of the time I&#39;m<br/>
hopelessly lost on who-posted-what by the time I&#39;m four posts in.<br/>
<br/>
Respect doesn&#39;t mean we all have to just agree to disagree the second a<br/>
controversial topic comes up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858216085">True, tho I don&#39;t remember saying that I didn&#39;t allow my child to do<br/>
something.  We don&#39;t watch TV, as a family, and that&#39;s our family&#39;s choice.<br/>
However, if my son asked to watch TV (he&#39;s seen it at others&#39; homes but has<br/>
never shown interest or asked for it at home), I would neither encourage nor<br/>
discourage him -- but I would watch with him, and we would discuss what we<br/>
were watching.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  My kids have unlimited tv and they are voracious readers, <br/>
intelligent, with passonate interests in all kinds of subjects and busy with <br/>
many wonderful activities and have not ended up depressed couch potatoes with <br/>
short attention spans or an inability to focus. And my kids are not little <br/>
anymore - they are 17, 14, and 11 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know Pam&#39;s kids.  I&#39;ve known them for years.  And what she says is true. <br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m at their house, there&#39;s not much TV watching going on, until maybe <br/>
after a long day of running around doing tons-of-fun things some flop <br/>
exhausted in front of (usually) a musical.    And days when they don&#39;t have <br/>
company from out of town there&#39;s probably more TV.<br/>
<br/>
Same here, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment there is one TV on.  Holly is playing Harvest Moon on a Super <br/>
Nintendo.  She&#39;s in the last season of a game she has purposely &quot;played <br/>
wrong,&quot; to see what will happen if you leave your dog at someone else&#39;s <br/>
house, give gifts to characters other than your wife, give your wife weeds <br/>
instead of eggs, etc.  She&#39;s learning.  It&#39;s not a simple matter of asking <br/>
someone what will happen.  She&#39;s invested hours in playing a game wrong.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s fascinating, and more educational than playing it right (whch she <br/>
and the boys have all done already, more than once).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370811217">Perhaps the analogy doesn&#39;t hold for you.  For me, I find anything that<br/>
promotes passive, sedentary behavior a health risk, especially considering the<br/>
amount of heart disease in the U.S. and the geometric increase of morbid<br/>
obesity in children over the past couple of decades.  We have a great amount<br/>
of heart disease in our family, and therefore, for us, we do perceive the<br/>
choice to avoid television a health issue.  Again, this is a personal issue.<br/>
For some people drinking does not lead to alcoholism, and for some people<br/>
tv-viewing doesn&#39;t lead to less than optimal physical health, and for some,<br/>
smoking is not an addictive habit, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we as<br/>
individuals and families shouldn&#39;t do what we feel is best for the health of<br/>
our families.  If that includes avoiding the TV, something that would be<br/>
approved of by the majority of pediatricians (and most alternative healers,<br/>
I&#39;d think), why is that so surprising to some of us?<br/>

good topic for unschoolers to discuss. All 150 people on the list seem to<br/>

Oh, and I do apologize for all those words like &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;.<br/>
They&#39;ll probably soon be banned from the English language and replaced by<br/>
&quot;visually challenged&quot; and &quot;perceptorily advantaged&quot;. Good Russian doesn&#39;t<br/>
have that problem yet.<br/>
<br/>
I and other non-tv-ers might have been too judgmental, but pro-tv-ers,<br/>
mainly Sandra, made a lot more ad hominem attacks (also known as personal<br/>
insults). Whoever wants to, can go through those posts and count them. I<br/>
have not insulted anyone&#39;s logic a single time (altho I did wonder about<br/>
it a little).<br/>
<br/>
No hard feelings, though. Really. Just mild sadness.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Here&#39;s the link to the AAP statements regarding Children, Adolescents,<br/>

<br/>
Scanning the several pages, i found this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Discourage television viewing for children younger than 2 years, and <br/>
encourage more interactive activities that will promote proper brain <br/>
development, such as talking, playing, singing, and reading together.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is not a person here who has not said that give a choice kids will want <br/>
to be doing something up and out, interacting with people, riding ponies, <br/>
going somewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
That statement does not say forbid.  It says find something better.<br/>

Do you require your children to be in motion all the time so as not to<br/>
promote passive, sedentary behavior?<br/>
<br/>
Television does not necessarily lead to fat unhealthy kids. Mine, for<br/>
example, are neither.<br/>

Perhaps the analogy doesn&#39;t hold for you.  For me, I find anything that<br/>
promotes passive, sedentary behavior a health risk<br/>

But by sharing what you found of value in it, you did justify it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Okay - I lied about the dark chocolate part.  I will never understand <br/>

I don&#39;t mind, though, because then I have someone to give milk chocolate away <br/>

<br/>
I find the juxtaposition of unschooling with the anti-TV article amusing:<br/>
the arguments against TV are all based on school performance.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
read the vegan stuff, since I&#39;d just fed my kids turkey dogs and was eating<br/>
a chicken sandwich; that much irony gives me tummyache.<br/>

Uh oh, Sandra is going to discipline you. You&#39;re not supposed to just<br/>
give a link, you&#39;re supposed to give a full quote. (Who made up that rule,<br/>
by the way? I never heard of it on other lists.)<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t presented as a rule, it was presented as a request for a full<br/>
quote.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
So, I&#39;m quietly disappearing. Too many arbitrary rules on this list, for<br/>
my taste; and one person (Sandra) seems to decide which topics are fit<br/>
for discussion. She says transferring values to your children is not a<br/>
good topic for unschoolers to discuss. All 150 people on the list seem to<br/>
agree. Who am I to argue?<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Er, you&#39;ll have to make up your mind: if Sandra decides which topics are fit<br/>
for discussion, it doesn&#39;t matter whether all 150 people on the list agree.<br/>
Since she doesn&#39;t decide this (and as a moderator of the list I&#39;d have been<br/>
informed if she had decided it, so I could start deleting posts that were<br/>
off-topic) your supposition is inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
__________<br/>
I and other non-tv-ers might have been too judgmental, but pro-tv-ers,<br/>
mainly Sandra, made a lot more ad hominem attacks (also known as personal<br/>
insults). Whoever wants to, can go through those posts and count them. I<br/>
have not insulted anyone&#39;s logic a single time (altho I did wonder about<br/>
it a little).<br/>
__________<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see Sandra call anyone a big boogerhead, and since it IS part of my<br/>
job to notice that, I hope someone will point to the post where she did it.<br/>
<br/>
Arguing that you&#39;re being illogical in an example or a post doesn&#39;t equal an<br/>
insult, it equals a debate, a discussion, an exchange of views. It&#39;s very<br/>
easy to avoid having your feelings hurt in debate: don&#39;t debate. It takes<br/>
two at least, so if you shrug, say &quot;I don&#39;t want to debate&quot; and then don&#39;t,<br/>
and go comfortably on believing what you believe, it&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I do have to say that starting to accuse specific people of attacking<br/>
IS an attack, and attacks aren&#39;t tolerated on this list. So please don&#39;t.<br/>
Argument of ideas is fine, saying that Sandra or anyone else is personally<br/>
insulting you, or making rules for the list that she&#39;s not, or dragging 150<br/>
unwilling pawns with her, is not playing nice.<br/>
<br/>
If you replace Sandra&#39;s name with your own name in the parts you wrote<br/>
above, and imagine someone else had sent it out publicly with your name<br/>
instead of hers throughout, you&#39;ll understand clearly what I mean by<br/>
attacking people. Not acceptable.<br/>
