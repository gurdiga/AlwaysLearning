<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291928126">HUmmmmm,  we subscribe to &quot;Asahi Shinbum&quot; one of the 2 largest<br/>
national newspaper here in Japan.  I do not read it every day but<br/>
husband does.  I asked him about the &quot;Mainichi&quot; article and hubby<br/>
said he did not see any of the kind.<br/>
<br/>
Usually when there is any news around the subject of<br/>
Homeschooling, hubby cuts it out and gives me it...If I hear/read<br/>
some good new fm here I will let you know.<br/>
love and peace</div>
