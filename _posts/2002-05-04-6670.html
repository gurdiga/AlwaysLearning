<div id="ygrps-yiv-614434">We found out this morning about a library book sale in a town about forty<br/>
miles from us, so we rounded up anyone who wanted to go and off we went. <br/>
<br/>
There was a mom there, toting around a really unhappy kid who kept saying<br/>
&quot;momma, momma&quot;  and crying and no one there said anything to her about<br/>
it. (to everyone else, but not to her ) but when Dylan was over looking<br/>
at the science fiction stuff, a woman from the sale came up and *told* on<br/>
him.  &quot;You&#39;re little girl is looking at the science fiction table...&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s my son and it&#39;s ok if he looks. <br/>
When I sneaked over and told Dylan, he said she had tried to direct him<br/>
to the kids table,  and that he had told her he was a boy.   <br/>
So, the old biddy just came to me to find out for sure if this kid was a<br/>
boy.  <br/>
I&#39;m a horrible person so when she took our money and said have a nice<br/>
day, honey, I said &quot;Thank you sir.&quot;  and Dylan laughed all the way back<br/>
to the car.<br/>
Next stop, the second hand store where we found a very cool old puzzle,<br/>
the New York times front page story of Charles Lindbergh&#39;s Flight across<br/>
the Atlantic.  It had never been opened, it&#39;s maybe thirty years old...<br/>
How do you not open a puzzle?    Dylan and his dad just started it and<br/>
are reading little snippets of the story.  They&#39;re being funny and<br/>
reading dramatically and connecting the story in creative ways <br/>
&quot;Lindbergh does it!  Ate only one and a half of his five<br/>
sandwiches...French carry him off field.... &quot;    <br/>
Dylan&#39;s Grandfather was ten (about Dylan&#39;s age ) when Lindbergh made his<br/>
historic flight, and collected a few of the little things people were<br/>
selling and giving away and saved some newspaper stories, so his Grandma<br/>
said she&#39;d bring them down tomorrow if we like and look through them.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t realize the seventy fifth anniversary of his flight is coming up<br/>
this month until the puzzle men read the date of the newspaper story... <br/>
I was going somewhere else here but now I&#39;m told &quot;Tarantula&quot; is about to<br/>
start, so I&#39;m off to make popcorn. <br/>
Anyone know of a Lindbergh movie?  About the flight, not the kidnapping. <br/>
<br/>

Also, I&#39;m curious...  why did you title your subject &quot;Good Friday&quot;?  I&#39;m<br/>

Sunday.  Just a coincidence?<br/>

here and there and I hadn&#39;t heard the news.   Thank you.<br/>

thinking.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-667082127">Deb, it&#39;s time you cut that boy&#39;s hair and started<br/>
censoring his reading material!  You don&#39;t want him to<br/>
grow up to be &quot;different&quot;, do you? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, girl, feel free to share stories like this on<br/>
MOntanaunschoolers, too...I&#39;m trying to inspire people<br/>
to share day-to-day life &quot;learning&quot;, but no one&#39;s<br/>
taken the bait yet :)<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear you had such a good day!  Did it snow on<br/>
you all day, like it did here?<br/>
