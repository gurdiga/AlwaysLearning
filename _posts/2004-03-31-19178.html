<div id="ygrps-yiv-550099322">Hi folks!<br/>
I just wanted to let you know that any registrations received for the <br/>
conference by midnight (your time) on Friday, May 2, will receive a fun free gift at <br/>
check-in at the conference. You can either pay by Paypal or by check, but I <br/>
need to receive your form by then.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please make sure that if you want to attend the Whale Watch on Sunday <br/>
afternoon of the conference, that you register as soon as possible. The boat <br/>
can hold 150 people, including infants. I&#39;ve reserved 100 spots, so far (I can <br/>
increase that to the full 150 if I need to), but we&#39;ve already sold 53 spots! <br/>
If you want to go, please register very soon. <br/>
<br/>
We already have LOTS of registrations, from people all over the country. This <br/>
is going to be a great conference, and I hope to meet you all there! Please <br/>
feel free to forward this to anyone you think will be interested.<br/>
<br/>
