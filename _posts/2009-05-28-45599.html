<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378000502">A high schooled kid has written to me for help with persuading a  <br/>
parent to let him be unschooled.  I know there have been such  <br/>
discussions in the past but I failed to find them.  I found a one- <br/>
response thing at unschooling.info, but it seems there have been two  <br/>
or three lengthy ones in the past few years.   Does anyone remember or  <br/>
have time to dig?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

trying to remember the names but couldn&#39;t.  It was for sure on<br/>

some of them.<br/>

I&#39;m going to look again, perhaps I&#39;ll look under my own name for things<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember them too but I bet the threads were on the Unschooling.com  <br/>
boards. I recall specifically creating the folder for teens/kids to  <br/>
ask questions about unschooling because of those, but they didn&#39;t get  <br/>
the questions the old ones did.<br/>
<br/>
Does the Wayback machine have archives of Unschooling.com?<br/>

I vaguely remember it being the &quot;To Do or Not To Do&quot;, but I can&#39;t access<br/>
it to check.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes it does, but not of everything and it&#39;s extremely time consuming and<br/>
cumbersome to navigate.  It has new stuff too, which is annoying a<br/>
weird.<br/>
<br/>
I remember some of those on the unschooling dot com forums too, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t participate in much of those since I was newer and still getting<br/>
it myself back in those days!  I do remember some on the unschooling dot<br/>
info for absolute certain!</div>

on dot com. (Of course there may be more than one bunch.)<br/>
<br/>
I have a hunch they are in the &quot;where do I post this&quot; board and I&#39;ll check <br/>
although Jenny may be way ahead of me by now.<br/>

It was good to read this thread, though very sad for the young person  to <br/>
have parents so resolutely against unschooling.  You&#39;d think that they&#39;d  <br/>
realize a fourteen-year-old who could express themselves so articulately and  <br/>
thoughtfully was sure to be an autodidact already, and likely to thrive when  <br/>
allowed to pursue their own interests!  <br/>
