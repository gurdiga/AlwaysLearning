<div id="ygrps-yiv-140615402">From someone who doesn&#39;t have end product children/almost adults I can say <br/>
that this unschooling life has given my two, my 9 and 6 year old, some of <br/>
the most amazing abilities. Linnaea just asked me for some pomegranate <br/>
seeds, but she couldn&#39;t remember what they were. So, she asked me for the <br/>
fruit seeds, y&#39;know, the ones the woman ate when she shouldn&#39;t and she only <br/>
had 6. And I didn&#39;t get it for a few minutes, but she took me patiently to <br/>
the fridge and we looked until it clicked, the lovely fruit seeds, the many <br/>
fruit seeds, the 6 that Persephone ate and shouldn&#39;t have, so she had to <br/>
swap between Hades and Mt. Olympus and we have seasons.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Simon wanted to go out to walk the dog. He wanted to go out to <br/>
walk the dog because he has been playing Pokemon Fire Red lately and he had <br/>
some plans for catching Pokemon down by a pond that I walk past when I walk <br/>
the dog. He was pretty sure there would be some Lotads down that way, and he <br/>
needed to add them to his pokemon collection. Simon doesn&#39;t go on walks <br/>
easily. But, because he wanted to, because it was his choice, he went on <br/>
this walk well. Actually, he didn&#39;t. Linnaea irritated him before we left, <br/>
so he didn&#39;t go when Linnaea and David left. He and I stayed while he worked <br/>
through whatever he needed to work through and we left about 5 minutes <br/>
behind them. On the walk we saw a Fallow deer, which became a Stantler, and <br/>
an old horse, a Rapidash, and lots of birds, Pidgeots and Taillows and <br/>
Wingulls and Spearows, and then there were the things that were there in his <br/>
and Linnaea&#39;s shared imaginings. Linnaea found a Nidoran that loved her soon <br/>
after the capture. And there was a Rattatta site in the hay bales.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Linnaea composed songs. She had me transcribe her words as she <br/>
sang them. She found a bunch of our instruments and assigned them to David <br/>
and me (Simon played electric guitar briefly, but bowed out early) and she <br/>
wrote out the notation, her own notation, for each instrument so that we <br/>
would know what to play and when. And we sang and played the two songs she <br/>
wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Late at night, after David has gone to bed, they cook these amazing <br/>
creations. Linnaea made bread rolls the other night of flour and water and <br/>
coke and knew to add baking soda as a rising agent. We baked them and they <br/>
weren&#39;t bad at all. Simon has been making egg in the hole concoctions. <br/>
Things with cheese and home beaten applesauce and a pinch of salt and a <br/>
smidgen of pepper and they are tasty and playful in a way that I have never <br/>
been with cooking.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who they would be without unschooling. But the friends they <br/>
have who are in school or who are schooled are harder and sadder and need <br/>
far more support being who they want to be than either of my two radically <br/>
unschooled beings do. And I don&#39;t know who or what they will be when they <br/>
are grown up/almost adults, but I can&#39;t believe that they will be anything <br/>
but exactly who they are, and I hope that they can carry with them the power <br/>
and happiness that they possess right now.<br/>

&gt; Thanks.  I&#39;ll share this with them.  They really  have been poster<br/>
&gt; children for another way of being.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Marty went to a school dance last night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kirby&#39;s about to start training on a job that said you have to have a<br/>
&gt; high school diploma or a GED; he has neither.  He&#39;s the only one who<br/>
&gt; passed all the &quot;tests&quot; (informal)  and interviews to do the World of<br/>
&gt; Warcraft customer support.  The rest of them who applied when he did<br/>
&gt; will be doing support for other companies than Blizzard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Holly was participating in a weekly discussion of medieval virtues,<br/>
&gt; and though she would only say two or three things in a two hour<br/>
&gt; session, her comments were better than most of those others present.<br/>
&gt; When the young (22 year old) wife of one of the participants wanted<br/>
&gt; to start coming, I was talking about it with one of my best regulars<br/>
&gt; and said &quot;I&#39;d like to say she&#39;s too young or new to the group, but<br/>
&gt; Holly&#39;s there.&quot;  He said &quot;Yeah, but Holly&#39;s like 30.&quot;  (She&#39;s 15.  He<br/>
&gt; knows.  He meant to say she&#39;s as mature in that type of discussion as<br/>
&gt; if she were 30, which is too flattering, but still...  she does<br/>
&gt; understand the subject matter better than the 22 year old graduate<br/>
&gt; student does sometimes.)  But now Holly has a Wednesday night<br/>
&gt; babysitting job, so she&#39;s unable to come to the discussions, which is<br/>
&gt; fine because she was going to quit when Lost starts back up in a<br/>
&gt; couple of weeks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These kids are just not &quot;at their spot&quot; on the conveyor belt.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re &quot;ahead&quot; some and &quot;behind&quot; some and &quot;beyond&quot; some and<br/>
&gt; &quot;oblivious&quot; some (to traditions concerning school dances, for<br/>
&gt; instance &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But in every case, they have had the information they&#39;ve requested or<br/>
&gt; that came up naturally in the course of their wanting to know things,<br/>
&gt; or coming across a new activity or topic, or choosing to pursue<br/>
&gt; something or other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t invite Holly to that philosophy discussion.  We meet in a<br/>
&gt; restaurant that&#39;s walking distance, and one night she was hungry and<br/>
&gt; wanted to go eat and then go home.  She stayed.  She came back.   She<br/>
&gt; was curious about what we were doing, and she likes some of the<br/>
&gt; people there.  Marty goes now too.  Marty&#39;s friend Brett started<br/>
&gt; going.  He first planned to come for the first hour and then go to<br/>
&gt; our house for Kirby&#39;s D&D game.  As it turned out, he goes to the D&D<br/>
&gt; game late.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Had I suggested to any of these kids that they should attend a<br/>
&gt; philosophy discussion that I run, or MADE them go, their being there<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be nearly the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve rambled away from the original question, but I&#39;m still in the<br/>
&gt; realm of the quality and value of information that is shared when<br/>
&gt; the listener is interested or  needs to know, and when the listener<br/>
&gt; is free to stay or go, free to change the subject or to ask about<br/>
&gt; something altogether different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s cool to say that all my kids have jobs.  Except for campus work-<br/>
&gt; study jobs (filing cards for the bursar, and working in the<br/>
&gt; cafeteria) I didn&#39;t have a job until I was 20 years old.   Kirby has<br/>
&gt; worked since he was 14, and Marty since he was 15.  Holly&#39;s 15 and<br/>
&gt; got a very good babysitting job, regular through May.  (Whether it<br/>
&gt; will continue after that isn&#39;t important to her.)  People are happy<br/>
&gt; with their work and their presence.   We didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them get jobs<br/>
&gt; or even suggest it, in any of those cases.  (I did let Holly know<br/>
&gt; about the babysitting job, but I didn&#39;t say &quot;Look for a babysitting<br/>
&gt; job.&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I&#39;m ramblng, but there are some more ideas for the collection.<br/>
