<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016728497">Hi Heather;<br/>
    I just had to speak up here and tell you how lucky you are. Your<br/>
mother&#39;s concerns are only grounded in the fact that, in some states (SC is<br/>
one. I live here.) they do take your kids if they don&#39;t like how you are<br/>
schooling them. I think I will move to Arizona. I used to live in Tuscon<br/>
(lifetimes ago). I could get used to the lack of humidity.<br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So the conversation continues... about &quot;don&#39;t we have<br/>
&gt; to do testing?&quot; NO.  &quot;doesn&#39;t the state require every<br/>
&gt; kid to be in school?&quot;  YES.  &quot;So if Child Protective<br/>
&gt; Services investigates and finds out your kids are just<br/>
&gt; playing games and not doing school...?&quot;  MOM!  CPS is<br/>
&gt; not going to take my kids away just to put them in<br/>
&gt; school!   I couldn&#39;t believe she said that!<br/>
&gt; I still can&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, rant over...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; peace,<br/>

&gt; coming to visit!<br/>
