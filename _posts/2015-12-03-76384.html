<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728917821">-=-somehow I always turn it into a power struggle. I have been trying to let go of control the best way I know how, but she feels my lack of confidence. I know there is a balance, but I can&#39;t seem to find it. Any chance she has to stay up late, she fights sleep. -=-<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m afraid that I have made this such a power struggle for both of us that…-=-<br/>
<br/>
I’m going to show you an underlying problem.  Others will probably write about sleep. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I’m going to point out that in so short a piece of writing, you chose to use these phrases:<br/>
<br/>
power struggle<br/>
control<br/>
fights<br/>
power struggle (again)<br/>
<br/>
Who can sleep with all that fighting!?<br/>
<br/>
And even if it’s “just words,” those words came out of you.  Think of this:  either you think that and are unaware that you’re thinking that way, or you consciously chose those words.<br/>
<br/>
IF you chose those words on purpose, you should relax.<br/>
If you’re reciting phrases you’ve picked up from other people, you should try to look at your words before you post, or speak.  Then try to listen to your thoughts as they’re forming, and see wheher you’re casting your relationship with your child as “struggle,” or her relationship with her own biology as “fighting.”<br/>
<br/>
Two things to read, about negative words that lead away from peace, and stories of sleep and sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote -=-I have been implementing more peaceful practices into our home. Peace and respect were always an underlying part of our lives-=-<br/>
This might help a lot:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-139017812"><p dir="ltr">You say you want sleep to be on her terms, but I&#39;m not reading that in your writing. I&#39;m reading &quot;I have an agenda for her sleeping that I wish for her to choose.&quot; </p>
<p dir="ltr">I found ONE, and ONLY ONE, thing that worked in our family. I went to bed with my kids. Still do, although they sleep in a different room. I am happy to go to bed at 830 or 9 (or whenever we are tired together). If I weren&#39;t, I would probably get a book light, or some podcasts or audio books, and read or listen once the kids were asleep. At this point, they like to go to bed after I do, so I just bring whatever I want to do into the bed-books, homework, etc. </p>
<p dir="ltr">As long as you are lying there waiting to leave, she is going to work to hold you there. Once you are there fully, intentionally, without an agenda, she will sleep. Humans need to feel safe and secure to sleep well. For little ones, this means Mama is near. </p>

<div>
<div>-=-&nbsp; I do the bath, story, kisses and hugs routine, and somehow I 
always turn it into a power struggle. -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-=- Any chance she has to stay up late, she fights sleep.&nbsp; I have laid 
in her bed with her, but she gets up and again, fights it.-=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Keep the parts that are working and ditch the stuff that causes 
conflict.&nbsp; If she enjoys that routine then that&#39;s great but it sounds like 
it&#39;s set up to suit you.&nbsp; It sounds like if she were allowed to establish 
her own ideal bedtime routine this would not be it.&nbsp; Help her figure out 
what &quot;it&quot; is.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When my&nbsp;daughter (13)&nbsp;was&nbsp;little,&nbsp;bath time was a long, 
extended play time in the tub.&nbsp; We were fortunate to have a large, corner 
bath tub at that time and often&nbsp;she, her little brother and I would take 
long baths together!&nbsp; I was always searching for fun new bath tub 
ideas.&nbsp; Usually around mid afternoon I would start to drag &amp; suggest a 
bath - which was generally accepted eagerly.&nbsp; I have the sweetest, most 
cherished memories from that time.&nbsp; Jade and I started&nbsp;soaking 
together&nbsp;before Ben was even born.&nbsp; I remember when I was pregnant 
with him &amp; my belly got so big that it poked out&nbsp;above the water &amp; 
Jade would rest her head on it.&nbsp; &lt;3</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My daughter also never liked having a story read to her.&nbsp; For a long 
time I felt like a failure in that area because there is so much pressure to 
read to your kids but mine hated sitting still &amp; being read to!&nbsp; In the 
end it didn&#39;t matter - they enjoy stories and reading, under their own 
terms.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She would have been a big fan of the hugs and kisses though!&nbsp; And 
tickles, cuddles.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that age we would&nbsp;have all 3 snuggled into 
the king size bed, a kid on each side, and done&nbsp;huggy, kissy, cuddle time 
while a favorite movie played.&nbsp; I may have stayed until they fell asleep or 
crept out for awhile once they were all settled, but I would have gotten up for 
awhile to spend some time with my husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, by the time 
my&nbsp;husband and I were ready for bed they&#39;d be asleep.&nbsp; We&#39;d&nbsp;move 
them into their own, make shift beds in our room and watched a show of our own 
for awhile before falling asleep.&nbsp; Bed time was based on signs of readiness 
from the kids, not from the clock.&nbsp; Usually they&#39;d want to go get settled 
in because it was nice and they enjoyed it.&nbsp; If one or both wanted to stay 
up with us that was fine.&nbsp; If one was still up (rare) when we came to bed 
that one would watch TV with us for awhile before falling asleep.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is what worked for us.&nbsp; There are endless possible bed time 
routines, none of them right or wrong except for how they feel to the person 
approaching sleep.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If there has been control in this area then there will be push back against 
that for awhile.&nbsp; Try relaxing naturally and gradually into a new bedtime 
routine that is satisfying to her but understand that for awhile she will have a 
natural desire to explore that which was previously forbidden.</div>
