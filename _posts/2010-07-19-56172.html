<div id="ygrps-yiv-602392256">That&#39;s 100% precious. Just the kind of thing I&#39;ve experiencing from<br/>
Karl. He has such great little thoughtful moments. I like taking note<br/>
of them and storing them up for good memories. He knows how to write<br/>
down separate letters of the alphabet but since he&#39;s not a fluent<br/>
reader yet he often dictates notes and stories and draws pictures with<br/>
them. I have a lot of notes and stickers Karl has given me.<br/>
<br/>
I have one on the refrigerator that says: &quot;Dear Mommy, I just wanted<br/>
you to have this so you can be happy&quot; with a smiley face he drew<br/>
himself. He asked me to write it down for a note he wanted me to have,<br/>
and then he put it on the refrigerator.<br/>
<br/>
While in church today, to keep him interested during a longish music<br/>
concert (the whole service worth) by some very wonderful accomplished<br/>
musicians, all three of us .... me, Brian and Karl .... drew a picture<br/>
on the blank back of the program sheet. He drew a boy (himself), Brian<br/>
drew his clothes, Karl drew our dog (great picture of Katie), I drew a<br/>
cat (unfortunately not OUR cat but serendipitously a Siamese cat),<br/>
Karl drew the dog leash, a soccer ball, the sun, a bolt or ray coming<br/>
from the sun (and later he said lightening is just a flash that comes<br/>
from God&#39;s eye -- I was like &quot;wow! how like Zeus&quot;), I drew a hula<br/>
hoop, a tree, a flower. It was drawn to the music. Hopefully I&#39;ll get<br/>
around to blogging it this week.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling to me is about developing and noticing the relationships<br/>
between people that are developing in the family for years... while<br/>
they&#39;re happening. And not letting those things slip away unnoticed.<br/>
It&#39;s about nurturing such things. And enjoying them as they happen.<br/>
Living in the moment.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Earlier in the week I went to bed with one kitchen counter really cluttered<br/>
&gt; up with stuff and crumbs. I woke up to a clean counter with the fruit and my<br/>
&gt; teas all organized nicely and the crumbs wiped off. A note left by my 11 yr<br/>
&gt; old daughter written in pink marker on a paper towel was in the middle of<br/>
&gt; the counter that said, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not uncommon for Olivia to go on little cleaning bursts late at night.<br/>
&gt; She also likes to leave me notes to find in the morning. Recently I work up<br/>
&gt; to a note on the refrigerator that said, &quot;Make muffins.&quot; So before she got<br/>
&gt; up for the day I made some banana chocolate chip muffins. I melted the<br/>
&gt; butter in the microwave and forgot to add it to the muffins. I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; realize I&#39;d left it out until after they were baking. The muffins were good<br/>
&gt; enough .. we ate them all.. they were just a little solid and dense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next morning I woke up and my 9 yr old son had added to Olivia&#39;s muffin<br/>
&gt; note .. It said, &quot;Add butter!!!&quot; So I made more. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My mom has been telling me for a couple years now that the kids are old<br/>
&gt; enough to have chores. She gets frustrated with me and tells me I would be<br/>
&gt; helping them learn responsibility, but I&#39;d rather have the love notes.<br/>
