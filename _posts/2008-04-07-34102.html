<div id="ygrps-yiv-601141858">The sad thing, for me, is when parents talk about their 9 year olds behavior as early teenager rebellion. As though it is early biology catching up with them, and not a squirming response to being kept pinned under someone&#39;s thumb.

So it seems. I often receive emails and read articles online promoting<br/>
the belief that teenage rebellion is a &#39;normal&#39; feature of growing up<br/>
and hear other parents talking as if it&#39;s unavoidable, but that&#39;s<br/>
total crap. My now 22 year old daughter&#39;s teenage years were a joy.<br/>
<br/>
Tell that to most parents though and they think you&#39;re being sarcastic. :)<br/>

I&#39;ve heard this from friends all through the years of my childs&#39; life and he&#39;s only 8! Hormones are blamed for everything that&#39;s for sure. I have always felt extremely frustrated with these comments because it&#39;s not a reasonable, tangible thing to be discussed and thought about. Abit like the crystals and potions it is not a helpful tool to draw on when we are trying to help our children on an unschooling journey.<br/>

<br/>
I think 5 yr olds respond to control in basically the same way that a<br/>
teen does.  The difference to me is that, just like many other things,<br/>
smaller kids display smaller things and bigger kids display bigger<br/>
things.  Like that old saying about &quot;little kids, little mistakes, big<br/>
kids, big mistakes&quot;.  It&#39;s the nature of getting bigger and older.  If<br/>
you take out the adversarial parenting aspect, you get kids that make<br/>
better decisions as they get older, because they were given the chance<br/>
to make all those little mistakes without fear and punishment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see clearly, when I&#39;ve made a mistake in regards to handling a<br/>
situation with one of my kids, how it was MY behavior that made the<br/>
situation worse when it could&#39;ve been better.  I let them know when I&#39;ve<br/>
done that and apologize.  Over the years I make fewer mistakes in that,<br/>
but still, I&#39;m human.  I figure it&#39;s good skills to learn and copy for<br/>
me and them, knowing when you&#39;ve made a mistake and fixing it and trying<br/>
not to do it again.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That is an interesting way at looking at that.  I can definitely see<br/>
that in Chamille even though she is 14(as of yesterday), she wants to go<br/>
out into the world in bigger ways than I am comfortable with yet.  We<br/>
are working on finding a way for this to happen.  I think travel is<br/>
going to be in the near future for this girl, just not sure how to do it<br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
We are doing a big house rearrange.  When I was going through some<br/>
things of Chamille&#39;s yesterday and I found one of those girl growing up<br/>
kind of journals that a friend gave her when she was about 9 or 10.  It<br/>
didn&#39;t have a lot in it, but some things were filled out and answered. <br/>
One question was &quot;what is the perfect age?&quot;.  Her answer was 14, and<br/>
that she couldn&#39;t wait to be 14 because it was the best age she could<br/>
think to be.  It was really timely and I shared it with her and tucked<br/>
it away into her keepsake box.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid wants to leave home they will find a way to do it.  If I&#39;m my<br/>
children&#39;s partner in that, I get to be involved, not left behind. <br/>
Chamille&#39;s desire to SEE the world has nothing to do with getting away<br/>
from us or rebeling, it&#39;s about going and doing and exploring, all those<br/>
things that we do for unschooling to work.  She is thinking bigger than<br/>
I was expecting, but it doesn&#39;t surprise me, it feels a little<br/>
overwhelming, but I&#39;m working on that.</div>

too enjoyable. I guess I&#39;m supposed to be dreading this stage. Ah<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083022020">I can&#39;t remember when my parents started telling me this, but I can&#39;t remember not knowing this.  They told me, hold on to your seats, that on my 18th birthday, I would find my bags packed on the porch.  They would raise me until then, but after that, it was my job to support myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Now,they weren&#39;t really serious.  They were mostly serious.  I think what they wanted to say was that they wanted me to become an independent adult.  But that was not the message I got.  I certainly got the message that I was not welcome or wanted after 18.  I moved out when I was 18 1/2, but moved back in after the death of my best friend when I was 23.  I stayed about four months, it was horrible.  I moved out and now I can barely live with them for a weekend. How sad.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, tell my girls I will always be there for them.  Alexx used to say she was going to move out but only to next house, next door, so she could visit.  Janene, when she was nursing, would say she would never ever move out, but later she said maybe but only if she could come home and nurse every night.  WhenI explained that she probably wouldn&#39;t be nursing when she moved out, she thought I was joking.  Not nursing?  She, of course, thought she&#39;d nurse forever.  (she did wean, and earlier than Alexx).  <br/>
<br/>
But anyway, I want my children to know they are welcome to live with me until they are ready to move out, just as they were welcome to share my bed and to nurse until they were ready to move on.  And when they do move on, I try to make sure they realize that I will always be here for them, they can always return. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523021309">That was beautiful, Joylyn, thank you for taking the time to write and<br/>
post this. I always thought that the &quot;out when you&#39;re 18&quot; thing was<br/>
cultural. I&#39;m South American and where I come from, it is practically<br/>
unheard of for parents to expect or even encourage that kind of<br/>
independence/separation. As a result of the cultural expectations<br/>
(combined with the economy) most young people continue to live at home<br/>
throughout their tertiary education (whether university or vocational<br/>
studies, neither of which are residential) and often well into their<br/>
twenties. Many don&#39;t move out until marriage, and this is seen as<br/>
perfectly natural. In fact, until a decade or so ago it was often the<br/>
opposite: When my cousin at twenty-six (!) moved out of her parents&#39;<br/>
house into a tiny apartment of her own without getting married, there<br/>
was some concern among people that first heard about it, that this<br/>
meant there have been some sort of problem in the parent-daughter<br/>
relationship. My uncle learned to just smile and say &quot;nothing&#39;s wrong<br/>
between us, we get along fine as ever, she just wants more<br/>
independence and privacy, that&#39;s all!&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m wondering whether, or how, this concept of &quot;pushing them out of<br/>
the nest&quot; relates to my earlier questions about teenage &quot;rebellion&quot;.<br/>
It seems to me that at some subconscious level, it may be easier for<br/>
someone who knows they&#39;re being &quot;kicked out&quot; so to speak, to start<br/>
severing ties earlier on...This is consistent with the cultural<br/>
differences I have seen - come to think of it, the &quot;rebellion&quot; thing<br/>
doesn&#39;t happen nearly as much in the cultures I grew up in, or at<br/>
least, it didn&#39;t use to happen when I grew up, nearly as much as here.<br/>

welcome to live at home with their parents until they have good reason  <br/>
to move out. No pressure and not even any subtle hints that &quot;it is  <br/>
about time.&quot; I do think it is cultural - my husband sometimes asks,  <br/>
&quot;Why the heck is 18 years old such a big deal in this country? It is  <br/>
like people think everything should change right then.&quot;  For his  <br/>
culture, it is more like when a person is ready to move on and live as  <br/>
an adult, they do it. Often, very often, they stay in their parents&#39;  <br/>
home until they marry (or even forever if they don&#39;t marry). Americans  <br/>
tend to look down on this - they think it is important for young  <br/>
adults to live &quot;on their own&quot; before they marry. And maybe it is  <br/>
generally good for them - I can&#39;t tell - too many other variables  <br/>
involved. But in a household where kids are controlled and have  <br/>
curfews and rules and all that, I can see that there is a whole lot  <br/>
more reason for them to need to spend time living on their own,  <br/>
learning about themselves, then there is for our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of them do seem to get that urge - it seems pretty natural to  <br/>
want to have the experience of being on their own. But, so far, my  <br/>
oldest had that urge in a big way and my second (20 yo) doesn&#39;t seem  <br/>
to have it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468799237">Holly and I went to Minnesota for a state conference last fall.  In  <br/>
the hotel there was a computer room and I was in there early on day.   <br/>
There was a young man from the other end of Mexico (not the guys from  <br/>
Chihuahua I&#39;m used to).  He was twenty-four and  was on the other  <br/>
computer leaving email for his girlfriend in Mexico.  He was working  <br/>
on some contract job that was going to end soon, and was looking  <br/>
forward to getting home.  Americans were bugging him.<br/>
<br/>
We talked a bit about homeschooling, in way of why I was there.  He  <br/>
got excited, but excited in this way:  He saw in me a kindred spirit,  <br/>
someone who wasn&#39;t mean to kids.  When he knew I had a 21 year old  <br/>
who had just moved out but who was welcome to come home, he said he   <br/>
had hardly met any Americans who didn&#39;t throw their kids out, and he  <br/>
thought it was the source of our family problems.  He said in Mexico,  <br/>
parents help their children financially even when they&#39;re grown, even  <br/>
when they move out, and that makes it natural for the children to  <br/>
help the parents, and siblings.<br/>

He was appalled at the way family members treated each other in the U.S.<br/>

<br/>
When I was a freshman in High School, I had a boyfriend named Kevin. He was a senior. We only dated for a month or two. His parents had been telling him for years that the day he graduated he was on his own.  On May 10, a couple weeks before graduation, he shot himself. He died a week later. Thats the worst case scenario.<br/>
No, I guess worse is when teens commit violent acts on others, then themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s parents talk A LOT about how when their kids were little, all they could wait for was for them to grow up and move out. Every year, the family joke is that all the parents want for Christmas is peace and quiet. One of his mother&#39;s favorite refrains is &quot;goddamn kids&quot; and she refers to her grandchildren as Indians when they make any noise or run around. <br/>
<br/>
Although they did pay for college or similar for all the kids that wanted to pursue it, it was all with strings attached. My husband isnt one to talk about his emotions or the past much, but he has said on occasion how sad it was to feel unwelcome in his childhood home. Even if there was nothing big or dramatic as a result, I believe that all the times his parents said stuff like that, it chipped away and made his life sadder, and made it harder to believe and trust in his future relationships. He often makes jokes on the premise that our children will grow up to hate us, or rebel or sneak out at night, etc. I guess, thats maybe another result...that kind of treatment makes you accept thats just how relationships are with parents and kids. I think if he *really* thought about it, he&#39;d know thats not what he wants to happen. But he often says he wont hope for things or try too hard, just in case it doesnt work out, so he wont be disappointed. I worry<br/>
 sometimes that is going to trump his desire to make our marriage and family happy and successful. <br/>
<br/>
My mom used to tell me I couldnt come home or stay home sometimes, when she was mad at me. (I was 16, 17)I&#39;d stay at my dad&#39;s or a friend&#39;s. Then she would get mad that I didnt call her to tell her where I was. Before I left for college, my dad told me he wasnt going to be my dad anymore. This is because he caught me stealing quarters from his house. I was stealing them because I hated his guts and was really pissed at hime. I had been working in his office all summer before college. He had told me that if I quit smoking cigarettes, he&#39;d match every penny I saved when I left for school. Behind my back, he told my brother that he had no intention of paying me anything, that it was just to get me to quit smoking and save all my money. So I started smoking again and went to his house to steal his money. He caught me and when I told him my brother had told me my dad&#39;s plan, all he could say was that it wasnt my brothers business to tell me. Oh, and that he<br/>
 wasnt going to be my dad anymore because I never lived up to my potential and kept disappointing him. <br/>
<br/>
My parents spent a lot of time telling me that I could be anything I wanted, do anything I set my mind to. But what they really meant is that they thought I could achieve what *they* wanted for me. They always said they would be proud as long as I did my best, unfortunately, they never believed I was actually doing my best. It was a classic catch-22 situation.<br/>
<br/>
No, I wanted to leave home. I wasnt ready for college and in fact, I dropped out/flunked out/quit, but the alternative was living at home with people who were not kind to me, so I did whatever I had to do to stay away. And that included other bad living situations, bad relationships, bad stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve written alot. But I found out about unschooling when I was pregnant with my first baby. It was a revelation to me. I knew pretty much right away that I had to do what it took to get *there*, to unschooling. To mindful parenting, to respect and trust and love. That I couldnt perpetrate on my children the kind of childhood I&#39;d had. My parents said they loved me, but it never felt like love. I had boyfriends who said they loved me, but were not very nice to me and I never felt their love either.<br/>
<br/>
I love my husband and my kids and I feel their love and I cant and wont do anything to ruin that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960050062">I was talking about this at LLL tonight.  Both women said it&#39;s a &quot;white&quot; thing.  So, I guess it is cultural. <br/>

&gt; post this. I always thought that the &quot;out when you&#39;re 18&quot; thing was<br/>
&gt; cultural. I&#39;m South American and where I come from, it is practically<br/>
&gt; unheard of for parents to expect or even encourage that kind of<br/>
&gt; independence/separation. As a result of the cultural expectations<br/>
&gt; (combined with the economy) most young people continue to live at home<br/>
&gt; throughout their tertiary education (whether university or vocational<br/>
&gt; studies, neither of which are residential) and often well into their<br/>
&gt; twenties. Many don&#39;t move out until marriage, and this is seen as<br/>
&gt; perfectly natural. In fact, until a decade or so ago it was often the<br/>
&gt; opposite: When my cousin at twenty-six (!) moved out of her parents&#39;<br/>
&gt; house into a tiny apartment of her own without getting married, there<br/>
&gt; was some concern among people that first heard about it, that this<br/>
&gt; meant there have been some sort of problem in the parent-daughter<br/>
&gt; relationship. My uncle learned to just smile and say &quot;nothing&#39;s wrong<br/>
&gt; between us, we get along fine as ever, she just wants more<br/>
&gt; independence and privacy, that&#39;s all!&quot;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering whether, or how, this concept of &quot;pushing them out of<br/>
&gt; the nest&quot; relates to my earlier questions about teenage &quot;rebellion&quot;.<br/>
&gt; It seems to me that at some subconscious level, it may be easier for<br/>
&gt; someone who knows they&#39;re being &quot;kicked out&quot; so to speak, to start<br/>
&gt; severing ties earlier on...This is consistent with the cultural<br/>
&gt; differences I have seen - come to think of it, the &quot;rebellion&quot; thing<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t happen nearly as much in the cultures I grew up in, or at<br/>
&gt; least, it didn&#39;t use to happen when I grew up, nearly as much as here.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t remember when my parents started telling me this, but I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember not knowing this. They told me, hold on to your seats, that on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; 18th birthday, I would find my bags packed on the porch. They would raise me<br/>
&gt; &gt; until then, but after that, it was my job to support myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Now,they weren&#39;t really serious. They were mostly serious. I think what<br/>
&gt; &gt; they wanted to say was that they wanted me to become an independent adult.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But that was not the message I got. I certainly got the message that I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; not welcome or wanted after 18. I moved out when I was 18 1/2, but moved<br/>
&gt; &gt; back in after the death of my best friend when I was 23. I stayed about four<br/>
&gt; &gt; months, it was horrible. I moved out and now I can barely live with them for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a weekend. How sad.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I, on the other hand, tell my girls I will always be there for them. Alexx<br/>
&gt; &gt; used to say she was going to move out but only to next house, next door, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; she could visit. Janene, when she was nursing, would say she would never<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever move out, but later she said maybe but only if she could come home and<br/>
&gt; &gt; nurse every night. WhenI explained that she probably wouldn&#39;t be nursing<br/>
&gt; &gt; when she moved out, she thought I was joking. Not nursing? She, of course,<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought she&#39;d nurse forever. (she did wean, and earlier than Alexx).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  But anyway, I want my children to know they are welcome to live with me<br/>
&gt; &gt; until they are ready to move out, just as they were welcome to share my bed<br/>
&gt; &gt; and to nurse until they were ready to move on. And when they do move on, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; try to make sure they realize that I will always be here for them, they can<br/>
&gt; &gt; always return.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641780096">-=-When I was a freshman in High School, I had a boyfriend named  <br/>
Kevin. He was a senior. We only dated for a month or two. His parents  <br/>
had been telling him for years that the day he graduated he was on  <br/>
his own. On May 10, a couple weeks before graduation, he shot  <br/>
himself. He died a week later. Thats the worst case scenario.<br/>
No, I guess worse is when teens commit violent acts on others, then  <br/>
themselves.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear that.<br/>
<br/>
I had two friends commit suicide in 8th and 9th grades (ages 13,  <br/>
14/15 for non-American-school readers).<br/>
<br/>
One had been my boyfriend, but wasn&#39;t right at that time, but we were  <br/>
very close and still friends.  His dad was our art teacher and had  <br/>
been since elementary school, Florencio Montoya, a silversmith.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/people/charlesmontoya">http://sandradodd.com/people/charlesmontoya</a><br/>
<br/>
I still haven&#39;t written it up.  I&#39;m a little wary of doing so.  There  <br/>
was no one good reason he shot himself, with a hunting rifle, in a  <br/>
sleeping bag in his bedroom.   We know of lots of little ones.  And  <br/>
one rarely spoken is he might&#39;ve been gay.  It was 1968; too soon to  <br/>
be out about such things, if that was a factor.  His dad was a WWII  <br/>
veteran as were almost all our dads, and gave him his spot at the  <br/>
cemetery.   (One more person from the family can be buried there,  <br/>
still.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure part of why I&#39;ve been willing to hear people&#39;s problems is  <br/>
because of that.  I wish Charles had talked to me (or someone), but  <br/>
he didn&#39;t.   I was a fair kid-counsellor when I was little.  One of  <br/>
the best, I guess, in our school, and the other kids knew it, but  <br/>
what I was doing was really pretty much against school rules.  It was  <br/>
being nosy.  It was talking too much.  It got me B&#39;s and C&#39;s in  <br/>
conduct when I was getting A&#39;s in everything else.  Interpersonal  <br/>
intelligence was just  being a too-talkative kid, in those days.  I  <br/>
got no credit for fights or public scenes I helped avert, or for  <br/>
peace I helped make.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching I knowingly and purposely asked such kids to help  <br/>
out when I could see trouble brewing.  Within any group of  kids,  <br/>
there are specialities and talents like that that school tends to  <br/>
ignore completely.<br/>
<br/>
When we had a playgroup, from the time Kirby was a baby to when he  <br/>
was 13 (started as a LLL babysitting co-op weekly playgroup and  <br/>
evolved into an unschooling group), Kirby and Sarah Cordova (who was  <br/>
in swimming lessons with him) were the two we asked to investigate  <br/>
disputes and calm waters, if they hadn&#39;t already noticed and done it  <br/>
before we asked.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but I think this is another sad after-effect of the  <br/>
Depression and WWII.<br/>
<br/>
Any able-bodied male who was still home at 18 was a lazy wuss, unless  <br/>
they owned a big farm and he planned to continue to do exactly what  <br/>
his father told him to do indefinitely.    Then he was an energetic  <br/>
wuss, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
The early 20th century was not very kind to anyone, was it?  (Well,  <br/>
up to about 1918 some people were having a hell of a party in parts  <br/>
of the U.S., anyway!  Not the recent immigrants who were preparing  <br/>
food and clothes for and cleaning up after  and guarding said parties.)<br/>
<br/>
People who grew up with harsh, resentful parents and became harsh  <br/>
resentful parents had people like me!  I look back and see  <br/>
generations of harsh resentment.  I look the other way and I see my  <br/>
kids.<br/>

I don&#39;t think she was talking about foster parents, but a state home  <br/>
(county or whoever was running group homes).  (I could be wrong.)<br/>
The state does cut off their benefits, though, at 18.<br/>

John was a student of my dad&#39;s who was kicked out of his house and lived with us as a foster kid for years, far past 18.  In retrospect, I&#39;m not even certain he was in our home as a legit foster kid or just because my dad liked the kid and brogh him home for years.  He&#39;s still a part of our lives.  Not much, because he&#39;s distanced himself, but he comes and goes, and is always welcome.  <br/>

   <br/>
  That&#39;s so true Sandra....I think most of us are 3rd or 4th generation of that embitterment that happened - and understandably so as times were sooo hard and frustrating, it&#39;s just too bad that once times became good again, the fear and bitterness remained.  I see the same thing when I look a couple of generations behind me -- a lot of harshness, bitterness, anger, control, fear, estranged relationships, etc.  And up until lately, when I&#39;ve looked in the mirror I&#39;ve seen remnants of it but tried to hide it really well....except my children noticed because I couldn&#39;t hide it 24/7.  I REALLY don&#39;t want to see that anymore.  When I look the other way, I see my children....I see a lot of freedom in the younger ones, and some freedom mixed with some of the other stuff in the older ones.  Hopefully, by the time the older ones start their families (probably within the next decade as the oldest is 17), they will know that I am truely FOR them, BELIEVE in them, LOVE them<br/>
 unconditionally.  The younger ones are eating up their new-found freedom....and loving it.  The older ones seem a little on edge, like wondering when the bomb is going to drop.  I&#39;m sad I created that feeling in them, but hopefully some day soon they will trust me...and hopefully I can remain trustworthy with their feelings and emotions.  Wow, that was more than I intended to say.  Shannon<br/>
