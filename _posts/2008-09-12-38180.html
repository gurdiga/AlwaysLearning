<br/>
Gail Higgins (of GailandBroc) was here the night after the conference, <br/>
on her way back down to Florida. We were talking about how much fun we <br/>
had at the conference---and how much fun we have with other unschoolers <br/>
(probably about the same time this thread came down the pipe---I just <br/>
hadn&#39;t read it yet! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I have a GREAT time with GailandBroc. In fact, we&#39;re meeting <br/>
them next weekend at a B&B near Charlotte, NC---no kids (Logan and <br/>
Cameron are at NBTSCamp, Brenna&#39;s at college, and Duncan is fishing <br/>
with my dad).<br/>
<br/>
But Gail and I were talking the other night about how much FUN <br/>
unschooling *parents* are. The PARENTS are FUN.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t whine about their children, their jobs, their lives. They&#39;ve <br/>
undergone this paradigm shift that makes them fun to be around. They&#39;re <br/>
joy-seekers---joy-FINDERS. They&#39;re waaay more willing to try new <br/>
things, go new places---and just *enjoy* life. Way more so than any <br/>
other group I&#39;ve ever been with.<br/>
<br/>
At the conference, several members of the staff at the BRA commented on <br/>
how engaged and fun the parents were. They were IN the pool with the <br/>
kids---not reading books on the pool deck. They were DOING the <br/>
challenge courses with the kids---not watching from the ground. There <br/>
were parents, in costume, at the ball---AND dancing. They MODEL the <br/>
exciting and joy-filled life we want for our children.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re different.<br/>
<br/>
Child-like. Exuberant. Risk-takers. Fun.<br/>
<br/>
Screw the children. &lt;g&gt; THESE are FUN people to hang around!<br/>
<br/>
If---no, WHEN---the children are gone, these are the folks *I* want to <br/>
still have as friends. The children GOT us together, but several of us <br/>
have children gone or almost gone---so it&#39;s not the kids who are <br/>
keeping our friendships alive. It&#39;s the &quot;aliveness&quot; of the parents.<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I have mostly drifted away from many of the folks we grew up <br/>
with, went to college with, met through the Air Force, and have as <br/>
neighbors. They&#39;re simply not as fun as unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
So---I fully accept seeming like a cult member, but it&#39;s a damn fine <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141656123">Well yes!  The kool-aid&#39;s fine.  Come on in.  I mean it (no snarkiness<br/>
here).<br/>
<br/>
But until such a time as one finds/meets/gathers an unschooling tribe, one<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to wait around for it to happen.  Karl needs people.  I moved<br/>
from TN with a grand tribe... a fun bunch of people!  Wow.  To upstate SC<br/>
where unschoolers don&#39;t appear to be thriving.  If I&#39;m wrong please correct<br/>
me!  I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s like that.  There&#39;s some great unschoolers here.<br/>
And in the meantime until a tribe is gathered, there are others to infect<br/>
with the &quot;fun&quot; bug if I can.  If not maybe in the process of looking, I can<br/>
run into a circle of unschoolers to hang with.  The communities are *much*<br/>
more far flung in my area than that in TN, and that may be why I don&#39;t know<br/>
but a handful where I&#39;m living now.  Plus I&#39;ve only been back here this<br/>
summer and it was really hot weather for going to park days.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers I&#39;ve met are more resigned with their *not*<br/>
unschooling-friendly crowd than happy.  So many of them seem to feel<br/>
obligated to be around extended family and other folk who don&#39;t seem to ever<br/>
want to get it.  Some have spouses unfriendly to unschooling.  Many don&#39;t<br/>
know how to keep their spirits from flagging.  I know.  Blah blah blah..<br/>
problems problems.  I am determined to be happy and I know it may take time<br/>
to find like minded people in my area and lots of relaxing into the social<br/>
scene (let&#39;s face it I&#39;ve not pushed myself too hard and it *is* a skill).<br/>
Until now ... if it was easy (TN), I did well -- if it&#39;s not, I&#39;m tempted to<br/>
get like an absent minded professor and burrow down into my well-entrenched<br/>
warren a little more deeply.  Don&#39;t want to go back to doing that.  :)<br/>

<br/>
I wondered about that!<br/>
As one of the parents that chose NOT to swim, I looked around the pool<br/>
and wondered if the staff noticed the PROFOUND difference in the<br/>
parent/child interactions. There was a pool full of kids and parents<br/>
laughing and interacting joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody was being shamed or yelled at or threatened. Challenges were<br/>
handled respectfully....and there were so very few of those. I had to<br/>
wonder if the staff noticed how joyful the ENTIRE time at the pool<br/>
was. I guess it hit me down there more than anywhere else because<br/>
normally at pools we really see some ugly behavior from adults!<br/>
<br/>
Cool that they did notice.:)<br/>
I was talking to parents on the pool deck and making ATC&#39;s. Happily<br/>
staying dry. Scott swam four hours one day...I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s fully<br/>
recovered yet. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I  used to do costume parties before we had kids.  We met  <br/>
in an SCA madrigal group.  (We did SCA, speaking of &quot;costume  <br/>
parties,&quot; but I was thinking of regular Halloween and masquerade  <br/>
stuff in the first sentence.)<br/>
<br/>
When i was pregnant with Kirby, we went to &quot;a hat party&quot; of Sperry  <br/>
employees (before Honeywell bought them).  Keith wore a brass and  <br/>
steel and fur helmet with deer antlers on it.  I wore a leather  <br/>
biker&#39;s sloop cap, and on my pregnant belly I had a frilly eyelet  <br/>
baby cap.<br/>
<br/>
Of the others there, most were wearing non-descript baseball caps or  <br/>
boring conservative gardening hats, or nothing.  But two guys stood  <br/>
out.  One had a German ski-cap with pins from lots of European ski  <br/>
resorts.  One guy had a helicopter test-pilot&#39;s helmet!<br/>
<br/>
Only thing was, the first guy was a skier and had been to all those  <br/>
resorts, and the other guy was a helicoper test pilot.  It&#39;s not that  <br/>
those things aren&#39;t cool, it&#39;s just that neither of them &quot;wore a hat&quot;  <br/>
in the sense that he thought of a fun thing to do just for the sake  <br/>
of the party.<br/>
<br/>
We were invited to a party where people said &quot;bring a game.&quot;   We  <br/>
owned tons of cool games, but we happened by a video arcade that day  <br/>
that had some games for sale.  For $150, I think, we bought &quot;Amidar,&quot;  <br/>
and took it to the party in the back of the pickup we already had.   <br/>
We set it to 100 free plays and let people have at it.   Then we took  <br/>
it home, had a baby, and here&#39;s Kirby playing that game at our house,  <br/>
later:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When I was pregnant with Marty, I went to a New Year&#39;s Eve party as a  <br/>
giant Hershey&#39;s kiss.  Keith made it.  There was a circle of  <br/>
cardboard behind me, and I  made a long ribbon version of the paper  <br/>
that (used to, I don&#39;t think they have them anymore) sticks out, and  <br/>
Keith wrapped the whole thing in aluminum foil.  Marty was born two  <br/>
weeks later.<br/>
<br/>
This made it EASY for us to get unschooling.  It made it easier for  <br/>
people who have met our family to get unschooling.  It keeps us from  <br/>
needing other unschooling families as much as some people do, because  <br/>
our longtime childless friends also make costumes and go on  <br/>
adventures and have very cool hobbies.<br/>
<br/>
Someone with a keen interest in the Middle Ages can do lots of stuff  <br/>
at home, alone, but they can&#39;t eat a feast by candlelight with 200  <br/>
others.  They can&#39;t cook for 200 others, even.  They can  make armor,  <br/>
but they can&#39;t test it out without another friend in armor.  They  <br/>
could listen to tons of madrigals and medieval partsongs, but they  <br/>
can&#39;t create them in the dark in the mountains without other friends  <br/>
who know them too.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe I&#39;m not saying at all that people couldn&#39;t use having &quot;a  <br/>
cult&quot; of likeminded friends, just that Keith and I already had that.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe the best thing that conferences do for those who just  <br/>
haven&#39;t quite gotten unschooling to work is to give them examples and  <br/>
feedback.  If a dad can see another dad scoop up &quot;a big kid&quot; happily  <br/>
and carry him even though he&#39;s &quot;a big boy and old enough to walk,&quot; or  <br/>
can see a mom &quot;pause&quot; an adult exchange and ask a whiny kid what he  <br/>
wants instead of motioning him away or threatening him, then they  <br/>
will have a more visceral, physical understanding than they will get  <br/>
reading here with people saying &quot;respect your child&#39;s needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to have those people every single day, but it helps to  <br/>
figure out ways to have them from time to time.<br/>

home schooling.<br/>

...its just that my 8 year old and my 5 year old fight like cats and  <br/>
dogs all the time so I don&#39;t think I could handle all that. They  <br/>
fight from the time they come in from school until bed time. But Oh  <br/>
well I am glad that you like homeschooling<br/>

A stay-at-home mom has two kids who fight like cats and dogs when  <br/>
they get home from school.  She thinks they would fight that way all  <br/>
the time if they weren&#39;t in school, instead of seeing that school is  <br/>
the big factor.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s part of a cult too, but a BIG cult that thinks school is  <br/>
natural and normal, and that if life isn&#39;t going well, more school  <br/>
might be the answer (or tutoring or after-school programs, or school  <br/>
counsellors or different schools).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last year, at the pool, one of the staff was being pretty harsh with  <br/>
the kids. I can&#39;t remember the details, but as I recall one of the  <br/>
parents had a little conversation with the staff person (I think it  <br/>
was Danielle Conger) about treating the kids respectfully and I think  <br/>
it was fine after that. My daughter and I sat by the pool and watched  <br/>
the parents and kids in the pool. There is something about pool play  <br/>
that often brings out the worst in adults in terms of how they treat  <br/>
children - we have a backyard pool and I&#39;ve seen it many times -  <br/>
parents yell at their kids, grab them, make very arbitrary rules, set  <br/>
unreasonable limits. Rosie and I sat watching the parents and kids  <br/>
having so much fun in the pool at L&L and really noticed and talked  <br/>
about how kind and gentle the parents were being, it was a contrast to  <br/>
what we so often see, even from families having fun together - at girl  <br/>
scout family camp, for example.<br/>

gathered stuff (we were the last ones out of the pool that day) and collected  <br/>
belongings to hike back up the hill. The staff interacted with him, talked with <br/>
 him and treated him with respect-how often does a 3 year old get that from <br/>
the  general public?? It wasn&#39;t anything out of the norm for *him*, since he&#39;s  <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Someone stated that it seemed too &quot;cultish&quot; <br/>
to be hanging out with other unschoolers.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
�<br/>
Actually, that was me. What I said was, &quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I do know if we had a social life�only with other�unschoolers, we&#39;d have a very small, narrow life! I love hanging out with other unschooling families and sharing, but to be dependent on other unschooling families entirely seems somehow cultish to me.&quot;<br/>
�<br/>
Kelly also said:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;how much fun we have with other unschoolers&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
�<br/>
and<br/>
�<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;how much FUN unschooling *parents* are. The PARENTS are FUN.<br/>
They don&#39;t whine about their children, their jobs, their lives. They&#39;ve <br/>
undergone this paradigm shift that makes them fun to be around. They&#39;re <br/>
joy-seekers- --joy-FINDERS. They&#39;re waaay more willing to try new <br/>
things, go new places---and just *enjoy* life. Way more so than any <br/>
other group I&#39;ve ever been with.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let me clarify. I should have�put the word &#39;only&#39;�after &#39;dependent&#39;.�I LOVE hanging out with other unschoolers for much the same reasons you state. BUT... If we depended solely on other unschoolers for our friendships and socialization, we&#39;d have a very small pot to draw from (we don&#39;t live in a very large community). We have some unschooling friends in our town (and we definitely spend the most amount of time with them &lt;g&gt;), but we also have other good friends�who are not even homeschooling, much less unschooling. Saying that, they do practice respectful, attached�parenting and are fun, adventurous, and interesting�people.<br/>
I have met other unschoolers that will not socialize with anyone (except family) that are not also�unschoolers. I think that&#39;s narrow minded and cultish.<br/>

I  like having a variety of people in my life but the &quot;variety&quot; only  <br/>
seems to include people who have at least two of music/humor/creativity.<br/>
There are a few unschoolers who don&#39;t meet my requirements. &lt;g&gt;   I  <br/>
think for unschooling to work well, the parents need to move switfly  <br/>
and surely toward at least humor and creativity!<br/>

Absolutely!<br/>
Humor and creativity�are two qualities that my friends and family have as well. <br/>
Humor is especially important to me :-)<br/>
