<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580788130">On another list, Walmart shopping has become a topic of brutal<br/>
parenting. As you all have probably seen, parents at Walmart are often<br/>
frazzeled, hurried and stressed. Apparently a homeschool mom SAW a<br/>
two year old being hit by a man with A BELT at Walmart, tried to stop<br/>
him and was threatened with arrest by a Walmart security officer.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to develop a plan for bringing this to public scrutiny. I<br/>
am going to write a message to Michael Moore. If Michael Moore can<br/>
get bullets out of Kmart. We can get violence out of Walmart.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for non-violent advocacy for children?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pat</div>

I hope she asked to speak to the manager, and that she called the police.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I despise Michael Moore&#39;s work, so I wouldn&#39;t want him on my side <br/>
on anything. He&#39;s odious.  If he couldn&#39;t get it straight that school causes <br/>
school shootings, why should he do anything but blame George Bush for spanking?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813534612">I wish that were so. I have forwarded the mom&#39;s personal response to <br/>
my questioning this report to Always Learning. As a child I was hit <br/>
with a belt as punishment. So, I never assumed it was an urban <br/>
legend. I was appalled that it happened to such a young child in such <br/>
a public place. The absurdity was that the woman trying to intervene, <br/>
rather than the man assaulting the child, was threatened with arrest. <br/>
I assumed that this level of violence was more isolated and at least <br/>
secretive. The public acceptance by the Walmart security officer is <br/>
dumbfounding to me. <br/>
<br/>
Wendy Piesnitz of Life Learning magazine is posting a request for <br/>
resources in her outgoing newsletter. I have posted to Jan Hunt, who <br/>
has been a long time advocate of non-violence for children. And I <br/>
have sent a letter to Walmart notifing them of my campaign to get <br/>
violence out of Walmart. I have been on the nospank.net site which <br/>
seems to be a political effort to remove corporal punishment from <br/>
schools, home, towns, and businesses. (Evidently, 23 states still <br/>
allow corporal punishment in schools!) My goal is to incorporporate <br/>
(no pun intended) Project No Spank&#39;s &quot;Kid Safe Zone&quot; onto the <br/>
corporate conscious and doors of Walmart. <br/>
<br/>
This was first reported by Patricia Tidmore at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Homespun@yahoogroups.com">Homespun@yahoogroups.com</a> a homeschooling site for special needs <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Any further suggestions would be appreciated. I have posted this to <br/>
all my homeschooling sites. Please feel free to do so also. <br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Pat<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873801280">Well, Sandra you stumped me. I had to look up &quot;odious&quot; in my 1972 <br/>
dictionary. <br/>
<br/>
I have only seen Michael Moore&#39;s Bowling for Columbine movie, so I <br/>
can&#39;t speak for his political bashing of Bush. In the movie, I (a <br/>
Libertarian) and my husband (a rabid Republican) thought that the <br/>
presentation of violence in America was objectively damning of both <br/>
political parties and corporate America. <br/>
<br/>
I do think the idea of engaging the media for children&#39;s advocacy is <br/>
useful to change public acceptance of this horror. What other <br/>
suggestions do you have? We are all here advocating for a changed <br/>
belief system that respects children. But the blatant violence of <br/>
this needs more than on line discussion. Thanks for any ideas.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe go see it to verify.  <br/>
<br/>
Matt Stone of South Park was the only one to nail schools for it.  He was one <br/>
of many interviewed.<br/>
<br/>
Moore is sure it&#39;s because of some combination of Bush, the existence of <br/>
guns, and a missile plant in Colorado.  He&#39;s willfully ignoring simple fact to <br/>
create political propaganda.  And he&#39;s a lying dipwad and is hateful to Charlton <br/>
Heston, who has always been a good husband,  a good dad, a responsible actor <br/>
(researched the heck out of El Cid in the 50s before playing that part), and <br/>
who is altogether honorable, unlike this sleaze Moore. <br/>
<br/>
His idea of problem solving is to cause way MORE kinds of missing-the-point <br/>
problems and in the confusion, someone might change something, he&#39;s not sure.  <br/>
But meantime he will make money.  Sleazy.<br/>

<br/>
The only problem I have with this is that I don&#39;t think you can make a<br/>
national case out of one incident. If one manager at Wal-Mart did this and<br/>
then dropped it and Wal-Mart didn&#39;t support his decision then it&#39;s just one<br/>
idiot not thinking straight. But if there is a history of this - that&#39;s what<br/>
you need to find out here. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032347259">Sondra, <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your perspective. My goal is for Walmart to take a <br/>
proactive stand against violence in their stores internally and <br/>
publically. Perhaps naive, but it starts with one person trying to do <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Evidently the nospank.net site has free placards for posting a &quot;Kids&#39; <br/>
Safe Zone&quot; with &quot;No Spanking&quot; and a big red circle with a slash <br/>
through it. I want to see these posted on Walmart doors. Walmart <br/>
needs positive PR. They have the &quot;Code Adam&quot; alerts but how could one <br/>
know if a child being hit within their store is not being abducted. <br/>
Walmart can choose to be an advocate for non-violence for children. <br/>
Or I&#39;ll try Target, Kmart, etc. next.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of the story, I forwarded your questions to the woman <br/>
who intervened for the child. My issue is a proactive stance that <br/>
Walmart can promote, not only the individual issue that occured at <br/>
their store. I think we could all reiterate a history of violence <br/>
toward children in public places, not just at Walmart. <br/>
<br/>
I am looking for national contacts to facilitate my commitment to <br/>
this effort of public scrutiny of hitting children. Do you have any <br/>
suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I am going to enlist any constructive avenues to <br/>
changing this legally and socially &quot;acceptable&quot; practice. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Pat<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439035215">That&#39;s pretty cool - actually. That&#39;s an awesome idea - it would force<br/>
Wal-Mart to take a public stance one way or the other - nice. I&#39;d back that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Ok - so if you contact your local Wal-Mart and ask them to put this in their<br/>
window and say you&#39;re backed by this national organization that supports<br/>
this - and then they turn you down - they&#39;ll probably send you up the chain<br/>
of command to regional etc. <br/>
<br/>
You could get mega press on the fact that Wal-Mart says no to being a<br/>
non-spanking site. It would make it look like they value dollars over kids -<br/>
ooooh - nice nice press possibilities here. <br/>
<br/>
Does the Nospanking site do this kind of thing or just offer the stuff? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157858630">Hmmm - I don&#39;t know if I can agree with that  - it&#39;s not like the<br/>
republicans don&#39;t have their own Michael Moores out there using these<br/>
techniques and he&#39;s teaching them rhetoric 101. I think it&#39;s the other way<br/>
around - the dems are just starting to show their fangs after the obvious<br/>
ineffectiveness of peaceful and respectful debate with the likes of Ann<br/>
Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. <br/>
<br/>
Not to mention Mel Gibson and Arnold. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like a lot of what Moore does - but you have to hand it to him, he<br/>
knows how to do it. <br/>
<br/>
Propaganda has been around since ancient Greece and surely before - Michael<br/>
Moore didn&#39;t introduce it - or even reintroduce it in this time. He&#39;s just<br/>
playing by the game of the day. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d invite him to dinner, but<br/>
I&#39;m glad he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing. Also - it&#39;s a great way to talk with my<br/>
kids about subjects like rhetoric, propaganda, half-truths, statistics, the<br/>
power of images and on and on. <br/>

Propaganda has been around since ancient Greece and surely before -  Michael<br/>
Moore didn&#39;t introduce it - or even reintroduce it in this time.  He&#39;s just<br/>
playing by the game of the day. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d invite him to  dinner, but<br/>
I&#39;m glad he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing. Also - it&#39;s a great way to  talk with my<br/>
kids about subjects like rhetoric, propaganda, half-truths,  statistics, the<br/>
power of images and on and on.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not saying it hasn&#39;t. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s going to become &quot;common  <br/>
practice&quot; to use &quot;documentaries&quot; (and I use that term veeeerrrrrryyyy loosely)  as a <br/>
vehicle for sway stupid people.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s dangerous.<br/>
 <br/>
And the problem is that waaay too many people WON&#39;T use the experience to  <br/>
talk with their children  (or each other) about those things! They&#39;ll  accept it <br/>
as truth with absolutely NO thinking. Dangerous. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266648232">No, I love your idea and I am going to do it locally and from <br/>
corporate down. There are many ways to change old dogs, you know. I <br/>
will contact local tv stations and approach the local Walmart. How <br/>
can they say no? At least not for long. Thanks for the strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Jan Hunt of the NaturalChild directed me to the originator of Project <br/>
No Spank. Evidently, he worked to remove &#39;canning&#39; out of schools in <br/>
Australia. The nospank.net site has information on approaching your <br/>
local town council for support of non-violence of children in the <br/>
community and &quot;your school&quot;. That sounds like a bigger project than I <br/>
can take on with a three year old for now. But anyone can receive the <br/>
placards and distribute them to local businesses and medical offices <br/>
locally and for bumper stickers for friends. Will you?<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is active with attachment parenting in the <br/>
largest church locally and I am going to discuss the religious avenue <br/>
too. Jan Hunt directed me to the parentinginjesusfootsteps.org site <br/>
and their contact too. I am going to try to get them together.<br/>
<br/>
Another site Jan directed me to was www.neverhitachild.org it is <br/>
emotional. I have contacted Randy Cox their director also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas. Keep them coming.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656665744">I agree - it is dangerous. But it also has always been around and it&#39;s not<br/>
the first time that films and even documentaries have been used for<br/>
propaganda. It&#39;s just a really effective example of it. And there are times<br/>
when you have to fight fire with fire. If the stupid people are going to be<br/>
swayed with rhetoric - and they will - I want them to be swayed to the less<br/>
dangerous ideology. I hate it as much as anyone, but until we catch up as a<br/>
species and teach the masses critical thinking, this will always be part of<br/>
the mix. Sorry - I&#39;m kind of a pragmatic idealist - a frustrating type to<br/>
communicate with - I empathize. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053084653">I agree - but I think we disagree on our definitions of integrity. I admire<br/>
Martin Luther King and I also admire Malcom X. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s completely<br/>
clear when the pragmatic approach is more or less the choice of integrity.<br/>
It&#39;s one of those very difficult questions that has no real answer. Like the<br/>
character in Sophie&#39;s Choice - if you have to choice which one of your<br/>
children live and which one dies - what do you do? The hard-line idealist in<br/>
me says &quot;Neither!&quot; but then they both die. It&#39;s essentially a choice that<br/>
shouldn&#39;t have to be made. But it is. I have no idea what I would do - but I<br/>
do know it&#39;s not as black or white as we all sometimes feel it is. <br/>
