<div id="ygrps-yiv-717085915">Roll it backwards, the opposite way of the way it has been rolled, and  leave <br/>
it that way an hour or a day and see if it&#39;s not flatter.<br/>
 <br/>
Ironing is okay for folded maps, to get the creases down, but it&#39;s not best  <br/>
for a rolled thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391181800">Have you thought of laminating it? We like to laminate the things that we<br/>
want to keep nice, though the lamination can cost as much or more as the<br/>
map! Our local Kinko&#39;s laminates for $3 a square foot, and their limit size<br/>
is 36&quot; wide with no length limit.<br/>

I thought I&#39;d ask here since surely so many people have maps and posters on<br/>
their walls.  What is the best way you&#39;ve found to flatten a map?  I have a<br/>
large wall map of the US that I flattened by putting big books on it on the<br/>
floor for several days. It never really got to the flat and smooth point.<br/>
Plus the cat loves to lie on any piece of paper and you never know when<br/>
she&#39;ll get a hair ball.  I just got a poster of an Egyptian history timeline<br/>

iron it?  Would that work?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178263876">Thanks, Sandra and Jackie for the ideas.  I appreciate them.  I will probably use Sandra&#39;s now, but I have some maps that I&#39;d like to take to Kinkos this week, including my big US map.  Thank you both!  It&#39;s the first thing I couldn&#39;t find on www.ehow.com ...  Sandra, you might want to submit your answer.  :o)<br/>

Maybe I will.  <br/>
 <br/>
We used to order lots of posters when I was teaching, and they came in COOL  <br/>
triangular boxes which could be fastened together for mailing, so it was just  <br/>
one package no matter how many of the triangles had been taped together.   <br/>
They&#39;d put three or four per box, and we would roll them backwards and stick  <br/>
them back in the boxes.  Some kids took boxes home, some took them  <br/>
rubber-banded.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have Pixar stock and the first few years, they sent posters to  <br/>
stockholders, in cool triangular boxes.  We got them laminated.  &lt;g&gt;  With lamination, <br/>
you can use box tape to put them up and get it  off easily.  <br/>
<br/>
Without lamination, I put box tape flat on the back in the corners and  in <br/>
the middle at the top,  Then I put a loop of box tape (so it will stick  to the <br/>
poster and the wall) on that box-taped spot (so I &quot;laminate&quot; just the  part <br/>
I&#39;m going to tape to) and when it&#39;s time to take it down, the spots where  the <br/>
loops were are still clean and the loops of tape go in the trash.<br/>
 <br/>
Or I just tape over the corners, but it&#39;s not as pretty and it&#39;s harder to  <br/>
take down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549498935">LOL!  I&#39;ve read of so many homeschooling and unschooling projects that <br/>
impressed me and I thought this was one of them - I thought you were <br/>
doing your own cartography of the earth and asking for the best way to <br/>
represent a 3 dimensional sphere 2 dimensionally.  As I started writing <br/>
this reply, I Googled just for fun, and found the following website.  <br/>
