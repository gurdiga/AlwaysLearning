<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094106254">My children and I went to see my parents for St. Patrick&#39;s Day.  My <br/>
oldest sister (who has 5 children - all grown except a 10th grader <br/>
that attended public school and is now in a private school) was <br/>
visiting. <br/>
<br/>
 My sister asked how my dd(8) is doing with reading.  Dd is not <br/>
reading well and does not like it at all (I&#39;m sure due to my coercion <br/>
and &quot;schoolish&quot; ways before I discovered unschooling).  I told my <br/>
sister that my dd is not reading well yet, but that I know that when <br/>
she is ready, she will learn.  We discussed this a little and my <br/>
sister wondered how in the world dd could learn to read if I didn&#39;t <br/>
teach her.  I tried to explain that I read all the time to her, that <br/>
we all love to listen to books on tape, that dd reads a little on her <br/>
webkinz site as well as reads some really easy books to her little <br/>
brother.  I mentioned that not all children are ready to read when <br/>
they are 5 or 6 that some children are not ready until they are even <br/>
10 or 12.  <br/>
<br/>
We &quot;discussed&quot; our views on children learning to read (she, of <br/>
course, is very traditional public school minded).  I was so nervous <br/>
because I am still learning myself about unschooling.  I told my <br/>
sister that I am fairly new to unschooling and learning every day.  I <br/>
told her I am learning to trust my dd -- that she will learn to read <br/>
when she is ready.<br/>
<br/>
My mother made a comment, &quot;Why do you think there is so much <br/>
illiteracy in the world?&quot;  They both waited for me to respond, and to <br/>
tell you the truth, I didn&#39;t know WHAT to say!  What I did say <br/>
was, &quot;I haven&#39;t studied about world illiteracy, but I do know that in <br/>
our print-rich society and with a home where reading is valued, <br/>
children can and do learn to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My sister then told me that her son (10th grade) can only read on a <br/>
5th grade level.  She told me all about his struggles with reading <br/>
and how it is affecting all of his school work, how he hates reading, <br/>
etc. etc.  I asked her what kind of experience he had when he was in <br/>
first grade or kindergarten or whatever, and she said in <br/>
kindergarten, the teacher was sick a lot so they had lots of <br/>
different substitutes and all of the kids were in the same boat - <br/>
unable to read.  She said he missed out on the basic phonics stuff so <br/>
now cannot read well.  <br/>
<br/>
Her son is very &quot;strong willed&quot; (her terms) and does not like <br/>
to &quot;conform&quot;.  I asked if maybe he was rebelling against all the <br/>
coercion, bribes, threats, etc.  She just doesn&#39;t see that as a <br/>
possibility.  She and her husband force him to read every day for 15 <br/>
minutes (although I cannot see how they can make him actually read <br/>
the words and not just look at the page) and they withhold all <br/>
his &quot;privileges&quot; such as t.v., video games, friends, etc. until he <br/>
completes his reading assignments.  <br/>
<br/>
She was not open to any ideas but really questioned my decision to <br/>
unschool my dd.  She really did not want my advice, I am thinking.  I <br/>
think she and my mother had been discussing my way of homeschooling <br/>
(my sister had been there at my parents house for several days) and I <br/>
was put into a position to have to defend what I believe to be the <br/>
right way to raise my children.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest sister was always the &quot;smart&quot; one in my family of 12 kids <br/>
and now goes around the U.S. giving seminars to doctors, nurses, and <br/>
WIC employees regarding breastfeeding and the benefits.  She is on <br/>
the road much of the time, and even when she stayed home with her <br/>
children when they were younger, she was always involved in her <br/>
husband&#39;s church activities.  In my opinion, she has probably never <br/>
really spent a lot of time directly interacting with her children.  <br/>
<br/>
During this conversation, I was feeling very unsure of myself, but <br/>
was able to turn the it around to something else not related <br/>
to &quot;school&quot;.  Then another sister showed up (St. Patrick&#39;s Day is a <br/>
big thing in my family!) and she asked if I was still homeschooling.  <br/>
She talked about how she pulled her son from school when he was in <br/>
first grade because the teacher told her that her son could read a <br/>
word -- &quot;monkey&quot; without sounding it out.  She was so upset by this <br/>
(I can&#39;t really understand why, though), that she pulled him out to <br/>
teach him phonics the &quot;correct&quot; way.  She only homeschooled for a <br/>
couple of years and then put her kids in school.  She thinks I am <br/>
doing my dd a disservice to not have a phonics program in place and <br/>
that if I were to get a really good one (&quot;Bob Jones is the best,&quot; she <br/>
declares), dd would be reading in a short while.<br/>
<br/>
Whew.  I&#39;m glad that get-together is over with.  But now I am feeling <br/>
a little discouraged.  How do others handle these kinds <br/>
of &quot;discussions&quot; with family members?  I guess most people think they <br/>
are doing the right thing and that their way of looking at things is <br/>
the best way and so they try to convince others.  It is just <br/>
upsetting that my sisters aren&#39;t really interested in learning about <br/>
other approaches but want me to see their way as being the right and <br/>
best way.<br/>

Next time, ask them if they know any illiterates who have not been to  <br/>
school!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or next time give them a reading assignment or pull up a webpage and  <br/>
tell them you&#39;ll discuss it after they&#39;ve read it.  If they say &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to read it&quot; say &quot;I don&#39;t want to discuss it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, they don&#39;t own you.  You don&#39;t have to take verbal comps  <br/>
when you visit your family.<br/>

WOW.  If your sister came to this list, she might be asked to defend  <br/>

Maybe if she had read to her child as much as you read to yours, he&#39;d  <br/>
be reading better, at the age of 15!<br/>

all kids pick up on different things.  My daughter did NOT get phonics <br/>
at all!  In the times when she saw others around her reading and she <br/>
wasn&#39;t, I told her she could read, but wasn&#39;t yet.  We explored phonics <br/>
here and there, Sesame Street and other kids shows, really focus on it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen phonics work to the detriment of spelling.  My daughter <br/>
started reading books when she was 11 or 12.  She reads mostly on the <br/>
internet, still not much of a book reader, but she&#39;s fast, she can read <br/>
subtitles in movies.<br/>
<br/>
She started to read when she was ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
Something that helped me get over the dire warnings of relatives was <br/>
the fact that not a single one of those public schooled neices and <br/>
nephews read for pleasure.  None of them have even remotely read (or <br/>
listened to) as many books as my daughter that started reading on her <br/>
own at 11ish.  So all those years of forcing those kids to read, was <br/>
pretty much a waste of time in my opinion.  What is the point, if <br/>
reading isn&#39;t valued for anything other than the physical act of <br/>
reading?</div>

If people really want to discuss approaches to teaching reading, it  <br/>

This is a good point to make.   School loves to think they taught all  <br/>

kids hate reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421586538">I&#39;ve only encountered this attitude a little bit.  Alot of the <br/>
reactions are fear.  One guess is that if they admit unschooling is <br/>
logical then their way of schooling must be illogical and therefore <br/>
wrong.  I learned to tell people, including family, that I am as <br/>
confident in my choices as they are in theirs.  They do not want to <br/>
hear why my choices are good for my family but instead want me to <br/>
explain why their choices are not right for my family.  Sometimes I&#39;ve <br/>
had to declare a conversation over and refuse to discuss further.  <br/>
I&#39;ve even totally left a house and asked someone to leave my house <br/>
when I was feeling disrespected.  I am the baby in my family.  It took <br/>
me a very long time to learn that I do not have to gracefully submit <br/>
to those types of interactions.<br/>

&gt; confidence in  her mom&#39;s judgment and pronouncements.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way that I saw it, she could read.  Even a non reading child can <br/>
read.  It wasn&#39;t that she couldn&#39;t read, it was that she hadn&#39;t yet <br/>
started reading fluently.  I don&#39;t know the statistics on how many <br/>
people really literally can&#39;t read because of a physical inability to <br/>
read, but I knew that wasn&#39;t the case with my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
She could read.  Her reading ability came with a gathering of words.  <br/>
She could read various words, even at a very young age.  She didn&#39;t <br/>
have enough of them gathered to string them together.  There were times <br/>
in her life that she wanted me to &quot;teach&quot; her to read because she saw <br/>
others reading and wondered why she wasn&#39;t.  This is how I know phonics <br/>
didn&#39;t make sense to her.<br/>
<br/>
When I really looked at what she was doing, I realized that she indeed <br/>
could read, just not fully real whole sentences, such as you would find <br/>
in a book.<br/>
<br/>
It was a process of adding to what she knew already, that kept getting <br/>
bigger and bigger.  It helped her confindence to know that she could <br/>
read, and that she was getting better and better at it as the days, <br/>
months, years went by.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a magical moment of not being able to read one day, and <br/>
suddenly being able to read the next, even if that is what it looked <br/>
like.  I was many series of moments over many years, and eventually she <br/>
knew enough words to read a book.  That first book that she read, she <br/>
read easily and there were only a few words she didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand how telling a child they can do something when they <br/>
can&#39;t will cause them to lose confidence in a parent.  However, I try <br/>
to focus on really being able to do things.  I think it&#39;s like having <br/>
a &quot;can do&quot; attitude.  So, when my kids say that they can&#39;t do things, I <br/>
tell them they can, but perhaps aren&#39;t for whatever reason that may <br/>
be.  <br/>
<br/>
I really saw that with reading.  Telling her she could read and <br/>
pointing out words that she could read really helped her to feel better <br/>
about not fully reading books like the kids in school all around her <br/>
did.</div>

about when and how and what kids should be doing.  Reading is like that <br/>
in school.  There are so many different kinds of people learning about <br/>
the world in so many different kinds of ways.  Phonics has been touted <br/>
as something big and wonderful that causes all kids to learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it NOT work.  I&#39;ve seen different ways of kids learning how <br/>
to read naturally.  Playing online RPG&#39;s was the single most <br/>
contributing factor to my oldest daughter learning how to read.</div>

Maybe a non-fluent child is still reading a little, but a non-reading  <br/>

<br/>
For others reading here and wondering when to call reading reading, a  <br/>
child who is starting to read a little but not whole sentences is  <br/>
starting to read.   &quot;Starting to read&quot; is like &quot;Starting to walk&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Starting to talk.&quot;  It&#39;s normal and it&#39;s part of a continuum, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not &quot;walking&quot; when a child takes two steps to a couch (it goes  <br/>
on the calendar as first steps, but you don&#39;t stop carrying him  <br/>
around) and it&#39;s not talking the first time a kid says &quot;ama.&quot;  If he  <br/>
can&#39;t tell you a bug bit him or that the house is on fire, he&#39;s not  <br/>
full-on talking.  But he&#39;s starting to talk.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, when my kids say that they can&#39;t do things, I tell them they  <br/>
can, but perhaps aren&#39;t for whatever reason that may be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t get this at all.  It sounds like telling a kid he can  <br/>
ride a bike, and then him wondering why he can&#39;t even get it  <br/>
started.  It seems more cruel and confusing.  What will you say with  <br/>
excitement then when he DOES ride the bike away and keep going?  &quot;I  <br/>
told you so&quot;?<br/>

I much prefer &quot;you will&quot; and &quot;you did,&quot; as communications.<br/>

<br/>
Chamille says that a kid can or can&#39;t ride a bike.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to think about that distinction.  It really has helped me be a <br/>
more confindent person to know that I &quot;can&quot; do almost anything, but I <br/>
may not want to or I may not be able to right now or ever. <br/>
<br/>
I only mention what Chamille says about riding a bike to note that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily see the world in the same way that I do.<br/>

I like to know that I &quot;can&quot; do something.  She likes to see the proof.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994395176">Wow Melissa, you handled yourself well.  For years the common thinking was<br/>
that today&#39;s kids don&#39;t like to read - and then Harry Potter came along and<br/>
blew that theory out of the water.  Some children do learn reading<br/>
differently because the letters look different to them.  I had my daughter<br/>
copy some letters and realized she was reversing several things.  But the<br/>
coercion could certainly be behind your nephews troubles.<br/>
<br/>
I also posted before about a free interactive website called<br/>
www.cafemocha.com that has tutorials for several languages - and people can<br/>
chat with other people from many other countries around the world to improve<br/>
their conversation skills.  Obviously this would have to be closely<br/>
monitored.<br/>

&gt; they are 5 or 6 that some children are not ready until they are even<br/>
&gt; 10 or 12.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We &quot;discussed&quot; our views on children learning to read (she, of<br/>
&gt; course, is very traditional public school minded). I was so nervous<br/>
&gt; because I am still learning myself about unschooling. I told my<br/>
&gt; sister that I am fairly new to unschooling and learning every day. I<br/>
&gt; told her I am learning to trust my dd -- that she will learn to read<br/>
&gt; when she is ready.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My standard response to this question is &quot;just fine&quot; or &quot;exactly where s/he<br/>
needs to be&quot; :D for further inquiry, I&#39;ll add &quot;s/he reads at her/his own<br/>
level and it&#39;s working out great!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My mother made a comment, &quot;Why do you think there is so much<br/>
&gt; illiteracy in the world?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because school is *really good* at fostering a hatred of reading :D Hence<br/>
the very popular bumper sticker &quot;If you don&#39;t want to read this, blame a<br/>
teacher&quot; :::beg:::<br/>
(not to mention folks like my own dad, who was probably a &quot;late&quot; reader and<br/>
was shamed into leaving school at 12 with a horrible attitude about himself<br/>
and his offerings to the world.  His reading skills have VASTLY improved<br/>
since the advent of grandchildren who want to be read to :D )<br/>
<br/>
My sister then told me that her son (10th grade) can only read on a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5th grade level. She told me all about his struggles with reading<br/>
&gt; and how it is affecting all of his school work, how he hates reading,<br/>
&gt; etc. etc. I asked her what kind of experience he had when he was in<br/>
&gt; first grade or kindergarten or whatever, and she said in<br/>
&gt; kindergarten, the teacher was sick a lot so they had lots of<br/>
&gt; different substitutes and all of the kids were in the same boat -<br/>
&gt; unable to read. She said he missed out on the basic phonics stuff so<br/>
&gt; now cannot read well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her son is very &quot;strong willed&quot; (her terms) and does not like<br/>
&gt; to &quot;conform&quot;. I asked if maybe he was rebelling against all the<br/>
&gt; coercion, bribes, threats, etc. She just doesn&#39;t see that as a<br/>
&gt; possibility. She and her husband force him to read every day for 15<br/>
&gt; minutes (although I cannot see how they can make him actually read<br/>
&gt; the words and not just look at the page) and they withhold all<br/>
&gt; his &quot;privileges&quot; such as t.v., video games, friends, etc. until he<br/>
&gt; completes his reading assignments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She was not open to any ideas but really questioned my decision to<br/>
&gt; unschool my dd. She really did not want my advice, I am thinking. I<br/>
&gt; think she and my mother had been discussing my way of homeschooling<br/>
&gt; (my sister had been there at my parents house for several days) and I<br/>
&gt; was put into a position to have to defend what I believe to be the<br/>
&gt; right way to raise my children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s apparent to me, school has done this kid no favors. Nor has his mother.<br/>
She needs to justify the damage she&#39;s caused to her own son by guilting you<br/>
into doing the same to your own.  You may never be able to talk to her about<br/>
it, you&#39;ll have to come to a place of compassion in your heart for her and<br/>
reinforce your commitment *NOT* to do the same things you your babies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My oldest sister was always the &quot;smart&quot; one in my family of 12 kids<br/>
&gt; and now goes around the U.S. giving seminars to doctors, nurses, and<br/>
&gt; WIC employees regarding breastfeeding and the benefits. She is on<br/>
&gt; the road much of the time, and even when she stayed home with her<br/>
&gt; children when they were younger, she was always involved in her<br/>
&gt; husband&#39;s church activities. In my opinion, she has probably never<br/>
&gt; really spent a lot of time directly interacting with her children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I lived in *the smart one* box most of my life with my family. After decades<br/>
of comparisons (why can&#39;t you do it like diana? why can&#39;t you be more like<br/>
diana?) instead of honoring individuality, I find myself in a place where I<br/>
can&#39;t share my wisdom because my siblings (& cousins) are too long in the<br/>
&quot;anything but what diana&#39;s doing&quot; mentality. It&#39;s sad, I hope some of the<br/>
lessons I&#39;ve learned can trickle down to them through channels they&#39;re more<br/>
open to... Until then, I&#39;ve gotta take care of the beings in my charge and<br/>
not worry so much about theirs. AND I&#39;m sure to be the extra-special auntie<br/>
to those kids :D<br/>
<br/>
During this conversation, I was feeling very unsure of myself, but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was able to turn the it around to something else not related<br/>
&gt; to &quot;school&quot;. Then another sister showed up (St. Patrick&#39;s Day is a<br/>
&gt; big thing in my family!) and she asked if I was still homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; She talked about how she pulled her son from school when he was in<br/>
&gt; first grade because the teacher told her that her son could read a<br/>
&gt; word -- &quot;monkey&quot; without sounding it out. She was so upset by this<br/>
&gt; (I can&#39;t really understand why, though), that she pulled him out to<br/>
&gt; teach him phonics the &quot;correct&quot; way. She only homeschooled for a<br/>
&gt; couple of years and then put her kids in school. She thinks I am<br/>
&gt; doing my dd a disservice to not have a phonics program in place and<br/>
&gt; that if I were to get a really good one (&quot;Bob Jones is the best,&quot; she<br/>
&gt; declares), dd would be reading in a short while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, if only we spoke a phonetic language, life would be so easy for all of<br/>
us (says the girl who during the phonics lesson *at school* was told &quot;Every<br/>
time you see -ch- it says CH, like Chimney&quot; and the next day drove past<br/>
Happy CHef and was laughed at by the entire car load -- my mom kept that<br/>
humiliating tale for weeks!! I cried every time she rejoiced at my mistake)<br/>
Bob Jones is really good at selling his books and fostering icky feelings in<br/>
parents and kids world wide -- not so good at creating reading where reading<br/>
is not ready to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Whew. I&#39;m glad that get-together is over with. But now I am feeling<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a little discouraged. How do others handle these kinds<br/>
&gt; of &quot;discussions&quot; with family members?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Your concern is appreciated, your approval is unnecessary&quot;<br/>
A quick (tough not to be snarky though I strive) comment &quot;those are *your*<br/>
choices to make, these are mine&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess most people think they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are doing the right thing and that their way of looking at things is<br/>
&gt; the best way and so they try to convince others. It is just<br/>
&gt; upsetting that my sisters aren&#39;t really interested in learning about<br/>
&gt; other approaches but want me to see their way as being the right and<br/>
&gt; best way.<br/>
&gt; .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want to hold that ideal in my heart to, that most folks think they&#39;re<br/>
doing the right thing... most of the time, however, I find people want me to<br/>
join the &quot;be $hitty to kids club&quot; so they can justify their own membership.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464080162"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My mother made a comment, &quot;Why do you think there is so much <br/>
&gt; illiteracy in the world?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because much of the world is not Westernized and has no need for <br/>
reading perhaps? Because people have found a way to be successful <br/>
without reading? I think you were right in saying &quot;how the heck <br/>
should I know?&quot; (not in those exact words obviously, lol)<br/>
<br/>
My husband is not a very good reader and not very fond of it. He <br/>
started an apprenticeship for carpentry right out of school and just <br/>
recently got promoted to foreman. He is successful by societys <br/>
standards (as well as his own). Occasionally he&#39;ll read some novel <br/>
about guts or gore but rarely. He is not a strong speller either. And <br/>
forget about grammar. But the man can crunch geometry in his head in <br/>
milliseconds. His weaknesses in reading and spelling have made NO <br/>
difference in his life. None whatsoever. I&#39;d imagine your nephew is <br/>
probably really good at something else that your sister may not be <br/>
appreciating as much. Maybe your appreciaton for his talents would be <br/>
appreciated by him?<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; couple of years and then put her kids in school.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found that many people with their own insecurities or those <br/>
who feel as if they failed at something, want others to be on their <br/>
level. They don&#39;t want to see their own failings; they want to blame <br/>
the thing they failed at instead of their own failings. &quot;It couldn&#39;t <br/>
have been me; it must have been homeschooling/the 1st grade <br/>
teacher.my child/etc.&quot; So by you proving it can work really threatens <br/>
them and makes them recognize the real issue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is upsetting but it does seem to be true. I&#39;ve starting putting <br/>
people to my own mental test to see what their agenda is when <br/>
questioning what we do. If they are willing to research, read or ask <br/>
questions and truly try to understand it, then their worries are <br/>
simply out of lack of knowledge, curiousity and/or love for us. If <br/>
they don&#39;t want to research, read or listen, then I assume they just <br/>
want to feel justified in their own actions. They probably feel like <br/>
our choices are an attack on their actions and they don&#39;t want to <br/>
feel threatened, so they go into defense mode. If it&#39;s obviously <br/>
about them and not about my son, then I&#39;m *learning* to let it go of <br/>
the argument/conversation/need to convince them. <br/>
<br/>
For people who don&#39;t want to let it go, I kindly but bluntly say that <br/>
unless they wish to research and read what I have researched and <br/>
read, then the conversation is over.<br/>
<br/>
Then I walk away. Unless I&#39;m in a mood, in which case I&#39;ll counter <br/>
their remarks with snarky comments of my own. :] LOL<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I did in the beginning was to prepare myself for any <br/>
question that might come along and prepare my responses in advance. I <br/>
also made sure I appeared *excited* about what I was <br/>
learning/doing/seeing, instead of quiet or unconfident. It&#39;s harder <br/>
to argue when someone is excited to share info! And if all else <br/>
failed, I&#39;d just say &quot;This is working for us right now. If, in the <br/>
future, we believe it to not work, we can always go back to what we <br/>
used to do. Until then, we&#39;re going to have fun exploring this <br/>
lifestyle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Something else that helped: &quot;The proof is in the pudding.&quot; Z went <br/>
from being a sad, pessimitic, angry little boy (after 2.5 years of <br/>
private school) to becoming a funny, blossoming kid excited for life. <br/>
I think if he had become the &quot;obnoxious, spoiled monster&quot; some people <br/>
seemed to be expecting, my family would be questioning us more now. <br/>
<br/>
My family is very supportive of what I&#39;m doing because they loved us <br/>
enough to try to understand. My in-laws on the other hand...well, <br/>
let&#39;s just say it&#39;s obviously about *them*.<br/>
<br/>
~ Tara<br/>
<br/>
P.S. For being in a very uncomfortable place, kudos on your responses <br/>
and holding your own. With time comes confidence. Keep your eye on <br/>
your daughter, not your sisters or mother. &quot;The proof is in the <br/>
pudding.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787606085">-=-When someone asked if she could read, I didn&#39;t say, &quot;No,&quot; or even,<br/>
&quot;Not yet.&quot; I said, &quot;She&#39;s working on it,&quot; or &quot;She&#39;s getting there,&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Making progress.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I used to say &quot;Holly&#39;s not reading yet,&quot; when she really wasn&#39;t able  <br/>
to read anything when I wasn&#39;t there.  She took a couple of classes  <br/>
that involved reading.  I talked to the teachers about me helping her  <br/>
learn her parts at home, and they were great about it.  In one  <br/>
performance, she knew everyone&#39;s parts, not just hers.<br/>
<br/>
When she was reading better I&#39;d say &quot;She&#39;d reading, but not fluently  <br/>
yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We do a &quot;not yet,&quot; like &quot;She doesn&#39;t like green chile yet&quot; (though  <br/>
she&#39;s eating green chile now).  Then there&#39;s not the assumption that  <br/>
it&#39;s something she will never like, we figure she&#39;ll like it later.<br/>

<br/>
Just for the record, although I probably have mentioned this before -<br/>
My son was in the remedial reading class in his second (and final)<br/>
year at his school. Primarily because he&#39;d learned to hate books. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t believe it, being a huge book reader myself, but, yes, that<br/>
was one of the things my son had learned from two years of school. A<br/>
year after he&#39;d quit, and without the benefit of so much as five<br/>
minutes of a single reading lesson - since he flat out refused to even<br/>
look at a book - his reading was excellent. All he did was play<br/>
videogames. For fun. Developing his reading skills from ingame<br/>
instructions and online walkthroughs was, it seems, a very useful side<br/>
effect. <br/>

---------------------<br/>
We do a &quot;not yet,&quot; like &quot;She doesn&#39;t like green chile yet&quot; (though  <br/>
she&#39;s eating green chile now).  Then there&#39;s not the assumption that  <br/>
it&#39;s something she will never like, we figure she&#39;ll like it later.<br/>

There are  just so many factors, though.  You could be a coach and  <br/>
tell a kid &quot;You can win a gold medal at the Olympics,&quot; but nobody can  <br/>
give that guarantee.  There are other factors at play.<br/>

It&#39;s not obvious to me.<br/>
<br/>
Why, if a child is practicing language (even English) online with  <br/>
people from other countries (or this one) would it need to be closely  <br/>
monitored?<br/>

<br/>
Who should monitor ME closely? Should I monitor my dh closely?<br/>
My children don&#39;t learn in a vacuum. Dh and I and other people of<br/>
varying ages are involved in their lives and helping them make sense<br/>
of this world. But I don&#39;t &quot;closely monitor&quot; anyone I love. I trust<br/>
them more than that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-515159236">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My mother made a comment, &quot;Why do you think there is so much<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; illiteracy in the world?&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there &quot;so much&quot; illiteracy in the world? How much is &quot;so much&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
What does she mean by &quot;world&quot; - the US? English speaking nations? Really the <br/>
whole world?<br/>
<br/>
I suspect it&#39;s a myth that there is &quot;so much&quot; illiteracy.<br/>
<br/>
Does she have the percentage figures at her fingertips? (I know I don&#39;t, but <br/>
if I had a relative going on about it, I would probably make sure I had all <br/>
the info right there.)<br/>
