<div id="ygrps-yiv-101884525">I know there is a reality to perception.  If I think something goofy,  <br/>
it can be true that I think that, without it being objective truth.   <br/>
My mom said plainly that blue and green should never be worn  <br/>
together, and that fish and milk consumed together could kill a  <br/>
person.   It&#39;s true that she thought those things; it&#39;s true that she  <br/>
believed there was something in that.  I&#39;m over fifty years old and  <br/>
have more times that I could count had a fish sandwich and milkshake  <br/>
at the same time, wearing a green t-shirt with jeans.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lifted something from a second hand post from another list.   <br/>
Don&#39;t identify the writer, even if any of you know who it was.  Even  <br/>
if that writer is here, never mind.  Let&#39;s just look at this small bit:<br/>
<br/>
-=-My six year old would eat nothing but sugar if I allowed. Would only<br/>
buying healthy options be considered &quot;controlling?&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
The first part went into the collection here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a> <br/>
ifilet<br/>
<br/>
But the second part is what I really want to look at.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would only buying healthy options be considered &quot;controlling?&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
When people post in a place like this, do we hold them to what they  <br/>
wrote, or slide more toward what they meant?<br/>
If so, toward what they thought they meant, or what they will wish  <br/>
they had meant when they see what they really wrote? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The answer to those questions is &quot;it depends,&quot; I&#39;m sure, and that  <br/>
some will do one and some will do the other.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms (and dads, I will say to be correct, but I don&#39;t ever  <br/>
remember seeing it in a dad&#39;s writings) will ask us what we will  <br/>
think about her possible actions.    if she does X, will we consider  <br/>
it Y+?<br/>
<br/>
If I limit, will all you people consider me to be controlling?<br/>
<br/>
The question might&#39;ve meant to be &quot;Would I have the same  <br/>
disadavantages of &#39;being controlling&#39; if I just don&#39;t buy a bunch of  <br/>
sugary foods?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know there are internal storms when someone is trying to move from  <br/>
one set of practices and assumptions to a whole new way of being and  <br/>
thinking.  It&#39;s not quick or easy.    And I suppose if one&#39;s purpose  <br/>
before was to appease other women (relatives, neighbors, best  <br/>
friends, doctors/nurses/counsellors) their assumption might be that  <br/>
the change will require appeasing a new bunch of women.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t have to really carefully consider WHY they will say &quot;no&quot;  <br/>
to their kids, and swat them, and tell them to go to bed at 8:00.   <br/>
The fact that they can find a magazine article or a book that says  <br/>
&quot;good for you&quot; and that others will commiserate with them about how  <br/>
hard it is to be a mom and how hard kids are.  So it&#39;s possible to  <br/>
please lots of other adults, and do harm to children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we have people like Joyce who can explain SO CLEARLY exactly  <br/>
*why* something could cause longterm harm to relationships and habits  <br/>
and such, so that people here have a much better basis for  <br/>
decisionmaking than what the rest of us will consider their actions  <br/>
to be.<br/>
