<div id="ygrps-yiv-388653500"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;--- My 7 year old treats us family members like doo<br/>
&gt;doo. She talks back, pretends to kick us, slams<br/>
&gt;doors, yells, resists help many times each day... She<br/>
&gt;is great out and about, makes friends easily. As for<br/>
&gt;her home behavior, I&#39;ve had enough of letting her <br/>
&gt;express her feelings. She actually loves to joke too,<br/>
&gt;the silly stuff, which I find sooooo iritating when<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m in need of a simple ok, lets do it, like brush<br/>
&gt;teeth. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with Sandra, your daughter needs more time<br/>
with you.  I have an oppositional and agressive son<br/>
like this.  He is five, and has had the behaviors you<br/>
describe at least since sometime after his brother was<br/>
born.  <br/>
<br/>
Some things we do to help him maintain more control of<br/>
himself and feel less angry:<br/>
Let him sleep in our bed at night (which his brother<br/>
has no interest in doing) so he can cuddle with us.<br/>
Hold him when he is feeling grumpy.<br/>
Since he and my husband both rise early, they spend<br/>
time cuddling in the mornings before breakfast.<br/>
Respond to sibling arguments by offering to play or do<br/>
something with them, or let them choose another<br/>
activityuwhich distracts them from whatever their<br/>
problem was.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes though, when he is just having a<br/>
particularly difficult day, it is overstimulation for<br/>
him.  He is hyperactive and gets that way sometimes,<br/>
or occassionally it may be allergy related, as he has<br/>
a LOT of allergies.  When he just is not fit company<br/>
for other living beings, we ask him to please spend<br/>
some time alone until he feels like being decent to<br/>
people.  This defusing time is sometimes JUST what he<br/>
needs.  We used to enforce his taking time in his<br/>
room, but he has learned how effective this is and<br/>
gives himself time alone when he is feeling really bad<br/>
and let&#39;s no one come in his room.<br/>
<br/>
We also try very hard to model loving,<br/>
non-confrontational, non-agressive problem solving and<br/>
patient and affectionate relations.  Some days I<br/>
marvel at how great he is doing, and other days I am<br/>
crying to myself, marveling at what a rotten mom I<br/>
must be.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really difficult to have these kinds of kids,<br/>
because other people are so judgemental.  They ask you<br/>
things like &quot;Why do you Let him act that way?&quot;  like<br/>
it&#39;s something we encourage in him.  Maybe they would<br/>
rather I screamed and beat on him or something. <br/>
(shrug)  I tend to think that kids like these are just<br/>
REALLY passionate and sensative.  Think what creative<br/>
depths they have!  I am breathlessly waiting to see<br/>
what he does with all this when he is older.  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398806121"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;But I just can&#39;t reconcile that thought of all souls<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe in reincarnation and in the notion that<br/>
souls learn certain lessons in each lifetime, and even<br/>
that some souls are &quot;meant&quot; to be together or are<br/>
drawn to each other.  I am a romantic I suppose.  But<br/>
I DO NOT believe that child souls go shopping for<br/>
families and choose which ones they want.  I will<br/>
never believe that I chose the childhood I got.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662090102"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Personally, I find it possible to live mindfully and <br/>
&gt;in the present, and to also think about that which<br/>
&gt;cannot be proven. I don&#39;t see pondering the<br/>
&gt;imponderables as letting wishfulness guide one&#39;s <br/>
&gt;decisions. But I&#39;m also not out to convince anyone<br/>
&gt;else that I have anything all figured out. My path is<br/>
&gt;mine alone, whether or not someone has joined me <br/>
