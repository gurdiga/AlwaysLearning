I was given that exercise as a kid by my mom or girl scout leader, I forget <br/>

<br/>
That was all well and good but the COOL part was the paper could be stripped <br/>
up along those lines, by folding first or not.<br/>
<br/>
And since then we&#39;ve made perforated two-part tickets for home plays (or just <br/>
for tearing up).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun on the sewing end and fun on the tearing end.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519809207">I love this!  My almost 10 yr old has been &#39;playing&#39; on an old Singer I<br/>
picked up at a yard sale....she&#39;ll absolutely enjoy combining her interest<br/>
in paper shredding and in the sewing machine.<br/>
Susan...who just yesterday found the kidlets playing &quot;paper dolls&quot; - they<br/>
used each others bodies as the dolls and made outfits with cut paper and<br/>
thread.<br/>
