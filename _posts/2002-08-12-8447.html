&gt;When I was younger I would hear someone say, &quot;oh, yuck. That&#39;s just TOO <br/>
&gt;sweet&quot; and I&#39;d think, &quot;What are you--CRAZY--there&#39;s no such thing as TOO <br/>
&gt;sweet.&quot; In my adulthood, though, the concept has developed (although I <br/>
&gt;still have a STRONG sweet tooth) so I think it&#39;s a developmental thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and your taste buds grow and develop over your years, and <br/>
everyone&#39;s taste buds are different.  Some people have more taste buds <br/>
than others, some have more that respond to sweet or bitter, etc. <br/>
 Anyone see that Discover magazine article about taste bud mapping?<br/>
