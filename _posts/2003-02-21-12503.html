 </span></blockquote>Years ago, when we lived in Okinawa, if I didn&#39;t understand what my maid was <br/>
saying to me in her &quot;English&quot;, she would continue to repeat it L <br/>
-O-U-D-E-R!!!  I guess she thought my lack of understanding was deafness!  <br/>
:-)  Actually, she didn&#39;t have the vocabulary to offer another choice to me.  <br/>
We would have long conversations, but I was never really sure if we were <br/>
understanding each other at all.  It was fun.<br/>
