And a lovely photo it is, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay this is embarrassing! For some reason I can&#39;t get back onto the yahoo <br/>
site. I don&#39;t don&#39;t know how I managed to sign onto this list, becasue now <br/>
when I type in my Yahoo ID, it tells me it&#39;s been deleted for some <br/>
infraction of the rules. Huh? Me?<br/>
<br/>
Wahh!!! I really want to see everyone&#39;s pictures. :-( Any suggestions?<br/>

Make a new one?  <br/>
Mine got messed up once when they changed to yahoo from whatever-groups, and <br/>
that&#39;s why I show as DuckfordU instead of SandraDodd.  It&#39;s frustrating.  I&#39;m <br/>
really sorry.  If I could make a secret back door to the site I would.<br/>

spiritual/unschooling sense, I tricked the Yahoo demons by signing in as <br/>
DoddGoddess. That did the trick. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW Everyone&#39;s family is gorgeous. If I can figure out how, I&#39;ll load one of <br/>
us.<br/>

<br/>
There are two other photos there already!<br/>
<br/>
People, walk softly in there--it&#39;s easy to delete them, and I personally had <br/>
to work hard to get mine in there!  I wish I&#39;d used the better picture--same <br/>
general pose, but Holly has her arms folded and is smiling hugely.  She <br/>
steals the picture in that one--it&#39;s like Holly and her backup singers, I <br/>
say, and all who see it say YES IT IS while Holly says, &quot;MOM, don&#39;t say <br/>
that.&quot;  She&#39;s a scene-stealer ordinarly, so you get to see the one where <br/>
she&#39;s least flashy.   <br/>
<br/>
I hope it doesn&#39;t disturb others too much that I have a bald kid.  It used to <br/>
disturb me, but now he&#39;s just Marty.  As of a week ago, he&#39;s shaving his own <br/>
head instead of talking me into doing it every week or so.  And he shaved his <br/>
&quot;moustachal area&quot; although there wasn&#39;t much there.  Kirby is shaving.  Keith <br/>
was no role model for them there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>why would it, or should it, disturb us?  I<br/>
found it amusing that you have one with<br/>
wonderful long hair and another bald.  I was<br/>
glad to read it was a &quot;natural&quot; baldness and<br/>
not one inflicted by other more horrible<br/>
means.<br/>

To hell with what others think! He&#39;s beautiful because<br/>
he&#39;s Marty and he&#39;s special! And he&#39;s allowed to be<br/>
how HE feels the most comfortable.<br/>
