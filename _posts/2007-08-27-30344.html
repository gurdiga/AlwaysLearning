<div id="ygrps-yiv-125370347">You don&#39;t need to think of &quot;math&quot; games - just play games she likes.  <br/>
We can&#39;t really tell what she&#39;ll enjoy, what she&#39;s ready for, but if  <br/>
she likes it, that&#39;s your sign that it is appropriate for her. Board  <br/>
games such as Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders are great for young  <br/>
kids. Strategy games like tic-tac-toe are great (more sophisticated  <br/>
ones - Pente or Othello, Card games such as &quot;War&quot; or variations of it  <br/>
are often enjoyed. If you are just looking for new ideas of games to  <br/>
have fun with, I have a some of them here:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve got to figure out how to update that site - I don&#39;t have the  <br/>
software, anymore, to do it. But, there are lots of simple games I  <br/>
put there a long time ago and they&#39;re still there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195091937">blink is a card game where you play cards onto the piles if they match <br/>
color, number or shape, and go as fast as you can to get rid of all your <br/>
cards. you can even it out by the adult or older player starting with a <br/>
bigger pile. my 5 year old has enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
my son loves to count things, so that happens often. i&#39;m not so good at <br/>
estimating, so we play with that together, and sometimes he&#39;s actually <br/>
closer than me.<br/>
<br/>
i love math, and so i talk often about things that are somehow mathematical. <br/>
if you&#39;re uncomfortable with math, it&#39;s hard to know how to bring it into <br/>
your life in a natural way.<br/>

Zoombinis, a computer game that&#39;s only $12.99 now.  (Some of us paid  <br/>
quite a bit more, when it was new!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re not talking to your six year old about math, or telling  <br/>
her these are math games.<br/>
<br/>
Very often with unschooling the best thing that can happen is for the  <br/>
parent to see the math all around--in patterns and shapes and weights  <br/>
and measurements and money and music and art and....     but if  <br/>
anyone reading that is thinking of looking for addition and  <br/>
subtraction in all those things, more deschooling would be very good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97185412">Here&#39;s another place to get Zoombinis on the cheap:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.softwareoutlet.com/">http://www.softwareoutlet.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
$3.01 and that&#39;s for new!<br/>
<br/>
My boys have really enjoyed Zoombinis as well as Infinity City,  <br/>
Starflyers, Math Missions, How Many Bugs in a Box, and many more.  I  <br/>
went a little crazy buying cheap, game-oriented, educational software  <br/>
a couple of years ago.  Some were duds, but some were really great  <br/>
fun.  Besides softwareoutlet, I have also purchased from:<br/>

<br/>
There was another place too that would send &quot;free&quot; software for the  <br/>
price of s&h, but I can&#39;t find the link right now.  It was e-smart  <br/>
store or smart e-store......something like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462000776">Hi!<br/>
I have not caught up with all the posts on this thread.  At the risk <br/>
of being redundant, I want to mention that many computer and video <br/>
games are full of math concepts.  Both of my children have learned <br/>
lots of math and other great benefits from computer and video <br/>
games.  Zoombinis is one that they have used. Some of our other <br/>
favorites are anything from Humongous Entertainment(many focus on <br/>
logic and problem solving, but their arcade games tend to have more <br/>
mathmatical concepts)  There are also some more *educational* <br/>
titles, like the &quot;Jumpstart&quot; series, and Edmark titles.  <br/>
<br/>
Other great ways to play with math are by cooking together, building <br/>
things together (tools, measuring, etc.) playing with blocks of <br/>
various shapes and sizes (geoblocks are really nice),etc.  All of <br/>
these are things that can be accessable to and involving of a wide <br/>
age range, and can grow and change with the child&#39;s abilities and <br/>
interests.  Something that I used to do when my children were <br/>
younger was to keep small measuring tapes in my purse, one for each <br/>
child, the kind that retract easily.  Whenever we were shopping, or <br/>
out and about, they had the option of taking out the measuring tape <br/>
to &#39;measure&#39; things while I did the boring shopping (though <br/>
involving them in shopping decisions has lots of math - my kids <br/>
loved to measure produce for me when they were younger - 3yo and up)<br/>
<br/>
The lovely thing about using various games and life experiences for <br/>
learning is that there is a broader focus; it is not just *math* <br/>
that is focused on, but lots of things are being learned while <br/>
having fun.  The key is that whatever is done should be fun for the <br/>
child, rather than chosen by the parent for the child.<br/>
<br/>
Six years old is still quite young.  So much learing has happened, <br/>
without &#39;formal&#39; instruction.  Play is an important part of learning <br/>
throughout life, but most especially with a young child.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.<br/>

<br/>
It might seem unimportant, but the difference between thinking that a  <br/>
child is &quot;using&quot; a computer game (to learn math, it seemed, in one  <br/>
post) and thinking of a child as PLAYING a computer game can make the  <br/>
difference between not getting unschooling and really relaxing fully  <br/>
into it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; loved to measure produce for me when they were younger - 3yo and up)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I intended to say *weigh* the produce.  The same thing, yet <br/>
different.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids (13yo and 11yo) are currently really into Webkinz, and I am <br/>
realizing that there is lots of math involved in it.  I find that math <br/>
is part of so much of everyday life, which makes sense; if we did not <br/>
need and use it, then why would we need to learn it?  Many things that <br/>
kids naturally enjoy have elements of math to them, along with <br/>
elements of so many other things...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355998228">Last night on a long drive, Hayden was figuring out a mathematical quandry<br/>
without much of our help and *gasp* without paper, pencil nor calculator!!<br/>
<br/>
How far do we go in an hour? --a whole side discussion of average<br/>
speed/distance<br/>
What is the distance from here to there?<br/>
How many miles per gallon? --average<br/>
How much per gallon? --again with the averages!<br/>
<br/>
He was able to just whip the numbers around and find new relationships (to<br/>
me!) and solutions to his ultimate questions (how much does it cost, really,<br/>
to get to my friend&#39;s house & back?? and How long would I have to save my<br/>
money to fund it?? --Approximately $20 each way and easily obtainable<br/>
through two months of saving allowance)<br/>
<br/>
The voices in my head were SO busy reminding me &quot;this is why I hate story<br/>
problems,&quot; I almost missed his magic! There were no struggles to understand<br/>
a foreign formula and decide/guess which numbers go where... just raw<br/>
information and a deep drive to work out an answer to his questions!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a great story to share, Diana!  You reminded me that my dd often <br/>
does the same thing, making sense of the world.  Our quandries and <br/>
discussions often happen while in the car, going various places.  <br/>
<br/>
Your example with Hayden shows how many variables there often are <br/>
in &#39;real world&#39; mathmatical equations, which often come up the <br/>
conversations with my kids. So different from what I dealt with in <br/>
school, where there are specific and set details, without <br/>
consideration for multiple influences.  I think that part of why I did <br/>
so poorly on word problems in school was that I used to argue, &quot;yes, <br/>
but what if...&quot;  or &quot;that does not make sense, it would not really <br/>
happen that way in real life!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
