<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333853070">I am wondering how you all explain sharing to your children<br/>
<br/>
I started pretty early on sharing prosperity principles with him.  I come<br/>
from the perspective that the universe is abundant.  I have shared my belief<br/>
with Alex that we will always have more than enough and will always have<br/>
plenty to share.  I also discouraged grabbing and taught him to ask politely<br/>
if he wanted to play with someone&#39;s toy.  They have the right to say no as<br/>
he does.  Sharing is a joyful experience and there is no reason a child<br/>
should feel it is about lack or a negative.  I have never been fond of<br/>
greedy adults and I think it starts early from a false belief system that<br/>
there is not enough.  Anyway, that is how I deal with it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Be generous in prosperity&quot; is a little snippet from a longer Baha&#39;i <br/>
writing...it has come up in our house many times in the context of <br/>
&quot;sharing&quot; - I also like to try to be focusing more on the good feeling <br/>
of being able to share than the deprived feeling of having to share. <br/>
Making kids share when they don&#39;t want to defeats the purpose, for me, <br/>
of them developing a generous spirit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the whole thing (because I know somebody will ask):<br/>
<br/>
  Be generous in prosperity,<br/>
  and thankful in adversity.<br/>
  Be fair in judgement,<br/>
  and guarded in thy speech,<br/>
  Be a lamp unto those who walk<br/>
  in darkness, and a home<br/>
  to the stranger.<br/>
  Be eyes to the blind, and a guiding light<br/>
  unto the feet of the erring<br/>
  Be a breath of life to the body of<br/>
  humankind, a dew to the soil of<br/>
  the human heart,<br/>
  and a fruit upon the tree of humility.</div>
