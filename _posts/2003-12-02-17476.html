<div id="ygrps-yiv-516849127">Argh, my first post to Always Learning and I duplicate a previous post!<br/>
Sorry all, my excuse is that I am on digest and did not see either post<br/>
until this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am Camille, we live in NW Indiana (about 40 minutes from Chicago)<br/>
and I have one son, Andy, who is 10.  I have been on the list for a while,<br/>
but have just been lurking.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to &quot;talking&quot; with you folks.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, Camille</div>
