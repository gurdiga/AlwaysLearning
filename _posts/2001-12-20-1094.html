<div id="ygrps-yiv-214929555">Megan has told me a number of times that she wants a magic wand that<br/>
will take her to the places that she has imagined.  She&#39;s 6 so magic<br/>
is real for her still.  I&#39;m wondering what to do - what to get her<br/>
since she wants this for Christmas.  She will be getting a wand but<br/>
unfortunately it won&#39;t have that magic power.  I had thought about<br/>
giving her a nice journal and a decorated pen so we could write down<br/>
her stories about the imaginary places she&#39;s created and tell her that<br/>
the best way to visit those wonderful places is by reading and writing<br/>
about them.  Does this sound okay?  Does anyone have any other ideas?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well, in my opinion, we don&#39;t know where we &quot;travel&quot; to in dream time. . . I <br/>
always like to leave open the possibilty for magic. One of my best friends <br/>
could move objects to her when she was a child. . . she could look at a ball <br/>
or other object across the room and have it come to her. . . she also &quot;knew&quot; <br/>
things that were not explainable to her parents. In a well meaning way, they <br/>
took her to the local priest who recommended a psychologist, who put her on <br/>
thorazine. She lost her abilities. . . anyway, my long winded point is that <br/>
let her imagination be, and foster the magical.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292373461">Maybe a collection of other people&#39;s fantasy places--Dinotopia is a beautiful <br/>
one.<br/>
There&#39;s a new illustrated Hobbit out that&#39;s beautiful--written in comic-book <br/>

I never liked maps as a kid ( and I never knew where I was either). Now I <br/>
love them. In books like The Hobbit, I am always referring back to the map.  <br/>
One of the things I liked about the movie was the maps they show were just <br/>
the same ones in the book.<br/>

Cindy,<br/>
I think the journal is a great idea. You could also<br/>
supplement the journel with &#39;trips&#39; to places after<br/>
she has written about them. We do this a lot. We get<br/>
very detailed about the place (real or fictional).<br/>
Like weather, foods, language, money, customs,<br/>
religion, animals, types of *beings*, etc. Sometimes<br/>
we &#39;stay&#39; in a place for a week or two (boy, can that<br/>
get confusing - to the rest of the world!). We really<br/>
go for it and make the money, food (or an edible<br/>
version thereof), clothing (Once I walked around for a<br/>
week with my clothes on backwards! I&#39;m sure people<br/>
thought I was &#39;unbalanced&#39;), decorate the house, and<br/>
what ever else we can think of. It&#39;s so much fun. I<br/>
highly recommend it! You could get the wand thing in<br/>
there by waving it and reciting a *spell* before you<br/>
go somewhere. It might help to make it more magical to<br/>
do some of the prep work before you *go*. Have fun!<br/>

has  a magic wand(s), and a red silk cape. He wears a<br/>
helmet liner to keep his LONG hair out of his face. He<br/>
also wears his Cherokee ribbon shirt a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Magic is the capacity to See.  If Megan Sees the<br/>
places she imagines, then that is the magic.  The<br/>
wands merely help with focus.  Like crystals, pointy<br/>
fingers, or other focusing helpers. If she can use<br/>
this focus to help her gain the capacity to travel,<br/>
via whatever route (growing up?), then she has<br/>
achieved true magic.  She can make her own wand from<br/>
anything that feels right to her.  As a child I used<br/>
willow fronds, bamboo, car antenna, and well, all<br/>
sorts of things.  To the end I attached gauze, stars,<br/>
grass, feathers, bells, rattles, whatever fit the<br/>
culture I was projecting......<br/>
<br/>
Being unschoolers we have the freedom to use MIXED<br/>
MEDIA...that is whatever we like that feels right.<br/>

<br/>
I took my boys for a walk in a semi-wooded area and<br/>
they each picked a stick for their wand.  Then we got<br/>
some crystals and gold wire (dragon heart string).  We<br/>
still have to assemble the wands.<br/>
I would also recomend a book...The Book of Wizard<br/>
Craft.  Really fun ideas of crafts for kids.  <br/>
Does she like to draw?  Maybe some parchment paper to<br/>
draw maps on of the places.  <br/>

Tamzin just got that book for Solstice! It&#39;s amazing!<br/>
We just recently made wands similar to the ones you<br/>
describe (I&#39;m assuming your using the book for your<br/>
inspiration). Just to let you know we experimented<br/>
with several different kinds of glue. The best one by<br/>
far for gluing crystals to wood was Goop (we got it at<br/>
Michael&#39;s craft shop). It dries hard and completely<br/>
clear. Tamzin&#39;s wand has gone through a lot and is<br/>
still holding up well. Enjoy your wand making<br/>
experience!<br/>
