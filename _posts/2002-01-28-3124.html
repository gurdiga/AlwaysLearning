Are you sure that&#39;s not 175 days, not 275?   275 doesn&#39;t even leave weekends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it was a typo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692313923">I hope it is a typo because that is the law in North Carolina as well.  I <br/>
just about died!!  I&#39;m thinking I will have to try to talk to someone on the <br/>
phone for clarification.  And why would hs-ers have 275 when ps-ers have 180 <br/>
(or something like that)???  WEIRD!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But you know what, I would have no problem filling out their form saying I <br/>
would do 275 days. From an unschooling perpective, we&#39;re *on* 24/7, 365 days <br/>
a year. I don&#39;t care if it looks like school to them. It&#39;s not supposed to <br/>
look like school. My kids are learning and I can justify whatever arbitrary <br/>
amount they come up with.<br/>

be optional.<br/>
