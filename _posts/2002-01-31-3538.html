My other favorite T-shirt vendor is Landover Baptist Church (online parody -<br/>
snerk!) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org/store.html">http://www.landoverbaptist.org/store.html</a><br/>
You can get one that reads &quot;unsaved&quot; in huge letters :-)  Or &quot;I&#39;ve got a<br/>
heart on for Jesus,&quot; &quot;Get your ass to church,&quot; &quot;Hellbound Liberal,&quot; and, of<br/>
course, &quot;homeskooled.&quot;  Oh, and don&#39;t forget &quot;Love the Sinner, Hate their<br/>
Clothes.&quot; &lt;ggg&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
For those who might have been offended by the foregoing paragraph, don&#39;t go <br/>
to the next site [repeat warning--the following site is not for the easily <br/>
offended]:<br/>

Density Church  (out of New Zealand)<br/>
<br/>
Some people look at the site and don&#39;t know it&#39;s a parody.  Even, I guess, <br/>
when they come to the &quot;e-mail Jesus&quot; link.<br/>
<br/>
Sample:<br/>
<br/>
Pastor Brian Tamariki Demands<br/>
Flat-Earthism be Taught in Schools<br/>
Pastor Brian Tamariki of Density Christian Life Community Fellowship issued a <br/>
demand to the Minister of Education that the &quot;Science of Flat-Earthism, as <br/>
taught by the Bible, should be taught in all Secondary School science classes <br/>
in New Zealand&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pastor Urges Return to Biblical Morality: &quot;Let&#39;s Bring Back Slavery!&quot;<br/>
Pastor Brian Tamariki, of Auckland&#39;s Density Christian Life Community <br/>
Fellowship, is leading a campaign to bring back Slavery...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the quotes are for real (the Biblical citations, I mean), and the <br/>
question/answer section is a hoot.  Whether to wear boxers or briefs--all <br/>
Biblically sound theology.  <br/>
