<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409269875">He is 5.  His sisters are 3 and 7.  <br/>
This just happened:  We were all hanging out in the living room (the kids and I, Dad is at work).  We were all talking about our plans for the afternoon and various other things.  Nothing stressful.  Just chatting.  He suddenly started to make this funny noise (a very common noise for him in various situations, I don&#39;t see any common thread for when this noise happens).  He then snatched his special blanket out from under his sister and tried to whack her with it.  She felt unsafe even though it wouldn&#39;t have hurt.  Given the frequency of this sort of thing with various items I don&#39;t blame her.  This time I told him that she was feeling unsafe.  He didn&#39;t budge.  She still felt unsafe.  I said that we would put the blanket away if it was going to be a problem.  He did stop but that&#39;s not always how it ends.  More often than not I feel like I have to physically restrain him.  I don&#39;t, though, because it doesn&#39;t feel right.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
 removing the child who feels unsafe like Sandra suggests.  This often turns into him following us and trying to hurt us both.  This, too, feels wrong.<br/>
My husband is wonderful and supportive and my son&#39;s favorite person.  He thinks that what my son needs is to know that I&#39;m in charge in these sorts of scenarios.  That in the most gentle way I can he needs to know that I am strong and in charge.  We are still sort of in the midst of the conversation (emails while my husband is at work) so I&#39;m not clear about how he thinks I should do this.  <br/>
When my husband is around he removes my son and then makes him laugh in one way or another.  This changes the whole atmosphere for my son.  It takes him a minute to switch gears but it works and his anger dissipates.  This method doesn&#39;t work for me, though.  My son gets VERY offended when I try to make him laugh and it makes him more angry.  I feel like he doesn&#39;t feel like I truly understand him.  Whereas, with my husband, my son takes for granted that he does.  I think it&#39;s a gender thing.  I don&#39;t know what I can do about that.  I make sure that we do active, physical things together multiple times a day.  I make time for us to connect as often as possible.<br/>
My husband and I have talked about the possibility of him staying home more often to be there for our son.  While this would work I don&#39;t see this as a solution.  My son and I still have a disconnect that I&#39;m having a hard time mending.<br/>
My son is the only boy in a house full of girls during the day.  I know it&#39;s really hard for him a lot of the so I am mindful of that and make sure we do boy stuff together.  He still has this residual frustration about it, though.  I make sure he has regular play dates with friends who are boys, too.<br/>
I hope I managed to write that with some clarity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832340491">I bought some foam swords when Karl was 4 and he swung those around a<br/>
lot at things (outside if I could get him to since the house is small<br/>
and swords at that age could reach our short ceilinged fans. I got him<br/>
some &quot;sabers&quot; that have electronic sounds. I got oobleck so he could<br/>
make wonderful fun &quot;bad&quot; messes. Brian got him some foam Hulk hands<br/>
(Walmart I think) that make a great noise when you hit something with<br/>
them. I showed him how to throw those blinking light up neon balls<br/>
with suckers all over them (don&#39;t know the name of them) at the walls.<br/>
They stick for a few seconds before falling to the floor. We got a<br/>
Transformer mask that says &quot;the Decepticons must be stopped&quot; and other<br/>
things, and has a separate button to press for a voice changing<br/>
filter.  I totally envied him all those action oriented toys and would<br/>
have loved to have had them when I was a small kid. Dolls weren&#39;t my<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t necessarily talk about nonaggression as the acceptable<br/>
(only?) option. Play with the children yourself. And maybe the girls<br/>
will decide they like it at some point and join in. It IS physical and<br/>
likely to devolve occasionally into aggressive behavior since the<br/>
children may lack the tools for getting along during physical play.<br/>
Your own behavior while playing with them can set the tone and over<br/>
time, they&#39;ll get the idea. And when it gets out of hand, notice how<br/>
and when aggression is cropping up. Then you can decide better what to<br/>
do when you have more specifics to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
I have an only child and what you described about your son is just as<br/>
true of my child. It would be easy to label him &quot;bad&quot; if I didn&#39;t know<br/>
about the needs of different people for large muscle movement. I just<br/>
heard something yesterday from a retired teacher who said every few<br/>
minutes, to keep the kids from getting rowdy, it was necessary to<br/>
break up whatever they were doing and suggest the kids stretch or do<br/>
some other movement. She says the growth of muscles (I think that&#39;s<br/>
it) causes gas bubbles to form and get stuck. They&#39;re uncomfortable.<br/>
She also mentioned that fear creates a sudden need for lots of<br/>
movement and children worry about stuff just like everyone else. *I*<br/>
have to move when I worry. Sitting does me no good. She had 4 and 5<br/>
year olds and said the same thing works well with older kids and even<br/>
with adults. :) Some people don&#39;t need as much movement or interaction<br/>
and others just do. People are different.<br/>

<h4>Sandra Dodd</h4>
<time>10 Sep 2010, at 12:20pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983835747">-=- I&#39;ve been<br/>
removing the child who feels unsafe like Sandra suggests.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t suggested that.<br/>
If you were all just hanging around, and the girl wasn&#39;t involved in  <br/>
an altercation, and you had said &quot;she feels unsafe,&quot; that&#39;s not the  <br/>
kind of situation I&#39;ve discussed when I talk about rescuing the kid  <br/>
who&#39;s losing, because he wants to be rescued.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She feels unsafe&quot;?  Is that a quote?<br/>
It seems distant to me, not direct, normal communication. It sounds  <br/>
stilted.<br/>
The problem with that is if he feels you&#39;re reciting a script instead  <br/>
of addressing him in that moment, that might make him angrier.<br/>
<br/>
I would be more likely to say &quot;If you want the blanket ask for it next  <br/>
time, and walk him and the blanket to the other room and ask him what  <br/>
his problem is.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I said that we would put the blanket away if it was going to be a  <br/>
problem.  He did stop but that&#39;s not always how it ends. -=-<br/>
<br/>
But if it ends more often than it used to, that&#39;s progress.  &quot;Not  <br/>
always&quot; isn&#39;t a good measure of whether it&#39;s getting better or worse.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t grab&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t hit&quot; seem better than &quot;your sister is feeling  <br/>
unsafe,&quot; to me.<br/>
But &quot;If you want it, get her a different blanket&quot; might be an option,  <br/>
and &quot;If you want to hit something, go hit a tree&quot; (not in a &quot;what a  <br/>
good idea&quot; way but in a &quot;Don&#39;t hit people&quot; way) might help-- <br/>
acknowledge that he&#39;s hitting something, and let him consider for an  <br/>
instant whether  he &quot;wants to hit something.&quot;  You&#39;re not saying  <br/>
&quot;Never hit anything in the world,&quot; it&#39;s &quot;you&#39;re hitting the wrong  <br/>
thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=He thinks that what my son needs is to know that I&#39;m in charge in  <br/>
these sorts of scenarios.  That in the most gentle way I can he needs  <br/>
to know that I am strong and in charge.  We are still sort of in the  <br/>
midst of the conversation (emails while my husband is at work) so I&#39;m  <br/>
not clear about how he thinks I should do this.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sharp voice and direct eye contact are normal mammal behavior and  <br/>
don&#39;t involve hitting.<br/>
A loud, quick &quot;STOP IT&quot; is time-honored and works with people, dogs  <br/>
and cats.<br/>
<br/>
-= My son gets VERY offended when I try to make him laugh and it makes  <br/>
him more angry.  I feel like he doesn&#39;t feel like I truly understand  <br/>
him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that too, though, just from the way you&#39;ve written  <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  I don&#39;t know what I can do about that.  I make sure that we do  <br/>
active, physical things together multiple times a day. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Find other boys.  Not boys his age.  An older boy.  Or even an older  <br/>
girl, older than his sister, who will take him to the park or throw  <br/>
balls with him or play a little rougher.  Maybe this older kid could  <br/>
help him learn to roller blade or skateboard.  Holly&#39;s been doing  <br/>
those things with an eight year old girl she&#39;s taking care of.  (Well,  <br/>
ice skating last week, and skateboarding.)  It would be less expensive  <br/>
to pay a young teen to create some adventures for him than for your  <br/>
husband to work fewer hours.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We were all hanging out in the living room (the kids and I, Dad is  <br/>
at work)....  My son is the only boy in a house full of girls during  <br/>
the day.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you stuck in the house without a car?<br/>
My kids often got along better away from the house than in it, when  <br/>
they were little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813808">I don&#39;t think being charge (even tho you are in charge) is what he&#39;s<br/>
looking for. Kids don&#39;t care that much about exactly WHO is in charge.<br/>
Do you really think he&#39;s doing x to find out who&#39;s in charge?? It<br/>
could be that your son just wants closeness and will follow when<br/>
someone leads so as to have someone to hang out with? and that&#39;s the<br/>
dynamic between father and son? Maybe he doesn&#39;t have enough to do<br/>
that&#39;s of interest to him? Maybe he&#39;s hungry and maybe the food isn&#39;t<br/>
coming fast enough to meet the needs of growth spurts (that would<br/>
catch me unawares with Karl).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve been removing the child who feels unsafe like Sandra suggests.  This often turns into him following us and trying to hurt us both.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is he REALLY *trying* to hurt anyone? Maybe that&#39;s what ends up<br/>
happening. The results you get may not be what your child was after at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
If someone was sitting on MY special blanket, and I didn&#39;t feel<br/>
comfortable asking for it, I might have behaved the same way at that<br/>
age. Not meaning to hurt anything or anyone. It might not have been<br/>
the best way to get his blanket out from under someone but how would<br/>
taking the blanket away do anything for the situation? It looks like<br/>
he wanted his blanket.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;We were all talking about our plans for the afternoon and various other things.  Nothing stressful.  Just chatting.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like an adult perspective. I always had a hard time when<br/>
plans were swirling in the air around my head being discussed by<br/>
others and I couldn&#39;t keep up or participate very well or at all. I<br/>
got bored with it fast. Boredom and feeling out of the loop is<br/>
stressful. Maybe this is what is happening with your son.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;She felt unsafe even though it wouldn&#39;t have hurt.  Given the frequency of this sort of thing with various items I don&#39;t blame her.  This time I told him that she was feeling unsafe.  He didn&#39;t budge.  She still felt unsafe.  I said that we would put the blanket away if it was going to be a problem.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this your conversation with your son? If it all came from you, I am<br/>
left wondering if you&#39;re right. Talking about other people&#39;s feelings<br/>
as though they&#39;re that obvious seems funny to me. If you just said<br/>
there&#39;s a better way to get the blanket (to ask for it) then that<br/>
would be much more informative and helpful to a child who isn&#39;t versed<br/>
in better ways to get blankets out from under someone than grabbing<br/>
it. Sometimes there are better ways to help children get what they<br/>
want and need than talking about someone&#39;s feelings. At 5, a child has<br/>
little ability to focus on abstracts like feelings.<br/>

make sure it&#39;s easily available to him (i.e. not under his little  <br/>
sister).  With a kid whose temperament means he/she goes from 0 to 60,  <br/>
being proactive in these kinds of situations is key to averting the  <br/>
scenario you described.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;funny noise&quot; might be his all-of-a-sudden realization that things  <br/>
are not going in his favor. His expression of &quot;oh no!&quot; in other words,  <br/>
followed by immediate action.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the 0-60 happens if a child is needing protein or a drink or  <br/>
sleep or attention. Sometimes it happens due to external situations,  <br/>
but is exacerbated by lack of those things. And other times, it&#39;s hard  <br/>
to know. But being your child&#39;s partner is about figuring that out.<br/>
<br/>
What you wrote about his relationship with your husband and his with  <br/>
you leads me to believe that you might not be thinking of him as  <br/>
needing attention *because* he&#39;s a boy.  Doing &quot;physical stuff&quot; is  <br/>
great, but are you seeing him as a person with needs for closeness,  <br/>
for specialness? He gets that focused attention from dad, but it seems  <br/>
he might need more from you, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258638860">also - your very first sentence labeled your son negatively, rather than just discussing one aspect of his actions for which you are seeking support  - you said :<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I am having a difficult time meeting my aggressive son where he is &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest trying to think of him in all the ways he is - beyond and other than being sometimes aggressive<br/>
<br/>
then you said:<br/>
&quot; I am having trouble showing him ways to express himself in other ways while keeping his siblings safe. I see it happening over and over again that he feels like the &quot;bad&quot; guy&quot;<br/>
<br/>
he feels like the bad guy, in part, because you think of him as your &quot;aggressive son&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 would say compassion and empathy for the unmet needs HE has that are resulting in his aggressive actions, and prevention prevention prevention.  once he feels his emotional &quot; cup&quot; is abundantly full  with understanding and protection from his own impulses, he will have space in his own brain to absorb alternative actions when things go awry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772401029">-=-I don&#39;t think being charge (even tho you are in charge) is what he&#39;s<br/>
looking for. Kids don&#39;t care that much about exactly WHO is in charge.- <br/>
=-<br/>
<br/>
Even if he doesn&#39;t care, his sisters might appreciate the  <br/>
clarification that someone IS in charge, and it&#39;s not the brother.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It<br/>
could be that your son just wants closeness and will follow when<br/>
someone leads so as to have someone to hang out with? and that&#39;s the<br/>
dynamic between father and son? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Heck, *I* like to follow someone who&#39;s leading in good and interesting  <br/>
directions.  And when I accept someone else&#39;s lead, that person is in  <br/>
charge, in that instance, and there&#39;s comfort in that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;just hanging out&quot; is the problem.  Be DOING something, maybe  <br/>
have two things going on in the room, neither required, but so that  <br/>
there are interesting options.   I don&#39;t think ANY little boys are  <br/>
good at just sitting in a room with girls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547398140">***We were all hanging out in the living room (the kids and I, Dad is at work). <br/>
 We were all talking about our plans for the afternoon and various other things. <br/>
 Nothing stressful.  Just chatting.  He suddenly started to make this funny <br/>
noise (a very common noise for him in various situations, I don&#39;t see any common <br/>
thread for when this noise happens).  He then snatched his special blanket out <br/>
from under his sister and tried to whack her with it.  She felt unsafe even <br/>
though it wouldn&#39;t have hurt. ***<br/>
<br/>
As an outsider looking in, what I saw in that description, even before you <br/>
explained further, was a gender divide as well as a middle child issue.  First, <br/>
why was someone sitting on his special blanket?  That may seem like a small <br/>
thing, but it could be a symptom of something bigger of the siblings around him <br/>
not being very mindful of him.   That&#39;s not necessarily something that a sibling <br/>
may see or prevent, but a parent could.  If everyone is sitting down to talk, <br/>
make sure that nobody is sitting on anyone else&#39;s special anything as they sit <br/>
down.  Make sure that this boy has his space and things in a way that no sisters <br/>
can interfere, even unintentionally.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, along the way the sister have felt unsafe around their brother even <br/>
when they really aren&#39;t unsafe.  I would ask them to stop over dramatizing the <br/>
situation.  In the scenario given, without knowing all the subtle nuances, I <br/>
would have been very direct in saying, &quot;please scoot over and get off your <br/>
brother&#39;s blanket&quot;.  If that didn&#39;t diffuse the situation, then addressing the <br/>
blanket hitting would have been next.  The brother needs other ways to <br/>
communicate than hitting.  The issue seems to have been a violation of space, <br/>
which he chose to act upon by taking back his personal item and hitting the <br/>
offending person with it.<br/>
<br/>
 ***I&#39;ve been<br/>
removing the child who feels unsafe like Sandra suggests.  This often turns into <br/>
him following us and trying to hurt us both.  This, too, feels wrong.***<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he follows to make sure in a way that his thoughts and ideas are fairly <br/>
represented.  He probably feels trampled upon.  He&#39;s the middle child and the <br/>
only boy.<br/>
<br/>
***My husband is wonderful and supportive and my son&#39;s favorite person.  He <br/>
thinks that what my son needs is to know that I&#39;m in charge in these sorts of <br/>
scenarios.  That in the most gentle way I can he needs to know that I am strong <br/>
and in charge.***<br/>
<br/>
Right, I can see that.  If you are in charge of these scenarios, then you&#39;ll be <br/>
looking out for him to make sure he isn&#39;t trampled on by his sisters.  You can <br/>
prevent him from getting to a place of frustration by being mindful of his needs <br/>
before he feels threatened.<br/>
<br/>
What your husband does is sweet, he takes him out of the situation and distracts <br/>
him and helps bring him to a better space.  Watch how your husband does it.  See <br/>
what it is that he does that makes the difference.  If you&#39;ve tried to replicate <br/>
it and it hasn&#39;t worked, what else is he doing different that you aren&#39;t.  Maybe <br/>
there&#39;s a level of comedy that you aren&#39;t getting.  Maybe there&#39;s a beginning <br/>
grand gesture that literally sweeps him away.  Maybe there are certain toys that <br/>
are part of the joking and distraction.  Or maybe it doesn&#39;t work because you <br/>
haven&#39;t been the rescuer, but have unintentionally made him feel more of a bad <br/>
guy.  Maybe after you change that around, you&#39;ll be able to be more of the <br/>
rescuer.  Maybe you won&#39;t even need to anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289077616">--=I haven&#39;t suggested that.If you were all just hanging around, and the girl wasn&#39;t involved in  <br/>
<br/>
an altercation, and you had said &quot;she feels unsafe,&quot; that&#39;s not the  <br/>
<br/>
kind of situation I&#39;ve discussed when I talk about rescuing the kid  <br/>
 <br/>
who&#39;s losing, because he wants to be rescued.=--<br/>
I think I clearly just don&#39;t understand what it is you are saying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
--=&quot;She feels unsafe&quot;?  Is that a quote?<br/>
<br/>
It seems distant to me, not direct, normal communication. It sounds  <br/>
<br/>
stilted.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with that is if he feels you&#39;re reciting a script instead  <br/>
 <br/>
of addressing him in that moment, that might make him angrier.--=<br/>
My daughter (the 7yo) talk about this a lot because her relationship with her brother makes her really sad.  She has said many times that she feels unsafe when he threatens her in that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
--=I would be more likely to say &quot;If you want the blanket ask for it next  <br/>
<br/>
time, and walk him and the blanket to the other room and ask him what  <br/>
 <br/>
his problem is.--=<br/>
That is how I always have dealt with this sort of thing.  It wasn&#39;t working, though.  He gets mad at me when I redirect him or take him away.  When I ask him what&#39;s wrong he won&#39;t tell me.  I suspect he doesn&#39;t know how to articulate what&#39;s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
--=  <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t grab&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t hit&quot; seem better than &quot;your sister is feeling  <br/>
 <br/>
unsafe,&quot; to me.--=<br/>
I have always thought that was true but he doesn&#39;t listen to me.  He tunes me out and I can myself turning into white noise.  That&#39;s not how I want him to hear me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--=-= My son gets VERY offended when I try to make him laugh and it makes  <br/>
<br/>
him more angry.  I feel like he doesn&#39;t feel like I truly understand  <br/>
<br/>
him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that too, though, just from the way you&#39;ve written  <br/>
 <br/>
about it.--=<br/>
I think that, too.  I know he feels that way.  What I don&#39;t know is how to connect with him in a way that shows him I do care and I do understand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721600782">-=-***I&#39;ve been<br/>
removing the child who feels unsafe like Sandra suggests. This often  <br/>
turns into<br/>
him following us and trying to hurt us both. This, too, feels wrong.***<br/>
<br/>
-=-Perhaps he follows to make sure in a way that his thoughts and  <br/>
ideas are fairly<br/>
represented. He probably feels trampled upon. He&#39;s the middle child  <br/>
and the<br/>
only boy.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  I don&#39;t like people to go somewhere else that way.  The  <br/>
sister would be taken away for soothing, leaving the bad boy behind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already mentioned it, but just in case anyone missed it,  <br/>
&quot;removing the child who feels unsafe&quot; isn&#39;t (in the context of the boy  <br/>
whose sister is sitting on his blanket) familiar to me, so I don&#39;t  <br/>
want the credit.  My recommendation was (passed on from a teacher I  <br/>
worked with years ago) was when there is a fight (physical  <br/>
altercation), and you want to break it up, grab the one who&#39;s losing.   <br/>
He will want to be rescued.<br/>
<br/>
The longer recommendation from which I think the idea above came is  <br/>
this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting">http://sandradodd.com/peace/fighting</a><br/>
<br/>
But the example given in this topic happened with the mother in the  <br/>
room.   That&#39;s a different situation, if she was right there and saw  <br/>
the whole thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052948778">-=-What I don&#39;t know is how to connect with him in a way that shows  <br/>
him I do care and I do understand.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been assuring him that you do understand, he might be  <br/>
starting to lose confidence in your communications.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel like I&#39;m such a girl that I honestly don&#39;t know what it is   <br/>
he wants. -=-<br/>
<br/>
So you don&#39;t understand him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay, to have a kid who baffles you.<br/>
It&#39;s less okay to want to show him how much you understand instead of  <br/>
saying honestly &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;  But I&#39;m not recommending that  <br/>
you say to him &quot;I do not understand you.&quot;  Neither am I recommending  <br/>
that you ask him WHY he does things and expect him to even know.  If  <br/>
you don&#39;t know and you&#39;re grown, how will he know, at five years old?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s a lot of the problem.  It might be that you&#39;re expecting  <br/>
him to understand more than he does, at his age.  And he would have  <br/>
been the baby, if you hadn&#39;t had the younger girl.  Perhaps too much  <br/>
was expected of him too soon.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of sending him with your husband automatically, as a default  <br/>
thing, maybe give him the choice of whether to go and do something  <br/>
with you or with your husband.  Don&#39;t make it a trap or a quiz with a  <br/>
&quot;right answer.&quot;  But let him choose.   He might choose his dad the  <br/>
next 20 times, but when it makes sense to do so, let him choose.   <br/>
Maybe one of the girls would like some of your husband&#39;s attention,  <br/>
too.   And each time it&#39;s a new choice, you&#39;re giving him more power,  <br/>
and more autonomy, and he&#39;s feeling like you&#39;re his partner, rather  <br/>
than the person who waits to get rid of him to his dad.  (That might  <br/>
not be how you feel about it, but it could possibly be how he feels.)<br/>
<br/>
It takes a long time to build up good, strong relationships, and every  <br/>
little choice you make now goes toward that &quot;account&quot; (or takes away  <br/>
from it...)<br/>

<br/>
  Could you please explain this in a different way?  I&#39;m having a hard time translating that into something that I can utilize during my days.  I love what it says and I know that it&#39;s true.  I am having difficulty, though, in translating that thought into action.<br/>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
when he feels really understood - not criticized or like &quot;the aggressive son&quot; - he will have room to learn new ways of responding to stress, within developmental capability.  so if he starts to hit, maybe  get down on the floor with him and tell him kindly but firmly that you won&#39;t let him hit his sister, but that you see he really wants his blanket.  even apologize for not noticing that his blanket was getting sat on.  say &quot;oh, no, your blanket, I am so sorry, that really bothers you when we forget how important your blanket is to you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or even better, notice the blanket ahead of time and make sure it&#39;s not sat on.  if he ends up hitting because you don&#39;t prevent or respond in time, don&#39;t focus on the hitting. you&#39;ve already missed your opportunity and his emotional brain is engaged, not his logical brain - lecturing, explaining, teaching, reminding, expecting logic or control - not reasonable at that moment.  not really very reasonable at age 5 much of the time, but especially in the heat of the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
sometimes you might be able to insert yourself in between your kids with a &quot;WAIT! we can resolve this!&quot;  conveying confidence and trust in your voice that everything can be worked through, empathy for his position, and taking responsibility for better mother-prevention-needs for the future can calm things down dramatically.  <br/>
<br/>
and then there are all the other ways people have mentioned to show he&#39;s understood and to convey compassion - like setting the situation up for success in the first place - not sitting around if that leads to conflict, making sure he&#39;s fed, engaged, rested, nurtured, and has had his physical / sensory needs met.  <br/>
<br/>
but most of this starts with really working on yourself to genuinely FEEL that compassion in your own head and heart when you interact with him, rather than trying to figure out how to TEACH him better ways.<br/>
<br/>
does that help?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702409549">***I felt so mean the times I did that because he was left feeling bad.  It <br/>
would have made me feel awful, too. ***<br/>
<br/>
This exactly the feeling that should be examined.  If any parent feels badly <br/>
about an action they have taken towards their child, examine it and turn it <br/>
inside out.  Don&#39;t accept it as natural, don&#39;t accept it as something that must <br/>
be done for the greater good.  Spanking is an extreme example of that.<br/>
<br/>
I assume this is why you put forth the question in the first place!  Something <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel right and you know it and see it, now to get to the bottom of it. <br/>
 My personal feeling is that our culture is designed, these days, to see a <br/>
symptom and try to make the symptom go away, rather than looking more deeply at <br/>
the underlying cause.<br/>
<br/>
In your own words, it seems you know what it is.  He&#39;s, the only boy and he&#39;s <br/>
frustrated, now you need tools to change the dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
Something that I&#39;ve found useful when I&#39;ve been frustrated by one of my <br/>
children&#39;s behaviors, is to step back and look at all the things about them that <br/>
are positive and wonderful.  When I&#39;m able to do that, I automatically shift my <br/>
interactions with my kids.  It&#39;s not magic, but it can feel that way.  Some <br/>
children are simply more intense than others or their personalities are less <br/>
similar and it&#39;s easy to see them as &quot;the other&quot; or something else less than <br/>
stellar.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean that hitting exemplifies stellar behavior, but more that you <br/>
have a beautiful boy who behaves like a boy.  What&#39;s beautiful about boys, and <br/>
what&#39;s beautiful about your particular boy, even while he&#39;s in the midst of <br/>
being angry?  It can change your thought from &quot;ugh my angry boy&quot;, to &quot;my <br/>
beautiful boy is angry, what can I do to help him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I first read the description, the words you chose were about a little boy <br/>
whose special blanket was being sat upon.  It was both very literal and almost <br/>
analogous to how and why that boy feels so upset about things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was on the phone with someone whose parenting I respect a whole lot <br/>
She has a bunch of kids with a wide age span. I heard her say (and I <br/>
wish I could convey the tone of voice), &quot;Hey, don&#39;t hit your sister what <br/>
do you want?&quot;  Kind of all one line - in a very matter of fact voice. <br/>
The &quot;don&#39;t hit your sister&quot; part sounded, in tone, kind of like, &quot;So you <br/>
already KNOW I am not going to let you hit your sister so what the heck <br/>
are you trying that for since you know that&#39;s not gonna work.&quot; Only not <br/>
all those words, just &quot;Hey, don&#39;t hit your sister...&quot; followed in the <br/>
same breath with, &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The tone is what I want to talk about - it wasn&#39;t condemning, it wasn&#39;t <br/>
shocked, there was no hit of &quot;What a bad person you are,&quot; and no hint of <br/>
fear or begging. It was just a reminder that hitting wasn&#39;t okay and she <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to let it happen. It was firm, but easy - it was said in a <br/>
clear voice, no pleading, no threatening, just sort of dry, but there <br/>
was also some underlying warmth and a sense that she knew that he knew <br/>
what she meant - some respect.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of parents talk way way way too much. They would do better <br/>
to work on conveying what they want the kids to really hear by their <br/>
tone of voice and body language and a few words.<br/>
<br/>
I think Laura might be a little bewildred by Sandra&#39;s questioning of the <br/>
use of the word &quot;safe.&quot;   As a high-falutin&#39; principle, it is a great <br/>
word. It is a principle of our family life that people should feel safe <br/>
in our home - safe from physical harm and also from mental and emotional <br/>
harm.<br/>
<br/>
But it is too big a meaning for a 7 yo to be using because her 5 yo <br/>
brother is swinging a blanket at her.  it raised a flag for me that <br/>
there is too much talking about &quot;feeling safe&quot; going on. &quot;I don&#39;t feel <br/>
safe&quot; would make more sense for a child to say if she&#39;s generally being <br/>
bullied or abused, not about normal sibling conflicts which, at that <br/>
age, are often physically acted out. If she said that to a mandated <br/>
reporter, you might get reported. I&#39;d steer away from it to very simple <br/>
responses. Probably, my guess, is that mom is talking like this - in <br/>
kind of big-picture stilted language, trying to do the right thing, and <br/>
trying too hard, so that things are a bit stilted. Older daughter is <br/>
probably very verbal and a mommy-pleasing kid and is picking up that <br/>
language and using it.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could bottle my friend&#39;s voice on the phone  - she&#39;s so simple <br/>
and clear and direct and her voice is so sweet, but firm, at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
  I think Laura needs really clear concrete explanations, she&#39;s so way <br/>
into her own head and over-thinking everything and trying to do things <br/>
&quot;right&quot; to the point that it isn&#39;t &quot;real.&quot; And it is sort of unlucky, in <br/>
a way, when a parent &quot;gets&quot; the first kid really well - when their <br/>
personalities are alike enough that the second feels sometimes like an <br/>
outsider. I had this too - to an extent - with Roxana, my middle child, <br/>
because Roya and I were so so much alike and Roxana was not the same <br/>
temperament. I&#39;ve learned over the years to SUPER appreciate her <br/>
temperament and to take on some of it myself, to my own betterment.<br/>
<br/>
So - long post and rambly, but I hope there is something useful in <br/>
there. Laura - I think more specific examples that people can take apart <br/>
and discuss alternative approaches will really help you out.<br/>

You probably already say some or all of these things,  but I would  <br/>
sympathize (I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s that way) and predict (he&#39;s just little  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619839927">I see what you&#39;re saying.  Here&#39;s the thing that I need help with, I don&#39;t generally understand boys.  With girls, who generally are more able to express themselves verbally, they tell me what&#39;s going on and I can help.  With boys, who don&#39;t necessarily express themselves as well, verbally, I&#39;m at a loss.  At least this has been my experience and it is the situation with my son.  In what other ways can I read him?  <br/>

Yes, I am drawing a gender line.  A line that I never would have made before I had my son.  It is important to him.  He draws that line all the time.  His boy-ness is very important to him.  I can&#39;t stress to you enough the importance of gender neutrality in my life. ++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not suggesting gender neutrality actually.  OR treating him as a girl.  I am suggesting not thinking of him as a foreign subject who you can&#39;t connect with, based on his boyness...<br/>

<br/>
Just because he &quot;draws the line&quot; about gender doesn&#39;t mean you have to  <br/>
go there with him.<br/>
But maybe you could talk to him about that, if he&#39;s talking about his  <br/>
boy-ness.  Talk to him about how it might be different if he had a  <br/>
twin sister--or if one of his sisters had a twin brother.  It might be  <br/>
a fun conversation just in general, but you could learn more about how  <br/>
he sees the differences.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t stress to you enough the importance of gender neutrality in  <br/>
my life. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Stressing it to us won&#39;t change anything.  It does already seem that  <br/>
you&#39;re either expecting him to be more girlish, or that you&#39;re seeing  <br/>
him as the single male in the group while your husband is working, and  <br/>
that comes from the phrases you yourself chose and wrote and posted.    <br/>
Sometimes people write without realizing what they&#39;ve written but  <br/>
outside of typos, writing indicates thought.<br/>
<br/>
Writing even in journals can be helpful with that, when a person does  <br/>
go back and read what she wrote weeks or months or years earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Writing on this list can be like shining a magic light on phrase and  <br/>
thought because so many here have spent years having people come and  <br/>
say something, and then deny they said it; see their words and deny  <br/>
they meant it; and then work through to seeing that they were thinking  <br/>
it but wish they weren&#39;t.  That might not be so in this case, but just  <br/>
in case it might, you could look at these pages, maybe.<br/>
