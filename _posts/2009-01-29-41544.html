not teaching.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Verna and anyone and everyone:  If you bring an outside link to this  <br/>
list, please write something about it too--what it&#39;s about and why you  <br/>
think it&#39;s of interest to the people on this list.  It&#39;s generally  <br/>
just too dangerous for anyone to click on a link without knowing what  <br/>
it&#39;s going to be.<br/>
<br/>
No bare links, please.<br/>
