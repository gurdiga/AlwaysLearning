been a really mellow guy. It&#39;s mostly this need for structure (and his very <br/>
creative way of getting it for himself.)  His father is SERIOUSLY Virgo, with <br/>
Sun, Moon, and Rising sign in Virgo, and if ya wanna see a picture of him, <br/>
look up &quot;anal&quot; in the dictionary. <br/>
