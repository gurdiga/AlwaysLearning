<div id="ygrps-yiv-733689598">Someone on another list wants the answer to this question.  Anybody got one?<br/>
<br/>
~~Somewhere in some book that I can of course not find at the moment provided <br/>
the explanation and origin of those annoying growth charts that peds use to <br/>
track the height/weight of our little ones.  I vaguely recall these charts were <br/>
based on averages collected in the 50&#39;s in Iowa or Montana or someplace like <br/>
that...does anyone have any concrete info on these?<br/>
<br/>
(these charts drive me to distraction!!)~~<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Introduction<br/>
The growth charts consist of a series of percentile curves that illustrate<br/>
the distribution of selected body measurements in U.S. children. Pediatric<br/>
growth charts have been used by pediatricians, nurses, and parents to track<br/>
the growth of infants, children, and adolescents in the United States since<br/>
1977. The 1977 growth charts were developed by the National Center for<br/>
Health Statistics (NCHS) as a clinical tool for health professionals to<br/>
determine if the growth of a child is adequate. The 1977 charts were also<br/>
adopted by the World Health Organization for international use.<br/>
<br/>
When the 1977 NCHS growth charts were first developed, NCHS recommended that<br/>
they be revised periodically as necessary. With more recent and<br/>
comprehensive national data now available, along with improved statistical<br/>
procedures, the 1977 growth charts were revised and updated to make them a<br/>
more valuable clinical tool for health professionals. The 2000 CDC growth<br/>
charts represent the revised version of the 1977 NCHS growth charts. Most of<br/>
the data used to construct these charts come from the National Health and<br/>
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which has periodically collected<br/>
height and weight and other health information on the American population<br/>
since the early 1960&#39;s.<br/>

stuff, but what you sent was right on the money!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Nancy!  :)<br/>
