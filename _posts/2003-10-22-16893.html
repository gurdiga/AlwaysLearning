<br/>
I have a concern about my son Zach who is 10.  He is the second of 5<br/>

older, he has moved to almost complete sugar and white flour, high glycemic<br/>

worried.<br/>

I&#39;ve talked to him, had doctors talk to him, had nutritionists talk to him.<br/>

made sure to have at least one at each meal.  He ate for a couple of days<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829685677">Wow.  I really feel for you in this situation.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think what would do is talk with your other children about their brother&#39;s condition and explain that there will not be any snack foods around anymore.  His health is more important than treats for the other children, and perhaps they could have a special treat when they are out alone with you, away from their brother.<br/>
 <br/>
With no other alternatives, he will have to eat other foods.  Perhaps you can learn to make things that are treats, but with little or no sugar.  If he will not eat anything new, or continues to eat only sugar...he will end up sick and/or hospitalized either way, it&#39;s just a question of when.  I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh, please understand that.  Your son is obviously ill already and really needs help. Perhaps not having the illness-causing food available will break the sugar addiction.  He can&#39;t get it if you don&#39;t provide it, and he obviously can&#39;t control himself.  So the first thing I would do is eliminate the problem.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think you need to think of it like this - You wouldn&#39;t buy my child cigarettes and worry about his worsening athsma.  You wouldn&#39;t buy him liquor and then worry about his liver count.  But you are buying him junk food and then wondering why he is sick.  DON&#39;T BUY THE JUNK.<br/>
 <br/>
If you go to the library and search under nutrition for children, you should find some titles that can help you.  I am a librarian (and at work right now looking this up as I type) and some of the titlesI found include:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
1. The glucose revolution pocket guide to the glycemic index and healthy kids / Heather Gilbertson ...[et al.] ; adapted by Johanna Burani and Linda Rao.<br/>
 <br/>
2.The parent&#39;s guide to childhood eating disorders /Marcia Herrin and Nancy Matsumoto<br/>
 <br/>
3.Healthy eating for life for children / Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine<br/>
 <br/>
4. Minsky, Bonnie C. Our children&#39;s health: America&#39;s kids in nutritional crisis and what we can do to help them.<br/>
 <br/>
5. Brackenridge, Betty Page.  Sweet kids. 2nd ed. Alexandria, Va.: American Diabetes Association. 2002.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Sweet kids is actually about diabetic children, but seemed to include sugar-free recipes and how to please an entire family while avoiding sugar, which sounds like it might really help you.   All these titles are current - c.2000 or later.<br/>
 <br/>
GOOD LUCK!!!!<br/>

<br/>
Has he been tested for type I diabetes?  This actually sounds more <br/>
like anorexia, which is a control thing, often one of the only things <br/>
that some children feel they can control is what they put in their <br/>
bodies, or what they allow to stay in their bodies in some cases.  <br/>
<br/>
But if it&#39;s just thin you are worried about, and the doctors have <br/>
given him a clean bill of health, then I would cease to worry.  Thin <br/>
is good.  Most doctors will tell you that.  Unless there is evidence <br/>
of some other health problems, like bone problems, or teeth problems, <br/>
or other signs of malnutrition, then let him eat cake!  In a manner <br/>
of speaking, of course.  In homeopathic medicine we use these kinds <br/>
of aversions and cravings as symptoms that guide us to the proper <br/>
constitutional remedy for that child.  But thin is really not a big <br/>
problem by itself if other health issues have been ruled out.  Every <br/>
kid will eventually find his or her own nutritional balance.  <br/>
<br/>
Most agree that making a big deal out of it often exacerbates the <br/>
problem.  But if it is anorexia then you need to deal with that.  And <br/>
forcing never works with that.  Find a good homeopath.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128361279">Have you read How to Get Your Kid to Eat... But Not Too Much <br/>
By Ellyn Satter?  I think you would find it helpful.  It is always so <br/>
much more difficult to deal with eating when a child doesn&#39;t fall <br/>
within the *normal* range of weight or health.  I assume that medical <br/>
condiditons have been ruled out, since you mention the doc and <br/>
nutritionist.<br/>
<br/>
As hard as it will be, you might have to just bite your tongue and <br/>
feed him the way you feed your other children.  Pressuring him to eat <br/>
will not help.  He might just be a genetically small, skinny person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371147818">Holly reminded me of something-- my mom never kept junk in the house, <br/>
but looking back I realized that I would make myself grits with 1/2 cup <br/>
of sugar and tablespoons of butter.  To this day my favorite foods <br/>
involve lots of bread!  The only thing that has helped me is to realize <br/>
that I feel like crap if I eat nothing but bread stuffs all day-- I <br/>
never knew that was why I fell asleep everytime I ate pasta . . .<br/>
I wonder if you brought it up like, &quot;Will you try this experiment for <br/>
me?&quot; and then fed him low-glycemic foods for a day (week?) -- maybe he <br/>
would see a difference in how he felt and decide to adjust things?  Or <br/>
maybe have a whole family experiment, and everyone can compare notes?  <br/>
Maybe he wouldn&#39;t decide to make any changes now, but at least if he <br/>
had the opportunity to see how it makes him feel, he always has the <br/>
option to use the knowledge (as opposed to me, who didn&#39;t get the <br/>
knowledge until I was 30). . .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095597993">At his age, just hitting puberty, is when he has to be the one in charge of<br/>
his food more and more, not less, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Does he have an interest in learning to cook? If you had ready-to-heat<br/>
plastic frozen bags of homemade enchiladas or lasagna or spaghetti would he<br/>
take the time to nuke them, or notice the smell if you did one yourself and<br/>
put it on offer? That kind of thing can be reheated multiple times if need<br/>
be, no waste if he doesn&#39;t feel like eating it.<br/>
<br/>
Or he may just be predisposed to look like he looks right now, regardless of<br/>
his diet. When I was a teen I looked like Twiggy on a bad day, and I was in<br/>
a &quot;two vegetables with dinner and clear your plate&quot; household. Didn&#39;t make<br/>
much difference to how I looked.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a concern about my son Zach who is 10.  He is the second of 5<br/>
&gt; children and has an issue with food.  Now the only rule we have about food<br/>
&gt; at our house is that if you take it, please eat it.  Food is a major budget<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760206876">I think my first stop would be a counselor.  Someone who is keen on <br/>
homeschooling (unschooling) and respectful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I am also thinking something like anorexia. <br/>
<br/>
I would stop buying so much junk.  Instead I might give the kids a &quot;food <br/>
allowance&quot; and let them spend it as they liked, with Zach needing some <br/>
special consideration. <br/>
<br/>
I do see this as a medical issue.  He&#39;s not healthy, you say.  If he was <br/>
healthy and just thin, that&#39;d be fine.  But you said &quot; He is very small <br/>
for his age (53 inches) and extremely skinny (53 lbs) at 10 years<br/>
of age!!!  His hair is listless, the veins on his arms stick out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This concerns me.  I don&#39;t usually think vits are a good idea, but in <br/>
this case, I think this might be a good thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old is 53 inches, and weighs more.  If your family is not <br/>
small.....<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what you decide to do. <br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t buy a lot of junk type food.  We have limited money <br/>
for food and buying junk just doesn&#39;t seem to be smart.  Each kid gets <br/>
to pick out a treat when they shop, but it&#39;s likely to be blueberries as <br/>
it is to be chips.  A bit of each.  7up is for when we have sick <br/>
tummies, sodas are what we have when we go out, or at parties, not <br/>
regularly.  Lexie asked once why we didn&#39;t buy sodas and chips and <br/>
cookies and have htem all the time, and I told her I&#39;d rather spend my <br/>
extra money on books.  That was all she needed to hear! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991846416">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
Just to chime in my own view.....<br/>
<br/>
I come from the &quot;tall and skinny&quot; side of the family. When I was younger this meant that you could see my veins easily, I could gross friends out by breathing in deep and showing my bony ribs...oh -- and my poor mother had to drive two towns over to the sears where they carried slim sizes. I&#39;ve always been able to eat what I want and not gain -- high metabolism.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest brother is also tall and skinny. When he was younger, one of the few things he would eat was hot dogs. I spoke with him last week and was absolutely flabergasted when he informed me that he shops at a local Health Food store, buys soy milk....and ultimately has diversified his diet! <br/>
<br/>
I know you have real concerns about your sons diet.....but I do want to caution you re: the label &quot;anorexia&quot;. Not all super skinny kids are anorexic....many skinny people simply have high metabolisms and burn up their food at a different rate. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, a child needs to eat more than junk food. My dd loves sweets, but we encourage her to have &quot;real&quot; food first and to save to candy and soda for later. If all she were eating was junk, I wouldn&#39;t buy it.<br/>

<br/>
Being small for one&#39;s age and being thin are not necessarily indications of health problems.  I was the smallest person in my class all the way through elementary school.  Someone has to be the smallest.  We can only all be above average in Lake Woebegone.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I liked about Ellyn Satter&#39;s book, is that she discusses the FACT that human body types vary.  Some people are thin and wiry, some are round and pudgy.  This is normal.  Children especially go through various stages as they grow and they will not always remain as they were while children.  There are some things I don&#39;t like about her book as well, especially the title &quot;how to Get Your Kid to Eat...But not Too Much.  The title sounds like the parent&#39;s goal is to &quot;get your kid to eat&quot; but if you read the book, you&#39;ll find that her point is for parents to realize and accept that they cannot control their children&#39;s eating.  She discusses the psychology of eating and shares case studies of &quot;underweight&quot; and &quot;overweight&quot; children.  She does talk about setting some limits, which I would disagree with now, but overall it is a book that can help parents learn how to allow their children to listen to their own bodies.<br/>

This boy&#39;s BMI is 13.  Unless he is a serious, muscular athlete, this low body fat level could seriously compromise his immunity.  A kid who eats Pepsi and cereal with heaping spoonfuls of sugar as regular mealtime fare and is as underweight as this child sounds to me like his situation is a bit more serious that &quot;being small.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, I am only 5 feet tall.  I know what it is to be small.  This is a HEALTH issue not a SIZE issue.  No matter his size, his BMI indicates that.<br/>
 <br/>
I find it hard to believe that parents would worry more about choice than health in this situation.  I am all for choices when they are not potentially harmful.  It&#39;s one thing to have a skinny, picky eater.  It&#39;s quite another to have a seriously underweight kid and say &quot;he needs to be able to make choices.&quot;  Obviously that tack has produced poor results in this case.<br/>

What great advice!  It is true that some children at a certain age have difficulty getting enough calories because they are growing so fast.  I love to snack on things like trail mix or roasted nuts.  These can be expensive, but are great sources of protein, fat, and calories.  They also can be sweet, so can satisfy that craving while still providing nutrition.  Nuts mixed with dried fruit and chocolate or carob chips or M&Ms.  Honey roasted mixed nuts.  Smoked salmon, beef jerky, Yum, I&#39;m getting hungry now...<br/>
<br/>
I once knew a cook on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska.  It was common for many crews to bring lots of candy bars because they were something that they could stuff in their mouth and not have to stop working to eat.  Well this cook would make lots of sandwiches, cut them in about 6 pieces, and he would go around putting the &quot;bite-size&quot; sandwiches in his crew&#39;s mouths while they worked.  Pre-made sandwiches cut in handy size pieces and stored in Tupperware style containers on the counter or in the fridge might be a good idea for lots of families.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe there is a way to find a balance between helping a child make food <br/>
choices and improving health.  We have several food allergies in our family, <br/>
one potentialy fatal.  We have always discussed food choices together and my <br/>
kids can make their own decisions.  They would never choose a peanut, because <br/>
they know what it can do to them.  The can choose highly processed corn stuff <br/>
because they understand the consequence is less severe.  They are four and five <br/>
years old.<br/>
<br/>
Food has not been a battle in our family for a long time.  I can make cookies <br/>
and the kids can decide to eat them or not, based on their hunger level.  It <br/>
is such a foreign concept to me that it still amazes me to hear them say &quot;no <br/>
thanks, Mom.  I&#39;m not hungry right now.&quot;  Or, as happened today, &quot;maybe I <br/>
should have a piece of cheese instead of a cookie.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is that there&#39;s a whole area inbetween the &quot;eat whatever you <br/>
want&quot; mode and the &quot;you can never have this&quot; mode.  <br/>

<br/>
Everything in the world is potentially  harmful.<br/>
<br/>
Being overly controlling is a KNOWN harm.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s one thing to have a skinny, picky eater.  It&#39;s quite another to have <br/>
a seriously underweight kid and say &quot;he needs to be able to make choices.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are &quot;seriously&quot; underweight is adding a value judgment to what *MIGHT* <br/>
be a genetic normality.<br/>
<br/>
This culture operates TOO much on &quot;averages&quot; and charts, and so much of what <br/>
is healthy, true and right for an individual then becomes branded &quot;abnormal,&quot; <br/>
because it is not the mathematical norm.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re biological beings, not mathematical data.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Obviously that tack has produced poor results in this case.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Obviously&quot; means literally that we can see it.<br/>
We can&#39;t see it.<br/>
We&#39;re dealing with words, and asking questions for further clarification.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem most people have who are &quot;too thin&quot; or &quot;too fat&quot; (whether <br/>
&quot;dangerously&quot; so or not) is the CRAP they get from relatives and friends <br/>
about how it&#39;s their fault, or their mom&#39;s fault, and how the kids should play <br/>
soccer, or drink skim milk, or sit up straight or not wear stripes.<br/>
<br/>
Treating a person like a problem to be fixed is not treating him like a <br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I find it hard to believe that parents would worry more about choice than <br/>
health in this situation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People aren&#39;t &quot;worrying&quot; about choice.  They&#39;re advocating it.<br/>
Treating children like people instead of like property or like projects makes <br/>
such a profound difference in the lives of all involved that those who &quot;find <br/>
it hard to believe&quot; cannot even imagine what we&#39;re talking about.<br/>

were desperate to get food when they could, knowing another bird meal was all <br/>
they would get before bedtime once they got home, and eating between snacks <br/>

It is well recognized that making food a power issue is a bad idea, this is<br/>
where eating disorders come from.  To create a more serious problem out of<br/>
trying to solve a temporary one is not good.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to truly ask the child to help me with my concerns<br/>
over his choices by talking.  In the long run, however, the only choice is<br/>
to trust them.  As parents of anorexics and bulimics can tell you, being<br/>
more controlling doesn&#39;t solve the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106365089">Thanks for all the responses.<br/>

I&#39;ve tried the simply &quot;adding to&quot; strategy.  Zach is also a picky eater.  He<br/>
is picky about colors, tastes, textures, having never have had something<br/>
before, etc..  I offer protein bars (his sister has them for a snack during<br/>
her 3 hour gymnastics class) but all the flavors &quot;taste funny&quot;.  I have a<br/>
bowl of grapes, apples and bananas out on the table.  We have nuts out,<br/>
always have some kind of jerky, often have cheese cut up(although he did<br/>
take a small slice of cheese before dinner....but then had no dinner other<br/>
than a slice of cake with a huge mound of whip cream on it).  Zach simply<br/>
doesn&#39;t choose these things.  I will try actually taking these things to<br/>
Zach.  Maybe that will help him make the connection about good food and<br/>
&quot;warm fuzzies&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He was a real roly-poly baby but beginning about 15 months, he stayed 22 lbs<br/>
for almost 2 years.  Zach was adopted and his birth mother was a fashion<br/>
model but his birth father is a huge guy.  All of his birth siblings (there<br/>
are 3) appear height/weight proportionate.<br/>
<br/>
I truly couldn&#39;t care less about Zach being small.  His younger sister (not<br/>
biological) is extremely tiny, but proportionate.  She appears healthy.<br/>
Zach appears to be starving.  I don&#39;t think he is anorexic, just<br/>
malnourished.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;eat it if you take it&quot; is a generality and doesn&#39;t apply to people<br/>
trying new things at our house.  It has more to do with having a house full<br/>
of kids and sometimes people want something simply because somebody else has<br/>
one, not because they are hungry.  When Danny takes the last yogurt simply<br/>
because Marsie has one and then takes 2 bites and throws it out, it is<br/>
doubly hard on Michelle who comes along 10 minutes later and really wants<br/>
one but will have to wait until the next time I go to the store.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a big issue with food  although I would like to lose about 20<br/>
pounds.  I was raised in a really layed back family and my mom worked so<br/>
food was pretty much an independent decision type of deal.<br/>
<br/>
Zach has never been diagnosed with anything.  When he stopped gaining weight<br/>
as a toddler, the doctor checked his growth hormone level which was fine.<br/>
We saw a nutritionist whose answer was to decorate Zach&#39;s food so it looked<br/>
like clown faces, etc..  Zach wasn&#39;t impressed.  Another family doctor<br/>
suggested Pediasure which Zach liked but then he completely quit eating all<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Zach has taken vitamins in the past until the new wore off and he refused.<br/>
<br/>
I do keep some, not a whole bunch, of foods with lower nutritional density<br/>
in the house for a couple of reasons.<br/>
<br/>
1)6 out of 7 people in the house are doing fine with them.<br/>
<br/>
2)I don&#39;t want to make a power struggle out of this because I know I will<br/>
lose.  I talk with all the kids a lot about there is no BAD food.  Just that<br/>
over a few days period, our bodies need certain nutrients and we need to<br/>
make sure we feed that to our bodies so we can be healthy.  Some foods have<br/>
more nutrients, some have less.  I talk with Zach about how since he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a big appetite, when he only eats food with little nutrients, his body<br/>
isn&#39;t getting what it needs.  He can still have the foods he loves, just his<br/>
body would appreciate a &quot;booster&quot; of minerals and vitamins, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I want to try to keep from taking him to the doctor specifically for this<br/>
(lots of doctors have talked to him over the years when we were seeing them<br/>
about other things).  I really don&#39;t want to make it into some kind of<br/>
monster-thing.  But it is the BMI thing that I am concerned about.  I can<br/>
tell by looking that Zach isn&#39;t just a skinny boy.  He is seriously<br/>
underweight.  I love my son and I&#39;m worried.<br/>

<br/>
Jonathan can become disinterested in food too and can go for days with very<br/>
little intake.  One thing I&#39;ve done is actually feed him, I prepare<br/>
something that he really likes and then sit down with him wherever he may<br/>
be, usually playing video games.  I give him bites so he doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
stop what he is doing.  I might have to do this for a couple of days until<br/>
his appetite returns.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, I don&#39;t force him to eat, just make is SO available and easy that<br/>
he&#39;s more likely to do so.  I haven&#39;t had to do this for several months now,<br/>
perhaps he has outgrown the situation.  It may not work for you but thought<br/>
I would tell what I did in hopes that it might.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096629305">I have been moving and off line most of this week so if I am way off base or <br/>
off track or covering something all wrong i say sorry now.<br/>
my personal experence with food restrictions have been diasaterous and so has <br/>
forse feeding (as in: ya dont get up till it is all gone)<br/>
we adopted lisa  she was very thin and her bio&#39;s had restricted her and her <br/>
bio  brother to small portions and no snacks. so we got a child that gorged and <br/>
stole food and horded. all expected under circumstances. we went from letting <br/>
her just eat to giving small portions then giving more portions and diverting <br/>
her attion when we knew we had hit the gorgeing. if she was still &quot;hungery &quot;we <br/>
found something together and yes often it was junk food. It took me a long time <br/>
with trail and error to discover, when we said yes and combined it with attion <br/>
like cuddle time and when we finish what we are doing lets go get a treat or <br/>
would you like something to eat? The battle disapeared. <br/>
 Ocnally she will lapse into old behaviors when under stress. <br/>
I have also found with lisa that example is a key. when people at the table are <br/>
genuinely enjoying the food she will try it and often enjoy it also/<br/>
watching what  she is eating helps as in for some reason when she is eating <br/>
lots of sugar stuff  i look and find more one on one from me  less sugar foods. <br/>
dont know how sintefic this is. as most kids will eat more sugar.however when <br/>
she is eating bags of carrots  belive it or not it is after she has been <br/>
reading or on her computer for long time. mashed pototes are her absulte <br/>
fav.when we serve them first plate will be mostly  pototoes and a bit of <br/>
others. if she is  choosing them as a main lunch or snack i look at them as her <br/>
comfort food and spen more cuddle time on couch.not that I use her eating <br/>
habits as a complete guide but when they get extencive.also i look at me when I <br/>
find I need to control her intake. I do serve what I determine to be healty and <br/>
give her heatlhy choices. I dont let her sit and eat  nothing but choclate cake <br/>
while every one else is eating other things she can eat or not eat or eat till <br/>
she cant. We mall wait till about a 1/2 hour or so and then eat a casul snak if <br/>
i made a cake or what ever. We have also found that if every one who wants <br/>
makes or helps make or even chooses what is for dinner that helps. Was amazing  <br/>
to have upside down day and how they do  choose good stuff and help encourge <br/>
younger ones and older ones to try there pot roast. or&quot;ants on a log&quot; thi9s was <br/>
a hunch I had one day: most the time I made cookies with them for special time <br/>
and wondered why that was what was special. amazing when it went to&quot;moms odd <br/>
meal&quot; lol pasta and every thing we can find and then deciding what to put in <br/>
for spices and vegggie  was a must. and nuts and so forth. our test was can we <br/>
make it fun for our mouths to eat?<br/>
  <br/>
well this is some tid bits that helped with my gorging child also have one that <br/>
is oppisit.<br/>
hope this isnt waqy to off base,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068782958">One thing I thought about is how you could get more calories into <br/>
something that tastes great. <br/>
<br/>
I have been making a huge batch of pancakes on Saturdays and <br/>
freezing them in little ziplocs so I can pull them out an just heat <br/>
and serve every morning w/o the big &quot;pancake production&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I make them with tons of good stuff and they turn out VERY yummy and <br/>
nutrient dense. I follow the recipe on the bag of Whole Wheat pastry <br/>
flour (Bob&#39;s Red Mill). I put extra stuff in them...smushed up <br/>
bananas, yogurt, sometimes blueberries, wheat germ, ground flax <br/>
seeds, milk, whatever...just get creative. I figure the yogurt and <br/>
milk boost the protein content and the flax seed well that has those <br/>
Omega-6&#39;s (oils etc), bananas add extra potassium, you get the <br/>
picture. Then we top them with a bit of maple syrup for the yummy <br/>
factor. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind so much that Chloe is satisfying her &quot;sweet tooth&quot; this <br/>
way and it gets some good stuff into her body in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Would this be an option in your household? I have also been known to <br/>
pack quite a bit of calories and proteins into a smoothie for <br/>
a &quot;treat&quot; also. Adding peanut butter, yogurt, flaxseed oil or ground <br/>
flax seeds, protein powders, etc. <br/>

<h4>coyote&#39;s corner</h4>
<time>23 Oct 2003, at  8:24am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844907071">Hi,<br/>
I was Zach 45 years ago; this is what many doctors and healers told us; &quot;She will eat when she&#39;s hungry.&quot;  For years, I was &#39;painfully&#39; thin. I wouldn&#39;t eat any veggies - except peas. I wouldn&#39;t eat any potatoes - except mashed. I never drank milk. We had no pastries or soda in the house (no money) My bio-father had a candy store on the corner - I ate candy...and lots of it...and those nickel bag of chips!!<br/>
My mom sort of let me go my own way....she fed me what I would eat and what I didn&#39;t want - I didn&#39;t want. There were some rules - no candy before a meal, no leaving the table until we were through (I&#39;d be gone after the peas were!) My mom just let it be.<br/>
I was rail thin!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually....things changed.<br/>
Honest.<br/>
<br/>
Janis (who has to lose 30 pounds!!!)<br/>
