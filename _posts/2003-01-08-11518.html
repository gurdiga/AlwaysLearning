Hi Marji - Thanks tons.  I knew I&#39;d get some mind-easing feedback from you<br/>
guys.  I&#39;m in a hs group near me composed of some pretty decent people, but<br/>
most of the kids are &quot;classically&quot; educated.  The only unschoolers in the<br/>
group are very young, so I have really nobody firsthand to talk to here.  As<br/>
for comparing my son to my daughter - I&#39;d say actually I&#39;m very good about<br/>
not doing that.. they&#39;ve been very different from each other always.  :)<br/>
And I have an 18 year old daughter as well who&#39;s different still.<br/>
<br/>
Plus my mom was very big (and still is) about &quot;comparing&quot; kids... making one<br/>
feel like less than wonderful because another has done something she feels<br/>
is superior.  Supposedly, this is motivational.  I know how damaging this<br/>
can be.  First it was me and my younger sister (2 years younger than me),<br/>
then it was my oldest daughter and my youngest sister (a year older than my<br/>
daughter), now it&#39;s my son and my neice (who&#39;s a year younger than he is and<br/>
of course a raging genious according to my mom.)  Luckily, I live very far<br/>
away, so the torment is directed at me and only by phone on the rare<br/>
occasions I talk to her.  I don&#39;t understand why she does this, but she<br/>
always has.  Needless to say I feel I can&#39;t go back &quot;home&quot; til my kids are<br/>
grown.  I love mom, but she&#39;s a terrible, ego-destroying influence.  And as<br/>
you may be able to guess, completely against this home schooling.  She&#39;d<br/>
probably charter a red-eye flight out here if she knew I was going so far as<br/>
to &quot;unschool&quot;.  (Can you say - the gates of hell have opened?)  lol... so<br/>
anyway... thank you!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear about the kinds of activities your son enjoys!  I&#39;m forever<br/>
looking for things to keep Jay entertained!  Thanks again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Sandra.  :)  I need all the support I can get.  lol.  This is such<br/>
new territory for me.  But like so many others who have discovered<br/>
unschooling, I feel very strong that this is the right answer.  I just need<br/>
to break my own bonds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473094823">Thank you EVERYONE who sent me their personal stories and links to articles<br/>
regarding the kids reading.  As you probably guessed if you caught my first<br/>
letter, I came from a background where academics were not only the most<br/>
important thing, they were the ONLY thing.  (I personally never got to take<br/>
any kind of art class, etc, when I was back in school - it was considered a<br/>
waste of time.  needless to say I never went on to college, though I wanted<br/>
to - wanted to take music, art, writing, foreign language - but since none<br/>
of these involved resulting in my ending up getting job that ended with MD<br/>
and making buttloads of money, it was not allowed - anyway, sorry bout the<br/>
mini rant)  I got some really good ideas too from your personal accounts as<br/>
well - more fun stuff to do.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t respond to each of you individually, but the last two<br/>
digests I received were so full of info - about reading and tons of other<br/>
stuff too, it&#39;s well nigh impossible for me to weed out the specific posts -<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d miss someone!  Then I&#39;d feel like a heel.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and I look forward to reading more.  I have another question -<br/>
does anyone else have to hide the method of schooling from their families?<br/>
if so, how do you deal with it?  I know on the surface the answer is<br/>
obvious, but how do you keep it from getting you down?  How do you keep it<br/>
from affecting you?  Really?  I know I&#39;m doing the right thing for my<br/>
kids... but I have absolutely nobody in my family who supports any of this.<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m on the lamb sometimes.  :)  In a way I am since I had to<br/>
leave the state to get away from the immediate family influence (meddling).<br/>
ugh.<br/>
<br/>
You guys are my calming influence, and for that I am grateful.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
what I&#39;d do without you!<br/>

Hi, Alyce --<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the state may be extreme, but is IS effective.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any really useful suggestions for you.  (Sorry)<br/>
<br/>
However, I will acknowledge that there ARE some unschoolers &quot;in the<br/>
closet&quot; and the closet isn&#39;t a very comfortable place to be.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Are you hiding &quot;unschooling&quot; or are you even hiding the fact that<br/>
you homeschool?  I wasn&#39;t sure.</div>
