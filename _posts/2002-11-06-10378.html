&gt; &lt;&lt; Is Universal Studios as hideous as I think its going to be? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went in California when Kirby and Marty were little and we had a GREAT<br/>
&gt; time!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you look at things through your kids&#39; eyes, lots of things will look<br/>
&gt; pretty new and exciting!<br/>

fun.<br/>
I liked the studio tour the best. My boys liked the studio tour, the<br/>
jurassic park ride, the E.T. ride and the back to the future ride, not<br/>
necessarily in that order. ;-)<br/>
