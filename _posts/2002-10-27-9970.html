&lt;&lt; Sandra, maybe you won&#39;t have to actually sue.  Someone in Columbia should <br/>
really go take pictures of that ramp, still wet I&#39;m sure, after all these <br/>
days.  Then what I would do is get a lawyer to write a demand letter, <br/>
demanding that they pay your expenses and fix the ramp. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes.  That was going to be the other letter.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Priss1000, I have photos of  me on the ramp, and it&#39;s clear that I <br/>
fell way before the puddle.  My foot doesn&#39;t even reach it.  And you can see <br/>
the really steep angle of the ramp too.<br/>
<br/>
So I want to write to the city inspector, and to the hotel, asking if they <br/>
have fixed that ramp and if they intend to, and depending on the responses I <br/>
get, I&#39;ll either be sweet and reasonable, or I&#39;ll have a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
How does it work, with me in one state and them in another, as lawyers go?<br/>
