<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031699264">&lt;&lt;I realized he is not ready to be in that kind of situation &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is HUGE!  Sorscha is 10 1/2 and we negotiate situations on a daily <br/>
basis.  There are simply things and situations that Sorscha is not prepared <br/>
or capable of being in at this time.  It&#39;s that simple.  I make sure that I <br/>
am almost always present.  If I cannot be present, I make sure that someone <br/>
I trust is.  By present I don&#39;t just mean that my adult body is there - I <br/>
mean that I am the mama eagle who is constantly observing my kiddo.  I can <br/>
be 50-yards away and know by my kiddos face if something is up.  This allows <br/>
me to &#39;catch&#39; things as they arise (before any blowout can occur -yes, they <br/>
still DO occur sometimes) and I can then help her to consider her options, <br/>
make choices, etc.   I don&#39;t leave Sorscha anywhere - even with other <br/>
unschooling families - where I do not feel that the parent is capable of <br/>
being observant enough for my kiddo.  She needs loving, kind, compassionate, <br/>
patient, adults who can speak to her calmly and frankly.  I also don&#39;t leave <br/>
Sorscha anywhere where she cannot contact me for assistance.  We also make <br/>
choices not to attend certain activities, leave early, or come late.  We <br/>
make these decisions together.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past couple of years, this has all gotten easier and I find that we <br/>
are approaching a time when Sorscha will be capable of socializing on her <br/>
own.  I&#39;m happy for her.  I&#39;m happy and grateful for all the years that I <br/>
have spent helping her to get to this point.  Years ago I was resentful that <br/>
Sorscha was not like &#39;those other kids&#39;.  I was always the Mom who some <br/>
other parent would come to and complain about my kid to.  My feelings were <br/>
often hurt and I&#39;d want to scream, &quot;CAN&#39;T YOU SEE THAT I&#39;M DOING EVERYTHING <br/>
I CAN!!! I&#39;m not oblivious!&quot;  I got to a point where I chose not to let it <br/>
fester in me and I put all that energy into helping Sorscha on her journey. <br/>
Now I receive compliments - it&#39;s a weird place to be when someone says, <br/>
&quot;Wow, Sorscha has come along way!&quot;  My return response is, &quot;It&#39;s all <br/>
Sorscha, not me. Just like she learned to read with my assistance, she&#39;s <br/>
learning how to negotiate her world with my assistance.&quot;<br/>
