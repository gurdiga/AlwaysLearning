<div id="ygrps-yiv-904530352">That whole article you printed made me sick to my stomache.<br/>
Knowing it exists and having to read about it are two different things, and <br/>
it made me physically ill.<br/>
What a bunch of sick, sick people. They feel justified in venting their anger <br/>
and meanness on their own children.<br/>
<br/>
As to spanking stuff, I will look around and see if I have anything useful <br/>
for the page.<br/>
I am so glad you&#39;re doing this, I know I can send people there that have <br/>
questions and it will be THOROUGH!! :)<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>

Ack!  Sorry.  You didn&#39;t HAVE to read it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry.<br/>

Didn&#39;t mean to ruin your morning.  (sorry.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702556691">I had meant for that to be the jittery edge of CHANGE, but both make about <br/>
the same sense.  Because I ran across that article accidently while looking <br/>
for something real to help me decide something about James Dobson.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281605668">His question and answer column runs once a week in our local newspaper.  I usually read it, because I want to hear what sort of horrible advice he is giving out.  I wonder how many readers in our area read it and take it as good advice.<br/>

YOU didn&#39;t.....I&#39;m glad someone here watches out for what those nuts are up <br/>
to.<br/>
I know when I get to a post like that, it&#39;s the dread/fascination thing. Like <br/>
going past a car wreck. I don&#39;t WANT to know what&#39;s there, but I can&#39;t help <br/>
looking. :)<br/>
I think I am overly empathetic sometimes.<br/>
I can&#39;t read about stuff like that and not picture the torture and pain of <br/>
the children. I actually see it in my head, I feel their pain, I hurt inside <br/>
when I read stuff like that.<br/>
But I want to be informed.<br/>
So I read anyway. sigh....<br/>
<br/>
We just watched &quot;Signs&quot; tonight. I blubbered like a baby more than once.<br/>
