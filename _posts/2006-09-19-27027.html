<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723964088">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
We may be moving to San Diego (remote chance but none the less) and I <br/>
am wondering how many unschooling families there are in San Diego. I <br/>
have posted on the San Diego Home Education yahoo group and had a few <br/>
very nice replies but thought more of you may be on unschooling groups <br/>
rather than local groups. Anyone? Thanks, Tonya</div>

There is an unschooling yahoo group, too, at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolSanDiego/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolSanDiego/</a><br/>
<br/>
I think the Unschool group has been planning a park day, but they all <br/>
seem to have little kids and I have old kids &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve been attending <br/>
Tecolote Park Day for many years; it could use some new faces.  Many of <br/>
the kids are going to charter homeschools now, and a few have opted for <br/>
regular high school.  There are a few unschoolers, and overall it&#39;s a <br/>
very inclusive group.<br/>
