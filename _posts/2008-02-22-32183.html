<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492498849">Is that what it is called?  After 40 years, I still stay up late and have trouble getting up in the morning. My mom always called it &quot;Being a night owl&quot;.<br/>

I guess I posted it just as another example of a natural part of life being<br/>
labeled as something needing to be<br/>
&#39;fixed&#39; with medication.   I was just so surprised to read about staying up<br/>

do on a regular basis, by the way - in just such a negative way & in such<br/>
black & white terms.<br/>

It&#39;s crazy, isn&#39;t it?  That preferences and personal differences  <br/>
become &quot;syndromes&quot; and &quot;disabilities&quot; and that?<br/>
