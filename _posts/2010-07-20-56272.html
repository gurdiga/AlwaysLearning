<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810056012">My 11yo son has always had a very hard time with the concept of &quot;STOP means<br/>
STOP&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
He has two younger brothers, 8 and 5, who want nothing more than to be his<br/>
friend and play with him.  When DS11 plays with them, it generally turns<br/>
into him doing something to the others, which they&#39;ll tolerate a time or<br/>
two, but then will tell him to stop.  DS11 doesn&#39;t, will continue on with<br/>
whatever behavior is bothering his brothers.<br/>
<br/>
Real life example from just 2 minutes ago...  I&#39;m putting the baby to sleep,<br/>
so was in the bedroom for just over 5 minutes.  I hear DS8 screech, yelling<br/>
something to DS11.  I come out right away to ask if everyone is ok.  DS8<br/>
says &quot;No, he just zapped me with that thing, two times, in the back&quot;  (the<br/>
&#39;thing&#39; is the filament from an automatic lighter, the thing that sparks to<br/>
make the lighter start, he&#39;s been taking them apart lately, and finding joy<br/>
in running around and zapping people who don&#39;t want to be zapped)  So, I<br/>
asked him for the zapper thing, because I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past 3 days (since he&#39;s started with the zapping gadget), I have<br/>
told him, firmly that Stop means Stop. period.  He always agrees, but then<br/>
will do it again.  Like I said in the first sentence, this has been part of<br/>
his personality since he was a toddler.  He just doesn&#39;t get, or doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to get, that other people have limits.<br/>
<br/>
I am frustrated and would like some suggestions on how to move forward in a<br/>
way that is equitable to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&<br/>
Unschooling neither gives anyone special rights, nor does it remove<br/>
any natural rights from people. If thinking about unschooling or any<br/>
special parenting philosophy is keeping you from protecting your<br/>
child, then that&#39;s too much thinking and too little being in the<br/>
moment directly.<br/>
&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&<br/>
<br/>
When I read this statement that Sandra wrote recently, it reminded me of<br/>
me.  I feel like I&#39;m so much in my head sometimes, thinking &quot;oh, is this an<br/>
unschooly thing to do?  I can&#39;t be too firm, because I&#39;m supposed to be open<br/>
and relaxed...&quot; and then I end up feeling like I&#39;m being a very permissive<br/>
parent, to the detriment of my children.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m so afraid of pissing<br/>
them off, that I end up just letting them do whatever they want.  Reading<br/>
here is absolutely, definitely helping me to begin to clarify things,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much for your help...<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have &quot;asked him&quot; for it.  I might have just taken it.  If  <br/>
he objected, perhaps a &quot;are you sure it doesn&#39;t hurt?&quot;  And offer to  <br/>
zap him, or ask him to show you, by zapping himself.    But I would  <br/>
get it further disassembled so it couldn&#39;t be taken out of the trash  <br/>
and say  &quot;We don&#39;t let you take things apart so you can make weapons.   <br/>
Don&#39;t do that anymore.&quot;  But not in a nicey-nice mom way, in a &quot;I&#39;m  <br/>
not even kind of kidding&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
He still has it?  WHY?<br/>
<br/>
-=-, I have told him, firmly that Stop means Stop. period. He always  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s because stop doesn&#39;t mean stop period at your house.  It means  <br/>
don&#39;t do this or I shall come and speak with you again.  And again.   <br/>
And again.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He just doesn&#39;t get, or doesn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
Do you ever yell at him?  Do you ever cry?<br/>
Have you advised the other kids to scream as loud as they can and that  <br/>
you will come and save them immediately from whatever horror is  <br/>
befalling them even if it&#39;s their brother?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am frustrated and would like some suggestions on how to move  <br/>
forward in a<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Equitable&quot;?  Is that one of the principles you&#39;re going for?  I would  <br/>
think &quot;safe&quot; before &quot;equitable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel like I&#39;m so much in my head sometimes, thinking &quot;oh, is this  <br/>

<br/>
Where are the principles in that?  Being and unschooler shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
include the principle &quot;act like an unschooler.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Learning.<br/>
Safety.<br/>
Communication.<br/>
Relationships.<br/>
<br/>
What are your own priorities?    Make decisions based on whether what  <br/>
you decide will take you closer to your principles, not whether it  <br/>
will seem more like unschooling to you.<br/>

<br/>
One of the things I&#39;ve noticed with my almost 7-year old daughter is that she &#39;remembers,&#39; for lack of a better word, what is okay and not okay much better when she has as much of my attention as she needs/wants.  <br/>
<br/>
She used to &quot;play&quot; with one of our cats past the point of it being comfortable for the cat.  She &#39;knew&#39; where the line was, but would cross it when I was too busy with something else to notice she was getting close to that mark.  Once the point of no return had been crossed, it was/is really important for her is to get some intense me time (time that should have, in hind-sight, come sooner).  <br/>
<br/>
If all this happened just two minutes ago, this time might be better spent reconnecting with your older son as opposed to posting here (you can do that later). <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My daughter took a homeschooler class at a museum last year and during one of the guided walks through the gallery, two brothers who were around 7 and 9 yrs. old started climbing on one of the sculptures.  They had to duck under a rope to get to it--it was clearly not an interactive instillation--and the docent had reminded everyone just a few minutes earlier not to touch the art.  The boys&#39; mom smiled at me as her kids tackled the sculpture and said, rather proudly: &quot;We&#39;re still deschooling.&quot;  She didn&#39;t say a word to her kids.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily the docent jumped in and told the boys to get down.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Deschooling&quot; and &quot;unschooling&quot; aren&#39;t synonymous with inobservance of all of society&#39;s &#39;rules&#39; (only some ;)).  The mom at the museum was doing her boys a disservice--she wasn&#39;t helping them participate in living a principled life.  Nor were they being given the opportunity to learn what museum behavior looks like.  If you let your son hurt your other children, because you&#39;re afraid of saying &#39;No&#39; to his behavior, you&#39;re also saying &#39;No&#39; to the principal of safety and you aren&#39;t giving any of them the chance to learn that hurting others isn&#39;t okay and that bigger people help watch out for littler ones.<br/>
<br/>
I understand wanting to stay focused on the &quot;Yes.&quot;  If need be, reframe the situation in your mind so you are focusing on a &quot;Yes&quot; to the principal (in this case safety)--even if that must involve a &#39;no&#39; or a &#39;stop.&#39;<br/>

**************<br/>
<br/>
My older child Eli (9) can be very similar.  He gets &quot;grabby&quot; at times.  There <br/>
are two, really three things we do to help him.  First of all we stay very <br/>
close.  We are almost never out of earshot of him, or we are in an open space <br/>
and can see him.  It helps we have a very small house, but we do make this a <br/>
priority.  Second, we make sure he gets lots of physical time with us.  Today he <br/>
sat on my lap at the movies, yesterday we wrestled in the bedroom, etc.  Third, <br/>
we feed him meat at least once and normally twice a day.  For him it makes a <br/>
HUGE difference in his behavior.  Cheese works too and I&#39;m working at finding a <br/>
nut he likes.  What he eats has a large influence in how he behaves.  <br/>

*****<br/>
I don&#39;t think not helping a kid to get along with others does them any type of <br/>
favors.  Eli sometimes needs help seeing how he comes across to others and <br/>
sometimes he just needs to be removed.  <br/>
<br/>

Sorry, I&#39;ll try to write more later, but he is up and wants to talk.<br/>

<br/>
How firm should one say STOP?  One of the neighbor kids has been getting in <br/>
trouble with me a lot lately because he doesn&#39;t stop when people ask or tell him <br/>
to.  I really don&#39;t like being a hard ass at all, I don&#39;t like getting into a <br/>
child&#39;s face and telling them to &quot;stop now or leave&quot;.  I want my own kids and <br/>
other guests in my house to feel safe being here.  If one person is making it <br/>
unsafe or unpleasant, then that one person needs to stop.<br/>
<br/>
If one child is causing the problem and you piss him off by taking away an item <br/>
that&#39;s hurting others, the other children certainly won&#39;t be pissed off.  Be <br/>
firm for those kids.  Obviously you can&#39;t make you oldest child leave, but you <br/>
can make him stop.  Don&#39;t ask after the first time, be blunt and direct.  Get in <br/>
the middle and block.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you have a scientist on your hands here, so impress it upon him that his <br/>
test subjects can&#39;t be unwilling participants in the form of younger siblings. <br/>
 They aren&#39;t monkeys, and even then, there are ethical issues in using animals <br/>
for testing and experimenting.  You could make it formal, have the younger <br/>
siblings be required to get parental signatures for any kind of testing.  I&#39;m <br/>
half joking.<br/>
