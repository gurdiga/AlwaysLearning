<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570327943">Being with your children, in the moment, involved totally in their lives is<br/>
a very special thing indeed.  Life is very precious.  A message I try to<br/>
remind myself of daily.<br/>
<br/>
My son was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago and I&#39;m on several lists<br/>
dealing with that.  All the school issues that come up and I want to scream,<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t send them away!  Spend time with your child!  School isn&#39;t<br/>
everything!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry for your loss.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I want to scream at people!<br/>
But I just quietly say how glad I am we had him home with us and <br/>
didn&#39;t waste any of his time.  I&#39;m so much more sensitive to it now.  <br/>
I always felt it was sad people didn&#39;t want to be with their kids <br/>
like I do, but I accepted everyone having their limits.  People try <br/>
to portray me as this great mom because I actually liked being with <br/>
my kids.  I&#39;m not a great mom.  I&#39;m a good mom, and my feelings <br/>
should be seen as absolutely normal, not the exception.<br/>
I can&#39;t even imagine how insane it must all seem to you Janet.<br/>

Thomas is 7 weeks away from finishing chemo (2 1/2 years worth, weekly dr<br/>
visits and much more).  Recently he had his Make-A-Wish trip to Florida<br/>
(Disney World) and all Wish kids to Florida stay at a wonderful place called<br/>
Give Kids The World (www.gktw.org).  Strange to say, but after seeing the<br/>
other kids there and their various life-threatening illnesses, we consider<br/>
ourselves very lucky that Thomas *only* has leukemia.  I can&#39;t imagine what<br/>
you are going through.  I am so sorry for your loss.<br/>
