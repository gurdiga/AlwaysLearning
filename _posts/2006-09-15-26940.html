<div id="ygrps-yiv-378104735">Awesome!<br/>
Josh just tweaked his excel spreadsheet that keeps up with his  <br/>
earnings, because today he discovered at Nintendo.com that there is a  <br/>
definite date and price for the new Nintendo Wii (and anyone who was  <br/>
cornered by him at the conference should know details about it, it is  <br/>
def his passion right now) So he has up to $230 saved, and today  <br/>
realized that he did NOT figure in tax, plus an additional  <br/>
controller, because who wants to play by themselves? However, he has  <br/>
an additional three weeks in which to make said money. He also  <br/>
realized that mom wanted his old one, and was willing to pay cash to  <br/>
buy it for the girls to have, and also that he could finagle an  <br/>
additional 10% out of me to guarantee not to sell it at game xchange.  <br/>
Smart, huh? I love video games!<br/>
