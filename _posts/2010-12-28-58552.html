<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147412509">I was reading an interview with Rudi Schenker of the Scorpions, which  <br/>
seems pretty far from unschooling and since he&#39;s German it&#39;s not even  <br/>
allowed! ;-) But he wrote a book, Rock Your Life, to inspire people to  <br/>
do what they love because that&#39;s how he&#39;s lived his life. (Or inspire  <br/>
Germans since it isn&#39;t translated yet.) It sounded so much like  <br/>
unschooling all the way through and what unschoolers&#39; lives can look  <br/>
like after unschooling. I think he&#39;d &quot;get&quot; unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And everybody told me “You guys… what do you want to do when you are  <br/>
&gt; thirty”? And I said “It’s not important what I’ll do when I’m  <br/>
&gt; thirty, it’s important what I’m doing now”!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I feel very good, making music; enjoy every day by doing what  <br/>
&gt; I’m doing. Like Buddha said “The way is the goal”! That’s the point!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What most people don’t understand… They think that here is the magic  <br/>
&gt; moment… The magic moment is every day!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was reading the paper; there was a very important star from  <br/>
&gt; Germany who said “If you want to be successful you have to work your  <br/>
&gt; ass off”! I remember I went to my girlfriend and said “Look. I think  <br/>
&gt; I know what I have to do. I’ll tell people not to work their ass  <br/>
&gt; off”… Do what you like to do! Have fun and the money comes by itself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not everybody becomes a Rockstar, no! It’s only a way that the  <br/>
&gt; Scorpions did everything wrong in the beginning, to find out at the  <br/>
&gt; end that they did everything right! Most people listen to other  <br/>
&gt; people about what they have to do. Look inside and you will find out  <br/>
&gt; what to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like Paolo Coelho… He was 40 when he decided he wanted to be an  <br/>
&gt; author. His mother said “What? Your father is an architect, your  <br/>
&gt; uncle is a doctor! And you want to do something which can’t bring  <br/>
&gt; any money… That’s wrong”!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That’s the reason I wrote the book. I wanted to give the people an  <br/>
&gt; example, if you believe in yourself… Most people make decisions  <br/>
&gt; because of the money… Then you are the slave of money! No fun  <br/>
&gt; anymore… People who want only money, they are never happy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know, our first roadie… he had no job, he wanted to be a roadie.  <br/>
&gt; He had to carry 20 speakers to the stage, he was working like crazy  <br/>
&gt; but he was happy! We drove together in a bus and he was a part of  <br/>
&gt; it! Now he has his own house!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I see so many guitar players that they are so much better than me…  <br/>
&gt; but they don’t realize what they have… They are never happy… That’s  <br/>
&gt; the book, with stories and how I came into the music… But the key  <br/>
&gt; point is to inspire people… “Rock your life” is kick your ass, do  <br/>
&gt; what you want to do and believe in you!<br/>
