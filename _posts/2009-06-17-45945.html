<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361477401">hi all<br/>
i&#39;m new here too - and from israel. been homeschooling (to others) but really unschooling for almost 9 months now. i&#39;m still very much finding my feet (perhaps that&#39;s why i&#39;m often barefoot??).<br/>
<br/>
as the new school year approaches, i got a little panicky - am i doing the right thing? i worry about my 11 year old son&#39;s withdrawl. i know he wants to be &#39;part of something&#39;. where we live, there aren&#39;t many homeschoolers - and you can&#39;t force connections with those that are there. my daughter, who is 9 1/2, is tg, thriving.<br/>
<br/>
oftentimes i still panic - in my heart, brain, gut; i know it&#39;s the best choice; but sometimes i just feel sooooooooooo overwhelmed.... oh, btw, i&#39;m also a single parent.<br/>
<br/>
days (actually, months) go by without english/math etc....and the G-d bless jewish guilt - wham bam, i feel it!! is this &quot;normal&quot; for a beginner? readjusting to the paradigm?<br/>
<br/>
in love, light and the freedom and dignity of our children;<br/>
kerri :-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121377347">-=-days (actually, months) go by without english/math etc...-=-<br/>
<br/>
No way!   Days don&#39;t go by without people using language, or measuring  <br/>
or counting or figuring out whether one deal is better than another,  <br/>
or keeping scores in games or building something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-is this &quot;normal&quot; for a beginner? readjusting to the paradigm?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely, but the adjustment is all in the mom, at first.   When you  <br/>
begin to see what math and language look like in the dark and in the  <br/>
car and while watching a movie, then you&#39;ll laugh at the idea that you  <br/>
wrote and posted &quot;days go by without english/math etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re thinking days or months have gone by without a LESSON in  <br/>
English or math, and if so, good!!<br/>
<br/>
But have days or months gone by without you yourself using them?  Or  <br/>
without your children asking a question about either of them?<br/>
<br/>
If so, this might help:<br/>
