I know you probably weren&#39;t referring to people like me, but I believe my<br/>
daughter is along the lines of sensory Integration dysfunction and we are<br/>
seeking, not a diagnosis, but a treatment.  Not to demean her, but so that<br/>
we can find out ways that I can help her deal with things like anger without<br/>
hurting others.  I could care less about the diagnosis.  I want to be able<br/>
to help her.  I hope that makes sense.<br/>
