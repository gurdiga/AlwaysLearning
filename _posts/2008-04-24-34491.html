<br/>
The same way a child can learn to trust that he can learn things.  By  <br/>
learning them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can learn to trust yourself to provide by providing.   <br/>
Experiment.  Add to.  Gain experience and confidence.  It will come  <br/>
easier and easier until it&#39;s second nature, if you make decisions  <br/>
with that goal in mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774433040">~~How can I learn to trust myself better?~~<br/>
<br/>
This is the KEY question!! Once we realize this and start asking this<br/>
question, it really changes the perspective and helps us SEE how we<br/>
don&#39;t trust our children because we don&#39;t trust ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is a big journey, one I&#39;m still on and probably will be for the<br/>
rest of my life. I think I really TRUST myself and believe in my<br/>
ability to do most anything. Then something will come along to show me<br/>
that there is STILL some shred of doubt, some nagging fear that is<br/>
deeply embedded and I question all over again.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of my favorite John Holt quotes: &quot;To trust children we must<br/>
first learn to trust ourselves...and most of us were taught as<br/>
children that we could not be trusted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The main lesson that schools and adults left us with is that we can<br/>
NOT be trusted. We must be taught. We must trust the experts. We are<br/>
left devoid of a true connection with our powerful inner voice. In<br/>
regaining that connection, we can truly honor and trust our children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just yesterday a friend and I were discussing what we thought of as a distilling &quot;factor&quot; <br/>
that must be present for unschooling/mindful parenting to be successful.  The factor that <br/>
came up was TRUST.  With trust, the world opens up, horizons expand and life can seem <br/>
exciting and limitless.  Without trust, the world shuts down, gets narrow and petty.  Each <br/>
moment matters in the wrong way.  I want more expansiveness in my life, not less.  <br/>
<br/>
And the expansive quality of trust grows out from the center to touch every part of our <br/>
lives.  Trust that we ARE capable and that we will, through our honest endeavor, figure out <br/>
a way.  Trust that our children will find, ask or be provided with what they need, trust that <br/>
they are in connection with us by their own choosing and free will--not through <br/>
&quot;enforcing.&quot;  And trust that they will grow up loving and caring and interesting people <br/>
without being &quot;taught.&quot;<br/>

I liked all of it.  I don&#39;t like to think of trusting in a person.  I  <br/>
like to think of trusting in the process of learning, and trust in  <br/>
the benefit of living by principles.  It can get back to the people.<br/>
<br/>
There are two problems I&#39;ve seen with &quot;trust&quot; when people think it  <br/>
means &quot;trust&quot; blindly, or trust without effort.<br/>
<br/>
First problem:  Some people want to trust that their kids will learn  <br/>
just because they left them alone and peeked in once in a while.  And  <br/>
I&#39;ve often heard someone defend such laxness with &quot;Anything&#39;s better  <br/>
than school&quot; which is a cop-out and a defense of the listless and lazy.<br/>
<br/>
And some people hear us talking about &quot;trust yourself&quot; and they have  <br/>
no clear idea what that means, but they decide to &quot;trust themselves&quot;  <br/>
even though every few days they&#39;re getting out a curriculum, and  <br/>
they&#39;re yelling at their kids or waiting for them to &quot;develop a  <br/>
primary interest.&quot;  Just waiting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second problem is bigger for some people and nothing to others.   <br/>
It has to do with heresy.  Not social heresy or school heresy,  <br/>
Christian heresy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s humanism.<br/>
<br/>
To say that a person can be trusted to unfold in peace and goodness  <br/>
is plain old heresy.  And it&#39;s the reason some Christians say that  <br/>
other Christians can&#39;t be unschoolers, or that unschooling itself is  <br/>
un- or anti-Christian.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think a lot depends on how interesting you see the world.  I feel like<br/>
I provide a rich and supportive environment, but it&#39;s not always full of<br/>
curious active doings and goings on.  Sometimes there are lulls and<br/>
nobody seems to be doing anything.  We&#39;ve had times of boredom and<br/>
inactivity.<br/>
<br/>
These lulls are times that I actively look for opportunities because I<br/>
know following every lull is an intense period of activity.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to miss those things, so I look for them.  After enough down time<br/>
and feelings of boredom everyone is ready for new things.  When they are<br/>
ready, I don&#39;t want to be stuck with nothing to offer, so I always try<br/>
to have things to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Can you trust yourself enough to relax and see what your kids are doing,<br/>
really doing.  Can you trust yourself to expand on those things.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, 14, is very interested in scary movies right now, so<br/>
we&#39;ve been going to the video store a lot.  If I didn&#39;t see that as<br/>
learning opportunities, we wouldn&#39;t be heading to the video store every<br/>
week looking for videos that meet the scary criteria.  I also keep in<br/>
mind that life isn&#39;t all dark and scary, nor do my kids see it that way,<br/>
so I am careful to select many other light and fun things to go along<br/>
with all the dark and scary.  It&#39;s a part of recognizing an interest and<br/>
encouraging it and adding to it.<br/>
<br/>
If life is interesting and you see it that way, it is the difference<br/>
between just watching a movie or watching a movie and then watching the<br/>
special features and checking out things online and finding similar<br/>
movies that lead to other things that lead to other things.</div>

as learning opportunities, but it does sound contrived when put in that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
All of the world is interesting and full of learning opportunites, that<br/>
is why unschooling can work if you see everything as interesting. <br/>
Learning  is a side effect of exploring all those interesting things.</div>

<br/>
Humanists can be Christians.  They just can&#39;t be good fundamentalist  <br/>
Christians.  (Nor good medieval Catholics.)<br/>
<br/>
The belief that children are born sinful and have to be saved from  <br/>
their inevitable path to hell is central to much Christianity.  Not  <br/>
all, but any Christian who isn&#39;t aware of it shouldn&#39;t stand and  <br/>
argue with me.  Look it up.  Look around.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The belief that children are born good and pure and with the  <br/>
potential to be happy and to blossom goes against certain passages of  <br/>
the Bible.  Seeing it with our own eyes, having what seems to us to  <br/>
be &quot;proof&quot; is covered by other Bible verses.<br/>
<br/>
I myself believe children are born pure and good, with genetic  <br/>
propensities that can cause problems, and I believe any child, no  <br/>
matter how good, can be controlled and shamed and punished to the  <br/>
point that he &quot;goes bad&quot; to some extent.  I don&#39;t &quot;study&quot; humanism or  <br/>
&quot;subscribe&quot; to it, I just happen to know from years of exposure to  <br/>
various arguments and bits of history that it&#39;s sinful to consider  <br/>
that people can be moral without following the rules of Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
When all the homeschoolers online were a smaller pool of people (not  <br/>
the ocean they are now), someone asked me in a discussion why, if we  <br/>
didn&#39;t believe in hell, would my children ever be good?  How could  <br/>
they have morals if we weren&#39;t Christian?  From her point of view it  <br/>
was a valid question.  She honestly had no idea [though maybe she  <br/>
expected the answer to be &quot;DOH!  You&#39;re right.  They can&#39;t.  I&#39;ll  <br/>
change everything right now,&quot; or maybe for me to burst into tears get  <br/>
Baptized (again).]<br/>
<br/>
I explained to her why people would want to be good, what it was good  <br/>
for, even for agnostics and athiests.  It was news to her, and she  <br/>
took it well, and thought about it.<br/>
<br/>
The saddest part is that she thought up to that point is that the  <br/>
only reason her children were ever good was fear of punishment or  <br/>
fear of hell.   (Church of Christ, for the record; California.  Not  <br/>
Baptists in Arkansas, in that instance.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I spent the first three years of homeschooling my daughter (preschool, <br/>
K and 1st grade) trying to find the best approach.  It was very <br/>
frustrating as I tried different methods, none of which ever seemed <br/>
right.  There was always something missing.  Nothing ever &quot;felt&quot; <br/>
right.  I tried a Christian program, then unit studies (Konos), then <br/>
Montessori, and finally, Charlotte Mason.  While googling CM <br/>
approaches, I came across unschooling and began investigating.  <br/>
<br/>
So here I am, 7 months later, and this approach &quot;feels&quot; so right.  <br/>
As I delve into the philosophy of unschooling and apply it to our <br/>
lives, I have begun to question other areas of my life -- not just the <br/>
schooling aspect.  I&#39;ve begun to question the role of mainstream <br/>
Christianity in my life.  <br/>
<br/>
I was raised with the typical belief that you have to be good or you <br/>
will go to Hell.  Couple that with an abusive, manipulative, <br/>
controlling mother and you can bet I&#39;ve got lots of hang-ups.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a typical thing to go through as an unschooling parent?  Did <br/>
most of you at some point begin questioning your belief system?  How <br/>
did you deal with the guilt (I have such a tremendous amount right now) <br/>
and the fear of doing the wrong thing and landing yourself in Hell?<br/>
<br/>
I tried talking to my husband, but it frankly scares him to hear me <br/>
talk in such a way.  He thinks I should just quit thinking about it and <br/>
go on to church and leave things alone.  I wouldn&#39;t dare talk to my <br/>
mother-in-law.  Not only would she have a major cow, she would worry <br/>
herself sick that I was leading her son and her grandchildren astray.  <br/>
My mother is out of the question as is anyone in our congregation.<br/>
<br/>
I still know in my heart that I am a Christian, but things just don&#39;t <br/>
seem right anymore.  Somehow, I don&#39;t think that Jesus would approve of <br/>
what churches have become and how manipulative and conrolling they are.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this subject is inappropriate for this list, and if so, I <br/>
apologize.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125663508">~~Is this a typical thing to go through as an unschooling parent? Did<br/>
most of you at some point begin questioning your belief system? How<br/>
did you deal with the guilt (I have such a tremendous amount right now)<br/>
and the fear of doing the wrong thing and landing yourself in Hell?~~<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty typical to &quot;wake up&quot; and continue waking up for<br/>
the rest of your life. Once we realize we can question everything we<br/>
thought was &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, it&#39;s a snowball effect. It&#39;s called<br/>
thinking for yourself.:)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re in that no man&#39;s (or woman&#39;s in this case) land where you<br/>
aren&#39;t sure of certain things and it feels a bit like casting about<br/>
without a foundation anymore. I remember.<br/>
<br/>
What I found out, is that as I grew in confidence and felt the need to<br/>
question everything (even my firmly entrenched Christian beliefs) I<br/>
became a person with peace. Real peace. Not the kind of peace the<br/>
church offered which was actually constant torment about hell, but the<br/>
kind of peace that is about being OK with not knowing! Cool place<br/>
actually.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider myself a Christian any longer, nor do I live in any<br/>
kind of fear (except maybe the fear that the world may run out of<br/>
truffles someday).:)<br/>
<br/>
All I can say, is unschooling blossoms best when people question<br/>
things, even their own beliefs. Unschooling works best when we are<br/>
willing to turn things upside down and all around and examine it from<br/>
many angles. It works best when kids are free to question things and<br/>
not get a judgemental response but a curious adult to explore with<br/>
them...especially on topics like religion and spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
I started reading a lot of history that didn&#39;t mesh with what I&#39;d been<br/>
taught all those years before, and came to conclusions that seem a lot<br/>
more based on reality than belief. <br/>
<br/>
Wherever you&#39;re at in your questioning, I think you&#39;ll really love a<br/>
book that I&#39;m reading right now. It&#39;s titled &quot;Dance of the Dissident<br/>
Daughter&quot; by Sue Monk Kidd. Great way to help shift some of your<br/>
questioning and need to stretch beyond the confines of what you&#39;ve<br/>
been taught all your life. I highly recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling facilitates great healing...this seems to be part of your<br/>
process. Enjoy the journey!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409613560">Melissa wrote about questioning the role of mainstream Christianity in her<br/>
life. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are certain avenues of exploration that lead naturally to questioning.<br/>
Maybe all avenues of exploration do - ultimately... Certainly, unschooling<br/>
is one. Parelli horse training is another. A person begins by saying &quot;I want<br/>
to apply this thing in this an area&quot; , but doesn&#39;t realise that the<br/>
application of the thing is going to result in a major paradigm shift that<br/>
is going to affect many (all???) other areas of their living as well. So<br/>
they proceed to implement the initial decision, and then they become aware<br/>
of the paradigm shift challenge, and find themselves at a crossroads of<br/>
sorts. What now? For many it is too scary, too painful, to insecure to<br/>
continue, and so they turn back. Sometimes the turning back is dramatic (&quot;I<br/>
tried that and it doesn&#39;t work/is rubbish/is heresy/is dangerous&quot; or<br/>
whatever other trumped up excuse alleviates the stress...); sometimes it is<br/>
wistful (&quot;I would have liked to have gone down that road but it is too<br/>
difficult/I don&#39;t have the time/I am too afraid to try/It is too hard to<br/>
make a change now&quot;). Sometimes there is a denial that there ever was a<br/>
choice made and turned back upon.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Fear is powerful. We are so afraid of consequences. School helped to teach<br/>
us that the one thing you should never do is mess up. Don&#39;t fail. Don&#39;t make<br/>
mistakes. Parents that can&#39;t be accepting and loving in the face of<br/>
disappointment and difference make us afraid of disappointing and of being<br/>
different. Etc, etc, etc. One could spend many hours analysing why one is<br/>
afraid. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Melissa picks up on the &#39;fear of hell&#39; aspect. How grateful I am that that<br/>
is one fear that has never ruled me. I would chuck that fear where it<br/>
belongs.... easier said than done, I know... because I am a Christian, I<br/>
would spend a lot of time reading the Bible to see what it really says (as<br/>
opposed to what people say the Bible says) about God and His loving kindness<br/>
to find the courage I needed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It takes courage to face ones fears and to explore anyway. As a horse rider,<br/>
trained traditionally in a Germanic riding style, and who used to &#39;do&#39;<br/>
Dressage, Parelli stripped me painfully naked. I didn&#39;t even have anywhere<br/>
to hide - my 15 year old daughter &#39;horse whisperer natural&#39; was watching<br/>
with unsympathetic and critical eyes. What would I do? I spent months crying<br/>
in a corner while my pony grazed peacefully in his paddock. Eventually I<br/>
faced the facts - I couldn&#39;t go back, because Pat Parelli&#39;s thinking  had<br/>
changed me - I had been to one of his conferences and seen what he did with<br/>
his horses, and there was no other way to go anymore. I had to go forward or<br/>
get out of riding. Soooo... I am going forward. And you know what? I am<br/>
finding the freedom. Yesterday I went for a hack; cantered down a long<br/>
stretch without my hands even on the reins, much less taking up a contact.<br/>
It was one of those &#39;wow&#39; moments that make the struggle to be born worth<br/>
it. Know what I mean???<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling was the same. In 2001 we began what we called an &#39;unschooling<br/>
experiment&#39;. As time went by, I also knew that there was no going back. I<br/>
had read John Holt&#39;s books. And I saw that he was right.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Questioning of any sort is tough. It provokes growth. It forces<br/>
confrontation with who we are and with who we really hope to be. It makes us<br/>
let go of stuff that we thought we needed and have lugged along for so long<br/>
that the letting go leaves one feeling so vulnerable.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Questions about religious faith are particularly tough. Faith is supposed to<br/>
be the foundation after all. What will happen if I destabilize my<br/>
foundation? How will I survive such a shaking???<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am a Christian. I find myself secure in the knowledge that God loves me.<br/>
My confidence is not in what I believe, but in Him. It is not my belief that<br/>
holds me in my place; it is the powerful certainty that I am in His hands,<br/>
that He will not let me go, that He will finish the work He has begun in me.<br/>
Questioning strengthened my faith, and with it, my peace. For others,<br/>
questioning results in a letting go. Maybe because they had not found a<br/>
faith of their own; it was somebody else&#39;s faith that they were holding.<br/>
Ultimately, although others can help us along the way, and give us their<br/>
faith to lean on for a while, we have to establish our own<br/>
faith/belief/conviction about the meaning of life, Who and What God is, and<br/>
how to live in this world. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have had to face the turmoil of questioning whether it was acceptable to<br/>
be both a Christian and an unschooler. It was a cliff edge. I cast myself on<br/>
His grace and leapt. I have discovered (am discovering) that truly, it was<br/>
for freedom that Christ set us free. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jesus was not afraid of freedom. I see this when I look at the stories<br/>
written about Him in the Gospels. Things He said and did. He dared to<br/>
challenge the conventions and thinking of the day. Sure, it got Him killed<br/>
in the end. But what freedom and peace and joy He bought with that dying. I<br/>
am one who still feasts on it. In my case, Christianity led me into<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is not wrong to ask questions. It is a false guilt that says that it is.<br/>
You find it everywhere - not just in religion. My brother in law says that<br/>
he hopes for our sakes that we will not live to regret the educational<br/>
choices we have made for our children. Guilt and shame accompany his point<br/>
of view. It is up to me to accept it or to reject it. I don&#39;t have to be<br/>
guilty.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One very real concern is that Melissa&#39;s husband is reacting negatively. Will<br/>
he cope with her questioning? Will he have the courage to face the questions<br/>
himself, or will he continue to maintain his comfort zone? Is it important<br/>
enough to her to take the risk of destabilising her marriage? How strong is<br/>
the marriage - will it cope??? It also sounds like there is unlikely to be a<br/>
supportive or sympathetic response from the extended family. Is it worth<br/>
rocking the boat so hard? These are tough questions that only she can<br/>
answer. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Finally, Melissa commented: &gt;&gt;&gt;Somehow, I don&#39;t think that Jesus would<br/>
approve of what churches have become and how manipulative and conrolling<br/>
they are.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this statement. As unschoolers, hubby, kids, and I all find<br/>
ourselves with ambivalent feelings about church. We like the singing and the<br/>
worship, the Bible teaching in our church is great, we enjoy the feeling of<br/>
getting together with other Christians. But, we actively dislike the feeling<br/>
of being organised, slotted into our place, ticked off on the list. We cause<br/>
the church leadership a few problems as we just don&#39;t fit in a neat little<br/>
box... We are individuals first, then part of a group. Church often feels<br/>
like the order of priority is the other way around. I suppose this is true<br/>
of many groups. Somehow, church is &#39;supposed&#39; to be different though...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My thoughts on the matter...<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Oh Absoultely I did begin to question my belief system.  One of the books<br/>
that I read that helped me to sort out what I believed or did not believe<br/>
was &quot;Conversations With God&quot; by Neale Donald Walsch.  I found I certainly<br/>
didn&#39;t agree with everything he wrote but some of the questions he asked<br/>
were also questions I had and as I read the book and sorted out what I<br/>
believed I came to feel a sense of peace with my own beliefs.  Ren said it<br/>
well.  Real Peace.  And it&#39;s a very cool place, for sure.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Before I came to that place, I walked aroudn with a lot of guilt.  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
even aware of how much guilt I was carrying until I let it all go and felt<br/>
an enormous sense of peace.  I even sat down with my pastor and talked about<br/>
things that I felt were inconsistant between Christianity and just being a<br/>
good person and I was pleasantly surprised to find that she shared my ideas<br/>
even though they were inconsistant with what a lot of us had been taught.<br/>
She said it was difficult to talk about some of these things in sermons<br/>
because people don&#39;t take change well but that she tried in little ways to<br/>
open people&#39;s minds more and more without shaking their whole foundations.<br/>
I stopped going to church at that point (probably 8 years ago) because I<br/>
realized that even though I enjoyed parts of it, I really went out of a<br/>
sense of guilt.  I may attend a church again some day but for now it doesn&#39;t<br/>
fit in my life and that&#39;s okay with me.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if there is a term that describes or sums up what I believe.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not a Christian in most Christian&#39;s eyes but I do feel that God<br/>
is part of this world in some way and I do believe that people who are able<br/>
to give up their worries to some higher power (or just unburden themselves<br/>
of them somehow) can feel more peaceful than those who carry too much<br/>
baggage around all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, the only time I feel guilty about anything religion related is<br/>
when I visit one relative who, if she knew how I felt, would carry the<br/>
burden of worry for my soul.  I conceal what I believe when conversations<br/>
turn toward religion because I feel like she carries enough guilt for us all<br/>
and I don&#39;t want to place anymore burden on her.  I know she does NOT want<br/>
to question anything because it would rock her world too much.  <br/>

  &lt;&lt;Is this a typical thing to go through as an unschooling parent? Did <br/>
  most of you at some point begin questioning your belief system? How <br/>
  did you deal with the guilt (I have such a tremendous amount right now) <br/>
  and the fear of doing the wrong thing and landing yourself in Hell?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling, for me, has been the open door/path to many improvements in my life.  While I first started exploring and implementing unschooling because it meshed with our parenting philosophy, it opened so many other doors that have provided many benefits.  Unschooling helped my husband and me in our marriage (without paying a counselor), it helped us as a family, it helped me to accept myself and the biggest thing of all, as I learned to trust my children I learned to trust myself.  And that finally gave me the courage to ask those very tough, frightening question and look within myself for answers.  I&#39;ve been going through a long period of deconstructing my faith, and for the first time I can recall, I&#39;m at peace.  And it did start with unschooling.  I would think that other people have had the same experience.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t know what to say to you about feeling guilt.  In my experience, guilt is part of the religious experience.  As you keep questioning and learning to listen to yourself, I think that feeling of guilt will go away and you will find peace.  For me peace came from listening to myself.<br/>
<br/>
  My dh isn&#39;t exactly on the same page with me, either.  While he has most of the same questions I do, he&#39;s not one to rock the boat and is more apt to remain status quo.  I think it helps when you have someone to talk with.  Do you have a friend who is open to listening to you talk about faith, and not one who is going to try to convert you?  When I started questioning Christianity and religion, most of my women friends started praying for me, then vocally telling me the right thing - according to them - and finally, dropping my friendship.  So ultimately I was alone.  And maybe that was good because I had to listen to myself.  It&#39;s hard to clear out those old controlling voices when new voices are constantly filling your mind.<br/>
<br/>
  All this to say that I&#39;ve been where you are and am still working on all the baggage I&#39;ve been carrying around.  You can e-mail me if you have any questions just about religion and working through it.  I don&#39;t know how much help I would be, but it is good to have someone listen to you at times.<br/>

in that belief.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-409753643">A more personal take on Hell and that, than my last post.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few things:<br/>
<br/>
1) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/theology">http://sandradodd.com/theology</a><br/>
<br/>
A large chunk of that was a smart-ass bit with Ren Allen on a list  <br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
2) Something I got in side/private e-mail this morning and I&#39;d like  <br/>
to quote it without naming the shy author.<br/>
=====================<br/>
~~My confidence is not in what I believe, but in Him~~<br/>
<br/>
But that IS a belief.<br/>
Not only that there is a God but that the God is male. That&#39;s a lot  <br/>
of belief.<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
3) When I was in my early teens I seriously planned to become a  <br/>
Baptist missionary.  I hoped fervently to save souls.<br/>
I had not ever saved a soul that I knew of, when I was on the  <br/>
*Prodigy homeschooling boards and challenged the thinking of someone  <br/>
who was heavy into a particularly controlling congregation of the  <br/>
Church of Christ.  Questions I asked her about her relationship with  <br/>
her children caused her to question her relationship with the church.<br/>
<br/>
Her asking me how I functioned without religion caused her to  <br/>
question her faith.<br/>
<br/>
I not only have never saved a soul, I had the huge feeling that I had  <br/>
lured one away from Jesus.  Not a good feeling after all those years  <br/>
of planning and praying.<br/>
<br/>
4) Ren wrote, &quot;I started reading a lot of history that didn&#39;t mesh  <br/>
with what I&#39;d been<br/>
taught all those years&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It helped me to study other denominations within Christianity and to  <br/>
try go get a neutral, historical background for the Protestant  <br/>
movement, and to sort backwards through how and why churches split up  <br/>
and out.  You can start now and move backwards (the difference  <br/>
between American and Southern Baptists;  what are &quot;Missouri Synod  <br/>
Lutherans&quot;?  What&#39;s the difference between an Episcopal church and  <br/>
Anglican?), or start during the reformation and move forward.  What&#39;s  <br/>
with Anabaptists and Lutherans and Puritans?<br/>
<br/>
And then, if you&#39;re American, realize that other English-speaking  <br/>
places didn&#39;t have this level of crap.  And if you&#39;re not American,  <br/>
you  might possibly sympathize with (or laugh at) the serious  <br/>
problems some Americans face, living in the Bible Belt or in other  <br/>
religious situations.  These people aren&#39;t messing around here.  Some  <br/>
of the churches shun bigtime if you get out of line.  Some people  <br/>
find they can&#39;t do commerce in certain communities if they&#39;re not the  <br/>
right religion.  The effect on homeschooling and unschooling is no  <br/>
joke here, either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478726793">&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all reasonable to risk a marriage. Kids need <br/>
  their parents more than they need unschooling. And honestly, there&#39;s <br/>
  the question of breach of contract, in a marriage, if at the point of <br/>
  the marriage they&#39;re both very Christian, and the marriage is based <br/>
  in that belief.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t believe in heaven OR hell, but I see the crushing effects of <br/>
  divorce in young adults all around me. That is real, no matter what <br/>
  people believe about God.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Absolutely.  I mentioned in my other e-mail that my husband isn&#39;t where I am with a belief system.  Because of voices from his childhood that he can&#39;t shake or whatever, he is still with the religion program.  He has many, many questions, but he will have to deal with those in his own way, in his own time.  Anyway, for him he still feels it&#39;s his responsibility to raise his children with a belief system.  When they&#39;re grown, if they move away from church, he sees that as their decision.  But right now he feels responsible for sharing this with them.  He knows I don&#39;t believe.  But I&#39;m not willing to split up this family over religion.  There have been too many broken families and wars over religion already.  Plus when we married, we both came into the marriage with the same beliefs.  I&#39;m the one that has changed.  But my marriage is much more important to me and my children than drawing some line in the sand over religion.  So I go to church with him and the younger girls.<br/>

I&#39;ve found lots of room for faith in this life, not so much room for church.<br/>
That was the biggie for me. God outside the box. Liberating, scary and oh,<br/>
so BIG!!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I worried that some folks might tell my kids that their father went to Hell<br/>
for his sins (even with last rites, you just never know with some people,<br/>
ime). So, I did the research. As with all things Catholic, the Pagan roots<br/>
of this term are purposely skewed with control through fear. Hel was a<br/>
perfectly nice deity, though Odin found her &quot;hard to look at&quot; with her grey<br/>
and pink slimy skin. As to not upset his good friend, Loki, he gave Hel and<br/>
important (and joyfully invisible) job of transporting souls of those who<br/>
have died after an illness. She was connected to the underworld and dealt<br/>
with souls of sick people -- pretty easy to understand why folks were scared<br/>
of Hel. To curse someone with &quot;Go to Hel(l)&quot; is truly a wish of cancer or<br/>
pox upon them; a lingering illness followed by death.<br/>
That helped put a lot of &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; rhetoric to rest. And since<br/>
Mitch died of cancer, he just may have gone to Hel; for care and transport<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Couple that with an abusive, manipulative, controlling mother and you can<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling brings the opportunity to not pass these qualities to our<br/>
children. Even better, the process of *actively* NOT being that mom is the<br/>
best healing for having *had* that mom.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a typical thing to go through as an unschooling parent? Did most of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you at some point begin questioning your belief system?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say yes. The questioning, like anything else in this human life,<br/>
cannot be limited, fenced or  hindered. The whole wide world is open to<br/>
exploration and question. If God can&#39;t handle our questioning, who can??<br/>
::bg:: I&#39;m doing a circle chat later this month on this very topic, it&#39;s<br/>
near and dear to me. I think I&#39;ve got my whole life to figure out this human<br/>
existence and anything that may be beyond this physicality. If there is a<br/>
God and indeed I am created in God&#39;s image, then this is a God Approved<br/>
Journey. I am diana, this is what God has wrought; questions, demands,<br/>
tantrums, gratitude and all :)<br/>
I&#39;ve read the most amazing books :) Foremost, the first three Conversations<br/>
with God. Wow, wow, wow. A gigantic shift in perspective for me. Lamb: The<br/>
Gospel According to Biff, Christ&#39;s Childhood Pal. The funniest Jesus you&#39;ll<br/>
ever meet. Likable and believable. I can strive to emulate this guy :) And:<br/>
The Four Agreements. The Journey Home. The Moon Under Her Feet. The Harlot<br/>
by the Side of the Road. The Red Tent. Jesus, Who Needs Him?<br/>
<br/>
How did you deal with the guilt (I have such a tremendous amount right now)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and the fear of doing the wrong thing and landing yourself in Hell?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would God really be so scared of your exploration that  you would be<br/>
condemned to hell? Really? I&#39;d recommend you try on the idea that mayhap you<br/>
were created to explore what it means to be human and have a relationship<br/>
with God that is uniquely your own. You have free will. You know the<br/>
principles by which to lead a good life. Is there room in your heart for<br/>
Fear? Were you created to be filled with Fear or Love? You can&#39;t have one<br/>
where the other exists. If God is Love, Fear is not God. Free yourself from<br/>
fear, it&#39;s glorious!<br/>
<br/>
I tried talking to my husband, but it frankly scares him to hear me talk in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; such a way. He thinks I should just quit thinking about it and go on to<br/>
&gt; church and leave things alone. I wouldn&#39;t dare talk to my mother-in-law. Not<br/>
&gt; only would she have a major cow, she would worry herself sick that I was<br/>
&gt; leading her son and her grandchildren astray. My mother is out of the<br/>
&gt; question as is anyone in our congregation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your relationship with God is your own; you answer only for yourself. You<br/>
can question your path and still have faith. You can question the rules and<br/>
still uphold the principles.<br/>
I found ways to be Catholic and truly *love* being Catholic; I questioned<br/>
everything & I knew the story behind the stories told, the original purpose<br/>
to rites and rituals, the principles behind the dogma. I still do love the<br/>
Catholic Faith *and* I will not support the actions and politics of the<br/>
Catholic Church - so I&#39;m not Catholic anymore.  I know my relationship with<br/>
my version of God is a good one. Come that day, that&#39;s all I&#39;ll have to<br/>
answer for.<br/>
<br/>
I still know in my heart that I am a Christian, but things just don&#39;t seem<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; right anymore. Somehow, I don&#39;t think that Jesus would approve of what<br/>
&gt; churches have become and how manipulative and conrolling they are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What would Jesus do?<br/>
I think he questioned it ALL :)<br/>
<br/>
Whew! I kinda went nuts there, I hope some of it is helpful to someone else,<br/>
it was incredibly cathartic to write it down :)<br/>

I think people should question everything and anything, including the<br/>
existence of a God that has been handed down as a &quot;truth&quot;. Think<br/>
dangerous thoughts, go outside every box you&#39;ve ever known.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;God&quot; is a concept or idea that came from other humans. What I&#39;m<br/>
really tired of, is &quot;God&quot; as a male figure. How does that affect women?<br/>

<br/>
a comment was made earlier to to the same point and i wanted to chime in to say that in the hebrew language grammatical gender doesn&#39;t indicate actual gender of an object.  God is a &quot;hebrew God&quot; so to speak, then understanding the original language is crucial! an object is either masculine or feminine.  in the hebrew translation of the bible God is described with both. those who aren&#39;t familiar with the language don&#39;t often realize this and refer to God in gender alone and not in grammatical sense! <br/>
<br/>
its interesting to study as once you become aware of it, you will notice more of the feminine use in the bible! also note they don&#39;t have an equivant to &quot;it&quot;, so even animals are refered to as she/he without acutally meaning gender.<br/>
<br/>
in the honor of questioning-----SO if one were to believe God is spirit and we are created in <br/>
likeness to the Creator, wouldn&#39;t that include that the divine is indeed BOTH?<br/>
<br/>
imagine a world without questions!! <br/>
without questions how would we find an answer?<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this thread with interest and decided to pipe up here just<br/>
to share a big thing that happened in my marriage of 16 years in case it is<br/>
helpful to someone.  We married young (21 and 22) and were both committed<br/>
converts to Christianity at the time we married.  We both went to church and<br/>
had deep faith experiences over the years.  One day (this year) my dh came<br/>
to me and sheepishly told me that he had been reading and thinking a lot<br/>
about God and the universe and everything and had come to the conclusion<br/>
that he considers himself to be an atheist.  After the shock and some<br/>
tearful, worried conversations (worried about our marriage and the kids and<br/>
the future mostly) I was convinced that his new point of view did not change<br/>
our commitment to one another or to our marriage and that the fact that he<br/>
hadn&#39;t wanted to hide this big change in his life from me was a good thing.<br/>
The respect that bathed all of the talks we had about how this might change<br/>
our lives together as a family was very sweet and heartening.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The fact that he had the courage to face this honestly and with respect for<br/>
my feelings gave me the push I needed to really give the possibility of no<br/>
God an honest hearing - something I hadn&#39;t done as an adult.  The short<br/>
version is that I too consider myself an atheist now and am wonderfully<br/>
surprised by the freedom of thought and fresh point of view this has given<br/>
me.  This isn&#39;t the right list for the details but I think honesty and<br/>
integrity has helped and so has a healthy respect for each other and an<br/>
agreement that living joyfully together was really really important.<br/>
Neither one of us would want to split even if we didn&#39;t agree on matters of<br/>
faith because of the very real pain and suffering that divorce causes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Hope I haven&#39;t veered too far afield.  Our unschooling life is incidentally<br/>
greatly enhanced by these developments.<br/>
