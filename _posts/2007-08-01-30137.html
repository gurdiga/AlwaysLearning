<br/>
Harmony, I don&#39;t see how you can unschool 15 kids by yourself. If you are<br/>
really wanting to give your own children a rich unschooling life, is there a<br/>
way you can reduce the kids in your home? Or the time you have them (18<br/>
hours a day 7 days a week? Jiminy Cricket!). I have four kids who are all<br/>
teenagers now and I don&#39;t feel like I gave them all that was best for them<br/>
when they were little simply because I was trying to do it by myself, and<br/>
there were only four. I can&#39;t even fathom 15!<br/>
<br/>
It is probably a matter of income, and it is understandable that some<br/>
compromises may need to be made in little bits because of that, but this is<br/>
where I would advise change. If you were to think of just your family first,<br/>
and what they want and need (time, individual attention, support, a parent<br/>
who thinks of extra things for them when they don&#39;t even ask, a rested<br/>
parent without stress), and then try to build an income around that, I think<br/>
you could make a great unschooling environment. Maybe it means giving up<br/>
luxuries, or downsizing the house, or buying store-brand food, but so what.<br/>
We&#39;ve downsized big-time in the past to accommodate our lifestyle. The<br/>
reduced stress and reduced need to make money was such a gift for them. They<br/>
never missed the space.<br/>

The statement &quot;I want to teach the kids...&quot; shows me you&#39;re still  <br/>

that&#39;s a reasonable thought.  But you don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; independence, you  <br/>
nurture it.<br/>
<br/>
I really, really do not like your example.<br/>
A child was thirsty and went to an adult.<br/>
A child was thirsty and went to the woman who was to take care of her.<br/>
The adult said &quot;So what are you going to do about it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s harsh and cruel.<br/>
The child already did something about it, something reasonable and good.<br/>

Maybe if you had already had some easily accessible drinks down low,  <br/>

water, or do you want juice?&quot;<br/>

One good way to help figure out how to deal respectfully with a child  <br/>

you had a guest, would he even get thirsty?  Most people offer guests  <br/>
a drink right away, and renew the offer every hour or two.   But if  <br/>
you had a guest who said &quot;I&#39;m thirsty,&quot; I&#39;m guessing you would not in  <br/>

Your house is a daycare.  You DO need to keep things running smoothly.<br/>
What kids do during six or ten hours away from home isn&#39;t in the same  <br/>
category as the kinds of choices kids make when they&#39;re living in  <br/>
their own homes 24/7/365/life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of &quot;under control,&quot; maybe think of &quot;busy and interested.&quot;<br/>

Maybe you could look online for discussion and description of free  <br/>
school or open classroom, and see what kinds of interest stations  <br/>
they&#39;ve set up.<br/>

------all the kids have cups in the house in a low drawer and outside on the table with their names on them and we have faucets that they can reach and jugs of water outside that they can get by themselves.  They all know that and as soon as I ask them &quot;what are you going to do?&quot; they walk over and get themselves water.  I don&#39;t say it in a rude way by any means.  The other option would be for them to ask me for a drink and I would get it.  If they tell me they are thirst, they are just stating a fact, not asking me to do something about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as teaching the kids independence, I guess I could clarify with teach them the skills they need to have independence over their daily needs.  Such as getting their own water, not asking to go to the bathroom, etc.<br/>

<br/>
 From an unschooling point of view, that looks very, very much like  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important in a school context for children to &quot;be independent.&quot;   <br/>
They use that term, but it&#39;s a cruel shadow of real &quot;independence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still, teachers aren&#39;t paid to tie shoes or wipe butts or spoon feed  <br/>
kids.  (Except teachers of disabled kids, who ARE paid to do those  <br/>
things, or have paid aids to do it.)<br/>
<br/>
Children want to learn to do what adults do.  It&#39;s what they do.   <br/>
They learn.  They don&#39;t need to be &quot;taught the skills.&quot;  They need to  <br/>
have opportunities to see what adults do, and kindly assistance to  <br/>
try it out themselves when they&#39;re ready and interested.  If it takes  <br/>
one kid two  minutes and another two years to learn some everyday  <br/>
skill, that&#39;s how it goes.  They&#39;re learning.<br/>
<br/>
To see learning and call it learning instead of seeing end results  <br/>
and using the term &quot;teaching&quot; is crucial to an understanding of  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
There are some examples of teaching vs. learning, in language and  <br/>
thought.<br/>

So if a kid cannot tie his shoes and he wants them tied,  I tell him that I can show him how.  He is excited to conquer this new skill.  I show and tell him how to do it, he works right alongs side me with the other shoe.  He does it and is excited.  I have just taught him how.  Yes, I taught him.  What other way would he learn.  Perhaps I&#39;m not really an unschooler at all because when my kids ask me to teach them how to do something, I teach them.<br/>

the  mainstream ideas yet be more unschooly. Won&#39;t work. When you<br/>

My own kids are unschooled.  They make their own choices and learn what they want to learn.  They are 8 and 10 years old.  Maybe I have just misunderstood the suggestions.  The only &quot;suggestions&quot; I have heard are that I either can&#39;t &quot;unschool&quot; daycare kids because they aren&#39;t my kids and that I don&#39;t understand unschooling.  What I am looking for may not be unschooling by your definition, I want a relaxed fun atmosphere where children are treated as individuals and have choices in what they do and how they do it.  Has anyone ever done that with a large group of kids?  If not, I will just keep doing what I am doing and trying different suggestions that I get.<br/>

individuals and have choices in what they do and how they do it.~~<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps not.<br/>
One of the first suggestions was about your answer to the child that<br/>
says &quot;I&#39;m thirsty&quot;. If it&#39;s going to be a relaxed, fun atmosphere, you<br/>
need to be someone they can trust. I don&#39;t care how sweetly you say<br/>
&quot;so what are you going to do?&quot; it&#39;s not nice.<br/>
<br/>
A child that is thirsty might be coming to you because they want help.<br/>
They might want an adult to spend some time with them or they might<br/>
have forgotten where the cups are momentarily. Either way, a &quot;relaxed,<br/>
fun&quot; atmosphere would include a more responsive adult when someone<br/>
wants a drink.<br/>
<br/>
A relaxed, fun atmosphere isn&#39;t about this:<br/>
~~Yes, I -taught him. What other way would he learn~~<br/>
<br/>
Especially if you claim to be trying to incorporate unschooly ideas<br/>
with children that are not your own. Children learn. They&#39;ll learn<br/>
whether you teach or not. They&#39;ll learn better if you think of them as<br/>
your partners in a journey (even those that are in your care for only<br/>
part of their lives) and assist them in whatever way they need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other suggestion was about the shoe.....I would tie the shoe. If<br/>
the child wanted to be shown how to do it, that doesn&#39;t necessarily<br/>
mean they are ready. If they learn at 5 or 8 or 5, what does it<br/>
matter? If they learn without being taught, then they&#39;ve proved your<br/>
theory incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Daycare is not an ideal situation of course. But if you truly<br/>
understand unschooling then you might want to simply be responsive,<br/>
have fun with them with as little agenda as possible, and try to let<br/>
go of the idea that they MUST have you in order to learn things<br/>
they&#39;re interested in.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do your kids feel about the daycare?  That would be the paramount <br/>
question really.<br/>
<br/>
I have on occasion watched other people&#39;s children, either for money <br/>
or just because I&#39;m nice and I like the kids and the parents of the <br/>
kids.  I&#39;ve done it on a regular basis before, and even under the <br/>
best circumstances, dealing with another person&#39;s child isn&#39;t the <br/>
same as just interacting with your own children.  There were days <br/>
when my kids didn&#39;t want other kids around, they wanted their space <br/>
to be theirs.  They didn&#39;t want to share their toys and get along, <br/>
and if someone is counting on me for child care, I couldn&#39;t give that <br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that it would be a big deal to have a lot of kids over all <br/>
the time, it interferes with family life and family dynamics.  <br/>
Perhaps your family doesn&#39;t have these issues, but I don&#39;t see how <br/>
that&#39;s possible if you have kids over 7 days a week.  I can&#39;t tell <br/>
you how to run your business, but why not make it 5 days a week <br/>
during regular business hours, or make yourself an off hour daycare <br/>
and don&#39;t accept kids during regular business hours and only off <br/>
hours for those that need it.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the draw of running a daycare for income, as you can do <br/>
it at home along side your kids and have playmates for them.  I just <br/>
really don&#39;t see how you can give your own kids the time they need to <br/>
unschool and take care of so many kids.  Much of dealing with large <br/>
amounts of kids has to do with order and control.  Even in a free <br/>
school environment there is some amount of order and control, and the <br/>
kids are mostly older than what you are dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
For a while I tried starting a school that was intended for <br/>
homeschoolers, to offer some cool classes and whatnot.  Ultimately <br/>
what it came down to, was that it wasn&#39;t conducive to unschooling for <br/>
my own child. (My youngest was a baby)  It was fun, yet, when my <br/>
daughter didn&#39;t want to go, she still had to since I had to.  It <br/>
lasted about 9 mos.  It was an interesting experiment and we got a <br/>
lot out of it, but in the end, it was difficult to do that part time <br/>
and unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately it comes down to how dedicated you are to unschooling your <br/>
own kids.  If that is what you truly want, taking a look at the whole <br/>
daycare stuff is warranted.  You can make your daycare as unschooly <br/>
as possible, but it still may not work along side unschooling your <br/>
own kids.<br/>
<br/>
So when you ask if there have been others doing what you are doing, I <br/>
would say that I&#39;ve tried to do similar things, but ended up stopping <br/>
because it truly wasn&#39;t condusive to unschooling my own kids and that <br/>
was far more important than the little bit of extra money I got.  If <br/>
there are others more successful than I was, I don&#39;t know.  My <br/>
experience says it can&#39;t be done, and I&#39;m a pretty &quot;can do&quot; sort of <br/>
person.  I say this because I&#39;ve found that to truly unschool your <br/>
kids, you have to give them &quot;you&quot;.  It is a very important part of <br/>
unschooling, to be present and there for your kids when they need <br/>
you.  I just don&#39;t see how one can do that and be a caregiver to 15 <br/>
other children, without your own kids getting the short end of the <br/>
stick so to speak.</div>

 <br/>
I guess I don&#39;t see it as not nice and I don&#39;t feel that the kids take it in a mean way, or naturally, I would do it.  Lots of times kids don&#39;t stop and think things through.  If I ask them and they say they don&#39;t know then we talk about what options they have such as asking me or someone else to get them something or getting it themselves, or waiting until lunch or snack time.  If if was a new kid that was not used to doing things for themselves then of course I would tell them that it is okay for them to just get a drink and they don&#39;t have to ask permission and if they want me to do it for them, I would.And I would make sure they knew how to do it.  Once the kids are comfortable here, they have no problem helping themselves.  Once they know that they don&#39;t need permission to get a drink or go to the bathroom they do fine doing in on their own.  Sometimes they just say it out of habbit, but once I ask &quot;what are you going to do if your thirsty&quot; they know what to do and they are learing independence.  <br/>
<br/>
I also agree that kids don&#39;t need to be taught independence, (I said that not knowing how carefully I had to word things on this list) but they need to know that they can be independent at my house and they learn the skills to do that.  Most of my kids come from very low income single parent families, not all of them have a house or a car and they don&#39;t have very nurturing parents, I want them to learn that they do matter as people and they can think for themselves without being yelled at or spanked.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids at my house get along really well, they help each other all the time and they love being here, I just feel like there is more that I can offer them, but I&#39;m not sure how.  SO I&#39;m sorry if I sound like I&#39;m not listening to you philosopy on unschooling,or wording thing correctly,  but I feel like your not trying to give me any helpful advice, your just trying to convince me that I&#39;m not truley unschooling.</div>

To suggest that you this lists requires you to be more careful with  <br/>
words and thoughts than other places in your world says something.   <br/>
It doesn&#39;t say anything about this list, though.<br/>
<br/>
Careful thought should be for all occasions.<br/>

<br/>
The way to do things in an unschooling way is to become an unschooler  <br/>
to the point that you don&#39;t think any other way.   We&#39;re trying to  <br/>
help you change the way you see, while you&#39;re saying &quot;Tell me what to  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>individuals and have choices in what they do and how they do it. Has anyone<br/>

<br/>
Years ago, before hearing the word &quot;unschool&quot;, I ran a preschool. It was<br/>
based on Sudbury Valley School, which I highly recommend you look into for<br/>
your situation (not that I think it is an ideal situation, but appears to be<br/>
the kind of thing you are looking for). Free, open concept, kids making<br/>
their own decisions while living within rules created by them and the<br/>
teachers.<br/>
<br/>
It was messy, fun, engaging, stimulating, and probably the best child care<br/>
type of situation anywhere around there at the time.<br/>
<br/>
It was exhausting for me. Allowing children to be free, and being their<br/>
partner in their individual journeys, was just downright exhausting. I had<br/>
21 children and one other adult with me.<br/>
<br/>
Now let&#39;s talk about my kids. They were, for much of the time, ignored by<br/>
me. I didn&#39;t mean to ignore them, but they could see how busy I was, and how<br/>
tired this job made me. They usually did not come to me for extra attention<br/>
or to seek things. At the time in my fogged understanding (which felt quite<br/>
clear at the time) I believed that they were simply really content. I really<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have known for sure though, because I was so busy and engaged with<br/>
so many kids.<br/>
<br/>
And I had principled ethics about the situation...these parents were paying<br/>
money and I owed it to them and their children to make sure the kids&#39; needs<br/>
and wants were met. So I often chose to fulfill those needs over checking in<br/>
with my kids, at least during &quot;school hours&quot;. I would be the best mom in the<br/>
world after that, and I do believe that was somewhat helpful. But while<br/>
other kids were with us, which was for about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, I<br/>
did not give them as much attention as they needed. They really did need me<br/>
to check in with them, as they were not going to add to what they could see<br/>
I was already so involved in. Squeeze their unbelievable empathic hearts.<br/>
<br/>
And I STILL feel guilty about that.<br/>
<br/>
So that is my experience. I got out of it pretty quickly, thankfully, and<br/>
began to really know my children again. That was about 10 years ago. Today<br/>
they are 13, 15, 17 and 18 and boy are we in a different place today than we<br/>
would have been if I continued on that course.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so you&#39;re probably feeling picked on by now, but what is really<br/>
happening here is that a bunch of people who have been where you are trying<br/>
to give you some little light bulbs to help you get to a better place with<br/>
your children that you may not even know is possible. So here&#39;s another<br/>
thought...<br/>
<br/>
If you were at a friend&#39;s house and said, &quot;I&#39;m thirsty.&quot;, and your friend<br/>
said, &quot;So what do you think you should do?&quot;, that would be a whole different<br/>
experience than if she responded, &quot;Oh, please help yourself to whatever<br/>
you&#39;d like in the fridge.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even if she had welcomed you to help yourself twelve times before and<br/>
therefore you should know you could help yourself, in the moment that you<br/>
asked, that wasn&#39;t on your radar, and you would most likely appreciate the<br/>
second response a whole lot more than the first.<br/>
<br/>
This is a little, subtle change in thinking regarding how we talk to young<br/>
ones. It feels very different to them to be given a statement that is<br/>
intended to make them think more, which is manipulative, than to be given<br/>
help and support without the test. And that kind of supportive response and<br/>
behavior consistently builds a very strong and connected relationship that<br/>
lasts.<br/>
<br/>
My teenagers and I are very close. I have really different relationships<br/>
with each of them because each of them is very different from the others.<br/>
Each one invites me to things with them...movies, concerts, shopping. They<br/>
have their friends over who all chat with me openly (as in about sex, drugs,<br/>
relationships, their interests, their experiences, etc), many of their<br/>
friends hug me spontaneously...I do NOT see this in most of the families I<br/>
see around us. I see lots of &quot;rebellious&quot; behavior, a disconnect between<br/>
parents and kids, and disrespectful parenting that is touted as &quot;the right<br/>
way&quot;, which has only further distanced them from their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Choice of words may seem like a minor thing, especially when we are<br/>
well-intended, but if we are really serious about unschooling and making our<br/>
relationships the best they can be with our kids, then it is pretty darn<br/>
important.<br/>

I am an Early Childhood Educator (ECE) and &quot;taught&quot; preschool for  <br/>
years - it was very hard work because the lovely place I interned at  <br/>
(Play Mountain Place, in L.A.) was a very respectful freeschool and  <br/>
it &quot;ruined&quot; me to work anywhere else :), and at some point, after  <br/>
&quot;making a living&quot; as a teacher for 7 years, I quit forever - I just  <br/>
wasn&#39;t willing to hurt kids emotionally any more in the name of  <br/>
convenience and control - I didn&#39;t feel right about the number of  <br/>
hours the children were away from their parents and I didn&#39;t feel  <br/>
right about the limits that were there, sometimes because of the  <br/>
center or school, but often simply because there were so many of them  <br/>
and I had them for such long hours.  I attempted to start my own  <br/>
&quot;free-preschool&quot; in 2003, and this is what it looked like http:// <br/>
familyfreeschool.com/ but it wasn&#39;t radical unschooling by any  <br/>
means.  I was also influenced by a woman named Bev Bos - she has an  <br/>
amazing co-op preschool (just a few hours a day) that is totally non- <br/>
academic and free and fun and the kids all do whatever they want -   <br/>
she was on ABC&#39;s 20/20 a few years back - there are tons of materials  <br/>
available, and they are into respectful communication and are not  <br/>
concerned about messes or &quot;control&quot;.  You might want to check out her  <br/>
website and read some of her articles for some inspiration. http:// <br/>

 their own decisions while living within rules created by them and the<br/>
 teachers.<br/>
 <br/>
 It was messy, fun, engaging, stimulating, and probably the best child<br/>
 care<br/>
 type of situation anywhere around there at the time.<br/>
 <br/>
 It was exhausting for me. Allowing children to be free, and being their<br/>
 partner in their individual journeys, was just downright exhausting. I<br/>
 had<br/>
 21 children and one other adult with me.<br/>
 <br/>
 Now let&#39;s talk about my kids. They were, for much of the time, ignored by<br/>
 me. I didn&#39;t mean to ignore them, but they could see how busy I was, and<br/>
 how<br/>
 tired this job made me. They usually did not come to me for extra<br/>
 attention<br/>
 or to seek things. At the time in my fogged understanding (which felt<br/>
 quite<br/>
 clear at the time) I believed that they were simply really content. I<br/>
 really<br/>
 wouldn&#39;t have known for sure though, because I was so busy and engaged<br/>
 with<br/>
 so many kids.<br/>
 <br/>
 And I had principled ethics about the situation...these parents were<br/>
 paying<br/>
 money and I owed it to them and their children to make sure the kids&#39;<br/>
 needs<br/>
 and wants were met. So I often chose to fulfill those needs over checking<br/>
 in<br/>
 with my kids, at least during &quot;school hours&quot;. I would be the best mom in<br/>
 the<br/>
 world after that, and I do believe that was somewhat helpful. But while<br/>
 other kids were with us, which was for about 8 hours a day, 5 days a<br/>
 week, I<br/>
 did not give them as much attention as they needed. They really did need<br/>
 me<br/>
 to check in with them, as they were not going to add to what they could<br/>
 see<br/>
 I was already so involved in. Squeeze their unbelievable empathic hearts.<br/>
 <br/>
 And I STILL feel guilty about that.<br/>
 <br/>
 So that is my experience. I got out of it pretty quickly, thankfully, and<br/>
 began to really know my children again. That was about 10 years ago.<br/>
 Today<br/>
 they are 13, 15, 17 and 18 and boy are we in a different place today than<br/>
 we<br/>
 would have been if I continued on that course.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038924360">-=-Choice of words may seem like a minor thing, especially when we are<br/>
well-intended, but if we are really serious about unschooling and  <br/>
making our<br/>
relationships the best they can be with our kids, then it is pretty darn<br/>
important.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And in the case where someone has just explained to us that it  <br/>
would&#39;ve been different if the child had said &quot;Please help me get a  <br/>
drink&quot; instead of &quot;I&#39;m thirsty,&quot; it seems even MORE important that  <br/>
the person be willing to accept that her own word choices are important.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104723948"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was also influenced by a woman named Bev Bos - she has an<br/>
&gt;amazing co-op preschool (just a few hours a day) that is totally non-<br/>
&gt;academic and free and fun and the kids all do whatever they want -<br/>
&gt;she was on ABC&#39;s 20/20 a few years back - there are tons of materials<br/>
&gt;available, and they are into respectful communication and are not<br/>
&gt;concerned about messes or &quot;control&quot;. You might want to check out her<br/>
&gt;website and read some of her articles for some inspiration. http://<br/>
&gt;www.turnthepage.com/ &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I second the idea of looking at Bev Bos&#39; ideas.  I&#39;ve got her books <br/>
and have heard her speak many times.  She&#39;s very inspiring but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t take it all the way to unschooling by any means.  But I <br/>
especially like her ideas for fun group things to do to allow young <br/>
children to explore and be creative.  If I had to send my kids to an <br/>
institution (or be in one myself), I&#39;d want something like what she has.<br/>
<br/>
She says things like (paraphrasing), &quot;It is not my job to get kids <br/>
ready for kindergarden.  It is my job to meet them where they are and <br/>
do with them what&#39;s developmentally appropriate for them now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My favorite story I ever heard her tell is this (again paraphrasing):<br/>
A boy came to school one day and said, &quot;Teacher Bev, I need some <br/>
lettuce.&quot;  I didn&#39;t ask why or what for; I said, &quot;What kind of <br/>
lettuce?&quot;  The boy said, &quot;One of those big round ones.&quot;  I grabbed a <br/>
dad who was leaving after dropping off his child and asked him to go <br/>
to the store and get me a head of iceberg lettuce.  When he came back <br/>
with the lettuce, the boy said, &quot;Now I need some milk and a big <br/>
bowl,&quot; so I got him those.  Then he said, &quot;Now we need to put it in <br/>
the microwave.&quot;  I said, &quot;How long?&quot;  He told me three minutes.  When <br/>
it came out of the microwave, he stirred it a little then said it was done.&quot;<br/>
Some things that really strike me about that story:<br/>
<br/>
    * It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d usually do with your own unschooled <br/>
child.  Although, depending on the circumstances, you might converse more.<br/>
    * I love that she grabbed the dad, whom I picture as being a <br/>
hurried businessman in a suit and tie and just assumed that this <br/>
boy&#39;s requests were as important as anything the dad may have to do.<br/>
    * I can&#39;t believe this happens very often in a group setting or <br/>
if it does, she must have TONS of help.  I know a homeschooling <br/>
family whose kid went there and the mom told me that volunteering <br/>
there was hard work with lots of cleanup!<br/>
Another thing I remember her telling about was buying a 50 pound sack <br/>
of flour and letting the kids do what they wanted.  We did that for <br/>
Nicky&#39;s 3rd birthday party.  He was getting over chickenpox and I <br/>
have a picture of him naked with all his little pox marks covered <br/>
with flour.  It was outside, of course, very fun for the kids and <br/>
really didn&#39;t take any clean up at all (since it was in a bare dirt <br/>
area of the yard).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985479940">~~UNSCHOOLING AND DAYCARE (and yes I&#39;m shouting) TOGETHER ARE AN <br/>
OXYMORON... Simple as that....~~<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
A daycare could be run pretty much like any freeschool. The principles<br/>
of trust and respect can (and should)exist within a daycare situation.<br/>
<br/>
I think its a bit simplistic to assume that unschooling can always be<br/>
an ideal situation. I think each of us makes our real life challenges<br/>
as ideal as possible. I work full-time outside the home, so does dh.<br/>
Many people would say unschooling can&#39;t possibly unfold in such a<br/>
situation. Yet it does here....and quite well.<br/>
<br/>
I hear people talking about how mother&#39;s are selfish/horrible<br/>
etc...for working full-time rather than being home with their kids.<br/>
That is overgeneralizing just as the above statement is. Sure, it&#39;s<br/>
ideal to have a parent home full-time...definitely. But people without<br/>
ideal situations CAN make unschooling work beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
I know some single Moms that ran from bad home situations. They really<br/>
needed to work in order to survive and get away from the abusive<br/>
situations they left. Two of them I know personally, really WANTED an<br/>
unschooling situation but needed daycare in order to EAT and have<br/>
housing!  They would have been thrilled to find someone who understood<br/>
the principles of unschooling to care for their children.<br/>
<br/>
I think the unschooling philosophy can be expanded to include those in<br/>
less-than-ideal situations. I think the world in general, needs to get<br/>
to a place of more respect to children. Why can&#39;t unschooling<br/>
philosophy be compatible with daycare? I&#39;m really curious why you<br/>
think that.<br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t go out and advocate both parents working full-time, or<br/>
putting your child in daycare, there ARE situations where unschooling<br/>
families might need to do those things. Better to have respectful,<br/>
mindful people with our children in those scenarios, than maintream,<br/>
punishment oriented adults.<br/>
