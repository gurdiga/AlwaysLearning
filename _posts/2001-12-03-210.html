<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; .... There are lots of pre-planned or hoped-for or unexpected<br/>
&gt; real-world applications of things thought up by people who really were just<br/>
&gt; &quot;playing around&quot; with ideas in a purely abstract realm.  Does that help at<br/>
&gt; all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sort of. My immediate reaction upon reading it was &quot;Oh yes, it does&quot;.<br/>
To be honest, I only understand the words.<br/>
Are you able  to give an example of this?<br/>
