<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718428748">In Virgnina, someone on our statewide support group list <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:VAEclectichomeschool@yahoogroups.com">VAEclectichomeschool@yahoogroups.com</a>) created a membership card that <br/>
was uploaded as a file.  People can print and laminate this card --  and <br/>
it&#39;s usually accepted by merchants as qualification for teacher <br/>
discount.  I usually carry around my &quot;approval&quot; letter from the school <br/>
district, but no one has ever asked to see it.  In the past, people have <br/>
asked why  my children aren&#39;t in school on weekdays when we&#39;re out.  My <br/>
eldest son has a ready response, &quot;We homeschool and we learn everywhere <br/>
all the time.&quot;    ~ Alicia <br/>

&gt; &gt;educator appreciation days nationwide.  Any educator, including a home<br/>
&gt; &gt;schooler, will save 25% on everything they buy, except for magazines and <br/>
&gt; gift<br/>
&gt; &gt;certificates!  Unlike our regular teacher discount, this is not just for<br/>
&gt; &gt;items purchased for teaching purposes, but anything the teacher wants for<br/>
&gt; &gt;him/herself as well!<br/>
