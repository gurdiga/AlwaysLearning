&gt;concerns or issues, although now I see that is how it came out.<br/>
&gt; Far from intending that, I was trying to offer some praise and <br/>
&gt;encourage to you to appreciate yourself for all the good things you <br/>
&gt;are clearly already doing. Thanks for the gentle redirection of <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s ok Robyn.  I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t meant that way.  No one likes to <br/>
feel dismissed.  I did want to say thanks for the note at the end of <br/>
your post about trusting myself.  I could probably stand to do that a <br/>
bit more, and it&#39;s always nice to hear that someone thinks I am doing <br/>
a pretty good job overall, although I don&#39;t live for the approval of <br/>
others.  I am hoping that the new unschooling group at least produces <br/>
a couple new friends, ideally for all of us.<br/>
