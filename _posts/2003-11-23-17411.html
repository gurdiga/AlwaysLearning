<div id="ygrps-yiv-50675477">We were taking the kids to the movies last night and dh chose the new Looney<br/>
Tunes movie over Cat in the Hat based on reviews. We all give it a thumbs<br/>
up! It reminded me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit; that kind of in-humor, so<br/>
many visual jokes spinning by that I&#39;ll have to get the DVD to find them<br/>
all. It was funny that just before the movie I was telling ds about this<br/>
thread and all the product placement in Cat in the Hat. At one point in the<br/>
Looney Tunes movie (which was otherwise fairly free of product placement if<br/>
you don&#39;t count Acme) they find a WalMart in the desert. As they leave, they<br/>
say &quot;It&#39;s sure nice of WALMART to give us these WALMART beverages in<br/>
exchange for saying WALMART so many times!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, skip the Cat and go see Bugs. It&#39;s mindless fun, although<br/>
school-at-homers might want to review pointillism and Salvador Dali. :) I<br/>
think toddlers through adults would enjoy this one!<br/>
