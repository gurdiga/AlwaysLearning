<div id="ygrps-yiv-70445752">Thanks for mentioning this movie Sandra, we rented it last night and<br/>
I have been pondering it ever since!  It left me with so many <br/>
QUESTIONS!!  What did the potion do when it spilled on the boys<br/>
hand?  Was he already on the road to recovery prior to the discovery<br/>
of the potion and his positive attitude helped him heal himself?  Do school <br/>
kids<br/>
in nice small towns really beat up on terminally ill children?  Would<br/>
a parent with a child who was terminally ill really be so harsh and<br/>
punitive?  We were shocked at the parents behavior, including the<br/>
no funeral thing and spanking? He was a teen for goodness sake! And <br/>
what WAS Mr. Rice&#39;s story????  My goodness I sure hope that this movie<br/>
was adapted from a book because I need to KNOW these things &lt;G&gt;!<br/>
When the movie first started we were all kinda like not wanting to<br/>
see the movie as the boy had a terminal illness, and that was scary<br/>
depressing but once we got into it we got over it. Dd was convinced <br/>
the boy would live as movies have happy endings (her words).<br/>
Ds said I&#39;m not going to get sick and die am I?  Poor thing.<br/>
I think it was a bit mature for them in that instance but it was things<br/>
we were able to talk about.... and the whole decoder ring, well you<br/>
won&#39;t find that baby in a box of cereal. Geez every kid (and mom!)<br/>
should have one of those!  Ok so if anyone has seen this movie<br/>
and has some ideas or more things for me to ponder, please do!<br/>
(or answers I need answers!!!LOL)<br/>

Marty said he had a scratch, and it healed it.<br/>

<br/>
Hey, there are families with terminally ill children who make them go to <br/>
school to the end.  WHY!?? (Why!?? said the mom who doesn&#39;t make her kids go <br/>
to school at all....)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And <br/>
what WAS Mr. Rice&#39;s story????&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I think it was shown from the kids&#39; point of view, and the kid only knew <br/>
about working in the garden, and the birdhouse, etc.  He didn&#39;t KNOW other <br/>
stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a 14 year old boy (not one of my kids) watching with us.  He said &quot;Oh! <br/>
a treasure-hunt story!&quot; and he was in it for that--<br/>

Oh yeah that was the other thing!  Probably so that the child can still lead <br/>
a <br/>
&quot;normal&quot; life. <br/>
