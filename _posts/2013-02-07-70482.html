<div id="ygrps-yiv-34600037">My son is 9. He will be 10 in April of this year. He has never attended school and has 3 younger sisters that have also never attended school. When he was 4 a counselor told us that he had Asperger&#39;s. My concern lies with his reading. He can read some words and says that he wants to read, but gets upset and frustrated when trying and just says&quot; I can&#39;t read, the words are too long&quot;  Then he shuts down.  <br/>
I realized early on that typical &quot;teaching methods&quot; were not for him and that is what brought me to seek out unschooling. I read stories to him and assist with reading things when he is playing video games or any other time he asks. My main question is...is there time when I should worry that he hasn&#39;t cracked the code yet. I am at a loss of what to do to help him further. His 7 yr old sister started reading at 4 and is an avid reader, and he doesn&#39;t understand why he is not.  I try to explain to him that everyone does things in their own time but that has not helped him. <br/>
How can I help him? <br/>

<br/>
Certainly not at nine.  <br/>
It might take longer than it would have if he hadn&#39;t been told there was something wrong with him, and if he hadn&#39;t already had reading lessons to make him confused and afraid.<br/>
<br/>
There are accounts here, though, that might help you relax:<br/>

This is the account of the latest reader documented on the site.  I&#39;ve known this family since my oldest child was four months old.  Carol was one of my first La Leche League leaders.  Her son, Liam, was a marine in Afghanistan and is home safely (in case as you read you wonder what became of him; we still don&#39;t know the longterm, but at nearly 30, he seems good).<br/>
