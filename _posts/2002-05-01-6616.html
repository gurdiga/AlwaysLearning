<div id="ygrps-yiv-877865642">&lt;&lt;&lt;This is great! And as part of beiing supportive and participatory, you can join the kids in their activities and invite them to join in yours. Fill your lives with lots of interesting opportunities. Things to look at, stuff to touch and play with, books to read, games to play, places to go, people to experience. You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not about being &quot;academic&quot;, it&#39;s about experiencing our world and ALL it has to offer.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone with older kids tell me how the flow of daily unschooling life might change as kids get older?  I can of course visualize it to an extent.  I imagine it would be the same as described above, but the depth and attention to interests might change.  What I&#39;m asking is if life can still be carefree with a 14 + year old, as long as I am helping her to follow her passions?<br/>

<br/>
You can leave her home and go away!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the kids got old enough to stay home alone, I could go somewhere with <br/>
just one or two of them, and that&#39;s freeing too.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is fifteen, and has anime club and friends from there, the gaming shop <br/>
and those friends, karate...  <br/>
<br/>
Marty is home more than Kirby is, and his friends come over and stay with him <br/>
a lot.  But they can take care of their own basic needs and bedding and even <br/>
food, if I&#39;m busy or gone.<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of driving, in a busy week.  Some weeks are lax, some are crammed. <br/>
