<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136129421">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a new member of this group and I hope that this question is<br/>
appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Our son, Xander, is 15-months-old and we have only recently come into the<br/>
knowledge offered by radical unschooling and peaceful parenting. Xander has<br/>
always been on a strict sleeping/mealtime schedule, even though the rest of<br/>
our day is quite relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my mind has been opened to the logic behind radical<br/>
unschooling/peaceful parenting I am struggling with what to do in some<br/>
areas. We have mealtimes pretty much sorted out (we still have our regular<br/>
mealtimes, but we also have all of Xander&#39;s &quot;dry-food&quot; [crackers, dried<br/>
fruit, etc] available for him to access whenever, and we&#39;ve just created<br/>
and printed up food charts for the wall to give him the opportunity to tell<br/>
us if there&#39;s anything he wants from the fridge.<br/>
<br/>
But sleep-times. Gosh. Xander is still so young that it seemed only<br/>
yesterday I wasn&#39;t getting any sleep at all! I am absolutely terrified that<br/>
if I change his schedule (or let him dictate his schedule) it&#39;s going to<br/>
result in crusty mummy, crusty baby and, as a result, crusty daddy. I know<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t be projecting, but I feel his sleep-schedule is not only the<br/>
last truly structured thing in his life, but it&#39;s also the one thing that<br/>
will have the most impact if it all goes wrong.<br/>
<br/>
These last few weeks, since I have really &quot;let go&quot; and embraced the<br/>
unschooling/peaceful parenting philosophy, my relationship with my son has<br/>
been better than ever. Unbelievably better. Amazing even. I thought I was<br/>
relaxed before, but now I&#39;m on a completely different level. And I think as<br/>
a result of that, this &quot;enforced&quot; sleeping-schedule is rubbing him the<br/>
wrong way, and in the last couple of days he&#39;s really started getting angry<br/>
at bed-time. Tonight was the worst so far, hence this email!<br/>
<br/>
How do I let my 15-month-old have freedom to choose his sleeping times<br/>
(including having a bath at night - we live in the tropics so it&#39;s not<br/>
ideal to go to bed after sweating all day - though I do recognise that if<br/>
that DOES happen it&#39;s not the end of the world), without throwing our lives<br/>
(especially our sleep!) into absolutely chaos? I know I&#39;m dramatizing, but<br/>
I&#39;m truly struggling and I would appreciate any advice in this area.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance. :)<br/>
<br/>
With regards,<br/>
Jenna.<br/>
