<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602236172">&lt;&lt; I love the way you talk about the teen stuff Sandra. It really helps to <br/>
remember that we have more tools (weapons if used wrong) and to &quot;handicap&quot; <br/>
ourselves to give our children room. I need to do that more NOW and be more <br/>
prepared when they hit the teens....I&#39;ve only got one year, yikes!<br/>

I know where I learned it, and I&#39;ll tell you.<br/>
<br/>
Before Keith and I had kids, Keith said once that the only reason I won all <br/>
the arguments is that he wasn&#39;t allowed to use physical force.  That if <br/>
physical force was legal and socially accepted, then HE would win all the <br/>
arguments, but since we&#39;re limited to verbal, I win, and that it doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
I&#39;m always right, just that I argue better.<br/>
<br/>
That kinda hurt. And it was true.  So I quit winning all the arguments.  <br/>
Maybe because I didn&#39;t want him to start pinning me to the ground until I <br/>
said &quot;uncle,&quot; or worse.  Maybe just because he was right and it wasn&#39;t fair.<br/>
<br/>
So my friend Jeff (who incidently picked us up from a cold parking lot today <br/>
when the van broke down on the way back from our seeing The Lord of the <br/>
Rings) was getting married ten years or so ago.  I told him the story of <br/>
Keith&#39;s argument, and told him that I had to consciously STOP arguing Keith <br/>
to the ground until he said &quot;uncle&quot; every time.  And, I told Jeff, in his <br/>
case it would be much worse, because he was both physically AND verbally <br/>
superior to his wife-to-be, and that he would have to figure some way to give <br/>
her a chance to make her point.<br/>
<br/>
So from there the awareness got tried out on various other situations, and <br/>
the advice was given in a few other instances, and my kids got older, and the <br/>
rest is future history.<br/>
<br/>
BUT (the regular &quot;but&quot;):  What if someone&#39;s really totally asking to be taken <br/>
down?  THEN do I do it?  What if someone is physically threatening one of our <br/>
children and words aren&#39;t stopping them?  Does Keith use his formidable <br/>
physical force?<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t know the total answer to that question, when it&#39;s fair to <br/>
verbally pin someone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850766221">Sandra, these are really wise words, and I<br/>
need to think about them a lot.  I too often<br/>
take people down verbally, but am finding my<br/>
match in my own 6 year old.  I also win many<br/>
of the arguements with my husband simply<br/>
because I can.  But shoudl I?  That is the<br/>
question.  I really need to think about these<br/>
words.  Thank you.<br/>
