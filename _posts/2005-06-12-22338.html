If I had  to sign up for a program, I think I&#39;d prefer to reverse it and eat <br/>
a lot of  pizza to get a free book. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That makes sense.<br/>
And if you want to condition them not to like pizza, force them to finish  it <br/>
ALL, crusts too, before they can get the book.<br/>
 <br/>
We went to a swimming party yesterday.  Marty was the only of our kids  and <br/>
he&#39;s already 16.  The rest were nine or so down to two.   One mom let hers <br/>
(he&#39;s the odlest of that batch) get in the water as soon as  they got there.  They <br/>
had just driving 60 miles from Santa Fe, and it was  cool to see him just get <br/>
in right away.   A couple of younger ones  were forced to eat a hamburger and <br/>
finish their food before they could get  in.  One was made to keep sitting <br/>
until he ate potato chips.  It was a  little painful for me.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty, meanwhile, with the freedom to do whatever order he wanted, swam,  <br/>
ate; sat, talked; swam, played with kids, ate again.   He had a  peaceful, happy <br/>
afternoon.  He didn&#39;t get sunburned.  He voluntarily  spent several hours with <br/>
his parents (he knew most of the adults too) even  though it was only the day <br/>
before that he&#39;d gotten a new World of Warcraft game  and online account.  He <br/>
helped clean up when we were leaving, and when his  dad said upon arrival <br/>
home, &quot;I forgot my towel,&quot; Marty showed him that he had  had it.<br/>
 <br/>
I consider it evidence that we&#39;re doing something right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924184952">**I bet that was the original meaning of &quot;spoiled&quot; as regards children. <br/>
Nowadays it means that the kid wants too much. But in terms of <br/>
&quot;training,&quot; if a kid has too much stuff you can&#39;t bribe and threaten, so <br/>
you&#39;ve spoiled the ability to control his behavior with the promise of <br/>
food, privilege or material goods.**<br/>
<br/>
Ah!  This is a new thought for me.  Cool!<br/>
<br/>
**Honestly, a lot of the &quot;truths&quot; of conditioning and training and learning  <br/>
come from lab-rat &quot;proofs.&quot;  I hadn&#39;t thought of that for years and  years.  We <br/>
&quot;proved&quot; things with really hungry rats and people applied the  principles to <br/>
human children who didn&#39;t live in cages.<br/>
 <br/>
All that operant conditioning is out of style now in psych studies.  I  think <br/>
the effects remain in schools.**<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  A lot of &quot;educational&quot; practices rest on some shaky and OLD research.  Alfie Kohn (in Punished by Rewards) disses B. F. Skinner pretty strongly.  Most unschooling parents will enjoy his point of view, I think.  (He seems to let go of conventional thinking about learning and talk almost only from observations about learning taking place.  I think he&#39;s cool.)<br/>
<br/>
I have been known to try to win arguments on education methodology by saying &quot;Kids are smarter than lab rats&quot; when someone suggests that kids should be trained with rat pellet methods.   Maybe a few steps back in the conversation I would have tried to say &quot;These theories were tested on pigeons and lab rats...&quot;   (Those quotes make more sense in the reverse order, sorry.)<br/>
