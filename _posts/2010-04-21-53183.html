Ok, I&#39;ve seen this couple 3 times now on TV, and I&#39;ve gotta say,  Christine Yablonski is really a great speaker!  Dad is too, I love the way they interject with each other and compliment what the other is saying!  I want to meet them!  I know others have, but I haven&#39;t!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667812189">I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a big fan of Joy, but they did fabulously no allowing her to get the last word.  I would say that interview was the most positive piece on unschooling that I have seen.  It seems as though something is stirring.<br/>
