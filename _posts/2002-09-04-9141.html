&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t Believe Everything You Think &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh that&#39;s good!<br/>
<br/>
I have a little one that says &quot;Listen to Children&quot; is all.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were following a van with the whole back end totally plastered, <br/>
up to the roof.  One said &quot;If Mary had been pro-choice, there would be no <br/>
Christmas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So Holly wanted to know what all that was about.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But here are my thoughts for THIS group:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pro-choice and we have Christmas at my house. &lt;g&gt;  (facetious smart-ass <br/>
answer)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pro-choice and I have three children *by choice.*  I have been pregnant <br/>
three times and I have three children.  AND I&#39;m pro-choice.  HOW CAN THAT <br/>
BE!?  (I used birth control, and I lucked out.)<br/>
<br/>
And with me, at least I knew for sure who the father was.  Mary gets told by <br/>
her cousin and/or some angel that the same guy who helped her cousin get <br/>
pregnant has directly knocked HER up, when she was asleep or something, and <br/>
to tell her boyfriend/fiancee/husband/Joseph that really, it was okay.<br/>
<br/>
PERHAPS, under such circumstances (MY cousin and some angel) I might consider <br/>
an abortion.  <br/>
<br/>
But under my own circumstances, I was happy to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
But all I told Holly was just because someone is &quot;pro choice&quot; (after I <br/>
explained to her what it meant) didn&#39;t mean they had an abortion everytime <br/>
they got pregnant. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone should tell the Knights of Columbus that.<br/>
<br/>
 It was more sex education than I had planned for the afternoon.   I wonder <br/>
if the driver of that van has considered THAT.  With the bumper stickers so <br/>
many and so high, even kids riding in the car can see them.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My experience is that sex education is best done in the car.  Julian and I<br/>
&gt;have had incredible conversations in the car about this. (I still remember<br/>
&gt;when he announced why kissing always looked so weird in movies. <br/>
&gt;&quot;Mama...they<br/>
&gt;use their TONGUES!&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The big advantage, of course, is that when the parent is driving, eye <br/>
&gt;contact<br/>
&gt;is impossible. You can have all kinds of potentially embarassing<br/>
&gt;conversations without having to look at one another.<br/>

somewhere. (?) Kids! &lt;g&gt; So the other day Darin and I were discussing a <br/>
friend who is about to have a baby and Jack pops up from the back-seat and <br/>
says &quot;How did they find their baby? Was the baby in the ditch like me?&quot; So <br/>
after sorting out his confusion I explained that the baby is in our friends <br/>
womb. Jack wanted to know how that baby got in her tummy! So Darin told the <br/>
standard *When a mommy and daddy love each other, they might decide to make a <br/>
baby. So they hug and kiss and love each other and a baby grows in the mommys <br/>
womb.* Jack wanted more! Because, as he said, &quot;You guys hug and kiss and love <br/>
each other all the time and you only have Moly and me!&quot; Jack isn&#39;t too sure <br/>
about all that penis and vagina and sperm and egg stuff right now. He told <br/>
his dad at the store last night, he would rather just find a kid in a ditch. &lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its neither. The immaculate conception refers to Mary&#39;s birth, not Christ&#39;s, <br/>
from her mother Ann. The idea is that Mary was conceived without sin. <br/>
Therefore Mary was free from the original sin all man is supposedly born <br/>
with. Therefore she was the only true and right choice to be the mother of <br/>
the son of god. It is a Catholic belief, along with the belief that Mary was <br/>
and ever shall be a virgin, (no sex before or after Christ&#39;s birth, no other <br/>
children...) that not too many other Christian religious beliefs hold. <br/>

and someone of another denomination) whether or not Mary had other children. <br/>
The Catholics say No she didn&#39;t. They believe in the immaculate conception of <br/>
Mary and of the assumption into heaven of Mary. (i.e., since she was born <br/>
without sin, lived without sin and died without sin, she got to go straight <br/>
on up!) It is one of those Mysteries that you are just supposed to believe. &lt;g<br/>
