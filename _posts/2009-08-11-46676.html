<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334140237">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
My very right-brained 13(tomorrow)yo Aspie son Michael just got the word<br/>
that he is a finalist in the Transformer Contest &quot;Behold the Glory of<br/>
Jetfire&quot;. His latest special interest is Transformers and claymation.  He<br/>
hopes one day to be a director of sci-fi movies.  He produced this<br/>
stop-action claymation video despite technical difficulties such as his<br/>
mother dragging her feet on driving him to the store to get the clay. He<br/>
accomplished the whole thing without any intervention on my part save the<br/>
drive to the craft store. My first time seeing the film was when I received<br/>
an e-mail from him with the YouTube link.  How affirming it is to see what a<br/>
child can accomplish when he is allowed to run with his passion.  He is<br/>
completely self-taught and this is his first attempt at claymation.  We<br/>
started homeschooling (unschooling) less than a year ago.  It crossed my<br/>
mind that he was possibly just playing video games all day, but decided to<br/>
trust that even if that were true there was learning taking place.  I&#39;m very<br/>
excited for him that he is pursuing his gift and being affirmed in it.  So,<br/>
here is my shameless plea for you to click on the link below, then watch and<br/>
vote for finalist #3.  That&#39;s my boy!<br/>
