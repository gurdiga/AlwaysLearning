<div id="ygrps-yiv-236871098">I&#39;ve been following the thread about television and thinking about how the TV issue is really connected to money (for me, at least), how it gets spent, and what kind of input kids have when it comes to how the family spends money.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I don&#39;t have cable, but we do rent movies.  We get a few (mostly worthless) channels on the TV--nothing we can&#39;t live without.  We&#39;ll probably still have a TV when kids come along.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, when they do come along, the issue of whether or not to expand our TV horizons will involve discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of more TV (and I feel confident that a family could come to some kind of consensus on that), but it would also be a discussion about money.<br/>
<br/>
How do you involve kids in these kinds of discussions?  If money = power in this society, then how do we reverse this trend in an unschooling family?  Who gets to decide what we can spend money on and what we can&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of locked into this mindset of adults being authoritarian and having all the power when it comes to money.  That seems unfair, but I&#39;m finding it hard to envision it any other way.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing--do your kids get allowances?  I&#39;d really like to know an effective approach toward handling money in an inclusive way and with respect for all (and, of course, without burdening little ones too much with financial concerns).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids do sort of get an allowance.  They have chores that are not <br/>
optional and have nothing to do with allowance.  Then there are things <br/>
they can do around the house, for neighbors, etc, to earn some extra <br/>
money for the things they want that we just aren&#39;t going to buy for them <br/>
for no good reason at all.  They have an account with us where we tally <br/>
earnings and expenditures.  We don&#39;t often just hand them the cash as it <br/>
disappears into the recesses of their rooms never to be found again when <br/>
we do.  When they ask for one of those things we don&#39;t want to buy them, <br/>
we compare the price to how much they have in their account, how much <br/>
will be left, all the things they had to do to get it, etc.  They are <br/>
much more discriminating when it comes to spending their money that they <br/>
would be with ours.  My older son hoards money like a miser when he has <br/>
a savings goal.  He earned enough in less than a year for a Power Wheels <br/>
Harley Davidson motorcycle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-688549989">My 5 yo gets $5/week -- enough so that she can buy a small toy if she wants to, or save for a bigger toy (like a barbie or playdough set) in an amount of time that is conceivable to a five year old.   She likes to window shop the toy stores, thinking about what she&#39;d like to save her allowance for.  The first couple of months, it seemed to burn a whole in her pocket -- as soon as she got it she wanted to spend it -- now she is more concerned with finding something that she wants to own, rather than just spending money because she has some.  I think she has about $20 saved right now. <br/>
 <br/>
The money isn&#39;t tied to her behavior in any way.  It is the line item in the family budget for Lydia discretionary spending, similar to the line item that my husband and I each have.  The baby does not have a line item yet. : - )<br/>

I don&#39;t buy anything expensive without asking my husband.  When we were <br/>
really young and I was the sole income it was still the same way. He doesn&#39;t spend <br/>
a lot without asking me.<br/>
<br/>
When we were young, &quot;a lot&quot; was maybe $10 or $15.  Now it&#39;s $40 or so.  <br/>
<br/>
If one of the kids wants something expensive, if it&#39;s good for the whole <br/>
family, we discuss getting it.  Sometimes we have.  Sometimes we help them out or <br/>
match funds or give an advance on allowance.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has a job and makes real money.  We hint sometimes that he might want <br/>
to save more, but we ultimately let him spend it however he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
They all get allowance, starting when they were five.  It&#39;s 75 cents per week <br/>
per year of age.  We&#39;ve decided this is Kirby&#39;s last year of allowance; he&#39;s <br/>
17 and gets $12.75. Holly gets $8.25.  Sometimes they don&#39;t collect and they <br/>
let it build up in &quot;the bank of dad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve tried not to be stingy with the kids.  They&#39;ve been really honest with <br/>
us, I think directly because we&#39;re not cruel or inflexible about money.  A <br/>
couple of weeks ago Marty was going bowling with some other homeschoolers, and at <br/>
the last minute Holly wanted to go. I handed Marty $40.  He brought back <br/>
change and accounted for everything.  They&#39;ve always done this, and because <br/>
they&#39;re so careful and precise, we trust them with money they same way we would <br/>
trust ourselves.  By that I mean if I were to have gone bowling with them so I <br/>
could pay for things, it would have cost even more (at least a soda for me) but <br/>
we&#39;ve always discussed what&#39;s good use of money and they know if they bring <br/>
back change they&#39;re more likely to get money in the future without problems.<br/>
<br/>
This might sound lame, but it&#39;s almost like once we got the goodness-siphon <br/>
going, it just keeps going on its own power.  Each act or decision builds on <br/>
the last.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that this could work with people who already have a bad <br/>
relationship with a child, but with starting from birth, I&#39;ve seen it work well in <br/>
lots of families<br/>
<br/>
Trust and openness.  Honesty and generosity.<br/>
<br/>
Both Marty and Holly have been known FREQUENTLY to talk me out of spending <br/>
money when we&#39;re out.<br/>
<br/>
Last Sunday we left for a three+ hour car ride to my sister&#39;s.  Holly and <br/>
Kirby said it was too early to eat, they weren&#39;t hungry. I took <br/>
apples/cheese/nuts in the car for later, and a bottle of juice.  Everyone had water.   Keith <br/>
went through Burger King and he and Marty ordered food.  The others could have <br/>
changed their minds and ordered, but they really weren&#39;t hungry.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, if there was ANYTHING to be bought--food toys--I by god <br/>
wanted my share.  I had a neediness my kids just have never had.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980067101">It was pretty simple for me to see that the programming my kids enjoy is not included in basic cable.  For dh, the sports events he likes to watch also are in the expanded basic, not the flat basic package.  My kids do watch some things that are of no value to me, yet I&#39;ve watched with them and seen ways that is does have value to them.  Some of the other things they choose to watch, all on their own, are just amazing.<br/>
<br/>
I watch very little TV beyond what I sit and watch when other family members are viewing.  OTH, I LOVE cable internet for its speed and instant accessibility and for not tying up the phone line.  I wouldn&#39;t even consider asking my family to give up cable TV, which I rarely use on my own, unless I were will to give up cable internet, which I&#39;m not, unless things got really, really tight.<br/>

<br/>
I reported here a while back that the first week Kirby had his license and I <br/>
was letting him go out and he had the go to be gone overnight or all day, he <br/>
kept coming back!!<br/>
<br/>
If I had permission to be out until midnight when I was a teenager, I would <br/>
NOT have risked stopping by the house for anything, lest my mom take it back.  <br/>
And if I had permission to be out overnight, I would have stayed out overnight <br/>
even if I had to sleep in the car, because such freedoms were rare.<br/>
<br/>
So there was Kirby, in his own bed, the first night he had permission to keep <br/>
the car out overnight.<br/>
<br/>
He said he was too long for his friend&#39;s couch now, and it just wasn&#39;t going <br/>
to be comfortable.  When he had gotten tired, he wanted to sleep in his own <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well for us tv is not about money but more about<br/>
family preferences and comfort levels, as I explained.<br/>
 We cannot afford cable right now, but we stopped<br/>
watching tv when we could still afford it.  Perhaps<br/>
later when our kids are older, and we have the money,<br/>
we will consider getting it again for the range of<br/>
interesting and entertaining things it brings.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids get some allowance.  I would like to be able<br/>
to give them .75 to $1 a week/yr of age, but we cannot<br/>
afford that right now.  My husband, our sole income,<br/>
has been out of work in this lame economy for over 7<br/>
months.  There is an illustration for you of where a<br/>
college degree gets you.  It&#39;s get you a loan that you<br/>
have to defer while you are on unemployment.  However,<br/>
we do give them several dollars once a month and we go<br/>
specifically to a &quot;General Store&quot; sorta like Walmart,<br/>
a little of everything, so they can get themselves a<br/>
little something.  That&#39;s about as much as we spend on<br/>
luxuries for ourselves, relatively, so we feel it&#39;s<br/>
fair.  Food luxuries are in a different budget and I<br/>
generally make everything from scratch so my labor is<br/>
involved.  For candy they have a jar that gets filled<br/>
twice a month and they can eat it all in a couple of<br/>
days or make it last.  Usually they choose to make it<br/>
last.  If one of them wants to eat it all and the<br/>
other wants to make his last, then they split it in<br/>
1/2 and the sugar craving one eats his half.<br/>
<br/>
As to power, we ask them to have responsibility for<br/>
some of the chores around the house (mainly picking up<br/>
toys and clothes) and they also help voluntarily<br/>
sometimes with cooking, dishes, stacking firewood, or<br/>
other chores.  We only exert &quot;parental authority&quot; when<br/>
it involves safety, destruction of our things, or<br/>
abusive behavior.  We talk about what being a family<br/>
means in terms of helping each other, sharing<br/>
responsibilities, supporting each other in all ways,<br/>
and being together.  We talk about fairness when they<br/>
want us to do their share or they are making more work<br/>
for us and refusing to help with it; like refusing to<br/>
help clean up mud and soap and whatnot (from &quot;potion<br/>
making&quot;) in the bathroom sink that has clogged up the<br/>
drain; or making a big food mess from spills or<br/>
playing in the kitchen and refusing to help clean up. <br/>
For the most part we don&#39;t have to even ask, but when<br/>
they need reminding, they are really reasonable about<br/>
helping out most of the time.  We don&#39;t often pull<br/>
rank unless it&#39;s behavior so bad they get physically<br/>
removed from the room or house until they are ready to<br/>
be human.<br/>

<br/>
I think these are valuable questions.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have full answers, but awareness is the first step.<br/>
<br/>
Not shutting kids off is valuable.  I think there are some parents who <br/>
fell guilty saying &quot;no&quot; and can&#39;t stand to listen to begging or whining. <br/>
  They want to get through the uncomfortable moment quickly and won&#39;t <br/>
tolerate any negative feedback from their kids.  Clearly that kind of <br/>
refusal to listen doesn&#39;t promote involving kids in decisions. (I don&#39;t <br/>
think very many unschoolers act like this, but lots of mainstream <br/>
parents do.)<br/>
<br/>
For me, because I say &quot;yes&quot; to my child so much of the time, I&#39;m not at <br/>
all uncomfortable when I say &quot;no&quot;, because at that point I&#39;m saying &quot;no&quot; <br/>
for a reason.  I&#39;m no where near perfect and I&#39;m sure there are times <br/>
when I say &quot;we can&#39;t afford it&quot; when it might actually be possible to <br/>
scrape up the money if *I* really wanted to.  I probably need to be <br/>
better informed about our budget and keep better track of our monthly <br/>
discretionary spending.<br/>
<br/>
But, my child does feel free when we are having a spending debate to get <br/>
my attention by offering to kick in part of his allowance for something. <br/>
  By offering to put his money where his mouth is (not that I prompt him <br/>
to do that) he encourages me to see that he is serious.<br/>
<br/>
I hope others have more and better stuff to say.<br/>
