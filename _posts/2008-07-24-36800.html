<div id="ygrps-yiv-32408230">My dd is 6.5yo, and I know she must be going through a phase, but I am <br/>
feeling more and more baffled by how to support her.  I was curious if <br/>
folks who have older girls could give me a little insight into how this <br/>
phase looked for them and if they found anything that helped keep their <br/>
relationship sane during the months (years?) of growth and development <br/>
through the phase.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen it coming, but have tended to attribute the incidents to <br/>
her being tired or hungry but in the past couple of weeks it has gotten <br/>
very intense.  She is very negative, argumentative, she is *mean* to <br/>
her friends, siblings, grandmother, parents (name calling, hitting, <br/>
snatching things away, pushing, yelling), gets very angry about sharing <br/>
or helping ... it seems so *normal* but the intensity is Wow!  I find <br/>
myself saying things that I am ashamed of, I try to be transparent in <br/>
my processing of what is happening and walk away when necessary, take <br/>
deep breaths, drink a glass of tea or water -- but I don&#39;t know.    <br/>
<br/>
We have talked about it in calmer moments, she doesn&#39;t really like it <br/>
when she gets in that state of mind, but is at a loss for how to draw <br/>
herself out of it, as am I.  The friend she had over the other day told <br/>
her mother that she never wanted to come and play with dd again -- this <br/>
is heartbreaking as they have always been good friends, but inspite of <br/>
my atempts throughout the day to help with communication, gentle <br/>
reminders, and even pulling her aside to have a heart to heart, she was <br/>
just stuck ( would have called off the playdate but the other girl&#39;s <br/>
mother was out of town for the day).  We have some bach flower remedies <br/>
and call them her secret potion, and we put it in her water bottle.  It <br/>
seems to help a little.  Even I take rescue rememdy when I find myself <br/>
being drawn deeply into an empty conflict, find myself acting like the <br/>
7 year old girl I must have been.  I know that I have something huge to <br/>
learn through my relationship with her, I think that this may be my <br/>
moment to step it up.  <br/>
<br/>
I have looked at the books available through Amazon, and wasn&#39;t <br/>
thrilled with any of the descriptions or reviews -- any suggestions for <br/>
reading?  <br/>
<br/>
I am also feeling anxious about this because DH is feeling like we need <br/>
to be more punitive.  I found/she led me to Unconditional Parenting <br/>
because punitive wasn&#39;t working with her when we went through a similar <br/>
phase when she was about 3 or 4 -- so I really can&#39;t imagine that it <br/>
would work this time.  I remind him of this, but he wan&#39;t to take away <br/>
things, take away playdates, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
A break from playdates may be good for her right now, but not as a <br/>
punishment -- she would notice if I just stopped planning things <br/>
because her siblings would be having things going on and she would be <br/>
asking about it, I would need to be more consensual and include her in <br/>
that conversation (I have already put it out there for her to think <br/>
about).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insight,<br/>

Try to do things with her that are side-by-side.  Maybe even take   <br/>
her for an overnight visit (if you&#39;re not nursing a baby and can get  <br/>
away for a day or so) and just BE with her, in the car, walking  <br/>
around.  Maybe she&#39;ll start to tell you what&#39;s up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850932164">I agree that there might very well be something of a  specific &#39;phase&#39; that<br/>
happens around 6-7.  After I read what Sandra wrote I thought &#39;yeah, that&#39;s<br/>
about when Anna started voicing her need to have alone time with me&#39;.  So,<br/>
Whatever it is, be it emotions that they just have to have support to work<br/>
out, giving them that special attention when you can might do wonders. <br/>

The Explosive Child by Ross Greene might be really helpful. He is a respected psychologist who spends the beginning of the book using way worse examples and explaining why punishment doesn&#39;t work. He then walks through identifying triggers, making the environment more &quot;user friendly&quot; (how we got to unschooling), prioritizing issues and using collaborative problem solving. The collaborative problem solving is huge because it is nonjudgmental, unconditional, supportive and it works. <br/>

brother is 3.  (The last time she went through a similar phase we did <br/>
have a new baby.)<br/>
<br/>
She wanted to go to school for about a week last summer.  We had some <br/>
good conversations, talked about some options (turned out it was <br/>
because a friend had been hit by a golf cart at a lodge and she felt <br/>
that since she didn&#39;t go to school she wouldn&#39;t know about that kind of <br/>
thing and could get hurt -- ironically it was another homeschooler who <br/>
was hurt), and then it just kind of faded off.  This spring she told me <br/>
several times how glad she was that she didn&#39;t have to go to school and <br/>
could stay home and play and do art all day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks you, that is good food for thought.  I just noticed that Kit <br/>
Kitteredge is playing for one week only starting on Friday at our local <br/>
theater, so I made a date with her to go see that movie.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not nursing anymore, I have been away from my kids overnight only <br/>
once for surgery so it freaks me out a little to leave them, but I <br/>
think this is an excellent tip -- as soon as I read it my whole body <br/>
gave a resounding, intuitive *YES*, guess I should take that as a sign <br/>
and get something planned.  It would be so much fun -- I am sure she <br/>
would love doing *girly* things for an evening, plus sleeping away with <br/>
just mom.  With so many males in the house everything always seems to <br/>
be tinted *boy.*  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great tips!<br/>
