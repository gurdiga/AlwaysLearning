&quot;Of Jeoffry, His Cat&quot;<br/>
by Christopher Smart (1763)<br/>
<br/>
For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry.<br/>
For he is the servant of the Living God, duly and daily serving him.<br/>
For at the first glance of the glory of God in the East he worships<br/>
   in his way.<br/>
For this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with<br/>
   elegant quickness.<br/>
For then he leaps up to catch the musk, which is the blessing of<br/>
   God upon his prayer.<br/>
For he rolls upon prank to work it in.<br/>
For having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider<br/>
    himself.<br/>
For this he performs in ten degrees.<br/>
For first he looks upon his fore-paws to see if they are clean.<br/>
For secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there.<br/>
For thirdly he works it upon stretch with the fore-paws extended.<br/>
For fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood.<br/>
For fifthly he washes himself.<br/>
For sixthly he rolls upon wash.<br/>
For seventhly he fleas himself, that he may not be interrupted upon<br/>
   the beat.<br/>
For eighthly he rubs himself against a post.<br/>
For ninthly he looks up for his instructions.<br/>
For tenthly he goes in quest of food.<br/>
For having consider&#39;d God and himself he will consider his neighbor...<br/>
For he can catch the cork and toss it again.<br/>
For he is hated by the hypocrite and miser.<br/>
For the former is afraid of detection.<br/>
For the latter refuses the charge.<br/>
For he camels his back to bear the first notion of business.<br/>
For he is good to think on, if a man would express himself neatly.<br/>
For he made a great figure in Egypt for his signal services.<br/>
For he killed the Icneumon-rat very pernicious by land.<br/>
For his ears are so acute that they sting again.<br/>
For from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention.<br/>
For by stroaking of him I have found out electricity.<br/>
For I preceived God&#39;s light about him both wax and fire.<br/>
For the Electrical fire is the spiritual substance, which God sends<br/>
   from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast.<br/>
For God has blessed him in the variety of his movements.<br/>
For, tho&#39; he cannot fly, he is an excellent clamberer.<br/>
For his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other<br/>
   quadrepede.<br/>
For he can tread to all the measures upon the musick.<br/>
For he can swim for life.<br/>
For he can creep.</div>
