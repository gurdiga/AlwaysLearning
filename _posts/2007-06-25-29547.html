<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559887017">The 2007 UGO ( Unschoolers Gathering of Ohio) camp-out will be August 23<br/>
- 26 in the beautiful Hockings Hills area of Ohio (1 hour S.E. of<br/>
Columbus).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The UGO gatherings are open to all unschoolers of Ohio and nearby<br/>
states, as a means for unschooling families to simply have fun, relax<br/>
and share time with other unschoolers - ie, families homeschooling in a<br/>
non-traditional, non-schoolly schoolly style, who follow a more<br/>
child-led, interest based, self-directed, life learning, relaxed or<br/>
eclectic approach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re SO excited about this gathering!  Our camp has over 600 acre of<br/>
scenic rolling hills, caves, hollows and hiking trails.  The camp also<br/>
has an outdoor pool (with life guards), volleyball and basketball<br/>
courts, indoor gymnasium, large group fire ring and gathering area,<br/>
along with several small fire rings among our cabin area and last but<br/>
not least...  LOTS of open space for Capture the Flag!  We also have<br/>
full use of their large dining hall for eating, meeting and mingling<br/>
anytime throughout our stay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also have lots of funshops planned throughout the weekend, for kids<br/>
and adults.  Including a fireside chat on &quot;Unschooling&quot; ( led by<br/>
a mom of 7 with 3 unschooled, successful adults) and another fireside<br/>
chat on &quot;Unschoolers Getting Accepted into College&quot; ( led by a<br/>
mom who&#39;s oldest was unschooled and recently accepted into an Ivy League<br/>
college for this fall).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Space is limited,  so please do not delay and register soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541058906">Oh oh, oh oh...<br/>
<br/>
two of my children were born in SE Ohio (Athens) and the other two were only<br/>
1 and 2 when we moved there. All four of my kids consider themselves from<br/>
there (we lived there for 12 years) and I have LOVELY memories of the<br/>
beautiful Hocking Hills forest that you&#39;ll be gathering at. We&#39;ve been to<br/>
that pool, those caves, hills and hiking trails, and the lodge...that place<br/>
is a treasure...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the smile and memories...<br/>
