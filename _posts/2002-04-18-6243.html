<div id="ygrps-yiv-808407657">I like what Elissa has to say about the way we communicate... When I read<br/>
&quot;prove&quot; &quot;justify&quot; etc and those other words that indicate somene is telling<br/>
me what to do it puts my back up (as we say in England)... I do think it&#39;s<br/>
important to write words in the way we actually say them or are said to<br/>
us... Only then can someone truly respond in a way that is clear.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure that Dawn&#39;s statement is simply about unschooling. It<br/>
<br/>
reminds me of going out with friends without Joe. Sometimes people would<br/>
<br/>
say, Joe will *let* you go out? (What am I? His slave?)(he just looked over<br/>
<br/>
my shoulder and said, &quot;Yes, you are&quot; - In his dreams!!)<br/>
<br/>
I still call him and make sure he doesn&#39;t have plans or something but I make<br/>
<br/>
my own decisions just as he does. It&#39;s the way we phrase things in our<br/>
<br/>
society that harken back to the days before women&#39;s liberation.<br/>
<br/>
My husband won&#39;t let me.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Policeman says.... (from a toy)<br/>
<br/>
Look at all the fireMEN!<br/>
<br/>
I sence alot of the same when we talk about our DHs, that we have to prove<br/>
<br/>
our intentions to the man of the house. I don&#39;t think we mean to come across<br/>
<br/>
this way, but it makes it more difficult for women to be seen as powerful<br/>
<br/>
and knowledgeable when we talk in this way.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s good to usethem in a new way so we think differently.<br/>
<br/>
Drive me nuts when a pregnant or nursing mother says &quot;My doctor won&#39;t let <br/>
me...&quot; or &quot;The doctor says I have to...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So when I was involved in Cesarean Prevention (and active in La Leche League, <br/>
but not a leader) I used to say, wide-eyed, &quot;You mean he suggested you do <br/>
that?&quot;  And the obvious thought in their eyes seemed to show they hadn&#39;t <br/>
really heard themselves, or maybe they hadn&#39;t really considered ever that <br/>
&#39;doctors&#39; orders&#39; were just recommendations.<br/>
