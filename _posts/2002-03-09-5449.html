&lt;&lt; We now state officially that kids should be accompanied by a <br/>
responsible adult at all times. Then we leave it up to the responsible ADULTS <br/>
to decide what that means in their own individual case. Some kids are fine on <br/>
their own. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m used to SCA events where everyone there is in the organization.  There <br/>
will be an aspect of that here, but more outsiders, too.  As crowded as it <br/>
will be, I doubt anyone would get Holly away and alone from other people so I <br/>
can&#39;t foresee any concerns.  If we have a meeting place (like maybe our ROOM <br/>
if it&#39;s not two buildings away and in a parking lot, or a place near the <br/>
speaker&#39;s table or somewhere Holly would feel comfortable hanging out) and if <br/>
she knows which rooms my workshops are in, she&#39;ll be okay.   She&#39;s a good <br/>
swimmer, and she can read well enough for me to leave her changes of plans in <br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s saying she&#39;s too shy for the talent show.  I don&#39;t really think so, <br/>
but maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m not too shy!! &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ll probably get her to do something with me, <br/>
or maybe I&#39;ll be her accompanist (on guitar, or recorder, or vocal duet or <br/>
some such).<br/>

and game room, they could be found in the pool.  There is a few groups of <br/>
young girls running around.  My dd doesn&#39;t know what to do for the talent<br/>
show, but my son is going to do his pogo stick! <br/>
