<div id="ygrps-yiv-823853807">We have five so we would have to get two rooms, but MAYBE if another family<br/>
of five is in the same predicament, we could split a second room and have a<br/>
kid<br/>
or two of theirs share with a kid or two of ours?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to think about it without mentioning it to the kids.  It&#39;s a<br/>
kind<br/>
of sudden investment situation.  But to be with other unschooling whole<br/>
families for that long is a huge temptation.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am hugely intrigued by this cruise!  We are a family of 5, well actually 6<br/>
counting the<br/>
baby. I am sure they will make me count him for a cruise though. He will be<br/>
just one at<br/>
that time.  I was thinking the same thing about sharing a room. My parents<br/>
love to<br/>
travel, sothey might be willling to go with us.  Guess I better check out<br/>
airfares. That<br/>
could blow us out of the water.  I think that price (not that I have ever<br/>
checked)<br/>
seems really reasonable for a family for a week vacation to exotic locals.<br/>
And wow,<br/>
with unschoolers to boot?  I better go check the airline link....<br/>
