    Vegetarian marshmalows? I thought marshmallows were made of nothing but<br/>

Oh, trust me...you SO don&#39;t want to know how they make gelatin. But there are <br/>
bones involved.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s hooves and horns...or maybe just hooves.<br/>
Also, if a person was vegan the sugar wouldn&#39;t be acceptable. The bleaching <br/>
process uses animal bones...that&#39;s why vegans use raw sugar or some other <br/>
sweetener (other than honey of course)<br/>
****************************<br/>
The ones we got, actually, are vegan, and use Non-bone-char processed sugar, <br/>
as well as real vanilla. They&#39;re yummy, actually, but they have a different <br/>
shape and texture than regular marshmallows.<br/>

<br/>
What helped me get over the assembly-line model was looking at it as the <br/>
assembly line model it is.   <br/>
<br/>
If you were building a car by hand from scratch at home, doing the machining <br/>
and body and carving wooden parts and upholstering your own seats, it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
matter too much when you put the mirrors on.   But if you were the right-hand <br/>
mirror attachment guy at an automotive assembly line, you&#39;d put the mirror on <br/>
when the car came by, without thought to anything else about the car.  <br/>
<br/>
And in school&#39;s model, that factory assembly line would go on for years and <br/>
every new section would check that mirror again, or maybe take it off and put a <br/>
different one on, and by the time the vehicle came to the end of the line the <br/>
engineering would be outdated, the parts not nearly as nice as could have <br/>
been if it hadn&#39;t taken so long, and some percentage of those would be kinda <br/>
lemony or imperfect, but as long as MOST outlived their warranties,  that&#39;s <br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
And people aren&#39;t like cars anyway.  There are no mirrors to attach.  They <br/>
grow their own mirrors, or they lose the will to do so.   People figure out <br/>
their own coping tools, or they give up in frustration.  Unschooling involves <br/>
(among other things) an attempt to keep the frustration down and the free will up. <br/>
  If a child is growing as safely and securely as he can, his natural <br/>
abilities can get him through to adulthood.  If he has  interesting, benevolent <br/>
surroundings, he&#39;ll thrive.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking of a series of twelve or thirteen little stages, I came <br/>
to think of it as one big stage, and figured if my kids knew the basics by the <br/>
time they were 18, that would be fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
After more experience and looking around at all the others I could see, find <br/>
or hear about, I&#39;ve relaxed that 18 thing too.  For one thing, learning has <br/>
come easier to my kids than I thought it would.  For another, 18 is no magic <br/>
number.  Lots of adults report that their spelling improved, or they finally <br/>
&quot;got&quot; math, or they came to care about world geography, or whatever, in their 20&#39;s <br/>
or 30&#39;s.  And lots of them went to school their whole lives.<br/>
<br/>
I was told that intro, presentation, review and reinforcement were the best <br/>
plan to reinforce learning.  Interestingly today, I&#39;m going to play a game with <br/>
five or six (forgot to ask) classrooms of midschoolers.  The periods are <br/>
short here.  I&#39;m worried about not getting to a summary or explanation before they <br/>
leave.  If the game is too interesting,  I might not get to tell them how it <br/>
worked, which is the whole point, or leave them with the curiosities to keep <br/>
them thinking about it later.  <br/>
<br/>
Yet in my kids&#39; lives, the whole series of intro, presentation, review and <br/>
reinforcement are cut down to awareness and reinforcement.   The learn of a <br/>
thing (word, object, creature, concept, event, place, whatever) and a minute or a <br/>
year or two later they see it mentioned again, and at some point they might or <br/>
might not ask or investigate (research).   I used to be happier if that all <br/>
happened in a short span of time.   Now I&#39;m confident it will eventually happen.<br/>
<br/>
I still make connections between things I learned a long time ago and things <br/>
I come across now.   Just last week I started figured out one of the mysteries <br/>
of my grammatical life.  On exercises and in English workbooks in third and <br/>
fourth and a few later grades, they made sure we knew that &quot;let us&quot; (let&#39;s) do <br/>
this was not &quot;leave us&quot; do this.   Who the heck would say &quot;leave us go&quot;?  I&#39;d <br/>
never heard it misused.  It was apparently some midwestern or eastern U.S. <br/>
thing.  Not our problem.<br/>
<br/>
Decades of interset in English language history and medieval history <br/>
followed.  No clues connected in my head.   <br/>
<br/>
Last week, because of some early-19th century dialog in Sense and <br/>
Sensibility, I made the connection.  I still don&#39;t know where the early 20th century <br/>
holdovers were or why (but if anyone here knows I&#39;m interested), but here&#39;s my <br/>
little news:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s&quot; means &quot;let us.&quot;<br/>
In the past 800 years or so, English moved slowly through and out of some <br/>
serious feudal and class stuff.   Even Victorian etiquette is always very clear <br/>
on the duties and privilege of host and hostess.   Even now, people will say <br/>
&quot;May I be excused?&quot; when they want to leave a dinner table, and the person who <br/>
excuses you is the ranking female, probably (hostess) or male (depending).<br/>
<br/>
And the formal way to ask (historically) is &quot;May I have your leave to <br/>
[whatever:  depart or go, usually]?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Will you give me leave to go?<br/>
May I have leave to visit?   (military &quot;leave&quot; kicks in)<br/>
<br/>
Having leave means someone lets you do something.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let me go&quot; (used more now when someone is physically holding someone) is an <br/>
exact parallel of the &quot;give me leave to go&quot; of a social holding.<br/>
<br/>
Leave and let ARE related.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fifty.  I was happy to figure it out.  I didn&#39;t really try to, though.  I <br/>
figured it would come by in the info stream or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717939819">Another one, in the military, if an officer and an enlisted were walking, and the enlisted comes up behind the officer and needs to pass, they are supposed to say &quot;By your leave?&quot; and get &quot;permission&quot; to pass by. There are a couple other similar situations where that question is supposed to be asked. Technically. Most places aren&#39;t that formal, but it&#39;s among the things taught in boot camp.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864830129">I have been thoughtfully reading the discussion about<br/>
canvases and cleaning (I think that was on this list,<br/>
wasn&#39;t it?), and thought I would take it to heart<br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
I went into my 12yos room and started cleaning and<br/>
organizing his work space, where he paints his LOTR<br/>
figures for his gaming.<br/>
<br/>
I put all the figures into shoe boxes, or old gundam<br/>
boxes, put the paints all in an empty baby wipes box,<br/>
the brushes in a cup, cleared off the clutter without<br/>
throwing anything away that wasn&#39;t obviously trash,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I laid a big piece of red posterboard down on the desk<br/>
and duct-taped it down, and arranged his paints and<br/>
brushes and put a shoe box lid down to put the painted<br/>
figures to dry.<br/>
<br/>
He came in and was so excited.  He said, &quot;Oh momma,<br/>
thank you!  Now I just want to PAINT!&quot;  And pulled up<br/>
his chair, turned on one of his G.A. Henty audiobooks,<br/>
and settled in for the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
What a great feeling!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m fairly new to the list as well, with a 5yo daughter.  What I&#39;m really<br/>
getting right now is that &quot;now&quot; is really all we&#39;ve got... it&#39;s amazing how<br/>
much I find myself thinking about what &quot;should&quot; be with respect to many<br/>
aspects of life, and this just distracts me from what is now.  And when I<br/>
am focused and amazed by what my daughter is doing right now we all have<br/>
fun.<br/>

It took me a while to realize that it was the one-on-one attention from me that she enjoyed not the actual work (I must be slow).<br/>
<br/>
Then I tried a waldorf style preschool curriculum and it mainly focused on the rythem of the day and not much else. We still enjoy an unconsistent morning circle time with song and movement but other then that not much kept there attention (who knows maybe I was doing it wrong) but none of us were happy with it.<br/>
<br/>
So I stopped, I stopped trying, telling, and leading and just listened and watched. And boom.....Ariz likes reading and writing. Every morning she wakes up and grabs her notebook and starts writting she has started writing words now that she is bored with mastering her and our names. She loves grabbing &#39;real&#39; books and skimming throught them and reading the words she knows, sounding out some and asking me for help when she wants it. Right now she is hauling around &quot;The Poetry of Zen&quot;. She also tries to read any written letter she sees when we are out and about.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve heard that this is somewhat the consept of &#39;unschooling&#39;, so here I am, trying to expand my knowlage on the subject and figure out how to interest Ariz in other things -though I am perfectly fine with her being obsessed with reading and writing right now.<br/>
<br/>
Alex is into dramatic play with his toys and drawing shapes. I know there is a lot to learn in his &#39;simple&#39; play so I am just letting him enjoy and explore what he is interested in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927795495">I wanted to pop in and say hello. I homeschool my 2 girls, grades 5th and 12th (this is our 9th year.) We have used various ways to learn, unit studies, textbooks, having the kids pick what they want to learn. The 12th grader is set in her textbook ways and is also attending some college classes this year. <br/>
<br/>
However, the 5th grader hates them, and has only been assigned them so I could help the teen pass her classes. This year I&#39;ve tried to relax our homeschooling. We moved to Sonlight which is mostly just reading all day.<br/>
<br/>
I have been very curious about unschooling, although I have no clue how I, a diehard book learner (I love taking notes, using textbooks) is supposed to let go and let the child learn unstructured. Especially with regards to math.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I joined this group. To learn from you all, to soak in all the ideas, knowledge you provide on unschooling. I&#39;ve read several of John Holt&#39;s books and have ordered them again from the library to reread. <br/>
<br/>
Any help on how to gradually step into unschooling would be appreciated. <br/>

If you HAVE &quot;a 5th grader&quot; you need to undo that. Maybe you have an  <br/>
eleven year old.<br/>
<br/>
You assign a girl &quot;book work&quot; so that you can help another child do  <br/>
bookwork?   This list can&#39;t help you unless you&#39;re willing to turn  <br/>
away from that, and let it go.  Let it dissipate into the air.  It is  <br/>

ways that it&#39;s hard to know where to begin.<br/>
<br/>
What textbooks yield, when they yield something other than a fear or  <br/>
hatred of math, is equivalent to a bunch of memorized vocabulary  <br/>
words with no understanding of how to use them to actually  <br/>
communicate anything.<br/>
<br/>
What unschooled kids learn is how to communicate. The learn how  <br/>
numbers work. They learn how to make numbers give them the answers  <br/>
they want. They bounce around the various tools of math, pick up bits  <br/>
and pieces here and there to fill in gaps as they need them. Slowly a  <br/>
larger parts of the picture emerge from the bits they get to work. It  <br/>
happens very much the way kids learn to speak, which looks nothing  <br/>
like Spanish class, and yet works way way better!<br/>

Does your younger daughter like reading all day?  If not, what does she like to do?  That is where to start.  Move in the direction of what she does like.  If she likes reading, but not the sonlight stuff, let her read whatever it is she does like.  When she&#39;s done reading, let her naturally move onto something else she likes to do.<br/>

For me, it was one of the most inspiring articles pertaining to math.  It&#39;s not about unschooling really, more about why the way in which math is taught, maybe isn&#39;t so great.<br/>
Math is all around us, the ideas, the concepts, numbers, reasoning, strategy, all of it.  Once you start to see how math is really used in daily life, you might just relax a bit.  I&#39;m surprised by the math that is taught in schools.  It&#39;s very overwhelming, and stuff that I&#39;ve never had a use for in my life.  While I understand that there are uses for such mathematics, not everyone pursues those interests in which it&#39;s needed.&gt;&gt;&gt;   <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the links to specific areas I&#39;m trying to work on. I will read them diligently.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have a wonderful 10 year old. And yes, I know the textbooks do not work. They certainly don&#39;t retain the information for any length of time. This week we had a lovely time of just hanging out. We read most of the time, playing card and boardgames (Math wars being the fav, war while shouting out how the numbers multiply by each other.)<br/>
<br/>
The whole reason I joined this list was to learn more about unschooling and how we can incorporate that into our lives. I&#39;m not at that step yet fully, but am learning. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much.<br/>
