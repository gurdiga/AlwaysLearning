Isn&#39;t governmental red tape just fascinating? Sheesh!<br/>
When I was trying to get WIC coupons during my pregnancy with Jalen, they <br/>
insisted on a pregnancy test from a Doctor. I was going to a midwife, that <br/>
wasn&#39;t OFFICIAL enough for them.<br/>
I was about 7 months pregnant, big belly, baby kicking. Wasn&#39;t THAT enough <br/>
proof for them? <br/>
At one frustrating point I asked her if she&#39;d like me to lift my shirt and <br/>
feel the baby kicking!! DUH.<br/>

I was about 7 months pregnant, big belly, baby kicking. Wasn&#39;t THAT enough <br/>
proof for them?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went to the HMO when I was seven months pregnant with Holly, after all <br/>
their testing dates were past, and they said &quot;Where have YOU been?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hiding out from YOU guys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were *so* unamused at my truthful joviality.<br/>
<br/>
The only requirement on their list I could still qualify for was the <br/>
pregnancy test.  I said, &quot;Really?&quot; and gave them such a truthfully jovial <br/>
look that they decided not to embarrass themselves by doing a pregnancy test.<br/>
<br/>
Then they wanted to schedule a Cesarean.  I wasn&#39;t interested in a THIRD 24 <br/>
hours of labor, being at 10 cm and pushing for hours, as I had done with both <br/>
Kirby and Marty, followed by a Cesarean.  So I told them I didn&#39;t want to <br/>
have the 25 to 36 hours of labor, I would cut straight to the cesarean (ooh! <br/>
ghost of Freud!), and I would come in when I was in labor.  They said &quot;but <br/>
but but...&quot; and I said until I&#39;m in labor, I&#39;m not coming in.<br/>
<br/>
No question I was pregnant, though.<br/>

With a midwife friend of mine, yes.  <br/>
We waited until the windows for the fetal protein and this&#39;n&#39;that had passed <br/>
for me to declare myself to the HMO.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had been a hospital long labor and 10 cm and pushing and cesarean.<br/>
Marty was a homebirth long(er) labor and 10 cm and (more) pushing and same <br/>
old cesarean.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t interested in going for three of those.<br/>

&quot;Were you ever in twice in labor for 24 hours and got to 10 and didn&#39;t have a <br/>

&quot;No&quot; <br/>

&quot;Well then you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;<br/>

If someone&#39;s baby came out after two hours or eight hours or even 24 hours, <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m back!  I&#39;ve been in England and Indiana and going through <br/>
remodel, ugh.  <br/>
<br/>
I was having a homebirth with Tamzin, was in labour for 16 <br/>
hours, had gone into 2nd stage and the midwives realized that <br/>
Tamzin was in posterier position.  I couldn&#39;t push her out, so an <br/>
ambulance came and took me to the hospital where they gave <br/>
me an epidural (in case I had to have an emergency C-section) <br/>
and tried to turn her around using the vacuum thingy.  I was in <br/>
2nd stage for 5 hours and was so torn up when they finally got <br/>
her turned and out that they had to do some pretty extensive <br/>
repair work on me.  In hindsight, I wish that they had done a <br/>
C-section on me!  I was so out of it by then that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
advocate for myself and Chris didn&#39;t have the knowledge or <br/>
gumption to step in and advocate for me.  I never thought I&#39;d ever <br/>
want a C-section over vaginal birth, but in certain circumstances <br/>
it&#39;s definitely a good option to have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25263752">I had my first two with midwives at a birth center...went great.  Second <br/>
two at home with midwife...went great.  My midwife who helped with the <br/>
home births has unschooled with her kids for over 20 years.  Now she&#39;s a <br/>
good friend.  Prenatal visits were really just fun discussions about <br/>
birth and unschooling.  I&#39;m lucky though, I had really easy deliveries. <br/>
 Having been with sister and sil through hospital births, I&#39;d choose <br/>
home every time if it&#39;s an option.  With my sister, I was there as her <br/>
coach for the whole thing and look just like my sister, but in the room <br/>
after the nurse wouldn&#39;t let me hold the baby because they had <br/>
regulations about strangers.  I guess she thought I was going to take <br/>
off with the baby.  I myself was 7 mnths pregnant at the time.  I was so <br/>
angry, smoke was just about coming out of my ears, not to mention I <br/>
hadn&#39;t slept in 36 hours.  Then they made her sit through a 45 minute <br/>
lecture on breastfeeding and infant care even though it was her second <br/>
baby and she&#39;d breastfed her first.  She and I yawned all the way <br/>
through it.  But they HAD to do it, you know...hospital regulations and <br/>
all.    Ugh!   HeidiC.<br/>

<br/>
Been there, done that.... The first two I was in labor 24 and 30 hours and<br/>
ended up with c-sections. They suck because you are worn out and exhausted<br/>
before you have major surgery. The third though I had as a VBAC as I was<br/>
very determined that my body could work thru it despite the medical staff!<br/>
I did have an epidural and that was wonderful. <br/>
THe 4th though I ended up with a section again because my water broke and<br/>
24 hours later no contractions. The hospital here won&#39;t give you any<br/>
pitocin to bring on contractions if you&#39;ve had a previous section so we had<br/>
no choice.<br/>
<br/>
I healed wonderfully with the VBAC but ALSO with the last section. I<br/>
checked myself out of the hospital after 2 days and even gave a solstice<br/>
party for 15 people 5 days after he was born! I think having the section<br/>
with no drain of labor before it made a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
As others have said the big thing is a healthy baby and healthy mom. I<br/>
believe part of the healthy mom aspect comes from making informed choices<br/>
about the delivery. If that has to include surgery and you have looked at<br/>
all the aspects surrounding it then so be it. <br/>
<br/>
I just think it&#39;s frustrating when women opt to have surgery for<br/>
convenience or because they just don&#39;t have a clue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, That&#39;s what I though too. My first sign of labor was that my water <br/>
broke. Forty-five hours later, he was FINALLY born. Nothing to eat. Nothing <br/>
to drink. NO sleep. I was exhausted. <br/>
<br/>
At 23 hours, I figured that I could do it---they&#39;d take him in another hour <br/>
or so. No such luck. I never felt the urge to push. And even if I had, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t. By the end I was so tired, I just wanted to die. It would be <br/>
better. <br/>
<br/>
It was a military hospital in Germany. I wasn&#39;t allowed pain-killers or an <br/>
epidural either. There were several women there with no husbands. Ben coached <br/>
three OTHER women through the final stages because, well--he was available! <br/>
By the time he got to me, he was a pro! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I finally ripped open and he was born. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a reason there are eight years between my boys! Dunc was a C-section <br/>
after 15 horrible hours when I thought it would actually kill me.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t built to produce children!<br/>

heads or bigger babies are really not the problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This happened with my last dd.  Her shoulder was stuck and the Dr. <br/>
yelled &quot;SHOULDER DYSTOCIA&quot; to the nurse,and she(the nurse) proceeded <br/>
to push with her fist on the top of my stomach as hard as she could <br/>
while the Dr. pulled on my dd&#39;s head.  She flew out!  I was in a <br/>
state of not being able to speak, but wanted to scream at them to <br/>
settle down!<br/>
I know if I had had a midwife it would have been a gentle turning,or <br/>
atleast explained to me before reacting like that.  MY dd&#39;s heart <br/>
rate was fine and there really was no hurry.  I was furious after.<br/>
I got even more furious when a few weeks later I noticed a bump on <br/>
dd&#39;s collar bone and later discovered it was broken!<br/>
