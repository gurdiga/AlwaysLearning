<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092128405">I have cross-posted this to my fav. groups because i value you all and<br/>
the more tools i get the better.<br/>
We have a neighbor who is nice to us but throws out comments to Lukas<br/>
and whenever i say something the guy talks over me or ignores me.<br/>
Like, the other day we were walking down the road while the guy was<br/>
parking and we met up at his truck when he was getting out of it and<br/>
i thought he would just say hi but he said to Lukas: who&#39;s this little<br/>
girl? AHAA..so friggin funny,really! I&#39;m thinking what kind of adult<br/>
makes fun of little kids? He&#39;s always pushing Lukas to talk to him,<br/>
saying:he&#39;ll get used to me as he ages. I&#39;m thinking yeah,keep teasing<br/>
him and he&#39;ll really like you!<br/>
Another time Lukas fell and was crying loud. when he felt good<br/>
enough to walk home the jerk heard it all and came walking up to us<br/>
making a crying sound saying: wahhh, i got a boo boo!<br/>
Like, i said this guy doesn&#39;t hear me defend Lukas or care and soon<br/>
i will say SHUT the F**K up!! to him. We don&#39;t/can&#39;t walk the other<br/>
way because there&#39;s a main road down there, Lukas likes to play in the<br/>
ditches,other neighbors swing and so on. Is the only way to be clear<br/>
with this guy is to rude back?<br/>
 My husband will not have a talk with him. His reasoning is the jerk<br/>
will tell the other guy,other guy will tell other neighbor and dh says<br/>
we&#39;ll be thought of like A**holes. My dh says to walk the other way or<br/>
if i decide to go the same way, I&#39;m putting myself/Lukas out there for<br/>
whatever and just ignore the guy. It did bother Lukas when the guy<br/>
commented about his long hair. Am i too sensitive?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622507338">I think lots of times guys like these are trying in their twisted <br/>
ways to be, you know ,friendly. I think you should go over and have a <br/>
talk with him yourself. Or maybe bake him some cookies and write him <br/>
a note telling him the teasing is not something that your family uses <br/>
and you find it very hurtful. Let him know that YOU would prefer if <br/>
it stopped now.<br/>
<br/>
If it continues tell him to shut the F### Up... But my guy feeling is <br/>
he is a good old boy trying to be friendly and he means no harm. <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I forget how old Lukas is, and I don&#39;t know what you should do, but I <br/>
do know what I would do.  For me, being rude back would just not <br/>
work, because that&#39;s not who I am, and that&#39;s not who I want to be; I <br/>
couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t want to pull that off.<br/>
<br/>
What I would do is point out to my son that sometimes folks will put <br/>
other people down to build themselves up.  Folks who need to do that <br/>
generally don&#39;t feel too good about themselves, and that&#39;s why they <br/>
do it.  That&#39;s pretty sad.  I would help my son see that it&#39;s not <br/>
about long hair or anything that is wrong with my son but it&#39;s *that* <br/>
guy&#39;s messed up view of himself that is probably the root of his rudeness.<br/>
<br/>
While honoring and helping my son deal with his hurt feelings, I <br/>
would also be transparent for my son about my holding compassion and <br/>
forgiveness in my heart for this jerk.  (What I wouldn&#39;t do is tell <br/>
my son that he should do that, too, unless he asked me specifically <br/>
what I thought he should do, and even then, I would help him figure <br/>
out his own way, which never, ever has to be my way.)<br/>
<br/>
It would be interesting, too, almost like an experiment, to see if <br/>
this unspoken compassion I felt in my heart had any effect on that <br/>
guy, too.  It would be interesting to see if he stopped showing up in <br/>
our lives or just ignored us as we walked by.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, my husband, Jimmy, actually had that experience with <br/>
someone.  There was a guy who ran the local recycling center, and he <br/>
was *always* busting Jimmy&#39;s chops and my son&#39;s chops, too.  It was <br/>
annoying and confounding.  Eventually, Jimmy changed the way he was <br/>
feeling in his heart, and I swear that guy never even noticed Jimmy <br/>
and Liam after that.  The change in this guy was abrupt!  It was <br/>
quite weird and very cool!!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;d do.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
We had a similar situation in our neighborhood.  The man kept <br/>
threatening the kids in the area, whenever the parents weren&#39;t around.  <br/>
I called the police after one particular incident of him threatening my <br/>
child and her friends, when they weren&#39;t doing anything except sitting <br/>
on the curb in the cul-de-sac, not in front of his house.<br/>
<br/>
He never went near any of the kids again and finally moved out of the <br/>
neighborhood, hopefully to one without any children!<br/>
<br/>
Of course that may be too drastic in this situation, but maybe not.  He <br/>
sounds like a mean person, and your husband is right, stay away from <br/>
him and avoid him at all cost.</div>

experienced a similar situation where, the best recourse was calling <br/>
the police because of this particular individual.  I was projecting <br/>
that onto the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people are just rough around the edges and sometimes they are <br/>
bad people.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to know the difference.  It&#39;s a gut <br/>
instinct for sure.  I was following the gut instinct of my child and my <br/>
own at the time and both of us had that yuck yuck bad guy alert feeling.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   To me it sounds like this guy is jealous. Or he&#39;s perhaps repeating<br/>
only what he was told when he was younger. Obviously I can&#39;t know the<br/>
whole situation. My son loved long hair when he was younger so I had a<br/>
talk with him about how sometimes he would probably be mistaken for a<br/>
girl and ways he could deal with it and people if they did tease him.<br/>
He was honestly mistaken for a girl many times and with people he<br/>
wanted to know he would tell them something like: I&#39;m a boy but I like<br/>
my hair long and if it was an old lady in a grocery store he usually<br/>
just smiled at her because he realized it didn&#39;t really matter. It&#39;s<br/>
weird how he can just let other people&#39;s offhand statements roll over<br/>
him with no ill affect and I yet sometimes stew in them... <br/>
    <br/>
    The guy saying &quot;wahh I got a boo boo&quot; does so sound like jealously<br/>
IMO from what you said. He perhaps wanted you to kiss it and make it<br/>
all better for him? I wouldn&#39;t be rude to him but if it continued I<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t ignore him either, probably ask him why he said what<br/>
he did. He probably does think in his own weird way he is being<br/>
friendly and might not understand he&#39;s offending you. Some people<br/>
don&#39;t realize there is more than one way to parent just like some<br/>
don&#39;t realize there is more than one way to school.<br/>

in the 19th century that turned into &quot;sociopathic personality&quot; and  <br/>
then &quot;anti-social tendencies (variously termed), but when Charles  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-287343360">We just read a book today called The Grump  written by Mark Ludy.  It would be a good book to read to your son.  It is about a grumpy man that everyone is scared of, so they avoid him, but one little girl was nice to him and it took a while and he became nice.  It was a good kids book.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once told me that if you don&#39;t like someone you should get to know them better.  Usually you will understand them more and see why they are the way they are, then you can be more compasionate to them.  Maybe he was a long haired child who got teased...you never know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166641697">Hi,<br/>
     I&#39;ve been reading these posts about the frustrating neighbor in utter fascination...everyone has offered such different (and I believe, equally valid) suggestions!  People are so interesting in how we all come from such different perspectives - and the people on this list impress me with their consciousness and thoughtfulness.  <br/>
     I was telling my husband about this this morning and he was loving hearing about all the different ideas for how to deal with this guy.  I thought I would throw out what he said, just to add to the mix.  He said that he would go to the guy and tell him that this could be handled in one of three ways...1) he stops bullying his son completely, 2) my husband goes to all the neighbors and lets them know all about the embarassingly immature behavior that this man has been perpetrating on his son or 3) he beats his ass.  I&#39;m not saying what I think of all this, I just thought it was so fun to see what he came up with...and keep in mind that this comes from a very kind and peace-loving daddy.  :)  I think that I personally would just go ahead and speak up to the guy when it happened, explaining to him how hurtful his behavior is and letting him know that we expect it to end.  Anyway, the bottom line here is that to the mom and boy who are going through this, we are so sorry<br/>
 that you&#39;re dealing with this!  You have the moral support of a family in Indiana!  Do what ever feels RIGHT to you in protecting and supporting your son.  <br/>
  Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875087288">Something remarkable happened today. We did go for our walk and the<br/>
guy did come over to us, said hi to Lukas and out of the blue said:<br/>
Lukas, I know your a boy! Then he said maybe we can go fishing<br/>
together when your older. Him and I had a conversation about our<br/>
houses and he was very nice. Side note: ALthough he is nice, we really<br/>
don&#39;t know anything about him except he is rebuilding his house and he<br/>
goes out west to CA for a few months. I would not let my son go with a<br/>
stranger anywhere. He is trying in his own way to be friendly. When we<br/>
were walking i was thinking maybe he tried to have long hair when he<br/>
was young and couldn&#39;t or was teased.--- In<br/>

Oh gosh, I&#39;m so disallusioned these days.  It seems everyone has normal <br/>
neighbors.  I seem to get all the weirdos, so much so, that it feels <br/>
like that must be all that exists anymore!  I can deal with grumpy old <br/>
men that are all crusty in their polite dealings with people.  I always <br/>
get the biker gangs, and oddly weird, rude, and/or crazy people in my <br/>
neck of the woods.<br/>

Oh my gosh, that is one of our favorite things to do: make up funny lyrics  <br/>
to someone else&#39;s songs/music!! We all have a blast (well, the 3 year old <br/>
hasn&#39;t  quite put in his 2 cents worth, yet) doing that and sometimes we&#39;re even <br/>
lucky  enough to remember them. I often think (after I&#39;ve forgotten them, of <br/>
course)  that I should write them down, but we&#39;re having so much fun in the <br/>
moment, I  never think of it then... <br/>

<br/>
We have tacky-rude law-breaking neighbors behind us.  I had a  <br/>
discussion with the dad on public property (a vacant lot near both  <br/>
our houses where he won the insulting half, but I won the &quot;make you  <br/>
afraid not to change&quot; half.  I&#39;ve yelled over the back fence &quot;BE NICE  <br/>
TO THEM!!!&quot; when the grandmother was ragging and raging to the  <br/>
toddlers, and I&#39;ve yelled &quot;BE QUIET&quot; when they were just ragging and  <br/>
raging at each other.  And y&#39;know what?  They do get quieter and  <br/>
nicer.  The police are there lots, and I&#39;ve only called them once,  <br/>
when a teenaged girl was screaming and crying for someone not to hit  <br/>
her.  They&#39;ve looked for the dad with a helicopter.  The county made  <br/>
them move out until the house was repaired.  I was very disappointed  <br/>
that they just didn&#39;t sell it and stay gone.  There&#39;s a bit inground  <br/>
pool there they used the first year and now is empty and disintegrating.<br/>
<br/>
We suspect they stole the stereo from our van, but they left a  <br/>
screwdriver which we still have, and we also have a better stereo now.<br/>
<br/>
Our neighbors to another side are also tacky and rude, but we try to  <br/>
ignore them.  Our most beautiful little side yard is now the property  <br/>
of their barking German Shepherd.  It&#39;s not fun for us to work over  <br/>
there, even.  And we could befriend or bribe the dog, but his barking  <br/>
is always followed closely by one of them yelling at her to &#39;shut up,  <br/>
god damn it.&#39;  I&#39;m glad we&#39;re not having to watch them raise kids.   <br/>
They won&#39;t even let their dog be a natural dog.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But this is way, way more important than that:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t dwell in those thoughts.  I offered them to discuss the idea  <br/>
that others seem to have no ratty neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
This is important:  If you focus on flaws, your life will be very  <br/>
flawed.  If you focus on beauty and joy, your life will be joyful.    <br/>
You can control the neighbors, but you can learn to control your  <br/>
thoughts and your choices.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I seem to be having a hard time with that part of life lately.  Perhaps <br/>
its the end of winter stuff, maybe other life stuff.  I don&#39;t know, but <br/>
I usually am very much a bright side of life person, and I just feel <br/>
disallusioned lately.<br/>
<br/>
You are absolutely right though about what you choose to focus on.  I <br/>
remember how Anne Ohman used to say that your kids should shine in your <br/>
eyes.  That is much like focusing on the good things in life.  Focusing <br/>
on the beauty and joy of what my kids are doing rather than what they <br/>
are doing that I might not like so much.<br/>
<br/>
It really is crucial to unschooling working its best.  The more I focus <br/>
on the really awesome stuff that my kids do, the more awesome stuff <br/>
they do.  I don&#39;t think they can help it, they want to feel that <br/>
awesomeness, it is something that self perpetuates, just like the <br/>
negative stuff does. <br/>
<br/>
This is really the first time in my unschooling journey that I&#39;ve <br/>
struggled with this.  I haven&#39;t posted much in a long while because of <br/>
it.  I felt I should just read and not post, so as to not spill any of <br/>
that disallusionment out.  I try to keep that from reaching my kids, <br/>
but I&#39;m sure they can feel it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been making lists of everything wonderful about life and things my <br/>
kids are doing.  I don&#39;t write them down, just a mental list that I can <br/>
keep running throughout my day to keep it going through my thoughts and <br/>
hopefully into my actions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m optomistic about things getting back to the happy flow that got <br/>
interrupted by life.  I guess this is where I make lemonaide, only I&#39;m <br/>
going to make some shirley temples instead because they are better and <br/>
my kids like marachino cherries.</div>
