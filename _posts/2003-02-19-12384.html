<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499813024">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I too find most &quot;kid&quot; movies to have an underlying sexual theme. My thought is that the movies are written for the adults enjoyment and since a movie can not possibly be good without good sexual scenes, then these kid movies need alittle too. Disney has a history of adult humor running through their movies. Maybe the other writers find it necessary too. <br/>
<br/>
I see some kids at 8 know alot about adult life, maybe family members teasing/etc. about the future where other families keep things more kid appropriate. The kids at school do start talking about crushes right at 8/ third grade, I know that now since my 8 year old is trying a year at school. My kids had no real clue until they befriended neighbors who talk alot about dating/ boy-girl relationships and the future. This mom wants to start talking about these things early, so now I&#39;m answering questions when they come up for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is school, maybe family values. Our society sure glamorizes sexual encounters. Do you ever watch commercial TV? Skin , red lips, body parts...the kids see stuff everywhere, which is kinda sad I think, cuz life is so rich in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
A ramble,<br/>
