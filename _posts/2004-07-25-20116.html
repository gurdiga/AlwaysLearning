I want to be able to clean much faster, maybe magically like Mary Poppins and <br/>
Mrs. Weasley. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

That&#39;s the thing that always irritated me about Bewitched. You&#39;ve got this <br/>
hot wife who can handle all the drudgery of life by twitching her nose in a VERY <br/>
cute way. Why not handle the boring things that way so you have more time to <br/>
enjoy the hot wife?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Because at that time in TVLand, a peck on the cheek was all the enjoyment <br/>
a guy could have with his hot wife.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So she SHOULD spend all day cooking (badly) and cleaning the house?<br/>
<br/>
I think it was just part of the post-wwII push to get women happily into <br/>
suburbia, leaving jobs open for the returning GIs.  That propaganda movement went <br/>
on through the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.<br/>

Oh you said it!! It infuriates me that Darren wants Samantha to deny and<br/>
renounce that which is the very foundation of her personhood, her greatest<br/>
talent for the sake of trivia. Then to top it off he tries his darnedest to<br/>
suppress it in Tabitha, incidentally expecting her to deny half of her<br/>
heritage. And Samantha colludes with him in that latter horror. I&#39;m with<br/>
Endora - Derwood is an ass.<br/>
