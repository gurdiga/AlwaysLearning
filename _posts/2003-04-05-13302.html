conversation in the locker room of their health club. A woman who overheard<br/>
them came out and asked the adult who that kid was, she was SO articulate<br/>
and smart. My friend said that the girl was homeschooled. The woman replied,<br/>
&quot;I used to be against homeschooling, but after hearing that, I&#39;ve changed my<br/>
mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And believe me, it was just an ordinary, everyday conversation they were<br/>
having, not rocket science or advanced mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
Changing people&#39;s minds even when we don&#39;t know it!<br/>

&lt;&lt;. . . so convinced that <br/>
homeschooling is horrible and Julian couldn&#39;t be learning anything, she <br/>
communicates to him that she doesn&#39;t value anything that Julian is doing. I <br/>
just keep wondering...has she ever TALKED to this kid???? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yesterday I was interviewed by someone doing an article for a women&#39;s <br/>
supplement of the local paper.  Alternative education.   It turned into her <br/>
feeling guilty about her own kids, and then a counselling session.  That&#39;s <br/>
okay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But somewhere in there I told her that anymore if people question me about <br/>
whether my kids could possibly know anything, or how do *I* know if they know <br/>
anything, since I don&#39;t have them tested, I just say &quot;Take one of them to <br/>
lunch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty didn&#39;t come out while she was here, and Kirby was off at driver&#39;s ed <br/>
(driving with the teacher) and then work, but Holly came and sat with us.  I <br/>
had set out tea, bread, cookies, little matching knives and saucers. &lt;g&gt;  So <br/>
I set a place for Holly too, and when Holly got bored and left, the <br/>
interviewer had big eyes and said Holly was a really (can&#39;t remember the <br/>
word) kid.  She was surprised at how calm and knowledgeable she was.  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t surprised that she was surprised.<br/>
<br/>
So many people look at age and grade and scores and calendar and their vague <br/>
recollections of what they had to know at that age, and never even THINK of <br/>
looking at the human being.<br/>

<br/>
When I read that I took in an audible loud vocalized breath.  I&#39;m going to <br/>
wake someone up. (Actually they&#39;re all up now; I&#39;m the one who slept late <br/>
today.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry to hear that any mother has said or thought that about her <br/>
children and I hope they survived well and aren&#39;t thinking in the same terms <br/>
about her.  <br/>
<br/>
I LOVE my kids.  I try not to tell them they&#39;re smart.  I truly avoid that.  <br/>
I will say &quot;That&#39;s very cool,&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s a smart idea,&quot; but I try not to <br/>
label them themselves in general as anything.  Not even smart.  Certainly not <br/>
dumb.  Yikes yikes yikes...<br/>

f***ed, once and then again; that she, the father(s) in question, and the<br/>
act was dumb.  The children, while certainly demeaned by the names, are not<br/>
being labeled dumb themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, of course.<br/>
