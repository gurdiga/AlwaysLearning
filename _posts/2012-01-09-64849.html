<br/>
Marty and Kirby both did something very sweet today. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Holly&#39;s first day at the community college, and Marty, who has an afternoon class, told me he would go early and see if he could find Holly (he knows where her classes are and where she intended to sit to eat the lunch she was taking) and see how it&#39;s going.  Before he left he asked me if she had seemed nervous before she left.  I said no, didn&#39;t seem so.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had posted a link to a video on Facebook, and wrote that he thought I would like it especially.  <br/>
I wrote two things, one before and one after I watched it:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd: I will listen to it in a while. Thank you for thinking of me.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd: that&#39;s really beautiful and clever.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s all-suave response was:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mom, beautiful and clever things generally remind me of you. ;)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s husband, Carl, was here last week and Holly was trying but failing to find a time that she and Marty could go together to the college to buy books and get parking stickers, and Holly needed a student ID.  Marty was variously busy, and when he wasn&#39;t Holly was. <br/>
<br/>
Carl offered to go with her.  That was VERY SWEET! <br/>
And as it turned out, Marty showed up, finished with whatever he had been doing, just before they left, so Marty went, too.  <br/>
<br/>
It was interesting for Carl because he teaches at a community college, and it was more fun for Holly, and everything was made easy.  That&#39;s why Marty knows where Holly&#39;s classes are, because they had all gone together to make sure she would know where the rooms were.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s math &quot;book&quot; is a set of photocopies.  Carl had opened it and looked at it, and said it had something about the population of Madrid, New Mexico (a little former ghost town that had come up repeatedly over several days).<br/>
<br/>
Today Marty asked me whether I had looked at her math book, and I said I hadn&#39;t.  He seemed a big perturbed about it, and I asked him whether it didn&#39;t seem good, or too easy, or something.  I forget what I asked. He said one thing he saw was asking them to write out in words, in English, what the population of Santa Fe was.  It showed &quot;Santa Fe: &quot; and some number (probably from this:  &quot;Santa Fe(literally &#39;holy faith&#39; in Spanish) had a population of 67947 in the 2010 census&quot;), and they were to write the number out, like sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred and forty-seven--just to show they understood how to read numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I said I thought some people were so disturbed by math classes that they froze up when they saw a big number.  He said, &quot;Yeah, but Holly&#39;s not one of them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We agreed, though, that she would probably have fun in the class anyway. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Holly called me.  Marty hadn&#39;t found her.  So at least he intended to, but she was in the computer lab, not having her password, being frustrated, having been sold the wrong book (not the math book, but for a reading/critical thought class).  I was the bookstore&#39;s fault, but she likes the book and intends to keep it anyway.  The right book is $90 and I asked if she could use her card and I would pay her back and she said the teacher says she should drop the class anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why?&quot; I asked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh...&quot; she started, kind of flustered, &quot;I can tell you lots of stories when I get home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I went from peace and love to all-flustered Holly, but I think it will be okay.  Still, Marty was sweet to think of her.<br/>

How incredibly sweet.  And the best thing about it is that because of who he is and how he was raised you know he means it.  There&#39;s no manipulation there.  He&#39;s just saying something sweet like you probably did countless times while he was growing up.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 8, and he says sweet things to me all the time.  He&#39;s going to someday be the best boyfriend ever to some lucky girl.  And he&#39;s going to be an amazing father if he has kids.  I love who he is right now and I am already in love with who he is going to be.  Unschooling has given me that gift.</div>
