<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326099552">Hi all -- I am Alicia in Stafford, VA unschooling my two boys ages 10<br/>
and 14.  I have been on this list for some time, but when my email<br/>
volume was too high I switched to no mail and then forgot all about<br/>
it. I&#39;ve been on some other unschooling lists which all of which seem<br/>
to have recently disintergrated -- veering from pure unschooling to<br/>
accomodate various visions of homeschooling in general.  As a result,<br/>
I stopped reading those lists and just backed away from most hs<br/>
discussion groups.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, I&#39;ve been craving a nice big meal of pure unschooling -- so<br/>
I&#39;m back.  Helloooo!<br/>

Depending how much time & patience you have and how old your children  <br/>
are, it might be worth considering joining the Radical Unschoolers&#39;  <br/>
Network and one of  you creating a U.K. group there!    It&#39;s very new  <br/>
and I&#39;m still learning my way around, but it&#39;s interesting to visit  <br/>
even if you don&#39;t choose to live there. &lt;bwg&gt;   And others could find  <br/>
you.<br/>

You could go to my page to poke around, and you can join from there  <br/>
(I think).  Or maybe it  will just take you to a sign-in screen.  I&#39;m  <br/>
not sure which.<br/>

<br/>
We live in Norfolk, about 15 miles south of Norwich. <br/>
<br/>
My experience is that unschooling is a slightly different kettle of fish in the UK than it is in the US. Or maybe they are just the same but I&#39;ve managed to immerse myself in the more radical end of the US unschoolers than I&#39;ve done in the UK. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923866202">Hi Michelle,<br/>
There&#39;s an autonomous list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aeuk/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/aeuk/</a> but<br/>
it has quite a wide spectrum of autonomy, and there are a few of us<br/>
who post on the &#39;vanilla&#39; EO list. I don&#39;t think there are a huge<br/>
number of us. Or perhaps its just that other unschoolers are to busy<br/>
*doing* it to post about it? Hmm, not sure what that says about me, lol!<br/>
I&#39;m in Lancashire. Where are you?<br/>
