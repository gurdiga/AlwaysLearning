<div id="ygrps-yiv-148053088">OK . <br/>
I have tried to keep quiet and not bug him,. He is 13 and knows what he wants and needs, but tonight in 37 degree weather, when everyone else ( crowds of people)  was wearing a jacket, a sweatshirt,or a long sleeve shirt layered , he was just wearing a thin, black, short sleeve t-shirt. And after the event he is going somehere else and won&#39;t be home until after midnight.<br/>
<br/>
He brought his sweatshirt to the car when we left but when we got there, he just got out and shut the door and I thought he forgot it. I put down the window to remind him and he just have me a look.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe he was not cold, it&#39;s freezing out. you should have seen what he wore at home when he went to feed the animals.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to make a big deal out of it but my insides go crazy. He looks absolutely ridiculous and no doubt everyone else thinks so too.( the only people that wouldn&#39;t think anything would be unschoolers and there aren&#39;t many around &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just want input or a good slap to say leave him alone ! &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.. <br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know WHY I just can&#39;t let it go??? I know one thing, one of the worse things for me is to be cold, so I know that is probably part of it.<br/>

 <br/>
Perhaps you&#39;ve nagged him too much about it if he&#39;s giving you a &quot;look&quot;.  It&#39;s not a simple reminder if you are continuously telling him.  Otherwise it could be a &quot;no thanks&quot; on his part.<br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t believe he was not cold, it&#39;s freezing out.*** <br/>
 <br/>
Obviously, he felt different.  Why is that wrong?  Or maybe he doesn&#39;t like his jacket, maybe he&#39;d prefer one of a different style and doesn&#39;t want to wear one that he feels looks doofy on him and he&#39;d rather be cold than look doofy.  Chamille&#39;s done that sort of thing, more so when she was 13, than now at 15.<br/>
 <br/>
***I don&#39;t want to make a big deal out of it but my insides go crazy. He looks absolutely ridiculous and no doubt everyone else thinks so too***<br/>
 <br/>
That is way too much emotional investment in whether or not a kid wears a jacket.  He&#39;s 13, let it go.  If he wants to wear a jacket, he&#39;ll wear one, if he&#39;s forgetful, make sure to bring one for him or give him a real simple reminder and then back off and leave it alone.<br/>
 <br/>
*** I know one thing, one of the worse things for me is to be cold, so I know that is probably part of it.***<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah me too.  I hate being cold, but I remember being a kid and not really caring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593193333">At the same age our son did the opposite he wore a leather down coat into the summer months.  He said he liked the jacket - it was comfy and he liked the &quot;look&quot;.  He also had another lighter weight jacket that he wore all the time - said the same thing - he liked the look.  He also had a matching hat that he wore everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
He outgrew them eventually - the coats that is.  We tried to find him a new one but he never did find one he liked at the time.  He did find a new one about a month ago and wears it a lot but not as much.<br/>
<br/>
Oh he also found a trench coat at a thrift store about a month ago that he likes and is searching for a fedora to wear with it.  Though he did say he is a bit self-conscious when he wears it.<br/>
<br/>
Zac never has liked heavy coats - even as an infant - I think it was the restrictiveness of a heavy coat that he did not like - even though we are in MO and it can get into the minuses weather wise.  He also will not wear shorts in the hottest weather.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d guess your son might just like the look - or the coat is uncomfortable? Have you asked him why he chooses not to wear a coat?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904966627">I was at the frigid, windblown park the other day with three other moms. Two <br/>
of us, all bundled up in coats, sweaters and beanies were still chilly. One <br/>
was wearing long sleeves and a skirt and was embracing the wind but starting <br/>
to feel cold. I think she eventually put on a thin cardigan. The last was <br/>
wearing a short sleeved t-shirt and finally started to feel a bit cold after <br/>
about 30 minutes while we two cold feelers had chattering teeth. The other <br/>
two ladies have both described themselves as &quot;running hotter than normal&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
People do. Perhaps your son does too.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He looks absolutely ridiculous and no doubt everyone else thinks so <br/>
too&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You really have &quot;no doubt&quot; that &quot;everyone&quot; thinks he looks &quot;absolutely <br/>
ridiculous&quot;. Everybody in a big crowd at some exciting event, that <br/>
presumeably includes his friends, are so busy examining and judging the <br/>
apparel of one 13 year old boy.<br/>
<br/>
Consider yourself slapped.<br/>
<br/>
I started not hassling Jayn  about her clothing from the day she was born. <br/>
When she was an infant I needed to use close observation to see if she <br/>
seemed too warm or too cold. I learnt that she cried if she got cold at all, <br/>
and her feet were a good indicator.<br/>
<br/>
Later I could trust her to answer honestly with words or gestures if she <br/>
didn&#39;t need her jacket, but I always brought one along to have on hand. I <br/>
carried shoes, sweaters, hats visibly to deter strangers&#39; judgments. I <br/>
didn&#39;t argue when she wanted to wear several layers on  a hot day, beyond <br/>
saying &quot;it&#39;s hot out today&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do to restore the trust between you. But I think you do <br/>
have to begin with yourself and truly coming to peace in your heart with his <br/>
clothing choices. If between the pair of you, there is some kind of power <br/>
playing (which might be indicated by &quot;the look&quot;), it only takes one of you <br/>
to change the dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
For example,  if he is using his clothing choices to challenge you, if you <br/>
choose not to rise to his challenge, you free both of you from this <br/>
unpleasant game. Eventually he will feel free to choose his clothes based on <br/>
his own comfort and taste, and not have any kind of emotional overlay that <br/>
makes your advice or suggestions abhorrent to him.<br/>
<br/>
If he feels controlled or believes that you are being too pushy, you can <br/>
start to change that by being acceptant in your heart - that will spill out <br/>
to your attitude and demeanor.<br/>
<br/>
How to become acceptant? I like to take a deep breath or two and think to <br/>
myself &quot;All is well.&quot; I also notice where the tension is within my body - <br/>
really notice and take a moment to feel that coiled spring in my stomach. It <br/>
helps me to see that these feelings that I want to deny are nothing more <br/>
than my own desire to control are all my own doing and my own <br/>
responsibility - and much less to do with the choices that anyone else, such <br/>
as my dd and my dh, are making.<br/>
<br/>
Another self-change strategy is to actively notice, even comment on <br/>
something wonderful and positive about your child in that stressful moment. <br/>
Instead of noticing his thin t-shirt, remind your self how tall he has <br/>
grown, how confident he is, how handsome.<br/>
<br/>
I started with my infant, but even 13 is not too late to start supporting <br/>
his choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048830962">Simon and Linnaea can tolerate cold at levels that I can&#39;t. I often just bring jackets for them that I carry wherever we go and that they can opt to wear at any point. Sometimes I carry them the whole time, even while I&#39;m bundled up in my own coat with gloves on and a hat. They use energy in a different way to me. They move more, they don&#39;t necessarily notice being cold. It hasn&#39;t hurt them. They don&#39;t have leprosy, they don&#39;t have a lack of sensation in their fingers and toes that make it vital for them to dress appropriately to offset the risks of the weather. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d grab his jacket and just carry it, shove it in a backpack and if he got cold, offer it. Otherwise, let it be. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121405612">The *look* I got from him basically said, I know what I am doing, don&#39;t mention it again, leave me alone! which in hindsight means that  *I* have obviously been dwelling on the jacket thing way too much.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, that is the only thing I have been bugging him about, and I finally realized I needed to bring it to the list to get a grasp on myself. Deep down I knew I should let it go, but for some reason I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I never gave it a thought that he might want *cooler* clothing to wear. He hasn&#39;t mentioned any clothing that he wants, but perhaps that IS how he feels. And we can do that...or he can do that.<br/>
<br/>
And of course noone is dwelling on what he is or isn&#39;t wearing. ( noone except me , that is). And thanks Robyn I think I really needed that slap<br/>
<br/>
 I also loved what Robyn said:<br/>

<br/>
Ths really touched me and you are sooo right. He is such a handsome, wonderful child, a friend, a loving being who is making his way in this world, and instead of embracing his whole self, I have been making his life less than joyful by fussing over a jacket. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your insight, all of you, and your reality check. It&#39;s so great to able to get help when one needs it :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166433641">It was an absolutely gorgeous day here in Minnesota yesterday and we decided to go to a  State Park where there is a beach to play. It could be the last nice day &quot;warm&quot; for many, many months.<br/>
The kids played in the sand with their friends who joined us. They  had on bathing suits , shorts and t-shirts. They went into the water up to their butts. The sand was pretty cold. <br/>
I took severls change of clothles, a blanket and towels. They did not get cold at all!!!!!!!!!<br/>
It never made it to 70 degrees Farenheit!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
People were hiking in long pants and jackets around the park!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
Cold is relative.<br/>

Yes, and don&#39;t keep waiting for the teenaged boy to give in and wear  <br/>
what his mom tells him to wear.  That cements the power relationship  <br/>

My husband used to wear shorts and t-shirts about ten months of the  <br/>
year.  As he got older, it started being sweat pants and a flannel  <br/>
shirt as a jacket.  Those same days, I&#39;d be wearing lots of clothes  <br/>
and a coat and a hat.<br/>

If you treat your son more as you would another adult, that might help.<br/>
