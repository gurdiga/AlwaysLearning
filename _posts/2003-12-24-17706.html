<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909843296">This idea of if males of a particular age don&#39;t sign up for the draft, they <br/>
don&#39;t get a license - is this in a particular state, or nationwide?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve a 14 year old son and ever since he was born, I&#39;ve mourned the day <br/>
he&#39;d turn 18 and have to sign one of those papers or be &#39;noncompliant&#39; or <br/>
whatever they call it.  For all that he plays shoot-em-up games on computer <br/>
and target shoots with his pellet gun, he&#39;d never, ever, in a million <br/>
years, shoot something that&#39;s alive.  Mr. Compassion, he is.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have researched the options on refusing to register for the <br/>
draft, what are they?<br/>
I want him to be fully informed when it comes time for him to decide if <br/>
he&#39;ll register or not.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
