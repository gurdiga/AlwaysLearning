<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077118235">This was forwarded to me by a friend. It&#39;s for a school project (yuck), but <br/>
I thought some people might like to respond anyway.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are in Mrs. Lentz&#39;s Computer Class at Clara Bolen Elementary in Tawas <br/>
&gt;City, MI.  We are doing an experiment for the art and science fair to be <br/>
&gt;held in April at our school.  We are trying to see where our email can <br/>
&gt;travel in the space of one month.  We will keep track of how many emails we <br/>
&gt;get and from which cities, states and countries.  We are hoping that you <br/>
&gt;will be willing to help us in our project.  There are just 2 simple steps <br/>
&gt;that will allow us to track this email.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Please send an email containing your city, state, and country to<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cb3braves@...">cb3braves@...</a>.  You do not need to include your name.  Please only <br/>
&gt;respond one time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2.  Forward this letter to as many people as you possibly can.  We are <br/>
&gt;going to keep track of actual numbers of responses from individual cities, <br/>
&gt;so send it even to those that live in the same town.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have decided to only do the tracking for 1 month.  We have chosen the <br/>
&gt;month of March so that we can get the data ready for the fair in April.  If <br/>
&gt;you receive this email in April, please do not bother to respond, our <br/>
&gt;project will have already ended.  Thank you for your participation in our <br/>
&gt;experiment.<br/>
&gt;We can&#39;t wait to start receiving those emails!  We will post the results on <br/>
&gt;the Tawas Area School web site www.tawas.net if you are interested in <br/>
&gt;viewing them.<br/>
