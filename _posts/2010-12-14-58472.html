<div id="ygrps-yiv-145199034">My experience is that extended family are no different from most people.<br/>
Most people don&#39;t live unschooling. They have no idea what the motives for<br/>
unschooling are and don&#39;t really want to know. That has largely been my<br/>
experience of family support, especially my parents who might be more likely<br/>
to feel they have a stake in things and therefore exert influence to get our<br/>
family off unschooling. Extended family are much more hands-off. I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
call it cold but they&#39;re not as involved. Which is ok with me.<br/>
<br/>
When we visit, extended family are curious rather than all up into our<br/>
unschooling. The biggest mistake people make is to assume that my reasons<br/>
for unschooling have to do with education primarily. Oh gosh. They don&#39;t<br/>
have anything to do with education. They have to do with protecting and<br/>
extending as much freedom as we can to Karl (and ourselves). Freedom to<br/>
enjoy life. Freedom, joy, a larger world. It has way more to do with living<br/>
than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
That probably doesn&#39;t do much in terms of your thought processes about<br/>
moving. For me, unschooling would only be one consideration for or against<br/>
moving.<br/>

<br/>
 Yes. I think physical (as well as virtual) community that *does* have some idea <br/>
of what unschooling is and supports a parent&#39;s/caregiver&#39;s choices to unschool <br/>
is important. I am a community-type person, starting and joining communities; I <br/>
do well on my own, too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m seeking closeness with warm, more respectful/interested family (closeness in <br/>
proximity and relationships) in addition to not related community. I *think* I <br/>
would be able to find/start community where we would moving to, and the lack of <br/>
warmth and often passive aggressive interactions with the family that is nearby <br/>
is growing tiresome for my husband and me.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m naive, though; I <br/>
get that more involvement from family often means more interference. That is why <br/>
I am asking the question about experiences with extended family and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They have to do with protecting and extending as much freedom as we can to Karl <br/>
(and ourselves). Freedom to<br/>
enjoy life. Freedom, joy, a larger world. It has way more to do with living than <br/>
anything else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I absolutely agree with this as a primary reasons for unschooling *my* <br/>
children as well.  And, sadly, that need and desire to protect them extends to <br/>
family as well. I feel like my distant more &quot;warm&quot; family could understand and <br/>
or respect my family&#39;s values more so than the local extended family does. Does <br/>
that mean that extended families&#39; participation in our lives makes for more <br/>
successful unschooling? Maybe. Maybe not. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That probably doesn&#39;t do much in terms of your thought processes about<br/>
moving. For me, unschooling would only be one consideration for or against<br/>
moving.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I presented the situation, the moving dilemma, more as background info; I&#39;m not <br/>
so much interested in advice about whether or not I move. I&#39;m really interested <br/>
in what you did tell me, though, about *your* (and other&#39;s) experiences with <br/>

<br/>
One of the negatives of having &quot;cooler&quot; family live far away is that when they/you visit is that they/you tend to stay longer---AND in the others&#39; house. When they live a bit closer, you can keep visits short and easily meet at neutral spots.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I live in the same town as my mother, but at different ends. Our visits can last a few hours, and everyone then goes home. OR we can meet somewhere neutral---restaurant/playground. When we lived in Germany and St Louis, visits would involve airfare; and she would move in and S.T.A.Y. quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just another angle.<br/>

But having &quot;community&quot; can lead to more interference too.    Making friends is one thing; each friendship is individual and separate from other friendships.   <br/>

<br/>
It is possible (it is, in some cases, definitely true) that the distant relatives seem warm because they&#39;re distant.  Or because visits are rare, they withhold criticism.  Or maybe they don&#39;t see details and so don&#39;t comment.  I&#39;ve had near and distant relatives.  I&#39;ve heard stories of people moving to other states (even other countries) to get nearer people they expected to have be as warm as they were on infrequent visits, but when they were local, the warmth became everyday, distracted, busy behavior.  It wasn&#39;t meanness.  It was the difference between being on vacation and being at work, or between being a houseguest, and being back home with all the responsibilities and laundry and errands and floors.<br/>
<br/>
This might not apply at all in your instance, Lisa, but it&#39;s important to let these discussions move where they go.  Sometimes what people think their question is becomes overshadowed by other issues, which is natural and inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
Moving doesn&#39;t always change things.<br/>
Unschoolers (nor anyone with similar interests or beliefs) have no obligation to become community with other unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
I think finding friends is a great plan, but starting community isn&#39;t as great.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tend to shy away from participation in too much community because my kids are still rather young (9, 6, 3.5, 23 months) because being a part of a larger community often times leads to more obligations than I can handle. I tend to focus on friends rather than community. It is much easier to schedule get togethers with one or two people than it is to be obligated to a community type group. <br/>

When we made the move several years ago, we knew that we were going to homeschool but hadn&#39;t yet decided to unschool. I hadn&#39;t even really heard of unschooling at that point in time. I thought that moving closer to his family would be nice because his family seemed to be very community oriented. There were a lot of things about his family that I liked. They led me to believe that things would be one way when we got there but they were actually totally different. I never realized how critical my husband&#39;s parents were because we only saw them once a year. Being around them all the time made me realize that we had made a bad decision. We ended up moving back to where we had lived before the move. My family isn&#39;t perfect but at least they were a lot more open to homeschooling. Unschooling didn&#39;t even enter into the equation. My family can be critical at times but my girls really like them because they tend to be rather laid back and are at least more open to exploring new ideas. <br/>

When I try to be a part of communities that are based on a common belief (whether it be unschooling, religion, or anything else), I find that I get too narrow minded and forget to see that there is a much larger world beyond that. <br/>

<br/>
This is interesting. The thing about communities is that there are<br/>
expectations that come with them (which is what &quot;common belief&quot; is). We<br/>
started going to a Unitarian Universalist church last year or so. We have<br/>
all gotten sporadic about going at this point. At first I got into the<br/>
political/social justice idea, then I felt that it was much more and a<br/>
different involvement than I wanted for going to church or even just hanging<br/>
out with people. And I *like* their ideas very much. That&#39;s no problem. I&#39;m<br/>
just feel very hedged in by the singular mindset even of very likeminds, and<br/>
would prefer to branch out into other interests. Maybe that will come with<br/>
more time and familiarity.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things being into art and into unschooling have done for me is to<br/>
bring a greater appreciation for all kinds of thinking, thoughts, activities<br/>
and expressions than is usual to see within any community I&#39;ve ever been<br/>
part of. We still hang loosely with our beloved UU. I still keep in touch<br/>
with some of the people I met when I was more into art, and I&#39;ve met more<br/>
artists since then. We love to travel but it&#39;s just us. Brian is getting<br/>
more into music. Karl has friends and lots of cousins locally as well the<br/>
occasional visit with those who live far away, family (who we visit about<br/>
twice a year) and friends. For myself, I like the library.<br/>
<br/>
For me, all this does have a lot to do with the individual as well as to an<br/>
additional interest in diversity. I sometimes wonder how much of liking my<br/>
own company and doing things by myself has to do with childhood<br/>
conditioning. Probably more than I&#39;d like to admit to even. Bringing that<br/>
thought back around to unschooling, it&#39;s something I have noticed in myself<br/>
that I don&#39;t like about relating with my child. Getting out of the<br/>
programmed rut of staying on my own thing so much would be better for me and<br/>
Karl.<br/>
<br/>
So I went off on a tangent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726109405">I saw this message come through while we were away (visiting extended family) on another tour of DC.  I&#39;ve been thinking about the OP&#39;s question(s) a lot since I first read them and find the way the conversation has moved interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
We moved from Alaska to the east coast to be closer to family.  My husband has a 14 year-old daughter who lives here, and being closer to her trumped the amazing community we&#39;d built for ourselves during the 10 yrs we lived up north. At the time, dh&#39;s mom lived in the UK (now she is split between DC and Vermont), and my dad, stepmom, brother, step-brothers, a few nieces and nephews and uncle are here too.<br/>
<br/>
For us, being close to extended family has absolutely added to our success with unschooling.  Our case is &quot;extreme&quot;: My husband, daughter and I now live with my dad and stepmom because we couldn&#39;t afford to live on one salary otherwise.  While I did work, having grandma available to watch our daughter made that possible.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my parents grew up in multi-family homes with their grandparents and in my mom&#39;s case, an aunt, uncle and their two kids as well (big old Brooklyn brownstones, though, where everyone had their own apartment).  For the last years of both my grandmothers&#39; lives, they lived with my parents (who by that time were divorced).  Growing up, I used to long for the kind of lives my mom and dad talked about--going downstairs to grandma&#39;s apartment for cookies and a story, going upstairs to see what aunt and uncle made for dinner when the home-fare wasn&#39;t desirable, always a safe place to retreat to when family life was overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be the whole story to say that the only way extended family help our unschooling is with financial support.  My daughter&#39;s life is so much richer for having more loving adults in her daily life.  She builds things with my dad, she reads with her grandmother. While she sometimes talks about missing our little apartment, she is very clear that right now, she wants to live with her grandparents forever.  It isn&#39;t always easy (for me and Michael) but the benefits far outweigh the draw-backs.<br/>
<br/>
Our situation isn&#39;t always possible, or the &quot;best&quot; choice, though.  A few years ago I was offered a great job at a small university not too far from my mother-in-law.  We were already committed to homeschooling, and decided my husband would be the stay-at-home parent if I took the job.  We found a house and were getting ready to sign a lease when we realized that living that close to my MIL wouldn&#39;t be a good thing for our family.  Her relationship with dh was never one built on honesty and respect.  It has, for the most part, been pretty toxic, actually, and we realized she wouldn&#39;t respect our boundaries--that she&#39;d be too much a part of our lives. <br/>
<br/>
There is more I could say about community vs. family, but I think it comes down to what your relationships with each really are.  What works for one family won&#39;t work for another.  One family may trust where another is skeptical, or worse (as we feared with my MIL), try to sabotage unschooling.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536542944">A lot of parens  forget that sometimes , even if they don&#39;t get along with <br/>
their parents and/or in-laws, their children may love those and miss them and <br/>
want to see them despite their ways.<br/>
I say that as a child that grew up absolutely loving my grandparents despite any <br/>
issues with their relatinship with my parents.<br/>
I see how my kids love their cousins  and grandparents. <br/>
I did resent my mom for complaining about her mother-in-law, my gandmother. I <br/>
wish she had not.<br/>
By the end of my granmother&#39;s life thy became best friends and they wasted <br/>
somuch time before!<br/>
<br/>
 I keep any issues that arrise with family between me and my husband. <br/>
Of course our extended family have their issues but they can also be great and <br/>
are good people.<br/>
They know we homeschool but we have never gone into details over what exactly we <br/>
do at all.<br/>
When my mother-in-law used to buy work books for our son when he turned <br/>
kindergarten age we thanked her.<br/>
It does make it easy that our son was reading extremely well early so I think <br/>
their worries went away. Plus I make sure to give then updates that they can <br/>
brag about to friends. All grandparents like that.<br/>

You might have seen a side of your grandmother you wouldn&#39;t have liked much,<br/>
and of your mom too.<br/>
<br/>
People have disagreements and while those disagreements are still on, they<br/>
may fight one another or sabotage each other&#39;s lives, etc. My aunt died last<br/>
week of a lingering illness. All the way up to the end, she had family<br/>
telling her she &quot;better get right with the Lord&quot; while her thinking was that<br/>
she was alright with God. At this point in her life, she had moved to be<br/>
closer with family. :( Turned out not to be the best idea. I&#39;m an adult and<br/>
I didn&#39;t really want to see any of that. I heard about it a lot and was<br/>
appalled at it on the occasion of a big surprise birthday party given for<br/>
her by her best friend to which all the family were invited.<br/>
<br/>
I love it when feuders decide to drop disagreements or see where other<br/>
people are coming from, and might be friends. But I don&#39;t thinking moving<br/>
guarantees this.<br/>

 <br/>
We did visit her almost every week. It was like the cold war. Not something they<br/>
 were open about it. It was a lot about my mother;s lack of selfsteem.<br/>
She needed to rebel since her own mother was one of those mothers who controlled <br/>
everything.<br/>
Even as a teenager my mother could not choose what to wear, how to wear her hair <br/>
and much more.<br/>
To this day my mother can react to stuff if she thinks someome is trying to <br/>
control her or tell her what to do.<br/>
We talk about her childhood and that helps her realize how so much of those <br/>
reactions come from all the controling she suffered when she was younger.<br/>
 <br/>
I am so glad I handle family a lot different then my mother did. I am also much <br/>
more confident about my choices and how we live our life and I do<br/>
not let things affect me. I also try to see the positive in everyone and their <br/>
good intentions. It helps to assume the best from people.<br/>
