<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127359394">&quot;I will take this day by and day and try to just &quot;shut up and <br/>
listen&quot;.  Shut up and listen to the pitter patter of running, the <br/>
laughter, the amazement in their eyes when they accomplish something <br/>
on their own, the joy in their hearts after telling me all about <br/>
something that they feel real passionately about.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very nice, I really like this.<br/>
Welcome to a group of very passionate people! I think you&#39;ll like it here.<br/>
