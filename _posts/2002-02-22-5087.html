<div id="ygrps-yiv-272455182">Thank you Pam S. You said what I needed to hear. My kids are mine and their <br/>
temperments unique. They have valued traits. My 3rd is that easy going type <br/>
you mentioned. In her I see compliance, calm, already at 2. The book you <br/>
mentioned sounds good, I have never heard of it before. Again, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Riley and I went to play tennis at the courts. He has asked to do <br/>
this with me for a few days. We finally found the time during Ashley&#39;s play <br/>
practice. We spent 15 minutes or so hitting the ball over the net. He did <br/>
not once yell at me that I was hitting it wrong, as he has done in the past. <br/>
We played until he tired then dunked our sweaty heads under the water <br/>
faucet. A complete joyful experience for both of us. Hurry.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to you soon, Mary<br/>
