<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163760117">These two came very separately, but go together very well!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I used to debate the merits of unschooling there, but was  <br/>
basically told I wasn&#39;t being respectful enough of everyone else&#39;s  <br/>
methods of unschooling by suggesting people respect their kids and  <br/>
help them get their needs met. That every family does what works for  <br/>
them and that was more important than examining our motives. Mostly,  <br/>
it&#39;s a list for doing field trips/meeting other families anyway, not  <br/>
delving into philosophy and making one&#39;s life sweeter.-=-<br/>

-=-&quot;Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small  <br/>
minds discuss people.&quot; -- Hyman Rickover-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who Hyman Rickover is, and I don&#39;t want to tell you who  <br/>
wrote the first thing (about a regional list), but look what a  <br/>
match!!  I love my e-mail.  It turns up treasures of juxtaposition  <br/>
and melding.<br/>

<br/>
I have had this quote (Great minds...) taped on my refrigerator for so <br/>
long the tape has yellowed; however, the credit on the one I cut out <br/>
was given to Eleanor Roosevelt!? I wish I remember what paper I had cut <br/>
it out from.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know who Hyman Rickover is, either, but I&#39;m going to google <br/>
him right now. Interesting. <br/>
<br/>
I love that you share your e-mail and your connections. You mean a lot <br/>
to our family...thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415106985">Wow!  Something I actually remember from school!  This quote:<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small<br/>
minds discuss people.&quot; -- Hyman Rickover-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall being told the source, but I remember my third grade <br/>
teacher telling us this.  Mrs. Finley always lectured us and told us <br/>
what she thought about life (&quot;&quot;Sorry&quot; is the most important word in <br/>
the English language.  &#39;I&#39; is the least important&quot;) and about us.  I <br/>
was fascinated by her even though she did lots of harm.  I&#39;m still <br/>
scarred from being called lazy by her.  And she put the rowdy boys <br/>
out in the hall for basically the whole year.  But she taught us <br/>
square-dancing which gave us girls the opportunity to hold hands with <br/>
boys in a sanctioned way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015818010">Sorry I was trying to use kwout which allows one to capture part of a<br/>
website with images and links intact.<br/>
<br/>
The Wikiquote page declares that Admiral Rickover attributed the quote to an<br/>
unknown sage, and that attribution to Eleanor Roosevelt is without citation.<br/>
<br/>
From the wikipedia page I tried to Kwout: *&quot;Admiral Hyman George Rickover*,<br/>
United States Navy, (January 27, 1900 or August 24, 1898 ï¿½ July 8, 1986) was<br/>
known as the &quot;Father of the Nuclear Navy&quot;,&quot;<br/>
