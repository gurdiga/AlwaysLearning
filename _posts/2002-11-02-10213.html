Question: Which of the following are NOT modes<br/>
<br/>
into which Kirby can transform?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Needle Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Ninja Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Tornado Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Sword Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Thunder Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Microphone Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Stone Kirby<br/>
<br/>
Ice Kirby<br/>
<br/>
If those, I&#39;ve never seen Kirby Dodd by Needle Kirby, Microphone Kirby, or <br/>
Stone Kirby.  I&#39;ve seen all the rest myself in person. &lt;bwg&gt;</div>
