<div id="ygrps-yiv-572871245">My dd is 12 almost 13.  She has never been skinny, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
anyone would say she was fat either.  She has been getting &quot;chunkier&quot; <br/>

bikinis and feel good about herself in them, but she doesn&#39;t.<br/>
I don&#39;t know really how to handle it because I was raised with a very <br/>
weight conscious father, and have struggled all my life to keep my <br/>
weight down.  It&#39;s always been a part of my self image, and I&#39;m not <br/>
sure I&#39;m a great role model.  In the past year I have gained some <br/>
control through a change in diet and exercising.  I try to encourage <br/>
my dd to eat better and get exercise, but it&#39;s a hard line to walk.<br/>
I don&#39;t want her to feel I would value her more if she were thin, but <br/>
i don&#39;t want her to be unhappy with herself, so I&#39;ll remind her about <br/>
eating better, or getting more exercise.  We go back and forth on me <br/>
telling her she needs to make better choices(because she is <br/>
complaining about being fat) and me just letting it go entirely, <br/>
because I do know it has to come from her,not me.<br/>
My problem is the back and forth issue.  When I let it go, I feel <br/>
like I&#39;m not being a good mother.  When I bring up that maybe she <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have that 3rd cupcake, i feel like I&#39;m harping. (because I <br/>
am!)<br/>
We discuss it, and she knows she needs to eat better and get more <br/>
exercise, but she never follows through.  When I offer to do active <br/>
things with her, or fix healthy foods instead of the things she fixes <br/>
for herself, she feels like I&#39;m trying to control her, and balks, so <br/>
I give up.  Asking her if she wants to go for a bike ride can become <br/>
a huge drama.  She&#39;ll say &quot;no&quot; then she&#39;ll say she feels guilty cause <br/>
she knows she should, and that she knows I want her to, to get the <br/>
exercise, then she&#39;ll come and whine the whole time.  So i stop <br/>
asking cause it gets old really quick.<br/>
I also know she is grieving Sam, and is also in the midst of puberty <br/>
and that doesn&#39;t help the situation.  But she has always had a sweet <br/>
tooth and tends to like to fill up on that stuff.<br/>
I feel I should be helping her, but I don&#39;t know how.<br/>
Any suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917103266">Grief and hormones and genetics all working on your little girl sounds<br/>
rough.  <br/>
<br/>
If you were to just focus on things she really loves to do and things<br/>
she&#39;s good at, I wonder if that would improve her self image?   Maybe<br/>
she&#39;s forgotten some good things about herself, some talents and passions<br/>
and you can help her find those again.   After my dad died, it took me<br/>
awhile to remember there were paints in the cupboard and flowers in the<br/>
garden and art galleries to visit and ponds full of ducks.   <br/>
<br/>
If she becomes naturally happier with herself and her accomplishments her<br/>
self image maybe won&#39;t be based on how she fits into a bathing suit.   I<br/>
don&#39;t know, Joanna.   If she finds things about herself to really like<br/>
and be happy with, the rest might fall into place naturally.<br/>
<br/>
If you go for walks and bike rides and talk about what you saw and what a<br/>
nice time you had, she may be encouraged to go along with you sometimes. <br/>
Do you live where you can hike and explore?   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get some good ideas, and I&#39;ll keep thinking about it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424631272">I highly recommend that BOTH you and your dd read &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot;.<br/>
It may help you both to understand society, the parent-female teen<br/>
relationship, and teen experience more--- as well as get past so much of<br/>
the garbage our culture places on our young girls.<br/>
