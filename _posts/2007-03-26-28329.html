 </span></blockquote>I only play well against the computer, since it keeps score <br/>
automatically and since I can try out my words to find the highest <br/>
value.  I tried -- once -- to play at a club meeting, and just couldn&#39;t <br/>
cope with the timer; it takes me too long to find a good word if I have <br/>
to figure the score in my head.  As a matter of fact, I didn&#39;t even try <br/>
to keep my *own* score tally, just trusted the opponent to be right.  <br/>
When I play at homeschool park day, for some reason I end up keeping <br/>
score -- maybe it&#39;s because its my game board...  My friends know I <br/>
need the basic addition practice -- still, I don&#39;t count up their <br/>
turn&#39;s score, I just ask what it is and add it to the column.<br/>
<br/>
My dh doesn&#39;t grasp that adding an &quot;s&quot; to the end of a word isn&#39;t as <br/>
good a play as making some other word that includes that &quot;s&quot; and <br/>
putting it perpendicular.  He&#39;s as stubborn about playing word games as <br/>
I am about math ones &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You reminded me of another incident from my weird youth; I was playing <br/>
Solitaire (with cards ;-) and my dad commented that, if I could play <br/>
Solitaire that well, why did I have so much trouble with math?<br/>
<br/>
I immediately got a migraine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve been wondering if you liked solitaire and <br/>
thinking &quot;well, that&#39;s a math game&quot;. I&#39;m fond of Spider solitaire <br/>
and also Free Cell - which works best on the computer, but I&#39;ve had <br/>
friends living computerless who loved Free Cell so much they would <br/>
write down the starting layout so they could start over as often as <br/>
they needed to. Free Cell is a fabulous logic puzzle. But you don&#39;t <br/>
need to think about that to enjoy it. <br/>
<br/>
So if you like Solitaire, you *know* what it feels like to enjoy <br/>
math (as long as no-one tells you its math, anyway).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I still don&#39;t buy it.  If I like it, it can&#39;t be math &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Math is what you find on the pages of a third grade textbook.  When <br/>
people talk about enjoying math, finding beauty in it, etc., I truly do <br/>
think they mean they LIKE third grade math problems and find them <br/>
beautiful.  For me, math never got off the page.  Dear Mrs. Gaunt <br/>
wouldn&#39;t allow students to look away from their workbooks (&quot;daydream&quot;), <br/>
and, having caught me looking out the window, dragged my desk up next <br/>
to hers so she could more conveniently hit my hand with a ruler when I <br/>
looked up again.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone want to guess why I decided to homeschool my kids, before I <br/>
even had any?  ;-)<br/>

Sometimes there&#39;s something really attractive about the music.  Same  <br/>
with Shakespeare on paper.  Sometimes there&#39;s something that&#39;s just  <br/>
beautiful to look at.  Not often, though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a rhyme also LOOKS rhymish (the words have similar forms,  <br/>
not just similar sounds).<br/>
<br/>
I have some keyboard music that I played just because of the  <br/>
notation.  But still, it was a moment, not the lifetime of that music.<br/>
<br/>
Beethoven could do that--he needed to, when he was deaf and kept  <br/>
writing.   In Victorian times, there were people who could write  <br/>
music so well they would go to performances and transcribe the music  <br/>
they heard and then sell it illegally.  It was like bootleg DVDs of  <br/>
the 1880&#39;s.<br/>

Nancy had written, a few weeks ago, &quot;You won&#39;t believe this, but I  <br/>

Marty has a page-a-day calendar, and Tuesday&#39;s had this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Beatles are not merely awful; they are so unbelievably horrible,  <br/>
so appallingly unmusical, so dogmatically insensitive to the magic of  <br/>
the art, that they qualify as crowned heads of anti-music.&quot;  -- <br/>
William F. Buckley<br/>
<br/>
So I wondered if that quote was from the very early 60&#39;s, before they  <br/>
were doing so much of their own stuff and fewer covers of American  <br/>
music.    I found it noted as 1964 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bartleby.com/">http://www.bartleby.com/</a> <br/>
63/86/7886.html  So yes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if he changed his mind later, but I would WAY rather  <br/>
listen to the worst of the Beatles than read (or hear) the best of  <br/>
Willliam F. Buckley Jr.<br/>
