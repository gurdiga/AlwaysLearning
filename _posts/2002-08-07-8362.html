<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141014093">&lt;...He&#39;s back from his three-month Australian trip (if<br/>
you remember me mentioning this before--he&#39;s back even<br/>
if you don&#39;t remember me mentioning it! &lt;g&gt;) and I&#39;m<br/>
working hard on getting him NOT to go back <br/>
to work. We&#39;re still too young to &quot;retire&quot;, whatever<br/>
that means these days, but there are lots of ways to<br/>
make enough money to live w/o engaging in work you<br/>
don&#39;t like. I&#39;m reading &quot;Making a Living Without a <br/>
Job&quot; aloud each day and he&#39;s beginning to show signs<br/>
of real interest.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some other books you might enjoy:<br/>
 &quot;The Joy of Not Working&quot; by Ernie J. Zelinski.  <br/>
 &quot;Your money or your life&quot; by Joe Dominguez and Vicki<br/>

my dh &quot;retired&quot; from his corporate job a few years<br/>
ago. He was 39.  He started  his own business, a<br/>
subscription website, which began as just a hobby.  He<br/>
now works a couple hours a day & makes more money than<br/>
he did at his corporate job.  NOT what we expected! <br/>
But we are not complaining LOL.<br/>
<br/>
back to lurking :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045914461">&lt;What does he fill his free hours with?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He reads a lot, hikes, spends a lot of time with the<br/>
kids & me, and at the moment he is buying a saxophone.<br/>
 He started taking lessons last year, until his<br/>
teacher moved to Vegas.  <br/>
<br/>
We also spend a little more time traveling.  We spent<br/>
a month on the road in April - drove through Texas &<br/>
visited his parents & sister, then to LA for a<br/>
wedding, then to Key West (just because), then to<br/>
Disneyworld where we met my parents, then through GA<br/>
to see my Grandmother & Uncle, then back to Birmingham<br/>
to see my other Grandma & my parents again, then back<br/>
to Dallas for a friends wedding & then home to Tucson.<br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s parents are coming to visit this weekend & we are<br/>
going to take them up to the Grand Canyon & down<br/>
through Sedona & such.<br/>
