<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227333187">Anyone who wants to skip this by should do so.  It&#39;s about diet (and belief and fear and control and magical thinking).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone kindly sent me links to these articles by Stan Cox, with information on scientific studies on wheat&#39;s effects and on the origins of the spreading belief that wheat is of the devil and that children will be virtuous and brighter and live longer if they have panicky parents controlling them   (that part is my own wording).  It&#39;s a fad, and one of several that have come along since I&#39;ve been helping unschoolers.  People can be mad at me about saying so if they want to, but it might be worth reading these articles and following some of the trails he points to.  Be mad at him, too, if you want to ignore those scientific studies.<br/>

The Great Gluten Panic, Part 2   2/6/2014<br/>

His closing is this:<br/>
<br/>
_________<br/>
<br/>
Amid so much erroneous denigration of wheat, millions of Americans have been diagnosing themselves as gluten intolerant and eliminating wheat products from their diets. Now if you feel better on an elimination diet, no matter whether it&#39;s a physiological or a placebo effect at work, then why not go for it? And it certainly can&#39;t hurt to stop eating refined wheat flour and some of the nutritionally empty ingredients with which it is often combined. But the gap created by wheat-elimination diets is being plugged in large part with those highly processed, often sugar- and fat-heavy foods being churned out by the $4 billion “gluten-free” industry(Meanwhile, an artisan baker I know says some customers are now refusing his whole-grain loaves on the grounds of gluten intolerance, even as they continue to buy croissants and danish—which he&#39;s more than happy to supply.) Alternatively, going all-in on a low-carb diet (as recommended by many, including Davis) has an insupportable ecological impact.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, simply switching to whole-grain foods as a replacement for empty-calorie, low-fiber products made from refined flours, sugars, etc. can pay big dividends for most of us. But unfortunately, any such healthful trend will remain stalled until the gluten-free fad has faded away, as fads always do.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Read the whole article (it&#39;s not very long) if this has been an issue in or around your family.  Knowledge is power.  Awareness of the existence (and location) of sources of bullshit is also very valuable.<br/>
<br/>
What I have on my site is rough still (notes from a conference talk) but I&#39;ll add what&#39;s above, too, to: <br/>

&gt; underdiagnosed<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband is also a celiac. Diagnosing it requires a simple blood test, and <br/>
has to be done before you eliminate gluten. Why would you eliminate <br/>
something on the grounds that it MIGHT be a problem? Why not find out for <br/>
sure, and then act accordingly?<br/>
<br/>
Having gluten makes my husband very uncomfortable (extreme stomach cramps <br/>
and irritable bowel and extreme tiredness (he was diagnosed after I said he <br/>
needed to see a doctor after sleeping 16 hours a day and still being <br/>
tired)), but even with that knowledge, he went on and off gluten for a few <br/>
years before deciding, for himself, that he felt better off it. The symptoms <br/>
affected him, not me, so it wasn&#39;t my decision to make. I just supported him <br/>
by providing the best gluten free food I could find when he wanted it. I <br/>
would do the same if my daughter showed any symptoms, test first, then <br/>
support her in her own choices. Luckily, she seems to have no issues at this <br/>
point, and I&#39;m not spending every moment looking for them.<br/>
