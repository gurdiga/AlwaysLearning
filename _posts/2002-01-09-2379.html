  the rug and the mat. We don&#39;t smell it, but I think there must be some<br/>

  (and only at night for some reason) she&#39;ll pee on it. I can&#39;t figure it<br/>
  out. Without a mat the rug must still smell, but she leaves it alone. It<br/>
  can&#39;t be a health thing, since as long as I pick up the mat at night she<br/>
  always leaves the area alone and uses the litter box. Getting a male cat<br/>
  to not spray is much more difficult if they&#39;ve already done it. I agree<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000363748">Travelling Willbury&#39;s would be way cool, but travelling unschoolers<br/>
could be fun too.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to combine this into my last post (which had the intro), but<br/>
it would&#39;ve been way too long.<br/>
<br/>
The one good thing about the Navy is that dh will be able to retire when<br/>
he&#39;s 48 (in 8 years). That is very cool. I can surely put up with it<br/>
until then.<br/>
<br/>
(hold on, I&#39;m coming to the connection)<br/>
<br/>
When we retire we&#39;re going to move to upstate NY - the adirondacks to be<br/>
more precise. We like to go there for the summers. The kids do know<br/>
other kids there, though we are pretty far from others - sort of out in<br/>
the boondocks. We spent one year up there a couple of years ago while dh<br/>
went to school in Boston. So we even know a bunch of homeschoolers.<br/>
(just as a btw, with the couple of dozen families we know up there and<br/>
have done stuff with, never was religion ever even mentioned. I don&#39;t<br/>
even know what anyone&#39;s religion is.)<br/>
<br/>
To allow us to spend as much time as we wanted for as long as we wanted,<br/>
we decided that mil&#39;s cabin just wasn&#39;t going to cut it. So we bought an<br/>
old fixer-upper farm house that we work on a bit every summer. If anyone<br/>
really is doing a road trip and ends up that way in the summer months,<br/>
we&#39;d be happy to have you. :-) We have some acres, a stream, beaver<br/>
ponds, and then there&#39;s always grandma&#39;s lake. If it is too cold for<br/>
tents (or the coyotes scare ya) there&#39;s always the not-yet-done upstairs<br/>
which includes multiple layers of grandma&#39;s teensy-weensy-flowers wall<br/>
paper mixed in with a few assorted holes in the plaster. Hey, at least<br/>
you&#39;ll stay dry. :-) Also, we have two cats and two dogs.<br/>
<br/>
cat pee.....  My sil visited us here in FL last year. After I asked her<br/>
to please leave her door open a little so the cat could get in to use<br/>
the litterbox in that bathroom, she closed it. My poor sweet Rosebud,<br/>
just couldn&#39;t hold it any longer and decided to use the mat by the back<br/>
door instead. I have used every concoction imaginable, (but if anyone<br/>

sooner - before they start spraying) is the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Something I learned today - My spell checker didn&#39;t like two l&#39;s in<br/>
travelling, but my dictionary said the two l variation is British, so I<br/>
left them with two. Does anyone know if any others, besides George, in<br/>
the Travelling Willbury&#39;s are British? Or maybe a Willbury is a cute<br/>
furry British animal? Where did they get that name?<br/>
