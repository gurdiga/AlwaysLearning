<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409709340">And I totally forgot to write about what I had intended!! I meant to <br/>
tell about last night, and got off on all the other things that had <br/>
been going on.<br/>
<br/>
First, you have to imagine my narrow kitchen. It&#39;s a galley <br/>
kitchen..you can almost touch both sides with your arms outstretched <br/>
and about 16 feet long. The kids pulled my folding laundry door <br/>
across the entrance so there was a very narrow opening to the kitchen <br/>
and put up a sign that said &quot;You can get in if you have an I.D. <br/>
because we&#39;re cooking&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Each of us was issued an &quot;ID&quot;. This spawned into a menu (Sierra wrote <br/>
up about three before settling on one we all agreed on) that had <br/>
items like &quot;copcaks&quot; (cupcakes) and &quot;cooces&quot; (cookies). Trevor made <br/>
up a badge for himself that said &quot;manager&quot; complete with a picture of <br/>
himself. So now we&#39;ve got a manager, an owner (me), a Chef (Jared) <br/>
and a waitress/menu designer (Sierra).<br/>
<br/>
Jalen was asleep so Markus had to be our customer.<br/>
I was so amazed at how diligent they all worked, even cleaning dishes <br/>
in order to have a work space. Jared made fried rice, we had lentil <br/>
soup, salad and Sierra made up a sherbert/fruit dessert.<br/>
The table actually got cleaned off by the kids (that&#39;s a first) and <br/>
they set up candles and a lovely place setting.<br/>
<br/>
When Markus came upstairs for his dining experience, they served him <br/>
like pros, Sierra looked so cute in an apron.:)<br/>
So from cooking and cleaning, to serving and menu creation they did <br/>
it all with me acting as part cook, part clean up crew. <br/>
And the best part?<br/>
Jared and Sierra each got a nice tip!<br/>
Funny how motivated people get when they&#39;re interested in something <br/>
eh?<br/>
