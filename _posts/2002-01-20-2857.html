<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287607342"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Deb L, wondering if there would be a market for<br/>
&gt;inflatable sheep and if I could sell them on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sunday...<br/>
<br/>
I just had to post on this.  Indeed there is a market<br/>
for inflatable sheep and indeed there are those<br/>
catering to that market.  I have told this story many<br/>
times over the years, so I will share it again.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in San Francisco and there are a lot of<br/>
strange things available there for the,<br/>
ah...discerning connisuer of weirdness I guess.  One<br/>
day while I was riding the bus to my job downtown, as<br/>
a teen, I passed through the district North of Market<br/>
St. which is known for being a somewhat nasty slum. <br/>
Cheap hookers, sex paraphenalia shops, drug addicts<br/>
and nasty rooms by the hour hotels abounded there,<br/>
amongst less savory things.  It is called,<br/>
appropriately enough although not by design, the<br/>
Tenderloin.<br/>
<br/>
While passing one of the sex shops that was on the<br/>
same street as the bus route, and which possessed a<br/>
theater style marquee, I happened to read their add<br/>
running on the marquee.  It read &quot;Just In!  New Blow<br/>
Up Sheep!&quot;  I laughed all the rest of the way to work<br/>
and have retold the incident many times.<br/>
