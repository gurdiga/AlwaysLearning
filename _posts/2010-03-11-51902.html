<div id="ygrps-yiv-137552066">I am definitely new to unschooling.  I love reading all the posts and<br/>
Sandra&#39;s stuff and haven&#39;t posted much myself.  I have been seeing some<br/>
really neat stuff happening in our house, though, and I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
I have the privilege of living and learning with a 9-year-old boy who is my<br/>
step-son.  I also have an almost-1-year-old daughter (as of St. Patrick&#39;s<br/>
Day, next week!).  I also have a 14-year-old step-daughter who attends<br/>
public school, and I am due with my second baby in May.  Whew.  My energy<br/>
level waxes and wanes.<br/>
<br/>
Julian, my step-son, and I (and Julian&#39;s dad, my hubby Darin) have been<br/>
deschooling for only a little while -- maybe since December, so not long at<br/>
all.  He had been homeschooled by his grandmother in a very traditional,<br/>
structured curriculum/program since he &quot;started school&quot; at age five.  Since<br/>
I &quot;took over,&quot; as it was termed, we&#39;ve been working on deschooling.  And we<br/>
are still going to be working on that for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Julian has been saying and hearing &quot;let&#39;s do school,&quot; &quot;let&#39;s get done with<br/>
school so we can do something fun,&quot; &quot;are you/we done with school yet?&quot; &quot;how<br/>
much school have you got done?&quot; his whole life.  That line of commentary<br/>
about &quot;school&quot; had become very stifling for all of us.  We had a &quot;school<br/>
room&quot; in our house, up on the third floor, that he avoided at all times<br/>
unless forced, a room he hated.  As soon as I became the &quot;teacher&quot; (another<br/>
word we have tossed out for the most part, although Julian still uses it<br/>
from time to time), one of the first things we did was to empty the school<br/>
room out.  I told Julian he could have that room to turn into a play room or<br/>
whatever.  You ought to see it now.  He filled it up with toys and Legos and<br/>
race tracks.  He&#39;s got a cool racetrack set up in there, and spends hours<br/>
playing with his cars and other toys that have been sort of packed away and<br/>
hard to get to for awhile.  I packed away a lot of the schooly stuff in<br/>
totes, to go through later.  I&#39;ve kept out many books and stuff and brought<br/>
them down to my bookshelves, but since we&#39;ve been pretty &quot;grade&quot;-oriented<br/>
here for a long time, I am putting away text books that proclaim to be<br/>
&quot;fourth grade&quot; or &quot;fifth grade,&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
About the &quot;teacher&quot; word:  for awhile, J was going around telling everyone,<br/>
&quot;Deb is my teacher now, not Gram.&quot;  But we kind of talked about that -- he<br/>
and I have been having conversations about &quot;learning&quot; and finding things out<br/>
together.  It&#39;s been helpful to have a baby around who is learning all kinds<br/>
of stuff, because I can use her as an example.  I say things like, &quot;Look at<br/>
your little sister learning to walk.  I can&#39;t teach her that -- I&#39;m not her<br/>
teacher.  She is learning because she is enjoying the challenge and the new<br/>
feel of being able to get around in a different way.  There&#39;s not much I can<br/>
do except offer a hand or a support, and give her a big hug when she is so<br/>
happy with herself for walking.  Same thing with you -- I don&#39;t know most of<br/>
these things you&#39;re interested in, so we have to learn together.&quot;  And he&#39;s<br/>
realizing that I don&#39;t do what his Gram did -- make him sit at a desk in the<br/>
school room, while I stand up at a white board at the front of the room and<br/>
lecture from curriculum books.  So, that&#39;s what he thinks of when he thinks<br/>
&quot;teacher,&quot; and I don&#39;t do anything close to that.<br/>
<br/>
When Julian asks me his million questions daily, my common response is, &quot;I<br/>
really don&#39;t know -- let&#39;s look it up.&quot;  He used to hate that -- because it<br/>
meant he was going to get a &quot;lesson.&quot;  But now, if we look something up, we<br/>
only look it up long enough to satiate his momentary curiosity.  Some things<br/>
he spends more time on, but others, he has a fleeting question (as I do<br/>
sometimes), and it&#39;s good enough to find a definition or a quick blurb on<br/>
Wikipedia or something.  Also, he asks me the meanings of words fairly<br/>
often.  I used to ask him to look the words up, but now, most of the time, I<br/>
just give him the definition if I feel like I can give him a good definition<br/>
or a good, useful synonym.  He has a dictionary lying around if I&#39;m not<br/>
available or if I can&#39;t seem to put the right meaning to the word.  Then<br/>
I&#39;ll look it up for or with him.<br/>
<br/>
Our biggest obstacle is Julian&#39;s bio-mom, only because she has a real say in<br/>
whether or not Julian continues to be homeschooled.  She could come to us<br/>
disgruntled and say, &quot;I want him in school,&quot; and we&#39;d have to discuss it<br/>
with her and come to a compromise.  Julian keeps saying, &quot;I didn&#39;t do any<br/>
school today,&quot; or &quot;We didn&#39;t hardly do anything today,&quot; which, if we were an<br/>
intact family and not subject to whims of another parent, wouldn&#39;t bother me<br/>
at all.  We&#39;ve kind of had to work around that -- talking about how we&#39;re<br/>
all always learning, and he does some computer-based stuff that he enjoys.<br/>
I find this is the most difficult part for me -- having to answer to someone<br/>
else about him.  There are very few &quot;have-tos,&quot; but this is one that I can&#39;t<br/>
figure a way around.  Julian&#39;s bio-mom isn&#39;t capable of taking care of him,<br/>
but she has a lot of say in how *we* take care of him.  I don&#39;t know if it<br/>
will ever come up, but I do keep track (out of Julian&#39;s sight) of the<br/>
&quot;projects&quot; he does and activities he does so that I can, if necessary, try<br/>
to justify the types of learning he is experiencing.  Some people, I<br/>
understand, have to do this based on the state in which they live.  We live<br/>
in Indiana -- a very laid-back homeschooling state as far as reporting<br/>
requirements (as in, we only have to report attendance) -- but I just<br/>
imagine myself living in a more strict state where I may have to answer to<br/>
someone at some point, and make notes to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, my hubby and I are both pretty connected with the idea of<br/>
unschooling -- something I was thinking about last night, and wanted to<br/>
mention.  He and I are both over-educated, and we both agree that the amount<br/>
of formal education we received was unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
We both left &quot;mainstream&quot; jobs and made lots of sacrifices to live a<br/>
family-centered life, growing veggies and selling to restaurants and farmers<br/>
markets to make our living.  My husband is not attached to any sense of<br/>
competition for his children, nor does he care whether or not they go to<br/>
college or do anything that mainstream society might expect for them.  If<br/>
they want to work with us on the farm, great.  If they want to do something<br/>
else, great.  He supports their passions, and has no problem with Julian<br/>
deciding he&#39;d rather spend the day working in the greenhouse with dad than<br/>
inside reading.  We both like &quot;apprentice&quot;-type learning, and try to find<br/>
other adults who are doing things that Julian might express an interest in.<br/>
As he gets older, we&#39;ll probably help him find resources like that for<br/>
things that inspire him.  Not too worried about it at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I know this message is all over the place, but I wanted to mention one other<br/>
thing.  Julian&#39;s Gram had placed all of the &quot;age-appropriate&quot; books on<br/>
shelves in the school room when she was teaching.  And since Julian avoided<br/>
anything smacking of school or the school room, those books sat there<br/>
collecting dust.  When I emptied the room out, we carried a bunch of those<br/>
books down to the main living area in our house, where we have all kinds of<br/>
books on shelves -- my books, Darin&#39;s books, baby and little kid books,<br/>
reference books, etc.  When Julian was &quot;doing school,&quot; his Gram required him<br/>
to do book reports -- which he hated and which I thought were incredibly<br/>
counterproductive and boring.  It made him HATE reading, hate books, and<br/>
hate writing.  Well, since we quit all that nonsense, and I scattered all<br/>
those books among our books, he has been asking me things like, &quot;Deb, can I<br/>
pick out a book to read?&quot;  I said sure and told him he doesn&#39;t have to ask<br/>
me.  He devoured James and the Giant Peach in two days about a week ago.<br/>
Only thing I asked him was if he liked it.  There are other books lying<br/>
around and I&#39;m not suggesting anything at all.  I love reading.  His dad is<br/>
a big reader.  We read a lot to Josephine (the baby).  And he reads a lot on<br/>
his computer games -- mostly World of Warcraft.<br/>
<br/>
I have also noticed this:  he is spending less time on World of Warcraft and<br/>
more time doing all kinds of other stuff -- NOT that there is anything wrong<br/>
with video games, but I will say that I think World of Warcraft had become<br/>
J&#39;s ONLY means of control in his world.  He used to die to &quot;finish&quot; school<br/>
so he could get to his WoW.  I don&#39;t have a problem with WoW.  Nowadays,<br/>
though, he&#39;ll spend a little time on WoW, then go outside and play a little,<br/>
then go up to his playroom, then read for awhile, then watch TV for awhile,<br/>
etc.  I just think he feels a little bit more in control of his world, and<br/>
WoW is just part of it.<br/>
<br/>
He is watching a lot of TV -- mostly PBS because we don&#39;t have cable -- and<br/>
he watches a lot of shows that are maybe &quot;too young&quot; for him -- but I don&#39;t<br/>
care.  He never got to watch this stuff before because he was so busy &quot;doing<br/>
school.&quot;  He gets something out of these shows, and when he gets tired of<br/>
them, he&#39;ll move on, I&#39;m sure.  He also LOVES to watch M*A*S*H -- his dad&#39;s<br/>
favorite show -- and he will watch one episode after another from our DVDs.<br/>
He has had all kinds of questions about war, and army ranks, and how things<br/>
are now in Korea and medicine and ethics (even though he doesn&#39;t know that&#39;s<br/>
what he&#39;s asking).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to post some of our positives as we continue to<br/>
deschool and as Julian is getting more control over his world.<br/>
<br/>
The list has been really helpful to me during this process.<br/>

aimed at younger kids is really interesting. Rosie, especially, has gone <br/>
through phases of watching a lot of kids&#39; shows on tv (and it wasn&#39;t <br/>
because she missed out on them when she was young). For her, there is <br/>
some kind of recentering going on within her when she does this. I get <br/>
the feeling of it putting her back in touch with who she was when she <br/>
watched those shows - there is some kind of personality integration <br/>
going on.<br/>

Holly watches them with an eye to how they were produced and what the  <br/>
intent is.  She came back with stories about children&#39;s shows in the  <br/>
U.K., especially Big Cook, Little Cook.<br/>

She watches them just for fun, too, but even when she was little she  <br/>
would come and say &quot;They&#39;re trying to help kids want to go to school,&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;This is about being nice to old people.&quot;<br/>

Wow!  Thanks for sharing all of that!  I have a question... How&#39;s his relationship with his gram now that she&#39;s not his teacher anymore?  When you first posted a while back I had wondering how that would change.<br/>

Wow! Thanks for sharing all of that! I have a question... How&#39;s his<br/>
relationship with his gram now that she&#39;s not his teacher anymore? When you<br/>
first posted a while back I had wondering how that would change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His relationship with his Gram (who, for the record, is my mother-in-law)<br/>
has not changed, except in the amount of time he spends with her.  He loves<br/>
doing fun things with her, which has actually been better, I think, because<br/>
she doesn&#39;t feel forced into this role as &quot;teacher.&quot;  She really struggled<br/>
with the role switch, thinking she had to be this tough disciplinarian as<br/>
his teacher and then feeling all guilty as his grandmother.  That&#39;s what<br/>
happened with the older child, my step-daughter, who is now 14 and in public<br/>
school.  Their relationship deteriorated to the point of tears and fighting<br/>
and awful, awful &quot;school&quot; days by the time Caitlin was 11.  It was awful.<br/>
Which is partly why Darin and I decided we needed to transition Julian<br/>
before the same thing happened.  He was starting to hate learning and he was<br/>
starting to rebel a lot against his Gram.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s been better for both of them.<br/>
<br/>
Biggest issue is that when she comes over or sees him, one of the first<br/>
things she inevitably asks Julian is, &quot;How&#39;s school going?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since Julian&#39;s days are nothing like his school days with her, he usually<br/>
says, &quot;I&#39;m not really doing much school,&quot; and she looks at me alarmed and<br/>
starts giving me ideas.<br/>
<br/>
She made a big deal about it when she was giving up teaching, because she<br/>
thought I might not be able to &quot;handle everything&quot; with the baby and another<br/>
on the way.  I continue to assure her that we are handling things and that<br/>
he is learning.  Of course, in her mind, Handling It means doing it Her Way,<br/>
and we&#39;re not doing that, so....she probably still thinks I&#39;m not handling<br/>
it, but...whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I frankly think it ticked her off when we emptied out the school room -- but<br/>
that&#39;s more about her relationship with *us* than anything having to do with<br/>
Julian.  She adores Julian and he adores her.<br/>
<br/>
She has always been really, really involved, and that&#39;s been part of our<br/>
transition that&#39;s been difficult, but has more required Darin to step up and<br/>
say, &quot;Hey, this is my kid and this is how we want to live life with him --<br/>
not your way.&quot;  Not that abruptly of course, but in his own mind.<br/>
<br/>
Example of learning I shared with Gram recently:<br/>
A couple of weeks ago, our entire family came down with a terrible stomach<br/>
virus -- every single one of us, one day after another, got hit.  Two of us<br/>
-- me and my step-daughter -- ended up in the hospital getting IV fluids<br/>
because of it.  Julian had TONS of questions about viruses -- how they work,<br/>
how they spread, what they look like, how we avoid them in the future, etc.<br/>
etc. etc.  So, for days and days after our bout, we looked up all kinds of<br/>
stuff about viruses.  He had questions about soaps and cleaners and if the<br/>
virus could live on his toothbrush -- and so we spent as long as he wanted<br/>
talking about it and looking stuff up.<br/>
<br/>
When I told his Gram about this, I think she almost felt a little jealous<br/>
that she hadn&#39;t had such interesting &quot;science lessons&quot; ever with him, or<br/>
such involvement or interest by him.  I told her about it, because I often<br/>
share the ideas I think about learning and &quot;education,&quot; and I used that as<br/>
an example of how we&#39;re &quot;doing school&quot; differently.<br/>
<br/>
She has a lot of anxiety about the kids&#39; bio-mom getting angry and seeking<br/>
custody -- we are more laid back about that.  For one thing, it hasn&#39;t<br/>
happened.  For another, it probably isn&#39;t ever going to happen.  Julian&#39;s<br/>
bio-mom is a lot more reasonable than Gram gives her credit for, and she<br/>
knows we&#39;re taking good care of the kids.  Anytime anything comes up, we all<br/>
talk about it.  So, I&#39;m really not concerned.  But Gram will continue to<br/>
worry.<br/>
<br/>
Gram also keeps bringing me school stuff from her house -- &quot;for when<br/>
Josephine gets older&quot; -- flash cards and grammar books etc. etc. etc.  I<br/>
just thank her and pack them for &quot;later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Julian&#39;s relationship with Gram is fine -- OUR relationship with her<br/>
continues to evolve.  :)<br/>
<br/>

former teacher, too &lt;g&gt;)? It might help her relax about what she  <br/>
perceived her role to be and enjoy her grandma-ness now.<br/>
<br/>
It might be a good way to introduce what you are doing now with Julian  <br/>
and maybe change the kind of interactions she has with him.<br/>
