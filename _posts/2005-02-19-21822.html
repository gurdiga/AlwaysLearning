<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583903655">Hi, I&#39;ve been on this list for a while, reading<br/>
everybody&#39;s comments, thoughts, ideas, etc. Very<br/>
helpful! <br/>
<br/>
Our family has been moving to unschooling without<br/>
anybody&#39;s *decision* to do so--I&#39;m discovering it&#39;s a<br/>
natural progression. Well, almost all of us. Here&#39;s<br/>
the thing. My husband fully supports us, is very<br/>
involved with ds&#39;s learning, activities, etc., *but*<br/>
he&#39;s still in the mindset of school in that he&#39;s<br/>
having a hard time seeing that what our son&#39;s doing is<br/>
what&#39;s right for him at that moment. Ds John is a<br/>
video gamer and computer whiz. He likes to spend hours<br/>
playing & studying games, their designs, logic,<br/>
artwork, music, etc. He&#39;s also creating his own pc<br/>
game. Dh James is another computer/video gamer so he<br/>
can spend hours doing the same thing ds does. *But* it<br/>
seems as if dh doesn&#39;t consider what ds is doing as<br/>
valid learning. (Dh regards his time doing this as<br/>
&quot;relaxing&quot; and having fun, so it seems that he&#39;s still<br/>
having trouble recognizing that we *can* have fun and<br/>
learn at the same time...) <br/>
<br/>
Occasionally dh will ask ds what he did for math that<br/>
day, or what he did for writing, etc. And when he<br/>
does, I can see ds clam up and become sullen. He&#39;ll<br/>
not tell his dad that he wrote this incredible poem<br/>
just because &quot;it needed to come out&quot; or about a really<br/>
great conversation we had or that he&#39;s composing his<br/>
own drum solo or ... you get the idea. Ds does this<br/>
only when dh starts to get, what I call, &quot;lecturish.&quot;<br/>
When the two are just hanging out and having fun, ds<br/>
is completely open with dh, talking about a whole host<br/>
of things.<br/>
<br/>
It also doesn&#39;t help any that right now we&#39;re staying<br/>
at dh&#39;s grandparents&#39; house and it&#39;s becoming more<br/>
obvious that they are anti-hsing at worst and, at<br/>
best, think we should follow a set curriculum that&#39;s<br/>
put forth by the state and &quot;do school&quot; only during<br/>
&quot;normal school hours&quot; (their words). The grandmother<br/>
likes to brag about what one of the other<br/>
great-grandkids is doing in school (taking sax<br/>
lessons) while not commenting on the fact that ds is<br/>
learning drums, violin, is a great storyteller, can<br/>
understand complex & abstract concepts, conversations,<br/>
loves satire, etc. (He&#39;s only 11, too.) Ds can have<br/>
meaningful or goofy conversations with *anybody* while<br/>
the other ps kids in the family can barely hold a<br/>
thought. The grandmother has even noticed this and,<br/>
I&#39;m not kidding, ask why ds doesn&#39;t have any trouble<br/>
talking to anybody but (insert other kid&#39;s name here)<br/>
is &quot;out of his league.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we *are* moving to our own house next month<br/>
(in another state, too! LOL), so that&#39;s a light at the<br/>
end of the tunnel, but I&#39;m still at a loss as how to<br/>
help dh alleviate his own fears and come to really<br/>
recognize that what ds is doing is incredible, he&#39;s<br/>
genuinely happy, and he&#39;s nurturing an amazing<br/>
personality, sense of humor, and a centeredness being<br/>
as a person.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh. Any suggestions are welcome. I&#39;m just getting<br/>
very tired feeling like I need to act as a buffer btw<br/>
our growing unschooling lifestyle and Dh&#39;s slight<br/>
resistance. I think he&#39;s giving it a try b/c he trusts<br/>
me, but I&#39;m not so sure he trusts ds enough to back<br/>
off and just let ds *be.* Does any of this make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, ideas, thoughts, comments, etc are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Lisette<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Short of standing over him to make sure he reads<br/>
these columns, I have sent him links to various<br/>
unschooling columns, particularly those by Sandra<br/>
Dodd. I&#39;m not quite at wit&#39;s end, but I fear I&#39;m<br/>
getting close to it...<br/>

Buy or rent a DVD called Video Game Revolution.<br/>
You can buy it by calling <br/>
1-800-937-5387<br/>
which is some PBS station that&#39;s selling it.<br/>
That&#39;s where we got ours.  But they might be used on Amazon by now, too, and <br/>
maybe for rent from Netflix or other places.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make a lecture about why you got it, just put it out there, and try to <br/>
arrange for your husband to watch it with your son (or all of you together).  <br/>
It&#39;s BIGtime, lifechanging.<br/>

Buffer for now.  It won&#39;t be forever.<br/>
<br/>
Conversations that might help are:  asking your husband questions that will <br/>
remind him how much he learned outside of or after he left school; pointing out <br/>
a single interesting learning moment of the day, without further commentary <br/>
(those will build up); telling an occasional school-sorrow story from your own <br/>
life or another relative.  Don&#39;t lay those on thick or demand agreement or <br/>
response.  Just float them out there.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932538267">What I did when we were staying for a month at my<br/>
parents&#39; house (retired schoolteachers) while setting<br/>
up housekeeping at our new house was to say we were<br/>
doing a unit study on home economics (moving) and just<br/>
basically declare vacation for the duration.<br/>
<br/>
If your dh is normally supportive and this has<br/>
primarily come up while staying with family, I&#39;d just<br/>
declare spring break for the month, thumb your nose at<br/>
the in-laws (politely, of course) and let everyone<br/>
know you&#39;ll be getting back to normal after you get to<br/>
the new house. Of course, normal will look a lot like<br/>
spring break except for the boxes, but you don&#39;t have<br/>
to tell them that. I try, in these situations, to keep<br/>
the relationships intact rather than educating people<br/>
on my educational philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
If dh&#39;s fears are still around after you move you can<br/>
deal with that then. I&#39;d just declare vacation until<br/>
after you move.<br/>
<br/>

Boy do I feel for you on the part about living with dh parents.  We did that<br/>
for 4 months last year.  UGH!  It also happened to be the time we<br/>
transitioned into unschooling.  I believe most of the stress will eliminate<br/>
itself once you move.  Maybe your dh is getting some flack from his parents<br/>
and that is where you get his apprehensions.  On the other hand, my<br/>
suggestion is give him stuff to read about unschooling.  I have been<br/>
fortunate to have a completely supportive husband but I will still forward<br/>
him through e-mail some threads I think are relative to us. I also asked him<br/>
to read &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;  by Valerie Fitzenreiter.  Even though he<br/>
agreed on the whole concept we were still not totally on the same page when<br/>
it came to things like bedtimes, how to handle when one of our dd asked a<br/>
question.  My dh wanted to answer it by having them figure it out instead of<br/>
just give them the answer.  Valerie has a great chapter on that particular<br/>
subject.  I have also offered websites and book titles to parents and<br/>
in-laws.  Now, they have chosen not to read anything at this point but that<br/>
is their choice.  At least I have offered information.  And the reading my<br/>
dh has done has been good for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!  I hope some of this helped.<br/>

&quot;At least&quot; puts it too lightly.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve made a move in the real positioning game that takes you from being a second-tier person to a full-blown adult.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve given them an assignment, in one way.  Another way to look at it is you&#39;ve given them an opportunity to make the next move. <br/>
<br/>
If and when they are the least big critical or ask what would be a stupid question (meaning if they had done their reading they would have the answer), you can say &quot;Did you read the book I gave you?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If the answer is no, you can say, &quot;After you read that, we could talk about it some more.&quot;   The unstated other side of that chesspiece is &quot;until you read about it, it is not my move, and any other moves you make are cheating.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005424574">Here are the two lists for Unschooling Dads that my dh is subscribed to. He<br/>
considers getting 5 emails (combined!) in a day to be &quot;enormous volume&quot; so<br/>
your dh need not fear that he will be swamped by correspondence.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDads/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDads/</a> <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SSUDs/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SSUDs/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My dh is terrible about reading books, although he does like to read both<br/>
magazines and anything when it shines out of a screen, provided it is<br/>
reasonably brief. Once when I had marked some passages in a book for him<br/>
(rather than present the whole book) he responded, sadly, with the words,<br/>
&quot;Is this another book for you to criticize me with?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I realized that I was not approaching him the best way. Now, instead of<br/>
large volumes, I forward the occasional pithy email, or link to a new<br/>
article (rather than the whole site for example). The other thing I did that<br/>
has made a lot of difference is forward some of *my* posts to him,<br/>
especially those that are &quot;theoretical musings&quot;, along with any answers they<br/>
generate, so that he gets some understanding of where my thinking is going.<br/>
<br/>
It might be better to help your dh see what he is doing as being &quot;testing<br/>
and quizzing&quot;, and offer him the information that it is the testing itself<br/>
that is anathema to free learning. I&#39;m trying to suggest that focusing on<br/>
dh&#39;s *actions* (that he can change at once) will immediately put less<br/>
pressure on your son, rather than expecting dh to prematurely embrace these<br/>
larger concepts that &quot;every activity is valid learning&quot; or &quot;learning should<br/>
be fun&quot;. As Unschoolers we know these things are true, however I believe<br/>
that your dh&#39;s actions of asking judgmental questions should be ceased<br/>
before his acceptance can blossom. I have faith that it will blossom. I&#39;m<br/>
sure that there are some links to anti-testing info websites on Sandra&#39;s<br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
As for family members:<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped with my mother (who died in January) was to send her<br/>
articles from sources that *she* respected. The example that I always repeat<br/>
is when she was being ignorantly opinionated about extended breastfeeding, I<br/>
sent her an article from the American Academy of Pediatrics, rather than one<br/>
from say, Mothering Magazine, because she was married to a doctor and had a<br/>
great deal of faith in Western medicine. The information was essentially the<br/>
same, and it quieted her fears - and she even told me &quot;OK, you know best&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I also was able to avoid getting into lengthy discussions by immediately<br/>
hanging up the phone since we lived in different states. &quot;Jayn should be<br/>
writing her name by now&quot;..&quot;No she shouldn&#39;t gotta go bye now love you&quot;<br/>
Click. This worked because my mother was a very long winded person and<br/>
letting her get started tended to lead to &quot;and another thing (you do wrong<br/>
is)....&quot; too often. <br/>
<br/>
It seems like eventually most people have to find a way to tell their<br/>
inflexible or willfully ignorant relatives effectively to &quot;butt out&quot;. It is<br/>
possible to do this kindly and nicely, acknowledging the affection that<br/>
prompts the concern. However sometimes it has to come down to an ultimatum:<br/>
&quot;WE are our children&#39;s parents and we have to do what we feel is best. If<br/>
you want to be part of their lives you will have to accept that this is our<br/>
decision.&quot; Sometimes they just don&#39;t get to be alone with the kids.<br/>
Sometimes there is a lot of discussion between the kids and parents about<br/>
the differences in attitude at Grandma&#39;s and whether it is still worth<br/>
visiting. Sometimes Grandma or Uncle merely get a card for the holidays and<br/>
little other contact. <br/>

<h4>Lisette Abbott at 2005-02-21 22:42:32 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305547680">Thank you *all* for your wonderful suggestions! I&#39;m<br/>
going to search out the Video Game Revolution and pick<br/>
up a copy of &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; asap. <br/>
<br/>
I think it *is* the fact that we&#39;re living here with<br/>
the grandparents that&#39;s getting to dh. I&#39;ve been<br/>
noticing these patterns of when he gets &quot;test-ish&quot; and<br/>
it seems that he gets that way after spending a few<br/>
hours with the grandmother. He&#39;s recently told me that<br/>
both she and the grandfather have told him that our<br/>
son needs to be in public school b/c &quot;it was good<br/>
enough&quot; for their sons. Dh, quite respectfully, has<br/>
told them that ds is *our* son and we&#39;re doing what&#39;s<br/>
right for him and for us. But then, usually the day<br/>
after spending a few hours with her, James<br/>
(husband--it&#39;s kind of awkward for me to use &quot;dh&quot; and<br/>
&quot;ds&quot;) asks the test-like questions.... So I&#39;m thinking<br/>
that once we move that stress will be alleviated.<br/>
(BTW, the inlaws have *never* told me that John should<br/>
go back to ps. He was in ps from 1st & 2nd grades. I<br/>
just hear about it from James. Also, my sister<br/>
recently told me that my own mother & brother were<br/>
talking about how John should be back in school. They<br/>
haven&#39;t told me anything, either. Hmmmm.)<br/>
<br/>
On an aside, I mentioned that James &quot;respectfully&quot;<br/>
told his grandparents etc.. James was raised in the<br/>
deep south (Louisiana) and I noticed that while we&#39;ve<br/>
been here (Louisiana) he&#39;s taken more to saying &quot;yes,<br/>
ma&#39;am/no ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;yes sir/no sir.&quot; What&#39;s<br/>
interesting, too, is that his family members (and at<br/>
times him, too) insist that John (son) uses &quot;yes<br/>
ma&#39;am&quot; etc. John isn&#39;t rude; he does say &quot;yes/no,<br/>
please, thank you&quot; but we&#39;ve never stressed the<br/>
&quot;ma&#39;am/sir&quot; part. (Heck, I don&#39;t use those terms.)<br/>
James and I were watching the Queens of Comedy the<br/>
other night, and one of the comedienne&#39;s mentioned<br/>
that when somebody tells you what and how you should<br/>
talk, it&#39;s all about control. That person is trying to<br/>
control you. Since then, James hasn&#39;t insisted John<br/>
use &quot;ma&#39;am/sir&quot; when he responds. Interesting, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you all so much for your insight and<br/>
words of wisdom. I&#39;m going to get the Video Game<br/>
Revolution DVD and watch it with the guys one evening.<br/>
Not going to say anthing &quot;lecturish&quot; or otherwise over<br/>
the top--just watch and enjoy. I&#39;ll continue acting<br/>
the &quot;buffer&quot; for now knowing that it won&#39;t be forever.<br/>
Sometimes I just get caught up in  the &quot;now&quot; and<br/>
forget (or are unable) to see the big picture. And<br/>
sometimes, it&#39;s the complete oppposite!<br/>
<br/>
Robyn, or anybody else who can help, how does one<br/>
offer one&#39;s husband info that testing itself<br/>
(including the &quot;pop&quot; quizzes) goes against the idea of<br/>
free learning *without* getting defensive? I find that<br/>
I tend to get defensive, as if James is somehow<br/>
questioning *my* relationship with learning. And I&#39;m<br/>
now realizing that my defensiveness can be part and<br/>
parcel of living with the inlaws, too. I don&#39;t believe<br/>
they&#39;re exactly thrilled with the idea that I<br/>
willingly left grad school when I was thisclose to<br/>
getting the PhD just b/c I realized (a long time<br/>
coming, though) that higher ed (even a PhD program),<br/>
including teaching and attending university, is the<br/>
antithesis of education and learning. I think they&#39;re<br/>
having a hard time trying to figure out where I&#39;m<br/>
coming from. At any rate, I find myself feeling<br/>
challenged when I talk to James about unschooling<br/>
*only* during or after he&#39;s quizzed John or asked me<br/>
what has John done &quot;for school&quot; that day. I&#39;ll check<br/>
out some links on Sandra&#39;s website re: testing, and<br/>
I&#39;m going to email James the links to the Unschooling<br/>
Dads groups. I think he could benefit from them--just<br/>
knowing that there are other unschooling dads out<br/>
there might help him.<br/>
<br/>
I guess b/c it&#39;s all relatively new to me--not the<br/>
idea of unschooling but our active practicing it--that<br/>
I may be having a hard time sharing it with my<br/>
husband. Did anybody else feel this way when you<br/>
started/realized you were unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for listening and offering your<br/>
encouragement! I hadn&#39;t realized how much I really<br/>
needed this venue.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One idea is to mention that you&#39;ve been wondering about the &quot;testing&quot; part<br/>
of free learning. Tell about some of your memories of testing (ie,<br/>
short-term memorizing for quick regurgitation, you tested well but didn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
I wish I had some links for you to peruse regarding the ineffectiveness of<br/>
testing because I have read a lot about it, and it may be useful for your<br/>
husband to &quot;stumble&quot; upon some writing about it (I love to put reading that<br/>
I want dh to read in the bathroom...it works every time) but I don&#39;t know<br/>
links offhand. Sandra&#39;s link <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tests">http://sandradodd.com/tests</a> probably won&#39;t help<br/>
your husband, but it certainly gives entertaining and fresh ideas about<br/>
testing.<br/>
