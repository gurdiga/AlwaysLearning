<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526256979">I  have a Canadian question, for purposes of clarity and Thinking  <br/>
Sticks.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t start off as a Canadian question, but it became one.  I  <br/>
have two orders today for Thinking Sticks, one from Australia and one  <br/>
from the U.K.  I&#39;m nearly out of Thinking Sticks and so needing to  <br/>
make some anyway, I figured I would localize (or localise, but that  <br/>
word&#39;s never on any sticks, so never  mind that...).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made Canadian versions, and U.K. versions, but to do an  <br/>
Australian version I wanted to put what they call what I call (as an  <br/>
American) &quot;holidays.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., if you get out of your house to go somewhere for a week  <br/>
or two, that&#39;s &quot;a vacation.&quot;  You might plan your vacation to  <br/>
coincide with a holiday, but it doesn&#39;t then become &quot;a holiday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So wanting to keep the idea of fixed (or variable) dates on which  <br/>
something special is commemorated or celebrated, for the U.K. it&#39;s  <br/>
bank holiday.  For Australia, I think it&#39;s public holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Canadians?<br/>
Do Canadians go on vacation or on holiday?<br/>
Do you call those special days that lots of businesses might be  <br/>
closed public holidays or plain-old &quot;holidays&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
And the American sticks usually have a &quot;basketball&quot; stick, but for  <br/>
U.K. I put football and for Canadian hockey.<br/>
Is football probably the thing to put for Australia too?  (A much- <br/>
hooked-up and popular sport that can be played by kids or adults or  <br/>
professionals.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing, but could be wrong, that New Zealand does as the U.K.   <br/>
Would football be their [started to write &quot;common...&quot; can&#39;t use  <br/>
common--] predominant/normal/familiar sport too?  Does New Zealand  <br/>
have something more distinctly theirs?  Are they a bunch of rugby or  <br/>
cricket players?<br/>
<br/>
(Neither sport nor sports is/are my common/major/regular/bank-or- <br/>
public field of knowledge.  Spelling and language, more, but  <br/>
still...   We say sports; others say sport in the same spot.  It  <br/>
seems Americans took the &quot;s&quot; off &quot;maths&quot; and stuck it on &quot;sport.&quot;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-588551486"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Canadians? <br/>
&gt; Do Canadians go on vacation or on holiday? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve called it both.  But we would say go &quot;on holidays&quot; instead of  &quot;on holiday.&quot;  We usually refer to a stretch of time as &quot;a vacation&quot; and say &quot;go on a vacation.&quot;  However, I&#39;m not allowing for regional differences.  I grew up in Ontario and B.C., so the terminology may vary elsewhere.  If I were speaking French, I would say &quot;en vacances&quot;, though that might be different from a native Quebecois speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you call those special days that lots of businesses might be <br/>
&gt; closed public holidays or plain-old &quot;holidays&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We used to call them &quot;stat holidays&quot; - short for &quot;statuatory holidays&quot; - but officially, they are now called &quot;public holidays.&quot;   And usually &quot;stat holidays&quot; meant bank and government offices were definitely closed and businesses might also be closed.  These are mostly national (country-wide) holidays, though apply to provincial/territorial holidays, too.   Sometimes, we call them &quot;provincial holidays&quot; when they are specific to a province or call them by what they commemorate (such as &quot;B.C. Day&quot; for when British Columbia became a province of Canada) or &quot;civic holiday.&quot;  Just about every province has a civic holiday on the first Monday in August.  In Quebec, June 24 is officially listed as &quot;National Day&quot;, but was always referred to as &quot;Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day.&quot;  Clear as mud? TMI? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And the American sticks usually have a &quot;basketball&quot; stick, but for <br/>
&gt; U.K. I put football and for Canadian hockey. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, did you know that basketball was invented by a Canadian who became a naturalized American citizen?  The link to wikipedia suggests he came up with the idea from a game he played in Canada called &quot;Duck on a Rock&quot;.  Never played it (or heard of it) myself &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

depending on where you live, rather than soccer) but same name. Or cricket.<br/>
