<div id="ygrps-yiv-344626042">WOW! I&#39;m gone for 1/2 the day and come home to a storm of activity here.<br/>
<br/>
Those that are newer to unschooling, or have younger children...<br/>
Can&#39;t you see that some people are just standing on the other side right now, <br/>
and offering the wisdom of years and experience on this? Not to put anyone <br/>
down, but if you&#39;re new to Unschooling and/or have very young children then <br/>
many of us have stood where you are...you have not stood where we are today.<br/>
That&#39;s not a bad thing or a put down. It&#39;s just true. And when someone is <br/>
standing on the other side of something, and I trust the person and their <br/>
advice, then I try to assimilate what they are telling me and not take <br/>
offense.<br/>
Sandra and Pam (and others) have been successfully UNSCHOOLING for a long <br/>
time, they can offer ways of applying this philosophy to other areas of life <br/>
outside of the &quot;educational&quot; realm.<br/>
It pays to at least think it through and not shun their words of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Someone wondered if the tv users could live without one, or if their children <br/>
would choose not to have one.<br/>
When there is a tv in your home, the children have total choice at any time <br/>
to be non tv viewers or tv viewers.<br/>
When there is not a tv in your home the children&#39;s choices have been limited <br/>
by YOU. And only you. Would you be comfortable letting them choose? If not, <br/>
why?<br/>
I have lived without one, my children prefer having one. <br/>
<br/>
I had a similar experience to Pam (I think it was you Pam??)<br/>
about a child that seemed to have a bad reaction to extended tv viewing.<br/>
After a heated debate like this (actually a series of them) I let go of my <br/>
control.<br/>
I talked with my son about the times he got aggressive after viewing and we <br/>
worked on ways of helping him be aware of it.<br/>
Turns out, any extended period of inactivity brings out the aggressive type <br/>
behavior, not just the tv, which I blamed solely for the problem!!<br/>
If he&#39;s cooped up in the house too long and can&#39;t get very physical, he gets <br/>
grumpy.<br/>
He NEEDS physical activity. But he&#39;s learned to recognize his own needs and <br/>
he knows how to deal with it with very little verbal prompting to remind him.<br/>
Taking away the tv would have not taught him any self control.<br/>
<br/>
The mom that is not allowing ANY tv at the expense of others,<br/>
the backlash WILL come, believe me.<br/>
Your child can not be hidden from real life forever.<br/>
You are not doing them any service by sheltering your ds from even knowing <br/>
what a tv is. I think the time with Grandma was more important than any <br/>
&quot;protection&quot; you offered him by hiding in the bedroom while renting a house <br/>
with her.<br/>
You are hurting his relationship with someone important in his life. THAT is <br/>
more damaging than anything he could see on tv. You are sending a huge <br/>
message that Grandma is WRONG and you are right.<br/>
Great if you want a self righteous child. And one that is confused about his <br/>
relationship and what&#39;s really important in life.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine taking control to that extent that you would hide him in the <br/>
bedroom during a family get together at the expense of his time with her.<br/>
That is in direct conflict to Unschooling ideas.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the crux of the frustration, to me, of all of these kinds of <br/>
discussions. They so often boil down to some people deciding to believe some <br/>
&quot;experts&quot; because, imo, they&#39;re afraid the experts just might be right and <br/>
they&#39;re afraid of ruining their kids and that it&#39;ll be all their fault <br/>
because they didn&#39;t listen to the experts. But here we are on an unschooling <br/>
list where we&#39;ve not only rejected the traditional educational experts, we&#39;ve <br/>
rejected most of the homeschooling experts, too. Guess we&#39;re just an arrogant <br/>
bunch.<br/>
<br/>
I also so often get the feeling that there is a certain amount of magical <br/>
wishful thinking in totally banning tv from kids. It sometimes sounds like a <br/>
sacrifice parents make that they hope will be rewarded with protection of <br/>
their kids from some sort of danger.<br/>
<br/>
As a mom, I understand the urge to protect our kids, of course. And I <br/>
certainly wish there was something magic that I could do to protect them - <br/>
something I could sacrifice that would make them safer in this world. <br/>
<br/>
But the arguments against tv don&#39;t ring true to me - based on my own <br/>
experience. (1)The argument that there is nothing good on tv - nothing of <br/>
value, for example. That is so obviously not true - we&#39;ve listed many things <br/>
of value and that&#39;s just a small sampling of the great stuff on tv. (2)The <br/>
argument that the commercials are bad for kids is often made - but there is a <br/>
LOT of noncommercial tv and we usually tape anything on commercial tv and zap <br/>
through the commercials anyway. (3)The argument that tv-watching is sedentary <br/>
and bad for the kids health is made. But I&#39;ve heard person after person point <br/>
out that the kids will NOT just sit and watch tv all day every day for years. <br/>
 They&#39;ll go out and play and be active, tv-watching is just a small part of <br/>
their lives. It isn&#39;t logical to argue that tv watching is too sedentary <br/>
unless you don&#39;t let them sit and read, either. (4)People have argued that it <br/>
is a passive activity - my first reaction is, so what? It is okay to be <br/>
passive sometimes. Second, it isn&#39;t all that passive for most of our <br/>
children. We&#39;ve talked about how they interact and dance and sing and most of <br/>
all they THINK while watching tv. <br/>
<br/>
So - there ya go -- like many people here, I reject the experts who say <br/>
things like a kid watching tv is in an almost coma-like state because I&#39;ve <br/>
seen my kids and other kids and it just is so obviously not true. I reject <br/>
the experts who say kids won&#39;t read because I&#39;ve seen my kids and it isn&#39;t <br/>
true. I reject those experts the same way I reject those experts who say kids <br/>
have to be taught in a systematic programmed way or they won&#39;t learn. Again, <br/>
I just look at my kids and it is so obviously untrue that it even  gives me <br/>
the confidence to doubt the experts in other areas. Our kids aren&#39;t just <br/>
&quot;average kids.&quot; Our kids aren&#39;t being &quot;schooled&quot; (at home or in a classroom) <br/>
and everything is different because of that. We ought to always question <br/>
whether any expert&#39;s advice applies to our kids.<br/>
