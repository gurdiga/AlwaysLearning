<div id="ygrps-yiv-663799634">I could use some advice on designing a space for my  5 year old daughter to<br/>
craft/paint, etc. Right now she is doing most of her projects outside or at<br/>
a small table at the bottom of our stairs. She has taken to doing some sort<br/>
of making every day, and with winter approaching, I thought I&#39;d try to<br/>
design a bigger indoor space for her. The small table just isn&#39;t big enough<br/>
for a lot of her projects, and I don&#39;t want her &quot;making&quot; to stop when winter<br/>
hits! Last winter she used the kitchen table, but then we had to move<br/>
everything to eat lunch, etc.so I&#39;d like create a bigger space elsewhere<br/>

We have an office/guest room near the family/toy room,  and this weekend we<br/>
will be removing the guest bed.  I am trying to figure out what sort of<br/>
table(s) I should buy. I have two other children (3 and baby), and I would<br/>
like to  buy things that they can grow into. Hubby wants to buy some actual<br/>
adjustable drafting tables, since they have depth to them. I was thinking of<br/>
just buying a giant rectangular table that will adjust and grow with them.<br/>
Since space shapes activity, I&#39;m just struggling with how best to approach<br/>
this. I was thinking that maybe we should buy one communal table and a few<br/>
drafting tables and just see what works best? We are also going to buy a few<br/>
computers sometime soon, so I will need a table/desks for those as well. Our<br/>
current space is limited, but we will be moving to a bigger house in the<br/>
near future, and I am hoping to have a main living room/ area where we can<br/>
make (hopefully a giant sunroom!) <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to all suggestions.  I just really want to create an environment<br/>
that will support their making activities.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879066215">I have a few ideas and others will surely have more.<br/>
<br/>
School-style kids&#39; tables sometimes have adjustable legs so they can be raised as years go by.  There&#39;s a school supply company that&#39;s honest and not as expensive as some others (that will only deal in purchase orders), so if you&#39;re in the US you might look here (for ideas, at least—if you can&#39;t afford the things you like, maybe you could be on the lookout for something similar, or used.<br/>

<br/>
Cardboard boxes like &quot;beer flats&quot; (the trays that come under a flat of canned sodas or beet) can make good storage for supplies and small projects, between times.<br/>
<br/>
Plastic trays made for bussing restaurant tables are stackable (empty, and in a way when they&#39;re full, if you go back and forth, some of them) and washable.<br/>
<br/>
In the Netherlands I saw a table from IKEA that had two &quot;gates&quot; so that it could open up into two sizes, or stay its folded up small size.  It had six drawers, that fit three on a sie under the table.   So it was small and potentially, quickly, large.<br/>

There are others, not as strong, clear plastic, available lots of places.</div>

<br/>
A few years back, we got 2 trapezoid-shaped tables with adjustable legs (that go from very, very short - like toddler-sized, all the way to a height that could accommodate an adult) via Freecycle.  A church nursery school was closing and clearing out their furniture, and rather than throwing it away they gave it all away.  The tables can be placed next to each other in various configurations to create a larger surface, or moved apart to be used as two separate surfaces.  Since the height can be easily adjusted, my son can sit or stand by them to play or create.<br/>
<br/>
At one point we also had an L-shaped IKEA desk table - it was enormous :-) and also had adjustable legs, and it easily held an entire lego village, a giant art project, etc.  It lined two whole walls of a small room, which was a lot of space for a table, but it was really nifty because it added a giant new surface to play and build on (and play under - my son loved setting up a fort underneath it!).  <br/>
<br/>
Around where we live, schools, small businesses, and childcare centers often offer older classroom and office furniture they don&#39;t need any more via Craiglist at a low cost, or Freecycle at no cost.  We&#39;ve had fun bringing different pieces of furniture (tables, computer desks, bookshelves, etc.) home over the years to try different set-ups or change around our room arrangements, and Freecycling it back away when we don&#39;t need it any more.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877927253">Drafting tables can double as easels!<br/>
<br/>
As interests change it would be nice to have a table or two to accommodate that.  Something that will hold a sewing machine or microscope or carburetor parts.  Our kitchen and dining room tables served us well. (We ate elsewhere) You can’t know what’s coming.  If she gets into welding or metal work, or car restoration she’ll need a garage! Get what you think will work well for now, and change when it doesn’t work anymore. Folding tables can be easily stored for a season or a decade until they’re needed again.<br/>

<br/>
AH RIGHT!  We own half a dozen folding tables.  I was glad when 4&#39; long tables became easily available, because before that we went through eight or ten 5&#39;-6&#39; tables, using them for picnics, parties, crafts, camping...  <br/>

 Holly and I have been moving things from two rooms into Marty&#39; old room to make space for her to have house shows.  She&#39;s having Amy Steinberg near the end of next month, and some punk bands next week.  <br/>
<br/>
Two rooms have temporary folding tables in there for storage.  It&#39;s great.  And if they stay there as flat surfaces, also fine.  And if they are folded and put back in the pile, no problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838433393">In our home, flat surfaces became more valuable than any other piece of<br/>
furniture.  It&#39;s more me who tends to spread out, but it&#39;s also friends<br/>
that come over and spontaneously want to create or experiment with things<br/>
who make use of the available (though not often stuff free) flat surfaces.<br/>
 In a 1000 square foot living space, we have one old found library table (I<br/>
love that thing!), a large oak dining table (seats 8) that rarely gets<br/>
eaten at, three desks, a piano bench that converts to another surface, and<br/>
open floor spaces with yoga/meditation cushions in case anyone wants to<br/>
work on the floor.  We had a coffee table that I made using old barn<br/>
boards, but we moved that out of our living space for a while, in favour of<br/>
more floor space.<br/>
<br/>
The other valuable spaces in our home are shelves.  We have 11 in our<br/>
living space, and several in our storage spaces.  I&#39;m partial to warm<br/>
colours, so I have picked up lots of natural baskets over the years.  They<br/>
sit on the open shelves.  Different things have lived in these baskets at<br/>
different times.  Some are catch-all baskets.  We have six ikea bookshelves<br/>
(with doors) that we added to our collection of shelves over time.  I like<br/>
the doors because it reduces the mounting dust, and they look a bit neater.<br/>
 They were fairly reasonably priced.  Two of them have been with Doug and I<br/>
since well before Ethan was born, so they seem to be relatively durable too.<br/>
<br/>
For my own work surfaces for making things, I have used fold up tables,<br/>
drafting tables, easels, the floor, dining tables, work benches, outdoor<br/>
tables, driveways, walls, etc.  I like to make things right in the middle<br/>
of all the action most of the time.  I like to leave it for a bit, live<br/>
with it a while, then put stuff away and move on to another space and<br/>
another project.  For me, the space is part of the art.  When I recall past<br/>
works, I also recall the spaces I have created them in.  So, maybe,<br/>
consider how you daughter likes to work in your plans.  Some people like<br/>
their own quiet space.  Some, like me, like to be in the center of things.<br/>
 It might change with time.  Most of all, have fun with it!!<br/>
<br/>
Karen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951765306">We have two tables with adjustable legs, both from Ikea (in the UK but I imagine a lot of their stuff is available internationally).<br/>
<br/>
One is a kids table, rectangular, melamine which is really hard wearing. The stools with it are also storage bins. <br/>
<br/>
The other I got years ago so I don&#39;t know if they still make it. You chose a table top then legs to go on it. You can adjust the legs so it is slanted, like a draught table, but it is bigger, like a  dinning table. Or you can have it flat.<br/>
<br/>
The blog &quot;play at home mom&quot; has lots of suggestions for setting up accessible work areas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476228702">When my daughter was a toddler, I would set her up with arts/crafts activities set right on the top of a large storage bin. She preferred to stand anyway, the level was good, the bin was easily wiped off, and it had a lip around the edge of the top. AND-bonus! It held supplies. :) A thought for your littles. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t stress yourself out. I had a large and fairly well organized craft cabinet, and then movers dumped everything into moving boxes. I was left them sitting next to the cabinet long enough that my 6 yo daughter found the jumble of stuff and that jumble was exactly the right thing for her. She loooves rummaging and finding different kinds of stuff to put together. She makes so much more now. Eventually I&#39;ll want the cardboard out of my dining room but for now it is the best! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198831635">One other option for some of your child&#39;s creativity (if it is painting and<br/>
drawing) is making a place on the wall with clips to put up giant pieces of<br/>
paper.  If there is a place with floor space, a big piece of plastic backed<br/>
canvas (or a felt backed vinyl tablecloth) with the projects laid out on it<br/>
are fun and portable.<br/>
<br/>
we would pick up the whole thing and drape it somewhere to dry and lay down<br/>
another one.  You could use the tablecloth idea on a table too.  A little<br/>
tape to hold the paper (if it is a paper project) on the table cloth and<br/>
then you can  use clothes pins or other clips to hang the table cloth up so<br/>
that the project can dry with a minimum of fuss.<br/>

If you are handy, or know someone who is, Ana White has some plans for building your own tables for less than half the price of these.  Here is one example:<br/>

<br/>
Or, I&#39;ve seen people get a couple of bookshelves and put a flat surface on top (if you have a Habitat for Humanity Re-Store, you can possibly find all of these things for discounted prices.  A lot of times all they need is a coat of paint.).  For our 7 year old daughter, we took the doors off of her closet (that she didn&#39;t use at all) and cut one of the doors down to fit into her deep closet.  Instant art spot!  She has some shelves above and some storage below as well.<br/>
