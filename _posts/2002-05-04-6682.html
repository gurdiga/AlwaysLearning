<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA!  Dana, that&#39;s what I told him, sorry son we&#39;ll have to cut your hair<br/>
because this nice lady can&#39;t tell who you are.   He just stuck his tongue<br/>
out. &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
About censoring his reading material, this isn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s been<br/>
told on.  Once, in Hastings while he was looking at H.P. Lovecraft a<br/>
woman asked did I know what those books were,  did I think they were good<br/>
for kids?   I told her my son thought they were very good!  &lt;g&gt;   Still<br/>
in the video store they ask &quot;does your mom allow you to watch this?&quot;    <br/>
Allow?<br/>

&gt; MOntanaunschoolers, too...I&#39;m trying to inspire people<br/>
&gt; to share day-to-day life &quot;learning&quot;, but no one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; taken the bait yet :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I took it!  And will continue.  We&#39;ll get some of &#39;em away from their<br/>
flash cards if it kills us!<br/>

&gt; you all day, like it did here?<br/>
&gt; Dana<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It snowed in Deer Lodge, but not in Butte, isn&#39;t that funny considering<br/>
the difference in elevation?  It was beautiful.  We went to one of the<br/>
cemeteries there looking for good stones to rub, took two rubbings, very<br/>
nice from Russian stones, from 1872.  Ate our lunch at the big park there<br/>
and Dylan got in on a game of soccer.  They were all adults, and I was<br/>
sure he&#39;d get creamed, but he survived, had fun and is talking about<br/>
joining a team this fall.   <br/>
They are rebuilding the historic Columbia Gardens, in Butte.  The carved<br/>
carousel horses are on display at the mall there.  They&#39;re so beautiful,<br/>
you can even go watch the guy as he works on them.  It&#39;s amazing.  When<br/>
you come through Butte in June on your way to the sustainability fair,<br/>
you should check it out.  <br/>

Reminds me of a small town I lived in when I was first<br/>
married....the town library had a book called<br/>
something like &quot;The teens&#39; book about AIDS&quot; ...someone<br/>
must have donated it, because obviously the librarian<br/>
(wasn&#39;t me) or the library board wouldn&#39;t have picked<br/>
it out.  Anyway, I wasn&#39;t there at the time, but I<br/>
heard later (from my SIL who worked there) that a boy<br/>
came in to check it out, maybe 12 years old, and the<br/>
librarian told him NO, he was not allowed to check<br/>
that out without his mother&#39;s permission, and why did<br/>
he want to know about that dirty stuff, anyway??  Some<br/>
people should just be beaten in the heads with sticks<br/>
to put us out of our misery!!<br/>

PS thanks for the Butte ideas...we&#39;ll have to stop<br/>
there! <br/>
