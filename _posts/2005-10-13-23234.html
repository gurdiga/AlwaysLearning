<div id="ygrps-yiv-981242538">My suggestion is a Paul Mitchell product called The Detangler.  I used to slather on tons of it in the shower, comb my dd&#39;s hair out, then rinse.  Her hair was easier to brush the next day, not just in the shower.  <br/>

&gt; Subject: dreadlocks ?????<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Question....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the facts:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -7 year old daughter<br/>
&gt; -likes her long hair (about 3/4 down back)<br/>
&gt; -does not want to comb hair (too hard)<br/>
&gt; -does not want us (mom and dad) to comb hair (hurts)<br/>
&gt; -does not want to wash hair<br/>
&gt; -has very curly, tangle-prone hair<br/>
&gt; -cannot wash hair on own, so mama washes once per week<br/>
&gt; -last night it took 50 minutes to comb out<br/>
&gt; -daughter upset at time spent to comb out and at pain (uggg, that sounds<br/>
&gt; sooo aweful...but both dad and I tried our hardest to be sooo gentle), but<br/>
&gt; -she does not want dread locks (we did consider this option of forgoing the<br/>
&gt; whole wash, comb thing...showed her a picture and she says, NO WAY!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks so much for any advise.<br/>
