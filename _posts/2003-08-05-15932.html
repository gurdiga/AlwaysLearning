<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450077223">My girls have a new favorite movie...Pippi Longstocking!  I&#39;ve been <br/>
half-watching it with them and what an awesome unschooling example. <br/>
 She&#39;s confident, unafraid, independent, giving, and states right in the <br/>
movie...&quot;What&#39;s school?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 I love it!  Tomorrow I&#39;m going to watch the whole thing so I can write <br/>
down some good quotes to have from it.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so <br/>
far...lyrics from song called &quot;What Shall I Do Today?&quot; :<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m standing on top of Mt. Killemenjaro<br/>
Watching the sun rise, the wind in my hair.<br/>
I&#39;m gonna go where ever I wanna go<br/>
There&#39;s magic everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I danced with the lions who roam the Serengetti<br/>
I met a tiger and played in his lair<br/>
When I get home<br/>
I&#39;m right where I wanna be<br/>
There&#39;s magic everywhere<br/>
<br/>
Watching the clouds roll by<br/>
Sailing the ocean and learning to fly<br/>
In the moonless sky<br/>
What shall I do today?<br/>
(What shall she do today?)<br/>
What shall I do today?<br/>
(What shall she do?)<br/>
<br/>
I make friends with a cobra<br/>
On the burning Sahara<br/>
Dance with a swami while everyone stares<br/>
I live where I wanna live and<br/>
I do what I wanna do<br/>
There&#39;s magic everywhere<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another great song called &quot;Recipe for Life&quot; that I&#39;ve got to get <br/>
all the lyrics from.  Do any of you know of a good online place to get <br/>
song lyrics.  It would be easier than trying to get them off the movie.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Children need order in their lives...especially if they can order it <br/>
themselves.&quot;<br/>
&quot;All you do is follow this recipe for life...life will never let you <br/>
down...there&#39;s really nothing to it&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I never saw the movie, but she was one of my favorite book characters when I<br/>
was a kid; I had &quot;Pippi in the South Seas,&quot; too.  Hey, she had a monkey and<br/>
a horse who lived on the porch, no parents, and never went to school!!  My<br/>
fantasy life....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509992830">One of my favorite quotes ever is a Pippi quote...I don&#39;t have the proper book in front of me, but it goes something like<br/>
&quot;There are lots of things in the world, and somebody&#39;s got to find them&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see if I  can&#39;t find the actual quote....<br/>

It&#39;s not a very good song for learning geography! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cobras are in India, mostly, and live in the forests.  <br/>
&quot;Swami&quot; is a Hindi word, too, I think.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;the Sahara&quot; is just the default exotic location for kid poetry. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do any of you know of a good online place to get <br/>

<br/>
Just go to google.com and put in a phrase that you think won&#39;t occur anywhere <br/>
but in that song.  Or put in Pippi Longstocking lyrics sahara<br/>
or some group of words like that.<br/>
