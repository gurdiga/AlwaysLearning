 </span></blockquote>Box of interesting diverted trash - I have a box under the kitchen  <br/>
sink that I toss bits of interesting plastic, caps, old phones,  <br/>
corks. Occasionally I empty it into a bigger box. It was a great  <br/>
resource for making things.<br/>
<br/>
Internet - pretty much a replacement for reference books which are  <br/>
quickly outdated.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to start over again, I&#39;d have way fewer books. I&#39;d buy the  <br/>
books Kat loved (from reading at the library and bookstores and so  <br/>
on) and way way fewer books that I thought would &quot;enrich her  <br/>
environment&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
While I see what you&#39;re trying to do, the list makes people focus too  <br/>
much on the environment as though if you just supply enough, you&#39;ll  <br/>
create an educated child. At least that was my focus when I first  <br/>
heard about unschooling and it made it harder for me to really get  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, unschooling is helped by a rich environment and lots of open  <br/>
doors, but it&#39;s helped most when the primary focus is on the child  <br/>
and the parents&#39; attitude. Playing a video game or watching a  <br/>
favorite cartoon on the couch (with a bowl to lick from the brownies  <br/>
baking) with a child beats a packed bookshelf. Approaching life with  <br/>
a &quot;Let&#39;s see how we can make that happen,&quot; attitude beats a stocked  <br/>
workshop. (A dad or mom who loves building things -- or can  <br/>
facilitate a child who shows a passion for it -- and says &quot;Sure!&quot;  <br/>
when kids ask to help or do something is the *first* and best item in  <br/>
a workshop. It can turn rocks into hammers when resources are short.)<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t Pam have a list of qualities that facilitate unschooling?<br/>

balls, for throwing, bouncing on (like a yoga ball)<br/>
independent or readily accesible (willing parent) acces to the outside<br/>
bike, skateboard, or other mode of movement/transit<br/>
we get a lot of use out of audio books, ipods/cd player, music<br/>
more art supplies: modeling clay, sculpey/fimo, scrap objects, glue, popsicle sticks, wikki sticks, pipe cleaners, etc.<br/>
craft supplies - sewing, knitting, whatever anyone might be into<br/>

<br/>
i so agree with this - which is why i added &quot;a willing adult&quot; to  my list addition.. in fact, in my experience, GOING to the store or other source of supplies, spontaneously, upon expression of interest, is one of the best parts of each new interest/exploration.  if i have to much around, it&#39;s not as intriguing  - it&#39;s a real balance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981956152">Great idea!<br/>
<br/>
Musical instruments - random assortments: small shakers, big piano, guitar, <br/>
anything in between<br/>
<br/>
CDs (or online streaming music is wonderful, too) -  we love having <br/>
international music in different languages; alllll types (metal to <br/>
classical) - kids get to pick whatever type they feel like listening to.<br/>
<br/>
Small trampolene, indoor swing (if possible), small indoor slide (for winter <br/>
is great! also makes great car ramp)<br/>
<br/>
Those are some things that first come to mind for me!<br/>
<br/>

for this blog.  It&#39;s a homeschooling blog, not an unschooling blog, as <br/>
I do in in conjunction with another homeschooling mom.    <br/>

I started thinking about it because dd (3) was asking about something <br/>
and I wished I had a globe to show her.  We have very little in the <br/>
house that&#39;s just &quot;on hand useful stuff.&quot;  We usually go out an buy <br/>
things that we need for specific projects, but even that is hard <br/>
because of a very limited income.  So, I was thinking about things I&#39;d <br/>
like to slowly accumulate so that we can use them more spontaniously.   <br/>
<br/>
But mostly, I wanted to post it for blog readers, most of whom are <br/>
structured homeschoolers.</div>
