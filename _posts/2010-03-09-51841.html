 </span></blockquote>Can you park the car close to where you&#39;ll be sitting and let him stay  <br/>
in the car, reading, coloring, playing a handheld video game or  <br/>
something else that he can do solitarily but away from home?  My son  <br/>
is introverted and my daughter is not. We used to all go to the park  <br/>
gatherings together but he would often find a tree to sit under and  <br/>
play his Gameboy (now it&#39;d be a DS) or read a book.  Sometimes, his  <br/>
friends would persuade him to come play with them but I always  <br/>
supported him hanging out by himself if that is what he needed.  He  <br/>
also sometimes just hung out in the car, nearby and I tried to keep  <br/>
our park visit to a minimal length of time, for his sake.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Take &quot;home&quot; with you as much as possible. Get an old suitcase and you <br/>
and he can pack it up with things to take when you go out. Books (not <br/>
too many - they&#39;re heavy), games, a blanket/pillow, dolls, toys, art <br/>
supplies, or whatever - let him come up with ideas. Wherever you go, set <br/>
him up with his own little home-base. Put &quot;his&quot; blanket down (for one of <br/>
my daughters, I used to even take a little cheap tent for her). Arrange <br/>
his stuff around him. Make a big effort to get this all set up so it is <br/>
later easy to do. Before you go out, when he is feeling reluctant, it <br/>
can help with the transition if he has a routine of checking his &quot;home <br/>
away from home&quot; supplies.<br/>
<br/>
And - get little things to add to his supplies. A rubick&#39;s cube, a lego <br/>
kit, etc. when you&#39;re out and about and happen to see something that is <br/>
small and portable and he might enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Also - hand-held game systems like a DS - are WONDERFUL for this kind of <br/>
thing. If you can afford it, a little portable DVD player can be awesome <br/>
because then you can collect movies and cartoons and stuff that he can <br/>
take with him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288867911">he doesn&#39;t just feel outvoted  - he IS being outvoted.  my son has been the same  - he&#39;s less so now, but was INTENSELY home focused at age 7, and 8, and 9 (and 4 and 5 and 6).   i would encourage you to not only bring home along and do all the things others recommended and you are already doing, but ALSO to do what *he* wants sometimes - not just if someone else is available.  let another family take your other kids to the park some times.  or keep everyone  home and do somethng together there - in the yard or on the stoop if you want sun.  i think it&#39;s really important that his voice and temperament are &quot;heard&quot; and honored and fed too.  not just &quot;if other arrangements can be made&quot; - as an actual sacrifice on your part - since he is truly sacrificing each time he is made to go out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point. And for you and the kids who wanted to go out, but are <br/>
giving that up, think of how to make staying home more appealing (just <br/>
like you&#39;re thinking of ways to make going out more appealing to your son).<br/>
<br/>
If you have a yard, fix it up to be a good hang-out place for you and <br/>
your kids, but also to invite over a couple of other moms and their <br/>
kids. Your son can be at home and have the choice whether or not to play <br/>
outdoors with other kids or hang out on his own in the house.<br/>
<br/>
We have a pool, so this was a good option for us - I&#39;d invite two other <br/>
moms with 4 or 5 kids, plus my three. It was a reasonable number - so it <br/>
wasn&#39;t like a huge pool party. They&#39;d bring their own picnic lunch and <br/>
we&#39;d stay outdoors the whole time. It was great for Roxana, my middle <br/>
daughter, who would hang out with the other kids a bit, and spend some <br/>
time on her own in the house - her choice.  I liked having two other <br/>
moms, not just one, because I could feel more free to go inside and hang <br/>
out a bit with Roxana, too.<br/>
