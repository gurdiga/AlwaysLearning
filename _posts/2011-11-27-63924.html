<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781331012">I know that a long road trip with young ones for us means lots of car<br/>
schooling--Books on Tape!! Especially the full cast kind.  The Golden<br/>
Compass was wonderful and engaging.  We all loved Junie B Jones, Cactus<br/>
Kapoor and the list goes on.  And of course lots of music that your son<br/>
likes.  There are lots of things available that can be downloaded for cheap<br/>
or free from the net.  We also played road games like I Spy and counting<br/>
license plates.<br/>
<br/>
My son particularly liked to know where we were going and to be able to see<br/>
a map.  We bought an atlas from Walmart that lists all of the Walmarts for<br/>
various areas.  This could be handy because they seem to allow camper<br/>
parking.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have a camper, just a regular van, so we made a stop every few<br/>
hours.  You might be able to plan your exercise stops so that you can see a<br/>
pretty overlook or something.  I am sure that there are multiple van travel<br/>
websites that has other tips or even lists of sites to see that you and<br/>
your son can pick through.<br/>
