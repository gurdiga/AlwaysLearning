<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962002317">Hello everyone, sorry about the previous post being blank, I hit something <br/>
and poof...<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend my little sister, 24, came for the weekend. She attends San <br/>
Diego State University and will graduate this December. She will then go on <br/>
to get her teaching credentials. She has always supported my decision to <br/>
homeschhol the twins, but this conversation was somewhat different.<br/>
<br/>
While driving to the local mall, Kass & Kree (11 yo) asked their aunt if, <br/>
when she has kids, will she make them go to school?  Uh-oh, she didn&#39;t give <br/>
them the response they wanted to hear and they let her know it.  She <br/>
explained that she would like to have her children in her own class and they <br/>
quickly reminded her that that would only happen for a year, what about the <br/>
rest of their &quot;school&quot; life. They were so shocked they immediately offered <br/>
that I along with themselves would take on her kids and we&#39;d unschool them <br/>
too. This to my sister who is neither married nor looking to have children <br/>
anytime soon. However, it is obviously something my children are already <br/>
concerned with. They like to do &quot;school&quot; stuff when she comes over, but they <br/>
quickly revert back to anything goes as soon as she leaves. She never <br/>
pressures them or quizes them but they like that she wants to teach, even <br/>
though they don&#39;t think she should send her own to school. They said,&quot;That <br/>
will get you a paycheck, Aunt Georgi, but we&#39;re talking about your kids <br/>
lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OMG, then it started getting really sticky. She tried to pull the <br/>
&quot;socialization&quot; tactic and they stopped her in her tracks. Which of course <br/>
had me roaring with laughter because they were battling with wit on their own <br/>
and that alone was closing their case. Then she went too far, she said she <br/>
&quot;never had a problem in school, she liked it and so there would be no reason <br/>
to not make her kids go.&quot; The mother bear in me came out and said &quot;we aren&#39;t <br/>
talking about problems...&quot; but before I could go further to remind her of the <br/>
problems she did have, the twins chimed in with &quot;if you never had the choice <br/>
to begin with Aunt Georgi, then maybe you don&#39;t recognize what you didn&#39;t <br/>
like because you still would have been stuck going.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With that, I said &quot;Touche&#39;, Kass & Kree&quot; and we all agreed we would drop the <br/>
subject at least for the time being. I did tell her I may have to send her <br/>
some Unschooling posts, especially from previous teachers. I have given her <br/>
my John Holt books to make sure she keeps those things in the back of her <br/>
mind, especially when the beuracracy of the System starts to bring her down.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, just felt like sharing, I am always amazed how well my children can <br/>
already debate.<br/>
<br/>
Take care everyone,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>

<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t even happen for a year!  Unless she&#39;s teaching music or art or <br/>
something without options, no counsellor or principal I&#39;ve ever known would <br/>
even think of putting a child in his own mother&#39;s class if there was another <br/>
option.<br/>

<br/>
She was just chatting and they were really providing information!!!<br/>

It was fun to read your account of it.  Thanks!<br/>
