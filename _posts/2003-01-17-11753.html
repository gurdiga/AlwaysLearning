<div id="ygrps-yiv-990388078">I really enjoy homeschooling the kids.  Today I was<br/>
cleaning out my purse and found some state quarters so<br/>
we got out the state quarter books to see which ones<br/>
we needed which led to me getting out the lincoln<br/>
penny book to see if we needed any of the pennies we<br/>
found, which led to me getting the bag of $2 bills, $1<br/>
coins, etc. out and found money from Scotland from<br/>
when my husband was stationed over there and I decided<br/>
that we should do sort of a unit study and get<br/>
currency from as many countries as we can and compare<br/>
to values to US currency.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel so blessed that we live in a time that this is<br/>
so widely accepted (with the exception of<br/>
closed-minded people like my in-laws and some of my<br/>
closer relatives who believe that all children should<br/>
be in &quot;school&quot;)  I feel even more blessed that we have<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; because my children fight me on anything<br/>
that resembles &quot;school&quot;.<br/>

This reminds me that I found a &quot;Where&#39;s George&quot; dollar bill the other day!<br/>
I was so excited, because I figure the odds are pretty small to ever see<br/>
one.  I&#39;m going to wait until Dan is home to actually register it, so I&#39;ll<br/>
let you know more later.  You can visit the Where&#39;s George website in the<br/>
meantime at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wheresgeorge.com">http://www.wheresgeorge.com</a><br/>

got one and and thought the whole thing was really cool, so we&#39;ve been<br/>
meaning to have a stamp made up and do that... <br/>
