It seems that in the UK  &quot;personal learning&quot; is equivalent to <br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
It also fits better with Ilich&#39;s &quot;deschooling.&quot;  But his was talking <br/>
about<br/>
deschooling society .   His &quot;learning freedom&quot; or &quot;convivial learning&quot; <br/>
was<br/>
more a model for how life should be conducted with friends and <br/>
colleagues<br/>
with joy and without compulsion.  We can&#39;t life free unless we are free<br/>
to learn.<br/>
