 </span></blockquote>Well I am not going either Kathy, and I am not<br/>
pregnant.  You have a much better reason I think. <br/>
Congratulations!  How wonderful!  How exciting!  How<br/>
Fun!  I hope the nausea passes quickly.  Bright<br/>
Blessings, Hope and Health to you and yours,<br/>
especially that one on the way.<br/>
