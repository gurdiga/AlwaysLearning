<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801220068">Hi, I am new to the group.  I am a hs mom of five.  We r very relaxed <br/>
in our hsing but I find that I can only take it for so long before I <br/>
say we need some structure.  I have always been a neat freak and many <br/>
would say control freak.  I have come a long way from those days but <br/>
still find I can not handle the complete chaos that my home becomes <br/>
after a few weeks of complete unschooling.  I can not get past this <br/>
point and then I am back to telling them to clean up what and where.  <br/>
I am fine w/ not &quot;doing school&quot; but not w/ a messy house day after <br/>
day.  I would love to hear from people who have gotten past this <br/>
stage or figured a way to have their children help out more w/ out <br/>
actually getting all over them.  They have asked me to make list, to <br/>
gentle remind them, assign days for things etc.  All to no avail.  I <br/>
find that when I work w/ them, I end up doing most of the work, <br/>
sometimes all of it.  I am not sure what I should do.  I want them to <br/>
see that I am fustrated by chaos/mess.   It does not seem to bother <br/>
them.  I really get crazy when we r getting ready 4 a class, of their <br/>
choosing, and they can not find what they need.  Should they then <br/>
just miss the class? Usually 4 of the 5 r in the class.  Their ages <br/>
range from 3 to 13.  Looking 4 any suggestions.<br/>
