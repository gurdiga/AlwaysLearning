<br/>
Well, I sure would be interested!!  I lived in Okinawa twice during my former <br/>
husband&#39;s military career.  Once for a year from 75-76 and then for over 3 <br/>
years - about 13 years ago (Trevor - now 13 was born there).  What a <br/>
magnificent place, and interesting people!!<br/>

<br/>
 Could I deal with water rationing?  Especially when all the &quot;natives&quot; had <br/>
storage tanks so they proceeded with life as normal.  Water became the FOCUS <br/>
of my life.<br/>
<br/>
How do I feel about being an American, where we are &quot;occupying&quot; another <br/>
country?<br/>
<br/>
Can I close my eyes - eat a single strawberry (which cost nealy $1.00)- and <br/>
feel like I am back in CA among my soulmates?<br/>
<br/>
If something goes wrong during my unattended homebirth, will I have the <br/>
strength to deal with the military examining all of my parenting practices?<br/>
<br/>
How many times will we have to go to the Embassy to get a visa for our <br/>
homebirthed son? - thank the Goddess he was white blond, so he didn&#39;t LOOK <br/>
like we bought him from Korea or the Phillipines!!<br/>
<br/>
And etc.<br/>

<br/>
Never the less - it was an educational experience to live there---<br/>
<br/>
I came home appreciating so many things here.  I had friend take a picture of <br/>
me in the produce section of the grocery store -- yummmmm<br/>

Cool stories!  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so fascinating what some people will call &quot;trivia&quot; and <br/>
&quot;extra-curricular&quot; and &quot;hobby&quot; when the drivel in school that&#39;s repeated and <br/>
repeated is so rarely useful or connected to anything in real life.   I seems <br/>
ALL kids mark the subject and the verb of sentences and learn the terminology <br/>
about predicate (or used to have to) in school, whether they had ANY special <br/>
interest in English or writing or grammar or not.  Grammar was treated as a <br/>
necessary life skill.  Meanwhile, home economics and health ed are marginal, <br/>
optional, or non-existant.  If you happened to know a lot about human <br/>
sexuality, that was a hobby, or a perversion, not &quot;academic.&quot;  If you were a <br/>
great seamstress and could design clothes, that was hobby.  Hush about it at <br/>
school, where kids are trying to memorize the major rivers and county seats <br/>
of places in their state (which might easily NOT be the state they&#39;ll live in <br/>
when they&#39;re grown), etc...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The military is just not supportive of anything outside the &quot;norm&quot; We were<br/>
told that if we didn&#39;t vaccinate our (then) 12 month old he would be denied<br/>
all medical care even in an emergency! <br/>
How does the Japanese gov handle homebirths? They are illegal here and I<br/>
can&#39;t get any midwife to even think about it. Goofy thing is until about<br/>
10-20 years ago almost all the babies here were born at home (often a<br/>
tent). Now the big push is we MUST have modern technology. You can see all<br/>
the changes that the west went thru in a century, going on in one decade.<br/>

just wait until the baby is crowning, then have<br/>
someone call for assistance, saying it was just so<br/>
fast.... the water broke and there the baby was!! As<br/>
long as there are none of the complications that so<br/>
worry the professionals.<br/>
