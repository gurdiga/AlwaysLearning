&lt;&lt; Kirby complained that <br/>
 there were NO role playing games for 64 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But what about Zelda? Trevor loves the Zelda RPG&#39;s. Is that the only RPG for <br/>
Nintendo?  He wants the XBox AND a PS2........We&#39;re destined to become a <br/>
technology rich family. <br/>

Kirby says it&#39;s an adventure game, not role playing, because the character of <br/>
Link can&#39;t be changed.  Role playing (sayeth Kirby) involves characters whose <br/>
attributes are variable.  &quot;You gain levels and experience,&quot; says Eric.    <br/>
Eric (a regular who is available, while Kirby is not) says Zelda is an <br/>
adventure game, and a puzzle game.<br/>
<br/>
The new game Kirby bought is for Gamecube, not 64.  It&#39;s Lost Kingdoms.<br/>
