<div id="ygrps-yiv-164539705">I&#39;ve been talking up  homeschooling and unschooling to a gal here in <br/>
scheduling . . . (whose son. .  .is four and is more interested in learning about <br/>
presidents than his colors in  school), and she&#39;s been talking it up to a friend <br/>
of hers.  They&#39;ve checked  out your website, and it apparently was <br/>
mind-altering!  [She] says her  friend is probably going to take her youngest out of <br/>
school.  <br/>
 <br/>
One of them is  probably going to write to you and ask about resources.  I <br/>
told [her]  that you&#39;d most likely send them a list of websites and a link to <br/>
some chat list  or something.  <br/>
 <br/>
OH!   And [the co-worker&#39;s friend] teaches autistic kids parttime, and  wants <br/>
to incorporate some of the stuff she read off your website.  <br/>
 <br/>
Cool,  eh?<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
p.s.  I haven&#39;t  heard the radio interview you sent me yet.  This week has <br/>
been crazy and I  haven&#39;t been on email much.  I wanted to wait until I had time <br/>
to properly  enjoy it. :-)<br/>
 <br/>
-------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Yeah, that IS cool,and I thought I&#39;d share  it with this group, and also the <br/>
link to the radio interview, which is edited so  tightly that not only does it <br/>
seem I never have to breathe, but sometimes I  start talking before I&#39;m <br/>
through talking.  I interrupt myself!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I was afraid it would be some difficult  download, but it turned out to be <br/>
very quick and easy.<br/>
Here&#39;s the link, and a note I sent to the  webpage announcement list:<br/>

I was interviewed for a radio show by unschoolers in Hamilton, in Ontario,  <br/>
&quot;Radio Free School.&quot;  I was asked to discuss strewing and spirituality, so  <br/>
those are the themes.  I used a couple of examples I&#39;ve used in other  talks, but <br/>
also said some things I&#39;d never said before, so I&#39;m happy with  it.  It&#39;s <br/>
edited down pretty tightly (half an hour from a 90 minute  interview), so it <br/>
sounds like I talk even faster than I really DO talk.   (Also I said &quot;civil war&quot; <br/>
when I had intended to say something else, but so it  goes... overall I think <br/>
it&#39;s good.)  There are musical interludes.  &lt;g&gt;  Either I forgot to say or it <br/>
was cut that the kids were offered  their jobs, and didn&#39;t apply for them.  (So <br/>
it&#39;s partly that they were  noticeably cool kids that got them the offer, I <br/>
suppose, and I wish I&#39;d said  that.)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I received from the interviewer/editor just today:<br/>

Dear Sandra,<br/>
the show has been uploaded so that you can listen to it when you get a  <br/>
chance.  It was very inspiring- I must say, quiet a few people have told me  they <br/>
were inspired too. I wonder if we could get in in the Life Learning  Magazine?  <br/>
Would you be interested?  I know you were open to me  including excerpts for <br/>
my book so.??<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Warmly<br/>

 <br/>
Why do people take or keep their children  out of school? Mostly for three <br/>
reasons; they think that raising their children  is their business, not the <br/>
government’s; they enjoy being with their children  and watching them and helping <br/>
them learn, and don’t want to give that up to  others; they want to keep them <br/>
from being hurt mentally, physically and  spiritually.  John Holt<br/>
