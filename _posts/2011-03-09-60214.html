<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792237544">This came through on my facebook today.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.momlifetoday.com/2011/02/how-to-ruin-your-kid-for-life-a-top-ten-list/">http://www.momlifetoday.com/2011/02/how-to-ruin-your-kid-for-life-a-top-ten-list/</a><br/>

&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.momlifetoday.com/2011/02/how-to-ruin-your-kid-for-life-a-top-ten-list/">http://www.momlifetoday.com/2011/02/how-to-ruin-your-kid-for-life-a-top-ten-list/</a>&gt;I<br/>
cannot believe the article.  I can&#39;t believe that people who love their<br/>
child would feel like this.  The article lists things that sound to me like<br/>
good parenting (however some of it is a bit extreme) but the list is<br/>
supposed to be &quot;things that will ruin your kids for life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Number three on the list is.   &quot;Place your child�s needs over that of your<br/>
spouse�s. If he cries, run to him immediately. If he interrupts, give him<br/>
your full attention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So placing your child&#39;s needs above your spouses, and responding to his<br/>
cries, will ruin him for life?  What?  I understand helping a child learn<br/>
not to interrupt, but that comes with time.<br/>
<br/>
Number four is, &quot;Entertain your child throughout the day. If she wants to<br/>
play tea, put your plans aside. If she wants to watch her favorite movie for<br/>
the 100th time, forget your idea for going for a walk and getting some<br/>
sunshine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How is that going to ruin my child for life?<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of other things on there that just tick me off.  I want to<br/>
comment on the article, but I wonder if it makes sense to.  I feel badly for<br/>
the kids of those parents.<br/>

<br/>
Combining those two is a danger.  One is not the other.<br/>
<br/>
Placing a child&#39;s needs above your spouses as a rule, as an &quot;always,&quot; in such a way that you have a policy of putting your spouse&#39;s needs second, can ruin EVERYbody&#39;s life.   It can keep you from unschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
So I can&#39;t in good conscience say yes OR no to your question. :-)<br/>
<br/>
As to the overall response to the overall article, it&#39;s a matter of perspective.  If that article shocks you, it shows how far you&#39;ve come from that sort of mainstream thought.   After another ten years or so, you might see it calmly, as a little speck on the horizon, that has nothing to do with what you know from your own experience.<br/>

 I know everything in the article could be bad if done always, but I think<br/>
it could be equally bad if done never.<br/>

parenting practices seem so unfair to me, so unfair to the children, so<br/>
unfair to the family relationships.<br/>
<br/>
I saw an article in Good Housekeeping that started with &quot;Adolescence is the<br/>
time in a person&#39;s life when a young mind opens . . . and the brains fall<br/>
out.&quot;  What?  I immediately wanted to rush to be the savior of teenagers<br/>
world wide.  How are people so hurtful towards the children they love.<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago that quote wouldn&#39;t have bothered me, I wouldn&#39;t have given it<br/>
a second though.  Right now however it just seems wrong on so many levels<br/>
and I feel like I have a responsibility to make it right.<br/>

<br/>
I think the best thing to do with articles of that nature is to put it into the <br/>
category of &quot;reaffirming my own views&quot; and leave it at that.  Lots of people <br/>
will read that article and completely agree with it and there is little any one <br/>
of us can do about it.  So, if you disagree, know why and do something different <br/>
and write about what you are doing different.  Make it positive and happy and <br/>
maybe people will read that and change their mind on something.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. I think it&#39;s great to feel that responsibility and to take it to<br/>
heart. In your own family. Where it makes a real difference.<br/>
<br/>
That stuff has always bothered me even when it didn&#39;t tick me off or<br/>
seem like the silliest of hyperboles but it&#39;s only in last few years<br/>
after having Karl that I could do anything about it. And that&#39;s a<br/>
great feeling.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I can brighten up the sad ones and befriend some of the<br/>
kids who are the target of that kind of parenting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I feel the same way and sometimes I still do get a flash of some kind of <br/>
combination of indignant and defensive and angry and sad when I run into <br/>
these types of comments or parents behaving meanly to their kids....but....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I feel like I have a responsibility to make it right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s problematic. You can, if you want, help a lot of people have <br/>
better lives. But you can&#39;t help people who aren&#39;t interested in <br/>
changing - if you try, you won&#39;t help them and you&#39;ll frustrate yourself <br/>
and detract from your own life and that of your family, especially if <br/>
you get all worked up over all the bad parenting that&#39;s out there. That <br/>
is a distraction from focusing on doing your OWN best. The very best <br/>
thing you can do is make sure your own family is happy. With that as <br/>
your base, you will, first and foremost, be a good example, and that&#39;s <br/>
really THE best way to make headway in changing in the world. Second, <br/>
you can keep learning and thinking and clarifying your own understanding <br/>
of unschooling and good parenting and then you&#39;ll be ready and able to <br/>
be clear and articulate when the opportunities do arise for you, when <br/>
people come TO you and want to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there is a certain amount of becoming more thick-skinned about <br/>
how we see other kids being treated, that needs to go along with being <br/>
more sensitive and kind to our own kids. That sounds kind of <br/>
meanspirited, written out in black and white like that, but I think it <br/>
is part of creating a cozy nest for our own family to blossom and giving <br/>
that a chance to create a ripple effect.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a few years, you&#39;ll get your chance ;) And in the meantime, you can extend thoughtfulness and courtesy to teens you meet. You can be one of the adults who treats teens as people. That&#39;s something that can matter in a bigger way than you&#39;ll ever know, too. One adult taking a young person seriously, in an atmosphere that&#39;s mostly dismissive can be a kind of existential lifeline. <br/>
