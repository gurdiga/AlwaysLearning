<br/>
&quot;I am nearly the age my mother was when I was born. And I have been looking<br/>
back at her choices, her experience as a parent. I have been looking at<br/>
myself and my sisters. Who we are, now, as shaped by the unconventional<br/>
approach to our education.<br/>
<br/>
I am writing this blog to ask the question: what is the difference is<br/>
between the first generation of homeschooling parents to bring the idea<br/>
into the mainstream, and the first generation of homeschooled and<br/>
unschooled adults to reach parenting age? In that space and time between<br/>
generations, what have we learned? How have we changed? What would I do<br/>
differently from my mom?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Photos, copies of journal pages her mom wrote starting in the late 80s, and<br/>
her comments are all pretty interesting.<br/>

I found this yesterday too, and it looks like a fantastic read. I started<br/>
reading it to my always unschooled 13 year old and he is loving it. It�s<br/>
helped him appreciate the journals and photos I�ve continued to keep over<br/>
the years and I love that he will have a picture of someone who�s never<br/>
been to school, just like him.<br/>
<br/>
I�m not too sure where the author of the blog stands with radical<br/>
unschooling but it will be interesting to here her journey unfold as it�s a<br/>
very new blog.<br/>
