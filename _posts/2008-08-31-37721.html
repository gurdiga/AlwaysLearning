<div id="ygrps-yiv-435063308">As some of you know my 3.5 year old has a broken leg and is in a full<br/>
leg cast.  I am also nursing a 7 week old.  Yesterday, my nine year<br/>
old came home from a friend/relatives house saying his foot was hurt.<br/>
 Throughout the afternoon, his injury slowly got worse until he<br/>
adjusted the little ones crutches for his own use.  Milo, with the<br/>
broken leg, got upset, because even though he doesn&#39;t use them often<br/>
they are his.  Skylar won&#39;t give them back.  His reasoning is that<br/>
Milo does not use them.  <br/>
<br/>
So, Skylar has been demanding almost all of our attention last night<br/>
and today.  He has had one major meltdown already.  These are few and<br/>
far between for him, but not abnormal.  He is a very level headed kid<br/>
most of the time, but something has creeped up for him.  He seems to<br/>
be opposing anything and everything.  He asks for help, then when its<br/>
given he refuses it.  He complains about how badly his foot hurts yet<br/>
refuses to see a doctor.  He has twice fallen down with the crutches.<br/>
 Once almost doing a face plant and actually hurting his other foot. <br/>
I suggested he rest his foot and watch a movie or play video games but<br/>
he insists on hobbling around the house while throwing himself upon<br/>
the furniture and all over the floor.  <br/>
<br/>
He is REALLY wound up right now.  I&#39;m trying to accommodate him<br/>
however we can.  We&#39;ve been getting him ice packs and listening to his<br/>
needs.  I&#39;m really frustrated with this.  Maybe more than I should be.<br/>
 We are really focusing on him since we know that he is probably<br/>
feeling a little left out attention wise.  We&#39;re driving him 2 hours<br/>
north to get a drum for the conference and getting him a new phone<br/>
today even though we originally said he would probably have to choose.<br/>
 I&#39;m running around getting him food and ice packs and whatever he<br/>
needs while the baby cries and while his brother waits for someone to<br/>
take him to the bathroom.  I&#39;m certain his injury isn&#39;t quite as bad<br/>
as he is letting on, but I do not want to say that and I do want to<br/>
imply that i don&#39;t believe him.  I totally believe his foot hurts.  He<br/>
jumped off a truck. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I need some internal dialogue.  I need some things to tell myself that<br/>
will help me stay patient with him.  Any ideas?</div>

<br/>
It *could* just be attention-seeking, but *we* cannot know that. When <br/>
we need attention, we *need* attention. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it *is* a serious injury, he will probably eventually decide to see <br/>
a doctor.<br/>
<br/>
But when he gets to the conference, it probably won&#39;t hurt quite as <br/>
much---either from time/healing OR from excitement/adrenaline.<br/>
<br/>
So this may not be an issue in a few days. (This too shall pass. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

like if they had a terminal illness and I knew my time with them was<br/>
limited.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731346322">I love that you&#39;re looking for internal dialogue! I wish I&#39;d realized <br/>
much earlier in my life how much my experience is created by my <br/>
internal dialogue...<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed, I try to remember that it&#39;s not <br/>
permanent. It&#39;s only been a day (or two, or a week, or a few short <br/>
years, depending on what I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed by.) More than <br/>
anything, it helps me to realize that the situation will change and my <br/>
feelings about it will change, and sooner rather than later. <br/>
<br/>
That I, at 43, can feel so jealous and unappreciated, so of course can <br/>
my child. And it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s natural, it&#39;s just a chance to practice <br/>
working with negative emotions.<br/>
<br/>
That I can sit with my child, and focus on breathing and being okay <br/>
with their feelings (which helps me learn to be okay with mine) while <br/>
they have their experience, and maybe that helps them understand how to <br/>
contain it, or let it pass through them, or however you might <br/>
conceptualize the flow of emotions. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s natural. It&#39;s okay to feel this way. It&#39;s temporary. It says <br/>
nothing about me/him to have these feelings. Thoughts and feelings are <br/>
impersonal, they move through us, they are not us.<br/>
<br/>
Dunno if any of that helps, but it&#39;s what gets me through the <br/>
reactivity sometimes! <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Sue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203976103">I remembered that &quot;this too shall pass&quot;.   I remembered that he needed<br/>
as much attention from me as anyone else.  My husband took him alone<br/>
to pick out his new phone.  I took him alone 2 hours away to get him<br/>
his new drum.  On the way I imagined myself stroking his hair (he<br/>
hates to be touched LOL)grateful for such a fabulous child.  I<br/>
remembered that he&#39;s a super cool kid and I really enjoy his company.    <br/>
<br/>
Then, I listened to him drum all the way home while I smiled.<br/>
<br/>
Mysteriously... his injury has almost disappeared.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminders.  <br/>
