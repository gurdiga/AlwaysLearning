<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151250643">There are a few problems in the world. :-)  One is that websites don&#39;t last forever.   It occurs to me to wonder sometimes what will happen to mine if I die.<br/>
<br/>
But at the moment, I&#39;ve just noticed this: <br/>
Future home of www.unschooling.com<br/>
www.unschooling.com/<br/>
An online library, resources, message boards, and networking opportunities sponsored by Home Education Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
What was there is gone.  There were articles and definitions.   Some of it was duplicated on my site, but not all.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have an article out there on a single site, maybe consider putting it in another place.  People delete sites.  People delete blogs.<br/>
<br/>
Several of my articles in French translations recently became available only to subscribers or registered site members (I don&#39;t know enough French to follow the trail), so I&#39;m moving them to my site.  I have most of them.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/french">http://sandradodd.com/french</a><br/>
I worked on that for a few hours yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Recently an online &quot;ezine&quot; went down, and I rescued things by Deb Lewis, Robyn Coburn, Schuyler Waynforth and Ben Lovejoy.<br/>

<br/>
The main reason we (Pam Sorooshian, Joyce Fetteroll and I) keep the Unschooling Discussion sites is for their archives.  The archives of the unschooling.info forum from years ago are gone.  I have a new forum, but no time to mess with it or maintain it.  Those forums attract bots and spam and it&#39;s a pain to clear out the morning&#39;s zombies every single day.<br/>
<br/>
Partly, I think I want to say, appreciate what&#39;s available. :-)  It might not be there forever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added 80 pages to my random page generator recently<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/random">http://sandradodd.com/random</a><br/>
<br/>
and if you&#39;re interested in being notified when there are new things on my site, subscribe here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There are some new videos and articles linked here--NOT on my site, but out on news sites (TV, radio, newspaper, magazine)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
And my favorite daily thing has a cool photo of Holly.  It&#39;s in Moving a Puddle, but it&#39;s in black and white there.<br/>

<br/>
There are many other online resources you can find with google and decide whether you like them.  I don&#39;t want to vouch for things outside of mine and Joyce&#39;s and Pam&#39;s, because frankly I don&#39;t trust some of the motives and angles of others.  Some are very political.  Some are woo-woo, out there metaphysically.  Some are just American.  I saw a site the other day that was just UK and US.  What about Canada!??     I want to promote things that are about learning, about families, not about nations or laws, and so I do.  And real-life things not imaginary channeled alien influences and other QUITE off topic poo.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the end of my link-rich rant for the season.   :-)<br/>
<br/>
OH!  One more link, a letter I got this week, and got permission to share it.<br/>

I learned of this a couple of months ago when I was looking for something from an old site of my own. . .I was amazed to find pictures I took from way back in 2002, that I had no other copies of! So neat!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293681947">-=-Try the Wayback Machine-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  That&#39;s how I&#39;m getting those French articles.   Wayback Machine is having maintenance this week, so not all servers are working all the time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun, though, and often if a link has gone bad, it&#39;s worth cutting and pasting the URL and going to archive.org and pasting it in.<br/>
<br/>
They have my main unschooling page, from 2000.  It was older than that, but that&#39;s their first archived copy:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000826220144/http://expage.com/RadicalUnschooling">http://web.archive.org/web/20000826220144/http://expage.com/RadicalUnschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
Some of the little graphics are gone.<br/>
That page would&#39;ve been called &quot;unschooling&quot; but someone had already used that at expage.com. so to this day, mine is called &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;  So it goes. :-)<br/>
