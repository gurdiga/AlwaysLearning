you every been so exhausted from stress from family that you almost<br/>
feel sick? I could slice the judgment of my son from my SIL with an<br/>

constantly corrected his speech. One time he was joking about doing<br/>
something funny to his friend and i joked with him,saying Yeah,we&#39;ll<br/>
lock him up and put banana&#39;s on him...or something like that,ya<br/>
know..just kidding around and she looked like....really? <br/>
My son asked for spanish rice which i gave him and SIL asked&quot;is that<br/>
good for you?&quot; omg..i am so tired. It is just the feeling of being<br/>
judged hard for over an hour. Oh..yeah..my son said: Damn it a few<br/>
times and she flinched. I hardly was talked too at all. It was like a<br/>
Lets go see if Lukas is normal visit. I am sure that some of have had<br/>
these kind of visits,I haven&#39;t seen them in years so i felt like i had<br/>
to do it.<br/>
I am from New york. Same place they come from. I have been here since<br/>
1990 and i have my accent(proudly) I don&#39;t however pronounce words<br/>

-=- It is just the feeling of being judgedhard for over an hour. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Were they only there for a little over an hour, or was there just one  <br/>
bad hour in there?<br/>
<br/>
-=-But boy,did she make those TH<br/>

<br/>
The first one you couldn&#39;t have helped.  The second one, I guess you  <br/>
figured she would stop, but the third and fourth?  At least you  <br/>
should&#39;ve talked to your brother and asked him to get her to stop  <br/>
playing teacher or whatever she thought she was doing (if you were  <br/>
afraid to talk to her directly).<br/>
<br/>
I think I would&#39;ve called my child away, out of the room a bit, and  <br/>
asked if it was bothering him, and maybe make a joke or two about the  <br/>
other person (who would&#39;ve been my brother in law Gerry, and still  <br/>
sometimes is, but my kids started zinging the heck out of him in the  <br/>
past few years, so he&#39;s more cautious), and then just laugh and smile  <br/>
at each other if she did it any more.  Maybe she would pick up on the  <br/>
fact that  you were both aware of and amused by her odd behavior.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i know she talking an ear full to my brother when they left. I  <br/>
needed to talk about it here.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you have them over even less for a few years?  Could you meet on  <br/>
neutral, interesting territory?  Children&#39;s museum or a restaurant  <br/>
maybe, instead of your house?  That always made a big difference for us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe i should have quizzed her daughter whenever she talked! -=-<br/>
<br/>
Probably not.  If you thought it was wrong and mean, less of it is  <br/>
better than more.  And less of it might be accomplished by you asking  <br/>
your brother to make it stop, or by not having them over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987749017">-=-You could always explain<br/>
to him that his aunt can&#39;t spell very well so she needed his help. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That wouldn&#39;t be an explanation, though.  It would be adding to the  <br/>
ricocheting negativity.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My kids complain that he isn&#39;t always fun to be around because of  <br/>
it. I  have told them that they can tell him,...-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could tell him.  If they complained to you that an adult was  <br/>
touching them inappropriately or that someone was threatening to hit  <br/>
them, you would say something yourself, probably, or keep them away.   <br/>
For some reason in this culture, math quizzes and spelling bees are  <br/>
not seen as abusive.  But in the context of a parent operating  <br/>
without the school system and its grade levels and quizzes, for  <br/>
people to try to pull them back onto that assembly line could be  <br/>
harmful and disruptive to unschooling.  If the kids really don&#39;t  <br/>
mind, that&#39;s one thing.  If they&#39;re complaining that someone isn&#39;t  <br/>
fun to be around, I think the parent should hear that complaint and  <br/>
consider acting directly by asking the adult to just make sandcastles  <br/>
without a math lesson.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some people may think you are making the wrong decisions about  <br/>
raising your children and you just need to do what you know is right.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When someone asks for help on this list, though, they want ideas.  If  <br/>
they knew what was right and could just do it, we&#39;d have no reason  <br/>
for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
The underlying questions involve boundaries.  Partly it depends on  <br/>
whose house a family is in.  What is fine at the in-laws&#39; house  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be the same thing that&#39;s fine in one&#39;s own unschooling  <br/>
home, but that&#39;s difficult for some people to understand.  There are  <br/>
territorial issues.  If I go to another house and they&#39;re spanking  <br/>
their kids or putting them in time out, my choices are to stay and  <br/>
suck up my aversion, or find a polite-ish way to leave.  There are  <br/>
other choices, but they&#39;d be really rude and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If  another family is visiting in MY home, on the other hand and they  <br/>
want to spank or put their kids in time out in MY house, then I have  <br/>
WAY more options.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have said in the past, and it may not be totally polite, &quot;Jayn&#39;s not a <br/>
performing monkey.&quot; Usually this is because someone will quiz her and she <br/>
will look at them with a &quot;you&#39;re weird&quot; expression as if she was thinking <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t *you* know?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the words, I think it is really worth it to say something along the <br/>
lines of &quot;Please don&#39;t quiz him&quot; especially if he is not having a good time. <br/>
A little sternness can go a long way.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the idea of defusing the seriousness of it with secret family in <br/>
jokes as Sandra suggested.<br/>
<br/>
As for feeling better, aside from writing here and getting fantastic <br/>
responses :) one way is to reconnect with your child doing something cool, <br/>
to remind yourself that he really is OK. And also let go of needing the <br/>
approval or validation of your SIL.<br/>
<br/>
If your relatives are no fun, then don&#39;t hang out with them.<br/>
<br/>
I want to ask whether your son enjoys spending time with his cousin.<br/>

Something else that&#39;s worked in good ways here is to play a game your  <br/>
child knows well and can teach and be the rules expert in, which the  <br/>
relatives will only be learning.  It will help an hour pass, they&#39;ll  <br/>
be impressed with your child, and they will be at a slight  <br/>

One thing that I think that helped my mother relax about my kids is because<br/>
we always play games together (mostly cards, but sometimes scrabble or<br/>
Beyond Balderdash, or dice, etc) she gets to see how they think.  They are<br/>
quick at learning new games and they are good at playing difficult card<br/>
games that can even be hard for some adults.<br/>

Holly and Marty played a game with younger kids some and adults some  <br/>
when we went to Thanksgiving with friends.  I think Pam Sorooshian  <br/>
has one too.  I ordered mine after seeing it at the HENA conference  <br/>
in Tempe last spring, and we&#39;ve played with it LOTS.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t require reading, and the &quot;game board&quot; is a bunch of little  <br/>
plastic dogs, very soft and nice (too small for babies to play with,  <br/>
probably) and some cards and easy rules.  I was thinking of ordering  <br/>
another set for a gift this Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
They have it in a package deal with three other smaller games.  I  <br/>
might do that and then give away the Walk the Dogs game...<br/>

<br/>
If there&#39;s someone on this list who sells Simply Fun stuff, I&#39;m  <br/>
willing to order it that way instead of online.  (I sold Discovery  <br/>
Toys long ago, when Marty was little, and we still have most of the  <br/>
things we got through that, because the stuff is really good.  This  <br/>
company seems similar, but more toward games.)<br/>

Tamzin did this with her English grandparents.<br/>
About a year and a half ago, she came back and told me she was irritated with all the quizzing and questions from them (they are both retired teachers, btw). We brainstormed about different approaches to take with them the next time she was there (she was 13 at the time and she goes by herself to visit them when she&#39;s over visiting her dad). I suggested teaching them something that she felt comfortable with, but that they might have limited or no knowledge of. I believe I got the idea from Sandra originally. She came up with the idea to teach them about photo editing on the computer (photoshop and using photobucket). They had a great time doing it and they were very impressed with her computer literacy and knowledge. Now when she goes to see them, she updates their &#39;lessons&#39; with anything new she&#39;s learned or she teaches them something else she&#39;s interested in. The quizzing has stopped and they have a new respect for her. I think they&#39;ve finally<br/>
 realized that she&#39;s an intelligent and engaged young woman!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043685988">Your concluding question was &quot;How do you make yourself feel better<br/>
after a visit like this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You should thank yourself for being wise enough to not employee such<br/>
&quot;limited-learning&quot; tactics as those which were exhibited by your SIL.<br/>
Perhaps you could offer a blessing or prayer or positive thought (in<br/>
your heart and mind)-- that the hearts and minds of your relatives may<br/>
become more supple and self-assured, as to be capable of accepting and<br/>
trusting of paths chosen which differ from theirs. <br/>
<br/>
Since many of the responses to your post were along the lines of what<br/>
could be done differently on your part -- in this scenario of the<br/>
past, or future similar situations -- I&#39;ll add my two cents there as well.<br/>
Communicate with your brother, and/or SIL, truthfully. The worst that<br/>
can happen is not sharing uncomfortable dinners. Express your respect<br/>
for his choice (traditional school) to educate and raise his child the<br/>
way he does, even though you do not personally think it is &quot;the best&quot;<br/>
option. Explain that you expect the same respect for yourself and your<br/>
child, though he may not think your choice (homeschool) is &quot;the best&quot;<br/>
option. Mention that you do not force your &quot;homeschooling&quot; methods on<br/>
to his child (though such a concept is of course ridiculous), and you<br/>
would prefer he not force his &quot;schooling&quot; methods (quiz-led<br/>
conversation) on to your child.<br/>
I have to admit that I have responded in a wide range of ways to<br/>
people quizzing my son. But I think that it is important also to<br/>
remember that many adults do not have very good communication skills,<br/>
especially when it comes to communication with children. Most people<br/>
ask kids what they are learning in school, and quiz them based on<br/>
facts that they (the adult) know. We have to remember that it can be<br/>
difficult for adults to learn new ways of interacting, which in turn<br/>
causes the adult to feel uncomfortable. And we should feel comfortable<br/>
educating adults --gently-- on our preference for real conversation,<br/>
not q&a&#39;s. I find that it is helpful to assume that people are unsure<br/>
of how the act/react towards my son. Even if, in truth, they are being<br/>
close-minded and judgmental it helps me to not respond defensively,<br/>
nor judgmentally. As long as my son isn&#39;t uncomfortable, there isn&#39;t a<br/>
real problem. Usually, the other adult is AS uncomfortable, or MORE<br/>
uncomfortable, then I am. My son is usually fine. I admit to steering<br/>
the conversation at times, though I&#39;m getting better about not doing<br/>
that as much now. For instance, when my mother (who is in favor of<br/>
homeschooling, actually) starts asking him questions &quot;quizzing&quot; (she<br/>
is a school teacher, so she gets in that mindset) on multiplication<br/>
(not his strong point) I toss in a comment about something fun he<br/>
learned recently. &quot;Ask Grandma about positive and negative integers.&quot;<br/>
Still math, but something that he enjoys. Plus, then he can show her<br/>
what he knows by asking her questions, and/or giving her math problems<br/>
to solve. I have to hold my tongue alot, because although I don&#39;t<br/>
really like the rapid-fire questioning approach, my son seems to like<br/>
the challenge, even when he doesn&#39;t know the answer. He doesn&#39;t mind<br/>
learning from people, and he doesn&#39;t mind saying he doesn&#39;t know. <br/>
As long as you are confident about what you are doing, other people<br/>
eventually will be, too. Granted, with some people it might take a<br/>
full 20 years before they realize that what you were doing with you<br/>
child turned out just fine.<br/>
Best wishes.<br/>

I think a word was left out up top.  Traditions about who has what  <br/>
rights in their own homes are falling by the wayside, which I think  <br/>
is unfortunate, but if she cares anything about dinner table  <br/>
etiquette, nobody leaves the table without asking to be excused by  <br/>
the host or hostess.  If she wants to use your dinner table for her  <br/>

<br/>
I think I would say to her (in writing) that her daughter was a guest  <br/>
in your home too, and you weren&#39;t comfortable with ANY of your  <br/>

Before my oldest started asking to be excused from the table,  I thought that <br/>
was just a &quot;social dialogue&quot; kind of thing, since every time  prior, each <br/>
&quot;May I be excused?&quot; was followed by some sort of affirmative answer.  <br/>
Unfortunately, my parents seem to require children (of any age) to sit at the  table <br/>
until every single person is done (including second and third helpings)  eating <br/>
and chatting. Basically, until an adult (preferably one of my parents) is  ready <br/>
to leave the table. Since part of their &quot;mealtime habits&quot; includes long  <br/>
periods of chatting afterward (as well as during), sometimes a child is expected  <br/>
to sit for over an hour on hard wooden chairs. We quit asking, but now I&#39;m  <br/>
feeling maybe there might have been some alternative we could have tried-any  <br/>

If it were my situation, I&#39;d talk to the parents about compromising  <br/>
on time and rules, or having different kinds of meals.  But it&#39;s  <br/>
still worth trying, sometimes, to make the kids more comfortable.   <br/>
Try to turn the conversations more toward them, and maybe get them  <br/>
something to sit on so the table isn&#39;t so  high and the chair isn&#39;t  <br/>
so uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve eaten with kids who didn&#39;t have a clue how to behave at a  <br/>
table.  Not everywhere is McDonald&#39;s.  But on the other hand,  <br/>
expecting kids to act like they&#39;re dining with the president (or  <br/>
local-head-of-state) when they&#39;re at a family dinner is  unreasonable  <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
It seems worth letting kids know that there are formal table  <br/>
traditions, and reminding parents that those have rarely included kids.<br/>

mentioned in my previous post. I feel like not having any further<br/>
communication with them...ever. Ignoring any future emails and such.<br/>
There was a homeschooling comment from my dad to my husband when i was<br/>
outside. My dad stated to my husband that Lukas needs to go to school<br/>
so he can be with other kids. My dad states this often no matter what<br/>
i say. I have told him him stop. He doesn&#39;t.It doesn&#39;t matter to my<br/>
father that Lukas hangs out with kids. I know exactly what my dad<br/>
means. My husband answered him with: we have discussed this before and<br/>
that&#39;s the way it is.<br/>
 I am happy he said that. My brother and his wife spent alot of their<br/>
visit and my parents house with my mom who probably expressed her<br/>
toxic,negative views of homeschooling and us with my SIL. <br/>

from now.  When SIL&#39;s child/ren are being sassy and rude to mom in front<br/>
of others, and your son is politely hanging out with everyone, the<br/>
comments may stop.<br/>
<br/>
Probably a lot of people just spent time with family and in-laws and all<br/>
kinds of different parenting styles, some meaner and some nicer, but<br/>
mostly traditional.  We did.<br/>
<br/>
I like my in-laws, not everything, but generally, they are all pretty<br/>
accepting of one another.  The hardest part for me was how they are with<br/>
their kids.  It was really interesting to watch all of them make their<br/>
lives so much harder by saying &quot;no&quot; about stuff that they could&#39;ve<br/>
easily said &quot;yes&quot; to.  &quot;I want cheetos.&quot;  &quot;no, you have to eat something<br/>
healthy first.&quot;  Hysteria insues.  It all could&#39;ve been avoided if they<br/>
would&#39;ve just given the kid some cheetos!  It was that way about<br/>
everything food related with each one of the kids and their parents.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the little ones started just circumventing their parents and<br/>
asking me while their parents were busy doing something else and<br/>
unaware.  Then suddenly there were happy kids, (sarcasm here...) wow<br/>
what a shocking surprise!  Kid asks for something and gets it with a<br/>
happy smile, or they ask for something and get told &quot;no&quot; and start to<br/>
cry and get upset.  It really surprises me sometimes that people don&#39;t<br/>
get that, it seems so obvious to me!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s control and manipulation and the older cousins try to do it to the<br/>
little ones, because it&#39;s learned behavior.  I said &quot;yes&quot; to everything<br/>
I could, and my younger daughter didn&#39;t throw any fits of rage the whole<br/>
2 and a half days we were there.  The only time she got upset at all was<br/>
when her girl cousin closest in age to her was being bossy and mean, and<br/>
it was obvious to everyone there, so everyone excused Margaux from her<br/>
upset and the other girl got &quot;in trouble&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The whole time we were there, my kids amazed me with their easy going<br/>
nature, trying to find positive solutions for win/win for everyone.  The<br/>
ones in elementary school were clearly out for themselves.  It happened<br/>
repeatedly, where the only solution they could find was a win only for<br/>
themselves, being countered by my kids coming up with solutions that<br/>
appeased everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW I wasn&#39;t the only one to see it happen.  If those dynamics<br/>
continue, they WILL have older kids that are bigger and meaner and<br/>
sneakier.  Mine aren&#39;t like that at all and it&#39;s really obvious!</div>

&gt; axe!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Next time, if there is one, spend most of your time with your son.  One<br/>
thing that helps me with in-laws, is that none of them are my best<br/>
friends, none of them are people I would hang out with and chum it up<br/>
with outside of family gatherings.  I&#39;m not seeking their approval.  I<br/>
used to get my feelings hurt by things they&#39;d say, but I just don&#39;t care<br/>
anymore what they think of me or my family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy with my family and what we&#39;re doing.  I like to hang out with<br/>
my kids more than I like to hang out with any one of them, so I do just<br/>
that.  Nobody can corner my kids or do weird manipulative stuff to them,<br/>
not even their cousins because I will know and call them on it.  In a<br/>
way, I&#39;ve changed the dynamic, where, they have to live up to MY<br/>
expectations of how people should behave.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know how to say that really, but the difference is that<br/>
the atmosphere stays happier, nicer, more friendly.  I did a lot of<br/>
intentional goodness for my kids and the other kids while we were with<br/>
our family over the holidays.  When I noticed a kid starting to go sad,<br/>
I&#39;d go give them a little happiness.  I think, in general, in family<br/>
gatherings, if there are happy kids, the parents are happier and nicer<br/>
too.  The parents don&#39;t want to go play and help all the kids get along,<br/>
they want to hang out and talk and watch TV and play games, and if they<br/>
can do that because all the kids are getting along, then everyone wins. <br/>
So this holiday, I spent a lot of time hanging out with the kids.  (and<br/>
it kind of inspired more of the same) which was cool.</div>

is to transform selfish, self-indulgent creatures into  responsible  <br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds sarcastic but it&#39;s true without parents realizing it.  <br/>
It&#39;s assumed children will think selfishly unless they&#39;re trained to  <br/>
think of others. It&#39;s assumed kids will choose everything that&#39;s bad  <br/>
for themselves unless they&#39;re made to do what&#39;s right long enough for  <br/>
their ability to tell themselves no kicks in.<br/>
<br/>
In the eyes of conventional parents what you&#39;re doing is making your  <br/>
child happy in the moment at (what they&#39;re certain is) the price of  <br/>
an adult who won&#39;t be able to resist the bad things in life. You&#39;re  <br/>
being weak because you can&#39;t say no. They&#39;re being strong because  <br/>
they&#39;re helping their children avoid getting addicted to things that  <br/>
are bad for them, and training them to resist those urges.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately it seems to work. Kids often do grow up to eat less  <br/>
junk and watch less TV. Often it&#39;s because their tastes change. They  <br/>
don&#39;t need the high calorie foods in their 20&#39;s. (What percentage of  <br/>
adults who were allowed to eat Cap&#39;n Crunch as kids still like it?  <br/>
Just the thought of it makes me gag as an adult ;-) So from the  <br/>
results it *seems* like the kids who would cram in the junk were  <br/>
trained properly to not eat it by parents who did the hard and right  <br/>
thing of saying no to them.<br/>
<br/>
Of course some grow up to grab as much as they can of the stuff that  <br/>
was controlled -- and often feel guilty and wrong about it even as  <br/>
they feel right about being able to choose without someone hovering  <br/>
over them.<br/>
<br/>
But, of course, unschoolers know from experience that the conclusions  <br/>
are false. We know that kids who can choose what to eat don&#39;t become  <br/>
slaves to &quot;junk&quot; food.<br/>

We were at a Thanksgiving of various friends and relatives of  <br/>
friends.  There was a girl around 12, and she was &quot;very well  <br/>
behaved&quot; (sullen and quiet).  I bet she was a very well behaved  <br/>
little child (unhappy, afraid).  Her mom seemed unhappy too--unhappy  <br/>
to be there, unhappy with her child (for no reason).<br/>
<br/>
Another adult (girlfriend of longtime friend of ours; she was  <br/>
probably late 40&#39;s) played a game that Holly and I were in on,  <br/>
sitting next to each other, having fun, and she told me after a while  <br/>

<br/>
That can come when people are brave enough and willing to say  <br/>
something like &quot;The kids didn&#39;t have very  much fun last time because  <br/>
people were quizzing them,&quot; or &quot;It&#39;s not a very kid-friendly house,  <br/>
so I think we&#39;ll wait another year or two to try again.&quot;   My brother- <br/>
in-law has asked to come and stay at our house sometimes. It&#39;s not to  <br/>
see us, it&#39;s to go to the balloon fiesta or something, which is fine  <br/>
and understandable, but because he totally COULD afford a motel but  <br/>
he&#39;s too cheap, I put a price on staying here too:  he has to be nice  <br/>
to my kids and not bug them.  He used to tease them and talk to them  <br/>
about their teacher (&quot;well sure you have a teacher--your mother&#39;s   <br/>
you teacher,&quot;  &quot;No she&#39;s not&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot;)     The older they got  <br/>
the more friendly and open they were, while his own kids (living with  <br/>
his separated wife in a state where he didn&#39;t live) got quieter and  <br/>
more avoidant as he said no, no, no to them about everything they  <br/>
asked and he kept telling them what they &quot;had to&quot; do and should do,  <br/>
and they had started ignoring him years before (or worse, listening  <br/>
to him and then doing the opposite), that he had no choice but to  <br/>
shush up his judgmental noise.  It did take years, though.  You don&#39;t  <br/>
have to keep submitting yourself for judgment every holiday.  Take  <br/>
your kids to Disneyland, France, a water park in a  nearby town, Las  <br/>
Vegas to ride carousels inside in the winter.  You don&#39;t have to  <br/>
report for interrogation at the relatives&#39; houses.<br/>

Sounds TERRIBLE with cheese.  Putting it in a tortilla might not be  <br/>
bad, but that doesn&#39;t make it a quesadilla.   (On the other hand, one  <br/>
of the best sandwiches EVER is peanut butter, cream cheese and honey,  <br/>

When Brett first moved in he ate a LOT of cereal, so we started  <br/>

stopped, but we kept picking it up at the same rate we had been, and  <br/>
now there&#39;s a surplus of cereal here.   I should start offering it to  <br/>
young people who come to visit, to take a bag or a box home.  The  <br/>
strawberry granola he was eating for a while can be ground up and put  <br/>

mostly sugary cereal growing up. I can&#39;t ever remember eating what <br/>
would be considered &quot;healthy&quot; cereal. No bran flakes, so shredded <br/>

whatever they wanted to whenever they wanted to prior to my decision <br/>
to do so a few months ago, I still wasn&#39;t very picky with what they <br/>
ate. So they had &quot;sweets&quot; after ever meal, often before meals, and any <br/>
time I had some. I would simply say &quot;I think you&#39;ve had enough&quot; <br/>
afterwards if they asked for more than I was comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
But when halloween came this year, it played out the same as every <br/>
year. I&#39;ve never told them to only eat a few pieces of candy, because <br/>
I figured the more they eat, the sooner it&#39;s gone and I don&#39;t have to <br/>
hear them ask, &quot;Can I have more?&quot; They had free access to their candy <br/>
and I would always answer &quot;yes&quot; when they asked for more. <br/>
<br/>
All three years (as long as we&#39;ve been getting candy) they&#39;ve dove in <br/>
and don&#39;t stop until the candy is gone. Which I don&#39;t mind, at all. <br/>
But I do know of people on this board or the food pages on Sandra&#39;s <br/>
site, or even friends off-line whose children eat lots of candy at <br/>
first, then stop and leave the rest to be forgotten eventually. Even <br/>
my friend who limits her children&#39;s sweets, once she gave in and said, <br/>
&quot;Just eat as much as you want!&quot; they ate a few pieces, and then <br/>
stopped.<br/>
<br/>
So far, my kids have not stopped as far as a whole day goes. In other <br/>
words, they&#39;ll eat 3, 5, 7 pieces, then stop for awhile, then hours <br/>
later do the same again.<br/>
<br/>
Are some children more likely to enjoy sugary things than others? Am I <br/>
still somehow giving off a vibe that they are picking up that might <br/>
cause them to hoard vs. just enjoy bit by bit?<br/>
<br/>
At Thanksgiving, my kids were the only ones not forced into eating the <br/>
foods on their plates or the selection offered. But they also were the <br/>
only ones eating more dessert than main dishes. And that&#39;s pretty <br/>
typical with them. Since I don&#39;t get to see other children who choose <br/>
their own food, I&#39;m wondering if this is normal fare for younger kids, <br/>
or if they are still on the journey (2 months in) of phasing out of <br/>
controlled eating. I guess I thought that since I hadn&#39;t been very <br/>
strict before, that it wouldn&#39;t be a huge change to their diet. And as <br/>
for the &quot;healthy&quot; foods, that part hasn&#39;t changed. They still eat <br/>
pretty much what they did before. It&#39;s just the sweets have increased <br/>
to probably about double. They don&#39;t eat it all day, and I&#39;m fine with <br/>
the amount of healthy food they DO get. I just still have that voice <br/>
in my mind saying, &quot;But look at all the candy they&#39;re eating!&quot; They <br/>
will eat other foods if offered, but then usually ask for the sweets <br/>
afterwards (&quot;Do you want grapes/banana/pear?&quot; &quot;YES!!!&quot; :eat: &quot;Can I <br/>
still have chocolate?&quot; &quot;Sure...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

though I ate it as a kid, but my kids both prefer Bran Flakes and <br/>
Cheerios over any other cereal they&#39;ve ever tried. (The babies I don&#39;t <br/>
know about yet as they still prefer breastmilk!)<br/>

Are some children more likely to enjoy sugary things than others? <br/>
<br/>
*****I have a child who enjoys sweet food.  He really always has.  He loves ice cream and cookies.  There are days he eats nothing but ice cream.  We have never limited food.  Actually we tried the typical eat what is on your plate thing once, and then Dh and I looked at each other and wondered how to enforce it.  So we never did it again.  <br/>
What I have noticed is he is starting to want more substantial food.  He just turned 6.  He still eats more sweets than anyone, but is starting to ask more often for macaroni and yogurt, etc.  I think he is hitting a growth spurt and needs more nutrition.  He has always been on the small side (40 lbs at 6 years) and I guess was able to get his needs met through sweets.  As his needs are increasing he is looking for more nutrionally dense foods.  He has not been sick in years.  He also is very visual, so he will only try what looks good.  Which means he only eats a few things and is not willing to try anything new.  <br/>
<br/>
Eli on the other hand is more likely to have a pear than ice cream and to refuse cake and ice cream at a party.  He just does not have a sweet tooth like Samuel.  I think they have had pretty much the same exposure to food, but have different preferences.  <br/>
Both boys are healthy and energetic.  Both are small for their age.  I try not to worry and just make sure they have easy access to all the foods they like.  Sweet and otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
After talking to other parents most kids seem to get more adventurous with trying new foods between 8 and 9.  That seems to be when snacks are no longer enough and they are looking for meals.  So we are continuing to get Samuel the items he is willing to eat now and are waiting for him to be ready to try new foods.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038089791">My older dd(14 next week)  isn&#39;t as much of a sweet eater as her sister or<br/>
I.  I think it really depends on the person.  Both kids would choose fresh<br/>
fruits over other sweets most of the time but we tend to have sweets in the<br/>
house more than good fruit because of the price.  I can bake a batch of<br/>
cookies for next to nothing.  Fruit is expensive.  We tend to buy what is in<br/>
season and lots of it during that time but in our neck of the woods, winter<br/>
lasts a long time and the fruits available for a decent price in the winter<br/>
aren&#39;t very good sometimes.  <br/>
