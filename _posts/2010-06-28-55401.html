<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120265651">It has to be one or the other, dichotomy or balance.<br/>
<br/>
Nah, that&#39;s not even true, either.  I was just using it as an example  <br/>
of extreme thinking, of dividing each thought into two.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been criticized about &quot;the happy bubbles of [my] followers.&quot;     <br/>
First, I don&#39;t have &quot;followers.&quot;  I do write, and some people read, so  <br/>
I suppose I have readers.  I am in discussions and sometimes I make a  <br/>
point someone else likes, but the same person might dislike another  <br/>
point.   I&#39;m not campaigning for votes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about me.    It&#39;s about the ideas, and how they can make  <br/>
lives better.  And by &quot;better&quot; I usually mean safer, more peaceful,  <br/>
calmer, more toward the learning end of life than the suffering end.   <br/>
More toward the optimistic end than the sky-is-falling, dark, cloudy  <br/>
side.  That&#39;s my personal preference, but I don&#39;t own the gate of the  <br/>
key to any of this stuff.  I see some people sad because they&#39;re sad,  <br/>
and sometimes I have ideas for ways they could be happier.  Sometimes  <br/>
they want those ideas and sometimes they don&#39;t.   Still, my own family  <br/>
is happy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think it is more important to be honest about our feelings than to  <br/>
create a false happy bubble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A statement like that lives in the assumption that the opposite of  <br/>
&quot;honest about our feelings&quot; is &quot;a false happy bubble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been honest about my feelings a lot.  And my family is happy.   <br/>
Not false happy, but real, honest happy.<br/>
There are expressions of my feelings I withhold or soften.  That&#39;s not  <br/>
dishonesty.  That&#39;s compassion and tact.   But I don&#39;t withhold  <br/>
everything I think, as some people do.  I don&#39;t mind objecting when  <br/>
someone is being so negative that it&#39;s affecting me or my family, or  <br/>
my house, or my car.  I do defend this list (and am sorry I&#39;ve had to  <br/>
defend it so much the past few days, from people who either can&#39;t or  <br/>
won&#39;t read and understand the guidelines).<br/>
<br/>
It would be possible for me, or me and a combination of others on this  <br/>
list to share stories from our families of origin, or from our friends  <br/>
or other relatives, or from our school days, and if we shared the  <br/>
worst, and the saddest, and painted them in phrases to milk the  <br/>
emotions of the readers of the list, and went into details...  It  <br/>
would be possible for us to induce a depressing, suicidal mood in the  <br/>
group. And many people here would repeat those stories to their  <br/>
partners, or friends, or children, and so the darkness would spread.   <br/>
Some people would be angry.  Some would be sad.  Some would feel  <br/>
empathy, and guilt for not having had so bad a life.  Some would want  <br/>
to volunteer at rape crisis centers or to adopt children or give all  <br/>
their money to orphanages.    There could be wailing and gnashing of  <br/>
teeth.<br/>
<br/>
BUT WAIT!<br/>
Let&#39;s don&#39;t.<br/>
I won&#39;t tell you the details of my sister being raped at 14, though I  <br/>
know them.  It&#39;s bad enough that it&#39;s in my head, and much of the  <br/>
follow-up and fallout.  She will be no better off if I put it in  <br/>
writing and make some of you cry.<br/>
Let&#39;s don&#39;t do any of that.<br/>
<br/>
The people on this list are here to discuss ways to have better lives  <br/>
with their children.  Not false happy bubbles.  Not even happy  <br/>
bubbles.  Life.  Real-in-the-real-world peaceful lives.<br/>
<br/>
Negativity is poison to unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269858185">As if happiness is LESS real than unhappiness. I think it&#39;s more that<br/>
people don&#39;t notice the drama in happiness the same way they feel the<br/>
drama in unhappiness. Neither is more (or less) real than the other.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t believe in love either. Doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t real.<br/>
I think it means that many who don&#39;t believe in love, haven&#39;t<br/>
recognized it&#39;s quiet presence because perhaps they&#39;re looking for<br/>
something flashier, so that hatred or indifference seems more common<br/>
in their experience. Doesn&#39;t mean that is or isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone&#39;s life is subjective that way. Feelings do matter and<br/>
thoughts influence them directly. So hearing people who say &quot;open your<br/>
eyes, look around you&quot; (there&#39;s a song that says that from the 70s)<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re hearing bad advice or that there&#39;s no such thing<br/>
as what they see... love or happiness.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites, that I highly recommend, is Chicago&#39;s Saturday in<br/>
the Park. Give it a listen if you like.<br/>
