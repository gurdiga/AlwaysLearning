<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061898236">Well it&#39;s not purple it&#39;s pink.  But my dd now has several pink yarny braids <br/>
in her hair.  She&#39;s liking them.  Well, Ok she&#39;s asleep right now, but she <br/>
did like them breifly before she fell asleep..<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not perfect.  It&#39;s a skill in progress on my part but it&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, does it work with embroydery floss?  Well I mean I know it WOULD <br/>
work but have you ever tried it?  it would give it a bit more shine.  I <br/>
might have to try that tomorrow.  Oooo or maybe ribbons!<br/>
<br/>
I have two in my own hair as well.  I used just one piece of string and two <br/>
strands of hair.  Attached it using your method and braided it.  They came <br/>
out pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
I also spent a good couple hours in the middle of a patch of clover flowers <br/>
this afternoon braiding a flower garland.  I&#39;ve always wondered how they did <br/>
it.  And after reading a book about a greek myth (Chloe and Daphnaes) in <br/>
which they repeatedly braided flower garlands I had to figure out how it was <br/>
done.  So with much trial and error and a little bit of thought on the <br/>
matter I figured out how to do it.  Or at least *a* way to do it.  It&#39;s fun. <br/>
  And it&#39;s surprisingly a lot like the yarn braids Sandra explained.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Well there&#39;s MY unschooling moment that took place while my kids played <br/>
endlessly on the swingset.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep it works with almost anything. Kass & Kree have primarily dark brown <br/>
hair, that naturally lightens to blond streaks during summer. They love when that <br/>
happens because then when they so their yearly braids, The whole head of deal, <br/>
that look cool because of all the colors. They have had people walk up to <br/>
them and just about stick their noses right next to their heads to see why there <br/>
is so many colors. From that we discovered, during the times when their hair <br/>
is darker, when they want that look with out actually putting chemicals on <br/>
their hair we use different shades of embrodery floss. All the colors similar to <br/>
their haris when it sreaks. It has been way cool and at least when they get <br/>
tired of it, you just take out the braids. They just asked for red white and blue <br/>
to be weaved in if my hands work well enough to braid by 4 th of July.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, thay are tons of fun.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Oh I forgot to mention the use of cord and ribbon. Both work eqully well <br/>
and with some of those gold and silver cords, it can be very vibrant on those <br/>
with dark hair.<br/>

read:<br/>

<br/>
Rhonda - obviously not planning on braiding with these fingers today.<br/>

(They&#39;re expensive, too, relatively.  After Christmas crafts stores sometimes <br/>
sell the little cardboard ribbon-spools half price, so you can get the gold <br/>
ribbon sometimes cheap, and for SCA Twelfth Night feasts that&#39;s been good, or for <br/>
fixing people up for something formal.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some yarn with metallic thread in it (not really metallic, I&#39;m <br/>
thinking, but gold- or silver-looking threads that are really plastic).  Some yarn <br/>
is shinier than some embroidery stuff.  There&#39;s the chenille yarn too, which is <br/>
kinda fuzzy.<br/>

they do at Disney and Universal etc.  My boys like to add different beads on <br/>
the end.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029124033">The fake hair was extremely cheap.  Lexie needed to packages and they <br/>
were about $2.50 each package.  Janene needed 1 1/2 packages.  That&#39;s <br/>
cheaper than yarn, I&#39;d think....  It look stotally cool.<br/>
