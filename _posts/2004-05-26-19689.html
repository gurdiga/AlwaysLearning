Three is too young, and I was wrong in my original advice because of details, but I think too many people behave as though totally avoiding a known molester makes them magically safe from unidentified molesters.

By &quot;Depends on the adult and the child&quot; I mean a child who has been told always to do what adults tell him and who doesn&#39;t even have vocabulary to discuss his own sexuality or body parts is at a HUGE disadvantage compared to a child who is naturally brave, has good interpersonal skills/intelligence/awareness, who isn&#39;t afraid of saying &quot;What are you doing!?&quot; or &quot;STOP IT&quot;  to an adult instead of letting things proceed.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255483727">Sandra, sorry to have to respond again, however, you are <br/>
obviously not aware that sexual abuse is not about sex, it is a <br/>
power issue and one of lack of boundaries.  Ninety year olds <br/>
have still been know to abuse children.  It has nothing to do with <br/>
sexual desire, it has to do with a power over someone else, and <br/>
a lack of being able to distinguish the other person as seperate <br/>
from themselves on an emotional level.<br/>

an adult instead of letting things proceed.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Putting a child with a known sex offender is dangerous period.  <br/>
Teaching a child empowerment is of course  a very necessary <br/>
thing, however, this is no guarantee against abuse.  An adult can <br/>
quickly slip a finger into the wrong place while he/she is cuddling <br/>
with a child, there is no asking first, it is over and done, and the <br/>
child is left too shocked or confused to know how to respond.  <br/>
Even if a child is able to say &quot;no&quot; it has still happened.  Do you <br/>
really want parents to take this chance with people who are <br/>
known to violate children in this way?  Of course protecting kids <br/>
from known sex offenders is not a guarantee that they won&#39;t be <br/>
abused by others.  But I disagree that it provides a false sense of <br/>
security.  As a parent I trust my radar.  I have a basic trust in <br/>
people, however I do   look for clues as to whether someone has <br/>
good boudaries in general.  Do they respect my limits around <br/>
other matters?  Are they able to acknowledge my feelings and <br/>
needs as seperate from their own?  Have they been abused in <br/>
the past, and if so have they done their own recovery work?  If any <br/>
of these or other indicators are questionable then i will certainly <br/>
not leave my child alone with them.  I don&#39;t care if i am right or <br/>
wrong, I want the best care for my child, and i will not take <br/>
unnecessary chances when it comes to their care.<br/>
<br/>
And no, someone does not get a second chance unless they <br/>
have demonstrated a high level of personal growth, healing and <br/>
ability to freely take responsibility for their past transgressions.  <br/>
THis is far too important an issue to do the &quot;nice&quot; thing, to put the <br/>
perpertrators needs before the child&#39;s needs of safety.  To do so <br/>
would be repeating the abusive relationship, denying that the <br/>
child&#39;s needs in this situation need to take priority over an adult.  <br/>
Sandra I really suggest that you read some material on this, as <br/>
owner of this group, and as an educator of parents about <br/>
children this is one topic that deserves to be fully understood <br/>
and not diminished in importance by wishful thinking.</div>

is not such a big leap to conclude this if you truly believe that all a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924394951">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; True except the time that makes them too old and feeble to function or<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but since pedophiles often do not utilize an erection this can be very,<br/>
very old.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do people never get other chances?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my book, pedophiles do not.  The recidivism rate is way, way too high and<br/>
this is just on people who got caught a second time.  Even people who are<br/>
chemically castrated still have difficulty with fantasy about children.<br/>
<br/>
If pedophilia were just about sexuality, I might hold more hope.  But it has<br/>
to do with emotional age, not feeling capable in adult relationships, etc..<br/>
It is an extremely complicated thing.  I have known pedophiles through<br/>
various avenues that I have genuinely liked.....I don&#39;t let them near my<br/>
kids.<br/>

<br/>
power issue and one of lack of boundaries.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OBVIOUSLY?<br/>
<br/>
Prepare children to stand up to power issues and to have boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you want to say some people are natural victims, let us assume that <br/>
every child can be helped to know what his rights are and to defend them in <br/>
everyday circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Teaching a child empowerment is of course  a very necessary <br/>

<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
We can all live in constant fear and hiding.<br/>
We could all drink poison kool-aid and not worry about it anymore.<br/>
We could realize things can happen and still live our lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=- As a parent I trust my radar. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Fine.  Some people&#39;s radar is set to go off if anyone looks at them.  Some <br/>
have no radar at all.  I would hope that discussions like this have to do with <br/>
rational and logical ways to consider what to do when radar isn&#39;t enough, or <br/>
when the parents aren&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And no, someone does not get a second chance unless they <br/>
<br/>
have demonstrated a high level of personal growth, healing and <br/>
<br/>
ability to freely take responsibility for their past transgressions. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I have no objection to that if it&#39;s clearly that.  I have an objection to <br/>
people judging others forever and irrevocably, and it doesn&#39;t seem you&#39;re doing <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-THis is far too important an issue to do the &quot;nice&quot; thing, to put the <br/>
<br/>
perpertrators needs before the child&#39;s needs of safety.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My original recommendation was wrong.  I took it back.  This is the third <br/>
time I&#39;ve said so.  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t worried about &quot;the perpetrator&#39;s needs.&quot;  I was thinking of a child <br/>
who wanted to be there and who MIGHT could be prepared to be there safely.   <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of the child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sandra I really suggest that you read some material on this, as <br/>
<br/>
owner of this group, and as an educator of parents about <br/>
<br/>
children this is one topic that deserves to be fully understood <br/>
<br/>
and not diminished in importance by wishful thinking.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And I think you should back down a little because you&#39;re really pissing me <br/>
off with the stridency of your accusations that I basically don&#39;t know diddly <br/>
shit.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was raped by her brother.  He died within a year or two after, and <br/>
she never told her parents about the rape because he was missed and glorified <br/>
as the best of their children.<br/>
My sister was raped at knifepoint in an arroyo by two men who had raped <br/>
others, in front of a younger male friend  (not boyfriend) when she was 14.<br/>
My sister in law was frightened (verbally not full touch) when she was <br/>
staying with an uncle in Hawaii and couldn&#39;t get away.   She was 12.  (She stood up f<br/>
or herself and avoided being alone with him thereafter, and warned others.)<br/>
My sister was insulted/propositioned by an uncle when she was 15 and in <br/>
Alaska and couldn&#39;t get away.  (She stood up for herself and avoided being alone <br/>
with him thereafter, and warned others.)<br/>
I have other stories not so close, and most of the women I know were molested <br/>
one way or another, several by their own fathers.  I have some male friends <br/>
who have admitted molestation to me, two by teenaged female babysitters.<br/>
<br/>
Are there other lists which would be better for this discussion?  Because <br/>
other than helping children know that they don&#39;t have to be where they don&#39;t want <br/>
to be, it&#39;s not an unschooling issue.    <br/>
<br/>
If a parent doesn&#39;t want to confront a parent who acted inappropriately in <br/>
ANY way, maybe that parent is right in just keeping the kids in arm&#39;s length, <br/>
but that is about the parent more than about the child.  There are children of <br/>
retiring, quiet mothers who are not themselves as retiring and quiet and <br/>
fearful.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was molested as a baby, by a five year old boy.  Should I have <br/>
forbidden my children to play with other children?  Should I have avoided La Leche <br/>
League because that&#39;s where I met the family?  It seems his neighbor and perhaps <br/>
his mother was molesting him.  His mother had been molested by her own father. <br/>
 I was sad to cut off from that family, but I did.  He had been Kirby&#39;s best <br/>
friend for a couple of years, and it was sad because the boy wasn&#39;t evil spawn <br/>
of Satan.  He was himself an abused boy.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re not going to do some mass executions or suicides, we need to live in <br/>
the world as it is, and we do NOT always know who &quot;the bad guys&quot; are.<br/>

Then keep your children away from adults.  <br/>
There&#39;s a first time for everything.  Someone who&#39;s not YET a molester might <br/>
start with your child.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep them away from teenagers, too.  And other children.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you were abused yourself, that puts you at risk to be an abuser.  <br/>
