<div id="ygrps-yiv-297468245">Just wanted to give the heads up that this is a Conference Weekend. Which<br/>
might not mean anything, or it can mean that traffic will be slow and<br/>
response time may be long :D<br/>
I&#39;ll be tweeting (twitter.com) from the conference & I&#39;ll have lots of<br/>
stories upon my return!<br/>
If you need me, I&#39;m available on my cell/text: 605.201.9863 :D<br/>
I&#39;ll be no mail til Tuesday. If you&#39;re at LIFE is Good this weekend, be sure<br/>
and find me!<br/>

we have a really good time without you all.<br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ve noticed that weekends are very slow on the unschooling <br/>
lists, anyway, so it won&#39;t be that unusual.<br/>
