&quot;There are many tribes of thought in the world of reading. Some are still at<br/>
&#39;war.&#39;  In the final analysis, we must all learn together to steward the<br/>
health of our children&#39;s learning.  If we can agree to come from that<br/>
ground, from a concern with the ecology and health of our children&#39;s<br/>
learning, we can engage in a deeper dialogue than the polarizing systems of<br/>
thought about reading have allowed for.  If you have something to say,<br/>
please share your wisdom and passion. Click here to, speak up, share, and<br/>
contribute to our dialogue and effort. We want to collaborate with you. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
Anyone feel like contributing the unschooling views on this?  Maybe it would<br/>
show up on the documentary..looks like they are aiming for Sept. &#39;04 to air.<br/>
<br/>
Whatchya think?<br/>

&gt; Wow again.<br/>

&gt; Was that already on TV, anyone know?<br/>

&gt; A quote from the page:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=- Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; process of learning to read teaches these children to feel ashamed of<br/>
&gt; themselves--ashamed of their minds--ashamed of how they learn.-=<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know what his recommendations are going to be (or were) but I<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll link it to my reading page, which is (for newer readers who aren&#39;t<br/>
tired<br/>
&gt; of me saying so yet &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Ah, a challenge!  OK, here is the email I sent to them:<br/>
<br/>
Most reading *disabilities* would disappear if our schools waited to teach reading.  Many children are simply not ready to break the code until much later than our educational system would have us believe.  By then, the damage has been done.  These late-reading children have come to think of themselves as defective and learning disabled.<br/>
<br/>
Only within the schools is there any legitimate reason for children to have mastered independent reading.  It is only within our school system that an 8 or 12 year old not-yet-reader is a &quot;problem&quot;.  Young children are wired to learn through hands-on experience, not via books and worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
When children are read to, with pleasure, and spend time around others who read for pleasure and/or information, they will learn to read by the time they are young adults and truly have need to be independent readers.<br/>
