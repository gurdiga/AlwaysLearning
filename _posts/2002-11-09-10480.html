<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105822923">OK, This is what I got in the mail today...<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t Mess with Mothers.... <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; My son came home from school one day, <br/>
&gt; with a smirk upon his face. <br/>
&gt; He decided he was smart enough <br/>
 </span></blockquote>    to put me in my place. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Guess what I learned in Civics Two, <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s taught by Mr. Wright? <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s all about the laws today, <br/>
&gt; The &quot;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights.&quot; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It says I need not clean my room, <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to cut my hair. <br/>
&gt; No one can tell me what to think, <br/>
&gt; or speak, or what to wear. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have freedom from religion, <br/>
&gt; and regardless what you say, <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have to bow my head, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and I sure don&#39;t have to pray. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can wear earrings if I want, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and pierce my tongue & nose. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can read & watch just what I like, <br/>
&gt; get tattoos from head to toe. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; And if you ever spank me, <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll charge you with a crime. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll back up all my charges, <br/>
&gt; with the marks on my behind. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t you ever touch me, <br/>
&gt; my body&#39;s only for my use, <br/>
&gt; not for your hugs and kissess, <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s just more child abuse. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Don&#39;t preach about your morals, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like your Mama did to you. <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s nothing more than mind control, <br/>
&gt; And it&#39;s illegal too! <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Mom, I have these children&#39;s rights, <br/>
&gt; so you can&#39;t influence me, <br/>
&gt; or I&#39;ll call Children&#39;s Services Division, <br/>
&gt; better know as C.S.D. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Of course my first instinct was <br/>
&gt; to toss him out the door. <br/>
&gt; But the chance to teach him a lesson <br/>
&gt; made me think a little more. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I mulled it over carefully, <br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t let this go. <br/>
&gt; A smile crept upon my face, <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s messing with a pro. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Next day I took him shopping <br/>
&gt; at the local Goodwill Store. <br/>
&gt; I told him, &quot;Pick out all you want, <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s shirts & pants galore. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve called and checked with C.S.D. <br/>
&gt; who said they didn&#39;t care <br/>
&gt; if I bought you K-Mart shoes <br/>
 </span></blockquote>   instead of those Nike Airs. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve cancelled that appointment <br/>
&gt; to take your driver&#39;s test. <br/>
&gt; The C.S.D. is unconcerned <br/>
&gt; so I&#39;ll decide what&#39;s best. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I said &quot;No time to stop and eat, <br/>
&gt; or pick up stuff to munch. <br/>
&gt; And tomorrow you can start to learn <br/>
&gt; to make your own sack lunch. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Just save the raging appetite, <br/>
&gt; and wait till dinner time. <br/>
&gt; We&#39;re having liver and onions, <br/>
&gt; a favorite dish of mine. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; He asked &quot;&quot;Can I please rent a movie, <br/>
&gt; to watch on my VCR? <br/>
&gt; &quot;Sorry, but I sold your TV, <br/>
&gt; for new tires on my car. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I also rented out your room, <br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll take the couch instead. <br/>
&gt; The C.S.D. requires <br/>
&gt; just a roof over your head. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your clothing won&#39;t be trendy now, <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll choose what we eat. <br/>
&gt; That allowance that you used to get, <br/>
&gt; will buy me something neat. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m selling off your jet ski, <br/>
&gt; dirt-bike & roller blades. <br/>
&gt; Check out the &quot;Parents Bill of Rights,&quot; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s in effect today! <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Hey hot shot, are you crying, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>   why are you on your knees? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you asking God to help you out, <br/>
&gt; instead of C.S.D..? <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Send to all people that have teenagers or have already <br/>
&gt; raised teenagers, or have children who will soon be <br/>
&gt; teenagers or those who will be parents someday <br/>
&gt; OR ANYONE WHO&#39;D JUST GET A LAUGH ... <br/>
&gt; I love this One!!! <br/>

<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
THERE is an antagonistic view of the world!<br/>
<br/>
We have nowhere to go here.  My kids pretty much prefer thrift store stuff, <br/>
except for pants from the military surplus.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, what kind of mother AM I?<br/>
<br/>
Last night I let Marty spend the night at his friend&#39;s house with nobody else <br/>
there (easy phone access to friend&#39;s grandmother and me, but still...), and <br/>
Kirby just didn&#39;t come home and didn&#39;t tell me where he was going.  I&#39;d bet <br/>
(and win, no doubt) he&#39;s at his friend Leif&#39;s house, who was out of town last <br/>
weekend.  This afternoon they&#39;ll all be home because there&#39;s a gaming session <br/>
planned here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to make them snacks, but I can&#39;t get upstairs yet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found my jaw this morning. It fell on the floor and rolled away when I read <br/>
this last night. Today I thought I would browse around this site, maybe to <br/>
see if there was anything better? Maybe some masochistic feeling I had to <br/>
placate in myself? I found a horrific article on how to *train* a three month <br/>
old! And another that discussed the finer points of spanking, and what <br/>
implement of plumbing fixtures was best fit for bequeathing a beating upon <br/>
children. (Remember to always swat yourself on the leg first to remind how <br/>
hard to hit.) Another discussed breastfeeding, and how to properly train new <br/>
babies to only nurse when it is convenient for mom. No nursing on demand, you <br/>
will soon have a spoiled child on your hands! Then I found an article that I <br/>
thought might be the one redeeming factor, a ray of light perhaps? It started <br/>
with, what I thought sounded like some good Unschooling thoughts. I was <br/>
beginning to think that maybe this might be one article I could recommend to <br/>
Christian homeschoolers wondering how to fit Unschooling and Christianity <br/>
together. But the article, which started out so promising, had this to say <br/>
about the roles girls and boys play in life. If only the author had been able <br/>
to omit the three sentences at the end! <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could follow this rule: If a workbook can be enjoyed by the <br/>
children, if they desire to do it just for fun, then it cannot be harmful <br/>
unless they become so absorbed in books that they neglect the important <br/>
social and work aspects of family. Except on rare occasions, book studies <br/>
should never consume a large part of the day. Children should be engaged in <br/>
work and play with their families. A young daughter needs to begin early <br/>
learning and practicing to be a wife, mother, and home-keeper. A boy should <br/>
begin early, two years old, practicing to be the man of the house and the <br/>
President of the United States. He should be given responsibility and an <br/>
important role in sustaining the family. Our first concern should be the <br/>
development of character, work ethic, and personal confidence. <br/>
<br/>

be beaten into submission, too, or trained for the Presidency? It takes<br/>
a<br/>
major ego to run for office; and of course, a woman wouldn&#39;t ever do<br/>
that.<br/>
Criminy.****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy!  My son would be in so much trouble if he were being raised in<br/>
this type of atmosphere!  He asked me one day (about 4 years ago) if he<br/>
could have a sparkly dress like Ginger Rogers (we used to watch a lot of<br/>
Fred and Ginger movies).  Not only could he have one but I let him pick<br/>
out the material and the pattern!  He helped me make it.  The dress is<br/>
gone now (too small, ripped the hem out etc...) but it has been replaced<br/>
by a few handpicked bras and some very wonderful, sensual velvet tops.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t wear them outside the house anymore (he has noticed, at 7<br/>
1/2, that men don&#39;t wear these things), but he wears them at home,<br/>
lounging around watching movies or building with his legos.<br/>
<br/>
His father and I are proud of him and it would never occur to us to<br/>
punish him for this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even sure what to say next.  I went to the site and read for a<br/>
few hours today and am floored that this is the norm in some circles.<br/>
Actually, I&#39;m sure that I know people who do this (no proof though - I&#39;m<br/>
not Christian, so I&#39;m not confided in).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop now, my brain has a hard time wrapping around this.<br/>

the same sort of advice was handed out in secular pamphlets and books on child<br/>
raising and hundreds of thousands followed similar advice. These theories or<br/>
practices aren&#39;t new. The people who promote this kind of child abuse *know*<br/>
the dynamics of abuse, they *know* that children so mistreated and offered no<br/>
way out and forced to honor and obey those that pound and pummel maiming blows<br/>
on their bodies and minds will repress the knowledge (for what child could<br/>
live with the knowledge of what is being done to them by their only hope of<br/>
life?), and pass on to their own children the same lack of empathy and legacy<br/>
of violence and unfeeling. <br/>
<br/>
Those who promote this at the highest levels do so with awareness of the harm<br/>

the seeds of warriors across the land. Make no mistake they are not unaware<br/>
that violence begets violence and that is why it is so important that the<br/>

unquestioning obedience. It is holy jihad. <br/>

be on the side of protecting the parent&#39;s rights to mistreat their children.<br/>

self-importance. <br/>
<br/>
Does this come from arrogate? <br/>
<br/>
arrogate - to claim or appropriate without right.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno, I think it takes a bit of hard core arrogance to stand up against the<br/>
pig headedness of those who would go along with practices that clearly harm.<br/>
When those harmful practices are directed at the most vulnerable members of a<br/>
society, babies and children, is it arrogant to continue to rail at the<br/>
injustice? <br/>
<br/>
The truth is we have undisputed scientific proof that beating babies and<br/>
children causes life long harm, that their very brain patterns are disturbed<br/>
and maimed.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in the near future we will also have medical proof that self directed<br/>
learning is the best kind of learning to support an individual through out<br/>
their whole lifetime. That this kind of learning is the best kind of learning<br/>
for our human types of organisms. <br/>
<br/>
Since it isn&#39;t provable at this point beyond personal experience, why should<br/>
the teaching theory that advocates using the carrot and a stick method hold<br/>
more weight than the personal experience of individual families who have found<br/>
that the carrot and the stick approach distorts and limits the potential of<br/>
the human mind to learn? <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t taking a position inherently arrogant?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe I just have genetic matches for me and a man I would choose to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would be so simple if we were little examinable separate parts that could<br/>
be dissected cleanly. Teaching and learning separate from our emotions, our<br/>
history, our hopes for the future, or our economic and political realities.<br/>
But this isn&#39;t possible. How we view our children affects them and us from the<br/>
very first contact. How we ourselves were treated as children continues to<br/>
color and shape our views all through our adulthood. I believe passionately<br/>
that all children are born innocent, and baring organic disease, if treated<br/>
with loving kindness and generosity will become kind and generous and loving.<br/>
There are those who just as passionately believe that children are born in sin<br/>
and only through strict training and diligence on the part of their caretakers<br/>
will that sin be kept at bay. Both of us have a fertile ground to sow our<br/>
theories because the early pre-verbal years of a child&#39;s life are shape able<br/>
in ways that we used to know only instinctively and now know medically. We now<br/>
know that early mental and physical experience literally forms children and<br/>
their emotions and brain patterns. We create our children, in our own image,<br/>
by our actions; they become what we do to them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Taking a stand always has risks. I believe not taking a stand when one<br/>
believes that harm will come from keeping silent is evil. I guess the<br/>
important thing to consider is how the rights of others are considered when<br/>
one takes a stand. A stand that forces others to bend their individual will to<br/>
others point of view against their individual experience would have the<br/>
potential for great evil. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I believe and so must you unthinkingly,&quot; is different from &quot;I believe this<br/>

You&#39;ve been through a frightening time there with the snipers and all of<br/>
it on the news all the time.   Sometimes I think when kids aren&#39;t sure<br/>
about things their fears can get blown way out of proportion.  Do you<br/>
think there could be a connection?<br/>
She may have gotten the idea or heard, &quot;no one&#39;s safe&quot;  during the<br/>
shootings and now really feels there is no way to be safe.     When kids<br/>
start to think that even their parents can&#39;t keep them safe danger can<br/>
seem big and it can be everywhere,  kind of supernatural.   <br/>
<br/>
It might help to keep talking to her about the different ways you can<br/>
keep her safe.    <br/>
<br/>
Would it help to make a magic charm against the danger?<br/>
<br/>
Calcium is a mild kind of calming agent, and there are homeopathic<br/>
remedies to help with stress.   Warm baths and back rubs,  foot massages<br/>
all those things can contribute to a feeling of well being.   Lavender<br/>
oil or sandalwood for aroma therapy.    <br/>
<br/>
Does she like exercise?    Our bodies make naturally calming chemicals<br/>
during and after exercise and maybe getting out  and swimming or running<br/>
or bouncing on the trampoline would help.   You&#39;d be surprised how many<br/>
people use exercise for anxiety control. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry she&#39;s having a hard time.  = (<br/>
