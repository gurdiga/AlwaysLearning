<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178505754">How come no one ever told me about Life Learning<br/>
Magazine?  Does everyone here know about it??  It&#39;s<br/>
the &quot;International Magazine of Self Directed<br/>
Learning.&quot;<br/>
Looks like I need to get another magazine<br/>
subscription.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/">http://www.lifelearningmagazine.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
By the way, while I am on the subject, does anyone<br/>
here take All Round Magazine?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.allroundmagazine.com/">http://www.allroundmagazine.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
It looks like it would most appeal to younger kids,<br/>
but looks like a really cool magazine and we are<br/>
thinking about getting it.  It&#39;s hard to find cool<br/>
magazines for younger kids that are not based on some<br/>
tv show, or full of advertising.  I even take<br/>
Parenting Magazine (which I don&#39;t get much out of<br/>
because we are not a mainstream family and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
speak to us or address our life) just to get the<br/>
Sesame Street kids magazine which comes with it.  If<br/>
they like All Round I think I will cancel the<br/>
Parenting one.  It&#39;s a waste of paper IMO.<br/>
<br/>
We are also thinking about a nature/animal magazine<br/>
for the kids. I know there are a few.  Does anyone<br/>
have a recommendation as to which are better/best? <br/>
Particularly ones which deal with wildlife in the US,<br/>
but doesn&#39;t have to be exclusively US.  I have just<br/>
seen some which hardly deal with US wildlife at all,<br/>
and living in the country with deer and bears and such<br/>
as we do, it would be nice for the boys to get a<br/>
magazine that sometimes deal with the animals that are<br/>
our neighbors.<br/>

wasn&#39;t too happy with her last issue, it was full of *back to school* ideas. <br/>
We like National Geographic World, ASK, Cricket, Ladybug, and Highlights. ASK <br/>
is a science mag, Cricket and Ladybug are literary mags. World is NG&#39;s kids <br/>
mag. <br/>
<br/>
I used to get Parenting too. The only issue I ever really liked was the one <br/>
they put out about 3 years ago that had an article that profiled three <br/>
different hsing families. One was a religious family (I think Catholic) that <br/>
did school at home, another family who I can&#39;t remember what style they used, <br/>
and a family in Texas (I think) who own their own organic farm/greenhouses <br/>
and they unschool their kids. It was the first time I ever saw anything in <br/>
print that accurately described what I was aiming for for our family. And it <br/>
lead me to find John Holt, and others. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

When my boys were younger they loved &quot;Ranger Rick&quot; (wildlife oriented) and <br/>
&quot;Contact 3-2-1&quot;.  Now it&#39;s &quot;Surfing&quot; and &quot;Electronic Games Monthly&quot;.<br/>
