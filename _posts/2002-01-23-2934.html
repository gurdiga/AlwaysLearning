<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647626253">I, too, do the blanking out. I consider it an altered state. It&#39;s <br/>
hard to describe. I feel a grayness and a quiet.  Usually accessed <br/>
when I am thinking or daydreaming. Accompanied by a pleasant buzz <br/>
sometimes. When kids were young, I used to run also and get this <br/>
alone time. Fifty pounds later, you can see I haven&#39;t kept up on <br/>
that, LOL. I grab little bits of it now that the older ones can drive <br/>
and I am sitting in the passenger seat. Doesn&#39;t everyone zone out <br/>
while driving on long trips?  There seem to be different levels <br/>
depending on what I am doing.  Could it be related to my ADD?  Oldest <br/>
from 2nd family also used to get upset at me for not paying attention <br/>
(where have I heard that complaint before? ahh, my mom!), but she has <br/>
realized that it is not due to a lack of love for her now and she <br/>
patiently &quot;wakes&quot; me up. She even explains it to the other kids. I <br/>
have noticed it in at least one of the other of my 5 kids when they <br/>
were in public school.<br/>
<br/>
Time to do the dishes, gotta run.</div>
