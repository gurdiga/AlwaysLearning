<div id="ygrps-yiv-29928682">Hi, Folks!<br/>
<br/>
I miss everyone very much.  I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t had a lot of time to even <br/>
read any of the posts or write or anything.  I&#39;ve been here but I have been <br/>
kind of overwhelmed with my hamster-in-a-wheel-like existence (that&#39;s what <br/>
it feels like right now, anyway).  I just wanted to drop a line to let you <br/>
know that I still exist, I still have a computer, and I&#39;m looking forward <br/>
to seeing everyone next month!<br/>
<br/>
Much love,<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ll be in your position in just a week or so! &lt;G&gt;  I&#39;ll let you keep it as <br/>
long as I can! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

to. Now, I&#39;m not going to be able to get that song out of my head. ;) <br/>
