<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672121500">Hi all, I&#39;m in Australia and I&#39;ve noticed some families here who identify as unscooling/natural learning, saying they disagree with the ideas of delight-driven or child-led learning. But to me, it seems natural to want to feel happy doing something, and vice versa, when you&#39;re happy learning happens best. Are these terms frowned apon in the USA too? I don&#39;t think the delight-driven or child-led means EXCLUSIVELY this. Eg I often suggest things for our family to do, I guide, and sometimes I want/have to do something that involves the kids coming along to that they&#39;re not so keen on! But I would still say their learning is child-led and delight-driven.<br/>
<br/>
I think that sadness, grief etc are all important emotions that can teach us alot, and I don&#39;t think that either those terms mean shielding children from those challenging feelings or experiences. I&#39;m there for my kids to comfort them if they need me, but I don&#39;t try to &#39;&#39;spare&#39;&#39; them anything. Do others agree?<br/>
<br/>
Some who disagree with these terms, insist that they&#39;re &#39;&#39;family-centred&#39;&#39;and that some degree of parent-led learning is necessary, because there is alot children wouldn&#39;t learn if they had the option eg. to just hang out in bed all day. But truly, are there any kids out there who are happy in their lives and aware of what&#39;s on offer to them, happy to stay in bed all day? (and I don&#39;t mean now and then to recharge the batteries, I mean regularly.) I think it&#39;s ok for parents to lead the way sometimes, but I don&#39;t see why it has to happen forcefully? It&#39;s not us against them.<br/>
<br/>
Something Sandra said once when she visited a forum I&#39;m on, struck with me, why do we have to &#39;&#39;centred&#39;&#39; on anything or anyone at all? Using the word centred, sounds so formal and rigid, when our unscooling life is far from that. It&#39;s flexible and changes all the time. <br/>
<br/>
I am starting to realise that I used to share my fellow unschoolers determination not to be child-centred, but that seems now to be presumptuous and somewhat hostile. I don&#39;t think my children ever expected to be the centre of anything. I think my children know they&#39;re part of a wonderful, wide world, and why oh why was I ever defensive and concerned about ensuring they didn&#39;t become &#39;&#39;spoilt&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;doted apon.&#39;&#39; <br/>
<br/>
I have parented fairly instinctively and naturally from the start, but suddenly as the children turn school-age, there seems to be pressure from society to detach and push independence, and maybe that&#39;s where the defensive attitude comes from? Suddenly there&#39;s a feeling that we have to prove something to the world?<br/>
<br/>
The irony in this whole thing, though, is that the proof is in the pudding! It seems to me, in order for our kids to have the secure, free lives we want for them, we need to let go of the agendas and trying to prove things to others (or ourselves) and just relaaax. And have fun, and just live!<br/>
<br/>
Or because my children are young, am I naive?</div>

 </span></blockquote>Lots of people in the US use these terms too.  My problem with them, is that they don&#39;t accurately portray in easy words, what we do.  Unschooling is pretty accurate, when you come right to it.  We don&#39;t do school, we live as if school didn&#39;t exist, or try to at least.  <br/>
Child led, implies something that doesn&#39;t actually happen in my house.  While lots of things happen because a child has interest or initiates something, almost all things at my house happen through a large effort on my part.  My children don&#39;t lead in that.  I do.  I find outlets and resource for them.  Chamille, at the age of 15, is just starting to navigate this realm on her own, in little baby steps.<br/>
Delight driven doesn&#39;s appeal to me either.  While it&#39;s great to delight in things, it isn&#39;t always what drives people to do things, even things they love to do.  Kids out of school, unschooling, learn naturally and the delight doesn&#39;t disappear, they continue to be delighted by all kinds of things as they grow up.  Since, I&#39;m often the driver, both literally and figuratively, sometimes I delight in it and sometimes I don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t think the delight-driven or child-led means EXCLUSIVELY this.

But I would still say their learning is child-led and delight-driven.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s easy to describe what small children do as &quot;delight driven&quot;.  Once they are teens, it doesn&#39;t seem to apply well.  What drives a teen is varied and different, and sometimes not delightful at all!  &quot;Child led&quot; feels similar.  Even though my children seem to pull me along in many directions, it&#39;s me that makes it happen for them.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps I&#39;m misreading or misunderstanding, but I DO try very hard to spare my kids and shield them from unpleasantness.  There is enough of that stuff naturally in the world that they should have me or their dad protecting them from that as much as possible!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you might be confusing the issues here.  We most definitely live a family centered life, led by the parents, who choose to give our children many many choices and then help them with those choices.  I don&#39;t think this is a case that you can define by what ignorant people choose to say in contrast to what unschooling is all about.  People make a lot of ignorant assumptions about unschooling that just aren&#39;t the reality of what actually happens in unschooling households.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am starting to realise that I used to share my fellow unschoolers determination not to be child-centred, but that seems now to be presumptuous and somewhat hostile.

 </span></blockquote>Both of my kids have expected to be the center of attention at various, and many variety of ways in their lives.  Babies require it.  We work towards natural cohesiveness.  Children who are treated with kindness don&#39;t behave in ways in which others will say &quot;spoiled&quot;.  And just for the record, I DO dote on my kids, it&#39;s something that I enjoy doing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;...as the children turn school-age, there seems to be pressure from society to detach and push independence, and maybe that&#39;s where the defensive attitude comes from? Suddenly there&#39;s a feeling that we have to prove something to the world?<br/>

This is why it&#39;s so much better to focus on what you love to do.  If you are living in a way in which you are still reacting to why schools suck, your focus will be on that big negative, rather than on the big wide world in which you do wonderful things.  Don&#39;t prove anything to anyone.  Others will see how wonderful your kids are, or they won&#39;t.  Some people will choose to focus on what all your kids are lacking in, or why you are completely insane or wrong or whatever.... but you can be confident in knowing the truth!   <br/>

See now, I didn&#39;t even know that!  It&#39;s just one more reason to not use it!  It&#39;s an actual brand... I just looked it up.  You can purchase Delight Driven curriculum programs.  I learn something new everyday!<br/>

Naysayers also like to believe that some kids just aren&#39;t that motivated to ask to learn about X.  Child-led and all the assumptions that go with it make understanding Unschooling, very difficult.  It&#39;s already difficult for most people to get it anyway.<br/>
The various new articles about unschooling prove that over and over again, that even smart educated journalists can&#39;t even wrap their minds around what unschooling is.  Child-led, just adds another layer of confusion!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some Australian defensiveness insisting on &quot;family  <br/>
centered&quot;   life.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t love &quot;child led&quot; as a term.  I&#39;m not speaking for  <br/>
the USA, but just think that use of that description can throw people  <br/>
onto a bad track where they wait for the child to lead.   Learning  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be led by anyone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m there for my kids to comfort them if they need me, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
try to &#39;&#39;spare&#39;&#39; them anything. Do others agree?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter whether others agree.  If this list unanimously  <br/>
declares one thing or another, it would still be a subset of the  <br/>
readership because many read and never post, and there are other lists  <br/>
than this one.<br/>
<br/>
Were there people saying unschoolers shouldn&#39;t be sheltered from the  <br/>
harsh realities of life or something?  I think ALL children should be  <br/>
spared the gory details of the worst parts of life when they&#39;re young.<br/>
<br/>
-=-because there is alot children wouldn&#39;t learn if they had the  <br/>
option eg. to just hang out in bed all day. But truly, are there any  <br/>
kids out there who are happy in their lives and aware of what&#39;s on  <br/>
offer to them, happy to stay in bed all day? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen anyone want to stay in bed who wasn&#39;t sick or depressed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think it&#39;s ok for parents to lead the way sometimes, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
see why it has to happen forcefully? It&#39;s not us against them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I come up with an idea for my husband and me to do something, I  <br/>
might be leading, but I couldn&#39;t possibly force him, nor even coerce  <br/>
him.  I make the plan seem fun and justifiable, and I&#39;ve already  <br/>
thought of the details and all...  That&#39;s being persuasive or  <br/>
inviting. That&#39;s still partnership and teamwork.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Suddenly there&#39;s a feeling that we have to prove something to the  <br/>
world?-=-<br/>
<br/>
That will always come in spurts and waves.<br/>
<br/>

lives we want for them, we need to let go of the agendas and trying to  <br/>
prove things to others (or ourselves) and just relaaax. And have fun,  <br/>
and just live!<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re not naive, but I would like to apply to have the &quot;just&quot;  <br/>
examined.  Not &quot;just relax&quot; or &quot;just live&quot; but to relax with an open  <br/>
heart, and to live richly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is interesting to me because although I&#39;m Australian, virtually everything I know about unschooling I learned here on this list and on Sandra&#39;s site.  So to me it&#39;s almost like there is no other form of unschooling except the principles promoted by Sandra, Pam, Joyce and some of the other experienced posters on this list. And one of these key unschooling principles is the concept of strewing, where a parent actively brings a rich variety of things and experiences into their child&#39;s life, and then allows the child to choose and pursue any of these for as long as they wish.<br/>
<br/>
To me, strewing encourages an organically evolving form of learning, highly responsive to immediate circumstances, and based on the love and trust shared between parent and child.  So terms like &#39;child-led&#39;, &#39;parent-led&#39;, &#39;family-centred&#39; etc seem to me to putting into concrete something which should be fluid, something which will flow so easily and naturally if we let it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146757959">Thanks for clearing that up Pam, that&#39;s really surprising to me! I thought it was just another expression for unschooling, as I have read/heard it used in unschooling groups (eg people debating about which words best fit what their families do at home).<br/>
<br/>
Whilst I&#39;m on the topic, over here in Australia &#39;&#39;natural learning&#39;&#39; seems to be used more often, in place of unschooling. Is natural learning used interchangably with unschooling in the states, or does it mean something different?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616538588">Thanks Jenny, your post was interesting. I am going to try to quote you now...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Perhaps I&#39;m misreading or misunderstanding, but I DO try very hard to spare my kids and shield them from unpleasantness. There is enough of that stuff naturally in the world that they should have me or their dad protecting them from that as much as possible!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 When I talked about not trying to shield my kids, I meant from things that impact our family directly, such as a death. When I was growing up, unfortunately death was a bit of a taboo subject. I remember having a lot of questions and things I wanted to get out about death (when it happened) but it wasn&#39;t encouraged and I was brushed off. Eg an extended family member dying of cancer, I wasn&#39;t told they even had cancer until after they actually died. In hindsight, I think that was because they were trying to protect me. I hope to do things differently with my children, and be open with them about these kinds of things, welcome their questions etc. I think that some things, although they hurt and are unpleasant, we can also learn from. Hope that clarifies.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a separate, different thing. I use &quot;natural learning&quot; lots of  <br/>
times, but for discussing how learning can happen in the absence of  <br/>
teaching and lessons.  &quot;Unschooling&quot; is more about an over-arching  <br/>
commitment to living in such a way that natural learning can happen in  <br/>
the home, and getting the children out so natural learning can happen  <br/>
wherever and however--because all the learning takes place inside the  <br/>
learner.<br/>

Try not to be reactionary, though.  Doing the opposite of what my  <br/>
parents did would be as wrong as doing exactly what my parents did  <br/>
without thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Neither hiding death nor bringing it all out and cataloging it is  <br/>
&quot;best.&quot;  It depends on the kid, on the necessity to know, on his  <br/>
ability to  handle it.  There are times in people&#39;s lives to share and  <br/>
times to shelter them.  If my dog had died during the conference I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have wanted to know.  (One family got a call on Sunday and  <br/>
the kids knew on the way home that their dog had been hit by a car; I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have shared that info in advance, had i been the house- <br/>
sitter, or whatever.  I wouldn&#39;t have shared it with the kids if I&#39;d  <br/>
been the parent and had gotten that call.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all laid up and drugged up today. It wouldn&#39;t be a good time for  <br/>
me to get really bad news.  When I&#39;m home, later, then...<br/>

Yes!  This is true for all people, including those that go to school!  I guess, it applies better to unschooling than to schooling, since the basic premise behind school, is that learning must be forced and inserted, and taught, and that kids learn because of this.     <br/>

I was thinking that what motivates Chamille, at least, many times is helping others.

Although, she does delight in someone else&#39;s happiness that she helped create.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38783696">Hi im catherine and my youngest son(12) goes to A.S.Neills Summer <br/>
hill school (its the original Democratic school in Suffolk England where kids go to<br/>
lessons if and when they choose to..they make the school laws and run<br/>
on self regulation...its a joy to behold.. with a community of 80 or so<br/>
kids from 5 to 18 years). I also have 2 dd 27 and 32.<br/>
<br/>
I really love and embrace Radical unschooling and as i have deschooled myself<br/>
over the years I have seen our whole familys life turn around in the<br/>
most sane and joyful way. <br/>
<br/>
This is my first post (i think!!). Just<br/>
wanted to say Hi and a big thankyou to all who brought the Unschooling<br/>
conference to London this year it was a much needed breath of Sanity blowing into this country which is really insane in its ideas, policies and history<br/>
of class and education!! <br/>
<br/>
I think its been hard for me to post because my son goes to Summerhill for half of the year and therefore is not with me all year round.<br/>
But over the years as i have let go of feeling the need to be some sort of police woman in my kids life our relationships have become so much more loving,authentic, trusting and respectful.I was dragged up believing that as a kid i was a wild animal who had to be controlled and tamed, school further confirmed this...its been a long haul into recovering from this for me.<br/>
<br/>
With my son at home for the past 2 months i decided to stop suggesting when bed time should happen and let him find his own rythym, which of course he has...his now taken to going to bed when we do...that of course may change again as he does.<br/>
But no more policing from me!! what a relief for us all!! and as people have shared i also didnt bring children into the world to be some sort of authoritarian dictator...the buck can and has stopped here. And your posts and Sandra,s invaluable writings and path blazing has supported as all along the way.<br/>
<br/>
My names Catherine and i wanted to say Hi!!x<br/>

It&#39;s not a separate, different thing. I use &quot;natural learning&quot; lots of  <br/>
<br/>
times, but for discussing how learning can happen in the absence of  <br/>
<br/>
teaching and lessons.  &quot;Unschooling&quot; is more about an over-arching  <br/>

commitment to living in such a way that natural learning can happen in  <br/>

the home, and getting the children out so natural learning can happen  <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Hi all, I&#39;m in Australia and I&#39;ve noticed some families here who &gt;&gt;&gt;identify as unscooling/natural learning, saying they disagree with &gt;&gt;&gt;the ideas of delight-driven or child-led learning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is interesting to me because although I&#39;m Australian, virtually everything I know about unschooling I learned here on this list and on Sandra&#39;s site.  So to me it&#39;s almost like there is no other form of unschooling except the principles promoted by Sandra, Pam, Joyce and some of the other experienced posters on this list. And one of these key unschooling principles is the concept of strewing, where a parent actively brings a rich variety of things and experiences into their child&#39;s life, and then allows the child to choose and pursue any of these for as long as they wish.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To me, strewing encourages an organically evolving form of learning, highly responsive to immediate circumstances, and based on the love and trust shared between parent and child.  So terms like &#39;child-led&#39;, &#39;parent-led&#39;, &#39;family-centred&#39; etc seem to me to putting into concrete something which should be fluid, something which will flow so easily and naturally if we let it.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not as useful and direct as it is to say &quot;Create a rich  <br/>
environment within which kids can&#39;t help but learn, and give your  <br/>
children choices.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My children are 23, 20, and 17.  They didn&#39;t go to school.  They  <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;choose what they wanted to learn.&quot;  Neither did I.  We did  <br/>
things, I provided things for them to play with and explore and they  <br/>
learned.  I was sure they would.  They didn&#39;t always learn the thing I  <br/>
had thought they might, but they always learned.  I learned too, more  <br/>
and more, about how kids learn in the absence of school. And I&#39;ve  <br/>
learned how other parents see learning and how that will help or hurt  <br/>
their family&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;choose to learn&quot; those things.  They were a natural part of  <br/>
what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
Our learning wasn&#39;t &quot;driven&quot; by anything except people&#39;s natural  <br/>
instinct to learn.  We had a delightful life, but that wasn&#39;t so that  <br/>
we could drive learning around with it.<br/>
<br/>
Any terms that require explanations and definitions and arguments  <br/>
might be better replaced with ideas like &quot;learning all the time.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well, since Pam has enlightened me with the fact that Delight Driven is actually a religious curriculum name brand, I can totally see a good reason not to use it to describe unschooling.<br/>
A child choosing what they want to do during the day isn&#39;t the same thing as a child leading daily activities.  That is why &quot;child led&quot; doesn&#39;t appeal to me.  Plus, I seriously do a lot of the leading.  I find things of interest, like strewing a bit, but I search out things that I know without a doubt they want to do or be involved in, and I find ways to make it happen.<br/>
I like doing that for my kids, finding ways to make things happen.  I figure, by watching and being involved in that process, they&#39;ll eventually do it themselves.  I guess one could say that my children led me to find them activities.  And in some ways that is the case, but I don&#39;t wait around for them to choose something to learn about and let them tell me.  It&#39;s more organic than that.<br/>
Since we live together and we know each other pretty well, and we talk and explore the world together, I&#39;m pretty in tune with what they are about and want to do, so I bring things to them.  Sometimes it looks like a buffet and sometimes it looks like a simple meal.  They are free to decline anything that I&#39;ve put before them, but mostly they take it up because I find things that I know they&#39;ll like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The choices shouldn&#39;t be every or none, though.<br/>
<br/>
What and how something is said should be based on the individual  <br/>
child not on age or some adult vision of what happy life means. Lying  <br/>
about an animal&#39;s death to maintain a vision of a happy life can be  <br/>
way more damaging than experiencing the warts of life. Exposing a  <br/>
child to pictures of dead children because that&#39;s part of life would  <br/>
just be cruel. There are other choices!<br/>
<br/>
While some kids are very sensitive, for most kids death isn&#39;t as  <br/>
scary for them as it is for adults. It doesn&#39;t mean the same thing.  <br/>
They aren&#39;t necessarily lacking in understanding -- like at some ages  <br/>
death may be equated with leaving and they assume the person or  <br/>
animal will be back some day like Aunt Sally who visits once every 3  <br/>
months (years to a child ;-). They just don&#39;t internalize death the  <br/>
same way.<br/>
<br/>
There are several good books about death for kids though the only one  <br/>
coming to mind is The Tenth Good Thing About Barney. (It&#39;s about the  <br/>
child&#39;s cat who died and he and the father come up with 10 great  <br/>
things about the cat. It&#39;s a good read even without a pet dying.) If  <br/>
you search the archives here for that book -- or at Amazon and read  <br/>
the recommendations for other books -- you&#39;ll find some good  <br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the child is showing an interest in the world and the news, I  <br/>
don&#39;t see a reason to show them. I wouldn&#39;t have taken 5 yo Kathryn  <br/>
to a lecture on Henry Thoreau and I didn&#39;t turn on the news for her.  <br/>
They didn&#39;t interest her. At 18, though she has an awareness of  <br/>
what&#39;s going on in the world, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s seen a whole news  <br/>
program just because it isn&#39;t part of her interests.<br/>
<br/>

prevent them from hearing about. If this is happening often, then it  <br/>
sounds like you&#39;re shielding them too much. If Kathryn had a personal  <br/>
connection with someone who died and I hadn&#39;t yet told her I can  <br/>
imagine asking she not be told until I could handle it. But  <br/>

upset? Or are they asking questions that you find upsetting to answer  <br/>
but aren&#39;t affecting them as much as you?<br/>
<br/>
All what you&#39;ve written is about you, not about your kids. It&#39;s all  <br/>
about you protecting them and your assumption of hurt. But you  <br/>
haven&#39;t said anything about your particular unique kids and how they  <br/>
feel.<br/>
<br/>
More specific examples would be helpful. Because all I can imagine is  <br/>
you&#39;re living in a very dangerous area full of traumatized families  <br/>
and your priority might be getting out of there or finding people who  <br/>
are actively creating more peaceful pockets. Or you&#39;re projecting  <br/>
your own imagined feelings onto your kids and assuming the stories  <br/>
are more traumatizing to them than they really are. If that&#39;s the  <br/>
case, your worry may be heightening their reaction. If you&#39;re  <br/>
worried, they&#39;ll feel there&#39;s something to worry about when, if you  <br/>
had been more objective, they would have noted it and moved on.<br/>

Not sending them to school is some protection.  Kids being at school  <br/>
are in danger of hearing about things from teachers.   Thinking of  <br/>
what things:  child abuse, murder, abortion, in the discussion of  <br/>
current events.   And the other kids are likely to spill anything they  <br/>
know, conversationally, at any time.<br/>

If someone was saying something to my kids when they ere little, I  <br/>
would be quick and strong in my objection.  I would signal them and  <br/>

persuasive or you can decide to pick new friends, but you cna&#39;t call  <br/>
the shots with other peop;e&#39;s lives.  And if you find yourslf needing  <br/>
to protect your kids very often, maybe you&#39;re waiting too long to give  <br/>
them a kid-version explanation of the thing, or of the euphemism, like  <br/>
&quot;putting a dog to sleep.&quot;<br/>

&gt; There are several good books about death for kids though the only one  <br/>
&gt; coming to mind is The Tenth Good Thing About Barney. (It&#39;s about the  <br/>
&gt; child&#39;s cat who died and he and the father come up with 10 great  <br/>
&gt; things about the cat. It&#39;s a good read even without a pet dying.) If  <br/>
&gt; you search the archives here for that book -- or at Amazon and read  <br/>
&gt; the recommendations for other books -- you&#39;ll find some good  <br/>
&gt; suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a personal subject for us....when our oldest son was 22 months old, our second was born and died within 12 days.  He never left the NICU.  There was no shielding our living child from the permanence of &quot;no baby brother&quot;, but we did our utmost to keep his life stable and happy...<br/>
<br/>
We found a great book, Goodbye Mousie, by Robie H. Harris...about a boy who wakes up to find his mouse has died...it&#39;s told with humor and gentleness, the art is great, and it doesn&#39;t shy away from the feelings of grief.  It helped our very young child, and, later, his ssister.  she&#39;s 5 now, and the book is still a cherished part of her personal collection.  It&#39;s hard to read without tearing up, but I recommend it for finding a &quot;soft&quot; way to introduce the concept of death.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m getting a clear picture of what you&#39;re trying to  <br/>
&gt; prevent them from hearing about. If this is happening often, then it  <br/>
&gt; sounds like you&#39;re shielding them too much. If Kathryn had a personal  <br/>
&gt; connection with someone who died and I hadn&#39;t yet told her I can  <br/>
&gt; imagine asking she not be told until I could handle it. But  <br/>
&gt; situations like that are rare. Why are these situations so frequent  <br/>
&gt; for you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Besides going and living under a rock, how can I protect my kids  <br/>
&gt; &gt; from these unnecessary traumas brought upon them by other people.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; And I really do mean trauma because the stuff that has been said to  <br/>
&gt; &gt; them by another child has been horrible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are your kids finding these stories traumatic? Are they coming home  <br/>
&gt; upset? Or are they asking questions that you find upsetting to answer  <br/>
&gt; but aren&#39;t affecting them as much as you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All what you&#39;ve written is about you, not about your kids. It&#39;s all  <br/>
&gt; about you protecting them and your assumption of hurt. But you  <br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t said anything about your particular unique kids and how they  <br/>
&gt; feel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More specific examples would be helpful. Because all I can imagine is  <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re living in a very dangerous area full of traumatized families  <br/>
&gt; and your priority might be getting out of there or finding people who  <br/>
&gt; are actively creating more peaceful pockets. Or you&#39;re projecting  <br/>
&gt; your own imagined feelings onto your kids and assuming the stories  <br/>
&gt; are more traumatizing to them than they really are. If that&#39;s the  <br/>
&gt; case, your worry may be heightening their reaction. If you&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; worried, they&#39;ll feel there&#39;s something to worry about when, if you  <br/>
&gt; had been more objective, they would have noted it and moved on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister shields her children from anything she finds uncomfortable.  The dog went to a new home (adopting away a member of the family seems scarier, to me; I might fear I was next, if I were very young, or just have a lot of confusion).  She routinely removes dead frogs and bugs from view so the children won&#39;t see them...now the children are beginning to ask about death, and she does&#39;t know what to say.<br/>
<br/>
With my children, now 8 and 5, we made a commitment to tell them the truth...in a version they can easily grasp.  I wait for them to show some interest in the topic or to ask questions,because it seems cruel to force the world&#39;s harsh realities upon them just to tell the truth.  Even then, I proceed slowly and carefully.  When they are satisfied, for the moment, we&#39;re done.  When the answers they have no longer satisfy their need to know, we revisit the topic.<br/>
<br/>
Your children will tell you (and maybe others, too) what is comfortable for them.  It can be even more frightening, I think, if a parent can&#39;t bring themselves to allow any exposure to the &quot;bad stuff&quot; in life, once the child begins to sense that the bad stuff exists.  How awful must it be if even Mom can&#39;t stand to talk about it?    <br/>
<br/>
Death happens to us all.  It&#39;s often unpredictable, and ultimately, it&#39;s impossible to shield a child from this fact.  For us, it came very early in parenthood, and in a way that could not be ignored.  And, although I wish it hadn&#39;t, my children are joyful and thriving, largely unbothered by their knowledge of death.  As Joyce put it so aptly, they&#39;ve noted it and then moved on.  There&#39;s lots of stuff to do, right now, because they are alive, and life is fun!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll add that, then.  I&#39;m wounded and in the bed (my leg kind of sort  <br/>
of had a nervous breakdown) and it&#39;s not as easy as it would otherwise  <br/>
be.  I just added a Prescott, Arizona group to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/workd">http://sandradodd.com/workd</a><br/>
and it was a surprising amount of work at this angle (me, pillows, in  <br/>
the bed, computer kind of eased up on its own pillow.... what a  <br/>
mess.   But I&#39;m enough better than Keith went to work and I stayed  <br/>
here with a little bowl of food to go with each dose of ibuprofen.<br/>
<br/>
Last night i sat up a few hours.  I&#39;ll try that again later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That will definitely work with an adult.  I will keep repeating it too, if they keep going because that has happened when I asked them to stop.  I will do that.  The problem that I&#39;ve had is that sometimes it comes from a child.  The child clearly seems distressed too.  That is why it is being brought up to some extent, I think.  These are kids that my kids regularly play with and like.<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it&#39;s only in certain situations that I feel the need to protect my kids more than usual.  I know that I can&#39;t control people or situations.  I do address issues a lot with my kids, especially when this stuff comes up.  I just feel like I have to run interference a lot with specific people and some of the issues have been down right shocking.  I have addressed this fact with my kids and they do seem to ignore a lot, but I worry about trauma or how much they are absorbing and exposed to.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input.  It kind of confirms what I&#39;ve been thinking/doing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can tell you that from my own experience being a child raised in this manner, that the huge amount of sheltering was more harmful in the long run.  My parents sheltered us from everything potentially dangerous.  They were very religious and conservative.  Our social circle only included other religious conservative people that talked about religious conservative things.  <br/>
We weren&#39;t allowed to go to other people&#39;s houses without parent approval.  I didn&#39;t even know that there were potential predators in the world.  I was very naive about stuff like that because my parents sheltered us from all of that information.<br/>
I chose not to do that with my own kids.  I shelter them from mean people as much as possible, but not from ideas and reality.<br/>

I have a 15 yr old and an 8 yr old.  The way that Chamille was raised when she was little is very different than the way in which Margaux is being raised.  Chamille rarely watched movies geared for older kids, she did a lot of activities designed for her age, but Margaux hasn&#39;t done that as much, largely because she lives in a house with an older child.  She&#39;s seen plenty of pg-13 movies at her young age.<br/>
Margaux would be the kid at a park day bringing up ideas that are way older than she is, to other kids, simply because of the fact that her world view involves teenagers who talk about all kinds of subjects in front of her and around her.  Sometimes I do censor them and sometimes I tell them to take it to another room, but it doesn&#39;t entirely stop it from happening around Margaux.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647179581">When my kids were little, one of our dogs died.  I found her in the  <br/>
yard.  She looked comfortable, if a little dehydrated (her tongue was  <br/>
out).  I asked Kirby and Marty if they wanted to see her.  Kirby said  <br/>
yes.  Marty said no.  So Kirby and went out and with all the solemnity  <br/>
of a funereal viewing, looked at her and talked about death and what a  <br/>
good dog she had been.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby made a painting of her later.  It&#39;s too big to scan.   It was  <br/>
mostly black.<br/>
<br/>
In 2000, Holly and I were in England and Kirby was home alone one day  <br/>
when our dog accidentally killed one of the kittens our cat had had.   <br/>
The dog was moving the kittens to another place.  Her motherly  <br/>
instincts were kicking in and she was putting them in a safer room.    <br/>
One didn&#39;t survive the dog transfer.  Luckily, he could IM me and I  <br/>
could advise him on what to do to protect the others and how to deal  <br/>
with the baby kitten.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no sense having possible-dead-pet drills in the absence of  <br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
When one of Holly&#39;s rats died, we buried it in the yard, and Keith  <br/>
gave a very sweet speech.  It suprised me.  He thanked the rat for  <br/>
giving his daughter friendship and pleasure, or something like that.   <br/>
Surprising sweet, for a rodent, coming from a guy like Keith. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If the children trust the parents and the parents are compassionate  <br/>
toward the children, it seems fairly easy for shocking moments to work  <br/>
themselves out.<br/>
