===========================================================<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s note:<br/>
<br/>
This would be kind of scary for some kids, because there are some  <br/>
images that are just fun, but  many that are fairly gross.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to have seen that when I was little.  It&#39;s  <br/>
clever; parts are a lot like some of the Monty Python animation that  <br/>
Terry Gilliam used to do.  Some things can&#39;t be unseen, though, so  <br/>
sensitive moms might not want to see it, and moms of sensitive kids  <br/>
might want to preview it.<br/>
<br/>

Please, anyone, before you post a link to an article or video or  <br/>
pictures, tell us why, say something personal about what it is and  <br/>
why you brought the link.  When I&#39;m not the listowner, I don&#39;t even  <br/>
go to links posted without intro, but as listowner I felt a duty.<br/>
