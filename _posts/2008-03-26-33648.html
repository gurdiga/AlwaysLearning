<div id="ygrps-yiv-168660164">Thanks so much for the feedback about this, and for helping me to  <br/>
clarify what I think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;Another way to be unhealthy is to claim one&#39;s family is totally<br/>
 &gt;democratic, equals, all have an equal voice, etc. That doesn&#39;t make<br/>
 &gt;any sense either. Those who know the most and can do the most need<br/>
 &gt;to DO IT! More like communism, maybe. Socialism. &lt;bwg&gt; Those who<br/>
 &gt;have the ability to maintain cars and mow lawns and mend clothing<br/>
 &gt;really ought to do it cheerfully for the group, for the team! And<br/>
 &gt;those whose abilities are just growing will WANT to do what looks<br/>
 &gt;fun, and they will desire to be like the parents, if the parents keep<br/>
 &gt;themselves interesting and kind and supportive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for writing this Sandra, this is the distinction that I  <br/>
think a lot of parents in my area are having trouble with.  I like  <br/>
being a kind, loving, attached, confident parent who takes care of  <br/>
the lawn and the clothing and the cars cheerfully!  :)  Our local  <br/>
freeschool has some amazing caring people on staff who share our  <br/>
value of freedom for children, but they have recently instituted a  <br/>
Judicial System due to kids hurting other kids (instead of addressing  <br/>
the underlying needs), and now the kids are stressed about deciding  <br/>
about &quot;consequences&quot; for other children, and about how to budget  <br/>
appropriately so the electric bill gets paid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;I think that he is acknowledging that the relationship is natural  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that children depend on their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;parents, and that that precious relationship must be carefully and  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>respectfully maintained in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;a connected and positive way--not exploited by an abusive or  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>dysfunctional parent. A<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;parent (or other adult as the case may be) that is in that position  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>must tread very carefully<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;and sensitively because they are in a unique position to have even  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>more power to wound than<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;anyone else. That loving bond is what protects children and allows  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>for confident exploring of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;their world as they grow and strengthen their sense of self.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, thanks for this summary - this was my take on it too Joanna,  <br/>
and his book/talk caused me to un-enroll my children in the  <br/>
freeschool (where they were attending 1-2 half days each week since  <br/>
September) and renew my commitment to total unschooling - they  <br/>
weren&#39;t attached in a healthy way to any adults there, and we also  <br/>
left due to the reasons I mentioned above (I do NOT want my kids to  <br/>
be punished, even by other children, by vote!).<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Neufeld was able to articulate things in a way that explains, for  <br/>
me, the reasons behind things which I have felt intuitively but was  <br/>
unable to fully understand.  Of course he&#39;s not the &quot;expert&quot; and I  <br/>
get SO much from talking with other experienced parents and my lists,  <br/>
and reading, but I do like some of what he has to offer, and in my  <br/>
role in my community (as a parent educator/child advocate) I am  <br/>
always looking for additional research/support for respectful  <br/>
parenting and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So, the things that were clarified for me:<br/>
<br/>
--when the attachment is intact, parenting is comparatively easy; ie  <br/>
your child &quot;follows&quot; you (given that there are no medical or other  <br/>
health problems, or external trauma)<br/>
--that it&#39;s not about what to do/say but how to be with your children<br/>
--a very positive view of parent&#39;s &quot;power&quot; and &quot;hierarchy&quot; that is  <br/>
based on attachment and connection, and impossible through coercion<br/>
--why contact with lots of other children is *not* neccessarily what  <br/>
our children need and how it differs from continuum-intact cultures  <br/>
where children spend lots of time together in healthy ways<br/>
--why a child who is &quot;bored&quot; and begging for a playmate may need  <br/>
something else entirely (connection with you!) and why sending them  <br/>
to friends<br/>
instead may be harmful<br/>
--why it&#39;s SO important to invite our children to be dependent on us  <br/>
and why they need this until they become adults, not just as infants<br/>
--why I unschool, why I don&#39;t encourage weaning, why I sometimes do  <br/>
things for my children that they can do for themselves<br/>
--the importance of &quot;collecting&quot; or gathering and orienting our  <br/>
children to us<br/>
-why to give to a child, especially a needy or &quot;clingy&quot; child, when  <br/>
they aren&#39;t asking, not just answering when they ask<br/>
--why being &quot;clingy&quot; in certain situations is very healthy and how  <br/>
outwardly &quot;independent&quot; confident children may be suffering from a  <br/>
lack of close attachment<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Neufeld doesn&#39;t give a lot of practical parenting tools, he&#39;s  <br/>
more about the theory, which I like. I did get to hear some of his  <br/>
real life examples after the lecture, though, and they really  <br/>
resonated with me, and I like that he said publicly that none of his  <br/>
5 (now adult) children have ever been punished or &quot;consequenced&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Some people may have a hard time with the &quot;honoring our instincts&quot;  <br/>
theory about parenting, especially when they were raised in a  <br/>
dysfunctional or abusive environment, so those instincts might  <br/>
include things that don&#39;t really feel like the &quot;wisdom of elders&quot;.   <br/>
Being someone who was abused for years, much of my parenting was  <br/>
conscious override, until I settled into my real instincts. AP in the  <br/>
early years felt like an easy choice, but honoring feelings, giving  <br/>
empathy, unschooling, etc. with older kids, were more &quot;learned arts&quot;  <br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
I find that a lot of what Dr. Neufeld talks about syncs up well with  <br/>
The Continuum Concept and The Law of Attraction - i.e. expecting that  <br/>
(when kids are well-connected) they will follow your lead, and do  <br/>
their best to live up to your expectations, and according to other  <br/>
parenting theories (Patty Wipfler and NVC), if they don&#39;t &quot;follow&quot;  <br/>
there is an unmet need or hurt somewhere that needs to be addressed,  <br/>
or it may just be a lack of connection in the first place. I worry  <br/>
that people will confuse the natural authority that GN talks about  <br/>
with authoritarian parenting, or that they will confuse firm  <br/>
expectations with consequences. I love the idea of being a confident  <br/>
leader, not begging and pleading with my children to do what I want  <br/>
them to do, or explaining all my reasons, etc, but just  to matter-of- <br/>
factly expect that they want do the right thing, etc. and then when  <br/>
they don&#39;t - go back and re-connect and continue assuming positive  <br/>
intent.<br/>
<br/>
I found &quot;special time&quot; to be almost like magic with my kids - when I  <br/>
am able to REALLY do and get into it, on a regular basis, parenting  <br/>
really IS easy, the power struggles fall away, even with my most  <br/>
spirited and challenging of children.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples from the last two days - this morning Seth (8.5) came  <br/>
up and said &quot;I really want to spend some time with you&quot; and I was on  <br/>
the phone and folding laundry so I told him &quot;later, I&#39;m busy&quot; and 10  <br/>
minutes later his sister Sara was screaming because Seth sprayed her  <br/>
with water.<br/>
<br/>
Morgan (16) was wanting to go to breakfast with me sometime, so we  <br/>
planned a time on Monday morning - he was so anxious that it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
going to work out (that Jake, my toddler, wasn&#39;t going to go for  <br/>
staying with dad because he&#39;s been sick) that he started to get  <br/>
really grouchy and &quot;rude&quot;. I was so tempted to say &quot;You know, I don&#39;t  <br/>
feel like going to breakfast with you when you treat me like that&quot;,  <br/>
but I held my tongue and took him to breakfast (theorizing to my  <br/>
skeptical husband that he needed it EVEN more because he was acting  <br/>
like this) and as usual he turned back into his loving, sweet,  <br/>
cooperative self within 10 minutes and just that one breakfast time  <br/>
together will probably last us about a week - before I will have to  <br/>
again find a way to reach out and &quot;collect&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful to be here among you wise parents, and really  <br/>
appreciate if you took the time to read all of this!!  I highly value  <br/>
any input, reflections, or criticisms.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you read much about Summerhill, a big focus was on this issue -  <br/>
everyone, kids and adults, together deciding what the rules would be  <br/>
and also acting as judges when someone broke the rules. It causes more  <br/>
problems than it solves to have a system in which everyone is  <br/>
considered &quot;equal&quot; in all abilities, wisdom, intelligences, skills,  <br/>
and talents. A system built on such a contradiction of reality is  <br/>
guaranteed to be unwieldy and difficult and not to result in &quot;fair&quot;  <br/>
outcomes. &quot;Fair&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;equal.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
IS there actual research involved, or is he presenting his ideas based  <br/>
on his years of experience?<br/>
<br/>
Research - I&#39;m always interested (I read it critically, but I enjoy  <br/>
reading it).<br/>
<br/>
Expert opinion? Not so much anymore. I used to read a lot of it, but  <br/>
now that unschoolers have been online for so long, there is such an  <br/>
accumulated body of wisdom that I find the ideas of experts are kind  <br/>
of -- well, the word that comes to mind is &quot;puny&quot; -- in comparison.<br/>
