<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084553437">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
As the editor of the new online magazine, *Connections: ezine of <br/>
unschooling and mindful parenting* I&#39;d like to invite and encourage <br/>
unschoolers to submit articles, photos, questions, reviews and inspiring <br/>
emails. Although it&#39;s summer and we&#39;re all out living interesting and <br/>
busy lives, *Connections* is gearing up now for Issue 1 in October, and <br/>
we need to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
My goal as editor of *Connections* is to offer an Unschooling forum that <br/>
showcases *real* unschoolers living *real* unschooling lives, which <br/>
means we need your submissions! We need your photos, your tips for <br/>
resources and reviews and your inspirational stories. *Connections* <br/>
wants to deliver the best unschooling posts from a broad range of <br/>
unschooling elists in our &quot;Hot Topics&quot; section, helping readers who <br/>
don&#39;t have the time to keep up with all the email lists stay connected <br/>
to inspiring ideas and people, and I&#39;d like to invite listowners and <br/>
list members to forward your favorite emails each month for publication <br/>
in *Connections*.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a page dedicated solely to unschooling kids and their <br/>
amazing interests and talents, titled &quot;Mouth Off&quot;--if you have <br/>
unschoolers of any age interested in sharing their thoughts, reviews, <br/>
drawings, photography, whatever, please encourage them to submit! And <br/>
we&#39;re very excited to be offering a debut department for Unschooling <br/>
Dads in our October issue, so dads, we need to hear from you, too! What <br/>
topics would you like to see discussed? What challenges do you face as <br/>
primary caregivers and breadwinners?<br/>
<br/>
Folks are welcome to check out *Connections* for themselves at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a>  Our premier issue 0 is available <br/>
free online, and Issue 1 will be released in October.<br/>
 <br/>
I look forward to hearing from folks! Submission guidelines can be found <br/>
here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org/submissions.html">http://connections.organiclearning.org/submissions.html</a><br/>
