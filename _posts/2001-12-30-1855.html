<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694671529">&lt;&lt;Can anyone write with both hands at once &gt;&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
I can to a certain extent, but it&#39;s better/easier if I don&#39;t look at my <br/>
hands or what I&#39;m writing.  James Garfield supposedly could write Latin with <br/>
one hand and Greek with the other at the same time.  Now, just give that one <br/>
a try.  I can&#39;t even write two different English words at the same time.<br/>
