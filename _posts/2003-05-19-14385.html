fresh air it IS when I do get an e-mail from AlwaysLearning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393239243">When I lived in Alaska I had a wonderful friend named Cindy.   I still<br/>
have her but now I live in Montana and she lives in Arkansas.   I used to<br/>
go to her house, when I was single and before I had Dylan, and we would<br/>
make a big fire and take off our shoes and sit on her bed drinking wine,<br/>
and talk about everything.<br/>
<br/>
After I moved we&#39;d call, then we found instant messaging.   Her computer<br/>
died, and her husband has changed jobs recently so they&#39;re not yet in a<br/>
position to get another one.   I&#39;m really missing talking with her<br/>
whenever I want.<br/>
<br/>
Cindy never had children.  She loves Dylan and thinks of all kinds of<br/>
reasons to send him special little things.  This spring he received a big<br/>
box of Arkansas wonders.   She sent cuttings of poke salad and magnolia. <br/>
She sent seed pods from the sweet gum trees.   She sent a mud dauber&#39;s<br/>
nest, and some snake skin she&#39;d found in her shed.  Shed in her shed?<br/>
<br/>
We do write letters to each other.  I send her illustrated letters or<br/>
sometimes tell her our days and doings in ballad form.  She writes then<br/>
folds it into little origami animals.<br/>
<br/>
I miss talking to her, but she doesn&#39;t have a phone.<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen her in two years.   I just wrote her a letter and stuffed<br/>
the envelope with downy little feathers from my pigeon.  Maybe I should<br/>
have put a Claritin in there too.<br/>
<br/>
My e-mail is wonky tonight and I&#39;m getting posts out of sequence or not<br/>
at all and that&#39;s made things on that other list even more bizarre.  It&#39;s<br/>
more interesting this way. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
But now I still have half a bottle of merlot and no fire place, no big<br/>
bed to sit on that isn&#39;t filled with snoring husband (he has to get up at<br/>
three to go to work) and I can&#39;t find my scissors to practice the<br/>
Japanese art of paper cutting.  It&#39;s snowing here and Dylan is outside in<br/>
the dark, jumping off the front porch steps.   He really wishes he could<br/>
fly.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I&#39;d swing by here and say hi to all the cool moms... see if I<br/>
could creep Kelly out a little&lt;g&gt; and tell you all what a good feeling it<br/>
is to know there are other smart and interesting people in the world like<br/>
Cindy. <br/>

What town does your Cindy live in now?  Too bad she doesn&#39;t have kids, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147021683">Deb,  I&#39;m sorry your friend doesn&#39;t have a phone.<br/>
I got up this morning remembering I had meant to call Wendy and Anne, who <br/>
were driving to Denver last night after an exhausting wedding-weekend in <br/>
Albuquerque where Anne was maid of honor, Wendy was in charge of the bride&#39;s <br/>
elderly mother, who had just been released from the hospital FRIDAY (but who <br/>
made the wedding, AND lit the candle, AND made the reception too!).<br/>
<br/>
I was going to call them and see where they were on the road and talk to help <br/>
keep them awake.  Then Holly asked if I could take her friend home in ten <br/>
minutes, which turned into 25 minutes because they weren&#39;t ready, and then <br/>
Marty and Kirby came home, and then I saw the sink was full of dishes, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t remember to call.   I feel guilty.<br/>
<br/>
When someone doesn&#39;t have a phone  I feel helpless.  I&#39;m sorry your friend <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a phone right now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to call Helena, in London, too, but I think of it when it&#39;s <br/>
too late or too early, and she has a teeny baby so I think I shouldn&#39;t wake <br/>
her up if she&#39;s getting to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
And because I was at the wedding too, playing music, hanging out happily with <br/>
Keith and Holly in Renaissance costumes and seeing some people I rarely get <br/>
to talk to anymore, I didn&#39;t realize until this morning that yesterday was <br/>
also my friend Frank&#39;s birthday, and I had meant to call him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of disjointedness for one morning, and I haven&#39;t even had tea!<br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;ll all understand and not one of them is thinking &quot;That darned <br/>
Sandra didn&#39;t call me,&quot; because they&#39;re all happily busy with THEIR full <br/>
lives too.<br/>
<br/>
Snow in Montana, huh?  Cool!<br/>
<br/>

There&#39;s a cool unschooly co-op school north of Ozark.  We&#39;re looking to <br/>

We bought some land down there on highway 21 a few years ago.  It had an<br/>
old farm house on it, a nice old oak timber frame, but some jackass<br/>
burned it down a couple of years ago.    We&#39;ll eventually build something<br/>

I&#39;ve been sewing medieval crap and cooking medieval food for a medieval thing <br/>
I don&#39;t even want to go to and so in between times, while bread&#39;s rising and <br/>
someone else is doing his or her part of clothes-counting, gathering, I&#39;m <br/>
sitting down here in a cool place hoping my foot won&#39;t get too fat.  <br/>
<br/>
But it will.<br/>

I don&#39;t have long days these days, just days until the foot says &quot;That Is <br/>

Jocelyn was one of the charter members here, and Joyce and Pam/both Pams, and <br/>
Kelly L. and several others, kinda rolled over into the next room en masse.   <br/>
<br/>
There were three groups started in that season, around the same month or two, <br/>
I think.  Two got up to about 30 members or so, did a bit of meanness and <br/>
evil, and died off or were made secret.  This one could have been temporary <br/>
if it had needed to be, but it kinda stayed.    It&#39;s very quiet sometimes, <br/>
and then sometimes (this probably wasn&#39;t the last and wasn&#39;t the first) I mix <br/>
it up with something else, because I just do.<br/>
<br/>
Truly sorry for having a vacuous spot.<br/>

This is the Always Learning list.  I&#39;m responding to a post from Kelly.<br/>
I hope.<br/>
<br/>
Spring needs to be coordinated then, because we&#39;re planning to go to Ohio in <br/>
the spring.  But Ohio will still be there, so Kelly if you get planned first <br/>
I&#39;ll stay here and wait for you!<br/>
<br/>
Montana, Utah, California, Arizona and New Mexico ALL?<br/>
<br/>
Wow. I could be on the way to Arizona from you.  If I were the first stop, I <br/>
could go on to Ohio while you keep saying &quot;These states are BIG!  What were <br/>
we THINKING!?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so mixed up!!! Which list is which? LMAO Can someone out there define <br/>
which list belongs to or was started by who? I like all the lists that have <br/>
any info that makes our lives simpler and validated. So thank you to all of <br/>
you that have taken the time to start a list, moderate a list, post to a list <br/>
and even lurk on a list.  I love having the ability to hop on and post here, <br/>
there and everywhere and walk away from the puter knowing somewhere in <br/>
cyberspace sits another unschooling family who has been there done that and <br/>
is willing to share.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to all of you!<br/>
