<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827375752">I don&#39;t think Sandra needs defending, so this is not<br/>
really a defense.  I&#39;m just offering my experiences<br/>
for perusal.  Although I have not been active much<br/>
lately, perhaps some people remember me.  I joined the<br/>
infamous dotcomedy routine when there were only<br/>
something like three people there, and my first<br/>
message was asking where everyone was, only to learn<br/>
the list was only a few days old.  Then a couple of<br/>
years later Sandra started this list for us refugees<br/>
who were sick of the ol&#39; duck and cover over there.  <br/>
<br/>
In all that time on the other list, and here, I can&#39;t<br/>
say that I have experienced Sandra to be<br/>
sanctimonious, unschoolier-than-thou, or self<br/>
righteous.  She can be very passionate, which some<br/>
people misunderstand or just plain can&#39;t deal with.  I<br/>
can certainly sympathize from personal experience of<br/>
having my passion misconstrued, or just being attacked<br/>
for passionatly sharing my beliefs or opinions or<br/>
experiences.  But I certainly think it&#39;s worth noting<br/>
that on this list, we just plain have never had a<br/>
firestorm that I recall, and this is Sandra&#39;s list. <br/>
It&#39;s not censored, and she&#39;s not a list nazi, and we<br/>
are free to share differing opinions.  So that seems<br/>
incontrovertible proof that the true self-righteous<br/>
troublemakers are residing elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to the new Pamela, I can understand how much<br/>
nervousness and trepidation are involved in entering a<br/>
new social arena and how easy it can be to make<br/>
innocent blunders.  You are not unwanted.  But be<br/>
aware, this is not really a list for beginners to<br/>
learn about Unschooling, as I am sure that Sandra gets<br/>
tired of reiterating.  This is the safe place for old<br/>
hats to support each other in a lifestyle that we all<br/>
understand.  Beginners are welcome, if they understand<br/>
that this is not really the place to couch questions<br/>
in terms of &quot;Does this really work?&quot;  and &quot;How will my<br/>
kids learn anything?&quot;  There are a lot of other places<br/>
for that.  This is a much needed, friendly, back door<br/>
respite for those who really GROK Unschooling as a<br/>
lifestyle and don&#39;t want to argue or reinvent the<br/>
wheel.  You are welcome, of course, to that same kind<br/>
of everyday commisseration and support.  There really<br/>
is a lot to be learned just from osmosis, as it were,<br/>
from all the fabulous Unschoolers here, and lots of<br/>
moral support and pep to be gleaned from folks&#39;<br/>
everyday sharingings.  Just don&#39;t expect this list to<br/>
be what it is not intended to be.<br/>
