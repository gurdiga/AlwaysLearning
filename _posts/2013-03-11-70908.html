<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621659673">Hello Everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I just messaged the following to Sandra privately, and she asked me to share it hear, in case it might benefit somebody reading it here.  I&#39;m happy to do so, and here is the message I sent.  I edited it just a tiny bit, because I originally meant it as a private message, and so was being conversational, but this, essentially is what I told Sandra:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is making me a better musician!  Have you heard that one before?  It&#39;s true, for me.  In the past, I used to approach my practice in a very methodical way.  People talk about &quot;playing&quot; a musical instrument, but I didn&#39;t used to &quot;play&quot; with the sounds I was making.  I was always worried:  about tone, articulation, dynamics, tempo, and on and on.  Even though I&#39;m a very playful person in some ways, I used to feel too inhibited to really &quot;play&quot; music.  I didn&#39;t want to be wrong or to fail.  Now, I find, more and more, I am able to improvise, to play around with sounds.  I&#39;m regaining my joy, and expressing it, and sharing it.  It&#39;s something I have long wished I could do, and I&#39;m so happy that I&#39;m starting to be able to now.  Thank you!  <br/>

I love this and I want to save it, but it seems I have no place on my site to put it. <br/>
<br/>
What!??  <br/>
<br/>
I know discussions of practicing instruments have come up before, and about learning as adults, and about the difference between &quot;practicing&quot; and PLAYING.<br/>
<br/>
Where are they?  I&#39;m sadly suspicious that they were on unschooling.com&#39;s long-gone message board or similarly long-gone unschooling.info&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
So if anyone feels like searching (archives here?  Unschooling Discussion archives? ) I would love to have some links.<br/>
<br/>
Or if people feel like recreating the fifth wheel (wheel of fifths joke; not a very good one) and lay out all the good ideas you have right here, in this topic, I will be on standby to collect the good parts and have a page to showcase the beautiful thing Kelly Sturman has written.<br/>
