<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263084893">I&#39;ve been busy and have not posted in quite some time,<br/>
but I thought this was an interesting discussion and<br/>
thought I would chime in.<br/>

&gt;would have absolutely no problem following them,<br/>
&gt;because they are also reasonable. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, but by whose definition reasonable?  Cultural<br/>
differences, physical differences and personal<br/>
prefernaces can make a rule seem nonsensical to you,<br/>
but of varying degrees of importance to someone else,<br/>
perhaps of great importance.  In general I encourage<br/>
my children to be good guests by abiding by the rules<br/>
of their hosts.  If they are onerous rules, I doubt<br/>
anyone would want to be a guest long, if they choose<br/>
to be at all.  It&#39;s also important to me to help my<br/>
children learn to be good hosts, who in my opinion,<br/>
try to make their guests as comfortable as possible<br/>
within the scope of their lifestyle.  <br/>
<br/>
We keep a pretty casual social circle, so friends in<br/>
general are free to question us if they think a<br/>
practice we have may be strange or a &quot;rule&quot;<br/>
nonsensical.  More likely it&#39;s our lack of &quot;rules&quot;<br/>
which people question, but one example might be that<br/>
we have some dangerous allergies in our home and as a<br/>
result we used to ask (when our kids were younger and<br/>
needed more oversight) that no one offer food to our<br/>
kids without letting us know, unless they are very<br/>
good friends, well acquainted with their allergies. <br/>
Now they are old enough to ask people for themselves<br/>
what is in a food and clarify with us if they are not<br/>
sure if they can eat it without being sick.  We also<br/>
had to police the snacks that friends brought to the<br/>
house to a certain degree, asking that they not snack<br/>
on messy nut mixes or eggy pastries for instance,<br/>
without washing their hands well with soap afterwards,<br/>
or just not eat them in our house at all, if they had<br/>
a tendancy to drop bits on the floor.  We asked that<br/>
kids at the house for playdates not be allowed to run<br/>
around with dangerous allergen foods in their hands or<br/>
on their clothes and that they wash up after eating<br/>
such, which we often had to do for the guest kids<br/>
ourselves, as the other parents, not accustomed to<br/>
thinking about it, would forget to pay attention to<br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
Having never had a child who has had numerous<br/>
alaphylactic shock reactions to various foods, merely<br/>
from skin contact in some cases, and very close calls<br/>
with agressive ER intervention, like ours, most people<br/>
thought we were eccentric and anal, to say the least. <br/>
But if they had decided that our rules were not<br/>
reasonable because they could not see the danger or<br/>
thought we exaggerated it, they didn&#39;t stay guests<br/>
long.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;However, if you put a big dish m&ms down in front of<br/>
&gt;my kids and said &quot;these m&ms are for adults who are<br/>
&gt;over 50 years old only and no one else may touch<br/>
&gt;them, I have no reason for that rule, I just do it<br/>
&gt;because I like to control people&quot;, both my children<br/>
&gt;and I would probably find some reason to leave rather<br/>
&gt;quickly and would also probably find a store pretty<br/>
&gt;quickly to buy our own m&ms.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a very likely or realistic scenario to back up a<br/>
position of reasonable civil disobedience.  Do you<br/>
have any more realistic examples from experience?  I<br/>
also noticed that you said you would leave and get<br/>
your own M&Ms, not that you would disobey the rule set<br/>
forth and have the kids help themselves regardless<br/>
when their host was not looking, or even that you<br/>
would get some for them and hand them over.  So you<br/>
are still obeying the rule.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Other times we fudge things a bit so they can<br/>
&gt;participate (like saying Janene is in 1st grade this<br/>
&gt;year so she can be a Girl Scout Brownie, when she<br/>
&gt;really would be, if she were in school, a K.  Or<br/>
&gt;saying Lexie is 9, instead of 8, so she can <br/>
&gt;participate as a pre-teen at the conference.) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you have described is teaching your children to<br/>
be dishonest in order to get what they want, the ends<br/>
justifying the means.  I&#39;m not attacking you, really<br/>
Joylyn, I just am curious as to why you think the<br/>
above is a better approach than teaching them to<br/>
standing up for themselves and openly question the<br/>
standing rule, or even refusing to participate in a<br/>
situation that excludes or limits them based on false<br/>
qualifiers like a 1 year age difference.  Why not try<br/>
to opnely challenge, stretch, change or topple the<br/>
existing policy, even if just for your small girl<br/>
scout troup, rather than use subterfuge?  I would<br/>
think it would be a much more usefull experience for<br/>
them in the honesty of being true to their principles,<br/>
the subtleties of interpersonal politics, group<br/>
structures and even legal issues, if age limits are in<br/>
regards to those, than a lesson in misleading others. <br/>

some of the pre-teen things, they would have gone along with it and you could <br/>
model honesty.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honesty can and does work.<br/>
There is a junior lifeguard program at our beach in the summer for <br/>
kids 9 and up, but last summer my 8yo wanted to do it with his older <br/>
brother and friends.  Everyone we knew said &quot;Just lie about his <br/>
age... what&#39;s the big deal?&quot; but it didn&#39;t sit right with me, <br/>
especially since my children were watching/listening and honesty is <br/>
*very* high up on my list of priorities.<br/>
I spoke to someone in charge aboug how my 8yo was a very good <br/>
swimmer and socially mature for his age, and pointed out that if he <br/>
was over his head he would stop going, and even *that* person told <br/>
me to just lie about his age on the application!<br/>
I decided to fill out the application with his real age and <br/>
birthdate (as if he had every right to be there despite being <br/>
younger) and nobody ever said anything.  It was possible that his <br/>
age was just overlooked, but hey, at least I was honest! :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This part of the post bothered me too.<br/>
I was imagining a child having to live a lie and maybe be put in a <br/>
potition to have to keep up the lie.  In kid groups, questions get <br/>
asked, friendships form.  I would be annoyed and put off by someone <br/>
who lied to get into something I was running.<br/>
My daughter is in charge of a drama group for kids. It&#39;s totally run <br/>
by kids.   It&#39;s suppose to be a teen group, but they lowered the age <br/>
down to 9 to get more kids.<br/>
If someone came to her and said I&#39;m 8 and really want to do this, she <br/>
would say yes if she thought they were mature enough, or &quot;sorry you <br/>
have to be 9&quot; if she thought they weren&#39;t.  If someone lied and she <br/>
found out, I know she would feel angry.  I sure would.<br/>
