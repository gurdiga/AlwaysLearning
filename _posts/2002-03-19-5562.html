<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783848857">Maybe it&#39;s an epidemic!  Dylan&#39;s cleaning his, too.  He and his dad built<br/>
a lovely bookshelf for our dining room.  The bookshelf, it turns out, was<br/>
just the right size to fit at the top of the stairs in Dylan&#39;s room so<br/>
there it is. (I&#39;m still confused as to how that happened.) But he&#39;s been<br/>
up there rearranging books and putting things away.    Good thing there&#39;s<br/>
a table in the dining room for that stack of books and the microscope and<br/>
the plate of deceased bugs from Arkansas and the Legos.  Good thing we<br/>
usually eat in front of the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Dh has been off work for a few weeks ( sounds like he&#39;s quitting a drug<br/>
habit ) and we&#39;ve been busy going and doing.   We&#39;re expecting lots of<br/>
company for my moms 80th birthday next week.  The news of their arrival<br/>
came just as we began a remodel of our kitchen.   Maybe, if they get<br/>
hungry enough, the work will get done faster?  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you&#39;re brave!   I know that list needs your voice, and I&#39;m glad<br/>
you joined again.  I have considered going back but the thought of<br/>
listening to people complain about all the things that are wrong with<br/>
their kids turns my stomach.   I think debates about what is or isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling are wonderful.  I think the more talk there is the more<br/>
opportunity for new people to get a clear picture, sooner.  I just can&#39;t<br/>
stand the folks who pile disorders on their  kids as an excuse for their<br/>
parenting.   Lots of questioning parents there will benefit from your<br/>
wisdom.  Good for you.   ( And get yourself some Malox ) <br/>

It&#39;s SPRING cleaning!<br/>
At least it&#39;s Spring where I am.<br/>
We&#39;re doing some cleaning, too.<br/>

around this time of year.<br/>
