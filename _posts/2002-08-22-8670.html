Subj:   Accelerated Unschooling<br/>
Date:   Thursday, August 22, 2002 8:57:49 AM<br/>
From:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kaymarchant@...">kaymarchant@...</a><br/>
To:     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I spoke to an acquaintance, Katherine Baptista, who mentioned you were <br/>
interested in information about Accelerated Unschooling. She provided your <br/>
e-mail address. She mentioned that you were a Traditional Unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Like Traditional Unschooling, Accelerated Unschooling understands that <br/>
children are best able to determine their interests and talents and gifts. <br/>
People are naturally drawn to activities and topics that fit their <br/>
personalities<br/>
<br/>
Accelerated Unschooling addresses concerns that many parents have about <br/>
Traditional Unschooling, particularly motivation. Many children and adults <br/>
have very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but limited <br/>
resources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from <br/>
pursuing them. Accelerated Unschooling allows the parent to take control of <br/>
the motivation piece. This is especially important for children who are <br/>
Gifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling <br/>
allows them to reach their potentials.<br/>
<br/>
My personal experience with Accelerated Unschooling has been particularly <br/>
dramatic. I have four children, three boys and a girl, from age 7 to 14. My <br/>
three oldest children are highly gifted, and since we have begun Accelerated <br/>
Unschooling, they have excelled in all of their areas of giftedness (Math <br/>
and science, instrumental music, art, and writing). My youngest adopted son, <br/>
who is not Gifted, has also benefited, as he is exposed to many different <br/>
activities, and wastes fs exposed to <br/>
many things, become a genuine Accelerated Unschooler. Presently he expresses <br/>
interest in very little, so we are remedially exposing him to many areas.)<br/>
<br/>
Accelerated Unschooling is becoming more popular. I attended a workshop with <br/>
its inventors, Conrad and Lydia Menapolit, in California, and it has changed <br/>
our lives. We are hoping that Conrad and Lydia will be doing more workshops, <br/>
but they are presently in Austria writing a book about Accelerated <br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if I can tell you more.<br/>

Goodness, how insulting. Like the Head Start program,<br/>
for culterally &quot;deprived&quot; kids.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose  strewing is not organized enough, or maybe<br/>
it doesn&#39;t enhance the areas identified as being in<br/>
need of forcing, I mean accelerating.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about that term &quot;Traditional Unschooling&quot;? :-) How<br/>
long does something exist before it is traditional? <br/>
What makes anything be traditioanal?  What is a<br/>
tradition, exactly?  Traditional Unschooling.<br/>
Interesting perspective. Although if it is modified<br/>
(acceralted) unschooling, it isn&#39;t any kind of<br/>
unschooling anymore. It is something else, such as a<br/>
personalized curriculum, with an incorrect title.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if they have a TV problem  &gt;:-)  Meeow<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-171782482">Ok, I&#39;m ready to act like a grown up for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
***Like Traditional Unschooling, Accelerated Unschooling understands that<br/>
<br/>
children are best able to determine their interests and talents and<br/>
gifts. ***<br/>
<br/>
Would it be such a stretch then, to believe children are also best able<br/>
to decide which projects they will pursue at which pace, and which<br/>
&quot;gifts&quot; and &quot;talents&quot; they  would like to develop?   If she believes they<br/>
are able to determine for themselves what is interesting, why then<br/>
doesn&#39;t she believe they will explore it for themselves when they&#39;re<br/>
ready?<br/>
<br/>
***Accelerated Unschooling allows the parent to take control of <br/>
the motivation piece.***<br/>
<br/>
Why is motivation not something that can be learned naturally as well? <br/>
If  people aren&#39;t pursuing a thing, does it have to be laziness or<br/>
procrastination?  Couldn&#39;t it just be lack of interest?  And if children<br/>
are best able to determine their own interests,  why would a parent need<br/>
to &quot;take control of the motivation piece&quot;? <br/>
Was she an unschooling parent before the accelerated thing?  Was she<br/>
unaware of her ability to HELP her kids get to music lessons if THEY<br/>
wanted to go?  Did she not know she could go get movies for them, buy<br/>
them books, games, puzzles,  toys, etc, if they WANTED them?   Did she<br/>
not know children who live with interesting people who do interesting<br/>
things will be interested in doing everything???   Where was she before<br/>
she accelerated?   At a dead stop, I&#39;m thinking.   Didn&#39;t she know<br/>
somewhere in between is &quot;at their own pace?&quot;   And if they are gifted and<br/>
talented why wouldn&#39;t that be good enough.   <br/>
<br/>
The rest of her letter gets more horrible the more I read it.   Labeling,<br/>
defining and categorizing a seven year old is just so deeply wrong, and<br/>
so sickening for a parent to do that I can&#39;t find words.  This mother<br/>
should  see a psychologist right now (accelerate! Don&#39;t procrastinate!)<br/>
to find out exactly why she needs to put these labels, limits and<br/>
expectations on her children and to find out before it&#39;s too late how to<br/>
undo the damage she has already inflicted on poor little seven year old,<br/>
ungifted, adopted Nate, and the others.    God, I&#39;m still feeling sick<br/>
over that one.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Kay,<br/>
Thank you so much for the information about Accelerated Unschooling and <br/>
it&#39;s remarkable distinction to Traditional Unschooling.  I&#39;m am curious to <br/>
learn more.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, being neither gifted, talented nor accelerated like <br/>
yourself, you may have to speak real slow and use smaller words.  As a <br/>
Traditional Unschooler, I lacked the motivation to learn and now I don&#39;t <br/>
know any of the big ones.  Amazingly, Procrastination and Laziness are <br/>
indeed our middle names!  As a matter of fact, should Social Services find <br/>
out about our total lack of initiative and motivation, they&#39;d probably try <br/>
to take the children away - excepting of course that the total inertial <br/>
mass, which I believe to be centered in the middle of our living room as <br/>
evidenced by the pile of kids, toys and dishes, is so great that it is more <br/>
likely that the nice Social Services people will be unable to pull away <br/>
should they stop moving at any time during their visit.  They&#39;ll be stuck <br/>
here for years.  Thankfully, we have plenty of sofas, so they&#39;ll be <br/>
comfortable at least.<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned though, to hear that you are exposing your youngest adopted <br/>
son in many areas.  While there are some families who believe in the nudist <br/>
or natural way of living and some people enjoy &#39;flashing&#39; others, general <br/>
society frowns on such naturalism.  As a matter of fact, there was someone <br/>
arrested locally for exactly just such behavior.  I thought I should <br/>
mention it, in case it had not yet come up.<br/>
<br/>
It is especially delightful that AU (may I call it AU?) is becoming more <br/>
popular and that they are actually doing workshops with it&#39;s inventors!  I <br/>
went to a workshop once where Ron Popiel demonstrated a knife he&#39;d invented <br/>
that was also a juicer and that could cut through cans too.  I ended up not <br/>
buying one because I don&#39;t have much call for cutting through juice cans, <br/>
but it sure was impressive!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be pleased if you would quickly tell me more about Accelerated <br/>
Unschooling.  Quickly please, before my motivation runs dry!<br/>
Yours,<br/>
(signed)<br/>

Not really.<br/>

Even legally speaking, people can put aside their biological children.   They <br/>
can relinquish parental rights, or disown an older child.<br/>

So there is a biological reality separate from the legal, and in this case <br/>
this boy doesn&#39;t have the biological &quot;advantage&quot; of the giftedness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409983113">&quot;Accelerated Unschooling&quot; promises to solve the &quot;motivation concern&quot; by assigning<br/>
it to the parent who will then help the child to realize their own full<br/>
potential.  The problem with that is that there quite simply is no motivation<br/>
problem.  It appears to be a dishonet use of the language to get a child to do<br/>
what the parent wants the child to do.<br/>
<br/>
Today, my daughter mostly watched TV.  She was offered a variety of other choices<br/>
and chose to watch TV with occasional cartwheel breaks.  She has a cold and she<br/>
is dealing with a friendship that isn&#39;t going well right now.  Today, she is<br/>
highly motivated to zone out and watch TV.  It&#39;s not even possible for me to<br/>
&quot;take control of the motivation piece&quot;.  If I tried to force it, it would be MY<br/>
motivation she would be responding to, not hers.  Just how can someone possibly<br/>
&quot;take control of the motivation piece&quot; for another person?  It&#39;s nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Traditional unschooling&quot; aka as actual Unschooling can, perhaps, be<br/>
&quot;accelerated&quot; but it would have to be the learner&#39;s foot pushing the gas pedal or<br/>
it can&#39;t honestly even be considered unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I can see, however, that Accelerated Unschooling has some appeal for the<br/>
frustrated parent, particularly those of us whose children who have been in<br/>
school and haven&#39;t yet found their way to self-direction.  Personally, I&#39;d rather<br/>
take math or history away from her (if that were even possible) than to deprive<br/>
her of her &quot;motivation piece&quot;.<br/>

you won&#39;t be able to draw her out and find out more! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
How about:<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m a little confused. To me a foundational part of unschooling is<br/>
allowing the blossom to unfold in its own time. This sounds like an arborist<br/>
unfolding a blossom which feels like more about serving the arborist&#39;s needs<br/>
than the blossom&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a pretty good cook but I don&#39;t cook often. Some would look at me and<br/>
probably say I&#39;m lazy. I might even call myself lazy sometimes. But more<br/>
often I&#39;d say the trouble involved in cooking the way I like isn&#39;t worth<br/>
giving up other things that are more interesting and more satisfying for me.<br/>
And I know I&#39;d resent it if my husband saw cooking potential in me and<br/>
decided I needed classes and books and all sorts of other things to help me<br/>
reach my cooking potential.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense? How would it be different for a child?<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not sure how this fits in with the unschooling philosophy. It seems<br/>
to be ignoring an essential aspect, like ignoring the part about eating<br/>
vegetables in vegetarianism! ;-) I guess I might see it as Accelerated<br/>
Interest-led Learning, but accelerated and unschooling seem to me to<br/>
contradict each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Many children and adults<br/>
&gt; have very strong gifts and interests that they&#39;d like to pursue, but limited<br/>
&gt; resources, and, even more, procrastination or laziness keep them from<br/>
&gt; pursuing them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think getting around limited resources is just part of homeschooling. We<br/>
help the kids get what they need. I don&#39;t see unschooling handicapping<br/>
children&#39;s access to resources. Getting them access to resources is a part<br/>
of unschooling. Unless I&#39;m not understanding what you&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is especially important for children who are<br/>
&gt; Gifted or Talented, but who often lack motivation. Accelerated Unschooling<br/>
&gt; allows them to reach their potentials.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was a lengthy discussion recently about being gifted on the<br/>
Unschooling.com message boards. There wasn&#39;t a single person who was<br/>
identified as gifted as a child who said they appreciated having the<br/>
pressure to perform to their potential. They all felt they were being asked<br/>
to meet external milestones and move in directions others wanted them to<br/>
apply their talents in rather than being able to develop who they were. They<br/>
felt they were moved in the direction of their talents rather than being<br/>
alowed to move in the direction of their interests.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m good at math -- got a degree in electical engineering --, good at<br/>
drawing, writing, science, computers. Others looking at those skills would<br/>
have very definite ideas about what I should be doing. But I&#39;d bet they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t match what I *enjoy* doing with my life! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So how do you avoid confusing what you want for your children with what they<br/>
want for themselves? That&#39;s been one of the hard parts of unschooling for<br/>
me: realizing that my seemingly reasonable goals for my daughter hamper her<br/>
goals for herself. And what it&#39;s taken me a long time to come to grips with<br/>
is that it&#39;s the journey that counts, not the destination. In life, no<br/>
matter how goal oriented we are, we never really seem to &quot;get there.&quot; We&#39;re<br/>
always on the path, not enjoying the path because we&#39;re tying to get<br/>
somewhere. But we never get there!<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of how offbeat the path is that my daughter chooses, she&#39;ll be on<br/>
the path she wants to be on. Where she goes on that path -- or paths -- I&#39;m<br/>
coming to see, isn&#39;t so important as enjoying being on the path and being<br/>
able to go at whatever pace suits her and having the freedom to divert off<br/>
onto another path if she stumbles on something more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
See, to me that&#39;s unschooling. It&#39;s what John Holt discussed in his books.<br/>
This &quot;accelerated&quot; unschooling seems to be about deciding some paths are<br/>
more important than others and channeling the children along those paths and<br/>
determining what&#39;s an optimal pace for them. That&#39;s pretty much what I<br/>
wanted to avoid by not sending my daughter to school!<br/>
<br/>
Unless theres&#39;s something about this I&#39;m not understanding.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Presently he expresses<br/>
&gt; interest in very little, so we are remedially exposing him to many areas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though I&#39;ve seen plenty of kids who express little interest in things adults<br/>
can brag to the neightbors about, I&#39;ve never seen a kid who is interested in<br/>
very little! ;-) <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found truly astounding is the areas that seemingly nonsensical<br/>
&quot;waste of time&quot; interests like Pokemon, cartoons and video games have opened<br/>
up for my daughter. They are sort of like entryways to the rest of the world<br/>
for her. She may not pursue them to the depth that would satisfy me, but if<br/>
she&#39;s left with good feelings about what she did explore, then I know she<br/>
will return to it when it&#39;s more meaningful for her.<br/>
<br/>
Though I could encourage or make her write and draw to reach what others<br/>
might judge as her full potential, it&#39;s by doing things in her own way at<br/>
her own pace that is taking her into unexplored territory. She sees things<br/>
in ways that no one else ever has.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not, of course, holding her back from more traditionaly routes. She<br/>
takes classes but right now it&#39;s apparently important to her to be with<br/>
teachers who encourage kids to follow their own paths rather than do things<br/>
the &quot;right way&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just not seeing how &quot;full potential&quot; can ever be free from others&#39; ideas<br/>
of whether someone else is there or not. How can I judge that my daughter&#39;s<br/>
comics are not at her full potential if she&#39;s doing what she wants to?<br/>
Following what she wants in the way she wants in the time frame she wants<br/>
seems to me to be essential to unschooling.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Makes you think the social services didn&#39;t check this mother out very well<br/>
before placing the kid. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the house was clean and they had money and education, and nobody was dirty <br/>
or neglected, what would there to have been to question?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad, but her ungifted child is probably better off there than 95% or <br/>
better of other places he could be.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It did give me an idea... I&#39;m thinking of doing a &quot;motivation piece&quot; for <br/>
the<br/>
 living room, so that then whoever wants to take the motivation piece can do<br/>
 so for as long as they like. We could pass it around. Hang it on the wall<br/>
 when not needed. Let the dogs play with it (they are Gifted and Talented<br/>
 too.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It could be like a &quot;round tuit&quot;.  (A circular piece similar to a pog with the <br/>
phrase &#39;round tuit&#39; printed on it.)    &quot;I&#39;ll do so-and-so when I get a round <br/>
tuit.&quot;    Anybody else remember those?  My stepfather gave me one of those <br/>
years ago.  He&#39;s always been in sales........ah the motivational world.  :-)<br/>
