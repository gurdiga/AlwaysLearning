Duplo Zoo, or another Duplo set might be fun.  Or Lego, since the  <br/>
younger one is four (depending on his interests and abilities.<br/>
<br/>
DVDs of  Music.  Raffi in Concert was played about to the nub at our  <br/>
house.  Enchanted.  Disney movies you might not have (musicals, I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking--Little Mermaid, Aladdin).    Those would be easy for  <br/>
grandparents to find and feel good about giving.<br/>
<br/>
For grandmother gifts, things they could both play with might be  <br/>
cool, which is why I&#39;m thinking Lego/Duplo.<br/>

<br/>
You guys, it&#39;s Christmas.  We&#39;re talking total surprises.  It&#39;s  <br/>
boring (and often very frustrating) for kids to say what they want  <br/>
and then either get it (duh) or not (wah).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ask my kids what they want.  I&#39;ve been paying attention to  <br/>
what they&#39;ve wanted all year.  And this year everyone&#39;s stuff will be  <br/>
a surprise to everyone else (the kids anyway), so they can all have  <br/>
more surprises.  And everyone&#39;s gift is something the others will  <br/>
benefit from, too or can use sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Surprises are good.<br/>

<br/>
  that&#39;s interesting - we also give many surprises for holiday / birthday gifts, but one thing both of my kids really enjoy - and has become part of the season&#39;s tradition in our family - is making their wish lists.  my son has an elaborate process of conceiving of and then &quot;rating&quot; in order of priority, his desires.....<br/>
<br/>
  my daughter this year really wanted her room painted (it was freshly painted a few years ago with colors she chose when we moved in, and was not in &quot;need&quot; of paint) and also wanted to &quot;feel  more like an adult&quot; this year at christmas, and proposed that her gift be getting her room re-painted.  and she really didn&#39;t want to wait 3 months to get it done, so we had it painted in september and she wants to just enjoy the christmas experience with a few gifts from relatives and her brother, and not the mound under the tree she has historically enjoyed as a &quot;child&quot; at christmas.  these differenentiations are hers, on  her path toward maturation, not ours, to be clear.  <br/>
<br/>
  anyhow - surprises are always appreciated, but a healthy mix of surprises and specific requests being granted goes over best in our family!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have been having this same issue.  Alex already asked &quot;what do your KIDS want?&quot;.  I have known what my kids want, for years, it has been art supplies, or a scooter or skateboard, or soccer ball, things like that.  My problem is that I haven&#39;t gotten past my issue of asking for something.  We are in financial crisis though, and some of our family isn&#39;t.  Unfortunately, I grew up being shamed for wanting anything, and i&#39;m trying to get past this for my children.  I&#39;d love for them to have a nice x-mas present (ours will happily come from the dollar store again this year), and I know some of the grandparents can get them something nicer.  problem is, I already know they are thinking toys.  They have plenty, and they have told me they would love art &quot;stuff&quot;, and a soccer ball.  I honestly don&#39;t know how to mention that they would rather have these things.  They ask it like &quot;what sort of toys do they want?&quot;  The fact is they don&#39;t WANT a toy.  How would some of you approach this?  I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m greedy in asking for something other than toys.  We could really use things like pencils, notebooks, plain paper, construction paper, I just am having a problem with HOW to ask for something other than what THEY want to give.  I know I need to put on my Big Girl Pants....I just don&#39;t know how to approach this.<br/>
Hope this isn&#39;t considered a post hijack!  I guess I need to know just like Jenny!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids: toys that teach, toys that last, books, art supplies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does it have to be a wish list of a homeschooled kid?  Why can&#39;t it<br/>
be a list of things they want.  We got an add from Walmart the other day<br/>
and Margaux went through it and circled everything she wanted from it. <br/>
I think it would have been easier to just cross of the things she didn&#39;t<br/>
want! ; )<br/>
<br/>
I have this weird repulsion to toys that teach, especially those geared<br/>
towards toddlers.  Not that there is anything inherently wrong with<br/>
learning the ABC&#39;s and your 123&#39;s, but toddlers like cause and effect<br/>
things wether they repeat ABC or not.<br/>
<br/>
It would help enormously if you were to tell us what kind of things your<br/>
kids are into and like already.  I could say that my children are into<br/>
&quot;xyz&quot; and tell you the kind of things that we&#39;ve gotten for that, but it<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t be relevant at all to what your kids are into.</div>

find things the kids will love and appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
But ultimately it depends. Sometimes people get this ideal in their  <br/>
heads and they want to make it happen just as they imagine it. If as  <br/>
kids they got practical gifts like new underwear and pencils and  <br/>
paper for Christmas, they might see toys as gifts to themselves as kids.<br/>

<br/>
If I want to give someone a gift, it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;putting on their  <br/>
Big Girl pants&quot; to tell me they want to tell me what to give them.   <br/>
It would be kinda rude.   If I want to give someone something, that&#39;s  <br/>
about ME! &lt;bwg&gt;   If I ask for ideas, that&#39;s different.  That&#39;s  <br/>
turning over  the decision making to some extent, or at least  <br/>
admitting I don&#39;t have a brilliant idea.<br/>
<br/>
Asking for pencils and notebooks and plain paper, whether you mean  <br/>
for it to or not, sounds kinda like asking for toilet paper and dish  <br/>
soap.  Not cool.  Not fun.  Not giftish.  And it seems (though you  <br/>
probably didn&#39;t consciously  mean for it to) that you&#39;re saying &quot;We  <br/>
can&#39;t even afford pencils.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask for nice art supplies, good paper, or think of some toys  <br/>
they might want, or maybe shelves to put toys in or boxes for art  <br/>
supplies.<br/>
<br/>
If you really do need pencils and notebooks and plain paper, go to a  <br/>
thrift store and get some.  I see office supplies at thrift stores  <br/>
all the time.  Ask for them on a freecycle list.  People and offices  <br/>
have extra paper and pencils all the time.<br/>

For as long as we&#39;ve been married (and probably longer), I&#39;ve  pointed things <br/>
out to Dave that I like and that might be a good idea for a  present for me. <br/>
I&#39;ve offered to cut pictures out of catalogs for him to put in  his wallet or <br/>
something. Very, very rarely in over 20 years has he actually  *gotten* me <br/>
something that&#39;s been on my list (but making them is always fun!),  but, as I was <br/>
telling a friend today, he always gets me something I&#39;d never  think of to <br/>
put on my list and I have always been very happy with whatever it  is! I could <br/>
choose to be frustrated and cranky that he &quot;doesn&#39;t listen to me&quot; or  get me <br/>
what I (think I) want, but you know what? It makes me feel very loved  that he <br/>
pays such close attention to me every day that he knows my tastes enough  to <br/>
know what I like without going from a list. :~) I don&#39;t know if my kids feel  <br/>
like that (yet), but I know they like surprises!<br/>

I also see a different perspective in seeing how it must feel from the eyes of the giver.  I&#39;d fee that way too....:)<br/>
<br/>
I feel better, and stronger about how to approach now, they are very different to deal with for me.   I&#39;ve never been surrounded with people such as my in laws, there is always a condition when gifts are given, or things lent, and narcisism (sp?) is their way of living.  They ARE, however, very sweet people.  It confuses me often, as to how to deal with them, without &quot;hurting their feelings&quot; for saying the wrong thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

They&#39;re not inexpensive, but could be a gift for everyone in the family.<br/>

&gt; love them and they are played with in lots of ways, just about  <br/>
&gt; everyday.<br/>
&gt; this year I am going to sit down with the kids and let them make a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218483916">The answer lies in your relationship with the gift-bearer.<br/>
My Aunt Donna gives *wonderful* gifts, thoughtful and generally on sale<br/>
::bg:: from clothing to activities, she wants what she gives to be<br/>
well-suited to the recipient. I can say to her &quot;we&#39;re having a lean year,<br/>
we&#39;d really like to get something special for H&quot; and she&#39;ll do what she can<br/>
to gift something extra special (she&#39;s a mean bargain hunter, special does<br/>
not mean more expensive). I really appreciate the year-round gifts she<br/>
gives, too (i.e. zoo memberships & magazines).  This year I told her H would<br/>
*love* art supplies: canvases, acrylic paints and brushes. It&#39;s an<br/>
investment in her future wall decor ;) For the *regularly stocked* art<br/>
supplies, I quietly reminded my mom while she shopped the back-to-school<br/>
sales (Hayden does love the spiral notebooks; easy gift when they&#39;re 10/$1).<br/>
<br/>
My MIL doesn&#39;t have the same kind of rapport with us & we don&#39;t communicate<br/>
the same way... she sends H a check, he buys what he loves and reports his<br/>
gratitude later.  And that works for them.<br/>
We&#39;ve had *dollar-store holidays* --there are organizations (for us it was<br/>
goodwill&#39;s angel tree program) to help with presents, it was certainly worth<br/>
swallowing my pride to get the kids nice gifts & a stipend for the grocery<br/>
store.<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;d love for them to have a nice x-mas present (ours will happily come<br/>
&gt; from the dollar store again this year), and I know some of the grandparents<br/>
&gt; can get them something nicer. problem is, I already know they are thinking<br/>
&gt; toys. They have plenty, and they have told me they would love art &quot;stuff&quot;,<br/>
&gt; and a soccer ball. I honestly don&#39;t know how to mention that they would<br/>
&gt; rather have these things. They ask it like &quot;what sort of toys do they want?&quot;<br/>
&gt; The fact is they don&#39;t WANT a toy. How would some of you approach this? I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m greedy in asking for something other than toys.<br/>
&gt; We could really use things like pencils, notebooks, plain paper,<br/>
&gt; construction paper, I just am having a problem with HOW to ask for something<br/>
&gt; other than what THEY want to give.<br/>
