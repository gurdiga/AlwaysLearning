This is really interesing.  I liked this, especially:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My classmates formulated their love for the Beatles in the following manner: <br/>
&quot;I would have learnt English in its entirety, exclusively from the things <br/>
that Lennon spoke about.&quot; This was a paraphrase of the words of Mayakovsky <br/>
inscribed on a stand in the literature classroom: &quot;I would have learnt Russian in <br/>
its entirety, exclusively from the things that Lenin spoke about.&quot; In the 1960s, <br/>
you could not be imprisoned for changing the name of Lenin to that of Lennon, <br/>
but trouble awaited anyone who blasphemed against the name of the immortal <br/>
leader: problems dished out by the Komsomol (Communist Union of Youth) could <br/>
wreck your career. And so, bit by bit, we Lennon fans became ensnared in doubting <br/>
the values that the system was trying to inculcate. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you have any interest in the cold war, USSR or Beatles, it&#39;s worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
It was in The Guardian today. (Friday)<br/>
