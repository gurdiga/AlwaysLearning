<div id="ygrps-yiv-125617941">I wanted to share with you all that I have loved reading here the past couple <br/>
of weeks. We have a great deal of diversity here, and I love how that is <br/>
celebrated. There are relatively few places where I feel so comfortable <br/>
sharing details of my family&#39;s life, and find that rather than just being <br/>
tolerated, it is honored.  I also appreciate a place where we can talk about <br/>
our struggles with racism and other isms, and find ways to be with our kids <br/>
so they will have a few less layers of this stuff to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
You are good people, and I am glad you&#39;re out there. Consider that you have a <br/>
friend near Boston if you want to visit.<br/>
