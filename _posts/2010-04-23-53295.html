<div id="ygrps-yiv-412137599">The writing below is by my daughter, Holly Dodd, 18, from her blog.   <br/>
She&#39;s never been to school and except for asking questions and  <br/>
learning from what she saw, hasn&#39;t had any lessons in writing or  <br/>
grammar or spelling.  She&#39;s just lived her life in a rich environment  <br/>
with many people who regarded her as whole and real and who spoke to  <br/>
her as a person.<br/>
<br/>
The people named are Linnea, who is six and is Bea Mantovani&#39;s  <br/>
daughter, and  Adam Daniel, six and is Julie Daniel&#39;s daughter (Holly  <br/>
stayed with them for six weeks last winter).<br/>

Maybe they should be called &quot;page markers&quot;<br/>
I have a bookmark that I made of turquoise and purple paper and box  <br/>
tape.<br/>
<br/>
Linnea asked me what it was, I said it&#39;s a bookmark. She asked where I  <br/>
got it, I said I made it. She asked where I made it, I said upstairs  <br/>
in the kitchen. She asked if she could open it (double sided), I said  <br/>
she could not. She asked why she couldn&#39;t- There were too many answers  <br/>
to give! I think I could have been in a &#39;put it back, please don&#39;t  <br/>
mess with my things&#39; mood, but guess what, I&#39;m not! I said that it&#39;s  <br/>
just what it is, it doesn&#39;t open up. I grabbed a book and opened to a  <br/>
random page and showed Linnea what a bookmark is for. I tried finding  <br/>
a page again without the bookmark, and then with the bookmark. Both of  <br/>
us smiling and giggly. We were sitting next to a box of tissue, I told  <br/>
Linnea that my mom uses kleenex as bookmarks and grabbed another book  <br/>
and marked it! Linnea was amused at how that made the book look and  <br/>
thought it was funny... And understood that it worked the same as any  <br/>
bookmark. And I&#39;m pretty sure she also understood why my bookmark  <br/>
didn&#39;t need any more parts or colors or layers to it.<br/>
<br/>
I got back to what I was doing, computer things (as Adam Daniel would  <br/>
say), while Linnea was still checking it all out and playing with her  <br/>
stuffed toys. Then she stuck my bookmark in one of those books and  <br/>
asked me to guess which page she wanted, of course I opened to some  <br/>
unmarked pages first (since this game doesn&#39;t have rules against  <br/>
that), and we both laughed when I got the right page and we played  <br/>
again. We found a way to play with that bookmark! And a real way, with  <br/>
real books. That was really cool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The books were &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; and &quot;Sixty Million Frenchmen  <br/>
Can&#39;t Be Wrong&quot;-- Both books I have borrowed from Linnea&#39;s parents,  <br/>
and both I have yet to even open... Except to show my friend why I  <br/>
made that bookmark.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052941029">Lovely, just lovely.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just this week&#39;s events, what with the media and some other interactions I&#39;ve had with children (not my own), but I&#39;m sitting here with tears in my eyes.  It is so simple, really.  It takes so little to connect.  Yet, it be some _powerful_ stuff. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Holly.<br/>
Thanks Sandra.<br/>
