<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135581896">Hi, my name is Keti and I&#39;ve been reading on this list for several <br/>
months now at the suggestion of a good friend who has unschooled for <br/>
many years.  I enjoy reading and learning and hearing the multiple <br/>
perspectives shared here.  I have two kids: ds is 17 and dd is 12.  <br/>
We have attended two L&L conferences. The kids have been home for <br/>
three plus years and we have been walking the path of unschooling for <br/>
about a year and a half, enjoying life and watching everyone thrive. <br/>
<br/>
I really need some perspective on a difficult long-standing <br/>
situation.  It relates to my dd&#39;s best friend, A, a girl she met in <br/>
third grade.  A is a cool kid and dd enjoys the relationship.  She&#39;s <br/>
in school and her family is very entrenched in the &quot;culture of <br/>
school&quot; to the point where they view it as the one and ONLY way.  The <br/>
mom has never overtly said she disapproves of how my kids are getting <br/>
an education, nor has she ever asked what we do, however, there is a <br/>
clear feeling of judgment and  disapproval coming from her. <br/>
Consequently, we have distanced ourselves from the family socially <br/>
while allowing my dd and A to continue their friendship.  A is <br/>
completely controlled by her Mom.  She&#39;s overweight and they control <br/>
her food and drink. Couple of years ago the Mom and I had a <br/>
conversation around the &quot;weight problem&quot; and she acknowledged that <br/>
she herself has major food issues.  I suggested then that perhaps <br/>
some counseling for the Mom would be an option.  She seemed open to <br/>
that idea, said she had already considered it, etc.  But, then the <br/>
wall of denial came up and nothing ever happened  the simply <br/>
continued controlling A.  Time passed.  I could see that they were <br/>
not committed to doing anything different and began to distance <br/>
myself from them.  A has a lot of health problems  earlier this year <br/>
they thought it was asthma, but instead it seems to have been anxiety <br/>
attacks at  school.  No surprise there.  All that said, here&#39;s my <br/>
problem. <br/>
<br/>
When A spends time at our house, we let her eat and drink what she <br/>
wants.  Consequently, they don&#39;t want A to be at our house.  So,  the <br/>
only way my daughter can spend time with A is at their house.  I&#39;m  <br/>
uncomfortable with the arrangement  they require the kids to jump on <br/>
the trampoline after eating and other ridiculous things.  They also <br/>
don&#39;t feed my daughter enough food (and apple or a cereal bar is <br/>
considered lunch).  She comes home with low blood sugar and extremely <br/>
irritated. My daughter doesn&#39;t mind the forced &quot;exercise&quot; but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like what they are willing to feed her.  If she sleeps over, <br/>
I usually give her a few protein bars so she has SOMETHING to eat, <br/>
which helps. As an inside joke, my dd and I call their <br/>
home &quot;starvation house.&quot;  She&#39;s willing to tolerate this behavior so <br/>
she can see her friend.  It&#39;s so incredibly sad and heartbreaking.  <br/>
In the past, I&#39;ve discussed with the mom that my daughter is a <br/>
growing girl and she eats a LOT of food and needs it while her body <br/>
is developing and that she&#39;s been hungry at their house.  Still, <br/>
nothing changes.  Sometimes they &quot;forget&quot; to feed the girls.  The <br/>
girls get together much less frequently and the sleepovers are even <br/>
more rare, namely because A always has homework to do.<br/>
<br/>
I have been actively seeking outlets for my daughter to meet new <br/>
friends for the last two years.  I started a local unschooling group <br/>
and we joined a local co-op.  Both of these are new ventures and <br/>
she&#39;s not met any girls around her age.  We talk about the situation <br/>
quite a bit and my daughter struggles with A and her limitations. We <br/>
both very much want for her to develop friends with other unschooled <br/>
or relaxed homeschooled kids.  Just hasn&#39;t happened yet.  My dd has <br/>
talked about getting back into dance classes and I&#39;m optimistic that <br/>
will give her some exposure to new girls to befriend.  We&#39;ll probably <br/>
start this in January.<br/>
<br/>
Given this background, is it worth it for me to, either verbally or <br/>
in writing, broach the subject of controls again (e.g., where is <br/>
affects me and my daughter, like the trampoline or going hungry) with <br/>
the Mom?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to tell her how disrespectful it is to constantly call A <br/>
when she&#39;s out with us and ask her what she ate, where she is, what <br/>
she&#39;s doing, etc.  This happened twice last night in a three hour <br/>
period  it was a very rare occasion when A came to dinner with us.  <br/>
I think the girls are good enough friends that they won&#39;t grow apart <br/>
anytime soon, so these situations will continue to come up.  I&#39;m very <br/>
tired of saying or doing nothing  it&#39;s a constant source of <br/>
frustration and bad feelings for both me and my daughter.  My <br/>
daughter is afraid that if I say something, the mom won&#39;t be able to <br/>
handle it and will not allow A to spend time with her at all.  I <br/>
seriously need suggestions on either how to speak up to the mom (and <br/>
not care about the outcome) and/or how to deal with my overwhelming <br/>
feelings and  find workarounds to specific situations.   <br/>
<br/>
Kindly,<br/>
Keti</div>

I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could call after a couple of hours and say &quot;Did you  <br/>
remember to feed the girls?  I heard you forgot once...&quot;   :-)<br/>
<br/>
Or just make sure your daughter eats before she goes, and have some  <br/>
food available when she gets back, or take some with you when you go  <br/>
to pick her up or something.<br/>
<br/>

she&#39;s doing, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Could you be gone?  What about making the next few visits something  <br/>
like museums or parks or something active (walking at least)?  It  <br/>
could involve a little food but not involve your whole house full of  <br/>
food.<br/>

<br/>
You can&#39;t change the mom, but you can change the circumstances.  Her  <br/>
house and yours are both problematical.  Find other places.  Hike the  <br/>
mall.  Go to the movies.<br/>

That might be a good way to break up the situation, though.  The mom  <br/>
will take it as an affront, and it will be the source of contention.   <br/>
She would probably see it as a social slap at her daughter&#39;s weight,  <br/>
and not at her parenting.  Like the visiting girl &quot;can eat all she  <br/>
wants&quot; but her daughter &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was going to suggest sending a bag of food along, however if it were<br/>
my daughter, going over to a food control house, I might tell her to<br/>
keep her food in her bag and eat it privately in the bedroom away from<br/>
prying eyes, or after parents go to bed.  I wouldn&#39;t even tell the mom<br/>
about the extra food.<br/>
<br/>
If the food is found out and the mom gets mad about it, you can tell her<br/>
straight up that you wanted to make sure that your daughter had enough<br/>
food, since she tends to come home hungry and cranky from lack of food. <br/>
Then, the other mom can either provide more food for your daughter on<br/>
the next visit, or encounter uncrolled food entering her house.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that is the right thing to do or not, just what I would<br/>
do in the same scenario.</div>

the best friend family.  We did all of the things you are talking about<br/>
here.  None of it worked really, but the act of helping, helped.  So,<br/>
don&#39;t stop trying to find other things to do and other people to meet in<br/>
the meantime.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t.  I was forced into a situation that I couldn&#39;t avoid with<br/>
the parent of the best friend of my daughter, otherwise, I would&#39;ve let<br/>
it go.  The dad called to discuss an &quot;issue&quot; in regards to our<br/>
daughters, and wanted to discuss it among the parents first.  He was<br/>
confrontational, and I figured right then and there, we would lose,<br/>
because he wasn&#39;t trying to find a workable solution, so, since I knew I<br/>
had nothing to lose anyway, I spoke my mind.  It gave him the excuse he<br/>
needed to do what he wanted to do, but I made it clear to both the girls<br/>
that none of it was coming from me, and since they are smart kids, they<br/>
already knew that.<br/>
<br/>
That was about a year and a half ago.  That friend hates her father. <br/>
Her daily life is hell.  Chamille knows her life is better and while she<br/>
still loves that friend a great deal, she&#39;s not desperate anymore<br/>
because her life IS good.  Now that she&#39;s been able to hang out a bit<br/>
more with that friend, she sees how all that control has deeply impacted<br/>
this friend, to such an extent that it has an impact on their<br/>
relationship and how they deal with each other.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t answer the phone.  In general social ettiquette, it&#39;s rude to<br/>
answer the phone during a meal anyway.  Unless the daughter has a cell<br/>
phone, you are under no obligation to answer your phone to this mom. <br/>
You can listen to her voicemail and call her back a bit later.  Tell her<br/>
you guys were busy and didn&#39;t hear the phone, then put your phone on<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your daughter is right, don&#39;t say anything more to this mom.  Your<br/>
daughter is 12 and I assume her friend is too.  That is an age,<br/>
especially if they are in school, where they change friends a lot and<br/>
find social niches that are comfortable.  They may grow apart simply<br/>
because of that aspect alone.  It may not seem as if they will, but in a<br/>
year, at that age, kids change a lot and really fast.<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly how you are feeling.  I took a while to respond to this<br/>
email, simply because I really can feel your pain, we&#39;ve been there! <br/>
When I was trying to find answers for us, people suggested doing things,<br/>
getting out, changing the focus.  The focus was really wanting to be<br/>
with that friend and nothing else would do, so it was hard and my<br/>
daughter was uncooperative about it, pining for her friend.<br/>
<br/>
Hindsight, though, I really believe that getting out with a little force<br/>
helped a lot.  It was hard to push her, but it can be done in little<br/>
ways and lots of encouragement.  Letting my daughter react how she<br/>
wanted, be who she wanted to be, encouraging her other intersts, all<br/>
helped in small ways.<br/>
<br/>
It will pass.  Be patient and gentle and kind to your daughter and your<br/>
daughter&#39;s friend.  You do have the advantage that you guys can still<br/>
see this friend, don&#39;t do anything to change that.  If you lose contact,<br/>
all of you guys lose, especially the other girl who won&#39;t have anywhere<br/>
to escape from the yucky controlling existence at her own home.  That<br/>
was the worst part for us, the dad routinely grounded his daughter from<br/>
my daughter, still does, but the initial really bad grounding lasted<br/>
months.  When we were finally able to circumvent that by getting in<br/>
contact with the mom who has visits on the weekends, things changed a<br/>
little because the dad realized he couldn&#39;t control everything.  He<br/>
couldn&#39;t keep his daughter from seeing her friend, and the grounding<br/>
didn&#39;t count as much or last as long.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille also decided that she wasn&#39;t ok with going over to her friend&#39;s<br/>
house.  For a while she put up with the yucky atmosphere to be with her<br/>
friend.  It got to the point where she couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t tolerate<br/>
being around a complete jerk, even if it was to see her friend.  That<br/>
worked in her favor too.  It also helps that I&#39;m willing to do ALL the<br/>
driving and pay for things, it took away the first front of excuses for<br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; to invites.  And, last, but not least, since the dad and I<br/>
aren&#39;t on speaking terms, my husband will call and negotiate for the<br/>
girls.  Since my husband wasn&#39;t involved in the confrontation, and he&#39;s<br/>
a man, he carries more weight in that dynamic. (yes on top of all of<br/>
this, the guy is a sexist and bigotted person)</div>

Then again, I didn&#39;t abuse it, but still... to have someone else&#39;s  <br/>
child and make oneself unavailable is bad.  And to leave a child with  <br/>
me and make oneself unavailable for very long is bad too.  I&#39;ve been  <br/>
on both sides of that (not someone purposely not answering a phone,  <br/>
but from disorganization or forgetting to turn a phone one) and I  <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea.<br/>

<br/>
 From the other side too, give up the idea of controlling or changing  <br/>
the other family.  Look to helping your own child have the contact  <br/>
she wants to have, knowing it won&#39;t be ideal.<br/>
<br/>
And another point is not to idealize the relationship and project it  <br/>
into the future.  Jenny C made the point that 12 year olds change  <br/>
friends even under all kinds of circumstances, so if this blows to  <br/>
the point that the girls can&#39;t visit for a while, and if it turns  <br/>
into forever, don&#39;t blame her parents so hard that it will seem to  <br/>
her that they ruined a perfect lifelong friendship.   I had two VERY,  <br/>
very close friends when I was 9-12, and 14-17.  I&#39;m still slightly in  <br/>
contact with them (funerals and that) but our adult lives are very  <br/>
different.  The relationships were rich and full and good when we  <br/>
were girls.  I was enriched from knowing their families and I saw  <br/>
flaws in their parents&#39; relationship that were different from my own  <br/>
parents, and I saw how the rules and discipline in their families  <br/>
were different from mine (one more gentle and creative, one just  <br/>
secretive and mean), and that made me a better daughter and  <br/>
eventually a better mom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116129195">I don&#39;t think you can change their limits and if you try, you may end<br/>
up making it hard for the girls to spend time together.  It sounds<br/>
like that is not what your daughter wants at all so I would stay away<br/>
from that completely.  Your protein bar solution seems to be working<br/>
pretty well for visits over there and I would probably leave it at<br/>
that.  Send even more food, if your daughter needs it.<br/>
<br/>
From what you described, I think that having limited food for the<br/>
girls (limited to what is generally considered healthy) at YOUR house<br/>
would be preferable to the full on crazy controls and limits at their<br/>
house.   If you agree only to feed certain types of food, would her<br/>
mom be OK with visits to your house again?     I am not  saying you<br/>
should force your daughter to do this... more that you would get her<br/>
on board with the idea that if your family jumps through some hoops,<br/>
her friend can visit you again and that would be more pleasant over<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of taking the kids out too, but I think that food will<br/>
come up there too.  You go to the mall and the girls want something to<br/>
eat... but the food for sale there will probably be even less<br/>
acceptable to them than the food you have at home.  You take them to a<br/>
movie and your daughter wants popcorn and a soda.  If they are<br/>
anywhere together longer than an hour or two, food will come up.  I<br/>
think I would just try to find a way to support their friendship and<br/>
your daughter as well as you can in less than ideal circumstances.<br/>
Limiting food at home during visits might be the best way to do<br/>
that... and at least then they are with you, not the controlling mom.<br/>
<br/>
We had something sort of like this come up with a friend of my<br/>
daughter&#39;s who has very limited TV access and it just seems to work<br/>
best to stay within her mom&#39;s limits.  My daughter would rather have<br/>
her friend over with the TV off most of the time than not see her<br/>
friend.<br/>

&gt; perspectives shared here. I have two kids: ds is 17 and dd is 12.<br/>
&gt; We have attended two L&L conferences. The kids have been home for<br/>
&gt; three plus years and we have been walking the path of unschooling for<br/>
&gt; about a year and a half, enjoying life and watching everyone thrive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really need some perspective on a difficult long-standing<br/>
&gt; situation. It relates to my dd&#39;s best friend, A, a girl she met in<br/>
&gt; third grade. A is a cool kid and dd enjoys the relationship. She&#39;s<br/>
&gt; in school and her family is very entrenched in the &quot;culture of<br/>
&gt; school&quot; to the point where they view it as the one and ONLY way. The<br/>
&gt; mom has never overtly said she disapproves of how my kids are getting<br/>
&gt; an education, nor has she ever asked what we do, however, there is a<br/>
&gt; clear feeling of judgment and disapproval coming from her.<br/>
&gt; Consequently, we have distanced ourselves from the family socially<br/>
&gt; while allowing my dd and A to continue their friendship. A is<br/>
&gt; completely controlled by her Mom. She&#39;s overweight and they control<br/>
&gt; her food and drink. Couple of years ago the Mom and I had a<br/>
&gt; conversation around the &quot;weight problem&quot; and she acknowledged that<br/>
&gt; she herself has major food issues. I suggested then that perhaps<br/>
&gt; some counseling for the Mom would be an option. She seemed open to<br/>
&gt; that idea, said she had already considered it, etc. But, then the<br/>
&gt; wall of denial came up and nothing ever happened … the simply<br/>
&gt; continued controlling A. Time passed. I could see that they were<br/>
&gt; not committed to doing anything different and began to distance<br/>
&gt; myself from them. A has a lot of health problems … earlier this year<br/>
&gt; they thought it was asthma, but instead it seems to have been anxiety<br/>
&gt; attacks at … school. No surprise there. All that said, here&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When A spends time at our house, we let her eat and drink what she<br/>
&gt; wants. Consequently, they don&#39;t want A to be at our house. So, the<br/>
&gt; only way my daughter can spend time with A is at their house. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable with the arrangement … they require the kids to jump on<br/>
&gt; the trampoline after eating and other ridiculous things. They also<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t feed my daughter enough food (and apple or a cereal bar is<br/>
&gt; considered lunch). She comes home with low blood sugar and extremely<br/>
&gt; irritated. My daughter doesn&#39;t mind the forced &quot;exercise&quot; but she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t like what they are willing to feed her. If she sleeps over,<br/>
&gt; I usually give her a few protein bars so she has SOMETHING to eat,<br/>
&gt; which helps. As an inside joke, my dd and I call their<br/>
&gt; home &quot;starvation house.&quot; She&#39;s willing to tolerate this behavior so<br/>
&gt; she can see her friend. It&#39;s so incredibly sad and heartbreaking.<br/>
&gt; In the past, I&#39;ve discussed with the mom that my daughter is a<br/>
&gt; growing girl and she eats a LOT of food and needs it while her body<br/>
&gt; is developing and that she&#39;s been hungry at their house. Still,<br/>
&gt; nothing changes. Sometimes they &quot;forget&quot; to feed the girls. The<br/>
&gt; girls get together much less frequently and the sleepovers are even<br/>
&gt; more rare, namely because A always has homework to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been actively seeking outlets for my daughter to meet new<br/>
&gt; friends for the last two years. I started a local unschooling group<br/>
&gt; and we joined a local co-op. Both of these are new ventures and<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s not met any girls around her age. We talk about the situation<br/>
&gt; quite a bit and my daughter struggles with A and her limitations. We<br/>
&gt; both very much want for her to develop friends with other unschooled<br/>
&gt; or relaxed homeschooled kids. Just hasn&#39;t happened yet. My dd has<br/>
&gt; talked about getting back into dance classes and I&#39;m optimistic that<br/>
&gt; will give her some exposure to new girls to befriend. We&#39;ll probably<br/>
&gt; start this in January.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Given this background, is it worth it for me to, either verbally or<br/>
&gt; in writing, broach the subject of controls again (e.g., where is<br/>
&gt; affects me and my daughter, like the trampoline or going hungry) with<br/>
&gt; the Mom?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to tell her how disrespectful it is to constantly call A<br/>
&gt; when she&#39;s out with us and ask her what she ate, where she is, what<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s doing, etc. This happened twice last night in a three hour<br/>
&gt; period – it was a very rare occasion when A came to dinner with us.<br/>
&gt; I think the girls are good enough friends that they won&#39;t grow apart<br/>
&gt; anytime soon, so these situations will continue to come up. I&#39;m very<br/>
&gt; tired of saying or doing nothing … it&#39;s a constant source of<br/>
&gt; frustration and bad feelings for both me and my daughter. My<br/>
&gt; daughter is afraid that if I say something, the mom won&#39;t be able to<br/>
&gt; handle it and will not allow A to spend time with her at all. I<br/>
&gt; seriously need suggestions on either how to speak up to the mom (and<br/>
&gt; not care about the outcome) and/or how to deal with my overwhelming<br/>
&gt; feelings and find workarounds to specific situations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

calling my cell phone. So, we were all sitting at dinner when the mom <br/>
called A and asked her what she was eating.  I felt disturbed, but <br/>
didn&#39;t make any comment and acted like it didn&#39;t happen for the sake <br/>

talk to A about the food and control stuff (maybe they are still too <br/>

&gt;and find social niches that are comfortable.  They may grow apart <br/>
&gt;simply because of that aspect alone.  It may not seem as if they <br/>
&gt;will, but in a year, at that age, kids change a lot and really fast.<br/>

&gt;hard and my daughter was uncooperative about it, pining for her <br/>
&gt;friend.<br/>
<br/>

not at home, however, the Mom is reluctant to allow this.  That is, <br/>
she&#39;s fine taking my dd places, but doesn&#39;t like me taking her dd <br/>
anywhere. My dd likes to be at their house because they have lots of <br/>
cool stuff.  The reason A doesn&#39;t spend the night with us anymore is <br/>
because of her &quot;allergies.&quot; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s real or something <br/>

&gt;won&#39;t have anywhere to escape from the yucky controlling existence <br/>
&gt;at her own home.  <br/>

&gt;friend&#39;s house.  For a while she put up with the yucky atmosphere to <br/>

&gt;wouldn&#39;t tolerate being around a complete jerk, even if it was to <br/>
&gt;see her friend.  That worked in her favor too.  It also helps that <br/>
&gt;I&#39;m willing to do ALL the driving and pay for things, it took away <br/>
&gt;the first front of excuses for saying &quot;no&quot; to invites. <br/>

time.  I suspect A will want to get away from her parents more and <br/>
more and if she spends more time with us, it will work to the girls <br/>
advantage. I&#39;ll try to find ways to make that more attractive to <br/>
everyone. :)<br/>

available, but not huge amounts of junk food.  My kids usually ask me <br/>
to make them stuff. It&#39;s funny because I buy mostly organic and whole <br/>
foods and do a fair amount of cooking, but nothing especially fancy <br/>
or rich. I make simple stuff without many processed ingredients. I <br/>
don&#39;t believe artificial sweetners and low fat/no fat stuff are <br/>
healthy, so I don&#39;t buy it. They don&#39;t seem to feed their dd all day <br/>
and then have a &quot;normal&quot; dinner.  They have never asked me to not <br/>
feed their dd, but they always interrogate her as to what she ate and <br/>
how much (by phone) at regualr intervals.  There have been several <br/>
notable incidents where the Mom tried to control what dd would eat - <br/>
once at a party I had at my home. She brought juice for A to drink <br/>
despite the fact that I had juice on hand. The goal, I concluded, was <br/>
to prevent her from drinking soda, something A loves. Didn&#39;t work. <br/>
And almost escalated into a scene. Another incident involved A eating <br/>
a few pieces of hard candy at my house and the Mom freaked out (yes, <br/>
yelling and screaming and out of control) in my home in front of me <br/>
and the girls. At the time, I was too shocked to respond. And after, <br/>
I had no clue what to say. That was the last straw for me and the <br/>
point where I started distancing myself from her. That was about <br/>
eight months ago.<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of asking A&#39;s mom what I&#39;m &quot;allowed&quot; to feed her in my <br/>
home is distasteful to me. I need to think on this some more ... <br/>
whether I&#39;d be willing to do this to make it easier for A to be here.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

This creates a whole new set of moral and ethical questions. Yes, I <br/>
could just stick to the mom&#39;s wishes and tell her that, but how would <br/>
she feel?  I would feel horrible. I&#39;m having trouble seeing a this as <br/>

Rather than clinging to that relationship, or encouraging your  <br/>
daughter to cling to it or have great hopes, maybe focus time and  <br/>
energy in other directions.  During winter break maybe the girls can  <br/>
visit.  Then Easter.  Then summer.  But with homework and school  <br/>
being factors, this will get worse before it gets better.<br/>

 From your accounts, it sounds like it would be a huge problem even  <br/>
if they were both homeschooled or if they were both in school.<br/>

You&#39;re putting negotations and rules ahead of principles.  You  <br/>
already know what the other mom wants.  You can do it or not do it,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178447522">We have visitors who have food restrictions and often seem to be hungry when <br/>
they arrive, although I know they have lots of good food at their meals. If <br/>
the kids start asking for foods that seem iffy, I am lucky enough that <br/>
generally I can ask them to check in with their mother across the courtyard <br/>
whether it is ok. Again I have been lucky because usually it has been fine, <br/>
and I think it gives the other mom reassurance - especially since her son <br/>
has said in the past that he isn&#39;t supposed to eat some sweet thing or other <br/>
but intended to sneak it at our house and lie about it at home. I told him I <br/>
wasn&#39;t comfortable with that, and that I wanted his mom to be comfortable <br/>
too. On the other hand Jayn has her basket of candy and chocolates from <br/>
Halloween and seems to be frequently distributing them to the kids, and I <br/>
have a feeling that the mom might disapprove if she saw the volume - but it <br/>
is kinda under my radar and in passing, while not being a covert operation.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times when I have called a mom to check about a range of <br/>
foods just to be sure, but that was mostly when both Jayn and her friends <br/>
were younger. The older they all get, the more I adopt the policy of asking <br/>
visitors what they would like. It is amazing to me that adults are trying to <br/>
control the food intake of a 12 year old who is out and about in the world. <br/>
What a way to make exercise despised by the kid!<br/>
<br/>
The other idea I had if the cache of protein bars practice ends up failing <br/>
might be to discuss the food issue for your own daughter from the point of <br/>
view of low blood sugar as a medical condition. I don&#39;t know if your own <br/>
doctor has made any recommendations about the frequency or caloric level for <br/>
your daughter that you could then pass on with the authority of medical <br/>
experts behind it. Or perhaps slightly vaguer &quot;We&#39;ve learnt that it&#39;s very <br/>
important for dd to avoid hypoglycemia so I&#39;m sending her over with a snack <br/>
bag of approved foods for her to eat when she feels her blood sugar level <br/>
slipping.&quot; You don&#39;t necessarily need to say that you have learned it from <br/>
observation or that you are the food approver.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn comes home with stories of the practices in other homes that she <br/>
clearly thinks are head shakingly odd. For example one mom only puts about <br/>
an inch of liquid in her kid&#39;s glasses and according to Jayn they can&#39;t ask <br/>
for more. I think it is because the kids are clumsy (I know this from <br/>
observation at our house) and she is trying to avoid endless spillage clean <br/>
up. But to Jayn it has translated into not being allowed to ask for more <br/>
(shades of Oliver). To me the whole thing could be avoided by using a lidded <br/>
cup with a straw, which is what I do.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of people here I am learning to trust that Jayn will be ok <br/>
even if she occasionally goes into a poor environment, and from my own <br/>
experience I know I absolutely can&#39;t control another mom and it is futile to <br/>
try, regardless of how much sense I might be making. If Jayn is willing to <br/>
put up with nonsense for the sake of spending time with friends, then she <br/>
will be alright, and perhaps eventually she will decide that it&#39;s too much <br/>
trouble to be worth it. I know that it is hard when crankiness and bad mood <br/>
and unpleasant stress releasing behaviors are then brought home, but I like <br/>
the suggestion of having food in the car. Perhaps you could even make a <br/>
special time of going out to eat together right away or go for a walk (too <br/>
old for the park??) after a snack. James and Jayn have a special place they <br/>
go to, a taco joint near us, that has been a good way to dispel hunger <br/>
induced grumpiness.<br/>

Over the years, and as the kids have gotten older so I&#39;m not so  <br/>
frazzled, I have less need for &quot;OH MY GOSH I HAVEN&#39;T EATEN!&quot; food,  <br/>
but there&#39;s a burger king near where Kirby used to work.  All my  <br/>
relatives and several of my friends knew the medicinal value of a  <br/>
quick fish sandwich when I was starting to look or sound volatile.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246156795"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;Now that she&#39;s been able to hang out a bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; more with that friend, she sees how all that control has deeply<br/>
&gt; &gt;impacted this friend, to such an extent that it has an impact on<br/>
&gt; their relationship and how they deal with each other.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to know what you mean by the last part. Can you give an<br/>
&gt; example as to how they deal with each other? My dd feels she can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; talk to A about the food and control stuff (maybe they are still too<br/>
&gt; young to identify/verbalize stuff like that?). I see A starting a<br/>
&gt; lot of attention-seeking behaviors and worry about her future. A has<br/>
&gt; not made any close friends besides my dd.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of the way that my daughter&#39;s friend has learned to behave is<br/>
reactionary.  She doesn&#39;t think clearly and logically about why she&#39;s<br/>
feeling a certain way and how that affects her behavior.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
expect a kid that has grown up in dysfuntion to be able to figure that<br/>
out.  One day she might, after she goes through some bad relationships,<br/>
or a death or some other trauma.<br/>
<br/>
When Chamille says she doesn&#39;t want to do something, she has a pretty<br/>
good reason for it, her friend really doesn&#39;t understand that.  In her<br/>
world, clearly all kids want to run around doing obnoxious attention<br/>
seeking rebellious things for fun.  While Chamille finds some of it fun,<br/>
she knows there are boundaries that shouldn&#39;t be crossed and her friend<br/>
doesn&#39;t see them at all.  The ONLY boundaries she sees are the ones that<br/>
will get her in trouble with dad.  She knows her dad&#39;s triggers and if<br/>
he&#39;ll find out about things, or if there is a potential for finding out.<br/>
Everything else is ok to do, even though it really isn&#39;t for a lot of<br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve considered Sandra&#39;s suggestion to get the girls out doing things<br/>
&gt; not at home, however, the Mom is reluctant to allow this. That is,<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s fine taking my dd places, but doesn&#39;t like me taking her dd<br/>
&gt; anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well you are the wild card in the deck.  The mom is uncomfortable with<br/>
her daughter being in a situation that she has no control over.<br/>
<br/>
The reason A doesn&#39;t spend the night with us anymore is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because of her &quot;allergies.&quot; I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s real or something<br/>
&gt; her Mom made up. My dd really misses A because she&#39;s so unavailable<br/>
&gt; with school and homework.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They are excuses.  You know, the mom knows it, but you can&#39;t change it<br/>
or call her on it.  We&#39;ve heard them all too, well, not the allergy one.<br/>
That does make sense given the food control issues though.  Allergies<br/>
can be used as a way to control food, I&#39;ve seen it done, heck, it was<br/>
done to me as a kid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thanks, I need the reminder. I&#39;m doing okay ... mostly I struggle<br/>
&gt; with the damage the mom is doing to her dd.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Chamille was in tears over her friend, a lot of those tears were on<br/>
her friend&#39;s behalf more than her own unhappiness.  She really cares<br/>
deeply for her friend and doesn&#39;t like to see her hurt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m glad you shared this ... it&#39;s interesting what kids choose over<br/>
&gt; time. I suspect A will want to get away from her parents more and<br/>
&gt; more and if she spends more time with us, it will work to the girls<br/>
&gt; advantage. I&#39;ll try to find ways to make that more attractive to<br/>
&gt; everyone. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the other mom is willing anyway!  One thing that we did sometimes,<br/>
was to invite the sister along.  If we invited both girls, dad could<br/>
have uninterrupted video game playing time, and he wouldn&#39;t have to cook<br/>
dinner or make his kids do it.  Sweeten the deal.  You know more about<br/>
what will work with this person, and your daughter may have some good<br/>
ideas too.</div>

Once when Holly told some kids she never got spankings, one said  <br/>
excitedly &quot;Then you could lie all the time!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That girl felt like a winner when she lied and didn&#39;t get caught.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had no reason to lie.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675292067"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I wouldn&#39;t want my children with someone who was willing to lie to<br/>
&gt; me. And if my child is away from me, I&#39;d like to be able to call.<br/>
&gt; Then again, I didn&#39;t abuse it, but still... to have someone else&#39;s<br/>
&gt; child and make oneself unavailable is bad. And to leave a child with<br/>
&gt; me and make oneself unavailable for very long is bad too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually agree with this!  I was thinking about the particular<br/>
scenario of having someone&#39;s child for 3 hrs and having the phone<br/>
interrupt our activities repeatedly for non-emergency stuff, just to<br/>
check in on the child&#39;s eating.  If I were to turn off a phone to<br/>
eliminate disruptions, I would totally check it and messages to make<br/>
sure there were no emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
The child in question has her own phone though.  It&#39;s interesting to me<br/>
that the child potentially has a cell phone for the mom to control more.<br/>
I got Chamille a cell phone so that she could have more freedom, not<br/>
less, but then, my goal isn&#39;t to micro manage my kids!<br/>
<br/>
Chamille&#39;s friend has a cell phone because the mom got tired of always<br/>
going through the dad to talk to her kids, so she put them on her phone<br/>
service and purchased phones for them.  Now the dad, uses the phones as<br/>
a form of control and punishment to penalize both his kids and their<br/>
mother.  He takes away the phone as a form of punishment, checks all the<br/>
texts and numbers and does formal interrogations about all of them. <br/>
This poor kid has to make sure that everything gets erased right after<br/>
she uses her phone each and everytime, just in case.  When she is over<br/>
and using her phone, I sometimes remind her to delete her stuff on the<br/>
way back home.  I know and she knows that he will check and ground her<br/>
from Chamille for anything remotely suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel that by doing that I cross the line, but then the<br/>
consequences are so severe and affect both her and my daughter, I offer<br/>
reminders.  I don&#39;t control her or Chamille, that&#39;s not how I operate. <br/>
I figure that&#39;s his job, since that&#39;s what he does.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fine line of following ones own principles and allowing the rules<br/>
and weirdness of another parent enter into your home.  Over the years,<br/>
I&#39;ve come to places where I just won&#39;t go or do in the name of keeping<br/>
the peace for the kids&#39; sake.  I used to jump through a lot of hoops for<br/>
keeping the peace and the other parent took advantage repeatedly because<br/>
he knew I&#39;d agree to it, so that our kids could hang out.<br/>
<br/>
Now, instead of Chamille being desperate to hang out with her friend,<br/>
the friend is desperate to hang out with her.  Not something I<br/>
anticipated by laying down boundaries with this parent.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone wants to be controlled and manipulated.  People who control and<br/>
manipulate will do it to get what they want until they can&#39;t control and<br/>
manipulate that person anymore.  By allowing him to do so, I was also<br/>
allowing him to control and manipulate Chamille by extension.  Things<br/>
have been a lot better since I stopped letting him do that to us.  His<br/>
daughter suffers more because of it and Chamille and I both feel<br/>
terrible for her, but our lives are better, and that can have the<br/>
potential to make her friend&#39;s life better.</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m always stunned when someone wants to hire a babysitter for rock- <br/>
bottom nothing, and then tell them exactly what they can and can&#39;t do  <br/>
in their own home.  In the past I kept other people&#39;s kids a few  <br/>
times for money, and I figure they&#39;ve chosen to leave a child at MY  <br/>
house, where I&#39;ve already been living, with my kids, for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard people defend their &quot;rules&quot; for their kids, too, about  <br/>
what they can see and hear and eat.<br/>
<br/>
For $4 or $5 an hour, they should take what they get.  If they want  <br/>
to say exactly what gets done, I&#39;d want at least $15 or $20 an hour.   <br/>
I was thinking as I was typing this what I would take to be harsh and  <br/>
use time-outs or spankings.  Maybe for $100 an hour I&#39;d slip the kid  <br/>
$20 to claim I was really mean, but not actually be mean.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chamille had a pretty decent babysitting gig, or so we thought.  She got<br/>
$6 an hour for watching 2 boys about 7 and 9 at their house, while they<br/>
went to doctors appts.  It lasted a while, until she couldn&#39;t handle the<br/>
complete disregard they had for their parents rules and each other and<br/>
she didn&#39;t know how to enforce anything.  The babysitter is supposed to<br/>
be fun and play games and be nice.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what Chamille tried doing, but she couldn&#39;t get the kids to stop<br/>
fighting with each other and one of them kept trying to run away from<br/>
home, so Chamille would have to chase him down the street while the<br/>
other was left by himself in the house.  The parents told her to put<br/>
them in time-out in their seperate bedrooms and leave them there for the<br/>
whole time if necessary.  Chamille couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t do that because<br/>
she thought it was mean, so she quit, or rather I called them and told<br/>
them to find another sitter and thanks for the opportunity, but that<br/>
she&#39;d changed her mind.  The kids were really sad about it because they<br/>
said that Chamille was their favorite babysitter ever!</div>
