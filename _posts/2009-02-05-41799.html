<div id="ygrps-yiv-173833980">Hi!<br/>
We are an unschooling family. I think we are anyway. Our dd has never<br/>
been to &#39;school.&#39; She will be 7 next month. We have a 2, almost 3,<br/>
year old at home as well. When we started our homeschooling journey I<br/>
had it in my mind that we would &#39;school&#39; at home. It wasn&#39;t even my<br/>
desire, it was my husbands that we homeschool. I told him before I<br/>
shot it down I&#39;d live with it and learn about it. I loved it the idea<br/>
of it at then end of the month I gave myself to investigate the<br/>
notion. Schooling at home. Then I learned fast after giving that a try<br/>
(school at home) it would not work for us. I visited Sandra&#39;s website<br/>
and then started moving in the direction of unschooling. Deschooling<br/>
myself mostly. Our day looks like this sort of. They are different all<br/>
the time. (We have some classes that Emma requested during the week.<br/>
Drama, Math fun and games, Spanish, and Science.  We stop them if they<br/>
are not what she thought they&#39;d be.)<br/>
Emma awakens with a list of interests she wants to explore. Today it<br/>
was making an &#39;All about Me&#39; book that turned into an &#39;All about YOU<br/>
book.&#39; People of all different types. She has created a world just for<br/>
them. Then she had a stack of books to read with me. I read, she<br/>
reads. She is still not sure about reading. Then back to book making.<br/>
Princesses of all sorts. She illustrates and tells me what to write<br/>
and when she wants, she writes. Now she is watching Mulan 2 with her<br/>
Grandma who came to visit. We do all sorts of things and I make a<br/>
mental list in my mind of what she is learning and doing because I<br/>
still *worry* about are we doing enough. Some times I write down what<br/>
I notice and see her doing because I need that confirmation. I am<br/>
still deschooling. So I looked up the definition of unschooling and<br/>
found this link:<br/>

I love these new groups I have found. Thanks to Rue Kream&#39;s book:<br/>
&quot;Raising a Free Child.&quot;<br/>
I love how unschooling feels. I see Emma (and our son, Simon too)<br/>
growing and learning all the time. It just looks way different than I<br/>
had thought. I will keep deschooling myself and learn with them. I did<br/>
think to myself the other day while &#39;worrying&#39;, &quot;Am I having fun?&quot; <br/>
I think mostly I am but I worry too because it is off the beaten path<br/>
from where I have journeyed. I am worrying a little less though I<br/>
think then I was last year. <br/>
Thanks for listening! I&#39;m glad to be here with you!<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Dory</div>
