I  struggle to remember people&#39;s names and faces.  I struggle to<br/>
remember  where I know them from if I haven&#39;t seen them often.  I never<br/>
notice  what people are wearing or if they gain or lose weight, unless it&#39;s  a<br/>
substantial amount.  Things like that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
 <br/>
Me too.<br/>
I was asked &quot;what does  he look like?&quot; about my best friend once, and  after <br/>
I made the description, the other people around me laughed.  It was  <br/>
apparently about five years out of date.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I see a person, I don&#39;t look visually.  I see them as all the  ways they <br/>
have ever been since I&#39;ve known them. I see the history and the soul  of <br/>
them.  So people I don&#39;t know yet I find very hard to recognize the  second or <br/>
third time, until I HAVE them, until I have some depth and perspective  on them.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people are very visual even if they haven&#39;t seen.   A  homeschool mom <br/>
I&#39;ve been on a little e-mail loop with for ten years now  described me once <br/>
before she had ever met me.  Every little clue I had ever  given in any <br/>
conversation over about a year, she had filed into a physical  image.  She was right.  <br/>
I&#39;m more likely to remember what religion  someone grew up in and where they&#39;ve <br/>
lived than how tall they are or what color  their hair is.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby took his long sideburns off.  I didn&#39;t notice, Holly told  me.<br/>
 <br/>
So I think some teachers in school assume that others are as visual as they  <br/>
are.  Some things are easy for visual learners.  Maps, pictures of the  <br/>
skeletal or circulatory systems.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes new homeschoolers want to find their child&#39;s learning style and  <br/>
just live there, but I think few people are really duds in any one area so it&#39;s  <br/>
best to make ALL kinds of information available and let them take it in as <br/>
they  will.  Some aural, some visual, some tactile, whatever.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and of &quot;aural&quot; and me:  If I hear a name, I often ask for a  spelling. I <br/>
remember it from picturing it written better than from hearing it  spoken.<br/>
 <br/>
Years back someone had come across a learning disability (I hope one of you  <br/>
will remember or know how to find it, if it wasn&#39;t just a one-time fluke <br/>
little  article) in which the person can ONLY learn through the written word and no <br/>
 other way.  And it had been given some greco/latin scientific name and  <br/>
called a disability.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858933112">I&#39;m a visual learner/rememberer and I have to *see* a name to remember it.  Same with the telephone -- I have a hard time remembering the finer points of a more technical conversation because I can&#39;t see the person enunciate, or they can&#39;t show me their notes.  Probably why I tend to remember more of what I read than what I hear.  I can&#39;t seem to focus aurally.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hahaha, lol, this reminds me of when my husband cut off his long hair, <br/>
it had been the same for 10 years, and he had long hair when I first <br/>
met him... we went to a crowded movie theater that night after the <br/>
haircut, and I still wasn&#39;t used to the change... so when the movie let <br/>
out we were in a big crowd, and I lost sight my husband in all the <br/>
people, I felt the parasympathetic/ panic reflexes starting up... well <br/>
he was standing right next to me, and when I finally recognized him, I <br/>
screamed and then he panicked... so funny!<br/>
