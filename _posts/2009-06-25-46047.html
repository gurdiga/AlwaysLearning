<div id="ygrps-yiv-148472911">Jonathan, 12 (almost 13 - wow), and I just had the following conversation and it speaks nicely to the relationship we have:<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan:  Mom, there&#39;s something that really bugs me that parents do.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  What&#39;s that?<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan:  Their kid does something they don&#39;t like and they get mad.  But if the kid tries to explain why, they don&#39;t let him.  They won&#39;t listen.  They just get mad and punish them.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  Do I do that?<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan:  Well, no.  But I see it on cartoons all the time and in real life.  And with people I know.  It&#39;s frustrating, because sometimes there&#39;s a perfectly good explanation for what they did, but the parent won&#39;t even *listen* to it.<br/>
  <br/>
Me:  I know.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t do that.  Most families have rules, and the parents don&#39;t care about the reason the rule is broken.  It&#39;s more important for me to see what&#39;s going on, why something happened.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan:  I know!  It&#39;s so frustrating!  Sometimes there&#39;s a perfectly good explanantion that even the *parents* would agree with but they don&#39;t even let their kid tell them!  That doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br/>
