<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972177423">Yes.  Not only that but entire families all over the world don&#39;t even <br/>
know their own real names anymore.  They migrated somewhere where there<br/>
<br/>
were no letters or way to spell their name in the &quot;new&quot; language.   So <br/>
they just changed to a new surname to fit in and eventually down<br/>
through <br/>
just 2 or 3 generations-- Voila.  The real name has been forgotten.  A <br/>
family I know *think* they originally came from someplace up there in <br/>
Dane land but they&#39;re not sure where nor even the country.  Their name <br/>
is Norman... meaning &quot;north&quot; man, and that&#39;s why they think that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Real names&quot; is an interesting thing to consider, though.<br/>
The spelling isn&#39;t &quot;the real name.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And sounds have changed over the centuries.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The real name has been forgotten.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The real name has changed.  Really changed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Carol Narigon&#39;s last name, they&#39;ve figured out, should&#39;ve been  <br/>
&quot;Aragon&quot; but a young kid who didn&#39;t speak English went through Ellis  <br/>
Island, and that&#39;s how it was written down.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean &quot;her real name&quot; should be &quot;Aragon,&quot; it means that  <br/>
the name &quot;Narigon&quot; has a story behind it, just as &quot;Aragon&quot; does, and  <br/>
as some words do (because the stories can be deduced or discovered)  <br/>
and some names don&#39;t (because the history is too old, or there was a  <br/>
shift or jump or oddity).<br/>
<br/>
Someone related to me has a &quot;real name&quot; and has had since birth, but  <br/>
it turns out maybe that male-surnamed-person is not her biological  <br/>
dad.  That kinda taints her real name, especially since she&#39;s not at  <br/>
all hispanic but is now &quot;Hispanic-surnamed&quot; (worth tax money in New  <br/>
Mexico!)  Meanwhile, I have a cousin whose four kids have anglo names  <br/>
(hers)  though three of them ARE half hispanic, because she never  <br/>
married any of the dads and none of them claimed paternity.<br/>
<br/>
So even in the lifetime of an individual, the value of a surname can  <br/>
be messy.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few families in Northern New Mexico with non-Hispanic  <br/>
names, because 150 years ago one French or English guy showed up,  <br/>
married a local, and the name has come down the mail edge though  <br/>
there was never another Anglo guy in the family for all those years.   <br/>
Chacon.  Williams (Spanish-speaking Williams family).<br/>
