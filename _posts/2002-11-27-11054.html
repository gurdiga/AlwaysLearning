 </span></blockquote>His name is Severino Antinori. He&#39;s also responsible, for those who remember<br/>
it from 1994, of helping the 63 yo woman give birth.<br/>
<br/>
There was an article about him in the April 2002 Scientific American,<br/>
&quot;Father of the Impossible Children.&quot; He calls it &quot;genetic reprogramming&quot; and<br/>
says it&#39;s to help couples concieve when the husband produces no sperm.<br/>
<br/>
Cloning is used in scary science fiction stories but what do you think would<br/>
happen if it were readily available? How would families be different if a<br/>
few or even many were raising a child that was a gentic copy of the father?<br/>
<br/>
This has some links:<br/>

<br/>
I think the objection most fertility doctors and geneticists have is that<br/>
these types of techniques create a lot of chromosomal abnormalities. This is<br/>
especially true in cloning (I think I read only 3 out of 1000 cloned embryos<br/>
in animals are viable) but also other methods where the genetic information<br/>
from the sperm is injected into the egg rather than letting the egg &quot;decide&quot;<br/>
which sperm to let in. And even of the cloned sheep born that passed all the<br/>
tests for defects, many end up suffering from nervous system disorders and<br/>
other ailments after birth.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me the biggest problem isn&#39;t what genes the child carries but<br/>
how healthy those genes are. Natural reproduction is way better at weeding<br/>
out the dud combinations -- and even that isn&#39;t perfect -- than is<br/>
laboratory reproduction.<br/>

I have decided that in no way would I want a clone of either of my <br/>
children.  However, I would most definately want a clone of my first <br/>
daughter, Jasmine, who was adopted by me when I was sixteen, walked on <br/>
four legs and was the most beautiful, smartest sheltie in the world, and <br/>
with whom I shared a very special bond and whom I miss daily.  <br/>

Scientist will study her all her life, and treat her as if she is <br/>
there property. Also, I think cloning cheapens life. To create a <br/>
thousand embrios and let 999 die, just to prove that we &quot;can&quot; clone. <br/>
Then to let this person be a science experiment from birth till <br/>
death, never knowing what dangers might be in store for this person. <br/>
And then theres the idea that a lot of people may want to clone a <br/>
loved one or themselves. Does that make the original &quot;obsolete&quot; or <br/>
disposable? Not that its neccesarily available to ordinary people <br/>
(just yet) but what if my grandmother was dying, so I had her cloned, <br/>
so I wouldn&#39;t have to loose her. What about the life of my real <br/>
grandmother? Can anyone see how this would discount her life and <br/>
facilitate an unhealthy denial? It would be much healthier and <br/>
respectfull to mourn her passing and accept it. I look at this <br/>
cloning thing as a reflection of our fear of death, and desire for <br/>
imortality. But it is only an illusion of immortality. Also, I can <br/>
see in my mind, commercials similer to the ones we have now for baby <br/>
formula. &quot;Natural conception is best, but for those who can&#39;t or <br/>
don&#39;t want to....Simiclone is a safe and effective alternative.&quot; <br/>
Gives me the creeps. I wonder why scientist spend so much time and <br/>
money trying to duplicate what mother nature already does so well <br/>
without help instead of finding a cure for deadly diseases and a way <br/>
to end war and famine. It realy boggles the mind.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Scientist will study her all her life, and treat her as if she is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The babies aren&#39;t scientific experiments. Dr Antinori runs a fertility<br/>
clinic so the babies will be part of families just like any other baby from<br/>
a fertility clinic. I would hope that the clinic would collect health<br/>
information on the children, but, since it isn&#39;t in Antinori&#39;s best interest<br/>
to have reports of unhealthy babies, I&#39;d be skeptical of the quality of data<br/>
collected.<br/>
<br/>
Dr Antinori says he&#39;s against cloning just for the sake of it, but is in<br/>
favor of helping infertile couples that can&#39;t be helped with other fertility<br/>
procedures. And he&#39;s been working in the field of fertility since 1986.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility of him being tempted by really good<br/>
money from some rich people without fertility problems who wanted to clone<br/>
themselves but are those people really a threat to society and humanity?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, I think cloning cheapens life. To create a<br/>
&gt; thousand embrios and let 999 die,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How many fertilized eggs aren&#39;t viable in other fertility procedures? And<br/>
the body naturally gets rid of nonviable ones too. In fact I think the<br/>
incredible process they need to go through in the lab gives us a hint to the<br/>
incredible process of what&#39;s going on invisibly in the body.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just to prove that we &quot;can&quot; clone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no we. The majority of the scientific community is against it for<br/>
practical as well as ethical reasons. But this isn&#39;t research being funded<br/>
by government or corporate money. It&#39;s private funding. (Aparently heavily<br/>
supported by rich Asian and Arab men the SciAm article says.)<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s just Severino Antinori and Panos Zavos (an American fertility<br/>
specialist) and his clinic, Associated Researchers for Human Reproduction<br/>
(RAPRUI).<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s human emotions compelling his need to clone, not scientific<br/>
curiosity. I think he wants to acheive this for ego reasons. And for money<br/>
and business reasons. His clinic exists to provide help for couples who<br/>
can&#39;t conceive naturally. And people are willing to pay a *lot* of money to<br/>
get that. He has (so he says) 6000 couples from the US and 60 from Italy<br/>
waiting for the procedure.<br/>
<br/>
The scary person, though, is Brigitte Boisselier. Apparently she&#39;s a<br/>
respected biologist working for a rather out of this world religious<br/>
organization, the Raelian Revolution<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rael.org/int/english/index.html)">http://www.rael.org/int/english/index.html)</a>. (They believe we were created<br/>
by extra terrestrials in their image.) And they&#39;ve spun off a cloning<br/>
company, Clonaid (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clonaid.com/)">http://www.clonaid.com/)</a>. (If it were a science fiction<br/>
novel, people would think it&#39;s a schloky idea ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an MSNBC interview with her at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/602030.asp?cp1=1">http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/602030.asp?cp1=1</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then to let this person be a science experiment from birth till<br/>
&gt; death, never knowing what dangers might be in store for this person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what fertility doctors and geneticists are objecting to. Not all the<br/>
sheep born are perfectly healthy. Dr. Antinori says humans are more closely<br/>
monitored and tested. Of course he has a huge stake in having people believe<br/>
that he can eliminate genetic problems.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And then theres the idea that a lot of people may want to clone a<br/>

It would just be a baby who happened to have the same genes as your<br/>
grandmother. Would you pay $300,000 for the process? And would you carry the<br/>
baby? Or would you pay someone else on top of that to carry the baby?<br/>
<br/>
And then she&#39;d take 50 years to grow into the woman you remembered. She&#39;d<br/>
probably have a similar personality but her upbringing that may have shaped<br/>
who she was would be entirely different. Would you want to wait until you<br/>
were a grandmother for that?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a great deal in between wanting another copy of someone who just<br/>
died and actually having that copy.<br/>
<br/>
I think a more compelling ethical question is what about cloning a child who<br/>
has died.<br/>
<br/>
What does seem to capture people&#39;s interest though is cloning pets. If you<br/>
type in pets and cloning into Google it turns up over 12,000 hits.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I look at this <br/>
&gt; cloning thing as a reflection of our fear of death, and desire for<br/>
&gt; imortality. But it is only an illusion of immortality.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do we have kids? We may have higher order thinking that gives us the<br/>
illusion we&#39;re making rational decisions about having children but it&#39;s<br/>
lower order chemistry that compels us to reproduce and makes it seem like<br/>
something so energy intensive and life threatening (in the natural world<br/>
even more so) would be a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wonder why scientist spend so much time and<br/>
&gt; money trying to duplicate what mother nature already does so well<br/>
&gt; without help instead of finding a cure for deadly diseases and a way<br/>
&gt; to end war and famine. It realy boggles the mind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Scientists are humans and they pursue what they find compelling. (Isn&#39;t that<br/>
what we hope unschooling will do for our kids?) If we only &quot;allowed&quot; people<br/>
to pursue science who investigated things that benefited humanity, who would<br/>
decide what was allowed and what wasn&#39;t? And would we eliminate pure<br/>
research that investigates the workings of life and the universe to stick<br/>
only to research that solves problems?<br/>
<br/>
The benefit of freedom is that it allows people to pursue a huge variety of<br/>
ideas that may serendipitously lead to great things. The downside of freedom<br/>
is it gives people the freedom to do things that many people disagree with<br/>
or think is a waste of time. (The people behind the American Revolution<br/>
weren&#39;t very popular with most people!)<br/>

really considered anti-Islamic and (like everything:) scholars support not<br/>
cloning thru Koranic verses.<br/>

But Arabs have the same freedoms researchers do.  If no Moslem ever did <br/>
anything against the Koran, Iraq would be peaceniks and the Twin Towers would <br/>
be standing.<br/>
