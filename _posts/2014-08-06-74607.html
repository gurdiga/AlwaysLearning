 to say thank you for the amazing words of wisdom and experience that this group provides.<br><br></div>We
 have made many positive changes  in our parenting style gradually over
the past year thanks to&nbsp; &#39;reading,trying, waiting and watching&#39;. Every
time I read a posting I say &quot;I would have never thought of that on my
own&quot;. You all bring eye opening thoughts to every discussion and I
appreciate it immensely! It helps me to question myself when I have a
very silly &#39;rule&#39; stuck in my head of how something &#39;should&#39; be. It&#39;s
funny how different the world can look, when you&#39;re not so restricted in
 your thoughts.<br><br>&nbsp;First of all, our kids (ages 3,6,9,10) are so much
happier as unschoolers vs. when we tried &#39;homeschooling&#39;. I love
 that my kids don&#39;t feel pressured anymore to learn curriculum
that has to be &#39;learned by a certain time or else&#39;. It is so freeing to
sit with our kids laughing and watching their favorite t.v. shows,
playing their favorite games online while skyping with friends while
they talk to us about their interests, baking in the kitchen together,
taking special moments to grab binoculars and look at birds or animals
passing through our yard, taking car rides to a nearby train station so
our youngest can smile when he watches trains pass by (he doesn&#39;t want
to try a ride on a train just yet), and doing what we can to follow
their interests. Our kids also like having choices
 for meals and are so happy and creative in their suggestions of what we
 should make and happy that we actually do make what they are
suggesting!! They feel open and free to offer suggestions, which is
something I adore. Our parents are amazed at how quickly and openly our
kids offer amazing views or solutions to any situation. They are not
afraid to become part of adult<span style="" id="ygrps-yiv-1191082769yiv4346768674yui_3_16_0_6_1406898009046_41" class="ygrps-yiv-1191082769"><span style="" id="ygrps-yiv-1191082769yiv4346768674yui_3_16_0_6_1406898009046_44" class="ygrps-yiv-1191082769"> </span></span>conversations.
 They are all happy, giggly, comical, and have an amazing sense of
humor, I believe, because they feel free to do so!&nbsp;
<br><br>The advice on this group to &#39;treat your children as if they were your
guests&#39; is just one example of how your words have planted such a life
changing seed.
 &#39;Kindness and giving generously&#39; to our children
 really does feel good-you&#39;re right! When I first started reading about
unschooling, I did think &#39;wouldn&#39;t giving so much spoil a child?&#39;. Now I
 totally see how that thought (among many other previous thoughts of
mine) was so wrong. Our kids are so happy to give of themselves as well.
 They are happy, sweet kids. If they are frustrated about something,
they openly communicate about it. All of these characteristics (happy,
open, creative, humorous) are possible because they feel free and I <span class="ygrps-yiv-1191082769" id="ygrps-yiv-1191082769yiv4346768674yui_3_16_0_1_1406898009046_14561" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span>
 would have known about helping my kids to live freely if it weren&#39;t for
 this website, awesome contributors, and the Big Book of Unschooling
:)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;I still have plenty of areas to improve on. I love that I am
moving forward and can do my best to make small changes. I have scrap
pieces of paper with quotes and sayings from your website taped to my
 refrigerator. They
 are great reminders of where I want my mind to be. I&#39;m going to buy
Sandra&#39;s magnets...they are beautiful. Thank you for helping our family
enjoy a closeness that is so sweet and priceless.<br><br>&nbsp;To Sandra and all
other contributors, the amount of time that you spend helping others is
so appreciated. <br><br class="ygrps-yiv-1191082769" style="">Kristen<div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1191082769"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1191082769"></div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094261940"><div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>I&#39;d like to share my thanks to Sandra and this generous group as well as share a story. <br><br>My 7 yr old son, Obi, recently tried a video I found that combined two of his current fascinations....problem-solving and zombies. Obi&#39;s thrilled with the game and couldn&#39;t wait to share it with one of his best friends, a 9 yr old boy who also homeschools, but with a curriculum and top-down structure. Math vs zombies is intended for the explicitly educational market, but that&#39;s not why I chose it. We play lots of video games; some are more fun than others. When a family member, child or adult, has an interest we all are on the look-out for opportunities to explore further. <br>
<br></div>When Obi shared the game with his friend, the boy insisted that it was a boring game and that he didn&#39;t want to play because his mom makes him do math. He asked why my son would choose to do math problems when he could be playing some other fun game. Obi said, &quot;because it is fun,&quot; and shrugged it off. <br>
<br>Later my son talked with me about it. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t get it. How can numbers be boring? I mean, it&#39;s like saying you don&#39;t like food because somebody made you eat.&quot;<br><br></div><div>Yup.<br></div>
<br></div>Thank you, Sandra and all the others who share their experience here. I&#39;m a better parent for it. I&#39;m also a happier person, and I think my kids and husband would say they are too.<br><br>Tori<br></div>mama to Obi &amp; Tolinka, partner with Ray<br>
