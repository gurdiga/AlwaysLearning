<div id="ygrps-yiv-630825648">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Happy Birthday to all. <br/>
<br/>
My mom turned 71 on the 24th and my sister and brother are in an ugly argument<br/>
about how they each parent. Mom wants all 4 of us kids to celebrate her birth<br/>
with all of our kids. My other brother and I now have the task of pleasing mom<br/>
when our sibs are being rotten. <br/>
<br/>
Ashley, that 3rd grader I think Sandra is referring to is up for trying<br/>
school. She is way serious about this. I&#39;m still not getting what she wants<br/>
from school, other than to try it out. I&#39;m thinking she wants to know school<br/>
from the inside. She has been completely unschooled her entire 8 years. So,<br/>
from those who have been in the system, do you think she will be crushed by<br/>
it? Has she had enough freedom to know how to get what she wants from school? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking she wants to ride her bike with the gang here on the court, play<br/>
at recess with lots of kids, and have a desk and a teacher. I&#39;m hoping after a<br/>
few good weeks she comes around to see that she can direct her learning way<br/>
better than a school. What if she loves it?<br/>
<br/>
We have 4 more weeks as we have always been, then bang into the system we go. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We will be at the Sactrament Home=Ed conference. Anyone up for talking some<br/>
sense into young Ashley who wants to throw her freedom away for awhile</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My granddaughter tried school this February.  She lasted a week.  Her <br/>
take?  &quot;My teacher was mean.  It was boring.  I liked lunch and recess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She had been told by her mother that she could ask to call and get picked <br/>
up if she didn&#39;t like it.  The teacher thought that wasn&#39;t a good idea and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t let her.  If you offer that option, make sure the teacher and <br/>
principal *know* that you&#39;ve offered that option and that you expect them <br/>
to make good on it.<br/>
