<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577675346">I do a live text chat (almost) every Wednesday and recently one was about math without numbers.  I might add this to the page if the transcript ever gets edited and uploaded.  (Marta, could you remind me if I forget, please?)<br/>
<br/>
I came to this from a link from the sleeping page, but hadn&#39;t noticed the biographical notes before because I was always looking at the art!<br/>
<br/>
Maurits Cornelis Escher <br/>
(17 June 1898 - 27 March 1972)<br/>
<br/>
Escher was a Dutch graphic artist known for his often mathematically inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints which feature impossible constructions, explorations of infinity, and tessellations. He portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes, figures and space.<br/>
<br/>
Although Escher had no formal training in mathematics, his understanding of math was largely visual and intuitive. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s from this page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.squidoo.com/Fine-Art-Prints-MC-Escher">http://www.squidoo.com/Fine-Art-Prints-MC-Escher</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On another page at the same site:  <br/>
<br/>
The Escher family moved to Arnhem, where M.C. Escher attended primary and secondary school. As a student M.C. did not excel, making poor grades in all subjects except drawing. He eventually failed his final exam, never officially graduating. An art teacher took an interest in M.C. Escher&#39;s drawings and taught him to make linocuts. This is a lesson Escher would use to good advantage, for the rest of his life.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maurits and Jetta&#39;s first son George Escher was born in July 1926. As testament to Escher&#39;s growing fame both King Emmanuel and Benito Mussolini attended George&#39;s christening.The Escher&#39;s had a second son Arthur born in 1930<br/>
