<div id="ygrps-yiv-283244451"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I too am Christian and a radical unschooler.  I believe that Jesus is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about<br/>
as liberal as you can get.  I&#39;m pretty sure he was into &quot;judge not&quot;, and<br/>
&quot;love one another&quot;.  I believe that the &quot;do nots&quot; of Christianity refer to<br/>
our policing our own behavior, not the behavior of others.  I feel it is my<br/>
job to try to make the world a warmer place for all people, not just the<br/>
ones who live like I do.  In all of the New Testament versions I have read,<br/>
I don&#39;t recall Jesus ever judging anyone except people who set themselves up<br/>
as &quot;religious&quot;, rather than loving, and he was definitely &quot;yoked unequally&quot;<br/>
when he dealt with humans.<br/>
<br/>
The only time I have stopped a friendship was when the persons behavior<br/>
impacted me and mine.  So I have friends who are gay, friends who are<br/>
Jewish, friends who are Pagan, friends who are divorced, friends who are<br/>
alcoholics....I even have a pen pal in prison.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Julie for sharing this.  I, too, believe as you do.  I&#39;ve been a<br/>
Christian since I was 14 but I can&#39;t seem to find fellow believers who<br/>
believe as I do.  I can&#39;t get into the judgment thing or only fellowship<br/>
with my own kind thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t attend church because I can&#39;t find one that meets my needs.  I, too,<br/>
have gay friends (I am of the firm belief it is a biological thing, not a<br/>
choice), pagan friends, wiccan friends, atheists, etc.  We all seem to<br/>
respect each others beliefs and are ok with that.  I want my kids to respect<br/>
others who are different, as well.  If either my daughter or son turns out<br/>
to be gay (pretty sure daughter is not) it won&#39;t matter in the least (except<br/>
for society and the way they will be treated/judged, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one with these beliefs!<br/>
