<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371516240"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You&#39;re ALWAYS going to feel like other people don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;understand what you are going through - because you<br/>
&gt;have very explosive, dramatic, intense, passionate<br/>
&gt;children. Some people have easygoing, mild-tempered,<br/>
&gt;and even compliant children &lt;G&gt;. They think that<br/>
&gt;because their son has a little meltdown once in a<br/>
&gt;while, when he&#39;s tired or hungry, that that is all <br/>
&gt;that you&#39;re dealing with.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you so much for this post Pam.  Your posts are<br/>
always so insightful.  I have one of each of the types<br/>
above.  Both my boys are intelligent and sensative,<br/>
but one is extremely high strung, perfectionist,<br/>
impatient, obsessive, and explosive and the other is<br/>
mellow and patient and easy going (like his Daddy..can<br/>
you guess who my oldest is more like...? :-/)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some people will always be judgmental about how<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ve parented your kids - because the kids will<br/>
&gt;probably always be temperamentally like this and <br/>
&gt;some people are really uncomfortable around super<br/>
&gt;strong emotions and they&#39;ll blame YOU for not &gt;having<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;tamed&quot; your kids. <br/>
<br/>
This is so true, and I am learning to have a thick<br/>
skin and not care what other people think of us.  It<br/>
is funny the effect that practice at this has had on<br/>
us, and on me especially.  We get more and more<br/>
outside the box and more able to follow our personal<br/>
dreams, regardless of what others think about our<br/>
goals or directions we are moving.  Our families think<br/>
we are weird, expecially mine.  I love it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So - that&#39;s my first advice -- don&#39;t compare your<br/>
&gt;kids to others and don&#39;t think you&#39;re screwing up<br/>
&gt;just because the kids are like this. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is good advice no matter what your kids are like.<br/>
 Don&#39;t compare your kids to others, don&#39;t compare your<br/>
family to others, don&#39;t even compare yourself to<br/>
others.  It falls for us under the category of te evil<br/>
E word (or E-Vile as we say around here)<br/>
&quot;Expectations.&quot;  Blech.  Sometimes though, with my<br/>
&quot;spirited&quot; son, it is hard to remember not to expect<br/>
him to be calm and patient and reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You also have to be sure you don&#39;t take on the burden<br/>
&gt;of making him be happy about it -- you do your part<br/>
&gt;and then let him be happy or unhappy as he wishes. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is important advice too.  It&#39;s something I have<br/>
to work to remember sometimes, as a child of an<br/>
alcoholic home who is used to trying to please<br/>
everyone.  I can&#39;t be responsible for the happiness or<br/>
feelings of others.  I can do my best and try to meet<br/>
them in the middle, and the rest is up to them and not<br/>
my &quot;fault.&quot;  One phrase that I like is &quot;This Space Not<br/>
for Rent&quot; or &quot;No Vacancy&quot; to remind me not to &quot;rent&quot;<br/>
space to others in my head, or in other words, not to<br/>
make THEIR problems into MY problems by taking<br/>
posession of and responsibility for them.<br/>

their own expectations and to be loved and supported for their <br/>
uniqueness.  Their spirited personalities are unique and are to be <br/>
cherished.  However, when it comes to parenting, I feel it is our job <br/>
to help them develop patience and to learn to be reasonable? This is <br/>
not to say that anything that has been written suggests differently,  <br/>
I just wanted to add that thought. <br/>
<br/>
I the tough part is knowing when a child&#39;s behavior is normal for a <br/>
child with a spirited personality and when the child is dealing with <br/>
more.  If I had chalked Virginia&#39;s unreasonable behavior up to an <br/>
intense personality, which she has, our household today would be very <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Virginia becomes very aggressive, extremely unreasonable and <br/>
billigerent when she has eaten anything with artificial colorings, <br/>
flavorings and some preservatives.  This behavior started when she <br/>
was 5 and we didn&#39;t get it figured out until she was 7.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point Pat, and we should not assume that this is<br/>
understood as a &quot;given&quot; or a no brainer.  Like Sandra<br/>
pointed out in her thread on breastfeeding modesty,<br/>
some people need a rock over the head in order to GET<br/>
what may seem common sense to others.  OF COURSE, our<br/>
job as parents includes teaching our children to have<br/>
patience, respect for others, tolerance and reasonable<br/>
behavior.  This is MORE important for kids who are<br/>
more likely to have trouble in those areas, and we<br/>
spend a lot of time trying to help Thomas in those<br/>
areas, where he struggles often.<br/>
<br/>
...&gt;the tough part is knowing when a child&#39;s behavior<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;is normal for a child with a spirited personality and<br/>
&gt;when the child is dealing with more.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This allergy aspect is true in our house too, that<br/>
Thomas has a lot of allergies and when he is<br/>
struggling with a reaction he sometimes gets<br/>
hyperactive to the point of mania and hurting others<br/>
in the house just from playing, or from<br/>
anger/agressive behavior.  <br/>
<br/>
Tonight for example, Thomas is having a reaction (we<br/>
don&#39;t know from what) and is slightly rashy, but has<br/>
been a bundle of crazed energy all evening.  Finally<br/>
this evening he gave his father a black eye by ramming<br/>
his head into him (he has a very hard head) and we<br/>
finally had to physically restrain him until his<br/>
antihistamines kicked in and he began to calm down. <br/>
He was not mad, or trying to hurt his father, just<br/>
could not calm down and was literally bouncing around<br/>
like Tigger.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know what you are going through Nanci(with an i).  Life was much <br/>
more difficult before we figured out what was causing Virginia&#39;s mood <br/>
swings.  She can now tell me if she has eaten something that affects <br/>
her.  She knows what it feels like to be affected.  Usually she can <br/>
figure out what it was that caused it.  Sometimes they don&#39;t list all <br/>
the ingredients on nutrition labels and that causes problems.<br/>
<br/>
To a lesser degree, Virginia has trouble with her blood sugar.  That <br/>
is always fun when she needs to eat and starts up.  She can&#39;t think <br/>
right and doesn&#39;t want to eat anything.  It is hard but I&#39;ve learned <br/>
I can&#39;t help her at those times.  She has to handle this on her own.  <br/>
Anything I suggest for food will be rejected but she will keep <br/>
badgering and badgering me because she can&#39;t decide what to eat.<br/>
<br/>
I wish our environment was not so toxic for kids.  The food dyes that <br/>
Virginia can&#39;t have are petroleum based.  I can&#39;t believe that is the <br/>
best substance to use for food dyes.  There are so many natural dyes -<br/>
why petroleum?<br/>
<br/>
The food manufacturers probably get a kick back for all the <br/>
ridalin(sp?)the drug companies sell.<br/>
  <br/>
When someone in the family is sensitive the whole family suffers.  <br/>
Poor Allison must feel her sister gets all the attention when we are <br/>
struggling with Virginia&#39;s moods.<br/>

 Infant mortality in the early 20th century, children dying of flu and the <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At the end of the biography of Chang and Eng, 19th century Siamese twins <br/>
(those the name was coined for), it lists the children and which died in <br/>
infancy.  Several, I think.  And these families weren&#39;t poor or ignorant, as <br/>
far as I could tell; the dads weren&#39;t fundamentalist Christians trying to <br/>
impress the neighbors; the children all had a nearby aunt and a dad and a <br/>
half--adult witnesses to say &quot;That&#39;s not good&quot; if something wasn&#39;t safe or <br/>
good.  <br/>
<br/>
One of my grandmothers had stillborn twins.  It could happen still.  But a <br/>
home birth in West Texas in the 1920&#39;s might have been problematical with <br/>
firstborn twins.   <br/>
<br/>
My other grandmother lost a baby in his first day.  &quot;He was nursing, rared <br/>
back, shuddered and died,&quot; she said.   And a fifteen year old son to a fever, <br/>
in the house, with all the other kids gathered around watching him die.  And <br/>
two of the younger kids had rheumatic fever and didn&#39;t die.  My mom&#39;s ring <br/>
and little fingers were bent from childhood, and her brother Joe Paul&#39;s too.  <br/>
They did live to cause trouble, though; Joe Paul died last month after at <br/>
least two stints in prison and teaching lots of teens to be burglars and glue <br/>
sniffers (my cousin, his niece, among them, which is why I know) and my mom&#39;s <br/>
still drinking and gambling and smoking and complaining.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t such a nice time for lots of reasons.  We have advantages out the <br/>
wazoo.  <br/>

&gt; wazoo.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From the book I mentioned in my previous post --<br/>
<br/>
In the 1950&#39;s newspapers and magazines regularly printed frightening <br/>
photographs of polio-stricken children encased in the iron lungs that <br/>
artificially maintained their breathing...<br/>
...Today&#39;s medical practices could have proven useful to polio patients of <br/>
the 1950&#39;s.  The confining iron lung would have been replaced by a simple <br/>
plastic tube connected to a small portable ventilator.  Physical therapy <br/>
techniques could have prevented the contraction of muscles....<br/>
<br/>
Even as polio became only a bad memory, other health threats haunted <br/>
Americans.  Measles, mumps and scarlet fever were scourges of childhood.  <br/>
Ninety percent of all children prior to the mid-1960&#39;s &quot;caught the measles.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tuberculosis was also very common.  (My mil spent a couple of *years* in a <br/>
sanitarium, separated form her parents and her family, when she was only four <br/>
years old because she had TB.  The family did not own a car, so her parents <br/>
couldn&#39;t even visit her frequently.  At her age, pre-reading, letters had to <br/>
be simple, phone calls were long distance and very expensive, it was <br/>
undoubtedly traumatic. ) <br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s government programs ensure that most if not all children have access <br/>
to medical care.  In 1965, 20% of children whose family income was below the <br/>
poverty level had never been examined by a doctor.  By 1970, that number had <br/>
dropped to 8%.<br/>
<br/>
In the 1940&#39;s and 50&#39;s, factory smokestacks (I remember the black, thick <br/>
smoke emanating from these) and auto emissions polluted the air.  Since the <br/>
environmental laws passed in the 70&#39;s smog in the US has been reduced by 1/3 <br/>
and invisible pollutants (such as acid rain) have been cut nearly 50%.  <br/>
Rivers were polluted.  Fishing on Lake Erie was banned and dumped factory <br/>
waste in Ohio caused the Cuyahoga River to catch fire.  Today, twice as many <br/>
lakes and streams are safe for fishing and swimming as were in 1970.<br/>
<br/>
Homes are less toxic today.  Asbestos and/or formaldehyde used to be found in <br/>
insulation.  Radon gas fro decaying radium in the soil beneath basements can <br/>
be cancerous.  Gardens were sprayed with DDT -- a powder originally used to <br/>
disinfect soldiers of body lice. Trucks and airplanes sprayed clouds of DDT <br/>
over fields and homes.  <br/>
<br/>
Between 1942 and 1953, Love canal in Niagra Falls NY was legally used as a <br/>
dumping site for chemical toxic waste, over 21 tons during that period of <br/>
time.  In the 50&#39;s the dump was closed and capped and a school was built on <br/>
top of the capped land.  Ultimately the clay cap was disrupted and the waste <br/>
went to the water supply.  Kids came home with skin rashes and chemical burns <br/>
after playing outside.  Areas of vegetation died without any apparent reason. <br/>
 Foul-smelling liquids bubbled out of the ground.  There was a higher than <br/>
normal rate of birth defects, leukemia, and mental retardation.  It turned <br/>
out that over400 chemicals were identified in the canal, some in levels <br/>
exceeding five thousand times the maximum safe level.  Two hundred and thirty <br/>
six families had to leave their now worthless homes to face uncertain health <br/>
futures.<br/>
<br/>
During the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s the government tested nuclear bombs in Nevada and <br/>
New Mexico.  Over 2,000 tests have been conducted all around the world.  <br/>
Areas surrounding test sites had high rates of birth defects and <br/>
cancer-related illnesses from the radioactive clouds that drift above areas <br/>
after the detonations.  Radioactive fallout from the tests were ingested <br/>
through the air and the food over the entire country.  The nation&#39;s milk <br/>
supply had been contaminated by strontium 90 fallout from hydrogen bomb <br/>
explosions.  Studies in 1983 revealed that all Americans received at least <br/>
some radiation fallout during that period.  People living closest to or <br/>
directly downwind of the blast sites were heavily exposed.  Radioactive <br/>
materials fell on farms as far away as New York State -- absorbed by crops, <br/>
farm animals and into the earth.  According to a study done in 1997, <br/>
Americans were exposed to varying levels of radioactive iodine 131 for two <br/>
months following each of the ninety atomic tests in Nevada during the 50&#39;s <br/>
and 60&#39;s, radiation extended beyond the test site and was detected as far <br/>
away as New England and the Northwest.  Radioactive iodine accumulates in the <br/>
thyroid gland and children, because they drink more milk than adults (and <br/>
apparently it likes milk) got 3-7 times more than the average dose of <br/>
radiation because of the milk consumption.  <br/>
<br/>
Between 1949 and 1969, the US Army released bacteria and chemical agents in <br/>
major American cities including New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC <br/>
to simulate chemical and biological warfare.  A number of residents of those <br/>
cities later reported unexplainable illnesses and birth-related problems.  <br/>
<br/>
Egads.  I could go on and on.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919381768">A little over 20 years ago my boys got an impetigo<br/>
infection starting in tick bites that wouldn&#39;t go<br/>
away, so we went to the doctor.  Our doctor (in<br/>
Tallahassee, I lived about 30 miles away outside of<br/>
Sopchoppy) presicribed some anribiotics, told me to<br/>
kill the dogs and move. Huh? I said but I couldn&#39;t. <br/>
He said at least give the dogs away. Huh? He said then<br/>
the problem wouldn&#39;t be his patient&#39;s. Then he asked<br/>
&quot;Why did you move to the country, anyway?&quot;  I<br/>
explained that we wanted the idyllic country life. His<br/>
reply, as he kicked the examining room door shut was<br/>
&quot;God dammit Woman!! Let me tell you about the idyllic<br/>
country life!! My father before me was a country<br/>
doctor in rural South Georgia!!!&quot; then he told me<br/>
about it. He should be close to or in his 80&#39;s now. <br/>
My older boys still use his services.  We didn&#39;t move<br/>
or shoot the dogs either. <br/>

been made over the years and I *am* very thankful for the life I have <br/>

improvements that they benefited from even though these were times we <br/>
see as having been so horrible.  <br/>

I don&#39;t understand why so many children need to be medicated.  What <br/>
is causing an increase in ADD, ADHD and bipolar disorder.  Why are so <br/>
many children and adults on Prozac and anti-anxiety medication?  <br/>
Maybe in 20, 30 or 40 years these next generations will look back at <br/>
our lives today and be glad they didn&#39;t have to live the way we live.<br/>

Hormones and antibiotics and such given to livestock? <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s clear that most children *don&#39;t* need to be medicated and that a <br/>
lot of what passes for ADD/ADHD is simply what happens when a child is forced <br/>
into a system that is counter to his temperament/personality/gifts/talents.  <br/>
For example, in teens it has been shown that their bodies not only need <br/>
additional sleep for growth, for it is during sleep that the human growth <br/>
hormone is released, but also they undergo a kind of metabolic internal <br/>
timeclock shift that keeps them awake to a later hour.  But high schools <br/>
routinely start as early as 7:00 a.m.  Why?  These kids need sleep and <br/>
without it they suffer from depression, agitation, loss of focus, all kinds <br/>
of stuff.  So instead of moving back the time school starts for teens, they <br/>
label them, medicate them, and stigmatize them.  <br/>

<br/>
The definition of it.  The label itself allows more people to be marked with <br/>
the label, or to say &quot;That sounds like me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why are so <br/>
many children and adults on Prozac and anti-anxiety medication?  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because they exist!<br/>
<br/>
Nobody drank coffee before it was discovered.  Nobody drank Dr Pepper before <br/>
it was invented.<br/>
<br/>
Those things are progress.  When people got depressed years ago they were <br/>
told to pray about it.  When people were hyperactive years ago, they just did <br/>
the laundry faster, or build more fences, or rode horses into the wilderness <br/>
and killed something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259988005">My husbands grandmother has stories that would curl your toes.  Heck Joe<br/>
even remembers when they got an inside toilet in the late 1960s.<br/>
<br/>
Grandma takes me for rides when we are back visiting, she tells me wonderful<br/>
stories of who lived where, who died from what.  She gave birth to her first<br/>
daughter, alone, in a tar paper/wood shack in the mountains of West<br/>
Virginia - a pump inside for running water and an outhouse - the wind would<br/>
whistle in between the slats of wood.  Her husband had gone for help and<br/>
Joe&#39;s aunt was born before anyone got there.  She bore five children at home<br/>
and three in the hospital.  Her husband was in WW2 and was MIA for almost 2<br/>
years.  This woman can can, cook, bake, make clothes, chop wood - you name<br/>
it.  By no means does she pine for the good old days.  She likes being able<br/>
to buy meat without killing and cleaning the animal, she likes soap from the<br/>
store, she makes handmade goods still because that is what she can afford<br/>
and it is important to her to continue to be independent.  She cans and<br/>
freezes her veggies cause it costs too dern much to drive over the mountain<br/>
and pay big store prices(she still lives on the mountain).  Grandma was a<br/>
widow at 31, she has buried parents, children, a husband, and grandchildren.<br/>
When she makes a statement such as you don&#39;t know how good you have it - she<br/>
is not intending to be condescending, it is the truth.  Personally, I think<br/>
we should all (including children) be reminded of how good we have it, a<br/>
reality check of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
Joe has some stories too, some of his childhood and others from being in the<br/>
military for 12 years - most he cares not to share.<br/>

disorders are just now being recognized as having a physical cause. In the <br/>
past, these were the folks who were locked up in mental institutions or back <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921131103">My son has a form of autism (Asperger&#39;s Syndrome).  There has been over an<br/>
massive increase in autism in the past 15 yrs.  No one knows why  Same thing<br/>
with ADD/ADHD and bipolar.<br/>
<br/>
Theories abound as to why the high increase.  You can only argue<br/>
overdiagnoses so far....then you meet these kids and see how real the<br/>
problems are.  This is not a matter of &quot;accepting who your child is and<br/>
dealing with the difficulties&quot;.  Far from it.  The issues these kids have<br/>
can make it impossible for a family to function.  Years ago they would have<br/>
been put in institutions or shunned.<br/>
<br/>
My son takes medication for anxiety.  Without it all he does is chews<br/>
clothes to bits and has about 20 big tantrums a day over &quot;nothing&quot;.  With it<br/>
(Zoloft), he can go places, meet people, play games, and even eat a meal<br/>
without breaking down over a drop of spilled drink.   I am incredibly<br/>
grateful I had my son at a time when these disorders can be recognized *and*<br/>
have options for treatment.<br/>
<br/>
We homeschool so that Matthew does have a place he is accepted for who he<br/>
is.  He doesn&#39;t have to be forced into a school mold.  But that does not<br/>
negate the need he has for medication.<br/>

I only know what a difference it has made for my daughter and would <br/>
never want to imply that it would work for all other children but I <br/>
was wondering.<br/>
<br/>
I asked my kids pediatrician why he doesn&#39;t recommend it to people.  <br/>
He said it was too difficult for people to stick to.  I guess if you <br/>
assume people are incapable of this they will be.<br/>
<br/>
I think if more people used the diet there would be more demand for <br/>
artifial dye and flavor free things.  The one area we have the most <br/>
trouble is in over the counter as well as prescription medication for <br/>
children.<br/>
