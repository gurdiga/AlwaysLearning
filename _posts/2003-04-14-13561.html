 </span></blockquote>Nah.  I wouldn&#39;t have cut it out myself, either, unless there was absolutely <br/>
no other choice.  I don&#39;t get grossed out like that anymore, but I used to.  <br/>
It was about worms.  Couldn&#39;t eat, kept thinking about them and getting sick. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now Will has the same kind of thing going on.  Can&#39;t eat for DAYS if he&#39;s <br/>
seen worms.  But you know, we had our little learning co-op a couple of weeks <br/>
ago and it was all about WORMS.  He did fine with the ideas of worm castings, <br/>
etc., but when it was time to put his worm in the bottle to take home to <br/>
watch it make tunnels, he couldn&#39;t do it.  Michelle did it for him, and he <br/>
looked at the tunnels later, but only after I made sure the worm wasn&#39;t in <br/>
them.  He did see worms that day, and when I told everyone about it, he still <br/>
was able to eat some at snacktime.  I think it worked a little to make him <br/>
less sensitive about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you went ahead and thought about it some more and got used to the <br/>
idea?  Take deep breaths and run it through your head like a movie?   Kind of <br/>
like when someone has a phobia about escalators they take them to ride one in <br/>
the mall?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dawn and everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh at this because I was thinking the exact same thing and <br/>
wondered if I was some horrific person because everyone here was so grossed <br/>
out. I love that stuff. I&#39;m always watching trauma in the ER and paramedics <br/>
and CSI is our family favorite. When I was six I announced that I wanted to <br/>
become a coroner! I always stayed up late to watch Quincy, M.E. Oddly, I <br/>
never did even though I still love it. I have some serious medical problems <br/>
myself so I have to do several different types of daily injections. My hubby <br/>
can&#39;t even watch me fill the syringe without feeling sick. But then again he <br/>
fears ever crossing me cuz poking him with on of those needles would be <br/>
enough to give him a heart attack.LOL I think he&#39;d just as soon drive himself <br/>
to the hospital if he did what Keith did, because he knows I&#39;d be thrilled to <br/>
get to operate. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day everyone.<br/>

&gt; That kind of panic reaction is just freaky.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reminded me.  Get some Rescue Remedy.  I&#39;m not much into homeopathy or herbs, <br/>
but I&#39;ve seen that stuff work at calming an injured child down over and over <br/>
again, and I&#39;m a believer.  We were at the zoo Friday and one of the little <br/>
kids in our co-op fell off the bleachers and cut his head open.  This is a <br/>
kid who screams in terror or rage or whatever at the slightest blip.  His <br/>
mother didn&#39;t know what to do except hold him, and I had her apply pressure <br/>
to the wound, and then someone whipped out the Rescue Remedy.  He was <br/>
screaming and crying and bleeding.  I sprayed it on his head and grabbed one <br/>
of his wrists and gave him another squirt.  He didn&#39;t know what it was.  But <br/>
he literally stopped crying within 5 seconds!  <br/>
<br/>
I had been skeptical until that point.  All the people I&#39;d seen it used on <br/>
were capable of &quot;believing&quot; in it.  This kid didn&#39;t even know what it was, <br/>
and he&#39;s known as a screamer who won&#39;t stop until he&#39;s good and done.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, maybe you can keep some around for YOURSELF, in case you have to do <br/>
that queasy stuff again.<br/>
