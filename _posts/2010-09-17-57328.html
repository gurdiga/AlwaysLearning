<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548956200">&quot;I love reading about bad days. Sometimes everyone seems so perfect  <br/>
and I am far from it. I like being reminded that we are both indeed  <br/>
human and doing our best.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a quote from this list.  It was an anonymous (seemed; not a  <br/>
name on it, really) comment on a blog post in which a mom had admitted  <br/>
to having had a bad day.  Before reading that blog post, I had  <br/>
admitted to a bad day here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2010/09/some-problems-with-respect.html">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2010/09/some-problems-with-respect.html</a><br/>
(in a note under the photos).<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t &quot;love reading about bad days.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago on this list, I think it was, someone asked for  <br/>
us all to describe our screw-ups and failures so she would feel  <br/>
better, and Pam Sorooshian wrote something eloquent.  If someone is  <br/>
feeling up to an archive search, that might make a good quote here.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that it&#39;s GOOD to share screwups to make other people feel  <br/>
better for being far from perfect doesn&#39;t seem like a good use of the  <br/>
writing and reading time of all the people on this list (nor of any of  <br/>
them, frankly).   No one should need to be reminded that we are all  <br/>
human.  What else would we be?  Humans are human.<br/>
<br/>
But to be reminded that we are doing our best?  When we&#39;re writing  <br/>
about failures?<br/>
<br/>
Failure is not my best.  Having an argument with Holly is not &quot;doing  <br/>
my best.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Encouraging people to comfort themselves with tales of failure is not  <br/>
the way to help people create a rich life of joy and wonder for their  <br/>
children.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There was an article, an interview with a lot of parents on how  <br/>
they&#39;re doing raising kids and the conclusion was families were  <br/>
stressed and muddling through barely adequately. (Sorry I wish I could  <br/>
find it but I can&#39;t even remember enough to Google. It may have been  <br/>
just before vacation so I didn&#39;t have enough attention to give it.)<br/>
<br/>
But what I do remember was a comment by a guy who said he hoped there  <br/>
would be a documentary because it would be so relieving.<br/>
<br/>
That probably comes from a place of guilt. He and other parents know  <br/>
they aren&#39;t doing great. And there&#39;s a feeling everyone else is doing  <br/>
better. But because they don&#39;t know how to do better, don&#39;t know  <br/>
anything other than &quot;trying harder&quot;, they have this guilt building up.<br/>
<br/>
What a documentary of other muddling along parents would do is allow  <br/>
him to say &quot;Well, at least I&#39;m not that bad,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m doing just as  <br/>
poorly as most everyone else.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s not a personal  <br/>
failure but a problem that baffles most everyone so it&#39;s okay if your  <br/>
parenting is at the level of not sucking as bad as the parents down  <br/>
the street with the pregnant teen, or the family with the son who&#39;s  <br/>
been arrested *again*.<br/>
<br/>
I think for mainstream parents it isn&#39;t possible to do better because  <br/>
they have a goal labeled &quot;Good Parenting&quot; that&#39;s really a vague  <br/>
collection of subgoals they don&#39;t realize that they need to clarify.  <br/>
And the tools for &quot;Good Parenting&quot; require them to sacrifice one  <br/>
subgoal for another and the subgoals don&#39;t all head in the same  <br/>
direction anyway, so &quot;Good Parenting&quot; can&#39;t get anywhere except by  <br/>
luck of genes and personalities that happen to be compatible with the  <br/>
parents&#39; tools.<br/>
<br/>
People want those who are seemingly doing radical unschooling  <br/>
effortlessly to say, &quot;Yes, I screw up too,&quot; to ease their guilt so  <br/>
they can use the energy they poured into the guilt to keep on keeping  <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Guilt is good for stopping people from repeating the same mistake.  <br/>
Guilt won&#39;t help people *do* better, though. Nor will lack of guilt.  <br/>
It&#39;s wanting something better and clarity about what you want. It&#39;s  <br/>
knowledge about how you can get there and what it will cost. It&#39;s  <br/>
working at a problem to find clarity. It&#39;s asking for help to clarify  <br/>
and get ideas. It&#39;s trying ideas. It&#39;s thinking about what worked or  <br/>
didn&#39;t and why to get more clarity and then working at it some more.<br/>
<br/>
A shift in parenting won&#39;t just happen. What people see in posts from  <br/>
long time posters isn&#39;t effortless understanding but the culmination  <br/>
of thousands of hours of doing (eg, *trying* ideas some of which  <br/>
succeed and some of which fail), thinking,  doing, asking, doing,  <br/>
discussing, doing, and reading. There isn&#39;t a short cut. It takes  <br/>
dedicated focus on the goal.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully some of the experience passed on from long time posters will  <br/>
help newer people avoid some of the really wrong turnings we all  <br/>
stumbled through but no one can hand anyone understanding. (That&#39;s  <br/>
what schools try to do.) Understanding comes from doing, thinking,  <br/>
asking, discussing, and reading.<br/>

Or, just paralyzing them, so they stay in the same pattern.<br/>
<br/>
My dentist and his assistant love to use guilt tactics to `motivate&#39; me to floss religiously.  The slightest imperfection in my gums is discussed in whispered tones behind me as if I&#39;m some kind of terminal patient.  It&#39;s funny whenever I go to the dentist, I always feel like I&#39;m back at school being judged, graded and guilted. After returning to the dentist after a missed appointment the assistant commented that it was good to see me and,  as if she&#39;d won, asked if the guilt finally made me come in.  Yes, she used the word directly.  I said, &quot;Certainly not.  Wanting my teeth clean is why I came here.&quot;  She was a bit put off by my reply.<br/>
<br/>
Guilt is a poor motivator, for sure.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794934932">Just being aware of what is transpiring on a moment by moment basis and<br/>
noticing how it feels does more to move (motivate) me than any amount of<br/>
self-induced or other guilt, shame, whatever. I can naturally tune into<br/>
choices when I pay attention to my feelings rather than thinking and talking<br/>
in rote ways about guilt or what I &quot;should&quot; do or be. Tuning into feelings<br/>
isn&#39;t something I do automatically, and now that I am consciously doing<br/>
that, the need for formulaic ideas about what to do is superfluous.<br/>
<br/>
It really isn&#39;t trust so much as mindfulness. That&#39;s different than trusting<br/>
in something nebulous.<br/>
<br/>
Contrast that with habitual behavior: Does a dog improve when someone says<br/>
&quot;bad dog?&quot; Do we interact with the dog in a way that inspires change or are<br/>
we simply &quot;training&quot; ourselves as we &quot;train&quot; the dog. I don&#39;t think anything<br/>
change-worthy happens. That can be a mostly unconscious thoughtless<br/>
interaction every time. And one can &quot;try very hard&quot; and get nowhere. When<br/>
the dog behaves again in similar ways, someone just gets another chance to<br/>
say &quot;bad dog.&quot; Again. It&#39;s easy to do the same thing with ourselves and<br/>
others. It puts layers between self and action, between self and our<br/>
children (and others). That&#39;s one result of labeling people and actions and<br/>
things like that. It&#39;s an avoidance of making actual changes.<br/>
<br/>
Habitual formulaic repetitive well-rehearsed behavior eventually seems<br/>
&quot;natural&quot; and easy, like falling off a log. Easy. Changing back to what I<br/>
want to do and be can become no longer natural.<br/>
<br/>
It takes just a bit of time, a moment, to stop and ask why or to notice<br/>
how I feel about my part in something when I hit a wall with others and in<br/>
my own thinking (when I find myself being repetitive). Each one of those<br/>
moments can add up to lots of change over time in the way I behave.<br/>

<br/>
Not only is it not personal, it&#39;s sent by someone who didn&#39;t write it.  How sincere can THAT be!?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I do buy a greeting card with text written by someone else.  Sometimes I do quote another writer.  But this sort of &quot;praise&quot; which isn&#39;t praise and &quot;support&quot; which isn&#39;t support is out there.  I guess I&#39;d like to keep it out there, and not in here on Always Learning.<br/>
<br/>
The example above was on a friend&#39;s facebook page posted by someone I don&#39;t know.  Chain-letter support.  As a game, it&#39;s kind of sweet.  If it&#39;s not kept separate, mentally and intellectually, from actual communication, it seems almost harmful.</div>
