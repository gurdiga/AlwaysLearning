<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621158315">I was wandering through The Smithsonian magazine archives and found this article <br/>
on Alexander Fleming, the man renowned for discovering penicillin: <br/>

 Apparently he painted with bacteria, culturing different strains for their <br/>
colours. So his finding of penicillin was in part him looking for new colours to <br/>
add to his pallatte. It reminded me of the idea that following a single goal or <br/>
idea can open up the world of ideas to someone. <br/>
