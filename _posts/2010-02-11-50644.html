Yes. It&#39;s another topic. I might not be considered up on this topic because<br/>
I have one child only. However, we still deal with the above when one or<br/>
more of us 3 (counting both me, Karl and his dad together) want to stay and<br/>
one wants to leave or vice versa. I bring a book, knitting or drawing stuff<br/>
to do, Karl brings his DS, or a newish or interesting toy he wants to play<br/>
with (or usually both) and Brian is seldom at lose ends when there&#39;s someone<br/>
to talk with about cars or oil or something like that.  That helps a lot.<br/>
And actually it happens quite a bit since we live in a very rural area and<br/>
anywhere very far means one or more of us might end up being &quot;stuck&quot; with<br/>
nothing to do for a while unless we plan for the possibility.<br/>

&gt; My oldest is exactly the same way, whether it is gymnastics or choir or<br/>
&gt; anything else that she totally loves. I think it is that feeling of &quot;the way<br/>
&gt; things are is the way things are,&quot; and a change in routine has always reset<br/>
&gt; her comfort level button.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We also do the Y Childwatch thing on occasion, and yesterday we went for<br/>
&gt; the first time after months of not going. Both my daughters were excited to<br/>
&gt; stay and asked if we can go again next week. But we&#39;ll see how next week<br/>
&gt; goes!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically, I honor their decision about whether or not they want to stay.<br/>
&gt; Because *I&#39;M* the one with an expectation (a workout), I have found it<br/>
&gt; important to prepare myself for leaving, that way there is no negative<br/>
&gt; outcome for them if I&#39;m disappointed about missing my class. If we leave, we<br/>
&gt; can go to the park, or get hot chocolate, or whatever, since we&#39;re already<br/>
&gt; out. If we stay, I&#39;m thrilled, but I don&#39;t place the burden of my happiness<br/>
&gt; on their choice, I can just secretly smile as I sweat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my experience, when my little ones know it&#39;s a choice they can make, and<br/>
&gt; that I will honor their feelings about the situation, their comfort level<br/>
&gt; seems higher overall.  Yes, there will be times when they want to skidaddle<br/>
&gt; right away, but other times they are happy to to stay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The harder part for me is when one wants to leave and the other wants to<br/>
&gt; stay...that is possibly another topic. :)<br/>
