<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746667518">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Any other people done the country move thing with<br/>
kids? How did you cope? How long does it take before<br/>
the home sickness wears off?<br/>

I was lucky with Tamzin. She loves being here. I did<br/>
notice, however, that when I was feeling particularly<br/>
homesick, Tamzin picked up on it and started to become<br/>
homesick herself. Like someone else said, as they make<br/>
friends and connections (and you as well) I&#39;m sure it<br/>
will pass. Going across country on a great adventure<br/>
(like you were talking about before) would be a great<br/>
way to take all of your minds off being homesick.<br/>
