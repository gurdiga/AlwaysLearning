<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878367928">I had joked about it in chats, and talked about it in person with people, about having a conference and calling it Always Learning In Person, or Always Learning Live.   It&#39;s happening.  I know there are lots of unschooling gatherings s people can attend.  Holly and I will be at the InHome conference in Illinois in March, which is HUGE and filled with workshops.  We will be at Good Vibrations in San Diego in September, which will have a beach outing with surfing (and Marty might go, too, and wear a shirt this time--they had promised wet suits, but dude!  They didn&#39;t bring &#39;em... poor Marty was wounded)...<br/>
<br/>
All three will be in Albuquerque.  People could drive or fly, and flying will not require a rental car; the hotel has a small shuttle van.<br/>
These might be the first of more, or the full set of three.  I don&#39;t know yet.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t decide against any conferences you were committed to attending, but please consider one of these quieter, gentler extensions of the Always Learning list.  There will be no speakers who aren&#39;t active list members or the children of list members.  The discussions will be all unschooling, all the time. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Dates and sketchy details:<br/>
<br/>
July 26-30, 2011  Always Learning Live Unschooling Symposium and Kirby&#39;s 25th Birthday Party, with Pam and Rosie Sorooshian<br/>
 (and probably more Dodds, and maybe more Sorooshians)<br/>
<br/>
December 28-January 31, 2011  Always Learning Live Unschooling Symposium, Winter Session with Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
 (and probably some Dodds, maybe more Fetterolls, and possibly some Sorooshians, and maybe another speaker who would be Deb Lewis if I could have my way and if she&#39;s willing and available)<br/>
<br/>
July 23-27, 2012  Always Learning Live Unschooling Symposium, Fifth Learn Nothing Day<br/>
<br/>
Summer sessions have a big pool available.  <br/>
Winter session has an outdoor hot tub.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the note on conference rates for rooms. &quot;Upgraded&quot; means refrigerator and microwave.<br/>
<br/>
 $51 + taxes (Standard rooms) and $61 + taxes (Upgraded rooms). The rates are for 1-2 adults; each additional adult is $10 more nightly. Youth 18-under stay free with parent or guardian. The rates also include the Deluxe Breakfast Buffet with hot and cold foods in the morning. For your convenience, we also offer the complimentary airport shuttle service.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll build a FAQ page for people wanting to start thinking about attending one (or maybe two, or possibly three) of these, here:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/all">http://sandradodd.com/all</a><br/>
<br/>
The hotel is three miles from my house, so maybe we could do a few house tours for the really curious. :-)  Perhaps as a fundraiser.   Auction off staying at my house instead of at the hotel.  (Joking... maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll continue to add to that Questions/Answers FAQ page as I know more, but you might want to set aside some time and start saving some money to meet people from this list and hang out in a nice little conference center in a leisurely fashion.  People who were at the SUSS conference in Santa Fe know that I don&#39;t especially love super-busy conferences where people end up without shared experiences (or even without having seen each other, sometimes).  So it will be rich in information, but intimate.  No 9:00 a.m. sessions.  No long hikes between presentations.  Time to sit and visit and play games.  I expect there will be lots of table games and board games and toys to play with.<br/>
<br/>
It will be fine for people who aren&#39;t on the list to attend, for sure, but speakers will be invited based on their value to the Always Learning discussions.  (If there are list members you would especially like to hear in person, write to me in private and I&#39;ll consider asking for a future session, or for panel discussions of sorts.   I have a few in mind too.  Let&#39;s don&#39;t discuss people in public, though; seriously.)<br/>

We&#39;ll have safety in numbers.  Solidarity.  We can spot each other to try to prevent learning.<br/>

God luck with that! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 That maybe a good question: How can we prevent learning?<br/>
Like that page Sandra has How to Screw Up Unschooling.<br/>
