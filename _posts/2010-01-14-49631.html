<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748397021">I mentioned before that we had a &quot;school&quot; room in our house where my step-son&#39;s grandmother has &quot;done school&quot; with Julian for several years.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that we are changing things and easing into an unschooling way of life, I want to remove the &quot;school&quot; association from that room.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, the room is directly across from Julian&#39;s bedroom, on the second floor.  It&#39;s not all that easily accessible during the day, mainly because we hang out on the first floor, where all the computers are, and where things are a little more accessible for the baby.  Julian likes to be on the first floor, where his dad is, and the kitchen and all that.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m trying to decide -- and maybe a good thing to do would be to ask Julian what HE would like to do with the room -- but I could give him some possible ideas to explore.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s got a great south-facing window, and I thought maybe we could set a shelf up there and use it as a propagation room for his new business venture -- growing green beans to sell at the farmers markets where we work.<br/>
<br/>
We got a new computer for Christmas, with a new printer, and the initial idea was to put the printer up there so that he could carry the laptop back and forth and print things out for &quot;school.&quot;  But now, I&#39;m not so sure we should do that ... unless he wants to for now.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve got an awesome microscope that J always wants to play with, but there&#39;s no good place for it here on the first floor -- I could set it up up there, and that could be its permanent home for whenever he brings things in to look at.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of reluctant to put many of our books or things up there, because I think when he&#39;s on fire to look something up, he&#39;ll more likely go to the books and computers if they&#39;re down here on the first floor.  He&#39;s more likely to say, nah, I don&#39;t want to go upstairs to look it up.  I&#39;ll do it later.<br/>
<br/>
We *could* put more of his toys and stuff in there, and make it more of a play room, as well as the propagation room...<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of possibilities.  It&#39;s a cool little room.  It&#39;s got its own sink and toilet, and a couple of built-in bookshelves that could be used for other stuff, collections or toys or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
As he gets older, if we just make it sort of his room to do what he wants with, then it will evolve, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
