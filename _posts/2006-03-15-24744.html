I think it&#39;s quite humorous in my twisted way that now that we aren&#39;t  <br/>
trying to cram down phonics, which I never understood, she is  <br/>
starting to read simply words on her own, and through her own means.   <br/>
It&#39;s just that little, YEAH!<br/>
<br/>
The other day she wrote the word Dad on a piece of paper, came up and  <br/>
said, it says dad.  Yup so cool.  And that came just from her love of  <br/>
handwriting and drawing.  I figured that since my oldest son taught  <br/>
himself to read at 2 1/2 that she would have to be taught.  Now I  <br/>
know though and every kid learns when left in freedom in their own  <br/>
time and own pace.  What a joy to see happen.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I joined because I am unschooling<br/>
&gt; my kids again after a brief lapse of my common sense thinking they<br/>
&gt; needed a set curriculum to learn.  Actually it was my fear of having<br/>
&gt; to teach my kindergartener how to read.  I know now what I have<br/>
&gt; always known, she will learn when she is ready and not a moment<br/>
&gt; before and she will teach herself.<br/>

&gt; Raven, you&#39;re already calm, but for the benefit of anyone who read<br/>
&gt; that paragraph and felt a knot in the stomach, I wanted to use it as<br/>
&gt; a jumping off place to throw this link out:<br/>

&gt; And here&#39;s one just as a reminder that learning doesn&#39;t need reading:<br/>
