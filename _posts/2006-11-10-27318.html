       Notes from Heather<br/>
    =======================<br/>
<br/>
  A few weeks ago I invited readers to write in about their local<br/>
  homeschool co-ops.  One reader shared about her Charlotte Mason<br/>
  based co-op and I thoroughly enjoyed reading about it!  I thought<br/>
  you  would be as inspired as I was, so here it is for YOUR enjoyment,<br/>
  as well.  Grab a cup of tea and enjoy this issue! -- Heather<br/>

<br/>
  A Charlotte Mason Co-op<br/>
     by Janey Phillips, (a reader in Texas)<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I am part of a co-op this year that was formed to implement the<br/>
  Charlotte Mason style of learning.  The moms all wanted to have the<br/>
  co-op provide opportunities for some of the things that seemed to get<br/>
  &#39;skipped&#39; at home.  We have eighteen kids who participate and the<br/>
  age range is from 9 to 16, with the 11 to 13 age being the predominate<br/>
  group.  Moms share the teaching responsibilities.  We meet one day<br/>
  a week, for 3 hours.  Almost all of the participants are also involved<br/>
  in a homeschool string orchestra that is taught by one of our co-op<br/>
  moms; they meet the same day,  from 10:00 to about 11:15.  After<br/>
  orchestra, some of the co-op moms gather at the meeting location<br/>
  and eat picnic lunches with our families.  Lately we&#39;ve had such<br/>
  pleasant weather, we&#39;ve eaten outside the building under shade trees.<br/>
  This gives moms a chance to visit before classes begin, and the kids<br/>
  eat, then run off to play together.<br/>
<br/>
  Our class time begins at 12.  We have an introductory Latin class,<br/>
  using Latina Christiana; four of the eighteen students had already<br/>
  passed this point in Latin, so during the Latin class they work on<br/>
  individual studies brought from home in another room, or a couple<br/>
  of them might play a game of chess.<br/>
<br/>
  Then we have a class that rotates weekly between art skills, picture<br/>
  study (art appreciation), and nature study.  The mom who teaches<br/>
  the art classes is an art major & a Charlotte Mason adherent, so<br/>
  she is great for the job.  A different mom leads nature study, and<br/>
  she varies the style of class each time.  Sometimes she brings in<br/>
  nature for them to learn from; one week it was poison ivy plants and<br/>
  look-alikes, which was important before nature walks.  One week<br/>
  we did a nature walk for just 10 or 15 minutes outside the building,<br/>
  with everyone picking something to write about in nature journals.<br/>
  The nature mom has also set up a monthly field trip with a local<br/>
  state Forest Service employee.  The first one was a pond study, and the<br/>
  kids got to do water sampling, look for insects and other critters that<br/>
  live in the water, and learn about the conditions necessary for various<br/>
  species to live. Other nature field trips in the offing include a visit<br/>
  to the national forest to see the red-cockaded woodpecker habitat, a<br/>
  nature walk for the purpose of tree identification, and a night at the<br/>
  nearby college&#39;s observatory to see the stars.  We asked for and<br/>
  received a private viewing due to the size of our group, which will give<br/>
  the kids more time at the telescopes than they would otherwise have had.<br/>
<br/>
  After art/nature time we have a short 15 minute break with snacks.<br/>
  The kids are encouraged to go outside and run around.  Sword<br/>
  play and soccer ball-kicking are popular during this time. We meet<br/>
  on a church campus, so there is a small playground available also.<br/>
<br/>
  Our next class of the day is Shakespeare, and this one is age-divided.<br/>
  One mom takes the younger group on an enjoyable and fun read of a<br/>
  slightly abridged version, still in play form.  They are having a blast<br/>
  and have had sword fights, recitations, and scene enactments.  The<br/>
  older group is reading the original work of the same play, Romeo and<br/>
  Juliet, and has a Shakespeare project to complete for the term.<br/>
  Options for the project were wide-ranging in style and the students<br/>
  have already jumped into work on their projects.  One is rewriting the<br/>
  play for a children&#39;s illustrated book; one is making a Romeo and<br/>
  Juliet board game; one is writing a song for Romeo and Juliet, and a<br/>
  couple of the boys are working on websites.<br/>
<br/>
  Our final class is a science lab.  One of our moms is a biology lover,<br/>
  and she is leading the kids through dissection of four animals this<br/>
  semester. They have a class to discuss the creature and its internal<br/>
  workings one week, then actually dissect the next.  They are doing<br/>
  an earthworm, grasshopper, frog, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  We also have one mom who serves as our events coordinator.  She<br/>
  does the calling and setting up of special field trips, collects funds<br/>
  for the tickets, etc. She also coordinates the weekly snack time,<br/>
  which we rotate between moms.  Our group will attend a theater<br/>
  performance of Romeo and Juliet this month, and she arranged this<br/>
  for us, making sure we got tickets early enough to get good seating.<br/>
  Again, the size of our group lets us get tickets at half-price and we<br/>
  all voted to spring for the top price range for the event.  Later,<br/>
  during the spring semester, we plan to visit an art museum in Houston<br/>
  that will have an exhibit of French painters from the 1800s.  These art<br/>
  works are on tour from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art,<br/>
  and include Degas, Picasso, Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet, Millet, and<br/>
  others that the students will be familiar with. It is an opportunity we<br/>
  don&#39;t want them to miss.<br/>
<br/>
  One of the best things about our co-op is the richness of the experi-<br/>
  ences we are being able to provide the students.  I love walking into<br/>
  the room where the kids are engaged in drawing or dissection and<br/>
  hearing the hum from them.  It says they are really involved in the<br/>
  present activity.  When the minds are engaged that way, learning is<br/>
  happening.<br/>
<br/>
  Some things just work better in a group setting (drama for one), and<br/>
  a small co-op is the best of the good things about a &#39;classroom&#39;<br/>
  situation while still retaining the style and benefits of home educa-<br/>
  tion.  The eight moms involved were not all a closely knit group of<br/>
  friends to begin with, but were brought together for their mutual<br/>
  interest in Charlotte Mason education and the ages of their children.<br/>
  We are working together well, and though it&#39;s only about six weeks into<br/>
  our first semester, the general consensus is that we all want to<br/>
  continue.  At the end of each semester we are having a &#39;performance&#39;<br/>
  night, with the kids doing scenes from Shakespeare, showing off their<br/>
  Latin chants and recitation, and displaying nature journals, art work,<br/>
  and Shakespeare projects from the older class.  We&#39;ll invite dads,<br/>
  grandparents, friends, and have finger foods. The kids are really<br/>
  looking forward to this as well.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
  Unschooling to the Finish Line<br/>
<br/>
  [Editor&#39;s note:  I rarely get to hear from a mom who has grown<br/>
  children who unschooled &#39;all the way&#39;.  Even if you don&#39;t fully<br/>
  understand or agree with this method, I think you will enjoy<br/>
  reading what Elizabeth has to say!]<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I can tell everyone from experience that un-schooling works.<br/>
  I have adult children who graduated with honors from leading<br/>
  Universities. The interesting thing is they found college level<br/>
  work very simple!<br/>
<br/>
  When I started homeschooling with them, there were no web-<br/>
  sites, and very little information available. I did not like public<br/>
  school curriculum, so I decided to let them learn at their own<br/>
  pace. We wore the library out. We went to every museum<br/>
  within 500 miles and they developed a love of leaning. We built<br/>
  rockets, dug wishing wells, built a playhouse, and pretty much<br/>
  anything they decided they were interested in.<br/>
<br/>
  They learned their multiplication facts through working out plans<br/>
  for things they wanted to build. They learned algebraic functions<br/>
  by rocket and aircraft building. I found if they could find a need<br/>
  for something, they learned with total enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
  I still have one ten year old at home and he is also an un-schooler.<br/>
  He might be my brightest of all of the kids. He is completely self-<br/>
  motivated and if something interests him, he will wear out the<br/>
  books and computer until he has all the information.<br/>
<br/>
  He had NO interest in reading until age 8. Then he wanted to learn<br/>
  to read words on the computer and in 6 months he was reading on<br/>
  a 7th grade level. If I had tried to make him learn earlier, he might<br/>
  have not developed his love of reading. We could have fought from<br/>
  age 4 to learn words but I doubt he would have progressed to the<br/>
  level he is if we had been trying all those years. It might have made<br/>
  him have a dislike of reading which could never be overcome.<br/>
<br/>
  I believe children are natural learners. I don&#39;t care if mine stand on<br/>
  their heads to watch a National Geographic video, just that they<br/>
  absorb what they watch. I don&#39;t care if he sits at a desk or on his<br/>
  bed to learn his chemistry elements, just so he learns them.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess what I am trying to say is let your children be kids. Don&#39;t<br/>
  try to make them Einsteins or child prodigies. Just let them play.<br/>
  If you give them the opportunities to explore, they will learn and<br/>
  exceed all your expectations.&quot; -- Elizabeth<br/>

      Last Issue&#39;s Reader Question<br/>
    ===============================<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;We started homeschooling this year and I am wondering if there<br/>
  is a general rule to follow regarding keeping any of my children&#39;s<br/>
  elementary age work?  I don&#39;t have a lot of storage space, and we<br/>
  are not required by our state to keep a portfolio of our child&#39;s work.<br/>
  Is there anything that I should keep just for the sake of keeping a<br/>
  record or is it better to just keep &#39;scores&#39; in subject areas?  I<br/>
  only do oral testing at the moment, and even that is really relaxed.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
  &quot;I also live in NC, but I keep some of their best work every year.<br/>
  I am blessed with a large 5 drawer file cabinet and have a drawer<br/>
  for each child, with a file folder for each year, divided by grade.<br/>
  As the children produce work that I think is worth keeping or earn an<br/>
  award certificate, I just put it in their folder.  I keep things like<br/>
  handwriting samples, history notebooks, stories, artwork, and things<br/>
  I think they will be interested in seeing in the future. I do not<br/>
  keep things like spelling tests, math workbooks etc.  My 3rd grader<br/>
  already thinks her kindergarten handwriting book is a hoot and loves to<br/>
  go look through her stuff... and my 10th grader has almost filled the<br/>
  drawer!  Good thing we only have two more years!&quot; -- Cheryl in NC<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;You might want to consider keeping a sample of your child&#39;s work<br/>
  from the beginning, middle, and end of the year, stubs and pictures<br/>
  from field trips and co-op activities, and pictures of your child&#39;s<br/>
  projects (kinda&#39; difficult to save science experiments!). Put these<br/>
  in a scrapbook, if for no other reason than it will bring you and<br/>
  your family years of pleasure... and may also answer the question,<br/>
  &#39;What do you do all day?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  Making a scrapbook could be incorporated into your homeschool<br/>
  planning -- get your child involved and teach art, writing (captions,<br/>
  journalling), timelines.  One or two pages for each month with extra<br/>
  pages for special trips or projects would make a wonderful keepsake.<br/>
  It would be your child&#39;s &#39;yearbook&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
  Welcome to homeschooling!&quot; -- Tricia in NH<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;We are not required to keep any sort of a portfolio, either, but it<br/>
  is wise for several reasons - so you and your children can look back<br/>
  on what you&#39;ve done, in case anyone questions what you have done,<br/>
  and in case you become incapacitated and someone else needs to<br/>
  step in.<br/>
<br/>
  I do it in two steps:<br/>
<br/>
  1) I keep a notebook of what we do so that I will be able to check<br/>
  easily what we have accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
  2) I keep a file with samples of work - art, occasional worksheets,<br/>
  drawings, etc. I also try to take pictures on field trips.<br/>
<br/>
  Even if you are not doing testing, there are still writing projects<br/>
  and such that can easily be included in a folder.&quot; -- Elouise in BC<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;There are great programs out there for keeping track of scores<br/>
  and such on the computer.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have one to<br/>
  share right now, but I bet you could do a search online and find a<br/>
  number of great choices.  In terms of a hard copies, I think I might<br/>
  hold on to the tests or graded papers and keep a grade book, too.<br/>
  There are a number of free forms that you can use online - or you<br/>
  can go to your teacher supply store and get a grade recording book.<br/>
  Also - not sure this is a part of what you are looking for in terms<br/>
  of &#39;keeping papers and things&#39;, but it is a great tip someone gave me<br/>
  ...and I&#39;m so glad I use it.  Each year at the end of the school year<br/>
  I pick maybe a &#39;dozen&#39; keepsake papers for each child - along with<br/>
  all their test papers - and I put them in a folder to have for record<br/>
  keeping or just for our family to have and look back upon.  These<br/>
  are the only ones I keep.  If there are more papers, crafts, and<br/>
  treasures I had hoped to keep, then I put all the ones that I think<br/>
  about keeping and organize them on my bed or wherever and take<br/>
  a picture of them.  That way we don&#39;t have all that clutter and we<br/>
  can still look back and remember the MEMORY which is really<br/>
  what we are holding on to.&quot; -- Charity in NY<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I keep a manila folder of assessments and anything special that<br/>
  shows progress. For this year I have my son&#39;s kindergarten assess-<br/>
  ment, a picture he drew that showed a huge leap in the art process,<br/>
  a letter he wrote me (where love is spelled &#39;wof&#39;) and a couple math<br/>
  sheets.<br/>
<br/>
  A friend takes pictures of her children&#39;s art projects and work and<br/>
  makes them into a scrapbook with all important information such as<br/>
  when it was created, what unit it was for, and anything her boys had<br/>
  to say about the topic.&quot; -- Mia in MD<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;What I am doing this year is making a digital portfolio of my kids&#39;<br/>
  work.  I&#39;m scanning or taking digital pictures of their work and<br/>
  assignments and saving them on a disk.  This will save a ton of<br/>
  storage space and is easy to share with friends and family.&quot; -- Pam<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I&#39;ve always kept grades and samples of their work in every subject<br/>
  as well as any testing scores, transcripts etc. I have a big thick<br/>
  binder and put each year in it.  Several years can fit in one.  I<br/>
  do not think it is necessary to keep all their work.&quot; -- Penny P.<br/>
<br/>
  ---<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I live in Indiana and we are not required to save papers or keep a<br/>
  portfolio... BUT, the representative for the state suggested that we<br/>
  keep the previous year&#39;s papers till we have another year completed.<br/>
  For example:  My daughter is in 5th grade.  In our file cabinet I have<br/>
  all her 4th grade papers and I have started keeping her 5th grade<br/>
  papers in another file.  When we are completed with the 5th grade<br/>
  year, I will throw out the 4th grade papers.  This is not a state<br/>
  regulation.  The representative just strongly suggested it in case we<br/>
  were ever questioned by the state, so we would have some &#39;proof&#39; of<br/>
  our school year.&quot; -- Martha D.<br/>

     Answer our NEW Question<br/>
    =========================<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I&#39;m sure you all experience burn-out from time to time.  I am in my<br/>
  14th year of homeschooling.  I homeschooled my first born from<br/>
  beginning to graduation last year and I have three more kids to go.<br/>
  They are 9th grade, 6th grade, and 2nd grade.  So, as you can see,<br/>
  I have a long way to go.  What I&#39;m experiencing now is more than<br/>
  burn-out.  I love my kids and totally enjoy having them home with me<br/>
  everyday, I just wish I didn&#39;t have to homeschool them.  We have<br/>
  changed our curriculum and that has helped a bit.  We have lessened<br/>
  the amount of running around with activities so that we&#39;re not so<br/>
  hurried and stressed.  I know that God has called me to homeschool<br/>
  my kids, so what else can I do?&quot; -- Noreen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856613393">I&#39;ve quoted from an article that was presented in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
I think the reason the editor rarely gets to hear from a mom who has  <br/>
grown children who unschooled all the way is that she doesn&#39;t fully  <br/>
understand or agree with that method, and runs something called  <br/>
Family Classroom net.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of unschooling is better than none, I guess, but It&#39;s still  <br/>
very much about books and museums and developing a love of learning   <br/>
(it said &quot;leaning&quot; but I bet it meant &quot;learning&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
When I was first unschooling and participating in online discussions,  <br/>
we were up against lots and lots of unschoolers (who turned out to be  <br/>
temporary unschoolers, for the most part) who wrote things like this:<br/>
   I believe children are natural learners. I don&#39;t care if mine  <br/>
stand on<br/>
   their heads to watch a National Geographic video, just that they<br/>
   absorb what they watch. I don&#39;t care if he sits at a desk or on his<br/>
   bed to learn his chemistry elements, just so he learns them.<br/>
<br/>
The range of options was to read Oliver Twist in the yard or on the  <br/>
couch, or to finish a math workbook with a crayon or water colors  <br/>
instead of a ballpoint pen.<br/>
<br/>
While the article would be encouraging for someone who never heard of  <br/>
unschooling, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unschooling as I&#39;ve come to live it.<br/>

   Unschooling to the Finish Line<br/>
<br/>
   [Editor&#39;s note:  I rarely get to hear from a mom who has grown<br/>
   children who unschooled &#39;all the way&#39;.  Even if you don&#39;t fully<br/>
   understand or agree with this method, I think you will enjoy<br/>
   reading what Elizabeth has to say!]<br/>
<br/>
   &quot;I can tell everyone from experience that un-schooling works.<br/>
   I have adult children who graduated with honors from leading<br/>
   Universities. The interesting thing is they found college level<br/>
   work very simple!<br/>
<br/>
   When I started homeschooling with them, there were no web-<br/>
   sites, and very little information available. I did not like public<br/>
   school curriculum, so I decided to let them learn at their own<br/>
   pace. We wore the library out. We went to every museum<br/>
   within 500 miles and they developed a love of leaning. We built<br/>
   rockets, dug wishing wells, built a playhouse, and pretty much<br/>
   anything they decided they were interested in.<br/>
<br/>
   They learned their multiplication facts through working out plans<br/>
   for things they wanted to build. They learned algebraic functions<br/>
   by rocket and aircraft building. I found if they could find a need<br/>
   for something, they learned with total enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
   I still have one ten year old at home and he is also an un-schooler.<br/>
   He might be my brightest of all of the kids. He is completely self-<br/>
   motivated and if something interests him, he will wear out the<br/>
   books and computer until he has all the information.<br/>
<br/>
   He had NO interest in reading until age 8. Then he wanted to learn<br/>
   to read words on the computer and in 6 months he was reading on<br/>
   a 7th grade level. If I had tried to make him learn earlier, he might<br/>
   have not developed his love of reading. We could have fought from<br/>
   age 4 to learn words but I doubt he would have progressed to the<br/>
   level he is if we had been trying all those years. It might have made<br/>
   him have a dislike of reading which could never be overcome.<br/>
<br/>
   I believe children are natural learners. I don&#39;t care if mine  <br/>

<br/>
   I guess what I am trying to say is let your children be kids. Don&#39;t<br/>
   try to make them Einsteins or child prodigies. Just let them play.<br/>
   If you give them the opportunities to explore, they will learn and<br/>
   exceed all your expectations.&quot; -- Elizabeth</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805269813">Yes, I agree. My main thought was that I was pleased to see unschooling as <br/>
being represented in a crowd that doesn&#39;t generally recognize it and <br/>
legitimize it. And although I was unschooled in a very radical way, my <br/>
husband, family and the only homeschoolers I knew recognized what I did as a <br/>
type of homeschooling as the article does, because that&#39;s how I started. I <br/>
was naive and now know so much more. But it was my first step in this <br/>
journey the eventually took me back to something more similar to my parents <br/>
more true unschooling. Another brick out of the wall hopefully.<br/>

 I thought it was a great article until I got to this point.  Let me tell<br/>
you what I remember about chemistry class in high school.  Fe is iron.  H2O<br/>
is water.  I remember that I hated chemistry precisely because I had to<br/>
memorize the periodic table (I assume that�s what she meant by chemistry<br/>
elements?) and I saw no reason that this was valuable.  The other thing I<br/>
remember is that half of the experiments that I did did not yield the<br/>
results I was �supposed� to get, so I would have to look at someone else�s<br/>
to make my lab report.  But science isn�t about doing prescribed experiments<br/>
where you are supposed to get a particular answer.  It�s about your own<br/>
observations; correct me if I�m wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But it is nice to see something about unschooling in an ezine geared toward<br/>
school at homers.<br/>
