<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330571680">My kids have always had freedom of choice with movies.  They have seen  all <br/>
kinds of stuff, and still as teens will choose Alladin or Follow That Bird  as <br/>
freely as Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back or Fight Club.  Holly&#39;s  favorite <br/>
movie is still Stand By Me, but she&#39;ll watch Between the Lions and  Dragontales <br/>
and then listen to Stephen Lynch.<br/>
 <br/>
The other night Kirby, Marty and I went to the dollar theater to see  <br/>
Alexander.  A family in front of us was hesitant about some ticket, and I  think it <br/>
was Alexander.  They had a three year old girl with them but it  was already <br/>
7:45.  I think they had a time consideration.  So we  waited, thinking they <br/>
would go to A Shark Tale or something.  They asked  about The Grudge, then.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty and I turned and looked at each other with such big eyes we didn&#39;t  <br/>
really hear what they bought after all, but they did to in, with this little  <br/>
girl, whom I hope was going to have a nice nap in dad&#39;s lap in a dark  place.<br/>
 <br/>
Though I didn&#39;t mind my kids watching R rated stuff, I would never ever  have <br/>
taken them to a theater where they couldn&#39;t escape it.  Watching a few  <br/>
minutes of something in one&#39;s own home is NOT like stuck in the dark with  speakers <br/>
all around you and overwhelming giant images in the company of  frightened <br/>
adults.<br/>
 <br/>
And so, kind of, with Halo II.  They&#39;re just at home, not on some  foreign <br/>
battle field.  No one is shooting at them.  Any second that  they&#39;d rather be <br/>
doing something else, they can switch the whole shebang off and  play it later <br/>
or never again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of when my dh and I went to see Halloween III, since the<br/>
first Halloween is still the scariest movie in my mind and memory, and when<br/>
the third one came out in my mid 30&#39;s with Jamie Lee to boot, I was so<br/>
excited to see it. A family sat in front of us in the theatre, a young man<br/>
and woman and a 2 1/2, maybe 3 yo boy. It completely spoiled the movie for<br/>
us because the child was so incredibly freaked out and the parents laughed.<br/>
I told them their child was really struggling, and I thought he needed to<br/>
get some relief and would they please take him out. They told me to mind my<br/>
own business.  What to do in a situation like that? I asked the management<br/>
about it and they said parents can do whatever they want, even if the child<br/>
is that young and in distress. It was SO PAINFUL!<br/>
<br/>

smart-aleck films that aren&#39;t supposed to be that scary, but they&#39;re<br/>
actually cool and original and the Japanese thoughts are just amazing.<br/>
However, when we Americans like a film by the Japanese we make an American<br/>
version such as &quot;The Ring&quot; (&quot;Ringu&quot;) and now this film. The Ring might be<br/>
one of the worst films ever made. Sure it&#39;s got some jumpy parts in there,<br/>

ideas.&quot;<br/>

My filmmaker in the making. He recommends &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; for true<br/>
fear-provoking, as well as &quot;The Shining&quot;. We are really interested in other<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Andrew says, &quot;When the music starts, that&#39;s usually the director&#39;s way to<br/>
trick you to get scared and get your belly to feel all nauseous. The part<br/>
that is REALLY scary just happens out of the blue. The music is all quiet<br/>
and then BAM a scary face appears in some window. They usually use the<br/>
uplifting, frightening orchestra music for when someone is going down a dark<br/>
hall, or a dark room. They use it because the person has not yet gone in<br/>
this room, and we don&#39;t know who or what is lurking about, but nothing<br/>
usually happens. My theory is usually 100% right. I have a theory that about<br/>
55% of the people get scared at the part of the movie that is not only a<br/>
scary image but because of the crash of a frightening orchestra sound.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So are ya scared now? At least now you know you don&#39;t have to be afraid of<br/>
the scary music!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525601645">One that really gave me the creeps was another Japanese movie titled &quot;The <br/>
Audition&quot;.  &quot;The Eye&quot; (Chinese, Mandarin) gave me a few chills.  I enjoyed <br/>
&quot;The Others&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.  We just saw &quot;The Village&quot; and <br/>
it wasn&#39;t the best of Shyamalan&#39;s movies but enjoyable.  &quot;The Forgotten&quot; is <br/>
our most recent views, worth watching but disappointing.<br/>
<br/>
I still think the older horror movies are some of the most scary, so much <br/>
was left to our imaginations.  I remember watching a live performance of <br/>
&quot;Dracula&quot; at a small theatre in the round.  There were no props, the stage <br/>
was painted black and bare except for a small black box and a black ladder. <br/>
The actors were in costume but the rest was left up to the audience&#39;s <br/>
ability to bring up images from their own imagination and memory.  I got so <br/>
scared that it shocked me, my own brain was filled with much scarier stuff <br/>
than any movie I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
Older films &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; (cheesy but still scary), <br/>
&quot;Psycho&quot; (of course) and &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;The Shining&quot;, I read the book long before the movie came out, the <br/>
book was WAY scarier.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Scary movies, scary books---it doesn&#39;t matter. I have no problem with the supernatural scary. Thinking, jealous cars...Jason...Freddy Krueger...aliens...thinking hotels.... That&#39;s just fun. Silly. ---but not scary.<br/>
<br/>
But psychotics?????<br/>
<br/>
Get me out of there!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t handle _Silence of the Lambs_ or _Misery_ or Gerald&#39;s Game_---or anything that could actually happen because someone is crazed or psychotic or just plain MEAN. OH! That one with the guy and an apartment and a nail gun???? YUCK! <br/>
<br/>
My father, a psychiatrist, did a bit of forensic psychiatry for a while. Got to meet some *real* winners! Pee Wee Gaskins (eventually zapped in the electric chair) wrote a book. I wouldn&#39;t advise that you read *that* one unless you want to be convinced to never leave your LOCKED house without an armed guard (and never let your kids out of your sight!)---and be convinced that the death penalty is a definite necessity!<br/>
<br/>
Supernatural scary? Fun. REAL scary? Forget it!<br/>
