<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047339925">I have been thinking a lot about the example Sandra gave a while back<br/>
to a mom whose kid was hiding behind the door, waiting to scare the<br/>
younger brother--the suggestion was, what if the mom were to say, loud<br/>
enough for everyone to hear, &quot;your brother is behind the door, act<br/>
scared.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This is so easy a solution, one little sentence that makes the whole<br/>
thing a non-problem, and rather, turns it into a game that connects<br/>
all the participants. I have been thinking and thinking about where<br/>
that response could come from in me--who would I have to be to have<br/>
that response.  I&#39;ve been facing how the current me would be a lot<br/>
more likely (at least until I read that post) to have some half-formed<br/>
thought in my head that the scaring kid should not be acting that way,<br/>
and then thinking I had to do something to make the scaring kid see<br/>
the wrong of it, so he would not do it again. <br/>
<br/>
So, I started thinking, (and this is just what I imagine I would be<br/>
doing if I had said that, not trying to analyze what Sandra may have<br/>
been thinking at that moment) that maybe that easy, fun response was<br/>
about making that one moment a good one.  It wasn&#39;t in the future<br/>
about keeping the kid from scaring again.  It wasn&#39;t coming from a<br/>
picture of how the kid ought to be different than he was at that<br/>
moment.  It was just about making that one moment more fun and safe<br/>
for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
How much easier to just tryto make one moment more fun and safe,<br/>
rather than trying to manage all these future (imagined) moments by<br/>
trying to get the kids to change into (my idea of) fun & safe people.<br/>
 That makes *me* NOT fun, and NOT (emotionally) safe for my kids.  Ha!<br/>
 Turns the whole thing on its head.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also struck by how just a little comment like that, relaying the<br/>
idea of saying, &quot;you&#39;re brother is behind the door, act scared,&quot; has<br/>
set off such a chain of thinking and changing in me.  Sometimes it is<br/>
the tiniest thing that is able to get through the years of<br/>
enculturated prejudice against children.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to write this to thank Sandra and other poster who share the<br/>
small moments of their lives here.  Also, I&#39;d welcome any further<br/>
thoughts on this if I am out in left field somewhere.<br/>

Aha!  I do all that &quot;futurizing&quot; too.  And I think this is such a <br/>
great way to look at it.<br/>

Thank you, Maya, for writing all of that.  I want to save it here for the future, but it&#39;s not there <br/>
yet.  The whole post was quietly inspiring.  You said it as well as I&#39;ve ever seen it, and I hope <br/>
lots of people read it for years to come.<br/>
