Several new members latey have stated that they want to learn a bit more about unschooling to see if it’s for them.<br/>
<br/>
While you’re welcome to stay and read, this was never intended to be a beginning intro to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Yahoogroups isn’t as easy to get around in as it once was, so I will cut and paste the group description there, and some links below that will be helpful!<br/>
<br/>
NEW MEMBERS: Read at the Group Website link below before posting.<br/>
<br/>
How and why does unschooling work? What kind of parents and parenting<br/>
does it take? What will help, and what will hinder?<br/>
<br/>
This is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling<br/>
and attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based<br/>
on the principles underlying unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Always Learning will focus on how people learn no matter<br/>
where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any<br/>
particular country or jurisdiction.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way. New members&#39; posts are moderated, and it&#39;s good to read several dozen posts before jumping in.) <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve never read any John Holt, his thoughts and writing are behind unschooling. There is a link on that page, too. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can honestly say that I&#39;ve grown more as a person, parent and unschooler due to the discussions on this list than on any other list I&#39;ve been on.” <br/>

If you’re considering unschooling ideas from a very basic point of view, these two pages will help.<br/>
Look into, look at, the information iinked from Pam Laricchia and Amy Childs, there, too.  Very helpful for new unschoolers.<br/>

I wrote that, and it’s true, but the group we sent beginners to closed down a year or two ago. :-)<br/>
The information for beginners, though, is at the links I sent.  Pam Laricchia’s intro is really excellent.  There are pages on my site, and Joyce’s, that are good and have been for a long time. :-)  From last year, Amy Child’s has a large set of short podcasts that are fun and painless and inspiring.  There are four or five not as great as the rest, and then some that are so sparkly you’ll rise up as if by magic from the uplift! :-)  I’m almost serious.  <br/>
<br/>
For those who have heard all of Amy’s podcasts, which are your favorites?  If you can respond with a link straight to that favorite (or several) that would be really great.<br/>
Or if you have a favorite of my pages or Joyce’s or Pam Sorooshian’s or Pam Laricchia’s with introductory ideas for new unschoolers, please link those, if you have one, if you’re in the mood to share.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
