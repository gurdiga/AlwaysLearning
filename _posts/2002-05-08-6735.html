<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900039120"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;So that might be a fun topic here, too: how far would YOU go to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschool? Is there anywhere you&#39;d draw the line and just say, &quot;Okay, I give, <br/>
it&#39;s not worth THAT&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are already some really big choices that we have made in our family so <br/>
that I can stay home with the kids. We moved across the country to a more <br/>
affordable area, for one thing. We&#39;re about to move again because Utah is so <br/>
intolerable as a place for my soon to be teenage kids to socialize in.<br/>
<br/>
I plan on going underground in Oregon so that my kids don&#39;t have to test. <br/>
We&#39;re also going to get a smaller house and start a business to further the <br/>
whole familiy&#39;s unschooling adventures. (It&#39;ll be a real adventure if the <br/>
business goes under, huh?!)<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to help them complete a test, but I&#39;d first go to great <br/>
lengths to make sure they weren&#39;t required to.<br/>
<br/>
I made my former sil (my brother&#39;s ex-wife) the named guardian for my kids <br/>
in my will even though she&#39;s no longer &quot;family&quot;. She&#39;s my best friend and <br/>
she&#39;ll raise my kids the way I have been. There was no better choice IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
So, I haven&#39;t yet met the obstacle that will force me to go backwards in <br/>
this decision to keep my family together and happy.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
