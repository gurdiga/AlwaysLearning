<div id="ygrps-yiv-269713611">To all of you in the group:<br/>
 Thank you for all of the advice you&#39;ve already given, and for the <br/>
help you are about to give in this letter endeavor. Here is the draft <br/>
of the letter to my mother. Feel FREE to change or add to this letter <br/>
to make it not feel threatening to her. FYI: Mamaw was my mother&#39;s <br/>
mother who just died in April and was EVIL!! My mother hated her yet <br/>
took care of her for about 15 years after several strokes and the <br/>
last 2 years she was completely bedridden yet my mother wouldn&#39;t put <br/>
her in a nursing home out of &#39;obligation&#39;. No one liked her. Also, <br/>
April, Tyler and Nora are the names of my grown children.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mom:<br/>
<br/>
	I love you. I want to be there for you when you need <br/>
something and to have a good relationship with you.<br/>
	However, I won&#39;t keep listening to the insults or bringing <br/>
Lacey over to be insulted. I want you to be a good grandmother to <br/>
her. The kind of grandmother you used to be when April was small. Not <br/>
the kind of Mamaw that I had  the one that hurt with her words and <br/>
always put me down for not living up to her unrealistic expectations <br/>
of me. <br/>
	Others feel the same way, but they are afraid to confront <br/>
you. Because of their fear they are willing to keep putting up with <br/>
the verbal and emotional abuse to them and their children out of a <br/>
sense of obligation to you. I do feel an obligation to you because I <br/>
want to help you. I have been there for you when your other children <br/>
left you. I want to continue to be in your life, but I have an <br/>
obligation to Lacey to keep her from being abused. You are crushing <br/>
her spirit as Mamaw crushed mine. Your abuse is much the same as <br/>
Mamaw&#39;s was and I am hoping that you can look within yourself and see <br/>
this and perhaps make an effort to change. For all of your family <br/>
that are still in your life.<br/>
       April, Tyler and Nora are grown and can make their own <br/>
decisions. If you want them to visit, try calling them and asking <br/>
them to come see you. That usually works. They don&#39;t think that you <br/>
want them to come over because of the way you&#39;ve talked to them and <br/>
about them in the past. I&#39;m no longer going to be the go-between with <br/>
you and them. If you want to be a grandmother to them and a great-<br/>
grandmother to their children, then you have to make an effort. <br/>
There is no longer the excuse of having to take care of Mamaw for not <br/>
going by to see your grandkids or me. You don&#39;t need an invitation to <br/>
come to my house or to go see them. How many times have you passed <br/>
right by my house and not stopped to see me? Yet you complain when we <br/>
don&#39;t come to see you. You think we are mad at you when we don&#39;t call <br/>
you or come visit you, yet you don&#39;t make any effort to call or come <br/>
see us.<br/>
(I don&#39;t know how to end this!!  Something to the effect of `The next <br/>
move is yours&#39;???)<br/>

You have a sanctuary right now. Keep it!<br/>
<br/>
If you would like her to come by, let her know she can call and ask  <br/>
if it&#39;s convenient.<br/>
<br/>
Though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea. At her house you can get up  <br/>
and leave if she&#39;s misbehaving. It will be harder for you to get her  <br/>
out of your house if she&#39;s acting up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066685982">-=-Dear Mom:<br/>
<br/>
I love you. I want to be there for you when you need<br/>
something and to have a good relationship with you.<br/>
However, I-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the beginning.  She&#39;s been manipulating and abusing, and if you start with &quot;I <br/>
am willing to continue to be manipulated and abused, but...&quot; she will only need to read the <br/>
first part to decide to continue as-is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too long.<br/>
You talk about how you wish she was, and why you think she is, and how you&#39;d like things <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all too much.<br/>
<br/>
Write it like you&#39;re paying 45 cents a word for a newspaper ad.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t even put &quot;Dear Mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a counter-suggestion:<br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
I&#39;ve decided not to subject Lacey to abuse anymore.  If you need anything I&#39;ll try to get by <br/>
there when I can, but I won&#39;t be bringing Lacey.<br/>
<br/>
You mother was abusive, you&#39;re being abusive, and I&#39;ve had enough abuse for this lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Belinda<br/>
********<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(It&#39;s understood that the next move is hers; you don&#39;t need to say so.)<br/>
<br/>
If she responds badly, here&#39;s letter two:<br/>
=================<br/>
If a stranger treated Lacey as you treat her, I would call the police.  You don&#39;t get to do <br/>
that anymore.  You never should have done it in the first place.<br/>
=================<br/>
<br/>
If the religions aspect is important to you, you could add (the second time, not the first <br/>
one) &quot;I have an obligation to make Lacey&#39;s life safe and peaceful, to protect her from harm.  <br/>
Jesus wouldn&#39;t want you acting the way you act.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think simple and direct is better than drawn out and whiney.  What you wrote is an <br/>
attempt to make your mom feel guilty and to change according to your specifications.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223998831">Hi Belinda,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that I agree with Sandra&#39;s suggestions.  I also<br/>
think you&#39;ve put too much emotion into it.  I do understand that these<br/>
these can be emotional for you, but you do not need to share that with<br/>
her.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m copying and pasting a letter I had written my dad some time ago. <br/>
I think I mentioned it before.  Basically in the letter I let him know<br/>
what I would not be tolerating anymore.  He (as a former wrestling<br/>
coach) went WAY overboard when my son started getting into wrestling. <br/>
<br/>
It might be a bit lengthy, but I will say that it did work.  I never<br/>
heard a word from him about it.  It just changed.  Maybe a similar<br/>
format would help you out.  The letter isn&#39;t nice.  but the way he<br/>
acted that day made me feel not so nice.  If someone doesn&#39;t act<br/>
deserving of respect, then I see no need to give it to them.  your<br/>
mother is not a child, she doesn&#39;t need lengthy explanations of why<br/>
she is mean, or why no one visits.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  here&#39;s my letter.  I hope it helps you and if it doesn&#39;t...<br/>
 then I hope it helps someone else.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
-Heather<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Dad,<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a few things I wanted to get off my chest about the wrestling<br/>
tournament.  First of all, please do not tell me that I &quot;need to<br/>
chill&quot; or that I&#39;m &quot;too protective&quot; with S.  You already had your<br/>
chance to raise children, now it&#39;s my turn.  You can either be<br/>
supportive, or be somewhere else.  I raise S. with respect, meaning I<br/>
respect him, his feelings, and the things he says.  Period.  If you<br/>
think that&#39;s babying him, or being too protective, first, I don&#39;t<br/>
care, second, please reread the second and third sentences of this<br/>
paragraph.  I find it insulting when you speak to me that way, and I<br/>
do not appreciate it.  I was not in a bad mood today until I started<br/>
to disapprove of the way you treated S.  <br/>
<br/>
Second, I wouldn&#39;t let anyone speak to my any of my kids the way you<br/>
speak to him.  And I refuse to sit back while you do it.  If he&#39;s<br/>
feeling bad about something, picking on him or making fun of him or<br/>
using sarcasm to gain a reaction makes him feel worse and is very<br/>
immature.  You are his grandfather, not his father, and you should be<br/>
there with positive support and that&#39;s all.  Acting like a jerk only<br/>
succeeds in making you look like a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
Third, if you continue to think its ok to yell at S. (or M. for that<br/>
matter) than you can find another car to drive or ride in.  It&#39;s not<br/>
aloud, and I won&#39;t let you do it.  S. is 9.  He acts 9.  I allow him<br/>
to act 9.  There is no need for you to be so bossy (this bothers him<br/>
the most), inflexible, and loud.  It affects everyone.  If you can&#39;t<br/>
stand to be in a car with children, then get out of the car.  Problem<br/>
solved.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550277061">I agree wholeheartedly with all of Sandra&#39;s suggestions, too.   I <br/>
think that your first draft was probably important and good for you <br/>
to write for *your* own sake, just to get those thoughts out of your <br/>
head and onto a piece of paper (or a computer screen).   I find it <br/>
cathartic to write a lengthy diatribe about issues I&#39;m having ~ for <br/>
my eyes only in most cases, and that&#39;s probably what that first draft <br/>
did.  (To that end, I keep a blog that&#39;s for my eyes only where I can <br/>
go on at length about the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I use it <br/>
because my typing is far better and more legible than my handwriting.)<br/>
<br/>
I applaud you for writing your letter and posting it here.  Sandra&#39;s <br/>
concise version is excellent communication for communication&#39;s sake <br/>
and gives your mom very little on which to argue.<br/>
<br/>
I applaud you for taking this important step and speaking your truth; <br/>
it&#39;s a very powerful thing to do!<br/>

I think it&#39;s important that you keep this about you and your family--not other people.  They <br/>
have their own relationships and challenges, and it&#39;s not right for you to &quot;out&quot; them if they <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546552282">oh what I wrote doesnt seem at all in connection to Jennys...<br/>
yet I am thinking, the words are heavy and blaming as jenny points out. <br/>
<br/>
If you can limit to describing exactly what she does, (you say x) then<br/>
describing your feelings here (I am worried for my daughter when she<br/>
hears such words coming from her grandmother, for ex.)...<br/>
I am afraid she is hurting as much as I would from words of that<br/>
sort...(maybe remembering how you felt whenyour grandmother spoke in<br/>
the same way?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158062990">It would seem sensible that an abuser needs to know information about which<br/>
behavior is abusive.  They already know.  Even if they don&#39;t want to admit<br/>
it to themselves or anyone else.  The reason telling exactly which behavior<br/>
is abusive doesn&#39;t work is that the response back is a degenerative mess of<br/>
excuses and muddy thinking which in turn served to muddy my own thinking.<br/>
It&#39;s like handing an abuser ammunition to sling back at you in the same<br/>
manner they always give abuse... because it&#39;s how they relate to you.<br/>
<br/>
I was only able to make a successful break by simply saying in essence<br/>
&quot;goodbye&quot; and going on with my life mentally and emotionally as though we<br/>
weren&#39;t related.  They eventually found their way back to me in a way that I<br/>

Well, I sent the letter. She didn&#39;t respond very well. She called me and my 19 <br/>
yo daughter, Nora, and told us both to &quot;Just keep the f*** away from me&quot;. The <br/>
timing was good though, because my 16 yo niece had told her yesterday that she <br/>
no longer wants to spend the night with her because of the way that my mother <br/>
treats her and talks about her all the time and that she can&#39;t do anything <br/>
right according to my mother! Also, my 19 yo daughter told my mother while she <br/>
was there today (before Mom read the letter) that my 8 yo wasn&#39;t eating <br/>
because of the way that Mom talks about her weight. My daughter&#39;s sister-in-<br/>
law went with her today and her statement when they got back here was &quot;If it <br/>

No, that&#39;s PERFECT!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now you don&#39;t have to worry about helping her or seeing her anymore.   <br/>
You might be able to shake that Bible-induced guilt about honoring  <br/>
your mother.<br/>
<br/>
It was her move, and she chose (of all the hundreds of thousands of  <br/>
things she might have done) to call you without thinking first,  <br/>
without writing, and telling you to keep the fuck away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re free!!!!<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not too late for your mom to read that letter again and  <br/>
reconsider her behavior and attitude.  She&#39;ll also have the memory of  <br/>
her reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Does she drink?  If so, she might not have the memory.<br/>
<br/>
If she does drink and if you don&#39;t start feeling better about this  <br/>
pretty soon, you might want to consider al-Anon or Adult Children of  <br/>
Alcoholics meetings for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161230480">Hi katherine, <br/>
I have not any experience with someone who is so abusive I need them<br/>
out of my life.  I agree with you, that if my goal were to just end<br/>
the relationship, it would be best to just be as quick, simple as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Yet with my own family situation I have found that describing the<br/>
action, without adding the descriptive terms &quot;abuse&quot; is much more<br/>
effective to open the lines for communication.<br/>
<br/>
I am talking about my husband here.  He is a wonderful person, who has<br/>
at times severe back pain, and he can start to... well, verge on<br/>
abusive--using terms and actions he would never dream of using if he<br/>
were not in pain. I ve finally found that by just referring exactly to<br/>
what he has just said or done he stops.  He doesnt want to do it...we<br/>
are all at different levels.  <br/>
<br/>
For us, because I did not consider just severing our relationship an<br/>
option, this method has really helped us...much more than me just<br/>
saying &quot;I will not tolerate any more of this behavior&quot; or &quot;you will<br/>
never menace  a child of mine again&quot;...this just got him angry at me<br/>
and closed down the communication. <br/>
<br/>
that sucked worse than what was happening before.<br/>
<br/>
I also seek integrity in my life:  I strive to be with my children in<br/>
a certain manner--I dont intervene in their fights saying &quot;you are<br/>
egotistical or abusive&quot; or what have you. I say what I see.<br/>
<br/>
It really works with them as well.<br/>
<br/>
that is why I suggested to use the descriptive facts here in this<br/>
situation of belinda&#39;s--it seemed to me that she would prefer her<br/>
mother got the point rather than just cutting her out of her life.<br/>
<br/>
In my life experience, ive found that my viewpoint gets taken better I<br/>
find if I dont blame the other person.<br/>
<br/>
in regards to degenerating, belinda is using a letter so she is safer<br/>
i guess than you were doing it in person.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s different if it&#39;s in the house or if it&#39;s a spouse.<br/>
<br/>
If the grandmother living with a family is abusive, there would be  <br/>
other ways to handle it than a letter saying &quot;if you don&#39;t change  <br/>
you&#39;ll never see my kids again.&quot;    But I would tell my kids, if they  <br/>
were young and a grandparent was being verbally harsh in my house, to  <br/>
come and tell me, and I would go in and talk to my  mom (or my  <br/>
husband&#39;s mom) every time, if it happened (that&#39;s hypothetical; my  <br/>
mom lived with us when Kirby was little, but Kirby doesn&#39;t remember).<br/>
<br/>
I think letters are better than confrontations for lots of reasons.   <br/>
Letters can&#39;t be interrupted.  They can be re-read.  The sender can  <br/>
keep a copy (Belinda, I hope you kept a copy!!), so if other  <br/>
relatives have come to believe the letter said something other than  <br/>
what it said, they can be shown or given a copy.  That way things  <br/>
don&#39;t escalate, they&#39;re brought back to the simple center.  If the  <br/>
recipient lies about what&#39;s in the letter, the recipient gets  <br/>
busted.  And the sender can think carefully (and get advice), and  <br/>
choose words deliberately and slowly, unlike in person, when the  <br/>
other one will interrupt after five words anyway and it will turn to  <br/>
a heated argument instead of a statement of position.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116454892"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You&#39;re free!!!! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s not too late for your mom to read that letter again and <br/>
reconsider her behavior and attitude. She&#39;ll also have the memory of <br/>
her reaction.<br/>
Does she drink? If so, she might not have the memory.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I was lucky on that part. Neither of my parents EVER drank. I&#39;m so <br/>
grateful for that at least. My step-brothers weren&#39;t so lucky. They got the <br/>
alcoholism gene from both of their parents, and now two of them are dead <br/>
because of it.<br/>
Hopefully my Mom will turn around, but I&#39;m not pinning any hopes on that. This <br/>
has been her nature for quite a while now. I am hoping though that she&#39;ll talk <br/>
about this with others (as I&#39;m SURE she WILL!) and that THEY in turn will talk <br/>
to her and let her know that I was right about her behavior and that they too <br/>
can see this in her. THEN maybe she&#39;ll see that she needs to change. We shall <br/>
see.<br/>
