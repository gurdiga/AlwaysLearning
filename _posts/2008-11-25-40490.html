<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140363671">I have permission to share this on the list.  I have some ideas but  <br/>
I&#39;ll let others go first.   I&#39;m getting behind on dishes and laundry  <br/>
and all, and didn&#39;t want this to wait.  It&#39;s a quote from here down:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have a cat, some fish and a hamster.  My 5yo son likes to eat  <br/>
their food.  His interest started with cat treats about five months  <br/>
ago.  I let him have a few, thinking he&#39;d eat one or two and let it  <br/>
go, but he kept asking for them.  I would give them to him, but my  <br/>
husband felt very uncomfortable after researching the ingredients in  <br/>
the treats we had.  So we told my son that the treats were made for  <br/>
cats, and might make a person sick to eat too many, and stopped  <br/>
letting him have them.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after that he wanted to sample the fish food, and again I gave  <br/>
it to him once or twice before becoming uncomfortable with it, and  <br/>
told him again that it was made for fish, not for people.<br/>
<br/>
Then he started eating the cat food, and the ingredients in it didn&#39;t  <br/>
worry us as much as the treats or the fish food, so we&#39;d give it to  <br/>
him when he asked.  Then he asked in front of our babysitter, and I  <br/>
was embarrassed.  I gave it to him, but later told him that people  <br/>
think it&#39;s gross and he should only have it when we don&#39;t have  <br/>
visitors.  I was hoping his want for cat food would go away, and it&#39;s  <br/>
decreased, but he still likes to eat it.  He&#39;ll walk by the cat dish  <br/>
and munch on a few every now and then.  I&#39;d like for him not to eat  <br/>
pet food.  But I don&#39;t want to create a situation where he&#39;s sneaking  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
And now he wants to eat our hamster food, which is seeds and grains  <br/>
and nuts.  It kind of grosses me out, and my husband is very  <br/>
uncomfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do ... I&#39;ve bought him seeds and nuts from the  <br/>
grocery store, but he doesn&#39;t like those the same way he likes the  <br/>
hamster food.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love suggestions - this is one of those things where I don&#39;t  <br/>
honestly think our cat or hamster food would be harmful for him, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not socially accepted to eat pet food.  My in-laws in particular  <br/>
would be mortified if they knew we had allowed this.  And even if I  <br/>
said no if he asked for it while they were here, the question in and  <br/>
of itself would indicate that we have allowed it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;d like to add to the thank you&#39;s you&#39;ve gotten around the  <br/>
seventh anniversary of this list.  I love this list, and am grateful  <br/>
that you maintain it and post so much.  I really hope to meet you in  <br/>
person someday.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002424771">We have a hamster. The book we bought at the same time said that &quot;if we can <br/>
eat it, hamsters can eat it&quot;. With the exception of the timothy hay, which <br/>
would be plain ruffage/fiber and probably go straight through, most of the <br/>
stuff in our hamsters feed is the same nuts, grains and seeds that you see <br/>
in a trail mix - some of it pelletised. However it&#39;s probably slightly lower <br/>
grades of nuts, grains and seeds, unless you are buying organically grown. <br/>
You could make up a trail mix from raw ingredients, and btw it would be fine <br/>
for the hammy.<br/>
<br/>
I would have this advice about the snacks. First, give him his own snack <br/>
bowl at his eye level so that he doesn&#39;t have to go into the pets&#39; bowls - <br/>
that could be be unhygenic especially if you hammy is anything like our <br/>
Shimmer. Also read the ingredients and check the country of origin. TBH I <br/>
would be far more worried about food with ingredients from China after all <br/>
this recent business with Melamine, than the ingredients themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing about a food scientist asked what single food he would <br/>
&quot;take on a desert island&quot; to survive and be healthy and he said canned cat <br/>
food, because it contained all the proteins, fats, carbs and vitamins that <br/>
are needed. I&#39;ll have to search out the reference. I think it was a radio <br/>
program. In the live action Scooby Doo movie, there is a girl eating Scooby <br/>
Snacks - all vegetarian.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My initial reaction is that perhaps he needs some of the vitamins in<br/>
those foods.  Pet food, in many ways, is like eating a multi-vitamin. <br/>
Perhaps if your son regularly ate a multi-vitamin, the pet would would<br/>
be less appealing.  That and more protein.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787901164">I liked the suggestion that vitamins might help.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the food would hurt him a bit, and he&#39;s only five.<br/>
<br/>
When I was that age I watched The Prince and the Pauper on tv, an old  <br/>
Disney version.   There was a food taster in the story. I used to  <br/>
feed our dogs, and they were in a pen in the yard.  I walked down a  <br/>
trail and over a little bridge over a ditch (probably a single step  <br/>
for adults, but a little bridge for me.  I would stop ceremoniously  <br/>
on the bridge and taste the dry dog food.  One taste, to make sure it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t poisoned.  Day after day I saved my dogs&#39; lives that way.   <br/>
Cool, huh?  I felt good about it.<br/>
<br/>
Friends and I used to taste and like some cat food that had pieces  <br/>
shaped like a little milk bottle and a fish and a piece of cheese.<br/>
<br/>
At my granny&#39;s  house they had chickens, and I watched the chickens  <br/>
and saw them eating  little rocks--fat grains of sand, really, about  <br/>
the same size as their feed.  I got scared and told her they were out  <br/>
of food and they were eating rocks and would get sick.  She told me  <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t get sick, that birds digest their food partly by it  <br/>
being in their gullet with a few little rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Two or three different times, after that, I ate a few little rocks,  <br/>
in her driveway.  I remember one day my cousin Nada and I were  <br/>
sitting in the shade of the house, in the dirt driveway, playing with  <br/>
baby horned toads and I was eating little rocks.  Nada passed on the  <br/>
rocks.   (I talked to Nada on the phone just this afternoon.)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get sick.  Looking back, I kinda wish maybe I had washed  <br/>
them, or at least washed my horn-toad hands.<br/>
<br/>
My uncle Joe Paul worked in a dog food canning place in Fort Worth  <br/>
for a while, in the 50&#39;s or 60s, and he said he wouldn&#39;t hesitate to  <br/>
eat that food--that the place was absolutely sanitary, and the  <br/>
workers were wearing gloves and shoe covers and the floor was really  <br/>
clean and people had caps on their hair.  He said he had never seen  <br/>
human food prepared in such a sanitary way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any ways in which it would be dangerous.  I think if  <br/>
you resist or criticize it will last longer and hurt more than if you  <br/>
go with it.  Maybe make some dog food or cat food yourselves so you  <br/>
know what&#39;s in it.  See what they like.  The idea for making your own  <br/>
hamster food was great, but you could to it for dogs and cats too.<br/>

edible manner!  That should read &quot;pet food&quot; not just &quot;pet&quot;!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126660028">My little brother used to sit by the cat food bowl and dunk pieces in<br/>
water the way kids dunk cookies in milk. (of course, he also used to<br/>
eat ants off the ground.) And, when I fell deeply in love with my dog,<br/>
I developed a curiosity about what I was feeding him. I taste tested<br/>
dog biscuits, dog food, and even bones on occasion in my late teens.<br/>
But, what this really brings to mind is that guy on the show Greatest<br/>
American Hero - he ate dog biscuits LOL I haven&#39;t thought about that<br/>
show in ages.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, someone mentioned that perhaps your son eats the pet food<br/>
because he is in need of some other vitamin or something. I know this<br/>
isn&#39;t about humans but here goes... My dog was eating cat poo. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t understand why, that&#39;s disgusting. But, eventually, I<br/>
realized he was eating it because he wanted the cat food. So, I began<br/>
feeding him a bit of fish in his normal meal and he stopped going<br/>
after the cat poo. He just wanted fish.... which isn&#39;t normally<br/>
included in dog food.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559708861">my brother used to eat pet food. dog food, cat food. (dry)<br/>
when he was really small, he was just always getting into it. When he  <br/>
was a bit older (6-8?) he used to do it mostly to gross out the  <br/>
babysitters. sometimes he&#39;d make a cat-food and peanut butter  <br/>
sandwich and eat it.<br/>
<br/>
you know that movie, Fried Green Tomatoes? (book, too, I guess) well,  <br/>
one of the young boy characters gets into an accident and loses his  <br/>
hand. his aunt immediately starts calling him Stump, saying that  <br/>
everyone is going to, so she might as well have him own it, or  <br/>
something like that. And the kid was fine, it became his badge of honor.<br/>
<br/>
If my kid was eating pet food, wouldnt it be really cool if we just  <br/>
totally owned it? If we just totally accepted it and if someone said  <br/>
something negative, we&#39;d have some funny thing handy to say-call it  <br/>
scooby snacks or say we were worried about the sheen on his coat,  <br/>
something to divert the negative feeling and get the conversation  <br/>
moving elsewhere. Even if you dont feel super confident about it,  <br/>
fake it till you make it, thats what I&#39;d try to do.<br/>
<br/>
we also have a picture of my brother sitting at the petting zoo next  <br/>
to a donkey, eating the food, its so cute!<br/>

I have several recipes for dog biscuits/cookies, at least you&#39;d know what&#39;s in them... and I even made a cute little dog shaped cookie cutter out of a tuna can.. my kids used to love making them for our dogs when they were younger.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384805491">Zac was eating salt from the salt shaker - he&#39;d pour himself a tiny bowl of it and just walk around eating it.  We decided he was probably missing some elemental mineral and was trying to meet his body&#39;s needs.  Anyway, we switched to a sea salt that is mined from the ground - an ancient sea bed salt with something like 50 various minerals in it.  He continued to eat the salt for a while and now he does not.  Though periodically he will salt his food a lot - <br/>
<br/>
He tasted dog food once and said it was very salty so maybe your son is missing some type of mineral / salt ???<br/>
<br/>
So sea salt might help.<br/>
<br/>
Also - is there a way he could pick out the ingredients to make his own hamster food - edible for himself and little hammy?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is a fascination with the animals and their foods - maybe a delve into the types of foods various animals eat, rent some films, make a trip to the zoo during feeding time, take a trip to a pet store and browse the aisles and look at various foods available, feed the geese at the lake, etc.<br/>

Maybe you could find people food to make something like pet food  <br/>
with.  Little crackers (oyster crackers, cheese crackers like  <br/>
Goldfish, people have mentioned trail mix...  Chex Mix, maybe (for  <br/>
those who live where Wheat Chex are and know what I&#39;m talking  <br/>
about).   Mixed nuts.  It&#39;s nearly Christmas; &#39;tis the mixed-nuts  <br/>

Or make &quot;human food&quot; like sandwiches, pancakes, etc in the shape of animals or bones for him to enjoy.<br/>
