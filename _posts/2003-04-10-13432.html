Cool about the sun shining, but I&#39;m kinda shocked that when they asked for a <br/>
snack you suggested suckers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;snack,&quot; like &quot;dessert,&quot; is too loaded a concept, and when they say <br/>
&quot;snack&quot; they should be offered food, as though they had just asked for <br/>
something to eat.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s being picky, maybe, but I&#39;ve never offered my kids suckers in their <br/>
lives.  Nor have I said &quot;no suckers.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s worth continuing to write and tweak these ideas until whoever&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50822233">I&#39;d not have thought of suckers if someone asked for a snack, either.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that worth pointing out?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people think that when our kids have NO food restrictions  <br/>
that we have no influence over what they eat. Or that we even encourage  <br/>
junky eating. It is like they can&#39;t imagine anything in between feeding  <br/>
junk and feeding healthy.<br/>
<br/>
So - when somebody says their kids asked for a snack and they offered  <br/>
suckers, it kind of feeds into (excuse the expression &lt;G&gt;) that extreme  <br/>
idea that not restricting food means encouraging junky eating. We don&#39;t  <br/>
really do that.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if I think a kid is hungry - they&#39;ve told me or I notice by  <br/>
their behavior - and there is a sucker sitting nearby, I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
suggest it. If they picked it up and started eating it, I would  <br/>
probably say, &quot;Do you want something else to eat?&quot; I MIGHt even point  <br/>
out that eating that sucker probably won&#39;t work to fill their need to  <br/>
eat. No restrictions doesn&#39;t mean &quot;no parenting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is nice that you discovered, Heidi, that when they asked for a snack  <br/>
because they were hungry, that they actually DID want good food even  <br/>
with suckers available. Cool. None of what I said above was intended to  <br/>
detract from that cool thing!!!<br/>

and might even get a bit impatient with trying to get advice or <br/>
information from people who try to &quot;soften&quot; it too much - so that it is <br/>
diluted. I feel that way at times, nowadays - find myself wanting to <br/>
say, &quot;JUST say it - I can take it.&quot; Now, if something somebody says <br/>
make me get that slightly crumply feeling and my little inner voice <br/>
says, &quot;THAT was mean. Ouch. I didn&#39;t deserve that,&quot; then I also get a <br/>
little thrill that I might be just about to learn something important, <br/>
because if something somebody says arouses an emotional defensive <br/>
feeling in me, it almost ALWAYS means they touched something I need to <br/>
look at more. It can be kind of scary. That&#39;s where I agree with people <br/>
who say that posting on the unschooling list can be scary - because I <br/>
agree that sometimes I might find myself thinking and re-examining <br/>
things in my life that are going to cause some upheaval in my family. <br/>
Sometimes I feel for my long-suffering husband - who goes along very <br/>
lovingly with all of the changes - some quite radical - that I&#39;ve <br/>
brought into our lives. They are especially radical for him - he comes <br/>
from an agricultural background - small town in Iran - very <br/>
conservative and traditional.<br/>

that I was not trying to implement stuff I&#39;d only heard or read about -  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; And I did take offense from Sandra&#39;s post.  I don&#39;t deal when with <br/>
criticism when it&#39;s not veiled in niceties.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t being critical, I was making the point that calling things snacks or <br/>
junk is part of the problem, and won&#39;t become part of the solution.   I <br/>
wasn&#39;t trying point and say &quot;YOU.&quot;  And in fact, I said &quot;I&quot; more in what I <br/>
wrote than not.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been talking about this food thing for years.  Treat everything as <br/>
food.  Not &quot;dessert&quot; or &quot;snack&quot; or &quot;breakfast food&quot; but food.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t want to come <br/>
out and say, &quot;girls, from now on you can eat all the junk food you <br/>
want.&quot;  They place such a high value on the &quot;junk.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
The change comes in the mom, to not say no so much, to loosen up and not <br/>
freak out.<br/>
<br/>
On another list someone&#39;s asking how to avoid spanking a kid who has a <br/>
tantrum because the mom won&#39;t buy him something at the store.   I&#39;m not going <br/>
to volunteer any answers.  There are lots of others who will.    But when I <br/>
say I buy my kids all the candy they want, I&#39;m telling the truth.  And <br/>
probably some parents are picturing half a cart of candy, $65.   But WEEKS go <br/>
by where nobody wants any candy whatsoever.   Maybe once every couple of <br/>
months I get cookies.  It takes a few days for them to go.  Last time, a <br/>
week.  More often I make cookies, and they go at a slow and dignified pace, <br/>
not like when I was a kid and people at my house ate everything they could <br/>
shovel in because if they didn&#39;t someone else would.  Unless there were six <br/>
or twelve.  Then the math was obvious.  A dozen donuts, six people, each got <br/>
two.  ONLY two.  Non-transferable donuts.  At our house if a dozen donuts <br/>
come in nobody counts, and two usually petrify in the box.  Nobody knows who <br/>
did or didn&#39;t eat three, or one, or none.  And nobody cares.  Because IF they <br/>
want more, we&#39;ll buy more.   And obviously they&#39;re not desperate for more, as <br/>
the last mummified donuts will attest.<br/>
<br/>
So &quot;All the donuts you want&quot; when I worked at Dunkin Donuts became &quot;one, <br/>
MAYBE&quot; by the third day.  After a week, it was none.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;All the donuts you want&quot; is about the same way at my house now.  Donuts <br/>
come in here three or four times a YEAR.<br/>
<br/>
But if we got donuts once a week and counted them and made kids eat spinach <br/>
to get them, they would be eating two donuts a week and dreaming of the next <br/>
donut eating opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t deal when with <br/>
criticism when it&#39;s not veiled in niceties. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say I don&#39;t veil criticism in niceties, but more to the point, I <br/>
don&#39;t see discussion of terms as criticism.<br/>

&gt;is a &#39;support group&#39; so much as it is a place for a bunch of committed and <br/>

&gt;unschoolingdotcom, right?  There are lot of newbies on that site and you <br/>
&gt;might learn more and faster from the questions they&#39;re asking as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Secondly, now that there are two Heidi&#39;s on this list, could we both use <br/>
&gt;last name initials?  I was amused to find &#39;me&#39; posting when I hadn&#39;t <br/>

&gt;Don&#39;t take offense - it is ALWAYS intended to be useful, NEVER intended <br/>
&gt;to just slap you down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t deal when with<br/>
&gt;&gt;criticism when it&#39;s not veiled in niceties.  It&#39;s one of the things I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt;working on to improve myself, thicker skin.  I admit it and I will try<br/>
&gt;&gt;not to let things get to me in the future.<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re hanging in here!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want to stop posting<br/>
&gt;&gt;and asking for advice.  I need this support group so much.  There is<br/>
&gt;&gt;nobody in my immediate &quot;world&quot; right now who I can discuss these <br/>
&gt;&gt;changes<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;m making.  Well, nobody who would support me anyway.  So I will<br/>
&gt;&gt;repeat...&quot;be zen, do zen, like water off a duck&#39;s back, like water off <br/>
&gt;&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt;duck who is being and doing zen, be the duck, be the water...&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And - sometime you&#39;ll suddenly realize that you APPRECIATE directness <br/>
&gt;and might even get a bit impatient with trying to get advice or <br/>
&gt;information from people who try to &quot;soften&quot; it too much - so that it is <br/>
&gt;diluted. I feel that way at times, nowadays - find myself wanting to <br/>
&gt;say, &quot;JUST say it - I can take it.&quot; Now, if something somebody says <br/>
&gt;make me get that slightly crumply feeling and my little inner voice <br/>
&gt;says, &quot;THAT was mean. Ouch. I didn&#39;t deserve that,&quot; then I also get a <br/>
&gt;little thrill that I might be just about to learn something important, <br/>
&gt;because if something somebody says arouses an emotional defensive <br/>
&gt;feeling in me, it almost ALWAYS means they touched something I need to <br/>
&gt;look at more. It can be kind of scary. That&#39;s where I agree with people <br/>
&gt;who say that posting on the unschooling list can be scary - because I <br/>
&gt;agree that sometimes I might find myself thinking and re-examining <br/>
&gt;things in my life that are going to cause some upheaval in my family. <br/>
&gt;Sometimes I feel for my long-suffering husband - who goes along very <br/>
&gt;lovingly with all of the changes - some quite radical - that I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;brought into our lives. They are especially radical for him - he comes <br/>
&gt;from an agricultural background - small town in Iran - very <br/>
&gt;conservative and traditional.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra,     I grew up on a house of criticism, sometimes veiled, usually <br/>
not, and of conditional love.  Lots of  guilt trips, too.  Long, long <br/>
trips with the silent treatment thrown in.  I have long conversations <br/>
with my sister about how we will NOT do this to our children.  We talk <br/>
and we read and we stop each other whenever one of us slips up.  After <br/>
many years, you just expect discussions to be about blame and criticism <br/>
and you often hear it when it&#39;s not even there.   Thanks for all your <br/>
advice and help.  It really is appreciated.  HeidiC.<br/>

speed through the posts and take whatever catches my eye. This is So<br/>
valuable to me! I am fairly new to unschooling and don&#39;t know any other<br/>
unschoolers so I really look forward to learning new ways of<br/>
thinking/looking/experiencing everyday occurrences. It&#39;s a wonderful<br/>
adventure to me! I actually belong to unschooling.com, too, but I really<br/>
don&#39;t read lately. I feel like this list is much more Calm and Peaceful<br/>
and it seems(to me)that unschooling.com gets bogged down a lot with<br/>
&quot;drama&quot; (for lack of a better word)! I believe someone on here referred<br/>
to it as &quot;unschooling.comedy&quot;. LOL</div>
