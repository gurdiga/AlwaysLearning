<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401135999">I asked Gail if I could share what she sent when they got home.   <br/>
Here&#39;s her response, and the long report is below that.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s okay with me.  I actually considered writing it to the whole  <br/>
list because I&#39;d seen your post about it. We&#39;ve recovered and can now  <br/>
add to our list of experiences that we were in a studio and  <br/>
experienced first hand what it was like.<br/>
<br/>
  Overall, though it was very uncomfortable physically and  <br/>
emotionally for Brenna and I.<br/>
We both knew it could be and I&#39;m proud of us that we did it anyway. I  <br/>
wish it would have been even a little bit positive about unschooling  <br/>
but I don&#39;t think it was.  Mainstream journalism and especially a  <br/>
station like Fox is just not going to present us in a positive  <br/>
light........yet..&lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Sandra,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to put a positive slant to  <br/>
&gt; this....but even after decompressing for several hours am just not  <br/>
&gt; going to be able to do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay.....the limo ride...that was fairly cool...&lt;g&gt;  Nice driver.   <br/>
&gt; End of the positive part.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We got there and were told it would be live.  They showed us where  <br/>
&gt; we would sit, how the microphone would work and the earpieces.  No  <br/>
&gt; one at the studio knew what the story was about or who would be  <br/>
&gt; asking us questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About 5 minutes prior, they sat us in the chairs, put on the wires,  <br/>
&gt; powdered our faces and told us to look at the camera when we  <br/>
&gt; talked.  Brenna was about ready to throw up...and we sat there and  <br/>
&gt; waited and waited and waited.  We could hear Fox News in our  <br/>
&gt; earpieces with stories of the wife shooting the minister husband  <br/>
&gt; with occasionally references that said...&quot;It would be some parent&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; idea of a nightmare if your children could study anything they  <br/>
&gt; wanted to study...stay tuned for our story on unschooling...&quot;  The  <br/>
&gt; lights were blinding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The anchor introduced the story saying &quot;What would kids do if they  <br/>
&gt; had control over what they learned?  It&#39;s a frightening thought for  <br/>
&gt; any parent&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They asked me about unschooling.  I think I made two points just as  <br/>
&gt; Pam had suggested although the feedback from the earpiece made it  <br/>
&gt; very difficult.  I said something like &quot;Unschooling has meant  <br/>
&gt; providing a rich trusting environment where my children could  <br/>
&gt; explore their interests. That was as much time as they gave before  <br/>
&gt; another question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next....&quot;Is it like Montesorri school for teens or does she have  <br/>
&gt; they opportunity to not work at all?&quot;..and they put Brenna&#39;s name  <br/>
&gt; in there quietly but I didn&#39;t hear and responded thinking the  <br/>
&gt; interview would last at least more than 60 seconds.  While I was  <br/>
&gt; answering they were panning to pictures of kids in schools.  I  <br/>
&gt; think I said something fairly articulate but at that point I  <br/>
&gt; realized that it really didn&#39;t matter what I said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then they went to Melissa Walker who said some inane thing about  <br/>
&gt; &quot;What if in exploring your passions your missed out on a class in  <br/>
&gt; history where they were discussing Roe v Wade and that could have  <br/>
&gt; led to an interest in law?&quot;   WHAT????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then a Dean of Admissions from Barnard said something about there  <br/>
&gt; was no way to test the preparedness of an unschooled student and  <br/>
&gt; that students who followed no structured path are at a huge  <br/>
&gt; disadvantage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then there was a breaking news story about 7 people shot in Seattle  <br/>
&gt; and that was the end. No chance for any responses  I&#39;d estimate the  <br/>
&gt; total time on air to be maybe 2 minutes.  It was a 40 minute drive  <br/>
&gt; each way to get there and back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, Brenna didn&#39;t get to say anything and she had these really cool  <br/>
&gt; things to say about her life.. and if she wanted to go to college  <br/>
&gt; or even get into Barnard (although it wasn&#39;t high on her list)   <br/>
&gt; that she had complete confidence that she could do it. We  really  <br/>
&gt; wanted to ask if the Dean had known any unschoolers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So then, we came home...same nice limo driver.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We made about a pact....no more Elle Girl Articles.....no more Fox  <br/>
&gt; TV news interviews....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not an especially positive experience.....but certainly an  <br/>
&gt; experience.  Newt Gingrich had been there the day before and the  <br/>
&gt; studio people said he needed a lot of make up..&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh well....Logan said probably only 5 people were watching on a  <br/>
&gt; Saturday afternoon and maybe no one we knew.  He&#39;s our biggest fan.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Brenna decided she hasn&#39;t had enough stress for one weekend and  is  <br/>
&gt; auditioning for a role in a community theatre production of &quot;A  <br/>
&gt; Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; tomorrow.  She thinks  <br/>
&gt; she can get a part as a courtesan....that might be more fun than  <br/>
&gt; our interview.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello to everyone there..  We could use a game of Encore tonight!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981879989">Oh how disappointing!  That is just the reason that I don&#39;t think I could<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399015404">=-=-=-=-=That is just the reason that I don&#39;t think I could<br/>

media.-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that the limo ride was fun, at least.  Maybe one person will see the final piece and be interested enough to find out what unschooling really is.<br/>
<br/>
Our local newspaper had a request for parents to contact them about myspace and to talk about how they limit their children&#39;s computer use.  I wrote to the reporter and said this:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I am writing as a parent who believes that the risk of my child being harmed by using the Internet is overblown.<br/>
<br/>
Children are far more at risk from sexual predation by people known to the family than by strangers they meet on the Internet.  Even if a predator does manage to contact a child via email or chatting, a lot would have to happen for that contact to lead to a physical meeting.  Limiting children&#39;s use of the Internet is based on fear mongering and gives parents a false sense of security.<br/>
<br/>
I monitor my children&#39;s Internet use by spending time with them while they are on-line.  I encourage them to show me web sites they like to visit and how they use them.  I show them web sites that I think they might enjoy.  We speak about safety issues on an ongoing basis, just as we discuss safety in other areas of our lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reporter wrote back to say that she might like to talk with me some more, but in the end she didn&#39;t and the final article was all negative and about the *risks* of myspace.<br/>
<br/>
=-=-=-=-=Makes you question<br/>
everything else that is on the news though, doesn&#39;t it?-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
That is for sure!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The greatest risk I&#39;ve seen is that now that Holly has learned to use  <br/>
Photoshop, none of Kirby&#39;s friends are safe.  She&#39;s made goofy  <br/>
versions of them and a couple have been posted.  One voluntarily by  <br/>
the subject, as his main photo.  One, as a comment from Kirby to the  <br/>
victim. &lt;g&gt;   She did one the other night that made Roxana Sorooshian  <br/>
look like a zombie owl, but she didn&#39;t save it.  (Roxana, you lucked  <br/>
out!)<br/>
<br/>
I think school is more dangerous than myspace, or of ANYthing on the  <br/>
internet.  The first picture porn and the first word porn I ever saw  <br/>
came from kids at school.  The first time I was physically mistreated  <br/>
was at school.  The first time I came in contact with boys who really  <br/>
scared me, that I couldn&#39;t very easily get away from, was at school.   <br/>
Long bus trips with the band, in Jr. High, where the teachers said to  <br/>
SIT and not get up and be quiet gave the boys opportunities they  <br/>
might not otherwise have had to pressure girls to engage in petting  <br/>
(what it&#39;s called now I don&#39;t know, because the terminology changes  <br/>
among kids, and the snogging/UK or face sucking or getting-to-first- <br/>
base or whatever involves variable and changing terms. &lt;g&gt;  And of  <br/>
course there are the rare stories of teachers, janitors, coaches,  <br/>
older kids, all-out sexually abusing students.  They&#39;re rare.  I  <br/>
wonder if they&#39;re more rare than the internet scare stories?<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it.<br/>

i agree with you totally.  I dont know if any of you use  the internet child <br/>
programs but we have net nanny on ours, it blocks out all the  porn websites <br/>
when you do a search on yahoo or google which i love.  I am  sick of doing a <br/>
search on something and half the sites that you try to view  being porn.  So <br/>
this is great for adults and kids.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s exactly why Brenna found this so disappointing...she watched  <br/>
and watched for the magazine article because she thought some of the cool <br/>
things  she told the reporter about her unschooling life would be in print and  <br/>
might make a difference in another girl&#39;s life. It actually may have but her  <br/>
only quote definitely was not what she was trying to convey.<br/>
 <br/>
The article was such a let down and she was very hesitant to  do the Fox News <br/>
interview. She thought, though, that if she had a chance to  speak that she <br/>
would be heard.<br/>
She spent a lot of energy not only writing down answers to any question  they <br/>
could possibly answer but having them in these sound bites that she could  <br/>
spout in a second.  I could see her deflating when she realized that was  it.  I <br/>
wish it could have been a better experience for her.  She  realizes why other <br/>
people don&#39;t get what she&#39;s doing and she deals with a lot of  unspoken &quot;bad <br/>
vibes&quot;  from some family and friends which she tries to  ignore.<br/>
 <br/>
She can be herself so much easier when she is with other  unschoolers.  I&#39;m <br/>
thankful for those Live and Learn Conferences, Not Back  to School Camp, and <br/>
the friends she has around the country that she keeps in  touch with on the <br/>
internet or through letters.<br/>
She just glows when she is with them or has things to tell me after talking  <br/>
with them.<br/>
 <br/>
She bounced out of here tonight all dressed up going to audition for a  play. <br/>
  She was singing &quot;On My Own&quot; .  I&#39;m keeping my  fingers crossed that it goes <br/>
well.<br/>

Oh yeah.  He hits the google button on our tool bar and  just hits the keys <br/>
and it comes up with all sorts of sites.  He was playing  on Nick Jr well not <br/>
really playing just clicking the mouse and got on the google  page hit the keys <br/>

especially fear-based advice.   You&#39;re welcome on the list, but  <br/>

Three kids, freedom to use phones, no one called 911.  They knew  <br/>
about it and I told them how important it was NOT to call it if there  <br/>
was no emergency. I explained why.  I explained that calling it on  <br/>
purpose without an emergency could be considered a crime.<br/>
<br/>
Setting 911 up to speed-dial is a mistake.  It&#39;s easier to press 911  <br/>
than any speed-dial combo, and then it can&#39;t accidentally be called.<br/>
<br/>
The only stories I know of kids calling 911 where when the parents  <br/>
told them about it without adding the cautions, or when kids were  <br/>
forbidden to use the phone, and sneaked to play with it when parents  <br/>
weren&#39;t there, and 911 was the only  number they knew.<br/>
<br/>
Children WANT information, and they LIKE to know how the world works.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t advice, but it was initiating dialog on internet safety,  <br/>
right?  (It&#39;s possible I&#39;m mixing up two posts, because I really do  <br/>
like to discuss the ideas and not the individual person/family  <br/>
whenever possible.)<br/>
<br/>
A two year old could be awash in porn sites and not know or care.<br/>
<br/>
Internet safety and two year olds just don&#39;t mix, as a topic.<br/>
The internet is no danger to a two year old.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this is great for adults and kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has me scratching my head a bit.<br/>
I use searches like google at least once a day, sometimes many times <br/>
a day, and have for years.  Accidentally turning up porn sites is <br/>
rare in my experience- the last time I can remember it happening was <br/>
a good while ago when I was helping my son view various tattoos and <br/>
piercings.  Even then it wasn&#39;t &quot;half the sites.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I also have had many a toddler bang on my keyboard and not one ever <br/>
came up with porn sites that way.  (For kicks I just went to google <br/>
and hit a few different random letters toddler-style, and all I got <br/>
was &quot;did not match any documents.&quot;)   I&#39;m not saying that it isn&#39;t <br/>
theoretically possible, just that net nanny for a 2yo (or for <br/>
adults) might be overkill.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention unnecessarily limiting.  I&#39;ve never used anything <br/>
like net nanny, but I&#39;ve heard people who have complain that they <br/>
inadvertantly block non-porn sites as well.  I&#39;ve also heard that <br/>
porn sites have gotten around those devices with careful and <br/>
strategic wording (those net nanny things just look for and block <br/>
sites with the most obvious porn-related words, don&#39;t they?) <br/>

<br/>
   Actually, it wasn&#39;t on speed dial...he was about 10 months old and<br/>
grabbed the bedroom phone while I was in the adjacent<br/>
bathroom...occupied...IYKWIM...he was kind of gnawing on the edge of it and<br/>
I guess pressing buttons too...<br/>
<br/>
  I hung up the phone and picked him up to go downstairs when the phone<br/>
rang...it was a dispatcher saying they had received a call from our number<br/>
and then it disconnected.  She wanted to be sure everything was alright.  I<br/>
apologized profusely, and she said &quot;no harm done&quot;...and we moved the phone<br/>
to a higher place so he couldn&#39;t reach it.<br/>
<br/>
  We don&#39;t have 911 here.  I think the Japanese use 119, but we are supposed<br/>
to dial in to the base system and then use a specific emergency number--<br/>
it&#39;s pretty complicated.  Cassidy (5) knows how to do it now, but when we<br/>
first got here, she was only 3 and didn&#39;t know numbers too well.  When<br/>
Andrew was deployed, I worried that something would happen and nobody would<br/>
know for days....<br/>
<br/>
  911 is a good thing, and I felt WAY bad when it seemed like we were<br/>
abusing it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Long ago, pre-unschooling days, we had something called a &quot;tv guardian&quot; on <br/>
our tv.  The idea sounded good, being that it would filter out the curse <br/>
words, and block inappropriate shows, so the kids could watch tv without <br/>
our supervision.<br/>
<br/>
Well, one day after my little ones were watching PBS kiddie shows, they <br/>
came to me and asked why p*ssy and c8ck were bad words.   Apparently poor <br/>
unsuspecting Mr. Rogers had been bleeped while talking to Henrietta, and <br/>
her name had been replaced with Henrietta Kitty-Cat, and then on sesame <br/>
street some unaware rooster puppet had been blocked and replaced with <br/>
&quot;chicken doodle doo&quot; every time he squawked his trademark sound.  That <br/>
stupid thing was actually TEACHING my children words that they would never <br/>
have learned from those shows.  It quickly went into the trash as I learned <br/>
my important lesson, that nothing could take the place of my physically <br/>
being there next to my children.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing happened when CyberSitter was all the rage a few years ago.  DH <br/>
thought it was a great idea, and installed it on all the computers in the <br/>
house.  I think that lasted about oh, 3 days.  Then he uninstalled <br/>
it.  Every time we tried to look up things, or send e-mails, it would <br/>
filter out words almost randomly.  Not even words, but groups of letters <br/>
within words.<br/>
<br/>
TV Guardians and Net Nannies and Cybersitters are not the same as a parent <br/>
sitting with their child while they use the tv and computer, interacting <br/>
with them, talking about what they see and hear.  If your two year old, or <br/>
six year old, or eight year old, or whatever age you don&#39;t feel comfortable <br/>
giving them free range on the internet or the cable channels, needs/wants <br/>
to use the computer or tv, then sit with them and help them to explore in <br/>
safe ways.  Then you know what they are watching, and you are there to <br/>
explain what comes up right at the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145659741">I use pop up blockers and that gets rid of the majority of ads that<br/>
come up when you innocently click on what *you* want only to get a<br/>
gazillion ads popped up behind or floating in front.  Ds has done all<br/>
kinds of things on the computer that haven&#39;t turned up anything I&#39;m<br/>
worried about.  He&#39;s pretty good with the clicker now at 2 1/2.  <br/>
<br/>
Popup blockers, if you don&#39;t know, come with free Yahoo and Google<br/>
toolbars and you can get standalone popup blocker programs if you want<br/>
to spend money for them.  I&#39;m sure there are other free programs out<br/>
there too.  <br/>
<br/>
NetNanny and others are notorious to swamp RAM and slow your computer<br/>
way down.  And like others have said, the protection they offer is<br/>
overkill.    <br/>
<br/>
Besides which... it&#39;s much easier to gradually open the world of<br/>
information to a child bit by bit with *you* --not a program--<br/>
protecting them from MISinformation rather than protect a child for<br/>
years and then spring that child onto the world unaware.  That&#39;s what<br/>
you don&#39;t want.<br/>

She  bounced out of here tonight all dressed up going to audition for a<br/>
play.<br/>
She was singing &quot;On My Own&quot; .  I&#39;m keeping my  fingers  crossed that it goes<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

So, Brenna called from the audition......happily screaming....I&#39;m a<br/>
courtesan!!!   She was cast in Something Funny Happened on the Way to  the<br/>
Forum.  So<br/>

spending MANY hours every day online, that I&#39;ve ever one single time  <br/>
come across a porn website in my searches.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve occasionally had porn spam email - but even THAT stopped a long  <br/>
time ago and I assume that&#39;s my internet provider&#39;s spam protection  <br/>
working.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059806249">Google&#39;s default is to filter out explicit images and not to filter  <br/>
out explicit text.<br/>
<br/>
To change that, you open Google and click on preferences. You can  <br/>
reset it to not filter at all or to filter text and images, both.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - I thought I&#39;d do a little quick comparison - just count news  <br/>
stories about school-related abuse, violence, etc., versus internet- <br/>
related dangers.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not really sure what &quot;internet dangers&quot; people are talking  <br/>
about.<br/>

&gt; I also have had many a toddler bang on my keyboard and not one ever<br/>
&gt; came up with porn sites that way.  (For kicks I just went to google<br/>
&gt; and hit a few different random letters toddler-style, and all I got<br/>
&gt; was &quot;did not match any documents.&quot;)   I&#39;m not saying that it isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; theoretically possible, just that net nanny for a 2yo (or for<br/>
&gt; adults) might be overkill.<br/>
