But since it sent itself to everyone on your address list from your<br/>
computer, you do have a virus.<br/>
<br/>
For anti-virus software the Consumer Reports Sept 04 issue suggests:<br/>
<br/>
* Trend Micro PC-cillin $50 and $25 yearly fee (if you want to keep it<br/>
updated on the latest viruses)<br/>
<br/>
* Norton AntiVirus $50 and $20 yearly fee<br/>
<br/>
They both do scheduled scans (so it will periodically scan automatically)<br/>
and will check for spyware too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482160932">Thanks Joyce.<br/>
<br/>
That email didn&#39;t have an attachment to begin with, so it didn&#39;t need to be<br/>
stripped off.<br/>
<br/>
I did get a virus, which I got rid of with AVG and a bit of bold file<br/>
deleting! I was hoping it was a coincidence though. As I use MS for<br/>
everything.....AND have a network of several computers being used freely by<br/>
several children & Wwoofers ....I get a few viruses! I really must get<br/>
around to learning linux.<br/>
