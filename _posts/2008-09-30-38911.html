<div id="ygrps-yiv-725406011">There is a boy in our homeschool group who idolizes my son.  <br/>
Unfortunately, there is a personality clash and my son would prefer <br/>
not to play with this boy.  This has been going on for about 4 years <br/>
now and it&#39;s just not working out.  I&#39;ve told my son he can&#39;t be <br/>
rude, but I don&#39;t seek out this family or this boy.  But my ex does.<br/>
<br/>
The mom seems to think that the boys can work it out so her son <br/>
doesn&#39;t get his feelings hurt; IMO there is no way for my son to <br/>
politely decline to play with this boy without causing hurt feelings <br/>
for both the mom and her son.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t see the point of forcing a friendship when <br/>
personalities just don&#39;t mesh and I&#39;ve said as much to the mom, which <br/>
didn&#39;t earn me any points, to say the least.<br/>

As an adult I don&#39;t socialize with people I don&#39;t like.  I&#39;m polite, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568862490">If you want to know the case for doing it, ask your ex or the kid&#39;s<br/>
mom :)  I can&#39;t see any reason for it.<br/>
<br/>
You said that your ex seeks them out.  Do you mean that she invites<br/>
them over and makes plans with their family?  And this is something<br/>
that you can&#39;t change?  If this is the case, perhaps you could talk to<br/>
your son and find out if there are certain kinds of things that are<br/>
less annoying to do with the kid.  Going to a place where there is<br/>
something to see (science center? zoo?)  or do (skate park?) might be<br/>
less annoying than an open ended playdate where he is expected to hang<br/>
out and talk with the other child the whole time.  Perhaps you could<br/>
suggest to your son that he tells his mom that he would rather not<br/>
play with that child, but if she insists on making plans that he would<br/>
rather they do X.<br/>

<br/>
Interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences aren&#39;t evenly  <br/>
distributed among humans.  Some people don&#39;t know they&#39;re irritating  <br/>
or that they&#39;re being too pushy, but luckily lots of people can find  <br/>
friends who don&#39;t mind their particular quirks and tics.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s leftover school assumptions that lead homeschoolers to  <br/>
seek same-age, same-sex playmates.  It worked better for my kids to  <br/>
go by interests than age/gender.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents expect that a casual friendship at a playgroup should  <br/>
extend to weekend sleepovers and such, and that&#39;s difficult too.<br/>
<br/>
Once after a conference, in the online debriefing and chit chit, the  <br/>
mom of a &#39;tween girl just went off on everyone about her perception  <br/>
that the girls seemed already to know each other from the year before  <br/>
and were in groups and her daughter wasn&#39;t able to (I don&#39;t remember  <br/>
the phrasing but something like) break into to any of the groups, and  <br/>
that made it just like school, that our kids and our conference were  <br/>
just like school.<br/>
<br/>
I think school is the place where kids are pressed to hang out with  <br/>
the kids in their class, and forbidden to socialize with kids more  <br/>
than one year older or younger.   The idea that someone would be  <br/>
guaranteed a social life just because they were there was the  <br/>
schoolish idea, in my view.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling conferences are generally filled with very friendly and  <br/>
generous and welcoming people.  Same with local groups, very often,  <br/>
but it can&#39;t guarantee relationships and shouldn&#39;t be expected to.<br/>

&gt; them over and makes plans with their family?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My ex is pretty much on board with unschooling, but still gets <br/>
nervous that the kids aren&#39;t doing enough socially and tends to <br/>
overschedule them on the weekends.  This includes not only going <br/>
places, but having people over or going to their homes to play. The <br/>
last thing they did was take a vacation to a beach house (locally) <br/>
and invited a slew of people over the course of the week to swim and <br/>
go crabbing and such.  This family and kids were invited.  As far as <br/>
I was told my son did play nice, but would have preferred not to have <br/>
had this boy there.  <br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention that my son is 10; this boy is not quite 7.  My <br/>
ex said that because my daughter (14) has liked to play with this <br/>
boy&#39;s sister (she&#39;s not quite 10) that she couldn&#39;t invite the girl <br/>
without inviting the boy.  My daughter is friendly with the girl and <br/>
will play with her, but they really don&#39;t have anything in common and <br/>
my daughter doesn&#39;t usually seek to hang out with this girl either.<br/>

<br/>
This is true.  My son has befriended other kids with quirks, kids who <br/>
had a hard time with other kids.  Unfortunately he moved to the <br/>
opposite coast.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It worked better for my kids to go by interests than age/gender.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  My son is very into WOW at the moment but finds that most <br/>
of the kids we know aren&#39;t allowed to play.  Most of the people my <br/>
son plays with wrt WOW are adults.<br/>
<br/>
My son is a lot like me in that while he does like to be with other <br/>
people to a certain extent, he&#39;s a bit more introverted and likes to <br/>
do more solo activities and needs more down time.  As a kid myself, <br/>
my parents, my mom especially, thought my &#39;shyness&#39; was something she <br/>
needed to fix, so went overboard trying to make me more social.  I&#39;m <br/>
not antisocial, but I do limit my social activities.  I believe my ex <br/>
feels the same way about my son; and because he&#39;s not in school <br/>
hanging with kids all day he needs to get out there more and <br/>
socialize, hence the invites and overscheduling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717318847">I&#39;m not really understanding what Jay is asking.<br/>
<br/>
Is the child complaining and asking Jay to step in and talk to his ex  <br/>
about not including the boy and not over-scheduling socially?<br/>
Is the child complaining and Jay wants to know how to respond, given  <br/>
that it is out of his (Jay&#39;s) control?<br/>
Is Jay looking for ammunition to use against his ex as proof that  <br/>
she&#39;s not as considerate and kind a parent as he is?<br/>
<br/>
It is hard enough to live together and co-parent, but when you live  <br/>
separately, you give up having almost any say-so over what goes on  <br/>
during the other parent&#39;s time with the child. Honestly, if the worst  <br/>
is over-scheduling the child&#39;s social life, that&#39;s pretty lucky. We  <br/>
can&#39;t tell, from here, what&#39;s really going on. Maybe Jay is  <br/>
overreacting because Jay would feel over-scheduled and resentful under  <br/>
the same circumstances, but maybe the son is fine. Maybe the son has a  <br/>
perfectly good time with the other kid and with his social schedule,  <br/>
but complains to Jay because he senses that Jay wants to hear him  <br/>
complain about his ex. Who knows? We don&#39;t, but that&#39;s a very common  <br/>
scenario.<br/>
<br/>
It feels like the conversation is about how wrong Jay&#39;s ex is to do  <br/>
this to their son, but I don&#39;t see what good that kind of conversation  <br/>
can do.<br/>
<br/>
All of us sometimes get stuck in a social situation with someone we&#39;re  <br/>
not crazy about because other family members have connections in that  <br/>
family.  I&#39;m not saying to do it on purpose to a kid (for their own  <br/>
good). But it naturally happens. I&#39;m hearing that this is an annoying  <br/>
young child who pesters Jay&#39;s son, not a bully who is threatening him  <br/>
or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say Jay&#39;s best option is to support the child in speaking up for  <br/>
himself and making his own wants and needs clear. Maybe do some role  <br/>
playing with him on how to handle the annoying child, how to find ways  <br/>
to enjoy himself. Maybe he could take a book to read or a laptop to  <br/>
watch a dvd on or a handheld game to sit and play on his own. I have  <br/>
three kids - one is SUPER social and one is very reserved (the other  <br/>
is in between). So, yeah, the reserved child did end up with over- <br/>
scheduled social life and spending time with other kids who annoyed  <br/>
her, but she learned to create her own little oasis for herself  <br/>
wherever we went. Sometimes we&#39;d find her alone up in a tree.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668976904">Hi Jay,<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago, I had to have a &quot;not very nice talk&quot; to another <br/>
child&#39;s mum about her son &quot;not being very nice&quot;, because my kid&#39;s <br/>
decided he doesn&#39;t want to be friends anymore. <br/>
<br/>
The point here is, if your son is really fed-up wtih this kid, then he <br/>
should tell mum, if he feels so strongly about it. Your kid needs to <br/>
understand that he doesn&#39;t have to put up with it. He can politely <br/>
excuse himself to somewhere else when this kid is around. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, the other boy&#39;s mom is complaining to me and my ex how our son <br/>
keeps shunning her son, and now that my son is attending the same <br/>
homeschool coop she wants &#39;the boys to come to an understanding and <br/>
play nice and keep the coop pleasant for everyone&#39; (her words).  And <br/>
she has commented to me that my ex told her that my son had a <br/>
negative reaction about her son visiting with my ex and a group of <br/>
other people/kids at the beach -- when word was the kids played <br/>
wonderfully and had fun crabbing together.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the mom of the other kid that seems to want to force a <br/>
friendship, and I&#39;m more looking for guidance from other unschoolers <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all.  My ex and I have an extremely amicable relationship.  My <br/>
concern is that she is a bit more swayed by the &#39;have-tos&#39; of <br/>
parenting and that this mom will try to force the issue with her, <br/>
because they like to socialize.  I want to protect my son from being <br/>

sure we&#39;re both aware of the issues with this boy and our son, and <br/>
it&#39;s more about making sure my son is comfortable here, there, and at <br/>
the homeschool coop.<br/>

son isn&#39;t made to feel bad about not being best buddies with this <br/>
boy, esp. by the other mom.  My ex is a great parent but is a bit <br/>

may not like, but give him tools to help him deal with it politely so <br/>
nobody&#39;s feelings get hurt.  The other mom is making my son out to be <br/>
the bad guy because he doesn&#39;t like her son, and that&#39;s what I want <br/>

son doing his own thing if he chooses and not have to entertain this <br/>
boy when he visits.  Or they can do group things (like they did at <br/>
the beach) so they&#39;re doing the same thing but not having direct <br/>
interaction.<br/>

  I&#39;ve mentioned that to him before, but I think it (the unschooler&#39;s <br/>
  guild) was in another realm than where he&#39;s playing? Can someone <br/>
  refresh my memory where that was?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought I&#39;d go back to your original post, because I can&#39;t help  <br/>
wondering what the real problem is. I just can&#39;t believe you really  <br/>
needed  someone here to say it is okay for your son to decide for  <br/>
himself if and when he wants or doesn&#39;t want to play with someone else?<br/>
<br/>
Why would that not be completely obvious?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is a boy in our homeschool group who idolizes my son.<br/>
Unfortunately, there is a personality clash and my son would prefer<br/>
not to play with this boy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the group is large, he can possibly somewhat avoid him, but if it  <br/>
is a small group it would be very meanspirited for your son to exclude  <br/>
that boy from playing with the group just because he doesn&#39;t like him.  <br/>
Your son should take other things to do so that he can go off on his  <br/>
own and get a break from the other boy, perhaps. But, at a homeschool  <br/>
group activity, I think that mostly kids should be asked to be  <br/>
inclusive. This advice doesn&#39;t apply if there is a serious issue such  <br/>
as a child being violent or really mean in some way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; This has been going on for about 4 years now and it&#39;s just not  <br/>
working out. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since they were 2 and 6 years old?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For four years this  I&#39;ve told my son he can&#39;t be<br/>
rude, but I don&#39;t seek out this family or this boy.  But my ex does.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Has your son not mentioned to her that he doesn&#39;t like this kid? She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t care? She thinks he does like him really? She thinks....wait,  <br/>
don&#39;t bother to tell me what you think she thinks...let her come and  <br/>
ask herself, if she wants, though. Again, what she decides to do is up  <br/>
to her. If she has the same information you have but decides to make  <br/>
plans that include that family anyway, then either she doesn&#39;t care or  <br/>
doesn&#39;t really believe him or thinks it isn&#39;t that much to ask him to  <br/>
be nice to the kid on occasion so that the families can get together.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you think she just needs you to say, &quot;Someone on an unschooling  <br/>
list said kids should be able to decide for themselves if they want or  <br/>
don&#39;t want to play with another kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he needs more help in how to say he doesn&#39;t want to play right  <br/>
now without being rude. Telling him not to be rude might seem, to him,  <br/>
like saying he has to suck it up and play with the kid whether he  <br/>
likes it or not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The mom seems to think that the boys can work it out so her son<br/>
doesn&#39;t get his feelings hurt; IMO there is no way for my son to<br/>
politely decline to play with this boy without causing hurt feelings<br/>
for both the mom and her son.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This really makes no sense. He can say, &quot;I&#39;d like to be by myself  <br/>
right now.&quot; He can sit and read a book or play with his handheld  <br/>
videogame or whatever. What&#39;s so hard or rude about that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I don&#39;t see the point of forcing a friendship when<br/>
personalities just don&#39;t mesh and I&#39;ve said as much to the mom, which<br/>
didn&#39;t earn me any points, to say the least.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said, more than a few times, &quot;Well, they&#39;re not hitting it off  <br/>
right now, but maybe they will in the future.&quot; THAT is the reality of  <br/>
what I&#39;ve observed with kids, over and over and over. They may not get  <br/>
along now, but in a few months one or both might move into a new  <br/>
developmental stage or one or the other might develop a new interest  <br/>
that appeals to the other. Be realistic and leave the possibility open.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As an adult I don&#39;t socialize with people I don&#39;t like.  I&#39;m polite,<br/>
if need be, but don&#39;t seek these people out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference between not seeking them out versus being  <br/>
together at homeschool events and telling the kid &quot;I don&#39;t like you  <br/>
and don&#39;t want to be your friend now or ever and stay away from me at  <br/>
homeschooling group activities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t get why this mom is so insistent our sons be friends.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because her son likes yours and my guess is that the daughter likes  <br/>
your daughter and the mom likes your ex and so it works out nicely if  <br/>
only your son would go along with the program (which he apparently  <br/>
does and then complains to you later). Is the younger child not liked  <br/>
by others? Has some personality characteristics that are difficult to  <br/>
tolerate? How often is he stuck playing with him? How many other kids  <br/>
are around when this is happening - are they part of a group and is he  <br/>
wanting to exclude that kid from the group so that he doesn&#39;t have to  <br/>
play with him?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040156704">Jay, I&#39;m &quot;hearing&quot; two things.<br/>
<br/>
First that you are concerned that your ex isn&#39;t hearing your son when he <br/>
expresses his desires, or that she is minimizing the seriousness of his <br/>
expression, and that you are looking for ways to impress upon her the <br/>
intensity of your son&#39;s feelings, as you see them, about this friend issue.<br/>
<br/>
Second that you would like to be able to coach your ex in some useful <br/>
phrases to help her nicely deter the other kid&#39;s mom from insisting on <br/>
individual playdates.<br/>
<br/>
Does that sound right?<br/>
<br/>
For the first concern - you mention that you and she converse a lot. Maybe <br/>
you should have a meeting with all three of you so that you can both hear <br/>
out what your son wants with clarity rather than reporting &quot;he said to <br/>
me...&quot; back and forth, and maybe brainstorm some other ideas for things that <br/>
he and your ex can do on the weekends that don&#39;t involve this other boy.<br/>
<br/>
When I discovered that Jayn did not want to play with another unschooled <br/>
child, I was lucky to be able to just be straightforward and honest with the <br/>
other mom. She is a radical unschooler, and very thoughtful about children. <br/>
She understood that this wasn&#39;t a criticism of her son, and that I was <br/>
really sorry about the situation. She offered to help mediate talking but <br/>
was so kind and understanding when Jayn didn&#39;t want to talk over whatever <br/>
the problem is.<br/>
<br/>
With people who aren&#39;t unschoolers it&#39;s harder. I just gave, I believe, <br/>
exactly the same advice to try the phrase &quot;not a good fit at the moment&quot; and <br/>
in this case you can use the age/maturity difference in your favor.<br/>
<br/>
I have also told another mom that Jayn and her daughter were &quot;having a hard <br/>
time coming to a consensus on what to play&quot;. In that situation I really <br/>
believe that the other girl had just stopped being interested in playing <br/>
with Jayn, for whatever unknown reason, and that is why they really couldn&#39;t <br/>
agree on what to play. The other girl would say that she was &quot;tired&quot; and <br/>
just lie down not interacting, and Jayn would get bored and frustrated <br/>
trying to draw her out. They have been alright in group situations, and that <br/>
is what I said.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to keep the focus on your son in the conversations rather <br/>
than her little boy. &quot;My son is feeling stressed. He&#39;s more of an introvert <br/>
and needs less socializing...he has enough activities during the week so we <br/>
need to pull back a little on the weekend...My son isn&#39;t ready to handle the <br/>
needs of a younger boy since he&#39;s still maturing himself...&quot; or the old <br/>
standby of simply not choosing to explain yourself at all: &quot;I&#39;m sorry we <br/>
can&#39;t make it&quot; and then stop (the hardest thing to do of all!). If the other <br/>
mother wants more explanation, &quot;It&#39;s a shame we have other commitments, but <br/>
we&#39;ll be at [group event] next weekend.&quot; Anyone who demanded to know what <br/>
those other commitments are is just plain rude.<br/>
<br/>
It boils down to the fact that you can&#39;t really control your ex, and you <br/>
can&#39;t control the relationship she has with your son. All you can do is make <br/>
your best suggestions and support your son when he comes home to his <br/>
unschooling nest. At least she is not trying to insist he go to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969870005">I think you&#39;re reading way too much into my posts. :)<br/>
<br/>
I know there isn&#39;t an issue with letting my son beg off playing with <br/>
this boy; yes there have been years of this, where the boys were <br/>
expected to play together and yes in the past my son got very annoyed <br/>
with this kid and was rude to him.<br/>
<br/>
We just joined the coop last week; this weekend I get the email from <br/>
the mom how very hurt she was that my son had a negative reaction to <br/>
her son (which I have no idea what she&#39;s talking about as I was with <br/>
my son the whole time and he never even spoke to her son).<br/>
<br/>
My concern is the trouble she&#39;s making out of the whole thing, <br/>
wanting to force the friendship.  She&#39;s telling me my son was <br/>
negative toward hers when with my ex, when my ex says he plays fine.<br/>
<br/>
I was just looking for some backup here because my ex can be easily <br/>
swayed toward more traditional parenting approaches (bedtimes, <br/>
limiting foods, tv, computers, and forcing friendships) by other <br/>
traditional parents than I am; I do sometimes need to reassure her <br/>
that what we&#39;re doing (yes, we coparent pretty darn well considering <br/>
the circumstances) is okay, that we&#39;re not screwing our kids up by <br/>
not making them do all these things other parents say they need to do.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the homeschool coop, most of the stuff happens when I&#39;m <br/>
not around (when this family is visiting my ex or vice versa).  My <br/>
son gets down because he&#39;s made out to be the bad guy by not sucking <br/>
it up to play with this kid.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been well known my son doesn&#39;t want to play with him; the issues <br/>
go back years. That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get, why out of a huge homeschool <br/>
coop this mom emails me and wants the boys to play together nicely at <br/>
coop.  There are at least 70+ others there.  Then gets my ex involved <br/>
(complains to her about me and about me to her).<br/>

Sounds to me like it would be a good opportunity for a drop off of the girl <br/>
and some special mom/son time for your ex and son. Except that it sounded <br/>
like the other mom wanted a kid to occupy the boy at the same time as her <br/>
girl was being occupied by your daughter, so she could have mom-chat time.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m thinking what you really want are ways to encourage your ex to stay <br/>

no suggestions, I&#39;m afraid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No - really just fishing to try to figure out what might help you.  <br/>
I&#39;ve given so much thought to these kinds of kid social issues, been  <br/>
through a couple of them that were pretty traumatic for a while and   <br/>
learned a LOT from the experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping Robyn&#39;s suggestions do it for you - they seemed right on to  <br/>
me, if her underlying assumptions were correct.<br/>
<br/>
So - is the reason your son doesn&#39;t like the other kid actually  <br/>
because the younger kid pesters him for attention? Or is there  <br/>
something else?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think maybe the kid pesters him even more because your son is  <br/>
ignoring him (having been told not to be rude, maybe ignoring him is  <br/>
his only recourse)?<br/>
<br/>
Again, just tossing out ideas. You said your son wasn&#39;t rude to him  <br/>
when you were with him, but I think you also said he didn&#39;t pay any  <br/>
attention to him, which could be construed as being rude if the child  <br/>
was wanting his attention.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to support my child being mean to a younger child who  <br/>
looked up to him or her, but at the same time wouldn&#39;t want my child  <br/>
to feel stuck having to spend very much time with a kid he/she didn&#39;t  <br/>
enjoy being around. That seems like your dilemma, too, right? So that  <br/>
part I totally understand.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie (my 17 yo) has a LOT of young &quot;fans&quot; because she teaches karate  <br/>
classes that include a lot of young children. Lots are homeschooled  <br/>
and are at social activities with us, too. I&#39;ve heard her say, very  <br/>
sweetly but firmly, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to play this game with you just  <br/>
ONE more time and then you&#39;re going to go play with --another kid--  <br/>
and I&#39;m going to do something else, right?&quot; She loves the kids, but  <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily want to spend hours and hours playing with them  <br/>
instead of hanging out with the other older kids. She gets down on the  <br/>
floor, looks them in the eye, and says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to play right  <br/>
now, but later I will play xyz with you.&quot; And she does. Maybe because  <br/>
they have that teacher/student martial arts relationship, too, they  <br/>
always seem to accept what she offers. Well, that and she really does  <br/>
like them, so I&#39;m sure they can feel that.<br/>
<br/>
Because it doesn&#39;t sound like the younger child is a bully or  <br/>
anything, I really suggest that you stick to counseling your son how  <br/>
to handle it himself unless he specifically asks you to do something.  <br/>
Is HE asking you to do something about it? Is HE even asking you to  <br/>
talk to his mother about it? Sometimes kids want to be able to  <br/>
complain, but don&#39;t necessarily want you to take care of the problem  <br/>
for them. That&#39;s such a manly thing to want to do, solve the problem  <br/>
for your child. He might be better off if you resist that urge,  <br/>
though. Anyway - something to consider.<br/>
