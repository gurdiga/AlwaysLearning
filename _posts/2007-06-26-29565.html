<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020308802">NOTE TO READERS:<br/>
I received the following by e-mail.  My response is at the bottom.   <br/>
Maybe don&#39;t respond to this one, but to the topics I will sort out  <br/>
and post separately.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
================================<br/>
Do you have something pre-written- somewhere... where you talk about  <br/>
how to switch the switch on the child who is used to being<br/>
guided through the day by the parents who mean well but have been  <br/>
inconsistent and maybe messed up!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  ....read below a little about what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
That is..... we (parents ) TRY  very hard to refrain from comments  <br/>
about not practicing piano and using the computer too much  and  <br/>
eating easy sweets instead of  other foods.....but we mess up. We are  <br/>
2 parents with slightly differing approaches.. One parent constantly  <br/>
reminds the kids to brush their teeth and the other lets them  <br/>
remember on their own One parent reminds the child that its bedtime.   <br/>
We remind the kids that practicing music is required because the  <br/>
music lessons cost money and on and on.....<br/>
<br/>
My daughter ( 12 and never been to school )  still asks me what is  <br/>
happening today instead of making her day happen .When  I suggest an  <br/>
activity she likes the idea... but is not the one to think of it  <br/>
first... like call a friend over or go out to play tennis.  She is  <br/>
used to having choices offered to her instead of knowing that she has  <br/>
ALL the choices available. That, I&#39;m sure, is my fault as the one who  <br/>
has always been the leader of the pack. Wanna go for a bike ride?  &quot;  <br/>
sure &quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I know she loves to go to the pool club but she does not ask but  <br/>
rather says OK when I ask her if she would like to call a friend and  <br/>
head over to the pool.<br/>
Or when I say, wanna play tennis.... she says OK.  ...Not usually  <br/>
thinking of it for herself.  If I say nothing- she DOES use the  <br/>
computer to play Runescape but I know she loves hunting for mushrooms  <br/>
and bike riding and swimming and hanging out at the river.  It  <br/>
appears that she is waiting for those activities to happen...<br/>
not making them happen.<br/>
<br/>
So... MY thoughts revert to .. Well, I guess she really doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
to do these things that badly or she would have asked.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to help her to feel empowered.. Have I totally  <br/>
messed her up?  Can this be remedied? Can this be un- done?<br/>
================================<br/>
<br/>
My/Sandra&#39;s first response:<br/>
================================<br/>
All these things have been discussed, but much of the discussion is  <br/>
probably still in archives.<br/>
<br/>
Some things you might want to look at are<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to take the questions to the list without your name, and  <br/>
you&#39;ll get better answers there from lots of people, and the answers  <br/>
I write will benefit lots of people.<br/>
<br/>
==================================================<br/>
<br/>
If any of you feel like searching archives of this or  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion and bringing a link to prior discussions, that  <br/>
would be very cool.<br/>
