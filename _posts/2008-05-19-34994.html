<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055120024">&quot;The effect of belief on length of life&quot; isn&#39;t really what I mean.  I  <br/>
mean how does what one believes about length of life affect how one  <br/>
acts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 From the discussion from which I am banished:<br/>
<br/>
KathyJo:<br/>
You seem focused on, “What if we die tomorrow?” I’m focused on, “What  <br/>
if we live forever?”<br/>
<br/>
Sylvia:<br/>
<br/>
I think it’s possible to do both. We certainly expect to live a long  <br/>
time and are doing our best to make sure our kids have the skills and  <br/>
knowledge they’ll need to live full, joyous, self-sufficient lives.<br/>
<br/>
======================================<br/>
<br/>
I have for a long time had this justification or rationale about  <br/>
whether to hurry or dawdle:<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m going to live for years, I have time to do this later.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m going to die tomorrow, this wasn&#39;t important to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With my children, too.  When Holly was nine years old and not  <br/>
reading, part of my calm acceptance was that tool I already had,  <br/>
which was to think &quot;If she&#39;s going to live a long time, she has time  <br/>
to learn to read.  If she&#39;s dying tomorrow, it doesn&#39;t matter whether  <br/>
she could read.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A large part of my internal acceptance of unschooling was getting rid <br/>
of the timeline.  If kids are in school there is always a timeline in <br/>
which things must be done, taught, learned, etc.  School at home is <br/>
like that too.  The woman with the blog is very invested in that idea <br/>
as well, to impart all of her motherly wisdom and embed it in her <br/>
kids while they are still young and moldable, to ensure that they get <br/>
all that she thinks they need to be successful people.<br/>
<br/>
Every time I&#39;ve gone down that path, my kids have shown me other <br/>
ways.  If a child doesn&#39;t see the need to know a particular set of <br/>
knowledge, then whatever they get from it, isn&#39;t what you think they <br/>
will get from it.  <br/>
<br/>
For a long time, I wondered wether Chamille would ever understand <br/>
mathematical concepts.  It wasn&#39;t that I was giving her math lessons <br/>
and she was rejecting them, it was more that she has showed little to <br/>
know interest in it, so wether she knew any, was/is hard to tell.  <br/>
<br/>
Getting to know Chamille and really focusing on what she IS <br/>
interested in has shown me other skills and knowledge sets that <br/>
aren&#39;t particularly valued by the educational system, but valuable in <br/>
and of itself, and especially valuable because it was/is part and <br/>
parcel of who she is as a person.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux is fascinated with numbers and mathematical concepts.  They <br/>
are swirling around in her head all the time.  It is part of who she <br/>
is as a person.<br/>
<br/>
What bothers me about the classical education approach (I know we <br/>
weren&#39;t really talking about that) is that it assumes a set of <br/>
knowledge that must be known or the person is deemed uneducated.  It <br/>
is the same with public schooling and school at home, the idea that a <br/>
certain set of knowledge must be learned in order for a child to be <br/>
considered educated.<br/>
<br/>
I have to kids that are really great, and really value knowledge, not <br/>
the knowledge that I find of value, but knowledge they find of <br/>
value.  How can it be any other way?  There is nothing in the world <br/>
that supports the idea that knowledge, not valued by the holder, is <br/>
valuable at all.<br/>
<br/>
If I died tomorrow, I die knowing what I know, liking what I like, <br/>
valuing what I value.  If I live much longer, I get to add to what I <br/>
know and what I like and what I value.</div>

the parent value something--like classical education--that doesn&#39;t mean your kids will, <br/>
or that all your kids will--so there will be those who succeed and those who fail.  With <br/>
unschooling, there is no &quot;failure.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I have to think that the school-at-homers are experiencing the same phenomena that <br/>
happens in every classroom that I&#39;ve ever known.  Heck--every situation, including a <br/>
discussion at our house in which my kids have lost interest before I have--that if they <br/>
aren&#39;t interested there&#39;s no learning taking place.<br/>
<br/>
And so then you get into coercion--how to make them pay attention, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284281602">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying this discussion. And I really liked what Jenny wrote: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I died tomorrow, I die knowing what I know, liking what I like, <br/>
&gt; valuing what I value. If I live much longer, I get to add to what I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This morning, my 15 year old is writing her GCSE English Literature exam at<br/>
a local community college (for students ages 12  16). We arrived along with<br/>
1000 or so other teenagers arriving for school, all rushing in one direction<br/>
or another. We went to reception, and waited there for about ½ hour until<br/>
the invigilator arrived to take Kerrin down to the exam centre. There was a<br/>
screen in the reception area, showing footage of what all the school had to<br/>
offer. So many great activities  sport, art, drama, travel. The general<br/>
atmosphere was one of activity and purpose. Sitting there, I felt a<br/>
momentary sadness: Could I possibly give my children these kinds of<br/>
opportunities? It seemed like so much was available. And then I thought<br/>
about how real opportunities are chosen, taken, not enforced upon people.<br/>
These kids have a lot offered to them. But they do not have the option to<br/>
say No thank you. Kerrin and I were talking about how nice it would be if<br/>
kids could come to places like this to do things that they want to do, and<br/>
skip the things that do not interest them. So, after a bit of faltering, I<br/>
was reassured. My kids may not have as much offered to them. But they can<br/>
go out and find what they would like to do and pursue that.<br/>
<br/>
Increasingly I see compulsory education as a great moral wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
<br/>

Someone I know (and have tried to like) has this on one of her online  <br/>
profiles.  She had the choice of anything and everything on earth and  <br/>
in her head, and chose to show this to the world:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Uhhh, yeah...whatever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not a homeschooler at all.  She is a mom, and that&#39;s a bummer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I look at what unschoolers have put up on Facebook and Myspace and  <br/>
Livejournal and Blogspot and such places and it&#39;s all HAPPY and  <br/>
upbeat and hopeful and joyous.<br/>

too, but in our relationship from my point of view it works more like<br/>
a dance of opportunism. He does his own thing, I throw ideas into the<br/>
mix and if he&#39;s not interested, he&#39;s not interested, if he is, great,<br/>
we can explore further. And I keep it abstract. Non-specific. Because<br/>
I really don&#39;t know what the specifics are. I want my son to become an<br/>
adult with &#39;marketable skills&#39;. Which are? Whatever he decides they<br/>
are. It was the same with my daughter. There&#39;s no way in the world I<br/>
could have predicted when she was 12 that her main interest at<br/>
20 would be forensic investigation; and there&#39;s no way in the world I<br/>
would have been able to say to her at 12 that those were specific<br/>
skills she needed to have. <br/>
<br/>
And Latin? There&#39;s a webpage I know of, don&#39;t have the url to hand,<br/>
that lists all the Latin words and phrases in common usage, with their<br/>
meanings and origins. I&#39;d say to my son, learn those words and phrases<br/>
off by heart and then forget Latin. Do something useful with your<br/>
time. I did two years of Latin at high school and I *know* now that<br/>
that one page I could have learned off by heart in a week was really<br/>
all I ever needed.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my own personal struggles in life is to not be cynical about <br/>
things.  I&#39;ve been dealing with it since I was about 9, that I can <br/>
remember.<br/>
<br/>
It is a constant work in progress, that gets better and better as I <br/>
get older and more knowledgable about life.  It has to do with <br/>
priorities as well.  I can choose to spend my time with positive <br/>
outlooks and things go better, or I can choose to spend my time <br/>
viewing things negatively.  It&#39;s a shift in perspective that happens <br/>
a million times a day.  (ok a small exaggeration, but still...)<br/>
<br/>
Even to this day, the thing that I am most cynical about is school.  <br/>
It was way back when I was 9, and continues to be my cynical <br/>
trigger.  Through unschooling, I have been able to focus more on the <br/>
positive aspect of what we do, rather than what we don&#39;t do.  Even <br/>
with the &quot;un&quot; next to &quot;school&quot;, that used to trip me up a lot. <br/>
<br/>
In general life things, I think I&#39;ve mostly been an optomistic <br/>
person, looking for the good in everything, and that has helped me <br/>
get through the cynicism that I have towards school.  Still working <br/>
on it, but I don&#39;t let it affect me in my daily life.  I just try not <br/>
to &quot;go&quot; there, since I know it triggers that cynicism! <br/>
<br/>
The best thing that I know how to do, to counteract cynicism, is to <br/>
focus on what is wonderful, and that inherently causes me to put out <br/>
good, positive things in the world, rather than yucky.</div>

get to have in the direct future that will positively benefit us.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 14 yr old has changed directions of &quot;what she wants to be when she <br/>
grows up&quot; so many times.  In her own person, it all connects.  <br/>
Someone looking from the outside wouldn&#39;t see it, but I do, and she <br/>
does.  If I had taken her desire to work with animals to mean that <br/>
she needed to study animals and involve herself in a career working <br/>
as a vet or whatnot, I would&#39;ve done her a huge disservice by telling <br/>
her what she needed to know to get there.  She would&#39;ve missed all <br/>
that other stuff in between.<br/>
<br/>
Now, she likes fashion, not current popular fashion, more like late <br/>
80&#39;s club fashion.  What led her there was her interest in Pokemon.  <br/>
Weird but true, and I could write it in a timeline fashion of how she <br/>
got there from Pokemon.  Pokemon was her first real interest that <br/>
fueled her everything, even her love of animals!</div>
