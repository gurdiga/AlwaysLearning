When my son Shawn was 12 ... he was considering going to school then. <br/>
He wanted the whole social  scene, but also was feeling like he <br/>
needed to master more skills academically.<br/>

How did that resolve itself. Does he get the social scene elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
I am offering my 12 yr old boy the option of freedom from school next <br/>
year and he is concerned about missing friends. I want to offer him <br/>
contact with other guys his age but I wonder if I&#39;d be able to hook <br/>
up with any.<br/>

school---just sfternoons and weekends. If they aren&#39;t his friends, they <br/>
won&#39;t. He could also make a few homeschooled friends through local groups. <br/>
You could come to the conference where he&#39;ll meet a few teens that could lead <br/>
to long-term long-distance friends. Not Back to School Camp could also be an <br/>
option.<br/>

teams.  If not, what *does* he like?  Can you sign him up for classes or<br/>
workshops in something that interests him?<br/>

i am now teaching in a middle school.  There are lots of ways you can <br/>
have your son hook up with kids his age.  A sports, summer classes, <br/>
church groups, homeschooling groups with teens in it (we have a great <br/>
one) etc.  But please, don&#39;t think the social scene that happens at a <br/>
middle school positive for middle school students.  It simply isn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
My experience as a teacher again confirms why I will never send my <br/>
children to school.<br/>
