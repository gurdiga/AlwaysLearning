Can you  maybe ask for the gym to give her a scholarship or loan or <br/>
something?  <br/>
Can she work cleaning there or  something?<br/>

****My son Shawn was in gymnastics for a few years and was able to earn his  <br/>
lessons by coaching the younger kids.  He also did some work at another gym  <br/>
so that he was then allowed to practice and workout there.  He was older  than <br/>
your daughter, but it worked well for him.  <br/>
