We are in Crofton.  DH has an appointment in Ellicott City which is <br/>
45 min. north west of here.  He can drop us off in Baltimore and I <br/>
think we can take a Marc Train into DC.  We are determined to be <br/>
there.<br/>

Our picture is in the photos section here. (I posted that in another <br/>

Allison is 12 and Virginia is 10.<br/>
