<div id="ygrps-yiv-845122677">When I was a kid growing up in a suburban development, there were lots of<br/>
kids in the neighborhood.  Most of us got along and played together (some we<br/>
liked more than others).  Across the street from us were 2 bullies.  The<br/>
older one was worse, but his brother followed in his footsteps.  Most of the<br/>
bullying was verbal: making fun of people, name calling, etc.  I do remember<br/>
one occasion when the older one was trying to choke my older sister (and I<br/>
remember whacking him over the head with a hoppity hop ball to make him go<br/>
away) when we were in our yard.  I don&#39;t remember my parents ever<br/>
intervening, except maybe with the standard things (ie walk away).<br/>
<br/>
One day I was playing with another girl, when the younger bully came along<br/>
and started tormenting us.  I don&#39;t remember how, but he got us trapped in<br/>
our neighbor&#39;s garbage bin (a wooden shed-like thing they stored their metal<br/>
trash cans in).  Then we heard the older boy ask the younger one who he had<br/>
in there.  For some reason he wanted to go after my friend.  He opened the<br/>
door and started choking her.  The only thing I could think of to do was<br/>
pick up a rock and hit him on the head with it.  He ran home crying.<br/>
Apparently his mother called my mother on the phone, because the next thing<br/>
I knew she was there to bring me home.  And as we walked past the bullies<br/>
house, their mother screamed at my mother to &quot;keep your kid away from my<br/>
kid!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember my mother ever talking to me about any alternatives, about<br/>
my feelings, and I remember being grounded for hitting someone with a rock<br/>
(I was probably 8 or 9).  But at the time, my friend was being hurt, I knew<br/>
words wouldn&#39;t work (never had before) and I wasn&#39;t strong enough to push<br/>
him off by myself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling.  I remember the incidents but not any help from my<br/>
parents.<br/>
