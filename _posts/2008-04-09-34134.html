<div id="ygrps-yiv-9300112">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a &quot;newbie&quot; and my only DD is 21 months old. However I have been<br/>
reading every day now for the past 2 months or so. I get so excited<br/>
about unschooling! I think about it every day and I am starting to<br/>
imagine this wonderful life that I never even considered before. So<br/>
thank you to all of you that post, for sharing your lives and all of<br/>
the inspiration. I actually have been writing in my journal and want<br/>
to write a little &quot;essay&quot; about my short &quot;unschooling journey&quot; thus<br/>
far -- which is really funny to me because I always think of myself as<br/>
a &quot;reader&quot; and not so much a writer (I was good at it in school but<br/>
never really enjoyed it like I do reading). <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I get happier and happier but the one damper is my husband<br/>
has pretty much said &quot;no way!&quot; He knows that I have been reading a lot<br/>
about it and it bothers him but he pretty much doesn&#39;t say anything.<br/>
And I have not been broaching the topic too much because I figure we<br/>
have 3 more years (before thinking about school) and I am trying to<br/>
learn so much myself right now.<br/>
<br/>
But 2 nights ago he said, &quot;stop reading that stuff, it is a waste if<br/>
time!&quot; (because he doesn&#39;t think that we should home school much less<br/>
unschool!) I tried to talk to him about it last night -- telling him<br/>
that I understand that he thinks it is a wast of time but I don&#39;t feel<br/>
that it is. I tried to get him to voice his concerns too and here are<br/>
some things that came out:<br/>
<br/>
He said<br/>
&quot;You aren&#39;t always going to like what you do... in life in your job etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is nothing wrong with a set curriculum... what&#39;s wrong with<br/>
learning science, math etc?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;School is fine...&quot; (we both liked school, I actually LOVED it, and am<br/>
a certified teacher, my mother is also a teacher, his mother too, and<br/>
both of my grandmothers!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She (our dd) will be home all day with you (two of us alone) ... I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to be with my mom all day... I would have been so bored<br/>
at home&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and my favorites &quot;I don&#39;t want to do it, I don&#39;t want to hear it! I<br/>
want you to leave!&quot; (imagine a very whiny tone)<br/>
<br/>
He also mentioned &quot;trying&quot; school first (and then if she doesn&#39;t like<br/>
it we can consider other options...)<br/>
<br/>
I tried talking to him about some of these things... I have some ideas<br/>
for responses, but also a lot of this is very clear in my mind after<br/>
reading so much but I have a hard time articulating it in words. Also,<br/>
he is just shutting down, he doesn&#39;t want to hear any of it!<br/>
<br/>
I get a little bit down about all of this but I&#39;m trying to keep<br/>
perspective and realize that for one we have a lot of time before we<br/>
have to think of school. I really FEEL deep down that unschooling is a<br/>
path that would be great for our family.... I really don&#39;t have any<br/>
doubts anymore that I want to try and live this way... How do I start<br/>
to &quot;wade in&quot; slowly with my husband? He doesn&#39;t like reading like I<br/>
do, and he doesn&#39;t want to hear it from me (and even if he listened I<br/>
don&#39;t know how well I can explain or how convincing I would be) <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should slow down a bit on my reading and just let it be for a<br/>
while.... <br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long... thanks for any input.<br/>

<br/>
Next year will be my 25th wedding anniversary.  I haven&#39;t started  <br/>
talking about what we might do, a party or what, and it&#39;s too soon.   <br/>
Yet we&#39;ve known since we got married when 25 years would be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too soon for you to be talking about it so much that your   <br/>
husband say &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more important for your daughter to have two parents than to be  <br/>
unschooled.  Those aren&#39;t your only two choices, but if you and your  <br/>
husband have a divide between you because of this, you might have NO  <br/>
choices left; you might end up with a divorce, and your daughter in  <br/>
school by court order, and her needing to deal with a step parent or  <br/>
two.<br/>
<br/>
Chill.  DO some of the things people are talking about.  Instead of  <br/>
saying &quot;I read that kids will...,&quot; say &quot;[daughter&#39;s name] did this  <br/>
today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Make it about her, not about hypotheticals or other families.<br/>
<br/>
The happier your husband is the more he&#39;ll want to do what you want  <br/>
to do, too, I&#39;m sure.  And IF you end up &quot;trying school first,&quot;  <br/>
that&#39;s how a lot of families get to  unschooling--by seeing for  <br/>
themselves that school&#39;s not like it used to be, and not lovable to  <br/>
all people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887833349">Susan,<br/>
I don&#39;t have any answers, but some questions that I hope might help.<br/>
Since you do have those years until the possibility of school, why not<br/>
focus on the positives right now? From feeding to sleeping to<br/>
diapering to behavior, etc...there are so many things about parenting<br/>
during the first two years of a child&#39;s life that two parents already<br/>
have had an opportunity to agree or disagree on. Are you happy with<br/>
the degree of agreement you have on those? I would stress those areas<br/>
in which the two of you see eye to eye during your conversations,<br/>
rather than try to engage your husband on a &quot;I&#39;m right/you&#39;re wrong&quot;<br/>
discussion (not that you&#39;re trying to do this, but maybe he&#39;s coming<br/>
at it from such an angle?)<br/>
Another thought is that as the breadwinning parent, I know *I* would<br/>
be jealous of the parent staying home doing the hypothetical<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling. I&#39;d want all that time to enjoy  my child<br/>
and see them grow! Is there any possibility that your husband, maybe<br/>
even not realizing, might be preemptively resenting you for having<br/>
that opportunity with your daughter?<br/>
Not that confronting him with any of this would be helplful at all -<br/>
probably actually counterproductive. But maybe thinking about it on<br/>
your own might help you modify your stance, so to speak, when dealing<br/>
with him?<br/>

I know when I get Very Excited about something, I want to share it With  <br/>
Enthusiasm with everyone I know. Often, when I&#39;m that excited about something, I  <br/>
come off to some people (like my husband) like one of those little, shrill,  <br/>
yapping dogs. Granted, some people like these dogs, but not the people who view <br/>
 my shared excitement like one of them! Maybe you might want to keep your  <br/>
excitement to yourself until it wanes. Maybe a lot. In the meantime, while  <br/>
you&#39;re reading, maybe you can find relaxed homeschoolers/unschoolers in your  area <br/>
and see if there are any who are compatible with your own family *outside*  <br/>
of school/homeschool. Folks you could hang out with in the future (when the  <br/>
excitement has worn off) on weekends or evenings or whatever time you&#39;re  <br/>
husband is home. Not to try to push him into it or to have a hidden agenda, just  <br/>
because you all get along and homeschooling is a side issue that he might be  <br/>

<br/>
At first it seems odd to think you are your husband&#39;s partner and  <br/>
then it&#39;s pointed out that you&#39;re your child&#39;s partner.  Figure out,  <br/>
gradually and gently, ways to get your whole family facing the same  <br/>
direction, being on the same team.  If your husband won&#39;t listen to  <br/>
you, maybe that partnership wasn&#39;t comfortably established before you  <br/>
had children.  If you  don&#39;t know when to talk to him and how much to  <br/>
say, ditto.  It&#39;s your job (and it&#39;s not easy) to make your husband  <br/>
comfortable with your, and to make your children comfortable with  <br/>
their parents, and the dad comfortable with the children.  Some  <br/>
families do that by copying what their parents did so they have  <br/>
someone else to blame if it goes wrong (when it goes wrong, more  <br/>
likely).  Some moms do it by baking cookies and making curtains and  <br/>
making beds, but that&#39;s not what makes a home happy.   Human factors-- <br/>
that&#39;s where it&#39;s at.  Respect and gentle ways of being.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve attacked your husband with an unschooling club, he might be  <br/>
skittish of unschooling for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Go easier.  Aim for kindergarten entry age or beyond, not for pre- <br/>
second-birthday.<br/>
<br/>
These might help:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185269464">Thank you to everyone who responded. Many of the things said were<br/>
things that I had in my mind but it definitely helps calm me down to<br/>
hear other people say them -- especially people with more experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 --If you&#39;ve attacked your husband with an unschooling club, he might be  <br/>

<br/>
Sandra -- this made me smile -- &quot;attacked with an unschooling club&quot;.<br/>
Honestly, &quot;the club&quot; has been more like a wet noodle... I purposely<br/>
have NOT been talking about this at all because I know that he&#39;s not<br/>
ready to discuss it and we have a lot going on right now (he is in<br/>
grad school). But I do think that the few excited comments I have made<br/>
have not been well timed or represented me or unschooling well. I<br/>
think it mostly irritates him to see how much I have been reading<br/>
about it when in his mind it is not worth pursuing.<br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate all of your words. I believe the most important thing<br/>
is to live some of the principles with my daughter and husband which<br/>
we already do. So we can keep building from there. And I totally agree<br/>
that having two parents is more important than unschooling for my<br/>
daughter&#39;s well-being. I guess I feel like &quot;I&#39;ve seen the light&quot; or at<br/>
least a new kind of light and it is hard to think that maybe we won&#39;t<br/>
be able to follow it...<br/>
<br/>
I can definitely see how a lot of this can help our family even if our<br/>
daughter does go to school too though, which is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634370595">&quot;....How are relaxed homeschoolers different from unschoolers? In my brief<br/>
searches, they seem to be very similar. ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve actually seen - and some of these call themselves unschoolers - which is why some people started the term &quot;Radical Unschoolers&quot;   At least that is how it is in my local group of diverse homeschoolers.  Think of it in terms of a sliding scale from homeschooling, relaxed homeschooling, unschooling, (and some might even say radical unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are &quot;They might do&#39;s&quot; for relaxed homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 - a curriculum that follows the child&#39;s interest - such as a unit on dinosaurs because that is what the child loves/has an interest in.<br/>
So they might do math using a dinosaur theme, read and write about dinosaurs and do work books about dinosaurs, etc.  But they might not actually finish the work book as the child loses interest - or they might skip around in the work book.<br/>
<br/>
- have a set reading time every day because reading is the one most important thing to them - child chooses what to read.<br/>
<br/>
- has math time at breakfast every day - some problem solving of one type or another chosen by parent.<br/>
<br/>
- purchase a curriculum or part of a curriculum and then skip around in it with a loose schedule of when they do it - with an expectation that it will get finished.<br/>
<br/>
- Some of it is the parenting mind set.  The parent is more of the &quot;boss&quot; in all things:  control over TV, music, games, etc.  how much they do or what they are allowed to do/play.  How late they stay up.<br/>
<br/>
- some feel that whatever they do is unschooling as long as they are not following a curriculum at a table.<br/>
<br/>
- there are on-line programs that the child pretty much works their way through - where they get to choose their projects and interests.<br/>
<br/>
- open to disruptions and spontaneous other activities as long as they eventually get back to &quot;real&quot; school work.<br/>

- They definitely do at least some school at home, just in a less strict kitchen table 5 days a week, this is our chosen curriculum, way that homeschoolers do.   Relaxed in that it is OK if we do this today or tomorrow as long as it gets done.  <br/>

<br/>
How are relaxed homeschoolers different from unschoolers? In my brief<br/>
searches, they seem to be very similar. But my guess is that people  <br/>
on this<br/>
list will have a different opinion!-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re still schooling their kids.<br/>
<br/>
If the dad meets a conservative school-at-home family, they&#39;ll  <br/>
probably be more anti-unschooling than teachers in the neighborhood  <br/>
would be!   The recommendation was to meet a happy family that knows  <br/>
kids can learn from playing, I think.<br/>

This is true.   Years ago some homeschooling mom was ecstatic with  <br/>
her newfound freedoms and liberal attitude because she had let her  <br/>
kids do their homework on the couch or in the yard.<br/>

there.  One of those links doesn&#39;t work yet, but it will soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34781820">I remember doing that in elementary school.  We had teachers that would have us take our books outside - sit under a tree and have class.  There was no air-conditioning and a cool breeze beckoned.  Each classroom had a door leading to the outside and we always left it open during warm weather.  Dogs would come in and lay in the back of the room.  But there were also times they would close all the blinds so we could not daydream out the window. <br/>
<br/>
 - but that was not unschooling either ;)<br/>

&quot;....How are relaxed homeschoolers different from unschoolers? In my<br/>
brief searches, they seem to be very similar. ...&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
They are and they aren&#39;t.<br/>
I&#39;ve been both so I feel qualified to answer this.:)<br/>
<br/>
When I was the eclectic/relaxed homeschooler my focus was still about<br/>
making sure we were doing &quot;educational&quot; types of activities. Yes, we<br/>
did mostly hands-on fun stuff the kids liked, but I was still seeing<br/>
it as a way to touch on &quot;science&quot; or &quot;history&quot;. We DID have a lot of<br/>
fun but sometimes we&#39;d hit walls where the kids didn&#39;t get all excited<br/>
about something I planned and it made me all grumpy.<br/>
<br/>
Not the best atmosphere for learning. I couldn&#39;t see that the video<br/>
games they were fascinated with were more valuable than the homemade<br/>
solar cooker I had planned.;)<br/>
<br/>
I was always the most hands-on, relaxed parent of EVERY group we ever<br/>
belonged to. I really wish we&#39;d run into some real unschoolers earlier<br/>
in the journey because I think it would have been a fairly easy<br/>
transition from an academic standpoint.<br/>
<br/>
The part that is missing  with the relaxed/eclectic approach is still<br/>
trust. It&#39;s just being more creative with how you get information into<br/>
children,that&#39;s all. Better....but not quite the complete trust that<br/>
unschoolers have in the human ability to learn.<br/>
<br/>
We may still raise butterflies or garden or go to museums, so to an<br/>
outsider we&#39;re doing some of the same activities. The difference is my<br/>
kids can show zero interest and that is just fine. The difference is<br/>
that I&#39;m not trying to check of some subject box or define their<br/>
learning experiences for them. The difference is that we do these<br/>
things to have fun and trust that learning happens when we&#39;re alive<br/>
and breathing.:)<br/>
