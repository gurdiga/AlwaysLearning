<div id="ygrps-yiv-540467272">I would like to hear how others handle moments with their children when the<br/>
kids feel that they get nothing, that their friends have more of everything<br/>
and that life for them really just sucks.<br/>
<br/>
My boys (11, 9, 5) are usually content and happy with the flow of their<br/>
lives.  BUT. sometimes... they&#39;re not.  It&#39;s natural, and I explained to<br/>
them that I have those same moments and days, too.<br/>
<br/>
Today was an example of that.  We went to the park, and DS9 asked that I<br/>
call a couple of his friends to come, too.  They met us at the park,<br/>
everyone was playing and having a great time.  Then, one of the boys who<br/>
came to meet us was delivered a new pair of shoes that he&#39;d been waiting for<br/>
(they arrived at his house, and Dad brought them to the park as requested).<br/>
DS11 immediately stopped playing with the child who got the new shoes and<br/>
came to me, insisting we leave *now*.  (he&#39;s been wanting a pair of these<br/>
particular shoes for some time, those toe shoe things)<br/>
<br/>
We gathered our stuff and left the park, and for the 10 minute drive home, I<br/>
heard how &quot;their mom gets them anything they want, even if they don&#39;t have<br/>
the money, and *she* doesn&#39;t care.  Every time we see them, they have<br/>
something new, and it&#39;s just not fair, all we ever get are tiny little toys,<br/>
we don&#39;t get anything we want...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sat and listened, and did not jump in with the list of things they they do<br/>
have.  I tried very hard to empathize with them, but at the same time, felt<br/>
like they were downright mean to me.  That&#39;s my own crap, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
So, in those moments, what do you say?  Do I just shut up and listen and<br/>
don&#39;t say anything?  Do I offer them a hug and keep my mouth closed?  Do I<br/>
apologise that I&#39;m unable to get them everything they desire?  Do I say,<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel like you don&#39;t get enough&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
A little background:  We&#39;re very honest about our money, I answer questions<br/>
when they have them, provide information about our finances, and get them<br/>
things they want.  I do believe they are entitled to our money just as much<br/>
as John and I are.  I go without in order to be able to provide more for<br/>
them.  Just wanting to clarify so people understood that I&#39;m not buying<br/>
myself everything I want and telling my kids &quot;no&quot;.  I don&#39;t do that.  We<br/>
always find a way to get what they want.  Which makes it even harder to hear<br/>
the things they were saying to me today.<br/>
<br/>
My nature is to be immediately defensive (working on that, really, I am), so<br/>
I try to be so careful about what I&#39;m saying and how I&#39;m saying it.  Like so<br/>
many, I wasn&#39;t raised in a way that taught me how to be empathetic.  My<br/>
defensiveness is likely the reason I survived my childhood.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
serve me anymore, so I&#39;m letting it go, but in moments like these, whoa,<br/>
it&#39;s the first ugly, anger-filled voice that floods my mind.  And because I<br/>
don&#39;t want to be that defensive person anymore, I just say nothing, for fear<br/>
of saying the wrong thing, or in the wrong way/tone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for some new tapes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone???  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52670023">-=- I do believe they are entitled to our money just as much as John  <br/>
and I are. =-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think kids are &quot;entitled&quot; to parents&#39; money. I know some  <br/>
people have said that in the past and made it sound cool, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
Kids don&#39;t understand about mortgages and insurance.  If parents are  <br/>
generous and helpful, that&#39;s enough.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to  <br/>
consider the money just as much the kids&#39; as yours.  If you&#39;re careful  <br/>
with it and you die it will be theirs. :-)  Marty owes us money for  <br/>
his jeep.  He&#39;s making payments when he has money, but he&#39;s taking  <br/>
classes now and not working.  The money he gives us now will end up  <br/>
being his again someday if he outlives us.<br/>
<br/>

I am), so<br/>
I try to be so careful about what I&#39;m saying and how I&#39;m saying it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like the best thing you can do.<br/>
I always tended to say something about what they did have, and I wish  <br/>
I could take some of those back.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Then, one of the boys who<br/>
came to meet us was delivered a new pair of shoes that he&#39;d been  <br/>

requested).<br/>
DS11 immediately stopped playing with the child who got the new shoes  <br/>
and<br/>

<br/>
I think I would have gone for a walk with the frustrated kid, just  <br/>
walked around the edge of the park and let him vent, and suggest that  <br/>
he find a way to calm himself and stay and play.  Because the kid came  <br/>
to meet you at the park.  That kind of made you the host family,  <br/>
didn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask him (soon or someday) how he would feel if a friend got  <br/>
angry because he got to do/have something.  I don&#39;t know what the  <br/>
answer should be, but running the scenario about how to deal with  <br/>
courtesy and comfort and being congratulatory to someone else even  <br/>
when there&#39;s jealousy might be helpful for situations that haven&#39;t yet  <br/>
happened.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374002664">This last 2-3 years have been tough financially for us. <br/>
Thank goodness it is starting to get better.<br/>
MD , now 8, grew up getting pretty much everything he wanted that we could <br/>
give him.<br/>
Then we were broke and could not do it anymore.<br/>
He was very very understanding.<br/>
When he could not get something we made plans to get it.<br/>
We saved pennies here and there.<br/>
We talked about what he wanted, looked up online, looked for sales and stuff <br/>
like that.<br/>
I think that helped him lots.<br/>
We are now saving for a PS3. We talk about it, look up sales.<br/>
We are probably waiting for the new motion one to come out.<br/>
Sometimes I would let him vent and then sit together and look up the item online <br/>
and checked<br/>
 for sales, craigslist, freecycle all that together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is it possible for you to talk about your own frustrations with money without getting defensive or diminishing his? That&#39;s something I can do pretty well with Ray, not so well with Mo - that has to do with the ways our personalities rub up against one another. With Mo, I&#39;m better off saying &quot;sorry&quot; in the moment and paying better attention to wish-lists and how the &quot;extra&quot; money gets spent in general. <br/>
