<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168239172">cooper just turned 7 on the 29th.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
an older (teen) friend of his made him a little cake, and gave it to him yesterday. cooper, who delights in sweets, and is beginning to try new things in ways that surprise us, said to his friend, &quot;no, thank you. not right now. i&#39;m still digesting the candy and sweets i ate last night!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i love that he&#39;s able to know what his body needs, and that he&#39;s able to articulate it, with what seems like no baggage, urgency, or shame. what a sweet, sweet gift.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thank you to the voices here that have soothed me over and over and over again in the realm of his food choices, so that i have become a less anxious, more peaceful partner to him. i am endlessly grateful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
love,<br/>
heather</div>
