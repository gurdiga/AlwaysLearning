<div id="ygrps-yiv-310354793">Megan is newly 8 and starting to explore scary things. There are things she is sensitive to that might not seem scary to others (we say &quot;balloon&quot; instead of blood and &quot;butterfly&quot; instead of vomit/puke).<br/>
<br/>
She just started watching scooby doo and doesn&#39;t usually find it scary. she watched an old Sonic cartoon yesterday and it scared her (I was nursing her sister to sleep in another room). <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s getting interested in monsters, especially werewolves. I haven&#39;t had any luck finding any books at the library or the bookstore that are sort of an &quot;encyclopedia of monsters&quot; but isn&#39;t too graphic. Books are my first choice of info, not hers :-) but I also think still pictures might be less intense than a movie.<br/>
<br/>
We tried watching Teen Wolf, but the story didn&#39;t grab her and the wolf effects weren&#39;t wolf-like enough for her. I know there are lots of werewolf movies, but I can&#39;t think of any that won&#39;t be too intense. <br/>
<br/>
I am a big fan of monster movies myself, so I  am excited to share these with her when she&#39;s ready. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had lots of great conversations about how they make movies and how the make up works. I&#39;ve showed some &quot;making of&quot; features on regular movies so she can see the camera and lighting and all the extra people. We&#39;ve talked about different kinds of scary movies - monster movies, &quot;mean people&quot; movies (the slasher/saw type movies), ghost movies etc. We&#39;ve talked about what scares me in a movie and how that jumpy feeling can be kind of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, ok as I am typing this I realize I could show her a werewolf episode from Buffy the Vampire Slayer because it shows the transformation and isn&#39;t too intense.<br/>
<br/>
Any other suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810262393">Hey Gwen,<br/>
<br/>
I think any library worth it&#39;s salt has books like Werewolves (Monster<br/>
Chronicles)&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Werewolves-Monster-Chronicles-Stephen-Krensky/dp/0822566567/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253842759&sr=1-7">http://www.amazon.com/Werewolves-Monster-Chronicles-Stephen-Krensky/dp/0822566567/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1253842759&sr=1-7</a>&gt;.<br/>
The cover is pretty scary looking, in my opinion, but I clicked the &quot;Look<br/>
Inside&quot; feature and the illustrations and text seemed pretty kid-friendly.<br/>
A bit cute-sy, even.  I used to work at our local library and you&#39;d be<br/>
surprised how often our series of monster movies books were checked out, and<br/>
they had to be from the early &#39;70s.  Vampires, The Wolfman, Frankenstein,<br/>
Mummies...all that good stuff!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going through a bit of a monster/paranormal/alien phase here, as<br/>
well.  My 10 year old daughter, Tori, is way into aliens, ghosts and ghost<br/>
hunters, and zombies lately.  She&#39;s also a big gamer, and some of the games<br/>
she plays delve even more into that sort of thing:  Fallout 3, Call of Duty<br/>
World at War (she loves the Nazi Zombie bonus area), and Ghostbusters are a<br/>
couple that she plays regularly on PS3.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to think of other ideas...<br/>

<br/>
Megan doesn&#39;t watch many of the Disney tween/teen shows because she doesn&#39;t like it when the kids aren&#39;t nice to each other.  She really likes iCarly for the silliness, but when Sam gets too mean or cranky, she just turns it off.<br/>

<br/>
Others we have and like: She Wolf of London (1946) The Undying Monster.  (1942)   The Werewolf (1956)  The Curse of the Werewolf (1961)  This one is more spooky and graphic than the 40&#39;s movies. <br/>

Look here for others: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.werewolf-movies.com/database.php">http://www.werewolf-movies.com/database.php</a><br/>
<br/>
The old monster movies are great for little kids.  There&#39;s almost no blood and in a black and white movie blood can sometimes go unnoticed by little kids, there are few if any graphic scenes with the scary stuff happening off camera.  And maybe think about giant monsters.   We have especially loved the Japanese and Korean giant monster movies.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525555704">Billy the Kid vs. Dracula, I think.  I think we saw that on TV late  <br/>
one night in the early 1970&#39;s.<br/>
But in the early 1970&#39;s I was probably stoned, so I might have been  <br/>
mistaken.  I remember the vampire(s?) getting off the stage coach, and  <br/>
turning to dust or something undocumented.<br/>
<br/>
I think there was a glitch about being out in the sunlight or something.<br/>

Thanks, Robyn.<br/>
I hadn&#39;t noticed the sigline.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important for unschoolers to be as accepting and respectful of  <br/>
children as they can be.  Our expectation can be low and derisive, and  <br/>
that&#39;s what&#39;s happening in most of mainstream culture.  It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
help people move toward understanding unschooling.<br/>
