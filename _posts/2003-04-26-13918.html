Deb&#39;s ideas are wonderful, I laughed at every single one, but I have to say <br/>
that BOOGER was my personal favorite, but the twins, most like Holly <br/>
appreciated <br/>
U-FART, their personal favorite past time.<br/>

Good luck, something great will come of this list I&#39;m sure.<br/>

Holly sounds so much like the twins I get a kick out of all the things she <br/>
says. Perhaps we could come up with a group for our children, the offspring <br/>
of us radicals, and they could use the U-FART as their group name. Just a <br/>
thought. Mine are always over my shoulder wanting to hear the latest insights <br/>
into the lives of other Unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Please tell Holly we love her new hairdo. Kass thought it was great but <br/>
would never attempt it because she likes doing a thousand different things, <br/>
curls, braids, buns. etc. and Kree said it was way cool, but she&#39;d go a <br/>
little shorter in the front so she could spike it and she&#39;d like to go with <br/>
hot pink.LOL Daddy is not ready yet, but we&#39;ll get him there.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what we figured years ago about The Goof Group.  Anyone too <br/>
embarrassed to be in a group like that would only drag us down.  And if they <br/>
asked why we would not want a name that reflected more serious hard work... <br/>
ditto.<br/>
<br/>
Holly currently favoring &quot;Play Day,&quot; as her main concern has been something <br/>
the little kids could identify with.   The other prominent group in town at <br/>
the moment is &quot;Tumbleweeds,&quot; and the kids say &quot;We&#39;re going to Tumbleweeds.&quot;   <br/>
That&#39;s long and prickly, though.  &quot;Play day&quot; is soft and happier.  Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
not a great name for a yahoogroup, though.<br/>

There is a Tumbleweed music festival here every Labor Day weekend.  Admission is by donation.  They have folk music and story tellers.

A neighbor converted an old school bus into a &quot;gym&quot; and drives around to preschools for the kids to take classes in his Tumblebus.<br/>

I guess that&#39;s kind of changing the subject though.  Sorry!<br/>
