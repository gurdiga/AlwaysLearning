<h4>Beth Toolan at 2009-07-17 20:01:23 +0300 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041036112">I am sitting in my living room with Kathryn and a bunch of really cool<br/>
unschooled teenagers, thinking about the one tiny green tomato in my garden<br/>
and listening to a conversation about crocheting bathmats accompanied by a<br/>
hummed rendition of �the first row is the hardest�� (hummed to the tune of<br/>
�the first cut is the deepest.�) The house smells like freshly mowed grass<br/>
and waffles, and I am hoping that I will see the foxes that live in the<br/>
cemetery across the road this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this is a typical day in the life of an unschooling parent.<br/>
<br/>
 My name is Beth Toolan. I live in Salem, MA with my wife, Kathryn Baptista,<br/>
our almost 20 year old son, Julian and Sadel, 12, who has shared our lives<br/>
for the past 16 months and will be moving on to new adventures in a few<br/>
weeks. We have unschooled Julian since he was 8.<br/>
<br/>
 I am really looking forward to seeing many of you at the Northeast<br/>
Unschooling Conference this August. Some of my favorite people in the whole<br/>
world will be there � the Lovejoys, the Kreams, the Davis-Pitres, Marji<br/>
Zintz, the Yablonski- Bieglers� and I am so looking forward to reconnecting<br/>
with old friends and making lots of new ones.<br/>
I am especially excited about spending a few hours learning from Rue<br/>
Kream, wife of Jon and parent of Dagny and Rowan, unschooling guru and<br/>
author of the book, �Parenting A Free Child: An Unschooled Life.� Any of you<br/>
who have met Rue, talked with her on the discussion boards, read her book,<br/>
or admired her butt on the book�s front cover will share my awe at her<br/>
gentle, kind wisdom and her unwavering commitment to parenting free children<br/>
and supporting all of us to do so as well.<br/>
<br/>
Friends, laughter, music, a great location just north of Boston, and a<br/>
loving and welcoming community of people who share the unschooling lifestyle<br/>
� I can�t think of a better way to spend the last few days of August.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I hope to see you there!<br/>
