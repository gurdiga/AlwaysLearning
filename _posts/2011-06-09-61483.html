<div id="ygrps-yiv-149042604">A discussion list for SCA (medieval studies club, Society for Creative Anachronism) which usually sits quietly had four new members.  After three, I posted to the group with a subject of &quot;three new members&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
---------------<br/>
A huge influx of members seems to indicate someone is talking about this list behind its back, which is fine.<br/>
<br/>
I created this list in case people wanted to talk about ThinkWell-sorts-of-things, but it&#39;s always been very quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Attempts to start discussions are welcome, but quiet is okay too. If people know of other discussion sites where topics are hoppin&#39;, feel free to share those links as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in England at the moment, because my anchoress status is only keeping me away from the SCA, not keeping me in my house. :-) I&#39;ve been to Scotland and will go to France next week. I&#39;m here for home-ed purposes (what the Brits call homeschooling), and am keeping notes and photos here:<br/>

Someone I don&#39;t know posted this response:<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Please make sure to do something more than the home-schooling activities.  You don&#39;t want to end up like the brick-layer I knew who came back from Europe with a splendid collection of chimney pictures - and no other pictures.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I was amused partly because I&#39;ve posted TONS of chimney pictures and I&#39;m not a brick layer. :-)  But I was not as amused by the &quot;please make sure..&quot; and &quot;You don&#39;t want to end up like...&quot;<br/>
My response was called &quot;Focus, Joy and Unschooling&quot;:<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that means you didn&#39;t actually look at this:<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind being a brick-layer who took pictures of the things he loved most.  Or a boat enthusiast, or horseman, or a fan of trains or automobiles.   Pictures of all kinds of places and things are free to see on the internet.  I can&#39;t keep sharable images of all that I&#39;ve seen, but taking pictures was one of my top three priorities.   Photos, blogging, speaking (honoring my commitments to speak).  Then travelling and meeting people.   <br/>
<br/>
The photos in that blog were taken in the company of, or in the homes of, home-schooling families who are unschoolers.  If that doesn&#39;t mean anything to you, the image you had when you recommended I do &quot;something more than the home-schooling activities&quot; is probably not the image unschoolers have of the world and of learning.  :-)<br/>

It&#39;s interesting to me that someone who is in a club that involves learning and doing difficult things for fun, who additionally joined a discussion list to discuss philosophical aspects of that, is advising me about doing &quot;something more than...&quot; and what pictures to take. :-)   <br/>
