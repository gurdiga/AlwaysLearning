The cheery news is that if every day has some gentle peace and quiet, some laughs and smiles, some food, clean clothes, ideas, play, a little exploration and some connections, life is better.<br/>

There&#39;s a collection of typical days, most of them from several years ago.  They&#39;re little snapshots of a day worth reporting.  If half of your days are worth reporting, that&#39;s a good number. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is always something worth remembering.  I won&#39;t speak for anyone but myself, but I find my children go through highs and lows, and some days are definitely better than others. I like the idea of not thinking of days being &quot;bad&quot; but only moments.<br/>

That helps me.  Sometimes it helps a lot.  It helps me see the little bits of happiness that are always sprinkled through the low days, and maybe even more importantly, it keeps me from hanging on to the little bits of unhappiness that might be sprinkled through an otherwise pretty great day.  I don&#39;t ignore the difficult moments, because often through them I can learn how to do better next time, but I also don&#39;t give them undue weight.<br/>
