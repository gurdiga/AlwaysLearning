 </span></blockquote>When we were driving down to SC last year, we also knew we were then driving <br/>
to Sarasota, FL afterwards, then Julian and Beth were going to drive all the <br/>
way back to MA. (For long complicated reasons involving my dying mother. <br/>
Well...she was dying at the time. She actually DID go through with it. This has <br/>
nothing to do with the story...I am just addled. I remember learning in school <br/>
that Thomas Edison was considered &quot;addled&quot; as a child. And he kind of unschooled, <br/>
ultimately, so I guess there is an unschooling connection.  ANYWAY....)<br/>
<br/>
So we got story tapes from the library. <br/>
<br/>
One of the ones I picked up was George Carlin&#39;s. Julian had never heard him, <br/>
and LOVED it....played it over and over again. It&#39;s fun watching Julian listen <br/>
to something like that that he finds REALLY funny....he just is overcome with <br/>
laughter. It reminds me of those times when he was very little and you could <br/>
do that romping kind of thing which would just fill him with utter joy and <br/>
laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when he wakes up (often around the crack of noon these days) I&#39;ll <br/>
share them with him. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>
