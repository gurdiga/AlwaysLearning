<div id="ygrps-yiv-436873957">There will be some new members coming in this week, because I posted this on Radical Unschooling Info.<br/>

Several have requested membership, following that post, but they need to get through an exchange of e-mails with our bouncer, Joyce Fetteroll, first. :-)  <br/>

And for anyone who is in this Always Learning discussion and might feel a bit overwhelmed, the upper left corner of this page has links to some smooth and easy introductions to radical unschooling<br/>
