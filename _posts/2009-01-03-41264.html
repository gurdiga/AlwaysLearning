<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750897615">This may be a long shot, but maybe someone here might have seen the <br/>
show or remember the group who performed it.<br/>
<br/>
Around 1991, 1992 or 1993 (Can&#39;t remember the exact year but based on <br/>
when I learned the game it had to be around this time) my sister and I <br/>
had learned the cup game where you tap your hands, clap, and tap a cup <br/>
on the table and your hand in a rhythmic fashion, passing it on to the <br/>
next person at the table.<br/>
<br/>
My aunt and cousins saw us playing the game and ended up asking us to <br/>
teach them how to play, as they had seen it done on TV by a group of <br/>
adults who not only tapped the cups but also tossed them into the air, <br/>
catching them again right in rhythm. They wanted to duplicate the game <br/>
to use for a talent show.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would love to see if a video exists of that group of adults <br/>
who were playing the game on a stage, tossing the cups. I don&#39;t know <br/>
who they were, or what they were performing for.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone here happen to see the performance or one similar and have <br/>
information on it?<br/>

actual show with music and the cups being tossed. I&#39;m familiar with <br/>
the game itself, and have seen the talent shows on YouTube, but I just <br/>
wanted to see if anyone would have seen the show I remember from back <br/>
in the 90&#39;s...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if the group was similar to Blue Man Group or had the <br/>
style of STOMP. I love the thinking-outside-of-the-box groups like <br/>
these, and didn&#39;t know if the people I saw were another group, or a <br/>
one-time deal, or what.<br/>
