<div id="ygrps-yiv-351366941">I&#39;m learning to let Mike work things out by himself. Having had a tough week <br/>
of him only wanting to play on the pc or watch tv (ok so it was &#39;educational <br/>

he&#39;s discovered the *other* reason why I sometimes suggest he needs a break. <br/>
As well as my needing to play, ahm work I mean! lol<br/>
 He&#39;s spent the last 2 days with a migrane following an especially long stint <br/>
at the monitor without a break. Just wish he could have learnt without. :-(<br/>
How long it means he moderates his pc use remains  to be seen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002703062">My dd spends all of her time online, or playing video games.  I used <br/>
to stress out so hard about it, until I really started looking at <br/>
what is involved in her play.  Now my only complaint is that she <br/>
slumps badly in her chair at the computer, and that I never have the <br/>
time to get online, unless she&#39;s asleep!  My dd hates this <br/>
arrangement...this &quot;let her do whatever she wants&quot; thing.  But he is <br/>
staying silent for the most part.  Every once in a while he&#39;ll throw <br/>
out &quot;so, have you done anything for &#39;school&#39; lately?&quot;  He still <br/>
doesn&#39;t get unschooling.  But at least he is leaving us alone about <br/>
it.  I think, in time, he will begin to see that all is not lost <br/>
because she isn&#39;t in school.  It&#39;s very hard to break free of that <br/>
schoolish mindset, especially when he is working so much and all he <br/>
sees is that she soesn&#39;t have to do anything that she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
do.  He calls that spoiled.  I call that lucky!  -<br/>

Maybe you can just ask him to change his question to &quot;What have you learned <br/>
lately?&quot;<br/>
and then soon to &quot;What&#39;s new?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;all he <br/>
sees is that she soesn&#39;t have to do anything that she doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
do.  He calls that spoiled.  I call that lucky! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
If and when he&#39;ll read, maybe print and leave this in the bathroom:<br/>

I agree.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that can help with your husband&#39;s attitude is to &quot;spoil&quot; him<br/>
as much as you can in the few hours that he is home.  Especially when<br/>
children are older and less demanding.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Until recently my dh, Darin, wasn&#39;t particularly for or against Unschooling. <br/>
He was very much okay with homeschooling, he just couldn&#39;t quite grasp the <br/>
concept of Unschooling. He was constantly asking the same things your dh is <br/>
asking. He couldn&#39;t understand that they learn and thrive so much more when <br/>
the operative word in their lives is choice. <br/>
<br/>
This went on until his mother, who is very much against hsing, (constantly <br/>
asking me and the kids how our &quot;Little school is doing?&quot;) took the kids out <br/>
for a &quot;Grandma day&quot; and ended up having them tested a few months ago. He <br/>
wasn&#39;t as upset about it as I was, he even said that he would like to know <br/>
how the kids were doing and couldn&#39;t see why I was so upset and frustrated <br/>
about it. He thought it would be a good measure of how Unschooling works. (or <br/>
his words, IF it works) Until I had enough and reminded him that the kids <br/>
weren&#39;t hers to decide things like this for. How this was coming from a woman <br/>
who hauled him all over two states, five husbands, and 16 different schools <br/>
while he was growing up. All because she lost a job or couldn&#39;t pay the rent, <br/>
or found a new boyfriend or husband or the electricity was cut off, or the <br/>
neighbors weren&#39;t right or what ever bee happened to fly up her.... <br/>
<br/>
I have been seeing a gradual change since then. He started telling me things <br/>
like how he learned so much from a certain teacher who had more progressive <br/>
ideas, who took the kids out camping just so they could see what stars look <br/>
like away from the city and canceled math for a month and taught them how to <br/>
cook instead.  And when they went back to the book, they found they knew all <br/>
about fractions...<br/>
He still has some rethinking to work on. But then so do I! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I still hear some offhand comments every now and then. Like last night the <br/>
kids were playing hangman on the chalk board, in the kitchen and Moly had a <br/>
word that started with an Sq and ended in t and Jack couldn&#39;t get it. He kept <br/>
throwing out letters and Moly kept adding to the little man. Darin and I were <br/>
watching a movie and half listening to the kids when Jack called out for help <br/>
and Darin said &quot;its probably spelling ALA Moly.&quot; So Moly brought the board in <br/>
and I looked at the word and all the wrong guesses and asked her if the word <br/>
was Squirt. And she did have it spelled right, Jack just didn&#39;t know the rule <br/>
of u after q and now he does. So Jack learned that and Darin learned Moly can <br/>
spell. I would say he learned tact, but that remains to be seen. &lt;eg&gt; <br/>
