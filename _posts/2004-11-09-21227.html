<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034632819">Hi Ya,<br/>
<br/>
My Brother-in-law has be accused and arrested last week and my sister wants to keep the little kids, hers 7, and 4 from ever ever knowing. I have been asked to help by taking her kids for a few days and by being in on the story they come up with. I have 2 problems.  My husband has already decided the brother-in-law isn&#39;t worth any more trouble and does not want to help by letting the kids come here. He feels other people closer to them should take the burden. They have lots of extended family. Our home is small and they have been very critical of our lifestyle lately. The second problem is even bigger, because I feel I can not lie. I feel very strongly against it. I can handle telling their story in the short term, but what if this person winds up in jail for over a year. My sister has been advised by &quot;experts&quot; that it is ok not to tell the kids, ever ever, that their dad is in jail, that they can not handle this kind of info.  I have 3 kids 10,7,4. My sister thinks they will have too much conflict of love and hate towards their uncle.<br/>
<br/>
I really am looking for a direction here, from people I trust to help sort out what to do. Any support groups anyone knows of?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146050500">oh wow, your integrity is so much more important than keeping a secret <br/>
from being revealed... lies are terrible, once they exist you must deal <br/>
with having them, it will be the elephant in the middle of the room... <br/>
my family, the one I am born into, they have lots of secrets and lies, <br/>
and it has been a mess trying to figure out truth from it all... I wish <br/>
I knew what happened just the way it really occurred, no more stories, <br/>
but there is no way to force the truth out of a liar... so I see you <br/>
are at the beginning of a potential family secret, you could be the <br/>
only one who will ever tell the truth about it, you may keep your <br/>
integrity unlike the others...<br/>

<br/>
Mary, I&#39;m sorry this has happened to your family. I would suggest that your<br/>
focus first has to be your own children and dh, then your sister&#39;s kids, and<br/>
your sister. Perhaps if dh can look at it from the pov of helping the kids<br/>
rather than the BIL, that might make it easier for all of you. <br/>
<br/>
I would never advise lying to children, but finding ways to tell them bad<br/>
news gently, and without exaggeration or focusing on details, unless they<br/>
ask. Maybe along the lines of their uncle has made a mistake, and is taking<br/>
responsibility for it and making amends to society. I hope you can suggest<br/>
to your dh that he refrain from being vocally critical in the kids&#39;<br/>
presence.<br/>
<br/>
Children always know that something is not right. The risk is that they<br/>
might sense they are being lied to and come to some erroneous alternative<br/>
conclusion, like Daddy left because of something they did wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually the truth will come out, it almost always does. The children, who<br/>
may even be adults when that happens, will immediately have cause to wonder<br/>
what else they were lied to about. They may be relieved, because finally the<br/>
mystery of why everyone was so tense and strange during that period has been<br/>
cleared up. <br/>
<br/>
They may feel anger at the experts. When I was 5 I was sent to a boarding<br/>
school, while my mother went to Indonesia to work. It was explained that<br/>
civil unrest was making this a dangerous place for children (boy did I worry<br/>
about Mum!). What I never understood was why my grandparents, who lived<br/>
nearby, never came to see me, or take me out on the weekends like many other<br/>
kids. Loneliness. Unloved. I still remember the first time I tied my own<br/>
shoe lace. It was one of those empty Saturdays, and I was in the playground.<br/>
I had no-one I could show. In the last 10 years I finally talked to my<br/>
mother about it. It turns out some &quot;experts&quot; told them it would make it<br/>
worse for me if they visited. I&#39;m still ready to scream at those asshole<br/>
experts, and I&#39;m so sad for that little girl that I was. I&#39;m 43.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your sister is choosing you as a better caregiver than the<br/>
extended family of her husband. If they as a group advocate lying to<br/>
children, that may be one reason why, even if she has not articulated that<br/>
to herself. If you tell her that you don&#39;t agree with the lying plan, she<br/>
may make an alternative choice.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

A few days, what could it hurt?    How much closer can you  be with your <br/>
sister&#39;s children than anyone else?  They can go to the  grandparents after <br/>
they&#39;ve been with you.<br/>
 <br/>
If she&#39;s not going to tell them, that&#39;s her business.  You shouldn&#39;t  tell <br/>
them, either.  Let them come to your house for a &quot;vacation&quot;.   They don&#39;t have <br/>
to know right away they&#39;re leaving town because there&#39;s a  scandal brewing.  <br/>
Maybe you can offer them some peace and calm that they&#39;re  not getting from mom <br/>
at home right now.<br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;ll know eventually, and I think she should tell them, but I don&#39;t  think <br/>
you should.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d like to know what he&#39;s accused of, because it could change my  answer.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
But it&#39;s not the aunt&#39;s responsibility to tell the kids.  It&#39;s the  parent&#39;s. <br/>
 And the aunt doesn&#39;t have to lie to them.  She just has to  omit any <br/>
conversation about it.  <br/>
 <br/>
If the aunt can&#39;t be cheerful and peaceful and calm knowing the secret,  then <br/>
she shoudn&#39;t be around the kids until they know.  If she can put it  out of <br/>
her mind for a few days, in the best interest of the children, knowing  that <br/>
she&#39;s made it clear to her sister that she doesn&#39;t agree, and that the kids  <br/>
should know, then I think that&#39;s best.  Then she should see how it all  shakes <br/>
out.  I think it will become obvious that the kids know something is  up, and <br/>
they will have to be told something.  I believe it&#39;s going to  become more <br/>
obvious to the mother that the kids should be told, too.  <br/>

<br/>
Too damned bad.<br/>
If you lie, they will think worse of the uncle AND of you, when they learn <br/>
the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Guard your relationship with your own children and let your brother in law <br/>
suffer all the real consequences of his actions.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you tell your sister you&#39;re going to tell your kids the truth and if <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want hers to know she needs to keep them away from your kids, who <br/>
are too young to be trusted with that secret.  That will easily get you off <br/>
the hook for childcare.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be really cold, but it&#39;s bad enough for someone to screw up his own <br/>
family  [I&#39;m thinking of my mom&#39;s second husband, of my mom in general, of their <br/>
son (my half brother) and of several other people...] but if you agree to any <br/>
of that, he&#39;s screwing up your family too.  And you would be helping him do <br/>
so.<br/>

 <br/>
Oh, I didn&#39;t mean she shouldn&#39;t tell her own children.  I think the  story <br/>
doesn&#39;t have be told right away, and that the aunt&#39;s kids can come and  stay for <br/>
a few days while there&#39;s tension in the air at their house.   Choosing the <br/>
right time to tell something is not the same as lying.  I  don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
lying to have the kids around and then just not talk about  it.  <br/>
 <br/>
The aunt is clearly ashamed of what her husband did (if he did it).   She&#39;d <br/>
probably like to believe that he didn&#39;t do it, but she doesn&#39;t, or she  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be afraid of what the kids will think.  If she thought he was  innocent, <br/>
she&#39;d be screaming that to the rooftops, and it wouldn&#39;t matter to her  what the <br/>
kids thought.  <br/>
 <br/>
I definitely think all the kids should be told, and it would be a most  <br/>
useful example if they were told by the accused person.  Maybe a little  lesson in <br/>
obvious remorse or righteous indignation of the falsely accused would  do some <br/>
good for the kids.<br/>

jail?  Keep him that long, I&#39;m not bailing him out.&quot;  My kids now know that<br/>
if you drink and drive you could end up in jail and you have a mom who will<br/>
make sure you spend some quality time there.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And after that maybe a wife!<br/>
You might&#39;ve scared them straight for life.<br/>
<br/>
So much better than teaching them, by example, to lie.<br/>
