  I wonder if somebody who is familiar with this game can help....my 7 yo boy is interested....can you rate the game for me?  It looks like a lot of fun, but I wonder if it&#39;s a bit complicated for his age.<br/>
  TIA!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298268715">We love heroscape!!  My boys are 10 and 7...it can be pretty complicated trying to play completely by the rules.  So what we started out with was modifiying the easier instructions to fit our needs.  And sometimes the boys make up their own rules.  It is cool and you can certainly do what you need with it to make it fun for your son and your family.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

Richard is 10, he got interested in Heroscape more than a year ago.  He <br/>
actually showed me how to play!  You can simplify the rules though, and <br/>
the pieces are fun even if you just play your own way.  There are some <br/>
really cool pieces, dragons, vikings, zombie dogs, American Revolution <br/>
soldiers, robots, something for everyone.<br/>

It looks pretty extensive and gives a good feel for the game.<br/>
