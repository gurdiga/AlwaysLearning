<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053964965">I found an old notebook of mine, full of shopping lists and reminders, notes <br/>
from a lecture about math at a homeschooling conference, notes from RCIA <br/>
classes and a journal entry all about my son Will, when he was 4-1/2:<br/>
<br/>
6/9/98<br/>
Today Will said that when people die, they become wind.  &quot;All of them?&quot; I <br/>
asked.  &quot;No. Just sixty.&quot;<br/>
He spent the day watching TV and playing with his toys.  We went to the <br/>
library and read a few books.  Then he picked out two Little Bear books to take <br/>
home.  He wanted to know why we borrow books (I guess instead of buying them).  I <br/>
told him we couldn&#39;t afford that many books.  Then we parked the van down the <br/>
street and walked back to the farmer&#39;s market.  [The library will tow your <br/>
car if you leave it in their lot and go to the farmer&#39;s market, and they watch <br/>
for it, too.]  <br/>
He picked up a pink tomato and asked what it was.  He saw blackberries and <br/>
blueberries and talked me into buying some.  He saw some kohlrabi and pointed <br/>
them out to me.  The vendor offered me a taste.  It was good.  Will didn&#39;t want <br/>
to try it.  He tried a blackberry and didn&#39;t really like it.  He ate the whole <br/>
thing, though.<br/>
<br/>
We browsed some more at the market, he fondling a different tomato at each <br/>
stand and pointing out squash to me.  He saw watermelons and we agreed we <br/>
shouldn&#39;t buy a big one for just the 2 of us.<br/>
At the last stand he picked out 2 peaches and I picked out some butter baker <br/>
potatoes.  I promised him we would make a blueberry cobbler with lots of <br/>
sugar.<br/>
We took our treasures and walked back toward the van.  We saw a trolley and <br/>
decided to take a ride.  We rode the whole circuit for 25 cents, Will making <br/>
eyes with a group of old ladies that got on midway through.<br/>
On the way home, he played with the calculator in the van.  He punched in 22 <br/>
and said, &quot;Look mom!  Too-ty-two!&quot;  I figure when he can read &quot;twenty&quot;, he&#39;ll <br/>
figure it out.  <br/>
We went home and read the Little Bear books.  I made the cobbler with too <br/>
much dough and it spilled over onto the oven floor, but it was delicious just the <br/>
same.  Will particularly like the almost-burnt crust (that he called &quot;crush&quot;) <br/>
on the outside of the pan.<br/>
He begged me to take him to the &quot;two parks&quot; and we finally did.  <br/>
<br/>
Addenda, 9/22/03<br/>
I read this to Will.  He smiled and laughed.  He said &quot;I remember skipping <br/>
12.&quot;  &quot;Oh yeah?&quot; I said.  And he said, &quot;I&#39;d go, &#39;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, <br/>
11, 13&#39; and you&#39;d say, &#39;POOR 12!&#39;&quot;<br/>
Then he got up and walked back to the living room.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just LOVED this whole post!  Particularly this line.  My Julia was reading <br/>
number to me one night off bingo balls, mostly reading right to left on the <br/>
ones she wasn&#39;t too familiar with (she&#39;s since figured this out).  She said <br/>
&quot;oh-ty two&quot; for 20.  <br/>
<br/>
Today we are all sick but the two kids had a birthday party for Nemo (we <br/>
haven&#39;t seen the movie, but somehow ended up with a toy), attended by a whole host <br/>
of animals.  They had a &quot;pi-yan-ta&quot; for Nemo, all the other animals were <br/>
whacking it with cuisinaire rods, waiting for the corn syrup city candy to fall <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta love kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609896507">Sandra, and others,<br/>
<br/>
I met this wonder 11 year old (just barely) this week, at a homeschool <br/>
camp.  She is not yet reading.  The young lady is worried herself now <br/>
and wants to know why she hasn&#39;t learned to read, so I spent some time <br/>
with her, upon request from her and her mom.  I spoke a bit about Holly <br/>
and others who have read &quot;late&quot; and she felt MUCH better.  She was <br/>
wondering if Holly might be willing to email/chat with her.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, any words of wisdom?  The young lady would like me to check to <br/>
see if there is a reason she hasn&#39;t learned to read.  I have suggested <br/>
they go see an opthomologist, just to check things out a bit.  And I&#39;ll <br/>
do some evaluation on her, just light things, to see if I see anything <br/>
interesting and to give them some ideas, ways to help her learn, as she <br/>
is really wanting to learn now and frustrated.  The mom is GREAT, and is <br/>
willing to let it happen, it&#39;s really the child who is wanting things to <br/>
move and to learn to read....<br/>

<br/>
I bet she would.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to send her the copy of &quot;Teach your Child to Read...&quot; if that <br/>
will make her feel better.  The word lists are cool. The method is bizarre so we <br/>
ignored that and Holly just played with the word lists a few times.  But maybe <br/>
she and her mom would even understand and desire to deal with the book&#39;s <br/>
method of weird word-markings in blue.<br/>

Holly&#39;s IM is AstaHD<br/>
