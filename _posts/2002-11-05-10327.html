&lt;&lt;  I did a Sesame<br/>
Street bit once too, when I worked at the zoo as a<br/>
teen and I was talking about snakes and showing some<br/>
to some kids.  My sister saw it and called to tease me<br/>
about it, but I wanted to know why she was watching<br/>
Seasame Street before they had any kids... :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  Do you have a tape of it?<br/>
