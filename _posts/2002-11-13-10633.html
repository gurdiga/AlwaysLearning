<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430633055">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Shirley, this whole topic about your daughter has brought lots of thoughts to<br/>
my mind. My oldest, 8 now, has an ability to take all of my energy. She has a<br/>
cup which no matter how much I fill with love, still always seems empty to<br/>
her. I can spend all day and night with her engaged and she still needs more.<br/>
I have 2 other kids, 6 and 3 now who I feel for because Ashley needs so much. <br/>
<br/>
I too have wondered is there something else going on. So far I feel she is<br/>
thriving and I have not gone to any specialists. She has her deal about<br/>
clothing. Only inside out satin these days. Only 1 pair of sandals. She has<br/>
had these traits off and on her whole life. She wears a bathing suit for<br/>
underclothes and sleeps naked. She is obsessed to me with how clothes feel.<br/>
She finds problems not solutions. I&#39;m learning not to react. Sandra showed me<br/>
how to continue loving her. I hold this 75 lb baby and sing her songs I did in<br/>
the sling. I even brought her sling out and wrap her in it. I tell her about<br/>
her baby self and have made memory pages for her for her own books. She can be<br/>
very unlovable during a clothing tantrum. She yells alot too, over simple<br/>
things. Big frustrations. <br/>
<br/>
The other night I had all three asleep after a day at the beach. Ashley woke<br/>
and was very needy. I was very needy too. After 1 1/2 hours driving I wanted<br/>
time to be with myself and hubby. I was feeling icky having a tantrumy kid<br/>
when I expected 3 kids asleep and time with Tim. I asked Tim to join us and we<br/>
both sat with Ashley. Her feet were not right, too dry she said. So there we<br/>
were, all three of us, Ashley with her feet in a bucket of water at 10pm.<br/>
Something Tim said got her mood switched and we had a few giggles and instead<br/>
of whimpering Ashley waking the babies, she went off to sleep alone. I also<br/>
got to have Tim with me while dealing with an unpleasant childen. Very<br/>
supportive and I&#39;m going to try this same angle again.<br/>
<br/>
 I so get tired of parenting alone waiting to be with Tim. I have had to pull<br/>
him in, let him know I like being with him with the kids. Still romantic, like<br/>
a date in public. The loving feelings can flow. He connects with the child and<br/>
with me. I can not believe how easy we get into 1 parent with the children, 1<br/>
parent getting time to do chores, personal stuff.<br/>
<br/>
On the side, Ashley got her ears pierced yesterday. Thank you all from her<br/>
because now her mom listens instead of controls mostly.<br/>

I&#39;m not dealing with the same spread of complaints, but I do get the<br/>
foot thing.  Sometimes my son needs a cold wash cloth wiped across his<br/>
feet at bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to work &quot;better&quot; if I get it for him, rather than him fetching<br/>
it and wetting it himself.<br/>

Ooh, I&#39;m interested in this. My sensitive child wants to get his ear pierced <br/>
and I&#39;m concerned that he will hate the feeling. How&#39;s she doing?<br/>

<br/>
Holly has clothes-stuff, but usually just taking out all the tags does it.  <br/>
Sometimes we have to go into the seam to get the last bits of tag out and I <br/>
re-close the seams.<br/>
<br/>
I take the tags out of my clothes, too, but Holly&#39;s more sensitive than I am.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had her ears pierced but they never did really stabilize.  She did wear <br/>
a lot of earrings for a while, and loved doing it, but they were nearly <br/>
always partly infected.  Mine do the same.  I&#39;ve about given up entirely <br/>
since my husband doesn&#39;t like pierced ears anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not fun to feel your clothes on you everywhere and know right where <br/>
there&#39;s a little sticker, or too stiff, or needed more fabric softener, or <br/>
whatever.  And I suppose for kids who feel all those things as threat or pain <br/>
must have a hard time thinking of much else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a son like this too!  All cotton, all the time.  He can feel elastic, <br/>
the seams in his socks, the fly in some underwear.  Only Hanna Andersson will <br/>
do for this kid, in terms of pjs and undies.  He&#39;s never sleep otherwise.  <br/>
And as we get almost all their other clothes from consignment sales at local <br/>
schools (see, I support the parent teacher councils!), we can justify the <br/>
expense.  <br/>
<br/>
Skin sensitivities are torture for a child.  We&#39;ve found a natural soap with <br/>
no perfumes, fabric softener with no scent, aveeno oatmeal baths, perfume <br/>
free cleaners for the rest of the house, etc.  It&#39;s helped immensely, but we <br/>
still have our issues.  <br/>
<br/>
We also snuggle every night and sing the songs they heard as babies.  Have <br/>
you read the relevant pages from The Spirited Child?  Parts of that book <br/>
really helped me.  Mostly, though I had to surrender to our differences and <br/>
embrace him for the child he is.  What I mean is that my son hasn&#39;t changed <br/>
much in terms of his sensitivities and needs, but I have altered my attitude.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962563630">I had this problem for years and years.  I gave up wearing earrings for<br/>
several years, but then got the bug to try again.  I started cleaning my<br/>
earrings with Bactine every day.  I think I finally got them to heal, and<br/>
they don&#39;t hurt any more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sensitive child got his ear pierced this summer.  He&#39;s 18, though.  ;)  I <br/>
thought he would never do something like that, because he&#39;s, well, sensitive. <br/>
 But he volunteered to be the first victim for a friend of his who had just <br/>
gotten a job at Claire&#39;s at the mall.  He said he didn&#39;t like it, but he <br/>
survived.  He has since stopped wearing the earring, because the hole got <br/>
infected, and so closed up as well. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a loud clicking noise and a little pain that doesn&#39;t last very long.  <br/>
Then my ear got a little hot.  Also, it&#39;s kind of nerve-wracking because most <br/>
folks are very protective of others touching their ears.  I know Will would <br/>
never like the part about the person&#39;s hand next to his ear, and the noise <br/>
the piercing gun makes.  He did walk around for a while with a ring-like part <br/>
of a necklace pinched onto his earlobe, which surprised me.  (Surprised his <br/>
grandmother, too, since it looked real!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say take him in and let him watch someone else, first.<br/>
