<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781291549">My girls are five and seven. This week they&#39;ve been<br/>
spending a LOT of time watching and dancing to the<br/>
Wiggles, watching a show called Mickey Mouse<br/>
Clubhouse, and playing MMC games on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised. Isn&#39;t the target audience three and<br/>
four year olds? Should I be introducing them to more<br/>
things that are &quot;age-appropriate&quot;? Why aren&#39;t they<br/>
bored watching such basic stuff at their age?<br/>
<br/>
But it was so obvious that they were REALLY enjoying<br/>
it (as opposed to just watching it because there were<br/>
no other good choices), that I quickly stopped<br/>
worrying about it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was just curious if anyone had something<br/>
interesting comments or observations on that kind of<br/>
thing. <br/>
<br/>
For example, would a schooled seven year old typically<br/>
like The Wiggles, or would they be afraid other kids<br/>
would make fun of them? Is it easier for unschooled<br/>
kids to like things &quot;intended&quot; for younger kids?<br/>
<br/>
For that matter, is it easier for unschooled kids to<br/>
like things &quot;intended&quot; for older kids?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, my daughter is 9 and two of her favorite things are  &quot;the sims&quot; and<br/>
all its variations for the PC and a computer chat room called &quot;IMVU&quot;, both<br/>
which are<br/>
designed for 13 and up.<br/>
<br/>
When she first asked for The Sims, I didn&#39;t really listen (oops!) because it<br/>
was for older kids.<br/>
She must have been 8 at the time.  She didn&#39;t even read much so I assumed it<br/>
would be<br/>
difficult & frustrating for her.  She kept insisting she really wanted it.<br/>
I finally listened.<br/>
Ha!  She LOVES the game & does amazing things with it.<br/>
She found IMVU on her own & asked my permission to sign up.  She&#39;s learned<br/>
all sorts of reading & spelling<br/>
just by online chatting.  She&#39;s often asking me &quot;mom, how do you spell...?&quot;<br/>
and then I tell her.<br/>
And she remembers, because she is having fun and having real conversations<br/>
with people.<br/>
I signed up, too, with my own avatar & sometimes we&#39;ll chat with each other<br/>
from our separate computers &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 12 and his favorite Xbox game is Halo 3.  Rated mature.<br/>
I think it often that unschooled kids have PERMISSION to like things for<br/>
what they are, without regard for &quot;suggested age limits&quot;.<br/>
Some of my sons friends LIKE Halo, but aren&#39;t allowed to actually play it,<br/>
even when they come stay with us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think yes to both.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 and 11yo were watching Barney the other day.  It&#39;s been a while <br/>
since I&#39;ve heard that voice and those songs.  Maybe it was a little <br/>
nostalgic for them.  I still love Sesame Street.  I love the humor.<br/>
My kids play dress up and pretend and all kinds of things that school <br/>
kids would probably not consider cool.  <br/>
My 11yo and his 13 yo old friend (homeschooler) discuss polictics, <br/>
world peace, the environment, science, animal rights....  They made <br/>
picket signs that said &quot;honk for peace&quot; and &quot;save our planet&quot; and stood <br/>
out in front of our house yesterday trying to get cars to honk.   I was <br/>
not involved at all.  I didn&#39;t even know they were doing it until I <br/>
noticed cars honking more than usual and looked out front.<br/>
My 17yo who did end up going to high school, still plays with Barbies.  <br/>
Mostly giving them make overs now, but she would not care a bit if <br/>
anyone knew.  She probably tells people about it.  She does some pretty <br/>
amazing stuff with them.<br/>
That&#39;s one of the really cool things about unschooling.  Nothing is off <br/>
limits.  No age segregation.  <br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For that matter, is it easier for unschooled kids to like things  <br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
But not really because they&#39;re unschooled.  There are unschooled kids  <br/>
who have been shunted and shamed away from liking TV or sheets with  <br/>
cartoon characters or &quot;junk food&quot; or emo kids or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
What makes it possible for a human of any age to be discerning about  <br/>
what he or she likes without fear or prejudice is for the people  <br/>
around them to encourage them without teasing them or asking those  <br/>
leading questions that are really criticism in bad disguise.<br/>

<br/>
Holly (nearly 16 and a half) bought a Barbie the other day.  She  <br/>
drove herself, used her own money, and brought home an America&#39;s Next  <br/>
Top Model Barbie.  She and I talked for quite a while about the  <br/>
features (limited poses, but some good ones, and removable panties!!)  <br/>
and the eye makeup and the hair, and which things she owns that would  <br/>
fit it.<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a Poison Ivy doll (some comic-book super hero kind of  <br/>
character or villain, I don&#39;t know), and the clothes will fit the new  <br/>
doll.  The Poison Ivy doll is being Bree Vandecamp (sp?) from  <br/>
Desperate Housewives now.  Holly has dedicated barbies to be  <br/>
characters/action figures in various scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some accounts and info on Holly&#39;s Barbie scenes and Jayn  <br/>
Coburn&#39;s:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112231415">Hi,<br/>
My daughter is 7 and my son has just turned 4.  They often tune into<br/>
the wiggles together and enjoy a good sing-a-long.  we went to their<br/>
concert last year and dd danced and sang along.  my daughter also<br/>
enjoys watching &quot;cbeebies&quot; (intended for pre-schoolers).  My children<br/>
have never been to nursery or school and therefore have no concept of<br/>
what &quot;is cool or not cool&quot; for children their age.  Also to note dd<br/>
has 2 friends down the road who go to school (10 and 5) and they<br/>
practically live here after school and weekends.  The 10 year old<br/>
joins in quite happily with dress-up games and playing schools and<br/>
dolls.  I just wonder if her friends at school know about this....?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797553227">&quot;I still love Sesame Street.  I love the humor.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved getting to watch all the Disney movies (and some of the other good ones too) <br/>
with my kids.  It&#39;s my guilty pleasure.  And I even liked Barney--shhhh, don&#39;t tell!<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed watching Saturday morning cartoons (we didn&#39;t have cable) until I was at least <br/>
15.  And the X-mas specials--don&#39;t get me started!  I think it kinda&#39; ruined it for me when <br/>
they went to videotape and they could be watched any ole&#39; time...<br/>
<br/>
My kids watch all kinds of stuff for all ages.  One of the games my daughter (9) likes to <br/>
play with her grandparents is that magnetic fishing game.  They just told me that today, <br/>
with a laugh about how that game is for three to seven year olds.  They didn&#39;t seem to, but <br/>
I get it--sometimes it&#39;s fun to do something that&#39;s easy.  I don&#39;t always want a challenge <br/>
either.  I like to play games that are simple and repetitive sometimes, and so does she.  <br/>
Just for fun.  And my MIL said that dd could always beat them because her reactions are <br/>
faster than theirs.<br/>
<br/>
We were at our videogame day yesterday.  We have a great community that&#39;s been <br/>
together awhile, so kids are really comfortable.  There were kids from 4 to 13, and <br/>
everyone mixed, everyone played.  It was more about personalities than ages--which feels <br/>
so much more natural to me.  There was considerable time when one of the 13 year olds <br/>
was happily playing with the four year old.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend that was two or three years older than me--I might have been 11 or 12 and <br/>
she was 14 or 15.  It was in a community group rather than school, and we really <br/>
connected after a long time for either of us not connecting with anyone.  It made my <br/>
mother so uncomfortable for me to have a friend that was older (and she was a really <br/>
&quot;nice&quot; girl--no trouble in sight) that she made me end the friendship.  That was very sad <br/>
for me.<br/>
