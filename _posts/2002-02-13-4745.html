&gt; I have essays (most of them are hooked to a website, so maybe that was a <br/>
&gt; bad <br/>
&gt; idea &lt;g&gt;)  and there were subject chats on AOL that I could review to steal <br/>
&gt; my best ideas (back from me).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d hate to charge people for what I&#39;m already doing free.  Books are <br/>
&gt; different because there&#39;s a physical thing to keep, that you can read in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; bed, or in the bathroom, or at a park or in the car waiting for someone.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, what if you compiled the essays, etc. into a good book form, and had <br/>
it published through iuniverse?  I bet you&#39;d sell a bunch of copies (You <br/>
could call it an Unbook, since they publish on demand),  but it might be a <br/>
way of getting in print without having to market to a publisher, etc.  My <br/>
best friend just did a book with them and was quite happy with it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d certainly buy a copy. <br/>
