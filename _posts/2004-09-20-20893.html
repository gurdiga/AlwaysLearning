really  don&#39;t want to go through it again.<br/>
Does anyone here know where the last  discussion on TCS (Taking Children <br/>
Seriously) and NCP (non-coercive  parenting) was?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I couldn&#39;t find the last discussion but here is something to get you  started:<br/>
 <br/>
TCS web site:   _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/_">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/)">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/)</a>     On the web page you can also get to their e mail <br/>
list.  It is, like Sandra  said, a list that talks in hypotheticals and <br/>
discusses theory etc.  You are  discouraged from talking about specific people or <br/>
families.<br/>
 <br/>
Here is another site that talks about NCP:  <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.autonomouschild.co.uk/_">http://www.autonomouschild.co.uk/_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.autonomouschild.co.uk/)">http://www.autonomouschild.co.uk/)</a>    It is Jan Fortune Wood&#39;s site and <br/>
has her writings about consensual living  etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are a couple of yahoo lists that you might be interested  in:  <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EmpoweredChildhood/_">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EmpoweredChildhood/_</a> <br/>

 <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Common-Preference-Parenting/_">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Common-Preference-Parenting/_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Common-Preference-Parenting/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Common-Preference-Parenting/)</a>  <br/>
 <br/>
Hope that helps get you pointed in the right direction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Pam, those are great references.  But, I wasn&#39;t really asking about<br/>
what TCS or NCP are, and I don&#39;t really want to discuss them either.  I was<br/>
just curious about Sandra&#39;s comment with respect to the entry point into<br/>
the relationship.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think attachment parenting and seeing the child and parent as a team isn&#39;t <br/>
the same as what I understand of TCS in which the child is seen more as a <br/>
separate individual entirely.  They become separate, but I don&#39;t think they start <br/>
separate.<br/>
<br/>
And two sins in the TCS world seem not to be sins in the attachment <br/>
parenting/unschooling world, and those are persuasion and compromise.<br/>
<br/>
I think TCS is more idea/theory based than human/emotion based, and that <br/>
seems to be a problem to me.<br/>

phrase.  It actually made me think of the idea that we can get there (to a<br/>
great relationship with our kids) in different ways -- but I don&#39;t think<br/>
that&#39;s what you meant by it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
I think attachment parenting leads to parents who want to help their children <br/>
make their own choices and get their way as much as reasonably and politely <br/>
possible in the world.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the other just says they have a  natural-born RIGHT to have their <br/>
way, and &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;polite&quot; are unnecessary considerations.   I could be <br/>
wrong about that, but every time I think I want to look again, some new thing <br/>
offends my *delicate sensibilities.* &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the results and the family relationships that come of out what <br/>
some callmindful parenting, which seems maybe a later entry into attachment <br/>
parenting (or maybe they&#39;re both part of some other thing I don&#39;t know the name <br/>
of) are more naturally organic (in the &quot;grew that way gradually and <br/>
naturally&quot;) sense than a socio-political overlay that demands no coercion because of <br/>
something about coercion itself, or no compromise because of something about <br/>
compromise.<br/>
