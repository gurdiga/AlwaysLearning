<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254953833">Just wanted to share something about our newly liberated days. I  suppose I <br/>
noticed what was happening all the more clearly because the  message below <br/>
dropped into my inbox:<br/>
 <br/>
-=- [writer on a UK based list]....but reading is far better for children&#39;s <br/>
 cognitive development than watching TV or playing computer games! You <br/>
develop  your imagination when reading whereas the screen does everything for <br/>
you so not  much in the way of brain function going on while you watch!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It made me laugh to think of using a computer as passive unimaginative  <br/>
entertainment, especially because of what I&#39;ve watched Jess do this week.  <br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s been ill with tonsillitis, so we&#39;ve missed the short spasm of  <br/>
glorious weather that will probably count for our English summer.  To  keep <br/>
herself amused, she spent a fair old time lazing on the sofa with  her laptop.   <br/>
She decided to sample the sounds of words  generated by HalReader, a <br/>
text-to-voice processor.  She then modulated  and tuned the outputs to different <br/>
pitches, and slotted them  into rhythmic patterns on an audio multitracking <br/>
programme to make her  own music (quite funky, if you could imagine Kraftwerk <br/>
with a vaguely Latin  beat).   I just loved watching this creativity unfold  <br/>
... and  then that message popped up on my PC.  I realized that if you don&#39;t <br/>
 look closely at this kind of thing all you see is some zombie kid gazing  <br/>
hypnotically at a screen.  What a shame.  And what a buzz it is to be  <br/>
learning to participate more and  observe more closely!<br/>
 <br/>
Incidentally, I&#39;d like to add my voice to all the others who think Holly&#39;s  <br/>
video is FABULOUS!  (And, as far as I&#39;d always understood, the convention  <br/>
of talking to an interviewer slightly offline from the camera was developed  <br/>
because most viewers find too much direct-to-camera eye contact  <br/>
overpowering.)  ... So confident, so intelligent, so at ease in  herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170614291">By the way, I realized I didn&#39;t express something too clearly in  my <br/>
earlier post:  a quick clarification.  When I referred to &quot;zombie  kids staring at <br/>
a screen&quot; - I didn&#39;t mean to say I believe there&#39;s any such  thing. Nor was <br/>
I suggesting any hierarchy of active to  inactive screen time.   I was just <br/>
trying to work out how anyone  would think there&#39;s no imagination in <br/>
screen-based activities.  <br/>
