<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546512409">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am a married wahm.  My boys are 2 and almost 6.<br/>
We unschool and love it.  I&#39;m very glad to have run across<br/>
this group who also loves John Holt and his work.<br/>
I don&#39;t have much support or know many families locally<br/>
who understand our way of doing things.  So, I&#39;m looking<br/>
forward to meeting some other folks who I can relate to<br/>
and  vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
I am also an artist and Spiritual Life Coach.  I work out of<br/>
my home so I can be with and play with and learn with my<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Kelly Jo Murphy<br/>
