<div id="ygrps-yiv-798296114">The first quote is from an e-mail I got today, and then there&#39;s my  <br/>
response, and then my comments to this group.<br/>
------------------------------------------------<br/>
-=-till it was unschooling-it was just so much pleasure.<br/>
when schooling slowly creeped - the tension n friction also creeped  <br/>
in!--<br/>
<br/>
There you have it of your own discovery.  It&#39;s not &quot;school,&quot; it&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;schooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think a school without a curriculum is better than a homeschool with  <br/>
lessons at the kitchen table.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I have said this before, but I want to say it large and clearly.  It  <br/>
seems time.<br/>
<br/>
One reason I&#39;m not anti-school is that school has potential.  There  <br/>
are alternative schools.  Some kids do better in school than at home  <br/>
because they clash with their parents, but can manage to get along  <br/>
great with some of the teachers or the other students or both.<br/>
<br/>
I care more about emotional safety than I do about unschooling.<br/>
I see unschooling as a fast track to emotional safety and healing, so  <br/>
I help people unschool,<br/>
but I&#39;m not doing that because I hate school.  I don&#39;t hate school.<br/>
<br/>
If I were in charge of eliminating options in the world (somehow,  <br/>
magically, or in an emergency situation; fantasy/hypotheticals here),  <br/>
the first to go would be fundamentalist Christian punitive  <br/>
homeschoolers who feed their kids a pack of Bible-based reconstructed  <br/>
(speaking of fantasy) nonsense, and tell them God told them to  <br/>
homeschool so that the United States can be returned to its theocratic  <br/>
roots, and that the devil is living and working through mainstream  <br/>
science, magazines, television, public schools and humanist  <br/>
unschoolers.    I&#39;m just barely joking here.  I&#39;m smiling, but every  <br/>
word is real.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s not the school building and the bus and the cafeteria and  <br/>
the books that are harmful.  It&#39;s certainly not the music program or  <br/>
the well-stocked art room or the theatre department with working stage  <br/>
amenities.   It&#39;s not the school library.  It&#39;s the shaming and force- <br/>
marching through reading chapters and answering questions without  <br/>
talking.  It&#39;s being pressed to read one book while another more  <br/>
interesting book is to lie untouched.   It&#39;s memorizing and reciting  <br/>
things that aren&#39;t even true, and being punished for questioning them.<br/>
<br/>
Those bad parts of schooling are worse with school-at-home families  <br/>
than they are in school.  At least with school one could conceivably  <br/>
file a complaint or the parents could ask for a meeting with the  <br/>
principal or counsellor or teacher.  With Christian school at home,  <br/>
all appeals have been cut off by &quot;honor thy father and thy mother,&quot;  <br/>
who claim to be doing the direct will of God.  That&#39;s that.   If you  <br/>
argue, you too are working with and by the devil who creates reality  <br/>
shows and R-rated movies.  (I pretty much like school better than I  <br/>
like reality shows, too, to remain clear here.  If they would call  <br/>
them game shows instead of &quot;reality,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t bristle so much.)<br/>
<br/>
Because what I care about is children having options and parents being  <br/>
supportive and compassionate, I was able to write<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
which got me removed as an unpaid columnist for a California  <br/>
homeschooling newsletter years ago.<br/>
There are those among unschoolers and homeschoolers whose primary  <br/>
focus is politics rather than family.  I don&#39;t really want to support  <br/>
them, either.   They assume all homeschoolers hate the government and  <br/>
want schools to be dismantled.   I think schools should be there for  <br/>
when those families&#39; kids can&#39;t stand the parents paying more  <br/>
attention to political diatribe than their own children.<br/>
<br/>
Schooling isn&#39;t as good as natural learning.<br/>
There&#39;s my summary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I find most interesting with Chamille, who&#39;s never been to school,<br/>
is that her main concerns with potentially going to school, are all<br/>
social.  She&#39;s not so sure she wants to be around that many strangers<br/>
all day.  She&#39;s not sure she wants to be around adults who assume it&#39;s<br/>
their job to tell her what to do.  She&#39;s not sure that she can follow<br/>
all the school rules and still be true to herself and her principles.<br/>
<br/>
The homework, the seat work, the &quot;education&quot; that happens at school are<br/>
all things that she has no problem with whatsoever.  She says, she might<br/>
find some of it tedious, but not nearly as bothersome as being forced<br/>
into social situations with people she doesn&#39;t want to be around.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s the shaming and force-<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; marching through reading chapters and answering questions without<br/>

&gt; things that aren&#39;t even true, and being punished for questioning them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly my issue with school too.  It&#39;s the clear lack of<br/>
choices and the hand picked ideas presented as absolutes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are those among unschoolers and homeschoolers whose primary<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The whole reason I started homeschooling to begin with, was all about<br/>
politics!  As I went along, though, it became more about learning and<br/>
relationships.  I was able to let go of the political part of it, mostly<br/>
because, once it stopped having a hold on our lives, it ceased to be a<br/>
problem for me.  When I made the choice to homeschool, it was a choice<br/>
to NOT send her to school, and over the years it&#39;s become more about how<br/>
awesome it is to be at home doing fun and interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
I do have my political beliefs about compulsory schooling and<br/>
homeschooling laws and such, and I do write my lawmakers, and have gone<br/>
to the state capitol to support homeschool freedom bills, but it&#39;s a<br/>
very very small part of my life, and one that doesn&#39;t really overflow<br/>
into the lives of my children.  If they were interested in politics that<br/>
might be a cool thing to share with them.  Chamille did write a letter<br/>
once to a politician about GMO foods.  She&#39;d seen me write letters to<br/>
politicians before, so she knew it could be done and she felt pretty<br/>
strongly about it, so she wrote it and sent it.  That is the absolute<br/>
extent of her political interest thus far, except for various updates on<br/>
issues that she really cares about, which I relay to her as I hear about<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I come from a family that was waaaay into political discourse, so that&#39;s<br/>
a little hard to shake from the way I view the world.  When I visit<br/>
family, that is a core subject that is discussed, anything political is<br/>
fair game.  The second big topic is art and music, so at least it&#39;s a<br/>
little balanced, even if politics enter into discussion of art and<br/>
music.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
  that is exactly what the biggest problems were for my kids when in school - and for me too.<br/>
<br/>
  i was a &quot;good&quot; student but the pain associated with the peer relationships in school was the biggest issue for me in school - and for my daughter.  for my son, who is more introverted, being around people all day at all was too much forr him - and make it people to whom he is not attached or connected, and the compulsory elements of the education part of school, and it was just a recipe for misery for him.  <br/>
<br/>
  but the social stuff alone is enough to make school a really negative environment for lots of kids, learning (or not learning) aside.<br/>
<br/>
  for the social reasons, i personally would *not* prefer an alternative school with no curriculum over a curriculum at the dining table...i  just don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy emotionally for young kids to be in that setting with so many other peers and unconnected adults.  i know there are exceptions - schools that do manage to create really cohesive, trusted communities - but my kids were never in any standard school and still none of the schools they experienced managed to realize their goals for community and connection.<br/>

After your children didn&#39;t want to do any more school work at the  <br/>
table, they might rather be anywhere than home, including a setting  <br/>
with many peers and unconnected adults.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not healthy emotionally for children to be told what to do (and  <br/>
when and how) about something as senseless as phonics worksheets or  <br/>
multiplication drills or the kid-version-history of something two  <br/>
thousand miles away when they might live in a town that&#39;s older and  <br/>
cooler than whatever the state wants them to pass a test about.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not healthy emotionally for children not to have access to other  <br/>
adults if they might like to.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s no recourse to what the parents are trying to make kids do,  <br/>
it&#39;s not anything remotely like unschooling.<br/>

  yes of course i agree with that - especially if they hadn&#39;t experienced school and it was in contrast to that scenario at home.  and to be clear - we *don&#39;t* do schoolwork at the table!!  (or anywhere else!)  i still think the emotional pain from the social issues at school may last longer/be more profound for some kids than the emotional pain from disturbed/destroyed natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
  i do agree that if the school at home scenario is severe enough to impede kids access to other adults and offer no recourse, then that sounds pretty harmful as well. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The pain from family issues will most likely be worse. I get personal <br/>
phone calls and emails from people who are having awful times with <br/>
homeschooling. These aren&#39;t from happy unschoolers, they are from <br/>
miserable parents who can&#39;t understand why their children don&#39;t just &quot;go <br/>
along&quot; with the schooling the parents are imposing. The kids resist - <br/>
they resist actively (and are punished repeatedly), but they more often <br/>
resist by &quot;dragging their feet.&quot; One mom told me, &quot;I&#39;ve cut back and cut <br/>
back the amount of work I ask of her. I&#39;m down to asking her to do two <br/>
math problems per day. She could do them in about 5 minutes, at most. I <br/>
know she knows how to do them. But she&#39;ll sit at the table and cry for <br/>
two hours before she finally does them (in about 2 minutes).&quot;  THIS is <br/>
far worse than anything most children will experience in school just <br/>
because it IS the mother imposing it. Mothers should not be in the <br/>
position of torturing their own children. Children should not be in the <br/>
position of being tortured by their own (loving) mothers.<br/>

<br/>
No kid can cry for two hours in a math class; it only lasts 55 minutes  <br/>
or less.<br/>
Any kid who has had something to cry about should be able to go to her  <br/>
mother for comfort and sympathy.<br/>

If the pain from social issues at school had primarily to do with  <br/>
children having no choice about being in school, then let&#39;s look at  <br/>
that:  a child was in a place without an option.<br/>
