<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627554115"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think the whole unschooling thing comes from<br/>
&gt;respecting the child as much as an adult would be<br/>
&gt;respected.  When folks say they &#39;unschool&#39;, but they<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t grant that kid as much respect as they would <br/>
&gt;their best friend, it irks me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the general lack of respect that people have for<br/>
children, treating them like property, which irks me,<br/>
totally apart from education of any nature.  I don&#39;t<br/>
like to see one type of human being treated as<br/>
mindless chattel to another type of human being; ie:<br/>
kids and adults.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...it&#39;s the blinders folks seem to have when it comes<br/>
&gt;to respecting kids that bugs me the most.  <br/>
&gt;Heidi<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ditto Heidi.  Kids and minors (because let&#39;s face it,<br/>
not all minors are kids, and I know some who are much<br/>
more mature than adults I know many times their age)<br/>
are the last massively abused minority.  <br/>
