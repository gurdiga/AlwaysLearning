I want to point out that the moms pushing ships through the fence weren&#39;t giving them potato chips (American style / Brit=&quot;crisps&quot;), but a large portion of nice fried/steamed potatoes.  <br/>
<br/>
The term &quot;junk food&quot; should NOT include hamburgers, either.  It started off to be Twinkies and other things that were heavily preservatives, and unnatural.   Hamburgers are &quot;fast food.&quot;  Or they were, before the whole thing got jumbled into a wall of noise.<br/>
<br/>
I like this article, except for the way-broad use of &quot;junk food.&quot;  But it wasn&#39;t written in the U.S. and that matters too.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Council estates&quot; are low-income apartment houses (in American usage, I think; can&#39;t speak for other places).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722719194">I was born in 1962 and the term &quot;White Trash&quot; has been around for at least since I was a child growing up in Southern Illinois (Southern Illinois is different regionally than the rest of IL  - it is not Mid-West it is Southern).<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have a McDonalds in our town until after I&#39;d left for college, so after 1980.  Wal-Mart went in around that time too.  K-mart went in in the next town over.  But we had 2 or 3 fast food burger drive-ins even without McDonalds.  We had a Dairy Queen that was open during the warm months - they served ice-cream treats.  There were several diners - the food was probably just as greasy and high calorie.  At some point a Kentucky Fried Chicken and a couple of pizza places also went in.  In other words there were lots of options to eat out for the community, none of which would be considered healthy by today&#39;s standards.<br/>
<br/>
No one was condescending towards the burger eating people - it was just a nice treat to eat out.<br/>
<br/>
Of course a lot of people today would blanch at the way we used to cook too.  When I moved to Colorado in 1983 I had a very hard time with the food being so different.    <br/>

(but so we don&#39;t fall into the white trash heaven forbid category, the ice-cream was homemade, and the chip were trans fat free) phew!</div>
