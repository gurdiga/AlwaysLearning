It has to do with 7-Up commercials.   Here&#39;s more (and some of the ads):<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036499920">I was a child then, and I really liked those Uncola commercials with<br/>
Geoffrey Holder.  &quot;These are Uncola nuts.&quot;  He seemed so joyous, confident<br/>
and peaceful, sitting back, relaxed, enjoying his clean, fresh lifestyle,<br/>
away from the rat race.  I remember feeling connected to that idea at the<br/>
time, and procured myself one of those upside down looking Uncola glasses,<br/>
even though I wasn&#39;t particularly crazy about 7-Up itself as a drink.  I<br/>
just connected with the sort of &quot;third party,&quot; not-Coke/not-Pepsi idea.<br/>
 Something about the clearness of 7-Up too felt right to me.<br/>
Another phrase I like, much more recent, is the Taco Bell &quot;Think outside the<br/>
bun.&quot;  I think that&#39;s a brilliant ad campaign, because the phrase is<br/>
sooutside the box, that it doesn&#39;t even use the word or image &quot;box.&quot;<br/>

It seems like to me that the closing down of the unschooling stuff at AOL<br/>
and the deletion of stuff might have inspired the website.  Regardless of<br/>
the reason, I&#39;m glad there&#39;s sandradodd.com.<br/>

Well thanks!  Those were parallel things.  I used to have a personal  <br/>
page on expage.com that was about unschooling, and I started  <br/>
collecting my articles online after they were published, and it just  <br/>
grew because I&#39;m a packrat and I love to collect funny or interesting  <br/>
or beautiful things, and othr unschoolers kept producing funny,  <br/>
interesting and beautiful writing!<br/>

<br/>
In the late 1970s when I was living in Sydney and a lemon drink<br/>
called Solo was first introduced to the market, there was an ad along<br/>
the same lines, presumably borrowed from the 7-Up idea. Not using the<br/>
term &quot;uncola&quot; but making a comparison between the juiciness of fruit<br/>
and the dryness of cola nuts.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t find an example of that, but this is the kind of advertising<br/>
they moved onto:<br/>

Quite humorous I think! Very Australian.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my daughter and I playing a videogame based on 7-Up&#39;s red<br/>
dot character in the mid 90s, on the Sega Megadrive. Cool Spot. At<br/>
that time, 7-Up&#39;s slogan was &quot;It&#39;s cool to be clear&quot;. That was in the UK.<br/>
