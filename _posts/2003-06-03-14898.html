<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530890991">Down below here are quotes from an article about benefits of tea.  What <br/>
amuses me is the whole pseudo-science of what they mean to DO with this knowledge.  <br/>
(Oh.   One quote I didn&#39;t bring was about making capsules with the active <br/>
ingredients in tea.)   Why not &quot;drink tea&quot;?  NO no no, they wouldn&#39;t know how <br/>
many milligrams you ingested, and they couldn&#39;t reformulate all all the <br/>
toothstuff.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra (quotes from here on)<br/>

<br/>
In the &quot;bad breath&quot; study, researchers combined black tea extracts with three <br/>
species of bacteria (all linked with bad breath) in petri dishes for 48 <br/>
hours. They compared the results with bacteria that sat alone. <br/>
<br/>
In all cases, tea polyphenols inhibited the growth of bacteria by 30% and <br/>
reduced the production of compounds that cause bad breath. <br/>
<br/>
The study suggests that rinsing with black tea keeps plaque from forming and <br/>
destroys acids that cause tooth decay. <br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the same study suggests that green tea boosts the effectiveness of <br/>
toothpaste and mouthwash in fighting viruses. Toothpaste and mouthwash had very <br/>
little virus-fighting effect when mixed with bacteria; however, when green <br/>
tea extract was added, 99% to 100% of the bacteria disappeared. What&#39;s <br/>
responsible for the health benefits of tea? Teas contain polyphenols, which are <br/>
antioxidants that protect human cells from damage. Flavonids are a group of <br/>
polyphenols that occur naturally in tea. It is suspected that high levels of these <br/>
polyphenols in the body can fight viruses as well as cancer, including pancreas, <br/>
colon, bladder, prostate, and breast cancer.  <br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
Both studies detailing health benefits of tea were presented at the annual <br/>
American Society for Microbiology General Meeting held in Washington, D.C., this <br/>
week.   <br/>
