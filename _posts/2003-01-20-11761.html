 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s always been one of my favorites!  Another is still pinned to my<br/>
bulletin board, in which Calvin and Hobbes find a snake and wonder all sorts<br/>
of things about it.  Hobbes suggests getting a book at the library to find<br/>
out the answers, saying &quot;We&#39;ll be experts!  We&#39;ll learn all there is to<br/>
know!&quot;  Calvin screeches to a halt, saying &quot;Hey, wait a minute!  It&#39;s<br/>
summer!  I&#39;m on vacation!  I don&#39;t want to *learn* anything!&quot;  Hobbes calmly<br/>
replies, &quot;If nobody makes you do it, it counts as fun.&quot;  In the last frame,<br/>
the two are lying on the grass with a book open before them, saying<br/>
&quot;Cooooool!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hobbes is so wise.<br/>
