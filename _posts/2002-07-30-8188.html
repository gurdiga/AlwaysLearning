<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454370127">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Ellen and have been unschooling for about 6.5 years now since we took our <br/>
son out of school in the middle of first grade.  We did try school-at-home <br/>
for about 6 weeks or so... It was miserable! I read some unschooling books <br/>
(by Holt) and magazines (GWS) and talked to unschoolers and it began to sink <br/>
in little by little. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are boys ages 13 and 10 and a dd age 4.5 yrs.  We just moved to TX <br/>
but are from MA (me) and ME (dh).  So TX is very different and hot!   But a <br/>
good place to homeschool - no reporting!  We are Christians which makes it <br/>
interesting as most Christian hsers I know just don&#39;t get unschooling &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
Sometimes I just avoid the &quot;u&quot; word and say we are &#39;really relaxed&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
Great list!  I&#39;ve enjoyed Sandra&#39;s thoughts (and others) for a long time now, <br/>
from years ago on aol even.<br/>

&quot;It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of <br/>
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>
of freedom.&quot;<br/>
