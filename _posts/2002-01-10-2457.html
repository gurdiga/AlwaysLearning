<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774347401">MMMmmmmm.......I&#39;m drooling just thinking of crumpets with lemon curds.<br/>
I have a good recipe for lemon curds, it saves a bundle over buying it.<br/>
And I remember making crumpets when I was in 4-H, with washed out tuna cans <br/>
that had both sides cut out. Yes, you can make a crumpet ring out of a tuna <br/>
can!!!<br/>
How&#39;s that for money saving?<br/>
As to the recipe? I&#39;d hafta ask Mom.<br/>
