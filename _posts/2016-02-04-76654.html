Pro';font-size:14px;">&quot;It is truly awesome to experience our kids learning. Reading and swimming (two activities that many folks believe must be taught) arose spontaneously, easily, with joyful confidence.” &nbsp;(Tori)</div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">which made me think about the&nbsp;difference for me between reading and swimming: It’s been straightforward for me not to have an agenda about reading, while&nbsp;occasionally pushing a bit for swimming&nbsp;(which my 7 year old is absolutely not&nbsp;interested in!):&nbsp;“Are you sure you don’t want to join this great class?” or &quot;Are you really sure you don’t want daddy, or me, to show you?” And I’ve told him how he can not only save his own life, but also save other people (or animals.) Of course I realize it’s because of the security issue in swimming, as we are in LA and some of our friends have pools, and I feel like I’ll be able to relax when my children know how to&nbsp;swim. My daughter (at 1 1/2 year old) and I&nbsp;were&nbsp;both sitting by a pool, fully dressed in winter clothes, when she decided to dive in. I jumped in and got her at the bottom (but somehow my mind took the time to have me say“shit!” before I jumped in, as my son later&nbsp;pointed out!), I took her out, she nursed a bit and was totally&nbsp;fine. I happened really fast and I was so glad I was&nbsp;literally *right there*. Which of course I want to be with a&nbsp;non-swimming child near a pool.</div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">But anyway I thought it was interesting how when there’s security involved - possibly life - it’s harder not to be impatient :-) I want to treat swimming like other things one can chose to learn one day - or not. I know adults who never chose to learn to swim, and I need&nbsp;to live with the fact that my son may never choose to learn to&nbsp;swim. I wasn’t given the option, as a child.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">Now I can hear some voices (outside from the Unschooling, Mindful Parenting world) say,&nbsp;“A good&nbsp;thing you weren’t, it was for your own good, it’s an important life-saving skill!” &nbsp;I guess they will choose whether they want this important life-saving skill to be a part of their toolkit. Yes, it’s easier to learn to&nbsp;swim as a child, but you can learn at any age.</div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;"><br></div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">Any thoughts?</div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">Thanks,</div><p><span></span></p><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">Clara</div><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-1602071746yui-cursor"></span></p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591826182">-=-And I’ve told him how he can not only save his own life, but also save other people (or animals.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
CPR saves lives!  Driving can save lives—being able to rescue people (or animals) and take them to hospitals (or vets).<br/>
Reading can save lives.  You could read “danger,” or instructions.  <br/>
Being able to build fires and shelters can save lives.  Boy scouts used to learn to do those wilderness survival things.  Maybe not so much anymore (or maybe so).<br/>
<br/>
I can’t swim.<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll’s husband learned just a few years ago, because he wanted to participate in triathlons.  He could bike and run already, so he learned to swim, in his 50’s, I think.<br/>
<br/>
It won’t be good if he feels he’s endangering the lives of other people and animals by not wanting to take swimming classes.  But I think you’ve missed the point, about swimming and reading.  Would you teach math and let science “be unschooled”?  Would you teach reading and figure kids will pick up history?  It’s another one of those things.  <br/>
<br/>
Of my three kids, Holly swims best and she learned informally.  Kirby and Marty took lessons.  Marty’s better than Kirby.  Kirby didn’t really want the lessons.<br/>
We live in the desert.  Not so many pools, either, but some.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-298968543"><p dir="ltr">Look up intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation. Learning something boring because of extrinsic reasons is hard and you&#39;re likely to damage your relationship with him and future learning if you push it. Go to swimming pools for fun. Have fun in pools. Swimming will come or it won&#39;t. If you push it, he may learn but he also may hate it forever and never do enough of it too actually be of any use in an emergency anyway. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Re. Sandra&#39;s point about other things that save lives that only some people can do. I&#39;m a nurse. I&#39;d be pretty useful if I came across an accident. More useful and possibly life-savingly useful than any non-medical people present, even first-aiders. First-aiders know what to do in theory but probably have never done it in real life. They&#39;re not as familiar as I am with equipment and unlikely to be as quick as I would be at assessing the situation and they&#39;re likely to be very scared. I&#39;ve seen trained first aiders freeze when their training is eventually required making them as useless as if they&#39;d not been trained.  A swimmer who never swims could well do the same if they saw someone fall in a pond who need rescuing. </p>
<p dir="ltr">So go to pools a lot but only for fun. Confidence and enjoyment in the water is what you want...unless you&#39;ve already harmed that by pushing lessons. What about going with friends? </p>

<br/>
“Are you sure you don’t want to join this great reading class?”<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you really sure you don’t want daddy, or me, to show you how to read?”<br/>
<br/>
If those were the only opportunities to learn to read, how well would that work?<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to read while unschooling because they&#39;re immersed in opportunities. The printed word is everywhere. Their favorite things (like video games) may have words they need to recognize in order to play. They&#39;re being read to. Other types of stories (TV, movies, audio books) are all around them.<br/>
<br/>
To learn to swim kids need easy, casual experiences with a pool.<br/>
<br/>
Growing up we had a small free standing pool. It was only 2 feet deep and 10 feet across. It wasn&#39;t enough to really swim but enough to get used to floating, trying out strokes, opening my eyes underwater all while playing and trying all sorts of things out. Not all were directly connected to swimming. We played games so some was social. We played with water and what bodies can do in water so some was science. <br/>
<br/>
When I was 6 we bought a cabin at a small resort in the mountains where they had a pool we could use on the weekends. That&#39;s where I got to expand on my paddling about with some bigger personal challenges to tackle. I would watch others for new ideas and to see how they did things. My strokes improved. My underwater swimming improved. I figured out how to jump off the side, dive off the side, eventually got brave enough to use the diving board.<br/>
<br/>
It was all very casual, never any lessons, and I&#39;m a good enough swimmer that no one needs to worry about me around a pool ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I learned because I was having fun playing in the pool. Right now you&#39;re treating learning to swim as something to soothe your fears. Why would that be incentive for your son to learn to swim?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116078372">We have a small above ground pool, about 3ft deep and 14 foot across.  My girls learned to swim by playing in it, splashing about, having fun. They played as mermaids and liked to pick up stones from the bottom. No encouragement from me needed, certainly no lessons.  I did once show them a short youtube video of someone swimming strokes.   <br/>
<br/>
When we went on holiday last year to a resort where there was a &#39;proper&#39; pool they seemed to be moving through the water and keeping afloat just as well as anyone else.  Not the smooth recognisable strokes that we think of as &#39;swimming&#39;, but they were safe, confident and secure, even when the wave machine was on :)<br/>
<br/>
I was a very strong swimmer when I was younger and also did lifesaving courses, etc.  I still recall swimming lessons with a vague sense of dread, though.<br/>

I just shared the info with him. When I say pushed, it’s been asking a 3-4 times over the years if he wanted to learn it, and feeling like I was&nbsp;interested in his answer being yes, but it’s been very light. I don’t think he feels bad at all about not being interested in it! But yes, wow, reading&nbsp;can save lives, pretty much any skill could potentially save lives and that’s not a reason to push them.</div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;"><br></div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">-=- Both my kids learned the way I did!

I don’t know why it seems to me like&nbsp;it’s such a difficult thing to learn by oneself. Possibly because I had to take classes and be pressured to go past my limits and tricked etc ! (My mom,&nbsp;in order to “prove to me” that I could swim, convinced me to swim with only one arm thing, and while I was swimming, took the air out. Yes - she&nbsp;was right, I didn’t drown. And I see where she was coming from, she was trying to empower me. But I remember feeling so betrayed.)</div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;"><br></div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;">-=-Would you teach math and let science “be unschooled”?

Which is why all I‘m doing about this swimming thing is work on myself about my fears related to non-swimmers and pools! It’s incredible how fast people drown - and&nbsp;how silent it is. In some stories, the parents were really close to the pool and didn’t notice anything. Once on a trip my mom almost drowned in a giant wave and a helicopter came to rescue her. Once I got in trouble in waves and surfers checked me out from a distance, almost having to come and get me out. We’re both excellent swimmers, and could very well have drowned.<div><br>&quot;Would you teach reading and figure kids will pick up history?” Some people I know do :-) Though of course they aren’t saying they’re Unschooling. This reminds me of a&nbsp;lovely mother of 6 children I met in the UK, at HES FES (the Home&nbsp;Educators Summer Festival.) Her children were aged 3 weeks old to 12 when I met her. She told me that she felt like she had to teach&nbsp;them reading, writing and basic maths so that they could be fully autonomous. She said that having so many children, she felt like it was&nbsp;important for them to be able to seek the information by themselves, and that when you can read, nothing can stop you from learning and you can do it by yourself. So she said&nbsp;she wasn’t technically doing “Autonomous Learning” (one of the UK terms for Unschooling), though she felt like she was empowering her kids to&nbsp;be really autonomous. (She was also talking about how she’d noticed that before the age the 6, it was so easy for them to learn to read, whereas&nbsp;after 6 they started to be self-conscious and it became more difficult.)<br><br><div>She also shared about how confusing the fine line between Autonomous Learning and neglectful parenting can be. She said, when do you know you&#39;re doing autonomous learning and you’re not neglecting your kids? She said sometimes parents thought they&nbsp;were doing Autonomous Learning and they were just leaving their kids abandoned to themselves.<br>Which I think is something Pam describes in the dangers of using the term Child-Led Learning, which can lead to misinterpretations.<br>https://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/<br><br>The last paragraph is : &quot;Calling it “child-led learning” gives&nbsp;the wrong impression.

My girls learned to swim by playing in it, splashing about, having fun. They played as mermaids and liked to pick up stones from the bottom. No encouragement from me needed, certainly no lessons.  I did once show them a short youtube video of someone swimming strokes.   <br>
<br>
When we went on holiday last year to a resort where there was a &#39;proper&#39; pool they seemed to be moving through the water and keeping afloat just as well as anyone else.  Not the smooth recognisable strokes that we think of as &#39;swimming&#39;, but they were safe, confident and secure, even when the wave machine was on :)<br>

I was a very strong swimmer when I was younger and also did lifesaving courses, etc.  I still recall swimming lessons with a vague sense of dread, though.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263917494">-=- She told me that she felt like she had to teach them reading, writing and basic maths so that they could be fully autonomous. . . .So she said she wasn’t technically doing “Autonomous Learning” (one of the UK terms for Unschooling), -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please divorce those two things in your head.  “Autonomous Education” is a term, it’s true, but it’s not the same as unschooling.  <br/>
“Autonomy” from the government is one aspect.  “Autonomous learning” as you’ve used it above is neither of those.<br/>
<br/>
So for the purposes of this discussion, please don’t try to meld and mesh all the things you’ve ever heard together and expect us to comment on it or help untangle or clarify it.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s just look at radical unschooling as discussed her.  It will be easier.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I see where she was coming from, she was trying to empower me. But I remember feeling so betrayed.-=-<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/issues">http://sandradodd.com/issues</a><br/>
When parents have personal issues that are affecting their parenting, unschooling itself might help them, as they review what they think and remember, and why, and how they might need to let go of it to parent their own children better.  Unschooling can be healing, for parents if they can see it clearly enough.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/issues">http://sandradodd.com/issues</a> might help.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She also shared about how confusing the fine line between Autonomous Learning and neglectful parenting can be.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Let’s not talk about what that mom, with a different philosophy thought or said, please.  Let’s talk about the positives of radical unschooling.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a> has many useful links.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I’d like to be sure I’m understanding what Pam means. <br/>
So: First, while we parents are obviously not saying “Let’s do math now”, we can still have, for example, fun math related games available and offer to play with them (accepting the idea that a particular child might never be interested in a specific game.) I guess the way I understand it, in a nutshell, it mostly that there is math everywhere, and that life is constantly offering opportunities to be doing math at all times while living (cooking, shopping, playing games, planning stuff), and also that you can offer suggestions - while at the same time having no agenda - which again is a fine line, because if you’re looking at getting change at the shop like an opportunity to be doing math when the child hasn’t asked anything, that’s can be a bit pushy and it is having an agenda. But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths”.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your questions are very schoolish and basic.<br/>
Instead of us answering those questions, which takes all the readers the wrong direction, please re-read what Pam wrote—not in a read-fast school way, not read and be prepared to summarize and answer questions (or ask questions).  The kind of reading that helps, with the links people leave here, is different.  It should involve thinking of your relationship with your child, as you read, and internalizing ideas and principles.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849724513"><p dir="ltr">&quot; I don’t think he feels bad at all about not being interested in it!&quot;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot; And I see where she was coming from, she was trying to empower me. But I remember feeling so betrayed&quot;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whatever our children say, we don&#39;t really know how they feel about something we&#39;ve said, done or even feel or fear. They may not even be aware that they feel something in response to our stuff - it may be entirely subconscious for them. They may only realise many, many years later that they felt a certain way and that that influenced them from then on. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I thought I wasn&#39;t creative and didn&#39;t like art for the first 30 years of my life. It wasn&#39;t until I had an experience with an art teacher and my own children that I realised that an art teacher of mine sparked those feelings by &#39;improving&#39; on my artwork for me. She thought she was being kind. In fact, without me really understanding the feelings or being aware of them at the time, she was telling me my art wasn&#39;t good enough. </p>
<p dir="ltr">So don&#39;t assume you know how your words affect your children and definitely watch out for using that assumption to assuage any feelings of guilt you may subconsciously harbour. I&#39;m not having a go at you, just trying to make you be more aware of your words. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I wonder if your mum had any idea you felt betrayed by her helping you learn to swim the way she did...? Just something to think about. </p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot; Once on a trip my mom almost drowned in a giant wave and a helicopter came to rescue her. Once I got in trouble in waves and surfers checked me out from a distance, almost having to come and get me out. We’re both excellent swimmers, and could very well have drowned&quot;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sounds like it would be better to have conversations about safety around water when you&#39;re going to be near the sea or whatever. Adults who are excellent and experienced swimmers drown when they don&#39;t make sensible decisions. Your son will be safer if he&#39;s unschooled because unschooling, by it&#39;s nature, fosters critical, clear thinking in all members of the family. </p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot; So she said she wasn’t technically doing “Autonomous Learning” (one of the UK terms for Unschooling&quot;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&#39;m in the UK. I used to do autonomous learning thinking it was the same thing by another name. I was wrong - it isn&#39;t the same.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot; also that you can offer suggestions - while at the same time having no agenda - which again is a fine line, because if you’re looking at getting change at the shop like an opportunity to be doing math when the child hasn’t asked anything, that’s can be a bit pushy and it is having an agenda. But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot; She also shared about how confusing the fine line between Autonomous Learning and neglectful parenting can be.&quot;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When you understand unschooling, you&#39;ll realise that these are not a fine lines at all. </p>
<p dir="ltr">&quot; But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you really understood unschooling, you&#39;d see that this sentence isn&#39;t true at all. If I answer my child&#39;s questions about money, I&#39;m not doing maths with them without saying the word &#39;maths&#39;, I&#39;m simply answering her questions. If a colleague asked me to explain to her how to do a drug calculation, I wouldn&#39;t think I was doing maths with her, I would think I was showing her how to do a drugs calculation. It&#39;s no different with my children. </p>
<p dir="ltr">(Sometimes unschoolers will talk in those terms to explain to those new to the concept how children learn these things without schooling. But they&#39;re not actually thinking about their children&#39;s lives and learning in those terms)</p>
<p dir="ltr">And uschooling is the very opposite of neglectful parenting and those who think it is anything like it or close to it are totally misunderstanding it. Some people misunderstand unschooling and do it wrong and end up neglecting their children, but that&#39;s because they&#39;re not taking the time to learn about unschooling properly. They&#39;re reading a couple of things about it, thinking it sounds cool and that they get it and then stepping back and letting their kids do their own thing, expecting them to learn everything from social norms to advanced calculus by magic. Sometimes they come to realise things have become chaotic, blame unschooling (instead of their flawed understanding) and suddenly enforce loads of rules and lessons, which confuses and messes up the children even more. </p>
<p dir="ltr">So listen to Sandra. It is so, so important to put the work into really understanding unschooling and into moving slowly. Go back to Pam Larrichia&#39;s introductory emails and read her books. Start from scratch so your unschooling foundation is more solid. </p>

They may not even be aware that they feel something in response to our stuff - it may be entirely subconscious for them. They may only realise many, many years later that they felt a certain way and that that influenced them from then on.</p><p dir="ltr">I thought I wasn&#39;t creative and didn&#39;t like art for the first 30 years of my life. It wasn&#39;t until I had an experience with an art teacher and my own children that I realised that an art teacher of mine sparked those feelings by &#39;improving&#39; on my artwork for me. She thought she was being kind. In fact, without me really understanding the feelings or being aware of them at the time, she was telling me my art wasn&#39;t good enough.</p><p dir="ltr">So don&#39;t assume you know how your words affect your children and definitely watch out for using that assumption to assuage any feelings of guilt you may subconsciously harbour. I&#39;m not having a go at you, just trying to make you be more aware of your words.</p><p dir="ltr">I wonder if your mum had any idea you felt betrayed by her helping you learn to swim the way she did...? Just something to think about.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot; Once on a trip my mom almost drowned in a giant wave and a helicopter came to rescue her. Once I got in trouble in waves and surfers checked me out from a distance, almost having to come and get me out. We’re both excellent swimmers, and could very well have drowned&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">Sounds like it would be better to have conversations about safety around water when you&#39;re going to be near the sea or whatever. Adults who are excellent and experienced swimmers drown when they don&#39;t make sensible decisions. Your son will be safer if he&#39;s unschooled because unschooling, by it&#39;s nature, fosters critical, clear thinking in all members of the family.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot; So she said she wasn’t technically doing “Autonomous Learning” (one of the UK terms for Unschooling&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">I&#39;m in the UK. I used to do autonomous learning thinking it was the same thing by another name. I was wrong - it isn&#39;t the same.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot; also that you can offer suggestions - while at the same time having no agenda - which again is a fine line, because if you’re looking at getting change at the shop like an opportunity to be doing math when the child hasn’t asked anything, that’s can be a bit pushy and it is having an agenda. But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">&quot; She also shared about how confusing the fine line between Autonomous Learning and neglectful parenting can be.&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">When you understand unschooling, you&#39;ll realise that these are not a fine lines at all.</p><p dir="ltr">&quot; But just answering questions is doing maths, without calling it “doing maths&quot;</p><p dir="ltr">If you really understood unschooling, you&#39;d see that this sentence isn&#39;t true at all. If I answer my child&#39;s questions about money, I&#39;m not doing maths with them without saying the word &#39;maths&#39;, I&#39;m simply answering her questions. If a colleague asked me to explain to her how to do a drug calculation, I wouldn&#39;t think I was doing maths with her, I would think I was showing her how to do a drugs calculation. It&#39;s no different with my children.</p><p dir="ltr">(Sometimes unschoolers will talk in those terms to explain to those new to the concept how children learn these things without schooling. But they&#39;re not actually thinking about their children&#39;s lives and learning in those terms)</p><p dir="ltr">And uschooling is the very opposite of neglectful parenting and those who think it is anything like it or close to it are totally misunderstanding it. Some people misunderstand unschooling and do it wrong and end up neglecting their children, but that&#39;s because they&#39;re not taking the time to learn about unschooling properly. They&#39;re reading a couple of things about it, thinking it sounds cool and that they get it and then stepping back and letting their kids do their own thing, expecting them to learn everything from social norms to advanced calculus by magic. Sometimes they come to realise things have become chaotic, blame unschooling (instead of their flawed understanding) and suddenly enforce loads of rules and lessons, which confuses and messes up the children even more.</p><p dir="ltr">So listen to Sandra. It is so, so important to put the work into really understanding unschooling and into moving slowly. Go back to Pam Larrichia&#39;s introductory emails and read her books. Start from scratch so your unschooling foundation is more solid.</p><p dir="ltr">Clare</p></div></div></div>

<br/>
Things that are in public are public. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If I didn’t want people to see it and share it, I wouldn’t have put it in a webpage google can find so easily. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=- (Prof Alan Thomas from London University, Institute of Education, has written about it saying its just different words for the same thing.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
He’s wrong.<br/>
But even the person who wrote the book (the magazines/newsletters for years) about Autonomous Ed has said it’s not the same.  That was after YEARS of shutting down anyone who talked about unschooling with “Well, we call it Autonomous Ed here.”<br/>
<br/>
YEARS, and years of the potential for people in the UK to understand unschooling better was shut down by people (I think; I could be wrong) who wanted money and influence.  I hope I’m wrong about that.  <br/>
<br/>
What I’m right about is that there are many peaceful benefits of the kind of unschooling we’ve discussed here for a long time (and in other places before this).   It’s not just my kids who are now grown and out in the world without compromises, without “sort of” or “kind of” or “mostly” unschooling.  It’s not another word for something they’re doing in the UK. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If Alan Thomas or Peter Grey misunderstands the finer points of unschooling, that’s fine.  Their research on reading and learning are still useful.  It doesn’t make them experts on unschooling AT ALL, that they’ve met and interviewed or spoken with or spoken to unschoolers and other home ed families. <br/>

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
And it’s false.<br/>
<br/>
When people write (happily and hopefully) “When he decides to learn to read, he’ll be able to teach himself!” or “If he wants to learn to read, he can,” those statements are cheery, and very unlike school, but they’re also wrongheaded and very unlike unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to read when they start to see the patterns and discover on their own the several parts of reading.  It doesn’t come from wanting it or deciding.  And a parent who expresses those ideas to children will be sending a different message from school’s grade level and time table, but also could be setting the child up for frustration and failure. <br/>
<br/>
It’s not possible for a child to fail to read  the words start to make sense.<br/>
It IS possible for a child to fail to read when she wants to, or to decide it’s time, and find that he can’t do it.  <br/>
<br/>
Deciding, wanting, undertaking…. those aren’t how unschooling works.  DOING, being, exploring, talking, watching, hearing—those things lead to all other things. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/connections">http://sandradodd.com/connections</a><br/>
<br/>
To learn to swim, kids will need to be around water, just as for learning to ride a bicycle there needs to BE a bicycle.  Horses.  Trampoline.  Without the convehance/material/substance, the child can’t try and learn and polish.  Nobody will learn to play ball without a ball.<br/>

<p>I&#39;m jumping into this discussion after having missed the start, while I was away in the UK.</p>
<p>So I apologize if I cover something that&#39;s already been covered.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>==<span style="color:rgb(33, 33, 33);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;line-height:18.3px;">To learn to swim, kids will need to be around water==<br>
<br>
Absolutely. Also, some kids will find swimming harder than others, no matter what. My son (9) has always been around water - this summer we&#39;ve been in the local pool at least 2 or 3 times a week,&nbsp;and is confident, but he finds swimming - especially freestyle
 - hard work. Because he&#39;s muscly...he sinks very easily. He finds it hard to float on his back. It&#39;s a physical thing that is well known - kids and adults with lots of dense muscle don&#39;t float so well, so find it harder to swim. He finds breast stroke easier
 as his legs and middle don&#39;t sink so quickly...his Dad and Granddad have the same problems with swimming.<br>
<br>
I guess if he swam every day, and really wanted to become better, he would build up other muscles to make that possible. But he can do about 400m now, and he&#39;s happy with that, and he likes diving.&nbsp;<br>

I (thought I) made a conscious decision to do it. I wouldn’t have needed to decide anything if I was living in&nbsp;Portugal or Brazil, but I wasn’t. I wasn&#39;t even with him, as we met, spent a week together and then work kept us apart for 2 months. I spent hours (6 or 7) every night working on it, self-motivated by THE great motivator, love.

<p>I&#39;m jumping into this discussion after having missed the start, while I was away in the UK.</p>
<p>So I apologize if I cover something that&#39;s already been covered.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>==<span style="color:rgb(33, 33, 33);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;">To learn to swim, kids will need to be around water==<br>
<br>
Absolutely. Also, some kids will find swimming harder than others, no matter what. My son (9) has always been around water - this summer we&#39;ve been in the local pool at least 2 or 3 times a week,&nbsp;and is confident, but he finds swimming - especially freestyle
 - hard work. Because he&#39;s muscly...he sinks very easily. He finds it hard to float on his back. It&#39;s a physical thing that is well known - kids and adults with lots of dense muscle don&#39;t float so well, so find it harder to swim. He finds breast stroke easier
 as his legs and middle don&#39;t sink so quickly...his Dad and Granddad have the same problems with swimming.<br>
<br>
I guess if he swam every day, and really wanted to become better, he would build up other muscles to make that possible. But he can do about 400m now, and he&#39;s happy with that, and he likes diving.&nbsp;<br>

I did! &nbsp;Three years later I&#39;m still learning about and unlearning misconceptions I had about unschooling when I started, and I&#39;m more careful now than I used to be about assuming I understand something well enough to tell others about it. &nbsp;And anytime I make that assumption, and then talk, I usually learn something new about what I don&#39;t actually know yet. ;)<br><br>I have also known people who don&#39;t talk a lot directly about it, but live it really well, and when you&#39;re around them and their kids, it&#39;s pretty clear they&#39;re doing something wonderful. &nbsp;Those people have been the most positively influential on me, among the people I have met in person.<br><br>I used to talk more about unschooling, which was pretty silly--presumptuous too-- because I still am not technically unschooling. &nbsp;My oldest would now be in kindergarten and I live in a place where kindergarten is mostly non-compulsory. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t talk about it very much very often. &nbsp;But I did feel that impulse for awhile, being excited about something amazing and wanting to tell everyone all about it-- &nbsp;I wanted to spread the good news! &nbsp;Like some sort of evangelist. ;) &nbsp;<br>I tend towards shyness and not wanting to create conflict, or causing people discomfort, so fortunately for everyone--me included--I didn&#39;t make a good evangelist.<br><br>Anyway, the deeper I got into my own deschooling, the more I saw how little I really understood well, and how problematic it could be for me and for others for me to talk much about it, especially without an actual invitation to talk about it. Even with an invitation to talk about it, right now I say very little, I explain I&#39;m learning about unschooling, and direct them toward better resources than myself. &nbsp;I do more discussing in online forums where more experienced unschoolers can point out where I might not be clear on something.<br><br>That might change over the years, and it might not, I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;But even with parents with older kids I&#39;ve met, the ones who talk less about what they&#39;re doing, and *live* what they&#39;re doing instead, have been a better example for me to learn from.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#39;t never mention it out loud, but I definitely have been working on being more careful and thoughtful about when and where and how to talk about it with others, and that practice has helped me learn better about what my motivations are, and to better sort out and honor my priorities, as well as the dignity of others to make choices that are different from mine.<br><br>Lisa Celedon<br><br><br></span></div></div></html></div>

I had no idea how two unmedicated natural births could be so&nbsp;different based on that little&nbsp;“detail” - in terms of stress, pressure for time etc.</font></div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;"><font color="#3f3f3f" face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;"><font color="#3f3f3f" face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto" size="2">When we went to a terrific&nbsp;</font><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;">&quot;subtropical swimming paradise</span><font color="#3f3f3f" face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto" size="2">”&nbsp;in France with dozens of&nbsp;families of Unscholers last May, his least&nbsp;favorite thing about the trip (which he loved) was the water :)&nbsp;</font><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;">That’s why I&nbsp;originally posted that I need to be OK - and really, I am! - with the fact he may never choose to be a swimmer.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div style="font-family:'Myriad Pro';font-size:14px;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;">Clara</span></div><p></p>
