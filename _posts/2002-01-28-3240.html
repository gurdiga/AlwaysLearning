 </span></blockquote>Conor had a book out of the library for awhile called The Science of Star <br/>
Wars. They discussed which things were currently possible, what was probably <br/>
possible in the future based on current technology, and what seemed <br/>
impossible. Conor was fascinated, especially with light sabers (they were <br/>
called impossible, Conor wants to figure out a way to do it) and <br/>
hovercrafts. I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s one for Star Trek too.<br/>

of the universe.  It violates the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.<br/>
In some of the later novels (yes, I am a Star Trek junkie and those<br/>
novels are mind candy) they developed this idea that one cannot go<br/>
past Warp 9.99999... never reaching Warp 10.  Can you say plot device?<br/>

website called Realities beyond the myth that looks even better than the <br/>
book. I&#39;ll have to keep it open for Conor to see.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, looks like an interesting site.  Especially<br/>
the part about Taoism.  That was good...I have used<br/>
Star Wars to explain Taoism to people before and they<br/>
thought I was kidding or just crazy.<br/>
