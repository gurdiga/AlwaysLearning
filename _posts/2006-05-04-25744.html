<div id="ygrps-yiv-274272151">**I am trying to be more present, which is a big problem for me. I tend <br/>
to escape in reading, I am working on this.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll confess to this, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about mindfulness this week, since I&#39;ve tended to <br/>
skip on it, and I think I&#39;m starting to see the light.<br/>
<br/>
My mind jumps around, and I&#39;m often thinking about what I still need to <br/>
do and which thing I&#39;m going to do next, instead of thinking about what <br/>
I&#39;m currently doing.  (Hey, even as I&#39;m typing this, my eye is falling <br/>
on the To Do list next to my computer.  Distracting.  I should really <br/>
have started the baked beans already.)<br/>
<br/>
An example of this is when I&#39;m reading to my kid.  If I&#39;m not totally <br/>
engrossed by the book, which is rare, then I sometimes count the pages <br/>
remaining in the chapter, surreptiously, while I&#39;m reading (and mentally <br/>
reviewing the other things I want or need to do.)  Reminds me of all the <br/>
time I spent in school looking at the clock.  (When I&#39;m really bored in <br/>
a lecture situation even as an adult, I&#39;ll actually calculate the <br/>
remaining minutes as a percentage of the total class time, over and <br/>
over.  Or I&#39;ll daydream.  But I find it difficult to attend to something <br/>
that is tiresome or confusing.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m fairly terrible at the mindfulness thing, uh, so far.<br/>
<br/>
While reading aloud to my son (and thinking), it finally struck me how <br/>
much my son loves the books we are reading and loves being read to.  <br/>
(Duh!)  And I realized that I could be putting my love into my narration <br/>
and really feeling it.  Beaming at him in my heart while reading.  Being <br/>
in tune with him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little odd making the switch from thinking of love as a <br/>
spontaneous feeling that pops up sometimes, over to thinking of it as a <br/>
continuous presence that just needs to be acknowledged.  (And I wish I <br/>
could say that better.)  I just felt I could be thinking &quot;Here&#39;s some <br/>
love&quot; with every word I was saying.  (And I thought feeling the love was <br/>
a great alternative to feeling antsy.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a half-step towards mindfulness for me to think &quot;Here I <br/>
am, doing something that he loves, with the son that I love.  This is <br/>
love.&quot;  (I&#39;m not sure I was truly *mindfully present*  since apparently <br/>
I was being so darned analytical, but it was a &quot;click&quot; of mindshifting <br/>
for me.  And some of the analysis came afterwards.)<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who have been in a loving good mood all along, or at least <br/>
whenever you remembered to try to be, can take a minute and go &quot;Wow, <br/>
she&#39;s slow&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to notice that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to ever feel an <br/>
overflowing love for my To Do list &lt;g&gt;, so I guess I&#39;ll try to give it a <br/>
smaller share of my attention!  (Oh, and my point is that I think I can <br/>
&quot;tune into&quot; the love, on purpose, even when it&#39;s not the loudest voice <br/>
in my head.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m terrible at it sometimes, but the trick (my trick) is to see  <br/>
being with kids as non-tiresome and not confusing.  My clarity is the  <br/>
idea that I want them to have lots of  pleasant memories and not much  <br/>
to block out.  I want them to go to sleep happy and wake up happy, as  <br/>
much as possible.  I find the idea that I might be able to do that  <br/>
really exciting.  I went to sleep crying LOTS of times as a kid.  Can  <br/>
I fix that by seeing my own children go to sleep peacefully?  Seems so.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure anyone could say it better.  That was nice!<br/>

I kinda feel the Lion King soundtrack welling up inside me, all Elton- <br/>
John-errific.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian has said a time or two that because her own family of  <br/>
origin was not authoritarian, spanking, or mean, that she might not  <br/>
find it as easy as some others do to know what not to do, or to see  <br/>
so starkly what &#39;the opposite&#39; would be.  (It&#39;s clear from that  <br/>
muddle that I don&#39;t remember exactly what she said, but I just have  <br/>
an impression of what it seemed I thought she meant.)  Maybe it&#39;s  <br/>
that way with mindfulness, as a goal.  If someone&#39;s life isn&#39;t in any  <br/>
great shambles, and unschooling is going pretty well, maybe  <br/>
mindfulness will seem like sprinkles on the frosting on the cake.   <br/>
But then if someone does figure out why people keep talking about it,  <br/>
the whole cake and frosting thing seems unnecessary.  Every bit of  <br/>
life is like cake.  Cakes don&#39;t just pop up on birthdays and  <br/>
anniversaries.  (I must be hungry.)<br/>
