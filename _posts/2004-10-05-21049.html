<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292828520">My husband has a PhD and does really interesting and amazing work in <br/>
science--stuff like turning molecules into electronic components, <br/>
nanotechnology kind of stuff. He&#39;s been published countless times and <br/>
has written several successful grant proposals. He can&#39;t spell worth a <br/>
damn. Doesn&#39;t need to. Any simple word processing program or email <br/>
program will tell him when he&#39;s wrong. No one knows a person can&#39;t spell <br/>
when talking to them in person.<br/>
<br/>
Why does your husband think ds needs to know how to spell? Why do you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852467134">I also have a 12 yo son, Antonio,  and he does not spell well and has bad <br/>
handwriting.  My parents are always  pointing this out to me, and I reply as you <br/>
did.  He is only 12 and if he  needed or wanted to spell better, I am sure he <br/>
could learn, and I would even  help him if he wanted.  I am not sure that if <br/>
he had *formal schooling*, he  would do any better.  His spelling has improved <br/>
in the last year, basically  due to talking to people online and keeping an <br/>
online journal.  Of course,  these activities have not improved his handwriting <br/>
any.<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.   For one thing, he is only 12.  And there are <br/>
plenty of public school 12  year olds who can&#39;t spell.  And a 12 yo usually <br/>
doesn&#39;t need to know how to  spell.  If he needs it or wants it, he will learn it.<br/>
 <br/>
Note--my 10 yo daughter, who  aspires to be a published writer is an <br/>
excellent speller, lol!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027522934">When Adriane (now almost 14) was in school as a little kid, she ALWAYS made<br/>
100&#39;s on her spelling tests....then she promptly forgot how to spell the<br/>
words.  Her grades looked like she should be a wonderful speller but in<br/>
reality, she was pretty bad.<br/>
<br/>
She continued to be an awful speller for many years.  She knew it, we knew<br/>
it, nobody thought much about it.  Until this last Spring......she started<br/>
emailing friends.  She didn&#39;t want them to think she couldn&#39;t spell....so<br/>
she learned how.  She saved old emails and would search through them to find<br/>
the correct spelling, sometimes she would ask me but preferred to figure it<br/>
out for herself.  She improved tremendously.....because she wanted to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560072115">Of my four children, two spell well, two don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
One of my &quot;don&#39;ts&quot; is 14 and decided to go to high school this year after<br/>
unschooling for two years (and attending an unschool-like school before<br/>
that). His English teacher told him to use spell check before turning papers<br/>
in. She wasn&#39;t worried about it. Most teachers see kids who spell well and<br/>
those who don&#39;t. Spell check is a great solution for those who want to spell<br/>
something well for a purpose. And one of my good spellers learned much of<br/>
his &quot;good spelling&quot; from spell check. He remembers words once he sees them,<br/>
and evidently was interested enough. Doesn&#39;t work that way for my don&#39;ts.<br/>
<br/>
Some people who have schooled for 18 years don&#39;t spell well. I don&#39;t know<br/>
how to convince your husband though :)<br/>
<br/>
Boy, I wish I could load a gps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844763736">More important than knowing how to spell is knowing WHEN it does and doesn&#39;t matter if words are spelled correctly.<br/>
<br/>
Published writing is edited by someone other than the author.  My husband oftens asks me to edit things for him, both for spelling and grammar.  Spelling is easy for me, but I still need to look words up sometimes.  I share this information and other related ideas with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I *can* write neatly, but I usually use the computer for anything that is more than a sentence or two.  If I&#39;m in a hurry, I&#39;m capable of very messy writing!  I see a similar thing in my kids.  Sometimes their writing is fast and sloppy, other times they are very careful with every letter and their writing is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
For much of a child&#39;s writing, spelling doesn&#39;t matter.  My girls have private journals and other notebooks that they write and draw all sorts of things in.  Sometimes they ask how to spell a word, sometimes they just guess.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids have wanted to write something that will leave our house, I&#39;ve offered to help them with the spelling, but it depends on what it is and who they are writing to.  I know, and I&#39;ve told them, that spelling is important to my mom, so they usually ask me to help them spell when they are writing to her.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, as others have pointed out, many high school and college graduates have sloppy penmanship and poor spelling.<br/>

He&#39;s probably functioning fine for a twelve year old.   LOTS of people don&#39;t <br/>
spell well when they&#39;re his age.   Lots don&#39;t when they&#39;re grown.  Pressure <br/>
and shame have never helped anyone become a better speller.<br/>
<br/>
What will help is practice writing, and more reading.   Maybe (maybe as a <br/>
token gesture, or just because it&#39;s useful with a lot of films) leave subtitles <br/>
on when he&#39;s reading.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly read &quot;Whoa&quot; last night on something and was surprised at the spelling, <br/>
but now she knows.<br/>
<br/>

How do you do it without making your son more UNhappy than you will make your <br/>
husband happy?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When I taught English we did lots of writing, and the kids were 7th and 9th <br/>
grade (12 to 15).  Lots couldn&#39;t spell.  Every misspelling got circled and a <br/>
point off.  Whooptie do for me.  Yuck.  Sometimes there was a clever trick to <br/>
show them, and it helps if they read their own stuff back to themselves (IF it&#39;s <br/>
important enough), so they can catch the contractions and possessives (get <br/>
the apostrophes in and out where they should or shouldn&#39;t be).   <br/>
<br/>
My husband was a horrible speller when he was 20, 21 and I met him.  He&#39;s <br/>
kept getting better over the years.<br/>
<br/>
There are some great spellers who are mean people, bad providers, alcoholics.<br/>
There are some terrible spellers who are great people, good parents, <br/>

<time> 7 Oct 2004, at  9:19am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075824780">This article brings to mind a conversation my husband had with a co-<br/>
worker about a year ago.  The co-worker had gone to the doctor <br/>
displaying some symptoms (I don&#39;t know what they were), and had <br/>
gotten a little upset that the doctor decided to research the <br/>
symptoms and what their cause could be before giving a diagnosis. <br/>
This patient had wanted an instant diagnosis, and figured that the <br/>
doctor must not be very good if he had to &quot;look things up&quot;.  My DH <br/>
then told him that it&#39;s better to be sure of a diagnosis than to just <br/>
start treatment for something without knowing for sure if it&#39;s the <br/>
right one.  But this guy just kept going on and on about how doctors <br/>
need to know everything and should never have to look things up.  My <br/>
DH and I both agreed (when we discussed this later) that we&#39;d prefer <br/>
a doctor to look things up if he/she isn&#39;t totally sure because some <br/>
symptoms come up in different illnesses.  (We do have a doctor who <br/>
tends to diagnosis things off the cuff, and I&#39;ve had to insist that <br/>
he test for something that I knew I had - strep throat - when he <br/>
was &quot;absolutely sure&quot; that it was the flu.)  Of course, there are <br/>
some things doctors need to know; my point isn&#39;t about what a doctor <br/>
should or shouldn&#39;t know.  But this is an example of how our society <br/>
tends to see the end of education as being a head full of <br/>
information, and this guy&#39;s doctor obviously didn&#39;t &quot;pass the test&quot;.<br/>
