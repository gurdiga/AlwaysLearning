 </span></blockquote>My kids watched Star Trek Voyager together for years - it was one of the <br/>
shows they all three loved and they&#39;d keep track of when it was on and make <br/>
sure we recorded it if we weren&#39;t going to be home. We have a big-screen tv <br/>
in our living room - and a small-screen tv in our bedroom. They got in the <br/>
habit of watching Voyager always in the bedroom -- I&#39;d go look at them all <br/>
piled all over each other on our waterbed, cuddling and laughing and talking <br/>
and giggling and making comments throughout the show. They&#39;d seen them all <br/>
before -- and didn&#39;t mind missing some of it. It was VERY active viewing.<br/>
<br/>
It drove me nuts to watch it like that - although I LOVED seeing them doing <br/>
it. So, if I really wanted to watch, instead of watching with them, I&#39;d go <br/>
watch in the living room or watch it later on my own.<br/>
<br/>
Once again this was a show with a LOT to offer -- lots of relationship stuff <br/>
-- you should HEAR the kids talking out how one person behaved to another and <br/>
what their motivation was and the likely reaction and so on... Also lots of <br/>
science interest was generated by it. Lots of wanting to know what was real <br/>
and what was fiction.<br/>
<br/>
And - even if I couldn&#39;t come up with one single redeeming tidbit of value - <br/>
enjoyment is enough. Plus add to it that these three girls usually have <br/>
interests that are very different from each other&#39;s  and this was something <br/>
they did together and enjoyed together in their very own special way.<br/>
