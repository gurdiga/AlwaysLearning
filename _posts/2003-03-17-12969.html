<div id="ygrps-yiv-26206638"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;Could everyone tell me how old their children are,<br/>
&gt; how long you have been unschooling, and  what a<br/>
&gt; typical day is like?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dh, Chris, and I have two children.  Quentin is 7<br/>
and Sierra is 4.  We&#39;ve been unschooling since May<br/>
2000 when we &quot;discovered&quot; it at an unschooling<br/>
conference in TX.  It changed our life.<br/>
<br/>
our weekend in tucson:<br/>
<br/>
It was actually HOT here last week.  I even packed up<br/>
our winter sweaters.  Felt a little foolish<br/>
remembering that we were complaining about the cold<br/>
just the week before at the park.   So we are glad for<br/>
some more rain today.  It is supposed to be COLD again<br/>
starting tomorrow [for those of you who live where it<br/>
actually GETS cold, I should clarify that this means<br/>
below 65F LOL] & lasting all week.  I think we&#39;ll<br/>
appreciate it a little more this time around.  Maybe<br/>
we&#39;ll get another chance to drive up the mountain and<br/>
play in the snow.  Chris & Sierra are both sick, so<br/>
we&#39;d have to get them well first.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I took the kids to the Buenos Aires<br/>
National Wildlife Refuge, which we had never been to<br/>
before.  It was about an hour drive south, to almost<br/>
Mexico (really!).  They were celebrating the 100th<br/>
birthday of the National Wildlife Refuge system & it<br/>
was so much fun.  Lot of stuff for the kids - they got<br/>
to pet snakes & a skink & see a legless lizard from<br/>
the phoenix zoo & color bat masks & make butterfly<br/>
rings & clay tablet etchings.  I imagined us taking<br/>
little hikes around the preserve to see birds &<br/>
creatures (we all had our binoculars), but we never<br/>
got around to doing any actual hiking.  We did manage<br/>
to get 3 helium balloons, one which made it all the<br/>
way back to our home in Tucson intact!  On the way<br/>
home, Quentin asked if we could go again next year.  I<br/>
said sure! (maybe they&#39;ll have a 101 celebration?)<br/>
<br/>
When we got home Quentin&#39;s friend, Stephanie, came<br/>
over to play.  Actually she got there before we did,<br/>
because it took me 2 hours to get home from the<br/>
refuge, although it only took 1 hr to get there.  The<br/>
police had roads closed so I kept trying different<br/>
routes, which were also closed.  It was very<br/>
irritating.  Chris finally found the news - a guy was<br/>
barricaded in his apt (apparently with a gun?) and<br/>
police had evacuated the entire area.  Which wasn&#39;t<br/>
near our home, but I needed to drive by the apts to<br/>
get home.  So we did finally make it home (big sigh of<br/>
relief) & the kids played.  Stephanie&#39;s parents &<br/>
little sister rode their bike (singular) by later &<br/>
Chris & I tried out their tandem bike.  It was cool,<br/>
except Chris was in front so all I could see was his<br/>
back which was weird.  Later we drove over to see<br/>
their new home which they are moving into next<br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I helped teach &quot;Moses & the Burning Bush&quot; to the kids<br/>
at church (UU) this morning & then I took Quentin &<br/>
Sierra to the Tucson Art Museum for Family art day. <br/>
It was the 1st time we&#39;d been & it was fun too<br/>
(mostly).   There was a little tour with the guide<br/>
telling us & the other families a little about the<br/>
featured artist & she got the kids to participate by<br/>
asking what things they saw in his abstract paintings,<br/>
etc.  Sierra liked to jump up & contribute something<br/>
each time LOL  She pointed out a person&#39;s body and a<br/>
square shape.<br/>
<br/>
However, Sierra was mostly interested in running down<br/>
he loooooooong ramps that go down the center of the<br/>
museum, so I&#39;d have to hike down the loooong ramps &<br/>
walk her back up (several times). Then we did family<br/>
poems based on paintings, which turned out better than<br/>
you might have expected.  Then we had to run through<br/>
the rain to the next building for snack time.  Which<br/>
was a big hit with my kids - running in the rain<br/>
followed by cookies & soda & pretzels.  Then each<br/>
family did a family art project based on the art we<br/>
had seen.  We had a giant board onto which we glued<br/>
plastic bags, sign vinyl, popsicle sticks, cloth,<br/>
cardboard, etc.  Then we got to carry our creations<br/>
into the next room & paint the whole thing.  Quentin<br/>
wants to know where we are going to hang ours up LOL. <br/>
It is covering about half of our kitchen table at the<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
Lets see, after the museum event, we went to Luby&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I had bribed Sierra after one of our long ramp<br/>
excursions that if she would behave I would let her<br/>
pick a place for lunch afterwards.  She&#39;s her father&#39;s<br/>
daughter.  She picked Luby&#39;s.  Quentin & I tried to<br/>
talk her out of it because it is on the other side of<br/>
town, but to no avail.  We did bring Chris a roast<br/>
beef dinner to his great delight.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight Quentin & I went to a local peace vigil and<br/>
held candles in the dark from 7 - 8 p.m. with a lot of<br/>
other folks, many from our church.  He loved it. I was<br/>
actually thinking about skipping it, because I was<br/>
tired, but then he came in & asked if kids were<br/>
allowed to go.  I was surprised, because when I had<br/>
discussed it earlier in the day, he pronounced it<br/>
would be &quot;BORING&quot;.  [He had participated once last<br/>
fall at a vigil at the local mosque which was getting<br/>
lots of hate press & mail after 9-11.]  Quentin  was<br/>
fascinated with watching the candles burn.  He liked<br/>
blowing it out & re-lighting it.  We had little paper<br/>
cups around the flame to prevent the wind from blowing<br/>
them out.  At one point, he was trying to get the<br/>
smoke to &quot;go the other way&quot; and his cup caught fire &<br/>
it started a huge blaze.   So I had him drop it on the<br/>
bricks & he sat down & was mesmerized with the burning<br/>
cup & the melting candle and it took quite awhile for<br/>
the whole thing to disappear.<br/>
 <br/>
Now we are home.  Chris & Sierra are sleeping in the<br/>
master bedroom.  Quentin is building K&#39;nex creations -<br/>
6-shooter spaceships & things.  While I&#39;m getting to<br/>
write a few emails :)<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 Happy st. patricks&#39;s day,<br/>
