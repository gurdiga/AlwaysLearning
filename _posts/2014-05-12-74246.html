<div id="ygrps-yiv-776535872">I think my husband and I may have found one of the few topics that we&#39;re not too sure on how to move forward with.

First, there isn&#39;t anything going on personally. And both my husband and I have never had to deal with this, on a personal level. My son is just curious from reading things over people&#39;s shoulders (the news, books, etc) and wants to really have his questions answered.

My overall desire is for my son to have a very clear understanding of what incest is, why it&#39;s had so many different paths throughout history, and I think I may want to point out that it&#39;s a very sensitive topic however, I don&#39;t to turn it into this taboo-ish thing. And he is only 6, so I understand that this may start out with more bits then full pieces of explanation.

Has anyone dealt with this? I need some advice.

<br/>
<br/>
so maybe answering now like joyce suggests with as little info as is needed, then casually in the nearish future, you could look at the animal kingdom, without any mention of the word &#39;incest&#39;... which is to be one of the most horrid words  :  (<br/>

maybe i&#39;m missing your point, but i&#39;ll press send in case it helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018740065">Ladies,<br><br>Thank you for the feedback.<br><br>I have some bad news and the results are pending...<br><br>My son brought up the word again (so, this would be the third time) and I gave him a very simple answer and let it go. He came to me later in the day and asked again, but it was more of a &quot;so, if it&#39;s a brother and sister not a boy and girl from different families..&quot; I asked him where he heard the word. My son said that he and a friend were playing at the friends house and his little friend said that he saw the two neighbors (which are a sister and brother) doing things behind their shed.<br><br>I&#39;ve spoken with our friends and the boy&#39;s mom asked her son some questions and was given the same story from her son that he told mine. The family in question is on vacation until next week. My friend wants to call child services and be done with it. I think we should talk to the parents first. I know this part isn&#39;t really what this list is all about, but opinions are welcomed. I&#39;m nervous about moving forward.<br><br>I still haven&#39;t fully figured out where my son (or his friend) heard the word that I started this topic with however both of us moms have agreed that there needs to be more of an adult presence, for right now anyway, even in our backyards. There always has been between our two families, but more kids have moved into the neighborhood and everyone parents differently, and some kids run around all over and it is now showing what that can leads to, I guess.<br><br>Well, if anyone feels compelled to comment - I appreciate it.</div>
