<div id="ygrps-yiv-934704424">OK, I need a clue.<br/>
<br/>
DH and I decided to pull out the Scrabble board, and of course DS (5) <br/>
wanted to play.  As DS doesn&#39;t know (or show knowledge) of a lot of <br/>
words right now, I was helping him.  I&#39;m not sure if that was a good <br/>
idea or not, but that&#39;s what I did.  And we limited words to 5 letters. <br/>
  I think I was aiming for a &quot;dog/pig/cat/sat&quot; game of Scrabble.  This <br/>
does not require much on my part, as dog/cat/sat is normally what I can <br/>
come up with.  DH, however, commonly comes up with words like &quot;vaunt&quot; . <br/>

thing.  Like, it&#39;s not fun for DH if he has to hold himself back.  It&#39;s <br/>
not fun for me to lose, or see our child frustrated and sad because <br/>
he&#39;s losing.<br/>
<br/>
As a child, my father always let me win . . . and I felt like I was too <br/>
useless to win something on my own.  OTOH, my mom never held back at <br/>
all, and I felt like I&#39;d never be smart enough to challenge her.  And <br/>
so very quickly I never wanted to play any games with my parents.  So I <br/>
want a middle ground.  But DH is concerned that we *tell* Steven &quot;do <br/>
your best&quot; but when it comes down to it, we hold back so that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t lose by a huge margin.  I know very soon he will be winning on <br/>
his own, but in the meantime I am very afraid of screwing this up.<br/>
<br/>
And I know a lot of this stems from my own issues-- I feel stupid a <br/>
lot, and get discouraged if I lose all the time.  And DH is very smart, <br/>
this stuff is easy for him . . .<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  This making sense to anyone?  Maybe Scrabble is just a <br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe Scrabble is just a <br/>
bad game? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think Scrabble is a bad game in general. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My whole life people have said because I was &quot;good with words&quot; I should be <br/>
good at Scrabble, but Scrabble is about math and spatial stuff I don&#39;t have.  <br/>
It&#39;s about being able to rearrange things in your head and read them.   What&#39;s <br/>
about my speed is the medium-level Spell or Starve on Neopets.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can spell, and yes I know a lot of words, but I use them in the real <br/>
ways they were intended, not in the artificial Scrabble-world.  So for one <br/>
thing, Scrabble doesn&#39;t teach spelling.  It rewards a very strange and otherwise <br/>
useless skill--take some random letters and see if you can shuffle them in your <br/>
head until you see a pattern.  Or KNOW the patterns and see what you can <br/>
make.  <br/>
<br/>
You know what my kids liked MUCH better and seems similar as far as the <br/>
surface of what skill is being learned?   Hangman.   We have computer hangman, the <br/>
Ken Winograd game which you can download.  It&#39;s $15 or $10 but VERY much worth <br/>
it in our lives thusfar.  We had it on the oldest Mac and we have it on the <br/>
new one.  That can be played cooperatively or a child can play it on his own.  <br/>
There are definite liklihoods.  R is more likely than G, just in general, in <br/>
English.  But if you get a G at the end of a word it&#39;s worth guessing &quot;n&quot; or <br/>
&quot;i&quot; to see if it&#39;s an &quot;ing&quot; ending.  Kids will start to pick stuff up like that, <br/>
and if they&#39;re Scrabble-minded it will help with that eventually.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little we had Ravensburger kids&#39; games.  They&#39;re way better <br/>
than the lame Candy Land kind of American stuff.  We got some of them from <br/>
Discovery Toys and others from hoity toy stores.  One of their favorites, still <br/>
played in the past few months by Holly and her friends, is &quot;Eureka,&quot; about <br/>
gold miners, and there&#39;s a little train as the &quot;timer.&quot;  Sometimes you roll the <br/>
train and it moves one space (it&#39;s a hex-grid board) and when the train gets to <br/>
town, you all count your gold.  <br/>
<br/>
That game involves dice, but no numbers past five, and no reading.<br/>
<br/>
Others we played which didn&#39;t involve reading were the &quot;first games&quot; (where <br/>
the dice were shapes or colors, not even numbers), Ghost Party/Midnight Party <br/>
(has been published twice with different names), The Squirrel game (harder to <br/>
do because the pieces are more fragile), and there are some other newer <br/>
Ravensburger kids&#39; games since my kids got older.  They&#39;re German, and people living <br/>
in Europe can get them more easily.<br/>
<br/>
OH!!!  Labyrinth.  That&#39;s GOOD.  <br/>
<br/>
A game collecting friend of mine has one (I think by that same company) that <br/>
involves trees (cardboard standup evergreens that go to the ground) and a <br/>
candle.  The candle moves, and you&#39;re elves or pixies or something and you can <br/>
only move in the shadow.  So there are literal shadowed spaces and light spaces, <br/>
which change when the candle is moved.<br/>
<br/>
Doing something which is totally beyond a child&#39;s abilities will just <br/>
frustrate everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend the games Set (which kids can be really good at but adults can be <br/>
confused by) and Five Crowns, both by the same company.  Both card games, but <br/>
one is laying down cards and finding relationships, and the other is kind of <br/>
like rummy and gin, but not exactly.  Better.   <br/>

I try to set it up so it isn&#39;t too obvious that I&#39;m letting him win in the games that he does win.  I let him lose every third game or so so he knows what losing is like and gets used to it.

<h4>Barbara Chase at 2003-10-19 20:17:28 +0300 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958060832">My dd was interested in learning how to play chess a few months ago.  She<br/>
had seen some kids playing with a large, life-like chess set when we were<br/>
in Seattle, and wanted to play too.  I did some research and found several<br/>
places suggest that when the child is getting frustrated you exchange<br/>
sides.  This way the adult never needs to hold back, you don&#39;t need to let<br/>
the child win, and often the child will see how to turn a bad situation<br/>
into a winning one by watching the adult begin to win with what appeared to<br/>
be the losing side.  At any time the child can switch sides, so technically<br/>
they could win every game by switching just before the checkmate.  However,<br/>
I believe this is like assuming that a child will be lazy and do nothing if<br/>
we don&#39;t teach them.  From what I read, kids enjoy learning to play chess<br/>
this way, they stick with the game, and they don&#39;t need to win all of the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Another strategy that I read about is to play complicated games in steps so<br/>
they aren&#39;t so overwhelming.  For example, with chess you first play with<br/>
only the pawns, then when that game gets easy to add the knight, then keep<br/>
adding pieces until you are playing with them all.<br/>
<br/>
I think both of these strategies could be applied to most games, to make it<br/>
fun for the adults and not so frustrating for the kids.  I don&#39;t know if it<br/>
would work with scrabble -- unless you were playing to keep score for the<br/>
adults and just playing for the fun of making up words with your son.  My<br/>
dd came up with her own scrabble game where she invents words and we have<br/>
to pronounce them.  The game never lasts long, but it&#39;s so much more fun<br/>
for her than the real scrabble game.  Personally, I agree... I&#39;ve never<br/>
been a scrabble fan.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a really good idea!!<br/>
<br/>
There are some kid&#39; chess sets with the moves drawn out on the base of each <br/>
piece.  I thought that was a good idea for people like myself who forget <br/>
patterns and games rules easily.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve traded card hands with kids sometimes if they were stuck and about to <br/>
get grumpy and thought their cards were just bad.  That&#39;s been fun sometimes, <br/>
like if we&#39;re playing rummy and they trade a confusing mess for something with <br/>
some pairs or near-runs.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My<br/>
dd came up with her own scrabble game where she invents words and we have<br/>
to pronounce them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before Holly could spell, we would let her play the spelling version of Five <br/>
Crowns (I&#39;m forgetting the name) and as long as she could pronounce her word, <br/>
we&#39;d accept it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done that with lots of kids and a game called Picture Picture, where <br/>
you have to write down words.  If they just put it on the right beginning letter <br/>
(it&#39;s an alphabet-based thing) and could remember what they meant to name, <br/>
we&#39;d let it count.  Oh--Even if the letter was wrong.  If they thought &quot;c&quot; <br/>
instead of &quot;k&quot; or &quot;e&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot; or &quot;a&quot; we&#39;d still count it as their c or e <br/>
word.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My brother and I used to pay chess with my grandmpa when we were little.<br/>
We won quite a bit. I still remember the day when I was watching them<br/>
play and saw my brother going in for the checkmate, and I opened my mouth<br/>
to say something to my grandpa (bad sportmanship, I know, but I was<br/>
little and didn&#39;t think about that) and he looked up at me and winked,<br/>
and it was clear he say my brother&#39;s plan and had decided to let him do<br/>
it, to let him know. I felt really betrayed, like he&#39;d been lying to us<br/>
for years. Eventually my brother figured it out, too, and felt the same<br/>
way - we never really knew if we were good at chess or not, because he<br/>
always let us win. So I never did that with Rain. <br/>
<br/>
What I did do, and still do sometimes, is handicap myself in certain<br/>
ways, and also offer her help at various times. Now she&#39;s not as<br/>
competitive, we play tons of games but really just for fun, but at 5 and<br/>
6 and 7 losing was hard...<br/>
<br/>
We still haven&#39;t tried Scrabble - now it would probably work, but it&#39;s a<br/>
long game and harder to adapt to various levels. We do have a game called<br/>
Tuf-abet, which is out of print but available pretty cheap on ebay, and<br/>
it&#39;s got the same wort of interlocking letters to make words ideas, but<br/>
since each player has their own letters you can adapt it pretty easily.<br/>
Right now, all Rain needs is to be able to check with me on word spelling<br/>
sometimes, but with a younger kid you could do lots of things - give him<br/>
more time, let him flip the letter cubes to find the letters he wants,<br/>
etc. We did play Boggle when Rain was younger, although not 5, and she<br/>
would get more time and was allowed to make words with any number of<br/>
letters, whereas mine had to have at least 5 and there were no bonus<br/>
points for longer words until you hit 10 or so letters.... I love word<br/>
games..<br/>
<br/>
Rain was usually okay with these sorts of changes - I did tell her I&#39;d<br/>
been reading and writing for a lot longer than she had, and it helped<br/>
with these games. In golf, some players get a handicap, too. With some<br/>
games (Set, Frog Juice, Rat-a-Tat-Cat, Midnight Party, Slamwich) a 5 yr<br/>
old can be just as good as an adult, or better, and I think it&#39;s good to<br/>
play games like that sometimes, too.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like this is about you, too - maybe you could get a handicap<br/>
when you play certain games with DH? It would probably make the idea more<br/>
palatable to your son, and if your husband is really good at word games<br/>
and your not, it might level the playing field too... and maybe you need<br/>
to find some things your good at, too - maybe word games just aren&#39;t your<br/>
thing, but there are lots of other kinds of games...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is so interesting to me, because my husband and I played <br/>
Scrabble the other night with friends of ours who love the game.  I, <br/>
myself, hadn&#39;t played it in years and had forgotten how much fun it <br/>
was.  <br/>
One aspect of it that I never realized before this recent game is <br/>
that you can totally bluff by misspelling a word, or even completely <br/>
inventing one.  Other people have the option to challenge you on it <br/>
and then look it up in the dictionary.  If it&#39;s an actual word and <br/>
it is in fact spelled correctly the challenger loses a turn, and if <br/>
the challenger was correct, and the word is misspelled or non-<br/>
existant, then the bluffer loses a turn.<br/>
So it turns out that you can do well at Scrabble without having an <br/>
extensive vocabulary (and good spelling skills) at all so long as <br/>
you&#39;re good at bluffing.<br/>
As far as rewarding strange and otherwise useless skills- I don&#39;t <br/>
see a problem with that so long as the players are enjoying the game <br/>
and having a good time all around.  It seems to me the same could be <br/>
said for just about any board game.<br/>
Another &quot;word&quot; game that&#39;s really about patterns is Boggle.<br/>
It&#39;s a much faster game (and I think a more fun one) than Scrabble.<br/>
My husband and I love Set but our children aren&#39;t drawn to it at all.<br/>
They *love* Yahtzee though! <br/>

Scrabble. Rain is learning to spell more words with Tuf-abet, which is<br/>
the same idea - shuffling random letters around and making them into<br/>
words. Generally she&#39;ll see that she has a good number of letters that<br/>
she thinks will make a certain word, and then ask how to spell it.<br/>
Sometimes I throw in a spelling/game tip, like the q almost always having<br/>
a u after it so if I have a q I stick the u on right away. I did notice<br/>
that she spelled &quot;quiet&quot; during one game (after asking me how it&#39;s<br/>
spelled) and then spelled it correctly a few days later when writing<br/>
something...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479853514">Just my two cents on Scrabble...<br/>
<br/>
I love playing it because I love words, but I don&#39;t really care about winning.  When I was a kid, my dad and I played &quot;open scrabble.&quot;  We&#39;d follow all the same rules, but we&#39;d put our tiles out in the open and help each other make words.  This was a lot more fun for me, and if my dad wanted to spell &quot;vaunt&quot; while I spelled &quot;cat,&quot; there was no problem because there were no points.  Also, it wasn&#39;t as boring for me to wait for him to take his turn, because we&#39;d discuss options together.   My mom and sister never liked to play this way, but my dad and I loved it, so maybe it depends on your personality.<br/>
<br/>
To this day, I&#39;d rather play open Scrabble, but I&#39;m happy to play for points, too.<br/>

  it in our lives thusfar.  We had it on the oldest Mac and we have it on the <br/>
  new one.  That can be played cooperatively or a child can play it on his own.  <br/>
  There are definite liklihoods.  R is more likely than G, just in general, in <br/>
  English.  But if you get a G at the end of a word it&#39;s worth guessing &quot;n&quot; or <br/>
  &quot;i&quot; to see if it&#39;s an &quot;ing&quot; ending.  Kids will start to pick stuff up like that, <br/>
  and if they&#39;re Scrabble-minded it will help with that eventually.<br/>
<br/>
  When my kids were little we had Ravensburger kids&#39; games.  They&#39;re way better <br/>
  than the lame Candy Land kind of American stuff.  We got some of them from <br/>
  Discovery Toys and others from hoity toy stores.  One of their favorites, still <br/>
  played in the past few months by Holly and her friends, is &quot;Eureka,&quot; about <br/>
  gold miners, and there&#39;s a little train as the &quot;timer.&quot;  Sometimes you roll the <br/>
  train and it moves one space (it&#39;s a hex-grid board) and when the train gets to <br/>
  town, you all count your gold.  <br/>
<br/>
  That game involves dice, but no numbers past five, and no reading.<br/>
<br/>
  Others we played which didn&#39;t involve reading were the &quot;first games&quot; (where <br/>
  the dice were shapes or colors, not even numbers), Ghost Party/Midnight Party <br/>
  (has been published twice with different names), The Squirrel game (harder to <br/>
  do because the pieces are more fragile), and there are some other newer <br/>
  Ravensburger kids&#39; games since my kids got older.  They&#39;re German, and people living <br/>
  in Europe can get them more easily.<br/>
<br/>
  OH!!!  Labyrinth.  That&#39;s GOOD.  <br/>
<br/>
  A game collecting friend of mine has one (I think by that same company) that <br/>
  involves trees (cardboard standup evergreens that go to the ground) and a <br/>
  candle.  The candle moves, and you&#39;re elves or pixies or something and you can <br/>
  only move in the shadow.  So there are literal shadowed spaces and light spaces, <br/>
  which change when the candle is moved.<br/>
<br/>
  Doing something which is totally beyond a child&#39;s abilities will just <br/>
  frustrate everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
  I recommend the games Set (which kids can be really good at but adults can be <br/>
  confused by) and Five Crowns, both by the same company.  Both card games, but <br/>
  one is laying down cards and finding relationships, and the other is kind of <br/>
  like rummy and gin, but not exactly.  Better.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358165010">**Which led to a discussion of how we want to do the whole game<br/>
thing.  Like, it&#39;s not fun for DH if he has to hold himself back.  It&#39;s<br/>
not fun for me to lose, or see our child frustrated and sad because<br/>
he&#39;s losing.**<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we play teams, with father and son collaborating.  Sometimes <br/>
we play for the pleasure of making words and we don&#39;t keep score.  (We <br/>
play Quiddler, instead of Scrabble, but it&#39;s similar.)<br/>
<br/>
Modifying the rules and letting your son draw more tiles or use wild <br/>
card tiles is also a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
**I think Scrabble is a bad game in general. &lt;g&gt;**<br/>
<br/>
I find the waiting for other people&#39;s turns utterly tiresome, because of <br/>
how long they spend thinking.  When we play Quiddler I try to make it a <br/>
game where everyone works on their words simultaneously, even though one <br/>
is supposed to wait for the prior player to discard.<br/>
<br/>
Hangman is very popular here as well.  I think it&#39;s the gruesome outcome <br/>
that my son enjoys.  And Wheel of Fortune was fun when he was first <br/>
learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
**I recommend the games Set (which kids can be really good at but adults <br/>
can be<br/>

<br/>
Five Crowns didn&#39;t catch on at my house, but Wizard, by the same <br/>
company, was a big favorite for quite a long time.<br/>

When I was a kid, my dad and I played &quot;open scrabble.&quot;  We&#39;d follow all the same rules, but we&#39;d put our tiles out in the open and help each other make words.&gt;&gt;           <br/>
         <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My grandmother and aunts have been BIG scrabble players so it&#39;s a game I&#39;ve played a lot. We also play what we call Take 2. Each player takes 7 tiles and has to form them into words, with all the words connecting just like on a scrabble board. When you finish you say &quot;take 2&quot; and everyone has to take 2 more tiles. and so on until the game is over. First person done, wins.<br/>
<br/>
   It&#39;s a very quick game and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for young kids unless they were teamed with someone as they would probably get really frustrated with it. (You often have to pull all your words apart and start over). <br/>
  Julie, who has just remembered that my husband promised to play scrabble with me if I learned to play chess. Have to remind him!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277856941">We&#39;re a big gaming family. Love games of all kinds, own more commercial games <br/>
than I want to count, make up our own, always looking for new games. <br/>
<br/>
I think that adults &quot;cheating&quot; by losing on purpose is a bad idea. The kids <br/>
ALWAYS figure it out eventually, at which point they lose trust in and respect <br/>
for the adults. It also puts even more emphasis on winning and losing than I <br/>
like to have. And it quickly becomes horribly boring for the adults. On the <br/>
other hand, I think that adults insisting on smashing kids by &quot;playing by the <br/>
official rules&quot; on games where the adults have a clear advantage because of <br/>
experience, just sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Games should be fun for everyone playing. If they&#39;re not, play a different <br/>
game or change the rules. We quite often manipulate the rules of games to create <br/>
a situation where our kids can play on a level playing field with the adults. <br/>
For us that means tinkering so that the kids are able to win without the <br/>
adults holding back, somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of the time. When the kids get <br/>
older and more skilled so that the handicapping results in them consistently <br/>
winning around 3/4 of the time we readjust.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, we&#39;ve been playing Scattergories the last few days. (commercial <br/>
version of that word game where you try to come up with words starting with a <br/>
certain letter in a dozen different categories - you only get score for words <br/>
you come up with that no one else does).   The 11 year olds get double points <br/>
for their scores, to account for the adults greater breadth of knowledge and <br/>
vocabulary. <br/>
<br/>
I love SCRABBLE, but I&#39;ve never tried to play it competitively with a five <br/>
year old, I haven&#39;t had a five year old that would be able to play it on any <br/>
level and enjoy it. (We have played it together as a team just trying to fill the <br/>
board and use the letters.) If I were to try it competitively, it would <br/>
require a lot of handicapping. Perhaps the skilled adult would be required to make <br/>
words at least five letters long, and the kid would get double scores for his <br/>
words (if he&#39;s playing without help). Maybe the kid would be allowed to add <br/>
letters in more than one place per turn, as well. More likely, I&#39;d pull out an <br/>
extra set of Scrabble letters for the kid and me to play a word game on the <br/>
side while I play his dad at Scrabble. Or I&#39;d play as a team with the kid, but <br/>
only if I could figure out how to make him a real partner.<br/>
<br/>
With really young kids (6 and under) we rarely played things where the adults <br/>
had a significant advantage because of experience. We have two stacking <br/>
balancing games - Chairs and Stackrobats, that the kids have ALWAYS been much <br/>
better at than me. When we first started playing them I had a handicap of two <br/>
pieces to each of theirs but that quickly went away. These days I&#39;m considering <br/>
asking for a handicap that lets ME win more often! &lt;g&gt; Set and Bazaar are pattern <br/>
recognition based, our kids could play and win unhandicapped at 7 or so (and <br/>
they consistently beat their grandmother). Kids can play Yahtzee fairly young <br/>
if adults help add (and occasionally offer strategy hints.) <br/>
