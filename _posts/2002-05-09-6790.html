&lt;&lt; So - gee - do we boycott the chain of Methodist Churches or patronize <br/>
them, <br/>
based on their pasts? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The one in California I know best is in or near Milpitas, where my friend <br/>
Cliveden Haas goes.  Their outreach is homosexuality as being natural and <br/>
historically accepted.  The research she has done in studying for the <br/>
ministry taught me LOTS which had been put underground by more recent <br/>
prejudices in our culture.   And the Bible has way more criticism of usury <br/>
(charging interest on loans) than it has against homosexuality.   Those are <br/>
Methodists too.  <br/>
