<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462283616">This was posted on another list that I&#39;m on. It made several points ...mostly about how we <br/>

sense of &quot;knowing&quot; for curiosity can lead to a much fuller life...I appreciated it and thought I&#39;d <br/>
pass the link along.<br/>

smarter than Dr. Phil. :)<br/>
