<div id="ygrps-yiv-131906957">I think I started deschooling in kindergarten.  LOL <br/>
Well, at least I had a head start when I REALLY<br/>
started as a teen, because I never went all the way,<br/>
never played the game.  I REALLY hated school.  I am<br/>
sure some of that was the home issues and the<br/>
depression, but I used to hide under my bed or in the<br/>
attic in the carriage house/garage when I was in<br/>
gradeschool to avoid going.  Even when I was there I<br/>
didn&#39;t do what I was told and seldom did homework.  I<br/>
was a discipline nightmare for the school folks.  heh<br/>
heh<br/>
<br/>
When I got to Middle School, I got REALLY<br/>
uncooperative.  ;-)  <br/>

<br/>
I wish I had a timetable from when the deschooling process is over with<br/>
me.  Zak went to 6 pre-schools and last August when we decided &quot;school&quot;<br/>
wasn&#39;t for us I went through torture on a regular basis about was he<br/>
going to learn anything, should I be &quot;teaching&quot; him etc etc.  Instead I<br/>
joined groups like this, read tons of unschooling web sites, articles<br/>
and books and just allowed myself to feel uncomfortable someday and on<br/>
others know we&#39;d made the best decision.  Zak is a kinesthetic learner<br/>
(just figured this out the other day... Seems I&#39;m not too bright (LOL))<br/>
So being in &quot;school&quot; wouldn&#39;t work for him.  I think that each day that<br/>
goes by I see what he&#39;s learning and how comfortable in himself he is<br/>
with who he is and that seems to be most important.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no support from my family and DH&#39;s family are teachers and say<br/>
nothing (wish mine would keep their mouth&#39;s shut) but we have the<br/>
support of a very large home schooling organization we belong too in<br/>
person and on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Just keep deschooling yourself and things will fall into place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071227305">I came to unschooling later in my parenting life and I&#39;m really interested  <br/>
in/struggling with deschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Has anyone sent their child to compulsory school and then taken them out to  <br/>
unschool? What did the deschooling process look like to you? How did your  <br/>
child do with it? How did you do with it?<br/>
 <br/>
Both of my school aged kids stopped going to school a year ago and we have  <br/>
spent the last year blissfully at home, not under anyone else&#39;s agenda. Yet, <br/>
I&#39;m  still have a hard time with thinking more schoolish stuff should be  done! <br/>
For instance, my son (almost 11), has anxiety about not being able to  write. <br/>
He doesn&#39;t want to work on writing, but when he is faced with the task  (like <br/>
at his beloved summer camp), he freezes. My school side says I should  break <br/>
out a writing curriculum. My unschooling side says differently. I believe  that <br/>
school has created a lot of anxiety in all of us!<br/>
 <br/>
So I guess my question to you is: Is deschooling more for the parents or  the <br/>
kids? Is it a developmental process that will unfold over the years? Does it  <br/>
ever end?<br/>
 <br/>
I would appreciate any deschooling experiences anyone would like to  share.<br/>
<br/>

Mostly parents, it will unfold forever, and parents need to work at  <br/>
it (in themselves), not just wait passively.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307627526">Our son is 13 and attended a public school for 6 years (age 3 through mid third grade)  He has been at home and unschooled since the day we pulled him out.  It has been 4.5 years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say I am still deschooling.   I still find myself reading about dyslexia and dysgraphia when it comes to my attention - though I do not search it out.  I find the brain process fascinating. Maybe some of the reading helps me realize that our son being able to say all 12 months of the year, but never in order is &quot;normal&quot; for his dyslexic brain.  (I cannot say them all without saying them in order)  But through the unschooling / deschooling process I also know that he will either learn it when he needs to or he will learn to use a planner to help him in his adult life (or some other tool to aide himself).  <br/>
<br/>
Our son is 13 and still does not write - well rarely anyway.  There have been a few times within the past couple of months he has spontaneously written several pages documenting some game he played.  He balks at even signing his name - which he had to do to take riding lessons this fall.  He has also taken an interest in reading game guides and Manga books within the past year.  A year ago he was still asking for everything to be read to him; now he will read an entire Manga series or a 100 page game guide (single spaced and size 12 font).<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning he built with legos and anything else he could get his hands on: rocks, sticks, blankets, pillows, furniture, Zomes, boxes, Imaginext, boards. He would spend days and weeks building complex structures in the family room - or digging a hole in the back yard.  He looked at a lot of books - such as eyewitness - learning from pictures and small captions beneath them.  Anything visual was/is up for grabs with him - such as books, videos, movies, documentaries, TV, DVD&#39;s, Board games, computer games, recently he has taken an interest in system games such as Play Station II, Wii, etc.<br/>
(I do believe it was cheaper to dig a hole - ;)<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this was deschooling or unschooling.  He still won&#39;t do anything remotely resembling schooly classes - for example an art class that requires writing as well as construction; but then he talks about college some day - go figure!<br/>

not able to spell begining words- more specifically sight words. He <br/>
was not able to complete ANY worksheets because of this.<br/>

which mostly included typing for chat- I know he is learning to <br/>
spell and a few times has told me that he write down words he uses <br/>
often and then &quot;learns&quot; them.<br/>

We have gone back and forth on if it is my job to &quot;teach&quot; him to <br/>
spell. I have told him that he will either learn to spell things he <br/>
needs or will find a way to survive without spelling.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi--<br/>
<br/>
I have a 12 yo son who stopped going to school in 1st grade.  He has hardly written a lick <br/>
since then--he always hated it, and still isn&#39;t crazy about it.  What he is crazy about is <br/>
gamemaking and wants to take a computer programming class so that he can learn the <br/>
code to create real games of his own.  To do that he needs algebra, so we got the first <br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot; we&#39;ve seen in a while.  It&#39;s actually been great fun to do it together, because <br/>
he has always enjoyed thinking in mathematical ways--and I&#39;m realizing that I enjoyed <br/>
math too until I had a really bad high school math teacher that killed it for me.  Now I have <br/>
described myself as &quot;not a math person.&quot;  I&#39;m actually now seeing that those labels make <br/>
our worlds smaller--deschooling myself through algebra! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when we started he was hesitating writing numbers, and within two days he is <br/>
much more fluent, and my guess is that by the end of this thing he&#39;ll be writing them <br/>
without a hitch--because he&#39;s wanting to do it and enjoying it, and the writing is <br/>
facilitating the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I, not knowing your son of course, think that it is likely that he&#39;ll write when/if it is time to <br/>
write.  In the meantime you could focus on enjoying what IS happening for him.  I know <br/>
from past experience that it is easy to miss some wonderful stuff when I&#39;ve been worried <br/>
and focused on something negative (like a lack of...writing).  Joanna</div>

 </span></blockquote>Playing scrabble is a great way to practice spelling while having fun.  When we play we  use the unabridged dictionary, and we play to see how many words we can get and not neccesarily for a score.  We all have fun and help eachother and look up words together.  I am always the one to get sidetracked with the dictionary and always asking &quot;Did you know that____means_______?&quot;, with whatever new words I find.  But there area many days when I am busy cleaning or doing something and I look up and the kids are reading the dictionary.  When my son was 8 he was looking through the dictionary and making a book of all the animals he could find. <br/>

Ah.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few words I have trouble with and while I&#39;m still  <br/>
confused, I keep them on a note by the computer.  My  kids have seen  <br/>
this, or I tell them.  Sometimes I&#39;ve written down a word they&#39;ve  <br/>
misspelled, and put similar words, and said a very few things about  <br/>
what the differences are and why and then left that 3x5 card or  <br/>
whatever it was on lying around.  They can keep it or leave it lying  <br/>
on the counter a while or whatever.  It does help them see that there  <br/>
are reasons words are spelled as they are, and that everyone can use  <br/>
help sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted to learn to spell, so we got her a hand-held electronic  <br/>
spelling dictionary.  If you spell a word wrong it guesses which  <br/>
words it might be and when you pick the right one it does things---it  <br/>
writes it out in cursive and gives you a definition or a picture.  It  <br/>
was a kid&#39;s spelling game thing from Radio Shack.  You could play  <br/>
Hangman with it, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505646942">I couldn&#39;t resist responding to this...<br/>
   <br/>
  I took both of my girls out of school.<br/>
  My oldest was extremely bored with school from the very start and became very angry in middle school and started to &quot;have lots of trouble going to what she called, &quot;prison&quot;!<br/>
  It really became that type of environment for her!<br/>
  We took her out after completing 9th grade.  I was afraid of  &quot;making the move move&quot;.<br/>
  I could go on and on about how it was the best decision!<br/>
   <br/>
  Well, 13 years later I decided that we should take our older daughter out of school (recently). I was the only one who hesitated to &quot;go for it&quot;.<br/>
  Her situation was very different and she never really enjoyed reading, etc.<br/>
  Within a few weeks my younger daughter has been reading so many amazing books and can not stop.<br/>
  Sometimes she is in the middle of reading 2-3 books at a time.<br/>
  She is finally not only comprehending what she is reading, but is learning and teaching us so much it is almost hard to believe the  wonderful change in her in all ways. Her confidence level has soared to unbelievable heights.<br/>
  I really need to thank Grace Llewelyn for starting our family on this path.<br/>
   <br/>
  In a few days both of my daughters will be going to Grace&#39;s NBTS  Camp and I feel like this will be the start of an even more exciting path for my daughters...<br/>

<br/>
When I was in school as a child I could &quot;read&quot; when we had a group <br/>
of pages to read I read every word- looked up and saw everyone still <br/>
busy so I read it again- sometimes even again but when it was time <br/>
to answer qustions I did not &quot;remember&quot; what I read<br/>
<br/>
Now as an adult i know I read in what I learned from Sandra to be a <br/>
circular fashion and if it is a &quot;deep&quot; book I have to mouth the <br/>
words or say them in my head delibrately. I skim read really fast <br/>
but deep reading is more a concentrated effort.<br/>
<br/>
My mother is a school teacher and the new thing in school is to make <br/>
sure kids are comprehending what they are reading and I mentioned to <br/>
her that though I could read the words (the material probably was <br/>
boring anyway) I did not remember what I read and to answer the <br/>
questions I could not.<br/>
<br/>
So had I been in school today I would have been told I could not <br/>
read at a higher level because I could not comprehend the boring <br/>
things they wanted us to read- But if thye asked me to relate and <br/>
interesting thing I read I bet I could have answered<br/>

high school and instead we are planning for camp.  Yipee!  Going to <br/>
camp is such an accomplishment for her.  When I first asked her <br/>
about it she had not slept away from home in years due to anxiety.  <br/>
We began treatment before she left school and she was still not sure <br/>
if she could do it.  After e-mailing Grace, talking to some kids and <br/>
parents and deciding my mom and I would stay in VT while she was <br/>
there she agreed to try it.  Since then she was able to stay one of <br/>
two nights at youth group camp, spent three nights with my sister <br/>
(planned for 2 then asked to stay another night)and three nights <br/>
with her god mother in another state.  She is still really nervous <br/>
about going but I know she&#39;ll be ok.  SHe started talking about <br/>
being eaten by a moose but I know she&#39;s worried about getting along <br/>
with the other kids.  I&#39;m not worried even a teensie bit though.  I <br/>
plan on having a lovely vacation and then hearing about all her <br/>
adventures.  I am hoping meeting other unschooling teens will help <br/>
her find some motivation and inspire her.  SHe is still struggling <br/>
with being self directed after so many years in school.  I am <br/>
struggling with being supportive without pushing her.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086843433">Both my kids (16 yo boy/9 yo girl) have their own cell phones and  <br/>
neither of them use them much.  I bought the Virgin Mobile $20 every  <br/>

accumulates.  I figure by the time they discover they want or need to  <br/>
use their phones more they&#39;ll have lots of time already paid for.<br/>
<br/>
DS received his phone when he was 14 and traveled to NYC alone (to  <br/>
meet up with Nana and Grappa) for four days in the big city.  I  <br/>
wanted to make sure he could call me anytime he wanted. DD received  <br/>
her phone as a gift from my brother on her 9th birthday - she was  <br/>
envious of her brother&#39;s phone.  It was a coordinated gift for which  <br/>
I agreed to pay for the service. He gave her a sparkly phone case  <br/>
too!  She almost never uses it - forgets to bring it with her - and  <br/>
since she&#39;s not out and about on her own hardly ever, doesn&#39;t have a  <br/>
real need for it.  However, she is more likely to be one to discover  <br/>
the joys of gabbing and texting in the future so I&#39;m glad we&#39;re  <br/>
accumulating time for her now.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I have our own phones too and a third on the same plan that  <br/>
stays at home for when we&#39;re away but the kids are home (technically  <br/>
they could use their own phones but we got that third phone before  <br/>

is his business phone - he had his old landline number ported to his  <br/>
cell phone. We don&#39;t use any landlines now for home or business. I&#39;m  <br/>
not much of a phone gabber myself either - or else this plan might  <br/>

<br/>
We pay $20 a month for unlimited texting on a family plan, so Marty  <br/>
and Holly can text all they want for $10 each a month, basically.   <br/>
It&#39;s cheaper than gasoline.  It&#39;s cheaper than long-distance telephone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an &quot;appetite for texting,&quot; it&#39;s a way to communicate with  <br/>
each other, with their brother in Texas, and with their friends as  <br/>
far away as Rhode Island and Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t get cell phones here  until last year.  We had four  <br/>
computers and two phone lines, though.  Kirby has had a cell phone  <br/>
for three or four years because an anime-club friend of his worked at  <br/>
T-Mobile and gifted him the discounted phone and account he had for  <br/>
being an employee.<br/>
<br/>
I wish we&#39;d had cell phones sooner, but Keith likes to stall on new  <br/>
technology.  It saves money, he figures.  And often we come along  <br/>
just as things have become pretty inexpensive (as we did with CD  <br/>
players and DVD players, spending 1/4 of what our quick-to-technology  <br/>
friends spent).<br/>
<br/>
There seems a harshness to &quot;foot the bill&quot; and &quot;appetite for  <br/>
texting,&quot; though.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t free.<br/>
Children have needs, not just &quot;appetites.&quot;<br/>
Parents SHOULD provide as much as they can for their children, freely  <br/>
and generously and smilingly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 13 yo son hates to write things by hand, but resisted typing tutor<br/>
programs I suggested.  This past year, though, he taught himself to<br/>
type quickly so he could communicate in WOW.  For him, at least,<br/>
computer games have lead to so many skills and connections it would be<br/>
unbelievable...but isn&#39;t that what passions tend to do?  Only the<br/>
current bias against gaming (which I&#39;ll admit I once shared) makes it<br/>
seem surprising.<br/>
<br/>
Recently he started asking me to help him spell every word he wasn&#39;t<br/>
sure of, because he&#39;s playing an online strategy game (Ogame) in which<br/>
the players communicate more via memo and manifesto than in IM chat<br/>
style.  He wanted to be taken seriously, and over the last three<br/>
months his spelling has improved so that he&#39;s pretty much independent<br/>
(and he LOVES complicated words!)<br/>
<br/>
Most recent branch from this tree:  he started writing a novel with a<br/>
setting based on Dungeons and Dragons.  By writing, I mean actually<br/>
sitting and typing page after page -- not, as we&#39;ve done up until now,<br/>
typing a bit until the slow pace drove him crazy and then enlisting me<br/>
to type while he talked.  This was pages of story with action,<br/>
character development, and dialogue...and I firmly believe the ability<br/>
to make his words come to the page entirely on his own is due to his<br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad that the reassurances of so many seasoned online<br/>
unschoolers helped me get over my TV and video/computer game phobias.<br/>
Turns out none of us are addicted, all of us are interested in lots of<br/>
things, and our world is richer than it would otherwise have been.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113770356">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m Shannon, mom to four always-unschooled kids.  They&#39;ve also been drawn to<br/>
Waldorfish stuff, and after much mental struggle as to how to blend the two,<br/>
I strew some of the Waldorf subjects in their path and if they are<br/>
interested we explore what they want.  I was on unschooling.com list for a<br/>
couple of years but accumulated 10,000 messages in my folder and took a<br/>
break to enjoy my kids without getting so bogged down in email.  It tends to<br/>
eke away my independence until I find myself turning to the list to see<br/>
&quot;what the others would do.&quot;  We are from Austin but have lived in the San<br/>
Francisco area for almost eight years and just moved down to San Diego.  I<br/>
would say we&#39;ve had mostly an unschooling life at home too, I don&#39;t believe<br/>
in punishments and we try to guide our home life around respecting each<br/>
other and not being controlling.<br/>
 <br/>
Our move to San Diego took us by surprise and we have been really sad at<br/>
leaving our San Francisco friends.  Also, a month before the move, we lost<br/>
our cat to some unknown illness, suddenly and catastrophically (the girls<br/>
petted her good bye by sticking their arms through a hole in the wall of an<br/>
oxygenated tank, plugging the gaps with a jacket because the first time we<br/>
tried, enough oxygen seeped out so that she began thrashing).  So, we&#39;ve all<br/>
been depressed and I&#39;ve held off introducing myself because I&#39;m not up for<br/>
any additional challenges or grilling.  <br/>
 <br/>
In the middle of all of this, my oldest daughter (just turned 11) said she<br/>
wants to go to school.  She&#39;d wanted to try school once before and we found<br/>
a place that would let her go for a day, and after visiting she didn&#39;t want<br/>
to go any more (she didn&#39;t want to have to get up early).  I feel her<br/>
wanting to go to school is related to moving away from all of her friends<br/>
and being unhappy - however it isn&#39;t surprising to me as she&#39;s very<br/>
gregarious and would fall right in to being chatty and acquiring a circle of<br/>
groupies.  One reason she wants to go is to make friends.  Another is that<br/>
she is simply curious about school.  I do believe she would get tired of it<br/>
sooner or later, as she picks up knowledge quickly and gets bored easily.  I<br/>
have always believed in respecting their choices and this will be a hard<br/>
pill to swallow if she does go.  With this recent thread on school, I felt<br/>
ready to send my introduction.<br/>
 <br/>
Take care,<br/>
Shannon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-612580514">I&#39;ve brought this to start a new thread, because it&#39;s a point that hasn&#39;t been made here for a long while:<br/>
<br/>
-=- By that I mean that when we began to deschool<br/>
during the summer past, both my husband and I had agreed to unschool and I<br/>
had him read through Sandra&#39;s site. We were on fire about this unschooling<br/>
adventure, but then... my husband began to feel it wouldn&#39;t hurt to &quot;push&quot;<br/>
the reading a bit or a better word &quot;encourage&quot; it wouldn&#39;t hurt to<br/>
encourage our 7 year old to read more. She is still in the process of<br/>
&quot;getting&quot; it which is what I learned during this thread and not long after,<br/>
the workbooks began. Before we knew it, they &quot;had&quot; to do workbooks before<br/>
they could get screen time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
While parents can begin to deschool during the summer, kids who have been in school or who have been doing school at home cannot deschool in the summer.  It doesn&#39;t work, and it&#39;s not fair to even consider it.<br/>
<br/>
When a kid &quot;does school&quot; for &quot;a year&quot; (a school year), the biggest reward is that vacation (maybe only a month in France or the UK, but nearly three months in the U.S.  And that is THEIRS.  A designated time off.   <br/>
<br/>
Deschooling can only begin after school would have started.  So using workbooks at or near the start of school means zero deschooling for that child AND adds to the schol time from which the child will need to recover.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233249835">We had been homeschooling before we began to deschool.  We now are on our<br/>
second year of them being home. I do see your point though, and in addition<br/>
can see that in fact, there was no deschooling on our part because we did<br/>
continue to do workbooks, right?<br/>
I guess I thought that because she didn&#39;t go to a public school,<br/>
deschooling didn&#39;t apply. She went to a Waldorf school which uses Rudolf<br/>
Steiner&#39;s methods, which I fulishly thought that because it was so freeing<br/>
and so focused in the arts, deschooling wouldn&#39;t be needed.<br/>
Of course I don&#39;t feel that way now, and actually feel like I have to<br/>
double deschool, because the waldorf school is all about staying away from<br/>
media, games, tv, radio... its all about shielding them from the outside<br/>
world so they can imagine, and create a world of their own. Which I also do<br/>
like in a way, but I will rather leave it up to them to choose what they&#39;d<br/>
rather do. We are taking one day at a time, and slowly step by step we will<br/>
be where they want to be.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An image of children creating their own worlds from pristine imaginations is pretty but false. Ultimately that desire is more about creating circumstances to produce what the adults want to see from children than what fuels the child&#39;s imagination and creativity. <br/>
<br/>
Creative people build on the creativity of others. They take in others&#39; ideas from a variety of sources, mix them with their own thoughts and experiences and produce something that&#39;s uniquely theirs. When creative people are young, it will often look like copying. They&#39;ll be playing with other&#39;s ideas. Eventually it will become their own as they change it and build on it and experience more of life and more of others&#39; creativity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154350956">-=- actually feel like I have to<br/>
double deschool, because the waldorf school is all about staying away from<br/>
media, games, tv, radio... its all about shielding them from the outside<br/>
world so they can imagine, and create a world of their own.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Building a fantasy world based on a fantasy world doesn&#39;t prepare people to live in the  real world.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- Which I also do<br/>
like in a way, but I will rather leave it up to them to choose what they&#39;d<br/>
rather do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very appealing, to live in a fairy-tale forest, with silk scarves and recorder music and gnomes.  It prepares people to grow up and be disadvantaged in a world full of movies, the internet, and rock&#39;n&#39;roll.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my children to be disadvantaged.  They hear recorder music (my husband and I both play) and they can play all they want with the idea of gnomes and fairies and angels.  They can play with cloth AND gameboys.  <br/>
<br/>
But until a child can honestly and truly make choices about what to explore, in the house, among things the family aready has access to, and trust that the parents aren&#39;t going to remove that option, unschooling doesn&#39;t begin to work.  Then the choices start to be broader and further afield--where to go, what to collect, what to value.  If the parents are weighting academic things more than &quot;fun things,&quot; unschooling doesn&#39;t take hold.<br/>
