<div id="ygrps-yiv-757407824">-=-Hi. I have a 20 month girl. Besides reading to her and playing are  <br/>
there any skills i can start nurturing in her? What do you suggest we  <br/>
could be doing at this age? (my main language is Spanish, hope yo get  <br/>
what i mean).-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This question should have a different topic (though I know it might  <br/>
have had some responses on the other one; that&#39;s fine).<br/>
<br/>
The notes from today&#39;s chat on young children will be here:<br/>

<br/>
With a 20 month old, I think carry her as much as she wants to be  <br/>
carried, let her walk as much as she wants to and not a step further.   <br/>
I hate to see people holding a kid who wants down, or telling a baby  <br/>
&quot;you can walk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Find lots of things she can touch and pick up and hold.  There will be  <br/>
lots of suggestions at the link above pretty soon, too.<br/>
<br/>
