I teach early childhood music ed, and voice.  I also play a little piano<br/>
(mother taught piano).  I have been brought up in a very traditional<br/>
classical method of instruction and find that it has a lot of limits (I put<br/>
this lightly!).  My experience with the kids is that if music is played, it<br/>
will be enjoyed, and spark an interest.  Play music from every culture,<br/>
every genre, every tempo etc.But most of all, enjoy it by moving to it,<br/>
getting some rhythm instruments (no knowledge necessary, really) and playing<br/>
along, and incorporating it into family events etc.<br/>

Here is a link to a wonderful author of children&#39;s improvisation books.  The<br/>
only book I have used is the one for children on the piano.  The concept is<br/>
that the child can make wonderful improvised music as a means to tell a<br/>
story, or create a mood.  The book is very easy to follow, and the child<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to have any piano training what-so-ever.  It is based on the<br/>
idea that music is a creative act which anyone can perform.  This is very<br/>
different from the view that music cannot be played until you have &quot;learned&quot;<br/>
how to read music, or have been given the proper training.  I have used this<br/>
with my students, and they LOVE it!<br/>

I also use drums in my classes.  Drums were probably the first instrument<br/>
man used, using bones and skulls from dead mammals.  There are good books on<br/>
how to use a simple hand drum, and it is quite easy for a non-musician to<br/>
learn to play.  People who feel comfortable on a drum have many resources to<br/>
play these days.  Drum circles are more common now than ever, and students<br/>
who have had teachers introduce them to drumming have thanked them immensely<br/>
for giving them something that can help them connect not only to music, but<br/>
to community, and spirituality.  Drumming is something that is done all over<br/>
the world, in every culture, and is closely tied to almost every religious<br/>
tradition.  Here is a link to a few drumming resources:<br/>

I am getting ready to perform in a St. Patrick&#39;s day gig.  I usually sing<br/>
and play spoons.  My girlfriend taught me how to play the spoons, and it is<br/>
great fun. She learned as a child growing up in an Irish household where all<br/>
the kids learned to play them (at their wedding, her sister brought a huge<br/>
bag, full of spoons, and everyone had so much fun!).  This year, I have been<br/>
asked to pick up the Bohdrun (Irish drum).  I didn&#39;t realize how fun it<br/>
would be!  I am using a video to learn, and it is working well.  But what is<br/>
more fun, is that my son is now playing along with me.  He tends to want to<br/>
keep the video on long after I am done.  People often assume that my son<br/>
will become a musician since both his parents are.  I don&#39;t agree.  But I<br/>
know that he really enjoys listening to it and will often grab an egg shaker<br/>
or drum when we are playing, and I see how happy he is when he does!<br/>
