<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; These are the names Holly has collected to name her children.  She asked me<br/>
&gt; to share them here and see if people had other ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my strong-willed sister was having her first baby, she wanted the name<br/>
Esmerelde (Ez-mer-EL-duh) for a girl.<br/>
<br/>
My dear late grandmother smiled and told her she could name her child<br/>
anything she wanted, and doubtless she would.  However, she recommended that<br/>
she stand at the back door to her home and scream the name 30 times at the<br/>
top of her lungs, because that&#39;s how she was gonna hear it for the next 18<br/>
years of her life.<br/>
<br/>
Her sons are named Robert and Terry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good advice. I always thought that I wanted my kids&#39; names to flow together <br/>
smoothly and kept trying out, &quot;C&#39;mon, guys, let&#39;s go to Trevor and Brenna&#39;s <br/>
house!&quot; to see how it sounded.<br/>

<br/>
A friend told me he let the older brother name his little brother, because <br/>
the big brother would be the one to call the little one when Daddy said, <br/>
&quot;Jonathan, go get your brother.&quot;  :)<br/>
