<div id="ygrps-yiv-882230185">Do any of you know whether it would be a problem for me to sell audio tapes <br/>
in Canada at this conference I&#39;m going to?  <br/>
<br/>
maybe I should just not even bother...<br/>
<br/>
If people write me Canadian checks that could be undoable.  If they use cash <br/>
or American funds...<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just too much frustration.<br/>
<br/>
And would I consider exchange rate?  They go for $6 American.   If that works <br/>
out to $7.17 or something should I care?<br/>
<br/>
And if I leave the country with more money than I took in do I have to share <br/>
it with anybody?  <br/>
<br/>
My enthusiasm is shakey.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Might want to just have order forms to hand out.  People could give or mail<br/>
them back to you, and then you&#39;d mail them when you got home.  Then they<br/>
might or might not (depending on the conjunction of the planets or<br/>
something) have to pay duty when they got them.  I think on that amount we<br/>
don&#39;t, but we do get charged a brokerage fee of about $5 for parcels coming<br/>
in now.  Of course if you write Gift on the parcel . . .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the amount is something like over $10,000 coming back to Canada.  It<br/>
would be a similar amount going your way, so it isn&#39;t likely you&#39;d need to<br/>
worry about that.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

That would be true.  <br/>
The Certificates of Empowerment are for sure just for handing out.<br/>
<br/>
$9.   That&#39;s a lot.  Maybe I just won&#39;t take any at all.  less work for me if <br/>
I don&#39;t have to sit at a booth.  But still a little sad not to get to do that.<br/>

asking people to pay for them.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>

When I go down to see my mother, it usually costs me at least $150 Canadian<br/>
for every $100 US that I buy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that depends where you live in each country.  Cost of living and<br/>
minimum wage differs widely.  For instance, my daughter and her family pay<br/>
$1350 rent.  In other parts of Canada that would rent a mansion.  I imagine<br/>
it varies widely across the States as well.  It used to be that we would<br/>
plan on shopping when we were down for a visit.  Now we don&#39;t bother because<br/>
of the difference in the dollar.<br/>

quarter million here will buy you ... well if you could *find* something it<br/>
would be weensy and rundown. I sent Sandra a copy of our town newspaper and<br/>
she was pretty stunned by the prices! ;-)<br/>
