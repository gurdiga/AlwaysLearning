I am very passionate about unschooling too but I&#39;ve also learned that most<br/>
people just don&#39;t want to hear about it.  I think it just rocks their world<br/>
too much.  I am happy and willing to share how it all works for us with<br/>
anyone who really wants to understand, but I&#39;ve just stopped talking about<br/>
it with people who just want to bitch about school/their kids but not really<br/>
do anything about it.  I also find that I can think of great examples and<br/>
explain unschooling well to people who are open to learning about it, but<br/>
when they are hostile, I clam up and can&#39;t say what I really mean.  I feel<br/>
better about myself in those circumstances when I just don&#39;t bother to say<br/>
anything.<br/>

<br/>
No, but I don&#39;t express it very often to people who are still invested in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I liked school, did well, went straight to college, graduated as quickly as I <br/>
could and taught immediately.  I was invested bigtime, in those days.  I <br/>
understand the perspective of being inside school so deeply that the entire <br/>
horizon is school-filled and school-related, and those things that can&#39;t be related <br/>
to school in any way recede into the dark and small edges of &quot;not important&quot; <br/>
or &quot;ignorance.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ah.<br/>
In such cases I say &quot;You don&#39;t have to send them; you could homeschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they sputter even a little bit, I can really calmly tell them it&#39;s been <br/>
great for my family.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really interesting now that lots of my friends from when we had babies <br/>
and toddlers together also have teens.  Some of them were super-smug for a long <br/>
time, and some still are because their kids are on scholarship somewhere <br/>
(always in other states... hmmm...) but it&#39;s like leapfrog, because sometimes they <br/>
have a brag, and other times I do.  <br/>
<br/>
One friend from high school lives in a fancier state in a rich neighborhood <br/>
with a hot-shot husband, and her kids were like magically perfect for a long <br/>
time, but lately... bad stories andights stuff.  But he lives in a house with <br/>
several other young males and they are wilder than she wishes, I think.   And <br/>
the other sibling will have to make some serious life changes not to be seen as <br/>
a loss and a failure.  So to that mom, I say nothing whatsoever.  <br/>

<br/>
Age helped me.<br/>
Not going to local playgroup  meetings at all helped too. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I just couldn&#39;t deal with new homeschoolers who weren&#39;t very nice to their <br/>
kids and wanted me to sympathize about how hard it is to make kids do work.  I <br/>
just quit going altogether rather than pour my energy down a hole, as it seemed <br/>
sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
I personally don&#39;t do school-bashing conversations or how-to-get-them-to...<br/>
conversations with homeschoolers. I walk away and don&#39;t listen. This is for<br/>
my own peace of mind. If asked by schoolers, I say &quot;we homeschool&quot;. I don&#39;t<br/>
do too much defending of it, but that may be partly because Jayn is so young<br/>
(5.5).<br/>
<br/>
If someone is *genuinely* interested I will answer *genuine* questions, not<br/>
critical statements hidden as a question (&quot;don&#39;t you think that...&quot;) with<br/>
passion and enthusiasm, and refer them to one of the two State wide<br/>
organizations here in CA (usually people are querying the legality in the<br/>
first instance) and my local group. <br/>
<br/>
The only people who ask about Unschooling are in my local group. This falls<br/>
into two categories: people who don&#39;t know we Unschool and are asking what<br/>
materials or curriculum we use to teach something so generally get a short<br/>
explanation, and people who do know and are curious about a specific thing.<br/>
I am getting more - a lot more - of the latter as Jayn grows.<br/>
<br/>
My dh has had more experience with outside people asking him about<br/>
Unschooling because he is more vocal, and in-your-face about how bad school<br/>
is, with the (mostly) men he chats to. A lot of his conversations are along<br/>
the lines of &quot;do remember when you were at school and it was really<br/>
crappy...&quot;<br/>

<h4>Chris Swift</h4>
<time> 1 Jun 2005, at  1:35am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435491441">Hello<br/>
<br/>
My name is Chris Swift. I live in Oxfordshire, England and I&#39;ve just joined<br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really pleased to see the comments in this thread.<br/>
Pleased to see that people share the same experiences as us but saddened by<br/>
most people&#39;s reaction to home education/schooling.<br/>
<br/>
The only people , with rare exception, I&#39;ve found to be genuinely interested<br/>
in home education when the subject is raised are teachers.<br/>
<br/>
My partner works in educational literature so between us we meet quite a few<br/>
state teachers. Much as I dislike school I am growing more sympathetic to<br/>
teachers, every teacher we&#39;ve mentioned it to has without exception said<br/>
something like &#39;great, individual attention, and you can&#39;t get anyone more<br/>
knowing about a child&#39;s needs, abilities and capabilities than their own<br/>
parents&#39;, they then quite often will go on about that they really would like<br/>
to more teaching, less handling of large disruptive classes and ticking<br/>
boxes set down by the educational authorities.<br/>
<br/>
When people are suprised and express interest in Home Education I now<br/>
generally shut down, I know from experience almost certaintly what comes<br/>
next, how will they cope when they get out in the real world etc. How do you<br/>
do lessons, why don&#39;t you get a job ? etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
My partner is a lot more polite than me, she will patiently explain what<br/>
home education/ schooling is, and patiently counter all the arguments<br/>
against.<br/>
<br/>
It is me at home with the kids and I really feel like saying, &quot;It&#39;s not my<br/>
problem that you care that little about your children&#39;s education that you<br/>
haven&#39;t even considered Home Education/ Schooling, here&#39;s a book if you&#39;re<br/>
really interested.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would get very cynical about it except that I know Home Education /<br/>
Schooling is increasing, perhaps we&#39;re just mixing with the wrong sort of<br/>
people !<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154944353">I think that there is a vast difference in home education in the UK<br/>
and that in the U.S.  My experience may be colored by the fact that we<br/>
moved from Albuquerque, NM (where there are lots of homeschoolers and<br/>
unschoolers) to the Northeast of England (Durham) and not to somewhere<br/>
like Devon or Dorset or London, or for that matter, looking at the EO<br/>
contact list, Oxfordshire.  So, maybe my experience in the U.S.<br/>
spoiled me for life in the north of England.  Maybe by sheer<br/>
population density of homeschoolers I was able to find more<br/>
like-minded people in Albuquerque than I can find around here.<br/>
<br/>
There are three groups of home-educator that I see up here: the first<br/>
and largest are the reactive home-educators.  Those home-educators who<br/>
took their child out of school because they were bullied so badly that<br/>
the child became suicidal or whose child has a special needs issue<br/>
that the schools weren&#39;t adequately addressing.  These families are<br/>
very interested in following a curriculum.  Their reasons for pulling<br/>
out of school have nothing to do with the educational structure, but<br/>
with the deleterious social aspects for their own child.  So, they<br/>
mimic the school structure:  very carefully following some sort of<br/>
structured system.  I know one family whose son is working more than<br/>
40 hours a week preparing for GCSE through some accelerated program<br/>
which means he has no time for much else in his life.  The family&#39;s<br/>
stated priority is making sure that at 16 their son will be able to<br/>
get a job, or get into a college that will get him into a University<br/>
that will get him into a job.<br/>
<br/>
The second type I know home-educate for religious reasons.  Schools<br/>
have too much going on about evolution and don&#39;t prioritize family<br/>
over state.  Again, this philosophy has nothing to do with throwing<br/>
off the bonds of curriculum based education.  There are more<br/>
alternative approaches: the vicar&#39;s family who use a Charlotte Mason<br/>
approach and love to brag about how they have no television; the<br/>
Mormon mother who upon first meeting told me that she had an<br/>
unschooling lean to her approach, by which she meant that she would<br/>
allow her children to stay with a subject for longer than she had<br/>
planned if they were really interested, say hieroglyphics, and who<br/>
told me to shut-up once when I said that my children would be more<br/>
interested in playing with their friends than in being organized into<br/>
activities by their friends parents.  But the discussions that I read<br/>
references to on the e-mail lists suggest that everyone wants to<br/>
compare their curriculum and their workbooks and their approaches to<br/>
numeracy and literacy whatever their alternative to the national<br/>
curriculum may be.<br/>
<br/>
The third type is the truly alternative type.  The people who are<br/>
choosing to home-educate because it fits in with their lifestyle<br/>
choices.  They have nutritionists and holistic therapists and are<br/>
vegan, or wish they had the dedication to be, and insist that their<br/>
children be vegan as well.  They have conversations about what kind of<br/>
blood type diet they should be on. As parents the key educational<br/>
lesson they seem to want to give is that sharing is the most important<br/>
thing.  If any item is in question they will give it to someone not<br/>
their child as it is more important that they teach their child to<br/>
defer their own needs to someone else&#39;s than that they (the parent)<br/>
take the time to help the other child or their own to come up with a<br/>
compromise or some alternative play.  In my experience the children<br/>
from these backgrounds are less socially adept, less sure of<br/>
themselves.  If they get something that they really enjoy they hide it<br/>
and fight for it and hope that the argument stays quiet enough that<br/>
their parents don&#39;t notice and take away the coveted item.  There is<br/>
egotism to this kind of home-education that the other two don&#39;t seem<br/>
to have as much of, a sense that home-education was less about helping<br/>
their child and more about adding to their alternative legitimacy,<br/>
like a tattoo or a tongue stud or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
But these are all generalities and bitter generalities at that.  I<br/>
find that there are people who are interested in our approach to<br/>
home-education.  But they are more interested in Singapore Maths or in<br/>
discussing what Charlotte Mason meant by an enlightened education (or<br/>
whatever it is). Being religious or vegan or having a child who was<br/>
bullied isn&#39;t a predisposition to curriculum, but they are a different<br/>
philosophical approach to life that may not end up with unschooling. <br/>
They may not be philosophies that lead to questioning the status quo<br/>
enough to embrace the idea that learning is in everything and that<br/>
children are people and that it is at least as important to love and<br/>
listen to your own child as it is to get 5 A&#39;s at A-level or save a<br/>
whale or whatever.  And they may not be philosophies that allow them<br/>
to ever prioritize their child&#39;s interests over their god&#39;s or over<br/>
that child&#39;s possible future or an animal&#39;s interests.  <br/>
<br/>
It is hard to look at a lifestyle that is by its very nature<br/>
oppositional to your own and stay calm.  I don&#39;t talk about what we do<br/>
or don&#39;t do anymore.  I am very rarely asked about it, and when I am<br/>
it is by people who already know what we do and may want to get me<br/>
going down some very entertaining rant.  I&#39;m good at rants.  But, if I<br/>
start to talk about how much we enjoy television, or bring crisps and<br/>
candy to the group meet-ups, or talk about Tales of Symphonia it<br/>
becomes more and more threatening to their deeply entrenched beliefs<br/>
about food and television and leisure time activities.  <br/>

============<br/>
 <br/>
I was at a conference like that once, where it seemed that the REALLY  <br/>
important things were not the children themselves.  It&#39;s rough, because  sometimes <br/>
the parents are the really needy ones and they NEED other adults to  approve <br/>
and endorse them, and will use their kids to get that approval.   It&#39;s easy for <br/>
me to see that by working (and it IS work sometimes) to make  sure my kids <br/>
have the space and time to be themselves and grow in the world in  natural, calm, <br/>
non-jittery, non-frightened, non-wounded ways, it will help  them NOT be the <br/>
kind of desperate parents who need popularity and strokes to  feel alive or <br/>
right.<br/>
 <br/>

to ever prioritize  their child&#39;s interests over their god&#39;s or over<br/>

<br/>
And if they perceive (or are told by their leaders) that it&#39;s in God&#39;s  <br/>
interest, the animals&#39; or the child&#39;s possible future&#39;s interest  for the  child to <br/>
STOP being homeschooled now, slam-o, there they&#39;ll go back into  school.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Deeply entrenched, or just inflexible and not-to-be-examined?<br/>
Some of those beliefs I&#39;ve seen that seem deeply entrenched in others  turn <br/>
out to be like rent-a-center furniture.  Looks good, but not really  theirs, <br/>
and if they WERE to pay it off it would&#39;ve cost way, way more than it  was ever <br/>
worth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When we first started homeschooling, I would get questions from store clerks<br/>
and the like when we were out during school hours.  Now, I never seem to get<br/>
any questions from anybody.  I think much is communicated in people&#39;s body<br/>
language and general attitude.  When we first started I was vulnerable and<br/>
was subconsciously inviting folks to ask me questions.  I seemed to say, &quot;Go<br/>
ahead and ask your toughest Homeschool question.  I got my 60 second stories<br/>
and by goodness I&#39;m going to use them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now when I do get the occasional inquiry, I usually am genuinely excited<br/>
about what any one of our family members is engaged in at the moment that we<br/>
get off the subject of homeschooling/unschooling per say and are on to<br/>
discussing our specific interests.  I find that this accomplishes a few<br/>
things at once: It allows them to implicitly make their own conclusions<br/>
about unschooling without right out telling them, it makes them feel good,<br/>
and finally, it makes me feel good.  Mind you, I don&#39;t always respond this<br/>
way.  Some days, I say to heck with it and pour out my point on the matter<br/>
of school (usually when I have heard about a recent suicide or something.)<br/>
Those are bad days and I&#39;m sure with age and maturity I will find a more<br/>
graceful way of handling this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493944589">I am on digest so this is a multiple reply to two<br/>
messages.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do you find that if/when you express this to others<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;No, but I don&#39;t express it very often to people who<br/>
&gt;are still invested in school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to do that as well.  I guess part of my problem<br/>
is that I am somewhat autistic (Aspergers if you<br/>
really need a label) and I have a hard time &quot;reading&quot;<br/>
people&#39;s sincerity level or underlying motives or<br/>
unspoken messages.  I also have a hard time knowing<br/>
how much is too much information in diffrent setings<br/>
and how much is not enough.  I tend to just share<br/>
what&#39;s in my heart and mind in a passionate way and as<br/>
politely as I can, and this leads me into trouble<br/>
sometimes.  It&#39;s mainly a big hairy scary mess for me<br/>
to navigate conversations with near strangers or<br/>
acquaitances.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Age helped me.<br/>
&gt;Not going to local playgroup  meetings at all helped<br/>
&gt;too. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, ok so now I feel better about not going to those<br/>
things.  Here I have been feeling guilty (well, sort<br/>
of, a teensy bit) because I am not much of a joiner<br/>
and avoid local playgroups and other more organized<br/>
groups (like Campfire and so forth.)  Not only does<br/>
socializing en masse look REALLY unattractive to me,<br/>
but neither of my kids, nor my husband is the least<br/>
bit interested in it either.  We&#39;d much rather do<br/>
things with small groups of real friends, one or two<br/>
families, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just quit going altogether rather than pour my<br/>
&gt;energy down a hole, as it seemed sometimes.<br/>
&gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy I hear that.  That&#39;s why I mostly stopped doing<br/>
those things 6 or so years ago as well.  It gets<br/>
lonely though.  We&#39;re fairly new to a huge and<br/>
sparsely populated rural county and when you add<br/>
unschooling and autism to the plate (my oldest is<br/>
autistic as well) it&#39;s really hard to find anyone to<br/>
talk to honestly at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I admit to allowing people to believe that we<br/>
homeschool because my older son has &quot;special needs&quot;<br/>
including some life threatening allergies.  We really<br/>
don&#39;t.  I knew I was going to unschool before they<br/>
were born, some 15 years ago.  I have just been more<br/>
passionate about it for about 10 years (since I have<br/>
had kids.)  It&#39;s easier though, with people who really<br/>
don&#39;t care, who are entrenched and invested, as Sandra<br/>
described, or who just don&#39;t get it.  I can&#39;t always<br/>
determine who those folks are for a while though, and<br/>
sometimes I just automatically correct their mistaken<br/>
assumption by reflex, or because it feels dishonest to<br/>
me to let them labor under delusions.  But really,<br/>
they are THEIR delusions, not mine.  I didn&#39;t create<br/>
them or fuel them so I guess I should not be so<br/>
selfish about letting them have them. <br/>

Right, about letting it go a lot of times--me too.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is really happy in the conversation and they think we &quot;work hard&quot; <br/>
and the kids  are probably ahead of grade level, and they&#39;re joyous in that <br/>
moment, I usually  make one small disclaimer, like &quot;It&#39;s not so hard the way we <br/>
do it,&quot; or &quot;the main thing is we really like each other,&quot; and let all the rest <br/>
go, especially if it&#39;s someone I&#39;ll never see again.<br/>
<br/>
Now if the someone I&#39;ll never see again is at a homeschooling convention of <br/>
any sort (general or unschooling, I mean, as I don&#39;t go to other sorts &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
they get to hear more because, well, there they are in the range of having come <br/>
a long way to be in a specific place to commune with general homeschoolers or <br/>
unschoolers, and then I&#39;m openly honest and detailed if they seem to be <br/>
harboring delusions.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Some days, I say to heck with it and pour out my point on the matter<br/>
of school (usually when I have heard about a recent suicide or something.)<br/>
Those are bad days and I&#39;m sure with age and maturity I will find a more<br/>
graceful way of handling this. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes grace is not called for.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s on her fourth &quot;yeah, but&quot; and they&#39;re defending the <br/>

<br/>
I have regularly and with good result used stories of two suicides among my <br/>
own friends when people say anything about school being safe or about the light <br/>
frolick and banter among happy schoolmates (idealized wishes and hopes about <br/>
how nice and innocent kids are at school), so I&#39;ve never had to wait for <br/>
another school shooting to get a boost on that one.<br/>
<br/>
Those suicides come out sometimes when someone is saying, &quot;Well my kids just <br/>
have to do what I tell them to do, they don&#39;t have any choice.&quot;   AHA... the <br/>
big choice.  &quot;Outahere.&quot;   They do have a choice, and parents and other kids <br/>

<br/>
Well, the parents are having fun, and in most people&#39;s universes, that&#39;s <br/>
what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
As part of a description for a talk at a conference (for which they had at <br/>
first scheduled no presenter, just figured someone would fill in, because <br/>
hey--it&#39;s only unschooling) this was written:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you are an <br/>
<br/>
unschooler, or interested in becoming one, join this audience <br/>
<br/>
participation forum and meet others who unschool too. Share what&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
working and what isn&#39;t. Can you really be an unschooler if [fill in the <br/>
<br/>
blanks]? And does it matter, if it&#39;s working for you? Do unschoolers <br/>
<br/>
ever tell their children to do something? Find out!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So clearly the &quot;unschoolers&quot; they&#39;re talking about are adults (do they ever <br/>
tell their children to do something?) and so in the &quot;does it matter, if it&#39;s <br/>
working for you?&quot; the &quot;YOU&quot; for whom it might be working just fine is clearly <br/>
the parent.   Is it not working for the children?  Too bad.  They have no choice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite a simple concept, and harder to pull off than it looks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654266224">I live in a fairly homeschool-friendly place, but there are few <br/>
unschoolers.  I rarely get questioned about homeschooling.  I imagine <br/>
when people see me out with the kids during the day, they just assume <br/>
that we are homeschoolers.  Many of my fellow homeschoolers  are on a <br/>
local unschooling list (it&#39;s eclectic, really, but called an unschooling <br/>
group) and read the bunches of articles and info that I send to the <br/>
list.  I guess they know what unschooling is about, and they just don&#39;t ask.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when I get questions, or my children get questions.  The <br/>
most often asked is &quot;what grade are you in?&quot;  We have two answers to <br/>
this one....&quot;well, I&#39;m ____yo so if I were in school I would be in <br/>
____grade.&quot;  And the simpler and more correct &quot;We don&#39;t do grades.&quot;  <br/>
When I have to fill out forms for the kids and their grade is asked, I <br/>
always leave it blank.  I still haven&#39;t figured out why this is such an <br/>
important questions that so many people ask it.<br/>
<br/>
Another one that comes up often is &quot;do you use a curriculum?&quot;  My answer <br/>
here is &quot;No, we use the library, the internet, the tv, and we play games <br/>
a lot.&quot;  I suppose it&#39;s not really a direct answer, but technically, <br/>
it&#39;s what we would claim if we were ever questioned by authorities.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m asked if we take a break for the summer, I smile and say &quot;We <br/>
are learning all the time!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love when I get questioned.  People who have problems with the concept <br/>
aren&#39;t going to change my mind or threaten me, and who knows if I might <br/>
plant a seed somewhere?<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d like to chime in with a &quot;me too&quot; on the timer necessity.  It&#39;s <br/>
nice to know I&#39;m not alone.  It boggles my mind how I could spend an <br/>
hour preparing something only to forget it was even in the oven.<br/>

I had my car inspected yesterday and we were talking with the really nice<br/>

vacation!&quot;  And my youngest (8 but is small for her age) said, &quot;We don&#39;t go<br/>
to school.&quot; (kids are 8 and 10) And he thinking maybe they weren&#39;t old<br/>
enough yet said, &quot;When will you go to school?&quot;  And she said, &quot;never.&quot;  LOL!<br/>
And so I stepped in and said, &quot;We homeschool.&quot;  And he said, &quot;Oh, so you do<br/>
do school. (and with a little awe in his voice for my dedication and<br/>
perseverance added) Gee, you not only stay home with your kids but you also<br/>
teach them as well.  You are one busy lady!&quot;  I chuckled and said, &quot;sortof<br/>
kindof.&quot; And I let it go at that and the conversation moved on.  I really<br/>
wanted to add that life it pretty easy and enjoyable for us.  We ride our<br/>
horse all the time and hang out at the barn and yesterday we sat in our new<br/>
soft sided (cheap but wonderful) pool and watched the school buses drive by.<br/>
It was so beautiful out and we felt so grateful sitting there feeling the<br/>
coolness of the water after being in the hot sun at the barn.  People<br/>
envision that it takes a lot of dedication and hard work to homeschool. If<br/>
they only knew how thoroughly enjoyable and easy it is for us, they would<br/>
probably die.  But it&#39;s so hard to explain in 5 minutes how it all works, so<br/>
I don&#39;t usually bother anymore. <br/>

I was recently asked what my children DO.<br/>
<br/>
I went on and on and on about Cameron (17) and his filming and drumming <br/>
and music and art---and his new love of histories and words and other <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Then this woman asked what Duncan (9) was into. I stopped short, <br/>
knowing that it wasn&#39;t as inspiring as Cameron&#39;s interests. But I still <br/>
gabbed on, saying that Duncan was into video games and word games and <br/>
computer games and board games and card games and paper games and math <br/>
games and water/pool games.<br/>
<br/>
I had this sudden realization that Duncan learns through GAMES! And <br/>
WHAT A WAY TO LEARN!!!! How COOL to think that learning is SO much fun! <br/>
I got his huge smile on my face as I got this.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is so incredibly neat that he has this opportunity---and <br/>
that he finds his learning that way!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s Dunc&#39;s &quot;curriculum&quot;---games! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I might say &quot;We learn all year, at a relaxed pace.&quot;  (Then anyone who sees my seeming idleness during the &quot;school year&quot; might feel less justified in busting me for laxness.)<br/>

&gt; I had this sudden realization that Duncan learns through GAMES! And<br/>
&gt; WHAT A WAY TO LEARN!!!! How COOL to think that learning is SO much fun!<br/>
&gt; I got his huge smile on my face as I got this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it is so incredibly neat that he has this opportunity---and<br/>
&gt; that he finds his learning that way!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s Dunc&#39;s &quot;curriculum&quot;---games! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL Early on, I planned on using lots of games with my children for <br/>
their learning.  I thought this would be a great way to &quot;get them&quot; to <br/>
learn things, and in addition, I find learning games a whole lot less <br/>
boring to play than other games intended for children.  Before I planned <br/>
on home/unschooling, I bought games with the intention of helping my <br/>
children excel and be know-it-alls once they got to school.  They would <br/>
already know how to read, how to add and subtract, etc...  Boy did I get <br/>
an education!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
They did learn from games - they just didn&#39;t learn the things I thought <br/>
they&#39;d learn from the games I bought.  For example, Scrabble Jr. was to <br/>
have my eldest spelling and reading, but instead it helped my second and <br/>
third (in different ways, 3 years apart) learn every letter of the <br/>
alphabet.  It amazed me to watch how they both used that game when they <br/>
wanted to learn their letters.  Zane (my second) used it playing with <br/>
his brother, doing what they do best, trading and &quot;coniving&quot;, which is <br/>
not really part of the game.  Every time a letter was traded (I&#39;ll trade <br/>
you a T for a B), it reinforced the names of the letters.  McKenna, my <br/>
third, played mostly independently, simply matching the letters to to <br/>
board and when she wasn&#39;t sure of one, she would ask.  Over the course <br/>
of a week in which she played every day, she became sure of every <br/>
letter, the game was put away and hasn&#39;t been brought out again since.<br/>
<br/>
So now, I hope, I realize that they will find games to help them learn <br/>
what they want to learn, when they want to learn it, and I don&#39;t have <br/>
ulterior motives when I buy a game anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, I was really tempted to buy those mythological card games though.  <br/>
Would my children really *finally* learn their times tables?  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
help but see it as manipulative of me - here&#39;s a really cool card game <br/>
guys, but guess what? in order to figure out who has a higher power, you <br/>
have to MULTIPLY!  I can already see them with their sharpies and their <br/>
calculators....crossing out the multiplication question and writing the <br/>
number instead.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Games are great, and much prefered to workbooks around here.  <br/>
Unfortunately, baby sisters don&#39;t like to stay away from games that are <br/>
being played, and she doesn&#39;t much like mom sitting and playing them <br/>
either.  My kids took to playing on the top bunk to stay away from her, <br/>
but all that did was give her motivation to learn how to climb.  :-0<br/>

They will probably learn things without knowing they wanted to learn them,  <br/>
and what they learn will be gradually built upon what they know.    They won&#39;t <br/>
find games to help them learn.  They&#39;ll play games for the  games&#39; sake, and <br/>
learning will happen as breathing happens, when you stop  looking so hard.<br/>

Computer games or video games are a good way to go while babies are  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Sandra, they play games because they are fun, not because they <br/>
intend to learn something.  It&#39;s rare that they choose a game in order <br/>
to learn something other than how to play the game better!  Naturally, <br/>
play and learning go hand in hand.  The more intelligent a species, the <br/>
more they play.  Not looking so hard anymore, simply enjoying the view.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the suggestion.  Last week I bought them each their own <br/>
Nintendo DS and a bunch of games.  Now the problem is where to play <br/>
that.  At least they can easily pause their game and move somewhere <br/>
else, but it doesn&#39;t stop the poor dear from following them around while <br/>
crying her heart out.  Does anyone have experience with how sturdy these <br/>
units are?  Can they withstand the hands of an 18 mo?  Will they survive <br/>
being dropped, or maybe being used as a hammer?<br/>

Buy her one.  It doesn&#39;t have to be just like theirs.  Go to the  used game <br/>
store or Goodwill and buy her an old video game--hopefully one that  works, and <br/>
give it to her.   You could probably get by with one of  those one-game <br/>
handhelds sold in the toy department.  I&#39;d try to get it in  the same color, <br/>
though.  I mean, she&#39;s young, but she&#39;s not an idiot.   ;)<br/>
 <br/>
You could also ask one of the siblings to let her play with their DS  <br/>
(supervised) for a whole day.  Try not to tell her &quot;no&quot; about it, but don&#39;t  let her <br/>
use it as a hammer.  Let her get her fill.  Show her how to be  responsible <br/>
with it (on an 18 monthers level), and let her play with it.   Show her how to <br/>
push the buttons and put the games in and out.  <br/>
 <br/>
And, I&#39;d ask the siblings to be kind to her, and if they&#39;re not going to  let <br/>
her play with their system, to keep all of it put away, and not play in  <br/>
front of her.  It&#39;s mean to be saying no all the time.  <br/>
 <br/>
She just wants to be like her sibs. Nothing wrong with that.  If you  remove <br/>
the air of the forbidden around it, she&#39;ll lose interest  eventually.  <br/>

way into a little mouth!  Nintendo DS uses a tiny stylus unsuitable for <br/>
a toddler, I think. Also, like all the handheld systems, the screens <br/>
can be scratched; I&#39;d definitely get a tougher game system for the baby <br/>
to play with.  We have some seemingly indestructible Gameboy colors &lt;g&gt;<br/>
