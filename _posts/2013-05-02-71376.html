<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776034844">I thought it might be interesting to people here to read a blog of a<br/>
now-grown unschooler. This is my oldest daughter&#39;s new blog:<br/>
<br/>
Roya is a grown unschooler and wife of a park ranger at Griffith Park - an<br/>
almost-5,000 acre wild and rugged urban park that borders Hollywood.They<br/>
live in a house right on park property. She spends a lot of time hiking in<br/>
the park, exploring Hollywood, and crocheting, knitting and working on<br/>
other DIY/heritage arts projects. The blog is about all that and whatever<br/>
else comes up as she makes her life in the Little House in the Big Park.<br/>
