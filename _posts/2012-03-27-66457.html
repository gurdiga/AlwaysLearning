<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384801323">Just Add Light and Stir&#39;s entry for today has had an addendum, so I brought it here because a lot of my subscribers are probably here, and because it&#39;s worth considering.  Whether you can milk a cow or text in the dark, you still don&#39;t know what kids will be doing 10 or 15 years from now that you won&#39;t know how to do, and so couldn&#39;t have taught them to do.<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Years ago my granny complained that I didn&#39;t know how to use a fountain pen or milk a cow. I never learned to use a slide rule, either. I did learn to type on a manual typewriter with a blank keyboard. Things change. I don&#39;t know how to send text messages, though I do finally own a cellphone. My kids all are whizzes at it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The quote above was written in 2007 ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/panel">http://sandradodd.com/panel</a> ).  I can text now, awkwardly.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at the Apple store, getting a battery replaced in Holly&#39;s MacBook, the guy handed me a charge-card reader and said &quot;Sign with your finger.&quot;   Luckily, I&#39;ve been playing Draw Something all week, and have been writing with my finger on an iPad, so I just did it.  No stylus, but &quot;sign with your finger.&quot;<br/>

----------------------------<br/>
When this first went out, it said &quot;without a blank keyboard.&quot;  I had fumbled the phrase when I first wrote it, and I fixed it on the webpage, but had pasted the original here.  I guess I started to write &quot;without the letters on the keys.&quot;  In summer school, when I was fourteen, I took a typing class and got to 42 words per minute.  I&#39;m faster now, but can still type in the dark, without looking at what&#39;s on the keys.  My current keyboard has the letters a, s and e worn through.  They light up from below, at night.  Others notice and ask how I can type, but I don&#39;t look at the keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
So because of that, I worry about people who aren&#39;t &quot;touch typists&quot;&mdash;how can they type?   Well, turns out they can type on miniature keyboards, with thumbs or index fingers; they can type from phone-number pads; they can type on flat screen pictures of keyboards, just as well as they can on &quot;a real keyboard.&quot;   My prediction of what they &quot;need&quot; to know how to do is as antiquated as my granny&#39;s was of me.</div>
