&lt;&lt; I ran into an odd cultural difference in my extended family - - my <br/>
sister&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
in-laws where there is a  propensity for adults to hold out a coin and ask <br/>
<br/>
little children to give a kiss to get the coin. This just appalls me - bet <br/>
<br/>
it does some of you, too, but it is SUPER common in the local <br/>
<br/>
mexican-american culture - &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Coins?  $5 sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
And weddings, when the bride is hispanic in Santa Fe and points north (I <br/>
don&#39;t know about southern New Mexico; haven&#39;t been to weddings there), at the <br/>
reception people pin money to her dress when they dance with her.  $20s and <br/>
$50s.   NEVER saw it at any anglo wedding or Indian weddings, and have been <br/>
to lots of all.<br/>
<br/>
It would not go over a BIT at a Baptist wedding (where they&#39;re probably not <br/>
going to dance at all anyway).  <br/>
<br/>
There are cultural differences which are worth considering when dealing with <br/>
Pueblo Indians.  They&#39;re very superstitious about babies, and one way to keep <br/>
babies healthy is not to praise them too much.  It&#39;s really rude for someone <br/>
to gush over a newborn baby of theirs and say &quot;what a perfect baby&quot; or &quot;she&#39;s <br/>
so cute.&quot;  You can say &quot;Cute, but small.&quot;   As long as you state a flaw or <br/>
qualify the statement it&#39;s okay.  Or you can just say something less personal <br/>
like how nice she was born before it was really cold outside, or great that <br/>
her grandmother was there when she was born.   <br/>
<br/>
To treat them just exactly the way you would treat anyone else out of a sense <br/>
of fairness and non-racism would end up being rude.  <br/>
<br/>
And I found when I was younger that if I went to visit in the Pueblo and <br/>
really praised some object, they felt obligated to give it to me, so I quit <br/>
saying &quot;This is beautiful,&quot; or anything like that.   I would say &quot;Did Betty <br/>
paint this?&quot; or &quot;Can we listen to this album?&quot;  If I said &quot;I wish I had that <br/>
album&quot; they might hand it to me and that wasn&#39;t what I meant at all.<br/>

LOL!  I spent a few seconds wondering why the bride would point north.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The best man and the maid of honor collect the dollars and let the next in <br/>
line know when it&#39;s their turn to dance with the bride or the groom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, we have dollar dances here too. Not all weddings, but many. My cousin had <br/>
one at her dance/reception, she had this little silk purse and all the men <br/>
who danced with her gave money. My Aunt and I counted it and she received <br/>
over eight hundred dollars, mostly in twenties and fifties, some fives and <br/>
tens, no ones. So it really shouldn&#39;t be called a dollar dance. That doesn&#39;t <br/>
count all the hundreds and fifties in all the cards she was given. <br/>

which direction was north, rather like moss growing on trees in the forest.<br/>
