 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to minimize what you&#39;re saying. It does sound like depression. But it&#39;s also true that teens go through periods of not having things figured out. It&#39;s confusing being on the edge of adult choices but not feeling ready.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t dismiss it. But it sounds like you&#39;re adding pressure. All of what you wrote is about what he&#39;s doing wrong and what he could do to fix it. How often do you drop in to chat? To ask him what he&#39;s discovered, what his favorite recent happenings are? How often do you listen just to find out more about him without using what he says as a way to assess whether he&#39;s thinking &quot;right&quot;? You say he played video games non stop. What do you know about the games? Have you asked him to show you his favorites? Asked why he likes them over other games? Perhaps ask him if there are games he thinks you might like? Are there games you could play together?<br/>

<br/>
So you were doing school at home before he was 12 or so?<br/>
<br/>
How old are the others, and how&#39;s it going for them?<br/>
<br/>
Pressure (or suggestions) to do more and be different are telling him he&#39;s not okay, so it&#39;s probably not helpful to categorize the ways you wish he would do and be different.  Perhaps for you, more than him, consider speaking with one of these folks who already understand unschooling—you won&#39;t need to pay money to teach someone else about unschooling before being able to lay out your concerns.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546896728">-=-My oldest Jordan says I am a horrible parent for letting his youngest brother Alex play COD games.  I tell him I am sorry for what he experienced and I wish I could change the past. -=-<br/>
<br/>
So when he says it&#39;s too late for him, maybe he means it&#39;s too late for him to grow up peacefully and happily. <br/>
I thought your implication in the early post was that it was too late for him to have friends or ever get out of the house.  <br/>
<br/>
Because people can&#39;t go back and fix things, it&#39;s good to help parents be sweeter and kinder from the beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-My oldest Jordan says I am a horrible parent for letting his youngest brother Alex play COD games.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Call of Duty,&quot; I&#39;m guessing; write things out, please, in posts here so people don&#39;t need to guess or google.<br/>
It&#39;s understandable if your oldest was deprived and limited and you told him it was for his own good, and he tried (as kids do) to see your actions as loving and supportive and sensible, that he would be frustrated that now he needs to redefine his own life, so soon, as wither you were wrong and didn&#39;t know what you were doing then, or that he suffered for good reasons, but now you&#39;ve thrown it all away.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s rough, and some people&#39;s personalities are more easy-going and forgiving than others&#39;.  He will probably go through many waves of review, as he grows older,  maybe mates, possibly has children.  He will look back, and around, and see you, and his childhood, from many different angles.  That can&#39;t be helped, either.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has regrets and it&#39;s good to minimize them while still finding ways to be upbeat and cheery as much as you can be.<br/>

&gt; getting a job, his driver&#39;s license or going to a movie,<br/>
&gt;the gym etc. I have suggested going to the doctor and/or a counselor but <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When he says that it is ‘too late’ for him, I’m wondering what he means? Can <br/>
you explore that concept a little more? Does he mean it’s too late to learn? <br/>
Or too late to have fun? Is it possible he sees his brothers having fun and <br/>
being allowed to play games, and feels that at 17 he should be doing <br/>
something more adult or work like? If so, I suspect that talk of jobs, gyms, <br/>
drivers licence etc, are probably adding to the pressure.<br/>
<br/>
If my child was saying it was too late for them, I’d tell them it was never <br/>
too late. I’d talk to them about their grandmother going back to university <br/>
to get her degree in her forties. I’d talk about people changing careers in <br/>
their 50s and later. It&#39;s never too late to either choose a career, or to <br/>
have fun! I&#39;d tell him to take all the time he needs to make those <br/>
decisions, and if right now he just feels like playing, to do that too. I&#39;d <br/>
explain that sometimes playing is just as necessary as &#39;doing things&#39;.<br/>

My older son went to public school for some classes (band, art), and his girlfriend, sister, and all his friends were in school. The message is that you need to know THESE things to be successful, you need to study THIS subject. Learning happens because of teachers. It&#39;s a strong message, and one the public school (and the kids there) spout very confidently and don&#39;t often question. <br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5247" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5066" dir="ltr">If, on top of that, your son went in, having spent recent years unschooling, there may be LOTS of stuff he doesn&#39;t know that he&#39;s &quot;SUPPOSED TO&quot;, according to them. He may have felt afraid that he is hopelessly behind where he should be because he&#39;s &quot;wasted&quot; his time playing games.&nbsp;</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5478" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5479" dir="ltr">For now, maybe just try to spend time with him, engage with him, watch him play video games, enjoy it with him. I used to bring a snack up for my son and then sit with him and watch him play for a bit. I also found he was more interested at chatting at about 1 in the morning, while he was playing or while he was fixing himself a bedtime snack. He wouldn&#39;t &quot;sit down&quot; for a discussion, but would make comments and chat a bit, without the pressure of &quot;let&#39;s talk&quot; or needing to make eye contact or anything. <br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5333" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_5354" dir="ltr"> <br> </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4751" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4752" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4546" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:14px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4545" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4544" dir="ltr"> <hr id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4928" size="1">  <font id="ygrps-yiv-106552282yui_3_16_0_1_1424100497479_4543" size="2" face="Arial"> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> &quot;justinmichellec@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465097084">-=-  I like the idea of playing just as necessary at doing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please clarify that.  I honestly don&#39;t know what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  He doesn&#39;t have any unschool friends.  The reason why he went to school was to make friends.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I thought he had online friends.  (Perhaps I&#39;m mixing him up with another story from the past few days; if so, sorry.)<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to send him out to do something on his own, try to find something (or more than one thing) that you and he, or that you and the family, can do where there are other people—a club, activity, choir, martial arts, volunteer work (which will look good on a resume when he wants to go to school or get a job)—but do NOT try to pressure him out to do something like that on his own.  Do things together as a family.<br/>
<br/>
It might BE too late if your unschooling wasn&#39;t involving ways for him to meet and be around other people (not necessarily unschoolers).  But it won&#39;t be too late for your younger children.  If the oldest is indicating to you that it&#39;s not working well, change things.  Be more open instead of more critical of him.  Be more relaxed instead of more tense.   Concerts, plays, museums—something up and out, involving more than one family member, to create shared experiences and to spark new ideas and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
If the two of you can go somewhere alone, the talking in the car might be the best part.<br/>

<br/>
A face-to-face conversation, for a male, can seem a challenge, more than anything else.  It can seem aggressive, a stare-down, and the only way to get out of it is to be dishonest and &quot;lose.&quot;  So the more mom&#39;s &quot;talk to boys,&quot; the more damage and distance they might cause.   But a conversation initiated by him, in a side-by-side situation, is very different.</div>

I mean that&#39;s the only way to get out of it if the aggressor is his mother.<br/>

There are men in prison who got out of pressured face-to-face encounters in other ways.<br/>
