<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123351245">My son has asked to go back to school. He expects to hate it, but says<br/>
that it&#39;s worth it, because, he wants to be considered normal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some of our back story:<br/>
<br/>
Joseph went to a 2.5 hour a day pre-k, tried out a kindergarten for<br/>
the first three weeks of the next school year (he was glad to quit<br/>
that place), went to another kindergarten for three months toward the<br/>
end of that school year (didn&#39;t want to leave, but I felt it was for<br/>
the best, then), went to a full year of 1st grade, homeschooled<br/>
(unschoolish) for 2nd and 3rd, unschooled for 4th. Now is the end of<br/>
(what his Dept. of Education paperwork calls) 4th grade.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, Joseph&#39;s father, Paul, killed himself in January, 2012.<br/>
Paul had had bouts of depression since he was a kid, until his final<br/>
depressed period, which lasted from when Joseph was 5 until he died. A<br/>
few months before Paul died, Joseph tried out for Manhattan Free (as<br/>
in democratic) School. He said he wanted to go to school to make Paul<br/>
happy. I told him he could go to a Free School. In the week that he<br/>
was there, Joseph broke every rule that they had, and wasn&#39;t excepted.<br/>
I think he was testing them.<br/>
<br/>
Durring the 2nd and 3rd grade homeschooling years, Joseph often ended<br/>
up around kids he didn&#39;t like and in classes that weren&#39;t fun. We had<br/>
to be out of the apartment, because of Paul, and I often made bad<br/>
choices as to where we should be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some about Joseph:<br/>
<br/>
Joseph is very interested in popular culture, though he does have very<br/>
personal opinions on all things; since he was very little, he has been<br/>
skilled at figuring out what the latest craze is, and using it as a<br/>
conversation starter, or ice breaker. He&#39;s a story teller, of many<br/>
forms; writing, drawing, verbally telling and more. He studies the<br/>
production of television, movies and web shows, and also, to a lesser<br/>
extent, stage shows. We live in New York City, and I have been able to<br/>
offer him a lot of access to these fields.<br/>
<br/>
This past year and a half, we&#39;ve done some big things (Comic Con,<br/>
Maker Faire, Medieval Festival, Disney World, a cruise, Unschooler&#39;s<br/>
Waterpark Gathering) that he enjoyed and later talks about fondly, but<br/>
most days he chooses to stay at home. He has online friends that he<br/>
thoroughly enjoys. They live in other time zones, so he sleeps more in<br/>
the day than at night. They get together via KIK (online texting),<br/>
Club Penguin Private Servers, and YouTube groups (they make movies by<br/>
recording themselves on Club Penguin and adding music and special<br/>
effects and editing). He found them via You Tube, about a year ago.<br/>
Some homeschool, some don&#39;t. Non &quot;virtually&quot;, he&#39;s decided (this year)<br/>
that he doesn&#39;t like playing with large groups of kids, so, has two<br/>
friends that he occasionally plays with, but he&#39;ll pass on seeing them<br/>
if they are part of a large group.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere Joseph looks, he finds stories of children&#39;s struggles at<br/>
school. I think he wants to experience this himself. He said to me,<br/>
yesterday &quot;Mom, if I come home from school and say &#39;school&#39;s<br/>
terrible&#39;, don&#39;t tell me to quit&quot;. He has also echoed what he has<br/>
heard from his grandmother and Paul: &quot;school will help me get on a<br/>
schedule&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, I told him that I&#39;ll enroll him somewhere this fall,<br/>
but wonder if maybe I shouldn&#39;t have. It is too late to enroll in any<br/>
schools besides our zoned school. I have fears about it&#39;s safety, and<br/>
also extremely negative influences of both the kids and teachers. We<br/>
could move. Joseph says that he&#39;s a City Kid though, and wants to stay<br/>
here. If he continues, he&#39;d have to switch schools for middle school,<br/>
which starts the following year. We&#39;d then have a better chance<br/>
(though still slim) at getting him into a safer school, because we&#39;d<br/>
have more choices. I could try to stall, by pointing that out to him.<br/>
I do wish him to have more time to settle in to our new life. I think<br/>
Joseph is still in mourning, as well as still kind of deschooling. I&#39;m<br/>
prepared to unschool until he leaves home.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or thoughts?<br/>

Tanya, I saw the note saying to disregard that after it was already sent.  If you want me to delete it, I can.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think people can give you some ideas even if it&#39;s not finished or it&#39;s not perfect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999691860">I&#39;m sorry about the death in the family.  That always takes a long recovery, but school doesn&#39;t help.  When kids are grieving, it&#39;s impossible to expect a large group of children to understand.  And it seems schools often ask for stories, or art, about families and parents, or send something home &quot;for your mom and dad to sign&quot; and there will be reminders galore.<br/>
<br/>
About the school question, though, what you wrote seems to be largely about you and your beliefs and preferences:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I felt it was for the best,-=-<br/>
-=- He said he wanted to go to school .... I told him he could go to a Free School....-=-<br/>
-=-I told him that I&#39;ll enroll him ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-Everywhere Joseph looks, he finds stories of children&#39;s struggles at<br/>
school. I think he wants to experience this himself. He said to me,<br/>
yesterday &quot;Mom, if I come home from school and say &#39;school&#39;s<br/>
terrible&#39;, don&#39;t tell me to quit&quot;. He has also echoed what he has<br/>
heard from his grandmother and Paul: &quot;school will help me get on a<br/>
schedule&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And he&#39;s interested in stories, and production, and he will probably learn things from school that you didn&#39;t, and that you can&#39;t imagine, because he sees things in a different way.  That&#39;s not bad.<br/>
<br/>
-=-A few weeks ago, I told him that I&#39;ll enroll him somewhere this fall,<br/>
but wonder if maybe I shouldn&#39;t have. It is too late to enroll in any<br/>
schools besides our zoned school. -=-<br/>
<br/>
What about Clonlara?  He could correspond with teachers, have a schedule, feel a little like he&#39;s in school, and yet be safe at home.<br/>
<br/>
If you can afford to, what about offering him something other than school for a whileï¿½a trip out of state, or something that he wouldn&#39;t be able to do if he were in school.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I think Joseph is still in mourning, as well as still kind of deschooling. I&#39;m<br/>
prepared to unschool until he leaves home.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If he thinks school is where the learning is, he&#39;s not &quot;kind of deschooling.&quot;  He&#39;s still a school kid.<br/>
<br/>
But parents need to deschool much more and much longer than any child does, so if unschooling seems like a good idea to you, get on it a little more agressively for yourself, maybe.  If he doesn&#39;t see the learning that&#39;s happening, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re missing some of it too.  <br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read Pam Laricchia&#39;s intro, please do.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://livingjoyfully.ca">http://livingjoyfully.ca</a><br/>
Her books or mine might help you be clearer on the kinds of things you could say and do that would make school seem less important and less desirable.<br/>
<br/>
He says he&#39;s a city kid.  There are other cities you could visit.  There will be a small unschooling conference in October in Southern California (when they have the site, we&#39;ll know the date).  There is the HSC conference in Sacramento in August that might be a fun vacation for you and Pam Laricchia is speaking this year.  <br/>
<br/>
Getting out and being around unschoolers who are his age or older could help you both.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes &quot;feeling normal&quot; can provide a kind of emotional protection. Being different can be stressful in and of itself - it can feel dis-empowering, unsafe. Even when people aren&#39;t overtly discriminating against you, you don&#39;t see validating reflections of yourself and your experience.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It could help to see that as he&#39;s asking you to support something he wants to do. He knows it&#39;s going to be rough at times and he wants help getting Through the rough stuff. He doesn&#39;t want every complaint met with &quot;you could quit&quot; because that would undermine his goals, make him feel like you weren&#39;t supporting him. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the same as forcing him to go to school until he&#39;s 18. You could make a deal that you&#39;ll help him out, but you want to revisit the plan at Christmas, for instance, and see if he feels like it&#39;s worthwhile to continue.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you wore him out! If he&#39;s kind of a homebody and associates homeschooling with going out and doing things all the time, then the option of long dull days might seem soothing. Maybe plan a restful summer to help him recoup a little. <br/>
