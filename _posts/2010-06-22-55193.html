<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607166647">In school, they wanted to tell me my son (7 - almost 8) had &#39;behavioral issues&#39;.  He got in trouble a lot.  Mostly, what he got in trouble for was of no concern to us at home.  He would touch the walls on the way to the bathroom.  He couldn&#39;t sit still and quiet during circle time.  He talked too much about things they weren&#39;t discussing. He wouldn&#39;t finish his worksheets.  I got the impression that they wanted to label him as ADHD.  He&#39;s fine.  He&#39;s 7.  He is an extremely intelligent young boy with interests that are different from a lot of boys his age (especially those in school). <br/>
<br/>
As far as &#39;attention deficit&#39;, he has no problem paying attention to something he is interested in.  A good movie or game can keep him occupied for hours.  If he isn&#39;t interested, he is moving on to something else.  <br/>
<br/>
The one that I am more interested in addressing is his &#39;random bursts of hyperactivity&#39;.  I don&#39;t see it as a problem that needs a label and DEFINITELY doesn&#39;t need medication, as some have implied to me.  I do, however, want to help him keep this under control, at least in social situations.  I am not sure if it is because he was the only child for his first five years (we have a 2 year old son also) or because he has really interesting things to talk about and just wants to be able to do that whenever he wants to.  I have read and digested a lot about the possibility that children may not be burning off enough energy.  That may actually be some of it, mostly because he is much more interested in the computer, electronics, legos and other activities that are more of sitting and thinking and less of running around and burning off energy.  He does really well in one on one situations, but it seems like if there is a group he gets to acting very very silly and often times irritating those around him.  This is NOT his intention at all, I don&#39;t believe.  I know he is just trying to get and maintain their attention, and also likes to make people laugh, and this is his version of how to do that.  It also happens a lot when we have been spending a lot of time together, and then I have to step away and take care of the little one for a bit.  In that situation, it seems like he may be a bit jealous of the attention his brother is receiving, and does whatever he can to turn it back to himself. I try saying things like &quot;Calm down a little bit buddy&quot; and sometimes that works.  Other times, it seems more like something that he can&#39;t control even if he wanted to.  He is a very sweet boy and it hurts me to see others shy away from him because of these outbursts.  Any insight you have would be extremely helpful, even if you just tell me he will grow out of it eventually.  This is my oldest, so he is the only seven year old I have experience with raising.  We are learning as we go, but this seems to be our most recurring cause of frustration.<br/>

Look really hard at the idea that they&#39;re random! I have two energetic kids and know that what can seem &quot;random&quot; can often be traced to things like needing protein, or needing more attention, or needing to do something big and wild and rough for awhile! My 8yo has regular cycles of higher and lower energy, but my 16yo, when he was younger, was more likely to get wild (as opposed to just needing to run around) during a transition. <br/>

<br/>
It can help to look for ways for him to burn off a little energy while also doing those other things - like a mini trampoline or bouncy ball or sit-n-spin right by the tv or computer. It can also help for you to make a conscious effort to engage him in fun, energetic things. At some convenient stopping point in his game or show or play (very important!) offer to wrestle or play soccer or go climb something - whatever he tends to enjoy. Help him figure out that he needs breaks by giving him chances to take them that are appealing to him. <br/>

<br/>
When Ray was younger it helped for him to have someone who was happy to make him the center of that one person&#39;s attention during parties or group events. He *wanted* to socialize, but didn&#39;t have the greatest skills yet for making sure others were having a good time - that&#39;s something that comes with development to some extent. Younger kids tend to assume if they&#39;re having fun, then everyone else must be, too. So its kinder and more helpful to create ways for them to get the attention they need without driving the rest of the group up the wall. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
Some of it may be the sudden transition - can you include him more when you&#39;re interacting with the younger child? Make it more of a group thing? Can you ask him to help you take care of the younger? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Attention deficit&quot; is a concept invented by the American Psychiatric Association - one of its more insidious fantasies. Attention is always somewhere, it&#39;s that it&#39;s somewhere other than where a teacher or other adult wants it that causes the aggravation. That&#39;s not a deficiency of attention. It&#39;s adultism.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You say you want to help your son keep his bursts of high energy under control. Do you mean he wants to keep them under control?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hyperactivity&quot; is in the eye of the beholder. How do you know when your son is being more active than the norm? What do you measure his activity against? How do you know his normal activity isn&#39;t &quot;hypo&quot; active? How does anybody know it&#39;s &quot;normal&quot;? &quot;Normal&quot; is not the same as &quot;statistically most frequent&quot; as many parents and other adults seem to believe.<br/>
<br/>
High energy is valued in many areas of society. Not in the school classroom though or any social situation where the grown ups want peace and quiet. Is it that his behaviour when expressed in public places makes you uncomfortable?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
****I think I used hyper activity because of the label I had in mind, but that probably isn&#39;t the best way to describe what I meant.  He does have hyper moments.  Lots of them!  He is having a chill moment right now because he is really engrossed in a new game.  <br/>
<br/>
One example that I can think of to try to describe what I mean: We saw a young friend of Jayden&#39;s the other day when we were walking, and she said &quot;Hi Jayden&quot; and waved at him.  He got really close to her face and made a loud strange noise at her, but never said hi.   I suppose it is more ME being uncomfortable with HIS behavior, though.  I also see the way others react to his behavior, and knowing my son, I know he doesn&#39;t want people to react badly to him.  There are also outbursts where he has hurt the little ones either out of anger or out of excitement. I am not sure if this makes any sense, but I call it his &#39;ping ping ping&#39; mode :) Sometimes it is his talking that is in overdrive, and sometimes it is his body.  Sometimes it&#39;s both!</div>

<br/>
It sounds like he was trying to connect in a playful way and maybe it didn&#39;t come across like that. Really, I had a moment of nostalgia - he sounds like some of the guys I dated in college, a little off-beat and clueless sometimes, but heck, I still dated them!<br/>

<br/>
Do you think he wants some advice for how to socialize more effectively or would that leave him feeling uncomfortable? That might be something you could ask him. Does he seem to like being a little quirky and different from other people, or do you think he&#39;d rather blend in?<br/>

<br/>
Mo tends to play too rough for kids who are younger and/or smaller than she is. That&#39;s something I&#39;ve talked about with her, right up to saying &quot;don&#39;t play with the little kids&quot; if we&#39;re at a park or somewhere I don&#39;t know the families. Children don&#39;t always have a good sense of the abilities of others - other children or adults for that matter - and while its sometimes possible to help kids have more understanding or empathy in the moment, its not always possible. <br/>
<br/>
If these are your kids, then its important that you be on hand while they play to make sure the bigger kid doesn&#39;t run roughshod over the littles, and to also help the younger kids develop some strategies - like yelling for mom!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268687758">Some of his behaviors mimic my 11 yoDD.  She has undiagnosed Asperger&#39;s.  We have chosen not to label her, but instead we use the advice from several friends, websites and books.  This has helped us to understand that although her brain is wired differently, she can learn to cope in the normal world.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we do not get to decide what is normal; that has already been established by mainstream society.  But we can give her the tools to live in this world.  I know others will say that all kids are different and there are no such things as Asperger&#39;s, ADHD and Autism.  But I know from personal experience that some kids just aren&#39;t like their peers.  No matter how you try to help your kid: giving him an outlet for his energy, or extra protein; he may not be able to change.  <br/>
<br/>
If he is &#39;wired differently&#39; these behaviors are normal for him and he may not even know that he is doing it.  Making a strange noise as a &#39;hello&#39; to his friend was perfectly ok with him.  He probably thought he was actually saying &#39;hello&#39;.  Telling you that he just can&#39;t stop bouncing may not mean that he needs more activities, just a place to bounce.  And touching the walls is a way to connect with the physical world in a loud, changing environment.  Maybe he needs to balance his head (mind) and his body by touching a solid object.<br/>
<br/>
Raising an autistic child is challenging; especially with 2 younger children who are so different from her!  My 5 yo nephew is also autistic, with some of the same symptoms as my daughter.  Although his are more severe and are more difficult to manage.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot to say about the vast array of childhood behaviors.  Each child is different.  Personality is formed by genetics, upbringing, life experiences, etc.  We just go with the flow and give them a supportive, loving environment.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is perfect for my family (and my sister&#39;s family.)  We can just be there for our kids and facilitate their learning and growing.  But it is also a relief to know that there are actual, medical diagnoses out there when our emotions break down as we see our special kids suffer.  <br/>
<br/>
We are able to recognize her limitations and offer help in those awkward situations where she greets her friend nose-to-nose and squawks in her face.  (Pretending to be a chicken today?)  Don&#39;t be quick to apologize or make excuses.  Kids are weird sometimes.  Even without labels!  <br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this helps.  I know it can be frustrating to know that your child needs something and you don&#39;t know what it is, or how to give it to them.  Just be supportive and know that you aren&#39;t the only with a cross-wired kid!</div>

Once a child is labelled in the parents&#39; heads as &quot;cross-wired&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;has undiagnosed Asperger&#39;s,&quot; the child is labelled.  You may never be  <br/>
able to really forget that, but unschooling will be helped if you can  <br/>
practice not bringing it up, and eventually you might stop thinking it  <br/>
so often.<br/>

This sounds scarier than a diagnosed Aspergers - my mom compared me with<br/>
normal and found enough things missing to be an illness? What is undiagnosed<br/>
Aspergers? There are loads of illnesses not diagnosed in her. I totally<br/>
don&#39;t get the part where you say you have chosen not to label her, because<br/>
its looking like you gave her a label around &#39;problems&#39;. How would you feel<br/>

<br/>
I know quite a few people like that - I think of them as &quot;quirky.&quot;  <br/>
Sometimes they don&#39;t function super well in general society, but they <br/>
are often very interesting people who can have great lives if they&#39;re <br/>
allowed and helped to live in ways that work for them.<br/>

dash of autism is essential.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150997068">-=-I like the idea of helping your child and being open to looking at  <br/>
different<br/>
ways of doing this without placing your child in a specific box.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage to a parent of suggesting to *their* parents  <br/>
(grandparents) that &quot;something is wrong&quot; with a child is that the  <br/>
grandparents might back off or be more sympathetic.  The disadvantage,  <br/>
though, is the grandparents might become more agitated, thinking  <br/>
unschooling will not &quot;fix&quot; the problem.  The problem in that case  <br/>
would be that the parents described a problem.<br/>
<br/>
But the advantage to ANY unschooling parent of assuming that any one  <br/>
child will be unique and changing is that the parent can open the  <br/>
world in such a way that each child can taste, touch, hear, see and  <br/>
smell as he or she feels comfortable, with curiosities addressed, with  <br/>
desires to climb or sit or run accommodated.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, done mindfully and fully, works the very same for a child  <br/>
who might have been &quot;identified gifted&quot; as for a child who might have  <br/>
been slammed or dribbled into the &quot;slow class.&quot;  Because if the parent  <br/>
is able to calmly accept that quick learning one day doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
genius-at-30, and that a slow, confused beginning does NOT mean slow  <br/>
at 30, then the parent is learning acceptance and seeing.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing an individual child is not much helped by &quot;seeing&quot; statistics  <br/>
and curves and studies and labels.   Maybe a glance out of the corner  <br/>
of the eye, but if those things are set up between the parent and  <br/>
child, the child is not with the parent.  The parent is not with the  <br/>
child purely and directly and wholly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t advocate it as a mindful path to connecting with a child,  <br/>
but, out in mainstream American society, there&#39;s a *pervasive* belief  <br/>
that kids need their imperfection trained out of them. It&#39;s believed  <br/>
it&#39;s up to the parent to squash behavior that looks like it&#39;s  <br/>
deviating from the pathway to respectable adult behavior. It&#39;s  <br/>
strongly believed that a hyper child, for instance, needs to be  <br/>
controlled because he&#39;s obviously not learning how to do it on his  <br/>
own. And, the doomsayers are certain, if he&#39;s allowed to get away with  <br/>
that behavior too long, it will be even harder if not impossible to  <br/>
change him.<br/>
<br/>
The disrespect and distrust of children is rampant in American  <br/>
society. So, outside of groups that promote mindful parenting,  <br/>
trusting that a child doesn&#39;t need trained out of his behavior to get  <br/>
him to act normal is not an easy mindset to embrace. It&#39;s rare to find  <br/>
support for it.<br/>
<br/>
If looking into a label (and then dropping it) helps a parent trust  <br/>
that their child needs support to deal with the world rather than  <br/>
pressure to change, that could be a very good thing for the child.  <br/>
Here, since this list is radical unschooling, there&#39;s loads of support  <br/>
for children&#39;s differences and help to support who they are.<br/>

<br/>
How does labeling your child open the door to exploring information?<br/>
<br/>
When you think of your child as him or herself, rather than as a <br/>
diagnosis or label, you can explore everything and glean ideas and try <br/>
out what seems potentially useful with your real child and ignore the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Diagnoses or labels can get in the way. Parents will nearly always <br/>
follow the standard procedures recommended by professionals for that <br/>
diagnosis. A good example of that is that kids with ADD are often <br/>
assumed to need more structure and less stimulation. So they are put <br/>
into cubicles - blocked off from visual stimulation of seeing other kids <br/>
or anything else. They are given one math problem at a time, instead of <br/>
a sheet full of them. Parents are told to make their rooms plain - <br/>
remove potential distractions. That is standard procedure. How many <br/>
parents of so-called ADD kids have been told they need a very rigid <br/>
schedule? Here is an example of advice: &quot;Establish some kind of schedule <br/>
on weekends. Try not to deviate from the routines you establish. Begin <br/>
with small blocks of time, such as:<br/>
<br/>
8:30 Breakfast, 9:00 Chores in room; 10:30 Go to park, 12:00 lunch: 1:00 <br/>
Library, 3:30 Free time, 5:00 Help with dinner preparation, 6:00 Dinner, <br/>
7:00 Bath and free time, 8:30 Bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
The article goes on and on about what ADD children need: predictability, <br/>
consistency, and scheduling. At the end it says, &quot;And remember, they <br/>
won&#39;t always agree with your actions, but at least they will know what <br/>
your actions will be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Giving your child a label does open a door - to being told what your <br/>
child needs by people who don&#39;t know your child and make assumptions <br/>
based on that label.<br/>

Yes.  Anyone here reading should find ways to help themselves and  <br/>
their spouses or partners understand that children need what they  <br/>
need.  If they seem tired or listless, let them sit or lie down.  If  <br/>
they seem antsy and energetic, let them DO things.  If they seem  <br/>
hungry, feed them.    The only label that needs is &quot;human&quot; or &quot;alive,&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;child.&quot;  &quot;Person.&quot;  The reason to do it is &quot;compassion.&quot;   <br/>
&quot;Consideration,&quot; &quot;love,&quot; &quot;responsibility,&quot; &quot;mindfulness.&quot;<br/>

Yes, that&#39;s typically what people mean when they say unschooling works for all kids.  It doesn&#39;t mean that kids aren&#39;t different or that some kids aren&#39;t very different, but that all parents will need to do those things, meet needs creatively, explain needs to extended family as needed, etc.  The details will look different because the needs are different and the child is different. <br/>

<br/>
Chamille would probably have been labeled dyslexic if she had been in school.  That label would not have helped her learn how to read without pressure, at her own pace, calmly and peacefully.  She learned how to read when she was 11.  Armed with that knowledge, I chose NOT to read up more than a brief synopsis of dyslexia, enough to know that she probably was dealing with that.  Out of the school context, it didn&#39;t matter.  She was free to read and explore the written word on her own terms.  <br/>
<br/>
***For example, understanding that he likes heavy physical contact and <br/>
lots of wrestling and that there is a sensory reason for this helped ME <br/>
AND MY DH give this to him.***<br/>
<br/>
I know many people have done things similarly.  For those that are there right now, considering it, maybe you can stop before you start.  Understanding child development is good.  Understanding child development within pedagogy, isn&#39;t nearly as helpful.  There are very few books out there, if any, that address these issues without also addressing school.  Know that all kids are different and some are so different from our own understanding that we, as parents, have a hard time relating or understanding.  It doesn&#39;t change the child.  <br/>
<br/>
Too much worry and information and reading about child hood behavioral disorders can taint a parent&#39;s view of their child forever.  It seems better for unschooling, to see and recognize that your child likes physical contact and provide it.  It IS sensory input regardless of whether or not the child has sensory integration issues.  Patience and growth and change and finding ways for the senses to integrate needs a parent directly involved in being there and anticipating those needs because they know their child, NOT because they know their child&#39;s label.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538235937">Eli might be diagnosed with something if we pressed for it.  We have not.  What I have done is read autobiographies by people that have been diagnosed in those areas.  I find that they help me find the thought processes behind behaviors I have already observed and some strategies that worked for some people.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, I found some people diagnosed with autism/aspergers have a hard time blocking out stimuli.  They feel every breeze, see every leaf move and cannot block the sound of the wind in the trees.  This helped me understand why windy days at the park seemed to be so hard for Eli.  I was having trouble finding the pattern of which park days he enjoyed and which seemed too much.  After reading one person&#39;s explanation I was able to see how much windy days bothered him.  I might have found it out on my own, but during a several hour park day, there were too many variables to figure out the pattern.  Now I know to pay attention to the wind conditions when choosing which weeks to go and which to skip.<br/>
<br/>
Autobiographies seem to focus more on feelings and less on &quot;fixing.&quot;  Eli is not very verbal about what is going on inside him, so I have to guess.  Reading about what helped and did not for adults looking back at their lives gave me some places to start.  They never seem to think that their differences were much of a problem, it was only other people&#39;s reactions that caused problems.  <br/>
<br/>
And autobiographies are one of my favorite genres anyway!<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Patience and growth and change and finding ways for the senses to integrate needs a parent directly involved in being there and anticipating those needs because they know their child, NOT because they know their child&#39;s label.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I can remember when I was a child I often felt the need for lots and<br/>
lots of running, like for an hour or more, when I was about 9 or 10.<br/>
Karl is about to turn 7 in July. He has been hitting things a lot. So<br/>
I figure he needs lots and lots of it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need any label on him to provide him with space and things to<br/>
safely hit. No matter what people do (or don&#39;t do) to attach their<br/>
children to labels in order to feel better about making provisions to<br/>
satisfying a need, there the need is waiting (or not: acting out<br/>
perhaps) to be provided a place for.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the use of labels is to provide adults with<br/>
handles on that fabled normalcy, which in many instances may be a<br/>
desire to fit in. I don&#39;t look down on that but I would say that kids<br/>
and the maturing process for many adults doesn&#39;t necessarily fit in<br/>
with fitting in.<br/>

Yes to the first part, no to the second. People with autism and aspergers don&#39;t think animal noises and sound effects are language, although some people do find it appealing to use those sounds to communicate and some of those people may be diagnosed with on thing or another. Some people are just quirky, too. Its okay to be quirky!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616138638">-=-. Connecting with a child as a unique individual and meeting their  <br/>
specific needs would reduce the number of unnecessary diagnosis  <br/>
children are subjected to in adult&#39;s quest to make them fit into  <br/>
systems.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unnecessary&quot;!?  I think not.<br/>
<br/>
If the purpose of the diagnoses is to justify educations and paychecks  <br/>
for teachers, special ed teachers, school counsellors, contractors who  <br/>
get more money when schools need more classrooms, doctors,  <br/>
diagnosticians, therapists, pharmacists and the gigantic group of  <br/>
manufacturers and research labs and lawyers and stockholders behind  <br/>
all of that....<br/>
<br/>
When a child is labelled it is very rarely for the good of the child.   <br/>
It is to maintain payments on cars and houses and boats.  OTHER  <br/>
people&#39;s cars, houses and boats.  New carpet for the offices of  <br/>
superintendents, pharmacy corporation secretaries, nice furniture for  <br/>
waiting rooms...<br/>
<br/>
This has been a very rare politicalish rant by me.  I don&#39;t like to go  <br/>
there.  But people here seem to be on the edge of confusing diagnosing  <br/>
children with serving , supporting or helping children.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t need it.<br/>
Unschooling can be harmed by it.<br/>
Therefor, it&#39;s not going to help this list to help people unschool for  <br/>
people to recommend or justify labelling or &quot;not-diagnosed and not- <br/>
labelled but he would be...&quot; either.<br/>
