How Children Learn: classic of human, kid-centered learning<br/>
POSTED BY CORY DOCTOROW, SEPTEMBER 23, 2008 6:50 AM<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, a reader sent me copies of John Holt&#39;s classic  <br/>
books on children&#39;s education, How Children Learn and How Children  <br/>
Fail and tonight, I finished the first of them (and will be reading  <br/>
the other next). It was one of the most profoundly moving books I&#39;ve  <br/>
ever read, the truest account of how I remember my best learning  <br/>
experiences as a child and an adult.<br/>
<br/>
Holt was a dedicated teacher and a very, very keen observer of  <br/>
children from babyhood up. Most of How Children Learn takes the form  <br/>
of notes from his diaries, his later reflections on his failures and  <br/>
successes, and letters and feedback from other parents and educators.<br/>
<br/>
Holt&#39;s basic thesis is that kids want to learn, are natural learners,  <br/>
and will learn more if we recognize that and let them explore their  <br/>
worlds, acting as respectful co-learners instead of bosses....<br/>
