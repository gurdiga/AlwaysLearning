Date:  Thu Jan 31, 2002  7:42 am<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know many,<br/>
far too many,adults who think they know it all about<br/>
&#39;raising&#39; kids because they have had 4 that are now<br/>
adults. But the truth is, their experience of raising<br/>
kids is far from my ideals and my experiences of being<br/>
a kid. Their experience only helps me from the what<br/>
not to do point of view. Their advice is useless to<br/>
me. Experience does not necessarily mean knowledge,<br/>
understanding, or &quot;good&quot; advice&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know some people who are pretty old, 90, that<br/>
do not know half of what I do. Yes, she has the<br/>
experience of living every age up to that one, but the<br/>
WAY she lived it does not provide her with knowledge<br/>
or wisdom. Does age really matter? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think a helpful word to remember here would be *Context*...The <br/>
setting, the background of this list, why it exist.  Do you really <br/>
think you will find thoughtless parents or 90yr. olds that lived a <br/>
thoughtless bitter life doling out useless advise?  Not likley.  But <br/>
what you will find are thoughtful, experienced, charitable people <br/>
wanting to help others in their understanding of <br/>
an issue that they know well.<br/>
<br/>
I am thankful for the imput here, even if I do not always agree I <br/>
love the thought processes the conversation provokes, provided it <br/>
does not come from a hostile p.o.v. which some of the less <br/>
expericenced have displayed.<br/>

Judgment is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I really want my kids to have good judgment, to be aware of their options and <br/>

It seems you&#39;ve unequivocably judged something or someone a huge barrier to <br/>
communication.    Not everyone here would agree, I think.<br/>

It&#39;s good to remember that words have connotations.  Is a canine companion a <br/>

Standing by his convictions or being stubborn?<br/>
<br/>
To call someone judgmental is probably in the realm of a judgmental mutt <br/>
biting its own tail.  (Or a discerning dog chasing logic in a circle.)<br/>

To avoid this charge of &quot;judgmentalism,&quot; would one have to violate her own <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309802531">there are several common meaning of the word judgement.  when people say it&#39;s ok<br/>
to judge someone else, which means to decide whether or not what someone else<br/>
does is appropriate or inappropriate for that other person, it concerns me,<br/>
because my own experience has shown me that judgementalism is indeed a strong<br/>
barrier to productive communication.<br/>
<br/>
your comment regarding judgement in terms of &quot;good sense&quot; is another meaning, and<br/>
is of course something i&#39;d think we&#39;d all hope for, for ourselves and our<br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m confused and concerned as to why in your post you say that i&#39;ve judged<br/>
someone for being judgemental, therefore making my own actions judgemental.  i<br/>
think what i stated was a plain fact regarding interpersonal communication, and<br/>
nowhere within my post did i point fingers or judge anyone.  once again, it seems<br/>
like the defensiveness on this list runs in hyper mode.  i won&#39;t give up on it<br/>
yet, but it is a bit trying.<br/>

defensive.<br/>
<br/>
And your characterizations of others seems judgmental.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know nobody asked me but I felt like sharing something.  OK - we started homeschooling in September, unschooling in November.  But of course I didn&#39;t get the unschooling thing at first and thought I had to just give them fun ways to do the 5 subjects. I bought a math game to give them at Christmas.  When the game came by UPS, I didn&#39;t remember what it was so I let my dd open it.  I say what it was, quickly swept it away and said to forget it.  Well by Christmas, I was understanding unschooling a little more and I felt like a heel for getting them an educational gift for Christmas so I didn&#39;t give it to them.  This week my dd asked why I didn&#39;t give them the game she saw and asked if she could get it.  I told her it was a math game thinking she would not be interested.  They have been playing the game all week and love it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101777846">i didn&#39;t realize that we were arguing, but if we were, as you would probably say,<br/>
&quot;is arguing a bad thing?&quot; as to my argument being a defense, i know what a<br/>
defense is, and i know what defensive communication is, and my paragraph contains<br/>
neither.  of course to prove that, i would have to go on defense, and that&#39;s not<br/>
worth my time (nor the time of anyone reading this, i&#39;d think).   i too was being<br/>
sarcastic, in my use of &quot;dismiss,&quot; but that&#39;s about as far as it goes.  as to<br/>
hypocracy, well, that&#39;s your judgement, and you have a right to it, they i<br/>
certainly don&#39;t agree.  tiresome, you bet -- i believe i said that about 3<br/>
messages ago.<br/>
<br/>
how do i feel about unschooling?  well, i think it&#39;s wonderful, in theory and in<br/>
action, which is why we&#39;ve ascribed to it.  i didn&#39;t learn until late last year<br/>
that what we were doing had a name, and i tend to resist labels, but unschooling<br/>
it must be.  i don&#39;t have a singular best story -- what i have is a child who<br/>
absorbs the world around him like a sponge, and i can&#39;t even imagine interferring<br/>
with that.  we just try to facilitate and enjoy, and it&#39;s wonderful -- and in the<br/>
process, we&#39;re learning something new (or relearning something we&#39;d forgotten)<br/>
every day.  one interest flows smoothly into another, and pretty soon we&#39;re<br/>
hanging home-made planetary mobiles from the ceiling, then reading about<br/>
astrology, and then looking for constellations in the night sky, which leads to<br/>
the reading of some simplified greek or roman myths.  the garden is our second<br/>
home (if that could be said of something that&#39;s a part of one&#39;s home), and the<br/>
library is our third home -- we&#39;re all home together, and the unschooling life is<br/>
glorious.  the only concerns are the isolation aspect.  i won&#39;t go into the<br/>
socialization thing, because i think we all agree that the &quot;but what about<br/>
socialization question?&quot; is b.s., but we have only one child, and in the winter<br/>
it&#39;s especially hard to find folks to gather with on a regular basis.  our local<br/>
homeschooling group is absolutely wonderful -- i&#39;m so grateful to have found such<br/>
a supportive, interesting group -- but it&#39;s winter, folks are hibernating<br/>
(including us -- we didn&#39;t get out of bed until 10, which is why i&#39;m still stuck<br/>
working now), and sometimes i feel like we&#39;re not getting out as much as we<br/>
&quot;should.&quot;  other frustration is a lack of interesting chapter books for little<br/>
ones who are still young enough to get scared by, well, scary topics, but a<br/>
friend just turned me on to thornton burgess, and i just rediscovered the wind in<br/>
the willows and the littles, and so hope is not lost...<br/>

was interesting and not scary,  i&#39;d say even for the youngest kids (we started<br/>
&#39;em when our son was 2 1/2).  and of course there&#39;s the original pooh&#39;s...<br/>

I bought one I had seen at a conference once called Muggins (which is also <br/>

either, it&#39;s more of a &quot;game for the sake of doing arithmetic&quot;, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re been getting a lot of old games at thrift stores and playing,<br/>
though. Inner Circle is kinda fun, that was Cacie&#39;s favorite, and also<br/>
Deuce and Can&#39;t Stop. <br/>

disturbing for some young kids- my son at 4-5 loved CHrlie and the CHoclate<br/>
Factory- but it&#39;s sequel freaked him out and we couldnt get past the first<br/>
chapter..<br/>

play it buy ear, of course ,but I would definately red flag the RD as<br/>
possible scary/disturbing- oh my gosh..the adults are often so wonderfully<br/>

I ordered the opps wipe-off board because I think we can play the game on the Muggins board.  I like playing but no one can go by me because I hate most other board games since they require so little thought.  I get bored very easily.  I also bought the geometric design maker.  The designs you can make are gorgeous.  It is kind of a connect the dot type thing.  <br/>
<br/>
The ps friends played and got very competitive about how easy it was to do the math.  I didn&#39;t like that.<br/>

Esio Trot is a great Dahl book but hard to read aloud, because you have<br/>
to keep stopping to point out the spelling stuff so everyone gets the<br/>

Matilda there was a long enough lag-time bwteen seeing the movie and<br/>
reading the book that  she missed some ;-) No, wait, *she* never read the<br/>
book, that&#39;s why!  And I&#39;m a much more lenient critic on that score.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of movies seem to totally change the ending of the books, and that<br/>
bugs her most of all... after Witches she was literally jumping up and<br/>
down shouting at the tv... and she hissed at me all through Stuart<br/>
Little... she needs a friend like Holly, someone who enjoys the fine art<br/>
of critiquing.<br/>
