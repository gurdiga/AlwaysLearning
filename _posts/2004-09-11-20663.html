<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345254390">Hi all,   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Chicago, and speaking in the morning.  My hostess let me on the computer so I could write to my family and check e-mail.  I&#39;ve gone no-mail for lists so my box won&#39;t fill up before I&#39;m home, so checking the new messages for this list I find lots about school, two about politics and none about unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a list for people whose children have gone back to school would be worth having, but I&#39;d hate for AlwaysLearning to become that list.  <br/>
<br/>
If any of you were running a vegetarian list, you probably wouldn&#39;t want it to turn into a discussion of the first meats people ate when they went back to meat-eating.  If you were running a breastfeeding discussion list, how long would you want a formula discussion to go on?  <br/>
<br/>
Brief comments about how unschoolers have reacted to school information, or what topics they&#39;ve dealt with how aren&#39;t bad.  That&#39;s about unschooling.  But discussions about how to deal with teachers are about school, and teachers, and not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Who to vote for!?   I don&#39;t care.  Let&#39;s talk about how people learn, please, and about unschooling families and how they live.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to post links to lists where such questions would be better served, please feel free to do that.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127500949">I want to interject another perspective. I haven&#39;t been following <br/>
this whole thread, so it may have already been presented. <br/>
<br/>
The pov is that the child doesn&#39;t really *want* all the trappings (no <br/>
pun intended) of school, but thinks that school is the best way to <br/>
get their needs met. I think this places more onus on the radically <br/>
unschooling parent to discover the *real needs* that the child is <br/>
trying to meet. Rather than assuming that what a child states they <br/>
need based on their awareness of the alternatives is a completely <br/>
informed choice. Increased alternatives that actually meet their <br/>
needs may well supplant the child&#39;s desire for school as the solution.<br/>
<br/>
We were just discussing this in regards to cub scouts, ballet <br/>
lessons, music lessons, etc. on Anne Ohman&#39;s <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Shinewithunschooling@yahoogroups.com">Shinewithunschooling@yahoogroups.com</a> site. The issue is empowering <br/>
our children to discern their specific needs such as to &#39;challenge <br/>
themselves academically&#39;, &#39;social outlet&#39;, &#39;shared interests&#39;, &#39;more <br/>
responsibilities&#39;, &#39;separation from other siblings for periods of <br/>
time&#39;, &#39;desires to explore new interests&#39;, &#39;apprentice <br/>
opportunities&#39;, &#39;evaluation of their knowledge&#39;, &#39;ability to fit <br/>
in&#39;, &#39;desire to be a part of the community&#39;, &#39;desire to grow without <br/>
parental influence&#39;, etc. Develop and facilitate means of meeting <br/>
those *real needs* in a consensual manner that doesn&#39;t include the <br/>
negative aspects of school. <br/>
<br/>
For example, David Albert&#39;s book &quot;And The Skylark Sings For Me&quot; talks <br/>
of community based learning. Apprenticeships are a possibility to <br/>
explore to meet many of the above needs. Developing social gatherings <br/>
for your community based on similar interests is hard work but can be <br/>
cultivated. The responsibilities of younger children can certainly <br/>
infringe on the parent&#39;s ability to meet the social and intellectual <br/>
needs of older children. Other adults can be sought to facilitate <br/>
interests of their children without succumbing to school as the &quot;why <br/>
not give it a try&quot; alternative.<br/>
<br/>
I can conceptualize no inherently constructive benefit that is unique <br/>
to school that can not be discovered, developed or demonstrated <br/>
within the *real community* rather than the authoritarnian B.S. that <br/>
school entails. To conclude otherwise seems short-sighted at best and <br/>
disingenuous at worst. The effort needed to provide our children with <br/>
the tools to meet their needs must be modelled by us for them to <br/>
learn to problem solve outside the box. Otherwise, why not just send <br/>
them to the &quot;school box&quot; in the first place?<br/>

Okay, if this is your &quot;challenging&quot; thought, I guess I just have to say  that <br/>
it&#39;s been said and done and said and done over and over and over again  among <br/>
unschoolers for a long long time.  I&#39;ve suggested it myself.   It&#39;s not a <br/>
*new* idea that people are waiting with bated breath for Sandra to  expound upon. <br/>
 It&#39;s just hardly worth noting, once it&#39;s been said  again.<br/>
 <br/>
There are hundreds of other possible reasons why no one responded to  your <br/>
stroke of brilliance.  That Sandra has not, yet, is not the first  reason I <br/>
would settle upon.<br/>
