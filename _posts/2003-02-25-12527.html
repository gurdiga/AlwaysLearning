 </span></blockquote>I think that if you truly get unschooling, the unschooling.com list can get<br/>
tedious sometimes.  But I have gotten a lot out of it over the last year.<br/>
Most any list has arguements, people who are more difficult to deal with,<br/>
etc.  If you stay with it for several weeks or months, then you get a feel<br/>
for the list.  Unschooling.com has had its share of problems lately.  Being<br/>
limited in &quot;free thinking&quot; wouldn&#39;t be one I&#39;d think of, though.<br/>
<br/>
It strikes me as a somewhat rash judgement to critize an entire group of<br/>
people without spending some serious time there considering their position,<br/>
and such.  Especially since many of the people here regular posters there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123462050">I like this list, but I&#39;d have to say that I like the WAY <br/>
unschooling.com is set up.  You can look at entire conversations, <br/>
their subjects,I love that &#39;tree view&#39; deal ...It&#39;s just a lot easier <br/>
to navigate...I feel.  Plus, I get really good feelings from some of <br/>
the regular posters...I have learned so much more about unschooling <br/>
from that list in the last 8 months...just because they truly tend to <br/>
address specific issues, and there is less &quot;small talk&quot;.  That being <br/>
said...Here I am!  <br/>
