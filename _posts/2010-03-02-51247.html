<div id="ygrps-yiv-989560318">I love Rue Kream&#39;s book, Parenting a Free Child<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter wrote a good one, The Unprocessed Child<br/>
And Sandra Dodd&#39;s new book is amazing, The Big Book of Unschooling,<br/>
of course, I liked her book, Moving a Puddle also.<br/>
<br/>
I think John Holts; books are less useful than the four I mentioned,  <br/>
actually.<br/>
He was  a teacher writing about schooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
These writers are writing about their real life experiences with  <br/>
unschooled children.<br/>
<br/>

Anyway, was looking at the list of John Holt books yesterday, but don&#39;t know where to start, I&#39;ve read &quot;How Children Fail&quot; and many JOhn Gatto articles. I want some around the house.<br/>
Sorry to add myself to your query Jude, but like you say, so many out there, I&#39;ve read everything at the local library (not much) and want to add to my own library now.<br/>

think books promoting school would help make school a happier place  <br/>
for her?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty much propaganda. It&#39;s telling her that her feelings are  <br/>
wrong and these ideas are right.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;d like more structure, help her build more structure into her  <br/>
days. Talk about what she&#39;d like to do and find ways to do it. Rather  <br/>
than trying to convince her homeschooling is better with someone  <br/>
else&#39;s words, make life at home better!<br/>

Hi Gabi,<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter (also almost 13) quite likes to dip into Grace Llewellyn&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;, which is mostly directed at teens and has loads  <br/>
of inspirational ideas about doing interesting things (eg volunteering)  <br/>
that aren&#39;t dictated by school.  And following their own interests, of  course.<br/>
 <br/>
Could your daughter have the occasional shopping/cinema trip with  her <br/>
schooled friends directly before or after band  practice?   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451434015">-=-I want to get a John Holt book, but which one? He has published  <br/>
about 6. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I liked Learning All The Time.  It was available in a better edition  <br/>
(cleaner paper) when Kirby was young and I wanted to read some Holt.  <br/>
In college we had read How Children Learn and How Children Fail, but  <br/>
the only editions of those I could find were falling-apart paperbacks  <br/>
from the 1970&#39;s, when I was looking.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, though, a lifetime has passed since Holt passed away, and he  <br/>
never knew anyone who had been unschooled throughout their school  <br/>
years.  The only people he met who hadn&#39;t been to school were either  <br/>
young or had been taken out of school after some years of frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have been unschooling a long time know things John Holt  <br/>
would have loved to have seen, but he missed it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a fair amount of Holt to read from links on this page, without  <br/>
having to find a book:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/johnholt">http://sandradodd.com/johnholt</a><br/>

<br/>
If it wasn&#39;t her option to leave school, that problem might not  <br/>
resolve itself.<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst things about school is that the kids feel trapped.   <br/>
That can happen with homeschooling, too.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling needs to be way more interesting than school for the  <br/>
kids to be happy with it.  Buying more Holt books won&#39;t make their  <br/>
lives more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
You might find some ideas here, though:<br/>

For a kid like my daughter, she&#39;s never felt like she&#39;s dropped out of life by dropping out of school.  Learning and living are all intertwined together in this natural streaming, seamless process.  I loaned my copy to my daughter&#39;s boyfriend, who has it stashed in his room somewhere where  his dad can&#39;t find it.  He&#39;s read some of it.  One day, I may get it back!<br/>

For a kid that really wants to be in school though, this book might feel a bit manipulative!<br/>

<br/>
He published nine and two more were published after his death.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt is good for getting ideas into your head.   If you want to better <br/>
understand how humans learn and how harmful schools can be, John Holt&#39;s <br/>
books would be a good place to start.<br/>
<br/>
This ties in with what Sandra wrote in the &quot;to bathe or not to bathe?&quot; <br/>
thread:<br/>
<br/>
*Each individual family needs to be able to understand, defend and<br/>
justify what they&#39;re doing and why. *<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s books can help you develop a defense and justification of your <br/>
choice to keep your kids out of school.<br/>
<br/>
(For help with specific unschooling problems or questions I think this list <br/>
is a better resource.)<br/>
<br/>
Some of Holt&#39;s early books were written when he was working for school <br/>
reform.  They are wonderful because they shine the spotlight on human <br/>
learning and on what schools do wrong.   I think everyone should read them. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Instead of Education&quot; is a really interesting book that doesn&#39;t get <br/>
mentioned much.   He wrote it after he wrote the pretty radical, &quot;Escape <br/>
From Childhood.&quot;     It is not like what you can read on this list but it <br/>
will help you build your understanding of human learning and may give you <br/>
some good arguments for keeping your kids out of school.  It&#39;s short, just a <br/>
couple hundred pages.<br/>
<br/>
I really like all the Holt books but I know some people find them kind of <br/>
dry.  I like the way he wrote.  I like the way he thought.  I enjoyed his <br/>
progression of ideas from his first book in 1964 to his last in 1981.<br/>
<br/>
If you get the first two books, &quot;How Children Fail&quot; and &quot;How Children <br/>
Learn,&quot; get the revised editions.  Holt comments some on his own ideas and <br/>
notes where he has changed his opinion.   Those are very interesting.   If <br/>
you buy &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; get the 1981 edition and skip the revised version <br/>
that was updated by Pat Farenga.<br/>
<br/>
For good information and advice about highly evolved unschooling keep <br/>
reading this list.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; dry. I like the way he wrote. I like the way he thought. I enjoyed his<br/>
&gt; progression of ideas from his first book in 1964 to his last in 1981.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have MUCH respect for Holt being able to change his analysis and ideas and<br/>
suggestions for solutions.   In some ways I saw it as him rejecting some of<br/>
the attempts to make him a guru and unschooling a cult.  I was also<br/>
fascinated watching him change both in his books and perhaps moreso in the<br/>
pages of Growing Without Schooling. I think it is important to remember that<br/>
even though Holt tried hard not to lean on his privileged &quot;credentials&quot;,  it<br/>
was impossible for his philosophy not to have been influenced by same.<br/>
Just as there is not a complete substitute for everyday parental experience<br/>
in learning about children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; If you get the first two books, &quot;How Children Fail&quot; and &quot;How Children<br/>
&gt; Learn,&quot; get the revised editions. Holt comments some on his own ideas and<br/>
&gt; notes where he has changed his opinion. Those are very interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always preferred How Children Fail to How Children Learn (I read both in<br/>
high school in the 60s along with Herndon and Kozol).<br/>
I still disagree with some of the observations and Piaget interpretations in<br/>
How Children Learn but find How Children Fail to be &quot;spot on&quot;  with<br/>
&quot;scripts&quot; children and teachers utilize.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If<br/>
&gt; you buy &quot;Teach Your Own&quot; get the 1981 edition and skip the revised version<br/>
&gt; that was updated by Pat Farenga.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got a first edition of Teach Your own but it didn&#39;t fully resonate with<br/>
me.   Just how much revision did Farenga do?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; For good information and advice about highly evolved unschooling keep<br/>
&gt; reading this list.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Deb Lewis<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My opinion is that reading Holt is still relevant for &quot;deep background&quot; and<br/>
especially for the idea of respecting children or developmentally disabled<br/>
humans or &quot;poorly educated&quot; adults.    His ideas that &quot;properly schooled&quot;<br/>
does not at all equate &quot;well educated&quot;  or especially &quot;intelligent&quot;  are<br/>
still fresh and relevant.     But I also agree that places like this list<br/>
can provide information which might well be similar to what Holt would have<br/>
evolved into but for his untimely death nearly 25 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in others opinions (current or past) about Escape From<br/>
Childhood.<br/>

I was just reading it recently.  Didn&#39;t finish; read it a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
It had interesting historical accounts, but as to modern life, it  <br/>
seemed to me that it could only have been written by someone who  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a parent himself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352726490">I must agree... Rue Kream&#39;s book, Parenting a Free Child is SO wonderful!  I have recently found an incredibly Unschooly type book by Avi.  It is called The Beginning of the End:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Beginning-Being-Adventures-Smaller/dp/0152049681">http://www.amazon.com/End-Beginning-Being-Adventures-Smaller/dp/0152049681</a><br/>
Read this book and see right now as very valuable and exactly perfect!  I read it AFTER my ten year old read it.  He loved it at his level and I totally loved it at my &quot;sometimes questioning unschooing mama&quot; level!<br/>
