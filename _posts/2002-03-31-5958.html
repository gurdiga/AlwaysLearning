<div id="ygrps-yiv-609131078">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
I had a very strange experience today... Myself and several women friends<br/>
attended a women&#39;s spiritual workshop on our bodies, weight, the connections<br/>
between all of them.  The workshop was very enlightened and it was great to<br/>
meet all these women working on themselves...<br/>
<br/>
So what does this have to do with unschooling you might ask... One of the<br/>
last exercises that we did was where the facilitator (a Dr) showed us how<br/>
people can continue a cycle that is hard to break when it comes to<br/>
understanding our bodies.  She drew 2 pictures the first picture she drew<br/>
was a stick person holding out a book with a stern look on their face (this<br/>
person was labeled The Perpetrator).  To the left of this large person was a<br/>
small stick person (this person was labeled The Victim) and the 3rd stick<br/>
person was next to the Victim, but larger than the victim and called the<br/>
Rebel.... She explained that it is a cycle..... The next picture was of a<br/>
mother or father or loving person holding a smaller stick person on their<br/>
lap and lovingly showing the person the book....<br/>
<br/>
She was telling us that with our bodies we perpetrate ourselves, then we<br/>
become victims, and then we rebel... The other picture is about having<br/>
somebody loving (ourselves) take care of ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Now instead of me seeing this as representing the food thing I was there<br/>
for... It was crystal clear that she was talking about school....  The<br/>
teacher was the perpetrator, who is a stranger, the child was the victim who<br/>
then rebels and acts out.... Alternatively at home learning the loving<br/>
person is holding the child and teaching them rather than scolding and<br/>
shamming them....<br/>
<br/>
I thought this was a very interesting analogy.<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday a wonderful, responsible, beautiful girl, about 15 years old, <br/>
dropped out of the play we&#39;re in the midst of rehearsals for. Her mother <br/>
tearfully called to tell me her daughter had an eating disorder and was <br/>
probably on her way to being hospitalized. This isn&#39;t an unschooling <br/>
family, but they are kind, loving and supportive of each other and have <br/>
always homeschooled. The mother said she has been waiting for a doctor <br/>
or therapist to bring up homeschooling, at which time she was going to <br/>
innocently say, &quot;Oh, you mean only homeschooled girls have this <br/>
problem?&quot; So far no one has said anything about that.<br/>
<br/>
I know another homeschooled girl who was anorexic for a couple of years <br/>
and yet another who is having huge depression problems right now. I <br/>
guess no one&#39;s immune.<br/>

If you find out any more about these girls and possibly some of the <br/>
causes for their problems, would you please let us know.  I&#39;d like to <br/>
know how these problems can be minimized.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that often the reasons are very complex however I&#39;ve always <br/>
thought that anorexia and bulemia were control issues.  Children that <br/>
are not appreciated for who they really are and feel they need to do <br/>
things, change, to please others do not have the sense that they have <br/>
any control over their own lives.  They then feel a sense of power <br/>
and control over their eating and of course they get compliments for <br/>
their trim figure which perpetuate the problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191429875">I know that in many cases control is the major issue.  Speaking for myself,<br/>
I felt bombarded by images of &quot;beauty&quot; and didn&#39;t know any women in my life<br/>
who were happy with the way they looked.  I also heard, &quot;She&#39;s so thin&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Aren&#39;t you pretty&quot; so often when I was little that I thought it was<br/>
supposed to be part of who I was.<br/>
<br/>
When my first daughter was born, I decided I would have to pretend to be<br/>
comfortable in my own skin.  By the time my second daughter was born four<br/>
years later, I wasn&#39;t pretending any more.<br/>
<br/>
We are also very conscious of the things people say to and around our<br/>
daughters, and of what they are seeing in the media - and we talk to them<br/>
about it.  Many times it appears kids aren&#39;t listening when they are.  We<br/>
just assume they hear everything.  So, for example, when the mothers at the<br/>
pool are complaining to each other and saying no way will they get in a<br/>
bathing suit, we talk on the ride home about how bodies don&#39;t only change at<br/>
puberty, but throughout life, and it&#39;s sad that some people don&#39;t enjoy the<br/>
changes that time and childbearing bring.  More importantly, I&#39;m not sitting<br/>
on the side of the pool in my clothes.  I am IN the pool playing with my<br/>
kids - not thinking about what I look like, so they know I believe what I am<br/>
saying.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it is not always very complex.  The easiest way to create a<br/>
bulimic is to control what they eat from the time they are children.<br/>
Trusting your child to know when she is hungry, how much and what to eat is<br/>
a pretty good way to ensure that food is not going to become an issue.<br/>
<br/>
There are some signs you can look for:  moving food around on the plate, not<br/>
letting the fork touch the lips or tongue, looking to the parent while<br/>
filling the plate to get invisible approval over the choices, sneaking food,<br/>
withdrawn behavior, and speaking very quietly were some signs that no one<br/>
saw in me, but there are many others as well.  There have been some good<br/>
books written by anorexic/bulimics - none of which I can think of right now<br/>
:0).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692969733">I was bulimic as a teenager living in a household where my life was <br/>
very tightly controlled (&quot;grounding&quot; being the preferred method of <br/>
punishment).  The interesting thing is that my parents were not <br/>
really controlling at all around food or eating, and did not have <br/>
serious body issues of their own.  It happened that everyone in my <br/>
family is quite thin naturally (even underweight, by insurance <br/>
charts), so no one was telling me that I was &quot;fat.&quot;  But everyone in <br/>
my family decided together to go on Weight Watchers when I was about <br/>
15 (none of us had more than 5 pounds to lose, I don&#39;t think).  This <br/>
diet started really by coincidence only a few months before a <br/>
parental &quot;crackdown&quot; that included surveillance (reading my diary, <br/>
calling me at friends&#39; houses to verify that I was really there, <br/>
checking with friends&#39; parents about what I was doing), which lead to <br/>
the destruction of my trust in them, and then a series of groundings. <br/>
During this time my parents still did not try to control my food or <br/>
eating, but it really was one of the few things I felt _I_ could <br/>
control, and so I did, and did so compulsively, which lead to bulimia <br/>
which lasted for about 4 years.  I &quot;cured&quot; myself by following the <br/>
advice of Geneen Roth, who has written a number of books in which she <br/>
advocates eliminating restrictions on your eating and really just <br/>
trusting yourself and your appetites.  The short version of my story <br/>
is that when I stopped trying to control it I stopped (over time) <br/>
being obsessive about it.<br/>
<br/>
There are obviously lots of other issues involved, but for me I think <br/>
control  really was the operative one.<br/>
