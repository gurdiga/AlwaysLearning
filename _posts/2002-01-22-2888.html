<br/>
In Texas, I distinctly remember going into filling stations as a kid, and<br/>
the displays of watches, lighters, etc would be locked up on Sundays. You<br/>
could still buy gas and food, though, fasting not being mandatory, I guess.<br/>
There are some companies (Chick-Fil-A, eg) that still don&#39;t open on Sundays<br/>
because of corporate Christian policy. They&#39;re also the ones who advocate<br/>
hiring homeschoolers, FWIW.<br/>
<br/>
An aside:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And someone from a country where they go bare-breasted can&#39;t do it here.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But<br/>
I learned on Sunday Morning that they could, if they wanted to, do it in<br/>
Toronto.<br/>
