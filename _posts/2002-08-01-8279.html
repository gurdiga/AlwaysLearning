<div id="ygrps-yiv-166400648">The biggest problem with big beds is big bedding....it<br/>
is cumbersome and heavy. Hard to clean and get dry<br/>
again. Getting the sand from little feet out of the<br/>
middle takes forever.One little pee spot is a major<br/>
chore!! ..And great big quilts are a pain to<br/>
make...cumbersome and heavy and hard to clean and get<br/>
dry again. <br/>
<br/>
Same with great big tubs and showers....you have to<br/>
get in them to clean them!!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you let the servants take care of it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176935242">When we share beds we often have separate covers.  That way people can have <br/>
their own, they can get in and out without waking up other people and one can <br/>
have lots of covers while others have less.<br/>
<br/>
I have my own covers on Holly&#39;s bed.  Whether I&#39;m there or not doesn&#39;t <br/>
disturb her own covers.  <br/>
<br/>
I have more blankets than Keith does in the big bed.  If a kid comes in, it <br/>
usually waked me up enough these days that after they&#39;re asleep I leave my <br/>
own covers on them and go do something.  I&#39;m not a big sleeper.<br/>
