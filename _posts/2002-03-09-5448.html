&gt; <br/>
&gt; means she has to be with an adult all the time I&#39;d rather leave her home.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I&#39;m one of the HSC people with the stupid ageist rules, I&#39;ll respond. <br/>
But I won&#39;t go around and around again on this. Been there; wasted my breath <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
I was the HSC Board member responsible for the Sacramento conference last <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing this for 11 years and have tried a number of different <br/>
approaches. We now state officially that kids should be accompanied by a <br/>
responsible adult at all times. Then we leave it up to the responsible ADULTS <br/>
to decide what that means in their own individual case. Some kids are fine on <br/>
their own. Maybe with your kid, being somewhere in the hotel is enough <br/>
&quot;accompaniment.&quot; Most of us with younger children have walked them to <br/>
workshops, seen them settled in, go to our own workshops, go back to pick <br/>
them up immediately at the end of their workshop. There is no problem with <br/>
this, especially if you mention which workshop you&#39;ll be in to one of the <br/>
adults who IS staying around, just in case your child needs you, and also <br/>
make sure the child knows where to find you. If your child isn&#39;t capable of <br/>
remembering where you said you&#39;d be, they probably ought not to be out and <br/>
about in the hotel all on their own. Most of us meet other parents there, <br/>
too, and if we do have kids who need an adult to be closer, we trade off <br/>
hanging around nearby. Or, if a kid wants to go to a workshop that is likely <br/>
to be difficult for them on their own - say a 5 yo wants to go to a <br/>
bookmaking workshop that is aimed more at 10 to 12 yo&#39;s - then an adult <br/>
really ought to go IN with them to be there to help their own child so that <br/>
the child isn&#39;t frustrated. The workshop presenters will always do their <br/>
best, but if they have a lot of kids, one young kid may not get the personal <br/>
attention they might need unless they have their own adult with them. Again, <br/>
parents have to use their judgement, but if there is a problem, we can always <br/>
remind them that we already said THEY are responsible for their child.<br/>
<br/>
When I did my cooperative games workshop, I had a couple of young children <br/>
there - no adults in sight. They played for a while and then ran off. I was <br/>
not in a position to follow them and make sure they were okay - I was busy <br/>
running a workshop. I don&#39;t know if that was okay with the parents - I don&#39;t <br/>
know if the parents told the kids to STAY in my workshop or if they told the <br/>
kids they could just leave and go run around the hotel on their own - or what <br/>
they may have told the kids. BUT if the parents came to me and complained <br/>
that I&#39;d LET them run off on their own, I&#39;d have reminded them that it was <br/>
THEIR responsibility to keep track of them, not mine.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because we say that kids must be accompanied by a responsible adult, it <br/>
gives us the ability to deal with it easily when there is a real problem with <br/>
a truly disruptive kid by simply telling the parents that they must stay with <br/>
the child. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody polices this. Nobody even WANTS every single kid to have an adult with <br/>
them - there isn&#39;t room in the workshop rooms. We hope it means there will be <br/>
some extra adults at all the kids workshops - so that the workshop presenter <br/>
has some help. Also, one adult can be responsible for a number of kids - even <br/>
the young kids don&#39;t have to have their own parent with them all the time.  <br/>
There are many opportunities to meet other parents and make trade <br/>
arrangements. And, although I&#39;ve heard the argument that you may not want to <br/>
make a &quot;stranger&quot; responsible for your child -- and I can understand that -- <br/>
I fail to understand why you&#39;d think it was safer to let the child run around <br/>
the hotel all alone.<br/>
<br/>
At the cooperative games workshop last year I had a big group of kids with no <br/>
other adults. One of the kids stepped on a bee and was stung on the bottom of <br/>
her foot. I got lucky and the children&#39;s program coordinator just HAPPENED to <br/>
walk by right then and she took the girl to get treated.  Otherwise I&#39;d have <br/>
had to cancel the rest of the workshop to take care of her. We also hope that <br/>
it means people will realize that they remain responsible for their own kids <br/>
- we don&#39;t sign them in and out, we don&#39;t keep them in the room when the <br/>
workshop is over - waiting for their parents - we don&#39;t offer any kind of <br/>
babysitting service. We&#39;ve DONE that in the past - it hasn&#39;t worked out well <br/>
at all. <br/>
<br/>
The hotel is lots of buildings all spread out over a wide area - it is open <br/>
to the public and you have to cross parking lots to get from one workshop to <br/>
another and there is a swimming pool and a big lake right in the middle of <br/>
everything. The conference must be very clear that we are not taking <br/>
responsibility for the children. You might not realize what poor judgement <br/>
some people use. Last year someone sent a 2 year old to go around from one <br/>
workshop to another with an older sibling - an 11 yo. The older sibling got <br/>
interested in something and the 2 yo disappeared.  This is not at all a place <br/>
that is safe for a 2 yo to be wandering around on their own.<br/>
<br/>
My kids all go all over and to all the workshops totally on their own. My <br/>
youngest is now 11. When she was littler, I made sure someone walked her to <br/>
and from each workshop - either myself or another adult. My kids are easy to <br/>
get along with, comfortable asking someone for help if they need it, not <br/>
disruptive in a workshop or likely to be destructive to property or annoying <br/>
to other conference attendees, and they are extremely sensible about parking <br/>
lots, swimming pools, and lakes. They can go around on their own and I can be <br/>
confident that nobody is going to complain or have a problem with it. IF they <br/>
did - if my kids were causing problems - the conference coordinator would be <br/>
able to tell me that I&#39;m supposed to make sure they are accompanied by a <br/>
responsible adult and that would be that. <br/>
<br/>
And the &quot;stupid ageist rules&quot; that she is talking about are that the TEENS <br/>
have some workshops - an opening and closing session - that are for teens <br/>
only. There are around 150 teens and the room can barely hold them all. Space <br/>
is a major factor in many decisions - there is a need to try to spread <br/>
attendees out among all the workshops going on at the same time and not have <br/>
them all try to crowd into just one or two of the workshops. For another, <br/>
they are doing very &quot;teen&quot; types of things in some of the teen workshops - <br/>
these aren&#39;t arts and crafts workshops - there are serious discussion <br/>
sessions about teen experiences and feelings. Many workshops are open to kids <br/>
of all ages - including teens, children, and adults.<br/>
<br/>
The children&#39;s workshops have recommended ages - not because kids of other <br/>
ages are not allowed - any age kids are allowed at any children&#39;s workshop. <br/>
This information didn&#39;t used to be included in the conference program but was <br/>
REQUESTED by conference attendees - so that they could have some idea of the <br/>
age range the workshop was aimed at - to help the kids in deciding which <br/>
workshops they wanted to attend because there are so many to choose from and <br/>
it is HARD to make those choices.<br/>
<br/>
I know Holly and she&#39;ll be just fine. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, I was specifically told that this was *not* okay.  It was probably<br/>
on the HSC list, but it may have been at a northern California HSC<br/>
get-together we went to. Nope (checking archives for June 11 and 12 of<br/>
2001),  it was on the list, and all of the official HCS people who posted<br/>
agreed that each child needed to have a responsible adult with them at<br/>
each workshop they attended.  In support of this, an example was given of<br/>
two children who were dropped off and not picked up at the end of a<br/>
workshop. It was suggested that people (even people posting who had<br/>
responsible 9 and 11 year old kids) bring  a designated sitter to<br/>
accompany he kids to workshops. No one said anything about your<br/>
individual child being responsible enough to do anything independently,<br/>
unless they had hit the magic age of 13. So if things have changed,<br/>
that&#39;s wonderful, but the message last year was different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; And the &quot;stupid ageist rules&quot; that she is talking about are that the <br/>
&gt; TEENS  have some workshops - an opening and closing session - that are<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; teens  only. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, no, it wasn&#39;t the opening or closing session she was interested<br/>
in, it was (of course) the theater workshop. There was no theater<br/>
workshop offered for &quot;kids&quot;. At that time she&#39;d already participated in<br/>
theater groups with teens, and was (and still is) passionate about All<br/>
Things Theater, and a friend who was a teen was planning to go to that<br/>
workshop and they wanted to go together....<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that I posted without thinking that some of the same people<br/>
from that discussion were here (clearly I rarely look at names). I would<br/>
have, and should have, phrased it differently.  I do still have strong<br/>
feelings about the whole issue.<br/>

If you go with a plan it should work out for you.  I went with lots of<br/>
back up including a husband, but even if he wasn&#39;t there, I had <br/>
friends and a teen/young adult friend whom I paid to watch my<br/>
kids.  I had every intention of switching off with her, but she<br/>
was perfectly fine taking the kids here and there, letting them<br/>
meet up with their friends, we would pick up a spare child or<br/>
two and I got to catch a lot of workshops.  Our family had such<br/>
a great time, we are all looking forward to going again.  If would<br/>
be great if you could make arrangements or meet up with some<br/>
folks to trade off, &quot;I&#39;ll take the kids during this session, you do the<br/>
next&quot; and so on. And if all else fails you can always purchase tapes<br/>
of the sessions.  <br/>
