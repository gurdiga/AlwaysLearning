<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173666191">Sometimes it is really hard to be an advocate for your children.  <br/>
Over the last week and a half I have been put into a position of <br/>
acting and speaking on my child&#39;s behalf in a way that was <br/>
uncomfortable for me.<br/>
<br/>
It was uncomfortable because I tend to be shy and non-<br/>
confrontational, not wanting to rock the boat.  However, when my kids <br/>
really need something that they feel they can&#39;t get for themselves, <br/>
whatever it is, as a parent, I have to put myself out there.  I do it <br/>
because my children are far more important than my discomfort!<br/>
<br/>
I just got back into the house after such a confrontation with the <br/>
neighbors.  My heart is still beating fast, but I did it.  Chamille <br/>
really wants her friend, the neighbor girl, to stay the night <br/>
tonight.  They are in the process of moving and her dad and stepmom <br/>
are splitting up.  Dad is moving about 2 blocks away next weekend, <br/>
and stepmom moved about 30 min away into her own place.  Chamille&#39;s <br/>
friend is over at stepmom&#39;s house while their current place is being <br/>
cleaned.<br/>
<br/>
They always have reasons for not letting their daughter spend time <br/>
with mine, mostly trivial and stupid reasons.  So, when I saw the <br/>
stepmom drive up to the house across the street, I went over there to <br/>
ask if the daughter could stay the night.  Her immediate reaction was <br/>
that &quot;no she couldn&#39;t because she wasn&#39;t going to be coming back out <br/>
this way after going home.&quot;.  I knew this was going to be the answer <br/>
from the getgo.  They are very predictable that way.  I removed that <br/>
barrier by offering to do the driving.  Then, it was, &quot;I&#39;ll have to <br/>
ask her dad.&quot;, again I knew it was going to be the next answer.  Then <br/>
up he drives so I ask him repeating my offer to drive.  They say they <br/>
will get back to me.  I took away their excuses, and are, I&#39;m sure, <br/>
trying to come up with another one that I would actually buy.  I put <br/>
them in a position of having to justify their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
It was uncomfortable for me to do this because I knew it would be <br/>
confrontational.  Chamille won&#39;t even talk to them anymore because <br/>
they don&#39;t like her and she can feel it, even though they say that <br/>
isn&#39;t the case.  She is afraid of them.  Their daughter won&#39;t ask <br/>
because she knows they will say &quot;no&quot; and offer no explanation and <br/>
expect her to accept the answer.  They can&#39;t do that with me and they <br/>
know it, so I psyched myself up for it and went over there and did it <br/>
for them.  I am willing to be the &quot;bad guy&quot; for them so they don&#39;t <br/>
have to.  They seem to have it in their heads that moving will <br/>
dissipate the friendship, however, I will make it clear by my actions <br/>
that if the friendship dissipates it is all them.  The kids aren&#39;t <br/>
stupid, they know what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
Over and over my parenting skills are tested this way.  Over and <br/>
over, I put my children&#39;s feelings over my own discomfort, because I <br/>
am their advocate when they need me to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Confronting friends, or inlaws, or whoever, is just one of many ways <br/>
we can be advocates for our kids.  It can be uncomfortable for people <br/>
like me who don&#39;t like dischord, who aren&#39;t outspoken, and maybe even <br/>
shy.  I have to say though, my kids are so much more important than <br/>
all that discomfort.  They absolutely know this without a doubt.  <br/>
<br/>
They trust me to act on their behalf, they trust me that they have <br/>
their best interest at heart.  This lends itself to every aspect of <br/>
their lives.  That deep trust allows them to accept my answers to <br/>
their questions, or to accept an answer of &quot;no&quot; from me because they <br/>
truly know that if I could I would.  That I do everything in my power <br/>
to find a way for &quot;yes&quot; to happen.  It also allows them to be able to <br/>
question my actions freely when they feel that I&#39;m wrong, without <br/>
fear of punishment, largely because if I&#39;ve said &quot;no&quot; to something <br/>
that doesn&#39;t make sense, it is glaringly obvious to them and they <br/>
correct me in my error.<br/>
<br/>
All of this, for me, is at the heart of unschooling.  My job, my <br/>
life, is for my kids for as long as they need me.  It lends itself <br/>
well to learning in a happy stress free environment.  And I get to <br/>
grow as a person as a side effect!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109706949">Thanks for posting this!  Very inspirational.  I&#39;ve definitely come out of my shell a bit since <br/>
beginning unschooling, but not as much as I could.  Fear of conflict is what drives me from <br/>
speaking out sometimes, but I realize that it will only damage my relationship with my <br/>
children if I don&#39;t.  Your post motivates me to be my child&#39;s advocate 100%, because even <br/>
if it&#39;s something that seems trivial to me, it isn&#39;t to them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>
