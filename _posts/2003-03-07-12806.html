&lt;&lt; I went to college in Portland, Oregon, in the late &#39;80s.  There was a <br/>
 restaurant downtown, in Chinatown, that was open super-late, and people <br/>
 tended to go there after a long night of drinking.  It was called &quot;Hung Phar <br/>
 Low.&quot;  Not sure if it&#39;s still there, but it was always fun to say... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I moved there in &#39;87...Vancouver actually, but Portland was my stompin&#39; <br/>
grounds until five years ago.<br/>
I miss those late night restaraunts, nothing is open very late here.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
