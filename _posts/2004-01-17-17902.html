So show him how to take the good of our society and disregard the bad.  Not<br/>
by refusing to get Barbie sheets (or whatever) for him if he wants<br/>
them.....but by living YOUR life according to your convictions.<br/>
That&#39;s right, so if your convictions say don&#39;t buy those Barbie sheets, <br/>
don&#39;t. If you buy them, then your not living YOUR life. If he wants them, he can <br/>
save his money and by them himself. Then you can both live your own lives by <br/>
your own convictions.<br/>

I bought character sheets for my daughters once, they were crap, I didn&#39;t buy <br/>
them again.<br/>
