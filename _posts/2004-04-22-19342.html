<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827036962">You know, if the people who send this child oppressing, disrepecting crap<br/>
around EVER got an e-mail said we wished their children could grow up<br/>
respected and free from the fear of assault and punishment and free from<br/>
the oppression of traditional parenting, and societies rigid confinement<br/>
of children etc.,  they would be HOWLING about the insulting nature of<br/>
such an e-mail and whining about how parenting is a hard job and how<br/>
parents deserve respect and blah, blah, blah...<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I yelled. <br/>
<br/>
Nice job,  Kelly.   That&#39;s all I really meant to say. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
