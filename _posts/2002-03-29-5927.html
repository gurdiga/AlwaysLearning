<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844724491">I thought perhaps I&#39;d share this story with you guys about my siblings. I<br/>
always think it&#39;s nice to see stories about adult homeschoolers as it gives<br/>
me additional courage to really know that what our family is doing &quot;works.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My sister is now 22 and we pulled her and her twin brother out of public<br/>
school at age 13. They pretty much deschooled and then unschooled after<br/>
that and both have associate degrees but have taken interesting paths. Tim<br/>
spent a year Euro-railing around Europe and then followed his childhood<br/>
interest by spending another year in Paris at the Cordon Bleu cooking<br/>
school. He is now doing an internship on a cruiseship that travels around<br/>
the world. He&#39;s just been promoted to assistant chef which is good. He<br/>
LOVES what he does.<br/>
<br/>
And my sister Joanna is currently visiting us in Abu Dhabi after teaching<br/>
for the last few months in Africa. While in Kenya, teaching near Lake<br/>
Nikuru, she met some people who travel every weekend to work in a Sudanese<br/>
refugee camp in Uganda. They gradually shared with her all about the<br/>
history and culture of Sudan and she has amazed us all with her knowledge<br/>
and desire to know more.<br/>
Anyway she visited the camp and has now been offered a teaching position<br/>
there. So when she leaves us in 6 weeks she is heading back to Kenya and<br/>
then on to Uganda (a 14 hour bus ride across very bumpy terrain).<br/>
<br/>
The 8 American volunteers live in an armed encampment an hour away from the<br/>
camp with running water and electricity. The British volunteers live in<br/>
grass-roofed clay houses in the camp and haul water from the well -- they<br/>
go to bed when it&#39;s dark as there is no electricity. Jo has opted to stay<br/>
with the Brits as she believes it is wrong to live differently than the<br/>
people you are trying to help.<br/>
<br/>
She took loads of photos and is now trying to find friends of hers back in<br/>
the US to sponsor some kids of a new friend of hers who is dying of AIDS.<br/>
The father died last year and the mother is almost dead and cannot afford<br/>
medication. The grandparents will love and care for the two children (4 and<br/>
5 and no HIV) but have no money for school fees. <br/>
<br/>
Jo also wants to go back and help an old woman she met in the refugee camp.<br/>
The woman is very sick and elderly and gets very little care. When Jo met<br/>
her it had rained for a few days and since you can see daylight in the<br/>
holes in her straw roof tiny house, she was living in deep mud. The aid<br/>
workers try and help but they have 15,000 people to care for.<br/>
<br/>
As she showed me the pictures, Jo cried for these people and vowed to share<br/>
their stories. Her goal is to educate people about the plight of the<br/>
Sudanese who have been at war for many years and are often forgotten.<br/>
She has also decided that when she goes back to the US she would like to<br/>
finish her BS in archaeology partly because of her desire to try and go and<br/>
study caves in Sudan that have ancient but nonstudied drawings and relics<br/>
in them.<br/>
<br/>
While she is here in Abu Dhabi she is going to volunteer at the UNICEF<br/>
office so she can get experience in the fund-raising side of aid<br/>
organizations.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow I thought I&#39;d update you guys on her continuing education so far.<br/>
Pretty good for a kid who spent her first two years hs&#39;ing (she didn&#39;t gain<br/>
freedom until age 13) watching television and whining about mom not buying<br/>
her enough &quot;stuff.&quot; <br/>
