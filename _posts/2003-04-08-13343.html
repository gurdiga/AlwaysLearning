<div id="ygrps-yiv-306571062">Janene made a few choices in the last few days about food that I found <br/>
particularly funny. <br/>
Last night we went to red robin and she didn&#39;t want anything off the <br/>
child&#39;s menu, which happens occasionally and I personally don&#39;t care <br/>
what they eat, so that&#39;s fine.  So after reading a bunch of stuff off <br/>
the adutls menu, she finally decided on fried clams.<br/>
<br/>
Today we ended up going to red robin again (long story, we don&#39;t usually <br/>
eat out this must) and I asked her if she had liked the clams. She said <br/>
&quot;only the inside.&quot;  I realized that all the breading that she had left <br/>
in front of her on the table had been on purpose, she had been taking <br/>
off the breading and eating only the clams. <br/>
Today she again didn&#39;t want anything on the children&#39;s menu. INstead, <br/>
she wanted fajitas. <br/>
She was espeically interested in the onions. <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; As far as food issues and food freedom, I myself feel that young<br/>
&gt; children need to be guided and encouraged with what they eat.  I try to<br/>
&gt; not have much &quot;junk&quot; food in the house but if it is here (thanks to dh)<br/>
&gt; the girls would choose a bag of Cheetos over dinner.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course they will. You limit them.<br/>
&gt; My kids would have chosen the junk over the good stuff every time <br/>
&gt; while I was<br/>
&gt; controlling their diet.<br/>
&gt; Now, after a couple years of de-fooding, they will eat everything and<br/>
&gt; anything without all the hang ups.<br/>
&gt; Sierra will beg for tofu and brocolli! They ask me to make up platters of<br/>
&gt; carrots and celery to dip in ranch dressing. They also like their &quot;junk&quot;<br/>
&gt; food, but by letting go of control over their food choices, they can <br/>
&gt; now KNOW<br/>
&gt; their own bodies and be balanced individuals.<br/>
&gt; Demonizing certain foods only makes the problem worse.<br/>
&gt; Your kids will continue to be obsessed with the less healthy food choices<br/>
&gt; until you decide to trust them.<br/>

&gt; flowers are<br/>
&gt; growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the<br/>
&gt; magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in<br/>
&gt; me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
