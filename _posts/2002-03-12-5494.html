<div id="ygrps-yiv-615373660">On March 18 from 1-2pm, the Mark Steiner Show (a public radio show based in<br/>
Baltimore) will do a program with Chris Bobel, the author of *The Paradox of<br/>
Natural Mothering* published by Temple University Press<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1581_reg.html)">http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1581_reg.html)</a>. The program will<br/>
discuss homeschooling as one of the aspects of &quot;natural parenting&quot; and will<br/>
also include homebirthing, extended nursing, and natural health care. Billy<br/>
Greer of the Family Unschoolers Network will be one of the guests for the<br/>
program.<br/>
