<div id="ygrps-yiv-283894264">My husband and I are trying to decide whether or not to let our 10 yo  <br/>
daughter ride in the front seat of the car (with airbag.)  She  really wants to ride <br/>
up there, and I&#39;m inclined to say it&#39;s fine, especially for  an upcoming long <br/>
trip she and I will be taking, but we haven&#39;t been able to let  go of the <br/>
highway safety advisories saying that kids under 13 should  ALWAYS ride in back, <br/>
and we worry that we may be doing something  stupid.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m having trouble weeding through the available information.  It  seems that <br/>
most incidences of passenger airbag fatalities are caused by  unbelted kids <br/>
or little ones in car seats.  And that if you move the seat  all the way back <br/>
the danger is greatly reduced if not prevented.  Then  again, we live in <br/>
Southern California where we have lots of traffic and  accidents and careless <br/>
drivers.<br/>
 <br/>
I found this particularly interesting:<br/>
 <br/>
Several Factors<br/>
Is there something magical about age 13 that  automatically makes children <br/>
fit to sit up front? Are they big enough at that  age to withstand the airbag <br/>
forces or grown up enough to behave up front?  <br/>
It&#39;s a little of both, actually. NHTSA officials said the agency  basically <br/>
selected age 12 for the cutoff after reviewing crash statistics that  showed <br/>
problems with frontal airbags seemed to decline as children get older.  <br/>
Maturity Weighs In<br/>
Behavior is part of the problem. “Kids play  with the radio,” move around <br/>
and tend not to be in proper position when an  airbag deploys in a crash, NHTSA <br/>
spokeswoman Liz Neblett said.  <br/>
Proximity to the frontal airbag is a big issue in airbag-caused injuries  and <br/>
deaths; so is being properly positioned in the seat.  <br/>
“Theoretically, we didn&#39;t know how successful you can be . . . in  teaching a <br/>
child never to lean forward” in the front seat, said a NHTSA  researcher who <br/>
asked not to be named, explaining why the agency felt obligated  to list an <br/>
age.  <br/>
Don&#39;t discount behavior out of hand. Some kids can&#39;t seem to sit still  for <br/>
longer than 30 seconds at a time. Indeed, one longtime child safety advocate  <br/>
said the NHTSA recommendation, while somewhat arbitrary in its age selection,  <br/>
helped the agency send a simple, important message to parents.  <br/>
Size Matters, Too<br/>
The NHTSA researcher also said the agency  recognizes that “somewhere in that <br/>
area” of 11 and 12 years of age, “you have  bigger children” who are more <br/>
akin to adults in size.  <br/>
Nancy Delaney, chairperson of the Metro Detroit Safe Kids Coalition, said  <br/>
physical stature matters because it&#39;s difficult for children to keep their  <br/>
distance from that front airbag and keep their back against the seatback if  their <br/>
feet don&#39;t touch the floor. “They tend to scrunch down” in the seat so  <br/>
their feet touch the floor and then they&#39;re out of position for the deployment  of <br/>
the frontal airbag, she said.  <br/>
On the other hand, she noted that there also could be a problem with  <br/>
children who pass age 12 and still are rather small. Parents think they can  <br/>
automatically ride up front, but perhaps they should reconsider. “You get these  kids <br/>
who are two-thirds leg [in body size] and they&#39;re willowy,” she said. “I&#39;m  <br/>
really tempted to keep them in a car seat” in the back seat, where they would <br/>
be  safest.  <br/>
A Simple Truth That Saves Lives<br/>
An often-overlooked fact, NHTSA  advises that all people, including adults, <br/>
are safest in the back seat,  regardless of size or behavior. <br/>
--- <br/>
So what do you all think?  Am I making too big of a deal out of  it?  Or not <br/>
enough?  Most of our friends are super safety-conscious  and I&#39;m sure that <br/>
affects our thinking.  Nowadays everything&#39;s  the parents&#39; fault, so part of us <br/>
fears that guilt and blame from ourselves  and others would make an unthinkable <br/>
tragedy that much more  tragic. But on the other hand it&#39;d be cool to have my <br/>
daughter up  front sitting next to me, especially when it&#39;s just us in the  <br/>
car.<br/>

She should not sit in the front seat?<br/>

What about hyperactive people who fidget and want to lean over and  <br/>

they did their butt-saving-in-court duty.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just encountered this issue recently when we finally got a car new <br/>
enough to have a passenger-side airbag.  I did all that same <br/>
research, and then Liam and I discussed it.  I told him all about the <br/>
research and the statistics and that injuries occur when folks-big <br/>
and small-are too close to the bag if it deploys.  So, armed with all <br/>
that information, it was *his* choice.  I told him if he wanted to <br/>
continue riding in the front seat (something we both wanted), we&#39;d <br/>
just need to be sure that his seat was as far back as possible and <br/>
that he stayed in the belt (something he&#39;s too smart not to do; he&#39;d <br/>
*never* ride in the car without wanting the belt on).  He agreed that <br/>
it would be better to minimize bending forward, but not to be crazy <br/>
or racked with fear about it.  I do my part by being a very safe <br/>
driver, and I *know* we&#39;ll be all right.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is after all that, when he got into the front seat of <br/>
our new car for the first time, the airbag light for the passenger <br/>
side indicated that the bag was &quot;off&quot; and would not deploy because, <br/>
said the manual, there was a seat sensor that determined Liam not to <br/>
weigh enough.  Cool!!!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still really careful, though, and I still am a safe driver.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452188827">When Chamille seemed big enough and old enough and wanted to ride in <br/>
the front seat, we went through the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think she was about 10 at the time too.  For the first year or so, we <br/>
had her sit in the back if we knew we were going on the freeway, and <br/>
let her sit in the front if we were just putting around town running <br/>
errands and stuff.  I know air bags go off in accidents at slower <br/>
speeds too, but it seems that big big accidents happen on the freeway <br/>
where an airbag would be more likely to deploy.  That was our reasoning <br/>
anyway and she was okay with that arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
She gets car sick if she sits in the back, a lot easier than when she <br/>
sits in the front.  I like having a driving companion too, I don&#39;t feel <br/>
so much like a taxi driver!</div>

way unique in his self-preservation instinct.  I think it&#39;s that he <br/>
knows it&#39;s his choice, he is provided with all the information he <br/>
needs to make a choice, and he cares deeply about his own well being.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that anyone who perceives him- or herself to be respected <br/>
enough to be able to make a choice with the proper information (and <br/>
without manipulation) will opt for the best choice.  Who wouldn&#39;t?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793609423">FWIW, My 11yo dd is as tall as an average adult woman, weighs more than many<br/>
and is strong and muscular.  I have let her sit in the front since she was<br/>
tall enough to sit there with the belt fit properly (not cutting accross the<br/>
neck).  I know many kids older than her who I would not feel comfortable<br/>
putting up front because their body types are  more wirey or bc they are too<br/>
short for the belt.  She has no problems keeping her feet on the floor and<br/>
her but on the seat.  I think she started sitting up front just before her<br/>
10th birthday.  <br/>

<br/>
If Jayn tried to sit in the front seat now she wouldn&#39;t be able to see out <br/>
the window, and the seat belt wouldn&#39;t fit properly and safely. Those are <br/>
the criteria that I will use rather than her age. As someone who also lives <br/>
in vehicle dense Southern California, and having been personally lucky not <br/>
be killed in two serious car accidents, neither of which were my fault or <br/>
remotely predictable, I doubt I will be letting Jayn sit in the front seat <br/>
until she fits the belt and the chair. Just like she will<br/>
stay in her booster seat until she is around 4ft 9inches and the seat belt <br/>
doesn&#39;t visibly cut across her neck without the boost.<br/>
<br/>
There are just too many drunken maniacs on the road in this region (many of <br/>
them idiot celebrities apparently) to do anything to increase the risk of <br/>
injury. Out in the country on a little used road, it might feel safer.<br/>
I like the CDC website for actual fatality and injury statistics.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/childpas.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/childpas.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
When we are going on long road trips, I tend to sit in the back with Jayn a <br/>
lot while dh drives - even though I do get a bit car sick. Chewing gum helps <br/>
a lot with feeling queasy. Also we have a portable dvd player which she <br/>
likes, and we bring along her nintendo ds and drawing materials. We minimize <br/>
the time driving and stop often to look at sights.<br/>

avoidance and for increased floor space for his co-pilot supplies ::g::.<br/>
It&#39;s far safer to have him right next to me than to be constantly asking<br/>
&quot;what?&quot; and turning my head from the road to hear him behind me. We have<br/>
great conversations as we&#39;re side by side, with hands available to one<br/>
another for whatever comfort/assistance is needed.<br/>
Personally, I think the gains outweigh the fears by a long shot.<br/>
If you have a newer car, it may have *smart* airbags that turn off if the<br/>
weight requirement is not met, usually 100 lbs.<br/>
