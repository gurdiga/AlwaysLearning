<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638452117">From an article about Lindsey Lohan going to court on the charge of having stolen a necklace from a store:<br/>
<br/>
The actress is due back before a judge at the end of the week as the case concerning her alleged theft of a Â£1,500 necklace continues.<br/>
<br/>
And her mother DINA believes her daughter may opt to not dispute the charge.<br/>
<br/>
In California a &quot;no contest&quot; plea can be entered as an alternative to guilty or not guilty. It is not an admission of any wrongdoing.<br/>
<br/>
Dina explained: &quot;Obviously she&#39;s not pleading guilty. My children don&#39;t steal things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==========================<br/>
<br/>
I had already set up a post at Just Add Light and Stir, to be mailed automatically tomorrow, because Holly and I are going to Chicago tomorrow, for the InHome Conference in Illinois.   The quote I put up before I found the article above is:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If your child is more important than your vision of your child, life becomes easier.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A mother saying &quot;My children don&#39;t steal things&quot; isn&#39;t very helpful if one of the children has been caught stealing.  <br/>
<br/>
If a mom says &quot;We believe...&quot; or &quot;We love...&quot; something, speaking for her entire family, how free will her children feel to choose otherwise?  And if the mother holds her statement of belief in such high regard that she won&#39;t even look at what her children actually do believe or love, she is not seeing her children directly.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t apply to a three year old boy.  It&#39;s about why it would ever be a problem for one person to speak for a family and to defend that position &quot;la la la la&quot; without considering that children grow older and might not WANT their mother speaking for them.  Or that one person can&#39;t be positive that her hoped-for family belief might not be shared by her husband or by each of her children.<br/>
