<div id="ygrps-yiv-498673395">I started out sending my son to real school where he was made to feel <br/>
like a failure. I was raised in a family where school/grades were <br/>
ridiculously important and was so traumatized i dropped out and ran <br/>
away at 15.<br/>
 <br/>
Up until now i have been raising my children just like my parents <br/>
raised me (without any physical punishment) but with all the <br/>
restrictions and unhappiness. I want a better way. We NEED a better <br/>
way. i am the only advocate for them. But I didnt&#39; always KNOW there <br/>
was a better way, KWIM ?<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted some assistance. Just like all of you i love my kids to <br/>
death, I only want what is best for them. But I am just beginning <br/>
this journey and am learning. Was there never a first day for you <br/>
?<br/>
And maybe, Sandra, you are just very blunt, and that is fine. I <br/>
appreciate that to a degree in that I myself am (obviously) blunt :) <br/>
and it isn&#39;t even PMS week. It just felt bad to hear that maybe my <br/>
child would be better in school so I could have a break when that is <br/>
not what I want...<br/>
<br/>
BUT...I will tell you something. It truly kicked my butt into gear. <br/>
And after stewing for a bit, sought out my son and asked to play a <br/>
game with him. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again...sorry I had to stir the pot...maybe I need a kick in <br/>
the a$$ now and again :)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Sandra.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes when we don&#39;t know what we do want, it helps a lot to discover what <br/>
we DON&#39;T want.<br/>
<br/>
The discussions over the years of what people &quot;have to do&quot; have helped me a <br/>
lot.   Sometimes it&#39;s easy to fall into &quot;I have no choice.&quot;   But there&#39;s <br/>
always an if...then.    I &quot;have&quot; to do this if...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finishing a book.    I&#39;d like to have some ready to sell at the <br/>
conference in early October.   I forced myself to work on it when I really didn&#39;t want <br/>
to, because of the deadline I had imposed on my own self.   I could still <br/>
decide to blow it off.     <br/>
<br/>
I &quot;have to&quot; pack and organize and get some handouts together for the <br/>
conference.   I &quot;have to&quot; get the rounds we&#39;re going to sing on paper.   But I don&#39;t <br/>
have to.   I have choices.   I could go without handouts.   I could go less <br/>
prepared than I&#39;d like to be.    And ultimately, I could blow off the whole thing <br/>
and just decide not to go.   But I would be embarrassed and ashamed of having <br/>
not kept a commitment, and would spend WAY more of my reputation than I&#39;d be <br/>
willing to, and so because I&#39;ve made decisions and priorities, that&#39;s how I <br/>
decide what to do next.<br/>
<br/>
So if a mom&#39;s priority is housework, then children will come second.   If the <br/>
children are the priority, housework comes second.   Most people haven&#39;t <br/>
thought of it that way.   Without thinking of that it might seem that BOTH are <br/>
equally important, but they&#39;re not.    <br/>
<br/>
Every decision is a choice.   If we know what we hope to do, then   we can <br/>
make decisions based on that plan or priority.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sorry Sandra.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fine.   I&#39;m glad you stuck around and looked at some of the links.   I <br/>
don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552604407">Thanks for sharing your full-circle process of thinking Candy. It was really<br/>
nice to see how the words shared on this list made an impact on you.<br/>
<br/>
We all start unschooling in different places. This happens to be a group of<br/>
mostly experienced unschoolers who often get right to the nitty gritty...for<br/>
me this has been a huge gift, even when it was painful. If someone shares<br/>
ideas that are far from unschooling, the unschooling way of being with,<br/>
listening to, admiring, respecting, and completely giving to our children,<br/>
the ideas will be attacked. That is a good thing. It has little or nothing<br/>
to do with the poster...the poster is an adult who hopefully will hear the<br/>
message that will help the child.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for sharing your continued thinking. I bet your son is SO happy<br/>
to be playin&#39; with his momma!<br/>
