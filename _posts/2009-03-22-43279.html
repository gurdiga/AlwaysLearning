I only found out that it was today after watching Rick Steves&#39; trip to  <br/>
Iran, and hearing a young Iranian musician (she lives in Los Angeles)  <br/>
on the radio. Both programs mentioned the New Year&#39;s celebrations in  <br/>
Iran and the expat community.<br/>

Marty works at a Persian restaurant, which is where I got my  <br/>

You can see Obama&#39;s message to the Iranian people and leaders here, <br/>
along with the Colbert Report which is also about it (sort of &lt;G&gt;).<br/>

Spring has sprung for the Western Hemispherians among us, and that means <br/>
this is a time of renewal, growth, fertility and, for most of us it <br/>
means an uplifting of our spirits!  That&#39;s what Naw Ruz is all about!<br/>
