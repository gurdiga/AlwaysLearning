Living Desert, a good place to go if you&#39;re in the Palm Springs, CA area in <br/>
the not-summer.  These folks were training and exhibiting many varieties of <br/>
rats, foxes, lizards, snakes, exotic cats, birds, you name it, and their <br/>
methods were a joy to see.  We sure had fun seeing their animal shows.  They <br/>
all seemed to be having fun, too -- so we asked them about how they trained <br/>
for it.  Moorpark seemed to be the way to go.<br/>
