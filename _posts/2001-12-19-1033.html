 </span></blockquote>George Lucas was the creator of the Star Wars phenomena.  According to<br/>
some things I&#39;ve read George was very influenced by Joseph Campbell&#39;s<br/>
work on comparative mythology and in one of Joseph&#39;s later books, he<br/>
discusses how the Star Wars story has the essential qualities of a<br/>
hero&#39;s journey myth.  When is part 2 coming out???<br/>
