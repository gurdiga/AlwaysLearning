<div id="ygrps-yiv-413513920">-=-2) As I know these are right am I being conceited or as I believe just  <br/>
more aware than those who do not.<br/>
-==-<br/>
 <br/>
You feel those things are right and you feel them deep in your being.<br/>
 <br/>
Is a nun being conceited for believing she knows more about God than  others? <br/>
 She&#39;s married to the guy! &lt;g&gt;  But she knows the God  her church has <br/>
portrayed, and she knows him in her personal way, meaning she  knows the relationship <br/>
with God that she experiences inside her.  She has  worked carefully and <br/>
steadily to perfect her internal image of God.  But  some other Christians would <br/>
say she doesn&#39;t know God at ALL.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m going to quote a 19th century poem that came up elsewhere  <br/>
(unschooling.com a week or so ago), so it&#39;s fresh in my mind:<br/>
 <br/>
It was six men of Indostan  <br/>
To learning much inclined,  <br/>
Who went to see the Elephant  <br/>
(Though all of them were blind),  <br/>
That each by observation  <br/>
Might satisfy his mind <br/>
<br/>
The First approached the Elephant,  <br/>
And happening to fall  <br/>
Against his broad and sturdy side,  <br/>
At once began to bawl:  <br/>
“God bless me! but the Elephant  <br/>
Is very like a wall!” <br/>
<br/>
The Second, feeling of the tusk,  <br/>
Cried, “Ho! what have we here  <br/>
So very round and smooth and sharp?  <br/>
To me ’tis mighty clear  <br/>
This wonder of an Elephant  <br/>
Is very like a spear!” <br/>
<br/>
The Third approached the animal,  <br/>
And happening to take  <br/>
The squirming trunk within his hands,  <br/>
Thus boldly up and spake:  <br/>
“I see,” quoth he, “the Elephant  <br/>
Is very like a snake!” <br/>
<br/>
The Fourth reached out an eager hand,  <br/>
And felt about the knee.  <br/>
“What most this wondrous beast is like  <br/>
Is mighty plain,” quoth he;  <br/>
“ ‘Tis clear enough the Elephant  <br/>
Is very like a tree!” <br/>
<br/>
The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,  <br/>
Said: “E’en the blindest man  <br/>
Can tell what this resembles most;  <br/>
Deny the fact who can  <br/>
This marvel of an Elephant  <br/>
Is very like a fan!” <br/>
<br/>
The Sixth no sooner had begun  <br/>
About the beast to grope,  <br/>
Than, seizing on the swinging tail  <br/>
That fell within his scope,  <br/>
“I see,” quoth he, “the Elephant  <br/>
Is very like a rope!” <br/>
<br/>
And so these men of Indostan  <br/>
Disputed loud and long,  <br/>
Each in his own opinion  <br/>
Exceeding stiff and strong,  <br/>
Though each was partly in the right,  <br/>
And all were in the wrong!  <br/>
<br/>
If you to to google and look for something like &quot;blind men and the  <br/>
elephant,&quot; you&#39;ll also find non-poetic versions, older, from India.  Here&#39;s  that poem, <br/>
though: _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html_">http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html)">http://www.wordfocus.com/word-act-blindmen.html)</a>  <br/>
with some notes.  It was by John Godfrey Saxe, an American. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So there is a really deep KNOWING that feels like religious fervor, and  I&#39;m <br/>
guessing Jay was feeling these truths about children and parents in that  part <br/>
of his being.<br/>
 <br/>
Howard Gardner&#39;s fans and followers have proposed another intelligence that  <br/>
Gardner didn&#39;t name originally: Existential  It would be #9 or 10, I  think.  <br/>
Originally there were 7 and he named nature intelligence as an  addition <br/>
later.  <br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a place in the brain that&#39;s been mapped now that is where religious  <br/>
experience lives.  <br/>

A good article on Andrew Newburg, a radiologist who&#39;s doing research on  <br/>
mediation and prayer and brain response, and also another researcher, Rhawn  <br/>
Joseph, is here:<br/>

 <br/>
Time Magazine did a big cover story a few years back with Andrew Newburg&#39;s  <br/>
early findings, but he&#39;s still working on it and knows more now.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was a Baptist kid there were songs I really loved, and they  could <br/>
evoke a GREAT religious experience in me (though I was sure God was  doing it to <br/>
me, rather than me doing it to me).  They lose some of the  power without the <br/>
music, the organ vibrating the pews, the others singing in  harmony...   but a <br/>
good sample of lyrics is here:<br/>
 <br/>
I serve a living Saviour, He&#39;s in the world today;<br/>
I know that He is living, whatever men may say;<br/>
I feel His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer,<br/>
And just the time I need him, He&#39;s always near.<br/>
 <br/>
He lives!  He lives! Christ Jesus lives today;<br/>
He walks with me and talks with me along life&#39;s narrow way;<br/>
He lives! He lives, salvation to impart;<br/>
You ask me how I know he lives, he lives within my heart.<br/>
 <br/>
[words by memory, and I might have misremembered a phrase, but will correct  <br/>
later if necessary]<br/>
 <br/>
I knew there was a God.  I knew it from the depths of my being.<br/>
God loomed large in my life for many years.<br/>
 <br/>
Now I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a God (or if there is that&#39;s fine,  but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t concern me directly anymore), but I DO believe almost everything else on  <br/>
your list about how children&#39;s early years can help keep them strong  and whole <br/>
and aware and so forth.  Is that as fragile a belief as  others?  Maybe so!  <br/>
 <br/>
The Pope acted on his beliefs and had a BIG damned funeral.  Lots of  people <br/>
agreed with him.  Do numbers create truth?  Is there a God and  is he Catholic <br/>
because that was one of the biggest crowds ever gathered on one  place?  Was <br/>
God Hindu when so many people gathered for Mahatma Ghandi&#39;s  funeral?  In each <br/>
case, the deceased had affected lives and  government policies.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The fervent beliefs of radical unschoolers changes the lives of other  people <br/>
who were already inclined to want to move toward mindful parenting and  <br/>
living compassionately with their own children.  There aren&#39;t too many of  us.  Not <br/>
a billion, certainly.  Maybe not many thousands.  Still,  if the beliefs and <br/>
practices are workable and not harmful and we see good  results, that enforces <br/>
our ideas and beliefs and some develop deep  convictions.<br/>
 <br/>
Deep convictions can change, and they can be hard to live  by/with/through.<br/>
