<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342613656">Hi Joanne,<br/>
<br/>
You post that you don&#39;t necessarily play directly with your children very<br/>
often.  I am often the same.  I think a lot of it has to do with the ages of<br/>
your kids and how many you have.  When we only had Adriane, I played with<br/>
her for hours and hours every day (of course, I also tended to treat her<br/>
like a trained seal, showing off her little tricks).  With Zach, I played<br/>
imaginary baseball (no real ball so nobody has to shag) daily.<br/>
<br/>
Now with the 3 additional little guys, I am more of the janitor/resource<br/>
person.  I am usually busy cleaning up from lunch, finding lost Barbie<br/>
shoes, wiping up spilled milk, changing diapers, chasing rogue dogs, etc..<br/>
I am available on the fly for questions, short play periods, newest jokes,<br/>
mediation, etc..  The kids know that whatever I&#39;m doing comes to a<br/>
screeching halt if they really need me for something, but mostly they are in<br/>
charge with the older ones often leading the younger ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963494384">Thanks Julie.<br/>
I think you are right about the age and # of kids.  I feel like I&#39;m <br/>
doing a lot for/with them all day long, and at the same time getting <br/>
absolutely nothing done!  <br/>
Well, we&#39;re leaving for an 8 day stay at my parents house in FL next <br/>
week, and my parents are going to be in Hawaii!(we&#39;re house sitting).<br/>
That is going to be sooo cool.  They are very close to a science <br/>
museum and zoo, and there is a playmobile store where kids can play <br/>
with all the stuff in a big room, there are fountains that kids can <br/>
run through, right next to the huge public library, the beach and the <br/>
pool in my parents backyard.<br/>
My dh isn&#39;t going, and I&#39;m really looking forward to just hanging out <br/>
with the kids.<br/>
