I signed Lisa up for Sunshine Generation when we first moved here and she<br/>
was 4, bc she loved to sing.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the nature of the<br/>
program or the woman running it, but it was terrible!  She made a big<br/>
deal out of kids following her every order and if a kid didn&#39;t they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t get a sticker at the end and &quot;don&#39;t you want to get a sticker bc<br/>
everyone else is going to, but you won&#39;t if you don&#39;t stand on that<br/>
spot&quot;.  When we quit after a few sessions, dh had a problem bc he was<br/>
worried that she would become a quitter if not made to &quot;finish things&quot;. <br/>
Also, she was (and still is) my Velcro kid.  We tried a few other classes<br/>
(gym, etc) and I would literally have to peel her off my leg to go into<br/>
the &quot;mom&#39;s waiting area&quot;, before it occurred to me that she wasn&#39;t ready<br/>
for such activities and stopped signing her up.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this was all before I was unschooling or even homeschooling. <br/>
Lisa still loves to sing and dreams of being a performer (Britney Spears<br/>
is her current idol and she is on pins and needles for her movie to open<br/>
next week).  So we just sing.  It&#39;s normal in our house to push the<br/>
replay button and play the same song over and over.  The girls use<br/>
various kitchen utensils as &quot;microphones&quot;.  I would LOVE to have a karoke<br/>
machine!  We sing along in the car.  We have several of the Wee Sing<br/>
cassettes and song books and they like those.  We borrow music CD&#39;s from<br/>
the library.  We also love a lot of sound tracks from movies to listen<br/>
and sing along too.  When listening to the radio I will talk about the<br/>
artists and things I know about them.  We have a small collection of<br/>
musical instruments including a drum, piano, lap harp, banjos, and<br/>
recorders.  This all helps to fulfill Washington State&#39;s homeschool<br/>
requirement of &quot;development of an appreciation for art and music&quot;, by the<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
If you do want to try a music class for her, I would suggest Linnea<br/>
Hiljestrand&#39;s music classes.  She is very gentle and just loves music<br/>
herself and loves bringing it to little children.  There is lots of<br/>
moving around in the class.  But I would not say that a class is<br/>
necessary by a certain age.  I think if children are allowed and<br/>
encouraged to express themselves musically and truly do have a talent,<br/>
that classes will be more beneficial when they are ready to commit to<br/>
serious practice and direction, when they recognize themselves that they<br/>
can utilize professional help to improve their skills.<br/>
