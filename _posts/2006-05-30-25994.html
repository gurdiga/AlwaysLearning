Very international.  American psychologist speaking in Australia  <br/>
giving British examples:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Professor Garbarino told a parenting conference this week in  <br/>
Adelaide that research dating back 40 years had proved a link between  <br/>
child exposure to TV violence and increased physical aggression. But  <br/>
while girls were initially found to be &quot;immune&quot; to the &quot;contagious&quot;  <br/>
effect of TV violence, researchers had seen a significant shift since  <br/>
the 1980s. &quot;That immunity had disappeared,&quot; he said.&quot;<br/>

40 years.  HMMMMM.... What else has happened in the past 40 years?   <br/>
Compulsory education, up to the late teens.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s being looked at by ANYone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago on the local news here (Albuquerque), a spokesman for  <br/>
the Albuquerque Public schools was saying yes, there was a lot of  <br/>
graffiti at the schools lately, but there was also more in the city  <br/>
itself, and teens were emulating the adult behavior they saw outside  <br/>
of school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHAT!?  #1, who says the graffiti in the public non-school places  <br/>
wasn&#39;t also done by kids?  And if those kids had real jobs instead of  <br/>
being made to do homework and go to sleep early so they could go to  <br/>
school by government edict again in the morning, they might be too  <br/>
busy or satisfied to want to steal spray paint and mess something up.<br/>
