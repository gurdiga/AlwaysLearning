So, how do the rest of you deal with state requirements? Do you try to find<br/>
an evaluator who will be open to unschooling (and how do you do that), or do<br/>
you find an umbrella school that will let your kids learn without requiring<br/>
tests or evaluations and only require what they have to? I guess I am just<br/>
wondering how the rest of you handle this obstacle to their freedom.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What state? And you could also post this question (or search the archives)<br/>
on your state at the message boards at www.unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are unschoolers in every state, so there are ways to do these<br/>
things. I also know that if I lived in a state that was particularly<br/>
annoying (and the way California is about legislation-in-general, someday I<br/>
might be!) I&#39;d move if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is our main priority in life while our kids are of compulsory<br/>
attendance age -- everything else has to &quot;fit in&quot; with it, and Wally and I<br/>
will do anything to preserve it for them, including changing states,<br/>
careers, whatever it takes.<br/>
<br/>
So that might be a fun topic here, too: how far would YOU go to unschool? Is<br/>
there anywhere you&#39;d draw the line and just say, &quot;Okay, I give, it&#39;s not<br/>
worth THAT&quot;?<br/>

But first I&#39;d do everything in my power to get around any <br/>
legislation that made it difficult.  And of course, there&#39;s always <br/>
faking it (as in do the kids work and hand it in if necessary) &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
