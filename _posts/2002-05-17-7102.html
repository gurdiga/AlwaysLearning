<div id="ygrps-yiv-721448641">Wow, Deb!! <br/>
Thanks for all the fantastic ideas. I never even thought of the consulate!  <br/>
He&#39;d be so thrilled to get mail.<br/>
He&#39;s only 8, so unlikely to get employed anywhere...but we do take him to <br/>
Chinese restaurants when budget allows. In fact, my oldest ds eats with <br/>
chopsticks now. He figured it out the first time he tried, I just showed him <br/>
how to hold them and VOILA!<br/>
I was impressed and he pointed out that gamers have good hand-eye <br/>
coordination.<br/>
Aha!  Now I have another plus for letting your kids play endless hours of <br/>
Zelda.....<br/>
There is a little Chinese shop they love at the mall.<br/>
They befriended a little boy whose parents own it and now we have to stop by <br/>
there every time we go to the mall.<br/>
I just need more stuff here at home for him to dabble with.<br/>
I think I&#39;ll find a consulate nearby...maybe Atlanta.<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

for my husband&#39;s Social Studies classes, I discovered that for some<br/>
reason they are split into two separate Dewey decimal groupings.  I<br/>
guess one is for Ancient China and another for really, really Ancient<br/>
China.  Sooooo, if you think you&#39;ve seen all the books your library has<br/>
to offer about China, look again!  They might be hiding some just to<br/>
mystify you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900547871">We&#39;ve really used the Consulate lending library a lot.  Sometimes the<br/>
videos aren&#39;t as good as they sound in the description, or sometimes the<br/>
books aren&#39;t what we expected, but for the most part we&#39;ve had good luck<br/>
and great fun.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You must have a pretty good library!! I think our<br/>
branch only has whole numbers :-) and Magic School Bus<br/>
fills up one third of the science shelf (singular).<br/>
But it is WAY better than nothing!! <br/>

<br/>
My guess (without checking the dewey details) is one was for recorded history <br/>
and one was for archeological.<br/>
