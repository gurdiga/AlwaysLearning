<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710925088">My Mother is a very devout Christian who has been so willing to learn about how we are raising our children. She cares for my daughters every Friday, and I know this is the biggest challenge of her week. She is going very much outside her comfort zone (previous authoritative, disciplinarian methods of child-rearing) to learn about unschooling and responding without punishing. But she is doing so graciously and respectfully, and I absolutely feel thankful for her willingness to do so and for her desire to help me by being with my girls one day a week while we work. She thoroughly supports our unschooling choice, and that alone is priceless.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are non-religious, and we do not often discuss religious ideas or principals in our house. My Mother asked me years ago if it was okay for her to give them books, music, or DVDs of Christian perspective, and I said it was fine. I have not wanted to offend her desire to sing songs with them, read to them, etc. and up until now, they never had issue with it. I was raised by her, and so I have a pretty good idea of how she interacts with them with regards to reading, singing, and the sort. Mostly she just plays with my girls--they play games, they run around, they sing songs, they go to the park, they go out to eat. She&#39;s not doing Bible study, or Sunday-school type stuff at all, mostly singing Christian songs and listening to CDs in the car.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently, Nena (age 8) told me that she was tired of listening to the few bible song CDs my Mom plays while they are driving. I suggested she ask her Grandma if she would be willing to play some of the other CDs that Nena enjoys, and so she did, and Grandma was okay with it. <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, my husband is a professional drummer and plays in a variety of bands and genres, but most recently was playing in a death metal band. My kids love the music, and actually wrote their own lyrics to the death metal music, and created their own dance routines, which were really good. My husband listens to a lot of different kinds of music, including death metal, punk rock, thrash, and many other genres, some of which has lyrics that I am certain my daughters have picked out, such as Slayer&#39;s &quot;God hates us all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when Nena told her Dad about telling Grandma that she wanted to listen more to her music and not the Bible music, my husband made some comments about God and not really believing in religion, etc. They weren&#39;t particularly striking to me, but apparently they were to Signe, who is 4.  The next time Signe saw Grandma, and Grandma asked if they wanted to listen to the Bible songs, Signe said, &quot;You know, God isn&#39;t real.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My Mom confronted me about it, and told me that while it&#39;s none of her business how we choose to raise our kids, that if I am going to teach my children about God, I better start doing it now because they are obviously being influenced somewhere about it, and not in a good way.<br/>
<br/>
I respectfully side-stepped the conversation, and forgot about it until today. She had watched my girls Friday, and apparently they had made several comments to her about God and other controversial topics such as ghosts, witches, and Halloween. My Mom was notably upset, and took several days to mull it over before bringing it up with me today.<br/>
<br/>
So...basically, I would like to bring up the subject with my girls on how we can be kind and respectful to Grandma about her beliefs, but I would like to do so in a way that discourages them from further upsetting their Grandma. With Signe, almost any discussion of something I don&#39;t want her to do will lead to her doing it more, which may be a developmental stage, but I&#39;ve noticed it quite a bit in the past couple months. With Nena, the actual discussion of a controversial topic will cause her to dismiss it and not want to discuss it at all.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how I can approach this subject/concept with my two girls? I&#39;m feeling like I need some help with this one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

My first thought is, it shouldn&#39;t be up to your girls to carry the burden of not upsetting Grandma, especially if you can&#39;t be with them when they&#39;re together.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you want them to pretend to believe in God when they&#39;re with Grandma, even though that might not be true. Is that right?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re raising the girls more eclectically in the religious department, YOU will need to be honest with your mom about that. Apparently, it will upset her. That&#39;s for you two (or 3, including your husband?) to work out, not for your girls to take on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounded super super sweet to me - that you want the girls to be kind <br/>
to their grandmother. It sounds to me like she&#39;s been more flexible than <br/>
you even expected and that&#39;s nice!! I don&#39;t see any reason that the <br/>
girls need to antagonize her and it doesn&#39;t sound like she&#39;s wanting to <br/>
antagonize you or them, either. The problem is they are really quite <br/>
young and it is probably too much to expect them to have the ability to <br/>
discern what would be rude to say to her. Maybe the 8 year old could <br/>
understand &quot;That&#39;s the way grandma is and we don&#39;t always agree, but we <br/>
love her and so we don&#39;t want to argue with her about it.&quot; I don&#39;t think <br/>
a four year old could get that at all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It didn&#39;t sound like that to me. It sounded like  Grandma would play <br/>
music and tell stories - it never sounded like Grandma was insisting <br/>
that they claim to believe in anything in particular. My kids (we are <br/>
not Christians) happily hung out with all our Christian relatives and <br/>
all of the cousins are super close now that they are all young adults. <br/>
They never felt that they needed to make any kind of point about what <br/>
they believed or didn&#39;t believe. They happily went along to some church <br/>
functions and they didn&#39;t find many occasions to make a point of not <br/>
being Christians. The family knew it. Sometimes a relative would say <br/>
grace before a meal and we&#39;d all hold hands - my kids just graciously <br/>
went along.  Once one of my kids was asked to say grace and she <br/>
hesitated, then said a very nice little &quot;Thank you for all the good <br/>
things in our lives.&quot;  Left God and Jesus out of it - but nobody seemed <br/>
to notice &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
When our kids are in other people&#39;s houses, even our own parents, or <br/>
when other people are doing a favor and being sweet and kind to help us <br/>
out, I don&#39;t think kids should be encouraged to belligerently contradict <br/>
them, but to be tolerant and patient, instead.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounded like she&#39;d already been honest and grandma had, respectfully, <br/>
asked if it was okay to play Christian music and tell Christian stories <br/>
and she&#39;d said yes.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation is to tell Grandma how much you appreciate her for <br/>
being so respectful and that you realize it is hard, given her beliefs. <br/>
Tell her you don&#39;t mind the girls being exposed to her beliefs at all, <br/>
as long as she doesn&#39;t try to force them, as you know she won&#39;t. Tell <br/>
her that the girls are going to be exposed to a lot of different ideas <br/>
and she should not get upset when she hears all kinds of ideas from <br/>
them, that they will try out all kinds of things and, when they&#39;re <br/>
older, they&#39;ll make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
She probably is thinking, &quot;Oh no - it is time, if they don&#39;t get the <br/>
christianity now, they might be lost forever.&quot; Reassure her that you&#39;re <br/>
going to encourage them to think for themselves and that includes <br/>
learning about Christianity along with other points of view.<br/>
<br/>
Remind her, maybe, that if they are brainwashed at a young age, they <br/>
can&#39;t really choose for themselves when they are older. (Or maybe don&#39;t <br/>
use &quot;brainwashed,&quot; but a nicer term that she&#39;ll understand.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to take my kids to church with her - I thought that was <br/>
fine. My kids were not sitting there saying, &quot;But I don&#39;t believe this.&quot; <br/>
They were politely being quiet, enjoying the music, listening <br/>
(critically) to the sermon, etc. There was often a lot of gist for <br/>
conversation later, but they didn&#39;t impose it on Grandma, they just <br/>
hugged her and said they loved her. They didn&#39;t pretend to believe <br/>
anything, they were just polite about not arguing with her beliefs.  Not <br/>
hard to be that way as long as SHE wasn&#39;t demanding that they agree with <br/>
her.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not true, in my experience.   I had an uncle who went so  <br/>
totally &quot;new age&quot; that his daughters would have nothing to do with  <br/>
him.  He had been a Baptist preacher when they were kids.  My  <br/>
grandmother, whose large family was filled with ministers, was proud  <br/>
of him for having graduated from Hardin Simmons, a Baptist college  <br/>
where I had planned to apply myself; my pool was St. John&#39;s, Hardin- <br/>
Simmons or UNM.<br/>
<br/>
I know many former fundamentalists and Roman Catholics who grew up  <br/>
&quot;brainwashed&quot; and forced to attend, comply, and conform.  Some of them  <br/>
just relax into the church for life.  Others do a 180 degree turnabout  <br/>
and walk as far away from it as they can.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that&#39;s not the choice Pam meant by &quot;can&#39;t really choose,&quot; but  <br/>
it IS a choice.   If children are familiar with several options and  <br/>
beliefs, though, they can make an informed decision, rather than a  <br/>
reactionary one.<br/>
<br/>
If a four year old can&#39;t be coached to be courteous, maybe she  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be alone with the grandmother.   Maybe you could just say  <br/>
&quot;Grandma loves Jesus so don&#39;t say anything bad about Jesus.&quot;  My kids  <br/>
were aware of those things in terms of favorite TV shows or toys.   <br/>
Barbies or Ninja Turtles or Pokemon.  They knew not to razz or shame  <br/>
another person for an interest.  Maybe if it&#39;s treated as a &quot;favorite  <br/>
thing&quot; or an attachment, rather than a cosmic, historical, socio- <br/>
political thing, it will be easier to talk with the kid about it.<br/>

is to get &#39;em while they&#39;re young. So my point was that she could be <br/>
told that if she succeeded, they couldn&#39;t choose later, as adults. Not <br/>
much of an argument - - but maybe worth a mention because it might make <br/>
Grandma feel better and maybe even be more relaxed.<br/>

I understand what you are saying, but my intent is not to burden my children with the task of not upsetting Grandma, but more about understanding that those one or two things they&#39;ve said about God really cause her turmoil, and because we love Grandma, it would be nice if they didn&#39;t say those one or two things. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is very much how I&#39;ve been feeling. I realize that my 4yr old is trying things out and getting a shock value in return, which may be encouraging to her to try it more. It may take more skill on my part to help her to understand why I want her to not make these statements about God to her. <br/>
<br/>
Last night before we fell asleep, I asked Nena if I could talk to her about Grandma and about her feelings for God and Jesus, and Nena listened to me calmly and even asked a few questions about it. This morning, she told me how much she loves her Grandma and wants her to feel safe.  I thought that was really, really cool. Perhaps I&#39;ll bring it up again on occasion, to remind her of my feelings about how much we appreciate my Mom&#39;s support.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;My recommendation is to tell Grandma how much you appreciate her for being so respectful and that you realize it is hard, given her beliefs.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is good.  My Mom&#39;s beliefs are deeply rooted, and she also appreciates that I understand her so well because neither my brother nor my father believe as she does, and I&#39;ve always been her kind-hearted and understanding listener in the family. She also knows that my husband&#39;s family is pretty brash, vocal, and liberal.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a helpful way of saying it. I&#39;ve often been at a loss of how to approach it, and I often side-step the conversation by just nodding in agreement to what she is saying and then changing the subject. She has never pressed any of the religious principals she feels strongly about on us, until that one conversation I mentioned.  She is also convinced that the predictions of the Book of Revelations are starting to occur, and believes so strongly that my children must be saved in order to go to Heaven.  While I do not agree with her perspective on this, I feel strongly about not being rude and not setting up an environment here where she feels terribly conflicted.  <br/>

with her perspective on this, I feel strongly about not being rude and  <br/>
not setting up an environment here where she feels terribly  <br/>
conflicted. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Would she feel better if the girls were baptized?  (Assuming they  <br/>
aren&#39;t yet.)<br/>
<br/>
I figure baptism is just water, for non-believers.  But if it makes  <br/>
their grandmother sleep better and look forward to being with her  <br/>
granddaughters in heaven, maybe it&#39;s worth doing that for her.<br/>

In a kind, gentle way, I think you should explain to your mum how you plan to approach the topic of religion with your children. In your desire not to offend, you have inadvertently allowed a confusing situation for your kids to arise because they are hearing conflicting views at home and at Grandma&#39;s. I think the onus is on your mum to not promote her religious beliefs, just as it is on you to respect her right to those beliefs and encourage your kids to be respectful also. This will be made a lot easier for your kids if Grandma does not bring religion into their time together.<br/>

Religious people don&#39;t think of it as having &quot;religious beliefs,&quot;  <br/>
generally speaking.  Not Christians, anyway.  They see it as knowing  <br/>
the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Atheists do that too.  I really do NOT like it when Christians say  <br/>
that atheism is just another religion, and that science is just  <br/>
another religion where people have faith in science.  So it&#39;s a  <br/>
problem when some atheists do seem to treat it as a religion.<br/>

after I had my child is that I wouldn&#39;t try to limit him from deciding<br/>

landscape right now. We&#39;re making an impression on him as it is. And<br/>
even though any contact with my family means contact with their<br/>

While I understand that she has an ulterior motive, I have no real need to crush my Mother&#39;s hope that they will become born-again, and go to heaven. She truly enjoys and adores her grandkids. She has gone WAY beyond what I had ever expected in trying to understand and follow our lifestyle while she is with them. Her help is necessary because I have to work. Her time with my kids is free. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But my Mom&#39;s beliefs are everything that she is...it is her all. Because of my love and appreciation for her, I cannot ask her to leave her religion at the door. It isn&#39;t possible. She is on the more delicate and sensitive side of the personality spectrum, and I truly do respect her beliefs. My motivation to not offend her does not stem from a need to tell my Mom what I believe, and that I don&#39;t want her to interfere...I could do that, but to me that would be disrespectful.</div>

In the same way that I don&#39;t force them to be vegetarians even though I am, I wouldn&#39;t want them to be presented with stories/songs as though these things were the truth. I don&#39;t present atheism as &#39;the truth&#39; either, rather the whole field of religious belief or lack thereof is one we just haven&#39;t visited yet. Later, when they are better equipped to make up their own minds, I have absolutely no problem in facilitating their access to whatever religious material they are interested in. No problem. But to me this is a long way down the track. For now, I create an environment for my kids in which no one philosophical system is held to be the absolute truth, in fact an environment in which the whole idea of &#39;philosophical systems&#39; doesn&#39;t come up. Rather, we have lots of stories, lots of imaginitive play, lots of fun.<br/>

So, how do you want to approach the whole idea of religion with your kids? :) No need to answer here, but you need to know in your own mind before you can then work out how to balance this with respect for your mum&#39;s beliefs. For me, for my own kids, the balance will always tip in favour of protecting my kids&#39; ability to make independent choices about what to believe or not believe.<br/>

It&#39;s my opinion that religious ideas should not be presented as truth to kids who are too young to make up their own minds. The original poster did seem quite relaxed about her mum incorporating Christian songs and stories into her time with her grandkids, but then found herself in an awkward position when the kids reacted against Grandma&#39;s beliefs with ideas from their own, non-religious home. I just wanted to put forward that because my home is also non-religious, I wouldn&#39;t like others attempting to influence my kids towards a particular belief system.<br/>

friends. They went to church and found it sometimes interesting, mostly <br/>
boring. Roya even when to Vacation Bible School with her cousin one year.<br/>
<br/>
The beliefs they were presented with ARE the norm, as compared to my <br/>
beliefs, for example. I think it is really easy to say, &quot;Oh, well, <br/>
that&#39;s what Grandma believes,&quot; and move on.  I used to sing Christian <br/>
songs with my kids, sometimes, songs I&#39;d learned in Sunday School. <br/>
&quot;Jesus loves the little children,&quot; or &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful.&quot; <br/>
A couple of hymns I remembered. It didn&#39;t turn them into Christians <br/>
anymore than singing old southern Civil War songs turned them pro-slavery.<br/>
<br/>
Some people seem afraid of their kids being exposed to religious ideas. <br/>
The only thing I asked of my kids was not to fill out the visitor cards <br/>
if they went to church with someone. My mom&#39;s church would send someone <br/>
to leave a loaf of nice bread at the home of anybody filling out a <br/>
visitor&#39;s card. Once was fine - but after that it was not cool.<br/>

overwhelm their own.  And your fearful protective reactions are just  <br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are awash in ideas and your fear radar goes up at certain  <br/>
ideas, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll catch that and pay more attention to those  <br/>
ideas!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s likely your kids will try on many ideas that you don&#39;t agree  <br/>
with. It&#39;s part of figuring out the world. But if you react negatively  <br/>
to those ideas it&#39;s less likely they&#39;ll come to you to bounce ideas  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30643446">If only the OP&#39;s mother could show the same equanimity towards non-belief as is being advocated here for religious beliefs! I very much understand and appreciate the comments about not being fearful of kids coming across religious ideas. I hold my kids, and the unschooling principles that guide our lives, far dearer than atheism or any other &#39;ism&#39;. I have no fear that religious ideas will somehow corrupt them. Our relationship comes first, and the world is big and swirling with lots of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
However, the whole situation in the original post arose, in my opinion, because the OP&#39;s mother is actively promoting her personal convictions to her grandkids. What if every Friday Grandma made comments about how wonderful school is and how you must go to school to get anywhere in life? It may not make the kids want to go to school, but it creates unnecessary confusion and conflict. I don&#39;t know what the solution to the OP&#39;s situation is, because she said that her mum couldn&#39;t leave religion out of her time with her grangkids, but if it was me, I&#39;d be asking my mum, in as gentle a way as I could, to just have fun and play and not bring religion into it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And something to ponder further, considering ages of 8 and 4, do kids take things they hear in books about Noah&#39;s ark vs. books where a bear comes over to play as &quot;truth&quot;? as in a truth they will follow for years to come? <br/>
<br/>
In the example that I&#39;ve provided, I said that my Mom is not sitting them down, reading the Bible to them, and then saying that this is the way things are--the Truth--as Claire seems to be implying.  And I&#39;m not sitting them down and saying that we think there is no God, and therefore what we say is the Truth. Obviously they are being peppered with statements and opinions from my mom and us, but I don&#39;t know why they would take any of those things to be some truth about life in general.<br/>
<br/>
As Meredith says, it&#39;s much more nuanced. Why would my 8 year old or my 4 year old think that the story of Noah&#39;s Ark is in any way different than the story of &quot;The Bear Came Over to My House&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
However, I what I just discovered, and which makes the nuances even more interesting to me is that my Mom began complaining that she couldn&#39;t find her cell phone and was starting to fret about it, so in what can only be described as a habitual thing, my Mom said, &quot;I believe I&#39;ll find my phone, in Jesus&#39; name.&quot; It was not said to my daughters, it was said to herself, to Jesus. In that context, and in a non-vindictive way, my 8-year old tells her &quot;Jesus is dead and he can&#39;t help you.&quot;  This is what had my Mom so upset all weekend long. She was startled to hear this out of an innocent 8-year old&#39;s mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, it illustrates what I see as a pretty good awareness on the part of Nena, who must have heard other statements from my Mom like &quot;Jesus died for our sins,&quot; which she often says in a prayer she repeats while driving.  And dead people generally don&#39;t provide much physical help when looking for a lost cell phone.</div>

<br/>
Are you really not understanding that for Christians they&#39;re not just  <br/>
two equal items on the buffet of life?<br/>
<br/>
If you really do believe that religion is bogus, then how could it  <br/>
hurt your children to hear Bible stories or whatever?  Christians  <br/>
CANNOT show &quot;equanimity towards non-belief.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not advocating for equanimity toward religious beliefs.  We&#39;re  <br/>
advocating &quot;chill.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re misunderstanding the original post, too, or  <br/>
misinterpreting it.  The problem wasn&#39;t the religious content, it was  <br/>
a child insulting the grandmother without knowing she had.<br/>

<br/>
You might want to reread the original post without the filtering  <br/>
glasses and think about how you got the above from what was written  <br/>
below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My Mother is a very devout Christian who has been so willing to  <br/>
&gt; learn about how we are raising our children. She cares for my  <br/>
&gt; daughters every Friday, and I know this is the biggest challenge of  <br/>
&gt; her week. She is going very much outside her comfort zone (previous  <br/>
&gt; authoritative, disciplinarian methods of child-rearing) to learn  <br/>
&gt; about unschooling and responding without punishing. But she is doing  <br/>
&gt; so graciously and respectfully, and I absolutely feel thankful for  <br/>
&gt; her willingness to do so and for her desire to help me by being with  <br/>
&gt; my girls one day a week while we work. She thoroughly supports our  <br/>
&gt; unschooling choice, and that alone is priceless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband and I are non-religious, and we do not often discuss  <br/>
&gt; religious ideas or principals in our house. My Mother asked me years  <br/>
&gt; ago if it was okay for her to give them books, music, or DVDs of  <br/>
&gt; Christian perspective, and I said it was fine. I have not wanted to  <br/>
&gt; offend her desire to sing songs with them, read to them, etc. and up  <br/>
&gt; until now, they never had issue with it. I was raised by her, and so  <br/>
&gt; I have a pretty good idea of how she interacts with them with  <br/>
&gt; regards to reading, singing, and the sort. Mostly she just plays  <br/>
&gt; with my girls--they play games, they run around, they sing songs,  <br/>
&gt; they go to the park, they go out to eat. She&#39;s not doing Bible  <br/>
&gt; study, or Sunday-school type stuff at all, mostly singing Christian  <br/>
&gt; songs and listening to CDs in the car.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recently, Nena (age 8) told me that she was tired of listening to  <br/>
&gt; the few bible song CDs my Mom plays while they are driving. I  <br/>
&gt; suggested she ask her Grandma if she would be willing to play some  <br/>
&gt; of the other CDs that Nena enjoys, and so she did, and Grandma was  <br/>
&gt; okay with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As an aside, my husband is a professional drummer and plays in a  <br/>
&gt; variety of bands and genres, but most recently was playing in a  <br/>
&gt; death metal band. My kids love the music, and actually wrote their  <br/>
&gt; own lyrics to the death metal music, and created their own dance  <br/>
&gt; routines, which were really good. My husband listens to a lot of  <br/>
&gt; different kinds of music, including death metal, punk rock, thrash,  <br/>
&gt; and many other genres, some of which has lyrics that I am certain my  <br/>
&gt; daughters have picked out, such as Slayer&#39;s &quot;God hates us all.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, when Nena told her Dad about telling Grandma that she wanted  <br/>
&gt; to listen more to her music and not the Bible music, my husband made  <br/>
&gt; some comments about God and not really believing in religion, etc.  <br/>
&gt; They weren&#39;t particularly striking to me, but apparently they were  <br/>
&gt; to Signe, who is 4. The next time Signe saw Grandma, and Grandma  <br/>
&gt; asked if they wanted to listen to the Bible songs, Signe said, &quot;You  <br/>
&gt; know, God isn&#39;t real.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Mom confronted me about it, and told me that while it&#39;s none of  <br/>
&gt; her business how we choose to raise our kids, that if I am going to  <br/>
&gt; teach my children about God, I better start doing it now because  <br/>
&gt; they are obviously being influenced somewhere about it, and not in a  <br/>
&gt; good way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I respectfully side-stepped the conversation, and forgot about it  <br/>
&gt; until today. She had watched my girls Friday, and apparently they  <br/>
&gt; had made several comments to her about God and other controversial  <br/>
&gt; topics such as ghosts, witches, and Halloween. My Mom was notably  <br/>
&gt; upset, and took several days to mull it over before bringing it up  <br/>
&gt; with me today.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So...basically, I would like to bring up the subject with my girls  <br/>
&gt; on how we can be kind and respectful to Grandma about her beliefs,  <br/>
&gt; but I would like to do so in a way that discourages them from  <br/>
&gt; further upsetting their Grandma. With Signe, almost any discussion  <br/>
&gt; of something I don&#39;t want her to do will lead to her doing it more,  <br/>
&gt; which may be a developmental stage, but I&#39;ve noticed it quite a bit  <br/>
&gt; in the past couple months. With Nena, the actual discussion of a  <br/>
&gt; controversial topic will cause her to dismiss it and not want to  <br/>
&gt; discuss it at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas on how I can approach this subject/concept with my two  <br/>
&gt; girls? I&#39;m feeling like I need some help with this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br/>
&gt; Kristi<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t agree.  My own parents are very very religious.  I cannot imagine asking <br/>
them to keep it to themselves while the grandkids are around.  It is so much <br/>
apart of who they are as people.  Plus I&#39;m not afraid of religious beliefs.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s good to know about the beliefs of others, especially their <br/>
grandparents or other relatives with whom they love and respect. <br/>
<br/>
My kids have received all kinds of religious gifts from relatives.  Some they <br/>
liked more than others.  One of their most favorite books were very tiny little <br/>
books that had thankful prayers in them.  Both of my kids loved those little <br/>
books.  Neither are fans of religious jewelry, but both have received such items <br/>
and they put them in jewelry boxes where they have remained.<br/>

What about such bands as Flyleaf?  Flyleaf is a wonderful band!  There are <br/>
plenty of Christian bands that are actually very good, not like the contemporary <br/>
stuff that was around when I was a kid.  Grandma may not like the music itself, <br/>
but she might like the fact that the lyrics are Christian based.  She may be <br/>
open to exploring it with her grandkids.<br/>

<br/>
Spoken by a true atheist ;)<br/>
<br/>
The thing about that, is that people who are very religious incorporate it into <br/>
every aspect of their lives, it is a part of that person.  It would be <br/>
impossible to separate religion from daily interactions of any kind, for someone <br/>
like this grandma.  My guess is that she probably has many CD&#39;s of religious <br/>
music and maybe a handful of secular, probably has several versions of the bible <br/>
sitting about in her house, crosses as decorations, and religious sayings on <br/>
refrigerator magnets.  Probably, most of her children&#39;s books are religious and <br/>
she might even own all the Veggie Tales productions.<br/>

One day, if one of those grandkids ever does become a Christian, they&#39;ll have a <br/>
good companion!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I consider my devoutly Christian grandmother to have been one of my<br/>
very best friends ever, even though I no longer consider myself part<br/>
of the Christian faith. She was just that sweet and nonjudgmental of<br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
A personal aside: Today it occurred to me that had my folks avoided<br/>
anxiously asking me over and over again if I was saved or not, I<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t have questioned it. I would have simply assumed I am<br/>
a Christian and not investigated the idea. But since it was put to me<br/>
so often I began to take the question seriously and eventually delved<br/>
into the matter to find out.<br/>
<br/>
How ironic the impetus for my clarity is for my parents ... I won&#39;t<br/>
mention it to them.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing can happen with kids who are expected to be atheists<br/>
and not stray into religious thinking patterns lest they lose their<br/>
atheist label. I grew up with some of them.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom of choice and diversity is a good thing imo. It&#39;s one of the<br/>
reasons I chose to try out the Unitarian Universalist church, which is<br/>
mostly secular humanist with a good smattering of Christian<br/>
Universalists to boot in my region. ;) It&#39;s a very apt cultural mix in<br/>
these parts.<br/>
