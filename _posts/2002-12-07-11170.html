<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098917283">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the comments. Tim, dh, feels very much the same as Sandra and<br/>
Heidi. Riley gets to throw a fit each year and we get over it. It is so<br/>
terribly sad to see 1 kid of the gang of 5 who hang out together get left<br/>
behind. Kindness is something we continuely practice. The past three years the<br/>
mom has had a clear cut, girls only. We respected this, let her know how sad<br/>
Riley is to not be able to share in the festivities, and then helped him find<br/>
another activity. It&#39;s difficult. The party is going on right across the<br/>
street. Boys, including Riley&#39;s buddies, are being invited. I need to help my<br/>
older child get ready for it, buy presents, etc. It is in our face for days.<br/>
All the other kids we play with are talking about it. Riley is the only one<br/>
the block not included. It sucks and he&#39;s passionate. He is learning to hate<br/>
people. When a mom is having 15 kids over 1 more or less really does not make<br/>
a difference. They want to make him feel better by giving him candy, when what<br/>
he truly wants is to be included. This year I did ask if the whole family was<br/>
invited or just Ashley. There will be more adults at this party than kids as<br/>
the family is large with active grand parents. It is a family party for those<br/>
who are blood family. I just do not get why the rest of our family does not<br/>
get invited? It hurts, we will be sad, Riley will throw fits, now Tessa is<br/>
throwing them to. What words would you give these little ones to tell them,<br/>
yes it&#39;s sad.People suck, but we still need to respect them. My kids do not<br/>
respect being left out. I&#39;m sorry. Truly no other activity will be equally<br/>
exciting. What ever we do tonight from 5pm-9pm will be second for my son. He<br/>
is learning discrimination, first by gender now by age.<br/>
<br/>
To answer Heidi&#39;s question about other families calling to ask if their kids<br/>
could come too. Parties at are house have always been friends and their<br/>
families. I will always say yes if a brother or sister wants to join us. Moms<br/>
and dads bring their kids over, they too usually stay and all ages have a<br/>
blast together. We usually say sibs included on the invite. This type of drop<br/>
your kid off party is perpetuated from the schools where even in Kindergarden,<br/>
little kids who hate being left without parents get dropped off at parties. <br/>
<br/>
Wish us well as conjure up some exciting situation to keep our other 2 kids<br/>
happy. And tomorrow, I&#39;ll let you all know the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Mary H.</div>

<br/>
Two years ago, when she turned 8, she wanted to have a horseback-riding<br/>
party. It was lovely, a trail ride at Sunol Regional park for any bay<br/>
area folks. They only had 10 horses available, though, so when we were<br/>
planning I was very clear with her that we couldn&#39;t invite all the little<br/>
brothers and sisters like we usually do. So we started making the list ,<br/>
but was adding two 4 year old little brothers. I reminded her that this<br/>
party had to just be for actual friends, and she puffed up and pointed<br/>
out that &quot;Joe is not a Little Brother, Joe is a Friend, Too.&quot; And he is -<br/>
they play together, either with his older sister or just the two of them<br/>
when she and Rain have a tiff. She&#39;s known him since he was 6 months old.<br/>
And he&#39;ll be invited to her party next month...<br/>
<br/>
I agree that you can&#39;t control other people, which makes it hard. And it<br/>
seems to me that most school-kid parties we&#39;ve been to run this way,<br/>
while most homeschooler parties that we attend are for families. But<br/>
since Riley is a Friend Too, it does seem really rude.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I would talk to Ashley about how I thought it was rude, and offer<br/>
a special family event for your family at the same time as the party, and<br/>
then let her chose. And agree with Riley and Tessa that it sucks, and<br/>
isn&#39;t nice. I just hate shit like this...<br/>

<br/>
Parties at our house are sometimes friends and families and sometimes <br/>
exclusively a small group of specially invited people - sometimes it <br/>
depends on finances and sometimes it depends on how much hoopla I feel like <br/>
dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
Mary - I don&#39;t know your kids, so there is NO insult intended here, but it <br/>
sounds strange that they&#39;d so purposely exclude ONLY your son, when it is <br/>
apparent that there are enough people (adults and kids) who are already <br/>
attending that one extra kid wouldn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d wonder why they are doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Surely they don&#39;t turn into jerks just this one time every year - so, if <br/>
they&#39;re generally jerks and not nice to kids, then I&#39;d consider backing off <br/>
from having my OTHER kid there, either.<br/>
<br/>
If they are NOT generally jerks, then I&#39;d consider whether there is a <br/>
reason they don&#39;t want your son there. Maybe he did something at their <br/>
house once and they&#39;re holding it against him. Maybe they have him over <br/>
only when someone has time to watch over him. Maybe you&#39;re seeing all the <br/>
kids playing together but maybe, in fact, their kid has a big problem with <br/>
your son that you&#39;re not aware of.<br/>
<br/>
I mean - from what you&#39;re telling us - something isn&#39;t computing.<br/>
<br/>
A party for all girls - yeah - well - that stinks but people do get stuck <br/>
in ruts and do that.<br/>
<br/>
I think you started out telling us that they were excluding him because <br/>
he&#39;s younger and that this was a party for only a certain age of kids. <br/>
Again, stinks but not uncommon - it is a way to limit the number of kids in <br/>
order to limit the amount of hoopla (stress, space, hassle, money, etc) and <br/>
also because sometimes people want to do activities aimed at older kids and <br/>
don&#39;t want to have to make the accomodations to younger ones (watching over <br/>
how they use a hot glue gun, for example).<br/>
<br/>
A party for lots and lots and lots of friends and family of all ages where <br/>
one of five playmates gets very very specifically excluded? That is <br/>
purposeful and there is a reason of some kind.<br/>
