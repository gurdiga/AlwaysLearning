<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907702849">Hi, I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while, learning a lot about what it really means to unschool.  Sometimes that learning is more effective when experienced rather than read about.  I&#39;m a sahm to dd Sami 6yrs and ds Xander, 3 in April.  We always planned to homeschool and I liked what I&#39;ve read about unschooling (life learning).  About a year ago I purchased a second hand Oak Meadow curriculum for K thinking that I should at least look at some kind of curriculum and that one appealed to me the best.  That thing is still sitting in my &quot;to read&quot; pile and we&#39;ve been doing our own thing which involves no structure though I do try and keep some kind of rhythm.<br/>
We have four fire signs living in this house which gets interesting.  This afternoon Sami and I were butting heads about a few things.  I got a little frustrated that she wouldn&#39;t listen to me about anything even though I was trying to show her an easy solution to some frustration that she was experiencing.  I said &quot;why won&#39;t you let me help you?  This (meaning learning at home) is not going to work if you won&#39;t let me help you learn things.&quot;  She declared most strongly &quot;this IS working...I KNOW it is..it&#39;s MY way..My secret&quot;.   I was the one learning a lesson about letting go and letting her find her way and helping when asked.  A little later she said to me &quot;Mum, I know a lot of things...letters, numbers, colours and shapes...but the most important thing is this..&quot; ..and she hugged me.  Another wonderful lesson from a very wise old soul.  How lucky am I?!!<br/>

Simplicity cannot be attained by striving, but only by letting go.<br/>

I&#39;m in the desert by choice; sorry you&#39;re stuck.<br/>
(Well I&#39;m not in low yucky desert, high desert...)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I said &quot;why won&#39;t you let me help you?  This (meaning learning at home) is <br/>
not going to work if you won&#39;t let me help you learn things.&quot;  She declared <br/>
most strongly &quot;this IS working...I KNOW it is..it&#39;s MY way..My secret&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had my feelings hurt a few times when Kirby was little because he didn&#39;t <br/>
want my help.  I pressed myself to learn to get over it.   <br/>
<br/>
You can still help, you just get to learn new and different ways to help.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted a book of baby names to name a rat.  I took her to a bookstore <br/>
where she looked at six different babynames books and chose one by the way the <br/>
text was laid out.  I didn&#39;t mention that, specifically.  It was also a trade <br/>
paperback, larger paper, nicer paper (not the high-end newsprint of the <br/>
smaller paperbacks).  She&#39;s very happy with it.  I&#39;m guessing she&#39;ll have it for the <br/>
next 20 years or more and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I someday have  a <br/>
grandchild or two get named with a name she chooses sometime in the next year or so.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s especially interested in Greek names, since the Hermione/Persephone <br/>
thing (which had to do with her watching the Arthur episode about Harry Potter <br/>
(kind of, obliquely &lt;g&gt;), and then going with me to play a game about word <br/>
origins with 6th and 7th graders.<br/>
<br/>
One thing leads to other things.<br/>
