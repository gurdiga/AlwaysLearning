<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882972216">OH NO.<br/>
<br/>
I came in and hoped a site I went to last night was still on the pulldown, <br/>
but no, Marty filled it up with HIS junk.  No porn, nothing interesting, but <br/>
THIS:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Ready to see how smart you are? IQ tests are the standard way to measure <br/>
intelligence. And Emode&#39;s world-famous Ultimate IQ Test is the most thorough <br/>
and insightful IQ Test you can take online. It&#39;s free, it&#39;s private and it&#39;s <br/>
developed by PhDs. Don&#39;t miss out! Get your 15-page, scientifically valid <br/>
report at the end of the test. Good luck! -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The site needed a password so I couldn&#39;t see what kind of test it really was..<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s taking IQ tests when I&#39;m asleep.  What if he didn&#39;t score well and it&#39;s <br/>
making him feel bad about himself?  I&#39;m amused that it&#39;s so disturbing.  I&#39;d <br/>
almost rather he&#39;d go back to the centaur porn.<br/>

This could be the secret identifying code between unschoolers.  *Which<br/>
would bother you more, your child taking a test or your child looking at<br/>
porn.*  <br/>
<br/>
I love this!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the laugh!<br/>

Nick (12) went through a phase of taking online iq tests.  I think it was a <br/>
way of estimating what an outside assessment of himself would look like, but <br/>
I don&#39;t know how seriously he took it.  I like taking personality and iq <br/>
tests every once in a while just to see if I&#39;m slowing down or enjoy the <br/>
latest did you know this about yourself trend.<br/>

he&#39;s in 3rd grade.  He started asking me to teach him school-at-home.  I&#39;ve<br/>
procrastinated ever since &lt;g&gt;<br/>
