<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384504063">Since we are talking about stories on the news I wanted to ask if anyone has seen<br/>
yesterday&#39;s Wife Swap with yet another unschooling family.<br/>
This is the second unschooling family in the last 4 weeks.<br/>
Has anyone see it?<br/>
Do you thing their portray of unschooling is going to be a positive one or not?<br/>
Would you want your family that has doubts about it to see these shows?<br/>
I am part of homeschool groups and people just thing unschooling is when moms just neglect everything and DO NOTHING&gt;<br/>
They tell me they met unschoolers and that they would be destroying things and hurting other kids and mom did nothing in the name of unschooling.<br/>
This brings me to another topic that maybe belongs to another post.<br/>
Lately there have been some great things written about what NOT to do but is there a list ( for beginners and people learning ) about what TO DO?<br/>
A big compilation ( SP?) so people does not thing that uschooling parents just sit on their ass and let the kids fend for themselves.<br/>

<br/>
-=-Uh, I don&#39;t know. I enjoy reading it. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m better <br/>
or more knowledgeable about Shakespeare, but I do enjoy it. And my <br/>
daughter has enjoyed it too. And reading it lead to all sorts of <br/>
other wonderful connections and other fun stuff. I think that story <br/>
is on Sandra&#39;s site, yeah here, http://sandradodd. com/strew/ <br/>
shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, really, it can&#39;t be said about everyone. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I did take it back. I said it wasn&#39;t true but that people <br/>
shouldn&#39;t TELL someone else to read Shakespeare, unless they were <br/>
willing to risk the person hating Shakespeare (paraphrasing or <br/>
clarifying myself).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=If a kid showed some interest in Shakespeare I&#39;m gonna pull out <br/>
my book with his plays in it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I pull out the DVDs. I&#39;ve gotten the book to read something that was <br/>
left out, or to check people&#39;s names (though the internet is way <br/>
better for that these days, and with google you can find particular <br/>
lines from plays and get the citation (act/scene/line) , so my books <br/>
are getting dustier.<br/>
<br/>
I did read Henry V before ever seeing or hearing any, and I kinda had <br/>
the hots for this reformed, responsible, compassionate former hoodlum <br/>
of a young king when I was 19 and in college. Mine was way cuter <br/>
than Kenneth Brannagh, too.<br/>
<br/>
I can look at music and tell at least vaguely what it would sound <br/>
like, but if there&#39;s a piano in the room, I go and put it into the <br/>
air (at least the melody line). Just last night I played through the <br/>
left hand of something in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. It was by <br/>
William Byrd and it was called &quot;Bells.&quot; It&#39;s like a church bell- <br/>
pulling team ringing the changes. After four pages I saw it kept <br/>
going but I didn&#39;t turn that other page. I was thinking, though, how <br/>
fun it must&#39;ve been at one time &quot;to do bell ringing&quot; at home, in the <br/>
1600s, instead of needing a church and four or six people pulling <br/>
big ropes to a script.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s a GREAT thing about a book. I can put sound into the air <br/>
that was first written down in the 1500s or early 1600s (in that <br/>
case). But the book didn&#39;t do it. The composer and collectors and <br/>
transcriptionists and engravers and printers and I did that. (I did <br/>
the easy part.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30988420">Gee I don&#39;t know maybe something like that one everyone contributed to.<br/>
Something like.<br/>
* Read to your kids when they play video games<br/>
*Take them to the library to look for books or movies they are interested<br/>
* share information without turning into a lesson<br/>
* share information until you kid is done and them back off<br/>
( those are not well written but just on top of my hear quick)<br/>
<br/>
Not a list to follow item by item but to show people that just letting kids fend for alone is not unschooling.<br/>
I know it does look different form household to household and kids are so vastly different<br/>
These &quot;list&quot; might exist and I just never came across.<br/>
I like that in that link you just send a few posts ago about DO IT<br/>
what Kelly Lovejoy said about leave like its the last year of your life.<br/>
<br/>
What I saw in Wife Swap yesterday looked like a mom turning everything into a lesson. Maybe she does not do it <br/>
in her day to day life and was just saying things so people would see learning in everything.<br/>
But it did look like she was creating lessons and teaching moments.<br/>

<br/>
The unschooling mom, you  mean?<br/>
<br/>
Wife Swap directly solicited our family three different times, three  <br/>
different producers.  I thought about it and they give $20,000.   But  <br/>
they also totally exploit bad moments and while I might&#39;ve had fun  <br/>
visiting some military fundamentalist family, my family  might&#39;ve  <br/>
been miserable back home.  And the program isn&#39;t honest, and I don&#39;t  <br/>
deal with dishonesty.   When they say &quot;a week&quot; it&#39;s more like three  <br/>
or four days, I think.  But the time you deal with the crew is a week  <br/>
(or something).  Ren Allen&#39;s family considered it too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the thing:  Suddenly &quot;switching to unschooling&quot; is no more  <br/>
than a snow day, or a fun Saturday.  It&#39;s not unschooling.   <br/>
Unschooling takes months to kick in, and that&#39;s months of one or both  <br/>
parents REALLY really working to learn a new way of seeing learning.   <br/>
Just as someone can&#39;t make sourdough bread or make beer or wine in  <br/>
just an hour, you can&#39;t show unschooling in a day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294552969">Yes it was the unschooling mom towards her kids. I know there is editing and it is not honest.<br/>
Just wondering what those shows impact would be for how people see unschooling. Not that I care about what<br/>
other people think. More for those who struggle with  it. <br/>
As for the list. Thanks. I will go read and re-read those.<br/>
My idea is to have them so I can forward to people who want them.<br/>
I am not really good about explaining what we do or unschooling.<br/>
I have been trying to explain to my sister and I have been sending her links. She pulled her son out  this fall and they never thought they would<br/>
homeschool. I don&#39;t know if they will unschool because of her husband.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464381807">I don&#39;t watch TV but as owner of NY models inc I know the biz.   my sister has produced some segments of wife swap. & like most of the reality shows it&quot;s all TV & mostly not true.  things are edited to become something else.   my agency dir, DD was just on a reality show called TRUE BEAUTY.  ASHLEY signed a contract w/ abc not to talk about anything. of course she told her mom &lt;susie Q in georga derante&#39;s book &quot;the company she keeps&quot;&gt; ashley cried over what they did & @ 21 she has been modeling all her life & knows the biz. mom sue has also modeled all her life. show  told  ashley  only to donate to group leader who would donate to charity...then said &quot;ashley doesn&#39;t donate&quot;  edited where she asked bicyclist  if he need help.    another girl on show who was a co. dancer was made to look like a go go dancer.  i didn&#39;t watch true beauty either but told ashley everyone should know there shows are set up.  one of other girls won trip from true beauty to PV mexico & is taking ashley. but will show tell you that?  wonderful friendships were made on show.    don&#39;t believe what you see on tv or read in paper or on net.   i have a million more stories i can&#39;t tell.  :)   ***sim&#39;aria***<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337538857">--==Just wondering what those shows impact would be for how people see<br/>

those who struggle with it.==--<br/>
<br/>
I saw part of this episode and also another one that had a family who<br/>
identified themselves as unschoolers. I can speak as someone who<br/>
aspires to unschool and is still learning and who has a lot of<br/>
&quot;doubters&quot; in my life right now. It seemed to me not to represent the<br/>
unschooling philosophy well. Actually it may have more been that the<br/>
other family was SO against it (which is the premise of the show -- to<br/>
find family&#39;s VERY different from each other, seemingly opposites) The<br/>
words used by the OTHER mother were very harsh and judgmental and I&#39;m<br/>
sure that many of the viewers agreed with them, so just thinking that<br/>
is intimidating (as much as I too aspire to not worry what &quot;others&quot;<br/>
think!) <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I still don&#39;t discuss unschooling much out loud. He<br/>
knows that I read and post to this list. He knows I am VERY interested<br/>
and I have said how much I love it. His response while watching this<br/>
show was &quot;I don&#39;t like unschooling... I want my kids in school&quot; When I<br/>
said, what if I wasn&#39;t using the word &quot;unschooling&quot; just talking about<br/>
HOMEschooling, he still said, I don&#39;t like that either. ugh. Very<br/>
discouraging. I asked him why and also said that I didn&#39;t think that<br/>
he knew that much about it. He seems to think he gets the idea, that<br/>
it is obvious.... also, he is very much like this -- once he says he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like something he won&#39;t really expand on it or discuss it more. <br/>
<br/>
I still have about 2 1/2 years before we would put our daughter in<br/>
school so I am still hopeful. I also ALWAYS keep in mind Sandra&#39;s wise<br/>
words -- my family being together and happy is my #1 priority. But I<br/>
feel like I WANT unschooling just as much as my husband feels opposed<br/>
to it -- so I&#39;m not ready to &quot;give up&quot;. I have been thinking of<br/>
different things -- I may write him a letter since we aren&#39;t so great<br/>
about discussing the topic yet. I also would LOVE to go to a<br/>
conference sometime in the next couple of years (with him of course).<br/>
If it comes to school and he still has not changed his mind at all I<br/>
am ready to accept that, and of course know that nothing is set in<br/>
stone. It just makes me sad to think that maybe it won&#39;t be for us...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening! I kind of veered from wife swap to a new topic...<br/>

was very young at the time (barely 1).  Elimination communication too.<br/>
 On the surface they both seemed completely nuts to me: unschooling<br/>
b/c how could it work, EC b/c it seemed too controlling.  I&#39;m glad I<br/>

<br/>
More &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; in her life and philosophy, and still dividing <br/>
learning into schoolish or academic subjects for me to consider her an <br/>
unschooler *as we discuss it here*. For example she took the other family&#39;s <br/>
girls to the amusement park with a teaching agenda, and tried to manipulate <br/>
conversations towards that teaching moment, apparently trying to show that <br/>
teaching can make learning fun. It may have been better to just let the <br/>
girls feel like they were taking a break from school rather than trying to <br/>
bring school even there (from their pov).<br/>
<br/>
When she describes her school and how she teaches, to me she is describing <br/>
the absolutely very best of schooling, the best kind of schoolish academic <br/>
education. I&#39;m sure her school is great fun. But it is still a school.<br/>
<br/>
I commented to her page, not about these ideas since telling her she&#39;s not <br/>
really unschooling would be rude in her own house (ie blog), but instead <br/>
mentioning that it was hardly surprising that the show would be skewed for <br/>
entertainment value and asking the million dollar question - why did she <br/>
choose to be on it.<br/>

First because it answered my question about  if what she did at home was the unschooling we talked about here.<br/>
I had mentioned how it looked like she was trying to find teachable moments in everything. Well she really was.<br/>
It was not just to show the other family.<br/>
Second I  got to know them a little better and I have to say that she was very gracious about the other mom and family.<br/>
She sounds like a very nice person and not neglectful like TV portrayed.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heather mentions her daughter in a response to a question below her blog <br/>
entry, and it sounds like they made the deliberate and laudable choice to <br/>
shield her from the experience since she wasn&#39;t there according to the blog <br/>
(as distinct from getting very little air time as apparently occured with <br/>
her eldest son.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful that I am in a position to be able to say &quot;there&#39;s not enough <br/>
money in the world&quot; to persuade me to do a show like that, especially when <br/>
there are so many other types of shows. However had I a family member with a <br/>
medical condition I might find even an exploitative show worth it or <br/>
justified. There but for the grace of God go I.....In truth I assumed the <br/>
first reason was money (for anyone who agrees to go on this type of show), <br/>
but I was wondering if there were more reasons as well, and if the <br/>
experience fulfilled those reasons, given that her younger son has been <br/>
damaged, according again to her blog. I hope the fees were enormous and <br/>
bless both families for a long time to come.<br/>
<br/>
However the larger discussion was about the perception of unschooling in the <br/>
wider community, and people here expressing doubts that Heather was <br/>
practicing unschooling *in the way it is discussed here*. There are many <br/>
home schooling people who do tons of volunteering at local, State and even <br/>
national levels. There are many people who are lovely parents and nice and <br/>
kind and generous. But that doesn&#39;t make them unschoolers, especially as we <br/>
define unschooling here.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to imply that she was a bad person or mercenary, Pam, and <br/>
I&#39;m sorry if it came across that way. I&#39;m sure she is a very nice and <br/>
dedicated parent and teacher. She is clearly a joyful person and it sounds <br/>
like her kids are joyful, creative and vivid people too. I already said her <br/>
school as she describes it, sounds like the very best kind of school for <br/>
children. I would add it sounds like the very best model of a school for <br/>
people interested in school reform.<br/>
<br/>
But on this list, for the purposes of discussion and helping people move <br/>
toward unschooling, someone whose language is full of the word &quot;teach&quot; over <br/>
and over, whose practice discusses classes and school subjects and wanting <br/>
to discover children&#39;s learning styles in order to teach them in the right <br/>
way for them (as positive an idea as that is in a school context), who <br/>
continues to call herself a &quot;teacher&quot; and freely uses labels (positive and <br/>
negative) for her children in public writing, is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t unschooling in the fully committed way that so many of the long <br/>
time unschoolers on this list have been for so long. In some respects <br/>
someone who so &quot;close but no cigar&quot; to unschooling can cause even more <br/>
confusion in an arena where there are already self-designated experts out <br/>
there promoting extremely fuzzy definitions and letting the word <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; come to mean anything that is other than paralleling the <br/>
public school curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
In the end people have the right to call themselves anything they want. The <br/>
First Amendment, isn&#39;t it? To say any crazy thing you like, as long as it is <br/>
not inciting someone to commit a crime. Someone I know talks about &quot;her <br/>
unschooling&quot; as being that she teaches only what she, the Mom, is interested <br/>
in rather than following another curriculum. Her language is full of &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
words and her self and how satisfied she is with herself and how much <br/>
happier she is with this - and it is a step forward from where she was, now <br/>
much more relaxed doing what I would happily call &quot;eclectic unit studies&quot; <br/>
rather than unschooling. If she were to come here or UD or .info or even <br/>
RUNing she might discover that she is further from genuine, authentic <br/>
unschooling than she believes herself to be. But she might read Heather&#39;s <br/>
blog entry and start to think that she could go further, not towards <br/>
genuine, authentic unschooling, but in her teaching practices. Or not, I <br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
My friend, who is kind and lovely and a volunteer and socially aware, but <br/>
not really an unschooler, is only hurting me by calling herself so in the <br/>
sense that there is a small wall between us made out of the bricks of my <br/>
judgment around her wrong (IMO) use of a word that represents something that <br/>
is the heart of my life. I have this devil desire to set her straight, but I <br/>
refrain because the other parts of our friendship are so very valuable to <br/>
me, and all I can really do is tell my own stories in the context of real <br/>
conversations. Maybe one day she will ask. The difference is that she is a <br/>
private person. She isn&#39;t on national, perhaps international television, <br/>
mangling or diluting or obfuscating for the uninitiated what unschooling <br/>
really can be. She isn&#39;t making public statements defining unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect, going back to &quot;why&#39;d she do it&quot;, that part of Heather&#39;s own <br/>
agenda was to promote the school reform and home schooling movements. Maybe <br/>
she saw an opportunity to highlight the possibilities of a better <br/>
educational life for children that her kind of wonderful child focussed <br/>
teaching methods can create. Did she succeed in that, or was she the victim <br/>
of a predictable desire to record apparent conflict (which is what &quot;sells <br/>
tickets&quot;) on the part of the producers which ultimately betrayed her and the <br/>
other unfortunate mother? As someone with an interest in how television <br/>
communicates, and how the language of television and mass media can affect <br/>
the content of the message, these are questions I am interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just the fact that she was on the show will bring the curious to her <br/>
blog, and that she have a positive effect on some child&#39;s life somewhere if <br/>
that child&#39;s parent chooses to relax and support their child&#39;s passion. I <br/>
hope so, and I really would expect so.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean that I have to call even well intentioned teaching <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, especially here.<br/>

&quot;Let’s teach America about the benefits of unschooling!&quot;<br/>

That&#39;s the line I liked best.  I printed that one out and put it on  <br/>
the wall.  I don&#39;t want to &quot;teach&quot; anyone anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The most deer-in-the-headlights situation I saw was a fundamentalist  <br/>
homeschooling family in which the kids never watched TV.  If they were  <br/>
really good, they were allowed to listen to Christian radio with  <br/>
headphones for an hour, or some such.     So HOW ON EARTH could they  <br/>
have had a clue about what was about to happen to them?  But I&#39;m  <br/>
certain the producers persuaded them that they could witness for  <br/>
Christ on this show.<br/>
<br/>
But if people bail out partway through or are insufficiently  <br/>
interesting, they don&#39;t get the $20,000.    Outside of the wrestling  <br/>
soap operas, it seems as close to the Roman Colosseum for the U.S. as  <br/>
we have.   Only these are not trained gladiators.  (Those are on the  <br/>

It&#39;s a show that is produced in the UK (I think a lot of the reality<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Other countries and versions<br/>
<br/>
Localised versions of Wife Swap were produced by Viasat and broadcast<br/>
in Croatia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.<br/>
Viasat was the first company in the world to adapt the format locally.<br/>
<br/>
The first adaptation was broadcast in Denmark in Autumn 2003. A<br/>
version in Serbia is shown on RTV Pink, called Menjam Å¾enu, which<br/>
premiered in July 2006. Also, Chile premiered its own version of Wife<br/>
Swap called &quot;Â¿QuiÃ©n cambia a quiÃ©n? Intercambio de Esposas&quot; (Who<br/>
changes whom?: Wife Swap) on 14 March 2006. The series is produced by<br/>
Canal 13 and hosted by Cecilia Bolocco. The Croatian version is<br/>
broadcast on RTL Televizija. There is also a Dutch and a Belgian<br/>
version of Wife Swap. The version shown in the The Netherlands is<br/>
called &quot;Jouw Vrouw Mijn Vrouw&quot; (Your wife My wife), and in Belgium,<br/>
it&#39;s called &quot;De Nieuwe Mama&quot; (The New Mum/Mam/Mom). There is also a<br/>
Czech Version, hosted by NOVA TV, called VÃ½mÄna ManÅ¾elek (Wife Swap).<br/>
In Germany Wife Swap is called Frauentausch and premiered on 14 July<br/>
2003 on RTL II.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726876353">It&#39;s been flitting around uncomfortably in my head all night about the <br/>
various discussions on a couple of unschooling forums about this show, <br/>
particularly the general idea that Heather didn&#39;t show unschooling in a very <br/>
good light. I have watched a couple of episodes of Wife Swap, enough to get <br/>
the formula, and I have watched about 10 minutes worth of Super Nanny, <br/>
enough to get nauseated. I doubt that any lifestyle is shown at its best on <br/>
any of these shows.<br/>
<br/>
If a camera crew with the intent to create compelling television were to <br/>
follow me around being selective about what would show, I highly doubt that <br/>
my parenting, James&#39; parenting or Jayn&#39;s behavior would show unschooling in <br/>
a good light. It might only take clever editing of Jayn asking me for a <br/>
drink as she does about 10 times a day and me fetching it for her to give <br/>
the impression to the audience that she is spoiled and I am a doormat, <br/>
regardless of how happily I do it. If she happened to get hungry and have a <br/>
meltdown, she would look like an out of control screaming maniac, and you <br/>
may be sure that would get plenty of air time.<br/>
<br/>
Any group of people watching an event unfolding are going to see different <br/>
things. There have been many reluctant spouses who go to a conference and <br/>
see wonders and become converts, but that have also been reluctant spouses <br/>
at the same conferences who see wildness and become even more reluctant. <br/>
Critiquing how someone apparently behaved on a tv show with the unseen <br/>
mediation and machinations of producers whose agenda is going to be <br/>
self-serving no matter what, is a bit unfair. I&#39;m glad anyone on these shows <br/>
still has the recourse of the internet where they can write up their <br/>
refutations and point of view about what happened, and what was not seen. I <br/>
hope no more unschoolers feel called to do that or similar shows. Because it <br/>
never will show unschooling in a good light.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779703941">Yeah, the reason I didn&#39;t know she considered herself<br/>
an unschooler was probably because in my contacts with her,<br/>
I didn&#39;t really recognize her actions as what we call <br/>
RU.  She probably told me she was &quot;an unschooler&quot;, but <br/>
if I had judged her as other than RU, I probably just <br/>
&lt;mentally&gt; relabeled her *style* in my mind.  And that&#39;s <br/>
why her label didn&#39;t stick.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree, it&#39;s impossible to know how the family unit worked,<br/>
(as a whole), with all the editing. I&#39;m sure there were <br/>
tons of beautiful, impressive, enlightening moments that <br/>
were cut. I missed her show so haven&#39;t seen it, yet, lol! <br/>
But hope to see a friend&#39;s copy of it. I have watched the show <br/>
many times and seen how they can really tear into a <br/>
family- particularly homeschooled ones.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve held off reading Heather&#39;s blog till after I see <br/>
the show.  I think most HS&#39;ers doubt that they will show <br/>
homeschooling (let alone RU&#39;ing) in a great light so she <br/>
probably heard the fears/doubts of people in her community <br/>
when the topic was being discussed last year - when WifeSwap <br/>
was a-knockin. I&#39;m guessing they must have really needed <br/>
the funds for their daughter and decided to just hope <br/>
for the best. Sometimes WifeSwap will actually take a <br/>
&quot;alternative&quot; family and show them up, slightly positively,<br/>
though it&#39;s rare.<br/>

I&#39;ve held off reading Heather&#39;s blog till after I see<br/>
the show. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised she said as much as she did.  i don&#39;t know what the  <br/>
confidentiality agreement is that goes with the receipt of that money,  <br/>
but I&#39;m sure there is one.   Maybe it&#39;s not to name or discuss any of  <br/>
the crew or producers.  (Just guessing.)<br/>

recognize editing issues, but I like looking at different places to <br/>
know that some of them really DO look like sit com sets and some of <br/>
them look like all kinds of things I would never have imagined <br/>
(having grown up in a house that looked perfect all the time).  :)<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to see the shows from other countries with <br/>
subtitles.  I wouldn&#39;t consider it as definitive of what those <br/>
people in other countries are like, but sort of looking through a <br/>
keyhole and getting a glimpse of simliarities and differences that <br/>
are interesting to consider.<br/>
