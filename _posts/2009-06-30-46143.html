Do they mean &quot;do over&quot; to change and do differently maybe?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I was thinking &quot;What was so great that you&#39;d like to re-live it.&quot;<br/>

I posed this question to Brenna who wrote a some essays for scholarships last year.? She really thought that it<br/>
meant &quot;do over&quot; as in to re-live it because it was so great.? Her response was to write about &quot;doing over&quot; the choice to<br/>
not attend school.? I think it could be answered either way and that might be a good way for her essay to stand out<br/>
from the rest.<br/>
