&gt; right thing here - I was finally feeling like I was getting the <br/>
&gt; correct &quot;ideas&quot; of this &quot;unschooling or Life Learning&quot;, that it was <br/>
&gt; starting to make sense to me, and my son is so much happier than he <br/>
&gt; was in school, but now that my closest &quot;unschooling&quot; friend is <br/>
&gt; questioning me so I feel confused again.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think your friend may simply be reacting out of protecting her beloved.  <br/>
She &quot;questioned&quot; you, you answered her.  You stayed with your beliefs.  Well <br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
Now the trick, imo, is to let it go.  You were challenged and handled it <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a theory about the &#39;comfusion&#39; you&#39;re experiencing, too.  (my local <br/>
friends get lots of my theories so here&#39;s one for you, too!).....  When we <br/>
explore emotions/theories or try on a new attitude or behavior or whatever, there <br/>
is not only a thinking change but also a bodily change.  I think the whole body <br/>
needs to adjusts.  So perhaps your &#39;comfusion&#39; is simply your body settling <br/>
in to a new/different way of &#39;being&#39;..... a different way of handling <br/>
situations.... a different way of explaining your actions and theories..... simply a <br/>
difference..... so your body/mind is adjusting.....  it feels like &#39;confusion&#39; - <br/>
maybe conflict - but perhaps it&#39;s growth and adjustment ......<br/>
<br/>
Just a theory....... What&#39;s your take on what I&#39;ve said?<br/>
<br/>
(And, now, with my other theory of what we say to others is what we need to <br/>
hear ourselves, I&#39;ll re-read what I&#39;ve written as a message to me!)<br/>
