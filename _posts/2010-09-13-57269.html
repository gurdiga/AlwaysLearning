<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948367861">We have a son that is five years old and a daughter that is three.  For the past several weeks, DS has been asking if he can go first for everything - go in the house first, get in the car first, be the first to do something in a Wii game, get dessert first - EVERYTHING.  I can&#39;t figure out what is missing from his life that makes him feel the need to be first at everything.  He is greatly loved, gets a lot of attention, and as far as I know, isn&#39;t needing or wanting for anything.  I&#39;ve asked him why he wants to be first all the time and he says it&#39;s because he&#39;s the best.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas what&#39;s making him feel the need to be first?<br/>

He&#39;s needing to be first.<br/>
He&#39;s wanting to be first.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably MUCH easier for a three year old to wait for a five year  <br/>
old than the other way around, and she would learn more by watching  <br/>
him do whatever it is and then having a turn, than the other way around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091852872">I also have kids aged 5 and 3. My older daughter Ashlin also often wants to be first in the car etc, very similar to what you described. It is usually fine because she is more capable of going first. Often she has initiated the activity and so naturally wants to go first. If her younger sister Eden has initiated something, then I default to Eden going first.<br/>
<br/>
I think is is pretty natural for there to be a certain level of competition between siblings, but it sounds like you are catering well for both children&#39;s needs, so I don&#39;t think the older child wanting to go first is necessarily something to be concerned about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675826821">I have seen with my kids. Daughter 8 and son 4. Though now the issue is no<br/>
longer there. But there was a time when DD wanted a lot of attention like<br/>
wanting to be first, wanting the same Toy as DS, wanting to be picked up by<br/>
daddy, wanting me to sleep between them in the night etc.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is just the sudden sharing of attention and parents, grandparents<br/>
and things and time with another kid, that causes this kind of need to<br/>
arise. SO we made it a point to mostly let her get all the above things she<br/>
wanted or needed. Except for wanting to be picked up, simply because she is<br/>
a big built girl. But we told her we could let her sit on our lap while<br/>
sitting on the bed or sofa. She was fine with that.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra here, that the need and want is clear and it is as he<br/>
says &quot;wants and needs to be first&quot;.<br/>

first - the first child. And he&#39;s wanting that position to be made <br/>
concrete.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try to give him the chance to be first as much as possible - and <br/>
make a point about saying, &quot;You go first,&quot; &quot;You be first,&quot; before he <br/>
even has to ask.  Because asking that is probably, for him, a little <br/>
like you asking your husband, &quot;Do you love me?&quot;  Yes, its good to know - <br/>
but isn&#39;t it better to hear it without having to ask?<br/>

first.  Usually when we get in the car...first to touch the car (it&#39;s  <br/>
parked by a curb, we don&#39;t run through a parking lot to do this);  <br/>
first to sit, first to buckle, first to touch the steering wheel.  I  <br/>
won one time by yelling first to touch Addi, as I poked her on the  <br/>
arm.  It&#39;s goofy and fun, and we&#39;re laughing a lot when we do this.<br/>

No, she doesn&#39;t.  My answer to her is always &quot;Sure&quot; or &quot;Of course&quot;.  I don&#39;t think the thought would have even occurred to her if she hadn&#39;t heard her brother always asking if he could go first.  I think she&#39;s just repeating what she hears him say.  <br/>

You&#39;re right.  It definitely means a lot to him to go first.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;d ever tell him he couldn&#39;t be first.  He seems to be struggling a bit more lately with having a sibling and this is one way of establishing the pecking order, I guess.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Try to do some more things with him alone. Be sure you&#39;re making eye <br/>
contact and hugging him a lot. Be sure he has some special things that <br/>
are his that you are careful to protect from younger sibling. And - <br/>
really - take him out to dinner with mom and dad once in a while - or to <br/>
a movie or something, if you have anybody the younger sibling will be <br/>
happy staying home with.<br/>
<br/>
I was the oldest. Those few times my parents took me out without my <br/>
siblings are in my memory as extremely EXTREMELY wonderful times. Once <br/>
was the night before I was going in to the hospital to have my tonsils <br/>
out. Another was when my grandparents were coming home from having been <br/>
out of the country for a couple of years and they took me, and not my <br/>
sisters, to the airport (because of lack of room, I realize now, but at <br/>
the time it was very thrilling and an honor to me).<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &quot;pecking order.&quot;  I think it&#39;s his neediness in  <br/>
the moment, and wanting to know that you&#39;re still his partner, that  <br/>
it&#39;s not you and the new kid against him the old kid.  That would be  <br/>
my guess, as a firstborn with lots of vivid memories from my sister&#39;s  <br/>
homecoming and subsequent overthrow of my only-child world. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870470288"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;pecking order&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There probably IS an actual hierarchy. Biologically. With dogs and<br/>
cats, you can see the interplay within the different shades of order<br/>
among them. Which THEY maintain. No need to do that externally. I<br/>
think the same is true of children. There&#39;s no need to maintain an<br/>
order among because they all have their own ideas which will probably<br/>
always conflict with one another&#39;s and change at least somewhat over<br/>
time. It&#39;s an issue that influences me and Brian and Karl too even<br/>
though Karl is an only child since we parents are both middle<br/>
children.. the ones picked most often to play the role of being in the<br/>
&quot;wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a male cat and a female cat who are about the same age. I think<br/>
the female is a bit older. I make sure to give them each lots of<br/>
attention and pet and talk with them together, apart and with the dog<br/>
too who, being a dachshund, is also their same size (they are a little<br/>
taller than Katie is ;). They get along very well, mainly I think<br/>
because I know cats like tons of space especially from each other and<br/>
the male cat cuddles with the dog with much less tension than hugging<br/>
on a female cat who doesn&#39;t want to be messed with.<br/>
<br/>
Children have different preferences for closeness, space and things,<br/>
some to do with gender sometimes but mostly to do with how they<br/>
interact with others and think of themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My three sisters and I are all very different in a number of ways. It<br/>
would be tempting to say there&#39;s no hierarchy but it would be more<br/>
accurate, I think, to say that we operate in our own spheres and have<br/>
different lives now.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that while the children are young and before they go off on<br/>
their own. Things will change over time if parents avoid getting<br/>
involved in what the pecking order is.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, parents can help each child before then and avoid<br/>
maintaining artificial ideas about the roles they play for however<br/>
long the kids think they have to (I&#39;ve seen that many times over and I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary). Allow each child the room to be who they<br/>
are as fully as possible. It might help, in a way, to think of each as<br/>
&quot;only&quot; children, sort of, since each child is unique with different<br/>
needs from others. Don&#39;t think of children as generic beings in need<br/>
of maintaining some fabled equality.<br/>
