<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176240499">&quot;Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we<br/>
are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most<br/>
frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,<br/>
talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of<br/>
God. Your playing small doesn&#39;t serve the world. There&#39;s nothing enlightened<br/>
about shrinking so that other people won&#39;t feel insecure around you. We are<br/>
all meant to shine, as children do. We are born to make manifest the glory<br/>
of God that is within us. It&#39;s not just in some of us, it&#39;s in everyone. And<br/>
as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission<br/>
to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence<br/>
automatically liberates others.&quot; The above speech by Nelson Mandela was<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030514977">Are you raising your daughter in the United States?  If so, then you are not living in a police state.  Hopefully this won&#39;t change, but we live in a place with lots of opportunities, and the more inner resources, including creative and original thinking, that a person has, the more interesting pathways they can access.  I&#39;ve seen and met homeschooled and unschooled kids who are taking very unique views to the question of what they want to be as they grow up, and that is a source of inspiration and hope!<br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;t insure that a person will be a round peg--and I think tons of parents on this list who have always felt different and unique, and have chosen a different and unique way to live their lives with their children can attest to that.  Most of us have not been homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, having been raised outside of the education system, she will feel more empowered and more hopeful about her impact on her world.  I think school is the perfect place to explore powerlessness, so the antidote is...<br/>

ignorant!<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge is power. Self confidence is power. Felling empowered is  <br/>
power.<br/>
<br/>
I think achieving a true state of blissful ignorance is dependent on  <br/>
personality, how untuned someone is to their world and how tuned they  <br/>
are to their own niche. And that won&#39;t apply to very many people! So  <br/>
it&#39;s not something you can give to a child.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect ignorance is more likely to create someone who has a  <br/>
growing fear there&#39;s something to worry about but is afraid to find  <br/>
out and feels powerless on how someone would take action.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526523344">I think societies throughout history have gone through periods of more social control. In times such as those, it may be the people who can name and question those controls rather than assuming &quot;this is just the way it is&quot; who will be more whole and better able to navigate their own lives. Sure, it will probably be frustrating. But would you rather be frustrated because a) you can see how great things could be, and you&#39;re struggling to carve out a place for that greatness in your own life and world, or b) there&#39;s a lingering sense that something&#39;s wrong, but you can&#39;t really understand why you feel miserable a lot of the time, why other people can&#39;t just tow the line, why the &quot;ills of society&quot; aren&#39;t getting better, etc.<br/>

<br/>
During WWII, famously, stories of air raid rules and blackouts and  <br/>
rationing.   It wasn&#39;t ideal it was an emergency.<br/>
In any situation in which a government &quot;cracks down&quot; (checks your  <br/>
pockets and shoes before you can board a plane), being an unschooler  <br/>
doesn&#39;t save you.  Having gone to school probably doesn&#39;t make it any  <br/>
more pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Being reactionary and negative probably is worse than either of those  <br/>
other two.  I have a brother-in-law whose hobby is pissing and moaning  <br/>
about every thing and every person.  He&#39;s just decided he will NOT get  <br/>
a passport, he will simply never travel again rather than subject  <br/>
himself to more government scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a good idea.  He spreads noise and frustration wherever  <br/>
he goes.  He SHOULD stay home.  His kids will not be visiting him;  <br/>
they quit listening to him years ago.<br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t the situation the OP was describing, but I think it&#39;s related.<br/>
<br/>
My mom set out to raise me in a mostly unschooly way.  She had John Holt<br/>
books on her bookshelves.  She was a gentle, mindful parent.  She supported<br/>
my interests and served as a partner with me as I explored the world.  I was<br/>
a free thinker, a free kid.  It was a sweet & lovely childhood.<br/>
<br/>
But then she died when I was six.  Without my mom as a buffer, my father&#39;s<br/>
mentally illness became a prominent part of my life.  He was abusive to me,<br/>
and not at all equipped to be a parent.  He remarried.  My stepmother was<br/>
very controlling and judgmental and had a lot of beliefs about How Dangerous<br/>
Life Is.  Her home was kinda like a &quot;police state&quot; as far as I was<br/>
concerned.  I was definitely a round peg in a house of square holes, and it<br/>
was very painful.  But I *remembered* my childhood with my mom.  I *knew*<br/>
that there were other possibilities.  That knowledge saved me from<br/>
helplessness and defeat.  I suffered through some verrrrrry unhappy years, a<br/>
whole lot of wrongness, but the whole time I knew that eventually I&#39;d<br/>
escape, and that I&#39;d eventually find joy.<br/>
<br/>
Here I am.  J<br/>
<br/>
National politics swing back and forth, back and forth.. In my opinion,<br/>
being a free thinker, and having a happy, peaceful beginning, is the best<br/>
possible way to cope with those inevitable swings..<br/>

<br/>
There, I think, is the most frightening part of trying to create an  <br/>
ideal situation for our children, is the idea that one might not live  <br/>
to complete the project.<br/>
<br/>
We had a plan early on, but things changed, and I know I&#39;m fortunate  <br/>
not to have needed the bail-out plan.  Holly lately turned 18.  Marty  <br/>
turned 21.  Legally, they won&#39;t need a guardian if something happens  <br/>
to me and Keith now.   Much of that was luck.  I&#39;ve been in accidents,  <br/>
been ill, ridden airplanes...  It&#39;s not that I was good and God or the  <br/>
universe gave me longer life.  I didn&#39;t &quot;manifest&quot; anything.  I  <br/>
happened to live.<br/>

Haha!  My first thought was, &quot;there&#39;s always going to be rock and roll!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All those round pegs will help keep the world round!  I have a very non-conformist daughter, yet, she&#39;s not out to change the world either, she&#39;s not out to prove anything.  I remember when I was a teen and I see teens today do this too, rebelling for the sake of rebelling, doing lots of reactionary damage, just out to prove their parents are wrong, or the system is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always felt like a round peg in a world of square holes, but I&#39;ve found ways to fit in and be at peace with the world, even the things I really dislike.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually think of it as a &quot;square peg in a round hole&quot; because most  <br/>
round pegs would fit in the square holes with little problem!<br/>
<br/>
In that case &lt;g&gt;, I hardly think the world is full of round pegs! More  <br/>
square pegs are being squeezed into round holes in school than  <br/>
anywhere. If anyone might feel helpless to make a difference, it would  <br/>
be those kids, not ours. It takes us square pegs (many of us parents  <br/>
are, too) years to get over that whittling down of our pointy edges  <br/>
and to get them to grow back again. If your daughter maintains her  <br/>
edges, she&#39;s in better shape from the get-go.<br/>

&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think lots of kids who look like they are square pegs fitting nicely <br/>
into square holes don&#39;t have that feeling about themselves. I know &quot;I&quot; <br/>
looked fine - I looked like a very conforming kid, for the most part. I <br/>
was careful about my rebellions - didn&#39;t get myself into much trouble - <br/>
didn&#39;t get noticed very much at all.<br/>
<br/>
But - in answer to the original concern - my grown young adult kids do <br/>
sometimes not fit in. For example, they do have some trouble taking <br/>
directions from &quot;superiors&quot; for example, when they think the person is <br/>
being stupid or mean. They do really quite well in getting along, <br/>
anyway, but when they find themselves in those kinds of situations, they <br/>
start figuring out how to get out of them as quickly as possible.  That <br/>
seems like a good thing, to me, but I can see how some parents might <br/>
view it as their kids not being able to &quot;handle&quot; certain kinds of <br/>
situations. Roxana was pretty miserable working at a department store, <br/>
for a few months, because of how incompetent the management was. She <br/>
didn&#39;t seem able to just accept it and live with it easily. Well - it <br/>
must have been pretty bad - it was Mervyn&#39;s and not long after that they <br/>
went out of business, so maybe it was just really exceptionally bad. <br/>
Maybe they should have listened to her - she could have told them some <br/>
things about how badly the stores were being run. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Roya LOVES her job, but has had some frustration with a couple of <br/>
different bosses. But, that&#39;s probably more her personality - she&#39;s <br/>
bossy, herself. But, from that experience, she&#39;s figured out that she&#39;d <br/>
be way better off and happier to be her own boss and she&#39;s taking steps <br/>
to get herself into that position. So - again - that seems like a good <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my kids have hung out with groups of friends who are more <br/>
conventional - schooled kids, etc., I will say that they and their <br/>
unschooled friends do seem, to me, to stand out in some ways - they do <br/>
seem different. Not that there are not lots of very cool other kids - <br/>
I&#39;m not saying that the unschooled kids are &quot;better&quot; than the others. <br/>
But there are some things schooled kids do that seem very normal to them <br/>
and very NOT normal to the unschooled kids. There is a petty jabbing <br/>
verbal teasing/insulting way of relating to each other, among most <br/>
teenagers, that seemed to always leave my kids feeling just bewildered <br/>
and a bit hurt, but not really &quot;getting&quot; what was happening and feeling <br/>
oddly a bit left out. Again - can&#39;t generalize to all unschoolers, but <br/>
I&#39;ve seen that with some others, too.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the kind of not fitting in that was meant? I&#39;m not sure.<br/>

<br/>
I was schooled, but I mostly felt the way that your teens felt, in that <br/>
not having had much television as a child, I was always missing the key <br/>
points of conversations, or not understanding the sexual inuendo, not <br/>
getting the jokes, didn&#39;t listen to popular music so had no idea what <br/>
was going on most of the time. <br/>
<br/>
Can we explore this further?  Do other&#39;s feel their unschooled teenagers <br/>
also experience this?  Is it just dependent on personality type?  Or <br/>
does it have something in particular to do with being unschooled/schooled? <br/>
<br/>
I think this is sort of the fear that many non-homeschoolers, or <br/>
anti-homeschoolers, are voicing when they say that children not schooled <br/>
will not be &#39;socialized&#39;.   And the  stock homeschool answer is to give <br/>
all the examples of opportunities to socialize with all different types <br/>
of people that exist for homeschoolers that schoolers generally miss.  <br/>
But its sort of side-stepping the question.  Is the problem the value <br/>
that is being given to that particular type of socialization?  Or is <br/>
there really something missing from the homeschooler&#39;s socialization?</div>

<br/>
How do you feel about not having the cultural exposure to be in on  <br/>
jokes and popular music?<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend in college who grew up in the 1960&#39;s without hearing  <br/>
any new music, only listening to Gilbert & Sullivan and other eighty- <br/>
year-old stuff, because his parents thought those were classic and  <br/>
educational.  He also knew nothing at all about the Bible or any Bible  <br/>
stories, and as a literature major he was extremely inconvenienced by  <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m repeating that paragraph because now I&#39;m going further into it:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My kids only miss the traditional schoolyard taunts, as to their  <br/>

  &quot;There is a petty jabbing<br/>
  verbal teasing/insulting way of relating to each other, among most<br/>
  teenagers, that seemed to always leave my kids feeling just bewildered<br/>
  and a bit hurt, but not really &quot;getting&quot; what was happening and feeling<br/>
  oddly a bit left out. Again - can&#39;t generalize to all unschoolers, but<br/>
  I&#39;ve seen that with some others, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  *****************<br/>
  I was schooled, but I mostly felt the way that your teens felt, in that <br/>
<br/>
  Can we explore this further? Do other&#39;s feel their unschooled teenagers <br/>
  also experience this? Is it just dependent on personality type? Or <br/>
  does it have something in particular to do with being unschooled/schooled? <br/>
<br/>
  I think this is sort of the fear that many non-homeschoolers, or <br/>
  anti-homeschoolers, are voicing when they say that children not schooled <br/>
  will not be &#39;socialized&#39;. And the stock homeschool answer is to give <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  i  don&#39;t read the above as being an indigtment of unschoolers/home schoolers socialization or lack thereof.  i read it as being a lack of indoctrination into the cruelty aspects of popular/schooled culture, and that &quot;ribbing&quot; feeling foreign is a GOOD thing.  my daughter was schooled until age 13, and now, at nearly 15 she is still blown away by the kindness that is inherent in unschooling groups of teens.  she is in HEAVEN with that milieu.  she was always very sensitive socially and deeply hurt by what others may have perceived to be very minor &quot;normal&quot; kid culture type interactions.  and she was in school!<br/>
<br/>
  i was also schooled, but was raised without T.V. and with hippy alternative parents who didn&#39;t know the first thing about popular culture, music, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
  i got along ok in schooler, without that knowledge, until i was 9 and i moved to the city from a small country town, and all of a sudden i knew NOTHING.  all the kids ever talked about was movies and t.v. shows and music and stuff that i was clueless about.  so - i was schooled but &quot;unsocialized&quot; in those things.  <br/>
<br/>
  if a child is unschooling, they have less of a need to be fluent in the cultural media &quot;language&quot; because there is a variety of other fellow unschoolers, some of whom also have no interest in that and many/most of whom are accepting of each other even if they differ in cultural fluency.  that  said, i think the &quot;fluency&quot; and familiarity with cultural/popular media and language is a natural result from the freedom and access around media for most unschoolers, to what ever extent they are interested in such fluency, and those who aren&#39;t probably wouldn&#39;t be if they were in school either, but they would just suffer from that lack more.  <br/>

<br/>
I agree with that, but if a child is unschooling and hanging around  <br/>
with a small group of other friends, they WILL have common interests  <br/>
and experiences, either of what they&#39;ve played or built or who else  <br/>
they&#39;ve known and played with, to outings the families have been on,  <br/>
and if when the kids are older they find other connections through  <br/>
sports or dance or anime or WoW, they&#39;ll have those things in common.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-526133933">*How do you feel about not having the cultural exposure to be in on<br/>
jokes and popular music?*<br/>
<br/>
Well, I felt left out.  I never was so interested in those things, or at <br/>
least some of them.  Ok.  The television was my parents... there were <br/>
times where we didn&#39;t have cable, just antenna.  And then there was when <br/>
my siblings got older and started to fight about who got to watch what, <br/>
and they TV was just taken away for periods of time.  I remember <br/>
watching Murder She Wrote through the stair rails when my parents <br/>
thought I was asleep.  That is not what I want to reproduce with my kids! <br/>
<br/>
But music is different.  I just wasn&#39;t interested in it.  I loved what <br/>
my parents played... and they played what they loved.  They weren&#39;t <br/>
attempting to limit us.  I just never had any urge to seek out anything <br/>
different (different from Simon and Garfunkle, Peter Paul and Mary, <br/>
etc).   So I guess that was my own doing.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t understand a lot of the sexual jokes that go around... I <br/>
guess I&#39;m just that way, even being married and having two kids.  Just <br/>
personality. So, also not to do with schooling. <br/>
<br/>
*My kids only miss the traditional schoolyard taunts, as to their<br/>
understanding. Because my kids know current music (And &#39;60&#39;s, AND a<br/>
lot of Gilbert & Sullivan &lt;g&gt;), they aren&#39;t baffled by conversation.<br/>
They don&#39;t have stories about lockers or school counsellors or PE<br/>
classes, but they&#39;re natives of the culture around them.*<br/>
<br/>
So, the stories about lockers, school, gym class... kids taunting, being <br/>
mean.  Do they just not care about those things?  Do they not encounter <br/>
those things, since they are mostly found in school-grounds?  Do they <br/>
know how to deal with them? <br/>
<br/>
But I guess it doesn&#39;t even matter, because there are schooled kids who <br/>
don&#39;t do anything about being taunted, and there are those that have <br/>
great come-backs.   Maybe its more about personality than about school <br/>
or no school.<br/>
<br/>
*There is no monolithic &quot;the homeschooler&quot; about whom we can make these<br/>

<br/>
Ok, I should have described the homeschoolers I had in mind.  I was <br/>
thinking of the average middle-of the road homeschoolers.  I know <br/>
generalizations can&#39;t be made.  I was thinking of anyone who is exposed <br/>
to all the same kinds of things learned in school (with or without <br/>
formal learning, curriculum, etc...), but not exposed to the <br/>
socialization particular to school.</div>

<br/>
When they were kids they would look at me and shrug, about the taunts,  <br/>
and I would sometimes (especially if it was at our house) tell the kid  <br/>
that I know kids at school say things like that, but they weren&#39;t at  <br/>
school, and my kids weren&#39;t school kids and for them to be nicer.<br/>
<br/>
Calmly.  Matter of factly.  Our back yard was the place to be for  <br/>
seven or so families of kids when my kids were little (just neighbors,  <br/>
I mean, in addition to the La Leche League babysitting co-op friends),  <br/>
so kids WOULD be nice to continue to get to come over.<br/>
<br/>
As to school and lockers and teachers, Kirby had a karate teacher,  <br/>
Marty had a skating teacher and Holly had a dance teacher, so they had  <br/>
something to add, a little bit, but they mostly said &quot;What do you  <br/>
mean?&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t go to school,&quot; and that was that.<br/>

Me too.  That would be my kids.<br/>
<br/>
But when people outside of homeschooling talk about that, they&#39;re  <br/>
usually thinking of the isolated fundamentalist unschoolers I was  <br/>
talking about, whose parents are keeping them home because they want  <br/>
them to know less.<br/>
<br/>
I kept my kids home so they could know lots and lots MORE.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a fair statement.  Unschooled kids and homeschooled kids in general won&#39;t be socialized in the same way that schooled kids are.<br/>
<br/>
There is a local homeschool dad that I used to have a quote from, on a long ago computer that was long ago put out of commission, but it went something like, and I&#39;m only paraphrasing what I remember... &quot;If I wanted my kids socialized like what happens in schools, I&#39;d pee on his shoes in the bathroom, steal his lunch money, tease him, bully him, and send him away crying.&quot;  His child had experienced all of those socialization things in school and it was the reason they had pulled him out of school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m GLAD my kids recognize the cruelty of other kids and don&#39;t feel they must tolerate it.  I&#39;m GLAD they know it&#39;s a choice to put up with the nonsense that &quot;schooled&quot; kids spew out.  There is a lot of head games and manipulation that happens in school social circles.  It&#39;s very unnatural and definitely a direct outcome of being forced into unnatural social situations that schools produce.<br/>

<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have thusfar found ways to avoid people they don&#39;t like, and  <br/>
when they do take a job, to make themselves so useful and likable that  <br/>
it&#39;s not torture.   When they&#39;re done, they quit.  Pretty much, they  <br/>
have quit with bosses asking them please not to quit.  Sometimes they  <br/>
stayed a while longer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I have been told that many times.  People worried about how Richard would learn to deal with people that he had problems with. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I went to preschool, elementary school, a 2 year jr. high school, a 2 year mid-high school, 2 year high school, and college, and I STILL have a hard time with mean two-faced bosses, co-workers, others.  All that school didn&#39;t help me any.  I just don&#39;t deal with it well, I don&#39;t understand it.  I will think of some smart thing that I could have said during a discussion/confrontation hours or days later.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Richard, who has never been to school, deals with it much better than I.  He hasn&#39;t endured the school-yard taunts, but most of his friends are school kids, all of his in town friends are.  He goes to TaeKwonDo, he plays on Xbox live, he interacts with school kids almost every day.  He just has more interpersonal intellegence than I do I guess.  He doesn&#39;t get his feelings hurt easily and he doesn&#39;t take hours to think of something to say.  School didn&#39;t help him with that.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope--not since we stopped having the t.v. restricted.  :-)  Before that, when the kids were younger, my son was in some theater classes.  A majority of the warm-up ice breaker games they played were based on popular t.v. characters.  When my son would come home complaining about that to me, my first strategy was to talk with the teachers to see if they could play games NOT based around pop culture like that.  Although they sympathized, nothing really changed.  <br/>
<br/>
The same thing came up around the same time, when he was looking for more friends, and all the boys we met were into video games.  I thought it was enough that he could play when he was with them.  But his skills were so lacking that he felt bad.  Not long after these experiences, we dropped all the limits around media, because I could see that he was actually socially handicapped.  It stopped making sense to me that I was raising him to not be able to function in his world.<br/>
<br/>
Since then he has &quot;caught up&quot; with his peers.  I&#39;d say he gets all the references that his schooled counterparts do, but without the meanness.<br/>
<br/>
I think media is where most of the common culture comes from--not school.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that I remember moving the same year that Mork and Mindy came out.  We moved out to a house that didn&#39;t have t.v. for about 6 months.  EVERYONE at my new school was watching that show (or so it seemed) but me, and I felt really left out.<br/>
