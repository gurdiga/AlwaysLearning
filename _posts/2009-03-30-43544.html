All of that information was pulled from a place you can all see too:<br/>

As list owner, I much prefer quality over quantity.  I&#39;m not trying  <br/>
for volume.  I&#39;m trying to provide learning here so that participants  <br/>
can facilitate rich, fun learning lives for their families when  <br/>
they&#39;re not on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Posts for this list need to fulfill at least one of these criteria:<br/>
<br/>
helps lots of people understand unschooling<br/>
asks a question that actually needs an answer<br/>
requests help seeing different aspects of a situation<br/>
helps people have more peaceful and joyful lives (helps lots of people  <br/>
on the list)<br/>
<br/>
ALL posts should be<br/>
<br/>
honest<br/>
proofread<br/>
sincere<br/>
clear<br/>
<br/>
NO posts should be<br/>
<br/>
just a &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;me too&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;LOL&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With over a thousand people we don&#39;t need greetings and good-byes.  Be  <br/>
here or don&#39;t be here, and save posting for important messages to  <br/>
hundreds of people.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to even consider what people are offering as  <br/>
suggestions, keep that to yourself.  THINK about what you&#39;ve read.   <br/>
Think privately, and not in a post that hundreds of people will need  <br/>
to read or ignore.  Only post important, useful, honest things.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
