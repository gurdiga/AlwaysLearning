Kerin, I thought your post was in secret code, so I put it in Word and tried <br/>
changing fonts, but it&#39;s still symbol-craziness.  Please try again.<br/>
<br/>
Or if that was posted by your monkey or your cat, Right on!  Good job!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81902608">One of my kids did that for fun one day.  They wrote in one of those funny specialty fonts and then asked me if I could read it.  It took me a minute to think about changing the fonts but I did eventually.  It was a fun idea of a way to send secret messages.  Before I read your message Sandra, I tried to change the font too, to see what it said.  :-)<br/>
