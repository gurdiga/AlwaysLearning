<br/>
I am sure that there will be others who can answer much better than I  <br/>
but I can still share what I&#39;ve been doing this year.  We have a  <br/>
framework as well - I live in Pennsylvania which by the way if there  <br/>
are other PA people on the list I&#39;d love to hear from you!!!  Anyway,  <br/>
we have a framework although IMO I think our framework is fairly  <br/>
lose.  In other words there&#39;s room for &quot;play&quot;.  I have been keeping a  <br/>
daily list of things DS does that can be plugged into the different  <br/>
subjects.  I don&#39;t list the subjects.  I just list what he does  <br/>
throughout the day.  So when it&#39;s time for &quot;reporting&quot; I will go  <br/>
through this list and create a report or what we call a portfolio.   <br/>
Learning to think outside the box has been very helpful in dealing  <br/>
with our homeschool requirements.  I also think in terms of 7 days a  <br/>
week not just Mon-Fri ... after all learning does happen 24/7.   <br/>
Again, I just observe what he&#39;s doing and jot it down.  There will  <br/>
also be days that I miss so it&#39;s not a strict regimen either.   I  <br/>
know there will be plenty of things at the end of the year to  <br/>
&quot;report&quot; on.  Hope this makes sense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Luna<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Canberra. I have a son, now 12, at home with me who went to<br/>
school for two years. My wife and I took him out of school in December<br/>
2002 at his request.<br/>
<br/>
During the &#39;school summer holiday&#39; that followed, we put together with<br/>
him a very informal, no need to sit at a desk, maximum three hours a<br/>
day timetable of weekly &#39;lessons&#39; that he said he was happy with.<br/>
Subject based - from memory, English, Mathematics, Science, Geography,<br/>
History - not tied to a particular curriculum or syllabus.<br/>
<br/>
In February 2003 (the start of the new school year), I wrote to the<br/>
principal of the school officially confirming that my son wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
returning to school and would be educated at home. I wrote to the<br/>
Department of Schools and asked them to send me the registration<br/>
package so that I could register my son as home educated. I received<br/>
the package. I read through the forms. I decided that it was<br/>
impossible for me to adequately convey my educational philosophy in<br/>
the terms that they required and chucked the forms in the bin. I&#39;ve<br/>
had no further contact with the Department of Schools.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s &#39;lessons&#39; lasted about two weeks. And even in that time, I<br/>
don&#39;t think we ever spent more than an hour on them before he decided<br/>
to &#39;take the rest of the day off&#39;. Though he&#39;d agreed to the idea, in<br/>
practice he didn&#39;t like it. If he didn&#39;t like it, nor did I. My wife<br/>
and I had taken our son out of a situation that had made him unhappy<br/>
because we wanted him to be happy, so we sure as heck weren&#39;t going to<br/>
put him into another situation that made him unhappy. From that moment<br/>
on, my son has simply done what he likes. Mostly, that has been<br/>
playing videogames, watching TV and surfing the internet. (I do a lot<br/>
of that with him too!)<br/>
<br/>
In his second year at school, my son had been in the remedial reading<br/>
class because his reading had fallen behind. I was a parent helper in<br/>
the reading program (I was inside his school in some way practically<br/>
every day) and he was constantly being compelled to read silly little<br/>
stories about nothing he was even remotely interested in, so perhaps<br/>
that wasn&#39;t totally unrelated. When my son came out of school, he<br/>
refused to even look at a book and, to this day, he won&#39;t read one. By<br/>
the end of his first year at home, however, without any reading<br/>
lessons whatsoever, my son&#39;s reading was excellent. He&#39;d dramatically<br/>
improved his reading from his everyday interactions with videogaming<br/>
instructions and online walkthroughs - stuff *he* knew he had to be<br/>
able to read to achieve his gaming objectives. Interestingly, the<br/>
number of times he asked me to identify a specific word for him was<br/>
probably in single digits. He really did figure virtually all of it<br/>
out for himself.<br/>
<br/>
There have been many such revelations. The (positive) difference<br/>
between what my 12 year old son knows about the world he lives in and<br/>
what I knew about the world I lived in when I was 12 (which would be<br/>
1964, btw) is  truly awesome. I have no doubt whatsoever that he&#39;s<br/>
well educated.<br/>
<br/>
Yet he doesn&#39;t know - or, at least, he&#39;s unable to recite - the months<br/>
of the year. Is that important? Perhaps a school teacher would be<br/>
appalled! Well, we have calendars around the house if he needs to<br/>
check; I listed the months on a sheet of paper and bluetacked it to<br/>
his bedroom wall for reference if he wants to glance at it every so<br/>
often. I know that if he decides one day that he really *needs* to be<br/>
able to recite the months of the year in order, he can permanently<br/>
memorise the sequence in less than half an hour. He didn&#39;t learn to<br/>
tie his shoelaces until he was nine. I used to say to him, &quot;Pat, one<br/>
day you&#39;ll wake up in the morning not knowing how to tie your<br/>
shoelaces and you&#39;ll go to bed that night knowing how to tie your<br/>
shoelaces. It really is that simple.&quot; One day he asked me to show him<br/>
how. So I showed him and he said, &quot;I can&#39;t see clearly what you&#39;re<br/>
doing&quot;; so I drew a set of six diagrams - very rough drawings of my<br/>
actions. By following the diagrams, he tied his shoelaces, practised a<br/>
few times to be sure and that was it. Skill acquired.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing what children learn when they don&#39;t have education forced<br/>
on them. We all naturally want to be successful in our lives, so why<br/>
would they be an exception to that as many people seem to believe?<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who&#39;s ten years older than her brother. She was<br/>
always formally educated in the school system and just graduated from<br/>
university this year. Before she started school, she lived exactly as<br/>
her brother lives now - she did whatever she liked. After she started<br/>
school, that became a part-time lifestyle for when she was at home. In<br/>
school, she was a &quot;star pupil&quot; from day one, throughout her school<br/>
years always amongst what Robert Kiyosaki calls &quot;the favored five per<br/>
cent&quot; - those students who are specially cared for because their<br/>
achievements bring credit to the school. I&#39;m very grateful for that.<br/>
It enabled my daughter to successfully accommodate the less than life<br/>
enhancing aspects of school culture. The incredible self-motivation on<br/>
which her success at school was based didn&#39;t come from the school<br/>
system though. It came from parents who honoured her self-authority.<br/>
<br/>
No different in the case of our son, except that it&#39;s resulted in him<br/>
taking a very different path.<br/>
<br/>
The point in mentioning my experiences with both of my children, I<br/>
think, is because I want to say that, as a parent, I believe my<br/>
allegiance must be to the development of my children as human beings<br/>
NOT to somebody else&#39;s ideas about how they would best fit into society.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I get a little emotional these days when I read of &#39;home<br/>
educating&#39; parents who allow themselves to be pulled around by<br/>
supposed &#39;educational authorities&#39;. That&#39;s because I know from my own<br/>
experiences over eight years on the internet - and especially since<br/>
the advent of Web 2.0 - that we&#39;re now in a golden age of<br/>
self-motivated learning that gifts today&#39;s growing children the power<br/>
to create (should they choose to do so) an education of their own<br/>
that&#39;s superior to anything any Department of Schools wants for them;<br/>
and because I&#39;ve spent the past five years observing the phenomenal<br/>
difference between my son&#39;s self-determined &#39;learning at the speed of<br/>
thought&#39; lifestyle and the learning at the speed of watching paint dry<br/>
experiences he went through at school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just some random neural firings in response to your post.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375237828">Linnaea got a pair of heelys for her birthday and has really been amazing to watch as she&#39;s moved from stumbling and wobbling to rolling about the house doing turns and fast stops. But one thing she wanted to be able to do was tie them. I took maybe 30 seconds to show her how David ties his shoes, two rabbit ears tied in a granny knot, and that was it. She knows how to tie shoes. <br/>
<br/>
It is thrilling to watch how the little things that can loom in your brain &quot;How will they ever know how to tie their shoes if I don&#39;t teach them?!!&quot; can disappear in an instant of real desire to know. <br/>

what you said makes a lot of sense to us.We ...even before we thought of unschooling....worked weekends too.I though that it was better to do a little each day then to do a lot at once....that ws then now i am learning to let them do what they would like to for the day...yes at the moment its a lot of tv and playstation but after reading about this on Sandras website i am sure that when they are ready they will move on.I will write down what they do each day...I was when they were doing all the book work.Its just learning to see outside the box and working out what is suitable for our portfolio at the end of the year.<br/>
We live in Adelaide south australia so a little too far from PA.<br/>
One more question...I have started letting the kids stay up as long as they &quot;need &quot; at night.No biggie here but my 5 yr old gets tired so easy even on a good nights sleep.Now she is getting up for hours over night...again no biggie.Actually i have been enjoying being able to chat about all kinds of things.....the thing is that she is too tired to cope during the day and finds it hard to rest long enough to fall asleep and is getting angry and just well so tired during the day....anyone have advice about what we could do to help her?<br/>

Hi Luna!<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that there will be others who can answer much better than I <br/>
but I can still share what I&#39;ve been doing this year. We have a <br/>
framework as well - I live in Pennsylvania which by the way if there <br/>
are other PA people on the list I&#39;d love to hear from you!!! Anyway, <br/>
we have a framework although IMO I think our framework is fairly <br/>
lose. In other words there&#39;s room for &quot;play&quot;. I have been keeping a <br/>
daily list of things DS does that can be plugged into the different <br/>
subjects. I don&#39;t list the subjects. I just list what he does <br/>
throughout the day. So when it&#39;s time for &quot;reporting&quot; I will go <br/>
through this list and create a report or what we call a portfolio. <br/>
Learning to think outside the box has been very helpful in dealing <br/>
with our homeschool requirements. I also think in terms of 7 days a <br/>
week not just Mon-Fri ... after all learning does happen 24/7. <br/>
Again, I just observe what he&#39;s doing and jot it down. There will <br/>
also be days that I miss so it&#39;s not a strict regimen either. I <br/>
know there will be plenty of things at the end of the year to <br/>
&quot;report&quot; on. Hope this makes sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255397035">Hello Bob,<br/>
 thankyou for telling me some of your story.  I find reading through what you have said inspiring.There are stories everywhere about kifds who learn more out of school then when they are in there.I am beginning to see why.Slowly gaining an understanding.I am not sure what the procedure is like in canberra when it comes to getting exemption but here you fill out the form each year then have an interview each year.I think unschooling will work best for us.In regaurds to reading our eldest was reading at a grade 2 level in recption then when we moved schools she was pulled back to reception level.Now she hates it.We go to the libary and gets books but if she dosnt like them they go back.Sometimes she just looks at the pictures.She is only interested in animals at the moment which is fine:)Just not sure how to tell her she isnt getting a horse yet!Our 5 year old likes us to read to her and we like that too....castles at the<br/>
 moment...and knights!She sits and writes out words....we dont ask her she just does it.I figure this is where she is at the moment and if she was at school she wouldnt be able to follow this as she sees she needs....it would be what the school says she needs to be doing.My DH says as long as they can read and write and are happy thats all he wants for them.I am sutre they will...we read all the time and are on the net.The girls love the computer games like ps2...which the eldest nicked of me a few years ago!Shes getting good with games now and we often play together as i find them fun too....Dh is still a little miffed by them LOL.I have been a little unsure of her using the net but am slowley getting there...its not her i dont trust but some of the other people out there.Both the older ones prefer to find things on the net then in books most times..I think its faster then books which they need to wait till we can get to the libary for.Last night my<br/>
 eldest wanted to know what stupendous meant...2 minutes later she had her answer.When they are really little sometimes interest can wane when they have to wait too long....has anyone else found that?Today i was talking to my husband and i asked him how much he remembered of what he was taught in school?He said not that much....we agreed it was most likely as he had no interest in the topic.I was the same....i still remember asking my social studies teacher if we could do american histoty as it really interested me but he said only if we get time...which of course we didnt.Still that year i read Bury my heart at wounded knee...and you know i remember more about that book than my SS lessons LOL.I think all kids are the same:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228801572">I am sure that is what Zini is doing...also she dosnt like to be in bed if someone else is up..(that was her older sister who is unwell too)...Once she realises things are changing then it should be easier on her.We know about the glut:)My girls got so many eggs for easter of us and 4 grandparents and as we are not rationing them out like we normally would they are going nuts LOL.They are not used to yes to things ;like can we have an egg!I figure they will stop eating if they dont feel well and eventually they might feel secure enough to not need it several times a day...maybe:)<br/>
We will try the music with Zini...i have a Cd here called songs for the inner child that is full of lullabys and traditional songs.She used to go to sleep with meditation music and i sang these songs on this cd to her when she was a baby before bed(wonder if that will register on her subconsious?)<br/>
Macy has gone to bed with a DVD on for the last almost 4 years.She was diagnosed &quot;ADHD&quot; but now is almost completly drug free and better for it.She cant sleep without her movies on.We got some weird looks and comments back then about letting her have movies at night and during the night when she got up.....apparently we were giving into her!We just thought we were getting her to a state wjhere she wasnt worked up[ and could relax to sleep and in turn getting ourselves to sleep too.Zini dosnt winddown with visual stimulation but with audio that might be a lot doifferent.I am now prepared if she gets up in the next hour or so:)<br/>
With food she has always helped herself to what she wants in the fridge...even before we decided to relax the rules...she would just go and get what sahe wanted LOL.They always eat when they want...its immportant.Even adults get cranky when they are hungry.Today was definatly tired as she had about 4 hours i guess before she was up four hours thenonly slept another 3 over night...she normally sleeps almost 11 hours a night.She did eventually fall asleep for about 1 1/2 hours in the lounge today which i think she needed...she asked for the fold out bed and lied down to eventually sleep.<br/>
Thanks for your help again,<br/>

Sometimes I make a mental check list of things to look at or find and<br/>
answer the question or interest as best I can in the moment.  When I<br/>
keep that check list running in my head, I can keep my eyes and ears<br/>
open for other things to give my kids.  Sometimes they are still<br/>
interested and sometimes not, but when they are, they are so awesomely<br/>
surprised that I&#39;ve brought them something that I remember from days,<br/>
weeks, or months ago.  They&#39;ll say something like &quot;hey remember the<br/>
other day we were just talking about that&quot; or something like that. <br/>
Sometimes I tell them that I planned it and remembered and sometimes I<br/>
let it feel like magic.<br/>

The internet is great for that, but my youngest isn&#39;t as interested in<br/>

I havnt come across WoW...Is that one which is on the computer/internet?At the moment Macy loves to play the crash bandicoot games.She has been so excited when she has got through some of the harder levels on her own lately and got gems from some of those harder levels.She is only 8 and its only recently she has wanted to play the PS2 on her own for hours...but she likes us to watch and comes and tells us all the exciting news when something new happens.I thinkit would be good for you to learn to play WoW.It would be another way to spend time with your son and you might actually find you enjoy doing it too:)You could challenge each other or work with teamwork depending on how the game is played.We usually go one life and you swap over....depends on how WoW works as to how you could play it!Like you i think i will need to look at what the &quot;educational value&quot; acording to the government of each activite is for the portfolio at the end of the year.Its hard<br/>
 to pigeon hole some of their activities but with a bit of paractice I am sure it wont be too bad!<br/>

&gt; Hi Luna!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am sure that there will be others who can answer much better than I<br/>
&gt; but I can still share what I&#39;ve been doing this year. We have a<br/>
&gt; framework as well - I live in Pennsylvania which by the way if there<br/>
&gt; are other PA people on the list I&#39;d love to hear from you!!! Anyway,<br/>
&gt; we have a framework although IMO I think our framework is fairly<br/>
&gt; lose. In other words there&#39;s room for &quot;play&quot;. I have been keeping a<br/>
&gt; daily list of things DS does that can be plugged into the different<br/>
&gt; subjects. I don&#39;t list the subjects. I just list what he does<br/>
&gt; throughout the day. So when it&#39;s time for &quot;reporting&quot; I will go<br/>
&gt; through this list and create a report or what we call a portfolio.<br/>
&gt; Learning to think outside the box has been very helpful in dealing<br/>
&gt; with our homeschool requirements. I also think in terms of 7 days a<br/>
&gt; week not just Mon-Fri ... after all learning does happen 24/7.<br/>
&gt; Again, I just observe what he&#39;s doing and jot it down. There will<br/>
&gt; also be days that I miss so it&#39;s not a strict regimen either. I<br/>
&gt; know there will be plenty of things at the end of the year to<br/>
&gt; &quot;report&quot; on. Hope this makes sense.<br/>

You DO see  her that way.<br/>

So please don&#39;t tell us it&#39;s not something you see.  It&#39;s something  <br/>
you *SHARE* about her.<br/>

<br/>
I  don&#39;t where or how you grew up, but in my experience (primary and  <br/>
secondary) most children have no possible way to eat when they need  <br/>
to.  They eat on a schedule, with food that&#39;s chosen by others, and  <br/>
they&#39;re often pressed to finish it all on some threat of punishment  <br/>
or deprivation.   And children do NOT sleep when they need, in most  <br/>
situations.  They are put to bed &quot;at bedtime,&quot; woken up harshly, and  <br/>
are in trouble if they fall asleep in class.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read that book too! I love reading about the &#39;Wild West&#39; - and<br/>
watching Westerns on TV and at the movies. Ever since I was about nine<br/>
or ten when my family got our first TV. The first TV show I ever<br/>
watched in my life was an episode of The Cisco Kid. Then there were<br/>
all the others - Bonanza, Maverick, Have Gun Will Travel, Rifleman,<br/>
Laramie, Lone Ranger, Bronco, Range Rider, Wagon Train, Rawhide, High<br/>
Chaparral ...<br/>
<br/>
Then, as I grew up I became interested in the real life history of the<br/>
Wild West, the true stories (or true-ish, depending on who was telling<br/>
the story!). And no chance of any of that finding its way into my<br/>
school classroom either. British history was it.<br/>
<br/>
Not so long ago, I spent a very informative half an hour or so with my<br/>
son at the official Texas Rangers website (the law enforcement agency<br/>
not the baseball club) because we had been discussing the design of<br/>
the weapons in the shoot &#39;em up videogames he likes to play - and<br/>
which guns are real guns and which are made up - and I&#39;d mentioned<br/>
that I loved the design of the Colt 1851 Navy pistol (as used by Clint<br/>
Eastwood in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly which we&#39;d watched not long<br/>
before), so I googled it, found a page at the Texas Rangers site and<br/>
we stayed to have a look around.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly afterwards, I watched Kevin Costner&#39;s Wyatt Earp movie. I was<br/>
curious about how historically accurate the movie was and that led me<br/>
to &#39;The Old West&#39; at a website called Legends of America<br/>
(www.legendsofamerica.com) - &quot;Travel, History, Old West, Route 66,<br/>
Ghost Towns, Treasure Tales & More!&quot; I spent almost three hours there<br/>
the day I found it and still visit from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
Another time, a couple of years ago, I watched the Second World War<br/>
movie The Battle of the Bulge. I was pretty sure some liberties had<br/>
been taken with the story, so I googled it and found a website - don&#39;t<br/>
recall now what it was called - that had been created by some guy in<br/>
America who had actually been there. It included a critique of the<br/>
Battle of the Bulge movie that told me everything I needed to know<br/>
about the (numerous) discrepancies between the dramatised account and<br/>
the actual events. And there was a whole lot more. The website was a<br/>
huge, huge collection of real life stories, photos and maps related to<br/>
the battle that this guy had painstakingly put together over the space<br/>
of years. I was so moved by it, I emailed the guy to thank him for all<br/>
his work.<br/>
<br/>
I love all that. The internet is a dream come true for people of my<br/>
generation (I&#39;m a &#39;child of the 1950s&#39;) - for those of us who wanted<br/>
to know but had no way of knowing. I&#39;ve never been better educated in<br/>
my life than I have been over the past eight years. And the best<br/>
thing of all is that I get to choose what&#39;s important to me and what<br/>
isn&#39;t. That&#39;s priceless.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027539847">hello Sandra,<br/>
I just wanted to clarify a few things.Firstly when i say almost drug free in re to catapres that is beacause you can not take a child straight off this drug.You remove 1/4 tablet per fortnight as removal of this medication can cause a rise in blood pressure....the dose was 2 tablets...to be completly off this medication will take her 16 weeks...only 2 weeks left and we should be onto 0...this has made a huge difference for us as a family as i feel we can now feel that she will now be able to find her natural cycle.<br/>
Why did i mention this...this hads been the biggest step...even before looking at unschooling...for our family.If you could see the difference you would know why i chose to tell people about something so positive.These changes are exciting...its like seeing a path in the woods after being lost for so long.I guess i mentioned it because these steps are a major change in our lives and in thinking.We are listing to what we feel is right not to what others are telling us we need to belive is right.For us this is huge.<br/>
Here the fridge door is always open and the girls can get fruit and snacks and drinks when they need.Well when they are home.That was a problem when miss 8 was at school though....she could not eat when her body told her she needed to and when she could she didnt eat as she was teased.now she eats....she grazes.As for if they dont like what is on the table well then they are free to tell us and get something else more appealing.Though i did make the mistake of limiting sweets till i began to read your writtings.This is my issue not theirs of course.I am beginning to learn to consiously override the thoughts that i have had since i was a kid when it comes to food.Now something else more appealing means anything they want.It also means when they are hungry...even if its 30 mins before tea is cooked...even if its an hour after tea.(they often eat before bed...always have if they wanted it...)I dont belive kids can go to sleep easily if they are hungry so if<br/>
 they are hungry the eat before bed , my guys also love a milk before bed usually when they are in bed.<br/>
We are not perfect but we are trying our best...every step in the right direction is exciting.I am sorry if i offended anyone it wasnt the intention.<br/>

Cisco and Pancho!  I remember them vaguely.  Same days I was wathing  <br/>

Texas history.  Over, and over, and over.<br/>

I&#39;ve lived in New Mexico since I was six, but we visited relatives.   <br/>
Ignorant, alcoholic relatives on one side, and easy-going non- <br/>
ignorant non-alcoholic but too religious relatives on the other  <br/>
side.  Mamaw had a storm cellar just like the one in The Wizard of  <br/>
Oz.  They had used it many times.  I used to want to play down there  <br/>
every time I went, until they reminded me (every time) there were  <br/>
very likely snakes and spiders.  Oh yeah.<br/>

Wagon Train is the reason I stopped taking piano lessons.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps that&#39;s what&#39;s happened with my local Department of Schools.<br/>
It&#39;s to their advantage to let me slip by. <br/>
<br/>
At the time my son was taken out of school, there was a review of the<br/>
legal requirements for homeschoolers in progress, I recall. Now I<br/>
think of it, I included a reference to that in my letter to the<br/>
Principal of my son&#39;s ex-school, and wrote that I was waiting to find<br/>
out what the registration requirements would be before proceeding.<br/>
Until that time, registration had merely been &#39;encouraged&#39; - that is,<br/>
it was implied that you had to register unless you specifically asked<br/>
what your options were (in which case, you were given the facts). The<br/>
review made registration mandatory. So I heard. I never checked to<br/>
find out for sure. I was anticipating that the Department of Schools<br/>
would get back to me to ask why I hadn&#39;t returned their forms. They<br/>
didn&#39;t. I had no inclination to ask *them* if they wanted the forms<br/>
returned because I couldn&#39;t complete them and, in fact, had thrown<br/>
them away. As time passed and nothing happened and, metaphorically<br/>
speaking, my educational ship sailed off over the horizon to new<br/>
lands, I ended up in a non-relationship with the Department of<br/>
Schools. I suppose it *could* be argued that I&#39;m breaking the law, but<br/>
the D of S doesn&#39;t seem to be in the least bothered by it. When they<br/>
care about it, perhaps I will too. :)<br/>

Even though I grew up in England, I didn&#39;t become an Anglophile myself<br/>

England and fell in love with it. Eye opening times!<br/>

Nobody&#39;s offended. People here will point out what looks <br/>
counterproductive. You can take it or leave it. You&#39;re not here to <br/>
impress us, we figure you&#39;re here to put your thoughts out where more <br/>
experienced unschoolers can help you see &quot;getting cold&quot; and help you <br/>
toward &quot;getting warm.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701596646">-=-The<br/>
review made registration mandatory. So I heard. I never checked to<br/>
find out for sure. I was anticipating that the Department of Schools<br/>
would get back to me to ask why I hadn&#39;t returned their forms. They<br/>
didn&#39;t. I had no inclination to ask *them* if they wanted the forms<br/>
returned because I couldn&#39;t complete them and, in fact, had thrown<br/>
them away. As time passed and nothing happened and, metaphorically<br/>
speaking, my educational ship sailed off over the horizon to new<br/>
lands, I ended up in a non-relationship with the Department of<br/>
Schools. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sounds very familiar.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was eight, in the old days when there were nominal test  <br/>
requirements in New Mexico (three tests, when kids were about 8, 10  <br/>
and 13, later changed to another arbitrary set of years, later  <br/>
dropped) I was still in the state homeschooling group, getting their  <br/>
newsletters, going to their conferences.  Unschoolers were the bright  <br/>
end of the room, but not the majority.  They were more competent, but  <br/>
less driven (and so forth).<br/>
<br/>
A test year came, we were all reminded, a place and date were set, I  <br/>
went to the meeting before where they explain and coach and we sign  <br/>
up.  I signed up.<br/>
<br/>
I went home and realized Kirby wasn&#39;t going to have any fun or do  <br/>
well, therefore it was going to be a big detriment.  He didn&#39;t read  <br/>
well enough to do something like that independently, at eight, and he  <br/>
didn&#39;t like being surrounded by strangers yet (he got to love it  <br/>
later, and to read like any rules lawyer that ever played games with  <br/>
150 page rules books).  So we just ditched.  I drove him sixty miles   <br/>
north  to Santa Fe to have a leisurely stroll and food, so I could  <br/>
honestly say &quot;We were out of town.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t tell him &quot;There was this test, and we&#39;re ditching out.&quot;  We  <br/>
just had a really nice several hours far from home.<br/>
<br/>
I got a letter saying there was a makeup test and if he missed that  <br/>
one he had to have a very good excuse or else.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that scene in Galaxy Quest with the dramatic count-down on  <br/>
the computer?  Very scary.  It gets to 1.  That&#39;s all.  Nothing happens.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
I felt free and invisible!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The reason I wasn&#39;t very worried is that I worked in the public  <br/>
schools.  I know what the scores of tests are used for, and we didn&#39;t  <br/>
need any of it.  And as little as school counsellors use the scores,  <br/>
the MAIN purpose of them is the group averages.  Kirby was going to  <br/>
bring the average down, and and mostly-conservative curriculum-using  <br/>
creationist-teaching leaders of the &quot;everyone has to be tested&quot; were  <br/>
after high scores, not lower, and so I didn&#39;t feel we had let the  <br/>
team down at all, either.<br/>
<br/>
I know that in any school, there are kids who miss the test and then  <br/>
miss the make-up date.  Or they move from one school to another and  <br/>
miss both.   If the child is a likely candidate for extra funding  <br/>
(special ed one way or the other), they might administer it  <br/>
privately.  But if the kid&#39;s an average kid not worth daily cash,  <br/>
it&#39;s probably not worth the time and expense of getting it scored.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to do the testing was to have a psychologist or a  <br/>
certified teacher (lapsed certification was okay with them) proctor/ <br/>
sign off.  So my sister&#39;s kids took theirs at home, she sent them to  <br/>
me, and I signed off on it.  I couldn&#39;t have done my own kids&#39;, just  <br/>
someone else&#39;s.  I told her I wanted nothing to do with it if she  <br/>
really followed the times and the rules.  She didn&#39;t give them  <br/>
answers, but she let them quit when they felt done.  So I was fine to  <br/>
sign it.  She also gave the time-honored advice that if they thought  <br/>
a question was stupid or they were tired of it, just guess or make a  <br/>
pattern on the answer sheet.  The bad thing about the test-at-home  <br/>
option was that the tests were purchased for $35 apiece from Bob  <br/>
Jones University, an odious institution, and mailed back to them for  <br/>
scoring.<br/>
<br/>
The end of very long story I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told.  Very long isn&#39;t  <br/>
unusual.  &quot;Haven&#39;t told&quot; is. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
