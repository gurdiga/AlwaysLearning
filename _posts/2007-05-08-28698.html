<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792102403">I&#39;m guessing Zak&#39;s private life wasn&#39;t going to go over well here.   <br/>
He wrote this, on the side to me:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thanks for your curiosity about my private life, but I was more  <br/>
interested in discussing the issues involved than revealing aspects  <br/>
of my personal situation in a public forum such as this. -=-<br/>
<br/>
He also included some deeply ignorant and insulting commentary about  <br/>
the people on the list, unschooling and the list itself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want to make this point for anyone on the list who wonders:<br/>
<br/>
The only reason people are unschooling in so many parts of the world  <br/>
now is that people were willing to reveal details of their lives, and  <br/>
their honest thoughts and experiences.  John Holt wasn&#39;t reporting on  <br/>
scientific test results.  He was writing what he himself had seen and  <br/>
thought, and taking his ideas into classrooms and friends&#39; homes and  <br/>
public places and trying them out with real, live kids and writing  <br/>
what he saw.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt had no children of his own, but he had the interest and  <br/>
energy to correspond with lots of unschooling families and to collect  <br/>
their writings and send them back.  That became Growing Without  <br/>
Schooling, which was first just basically a newsletter, and became a  <br/>
magazine supported in part by his sales of his own books and some  <br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
Those who wrote to GWS were writing about their private lives, in a  <br/>
public forum.<br/>
<br/>
Those who wrote in the early unschooling discussions at *Prodigy and  <br/>
the AOL forum were writing about their personal situations in a  <br/>
public forum.<br/>
<br/>
Without that, there would be no unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Without that, there would be no earthly purpose for this list, or  <br/>
unschooling.info, or the Unschooling Discussion list, or Unschooling  <br/>
Basics or ANY of the things that have made unschooling a viable,  <br/>
lively possibility.<br/>
<br/>
People can move toward this more directly and quickly and deeply  <br/>
from  knowing what others have discovered and experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Some Zak who teaches education wants to convince people he knows more  <br/>
and cares more than I do (and many others here), but won&#39;t even tell  <br/>
us how old his children are (or if he even has children).  So in his  <br/>
world, having a master&#39;s or PhD equals credentials.  But in this  <br/>
world, having children who are out of school and happy equals  <br/>
credentials.  Sharing in a useful fashion is what&#39;s useful.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce&#39;s collections, my collection, the pages of writings by other  <br/>
unschoolers linked at the bottom of this, the blogs of various  <br/>
unschoolers.... THOSE things make unschooling fluid and alive.  The  <br/>
conferences where people can meet and see other families in action  <br/>
make unschooling whole and real and vibrant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606118743">Aha. The &quot;issues involved&quot;. What is that?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sandra, for making everything clear.<br/>
<br/>
I joined an &#39;alternative parenting&#39; group a couple of years ago and <br/>
there was a thread on the subject of children who are &#39;picky eaters&#39;. <br/>
Mainly commentary on a certain magazine article. I posted a reply in <br/>
which I mentioned some of my son&#39;s interesting tastes in food.<br/>
<br/>
I got an off list email from one of the list owners informing me <br/>
that &quot;we don&#39;t talk about our children&quot; and this was a warning that I <br/>
had &quot;violated&quot; the group&#39;s rules of discussion. Violated? Crikey. <br/>
What kind of word is that to use? So I wrote back informing the lady <br/>
that I was leaving the group anyway. Or words to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel myself that it&#39;s our personal stories - of which our <br/>
children are a part - and our actual experiences of unschooling that <br/>
matter more than analysing unschooling in itself as if we&#39;re back in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more than happy to talk about my private life. Get ready for some <br/>
outrageous revelations. Only kidding.<br/>
<br/>
Or am I? :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s highly doubtful that I would ever have had the ability to <br/>
believe in unschooling or the courage to start had it not been for <br/>
folks revealing how unschooling worked in their personal lives.  Liam <br/>
and I are both *immensely* grateful for the folks who not only shared <br/>
their copious wisdom with us but also allowed us to peep in at their <br/>
lives.  Those glimpses were what sustained me until I had my own good <br/>
experiences to *prove* that unschooling was every great thing I had <br/>
heard it was.  What a wonderful life we live now because of those folks!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you&quot; just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough!<br/>

Love,<br/>
