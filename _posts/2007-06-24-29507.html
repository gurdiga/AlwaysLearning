<div id="ygrps-yiv-572450896">Okay, you creative Unschoolers.do you have any thoughts on this.<br/>
 <br/>
My 5 year old has developed a fascination with fish and we&#39;ve been busy<br/>
following that passion by setting up our own aquarium.  Recently, he has<br/>
decided that he wants to own a lobster.  So far our research hasn&#39;t come<br/>
up with any way to do this - although I did find a great video on<br/>
YouTube of someone feeding their pet lobster.  I tried to engage the guy<br/>
at the pet store about it, but I don&#39;t think he took my son&#39;s<br/>
fascination with crustaceans seriously.  He just said, &quot;No, you can&#39;t<br/>
own lobsters.  It&#39;s illegal.&quot;  When I tried to pursue other options that<br/>
might satisfy my son, he had no ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
So, any thoughts about other crustaceans that might be fun to have?  We<br/>
already have a couple of ghost shrimp which have been fascinating but<br/>
he&#39;d like something bigger and easier to find in the tank. :-)  Other<br/>
types of shrimp maybe?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your thoughts,<br/>

Great website!  I think the tank has to be salt water to have lobsters.<br/>
They sure are cool.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also look into the crawdad suggestion. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
