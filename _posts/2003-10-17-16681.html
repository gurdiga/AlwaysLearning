&quot;Holly&quot; is a pretty rare and memorable name!<br/>

I miss having nearly-two year olds.  When I had them, I couldn&#39;t really <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844933233">Hi, Dawn.  Where in New York do you live?  I live in Endicott, near Binghamton.  I just checked out www.freeinny.org and signed the proclamation.  Thanks for the link!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any kids of my own yet, but my husband and I plan to make sure any kids we have are free to unschool.  I&#39;m a former teacher, but I really don&#39;t know what the regulations are in NY for homeschoolers.  Can you refer me to a place that gives a succinct description?  Is there any way a certified teacher can volunteer to assist homeschoolers in NY (if needed to sign off on paperwork or do &quot;evaluations&quot;)? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Thanks for your support for F.R.E.E. in NY!  I&#39;m in Jamestown, in <br/>
Western NY.  My husband used to live in Endicott when he was very small. <br/>
 His Dad was an IBMer.  We pass through your area at least twice a year <br/>
when going to visit my SIL in the Kingston area.<br/>

about regulations for NY homeschoolers, find a support group local to <br/>
you and more.  They have a few email lists to which you can subscribe <br/>
for support as well.  Check &#39;em out.  I&#39;m on their legislative committee <br/>
as well.  I&#39;m also list mom for <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NYSHomeschool@...">NYSHomeschool@...</a>.  We are <br/>
presently a moderated group due to the onslaught of porn on <br/>
homeschooling lists lately.  You are welcome to join.<br/>
<br/>
NY has a horrible reputation for their treatment of homeschoolers, but <br/>
in most cases districts are not too difficult.  There are a few <br/>
exceptions, but there is plenty of support out there to help you learn <br/>
the finer points of the regulations, probably better than the district <br/>
people know them, to combat any difficulties.  My paperwork takes me <br/>
just a few minutes every quarter.  Of course, it would be even nicer if <br/>
I didn&#39;t have to deal with it at all.  Thus F.R.E.E. in NY.  We are very <br/>
proud to have the support of people like Linda Dobson, John Taylor <br/>
Gatto, Paul Matte & Doris Hohensee.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your support, and don&#39;t hesitate to let me know if I <br/>
can be of help with regards to NY homeschooling.<br/>

You graduated right about the time my dad tried to pull my sister and me out of school (after reading John Holt & others), but then the school system threatened a law suit and he backed down.

OHMYGOSH!  Your father was my 7th grade English teacher!  What a lovely <br/>
man!  I remember him well!  We lived on Fairmount Avenue, right near the <br/>
corner of Hallock & Fairmount, and I went to Fairmount School - before <br/>
they turned it into condos!<br/>
<br/>
The Jamestown district is pretty easy to deal with with regards to <br/>
homeschooling.  They have so many other issues to contend with that they <br/>
really don&#39;t bother us much.  As long as we turn our paperwork in, we <br/>
don&#39;t hear a peep from them.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of your family, is Betty Lou your aunt?  My mother knits with <br/>
her, and I remember her telling me she was a Boerst.<br/>
<br/>
What an incredibly small world!<br/>

How funny, Dawn!  Was your name Bennink when you were in his class?  I&#39;ll ask him if he remembers.  At one point he was doing the open classroom thing at Lincoln, and he told everyone they didn&#39;t have to come to class if they didn&#39;t want to.  (They could lounge around in the comfy area on the other side of the room.)  He only had a few students show up, poor guy.  Was that when you were there?<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s another funny coincidence -- when I was twelve, we moved to Meadow Lane, right around the corner from your old house.  My parents still live there now.  And yes, Aunt Betty Lou is my dad&#39;s sister.  What an unbelievable set of coincidences!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad the Jamestown district is easy to deal with.  Let&#39;s hope it stays that way. :)<br/>

  OHMYGOSH!  Your father was my 7th grade English teacher!  What a lovely <br/>
  man!  I remember him well!  We lived on Fairmount Avenue, right near the <br/>
  corner of Hallock & Fairmount, and I went to Fairmount School - before <br/>
  they turned it into condos!<br/>
<br/>
  The Jamestown district is pretty easy to deal with with regards to <br/>
  homeschooling.  They have so many other issues to contend with that they <br/>
  really don&#39;t bother us much.  As long as we turn our paperwork in, we <br/>
  don&#39;t hear a peep from them.  <br/>
<br/>
  Speaking of your family, is Betty Lou your aunt?  My mother knits with <br/>
  her, and I remember her telling me she was a Boerst.<br/>
<br/>
  What an incredibly small world!<br/>

  &gt; &lt;&lt;Who is your Dad?  I went to Lincoln & the HS.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; My dad is Bill Boerst.  When I was a kid we lived in the Lincoln <br/>
  &gt; district too, on  State St. near Persell.  What neighborhood did you <br/>
  &gt; live in?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; After the threat of the lawsuit from the school system, my parents <br/>
  &gt; thought about moving to Canada, but it didn&#39;t work out.  I think my <br/>
  &gt; dad  continuted to do some volunteer work for Holt & GWS, and then he <br/>
  &gt; started turning his energy toward making the classroom a more <br/>
  &gt; human-friendly place.  Every once in a while I wonder how my life <br/>
  &gt; would be different if they were able to yank me out of school, but I <br/>
  &gt; survived with fighting spirit intact (just took a while to emerge).  <br/>
  &gt; By the time I graduated, homeschooling was an accepted alternative.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; What is the school district in Jamestown like to deal with? <br/>
