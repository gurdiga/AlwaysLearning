&lt;&lt; Ok I am dying here, I KNOW that line, WHAT movie is it from??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is from a book (she wrote somewhat snootily):  The Princess Bride.<br/>
It was made into a very nice, but necessarily less glorious movie, and the <br/>
line is delivered by Mandy Patinkin, who does a great job of being Inigo <br/>
Montoya.<br/>
<br/>
The other famous (and up to that point only famous I know) Inigo is Inigo <br/>
Jones, who was a set designer and architect and artistic engineer in the 17th <br/>
century, associated with Ben Jonson, and a VERY fascinating type of <br/>
participatory theatre called a masque.<br/>
<br/>
Dan Vilter&#39;s turn.  (Or anyone else can take it, too...)<br/>

only problem was that he didn&#39;t have a single song, the whole movie through. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281466442">Hey, does anyone know if  Buttercup&#39;s Baby is ever coming out? Or has it,<br/>
and I missed it?  I read a one chapter exerpt from it a while ago, in the<br/>
back of a copy of PB, and it ended with Fezzik and Waverly both in midair<br/>
after leaping/being thrown off a cliff.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie has seen the movie a zillion times... I&#39;ve decided that certain<br/>
lines in certain books and movies are like secret signs and countersigns<br/>
to unschoolers, we could use them to find each other in crowds...so, I&#39;d<br/>
say, &quot;Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?&quot; and you would reply...?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let me see, if I remember my theatre history... Yep. Inigo was quite the<br/>
theatrical artist. Since I studied design for theatre (not history where I<br/>
got some of my lowest grades), I know of him for his design work, costumes,<br/>
sets, and most of all effects. He just loved those effects. Exploding staffs<br/>
of silk anything, pyrotechnics, reversing costumes, concealed doors and<br/>
traps. I lot of what we see today in magicians acts were originally stylized<br/>
by Inigo way back in the early 1600s. If you look him up in the history<br/>
books I&#39;m sure they would talk about his architecture. I think he was<br/>
architect to the king or someone really important.<br/>
<br/>
These masques started off as a kind of costume ball of ceremonial dances<br/>
that went crazy and eventually was presented at court and in public<br/>
theatres.  The more attention one could gather at a social event the better<br/>
chance at whatever you would have with the court.  So Inigo perfected how to<br/>
get attention. I guess it paid off in his architecture career. He could<br/>
design sets, costumes, and to a small degree-lighting, he wrote many of the<br/>
elaborate masques, directed and even performed in them . You might even call<br/>
him a ......Renaissance Man... &lt;G&gt;<br/>
