&gt;<br/>
&gt; Leaving the state may be extreme, but is IS effective.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have any really useful suggestions for you.  (Sorry)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, I will acknowledge that there ARE some unschoolers &quot;in the<br/>
&gt; closet&quot; and the closet isn&#39;t a very comfortable place to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Betsy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PS  Are you hiding &quot;unschooling&quot; or are you even hiding the fact that<br/>
&gt; you homeschool?  I wasn&#39;t sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Hi Betsy,<br/>
Not hiding the homeschooling, just the unschooling aspects.  It&#39;s hard on<br/>
the kids too because you can&#39;t really avoid talking to grandma on occasion,<br/>
so when they do they get grilled about what they&#39;re learning, what they&#39;ve<br/>
done this week, etc. - often includes a pop quiz... it&#39;s awful.  In between<br/>
I just get chewed for the damage I am causing the kids by not having them in<br/>
public school...<br/>

Some people teach their kids to change the subject when grilling starts.<br/>
 Or, even more bold, to throw a question back at grandma for everyone<br/>
that she asks.  In my book it&#39;s worthwhile to prepare these kinds of<br/>
questions in advance.<br/>

Hi Betsy,<br/>
Definitely an idea or two there... I respect the sass and disrespect.  :)<br/>
Subtle, subversive, yet possibly effective.  I&#39;ll see what  I can do there.<br/>
If nothing else, it improved my attitude for a bit, eh?  hehe.<br/>

This is an old post, but I always meant to respond.  (I&#39;m behind six ways in <br/>
my life this month, but might catch up, someday.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly had one question she had memorized when she was little.  It was <br/>
something like &quot;What&#39;s 133 plus 256&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s 243 times two&quot; or something <br/>
like that.  And she had memorized the answer.  So if anyone said &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
know&quot; she would state the answer and skip away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512832773">I told Dylan he could substitute the words &quot;interested in&quot;  for<br/>
&quot;studying&quot; when people started asking questions.<br/>
So when someone said &quot;What are you studying in school?&quot;   He would<br/>
translate that to mean &quot;What are you interested in?&quot; and then he had all<br/>
kinds of things to tell them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Usually the person asking questions heard considerably more than they<br/>
expected to and quite often made a point of NOT asking the next time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736021980">I think this is a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
My kids are realing _By The Shores of Silver Lake_, one of the Little <br/>
House books. In it, Mary, who is blind, is excited at the prospect of <br/>
going to college. They&#39;ve decided to go to college, and have made a <br/>
college on the top bunk. They go &quot;listen&quot; to (imaginary) lessons in <br/>
various skills. So far, they&#39;ve taken &quot;jumping&quot; &quot;driving a train&quot; <br/>
&quot;punching the tickets&quot; (they love trains), and other skills they think <br/>
will be valuable. After they go to the &quot;listening station&quot; they come <br/>
down and say they&#39;re practicing whatever skill they just <br/>
learned--usually by jumping on the bed, sometimes singing a related song.<br/>
