I always wanted to name a daughter Sierra, having spent so much wonderful <br/>
time in the Sierra Nevada mountains as a child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well you&#39;ll be pleased to know she is named after those very mountains! My dh loves the Sierra Nevada&#39;s, I just liked the idea of naming her something nature oriented. We wanted something of the earth for her first name, and something of the sky/heavens for a middle name...ideally. That name fit both desires.<br/>
Jalen&#39;s name means &quot;calm ocean&quot; (Jalen Kai), but it doesn&#39;t fit him at ALL right now. He does love the ocean at least.<br/>
The other two kids we weren&#39;t so creative with, we just wanted names we weren&#39;t arguing about!<br/>
