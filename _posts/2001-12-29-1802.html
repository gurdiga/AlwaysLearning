<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574228479">Getting Out of the Way <br/>
<br/>
By Naomi Aldort <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are often complimented on our children&#39;s <br/>
behavior and <br/>
demeanor. People think that we discipline them. We don&#39;t. It is <br/>
ourselves we <br/>
discipline. <br/>
<br/>
We meet our children&#39;s needs, provide for their protection, and <br/>
expose them <br/>
to life&#39;s possibilities. We do not, however, meddle in their play, <br/>
their <br/>
learning, their creativity, or any other form of growth. We love, <br/>
hug, feed, <br/>
share, listen, respond, and participate when asked. Yet, we keep <br/>
our <br/>
children free of insult and manipulation resulting from &quot;helpful&quot; <br/>
comments <br/>
and ideas - influences to which children are so sensitive in their <br/>
state of <br/>
dependency. <br/>
<br/>
Parental Self-Discipline <br/>
<br/>
This type of discipline is not easy. Not only does our society not <br/>
support <br/>
it, but the temptation to break the &quot;rules&quot; lives within us. The drive <br/>
to <br/>
intervene in children&#39;s activities is rooted in our upbringing and <br/>
reinforced in our culture. <br/>
<br/>
For me, the most difficult challenge to overcome has been a <br/>
narcissistic <br/>
impulse to show off my children. One day, when our oldest child <br/>
was two <br/>
years old, he played a smooth scale on the piano. I was amazed, <br/>
yet held <br/>
fast to my rule and stayed out of his way. Free to play out of his <br/>
own love <br/>
and interest, and not to gratify me, he went on improving his <br/>
scale with <br/>
tremendous joy and concentration for quite some time. Not until <br/>
my husband <br/>
came home did I fall into the trap. Unable to wait for a repeat <br/>
performance <br/>
in its own time, I covertly tried to direct our son to the piano to do <br/>
his <br/>
&quot;trick.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Untrained in doing for the sake of pleasing, he was not fooled. <br/>
He sensed <br/>
the hoax and refused to play. Several weeks passed before he <br/>
again immersed <br/>
himself in the scale. This child loves to do things for others, <br/>
enjoys <br/>
helping and serving; yet, when he does something out of self-<br/>
interest, that <br/>
is how it must remain. <br/>
<br/>
Although the self-discipline required of a parent is often <br/>
challenging, it <br/>
becomes second nature with time and experience. For me, this <br/>
type of <br/>
discipline developed gradually, beginning with &quot;descriptive <br/>
acknowledgment&quot;1 <br/>
and culminating in unadulterated staying-out-of-the-way a few <br/>
years later. <br/>
My best allies have been my realizations as a mother and <br/>
educator, Daniel <br/>
Greenberg&#39;s book Free at Last, and discussions with Jean <br/>
Liedloff, author of <br/>
The Continuum Concept, about letting children be themselves. <br/>
<br/>
At first, I thought that commenting, acknowledging, and praising <br/>
children <br/>
for their achievements express love and build self-esteem. In <br/>
time, I <br/>
realized that these well-intended interventions do just the <br/>
opposite: they <br/>
foster dependency on external validation and undermine the <br/>
children&#39;s trust <br/>
in themselves. Children who are subjected to endless <br/>
commentary, <br/>
acknowledgment, and praise eventually learn to do things not for <br/>
their own <br/>
sake, but to please others. Gratifying others soon becomes their <br/>
primary <br/>
motivation, replacing impulses stemming from the authentic self <br/>
and leading <br/>
to its loss. <br/>
<br/>
Contrary to common belief, children feel more loved and self-<br/>
assured when we <br/>
do not intervene in their activities. Not only do they remain secure <br/>
in our <br/>
love and support when we refrain from intervening, but they need <br/>
us to <br/>
protect them from these intrusions, which can interfere with their <br/>
progress, <br/>
self-reliance, and emotional well-being. <br/>
<br/>
When we intervene with praise, wants, advice, and rewards, <br/>
doubts sneak in <br/>
and shake loose our children&#39;s trust in themselves and in us. <br/>
Sensitive and <br/>
smart, they perceive that we have an agenda - that we are <br/>
manipulating them <br/>
toward some preferred or &quot;improved&quot; end result. This <br/>
awareness gets them <br/>
thinking: &quot;Perhaps what I am trying to achieve is wrong - I can&#39;t <br/>
trust <br/>
myself to know or choose,&quot; or &quot;Mom and Dad have an agenda <br/>
that I must <br/>
fulfill if I am to have their approval and their love.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Gradually, a shift occurs. Children who were once doing for the <br/>
sake of <br/>
personal pleasure or understanding begin doing for the sake of <br/>
pleasing. No <br/>
longer do they trust in their actions, and no longer do they trust <br/>
us, for <br/>
we are not really on their side. Along with the shift to pleasing us <br/>
comes <br/>
the fear of not pleasing us. Emotional and intellectual <br/>
dependency, low <br/>
self-esteem, and lack of self-confidence invariably follow. <br/>
<br/>
Even when we intervene with casual commentary on our <br/>
children&#39;s imaginative <br/>
play, doubts sneak in. What children are experiencing inwardly at <br/>
these <br/>
times is so often remote from our &quot;educated&quot; guesses that <br/>
bewilderment soon <br/>
turns to self-denial and self-doubt. Moreover, children perceive <br/>
the phony <br/>
and patronizing remarks for what they are, and may conclude <br/>
that it is OK to <br/>
be insincere and pretentious. <br/>
<br/>
From Praising to Observing <br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to stop dishing out praise. For one thing, we are <br/>
hooked on <br/>
our conditioning as well as on the &quot;hard sell&quot; of the holy cow <br/>
called <br/>
Praise. For another, we are easily misled: the praised-for-every-<br/>
achievement <br/>
child seems like a happy, successful, highly self-esteemed <br/>
child. In <br/>
reality, such a child has shifted to the pleasing mode, driven to <br/>
success <br/>
not by personal curiosity or delight, but by the desire to oblige us <br/>
and <br/>
live up to our expectations. As educator John Holt has said of <br/>
children, <br/>
&quot;They are afraid, above all else, of failing, of disappointing or <br/>
displeasing the many anxious adults around them, whose <br/>
limitless hopes and <br/>
expectations for them hang over their heads like a cloud.&quot;2 In <br/>
short, the <br/>
esteem we notice is not self-esteem, for the self has been lost in <br/>
the early <br/>
years of this type of conditioning. The happiness we see is not <br/>
pleasure, <br/>
but rather relief that another pleasing act has been <br/>
accomplished, securing <br/>
parental approval (emotional survival) and concealing a feeling <br/>
of deep <br/>
loss. <br/>
<br/>
Children, too, can be fooled into believing that these pleasing <br/>
behaviors <br/>
originate within and have everything to do with who they are. The <br/>
ultimate <br/>
deception comes when children grow up to become seemingly <br/>
accomplished and <br/>
happy adults. Psychoanalyst Alice Miller, in her book The Drama <br/>
of the <br/>
Gifted Child, gives voice to the lamentable conviction that arises: <br/>
&quot;Without <br/>
these achievements, these gifts, I could never be loved.... <br/>
Without these <br/>
qualities, which I have, a person is completely worthless.&quot; Miller <br/>
goes on <br/>
to explain why achievement based on pleasing denies self-<br/>
understanding and, <br/>
in so doing, leads to depression, feelings of &#39;never enough&#39;, and <br/>
other <br/>
emotional disturbances in often the most successful people.3 <br/>
<br/>
To &quot;follow one&#39;s own drummer&quot;, a person needs to exercise the <br/>
muscles of <br/>
free choice and self-learning from the start. The difficulty we have <br/>
in <br/>
trusting our children&#39;s ability to flex these muscles stems from <br/>
our own <br/>
experience of not having been trusted. Trusting is, simply, not <br/>
natural to <br/>
us. Only as we make a concerted effort to get out - and stay out - <br/>
of our <br/>
children&#39;s way do we discover the wonderful truth: the magic is <br/>
already in <br/>
our children, ready to unfold in its own way and in its own time. <br/>
<br/>
Nearly every child comes to life equipped with a self that is <br/>
capable of <br/>
blooming to capacity. Unhindered in its growth, this self will lead <br/>
the <br/>
child to skills and knowledge and, in the process, self-<br/>
actualization. We <br/>
have no right to attempt to control the direction of this growth. <br/>
Instead of <br/>
training our children through various forms of intervention to fit <br/>
our <br/>
vision for them, we need to train ourselves to respect nature&#39;s <br/>
creation and <br/>
to safeguard its full, authentic bloom. <br/>
<br/>
Indeed, the end result we are looking for - an able, highly self-<br/>
esteemed, <br/>
creative, curious, and responsible human being - is already <br/>
observable in a <br/>
two-year-old child.4 Allowed to put these gifts to use in a self-<br/>
directed, <br/>
self-trusting way, the youngster will develop capabilities while <br/>
enhancing <br/>
these desirable qualities. Maturation will then come as an <br/>
authentic <br/>
expression of the self, rather than as an appeasement to <br/>
parental authority <br/>
and other forms of domination. <br/>
<br/>
Getting out of the way gives us an opportunity to become curious <br/>
observers. <br/>
At the same time, it frees us of power struggles and initiates an <br/>
approach <br/>
to parenthood that is infinitely more enjoyable and fulfilling. I <br/>
know of no <br/>
more interesting, engaging, fascinating, and glorious <br/>
&quot;entertainment&quot; in <br/>
life than watching children unfold freely.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429702351">Once when David (my oldest)was 5 he wrote a little<br/>
story.  It was so beautiful and cute.  It was about<br/>
the antics of &quot;little loves&quot; (little creatures he<br/>
illustrated with hearts with legs and happy faces).  I<br/>
was So enchanted when he showed me.  So Delighted, so<br/>
happy...he did it on his own....entirely.  Then.  I<br/>
STUPIDED OUT. (It makes me cry even now) I said &quot;Oh,<br/>
this is WONDERFUL, why don&#39;t you go show your Daddy,<br/>
too?&quot;  So he did. After a while I went hunting for<br/>
David, I wanted to save this little story forever.  I<br/>
found him crying in the closet.  He said &quot;YOU LIED TO<br/>
ME. IT (my story) WAS NO GOOD. IT WAS BAD. DADDY SAID<br/>
THE WORDS WERE SPELLED WRONG!! You could have told me<br/>
first, Mama, before I showed him, so that it would<br/>
have been right and not ALL WRONG AND BAD.&quot;  David had<br/>
torn it all up and wadded and mushed it in the mud. He<br/>
never showed me another story that he wrote again. <br/>
NEVER.  I snuck in his room (and when older into his<br/>
computer) and read them there.   He HAS written poems<br/>
for and to me....And when I finally came to my senses,<br/>
I divorced his Daddy (ostensibly for other reasons,<br/>
but maybe only for things like that).  XDH never did<br/>
understand what he had done wrong.  He did lots of<br/>
stuff like that. Thick headed. How can persons with<br/>
good hearts be so cruel? <br/>
<br/>
Oh I wish I could go back and just keep that little<br/>
story for myself and not have said &quot;go show&quot;. He<br/>
shared it with ME and I did ruin it. However I did<br/>
learn a lesson. Don&#39;t say &quot;go show&quot; don&#39;t say &quot;do that<br/>
for....&quot;  Just let the child BE. And be grateful that<br/>
they trust you enough to share their creations with. I<br/>
didn&#39;t make that mistake again, but it was too late<br/>
for David.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679383587">I sent the article to my mom and here was her response:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Yes, I found it interesting and agree with most of it I think but also am <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wondering how I raised such wonderful children while doing all the wrong <br/>
things!! Maybe there&#39;s more to it than what the article says --- perhaps some <br/>
children are born with the ability to just blossom anyway if they are given <br/>
enough love and experiences. What do you think? The other posibility is that <br/>
all of you could have been even MORE exceptional and happier had I known all <br/>
this 50 years ago. Who knows?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that she didn&#39;t DO the wrong things all that often.  She was <br/>
very young (21 when I was born) and this was the 50&#39;s and kids and adults <br/>
lived more separate lives. They were like the adults in the Rugrats -sort of <br/>
seen as helpful and sometimes demanding, but not entirely &quot;real&quot;. I think <br/>
there was a certain amount of &quot;benign neglect&quot; only because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
expected that adults would organize children&#39;s time for them or interfere in <br/>
their play. School in the 50&#39;s was pretty calm -- they didn&#39;t expect kids to <br/>
even begin to learn to read until 2nd grade, when the Dick and Jane big books <br/>
were used. Kindergarten was only a half day and we played house and blocks <br/>
and visited the dairy and the airport and the fire department. We still had <br/>
naptime on mats on the floor in 1st grade. We didn&#39;t have any homework until <br/>
7th grade. We had a few afterschool activities - a dance/etiquette class and <br/>
Brownies/Girl Scouts and music lessons starting when we were around 10 or so. <br/>
There were no organized sports for girls. I ran all the way home from school <br/>
every day and changed clothes (we had to wear dresses to school, of course) <br/>
and I had a quick snack and went out to play with whatever kids were <br/>
available -- there were LOTS of kids in our neighborhood and we could ride <br/>
our bikes anywhere for blocks around including the local schools, shopping <br/>
center, and vacant lots. Or we&#39;d go inside someone&#39;s house and play games or <br/>
play dolls or whatever. I spent a LOT of time playing various forms of bat <br/>
and ball games out in the street. There was pretty much always a game going <br/>
on out there. Boys and girls played together. Sometimes I played by myself <br/>
because I wanted to -- skating around and around on our big driveway or <br/>
reading a book up in a tree. I always felt like we had LOTS of time to play.<br/>
<br/>
My parents didn&#39;t do much with us on a daily basis, except feed us and make <br/>
us take baths before bed - they mostly just let us be kids. We went to the <br/>
beach during the summer, we took a short vacation every once in a while, and <br/>
we went to Disneyland on my birthday. Once we went to the mountains to see <br/>
snow (less than 2 hours from home). But really we didn&#39;t do much. Our house <br/>
was FILLED with books, though, and my parents read a lot. My grandparents <br/>
lived in exotic places - like Libya and then Iran and then Turkey. They <br/>
stored some stuff in our garage - dressers with drawers FILLED with seashells <br/>
- I spent hours handling them and looking them up in field guides. They&#39;d <br/>
also stored a filing cabinet that was filled with articles torn from <br/>
magazines and newspapers - no photocopiers, remember? My grandparents had <br/>
simply torn out any article that they thought was interesting and filed it <br/>
under subject headings. I used to just pull random articles out and read <br/>
about all different kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
I think what we had was the gift of huge amounts of free time with no adults <br/>
looking over our shoulders. <br/>

<br/>
Benign neglect is the same term I use to describe my parents style of parenting. We did go to school but we didn&#39;t get homework until high school. It wasn&#39;t at all like what the kids are forced to do these days. <br/>
<br/>
We had to wear dresses too, once we hit junior high, and I hated it. My legs were so skinny they called them Bick refills when I wore navy tights, and my knees were so bony they called them door knobs! But all of that was relatively minor because we seemed to have lots of time to play and wander the neighborhood. Our friends were all ages, whoever was around. <br/>
<br/>
These days the kids are all busy with after school programs and homework. It&#39;s as if there are no children in our neighborhood, even during holidays. Arrangements are made to fill all of their time even during holidays!  The toddlers are double programmed  to make sure they have every advantage for early learning. The ones that can&#39;t afford all of the enrichment programs are at daycare centers until supper time and then early to bed so that their parents can have &quot;time&quot; and so that they can cope with the early morning routines. <br/>
<br/>
Daisy&#39;s piano teach told me that when her kids were young they had over 160 kids under 13 on their street at one time. She used to flood their yard for ice-skating in winter, and she would come home to find a dozen kids in the yard, none of them their own! My kids know some others on the street but rarely get invited to play and are never invited to birthday parties. <br/>
<br/>
Our lifestyle is too much for most people to cope with. Unfortunately our people, those who don&#39;t send their kids to school, are scattered all around and it&#39;s not easy for the kids to get together casually for good old fashioned play. We have an open house every other week but it&#39;s not nearly enough to satisfy my kids needs for playmates. My oldest was into hockey and baseball, which gave him a good-sized pool of niebourhood kids to play with but my 12yo isn&#39;t into group sports and he&#39;s having a hard time in the friend area. I need to find a way to attract some kids for him and his little sister.<br/>

<br/>
No children in your neighborhood? We don&#39;t seem to have any **people** in our neighborhood. Most days it seems like a wasteland with rows of empty shells. Granted, we do have a lot of retired people living right near us, so that means fewer kids. But even they are hardly ever around. We do have a park in our town, but there are rarely any kids there, even toddlers. Older kids are usually found at the park only for softball league games. <br/>
<br/>
We have times when we feel isolated and we will get off our butts and drive to hang out with people. And my kids really like being friends with adults too, so that helps.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m thinking that she didn&#39;t DO the wrong things all that often.  She was <br/>
very young (21 when I was born) and this was the 50&#39;s and kids and adults <br/>
lived more separate lives. They were like the adults in the Rugrats -sort of <br/>
seen as helpful and sometimes demanding, but not entirely &quot;real&quot;. I think <br/>
there was a certain amount of &quot;benign neglect&quot; only because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
expected that adults would organize children&#39;s time for them or interfere in <br/>
their play.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, Pam, sounds just like my childhood! Except for the exotic grandparents <br/>
part &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I do think this is true.  Add to it that my mom really listened to me when I <br/>
talked - although I was a lot less likely to talk to her than my kids are to <br/>
me. We live in a fantastic neighborhood where, though all the kids go to <br/>
school, the parents let the kids alone to play and do their own thing. Last <br/>
summer, we finally infected everyone with our do-nothingness, and none of the <br/>
children went to camp. My kids were so happy.<br/>

<br/>
Yes this is it.  I would describe my childhood and my parents parenting<br/>
much the same.  There was definitely some distance in my early <br/>
years, babysitters, mom working, trips to the river leaving the baby <br/>
(that would have been me) at home for the weekend with my aunt.  <br/>
My sis says that is probably why attachment parent like I do (some<br/>
of my friends say nobody holds there baby as much as I do and I<br/>
used to hang regularly with LLL/AP folk).  Once my mom quit working<br/>
to be home with me we really connected. I have no real memories of<br/>
my mom before 5 but I do of my sibs and the babysitter whom they<br/>
used to pick me up from (babysitter was also my kindergarten<br/>
teacher who was very sweet).  Anyhow now that I went off on that<br/>
tangent, I agree, one of the best things my parents did for me<br/>
was allow me that free time after school, on weekends and summer<br/>
vacations were a dream : )   Even my own children who I have <br/>
tried so hard to keep from growing up too quickly (classes here<br/>
classes there) are probably more rushed then I would like them<br/>
to be.  I think there is so much pressure, even amongst hs&#39;ers<br/>
to have kids in these &quot;enriching&quot; activities (not to mention my<br/>
everyday activities that keep us busy -we run a business from<br/>
our home that sometimes has me going when I don&#39;t always<br/>
want to be).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775874592">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once when David (my oldest)was 5 he wrote a little<br/>
story.  It was so beautiful and cute.  It was about<br/>
the antics of &quot;little loves&quot; (little creatures he<br/>
illustrated with hearts with legs and happy faces).  I<br/>
was So enchanted when he showed me.  So Delighted, so<br/>
happy...he did it on his own....entirely.  Then.  I<br/>
STUPIDED OUT. (It makes me cry even now) I said &quot;Oh,<br/>
this is WONDERFUL, why don&#39;t you go show your Daddy,<br/>
too?&quot;  So he did. After a while I went hunting for<br/>
David, I wanted to save this little story forever.  I<br/>
found him crying in the closet.  He said &quot;YOU LIED TO<br/>
ME. IT (my story) WAS NO GOOD. IT WAS BAD. DADDY SAID<br/>
THE WORDS WERE SPELLED WRONG!! You could have told me<br/>
first, Mama, before I showed him, so that it would<br/>
have been right and not ALL WRONG AND BAD.&quot;  David had<br/>
torn it all up and wadded and mushed it in the mud. He<br/>
never showed me another story that he wrote again.<br/>
NEVER.  I snuck in his room (and when older into his<br/>
computer) and read them there.   He HAS written poems<br/>
for and to me....And when I finally came to my senses,<br/>
I divorced his Daddy (ostensibly for other reasons,<br/>
but maybe only for things like that).  XDH never did<br/>
understand what he had done wrong.  He did lots of<br/>
stuff like that. Thick headed. How can persons with<br/>
good hearts be so cruel? <br/>
<br/>
Oh I wish I could go back and just keep that little<br/>
story for myself and not have said &quot;go show&quot;. He<br/>
shared it with ME and I did ruin it. However I did<br/>
learn a lesson. Don&#39;t say &quot;go show&quot; don&#39;t say &quot;do that<br/>
for....&quot;  Just let the child BE. And be grateful that<br/>
they trust you enough to share their creations with. I<br/>
didn&#39;t make that mistake again, but it was too late<br/>
for David.<br/>
<br/>

Oh Sharon,<br/>
How awful for both of you! I&#39;m sorry.<br/>

Absolutely! I remember when I was a kid we used to run<br/>
all over the neighbourhood, playing games, climbing<br/>
trees, exploring the creek, etc. The only &#39;extra&#39;<br/>
activities I had were piano lessons (from my best<br/>
friend&#39;s mom, and 5 houses away!) and Bluebirds (then<br/>
Campfire Girls). <br/>
Kindergarten was until noon (and there was naptime in<br/>
there as well!), then we went home for lunch. First<br/>
grade was until 2pm (that&#39;s when we started on Dick<br/>
and Jane). We certainly didn&#39;t have homework in<br/>
elementary school! I started school in 1969 though.<br/>

Dick and Jane in 1st grade when I was in 3rd grade. But I remember waiting <br/>
and waiting and waiting for the chance to learn to read (I&#39;d picked up a <br/>
bunch, but it wasn&#39;t &quot;official&quot;) and I expected to start on the first day of <br/>
2nd grade. But it wasn&#39;t to be. I waited about 6 WEEKS  into 2nd grade before <br/>
the Dick and Jane books were finally brought out.<br/>

I was pondering this myself recently. I&#39;ve decided to<br/>
put up some flyers. I&#39;m going to &#39;advertise&#39; for other<br/>
unschoolers. I&#39;m going to put some up at the library,<br/>
2nd hand kids shop, grocery store, etc. I figure I&#39;&#39;ve<br/>
got nothing to lose and we have everything to gain<br/>
from it. The vast majority of home schoolers around<br/>
here are very religious and don&#39;t mix with others<br/>
much. I have found 2 other unschooling families and<br/>
I&#39;m sure there must be more out there somewhere, it&#39;s<br/>
just a matter of finding them! Oh, how I wish we could<br/>
all be closer together!<br/>

Yes, I grew up in Mill Valley (across the bay from<br/>

was struck again by how much it&#39;s changed. It used to<br/>
be a fun little &#39;hippie&#39; town and now it&#39;s full of<br/>
