<div id="ygrps-yiv-143995100">A chat-style interview was published yesterday that has been mostly unavailable for ten years.  <br/>

I was interviewed a few weeks ago for a podcast that will be released August 15 (a Tuesday), by Rebecca Bohman at The Luminous Mind.<br/>

<br/>
I’ll try to remember to bring a link here when it’s out.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I told a few of the same stories in both. It’s because people ask the same old questions too often. :-)<br/>
<br/>
So… one old one, to read, and a new one coming in a month, to listen to.<br/>
<br/>
There’s also a series of short and fun unschooling stories linked on my blog (my poor too-little-used blog, which has some of my favorite photos being collected there in a couple of recent posts).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jessica Hughes has a series of posts on a new site called Steemit, about unschooling. They&#39;re interesting, and I want to save them in one place for my own benefit and to let others go exploring! Language warning (the four-letter kind) but artistry promise (flowing prose and some fun little stories).&quot;<br/>
