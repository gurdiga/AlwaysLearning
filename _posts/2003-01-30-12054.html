<br/>
Of course, I don&#39;t believe that but Lexie is proving it to me.  She just <br/>
read a sentence aloud to me, showing me the error in the sentence which <br/>
included a series of items (they used the word and twice and didn&#39;t put <br/>
comas in appropriately).  This isn&#39;t the first time this has happened. <br/>
 I suppose she hears me do this with the things I read, I always get a <br/>
kick out of finding editing errors within newspapers, magazines and <br/>
books, and generally point them out to her or to Mark.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just really neat to watch her handwriting improve, without any <br/>
&quot;program&quot; or books, to watch her spelling develop, all on it&#39;s on, and <br/>
to see her learn the rules of the writing.  <br/>
<br/>
However, the funniest thing is to watch her read in the bath tub, <br/>
something I do.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466234627">That is true.  We were reading some old literature a few months ago<br/>
&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and my son mentioned the run on sentences and one time<br/>
suggested a different way it could be written.  We really haven&#39;t<br/>
officially studied grammar.  Lisa of MT<br/>
