<div id="ygrps-yiv-592720457">Do unschoolers have schedules?<br/>
<br/>
Since my kids were born, we&#39;ve never really had an official schedule or<br/>
routine.  But every once in awhile (like now) I have this need to &quot;get<br/>
organized,&quot; and I try to get our family on some sort of loose<br/>
schedule/routine.  We don&#39;t really map out our day by the hour or anything.<br/>
Just rough things like breakfast--play--outside--lunch--reading (me by<br/>
myself or me to the kids)--tv--outside--play--tv--dinner.  I&#39;m not really<br/>
strict about the schedule.  If something else comes up, or if we don&#39;t feel<br/>
like sticking to it, we don&#39;t have to.  Usually after a few weeks of this, I<br/>
don&#39;t really feel the need for the schedule anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I have this need.  Sometimes I think the kids feel bored<br/>
and out of sorts because their days have no predictability.  Sometimes *I*<br/>
feel out of sorts.  Is there an &quot;unschooly&quot; way to schedule your days?  Does<br/>
anyone else ever feel this need for predictability?  Am I just bored?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, Kim, I&#39;m thinking if you have to ask &quot;Am I just bored?&quot; then you  <br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve forgotten how old your kids are.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re still young, your urge for a schedule might be a need to  <br/>
feel you have &quot;accomplished&quot; something - that urge to be &quot;productive.&quot;  <br/>
Life with young children is all process, not much product (unless you  <br/>
count dirty diapers as product &lt;g&gt;). Some of us are overly achievement- <br/>
oriented and are uncomfortable when we&#39;re not producing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe replace the urge to &quot;schedule&quot; with more of a &quot;to-do list.&quot;  <br/>
Every day you could put at least a few things on your to-do list that  <br/>
will jazz up your lives. Put the usual things on there - appointments,  <br/>
meal plans, play dates, library book due dates &lt;G&gt;. Add &quot;make  <br/>
playdough&quot; and &quot;put on loud music and dance.&quot; Stuff like that.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t schedule all the days the same way.  Over the next few days,  <br/>
schedule some things unlike what you&#39;ve scheduled before.  Here are  <br/>
some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
although most of those days &quot;just happened.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once you get unschooling going well, once it starts to flow, you can  <br/>
predict that most days will be full of cheer and learning, and some  <br/>
will be quieter but there will still be learning going on.<br/>
<br/>
I you have &quot;play&quot; on your schedule, it clearly implies the rest of  <br/>
the time isn&#39;t for playing.  Calling it &quot;free time&quot; would be worse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628586322">I find my girls and I (I say that since hubby is away at work during the week so it&#39;s up to us!) do well with a loose schedule.  Young children esp. need some predictability each day--it makes them feel safe and secure--such as having lunch at around the same time each day, a similar time each day when they get ready for outside or snack or what have you.  My girls are 7 and 9 now so we can be looser but I notice they still get upset if I let them go past lunch and they suddenly say, &quot;Oh, no, we missed lunch!&quot;.  Not that it&#39;s a tragedy, we just go ahead and get something to eat.  I do think children want and count on us to be their guides.  Some unschoolers will disagree with my opinion regarding having a loose schedule but I find it helpful!<br/>

<br/>
I understand that it&#39;s your opinion, but is it the opinion of an  <br/>
unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s important for other readers to know.  Do you consider yourself  <br/>
an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Young children esp. need some predictability each day--it makes  <br/>
them feel safe and secure--such as having lunch at around the same  <br/>
time each day, a similar time each day when they get ready for  <br/>
outside or snack or what have you. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The idea that a schedule adds to security comes from social work, I  <br/>
believe--work with foster children and orphans.  It&#39;s a way that  <br/>
traumatized children can find more stability.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Young children esp. need some predictability each day--it makes  <br/>
them feel safe and secure---=-<br/>
<br/>
Young children need to feel safe and secure.  A regular lunch could  <br/>
not possibly add to the security of a young child who sleeps with his  <br/>
mom, wakes up gently, eats when he&#39;s hungry regardless of the time on  <br/>
the clock, because he always nursed when he wanted to and his mom  <br/>
doesn&#39;t say &quot;You can&#39;t eat yet, it&#39;s not lunchtime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A schedule could not possibly add to the feeling of safety of a child  <br/>
who is free to be with her mom as much as she wants to be.  If a  <br/>
child is forced away to school, then lunch on time might be the only  <br/>
safe touchstone in a sea of fear.  But at home?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m questioning &quot;lunch&quot; (are kids not allowed food before or after a  <br/>
certain time?) and &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;secure,&quot; in light of unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some kids may thrive with that kind of scheduling, but my life has  <br/>
NEVER been like that and my kids never ever had one day like the one  <br/>
before it. They thrive on unpredictability - doesn&#39;t disturb them at  <br/>
all. They fell asleep when they were sleepy, wherever we were. They  <br/>
ate when hungry. They played inside all day one day and then outside  <br/>
all day for the next three days. Whatever!<br/>
<br/>
Seems as soon as someone says &quot;...children need...&quot; then there is  <br/>
going to be someone with the opposite experience or opinion!<br/>
<br/>
We have to look for real at our own real kids and think about what  <br/>
that particular child needs. And then we have to keep looking and  <br/>
thinking because their needs change over time!<br/>

was a poster hung on the wall that had pictures of activities.  We had <br/>
so much stuff that it was impossible to leave it all out, spread out, <br/>
for exploration.  So I put pictures on the wall, this was before they <br/>
both could read, so they&#39;d remember what we had in our house.  <br/>
Examples are puzzles, computer games, playdoh, blocks, markers, <br/>
pattern blocks, board games, etc.<br/>

they will be, and that he might could be diagnosable with obsessive  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  He still doesn&#39;t need for the same things to happen the same  <br/>
way every day.<br/>
<br/>
I like to know what&#39;s going on in advance if something&#39;s going on.   <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s something wrong with me.  Holly and I went  <br/>
to a movie.  We knew yesterday we were going to.  We might go to  <br/>
another one Tuesday.   That doesn&#39;t mean we need to go to a movie  <br/>
once a week at the same time, it means we like to have our plans a  <br/>
day or three in advance so we can plan around them.   But for  <br/>
tomorrow there&#39;s nothing on the schedule but to feed Ben&#39;s dogs.   <br/>
That flexibility is what enables us to go and do something  <br/>
interesting on the spur of the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some people are seeing it as an all or nothing:  either a life  <br/>
is scheduled and there is a routine, or there is chaos an no one  <br/>
could ever possibly know what&#39;s going on.<br/>

<br/>
That may work for some kids, but it&#39;s arbitrary to make schedules based<br/>
on a time clock.  My first daughter set a very regular eating and<br/>
sleeping schedule almost from the moment she was born.  It was nothing I<br/>
did really, I just followed her lead and did what felt natural.  If I<br/>
had tried to duplicate that same schedule for my second child, I<br/>
would&#39;ve been spinning my wheels and making life more difficult than<br/>
needed.  Both of my kids feel safe and secure because of meeting their<br/>
needs, not because of any schedule.  It was more about the<br/>
predictability of me meeting their needs.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; My girls are 7 and 9 now so we can be looser but I notice they still<br/>
get upset if I let them go past lunch and they suddenly say, &quot;Oh, no, we<br/>
missed lunch!&quot;. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why would a certain age create a more loose schedule?  I think perhaps<br/>
that the tightness of a schedule would cause a child to be upset about<br/>
missing a lunch hour.  If there wasn&#39;t a tight schedule it would just be<br/>
a child wanting something to eat because they are hungry.  How can<br/>
someone miss lunch, if they haven&#39;t had it yet?  You can&#39;t miss<br/>
something you have yet to do.<br/>
<br/>
It seems unnecessary to create that kind of tension within a home when<br/>
you could focus on making it happy and fun while meeting the needs of<br/>
your children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not that it&#39;s a tragedy, we just go ahead and get something to eat. I<br/>
do think children want and count on us to be their guides. Some<br/>
unschoolers will disagree with my opinion regarding having a loose<br/>
schedule but I find it helpful!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not only is it not a tragedy, it isn&#39;t really anything that should be<br/>
remarked upon with exclamation.  It&#39;s lunch, it&#39;s hunger.  I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if a schedule like that would cause a child to rely on a time clock and<br/>
if that would really be conducive to unschooling.  I really think it<br/>
would hinder the free flowing way that unschooling works, even if you<br/>
have a &quot;loose&quot; schedule that can be broken, it begs the question, &quot;why<br/>
have a schedule at all?&quot;.  Why not live life and do things and if<br/>
something requires a time commitment, then so be it.<br/>
<br/>
By suggesting that kids need time schedules to create safe and secure<br/>
kids, it opens the door to suggesting that kids also need math and book<br/>
time and recess.  Those are all ideas touted at school to promote the<br/>
idea that predictability creates safe and secure kids that are ready to<br/>
soak up what a teacher tells them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667981889">I have a hard time with last minute changes to a schedule. That isn&#39;t about having a schedule, I suppose, but that I don&#39;t turn off of a path easily. The other day Simon wanted to radically change the plans for his birthday celebration and I had a bit of a grumble, but did it and it worked out well. Knowing that I have to pause and rethink for a few minutes when a change is what is being asked for helps me a lot. <br/>
<br/>
David&#39;s parents have a really rigid schedule. When we were in Japan and they came to visit they would get visibly flustered if we missed their 11:00 coffee ritual. And when we visit them, nothing will move them from their very ritualized life. They&#39;ve been ex-pats for much of their life, sort of the last of the British colonialist generation, and I can picture them carving out a little Britain for themselves wherever they went. David has said that their cooks, wherever they lived be it Malaysia or Oman or the Phillipines or Hong Kong, always had to cook a meat and two vege for dinner. He&#39;s said that it wasn&#39;t as good or as companionable as eating in the kitchen with the staff. I would much rather figure out ways to move off a schedule than lose out on an experience because I couldn&#39;t shift. <br/>

were elsewhere--we have a big house and it was cold and...  my fault.<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s Monday, no one can park on the street or the trash won&#39;t  <br/>
be taken from anywhere in the cul-de-sac.  This is always stated as a  <br/>
reminder on Sunday nights.  &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s trash day.&quot;   The city  <br/>
scheduled that one, not us.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  The city scheduled that one, ABC scheduled the show, Pars  <br/>
restaurant scheduled when Marty had to come to work...<br/>
<br/>
We work around other people&#39;s schedules a lot!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023328885">-=-Both of my kids feel safe and secure because of meeting their<br/>
needs, not because of any schedule. It was more about the<br/>
predictability of me meeting their needs.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Perfect!  It&#39;s what I was thinking, but I didn&#39;t say it as well.<br/>
<br/>
A scheduled lunch is important if the child is denied access to food  <br/>
until lunch (as in school, as in families where they&#39;re told &quot;No&quot; a  <br/>
lot, or where parents  have the idea that snacks will spoil an  <br/>
appetite, and it&#39;s easier to press a child to &quot;clean the plate&quot; if  <br/>
he&#39;s kinda starving to the point that he&#39;ll eat spinach or lima  <br/>
beans.  YUCK to all that!  (Well, not yuck to spinach or lima beans;  <br/>
I&#39;m fine with those, but to the methodology and purpose of scheduling.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500687920">David&#39;s parents have a really rigid schedule. When we were in Japan <br/>
and they came to visit they would get visibly flustered if we missed <br/>
their 11:00 coffee ritual. And when we visit them, nothing will move <br/>
them from their very ritualized life. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
The inlaws are like this.  Dinner is always at 6pm, floors are mopped <br/>
on Mondays, laundry done on Tuesday, and so on. When we visit them, <br/>
and when Andy has gone alone to stay with them for a time (they live <br/>
in Hawaii, we&#39;re in New Mexico) he loves the orderly schedule <br/>
aspect.  He&#39;s even willing to go to bed at a set time so he can stay <br/>
on schedule for what grandma has planned for the next day.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be easy to look at this and think it means I should put him <br/>
on a schedule.  But when I look closely I see that the demands of a <br/>
schedule imposed by someone else wear on him.  He picks up repetitive <br/>
behaviors that serve as an outlet for personal control over his own <br/>
life.  I can see where if Andy had to live on someone else&#39;s schedule <br/>
it would slowly destroy his peace.<br/>
<br/>
Like Sandra said, we regularly work with others&#39; schedules -- Monday <br/>
& Friday playdates with our local group, soccer game on Saturday, <br/>
volunteering at a friend&#39;s farm, meeting friends at the zoo, etc.  <br/>
These tho are things we choose to do, they&#39;re always optional and <br/>
anytime we find it&#39;s not working for us on any day, we can just say <br/>
no.  <br/>
<br/>
And we schedule our own activities and outings.  It helps Andy (11yo <br/>
ds) to know what we have on the calendar for the next day.  He likes <br/>
the predictability of having a schedule -- even a loose one -- but <br/>
needs to be able to choose and alter that schedule as his needs and <br/>
moods change.  Dan (7yo ds) is very much a spontaneous person -- he <br/>
resists most attempts to schedule him, convinced there&#39;s always <br/>
another time to do whatever he&#39;s not doing now. Throw in my oldest <br/>
who has his own place but overnights with us a night or two each <br/>
week, and who relies on me to help him with grocery store runs and a <br/>
ride to school when he&#39;s overnighted, and there are some required <br/>
schedules we all accommodate. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d never be able to impose a schedule on our kids, but it does help <br/>
to have a general idea of what we want to do and when things are  <br/>
happening.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree tho that scheduling isn&#39;t rightly a part of unschooling.  If <br/>
a child expresses a need for a schedule, it should be of his own <br/>
making, which would be just one aspect of how that child unschools.  <br/>
If the adult feels a need for a schedule, then s/he can make his/her <br/>
own, but to impose it on a child doesn&#39;t really fit with <br/>
unschooling.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of my thinking on the schedules is that I have 2 kids who are VERY<br/>
different people.  If one of my goals as an unschooling parent is to<br/>
parent each child how they need to be parented, then a one size fits all<br/>
schedule for both my girls wouldn&#39;t compliment that kind of parenting. <br/>
Even a loose schedule wouldn&#39;t really work well because my girls need<br/>
things at different times from one another.  The only way any kind of<br/>
schedule would work for our family is one that I would impose on them. <br/>
I couldn&#39;t mesh out two completely different people&#39;s schedules and<br/>
impose one or the other on all of us.  It would have to be mine and that<br/>
feels arbitrary and selfish.<br/>
<br/>
My sister has her life ultra scheduled.  She homeschools with recesses<br/>
and reading time and math time.  Each day is given a different chore and<br/>
each day there are everyday chores that must be done by a certain time. <br/>
When we were visiting, occasionaly something would come up that was ONLY<br/>
one day and I would invite her and the kids to come.  She usually<br/>
declined because of their schedule.  It&#39;s full, there is no room in it<br/>
for doing spontaneous things that might very much enhance all their<br/>
lives.  It really bothered me.  I kept thinking, well, why can&#39;t you do<br/>
that tonight or tomorrow, and her thinking is that putting something off<br/>
till later gets her off schedule.  Even when we scheduled something a<br/>
week in advance she had her kids scrambling to get everything done<br/>
before the event so that they wouldn&#39;t miss anything on their schedule<br/>
for the day that they would be skipping it to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
It felt crazy making.  It wasn&#39;t peaceful or happy or fun and on top of<br/>
all of it, the things that could have made it fun where being pushed<br/>
aside as trivial and meaningless.  I think schedules can cause kids to<br/>
feel stress over time and cause them to see time as something that needs<br/>
to be filled up with &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; instead of using that time to do things<br/>
you love and get all that other stuff done as you go along.  There will<br/>
be so many times in life when you &quot;have to&quot; do things on other people&#39;s<br/>
schedules that it seems silly to create that arbitrarily.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098403146"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; NEVER been like that and my kids never ever had one day like the one<br/>
&gt; before it. They thrive on unpredictability - doesn&#39;t disturb them at<br/>
&gt; all. They fell asleep when they were sleepy, wherever we were. They<br/>
&gt; ate when hungry. They played inside all day one day and then outside<br/>
&gt; all day for the next three days. Whatever!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seems as soon as someone says &quot;...children need...&quot; then there is<br/>
&gt; going to be someone with the opposite experience or opinion!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have to look for real at our own real kids and think about what<br/>
&gt; that particular child needs. And then we have to keep looking and<br/>
&gt; thinking because their needs change over time!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -pam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This describes our home as well.  And I don&#39;t think it could ever be any<br/>
different now.  When I first pulled my 10 yr old son out of school (just<br/>
at the first of this year, so I&#39;m still new at this), it was such a<br/>
blessing in so many ways.  School actually interrupted our lives in so<br/>
many more ways than I ever realized.  He was never a &quot;scheduled&quot; baby --<br/>
nursed when he wanted, napped when he wanted, etc.  I was met with SO<br/>
much criticism -- &quot;you should make HIM get used to being in YOUR life,<br/>
not plan YOUR life around HIM.&quot;  I was just floored by that, and it came<br/>
from lots of different directions.  Rest assured I didn&#39;t change my<br/>
&quot;wicked ways&quot; of mothering my baby -- besides, how exactly does one make<br/>
a baby conform??   I could go on and on about this...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry -I sidetracked (I do that a lot).  Going to school those few years<br/>
he did, we just got through the days.  We had to be up by a certain<br/>
time, eat at a certain time, leave, etc.  And of course the school<br/>
schedule was rigid and unbending.  I didn&#39;t have the confidence in<br/>
myself at the time to &quot;school&quot; my own child - how sad is that?  But<br/>
that&#39;s all changed (getting to this point is yet another long story I&#39;ll<br/>
share if anyone is really that interested) and we&#39;re living our lives. <br/>
WE live them.  Not by a schedule and not by someone else&#39;s expectations.<br/>
<br/>
My 2nd son, now 2 and 1/2, will NEVER be a scheduled kid of any kind. <br/>
He never has been predictible- not even before his arrival in the world<br/>
- never does the same thing two days in a row and I seriously doubt ever<br/>
will.  And they are happy, healthy, thriving little boys.  Hungry = eat <br/>
tired = rest or sleep  want to go outside? GO!  We do like others have<br/>
said - go to different activities, but we don&#39;t schedule them.  And if<br/>
we&#39;re doing something already engaging when it&#39;s time for whatever<br/>
outside activity is planned, we choose.  Well, my oldest chooses which<br/>
he would prefer to do.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned knowing someone who does certain things on certain<br/>
days.  I have a friend who cleans on Mondays, regardless.  Her birthday<br/>
was on a Monday.  She cleaned all day.  I don&#39;t get it.  I once asked<br/>
her if she could just clean when something is in need of cleaning.  She<br/>
was baffled.  And someone mentioned in-laws who are rigid in scheduling.<br/>
Mine, as well.  And I cannot get through to them that although we do not<br/>
have any particular hard and fast nap time, my little one does tend to<br/>
drift off after lunch (somewhere between 1 and 2 in the afternoon). <br/>
Every single holiday &quot;dinner&quot; is at high noon, no exceptions.  And no<br/>
crib, no guest bed (no one allowed in the master bedroom), no place for<br/>
babies to sleep.   I&#39;m skipping the rest of these events until further<br/>
notice.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so refreshing to know that we&#39;re not alone in living our<br/>
what-may-come lives.  I do not like to dread to do something.  I do not<br/>
like to plan and plan and plan because when I used to do such planning,<br/>
9 times out of 10 it never played out like I planned in the first place.<br/>
It&#39;s nice to relax, take in the day, smell the roses, etc.  Why should<br/>
my kids not have that same opportunity?  They have things they want to<br/>
do - plant seeds, play games, read, tv, chase the dog, whatever.  I am<br/>
along for the ride.<br/>

If it is spontaneous for that day or moment it does not need to be written down.<br/>

<br/>
A few years ago I let Zac pick out a special wooden box (recipe box size) at the craft store - it looked a bit like a treasure chest; We brain stormed ideas of things we could do, like the list others talked about, each idea was written on an index card.  If we could not think of something to do we could go to the treasure chest of ideas.  A note book would work just as well - but the special box looked nice sitting out where we&#39;d remember we even had a list ;)  And it was a special box to us - just shopping for the box and creating the cards was an activity in and of itself.  I picture some kids enjoying decorating their own box.  We only have one child so we had one box.<br/>

This is how I feel!  I&#39;ve actually done this before--declined things because<br/>
it conflicted with my schedule!  Before unschooling, I&#39;ve even passed up<br/>
learning experiences, because it wasn&#39;t &quot;in the schedule.&quot;  I&#39;d actually<br/>
think things like, &quot;We&#39;ll talk more about dinosaurs when we do our dinosaur<br/>
unit.&quot;  What was I thinking???<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I am an organized/structured person by nature or by habit.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s something that I should try really hard to give up or<br/>

don&#39;t know.  But I do know that it is amazing how my journey through<br/>
unschooling has gotten me to examine myself this closely!  Very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219860028">~~Not only is it not a tragedy, it isn&#39;t really anything that should be<br/>
remarked upon with exclamation. It&#39;s lunch, it&#39;s hunger. I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if a schedule like that would cause a child to rely on a time clock and<br/>
if that would really be conducive to unschooling. ~~<br/>
<br/>
I wonder about this too.<br/>
<br/>
My children have always eaten when they are hungry, even before we<br/>
understood unschooling completely. They&#39;ve never learned to connect<br/>
TIME to food, but hunger. Isn&#39;t that about trust? I don&#39;t see what<br/>
time has to do with it at all.<br/>
<br/>
Some people might get hungry around the same times each day, but even<br/>
within that loose rhythm hunger would vary! If you eat because you&#39;re<br/>
hungry, not because it&#39;s a certain time, that&#39;s a MUCH more natural<br/>
way of nourishing your body.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t even have names for meals. We just eat! Do you call it lunch<br/>
if it&#39;s after breakfast or if it&#39;s around noon? Because we might have<br/>
two times of eating in there.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll fix a substantial meal midday,sometimes in the<br/>
evening...we just go with the flow of what makes sense for that day<br/>
and our moods.<br/>

But we do lots of things, just not in a completely structured order.  We<br/>
do have weekly groups we meet with so that is a standing &quot;plan&quot; I<br/>
suppose.   I should have written it better.  We have different<br/>
activities that we decide we want to do.  But we do not necessarily<br/>
select an exact date and time.  It&#39;s not any fun to, say, go to the zoo<br/>
or museum or painting class if someone isn&#39;t up for it.  I&#39;ve done that,<br/>
and it&#39;s never a good turn-out if one of the kids is out of sorts or not<br/>
really interested at that time.  You know how hard it is to do something<br/>
that you really do not want to do, or be someplace that you really do<br/>
not want to be.  So that is the basis for our spontaneity.  We have<br/>
places we want to go, have a &quot;plan&quot; for going to those places, i.e. time<br/>
of day, what to take, etc., but we only set the date if reservations are<br/>
required.  Does that make sense?  And btw, I, too, am not so great at<br/>
following through with my own plans. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802503387">-- &quot;you should make HIM get used to being in YOUR life,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not plan YOUR life around HIM.&quot; I was just floored by that, and it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>came<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from lots of different directions. Rest assured I didn&#39;t change my<br/>
&gt; &quot;wicked ways&quot; of mothering my baby -- besides, how exactly does one<br/>
 </span></blockquote>make<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a baby conform?? I could go on and on about this...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I heard that too when Chamille, now 14, was a baby.  I knew what people<br/>
were saying but I implimented it differently.  My husband and I decided<br/>
that having a baby wasn&#39;t going to change our life and make it all about<br/>
having a baby.   We decided that we should continue doing the things<br/>
that we love doing and continue living our life and bring our sweet<br/>
little baby along for the ride.  She got used to being in our lives,<br/>
partly because she was never NOT a part of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I became aware of how our culture treats children when Chamille was very<br/>
young.  Kids are most definitely not allowed in much of the adult world.<br/>
That is something that bothered me back then, and still bothers me now. <br/>
I was never a bar goer, but the idea that I couldn&#39;t go to a brew pub<br/>
with my baby and have a burger and beer really irritated me.  The big<br/>
thing back then, was that my husband was playing music locally and it<br/>
was hard to find places to play that allowed me to come with Chamille.<br/>
<br/>
I think that part of the reason that Chamille is so easy going and goes<br/>
along with most plans and outings willingly is because she&#39;s always been<br/>
along for the ride.  My younger daughter on the other hand made it<br/>
really difficult to parent that way because she cried all the time.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t go with the flow very easily.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, my oldest chooses which<br/>
&gt; he would prefer to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is generally how it works when we go and do things at our house,<br/>
however Margaux, our youngest is starting to become autonomous about<br/>
things now.  She wants a bigger voice.  It&#39;s an interesting transition<br/>
here.  We have been staying home most days because she is not wanting to<br/>
go anywhere, which ultimately frustrates her older sister, which I think<br/>
is kind of intentional.  Chamille can stay home alone, but Margaux<br/>
can&#39;t.  So if Chamille wants to do something, sister has to come along. <br/>
A lot of times we end up doing things in the evening so that Margaux can<br/>
stay home with either her dad or I and one of us can go and do something<br/>
with Chamille.  It&#39;s not perfect but it works in the mean time, until we<br/>
can find something better.</div>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You said it perfectly.  Blake (oldest @ 10) loves doing things that we<br/>
do (except he didn&#39;t inherit what I refer to as the &quot;animal gene&quot; and<br/>
prefers fish to fur).  He was an easy baby - could take him anywhere and<br/>
he was great with it, didn&#39;t cry, didn&#39;t try to destroy the place or<br/>
climb everything.  Andrew, the 2 yr old, however, is the exact opposite<br/>
- much more challenging and ornery.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know why this is.  People always seem to stare with fear or<br/>
disgust when a baby/toddler enters a restaurant.  We once went to a<br/>
Japanese restaurant - the hibachi/knife tossing type - for my birthday. <br/>
I knew Blake would love it, and he did - even the food.  But we got such<br/>
odd looks for bringing a then 5 yr old to such a &quot;grown-up&quot; place.  He<br/>
was perfect.  Blake would have been fine there at age 2, but I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
dare to take Andrew right now because he would hate it.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s us, as well.  Blake and I have two days a week that my mother<br/>
comes to take care of Andrew during the afternoons -- Blake and I escape<br/>
to fun stuff.  It&#39;s great having time with just him.  And he does stuff<br/>
with daddy, too, on the weekends - the boy stuff that like rocks in the<br/>
creek/fort building/car tinkering stuff!   Who knows if Andrew will ever<br/>
want to tag with them since he&#39;s such a mommy&#39;s baby right now (still<br/>
nursing).  Our family outings are generally limited to Target, the<br/>
grocery store, maybe the park or something like that, or just<br/>
sight-seeing.  Andrew detests his stroller (always has) and doesn&#39;t walk<br/>
on his own (getting there).<br/>
<br/>
I know our activities and outings will just continue to evolve as the<br/>
boys grow and take on new interests.   It will be interesting, though,<br/>
with their age differences to get them excited about the same place.<br/>
