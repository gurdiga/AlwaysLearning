<div id="ygrps-yiv-402111392">I got this in my email. Probably lots of others did too but for those<br/>
who didn&#39;t it might be fun to look at these video clips sent into<br/>
C-SPAN as learning resources on the Constitution.<br/>
<br/>
Register to watch. I think they&#39;re free. I haven&#39;t watch them yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-867301557">Ever since I sent away for the amazing American Presidents Timeline I have been getting cool stuff. (Sandra, thanks for the tip on the best way to hang that big boy on the wall.)<br/>
<br/>
I am getting email links like that mentioned below.  In the mail I got a DVD of &quot;America: The Story of Us&quot;, and a magazine called &quot;the Idea Book for Educators&quot; which is a listing and description of upcoming programs on A&E, Lifetime, History and Bio that they think educators might want to use in the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
I found out about some really cool shows I might not have come across otherwise. Hooray for the DVR.<br/>
<br/>
So if you haven&#39;t registered yet, it might be worth your while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058894827">Oh drats - we signed up for the free videos America: The Story of Us  way back last spring and they never showed up.<br/>
<br/>
We received the presidents time line - which was HUGE to say the least.  We have not received anything else except a couple of emails. hmmmmm<br/>
<br/>
When I went just now to try again for the videos they say the offer is expired :(  They are offering to sell them to us though for $40.00.   We did not watch the series on TV because we were not home when they were on, they were on at an inconvenient time, etc. SOOOOOO we thought &quot;no problem we will watch them when the DVDs arrive.  drats!  double drats!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300281849">Well of course Murphy&#39;s Law applies to me again ;)  The DVDs actually showed up yesterday - Ed & Zac just now stopped by the mail box on their way to play air soft and called to say it had arrived yesterday - our mail box is a block away and straight up a steep hill so we don&#39;t always get to it everyday - <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it will show up for you too!<br/>

YEA !!!!!<br/>
