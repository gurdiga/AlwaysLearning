<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685251930">What do you mean by curfews? I&#39;m assuming &#39;time to be back home when out&#39;?<br/>
  H is 14. When she goes to visit friends she tends to stay over as they are 60 or so miles away and the last train back is at 8pm. It arrives back after the last bus so its not practical.<br/>
  If she&#39;s going into town I ask her to be back by 6&#39;ish. Bristol is a high crime city. Lots of gangs, stabbings, daylight muggings as well as the drunken chavs on a friday and saturday night in the town centre. The bus comes up through Stapleton Road and Fishponds, reputedly the mostdangerous road in the UK so I&#39;d rather she wasn&#39;t on the bus late at night.<br/>
  She&#39;s been ok with this but of course assumes she is immortal and thinks a white teenager down there where its all black or Asian wouldn&#39;t attract any attention.<br/>
  At HE camps she sticks her tent y the other teens so I have no idea what time she gets back. The camp site is enormous but I tell her if they all go to the beach to make sure she&#39;s with people, not wondering country lanes alone trying to findthe campsite at 2am!<br/>
  Its not been an issue with the boys as B hates going outside and R prefers to hang out here too. I was sort of hoping they would go out. It can&#39;t be normal for a 13 yo and  11 yo to never go out! At their age I&#39;d be out all day climbing trees and hanging around. I sometiems joke that they should be out getting into trouble like normal people!<br/>
  When we were in VA things were easier cos there weere no buses and the kids couldn&#39;t go aywhere ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  When I was a teen, my parents started with a curfew but then <br/>
I consistently pointed out that things that happen after 11 are the <br/>
same things that happen before 11.  They eventually saw the light and <br/>
switched to simply wanting to know what I was doing and with whom.  It <br/>
was more inconvenient for them.  I would call or stop by the house all <br/>
hours to let them know that we had a new plan and were off to somewhere <br/>
else.  But it worked really well.<br/>

If they are hanging out on the streets ith their mates the a 11 curfew makes sense. Its at that time the pubs chuck out and the prostitutes and drug dealers are active. UK streets are rather busy from 11 with drunks. I wouldn&#39;t feel happy about a 14 yo being out with that. Even DH and me wont go out after 10 around here. Not unless we want drunken gangs of teens throwing stones and shouting etc etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724121321">It crossed my mind tht maybe its British teens. I don&#39;t know what American teens do to be honest but here, just wondering the streets with a group of mates, or hanging out on a street corner is what UK teens do. It can be quite intimidationg to walk past 15-30 teens, all in hoodies.<br/>
  There&#39;s just nowhere for them to go. Pubs don;t take under-18&#39;s, youth clubs are a bit stale, hanging out at a friends house is uncool. I remember doing the same. My mum couldn&#39;t figure out what the attraction was, especially in the winter. But it was just chatting, goofing around, bit of snogging and just hanging with a group of your friends. UK teens don&#39;t have acess to a car until 18 either. I suppose some ask mum to drive them somewhere but its a bit uncool to have your mum coming to pick you up!<br/>
  What do American teens do? I never saw any hanging around the street like you do here and couldn&#39;t figure out where they all were?<br/>

 <br/>
I guess we&#39;re really lucky in our town...it&#39;s very small, and we have a  cool <br/>
old stone school they turned into a youth center, with tons of stuff going  <br/>
on all the time.  They have a few rooms with lots of couches, TV&#39;s, etc,  and <br/>
another with fooseball tables and pool tables, and of course a gym with  <br/>
basketball hoops, tumbling mats, etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
Behind the youth center is a skateboard park, which has been a godsend for  <br/>
our transplanted California kids (we&#39;re in West Virginia now).   Redneck-type <br/>
kids hang out with their trucks either in Sheetz or Walmart&#39;s  parking lot and <br/>
talk, joke, shoot the breeze.  We do have a bowling alley  but I don&#39;t think <br/>
many kids hang out there.  <br/>

If a curfew makes sense to you, in your situation, in your  <br/>
neighborhood, you should have one.  The discussion is about how they  <br/>
can be avoided, or what other options might be.<br/>
<br/>
My kids used to have a friend who worked at an all-night 7:11 in a  <br/>
dark neighborhood.  They would drive over there and sit outside and  <br/>
have the cheap fountain sodas and talk, and visit with him.  He liked  <br/>
it, because he wasn&#39;t alone, and the place seemed friendlier.  They  <br/>
weren&#39;t scary-looking guys, so it didn&#39;t keep anyone from stopping.   <br/>
And they had a place to go late, when they were younger, where they  <br/>
didn&#39;t have to whisper because moms and siblings were sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
As they got older and had more money, they could go to all-night  <br/>
restaurants, or to the apartment of kids who weren&#39;t living with  <br/>
parents anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594440526">I think its a whole different culture. When I was a teen I remember reading about soda fountains and bowling alleys and all night places. We had none of that and generally still don&#39;t. I wanted to go live in America!<br/>
  If it were safe and H had mates to walk home with I wouldn&#39;t have a curfew. (Although most cities have them now. No unaccompanied under 15&#39;s out alone after 9pm. Horribly disrespectful in my opinion although I can see how it appeals. People don&#39;t want loud groups of teens hanging around outside their houses)<br/>
  To be honest, the curfew thing has never come up. H doesn&#39;t go &#39;out&#39; as such. She goes to stay at poeple&#39;s houses and comes back weeks later .If she goes into town its for the shops so its during the day.<br/>
  but, if she did ask to go wandering the streets alone at night I would have to be all heavy and say no. there&#39;s too many rapes, sexual assaults and muggings in this area. Its not safe for a young girl out alone. Its not safe for me so I don&#39;t do it. If she was bussing to a friends house very late I would go with her or pay for a taxi.<br/>
  Its a real shame freedom is so limited now. Although having said that, I walked 3 miles through the dark late at night when I was 17. I&#39;d had an argument with my friends. they&#39;d promised to walk home with me cos I had to be back at 10 but they didn&#39;t want to leave that early (disco I think) so i hd no choice (my mum&#39;s curfew actually made me at risk!). I was attacked in a churchyard i took a short cut through. Not very pleasant.<br/>
  but that was the only time. Geberally life seemed safer back in the olden days.... There wasn&#39;t gun crime like there is now :-(<br/>

  Maybe the whole walking thing doesn&#39;t happen over there. Did they go walking during the day? Sometimes nights are fun. I used to love it when I was younger. The lights, the darkness. its was all shivery spooky. Actually, I still do, there&#39;s soemthing about being out at night. When I went to NYC it was wild being out in the small hours. the streets were still alive and I just liked walking and looking and watching.<br/>

   <br/>
  Bit of a blanekt statement. You can have a fun home and still want to be alone outisde.<br/>
  Its just sad that streets and cities are risky now.<br/>
  I am wondering if its made kids more insular and less independant and less likely to enjoy their own company. My childhood was spent lying in a field watching clouds. Today&#39;s kids seem surrounded by music and noise and people constantly. Would be interesting to see other people&#39;s opinions on the value of alone-ness/<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids have no curfews - the concept is fuzzy for them - I mean,  <br/>
they know the word, but they don&#39;t quite understand how it would  <br/>
work. One of them once asked me, &quot;So, if a kid has a curfew of  <br/>
midnight, that means they&#39;re supposed to be home by midnight or they  <br/>
have to leave for home at midnight or they have to call home at  <br/>
midnight or what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re just courteous - they keep in touch. Cell phones are pretty  <br/>
wonderful for reducing mom-anxiety. They call or text message me  <br/>
throughout the evening - letting me know their plans. They sometimes  <br/>
stay out all night - they spend the night at other people&#39;s houses.  <br/>
But they always text message me (so as not to wake me up) and say,  <br/>
&quot;Sleeping at so-and-so&#39;s.&quot; If I wake up in the night and they&#39;re not  <br/>
home, I check my phone and it&#39;ll say where they are. Sometimes I call  <br/>
them, if I&#39;m wondering what their plans are.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and l always let them know, too, where we are, what our plans are.<br/>
<br/>
It is very much my role in the family - keeping track of everybody! I  <br/>
run through it in my head throughout the day - &quot;Okay, Cyrus is  <br/>
probably at the eye doctor by now, Rosie is at karate, Roya is at the  <br/>
library, Roxana is with her friend out shopping.&quot; The girls will call  <br/>
me to find out where one of the other ones is, sometimes. Cyrus (my  <br/>
dh) regularly asks me, &quot;So, where is everybody right now?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My own kids - go to movies a lot, hang out at bookstores that stay  <br/>
open until 11, sometimes go to video arcades, go to 24-hour  <br/>
restaurants in the middle of the night, hang out at friend&#39;s  <br/>
apartments or houses and watch movies or play games. They go camp out  <br/>
sometimes. They play pool or go bowling. My 15 year old doesn&#39;t stay  <br/>
out late very often - but she goes to overnighters at friends&#39; houses  <br/>
and occasionally there are parties at kids&#39; houses that last late. Oh  <br/>
- and LAN parties where big groups play video games for hours and  <br/>
hours. My 18 yo went to a dance club last weekend and then spent the  <br/>
night at a friends&#39; house. Rosie (15) does karate a lot - two nights  <br/>
a week she&#39;s at karate until about 9 pm and there are extra nights of  <br/>
karate at least a few nights per month. And she has soccer practice  <br/>
two evenings a week. Roxana is almost always in a show - so she has  <br/>
rehearsals almost every night until 10 or 11 pm and then castmembers  <br/>
will go get something to eat after that.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re all home together, everybody is really pleased that it  <br/>
happened and we usually watch something we&#39;ve taped, that we all like  <br/>
to watch together - lately it is &quot;LOST.&quot; Or, we play cards or games.  <br/>
Oh, and we have extended family that lives close (my two sisters and  <br/>
their families) - Roya goes to my sister&#39;s house at least once a week  <br/>
and spends an evening hanging out with her - they watch Gilmore Girls  <br/>
and just hang out together - sometimes have a craft project or  <br/>
something to work on. Roya goes to a gym to work out with her cousin  <br/>
some evenings. They all go to concerts once in a while - occasionally  <br/>
a big one, but mostly little things at local colleges. And - they go  <br/>
to shows - lots of youth or community theater productions and an  <br/>
occasional big production (RENT is coming in July).<br/>
<br/>
And, we have Disneyland passes - it costs $129 per year for the  <br/>
cheapest pass and that leaves the summer and weekends blacked out --  <br/>
but it still has LOTS of days and evenings that groups of teens can  <br/>
go there and have a blast. There were some of us who went there just  <br/>
this week and spent half a day. It is really nice for them to be able  <br/>
to meet there and hang out - go on a few rides and watch a show or  <br/>
two. The waiting in line time is fun for them - it is &quot;hanging out&quot;  <br/>
time - not so different than hanging out on a street corner just  <br/>
talking. The difference is that these kids LIKE the unschooling  <br/>
parents - it is okay with them if we hang out, too. We have fun  <br/>
together.<br/>

Same here. Only our curfew for the city is 9 during the week  which is also <br/>
the time when you can get tickets for also violating the noise  ordinance <br/>
nothing above 70 dcp i think.  Weekends it&#39;s 11.  And to be  out during those times <br/>
you have to be with someone over 21.<br/>

<br/>
I know some courts have ruled that actual curfews are not legal.  <br/>
Maybe yours hasn&#39;t been tested in court, though.<br/>

nope it&#39;s a curfew.  I was ticketed as a kid for being  out past 11 on a <br/>
weekend.  It was $100 although i have heard it has gone up  since.<br/>

To add to this i just went back over our curfew law in our  town and the <br/>
police no longer issue you a ticket if you are walking but you are  put in the <br/>
back of the squad and escorted back to your house.  But if you  are driving you <br/>
will get slapped with a HUGE fine and maybe your license  suspended.  During <br/>
the hours between 11p and 6a on the weekdays and 12a and  6a on the weekends <br/>
licenses and insurance coverage become void for people under  17, so if you are <br/>
driving during those hours and you are under 17 and you get  pulled over you <br/>
have no license or insurance and are then driven back to your  house and issued <br/>
a court date where the judge will fine you or even take your  license away. So <br/>
that is where they get you.<br/>

loitering law or not; San Diego *does* have a daytime curfew for <br/>
under-18&#39;s, too.  No one under 18 can be out during school hours <br/>
without a parent or a note from a school.  They have to be going to or <br/>
from school or to or from work.  One thing about San Diego schools, <br/>
though, is that there are many on different schedule tracks, so kids <br/>
are often around and are legitimately out of school.<br/>

The town I grew up in had 10:30.<br/>
<br/>
There are driving rules, depending on the kids&#39; licenses.  Both Kirby  <br/>
and Marty have full licenses now, but during the provisional days,  <br/>
they can&#39;t drive after midnight or have more than one unrelated minor  <br/>
in the car.  Kirby had a letter from work so he would&#39;ve been okay  <br/>
between there and our house after midnight on the nights he was  <br/>
closing up.<br/>

Seamus and i often hang out there after midnight, and i swear the <br/>
same kids are there from when *I* was in high school. I was talking <br/>
to one of the waitresses, commenting on whether she got good tips <br/>
from the kids or not (it varies, she says), and whether it bugs her <br/>
to have so many kids to wait on, and she said, no, they are usually <br/>
pretty nice to her and its better that they are hanging out there <br/>
having coffee than out on the streets possibly getting into trouble. <br/>
<br/>
My mom used to not want me out late Thursday nights, because &quot;all <br/>
the drunks are out on the road&quot;...its payday for the factories <br/>
around here. But i never had a curfew (she just wanted us to call if <br/>
we&#39;d be late), her motto was &quot;there isnt anything you can do after <br/>
midnight you can&#39;t do before&quot;, and none of us ever got into any <br/>
trouble. <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, never *once* have we been asked by the staff <br/>
at Dennys why Seamus is out so late on a &quot;school night.&quot; <br/>
