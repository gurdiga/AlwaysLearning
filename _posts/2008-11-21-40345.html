<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939587005">I have never posted before but I have gleaned a plethora of wonderful <br/>
ideas and insights from this group.  So first I want to say thank <br/>
you.  Thank you for helping me change my perspective.  Thank you for <br/>
enlightening me.  Thank you for helping me want to be a better mother.<br/>
<br/>
I have a dilemna that I would like to put out there for some <br/>
responses.  About a year ago my oldest son (10y at the time) made <br/>
friends with a neighborhood boy.  The boy is a bit of a &quot;loose <br/>
cannon&quot;.  He was easily angered, very loud, used foul language, <br/>
taunted the younger kids, and often playing would turn into an <br/>
argument with both parties storming off.  I sat him down and <br/>
expressed my desire to have a secure, loving environment.  I told him <br/>
foul language was not something we used, yelling and hollering at one <br/>
another was not something we did and taunting, pushing, hitting was <br/>
not  how we handled our anger.  He agreed to control himself and I <br/>
told him he could continue to come over.<br/>
<br/>
Over the next few months things seemed to get better with just a few <br/>
incidents.  Fast forward to this summer.  It seemed that overnight he <br/>
became this volatile, angry young man.  Everytime he came over one of <br/>
my children ended up in tears.  I had finally gotten to a point where <br/>
I despised having him come up to the door to ask if the kids could <br/>
play.  I had spoken with his mother about his relationship with my <br/>
kids, especially the oldest, but she was quite taken aback and seems <br/>
just as volatile as he is.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally one day my son and him began fist fighting.  I broke it up <br/>
and sent him home.  Then my son broke down and poured out his heart <br/>
to me.  He told me that this boy had said horrible things about me <br/>
and my other children and had been doing so for awhile.  My son told <br/>
me that he did not want to be friends with him and he knew that this <br/>
was not the type of friendship he wanted.  So, dh, myself and our son <br/>
sat down discussed the issue and we all agreed that the best decision <br/>
was to not have this neighbor boy over anymore and that it was best <br/>
if all communication was cut off.    <br/>
<br/>
Well despite all of that my son has moments where he breaks down in <br/>
tears and tell me that I don&#39;t like his &quot;friend&quot; and that is why he <br/>
can&#39;t play with him.  He has been telling me that he would like to go <br/>
over his house again and start playing with him.  I know that I <br/>
helped make a decision but I absolutely did not do it alone. Perhaps <br/>
I influenced him.  My maternal instincts were to just get him out of <br/>
that situation and keep him safe. <br/>
<br/>
I know what kind of environment I want to provide for my children.  I <br/>
also know that my son has a hole in his heart and I have yet to fill <br/>
that need for him.  I don&#39;t think that he really wants to be friends <br/>
with this boy, he often remembers what it was like when this boy <br/>
would come over.  I think he is craving that bond of friendship that <br/>
he thought he had. He is involved in Cubscouts once a week, soccer in <br/>
Spring and Fall, church once a week.  Other than that we do not have <br/>
a lot of get togethers with other kids.  We live in a remote little <br/>
town and most of his friends go to school and can&#39;t play during the <br/>
week.  I was taking him to an artclass but that was way too formal to <br/>
make any lasting bonds.  I&#39;m thinking of helping him start a club--<br/>
legos or books (his loves)--here at home but not sure.  <br/>
<br/>
Was I wrong in the decision I though &quot;we&quot; made?  SHould he try it <br/>
again?  Or should I help him move on?  I&#39;m just not sure what I <br/>
should do.</div>

<br/>
Maybe the decision should have been &quot;for now&quot; and not &quot;forever.&quot;     <br/>
You could help him move on AND try again.<br/>
<br/>
Holly visited families she didn&#39;t fully like or trust, and I just  <br/>
made sure I was near and prepared to pick her up if she called.  Much  <br/>
of the appreciation she has for our house and family is from the  <br/>
contrast with knowing more of the inner workings of other families  <br/>
(some unschooling, some homeschooling, some school kids).  I don&#39;t  <br/>
think the danger of being in a house where there&#39;s rudeness and maybe  <br/>
a little danger is as bad as the real, known harm of her not knowing  <br/>
why and whether the way things are at our house are cool and special.<br/>
<br/>
Some of her friendships she maintains even though she thinks the  <br/>
parenting is arbitrary and irresponsible and she sees it backfiring  <br/>
in ways the parents don&#39;t see.  It will make her a better parent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could have made it less permanent. It can pay off to be a  <br/>
little less sure that the way things are now are the way things will  <br/>
always be. You could have, at the time said, &quot;Let&#39;s just back off of  <br/>
this friendship for now.&quot; Then he could try it again (maybe just to  <br/>
test whether the fact that it had been temporarily broken off might  <br/>
have made a difference).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  SHould he try it  again?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that is what he wants to do, support his interest. Brainstorm  <br/>
together - figure out what often went wrong and how he might handle it  <br/>
this time. Maybe offer to role play a little - &quot;What do you think you  <br/>
might say to him if he badmouths your family?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or should I help him move on?  I&#39;m just not sure what I should do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Support his interests. Help him get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
Why has he not made friends from scouts or other activities? Have you  <br/>
tried inviting any over to your house?<br/>
