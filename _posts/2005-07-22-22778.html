<div id="ygrps-yiv-923827440">I just finished reading Joyce&#39;s post.  Well-said Joyce!  I am usually a<br/>
lurker but just felt like sharing today.<br/>
<br/>
I have really evolved with this chore thing.  As a child, my whole life was<br/>
a &quot;have to&quot;.  If I didn&#39;t do x and x then I was restricted or told what a<br/>
bad person I was in so many terms.  I never had chores per say for our girls<br/>
until we started homeschooling.  I was the one who ordered the &quot;best<br/>
curriculum&quot; and set up a chore chart.  (UGH, makes me cringe just telling<br/>
ya&#39;ll about this!)  Once our girls got to the age of 4 or so we always gave<br/>
them some sort of allowance so they could have money of their own and make<br/>
purchases or save.  When we pulled our girls out of school the chore chart<br/>
became their way of making money.  No allowance just paid for the chores<br/>
they did.  The rule was dh and I would pay for needs and the girls paid for<br/>
wants.   Shortly after we began homeschooling we had to move.  We went<br/>
through about a year of living with our parents.  It was during that time I<br/>
found unschooling.  And that is when the paradigm shift started.  Luckily my<br/>
dh and I were on the same page from the beginning.  Of course the worst<br/>
place to start unschooling is when you are living with parents whom are/were<br/>
schoolteachers. Both of our moms have been in the school system for years.<br/>
My mom taught 35 years.  My dh and I stayed strong and kept reading and<br/>
growing.  However, during the transition we started just giving our girls an<br/>
allowance again.  Once we moved into our new home and got settled I had been<br/>
reading and growing enough to realize I did not want to &quot;make&quot; my girls do<br/>
anything.  I must admit I would get really frustrated at times going behind<br/>
them picking up or cleaning the kitchen.  But I tried really hard not to say<br/>
anything. (I failed a few times)  I guess the old records I grew up with are<br/>
still there and I have to keep them at bay so they don&#39;t jump on the<br/>
turntable and start playing.  Both our girls really love to save and to work<br/>
towards a goal if they have something they really want.  So one day my<br/>
oldest asked me what they could do to earn money in addition to their<br/>
allowance!  So here&#39;s what we do now...Certain items around the house are<br/>
worth .50 like cleaning the cat box, unloading the dishwasher, folding<br/>
clothes, emptying trash, etc. Then depending on things they pick up on<br/>
themselves they get more.  For example, yesterday I came home and my almost<br/>
13yo had vacuumed part of the house, cleaned windows and mirrors, and<br/>
something else I can&#39;t remember.  We talked about a fair wage and came up<br/>
with $6.00.  Ended up I owed her $5.50 already so she asked for $6.50 to<br/>
make the total even!  Got to love it :) Occasionally the girls will argue<br/>
over who called the dishwasher or a load of clothes.  They are earning<br/>
pretty good money I must say.  Tomorrow our family is running a concession<br/>
stand at a horse show and the girls want to help so we will pay them.  This<br/>
whole thing has turned into a great way for them to earn money and purchase<br/>
those &quot;wants&quot;.  They both have been setting some money aside to open a<br/>
savings account.  It has opened the door for some great discussion<br/>
surrounding investments, purchases, etc.  I don&#39;t tell them not to buy<br/>
something but will sometimes help them think through it.  Sometimes they buy<br/>
anyway and later wished they hadn&#39;t, but that&#39;s life.  We have all done some<br/>
things like that.  It is just another opportunity to learn.  I suggested<br/>
they keep a journal/log of their income and expenditures.  They sometimes<br/>
would wonder why they didn&#39;t have as much money as they thought.  So both of<br/>
them keep a list of income and how they got it and on the other side they<br/>
keep a running log of what they spend and where they spent it.  My almost<br/>
10yo went on a spending spree one day and spent $43.87.  So she decided to<br/>
not spend anything else until she had replaced that amount.  She worked hard<br/>
and it didn&#39;t take her long before she earned it back.  But in the process<br/>
of doing this she got a separate piece of paper and at the top put $43.87<br/>
and every time she earned money she would subtract it from the $43.87 until<br/>
the total came to zero.  And people wonder how we do math!  There are some<br/>
adults that couldn&#39;t keep up with money management the way my girls can.<br/>
<br/>
The plus for me is I have a lot of help around the house now and everybody<br/>
is still smiling! :)  Maybe this will help someone else or maybe some of you<br/>
have other thoughts that might make this better.....Looking forward to more<br/>
discussion....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369156888">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
I always find chore/allowance discussions interesting.  When my  daughters <br/>
were growing up they received an allowance because they were part of  the <br/>
family, and when my spouse (the only paid worker in the family at that time)  <br/>
received a raise or a bonus, so did our daughters. Allowance was not tied  to chores <br/>
in any way.  We also gave the children age appropriate (in my  opinion, at <br/>
least) chores with the expectation that they would do them because  they were <br/>
part of the family.  In deference to their schedules, we  didn&#39;t give them <br/>
chores that had to be done at a particular time, but  rather, we rotated three <br/>
lists for the three girls on a weekly basis. The kids  could trade their lists, <br/>
pay one of the other kids to do their chores, or  whatever they wanted; the <br/>
chores needed to be done by Friday night, and then  they started their next week <br/>
and could do their chores over the weekend or  during the following week.  <br/>
Although the kids grumbled a bit now and then,  they always did their chores as it <br/>
was an expectation we had set up when they  were small.  I recently read an <br/>
article by a Mother who felt any imposition  of chores was detrimental to a <br/>
child&#39;s development into an autonomous  individual; although she made some very <br/>
good points, they were not enough to  dissuade me from thinking chores are a <br/>
natural part of one&#39;s daily functioning,  and can enhance growth when doled out <br/>
respectfully.<br/>

<br/>
Which means that when priorities between children&#39;s happiness <br/>
and chores conflicted, chores took precedence.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids and you have a good relationship it isn&#39;t because you <br/>
made them do chores. It&#39;s because of something else you did in <br/>
your relationship. Without being able to articulate what that was <br/>
in a way that others can do it too what you&#39;ve described is just <br/>
parents making kids do chores. And that doesn&#39;t build good <br/>
relationships.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733432754">Julia and I use a point system. She gets 5 points for brushing her hair and 5 for brushing her teeth. (She hates to do these things.) She gets 5 points for sweeping the kitchen each day. She can earn points by cleaning. She looses points if she leaves a mess behind her that I have to pick up. She earns some of the biggest points by accompanying me to work. She can earn up to 100 points for a full days work. She entertains herself by reading or she helps me out if she can. 100 points is equal to 100 pesos (10 dollars). For me it costs less to pay her like this than it would cost to have a sitter and she prefers to be with me. She spends points in several ways. She can spend 5 points to have a coke, chocolate candy or other treat. She can also cash her points in for pesos to spend or put in her piggy bank or bank account. She is saving for a video camera and her ticket to France. She really, really wants to go to France. That isn&#39;t something in my budget, but since I&#39;m not paying a<br/>
 sitter, she chose to save some money that way. I said ok I&#39;ll pay my ticket then. She also chose to take French classes. I figure if she is that interested in going that I had better come up with a way for us to go.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you really respectfully demand that a person do your bidding, though?<br/>
If you had a disabled child, he wouldn&#39;t be expected to mop the floor or <br/>
clean the toilet, and you would have MANY more &quot;chores&quot; yourself, taking care of <br/>
him.    So in such comparative light, an able -bodied child being assigned <br/>
chores (as an army officer assigns duties to new recruits) might seem a punishment <br/>
for being able bodied.<br/>
<br/>
I know all the arguments FOR chores.   Lots of justification for chores.    <br/>
Anyone who wants to bring those here should remember there is no one on this <br/>
list who hasn&#39;t probably been assigned chores or assigned them, who hasn&#39;t <br/>
heard and read the justifications for chores for something between many years and <br/>
a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
I bet there is no one here who hasn&#39;t also seen some detrimental effects to <br/>
people, property and relationships from the enforcement of chores, the failure <br/>
to do them on time or in a way to please the parent, the punishments that go <br/>
with that, the reactions to the punishments, the sneakiness it all engenders, <br/>
and the (sometime) resistance or refusal to do such tasks when the adult moves <br/>
out, the insistence/requirement that the spouse do &quot;chores&quot; with accompanying <br/>
argument and resentment and sometimes divorce, arguments over children&#39;s <br/>
chores and punishments...<br/>
<br/>
When does it end?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it just begins a different way, with home maintenance being done out of <br/>
choice and from love and generosity.<br/>

<br/>
Who will pay her to brush her hair when she&#39;s grown?<br/>
<br/>
In an unschooling context that all sounds like a giant step in the wrong <br/>
direction to me.   It&#39;s not relationship building.<br/>
<br/>
I just talked to my husband&#39;s oldest brother, who is finally initiating a <br/>
divorce after being separated for eight or ten years.   His interest in money <br/>
destroyed his family, destroyed his relationship with his sons (who are now 18 <br/>
and 20), he refused to pay tuition to a college his son got into, he refused to <br/>
lend him $8000 as part of a $20,000 truck purchase (my nephew wanted to avoid <br/>
the expensive full-insurance that goes with a car loan/lien).     I happen to <br/>
know from my father in law that recently my brother in law borrowed $20,000 <br/>
from HIS dad to play with a credit-card shuffle, to make a profit with that <br/>
money and then give the capital back to his dad.     <br/>
<br/>
Money is more important to him than anything. <br/>
He says he&#39;s poor when he&#39;s not.<br/>
He&#39;s an engineer for a government contractor, yet he won&#39;t even get himself <br/>
an apartment.   He rents a room from an elderly person.   He rented from a <br/>
woman for years, and her son just recently put her in a nursing home.   He lived <br/>
in a camper trailer for a month, and has just moved into a rental room in the <br/>
home of a 78 year old man.   He&#39;s retiring early, soon, and moving to stay with <br/>
his parents (my in-laws).<br/>
<br/>
He would rather have a pile of money than a relationship with his own <br/>
children. <br/>
He has a pile of money.   He says he&#39;s poor.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very sad to me that he doesn&#39;t relate with people as people, only as <br/>
numbers, as assets and liabilities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-817490154">I just posted about chores on my Michigan Unschoolers list, a couple<br/>
of different times.  I&#39;ll pass on what I said here, in case it helps<br/>
people think about it more.<br/>
<br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
Post 1:<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have chores.  Sometimes my kids get excited about helping<br/>
out, sometimes I ask for help (saying no is okay with me), sometimes<br/>
my husband and I do things ourselves and chat/play with the kids as we<br/>
do it, and sometimes one of us takes the kids out so the other can get<br/>
some housework done.  It kind of depends on the feeling around here at<br/>
the moment, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
What I love about this is that when my son cleans, he is very proud of<br/>
what he&#39;s done, and it all comes from him.  I love that the freedom we<br/>
have lets him take ownership of what he&#39;s done.  I think he learns a<br/>
lot about how good it feels to make a room clean.<br/>
<br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
Post 2, as I was trying to explain relationship and communication as<br/>
an important part of unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
An &quot;I message&quot; really changes the tone of parent/child<br/>
interactions.  &quot;I am feeling so unhappy with how the living room<br/>
looks,&quot; or &quot;I would love to see our sitting area cleaner so that we<br/>
could enjoy it while we watch Teen Titans together&quot; instead of &quot;Get up<br/>
and clean up this mess.&quot;   When I voice what I am feeling or what I<br/>
want, I also own that the problem is mine.  I may be the only one<br/>
seeing the mess at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
When I voice this, sometimes my family is very willing to help me out<br/>
at that moment.  Sometimes they reply with their own &quot;I messages.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m really involved in my game right now.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m very tired right<br/>
now.&quot;  Because I&#39;ve started with an &quot;I message,&quot; I haven&#39;t set up a<br/>
power struggle situation.  I&#39;ve voiced a need, and my family has<br/>
voiced that they have needs of their own.  We can problem-solve from<br/>
there.  I might decide to let it go for now, especially if they&#39;re<br/>
willing to help me later.  Or I might decide that I don&#39;t mind picking<br/>
things up myself -- that it&#39;s important to me to have a nice-looking<br/>
place when I want it.  My family will then give me the space to do<br/>
that -- my husband might take our toddler upstairs with him while he<br/>
naps, or my older son will tell me when his show is on commercial so I<br/>
can run the vacuum without interrupting him.<br/>
<br/>
The very cool benefit of this is that there are times when my older<br/>
son wants to do something nice for me, and he takes it upon himself to<br/>
clean something up.  The last time he cleaned up his room and showed<br/>
me, he was so proud of himself, and I could just relax and applaud<br/>
him.  That would have been much less likely to happen if I was nagging<br/>
him about cleaning it.  It came completely from him.<br/>
<br/>
My son *is* learning the skills he needs to help out around the house,<br/>
but he&#39;s learning lots of other stuff right now, too.  Respecting his<br/>
learning means that he is free to say no when I ask for help.  As it<br/>
turns out, if he isn&#39;t wrapped up in something else, he is often very<br/>
willing to help, especially if it means we get to hang out together<br/>
and chat.<br/>
<br/>
I choose often to give my children and my husband the gift of a clean<br/>
house, a clean room, clean clothes, and a meal that I know they&#39;ll<br/>
really enjoy.  When I don&#39;t feel like giving that gift -- when I feel<br/>
like giving the gift of my undivided attention, or when I want to give<br/>
myself some down time -- then I don&#39;t do those things right then.<br/>
When I need help, I ask for it.  We work it out together.<br/>

&gt; &quot;I&#39;m really involved in my game right now.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m very tired right<br/>
&gt; now.&quot;  Because I&#39;ve started with an &quot;I message,&quot; I haven&#39;t set up a<br/>
&gt; power struggle situation.  I&#39;ve voiced a need, and my family has<br/>
&gt; voiced that they have needs of their own.  We can problem-solve from<br/>
&gt; there.  I might decide to let it go for now, especially if they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; willing to help me later.  Or I might decide that I don&#39;t mind picking<br/>
&gt; things up myself -- that it&#39;s important to me to have a nice-looking<br/>
&gt; place when I want it.  My family will then give me the space to do<br/>
&gt; that -- my husband might take our toddler upstairs with him while he<br/>
&gt; naps, or my older son will tell me when his show is on commercial so I<br/>
&gt; can run the vacuum without interrupting him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The very cool benefit of this is that there are times when my older<br/>
&gt; son wants to do something nice for me, and he takes it upon himself to<br/>
&gt; clean something up.  The last time he cleaned up his room and showed<br/>
&gt; me, he was so proud of himself, and I could just relax and applaud<br/>
&gt; him.  That would have been much less likely to happen if I was nagging<br/>
&gt; him about cleaning it.  It came completely from him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son *is* learning the skills he needs to help out around the house,<br/>
&gt; but he&#39;s learning lots of other stuff right now, too.  Respecting his<br/>
&gt; learning means that he is free to say no when I ask for help.  As it<br/>
&gt; turns out, if he isn&#39;t wrapped up in something else, he is often very<br/>
&gt; willing to help, especially if it means we get to hang out together<br/>
&gt; and chat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I choose often to give my children and my husband the gift of a clean<br/>
&gt; house, a clean room, clean clothes, and a meal that I know they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; really enjoy.  When I don&#39;t feel like giving that gift -- when I feel<br/>
&gt; like giving the gift of my undivided attention, or when I want to give<br/>
&gt; myself some down time -- then I don&#39;t do those things right then.<br/>
&gt; When I need help, I ask for it.  We work it out together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348873096">She hates to brush her hair because she gets tangles in it. She wants long hair. We have a brush and comb. She has me brush it sometimes. It is better if she brushes it once a day becuase there are fewer tangles. I don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; her brush it before we go out. I don&#39;t know why she doesn&#39;t like to brush her teeth but she has picked many different toothbrushes and toothpastes. I think it is normal for children to dislike brushing their teeth and hair. I was the same way. She has a super high sensual sensitivity. She only wears cotton knit clothes. All these things we work on together. Some things like brushing your teeth are necessary.<br/>
 <br/>
She prefers to be with me. It doesn&#39;t hurt to offer her part of what I am earning. I think it gives her some ownership over what I&#39;m doing. When we work the B&Bs she sets tables and works with me in the kitchen asking me frequently, &quot;Can I do that?&quot; or &quot;What can I do?&quot; When I do computer work it&#39;s pretty boring for her. Today, for example I&#39;m working an hour then spending time reading or playing with her, then working an hour. Believe it or not, she and I are very happy and loving.<br/>

<br/>
I find all of these true for my youngest dd.  I finally realized (I am a<br/>
little slow sometimes) that if I brushed her teeth for her there wasn&#39;t a<br/>
struggle to get it done.  She is 9yo almost 10 but if it works then so what?<br/>
My dd doesn&#39;t like for her flow to be messed with at all.  I have really had<br/>
to work at respecting her and her time.  For the most part she could care<br/>
less if she ever took a bath or got out of her pj&#39;s.  Most days it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter except when she wants to play outside (or if we need to go somewhere)<br/>
.   It just doesn&#39;t seem like a good idea to be outside in pj&#39;s that show<br/>
too much of her body parts that don&#39;t need showing!  The bath I do insist on<br/>
but we have gotten better about there not being conflict surrounding the<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
As for paying them for extras around the house......I did that because they<br/>
asked for ways they could earn additional income.  I think there is<br/>
something about earning versus just giving it to them.  I already give them<br/>
an allowance and they don&#39;t have to do anything to receive this allowance.<br/>
If they don&#39;t do the extras I don&#39;t say anything to them about not doing<br/>
them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173616974">**Julia and I use a point system. She gets 5 points for brushing <br/>
her hair and 5 for brushing her teeth. (She hates to do these <br/>
things.) She gets 5 points for sweeping the kitchen each day. <br/>
She can earn points by cleaning. She looses points if she leaves <br/>
a mess behind her that I have to pick up.**<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a husband who decided to share what he earned by <br/>
giving his wife 10 points for each meal she cooked, 25 points for <br/>
each room that was spotless and took away 10 points if a child <br/>
was crying when he walked in the door, took away 5 points for <br/>
each thing he had to put away himself.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think he should write a book on how to build a great <br/>
husband and wife relationship? It sounds more like a recipe for <br/>
&quot;How to get your wife to do what you want her to do.&quot; (And it <br/>
actually might work for a woman who was raised so poorly that <br/>
that seems like good treatment!)<br/>
<br/>
There is something else that has fostered a good relationship <br/>
with your daughter and I think it&#39;s working *in spite of* the<br/>
points. <br/>
I think it&#39;s something that you aren&#39;t even aware of in how<br/>
you <br/>
talk to her, how you interact with her, how you treat her.<br/>
<br/>
**It doesn&#39;t hurt to offer her part of what I am earning. I think it <br/>
gives her some ownership over what I&#39;m doing. When we work <br/>
the B&Bs she sets tables and works with me in the kitchen <br/>
asking me frequently, &quot;Can I do that?&quot; or &quot;What can I do?&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
The system you&#39;ve described with the points doesn&#39;t lead to<br/>
kids <br/>
who happily help. If other parents tried what you&#39;ve described <br/>
they won&#39;t get the results you have.<br/>
<br/>
Either<br/>
<br/>
1) there is something in your interaction with you daughter (how <br/>
you talk to her, how you problem solve with her) that makes her <br/>
feel like part of the team working towards a mutual goal, or<br/>
<br/>
2) her personality dictates that she&#39;d be that way unless your <br/>
interaction with her were very crushing.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you understand what has created a good relationship <br/>
with your daughter and why it works and how it can work for <br/>
others it won&#39;t help others build good relationships.<br/>
<br/>
For most parents parenting is a crap shoot. They hear about <br/>
something that sounds good and they try it out to see if it will <br/>
work with their family.<br/>
<br/>
Most homeschooling lists work that way, people trade ideas that <br/>
work for them and others try them out.<br/>
<br/>
This list works differently. First this list isn&#39;t focused on<br/>
smooth, <br/>
efficient running families. It&#39;s about building good<br/>
relationships <br/>
with our kids. That&#39;s the primary goal and everything else is <br/>
secondary. Second it&#39;s figuring out *why* something builds good <br/>
relationships with kids and articulating it in a way that others can <br/>
figure out how to make it work in their own families.<br/>
<br/>
I think many people imaging life with kids will be like you <br/>
describe with the kids naturally understanding how important the <br/>
adult&#39;s work/ideas are and the kids pitching in to help.<br/>
<br/>
But reality is different! ;-) An artistic free-spirited child<br/>
isn&#39;t going <br/>
to &quot;just understand&quot; a parent whose high priority is a neat<br/>
and <br/>
orderly home.<br/>
<br/>
In order for a person to put aside their own immediate wants to <br/>
help someone else out they need to feel that their wants and <br/>
needs are important to others. If someone feels they need to <br/>
fight to get their wants and needs met they are unlikely to put <br/>
aside the fight to help someone else.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter feels her wants and needs are just as valuable <br/>
to you as yours are, its because of something else you&#39;ve done, <br/>
not because you&#39;ve handed out points. It&#39;s something else, <br/>
something in your interaction with her that you&#39;re taking for <br/>
granted that&#39;s working.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah---I was at my parents&#39; house over the weekend. My mother handed me <br/>
a newspaper article she&#39;d saved by John (ugh!) Rosemond. I said that I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to read anything by that idiot--that he hates children.<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Oh, no he doesn&#39;t! Look, he says that right here!&quot;  And <br/>
points to the article. It was an answer to a comment he&#39;d <br/>
received---which one of *you* wrote in??? &lt;BWG&gt;---the question was: &quot;It <br/>
seems that you hate children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, then I *had* to read it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seems that he likes children who obey, who don&#39;t ask questions, who are <br/>
well-mannered, who go to bed on time, who do their homework without <br/>
being asked, who do household chores, and who are seen and not <br/>
heard....among other things.<br/>
<br/>
He hates the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Well, well,.....<br/>
<br/>
My mother assumed that since my children do most of these things (well, <br/>
no homework), that I *must* be following Rosemond&#39;s advice.<br/>
<br/>
I assured her that I would no sooner do *anything* Rosemond suggested <br/>
as I would cut my kids&#39; heads off. AND that my children are so <br/>
wonderful *because* I avoid anything that even resembles a Rosemond&#39;s <br/>
suggestion.<br/>

UGH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116669353">This hit me when I read it because there is someone dear to me who&#39;s been in danger <br/>
of doing this same thing.  This is the same thing we might all do to alienate ourselves <br/>
from others but to an extreme degree, isn&#39;t it?  A focus on anger rather than on <br/>
needs.... Anger due to the wrongheaded idea that those who need money don&#39;t <br/>
deserve it from one who has worked so &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;sacrificially&quot; for it him/herself.  In <br/>
other words, it&#39;s denial of one&#39;s OWN needs (for close relationships, love, happiness <br/>
at being there for others) as well as the  self-induced deafness to other&#39;s needs, <br/>
which again is really just another of one&#39;s own needs (ie. hearing the needs of others).  <br/>
[Thinking on Rosenberg&#39;s Non Violent Communication lately.]  It might be if people <br/>
can&#39;t get inside this circular idea of love or wrap their heads around it long enough to <br/>
try it out and see, then they&#39;re stuck alone.  Bummer.  Sorry to hear about the brother <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Who will pay her to brush her hair when she&#39;s grown?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In an unschooling context that all sounds like a giant step in the wrong <br/>
&gt; direction to me.   It&#39;s not relationship building.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just talked to my husband&#39;s oldest brother, who is finally initiating a <br/>
&gt; divorce after being separated for eight or ten years.   His interest in money <br/>
&gt; destroyed his family, destroyed his relationship with his sons (who are now 18 <br/>
&gt; and 20), he refused to pay tuition to a college his son got into, he refused to <br/>
&gt; lend him $8000 as part of a $20,000 truck purchase (my nephew wanted to avoid <br/>
&gt; the expensive full-insurance that goes with a car loan/lien).     I happen to <br/>
&gt; know from my father in law that recently my brother in law borrowed $20,000 <br/>
&gt; from HIS dad to play with a credit-card shuffle, to make a profit with that <br/>
&gt; money and then give the capital back to his dad.     <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Money is more important to him than anything. <br/>
&gt; He says he&#39;s poor when he&#39;s not.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s an engineer for a government contractor, yet he won&#39;t even get himself <br/>
&gt; an apartment.   He rents a room from an elderly person.   He rented from a <br/>
&gt; woman for years, and her son just recently put her in a nursing home.   He lived <br/>
&gt; in a camper trailer for a month, and has just moved into a rental room in the <br/>
&gt; home of a 78 year old man.   He&#39;s retiring early, soon, and moving to stay with <br/>
&gt; his parents (my in-laws).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He would rather have a pile of money than a relationship with his own <br/>
&gt; children. <br/>
&gt; He has a pile of money.   He says he&#39;s poor.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s very sad to me that he doesn&#39;t relate with people as people, only as <br/>
&gt; numbers, as assets and liabilities.<br/>

well-mannered, who go to bed on time, who do their homework without<br/>
being asked, who do household chores, and who are seen and not<br/>

<br/>
The Alfie Kohn book, Unconditional Parenting, is a nice rebuttal to that <br/>
kind of thinking.  (If anyone wants to give Rosemond-quoting relatives <br/>
some &quot;homework&quot; to do.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926874550">That is the way I have been doing it (listening and trading ideas) <br/>
regarding chores except not using lists but my friends. <br/>
Yesterday I compiled a dishes and laundry rota. The kids are really <br/>
happy about it (it starts today) but I don&#39;t think I am. I wanted <br/>
help with this so I can be more free during the day to BE with the <br/>
kids and do stuff with them rather than spending 3 hours daily on <br/>
housework. I wish I could just get rid of the rota but the old way <br/>
meant I was doing everything and feeling exhausted. If there is <br/>
another way I&#39;d love to hear people&#39;s experiences about it. I have <br/>
read the chores page (Sandra&#39;s) but couldn&#39;t find anyone who didn&#39;t <br/>
have a partner helping out or 4 young kids on thier own (as I am).<br/>
<br/>
I love that this list is different from those other home-<br/>
school/parenting ones and am ready to learn from it.<br/>

&gt; Most homeschooling lists work that way, people trade ideas that <br/>
&gt; work for them and others try them out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This list works differently. First this list isn&#39;t focused on<br/>
&gt; smooth, <br/>
&gt; efficient running families. It&#39;s about building good<br/>
&gt; relationships <br/>
&gt; with our kids. That&#39;s the primary goal and everything else is <br/>
&gt; secondary. Second it&#39;s figuring out *why* something builds good <br/>
&gt; relationships with kids and articulating it in a way that others <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495499547">Here is on of the explanations of a rota from nationmaster.com :<br/>
<br/>
The rota was a cylinder, open on one side, that was built inside a<br/>
wall of a monastery; it was used for exchanging mail and food with<br/>
cloistered clergy, being their only communication with the world. It<br/>
was usually about 50 centimeters wide by 30 centimeters high, and its<br/>
opening did not permit visual or tactile contact with the<br/>
uncloistered. Messages or food were put into the cylinder, then the<br/>
rota was revolved so that the opening faced the other side. Monks were<br/>
stationed close by or were notified that someone had turned the wheel<br/>
by various mechanisms. In some cases, especially at night and in<br/>
winter, the rota was filled by the monks with food, and left there for<br/>
the poor, to give them something to eat without them having to ask.<br/>
The rota was also used by those mothers who didn&#39;t want to (or<br/>
couldn&#39;t) keep their (often illegitimate) newborn babies. They left<br/>
them in the safe hands of monks or nuns, their anonymity being<br/>
guaranteed by the rota. In some dioceses the instrument was abolished<br/>
to discourage this latter use.<br/>
see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Rota">http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Rota</a> for more<br/>
descriptions of rota.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently rota is latin for wheel. But I liked the examples given.<br/>
