++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
I have two questions that I am posting to this list because I think I will<br/>
get some wonderful and diverse input.  The phrase above prompted me to<br/>
finally do so.  Also, my friend today said to me &quot;ask one of your unschool<br/>
list, they dissect like you do&quot;.  I know, interesting statement also.  haha<br/>
<br/>
Question #1<br/>
For some reason, the word &quot;raising&quot; has been giving me some moments to<br/>
ponder. Everytime I say something like, &quot;I&#39;m raising my child, etc.&quot;, I feel<br/>
like I am talking about a cow or something.  You know, &quot;I&#39;m raising my cow.&quot;<br/>
It just feels awkward to me and I don&#39;t know why.  It never did before.<br/>
Maybe it is this RU Journey that has me thinking about everything I had come<br/>
to see as so-called normal.<br/>
<br/>
Question #2<br/>
I read in a post on one of my local groups where someone said, &quot;I graduated<br/>
2 of them&quot;.  That really got me thinking too.  It sounded so odd to me.  As<br/>
if the children themselves had nothing to do with anything up to that point.<br/>
<br/>
I would love some input on these two questions.  I don&#39;t know why they are<br/>
sticking in my head.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much.  I rarely post but am enjoying most of the topics of<br/>
discussion.  We are two years into the RU journey.  Our daughter just turned<br/>
8.  My husband and I both wish we could have started at the beginning.<br/>

our own private school in our home (it&#39;s usually the best option for <br/>
unschooling).  We might say something like that, since from our legal <br/>
point of view, Parent As School does set some point in time for the <br/>
ending of legally required school attendance for the student.<br/>

I have an essay called &quot;How to Raise a Respected Child&quot; and though it  <br/>
didn&#39;t bother  me when I wrote it, it has bothered me a little bit  <br/>
more everytime I see it.    On the other hand, I was trying to get a  <br/>
message to people who did feel strongly that they were creating their  <br/>
children somehow, as potters make something from cold, wet clay.    <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think about when we do use &quot;raise&quot; (and I know the  <br/>
whole &quot;rear&quot; argument but English speakers of my acquaintance don&#39;t  <br/>
use that term unless they&#39;re being snooty and stilted and honestly  <br/>
I&#39;d rather raise someone up than &quot;rear&quot; them, which sounds a little  <br/>
scatological).  Keith and I have discussed with one another &quot;that&#39;s  <br/>
just how they were raised&quot; or &quot;Well... you raised them to talk  <br/>
back&quot; (not said in a bad way, Keith to me).    I said &quot;We didn&#39;t  <br/>
raise them to live at home,&quot; once when we were talking about how  <br/>
sparkly Kirby is when he&#39;s away from home and how dull and boring he  <br/>
is sometimes when it&#39;s just family.    So we use it, but not in a   <br/>
mainstream way, and not without knowing we&#39;ve done it.  Not  <br/>
thoughtlessly, I think I mean.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t talk about grades or graduating.  When people talk about  <br/>
Kirby we say &quot;He&#39;s 19, he&#39;s working at Dion&#39;s, he&#39;s teaching  <br/>
karate...&quot; stuff like that.  Had he gone to high school he probably  <br/>
would have graduated last year, but there are kids his age (boys  <br/>
mostly) who failed a year (first grade mostly) who are still in high  <br/>
school at his age (poor guys).<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you about &quot;raised&quot; and &quot;graduated&quot; being problematical.<br/>

Question  #2<br/>
I read in a post on one of my local groups where someone said, &quot;I  graduated<br/>

 <br/>
The only reason an unschooler would need to use the term &quot;graduated&quot; would  <br/>
be to fulfill some legal requirement or to cross a language barrier.<br/>
 <br/>
In some states, it&#39;s irrelevant whether a kid is a high school  graduate or <br/>
not, but in others there are definite advantages--driver&#39;s licenses,  working <br/>
in the daytime, etc.  So, I have said to people &quot;just graduate them  early&quot; so <br/>
they could get out of those kinds of legal requirements.<br/>
 <br/>
I &quot;graduated&quot; my middle son when we no longer lived apart, so he could be a  <br/>
free agent and not need parental approval, etc.  It&#39;s a formality and had  <br/>
helped grease some of his wheels.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s the only purpose I can see for unschoolers.<br/>

school graduates, no matter how young they are. Not needing a work  <br/>
permit means no restrictions on work hours. And they can attend  <br/>
community college without any restrictions, if they are hs graduates,  <br/>
even if they are under eighteen.<br/>
<br/>
We just have to say: &quot;Taa-daa! You are now a high school graduate.&quot;  <br/>
There are no legal requirements about what it takes for someone to  <br/>
&quot;graduate.&quot; Private schools set their own requirements. So - I define  <br/>
&quot;ready to graduate&quot; as kids being at a point in their lives where  <br/>
they are wanting to do things that require or would be eased by high  <br/>
school graduation. I confess that the reasoning is just a bit  <br/>
circular &lt;G&gt; - but it makes sense to me that when a kid is ready and  <br/>
wanting to do things that require high school graduation, then THAT,  <br/>
in and of itself, indicates that they are ready to &quot;be graduated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My now-21 yo, who is very into ceramics, wanted to work full time at  <br/>
a clay and glaze company when she was 16. An option would have been  <br/>
to go to the local public school and try to get them to give her a  <br/>
work permit, but that comes with restrictions that are very specific  <br/>
about how many hours per day and per week a kid can work when school  <br/>
is in session and not in session and so on. Some employers get very  <br/>
worried about all this and it can limit opportunities for the kid.  <br/>
Roya wanted to work a regular 40 hours per week full-time job and  <br/>
that would not have been possible with a work permit. As a &quot;high  <br/>
school graduate,&quot; there was no problem - they could treat her just  <br/>
like any other employee.<br/>

<br/>
Here in California, the diploma issued by any private or public  <br/>
school is as &quot;pretend&quot; as any other. The state doesn&#39;t accredit  <br/>
anybody - not even public schools - and the diploma from any school  <br/>
really says NOTHING except that the student has met the graduation  <br/>
requirements of THAT school - accredited or not. The state doesn&#39;t  <br/>
issue the diplomas, nor approve them - nothing. It does say in the  <br/>
state education code what the minimum requirements are that the  <br/>
public schools have to set for graduation requirements - but the  <br/>
schools can and do add to those minimum requirements. The state has  <br/>
NOTHING to say about what the requirements are for graduation from  <br/>
private schools.<br/>
<br/>
Schools here can apply for accreditation from any of a number of  <br/>
difference accreditation agencies - they are ALL private agencies,  <br/>
not government-related. Lots of private schools are not accredited by  <br/>
anybody. Lots of others are accredited by very specialized  <br/>
accreditation organizations such as the NLSA - National Lutheran  <br/>
School Accreditation.<br/>
<br/>
WASC - the Western Association of Schools and Colleges is the  <br/>
organization that accredits most public schools here. There are other  <br/>
large regional accreditation agencies in other parts of the country.<br/>
<br/>
In some states, like New Mexico, I believe, the state, itself,  <br/>
accredits schools (based on recommendations from various  <br/>
accreditation agencies or commissions) - including non-public schools  <br/>
that seek accreditation.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit of accreditation is that one accredited school will  <br/>
normally accept all high school credits from another accredited  <br/>
school. Students transferring from a non-accredited high school to an  <br/>
accredited high school MAY find that the new school will not accept  <br/>
any or all of their credits.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really the only aspect of accreditation that matters, as far  <br/>
as I have ever been able to tell. Other than that a school that gets  <br/>
turned down for accreditation typically gets a bad reputation - bad  <br/>
press.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are probably exceptions somewhere, but colleges don&#39;t  <br/>
typically care about accreditation, because they look directly at  <br/>
what the student has really done - what courses he/she has taken -  <br/>
they don&#39;t rely on the student being a &quot;high school graduate&quot; to  <br/>
assume any particular body of study.  The UC system, in California,  <br/>
requires that high schools get their courses pre-approved by the UC  <br/>
system, in order for students applying as freshmen to a UC to count  <br/>
their high school courses toward meeting the entrance requirements.  <br/>
This is not the same as &quot;accreditation&quot; although people occasionally  <br/>
mistakenly use that terminology for it. It does make it more  <br/>
difficult for students in small private schools (such as  <br/>
homeschoolers) and definitely harder for unschoolers who don&#39;t &quot;take  <br/>
courses&quot; anyway - to be accepted as freshmen into a University of  <br/>
California. There are ways around it - high SAT scores, for example,  <br/>
and the most common way is to take classes at a community college and  <br/>
transfer in, rather than applying as a freshman. (Note to  <br/>
Californians: the UC System means University of California - UCLA, UC  <br/>
Berkeley, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, UC Santa Cruz, UC  <br/>
Davis, etc. There is a whole other state university system - Cal  <br/>
State University Long Beach, CSU San Diego, CSU Fullerton, San Jose  <br/>
State, San Francisco State, Fresno State, etc. The latter system does  <br/>
NOT require the pre-approved high school courses like the UC system  <br/>
does.)<br/>

<br/>
Correct.  That&#39;s about the whole of it.<br/>
And admissions officers of the universities requesting high school  <br/>
diplomas may choose an accredited school over a non-accredited one,  <br/>
if all other requirements are equal.<br/>
<br/>
Non-accredited schools (such as some of the private religious  <br/>
schools) fail to be up to state-accreditation par by such things as  <br/>
not having certified teachers, not offering a sufficient range of  <br/>
science classes or not using textbooks the state considers  <br/>
sufficient.  Some of the religious institutions take pride in that,  <br/>
though, when they&#39;re aiming toward the creationist, conservative edge  <br/>
of the plate.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose under my own circumstances, given my own history, it would  <br/>
seem that if I made a diploma I would be putting my kids in the same  <br/>
category as the worst lame little church schools.  So for me it&#39;s  <br/>
personal aversion and prejudice, perhaps. &lt;g&gt;   And for me to say  <br/>
that my child has received the full course of instruction seems  <br/>
dishonest, as there was no full course of instruction.  They&#39;re not  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Roxana turned 18 last September. She&#39;s been taking classes at the  <br/>
community college for years, but it always requires a LOT of effort  <br/>
to get a bunch of different signatures and they get the latest  <br/>
registration priority and so on.<br/>
<br/>
So this semester - that starts in January - she&#39;s 18 and shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have to do all that. We went into the admissions and records office  <br/>
to point that out to them and the girl at the counter said, &quot;But if  <br/>
she&#39;s still in high school she still has to do it even if she&#39;s 18.&quot;  <br/>
Well - first of all this is not true. The state education code  <br/>
specifically says that anybody 18 or up can go to the community  <br/>
college - no conditions at all. But I didn&#39;t argue with her, I just  <br/>
said, &quot;She&#39;s not in high school. Then the girl said she had to show  <br/>
her diploma. I said, &quot;You know - I could go home and make a diploma  <br/>
and bring it back.&quot; The girl said, &quot;No, it has to have the special  <br/>
seal on it.&quot; I said, &quot;I can put a seal on it.&quot; She said, &quot;Well it  <br/>
won&#39;t count if you just make one.&quot; I said, &quot;How are you going to know  <br/>
I made it?&quot; She said, &quot;You just told me.&quot; At that point I just asked  <br/>
to talk to her supervisor, who DID know the law and went into  <br/>
Roxana&#39;s computer file and changed her status - no problem. I&#39;d  <br/>
actually known all along that i could talk to the next person and  <br/>
she&#39;d know but I was fascinated by the responses of the girl at the  <br/>
counter - at how adamantly she stuck to her position in spite of the  <br/>
illogic of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029062605">I guess my philosophical question was more of the,<br/>
<br/>
Not why someone would say &quot;graduated&quot; (ex: legalities, state, etc.) but why<br/>
does one not say something like, &quot;they graduated themselves&quot; or &quot;they<br/>
graduated&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think the parent saying, &quot;I graduated 2 of them&quot; puts the work, talents,<br/>
life experience, etc.,  in their (the parents) palms and not the true person<br/>
who accomplished the tasks.  Does graduating really have anything to do with<br/>
the parent?  Yea, that&#39;s my question for pondering.<br/>

It is commonly-used terminology in schools. My sister just said it to  <br/>
me the other day, talking about the little private school her kids  <br/>
attended - &quot;The school is so little that it only graduated 11  <br/>
students last year.&quot; But --- it does sound funny to use it as  <br/>
unschoolers, but the whole idea of &quot;graduating from unschooling&quot; is  <br/>
pretty hard to make sense of. I just consider it to mean the kid is  <br/>
ready to do something that requires a high school diploma. But, as I  <br/>
said before, that is because I live in a state in which the meaning  <br/>
of graduation from a private school is not defined by the state.  <br/>
There are so MANY different kinds of private schools that offer all  <br/>
KINDS of educational experiences and the requirements for  <br/>
&quot;graduation&quot; from those are each very different from the others.<br/>
<br/>
For a really cool and interesting private school that specializes in  <br/>
&quot;graduating&quot; people, young and old, who are ready to move on and do  <br/>
something that requires a diploma, see the &quot;Beach High School&quot; website:<br/>

I don&#39;t happen to think our diploma is &quot;pretend&quot;.  He met all the  <br/>
requirements to be considered graduated.  Not by any school&#39;s standard, but  our own.  <br/>
 <br/>
Everyone has to come to terms with these things in some way or  another...the <br/>
way we bump up against the system in our attempts to live as  though school <br/>
doesn&#39;t exist.  I gave my son a diploma.  He  graduated.  He and I signed the <br/>
diploma.  It has gold lettering and  filigree and it&#39;s beautiful and he liked <br/>
it.  It wasn&#39;t pretend.<br/>

So a parent who &quot;graduated six kids&quot; did a big job, and the kids were  <br/>
byproduct maybe?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like all the work of teaching, when a homeschooling parent (more  <br/>
than unschoolers) sighs about how much work it is to teach all those  <br/>
kids.  The kids are apparently not doing anything (except  <br/>
occasionally making the parent&#39;s hard job even harder).<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe I&#39;m missing your point to, but some of these phrases point in  <br/>
all kinds of directions.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Collegiate:<br/>
1a. to grant an academic degree or diploma to   1b.  to be graduated <br/>
from<br/>
<br/>
A student doesn&#39;t simply graduate, he or she graduates *from* an <br/>
institution.  If that institution happens to be a homeschool and the <br/>
parent is the head of that school, that head has granted an academic <br/>
diploma and therefore &quot;graduated&quot; the student.<br/>
