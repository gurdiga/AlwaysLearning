<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213273701">I went to Yahoogroups to see if our group showed under an &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
search.  210 groups did, so I thought I&#39;d go through and see which were <br/>
larger than our current 214.   I&#39;ve found some and will list them below.  <br/>
Maybe some of you want more input and would like to join additional groups.  <br/>
Maybe some of you are bored with this list and want a different style.  Maybe <br/>
you&#39;re just curious about what else is there.   I&#39;ll set my own comments <br/>
apart   ******this way******** and the first number there is the number of <br/>
members listed.  These numbers are probably not exactly current, because our <br/>
number was a couple of weeks old.    There were 210 groups listed, but many <br/>
of them were definitely NOT unschooling lists, and showed up because they <br/>
said so (using that term) or because they had a keywords list and unschooling <br/>
was one of their keywords (for no good reason at all).<br/>
<br/>
There was another listed for unschoolers in Colorado:  counschooling   (not  <br/>
many members, but worth mentioning in addition to the csprings group <br/>
mentioned in the previous post)<br/>

395 RUL <br/>
This is the &quot;Radical Unschoolers List&quot;. It is for all families, regardless of <br/>
religious affiliation, choosing to unschool their children. Unschooling is <br/>
child-led learning, learning as a part of life. It allows the child to learn <br/>
naturally, without adult-imposed &quot;lessons&quot;, schedules, or timelines. This <br/>
list is to offer support, information, perspective, and enlightenment to <br/>
anyone already unschooling or interested in unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
217 CCU-List <br/>
CCU stands for Christ Centered Unschooling. Unschooling is a well researched <br/>
theory which departs from the accepted norms of education in our society. <br/>
Learning should be as natural as any other life process, ie; breathing and <br/>
eating. The theory of unschooling depends on the human being&#39;s innate desire <br/>
to learn and strives to allow the individual the freedom to explore their <br/>
current areas of interest. This list was formed as a place for Christians who <br/>
are either unschooling, attempting to ... more  <br/>
<br/>
****I don&#39;t think unschooling is exactly &quot;well researched,&quot; although it&#39;s <br/>
based on various parts of well-researched learning theory rejected by public <br/>
schools...****<br/>

***THIS IS IMPORTANT, because Pennsylvania appears to be an impossible place <br/>
to unschool, but look how many people DO know how to pull it off and are <br/>
offering help!  So keep this one in mind when you&#39;re elsewhere and some new <br/>
Pennsylvania resident comes in scared and hopeless.***<br/>

Are you unschooling in Pennsylvania? Are you a relaxed or eclectic <br/>

196     AlwaysLearning <br/>
Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning All the <br/>
Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made unschooling a sweet and <br/>
viable option for thousands of families. This is a moderated group, with <br/>
trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, <br/>
but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean <br/>
more toward pure unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling <br/>
discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling ... more<br/>

144     UnschoolersCircle <br/>
The Unschoolers&#39; Circle is an inclusive list for anyone interested in home <br/>
education with unschooling leanings. Sometimes called relaxed schooling or <br/>
child-led learning or interest-led learning, unschooling encompasses <br/>
everything in your life, so our conversations range incredibly in subject <br/>
matter. You just have to check in to see what&#39;s being discussed. Like the <br/>
Round Table of Arthurian legend, we are a circle of peers. Everyone&#39;s input <br/>
is equally valuable - from the newest newbie to the ... more<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****.... there is no way a  newest newbie&#39;s input about how unschooling works <br/>
will be equally valuable to that of someone with experience.  I&#39;m always <br/>
baffled by people who say &quot;everyone&#39;s opinion is equal.&quot;  And that wasn&#39;t <br/>
true in Camelot anyway.  Arthur was still the King and Lancelot was still IT <br/>
on a stick (despite being French).****<br/>
<br/>
****So we&#39;re in the top five or six of actual discussion groups, maybe <br/>
(depends how some of those odd ones work), but in the top ten for sure of <br/>
yahoogroup lists which purport to support unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think maybe we should all just blend into large existing groups <br/>
and not divide the group further, but there&#39;s nothing keeping people from <br/>
joining all of those, so it&#39;s not like splitting a vote or building a new <br/>
building, I suppose.****<br/>
