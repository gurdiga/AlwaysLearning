<div id="ygrps-yiv-464913892">&quot;The same life can be seen from many different angles. The same situation can be seen while holding one&#39;s breath and being furious, or while seeing the alternatives and finding ways to be grateful, no matter how small, because on one small bit of gratitude, one can step up and see another one, and another.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That quote (my writing) came up in my memories. Marta Venturini had shared it on facebook in 2012.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Just Add Light to see if I had already used it.  I had, twice.  Good.<br/>
<br/>
I had saved it on a webpage on my site; good.<br/>

<br/>
I quoted in in 2016, so I won’t use it again tomorrow, I guess…<br/>
This photo is cool.  It’s from Lebanon, from an old fortress, looking out into Syria.  Unschoolers live lots of places.<br/>

While we’re examining the ruined fortress of Always Learning… my ability to cite a quote with a date may have crumbled away.<br/>
