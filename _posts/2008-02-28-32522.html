I  guess you should *not* tell this story to your friend with the ten <br/>
year  old.<br/>
********<br/>
<br/>
noooooo most definitely not! &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;  And there are so many  others who <br/>
wouldn&#39;t understand either. <br/>
 <br/>
A friend&#39;s daughter (unschooler) is 15 and has a boyfiend over 18. She been  <br/>
with him for a few years now....12 or 13.  It reminds me of what you say  <br/>
about Holly. <br/>
 <br/>
And it started as friends and just blossomed. And there&#39;s communication and  <br/>
trust and she is so mature and responsible, quite an inspiration .<br/>
 <br/>
But just mentioning the ages to some people, nothing else would matter,  they <br/>
couldn&#39;t get beyond that.<br/>
