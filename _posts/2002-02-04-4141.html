close. I always forget which Pam is Northern California and which is<br/>
Southern California, though.<br/>

Of curse, we&#39;ll be driving home through southern California, but that&#39;ll<br/>
be with a station wagon full of stuff, 2 cats, and a rat... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098393936">Hi all,<br/>
I have not posted in a while, but always enjoy the discussions. <br/>
I (and my 8 yo daughter) wanted to ask some advice/info from those of you in California, specifically the area around Palm Springs/Riverside/LA/N.of San Diego. I am taking my son to UU camp there on the 10th. Then I&#39;ll be staying with a friend a few days. After that we have about 3-4 days left to do something. We are on a very low budget and will be bringing a tent.<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if any of you know of a low-cost (or free) campground in that area, that would not be so likely to be all filled up? Any ideas for things we could do/a place to stay?<br/>
Thanks for any input!<br/>
