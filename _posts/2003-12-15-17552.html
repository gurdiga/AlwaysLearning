side of the hole to the other. Then you weave the thread over and under <br/>
those warp threads to fill it in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993954150">I used to love darning socks when I was 9-12. I asked my Mom if I could darn all of the socks. I still remember her laughing at me  when she said yes-and that was about 54 years ago. Mostly socks were all or  part wool-we lived in a rural area but my Dad managed a feed store in town.<br/>
I remember the darning &quot;egg&quot; It was red -brightly enamel painted wood. Shaped like a sturdy  mushroom with a short  rounded stem -that you could put into the fingers of woolen gloves when you memded them. The top was rounded and about 2-3 inches wide-lovely smooth and rounded-I can feel it still.<br/>
The wool  came in hanks of various colors  or my mom had small balls of black/greys/browns. It was very important that the wool match as closely as possible especially on my dads socks-he could be a tyrant.The trick was to do them before the hole got too big.<br/>
The stitch was  started a ways from the hole-if the edges were wearing but not a hole you did that first to give a firm area-You  used a weaving stitch and then crossed the gap which was centered on the  &quot;egg: and weave a ways into the  sock material on the other side of the hole, If you just turned around and went back it made a lumpy edgeYou made the weave very close and tight in the hole and feathered out on the edges so as not too make a  hard ring. No knots on the end of the wool. We had a &quot;darning basket&quot; of course and the  socks with the worst holes never seemed to make it to the top to be next. Holes in the toes are the hardest to get just right and be comfortable. sometimes you had to &quot;weave&quot; almost a whole new toe.  I learned on my own woolen winter socks and walked  on my &quot;mistakes&quot;  so  it made sense to do it right. I had to be good before I could do my dads -.<br/>
After  Allan and I were married I still darned his wool work socks but with kids it usually seemed like a chore. Havn.t darned for years-just seems easier to buy more-We still wear lots of wool socks-I wear two pairs every day in the winter  instead of slippers.<br/>
But you know what?...I have  a really nice pair of wool socks in my bottom drawer  that have the heels out. I might just show the kids some slow day this winter.<br/>

I have a wooden one, but I don&#39;t use it.  I just use my hand.<br/>
I need more light now that I&#39;m old, and I&#39;m patient enough to keep my own <br/>
tension.<br/>
<br/>
So its weaving thread over the hole.  I go three ways.  I do a zigzaggy first <br/>
pass, weave it straight across, and then finish with a diagonal pass.<br/>
<br/>
Did another one this afternoon, but it&#39;s white on white and doesn&#39;t show.<br/>

I just got home from the grocery store. While I was there I called home <br/>
and asked kids and dh if there was anything they wanted me to get. <br/>
Rosie asked for cucumbers, grapefruit juice, and sunflower seeds. Cyrus <br/>
reminded me to get toilet paper &lt;G&gt;. Rox wanted green apples. Cyrus <br/>
wanted oranges if they had any.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, got butterscotch chips to make cookies and a <br/>
bottle of cranberry juice (which I realize is loaded with sugar).<br/>
<br/>
Compared to my own past eating habits, I eat very well these days. <br/>
Compared to the rest of my family, I&#39;m the sweets-lover.<br/>
