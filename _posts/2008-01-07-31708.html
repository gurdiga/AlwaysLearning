<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927358468">When Kirby was little and watched Sesame Street lots, we would play a  <br/>
game about naming musical styles.  At first I&#39;d say what I thought it  <br/>
was, and as he got older (not much older; he was very music-eared) he  <br/>
would name them, or I&#39;d say &quot;Do you think this is jazz or swing?&quot; if  <br/>
I was undecided and he would say what he thought.  It didn&#39;t really  <br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
Neither does this.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a song by Da Vinci&#39;s Notebook called &quot;Internet Porn.&quot;  It has  <br/>
a calypso beat, but faster and jazzy.  What is that called?<br/>
And what about, in Hairspray, &quot;It&#39;s All for You?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313121986">I don&#39;t know the tunes you&#39;re referring to, so I could be complete <br/>
off, but here&#39;s my suggestion anyway:  Could it be what&#39;s called a <br/>
bossa nova, which is a Brazilian rhythm based on a samba?  Or, <br/>
perhaps it&#39;s a samba?<br/>

I went and read about those, but reading just doesn&#39;t do it.  I could  <br/>
go to Project Playlist and listen to people&#39;s lists marked samba,  <br/>
though!  That&#39;s a good idea.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270768768">That *is* a good idea to look it up on Project Playlist!  I should <br/>
have told you that the song &quot;Girl from Ipanema&quot; and many, many Jobim <br/>
tunes are typical sambas/bossas.  It&#39;s my very favorite rhythm to <br/>
play on guitar and I probably play it way too much.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think!<br/>

Love,<br/>
