<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505771384">Were the people involved in this home schooled kids?  Not from what I&#39;ve<br/>
read.  Victorino was a career criminal and to have a career in most things<br/>
you have to work at it.  That&#39;s what this guy did.  Worked at being a<br/>
criminal.  I think I would know if my sons were being criminals.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also those who flew into the twin towers and the pentagon were religious<br/>
zealots who absolutely believed they were dying for their religion.  I<br/>
remember when I emigrated to the US in 1982 and my step-father (who was in<br/>
the military at the time) was going on and on about the Russians and the<br/>
problems they posed (turns out he was wrong about that - amongst other<br/>
things he&#39;s wrong about).  My mother and I, coming from England, and being<br/>
used to hearing international news that doesn&#39;t have a US slant on it, knew<br/>
something like this would happen.  I remember saying to him &quot;you need to be<br/>
worried about the religious zealots in the middle east because they will die<br/>
for their religion unlike most Americans&quot;.. Of course he said I was wrong<br/>
about that.. Seems I wasn&#39;t..<br/>

If you need a particular example, The Deltona Murders was over an Xbox, and<br/>
the deaths contributed to a style of killing from one of the games.<br/>
Was it a games influence? Probably not as most people wouldn&#39;t emulate video<br/>
murder in real life.<br/>
Why did it happen? The debates could last forever (and have)<br/>
9/11 terrorists were said to train on a flight simulator that had the exact<br/>
pattern they flew.<br/>
In the game, you are to fly between the towers but as it&#39;s a game, you can<br/>
fly into the towers.<br/>

From The Daytona Beach News Journey<br/>
<br/>
Victorino was a career criminal. So much of his adult life was spent in<br/>
trouble, in a courtroom and then behind bars. When someone crossed him,<br/>
Victorino responded with violence. In 1996, he beat a man so severely that<br/>
doctors needed more than a dozen titanium plates to rebuild the victim&#39;s<br/>
face. The victim believes Victorino shoved a walking cane down his throat. <br/>
<br/>
In the killings of these six people, &quot;motive&quot; has been hard to pin down. <br/>
<br/>
Investigators say trouble began the day Belanger found Victorino squatting<br/>
in her grandmother&#39;s unoccupied home, across town. She removed his things --<br/>
some clothes, CDs, a video game system -- and Victorino wanted it all back. <br/>
<br/>
But a friend would later say he wanted his cocaine back. <br/>
<br/>
And others close to him would offer a deeper motive, one that cuts to the<br/>
core of what ignites a killer&#39;s rage: It was all about disrespect.<br/>
