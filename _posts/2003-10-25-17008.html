<div id="ygrps-yiv-86036972">This was printed and put on the wall where I usually leave notes for the <br/>
kids.  It was also sitting open on my computer.  This is a very candid bit by a 17 <br/>

it were to someone else for some serious purpose, I might&#39;ve suggested a few <br/>
tweaks, but it served its purpose pretty well, and gave all the good <br/>
information.   <br/>

if this messes up anything. As for shopping wise if there isn&#39;t another good <br/>

It starts at 9 AM and I plan on taking the Van. Glenn&#39;s Cell phone number is <br/>
720-8249 if you need to get a hold of me. And if you need the Van I could <br/>

It is something that only happens once a year and I think I might do well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613929544">Meeting Marty at the conference was in itself an experience.  I enjoyed talking to him and the girls do too.  I came home and told everyone that knew I went that SD&#39;s child does not seem like he has not been &quot;schooled&quot; in fact the difference being that he seemed more confident and not so unsure of himself around others.  He made friends with adults and children of all ages, he spoke well.  I was not surprised, I was impressed.  I enjoy when you share these things, thanks.  Stepheny<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4043518">ok had to do this,<br/>
lisa decided to join a newspaper for home school kids and wrote the fallowing <br/>
article. the teacher that &quot;supervises&quot; also un-schools (in Iowa you have 3 <br/>
choices and one is supervising teacher We got lucky found one that un-schools, <br/>
didnt want testing or the school to controll.)<br/>
any way  while in a desion of what to put in the paper it came up lisa does <br/>
what she wants and mom drives lots of places. I found it intersting to see her <br/>
view point.<br/>
Dee<br/>
this is her artical:<br/>
A DIIFFERENT WAY TO LEARN<br/>
                     <br/>
	<br/>
	Okay.  So people are home schooled and some are in an actual public <br/>
school.  Either way you get an education. We all know that you yourself cannot <br/>
stop yourself from learning. So in life you have all the stuff you have to <br/>
learn, well it is hard to sit at a table for some people and do work. Un-<br/>
schooling is just the opposite.  You don�t have sit at a table and do work, <br/>
unless you want to. If you want to learn a particular skill, sometimes you have <br/>
to sit like you�re in a classroom.<br/>
  Even though any unschooling is a justified way of learning it is just in a <br/>
different form.<br/>
The form is called un-schooling it is basically to learn in life. Some people�s <br/>
opinion is that it is not a way to learn, and so on and so on, but it is. That <br/>
is the way that I  learn and I have stuff at home that I do.  You still have to <br/>
challenge yourself though.<br/>
In un schooling, you don�t have to worry about catching up with every one else <br/>
but you can stick to your own pace that helps and works allot better then being <br/>
stressed and depressed.<br/>
The difference between un-schooling and curriculum is I don�t have a mini class-<br/>
 room in my home .I choose something I want to do and I do it, like I sew a <br/>
quilt.  I might learn Spanish or help plan a family vacation. I am trying to do <br/>
a presentation to my family so we can travel to Alaska [maybe by next summer.]<br/>
Another difference of un-schooling is my mom. She helps me accomplish my goals <br/>
weather it is going to the net to find out Iowa law (about how to home school) <br/>
and drives me lots of place.  My mom writes down what I do in a journal.<br/>
I make the choices what I do and learn. Only I am not allowed to �veg� in front <br/>
of the T.V. all day.<br/>
I think I am going to join the diploma program at mid prairie  home school <br/>
which means I will have to use curriculum more. {My choice] because I want the <br/>
diploma. IT seems to me that this is important and sounds like fun! IT may be <br/>
easier to get into college with one.  I was going to study for a G.E.D. <br/>
somewhere down the road.<br/>
My ultimate goal is to work in the area of helping people; like the peace core, <br/>
animal rescue, or a social worker or something that teaches one person can make <br/>
a difference then again I also like acting.   My mom says there are lots of <br/>
theaters for plays in the Iowa City area. Mom says I am 13 and I don�t need to <br/>
have my whole life mapped out but I should have fun and learn in areas I want <br/>
to learn.<br/>
I know some that say un-schooling wont work and even curriculum home schooling <br/>
wont work. I know a lot of kids that want to be home schooled either with <br/>
curriculum or not. Either way you home school,  I agree you cannot sit on your <br/>
but all day it�s not like that at all. I like being unschooled because it�s <br/>
doing what I like to do and finding ways to get there and spending time with my <br/>
family!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209169478">See?  This is great too.  These kids can read and write because they want<br/>
to.  The ones that are forced to sit are the ones that you can barely get to<br/>
write or they are trying to write in the correct format etc, their minds<br/>
don&#39;t work.  This is all the evidence I need and esp. after reading the<br/>
unprocessed child. Stepheny<br/>
