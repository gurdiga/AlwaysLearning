<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997022801">&lt;&lt;Is there a sailing line out there that lets you crew?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  I have thought of chartering a smaller boat for our family<br/>
with the stipulation being that we get to crew.  I used to have a friend<br/>
whose father had a big sail boat.  Every summer the adult children and<br/>
families came together to crew for a sail down to the Caribbean.  Thought<br/>
that sounded so cool.<br/>
