<div id="ygrps-yiv-939676105">Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
While I certainly don&#39;t want to stifle capitalism at its best, you might<br/>
consider getting some activity books to spark ideas.  We have craft books,<br/>
kids art books, 365 TV-Free Things To Do With Your Kids, 365 Outdoor<br/>
Activities To Do With Kids.  We hit state parks, leave craft supplies laying<br/>
around.<br/>
