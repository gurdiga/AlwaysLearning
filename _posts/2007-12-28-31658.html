As a homeschool parent I URGE every adult who  believes in homeschooling<br/>
to research Ron Paul for President.  He is the  only candidate I ever<br/>
listened to, that makes sense.  If we do not vote for  a candidate that<br/>
believes in homeschooling, our rights could be taken away.   He is a<br/>
strong adovacate of homeschooling.   Please no debates I just want you<br/>
to be informed  and to take a look at what he stands for.  I was amazed.<br/>
There is  hope.................   www.ronpaul2008.com<br/>

Education<br/>
The federal government does not own our children. Yet we act as if it<br/>
does by  letting it decide when, how, and what our children will learn.<br/>
We have turned  their futures over to lobbyists and bureaucrats.<br/>
<br/>
I support giving educational control back to parents, who know their<br/>
children  better than any politician in D.C. ever will.<br/>
<br/>
The federal government has no constitutional authority to fund or<br/>
control  schools. I want to abolish the unconstitutional, wasteful<br/>
Department of  Education and return its functions to the states. By<br/>
removing the federal  subsidies that inflate costs, schools can be<br/>
funded by local taxes, and parents  and teachers can directly decide how<br/>
best to allocate the resources.<br/>
<br/>
To help parents with the costs of schooling, I have introduced H.R.<br/>
1056, the  Family Education Freedom Act, in Congress. This bill would<br/>
allow parents a tax  credit of up to $5,000 (adjustable after 2007 for<br/>
inflation) per student per  year for the cost of attendance at an<br/>
elementary and/or secondary school. This  includes private, parochial,<br/>
religious, and home schools.<br/>
<br/>
Another bill I have sponsored, H.R. 1059, allows full-time elementary<br/>
and  secondary teachers a $3,000 yearly tax credit, thus easing their<br/>
financial  burden and encouraging good teachers to stay in an underpaid<br/>
profession.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents have already shown their desire to be free of federal<br/>
control by  either enrolling their children in private schools or<br/>
homeschooling them. And  students enrolled in these alternatives have<br/>
consistently performed better and  tested higher than those in state-run<br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
Years of centralized education have produced nothing but failure and <br/>
frustrated parents. We can resurrect our public school system if we<br/>
follow the  Constitution and end the federal education monopoly.<br/>
Education   [On the Issues]<br/>
Congressman  Ron Paul (R-Texas) is the leading advocate for freedom in<br/>
our nation&#39;s  capital. As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives,<br/>
Dr. Paul tirelessly  works for limited constitutional government, low<br/>
taxes, free markets, and a  return to sound monetary policies. He is<br/>
known among his congressional  colleagues and his constituents for his<br/>
consistent voting record. Dr. Paul never  votes for legislation unless<br/>
the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the  Constitution.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475471954">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been many days since I said on this list that I  <br/>
didn&#39;t want political discussion on this list.<br/>
I said it for years before that, too, but even people who joined  <br/>
lately should&#39;ve seen it a week or two back.<br/>
<br/>
This list has readers and contributors in Canada, the U.K., France,  <br/>
New Zealand, Australia and probably other places too.<br/>
<br/>
It is NOT worth any of their few minutes even to get such an e-mail.   <br/>
For those who want to read and discuss politics, the internet is  a  <br/>
rich, full place.  Keep it off this list.<br/>
