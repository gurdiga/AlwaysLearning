<br/>
Another thing to remember is to make it ALL happy and funny and<br/>
comfortable and exciting so that they want to be with you. Be sparkly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a mostly-lurker and I&#39;m often several days behind in reading here. I<br/>
just<br/>
read the above and it jumped out at me bigtime. I&#39;ve never thought about<br/>
being<br/>
sparkly but this made sense to me immediately. Yes. Right. Be sparkly. That<br/>
encapsulates everything I&#39;ve been thinking about and working on this year (I<br/>
posted<br/>
here last summer about having started off as an unschooler when my oldest<br/>
was<br/>
little but drifting away as more kids came along, and then<br/>
re-discovering/immersing<br/>
in unschooling and making a big change back toward &quot;yes&quot; over the summer).<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I have kept telling myself these past six/eight months as<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
struggled to hold on to YES is to lighten up, relax, stop worrying about<br/>
what other<br/>
people think of us or how the kids will turn out and just have fun NOW, all<br/>
of us<br/>
together. I have this little mantra I think to myself over and over: Be fun,<br/>
be fun.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be sparkly&quot; is even more fun to say. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I admit &quot;being fun&quot; doesn&#39;t come as easily to me as I wish it did, or as it<br/>
did<br/>
when I only had one or two kids. I have five children, ages 2 to 12, and<br/>
sometimes<br/>
it feels hard to be fun when I&#39;m trying to juggle the logistics of keeping<br/>
everyone<br/>
safe and pleasant. (Pleasant for others to be around, I mean. They are<br/>
awesome<br/>
kids. But we are a big noisy pack and I do feel like I am always on guard<br/>
lest we<br/>
annoy someone or break something.)<br/>
<br/>
I can tell when I&#39;m being fun, because those are the good days, good weeks,<br/>
and<br/>
the kids do want to be with me all the time. I&#39;m not always fun, though. I<br/>
fall back<br/>
into patterns of speech, ways of behaving, that I wish I&#39;d never learned:<br/>
issuing<br/>
curt orders, lecturing. I am trying so hard to knock it off permanently! But<br/>
it&#39;s like<br/>
quitting biting my nails (another bad habit): I&#39;m good about it when I&#39;m<br/>
paying attention,<br/>
but I find myself gnawing away when I&#39;m not being mindful. But I&#39;m not aware<br/>
that I<br/>
*wasn&#39;t* paying attention until I start paying attention again!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Make it all happy and funny and comfortable and exciting so they want to be<br/>
with<br/>
you.&quot; I think that&#39;s the best mothering advice I&#39;ve ever seen. The hard part<br/>
is the &quot;all.&quot;<br/>

Thanks.  Maybe I could rephrase it without the &quot;all&quot; and put it on  <br/>
the random quotes generator at<br/>

keeping everyone safe and pleasant. -=<br/>
<br/>
I remember a couple of times when we needed to do something very  <br/>
quietly or I wanted one kid to go into a room where someone was  <br/>
sleeping and get something, saying &quot;Do it like a burglar.&quot;   It&#39;s  <br/>
kind of fun to try to do something silently.  Sometimes if I want to  <br/>
make eggs in the morning I need to get a pan from a pile of pans.   <br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s silent and sometimes it&#39;s just quiet.  But it&#39;s fun to  <br/>
try.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can tell when I&#39;m being fun, because those are the good days,  <br/>
good weeks,-==<br/>
<br/>
Even a good moment is worth trying, though.  One good moment in a  <br/>
rough hour is better than a rough hour without a good moment.<br/>
<br/>
-=I&#39;m not always fun, though.  I fall back into patterns of speech,  <br/>
ways of behaving, that I wish I&#39;d never learned: issuing curt orders,  <br/>

<br/>
Me too. Few totally overcome falling back into being their moms  <br/>
occasionally.  The difference between really being that, though, and  <br/>
being the way we&#39;d rather be is how we feel when we&#39;re there, and  <br/>
what we do to recover from it and make up with our kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667989713">I love this sparkly stuff!  All I can do is picture myself as a little  <br/>
sprite with wings going around with my little feather duster and  <br/>
swishing sparkly fun all over our lives!  For me that just sounds so  <br/>
much more appealing than &quot;note to self: be more fun&quot;  :D<br/>
