&lt;&lt; Oh brother!  I&#39;m really asleep at the wheel here!  I meant to say that I <br/>
 use flaxseed MEAL in my baking, not the oil.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH!! I sent of the last email without reading this Marji!! I was scratching <br/>
my head thinking &quot;why would Marji recomend heating flax seed oil?&quot; LOL<br/>
I just KNEW you wouldn&#39;t do that.....<br/>
I like mixing some flax seed meal in with my yogurt. I buy plain yogurt and <br/>
mix honey and flax in for a rather crunchy version. :)<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
