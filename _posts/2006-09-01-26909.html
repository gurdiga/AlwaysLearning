<div id="ygrps-yiv-706592277">Hi Sandra,<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you decided not to do the show.  I&#39;ve only watched a time or two, but in the show I saw, the visiting mom really connected with the kids, and when the real mom came back she was devistated.<br/>
 <br/>
I was trying to think of how you would be able to show unschooling - or how the mom visiting your family could possibly understand.  Through my many years, even with people that know us, and the kids, they still can&#39;t believe that the kids make their own decisions.  If there were some kind of discussion about your background, or beliefs, or something - but what I saw was alot of torment and drama.  And it seems to me it is that kind of behaviour that we have really chosen to stay away from, when the family is flowing, communicating and being respectful of each other.<br/>
 <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be grand if there were a series of shows that would tape your own family, and let you answer and explain what you are thinking and how it all works?<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Wifeswap is decidedly gentler in it&#39;s approach from what we&#39;ve seen.<br/>
Trevor showed me a video from TS that showed one of the Mums reuniting<br/>
with her family. She was EVIL to me....stomping around, screaming<br/>
about being a &quot;God Warrior&quot; and acting so incredibly hateful. I guess<br/>
the other family had a buddha statue (oh horrors). She was the most<br/>
hateful, scary woman. Freaked all of us out.<br/>

That particular video of that particular woman became famous. The day after<br/>
the show aired, the part where that woman went crazy was all over the<br/>
internet. It even made it in some national news. It was SO sad I thought...I<br/>
felt so bad for both the woman and her family who in the video watched<br/>
helplessly as she lost it. She later told of how mortified she was of her<br/>
behavior, and how she recognized she went crazy, and that she had just never<br/>
been so scared in her life after losing her family to another way of life.<br/>
<br/>
Though I had no sympathy for her point of view or way of life :o/<br/>
<br/>
One show is gentler than the other, not so divisive, and actually showed<br/>
some neat stuff some of us here thought, but I thought it was TS. Can&#39;t<br/>
remember for sure, but some people here really liked the gentler show for a<br/>
while.<br/>

<br/>
On Trading Spouses, the trick ending is that each family gets $50,000  <br/>
worth of something, but it&#39;s of the visiting mom&#39;s choosing.  The  <br/>
outgoing mom dictates how their money will be spent.  Once one said a  <br/>
hot tub, I think, and they&#39;ve specified things like clothes-shopping- <br/>
spree for teen girls, or music equipment.  Things the other family  <br/>
might not have wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said one mom tore the whole agreement/letter up and was wanting  <br/>
to refuse the things the other family&#39;s mom wanted for them.  (Was it  <br/>
that gone-crazy mom maybe?)<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it&#39;s a a show about control, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
(Both of them are, I mean)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819630429">I love watching the show (Wife Swap) but I would never ever be on it myself.<br/>
 The families are always so completely opposite.  A lot of the time I see<br/>
one family being a homeschool family... very family oriented with SAHMs and<br/>
the other family very work oriented where both parent work full-time and<br/>
even put their kids in daycare on their days off. <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve seen Trading Spouses but not in some time.  I think I remember<br/>
it being gentler... I believe the moms leave giving gifts to their host<br/>
family in a letter or something.  Like there&#39;s so much money that they are<br/>
allowed to allocate through the family.<br/>
<br/>
I know that Wife Swap always makes me appreciate my family even more after I<br/>
watch it.<br/>
