<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918854234">Hi. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted before -- just been reading. I&#39;ve been <br/>
homeschooling for quite a while now (my eldest is 14) and have been an <br/>
unschooler, at least until recently. John Holt, etc. (When we moved to <br/>
this area, we joined a large &quot;co-op&quot; to make the homeschooling social <br/>
connections -- this is where everyone was! --, but this &quot;term&quot; are <br/>
dropping out. One reason is it&#39;s school-y nature makes it hard for my <br/>
kids to seek their own learning bliss -- they just hopped a ride on the <br/>
parents&#39; interests and had a pretty good time, but no time left for <br/>
their self-directed learning, after homework(!!) etc. ).<br/>
<br/>
My problem is, I&#39;ve got a new school district that watches more closely <br/>
than my old one. And my kids are getting older, so schools aren&#39;t as <br/>
flexible. Or at least, that&#39;s how I perceive it.<br/>
<br/>
When I talk to other unschoolers about the science area, they remind me <br/>
how you get science all the time in nature, etc. But I haven&#39;t got kids <br/>
who are interested in getting out in nature. I&#39;ve got kids who are <br/>
arachnaphobic, and afraid of stinging insects. They&#39;ve got a mom who <br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy hiking around in the cold (when the insects don&#39;t <br/>
abound). Science isn&#39;t my area of expertise, to say the least -- I went <br/>
to a college with no distribution requirements so I could avoid it -- <br/>
but I do very much enjoy reading stuff out loud, or listening to them <br/>
read, on subjects related to science. How our world works. Animal <br/>
stuff. Biographies, etc. They like some of this too -- kids books, <br/>
mostly -- but after a while, it can get a little old.<br/>
<br/>
We bought a large group of DiscoverySchool books (mag. format, clips of <br/>
this and that for a whole issue on one topic). They have a dynamic <br/>
format. We have the Oak Meadow science curriculum (these guys wanted <br/>
the whole curriculum this year -- we used to just use them for Math) -- <br/>
Wait! Don&#39;t hang up because I said the C-word! If these guys want to <br/>
structure themselves, I&#39;m not going to stand in the way. But as usual, <br/>
they liked them for about 2 months, then it was &quot;yuck, this is boring!&quot; <br/>
and that was the end of that.<br/>
<br/>
If I were you, I might say -- &quot;any science-type classes around your <br/>
area that your kids want to sign up for?&quot; -- Lots of classes, kids <br/>
aren&#39;t interested. Science Museum? One of the best. Kids aren&#39;t <br/>
interested (&quot;been there, done that&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I need both ideas and an unschooling boost, if anyone can help <br/>
with that. I look at school curricula at this age level (I&#39;m mainly <br/>
concerned with the &quot;8th Grader&quot;) -- World Book guide, on-line stuff, <br/>
Oak Meadow -- and they seem to be covering Earth Science, etc. in <br/>
depth. This is a daughter who really wants to go to college to be a <br/>
children&#39;s librarian, at least, she&#39;s wanted to do that for a long <br/>
time. So at some point, we&#39;ve got to deal with requirements, even if <br/>
our school district is relaxed this year (doubtful -- but I do know my <br/>
rights). I don&#39;t want to do any of this stuff. I don&#39;t want to make <br/>
anyone do anything. I don&#39;t want to &quot;teach&quot; anything. I want us to just <br/>
live our lives, read whatever, do what it seems other unschoolers do: <br/>
find sparks and run with them. Like we used to when they were littler.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;re kind of not like that part. We find sparks and like them just <br/>
for being sparks, and the depth part never happens. And we&#39;re getting <br/>
to ages where the depth part starts being part of the picture. We&#39;ve <br/>
got loads of depth in literature and &quot;social studies&quot; quite naturally <br/>
by our interests. So that brings us back to how to interact with &quot;the <br/>
subject of science&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I haven&#39;t broken any written or unwritten codes by posting such <br/>
a long query. Thanks so much just for reading all the way through it! <br/>
Any input would be welcome, though I definitely am not looking for <br/>
criticism!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017942102">-=-My problem is, I&#39;ve got a new school district that watches more closely  <br/>
than my old one. And my kids are getting older, so schools aren&#39;t as  <br/>

 <br/>
What state are you in?  <br/>
 <br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
When I  talk to other unschoolers about the science area, they remind me <br/>
how you  get science all the time in nature, etc. But I haven&#39;t got kids <br/>
who are  interested in getting out in nature. I&#39;ve got kids who are <br/>
arachnaphobic,  and afraid of stinging insects. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a lot to science besides bugs and trees.<br/>
Maybe you-the-mom should spend some time, quietly (don&#39;t let the kids know  <br/>
you&#39;re worried, if you are) exploring what&#39;s science, and what&#39;s out  there.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I do very much enjoy reading stuff out loud, or listening to them  <br/>
read, on subjects related to science. How our world works. Animal <br/>
stuff.  Biographies, etc. They like some of this too -- kids books, <br/>
mostly -- but  after a while, it can get a little old.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t limit yourself to books.  It DOES get old that way.  You  have the <br/>
internet, there are videos and DVDs, kid-level musicians, &quot;kitchen  chemistry&quot; <br/>
stuff (like glop and fake blood and playdough), weather tracking,  stuff with ice <br/>
(if you live where it&#39;s freezing, set water out in different  kinds of <br/>
containers and pull the ice out in the morning--we had some GREAT  crystal stuff <br/>
hanging down the other day).  Feed birds.  Feel your  cat, look at a cat <br/>
skeleton.  Rocks?  Earthquakes.  Stars?   Full moons.   Do you have a fireplace?<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t stall out and make life small expecting everything to come from  books.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Wait! Don&#39;t hang up because I said the C-word! If these guys want to  <br/>
structure themselves, I&#39;m not going to stand in the way. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
You could have made your life wider and wilder so they would NOT want to  <br/>
structure themselves.  I think it&#39;s a waste of money to buy a curriculum  because <br/>
it&#39;s more interesting or promising than your homelife.  With very  little <br/>
cash outlay, just make your homelife more interesting than any  curriculum.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
That might help.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-But as usual, <br/>
they liked them for about 2 months, then it was &quot;yuck,  this is boring!&quot; <br/>
and that was the end of that.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;As usual&quot;?<br/>
You&#39;ve tried that before and it failed before?<br/>
Don&#39;t try it anymore.  It&#39;s not a good use of cash, time or  energy.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Science Museum? One of the best. Kids aren&#39;t <br/>
interested (&quot;been  there, done that&quot;).<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I think maybe if you went there to play (&quot;YOU&quot; you the mom went there to  <br/>
play) the kids might have fun too.  If you&#39;re going there because it&#39;s  <br/>
educational, how can you expect them to have fun?  Did you treat it like a  kid thing?  <br/>
If you treat it like a REAL, human, interesting thing, that  might be contagio<br/>
us.  But if you&#39;ve already dulled it out by prior  behaviors or expectations <br/>
or requirements, it will take a few visits for them to  see you really liking <br/>
it.  And there should be several visits anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-This is a daughter who really wants to go to college to be a  <br/>
children&#39;s librarian, at least, she&#39;s wanted to do that for a long <br/>
time.  So at some point, we&#39;ve got to deal with requirements-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It would be more useful to get her an opportunity to help at the  library.  <br/>
Maybe she won&#39;t want to do that if she actually does it  some.  Maybe she WILL. <br/>
 But if you see it as a thing that requires  pre-requisites and college, as  <br/>
far-future thing instead of a &quot;now&quot; thing,  it&#39;s not a real, dynamic part of <br/>
her.  Does she organize the books at  home?  Does she know or care where books <br/>
come from and does she look at the  publication details and credits in the <br/>
first few pages of books she reads?   Does she REALLY have an interest or has <br/>
someone asked her what she would like to  be when she grows up and she picked <br/>
something to have a response?<br/>
 <br/>
I think the best response to &quot;what do you want to be&quot; is &quot;I don&#39;t  know.&quot;  <br/>
Too many kids lock into something because their relatives want them  to.  I <br/>
would discourage her from having chosen so early, and keep showing  her the world <br/>
(and particularly the library world, and bookstore  world).<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I don&#39;t want to do any of this stuff.-=-<br/>

If you think of your life as &quot;have to,&quot; and if you think of homeschooling  as <br/>
&quot;have to&quot; you&#39;re poisoning your own well.<br/>

 <br/>
Too much &quot;book&quot; in your post and not enough talk and play and  explore.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you had really done it fully when they were littler, I think you&#39;d be  <br/>
better at doing it when they were older.  But it&#39;s not too late to get it  if it <br/>
didn&#39;t really catch hold before.<br/>

Most of the work that needs to be done is mom-work.  Changing  expectations <br/>
and mood and joy level.  Enjoy what you&#39;re doing today.   Don&#39;t make today a <br/>
drudgery-loaded investment in potential joy tomorrow.<br/>

 <br/>
-=-And we&#39;re getting <br/>

 <br/>
No, depth grows naturally inside if you/mom keep the world aswirl.<br/>
 <br/>
If you knew and believed that math can be learned naturally, you would  <br/>
believe it about science.  But you made an exception of math, and that made  a rule <br/>
of exceptions.  You don&#39;t yet live by the principle that learning  can happen <br/>
naturally.  But you can move toward that if you want to.   You can&#39;t move <br/>
toward it by telling the kids to.   You have to go  first.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-Any input would be welcome, though I definitely am not looking for  <br/>
criticism!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I had written everything above before I got to that.  It makes me  grumpy <br/>
that you wrote it, after I spent as much time as I did writing things I  really <br/>
thought would help your children and you have a much happier and  <br/>
learning-filled life, and sharing so many things I&#39;ve written.<br/>
 <br/>
If you want a list where people say &quot;Ooooh, you&#39;re doing *just* the right  <br/>
things!  Keep doing what you&#39;re doing!&quot;  I&#39;m sure they&#39;re out  there.  Would <br/>
strangers making you  feel better for thirty  seconds help your kids this <br/>
afternoon?  You are going to have to look at  what you&#39;re doing that could change if <br/>
you&#39;re going to get out of your stuck  place.<br/>
 <br/>
This list can be VERY helpful, but only if you&#39;re willing to consider that  <br/>
you might be doing things that are counter-productive.  You already know  that, <br/>
though.<br/>

<br/>
Do you have a fireplace?**<br/>
<br/>
(that reminds me!) <br/>
We got dry ice that was part of the packing materials for a perishable food Xmas present we received.  Much fun was had with the dry ice.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that comes to mind for &quot;high interest&quot; science, that is popular here is &quot;Mythbusters&quot; on the Discovery channel.  They do (mostly) dangerous and destructive experiments to see whether urban legends could be true.  (e.g. Can someone be decapitated if they jump up into a fan blade?)  I would think this would be most appropriate/appealing for kids over the age of 7 or 8.)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve always had a sneaking desire to be a children&#39;s librarian myself.  I would think that this kid might conceivably be interested in going through the science section in the children&#39;s library and seeing what they&#39;ve got, and maybe looking at the books, as books, at figuring out which ones have the best content, are the most appealing, etc.  Kind of like a book reviewer.  <br/>
<br/>
The internet has piles of websites put together by scientists, AND it has websites put together by children&#39;s librarians with book recommendations.  (I also like many of the resources in Rebecca Rupp&#39;s book _The Complete Home Learning Source Book_.  She reviews more than books -- lots of kits and games, and some videos.) <br/>
<br/>
A  budding librarian may find it fun to go to every branch of the library within a convenient radius.  I would!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about DVDs? My son caught a very interesting program on &quot;string <br/>
theory&quot; on PBS, that he was fascinated by, which prompted me to <br/>
order a bunch of DVDs (used mostly, pretty cheap!)off Amazon.com. I <br/>
got one called &quot;HyperSpace&quot; basically &quot;this is how the world is goig <br/>
to end&quot; futuristic stuff, how stars are born and die, etc...a 4 DVD <br/>
series called, I think, The Blue Planet, all about sea creatures and <br/>
animals, underwater stuff, etc., just got another one today in the <br/>
mail called The Amazing Earth, i think its about earthquakes, <br/>
volcanoes, etc. My suggestion would be to get a couple DVDs that <br/>
look interesting to you, pop them in and maybe some kids will watch. <br/>
(I *wouldnt* recommend saying &quot;Look i got some science DVDs to <br/>
satisfy the science curriculum requirement, lets watch it right <br/>
now!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
On Animal Planet, they have tons of shows that are &quot;sciency&quot;,nature <br/>
oriented that are very entertaining. There&#39;s one show that pits two <br/>
(virtual)animals against one another (example, who would win in a <br/>
fight between a shark and a hippo? Or between a cheetah and a <br/>
gorilla)and they really figure it out, using physics, zoology, and <br/>
computer graphics. Very cool. <br/>
<br/>
Discovery Health channel also has many programs that explore the <br/>
human body, and all the weird things that can happen to people and <br/>
the surgery they may need to correct it. When we&#39;re home i usually <br/>
turn it to either Animal Planet or Discovery Health, or sometimes <br/>
National Geographic Channel and just leave it on, something <br/>
interesting is bound to come on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325729451">Thanks, Sandra, for all your time and thoughtfulness. I was hoping for positive <br/>
suggestions and got quite a bunch. I realize I only gave snippets of what&#39;s going on, so <br/>
you&#39;d have to make some assumptions based on that. Some were correct, some weren&#39;t, <br/>
but I can sort through it. FYI, my daughter is volunteering at 2 libraries already and does <br/>
organize her shelves, etc., so it&#39;s not one of those &quot;I want to be a fireman and a ballet <br/>
dancer&quot; kind of answers!<br/>
<br/>
You hit the nail on the head with some of the mom attitude stuff, though not competely <br/>
fairly -- but you can&#39;t know that, based on what I wrote. Never approached a museum as <br/>
&quot;educational,&quot; nor most of our activities at a young age. The division has come in more as <br/>
they&#39;ve got older and I felt the need to explain why I wanted the TV off etc., and I&#39;d like to <br/>
work on erasing it. <br/>
<br/>
Will definitely read the links you gave me. Thanks again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696110862">Thanks for the ideas, Betsy. You&#39;ve definitely got her pegged in terms of her book interest. <br/>
It&#39;s a little tough for her to look through the science section &#39;cause the arachnophobia is <br/>
real -- not just a minor thing. And spiders are everywhere you turn on the science shelves <br/>
(if you start looking for them, you&#39;ll be amazed!) But will poke around on the web more per <br/>
your suggestions. Thanks --<br/>

Work on erasing what?<br/>

Erasing your need to explain?<br/>
Erasing the TV?<br/>
Erase wanting the TV off?<br/>

I&#39;d go with the third one if you&#39;re undecided.<br/>
If it&#39;s the second one, you could practice explaining to us why you want  the <br/>

I could&#39;ve guessed wrong again.  That&#39;s okay.  Lots of people are  reading <br/>

have been the best monthly subscriptions we have ever had.<br/>

help save money without going through deprivation:<br/>
What can you sell on ebay or at resale shops? Its amazing what other <br/>
folks will buy. If nothing else you can cycle though your wardrobes each <br/>
year and sell at the resale shops what you did not wear the year <br/>
before...resale is also a great way to buy  clothes.<br/>
Can you ask family to give the boys &quot;extras&quot; as birthday and Christmas <br/>
presents next year? Its also a good way to get magazine subscriptions.<br/>
Netflix is cheaper then renting videos (of course the library is even <br/>
cheaper) in the long run (at least for me...late fees) and Gamefly.com <br/>
has saved us TONS of money on (non-returnable) video games that ds would <br/>
have hated after he spent $50 on them.<br/>
Have you reached out to your local homeschool group/homeschool friends? <br/>
There maybe things you can barter with other moms. What do you do for <br/>
the non-profit? Could you do that for others who in turn could provide <br/>
you with services you might need? I know my &quot;only&quot; child would enjoy a <br/>
weekly visit from another kid...you might find a mom who needs to switch <br/>
off days for a job. For that matter I have heard of single moms <br/>
&quot;sharing&quot; a house as a way to make ends meet...if you can find someone <br/>
who fits into you and your kids lifestyle. Rent a room to a college student?<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could think of other things......<br/>
We live on less then what you did, but I don&#39;t know what we would do if <br/>
dh died. I know we have enough insurance to pay off the house but that&#39;s <br/>
about it.<br/>

<br/>
Our house is actually pretty inexpensive considering our area.  We<br/>
bought it 10 years ago and the mortgage is less that what we would pay<br/>
in rent for a townhouse -- or even a mortgage on a townhouse.  Housing<br/>
prices in DC are through the roof -- luckily I&#39;m not out having to buy<br/>
a house right now. If it came to that. I would have to leave the area.<br/>
 Another possibility is renting out my basement which is finished and<br/>
can easily be converted to a one bedroom apartment.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
basement apartments are very popular with young proefssionals<br/>
(teachers in particular) and rent for as high as $850 per month.         <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;trading in expensive vehicles for new/cheaper ones,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Danny had just purchased a Hybrid Fuel Toyota in October.  My name is<br/>
not on the title or the loan -- I want to get rid of it because the<br/>
payments are $520 per month.  I can&#39;t do anything right now because<br/>
I&#39;m still waiting for death certificates and Toyota won&#39;t even deal<br/>
with me until I can present one.  I&#39;m torn between a voluntary<br/>
repossession and a private sale.  My van is relatively new (2003) --<br/>
and it&#39;s reliable, not fancy -- smaller payment.     <br/>
<br/>
 cutting back on lots of convenience things that come with a 100K <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lifestyle (just making assumptions here, YMMV)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oooh yeahhh we sure threw a lot of money around. We weren&#39;t<br/>
extravagant -- but we didn&#39;t make the kids wait for things that they<br/>
wanted, we took nice vacations, bought stuff we liked, but didn&#39;t<br/>
really need, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What can you sell on ebay or at resale shops? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How does eBay work?  It seems kind of difficult, but maybe that&#39;s just<br/>
me.  I really do need to learn it because there is a lot of stuff here<br/>
that I do need to clear out -- and some of it would fetch a nice penny<br/>
on eBay.  Are there any tutorials where I could safely learn how it<br/>
works? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Good idea -- They&#39;ve already pitched in to buy an XBox for them.    <br/>

<br/>
Is gamefly.com like netflix?  We&#39;d just given up Netflix because we<br/>
weren&#39;t watching the movies and it seemed like an easy expense to cut.<br/>
 Gamefly, however, might be worth it since my kids will master a $50<br/>
game in a couple of days -- then want more.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve given me a lot of great ideas and a feast of food for thought.<br/>
 Thank you! <br/>

forums where you can ask questions of other sellers and buyers.<br/>

just spending too much money on games he either hated once he got them <br/>
OR had late fees from renting games he did not want to return.<br/>

<br/>
**They&#39;ve made it very simple. If you go to their website and click on<br/>
&#39;sell&#39; there&#39;s a section called &#39;getting started&#39; that explains it all.<br/>
Basically you set up an account and fill out an online form describing the<br/>
item, your shipping rate and selling policies, and how long you want the<br/>
auction to last.  Within minutes you can get an auction started.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend posting a clear picture of the item.  When I&#39;m looking<br/>
for something I tend to skip the ones with no photo if there are more than a<br/>
few available.  Do a search for what you want to sell so you can get an idea<br/>
of the prices people are getting for similar items.  I usually give a &#39;buy<br/>
it now&#39; option, and people use it pretty often.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been selling and buying on ebay for years with very few problems (2<br/>
that I can think of, and one was my own fault for not reading feedback).<br/>
It&#39;s definitely worth the effort.  Good luck :0).  ~Rue<br/>
