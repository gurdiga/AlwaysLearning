<div id="ygrps-yiv-419488868">When I was building that, it involved opening every page so I could  <br/>
lift the URL from the browser.  I saw pages I had forgotten about, and  <br/>
things I hadn&#39;t seen before.   I think everyone should go and play  <br/>
with that for at least a few pages.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of Joyce&#39;s unschooling site over mine is that hers is  <br/>
organized in such a way that someone can read the whole thing and know  <br/>
it&#39;s been done.   Mine&#39;s purposely maze-like and swirly.<br/>
<br/>
The disadvantage of Joyces might be that someone would look at the  <br/>
title of a page, on her menu, and think it wouldn&#39;t apply. I kept  <br/>
thinking that just about every page would apply to ANY unschooling  <br/>
question or problem or &quot;stuckness.&quot;   The concepts and principles are  <br/>
woven throughout all of what Joyce has written and collected.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you&#39;re pretty sure you know Joyce&#39;s site well, go and check  <br/>
that out.  I bet you&#39;ll find something you can use, or that will help  <br/>
answer a question that&#39;s been asked this week or will be asked next  <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
One way unschoolers can help each other is to provide links to already- <br/>
saved discussions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755491186">That was really fun, and what a wonderful gift.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really enjoying these randomizers.  I visit Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s  <br/>
sites a lot when I have a question or need an idea and I click on  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s randomizer a few times before I continue with my search (and  <br/>
now I get to play with one at Joyce&#39;s site, too).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you both.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829751993">If people are on the randomizer at my page, there&#39;s usually a link at  <br/>
the bottom of the page to go back to the main unschooling page.<br/>
<br/>
On Joyce&#39;s, you can click the header on any page (where it says  <br/>
&quot;Joyfully Rejoycing&quot; up top) and that takes you to the main page, if  <br/>
you need it.   Joyce&#39;s site is set up with the index on EVERY page, so  <br/>
you might not need it but it&#39;s nice to know &quot;square one,&quot; and that  <br/>
it&#39;s always available.<br/>

relevant and interesting.  The ideas are all interconnected.  The<br/>
randomizer sure helps that come through!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That was fun!  I read quite a few things I&#39;d totally forgotten about!</div>
