<br/>
We&#39;ve registered in New Hampshire since we began three years ago, <br/>
mostly because of the perks of having that letter from the school <br/>
department.  All we need to do is send a &quot;letter of intent to <br/>
homeschool&quot;, and at the end of the year either do at-home testing, <br/>
or portfolio evaluation (our choice).  &quot;<br/>

This is really useful Traci.  I thought you had to submit a curriculum in NH??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oopsie - my bad, Retta. We do have to submit a<br/>
curriculum, but it&#39;s pretty flexible.  For Caillean&#39;s<br/>
first year being HSed, I sent in a letter of intent<br/>
with a separate three page curriculum.  However, this <br/>
is what I sent in this year - <br/>

Dear Sir,<br/>
<br/>
We recently moved here from Rochester, New Hampshire,<br/>
and would like to notify you that we intend to<br/>
homeschool our daughter in Grade 3 during the<br/>
2003-2004 school year.<br/>
<br/>
    	Caillean York<br/>

	Newmarket, NH 03857<br/>
    	DOB: *********<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the public library, local museums,<br/>
homeschool support groups, and other local resources<br/>
our curriculum may include the following:<br/>
<br/>
	Excel Math Curriculum for Grade 3<br/>
        The Writing Road to Reading by Romalda Bishop <br/>
                Spalding and Walter T. Spalding<br/>
        Science Smart by Gwen Diehn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am also working on a literacy program, �I read 100<br/>
books!� for local homeschoolers, much in the spirit of<br/>
the Somersworth school system.<br/>
<br/>
However, we reserve the right to change or replace<br/>
curriculum materials at any time in order that we<br/>
might achieve the desired academic goals while being<br/>
responsive to our daughter&#39;s needs and abilities.  <br/>
<br/>
We look forward to receiving your written<br/>
acknowledgement. Should you have any questions or<br/>
comments, we can be reached at the above address and<br/>
phone number. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Traci York<br/>
<br/>
&lt;/quote&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I sent in a separate one for my son, and I received<br/>
back a simple one page letter, acknowledging I was<br/>
HSing both for this year, and wishing me well.  I then<br/>
took the letter to Staples on Teacher Appreciation<br/>
day, and got a neat goodie bag filled with supplies...<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for the record, I don&#39;t own anything listed in<br/>
my curriculum.  They were suggested by other HSers on<br/>
some other list, and they sounded interesting. <br/>
Chances are very good that we&#39;ll never end up using<br/>
them...  *bigevilgrin*<br/>
