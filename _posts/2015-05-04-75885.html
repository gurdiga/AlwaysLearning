She has also read tons of fan fiction and has done a lot of role play online on Instagram with other series fans.<br><br>She has now started to write her first short story a couple days ago. This is her first little draft. She was gone all day Saturday pretty much and wrote a bit yesterday.&nbsp;<br><br>Sorry it is all in one block. I will help her when she is done. I do not want to interfere right now and make it about the format , grammar or punctuation. It is about the story she is wants to tell.
