<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714104745">I was intrigued by the idea that people may treat their homeschooled boy<br/>
differently from their homeschooled girl.<br/>
<br/>
NOW, I am not saying that there are not gender differences between people<br/>
(siblings or not), but I try to meet each of my children&#39;s needs as they<br/>
are.<br/>
Given that they are different people, of course they will have different<br/>
needs at different times, be into different things, have different<br/>
interests, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are times that we have to prioritize one set of needs over<br/>
another, temporarily or negotiate compromises.  Sometimes this just has to<br/>
do with the realities of<br/>
time and money, or legalities (e.g. my 15 yo son would have been driving<br/>
when he was 14, if not for the law).  But I can&#39;t say that gender<br/>
differences have ever been first in my<br/>
mind, other than when arranging the bathroom for their use when they first<br/>
began to use the toilet.  We had to make sure that the toilet seat had an<br/>
insert all of the time for my daughter, my son only needed it sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Am I just not thinking right?  I believe that my boy and girl are<br/>
different, in part because they are different genders, but I think if we<br/>
just work to know our children and keep working<br/>
at providing support and partnership in life and learning, wouldn&#39;t the<br/>
gender related stuff just work itself out?<br/>

I totally agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
There was (probably still is) one Christian homeschooling curriculum that had different courses for boys and girls.  The girls&#39; was called Far Beyond Rubies, I think and I don&#39;t know the boys&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
Individuals are individuals. <br/>

with &#39;restoring Godly womanhood and manhood&#39; or some such.  Even if I were<br/>
looking for curriculum, it would NOT be for that purpose...<br/>
