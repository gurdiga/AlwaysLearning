<div id="ygrps-yiv-164367750">I&#39;m hoping some people here can write this in other notations.  Maybe  <br/>
formal logic, or a computer language or some mathematical way.  I woke  <br/>
up thinking this, about unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
Just because you don&#39;t have to do everything doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t  <br/>
have to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
And I tried to go back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Just because you don&#39;t have to provide everything doesn&#39;t mean you  <br/>
don&#39;t have to provide anything.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to read a magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I kept thinking &quot;Just because you don&#39;t have to everything doesn&#39;t  <br/>
mean you don&#39;t have to do anything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the &quot;have to&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;HAVE TO&quot; to survive, or have to to stay out  <br/>
of trouble.    It&#39;s an if/then.  If you want unschooling to work, you  <br/>
have to do things, provide things, spend money, invest time.  The  <br/>
&quot;have to&quot; is altogether choice, as no one &quot;has to&quot; make unschooling  <br/>
work.   There&#39;s a school right down the road.<br/>
<br/>
Just because there&#39;s not a required checklist of the projects,  <br/>
materials, costs and manhours doesn&#39;t mean that amount will or can be  <br/>
zero.<br/>
<br/>
Help clarifying this would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724381107">sanda- i woke up thinking of different things but related i think....<br/>
<br/>
i was thinking about the &quot;deficit model&quot; - although i think i should  <br/>
find another phrase bc i don&#39;t think i&#39;m using that phrase as its  <br/>
officially intended....<br/>
<br/>
but what i&#39;m getting at is that you don&#39;t have to do with out, to have  <br/>
something more, necessarily.....  and that whole idea that  &quot;you  <br/>
should do without certain things, and you&#39;ll still be &quot;ok, and even  <br/>
better!!!&quot;&quot;<br/>
for me this comes up from someone posting on my blog <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://perpetualjoy.blogspot.com/-">http://perpetualjoy.blogspot.com/-</a> <br/>
  i was experiencing an internal joy of how glad i was that i didn&#39;t  <br/>
go the waldorf way and instead embraced &quot;the plastic junk&quot;  in  <br/>
conjunction w/ the wooden toy route. This happiness for me was caught  <br/>
in my mind as i was watching two girls (6 and 7) play for hours and  <br/>
hours with all this &quot;Stuff&quot; and how facilitating and amazing it was  <br/>
for them to have such access.<br/>
<br/>
maybe i&#39;m going backwards from your thoughts...... or maybe i&#39;m on a  <br/>
different thought track....<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m just reminded that facilitating and &quot;allowing&quot; and following the  <br/>
lead of my child IS in a sense everything......  and that might mean  <br/>
that lots of &quot;things&quot; or &quot;classes&quot; or whatevers are not experienced  <br/>
(via her choice and this choice to live an unschooling life).......    <br/>
so full circle..... not everything is DONE.  But everything, in  <br/>
potentiality, is right there at their figure tips.....<br/>
<br/>
just some rambling thoughts that might or might not make sense.<br/>
:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896946823">Hi Sandra!<br/>
I think so many of your articles sum up what you are saying/thinking. If I&#39;m understanding you right.<br/>
Here is one article I was reading yesterday:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/seeingit">http://sandradodd.com/seeingit</a> <br/>
I was wondering, &quot;Am I providing, doing, all that is mine to do with my children on this unschooling journey?&quot; <br/>
When we first began unschooling I did not do anything. I was not sure how it was supposed to look. I really needed to step back and put every thing down. All the books all the worksheets...every thing. Then I watched my children. I watched my daughter step out into her interests. I kept/keep reading and looking for direction because that is me. I then had a better idea of what is mine to do. Help my children find what they are looking for. What is it she wants to learn? Then we search and find. We go to craft stores, we look at garage sales and we find those interesting things she is seeking. As an example, she wanted to make her own collection of dolls. She has created 100 different craft dolls. In my school head I&#39;m thinking what does this have to do with learning. I turn it around and see, we are learning about different people, villages, and times. She made a village out of old cardboard boxes and created street names and local places to visit. Is<br/>
 she reading yet at 7, no. Is she creating stories, yes. Is she learning? Yes, all the time!<br/>
So looking to the whole wide world for learning is an adventure of my own too. I also think I &#39;have to&#39; listen to my children and help them follow their bliss. It won&#39;t work if I don&#39;t listen, I don&#39;t show up, I don&#39;t offer guidance. Like the idea of visiting a historical village or looking up special books. As I move from that school in my head I am able to enjoy all we do together so much more.<br/>
If I don&#39;t do these things we will miss an opportunity and there will be resentment on all ends. However finding the balance between every thing and nothing is the key for a joyful experience for all. It is all a choice and when if it feels like a burden then it is time to switch gears.<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m an unschooler. Lessons are never over. On the other hand, lessons never really begin. Children&#39;s questions are answered and an atmosphere of learning is created so that questions are constant and answers are never far away. &quot;<br/>

Thank you for sharing your thought. I hope I understood right and was of some help. :)<br/>
I am grateful!<br/>

<br/>
I guess this is the quote.  It&#39;s not too bad, but two things made me  <br/>
blink:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Its funny because we have always had the plastic toys and I have  <br/>
always coveted the wooden ones. Lately I have been trying to cull the  <br/>
plastic ones little by little and my kids don&#39;t seem to mind too much.  <br/>
They seem to make their own fun with whatever is around. So I guess  <br/>
there is always two sides to the coin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...my kids don&#39;t seem to mind too much.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s the same as &quot;They minded,&quot; unless the person write in cliches  <br/>
without thinking carefully.<br/>
<br/>
And the ending is totally a cliche meant to suggest that all ways are  <br/>
equally valid, I think, in this case (though that&#39;s not always what  <br/>
&quot;two sides to every coin&quot; always means).<br/>
<br/>
Also the word &quot;cull&quot; (I have been trying to cull the plastic ones...)  <br/>
is not a word of peace and generosity and love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552029844">Dory!  If you have a digital camera and could upload some pictures and <br/>
maybe even put &#39;em on a blog, I&#39;d LUV to have a link.  I&#39;d love to see <br/>
if you have time to put it up.<br/>
<br/>
Karl wants to do puppets at the moment so we are buying some from <br/>
American Science & Surplus.  He has been using his stuff animals (of <br/>
which he has scads) for puppet shows and he wants to be able to move <br/>
them like puppeteers do.  We watched Muppets From Space.... soooo much <br/>
fun just in music!  We danced and had a ball with it.  Karl and I set <br/>
up an old playpen on it&#39;s side and we&#39;re using a beach towel for the <br/>
&quot;door&quot; and he is decorating it with teeny weeny objects we can barely <br/>
see but they&#39;re some of his favorite toys and knick knacks strung on <br/>
the &quot;ceiling.&quot;<br/>
