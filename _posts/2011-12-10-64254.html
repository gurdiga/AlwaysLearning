<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128649851">Just now I got so engrossed in threads on this site that I forgot about my eggs, despite the fact I was standing right next to them in their frying pan!  You see, this list is so stimulating, encouraging, provoking, reassuring, freeing, empowering and engaging for me. I love it!<br/>
<br/>
And I love it enough not to mind that I ended up eating those eggs, which in the end were not over-cooked at all. Deliciously crispy-edged with perfectly runny yolks. I can quickly assume the worst when I let go of control, but often what happens is things work out just fine. I know this, not only because of my eggs this morning, but because of the journey I&#39;ve taken as a conventional naughty-step, controlling mum, to an unschooling mum who let&#39;s her happy son eat half his chocolates in one go and then chooses to experiment with the other half in all sorts of ways that left them inedible! But he was thrilled :)<br/>
<br/>
So a big THANK YOU to everyone who makes this list what it is, especially the moderators. My family is happier because of you and I have connected relationships with my two boys who can&#39;t stop learning!</div>
