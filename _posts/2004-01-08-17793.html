Hi Alice, from another non-poster...there is s great resource in our<br/>
area called Fernside Center for Grieving Children.  I realize the<br/>
proximity isn&#39;t helpful, but the site had referrals for other<br/>
geographical area and links to sites for grieving children, probably<br/>
some other resources.  Go to www.fernside.org <br/>
<br/>
I agree that the reaction is perfectly normal.  Grief is a process that<br/>
one goes through - or not.  To some extent, people can choose to delay<br/>
or deny the grieving process.  Then they cannot let it go.  It can haunt<br/>
them decades later.  Those children had many changes to cope with and<br/>
trudging forward stoically may have seemed the only way.  The anger<br/>
toward homeschoolers could simply be a direction for the anger they may<br/>
feel losing there parent and primary caregiver.  Yet grief is very<br/>
personal and individual, so each one must have their own needs<br/>
addressed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a rough road, no matter what, but from a more distant perspective,<br/>
I see it as a potentially good opportunity for the family - widow and<br/>
his children - to face and go through the journey of grief.<br/>
<br/>
A local family lost the mom last fall and the kids had to return to<br/>
school.  It&#39;s hard for me to imagine them liking it and hating the<br/>
homeschooling arena...except as a defensive reaction.  What a horrible<br/>
way to be put  into that institutional system!<br/>
<br/>
Hope they will follow through on getting some assistance,<br/>
Susan</div>
