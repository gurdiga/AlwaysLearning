<div id="ygrps-yiv-294081696">Today is my twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, and I have a sick  <br/>
husband.  He was up and down all night, but went to work anyway, and  <br/>
came home a few hours later.  I think it&#39;s just flu.<br/>
<br/>
The anniversary celebration is here, then.<br/>

There are words there that should boost any marriage or relationship  <br/>
with child or friend.<br/>
<br/>
There will be more photos later.  Those on the blog are links.  I went  <br/>
through the guestbook and e-mailed as many people as I have e-mails  <br/>
for, and it was quite a few.  More than half of the people who were at  <br/>
my wedding are still in my life, if they&#39;re alive, and only one  <br/>
connection separated, in most cases, otherwise.<br/>
