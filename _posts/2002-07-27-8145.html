<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; This 30 day pass with Amtrak seems like a good idea but its <br/>
&gt; &gt; coach class so me and the spawn will be sitting upright for the 3 <br/>
&gt; &gt; days it takes to get to CA. Anyone know how comfortable those <br/>
&gt; &gt; seats are?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think they&#39;re pretty okay - not like airplaines, at least - get the ones <br/>
&gt; that face each other with a table between - The armrests come up - small <br/>
&gt; people can probably lay across two seats. The seat backs go back pretty <br/>
&gt; far. <br/>
&gt; You can put your head on the table - more options. And on long trips there <br/>
&gt; are observation cars. Cool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A couple of us moms folded origami for the couple of hours it took us on a <br/>
&gt; recent train ride between Orange County, CA and San Diego. The kids sat at <br/>
&gt; another table and played some kind of elaborate card and character game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can relate......<br/>
If they have room they normally let me and the kids get a bedroom since hubby <br/>
is normally working when we travel or I will get a employee dorm room if they <br/>
are full since I don&#39;t have to pay for it........<br/>
Being a wife to an employee for them for 20 years....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband works the chicago to oakland....<br/>
Which one are you going on? I can see if he would be working that particular <br/>
trip and I can have him take care of you regarding the lounge car......<br/>
