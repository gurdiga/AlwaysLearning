<div id="ygrps-yiv-419863531">Hi everyone. I have an issue with the way my son doesn&#39;t let me finish<br/>
a sentence. Lukas is 5yo. very spirited,active.<br/>
  Whenever i try to explain something to him or answer a question he<br/>
cuts me off. I try to limit the words in my sentences to 10 or less if<br/>
i can.<br/>
 He will stop me from talking with &quot;but mommy, i want to tell you<br/>
this&quot; even after i let him finish he will repeat the same.<br/>
 I really wish to have him hear me and connect. He doesn&#39;t maintain<br/>
any eye contact either. However, he will look at me when he&#39;s talking.<br/>
 I tried speaking in a lower and slower voice and such but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
work,lol<br/>
Just an age thing you think? thanks, Heather</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283691421">I have an intense and physical 8 yo boy.  He likes touch and movement <br/>
while we talk.  Some things that work for us are hugging while talking, <br/>
playing catch/ passing an object back and forth while talking.  I try <br/>
and touch him a lot especially when he is calm and I don&#39;t have <br/>
anything in particular to say.  He loves his back scratched so I do <br/>
that for him often.  I also keep the sentences short, I try to make 3 <br/>
word sentences if possible.  I would like to emphasize this kid is <br/>
great, I love his intensity and he hears that a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516769605">Morgan used to tell me to &quot;shush&quot; or run away after maybe three <br/>
words. It felt like trying to communicate in &quot;sound bites&quot; (or is it <br/>
bytes? I&#39;ve never been sure). She does it much less nowadays, and <br/>
after more words, but there are days when I still have to answer any <br/>
questions in three words or less. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I noticed was she would listen to more words depending on <br/>
my tone. If I was using what I think of as my &quot;mommy voice&quot;-<br/>
 &quot;Shush!&quot; If I talk to her like a friend, I get to use more words. I <br/>
should say that my &quot;mommy voice&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;poodle voice&quot;. Its more of a <br/>
lecturing tone. Once I realized that, I was actually sort of <br/>
grateful for her shushes, since that&#39;s not the kind of relationship <br/>
I want to have with Mo.<br/>
<br/>
Its hard for me to know if she&#39;s been growing out of it, or if I&#39;m <br/>
just getting better at communicating with her. Some of both, I <br/>
think. Watching her interact with other people, I see her <br/>
saying &quot;shush&quot; much less, but changing the subject more - that may <br/>
be closer to what Lukas is doing. With Mo it always seems to be a <br/>
matter of discomfort. When she&#39;s under a lot of stress she needs <br/>
less words.<br/>
<br/>
A couple days ago a neighbor stopped by and tried to ask her <br/>
a &quot;teaching question&quot; - oh, what was it? it was something about <br/>
spelling or simple arithmetic... anyway, Mo promptly changed the <br/>
subject. The neighbor tried to repeat the question and Mo changed <br/>
the subject again. At that point the neighbor looked at me and I <br/>
said &quot;I don&#39;t think she wants to talk about that.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I like the idea someone else posted about touch and movement - <br/>
that&#39;s something I&#39;d like to explore with Mo, too. But definately <br/>
try to listen to yourself while you&#39;re talking to Lukas and ask <br/>
yourself &quot;Is this how I would sound if I was talking to an adult <br/>
friend?&quot; I didn&#39;t even notice how I sounded until I made a concious <br/>
effort to listen to my own voice - it was like hearing my Dad come <br/>
out of my mouth! Yikes!<br/>

When I read this post, this statement stuck out. I think it is accurate. You<br/>
have an issue with your son&#39;s non-need for you to finish your sentence. I<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily think your son has a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes we talk waaaaaaay more than our kids need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549210992">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
You named four classic symptoms of ADHD: spirited, active (as if driven by a motor), interrupts a lot, and poor eye contact.  My 6yo DD has it, and I have researched my brains out about it in order to help her, so I have learned a lot.  One of the things I have learned for sure is that it is a real disorder.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it seems that many in the unschooling community have such a backlash against &quot;labels&quot; that they throw the &quot;diagnosis baby&quot; out with the bathwater.  Cancer is a label too.  Shall we deny that anyone has cancer and not explore treatment options?<br/>
<br/>
Lukas&#39;s symptoms do not mean that he necessarily has ADHD, but you certainly may want to explore it further.  I know of parents who so wish they had known about their children&#39;s ADHD when their children were still young.  They would have understood them (allowing more connection) much better.  My research has certainly helped me to understand and help my daughter, including finding a special diet that has ended her chronic headaches.  In fact, it was my understanding of ADHD that eventually led me to homeschooling and then to unschooling!  How&#39;s *that* for a label that may be more of a friend to the homeschool community than many realize?  In fact, I have shared with other parents of PS ADHDers about the benefits of both HS and unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
(At first I was going to send this offlist, thinking that the moderator would block this post, because that happened to me on another unschooling list, but here goes.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My experience with people on THIS list is that they aren&#39;t throwing  <br/>
labels out for the sake of throwing out labels. Every noun is a  <br/>
label. We do, however, have strong doubts about the value of giving a  <br/>
child a &quot;diagnosis&quot; of ADD - but we&#39;re not so silly as to dismiss it  <br/>
just because it is &quot;a label.&quot; By assuming that we have nothing more  <br/>
than an unreasonable bias against &quot;labels,&quot; you have blithely  <br/>
dismissed the very real and thoughtful reasons that we do not think  <br/>
it is a good idea to label a child as ADD.<br/>
<br/>
  I read books about kids who have the kinds of characteristics my  <br/>
children have, to broaden my own thinking, stimulate new ideas about  <br/>
how to help my child get along better in the world, etc. But, I am  <br/>
very careful NOT to label my children as ADD, or compulsive, or  <br/>
spirited, or explosive, or any other limiting label with such  <br/>
negative connotations, because I do feel that there are a myriad of  <br/>
potentially very negative consequences of that kind of labeling.<br/>

It&#39;s not a backlash, on my part, to avoid such labels.  It&#39;s part of  <br/>
the fabric of attachment parenting and respect for individuals&#39; ways  <br/>
of learning and being.  Many labels have to do with comparing someone  <br/>
to the average, so that you identify someone at some point in a curve  <br/>
or as some part of a statistical breakdown.  That rarely helps the  <br/>
individual.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than &quot;treat&quot; a child, rather than work to adapt the child to a  <br/>
situation, it seems better to arrange situations with the child&#39;s  <br/>
interests and preferences and strengths in mind.  I adapt my home and  <br/>
our activities to our children, rather than the other way around.<br/>

I don&#39;t have diagnosis babies.  I have three real, whole children who  <br/>

Cancer is the label for something that develops and can kill a person.<br/>
ADD is the label for the way someone is throughout a lifetime, and it  <br/>
isn&#39;t a progressive disease or condition that kills a person if left  <br/>
untreated.<br/>
<br/>
Treatments for cancer can be painful, uncomfortable or dangerous, but  <br/>
people weigh the benefits against the sought-after outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Treatments for ADD might be dangerous in the longrun, but those who  <br/>
see school and &quot;education&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot; as more important than  <br/>
the rights or comfort of an individual child are not so worried about  <br/>
the danger to one child physically, biochemically or emotionally.    <br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t need to drug a child to be a good unschooler.   <br/>
Homeschoolers often seem to feel it&#39;s necessary to fit a round child  <br/>
into a square hole for which they&#39;ve paid money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680395733">I think there&#39;s some validity to being careful with diagnosis. My mother,<br/>
who is fond of diagnosis, diagnosed my father with ADHD posthumously. I&#39;m<br/>
sure at least one of my children could get the diagnosis. I think I could<br/>
probably get it for myself as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem lies in pathologizing behavior that really is pretty<br/>
common and that can even help individual&#39;s achieve (my father was very<br/>
successful -- even famous -- in his field). Cancer is a disease that can<br/>
kill you that usually can be identified in a lab. ADHD is a bit different,<br/>
so I don&#39;t think the analogy is apt.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the feeling of relief when I heard about sensory integration<br/>
issues because it made certain behaviors of one of my children less baffling<br/>
as well as explained some physical things.  At the same time, I don&#39;t go<br/>
around talking about it with regard to that child, as I see many parents do<br/>
all the time. I&#39;m not even willing to signal the gender of the child on this<br/>
list (since I have four -- two boys and two girls). It&#39;s also likely that I<br/>
would&#39;ve figured different and loving ways of interacting with my child on<br/>
my own without hearing any talk of sensory issues. I&#39;m not a<br/>
run-to-the-doctor worrywart kind of mother, but I was worried I was seeing<br/>
symptoms of a neurological problem in my then-one-year-old. In clearing that<br/>
concern, I was exposed to talk of sensory integration.<br/>
<br/>
One danger in diagnosis is that these things (ADHD and sensory integration<br/>
issues) can take over a family life. I don&#39;t want my child to identify as<br/>
anything other than a unique, wonderful, loved person; I don&#39;t want other<br/>
people in our family, friends or strangers to look at my child through the<br/>
prism of a semi-trendy diagnosis. It&#39;s more than bad enough that I am in<br/>
danger of doing so, and I&#39;m not someone who is prone to embracing that kind<br/>
of diagnosis.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a HUGE difference, in my mind, between us doing what we can  <br/>
do increase our understanding our children - including reading books  <br/>
about all kinds of characteristics - versus labeling the child as  <br/>
having &quot;something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have many of the symptoms of ADD, myself - how about most of you?  <br/>
(I think a lot of us unschooling parents have personalities that  <br/>
include many &quot;ADD symptoms.&quot;) I don&#39;t need a &quot;diagnosis&quot; - I don&#39;t  <br/>
have an illness and these traits are aspects of my personality that  <br/>
might be annoying to others at times and bother me, myself, at times,  <br/>
too (like when I lose things or when I realize I haven&#39;t been  <br/>
listening to what someone is telling me, etc). I do NOT have a  <br/>
disorder. Do I need to live my life aware of &quot;how I am?&quot; Do I need to  <br/>
select what I do, where I go, who I hang out with, what situations I  <br/>
get myself into? Yeah - just like everybody else, depending on THEIR  <br/>
particular personality traits. This particular bundle of traits is  <br/>
considered problematic mostly because it is harder for people with  <br/>
these traits to function well in school-type situations (including  <br/>
other-than-school situations that are similar in their behavioral  <br/>
requirements). Those of us with these traits can learn ways to do  <br/>
better in those situations just like those with different sets of  <br/>
traits can learn to do better in situations that are more problematic  <br/>
for them. I did well in school - oddly - but now, looking back, I  <br/>
realize I had to shut down much of myself in order to function there.  <br/>
In order to sit still and follow directions and not interrupt and  <br/>
wait my turn (none of which came easily to me), I also closed off the  <br/>
parts of me that were most creative and interesting. I didn&#39;t even  <br/>
KNOW it, usually, except for always having a deeply-in-the-background  <br/>
sense of dread that I&#39;d be unacceptable if the real me was ever let  <br/>
out. I really believe school causes problems for people with all  <br/>
kinds of personalities, but those kids with personalities that are  <br/>
quiet and still and compliant are &quot;easy&quot; and don&#39;t cause extra work  <br/>
for their parents and teachers and so they don&#39;t get &quot;diagnosed&quot; with  <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Also, many of these traits are extremely normal and healthy for  <br/>
younger children - it can take a long time for some kids to develop  <br/>
the ability to patiently wait their turn in a game or to wait for  <br/>
someone to finish talking before blurting out responses. Some kids  <br/>
pick these kinds of things up quickly and seemingly automatically and  <br/>
other kids take longer and sometimes need more direct help from the  <br/>
adults around them. I don&#39;t need to diagnose a kid as ADD in order to  <br/>
help a child come slowly over time to realize that (1) they really  <br/>
hate waiting their turn so maybe playing games where they have to do  <br/>
that isn&#39;t the best use of their time and (2) if they want to play  <br/>
those games, part of the game is waiting so figure out how to be able  <br/>
to do that.<br/>
<br/>
TOO often, a diagnosis of ADD or ADHD harms a child because it lets  <br/>
the adults in that child&#39;s life off the hook for providing the best  <br/>
environment for that child&#39;s temperament. Let&#39;s diagnose the  <br/>
environment, instead, that isn&#39;t set up appropriately for children  <br/>
with certain kinds of personality traits - that doesn&#39;t support the  <br/>
child as he/she is, but labels the child&#39;s personality as a disorder  <br/>
- bad, sick.<br/>
<br/>
Without the diagnosis, a child has behavior traits that will OFTEN  <br/>
change over time, anyway, and the child will do best with help from  <br/>
parents who respond by setting up his/her environment supportively.<br/>
<br/>
I have so many students who are overly passive and wait to be told  <br/>
what to do and what to learn and they don&#39;t engage with the course  <br/>
content, but simply repeat back what they&#39;ve been told. THAT behavior  <br/>
could be bundled into a set of symptoms and called &quot;PDS&quot; (passive  <br/>
dependency syndrome). Most of my freshman college students &quot;have it.&quot;  <br/>
I consider it FAR more debilitating than the set of so-called  <br/>
symptoms of ADD.<br/>
<br/>
Many times people will say that the diagnosis of ADD in their  <br/>
children helped them help their children. I don&#39;t believe they needed  <br/>
the diagnosis. If they have a child who exhibits any of the following  <br/>
behaviors, they can help their child with the specific behaviors  <br/>
without labeling the child has having a disorder. If a child tends to  <br/>
fidget constantly - then don&#39;t put the child into situations where it  <br/>
will bother others, give him/her things to fidget with, ignore the  <br/>
fidgeting when possible, and so on. And the same for all the other  <br/>
&quot;symptoms.&quot; Refusing to diagnose/label is not the same as refusing to  <br/>
help the child.<br/>

one&#39;s potential.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a kid with Cancer and I gotta say, I&#39;m pretty offended by this<br/>
comparison... Even while Hannah&#39;s cancer was being treated, I advocated for<br/>
HANNAH to be treated, not as a number, not as a patient, but as a PERSON.  It<br/>
was a very different experience for the entirety  of her medical staff.  <br/>
<br/>
ADHD/ADD is the same in that the person behind the label doesn&#39;t want the<br/>
*disorder* to be treated, they want the PERSON to be recognized and accepted for<br/>
whom they are, not medicated out of their personality.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling opens up far more possibilities for Life; acceptance of kids for Who<br/>
They Are opens far more possibilities in Life; parenting the kids you have<br/>
instead of grooming them to be who *you* want them to be opens far more<br/>
possiblities in Life.  <br/>
<br/>
Labels limit possiblities.  <br/>

select what I do, where I go, who I hang out with, what situations I<br/>
get myself into? Yeah - just like everybody else, depending on THEIR<br/>
particular personality traits. -=-<br/>

Howard Gardner calls the ability to be self-aware &quot;intrapersonal  <br/>
intelligence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I cannot sit still through any hour-long anything.  There have been a  <br/>
few times lately when sitting still in one place was really the good  <br/>
and expected thing to do.  I was very happy when real reasons for me  <br/>
to get up and go and do something important presented themselves.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid in school, I was the kid who really (really) wanted  <br/>
to be sent on errands, or to straighten up the book shelves, or to  <br/>
take a note to the office, or alphabetize cards or ANYTHING that gave  <br/>
me something I could do by myself and quickly, that gave me a chance  <br/>
to move.  Luckily for me, most of my teachers saw that.  When one  <br/>
didn&#39;t have the interpersonal skills or flexibility to see what I  <br/>
needed and respond usefully, I resorted to making things out of paper  <br/>
at my desk, writing notes or practicing my writing or doodling or  <br/>
doing my homework for another class, but never did I (nor could I  <br/>
have) just sit still and gaze levelly at the teacher and breathe  <br/>
normally and be comfortable for 45 minutes.  That is not going to  <br/>
happen with me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I really believe school causes problems for people with all<br/>
kinds of personalities, but those kids with personalities that are<br/>
quiet and still and compliant are &quot;easy&quot; and don&#39;t cause extra work<br/>
for their parents and teachers and so they don&#39;t get &quot;diagnosed&quot; with<br/>
anything.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  They call them &quot;good.&quot;<br/>
Babies who aren&#39;t very curious or needy are called &quot;good babies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I doubt there&#39;s anyone here who thinks that a baby (especially a  <br/>
curious and needy baby) can&#39;t tell the difference between  <br/>
conversations and facial expressions in his presence that indicate  <br/>
that he is something other than &quot;good baby.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents who claim not to label children who have done so in ANY  <br/>
context, no matter how far behind the child&#39;s back, have probably  <br/>
indicated the same to him in non-verbal ways.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra (who has so far today morning checked e-mail, burned a CD and  <br/>
printed out documentation for it, made breakfast for six people (OH,  <br/>
seven, because Marty came home for lunch from work and I made another  <br/>
round because he ate sausage and eggs for lunch), two pots of tea,  <br/>
sat and talked, played a round of Cranium with snow-bound  <br/>
houseguests, done a load of laundry, fed all the pets, played Neopets  <br/>
and now am listening to music and answering mail.   Last night we had  <br/>
nearly 20 people over playing Encore, and though a few did leave  <br/>
between 9:00 and 10:00 because they needed to go to work the next  <br/>
day, and another few left because the snow was starting to stick, the  <br/>
game was still going at midnight (and those who know Keith will be  <br/>
impressed to know that he was still playing at midnight too).<br/>
<br/>
I could be the kind of person who wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t do all that.   <br/>
I see the energy and need to move and do as the source of  <br/>
productivity and connections.  Lots of people benefit from the traits  <br/>
in me that other people would call &quot;a disorder.&quot;  And so on behalf of  <br/>
other people as normal and as energetic as I am, I object whenever  <br/>
less creative and active people try to encourage others like them to  <br/>
label other busy, curious, zippy people as having a disorder or a  <br/>
disease (like cancer, some say, and it&#39;s a huge insult to me and  <br/>
millions of other normal people).<br/>

I botched the editing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071708017">A few general thoughts before I try to find time to respond to individual posts:<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that the beliefs and motivations for all of your responses on this topic are coming from a caring place within yourselves about families and children.  I hope you are considering that the same might be the motivation for my post.  So much so that even though I knew that I might receive some spirited responses (despite my lack of time to respond to much of them), my empathy for parents of ADHDers (especially the more severe cases) prompted me to stick my neck out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By assuming that we have nothing more <br/>
&gt; than an unreasonable bias against &quot;labels,&quot; you have blithely <br/>
&gt; dismissed the very real and thoughtful reasons that we do not think <br/>
&gt; it is a good idea to label a child as ADD.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did not say nor do I assume that such bias (and we all have our biases) is unreasonable.  People generally do have reasons for what they believe about ADHD.  What I am concerned about is that affected parents and their children may be missing out on information and help--help which, according to research, could save the lives of their children.<br/>
<br/>
You see, ADHD is called a spectrum disorder, meaning that it can present in varying degrees.  Those with more severe cases of it are in more danger (from car accidents, the results of sexual promiscuity, etc.).  Some of us may have seen children who were labeled ADHD who either did not have it or had a mild version of it.  If we then conclude that it is not a real disorder and influence others accordingly, families of severely affected ADHDers may ignore important symptoms.  We certainly could think of the set of symptoms as having to do with genetic makeup and not being a *disorder*.  That would still leave us with the serious claim within most of the medical and pediatric community that such a group of symptoms can be dangerous to have and that steps can be taken to lessen the danger.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, I am <br/>
&gt; very careful NOT to label my children as ADD, or compulsive, or <br/>
&gt; spirited, or explosive, or any other limiting label with such <br/>
&gt; negative connotations, because I do feel that there are a myriad of <br/>
&gt; potentially very negative consequences of that kind of labeling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whether to apply that label is certainly up to the parents, and I have heard of situations (parts of the country, among certain relatives, etc.) wherein I would probably not mention the term either.  I would still advocate parents educating *themselves* about ADHD if they are concerned about their child.  Then the parents are more empowered to make their own decision based upon input from a variety of sources.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that I will have time to respond further until next year.  Oops, and then I travel out of state, so it may be several days or more into 2007.  <br/>
Happy New Year everyone!<br/>

If you want to respond to all the ideas that were presented, that&#39;s  <br/>
fine.  There&#39;s no obligation (nor even desireability) as far as the  <br/>

Unschooling.<br/>
We need to write what will help people understand unschooling and  <br/>
relationships between parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I did not say nor do I assume that such bias (and we all have our  <br/>
biases) is unreasonable.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a bias.  It&#39;s a belief, not just a matter of opinion about  <br/>
something incontrovertible.<br/>
To say &quot;unfortunately...&quot; implies that it&#39;s unreasonable, or a matter  <br/>
of ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What I am concerned about is that affected parents and their  <br/>
children may be missing out on information and help--help which,  <br/>
according to research, could save the lives of their children.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing about unschooling that would be improved by parents  <br/>
believing that their children&#39;s lives are endangered by a lack of  <br/>
knowledge of ADHD.  In the absence of school or school-at-home  <br/>
pressures, it&#39;s not much of an issue.  If each child is making  <br/>
choices and doing things in his own way at his own pace, where will  <br/>
the problem lie?<br/>
<br/>
Instead of talking to us about studies and the fear tactics of  <br/>
&quot;experts&quot; or &quot;research,&quot; how about just talking about how unschooling  <br/>
was helped at your house by knowledge of ADHD.  If you have no  <br/>
stories about that, maybe it&#39;s too soon to write to the list about it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We certainly could think of the set of symptoms as having to do  <br/>

<br/>
Like what?<br/>
To use &quot;most of the medical and pediatric community&quot; in this forum as  <br/>
back-up to any argument is a fallacy right off.  Most &quot;experts&quot; of  <br/>
that community or the education community would insist that school is  <br/>
necessary for safety.  They would seriously claim that school lessens  <br/>
danger.  (Vague dangers of all kinds.)<br/>
<br/>

if they are concerned about their child. Then the parents are more  <br/>

No one here discourages parents from learning.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Treatments for cancer can be painful, uncomfortable or dangerous, but <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The comparison was about the fact that ADHD and Cancer are both labels with negative connotations, and it seems that we all pretty much agree on this.  The fact that cancer is dramatically different from ADHD is the very reason that I chose it as an example.  It makes my point, which is simply that not all labels with negative connotations are to be avoided solely because they have negative connotations.  When we think about it, I think we all pretty much agree on this as well.<br/>
<br/>
The issue, then, is whether the negative connotations of the ADHD label outweigh the potential benefits of using it for a positive end.  I am sure there are many here who have recognized this.  One reason for my posts is to clarify this point for those who may have been thinking that to research and learn about ADHD (and whether it may apply to one&#39;s individual situation) would somehow necessarily be detrimental or in violation of some principle of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That perhaps having been accomplished, I freely acknowledge everyone&#39;s experiences with the ADHD label being used with negative outcome.  As I have indicated, I was already aware of such situations.  Hopefully, more people will do likewise to allow for the possibility that positive outcomes may sometimes occur.<br/>
<br/>
I did not mean to offend anyone in saying that I am sure that ADHD is a real disorder.  I have several adult friends who apply the term to themselves, and we all recognize and celebrate the &quot;giftedness&quot; of it.  Sandra, I admire your ability to be so productive.  I&#39;m definitely the analytical type and sometimes wonder how much &quot;paralysis from analysis&quot; may be slowing me down.  Even composing posts can be quite a labor for me, so I guess one could say I have &quot;hyper-analytical&quot; disorder. :-)    I think that this is one reason that I have so many friends with ADHD-like symptoms.  They are drawn to what they see as my being stable and methodical, and I am drawn to their quick wit and energy.  :-)<br/>

One is a label for something people aren&#39;t thrilled to discover, but  <br/>
that can be laid out and looked at physically, or cut out, or  <br/>
destroyed chemically, or that can kill you.<br/>
<br/>
None of those things apply to ADHD.  Parents can only &quot;discover&quot; that  <br/>
a child is that way if the parent hadn&#39;t already been paying  <br/>

<br/>
People here who have been unschooling for a dozen years or more are  <br/>
saying they believe from that experience, and from  having helped  <br/>
others for that time, that it is necessarily detrimental to label  <br/>
children as having a disability.  Those with experience are trying to  <br/>
clarify for you and others that unschooling itself will dissolve the  <br/>

such a<br/>
backlash against &quot;labels&quot; that they throw the &quot;diagnosis baby&quot; out  <br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t agree. The negative connotations regarding ADHD are from others saying<br/>
that this person with these traits has something wrong with them. I don&#39;t<br/>
see negative connotations regarding cancer. It&#39;s a physical process that can<br/>
kill a person.<br/>
<br/>
ADHD is a label created by people. It was a decision to make a personality<br/>
type negative. Is there any reason on earth why a person with these traits<br/>
couldn&#39;t be described as energetic...quick-thinking...fast-acting...zesty?<br/>
Why use the words &quot;deficit&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot;? What are the deficiencies? All I<br/>
can think of are the things that would require one to sit still and be quiet<br/>
for a long time. School and church come to mind.<br/>

Is this what happened to you? I wonder what made you think people felt this<br/>
way. I can&#39;t imagine someone would not dare plug something into google<br/>
because of fear of unschooling principles. Research is a grand exercise for<br/>
most of us.<br/>
<br/>
I think it has been pretty clear that the idea of not using labels is so<br/>
that anyone, be it the child, the parent, or an outsider, thinks negatively<br/>
about a child in any way, or puts them in a box, or makes them feel limited.<br/>
That is often what labels do. That is absolutely to be avoided. It is not<br/>
good for a child to be thought of as &quot;deficient&quot; or &quot;disordered&quot;.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cuts me off. I try to limit the words in my sentences to 10 or less if<br/>
&gt; i can.<br/>
&gt;  .....&gt;  I really wish to have him hear me and connect. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In all this ADHD stuff, Heather has been left a bit out in the cold <br/>
with her question.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my thought, to foster connection with your ds. Listen more. Ask <br/>
him brief questions that spring from whatever the story is that he is <br/>
telling you so that he feels really listened to. Jayn often responds <br/>
well to &quot;What happened then?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is hard to have to hear a long and rambling story - <br/>
sometimes it is hard when there is repetition and pauses while words <br/>
are sought for. But it is worth it to give the gift of attentive <br/>
listening and save your story for later. <br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that Jayn (7) often stops listening. If I keep talking <br/>
at her at this time, regardless of how worthy or important my <br/>
information may seem to me, the result is less connection and her eyes <br/>
glazing over. So I might as well save my breath, and not foster this as <br/>
a habit. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of answering questions, the simplest answer first and <br/>
then &quot;Does that help?&quot; as the invitation to ask more. Reminds me of a <br/>
joke: The kid asked &quot;where did I come from?&quot; and got the whole story of <br/>
the birds and the bees. He listened patiently until the end then <br/>
said, &quot;Johnny next door comes from Cleveland&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn interrupts a lot too - just boils and bubbles over with enthusiasm <br/>
for her new idea or what just happened. I truly just let it go and save <br/>
the &quot;I need you to hear me now&quot; (my hand on her shoulder) for really <br/>
super important urgent things - sorry can&#39;t think of an example - and <br/>
again brevity!<br/>
<br/>
Oh and another idea - Jayn listens with great fascination when the <br/>
story begins &quot;when you were a baby...&quot; or &quot;when I was little....&quot; <br/>

some kids nurse forever and some get on and right off in a couple  <br/>

capacity to hear longer explanations might grow with time.<br/>

The reason I used the term &quot;unfortunately&quot; was with reference to the potential negative effects for some families who may conclude that ADHD is not real due to an atmosphere of censorship about ADHD, not because of any opinion about when such labels may be appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And you admitted in that post, too, that you expected the post would be<br/>

&gt;deficiencies? All I can think of are the things that would require <br/>
&gt;one to sit still and be quiet for a long time. School and church <br/>
&gt;come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son is definitely a child who would be labeled ADHD if he had more <br/>
mainstream parents. When he was younger, the energy level was the <br/>
thing that was most noticeable. Because we dont go to &quot;school and <br/>
church&quot; its not necessary for him to sit still, or pay attention to <br/>
things he isnt interested in, so...not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
However, i have noticed lately that the &quot;inattention&quot; part of the <br/>
label has started to become really noticeable. For example, this past <br/>
Thanksgiving, i had made Seamus a plate of food, and set it down in <br/>
front of the chair that was by the window. I was going to sit right <br/>
next to him, and his aunt was right across the table. So far, neither <br/>
of us had a plate of food. I told Seamus that i had his food at his <br/>
place, if he wanted to sit down, he comes over stands right next to me <br/>
in front of his place, and says &quot;Where is it??? Where am i supposed to <br/>
sit? Where&#39;s my food??&quot; His plate was the only plate on the table. It <br/>
was really obvious to everyone but him where to sit. We all started <br/>
laughing a bit because if someone tells you &quot;You&#39;re foods at the table <br/>
where you&#39;ll be sitting&quot; and there is only one plate of food at the <br/>
table, and the seat is the one right next to your mother, the <br/>
assumption can be made that, yep thats your spot. But he didnt make <br/>
that connection, and seemed bewildered that I would think he would. <br/>
<br/>
Another situation...I was on the computer, wanted to quote a passage <br/>
from a book in a post i was writing, and asked Seamus to go get a book <br/>
from the living room for me. Before i could even tell him what book or <br/>
where it was at, he took off to get it. I called him back, told him <br/>
very specifically &quot;Bring me the book called Attaching In Adoption, <br/>
with the red cover, that is on the long white couch [as opposed to the <br/>
loveseat]&quot; By the time he walked the few feet down the hall way, he <br/>
was saying &quot;What am i looking for? Whats it called? Where&#39;s it at???&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If he is looking for something, and it is literally right in front of <br/>
him, he can&#39;t see it. He&#39;ll yell at me &quot;Where is it?? I thought you <br/>
said it was on the bed???&quot; This is especially true if he actually has <br/>
to move something aside (his coat is under another coat or <br/>
something)...He will be on his way to go do something (take a dish to <br/>
the sink)totally forget what he was doing, and go do something else.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of stuff happens every day. Multiple times a day. My son <br/>
told him that sometimes he will want to remember his online friends&#39; <br/>
names, but forgets the name before he has a chance to write it down. <br/>
So i think its something he thinks about too. <br/>
<br/>
None of this has anything to do with school, or sitting down, or being <br/>
quiet. As his energy level has decreased over the years and he has <br/>
more control over his body, and is less likely to rage over seemingly <br/>
simple things I&#39;ve started to notice his forgetfullness, his <br/>
difficulty in finding items, and also his lack of coordination (he was <br/>
walking like Capt. Jack Sparrow in a store the other day, glass items <br/>
all around! eek!) <br/>
<br/>
While right now, none of this impacts his life in an overly negative <br/>
way (I help him find things, try not to give him too many directions <br/>
at once, expect that i will have to help, and stay near him if we are <br/>
walking near fragile stuff), i do wonder how it will impact his life <br/>
in the future if it doesnt improve. Will he be ok driving a car, or <br/>
not &quot;see&quot; that the light has turned red or another car is coming? Will <br/>
he have to have multiple copies of his keys since he will likely lose <br/>
them all the time? Will he be like me, and drop out of college <br/>
multiple times, or put off paying bills until they are late (even <br/>
though you have the money, and the bill sitting right there, and you <br/>
KNOW it needs to be paid)? Will he not put clean laundry away until <br/>
its all over the floor and needs to be rewashed? <br/>
<br/>
I think there must be a way to embrace your child&#39;s personality, and <br/>
not foist negative labels on them, while also acknowledging that a <br/>
certain personality type doesnt always fit in to the way we currently <br/>
live our lives. I think that for most parents, a diagnosis of ADHD <br/>
quickly leads to medicating the &quot;disorder&quot;, and i am doubtful that one <br/>
can take a medication for a personality &quot;deficit&quot; and not have it <br/>
change other aspects of your personality (ones you DONT want to <br/>
change!)<br/>
<br/>
Any experience with kids who have this type of personality, and how <br/>
they adjust as adults? Is there a way to help a child improve their <br/>
memory? Ideas for improving coordination? <br/>
<br/>

community. Their advice changes all the time. <br/>
<br/>
Look at how many &quot;symptoms&quot; of ADHD are the same as childhood onset <br/>
bipolar disorder...indeed, many kids who are bipolar (although, again, <br/>
there is controversy there as well)are misdiagnosed, put on stimulants <br/>
for ADHD, which can cause bipolar kids to have psychotic episodes, and <br/>
almost always makes them worse. I&#39;m on alot of adoption-related lists, <br/>
and you wouldnt believe the alphabet-soup of labels those kids get. <br/>
Some of it might be necessary, as some kids do have serious issues as <br/>
a result of early neglect/abuse not to mention prenatal alcohol and <br/>
drug exposure. And usually you need that diagnosis to access special <br/>
services in school or specialized therapy. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see how, though, in an unschooling home that practices mindful <br/>
parenting, that it is necessary to have that official label. You are <br/>
going to have to deal with your child as he or she is, right now, <br/>
whether a doctor proclaims they have a certain disorder or not. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But in the case of FAS or FAE, its organic brain damage(and pretty <br/>
severe at that...as my adoption social worker said &quot;Crack is better <br/>
than alcohol&quot; when it comes to prenatal exposure.) Its permanent. Kids <br/>
with FAS dont understand cause and effect, and generally need to <br/>
relearn the same things over and over again, they don&#39;t retain the <br/>
information. Its clearly a disability that affects functioning. Many <br/>
kids with FAS do not become fully fuctional, independant adults.<br/>
<br/>
For my son, it seems more about not &quot;seeing&quot; things that are right in <br/>
front of him, that i can clearly see. I *do* think its part of <br/>
the &quot;ADHD-type behaviors&quot; in that perhaps his brain is moving so fast, <br/>
that he can&#39;t slow down enough to take in the &quot;big picture&quot;. I&#39;m <br/>
hopeful that as he matures, he will gain more control over that part <br/>
of his brain. Or find useful tools to help him remember or find stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Also its possible that the things that i&#39;m expecting him to &quot;see&quot; just <br/>
arent that important enough to him to look for. Which is ok too.<br/>
