&quot;Here in Australia the childhood obesity rate is soaring, and children <br/>
as young<br/>
as 10 years old are developing type 2 diabetes. It all comes down to<br/>
poor diet and lack of education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
To quote the Hertz commercial:<br/>
<br/>
Not exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Poor *school* diets----and not being allowed to eat when hungry and <br/>
being made to eat when not hungry and being made to eat quickly and not <br/>
being allowed to eats several snacks during the day.<br/>
<br/>
And too *much* education---children made to sit at desks for literally <br/>
HOURS at a time.  Made to do homework at the kitchen table for HOURS <br/>
each evening. No recess. No fresh air. Little sleep. Rushed through <br/>
meals to get to all the school activities.<br/>
<br/>
SCHOOL is causing childhood obesity.<br/>
<br/>
Children are NOT learning when they are hungry, when they are full, <br/>
when they are tired, when they are rested, or when they are in need of <br/>
exercise.<br/>
<br/>
Because of *school*.<br/>
