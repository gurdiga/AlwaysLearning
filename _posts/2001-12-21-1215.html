<div id="ygrps-yiv-520062075">&lt;&lt; I get much more from the Paul/Linda relationship than I did from the <br/>
John/Yoko one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get a thing from either one.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe I&#39;m weird.  I don&#39;t care who&#39;s doing what outside their jobs <br/>
(within reason).  I like Peewee Herman no matter what movies he watches in <br/>
Florida when his parents are asleep.  I think Michael Jackson is a stunning <br/>
dancer and singer and songwriter no matter what his plastic surgery <br/>
addictions or personal interpersonal weirdnesses.  I liked the way Ethan <br/>
Hawke did Hamlet, and when  a friend snorted and said something about who he <br/>
was married to, not only did I not know, but I couldn&#39;t imagine for the life <br/>
of me what it would matter, when I was talking about Hamlet.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are more into the whole person and deciding whether to like them <br/>
by their arrest record or politics or diet.  I like to look at musicians&#39; <br/>
music and writers&#39; writing and actors&#39; acting and try maybe to let them have <br/>
some privacy.<br/>
<br/>
I do read biographies and interviews, and it does help to know sometimes why <br/>
someone is doing, writing, being the way he is, but I don&#39;t reject an <br/>
otherwise impressive body of work for religious or political or social <br/>
reasons.  (I hope not; I&#39;m not thinking of anything, and I&#39;m running through <br/>
the files.)<br/>

<br/>
  Although there are a lot of excellent John Lennon songs post Beatles, I always thought the whole idea of Paul & Linda being married and in a band together was sweet. So many of their songs are just love songs. That, and I love Wings music.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I like Peewee Herman no matter what movies he watches in <br/>
  Florida when his parents are asleep.&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
  So do I! My kids and I still enjoy watching Pee Wee&#39;s Big Adventure time after time. I even used to watch the Saturday morning show before kids (that is a real confession!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I think Michael Jackson is a stunning dancer and singer and songwriter no matter what his plastic surgery addictions or personal interpersonal weirdnesses.&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
  I respect Michael Jackson for what he has accomplished in his life, and I even liked a few of his songs. But everytime I see his picture, I wonder why he felt he needed to change his appearance so much.<br/>
