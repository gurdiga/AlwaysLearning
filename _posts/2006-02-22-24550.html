<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573043271">I think there&#39;s a pagan unschooling list (or maybe it&#39;s pagan<br/>
homeschoolers), that branched off of the Unschooling Discussion list.  It <br/>
was a while<br/>
back...is it still in existance?<br/>
<br/>
**There is a list called &quot;Pagan Homeschool&quot; that was started by me and dozen <br/>
or so other women about ten years ago. We met on some AOL boards and <br/>
discovered that we had more in common than educational decisions. This list <br/>
is still in existence although many of us oldtimers are no longer there. It <br/>
is not promarily an unschooling list....just as with all segments of <br/>
society, there are as many ways that pagans hs as there are pagans...more, <br/>
in fact &lt;G&gt;....like herding cats, you know.<br/>
