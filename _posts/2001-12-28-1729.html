<div id="ygrps-yiv-526264656">oh I LOVED the cooperage.  What a great place<br/>
to go.  I used to love to go see, oh what was<br/>
his name, Steve... someone. tall thin man,<br/>
great voice, good humor, older than I (i&#39;m<br/>
36), had a red hand held piano (like a guitar<br/>
but a piano) which he used to make derogitory<br/>
phallic symbol jokes about, and played &quot;doing<br/>
the butt&quot; all the time, steve... always ended<br/>
the songwith some line about how he didn&#39;t<br/>
have a butt at all (and he didn&#39;t!).  Oh just<br/>
realized, that wasn&#39;t cooperage, that was<br/>
Chelsea Street pub.  But I hung at Cooperage<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Other bands...<br/>
<br/>
Della Street, with Marshal Nelson, and my<br/>
cousin, Mark Scheele, Marshal is now living<br/>
out here in California working at a music<br/>
store.  Ron Logan was also in that band,<br/>
alwasy wonder what happened to him.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Hillery, oh, what was the name of the<br/>
blues band she was in.  She was WONDERFUL.<br/>
They playced Cooperage and Chelsea street<br/>
pub.<br/>
