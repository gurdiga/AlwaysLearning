<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784900436">Because Pam Laricchia introduced her book at ALLive in Minnesota, an Always Learning Live symposium, I feel a little godmotherish or something—like I was there while it was still damp, or something.   Vague mushy feeling. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m honored that she chose that event in Rochester where she and Alex and I spoke to launch Life through the Lens of Unschooling.<br/>

It&#39;s been great fun putting it together—the print book is a whopping 309 pages!<br/>
<br/>
And as a thanks to you guys for being a part of the community, I have a special launch price of $2.99US for the ebook and $11.99US for the print edition (you&#39;re welcome to share it at the introductory price with your groups and communities as well). In about a week they will go to their regular list prices of $4.99US and $13.99US, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
+++++++++++++++<br/>

Amazon being mysterious. they have listed it for a dollar less than that, even.  I could be irritated with Amazon (which I sometimes am, because they undercut my price on their site, with some of my own books :-)  ), OR BETTER... I could let you know that at least the American offering is even less than Pam listed.<br/>

<br/>
And anyone anywhere, I think, can get a kindle version (or iPad, if you download the kindle reader).<br/>
