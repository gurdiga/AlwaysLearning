<div id="ygrps-yiv-372494027">Wow!  Thanks Sandra...I had no idea about either of those freebies.  We got 2000 points and a food item for each pet, and for Christmas 489 points, an action figure and a quilt :0)<br/>
<br/>
Aimee (5) loves Neopets at the moment, but mostly she likes to watch me play it on herbehalf.  Josh (8) loves a multitude of online games, and he seems very good at working out how to get the most points quickly- he may alreayd know about the freebies,- I can&#39;t wait to tell him when he wakes up!  Thanks again.<br/>
