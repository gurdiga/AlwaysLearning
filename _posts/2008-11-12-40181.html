<div id="ygrps-yiv-847404019">I got side mail from someone thoughtful and on the list, not a crazy  <br/>
stalker this time.   But still, I&#39;m going to respond to it as though  <br/>
it were anonymous.<br/>
<br/>
The first part involves recent discussions about whether a child is  <br/>
&quot;in control&quot; of his own life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-not long after the above thread you said this: &quot;I&#39;m in control at  <br/>
my house. Me and Keith, but he&#39;s let me make kid decisions always,  <br/>
and he advises me when he thinks I&#39;m going crooked or not thinking  <br/>
clearly.&quot;  Clearly you were using it in a different way but I&#39;m not  <br/>
sure how.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Let me use &quot;autonomy,&quot; then.  As regards being the parent of my three  <br/>
children, I&#39;m not &quot;autonomous&quot; in those decisions, because Keith is  <br/>
their dad and he&#39;s right there.  But Keith and I decided together to  <br/>
parent in gentle, progressive, counter-culture ways, and because we  <br/>
have the right to make a decision like that and the power to enforce  <br/>
it, we decided that and so we control the environment.  We set it up,  <br/>
we protect and defend it, and we maintain it.  That takes some control.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;the power to enforce it,&quot; I mean we&#39;re not in trouble with the  <br/>
law (not on probation or otherwise limited), we&#39;re not having to fend  <br/>
off interference from relatives and we&#39;re not afraid.  We have the  <br/>
confidence and the money to do what we&#39;ve decided we want to do.<br/>
<br/>
What we in our power and control have decided to do is to give our  <br/>
children lots of freedom and choices.  Not freedom and choices at  <br/>
other people&#39;s houses or at their jobs, because we don&#39;t control  <br/>
those environments, but when they&#39;re in situations in which other  <br/>
people&#39;s parents might be saying &quot;Sit still, be quiet, go to sleep  <br/>
beause it&#39;s 8:00&quot; and on and on, we don&#39;t do that.  The reason we  <br/>
have the freedom and choice to do that is a larger political  <br/>
question.  Not everyone in the world does.  Not everyone in our state  <br/>
and our county does.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has some autonomy (I&#39;m thinking Marty because he&#39;s home and I  <br/>
was just talking to him).  He was free to decide to drive to Las  <br/>
Cruces (other end of the state) earlier this month.  Today a traffic  <br/>
ticket came from an automatic camera.  It&#39;s in my name.  He expected  <br/>
it.  He was going 45 in a 35, through a green light.  Not a capital  <br/>
crime.  Not a dangerous crime.  It was 2:45 in the morning and he was  <br/>
the only car in the intersection.   The ticket is in my name because  <br/>
the loan and title of his car are in my name until  he pays it off.   <br/>
He had the right and power and freedom to be out driving.  Does he  <br/>
have the right to ignore that ticket?  No, and he doesn&#39;t even want  <br/>
to.  The friend he was taking to Las Cruces had already offered to  <br/>
pay for the ticket, but Marty won&#39;t press him to do that.  So who&#39;s  <br/>
in charge?  Who&#39;s in control?   Nobody&#39;s needing to be in control.   <br/>
The stat is in control of what they&#39;ll do if we ignore this ticket.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  First move is the price would go up to $100.  Next move might be  <br/>
a warrant for Marty&#39;s arrest?  No, wait... Mine!<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers seem to want to take their freedom to fantasy land.<br/>
Unschooling is learning from the real world.  Some unschoolers seem  <br/>
to be not even wanting to live in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
So thanks, you kind-of anonymous correpondent, for helping me see  <br/>
where some of the misinformation and confusion is coming from.  I&#39;m  <br/>
going to bring some of the other stuff from that e-mail to the list too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816597347">From the e-mail, too:<br/>
<br/>
-=- The language of *giving* them autonomy jumps into our heads.  And  <br/>
its such a simple jump for us to make.  Its not an idea that&#39;s put  <br/>
out by the vets who *get* it though, its more of an assumption on the  <br/>
parts of us newbies, at least that&#39;s how I think I&#39;ve<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
But we DO give them autonomy.  Parents can share power with kids but  <br/>
they can&#39;t abrogate it.  I can&#39;t just decide not to care what my kids  <br/>
do, not to know what they do.  I can&#39;t just decide that my kids can  <br/>
do anything in the whole wide world.  For one thing, lots of it might  <br/>
be illegal or dangerous.  For another thing, I don&#39;t own the whole  <br/>
wide world.<br/>
<br/>
First I need to understand what my realm of responsibility and  <br/>
freedom and control are, and then I can  let my kids romp and play  <br/>
within that.<br/>
<br/>
If I want to let my kids hit me, it would be stupid, but I could  <br/>
legally do it (until they get old enough to have the police called on  <br/>
them, and then anyone could report it and I wouldn&#39;t be able to say  <br/>
&quot;it&#39;s okay&quot;).  If I want to let my kids hit other people, that is NOT  <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
If I want to let my kids take money out of my wallet without asking,  <br/>
I can legally do that.  I can&#39;t let them take money out of other  <br/>
people&#39;s wallets.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people looking at radical unschooling think an old set  <br/>
of rules is being replaced with a new and opposite set of rules but  <br/>
it&#39;s not like that at all.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t let a child be &quot;autonomous,&quot; but I can absolutely give him a  <br/>
huge range of options and considerations and respect and freedom.  It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t make him autonomous.  It makes him answerable to me and his dad.<br/>

We occasionally visit my family which all has very strict rules about TV watching.  It can only be turned on at night, last thing before bed.  Eli is used to having the TV on much of the time.  I think he really likes the TV on in large group situations.  It gives him a way to disconnect from the group.  He gets easily overwhelmed.  <br/>

Staying at a hotel is not an option for financial reasons and my family would not understand.  <br/>

<br/>
What do you expect people&#39;s answers to be here?<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t change the rules of courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
You either get courageous enough to speak to your relatives about  <br/>
making exceptions, or you take alternatives (iPod or CD player with  <br/>
headphones), or you don&#39;t visit the relatives.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
At my house, I don&#39;t like to have the TV or music on when people are  <br/>
trying to visit.  I would say no, if your son was here and wanted the  <br/>
TV on in a large group situation.  I wouldn&#39;t mind if he went in  <br/>
another room to watch TV, or played a gameboy, but it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
okay for anyone (mom or child) to ask me to turn the TV on (which  <br/>
would disturb conversations) so that it would be easier for one  <br/>
person to disconnect from the group.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He sometimes gets very distraught when he is not allowed to turn  <br/>

You could try not to visit so much, or at all, until he&#39;s older and  <br/>
has more personal tools.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Two thoughts come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Portable DVD players can be had pretty cheap these days, or a laptop in a bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Parent&#39;s attitudes have such a huge affect on how kids perceive reality.  If the parent has a <br/>
begrudging &quot;this is silly&quot; kind of attitude about the rules of another house, then their child <br/>
will reflect that attitude.  <br/>

This is how I&#39;ve always experienced family things, when I was a kid, and<br/>
now, with my in-laws.  There&#39;s always another room to go with all the<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
TV isn&#39;t really an issue at my in-law family gatherings, in fact,<br/>
sometimes I wish it could be turned off so that the noise level would be<br/>
less.  My husband&#39;s family is big and loud!  Sometimes, I go hang out in<br/>
the other room with the kids because it&#39;s quieter!</div>

<br/>
<br/>
***My sister&#39;s kids 5 and 4 are not allowed to watch TV at all.  It can only be turned on when they are in bed.  And my parents do fostering/adoption and have kids 16, 14, 13, 12 and 5 yo.  They are only allowed to watch at night.  The real problem is such a difference in the parenting styles makes it hard to find any type of compromise.   This year there were up to 17 of us over a two week period.<br/>
<br/>
On top of it all, I have the only boys.  The overwhelming energy they bring to gathering is unwelcome by my family.  They were not allowed to play smash brother on Wii when we where there because my boys got too excited.  It caused loud laughter and lots of jumping around.  <br/>
Sometimes we all have a good time and sometimes we don&#39;t.  This year got a little better as the boys were old enough to be outside alone.  My parents live at the end of a culdasac with sidewalk.  Eli often escaped to ride his bike or scooter outside.  And they love being in the hot tub.  I am hoping as they get older they will understand better, and we only go once a year.  <br/>

Whoa! That&#39;s a long time with a lot of people for a 7-year-old who is easily <br/>
overwhelmed. It would be too much for my dd at 13 and too much for me, frankly. <br/>
We&#39;ve often limited the time spent at relatives for this reason, and as dd gets <br/>
older, she handles visiting much better. She always takes her DS and iPod for <br/>

could you stay fewer days? Or not go at all?<br/>

jumping around going on in that house. Too bad for the kids who live there!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes we all have a good time and sometimes we don&#39;t.� This year got a <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m thinking, given the circumstances and the anti-boy-energy bias, I would join <br/>
my 7- and 6- year-olds outside alone in a relatively unfamiliar place, even if <br/>
it is grandma and grandpa&#39;s at the end of a cul de sac with a sidewalk!  It  <br/>
might be a good time to connect with them, while they are getting some of their <br/>
energy out. You can even talk about what&#39;s going on in the house, in terms of <br/>
the house &quot;rules&quot; while not actually having to enforce them in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Were you expected to stay in the house?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And they love being in the hot tub.� I am hoping as they get <br/>
&gt; older they will understand better, and we only go once a year.� <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you want them to understand? That &quot;rules&quot; are different, depending on <br/>
whose home it is? It&#39;s good to know. But if they have trouble with it or are not <br/>
grasping the &quot;rules,&quot; perhaps waiting until they *can* better understand it <br/>
would be preferable.<br/>
<br/>
Could you invite your parents and foster kids to your house?  Get together in a <br/>
neutral space?<br/>

We live in Nashville, and my sister lives in Indiana.  So I drive up to her house and pick her up and we drive together to NJ where my parents live.  Since we leave home first and get home last, we end up being gone for the longest time.  We spend two to three days in transit each way.  Dh stays home to work and 15 hours is a long drive alone.  It is more expensive to fly, and we need the extra vehicles.  This year we got 6 day passes to Great Adventure which is only a few days from their house.  It really made the time go better.  And at Live and Learn we made friends in NJ, so that is something we are looking forward to next year.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On top of it all, I have the only boys.  The overwhelming energy they<br/>
bring to <br/>
&gt; gathering is unwelcome by my family.<br/>
<br/>
But, you still go? Do you feel unwelcome, too? I know it&#39;s once a year, but<br/>

This is tough.  Since we go so rarely it is hard to figure out what will work ahead of time.  A year&#39;s growth is a lot at this age.  At home we have trampolines in the the house, a chin-up bar, and hopefully this weekend we will have a set of rings.  The only quiet activity is Legos which don&#39;t travel well.  We just have too many.  My mom bought a small set at a garage sale, but it hardly compares to a house full.  Besides there is almost always baby and they are a choking hazard.  <br/>
<br/>
My parents have been foster parents for 34 years and in that time have had about 4 boys and 40 girls.  There is a clear preference for girls.  However, they do try.  They just don&#39;t understand how they can still run around the house after an hour at the park!!  I&#39;m not sure either!!  I&#39;m not sure that the boy&#39;s are aware of the preference.  My parents are always very fair gift wise, and the boys rarely seek their attention.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom seems much happier to see me than the kids for the most part.  She like having adults around.  And love playing cards and such.  After 34 years of foster parenting she does not really seek out the kids.  It can bother me if I think too much about it.  Mostly I just view it as strange and her loss.  <br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; They were not allowed to play smash <br/>
&gt; brother on Wii when we where there because my boys got too excited.  It<br/>
caused <br/>
&gt; loud laughter and lots of jumping around.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too bad. I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s not usually a lot of loud<br/>
laughter or <br/>
jumping around going on in that house. Too bad for the kids who live there!<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
No, that sort of play should be &quot;taken outdoors.&quot;  And the older girls are into the hang out and talk stage of teens and pre-teens.  Jumping, screaming and such can only be tolerated in  very small doses.  <br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sometimes we all have a good time and sometimes we don&#39;t.  This year<br/>
got a <br/>
&gt; little better as the boys were old enough to be outside alone.  My<br/>
parents <br/>
live <br/>
&gt; at the end of a culdasac with sidewalk.  Eli often escaped to ride his<br/>
bike or <br/>
&gt; scooter outside.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking, given the circumstances and the anti-boy-energy bias, I would<br/>
join <br/>
my 7- and 6- year-olds outside alone in a relatively unfamiliar place, even if <br/>
it is grandma and grandpa&#39;s at the end of a cul de sac with a sidewalk!  It<br/>
 <br/>
might be a good time to connect with them, while they are getting some of their<br/>
<br/>
energy out. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I do usually follow them as soon as I can, but this year Eli was able to open the door alone, which meant he was not stuck if I was busy.  Or if it got loud he could escape quickly.  And sometimes I would follow them out and they would ask to be alone.  I think being able to get out alone helped their autonomy.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
You can even talk about what&#39;s going on in the house, in terms<br/>
of <br/>
the house &quot;rules&quot; while not actually having to enforce them in the<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
They really do well with most of it.  Food we work out by my kids eating something served, and also eating whatever else they like at odd times.  All the kids are on different night schedules so that is not too difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
It is really the TV and computer that Eli has a hard time with.  Until very recently we only had one and my parents have 5 and yet he can&#39;t watch whenever he wants to.  There is also a Wii, gamecube and two computers.  I understand why it is so confusing.  And because he is the only one having such a hard time, it is hard to get the other parents to work with me.  They just want him to be happy playing with his cousins and a small box of Legos.  I wish he could be, but he just isn&#39;t.  It took me years to except that TV helps him deal with overly social situations.  I guess it is not hard to understand why they don&#39;t see it.  I guess at some point it will come down to a question of how much compromising they are willing to do for us to come.  And of course the whole situation is more difficult because they all feel I should punish him more for his outbursts. <br/>
<br/>
I feel like this sounds much worse than it is.  I might have to spend some time before next summer thinking about how bad it is.  It sounds terrible written out, but it only feels that bad a few times a visit.   <br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Were you expected to stay in the house?<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
YES!!  It would be easier not to go than to stay in a hotel.  <br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And they love being in the hot tub.  I am hoping as they get <br/>
&gt; older they will understand better, and we only go once a year.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you want them to understand? That &quot;rules&quot; are different,<br/>
depending on <br/>
whose home it is? It&#39;s good to know. <br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Yes, better able to understand why their cousins are not allowed to watch TV.  Why things are so different from home.  Eli tends to get &quot;stuck&quot; when he wants something.  It is very hard for him to change gears and do something else.  There are times he is more or less open to suggestions.  When he is not it can take me up to an hour to get him to even consider another idea.  <br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
But if they have trouble with it or<br/>
are not <br/>
grasping the &quot;rules,&quot; perhaps waiting until they *can* better<br/>
understand it <br/>
would be preferable.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
How do you not go?  They are excited about the trip when it comes up.  They talk a lot about the hot tub.  The like their cousin and aunts.  I keep hoping for a good reason to skip the trip, but they do enjoy a lot of it, and I like for them to know their family.  At least a little.<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Could you invite your parents and foster kids to your house?  Get together in a<br/>
<br/>
neutral space?<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
They have come here, but it has to be when they are not caring for any little ones.  Our house is not child proof and Eli gets very mad when little ones get into his stuff.  Add that to cat allergies (we have three) and they have not been here in about 2 years.  It is better when they come, but with 5 kids it can be tough for them to travel.  Sometimes we see them at my sister&#39;s in Indiana.  She has a slightly bigger house than us, no cats, and is a few hours closer to my parents.  That is easier because we can make our own schedule.  It is easier to plan a short trip, except my other sister can never make it.  She is a teacher and also teaches summer school.  <br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all things to think about.  I hope I don&#39;t sound too negative.  I think some of it all comes from me being the youngest child, it is hard to get out of that sometimes.  Also, since we homeschool and I stay home, we end up working around everyone else&#39;s schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
I need to talk to my boys and find some ways to get their needs met better.  I get so overwhelmed when we are there, I have trouble thinking.  Maybe if I come up with ideas ahead of time it would be easier to implement them.  My boys are such homebodies, it can be difficult to get them out without a good plan.<br/>
<br/>
I hope my boys are not so conflicted about dh and me when they grow up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747787618">When we travel we have a couple of portable DVD players with us. Usually Simon is the one who uses them most. It gives him control of when he watches something that is somewhat removed from the rules of the house. It gives him a something to do when and if he withdraws to the bedroom. <br/>
<br/>
Somethings that really help is to get out of the house more. Find things going on where your relatives live that would be interesting to you and your family and invite anyone else to come along and go. See if there is a lego display going on at the local mall or a museum exhibit or a zoo or a botanic gardens or a cool park or whatever so that when you are there you are also out and about a lot. Bring new things to pull out in tense moments. Two player card games, so that he can be framed and buffered by engaging with you. <br/>
<br/>
Invite family to come to yours more often. Try not to go to theirs so much, maybe see if you can go when there are fewer people around so that it is less of a large group to deal with. Yesterday Linnaea and I went to a science museum that a home-ed group uses. It was very chaotic. She sat on a couch and read for some of the time. It helped her to deal with the noise and the activity and not knowing anyone in the group. When the planned activity began she was very engaged and enjoyed doing and playing. Up to that point she needed me with her or else she wanted something to withdraw into like the book. <br/>

We occasionally visit my family which all has very strict rules about TV watching.  It can only be turned on at night, last thing before bed.  Eli is used to having the TV on much of the time.  I think he really likes the TV on in large group situations.  It gives him a way to disconnect from the group.  He gets easily overwhelmed.  <br/>
<br/>
He sometimes gets very distraught when he is not allowed to turn on the TV.  All my family lives out of state so we are there for at least a few days, up to two weeks.  There are other kids involved everywhere we go.  I get stuck in respecting the rules of the house, and helping Eli.  I can distract him with a book, or a walk, or something, and sometimes it works better than others.  <br/>
Staying at a hotel is not an option for financial reasons and my family would not understand.  <br/>

<br/>
I was up last night thinking and I think a lot of the problem is I have homebodies.  Even around town with friends Eli prefers to be home.  He says at home he has his toys and can do and eat what he wants, when he wants.  He gets upset if we are at the playground too long.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a portable DVD player for the car and I might have to set that up where is has permanate access to it.  I have been trying to avoid having a big discussion with my family about exactly how our house is run.  I don&#39;t really want their suggestions or input and I know they are not on-board with our choices.  Well, since we normally go in August I have about 8 months to figure out what to say.<br/>

<br/>
If your kids are homebodies, then that is Who They Are. Having homebodies is <br/>
not the problem. The problem is trying to fight that, or change that, or <br/>
force situations that aren&#39;t comfortable on them.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really Have To go to these overwhelmingly huge family gatherings - do <br/>
you Have To go at that particular time with all the added emotional stress <br/>
of it being a holiday? Do you Have To stay that long?<br/>
<br/>
There were a number of years when we specifically avoided our family <br/>
Christmas gathering because it seemed to be too much for both Jayn and <br/>
James - and it was his folks! When we do go, we leave the instant any of us <br/>
become overwhelmed. Do your kids want to be there? For how long? Do they <br/>
feel they can opt out?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an idea that may or may not apply.<br/>
<br/>
My SIL does a holiday open house with light buffet snacks that is so much <br/>
easier since it is expected that people won&#39;t necessarily stay all night. If <br/>
you do something like that, especially if you are inviting work colleagues, <br/>
you have a great excuse....er I mean reason not to travel to the family <br/>
thing. &quot;It&#39;s important for work&quot; is a reason most people can understand.<br/>

It&#39;s okay for a child not to love to be with relatives for two  <br/>

would love overnight visits with friends, or two day vacations with a  <br/>

You have many months before the  next scheduled visit to become more  <br/>
more comfortable with unschooling, if you&#39;re considering this an  <br/>
unschooling matter.  You&#39;ve received many suggestions about making  <br/>
choices, and about options you might consider when you&#39;re there, and   <br/>
about when, whether and for how long to be there at all.  They&#39;ll be  <br/>
in the archives if you ever want to review them.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s move back toward discussing the principles of unschooling now,  <br/>
and away from more particulars of one situation.  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
Sorry - I guess I was making an assumption about it being holidays since <br/>
they are fast approaching.<br/>
<br/>
Still do your kids want to go? Do they want to stay as long?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;****I did not mean it was their problem, just the problem with traveling. <br/>
It is easy to work with at home, it is just how to take it on the road. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s easy to work with at home! That&#39;s what &quot;homebody&quot; means isn&#39;t <br/>
it. So the question you are asking is &quot;How do I take my kids on the road <br/>
when they hate being on the road?&quot; The first response is going to be &quot;Do <br/>
they really have to go on the road? Do they really have to go on the road <br/>
now?&quot; Only after the answer really being absolutely &quot;Yes they do&quot;, THEN we <br/>
would get into some ideas for making it better for them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m totally confused now. I thought it was your dh&#39;s family that you were <br/>
visiting. I&#39;d better re read the whole thread.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you visiting them? Are the positives outweighing the negatives - for <br/>
all of you? These are not questions you have to answer to me, but something <br/>
to look deep into your heart for. If the answer is anywhere in the realm of <br/>
&quot;obligated&quot; or &quot;no choice&quot; I would examine that too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; weeks.  It&#39;s okay for a child to need his own space.  But maybe he<br/>
&gt; would love overnight visits with friends, or two day vacations with a<br/>
&gt; parent or two.  He might love two day visits with relatives. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we&#39;re hearing more about what the kids aren&#39;t enjoying, and how they <br/>
are having to cope rather than enjoy the visit.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t heard much of what if anything they like about seeing their <br/>
relatives or travelling. There could be more to the story.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to encourage the poster, and everyone, to ask their kids what they <br/>
would like to do, if they want to visit relatives, if they&#39;d like a shorter <br/>
trip. I&#39;ve asked Jayn for years and every time.<br/>

Yes, and it&#39;s about priorities, too.  Sometimes visits home  have to  <br/>
do with maintaining inheritance or doing financial business.  Keith  <br/>
and his dad always sit down for a long time and talk about loans and  <br/>
insurance and such.  Sometimes visits have to do with competitiveness  <br/>
between siblings.  If so, fine.  That doesn&#39;t mean the in-law person  <br/>
(that would be me, in Keith&#39;s family&#39;s scenario) can&#39;t take the kids  <br/>
and go to museums or the zoo or something.  Maybe one of the  <br/>
grandparents would want to go.  Maybe both.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it can go totally to the child&#39;s preference, and other  <br/>
times it can&#39;t, but it&#39;s helpful if the parents are really clear on   <br/>
why they&#39;re visiting and what their options are.<br/>
<br/>
Too much &quot;because we always do&quot; or &quot;because we have to&quot; thinking can  <br/>
be bad for unschooling, and is always bad for clarity and mindfulness.<br/>

***I think this is really the heart of the matter.  How much choice can I give the kids in this?  They enjoy parts (cousins, hot tub, day trips), but not others (lack of control, long car ride, overwhelming).   I asked both the boys about visiting and they said they did not want to, until I reminded them of the parts they like.<br/>
 We don&#39;t want to cut of relations with either side of the family, but nobody visits us much.  In order to maintain a relationship with them we have to go see them at times.  My boys don&#39;t talk on the phone, or send letters.  Do we force the boys along and try our best to make it better? Or do we give the kids the option to stop visiting, which might mean no one visits and there are lots of bad feelings from relations?  <br/>
Oh the trials and tribulations of living close enough to visit family, but too far to make it easy.<br/>
Lots to think about.....<br/>

<br/>
Would it really be a big discussion if you were to set it up in your room with headphones?  <br/>
I&#39;m used to having  a private space when we visit family--maybe it&#39;s not like that for you.  <br/>
<br/>
Even so, it seems to me that a simple statement that he likes to/is used to  having more time <br/>
alone doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it has to become a big discussion.  Would your family argue <br/>
with that?  <br/>

<br/>
Your kids are really little still. You&#39;re forcing something because  <br/>
you want them to feel part of your extended family? Consider the  <br/>
possibility that by pushing it, the whole thing might backfire. I  <br/>
never have contact with cousins that I was forced to visit when we  <br/>
were little, and one of them lives only a half-day drive away. I  <br/>
haven&#39;t spoken directly to her in years. My memories of visiting her  <br/>
house are not great - her dad was a dictator and I was always scared  <br/>
I&#39;d do something wrong and bring down his wrath. Felt I had to walk on  <br/>
eggshells all the time.<br/>

***Strangely , yes.  My mom does not even like my dad to watch TV.  And with two of the children not allowed to watch at all, it sets up a strange dynamic between the cousins.  Which does not make it impossible, just a bigger problem than it might otherwise be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um, not necessarily. That sounds like obligation. More &quot;have-to&#39;s&quot;. Have you read this?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/haveto">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s mostly about kids&#39; learning, but the theme of &quot;choice&quot; that runs through it might be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My boys don&#39;t talk on the phone, or send letters.� <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Six- and seven-year-olds are very young to be doing that.  Mom or dad can keep in touch through e-mail, letters, phone calls, sending photos or even videos of what the kids are doing.  <br/>
<br/>
This way, the parents get to control what information goes to extended family. Not to make it all sweetness and light, but maybe it can change that seemingly inevitable &quot;discussion&quot; about parenting and lifestyle, when grandparents feel informed about their grandchildren&#39;s lives.<br/>

Blogs with photos.<br/>
<br/>
My inlaws don&#39;t do internet, but sometimes I print out the photos  <br/>
from a recent blog page and send those with a letter.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those whose parents and inlaws have internet access, a blog can  <br/>
be a great way to update them regularly on what kids are doing and  <br/>
how they look, and they&#39;re not there to object to what you&#39;ve been  <br/>
doing and you can show them the sparkly best parts.<br/>
