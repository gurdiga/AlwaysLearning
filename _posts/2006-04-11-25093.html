<div id="ygrps-yiv-57488927">Hi, again....  Since I only began unschooling 8 weeks ago, and my son is almost 16, would the NE Unschooling conference not be in our best interest to attend?   I was planning to come with him.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your thoughts on this.<br/>
<br/>
Health and laughter,<br/>
