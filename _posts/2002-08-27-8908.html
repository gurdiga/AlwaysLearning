Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear you&#39;re having problems, but not surprised -- this kind of<br/>
driving each other crazy is pretty common when you try to bring school to<br/>
your home. :)<br/>
<br/>
This is a fairly advanced unschooling list, which might not be the best fit<br/>
for your needs at present (though you&#39;re welcome to stay).<br/>
<br/>
My suggestions are you go to www.unschooling.com and read the message boards<br/>
there. You can also sign up for a more &quot;general unschooling&quot; message board<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also suggest reading either or both of these books, which can be found<br/>
used at www.abebooks.com (or, probably, new at www.amazon.com):<br/>
<br/>
Learning All the Time by John Holt<br/>
The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to e-mail me privately I&#39;d be happy to recommend other<br/>
resources as well, but really www.unschooling.com, especially the message<br/>
board archives there, will give you a very good start.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528521453">I started homeschooling the same way you did, but<br/>
after several months I realized  it wasn&#39;t going to<br/>
work.  I couldn&#39;t understand why my kids were<br/>
revolting with me and than I realized that they felt<br/>
comfortable enough with me to voice their opinion<br/>
about school books, flash cards and anything else that<br/>
smells of school.  I picked up the Unschooling<br/>
Handbook by Mary Griffith and it convienced me that<br/>
unschooling was not only cheaper, but the best choice<br/>
for my kids.  I realize also that all children learn<br/>
differently and this concept seem to accomodate all of<br/>
them.  Another book that helped me was by Thomas<br/>
Armstrong Awakening your Child&#39;s Genius, this for me<br/>
was kind of a step by step unschooling book.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry alot of us have been down the same road<br/>
your not alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263640013">Hi!<br/>
Are you familiar at all with unschooling?   Did you choose this list<br/>
because that&#39;s the direction you think you&#39;d like to go?<br/>
There are some very good posts in the archives here, in addition to the<br/>
ideas Pam and Sandra offered.  <br/>
Maybe you and your children would enjoy a few weeks vacation from school<br/>
at home while you read about unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you.<br/>

children play because that&#39;s how they&#39;re hardwired to learn. Why do you<br/>
think the pull to play is so strong? :-) They&#39;re *trying* to learn in ways<br/>
that are meaningful to them but we keep stopping them.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the message board, there are lists of books at the<br/>
Unschooling.com website too.<br/>
<br/>
You might also try the unschooling.com list<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> where your question gets asked<br/>
and answered very often.<br/>
