&lt;&lt; I hear that a lot when I&#39;m in the library.  A parent will tell the child<br/>
 that they already have enough books, or they must take 2 and only 2, or<br/>
 something like that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Really!!!<br/>
Long before I was even thinking about unschooling (heck, I hadn&#39;t thought <br/>
about homeschooling yet) when Trevor was three, we overheard a mother saying <br/>
&quot;you have a bunch of books at home we haven&#39;t even read yet, you don&#39;t need <br/>
any of THESE&quot; as she hauled her crying dd out of the library.<br/>
SHEESH!! I thought the whole point of going to the library was to get free <br/>
BOOKS.<br/>
But apparently she thought her dd should go to story time and just ignore the <br/>
rows and rows of wonderful books in front of her.<br/>
I remember being very angry and Trevor asking why the little girl couldn&#39;t <br/>
have books.<br/>
I told him her Mommy wasn&#39;t very nice or something unkind I&#39;m sure. :(<br/>
We were both baffled.<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
