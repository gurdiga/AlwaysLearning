<div id="ygrps-yiv-631029025">I also watched most episodes of Temptation Island. When it would start to<br/>
get really sick (watching the videos part) I would getnerally phase it out<br/>
of my concentration. get a drink etc. I dislike seeing people in true<br/>
emotional pain. I just loved to stare at the orange haired woman. She was so<br/>
exotic looking and beautiful. I loved her bone structure.<br/>
BTW, every couple on that first season has since broken up. Huge surprise.<br/>

Yippee - Kai - Yay!<br/>

fuss about it from pulpits.  And other music, too. <br/>
Satan&#39;s influence, and all that. Seems odd, to me,<br/>
that it is My generation doing so much complaining,<br/>
now. Is this still The Age of Aquarius?<br/>
