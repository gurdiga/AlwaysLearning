<div id="ygrps-yiv-181767636">Holly&#39;s friend is reading (by assignment of her mom) Are you There, God? It&#39;s <br/>
Me, Margaret, by Judy Blume.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted to read it, so I took her and bought a copy just a bit ago.<br/>
<br/>
She sat down to read.  She&#39;s not so fluent at this kind of text yet, but she <br/>
wants to try to pass her friend.  (Healthy competition?  Maybe or maybe not, <br/>
but I didn&#39;t discuss that with her.  I did warn her that some people don&#39;t <br/>
discuss books just the way you&#39;d like them, that while one is talking about <br/>
what a character might have been thinking and why they did things, the other <br/>
might just be saying &quot;Isn&#39;t it interesting that her sister&#39;s name was <br/>
&#39;Boobsie&#39;?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
First thing she asked me from the other room was, &quot;What is s-o-c-i-a-l ?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said the word.<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Funny!<br/>
<br/>
She knows &quot;sociable,&quot; but didn&#39;t know &quot;social,&quot; so it&#39;s not too weird.  But <br/>
the difference between her social life and her...   there is no difference.  <br/>
Her whole LIFE is social!!<br/>
