<div id="ygrps-yiv-490956217">hi,<br/>
<br/>
my son (10) just expressed an interest in watching some wildlife videos.  he was remembering a facinating movie about a silkworm factory he saw when he was still in school - and then made the leap to the wildlife thing - so anything in between those two genres might be interesting too.  any suggestions?  sources for such media?<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

Sometimes, my kids get into an animal/wild life kick, and on those<br/>
occasions, we&#39;ve left the TV on all day, on Animal Planet.  We actually<br/>
did that last week and watched an interesting variety of things on and<br/>
off all day long.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187354013"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.arkive.org/">http://www.arkive.org/</a> has pictures, videos, and descriptions of how<br/>
animals live.  We looked at that a lot when my daughter was really<br/>
into watching animals nurse.  Just note that you need to search for<br/>
&quot;suckling&quot; as nursing doesn&#39;t seem to be the term they use most of the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Animals are Beautiful People&quot; is great.  It is an old<br/>
movie/documentary by the people who did &quot;The Gods Must Be crazy&quot; and<br/>
it has some of that same charm.  It is very fast paced and action<br/>
filled and has cool things like finding water in the desert using an<br/>
ant hill, melon seeds and a salt lick.<br/>
<br/>
We loved &quot;Life of Mammals&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; was very good too.  They<br/>
are both narrated by David Attanborough and seem to have some overlap<br/>
in footage.  I think there is also &quot;Life of Birds&quot; but we haven&#39;t seen<br/>
it yet.<br/>
<br/>
We like some of the National Geographic videos too, but a lot of the<br/>
ones we have seen are slow paced and have a lot of talking.  Lots of<br/>
focus on the scientist and how they work.  My son, almost 3, loves the<br/>
video Dinosaur Hunters but their volcano documentary did nothing for<br/>
my daughter (5.5) who loves volcanoes.  There was a lion video, too,<br/>
that was ignored in spite of a love of lions.  My husband and I like<br/>
them, though :)<br/>
<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t gotten into the IMAX films that we have seen.  The<br/>
pace was too slow.... but maybe we have just seen the wrong ones.  I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear specific recommendations about things that people like.<br/>

too.  Here are some that I particularly remember:<br/>

and Blue Planet.  My kids basically love all of the BBC documentaries --<br/>
 including Walking with Dinosaurs and the prehistoric beasts one.  All <br/>
of these are available on Amazon, as they are not cheap, we have only <br/>
purchased the ones that aren&#39;t available at our local library which <br/>

Oh, I just went to itunes and looked up animal vodcasts, the Cleveland Zoo has one, there is an interesting, if slow, series of someone&#39;s strange backyard bird feeder and how birds handle getting at food in a heavy duty ziploc bag. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more. Oh, the natural sciences seems to be where to look. Interesting vodcasts there. Life on Terra looks like it might have potential. <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.arkive.org/">http://www.arkive.org/</a> has pictures, videos, and descriptions of how<br/>
animals live.  We looked at that a lot when my daughter was really<br/>
into watching animals nurse.  Just note that you need to search for<br/>
&quot;suckling&quot; as nursing doesn&#39;t seem to be the term they use most of the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Animals are Beautiful People&quot; is great.  It is an old<br/>
movie/documentary by the people who did &quot;The Gods Must Be crazy&quot; and<br/>
it has some of that same charm.  It is very fast paced and action<br/>
filled and has cool things like finding water in the desert using an<br/>
ant hill, melon seeds and a salt lick.<br/>
<br/>
We loved &quot;Life of Mammals&quot; and &quot;Planet Earth&quot; was very good too.  They<br/>
are both narrated by David Attanborough and seem to have some overlap<br/>
in footage.  I think there is also &quot;Life of Birds&quot; but we haven&#39;t seen<br/>
it yet.<br/>
<br/>
We like some of the National Geographic videos too, but a lot of the<br/>
ones we have seen are slow paced and have a lot of talking.  Lots of<br/>
focus on the scientist and how they work.  My son, almost 3, loves the<br/>
video Dinosaur Hunters but their volcano documentary did nothing for<br/>
my daughter (5.5) who loves volcanoes.  There was a lion video, too,<br/>
that was ignored in spite of a love of lions.  My husband and I like<br/>
them, though :)<br/>
<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t gotten into the IMAX films that we have seen.  The<br/>
pace was too slow.... but maybe we have just seen the wrong ones.  I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear specific recommendations about things that people like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954505236">The BBC series &#39;Galapagos&#39; (narrated by Tilda Swinton) is both a nature documentary and an <br/>
historical recreation of how Darwin first started to develop the theory of natural selection - <br/>
photography is absolutely stunning.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a number of little Schleich animal figurines that my daughter loves to use to act <br/>
out scenarios (most of them quite bloodthirsty!).  As a result of watching Planet Earth and <br/>
Walking with Dinosaurs so many times, she has quite a realistic view of how animals interact <br/>
in the wild.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200912325">We have really enjoyed the &quot;Nature&quot; shows produced by PBS.  They have<br/>
all been really fascinating and well done. The first one we saw was<br/>
&quot;Cloud - Wild Stallion of the Rockies&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/cloud-wild-stallion-of-the-rockies/introduction/29/">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/cloud-wild-stallion-of-the-rockies/introduction/29/</a><br/>
And  it remains our favorite - <br/>
You can get them from Netflix.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625784053">In addition to those mentioned, we liked the documentary &quot;The Wild  <br/>
Parrots of Telegraph Hill&quot;:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wildparrotsfilm.com/">http://www.wildparrotsfilm.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and my daughter&#39;s favorite animal movie (fiction, but good  <br/>
nonetheless) is &quot;Duma&quot; a story about the friendship between a boy and  <br/>
a cheetah:<br/>
