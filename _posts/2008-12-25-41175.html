<div id="ygrps-yiv-43138476">&lt;&lt;While I see what you&#39;re trying to do, the list makes people focus too much <br/>
on the environment as though if you just supply enough, you&#39;ll create an <br/>
educated child. At least that was my focus when I first heard about <br/>
unschooling and it made it harder for me to really get unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Yes, Yes. As soon as I read the topic I thought to myself, &#39;It&#39;s life, <br/>
why create an &#39;unschooling strewing curriculum list&#39; for it.   Our home has <br/>
been built of things / stuff we see and are interested in as we go about our <br/>
life.  I could have spent a lot of money strewing &#39;the list&#39; but instead I&#39;ve <br/>
spent the money on Tails passions as they come up.   I envision every <br/>
unschooling home looking quite different because each family&#39;s passions are <br/>
different.  For me, the importance has been Tails discovering the world and <br/>
not sitting in the house checking off the &#39;USCL&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I DO believe in having a home that is rich in environment but not in the <br/>
check off sense.  I can totally see the old me, taking that &#39;USCL&#39; and <br/>
purchasing everything on it in hopes of &#39;making&#39; unschooling happen.  To me, <br/>
unschooling is life so it just happens for our family as we&#39;re tumbling down <br/>
the road.  I can see a person getting sidetracked with unschooling by <br/>
focusing on the &#39;USCL&#39;.  I can see them saying things like, &quot;but I had <br/>
everything on the &#39;USCL&#39; and my child wants nothing to do with any of it&quot;. <br/>
To me, a home should be filled with the family&#39;s passions.  It should morph <br/>
and move as the years go by.  If I were to create a list - WOW, I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine how long it would truly be - I&#39;m thinking it would stretch around <br/>
the world over and over.  I&#39;m thinking that Tails would rather travel that <br/>
world discovering it for herself.  No &#39;USCL&#39; is needed for us; however, I <br/>
can see how it would help someone new to unschooling begin to &#39;see&#39; a <br/>
snapshot of an unschooling home.<br/>

Or a portrait of an ideal  unschooling home.<br/>
<br/>
We have things my kids have **loved**--still love.  Some were on the  <br/>
lists that have come by.  But not all kids would love them.    It&#39;s  <br/>
worth remembering, though, that some moms were never around  <br/>
&quot;educational materials&quot; or any recent art supplies, and didn&#39;t dabble  <br/>
in many hobbies before she had kids, and might not have a lot of  <br/>
ideas.   I think lists are great for idea-getting, if they&#39;re used as  <br/>
inspirations and jumping off places, but not as shopping lists or  <br/>
requirements.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month I put a list of lists here:<br/>

December 2, 2008, and while you&#39;re in there click a half a dozen of  <br/>
those links and you&#39;ll probably forget all about your need for a list  <br/>
of things.<br/>
