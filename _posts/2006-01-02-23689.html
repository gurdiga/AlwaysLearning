<div id="ygrps-yiv-708583712">Maryanne said something to the effect that she couldn&#39;t believe we <br/>
mean not yelling at all.  Yes that is something we strive for and <br/>
for the most part accomplish.  What came to mind when reading <br/>
maryanne&#39;s post is I was raised by a mother who yelled and hit and <br/>
did all sorts of stuff but I don&#39;t use her as my role modle no <br/>
matter how you are &quot;ingrained&quot;.  Very early on in my life I had a <br/>
friend&#39;s mother who I just dissided that she did things &quot;right&quot; and <br/>
I still try to modle myself after her.  Surely there is someone <br/>
somewhere who you could think of instead of your mother when in a <br/>
situation where you are just going to &quot;lose it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Also while I was reading the posts my daughter was playing baby at <br/>
my feet and just listening to the way she plays baby makes me so <br/>
proud.  She uses a kind voice while talking to her baby and is very <br/>
gental in her actions.   YOur daughter or son will most likely look <br/>
to you first as a role model on how to act with other&#39;s in general.  <br/>
The way you treat you children will be a service to so many others <br/>
than just your children.  It is important to take parenting and <br/>
rearing as seriously as you can.  Nobody thought it was possible to <br/>
run a 4(?)minute mile until it was done and now it has been done <br/>
many times.<br/>
