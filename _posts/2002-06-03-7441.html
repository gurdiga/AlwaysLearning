address was no good and came back undeliverable.....<br/>

they get sent on to anyone in your address book *and* anyone whose mail <br/>

meant to send it to you *and* you&#39;ve scanned it with your virus <br/>
protection.  And if you get an attachment with a double extension like the <br/>
one above, *.doc.pif, delete it immediately.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The people who make these viruses are getting more sophisticated all the <br/>
time in their efforts to get people to open the attachments.  One way to do <br/>
it is to make it look like it comes from a person you know.  To do that, it <br/>
will grab subject lines, even little pieces of the message itself.  I got <br/>
one like that a while back from one of my writing lists.  I almost opened <br/>
it before I thought to wonder why the person would answer with an <br/>
attachment to me rather than a post to the list.<br/>
Your first line of defense is good virus protection, updated regularly.  I <br/>
use PC-Cillin which offers a time-limited trial version.  You can set it to <br/>
update automatically whenever you go online.  Absolutely do that!  Mine <br/>
checks every time I go online and finds a new virus definition file on <br/>
average every 2 or 3 days.  That means there&#39;s a new virus or new version <br/>
of an old virus coming out that often.  Any virus protection that will do <br/>
that is probably ok, though I&#39;ve had enough problems with McAfee that I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t recommend it.<br/>
Your next line of defense is to be extremely skeptical of attachments.  My <br/>
cousins sent me a fancy Christmas card last year that was actually a <br/>
program (with a .exe extension).  They were a little miffed when I wrote <br/>
back to ask if they really sent it, but I just can&#39;t afford to get a virus.<br/>

them inserts an underline at the beginning of the address.  If you remove <br/>
it, the addy should work.  If they were doing that with mine, it would look <br/>
like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_leschke@...">_leschke@...</a> instead of the correct <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:leschke@...">leschke@...</a>.<br/>

member directories and trying to determine  why wasn&#39;t it the first on the <br/>
list alphabetically. Thanks again for a wealth of information!<br/>
