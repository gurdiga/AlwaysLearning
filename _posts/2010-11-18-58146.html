<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699927768">As part of a much longer post which was returned with several  <br/>
suggestions of other places to get the information, this phrase was  <br/>
used:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was wondering if it would be alright with everyone in this group  <br/>
for me to ... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>
The main page lists 2880 members of this yahoo group.<br/>
<br/>
What if 1440 agreed to something a member proposed to use the list for  <br/>
and the other 1440 didn&#39;t?  How many people would drop out of the  <br/>
group while we discussed and decided?<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just the thought of an instant, because the group has an  <br/>
owner and a stated purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve hung around young kids a lot the past few weeks and visited back  <br/>
and forth in several homes.  It&#39;s always been clear whose house it  <br/>
was.  There were some messes made, but it was up to the home owners to  <br/>
decide what was too messy and what was fine, and what was too loud and  <br/>
what was fine, and what could be jumped on and what couldn&#39;t.  If a  <br/>
child asks another child &quot;is it okay if we...&quot; maybe the child knows  <br/>
for sure it&#39;s okay, or maybe he asks his mom.  Sometimes the other  <br/>
child asks the mom directly.  Sometimes it might be something the mom  <br/>
needs to consult the other moms about, or the dad, but there is a  <br/>
point of veto, with the host mom if it&#39;s in a public place, or with  <br/>
the home owner mom if it&#39;s in her home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is it okay to let my kids [whatever]&quot; can&#39;t be answered without  <br/>
starting off with &quot;it depends&quot; and &quot;where?&quot;   There are lots of things  <br/>
people can do in their own home that aren&#39;t okay in another home.<br/>
<br/>
When deciding how to decide what to do in a situation (such as the  <br/>
Always Learning list) it can help to picture a party in a home.  Any  <br/>
kind of party, any kind of home.  Picture knowing what the theme was,  <br/>
or not knowing.  Picture knowing exactly who the hostess is and  <br/>
knowing her well enough to know what she believes, needs and is  <br/>
willing to tolerate, and picture NOT knowing.   It&#39;s okay not to  <br/>
know.  That happens at parties sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
If someone at a party at my house stood up and said &quot;I was wondering  <br/>
if it would be alright with everyone at this party for me to...&quot;<br/>
...smoke in the house<br/>
...smoke pot<br/>
...change the music<br/>
...make wild and crazy flaming mixed drinks<br/>
...drop a glowstick in the punch bowl<br/>
...cook up some ribs [I&#39;m living around multi-generational vegetarian  <br/>
Hindus this month]<br/>
...strip nekkid<br/>
...build a bonfire<br/>
...flood the front yard to play in the water<br/>
...tell everyone&#39;s fortune with cards/tea leaves/a Ouija board<br/>
...do a phrenological survey of everyone at the party...<br/>
<br/>
...what &quot;everyone at the party&quot; thought wouldn&#39;t matter.  What the  <br/>
hostess thought *would* matter.<br/>
It&#39;s better to ask the hostess than to ask &quot;everyone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes one can look at the party invitation or the group  <br/>
description and decide not to ask at all.  Or run through a list of  <br/>
why and why not, and figure out what&#39;s not a good thing to ask.<br/>
