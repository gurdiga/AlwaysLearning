<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112677662">Is there another title that would satisfy her that your children would be comfortable with? I can understand the children not wanting to call her grammie since she isn&#39;t theirs and she doesn&#39;t behave grammie-like toward them. But maybe there is something respectful that gives a nod to her connection to them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531653845">When Zac started talking he started calling one of his grandmother&#39;s &quot;Monie&quot; for some unknown reason and she loved it - thought it was so special because he had a special name for her.<br/>
<br/>
With my dad&#39;s wife we called her Grandma Alecia.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom is Nanna - but she picked that out for herself when she had her first grandchild - said that at age 47 she was too young to be a grandma or a granny.  At the time we&#39;d never hear anyone called Nana but now it is very common.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard:  Me Maw as a made up name for a grandmother <br/>
<br/>
As has been suggested maybe you and your children could come up with something.<br/>

It&#39;s not made up; it&#39;s traditional in the southeastern U.S.  I had a Mamaw and a Granny; &quot;mamaw&quot; and &quot;memaw&quot; must be cousins. :-)  I&#39;ve heard the former more, but have heard both lots over the years.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our kids call my mother &#39;Baba-Bee&#39; (toddler pronunciation of Grandma V for Victoria) and it stuck for all of us too. My mother loved it, though confessed she was relieved when she first saw it spelled out in print as she wouldn&#39;t have appreciated being called &#39;Bubba.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
Our kids never met my husband&#39;s mother as she had passed away long before Ray and I met. They refer to her by her first name &#39;Carmen&#39; but always add, &quot;she&#39;s daddy&#39;s mama who went back to the earth.&quot; We never told them that; they extrapolated from discussions of various halloween jack-o-lanterns, christmas trees and the three dogs who&#39;ve passed on. Thankfully everyone in the family finds the expression charming.<br/>
