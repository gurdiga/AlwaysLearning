<div id="ygrps-yiv-223891590">Nice to see there are other people who also don&#39;t mark their books.<br/>
<br/>
I obviously used to mix with the wrong sort of people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found in the past that people thought I was odd or that the subject was<br/>
just plain boring.<br/>
<br/>
I actually find the mechanical process of reading quite interesting.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk now of being boring does anyone give any attention to<br/>
page-turning.<br/>
<br/>
When I was at school we had a teacher who took us for &#39;library lesson&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
This consisted of us sitting down in absolute silence and just reading.<br/>
<br/>
He used to patrol the aisles with a ruler.<br/>
<br/>
If he caught anyone turning the pages incorrectly he would hit them on the<br/>
hand with the edge of the ruler.<br/>
<br/>
The &#39;correct&#39; way was putting your finger underneath the top right hand<br/>
corner of the right hand page and sliding the page over.<br/>
<br/>
I never did find out how left handers got on !<br/>
<br/>
Despite having a lot of residual bad habits resulting from not wanting to do<br/>
what school taught me, this is one habit that has stayed with me.<br/>

I guess he wouldn&#39;t have been too happy to see you lick your finger so that<br/>
the page would stick to it as we you tried to turn it........<br/>

When I was at school we had a teacher who took us  for &#39;library lesson&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
 <br/>
I was shown that by two or three teachers.  It was a matter of  etiquette and <br/>
courtesy.  In a library, the books don&#39;t belong to the  reader, and I was in <br/>
school in the 60&#39;s, when the teachers had grown up with  expensive books, and <br/>
weren&#39;t fully aware how relatively inexpensive book  production would become.  <br/>
It&#39;s not only better for the book, it&#39;s  quieter.  Nobody hit us with a <br/>
ruler, though.  How could THAT be quiet  and good library etiquette!? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
When I went to the university in the early 70&#39;s, they had just recently  gone <br/>
from a longtime closed-stacks library (patrons brought the call number and  <br/>
an employee got the book and brought it back to the charge desk) partly because <br/>
 (Keith and I discussed this just Wednesday!) they had a 7 floor book tower <br/>
with  a cage elevator.  Dangerous.<br/>
 <br/>
But in the early 70&#39;s they opened that up.  There were books from the  19th <br/>
century there.  I had a boyfriend who used to love old stuff too, and  we would <br/>
go and just find the oldest books we could and sit and look at the  details <br/>
of the bindings and illustrations and such.  (Now they&#39;re all in  special <br/>
collections rooms, back to the closed stacks plan and you can&#39;t just  cruise for <br/>
age or binding.)<br/>
 <br/>
When I was a kid I gave books to the library whenever I could, thinking it  <br/>
was a good idea.  (I wouldn&#39;t do it for anything now, as they often go  <br/>
straight to book sales where they&#39;re sold for pennies) but one was a collection  of <br/>
poetry by Longfellow, and each colored illustration had a piece of (I don&#39;t  <br/>
know the term, but fake vellum--partly see-through protective)..paper bound next <br/>
 to it just to protect the illustration.  I was ten or so and someone had  <br/>
given it to me (my grandmother got it at a yard sale or something) and I thought <br/>
 the library could take better care of it than I could.  My mom didn&#39;t care  <br/>
much about books at all, and I was still at the stage of having a REALLY messy <br/>
 room I shared with my cousin.  They did put that one in the library,  <br/>
though, and I used to go and look at it sometimes.<br/>
 <br/>
One of the first displays I ever remember seeing was on a 1st grade field  <br/>
trip to the library in Fort Worth, where they had a display glass case with a  <br/>
Gutenburg Bible and a 19th century Mother Goose book.  Probably other  stuff, <br/>
but that&#39;s what I remember.  I also remember the city bus and that  we sat in <br/>
the front but there were adults sitting in the back.  They were  all Black.   <br/>
We left Texas just a month or two later and I never lived  there again.<br/>
 <br/>
I like books for the sake of the book-ness (bookitude? bookosity?).   It took <br/>
me a while to get why my kids don&#39;t care as much about books-as-books as  I <br/>
do. When I figured it out I wrote this:<br/>

at the page number before I close a book.  Even<br/>
without that, it&#39;s a simple thing to gleam context<br/>
