<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650555703">From time to time someone wants me to treat people on this list the  <br/>
way I treat my children.<br/>
What I want to do with this list is to help other adults discover and  <br/>
refine ways to treat their children more the way I treat my children,  <br/>
if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sign on my door, just put there last month, a paper taped  <br/>
there at eye level that says<br/>
<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
NO SOLICITORS<br/>
<br/>
No tree trimming,<br/>
no petitions<br/>
no missionaries<br/>
no encyclopedia sales<br/>
no yard cleaning.<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
Unlike some other people I know, I have listened to missionaries at  <br/>
length, invited them in, read their stuff, told them I admire their  <br/>
dedication, given them cold drinks or water.  I&#39;ve let Jehovah&#39;s  <br/>
Witnesses talk to me at length, and LDS guys.  Lately I decided I  <br/>
need to spend my time in other ways.  I&#39;m getting old.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s working nights.  Holly sleeps late.  Whenever anyone touches  <br/>
our door the dog barks a high, painful bark.  I don&#39;t want people to  <br/>
trim our trees or clean our yard and someone was coming to the door  <br/>
once a week or so. I don&#39;t want to sign petitions for anyone to run  <br/>
for office or for people to pressure the government to do something  <br/>
about something I never heard of.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean I&#39;m telling my children not to talk to me about  <br/>
religion or not to help me in the yard?<br/>
<br/>
I will let Holly sleep as late as she wants to and I&#39;ll make her  <br/>
anything she wants for breakfast, when she wants me to make her  <br/>
breakfast, which isn&#39;t all the time, just sometimes.  This morning I  <br/>
was glad to make fried eggs and toast for her.  She was sweet and  <br/>
grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean I should let just anyone sleep at my house as late as  <br/>
they want and then request a special breakfast?<br/>
<br/>
And on this discussion list, I&#39;m not trying to mother people.  I&#39;m  <br/>
trying to discuss ideas and factors and practices that make parenting  <br/>
antagonistic, when those come up, so that ALL the people on the list,  <br/>
not just the person who posted, can look at their own thoughts, and  <br/>
rules, and expectations and see if they can&#39;t tweak them toward the  <br/>
direction they want to be with their children.<br/>
<br/>
Several who have known me online (or in person) for the dozen or so  <br/>
years I&#39;ve been in discussions like this have asked how I can  <br/>
patiently answer the same questions year after year without  <br/>
throttling people.  It&#39;s because I know that when someone *does*  <br/>
change in understanding, the world gets better for their children.   <br/>
The world might be uncomfortable for the mom that day, but if she had  <br/>
wanted to stay the same, she never could have found this list.  If  <br/>
she found this list and read some and thought it was bogus, she never  <br/>
would have posted on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that people come to this list because they want to change.<br/>
<br/>
I am now, finally, getting tired of things like this (which came on  <br/>
the side, not to the list):<br/>
<br/>
-=- i don&#39;t think i can do better!!! i think YOU<br/>
can do better, if you could maybe be less confrontational and more in<br/>
tune with the ideas of understanding and empathy, that you speak of<br/>
regarding children.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The understanding and empathy I recommend parents show to their  <br/>
children is a parent and child thing, and I can&#39;t be expected to  <br/>
treat over 1000 people (however many are on this list) like they&#39;re  <br/>
on my children.<br/>
<br/>
BUT WAIT!  This list isn&#39;t a question and answer column where all the  <br/>
answers come from me.  Not at all.  When people post here they get  <br/>
several people&#39;s feedback.  And they get the feedback from people who  <br/>
are pretty likely to be giving unschooling-focussed answers.  That  <br/>
happens because I keep the list running, and keep spam and  <br/>
distractions off of it.<br/>
<br/>
Below is a link to an explanation of why I think people who want help  <br/>
should get help quickly and directly.  With my kids, they have 18  <br/>
years to learn to read, use a bank account and wipe their butts (not  <br/>
in that order).  With parents who have children, they do not have 18  <br/>
years to change.  They don&#39;t have ten years.  They don&#39;t have five.   <br/>
They need to change before more damage is done to their relationship,  <br/>
before it&#39;s so far gone they no longer want to regroup and re-direct.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/gettingit">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/gettingit</a><br/>
<br/>
And here are quotes from people who say they wish they had changed  <br/>
sooner:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifonly">http://sandradodd.com/ifonly</a><br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in helping those people.  I&#39;m less interested in  <br/>
helping people who want to be coddled, who complain about how I  <br/>
phrase things, and who want to take years to consider whether they&#39;ll  <br/>
change their ways.  The statement before is NOT about any individual,  <br/>
it&#39;s about hundreds of people who have come through and complained  <br/>
instead of coming through to look at what they&#39;re doing in the light  <br/>
of what others have discovered.<br/>
<br/>
If my website and articles and this list and UnschoolingDiscussion  <br/>
are not to someone&#39;s tastes, that&#39;s to be expected.  That&#39;s fine.  I  <br/>
really don&#39;t think I should change them because a few people wish  <br/>
they were different.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s courteous or reasonable for  <br/>
people to ask me to do my volunteer work just the way they imagine  <br/>
they would do it if they were me.<br/>
<br/>
I have said before &quot;If you can do it better, do it!&quot;  And I don&#39;t  <br/>
mean that in a mean way at all.  Anyone who sees flaws and can help  <br/>
others in a better way should really, honestly, truly, do it.  The  <br/>
more free help people have, the better.<br/>
<br/>
Is it because it&#39;s free that I get complaints?  Maybe.  If someone  <br/>
pays money to a counsellor they just either accept the help or they  <br/>
quit going, they don&#39;t harrass the person to change and do differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626852681">Ironically, it has often been those train-wreck threads and defensive <br/>
posters that have been the most instructive to me.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is the posters&#39; seemingly ridiculous inflexibility that <br/>
somehow highlights to me how crazy it is to be inflexible; perhaps it <br/>
is the &quot;oh, I can do better than that&quot; though pattern that goes <br/>
through my head.  Almost always they reinforce the fact that it is <br/>
very possible to do things a different way.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, though, it&#39;s not helpful if real facilitators of <br/>

It&#39;s always about the ideas, not the person.  I&#39;ve seen people get <br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always have THE answer, but I do always try to give a real  <br/>
answer.  Or sometimes I try to ask real questions, so that the person  <br/>
can find her own answers (in the teaching a man to fish way).<br/>
<br/>
If this list and other such sources can help others figure out how to  <br/>
find their own answers that&#39;s way better than giving simple &quot;just do  <br/>
this&quot; answers.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s why sometimes people get mad and accuse us of picking  <br/>
apart their words instead of just telling them what to do.  If they  <br/>
can just rearrange their thinking a little bit, better answers will  <br/>
start flooding in.  If we keep telling them what to do, they&#39;ll keep  <br/>
asking us what to do.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why principles work better than rules, in unschooling. It&#39;s  <br/>
the same reason learning from everything all the time is better than  <br/>
reliance on a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
Helping people find lots of different ways to see is better than  <br/>
telling them what to look at.<br/>
<br/>
Empowering people is good.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I saw &quot;No Reservations.&quot;  The main character is  <br/>
seeing a therapist, and clearly wasting her time and money there week  <br/>
after week by not being honest or open with him.  At one point he  <br/>
puts a dig to her that she can&#39;t help but think about, and she asks  <br/>
something like &quot;So is this a new technique, insulting the client?&quot;   <br/>
As he turns away, he says &quot;Only the best therapists use it,&quot; or some  <br/>
such (I didn&#39;t write it down at the time; should&#39;ve!)<br/>
<br/>
When he was being kind and nice, she was feeling soothed and  <br/>
justified in not actually sharing.  When he showed her something she  <br/>
was doing that repeatedly sabotaged her own happiness, it pissed her  <br/>
off, but she was able to change enough to have a happier life because  <br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a good plan to purposely irritate someone, and  <br/>
that&#39;s not what I do, but if someone is saying &quot;I keep grounding my  <br/>
kid and it&#39;s not helping,&quot; I won&#39;t hesitate to say &quot;You just said  <br/>
yourself it&#39;s not helping, so why do you keep doing it?&quot;  And if the  <br/>
person says &quot;You don&#39;t know enough about me to say something like  <br/>
that, every single other person who&#39;s reading it will know that  <br/>
either I know enough to say that (because given all the options in  <br/>
the world it&#39;s what the poster chose to write and post), or the  <br/>
poster wasn&#39;t careful or honest (which also happens sometimes).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065731146">ive dont think ive posted on this list but been a lurker for a long  <br/>
time. That in part justifies my slightly long post here...<br/>
<br/>
Sandra � ive found your insights and perspectives to be invaluable.  <br/>
Often challenging but that is why i am here � from about a year ago i  <br/>
had decided to make changes and was looking for ideas, techniques and  <br/>
principles to replace the old parenting me.<br/>
<br/>
You certainly seem patient. I would not invite missionaries into the  <br/>
house as I tend to be pretty picky as to where and with whom i invest  <br/>
my time and energy. You also seem to have amazing energy for all of  <br/>
us out here... it has been an effort for me even to write this email  <br/>
(i often laugh to myself that i could do a better parenting blog and  <br/>
write more on these lists if i did not have kids � lol!)<br/>
<br/>
  i totally get it if what you are saying is that you have limited  <br/>
time & energy and need to &quot;cut to the chase&quot; in your responses. I do  <br/>
truly appreciate you and others in your generosity in sharing so much  <br/>
of yourselves, your experience & wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
However if the aim of this list is to assist more people in making  <br/>
major shifts to a RU position,  in my humble opinion, that would be  <br/>
more effectively served by a more empathetic and compassionate  <br/>
unschooling community... both in the real and virtual world<br/>
<br/>
Parenting is of course a very personal thing. And the thing about  <br/>
personal stuff is that people take them personally. In a perfect  <br/>
world people would be able to just focus on ideas and not feel like  <br/>
they are being personally attacked when a radical idea lands in their  <br/>
inbox with their name on it. However we are not in a perfect world  <br/>
and parents on this list must bring their baggage, fears, guilt and  <br/>
other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Its not about being a counsellor. Nor do I expect you or anyone else  <br/>
to mother or coddle me (well ... i wouldnt mind my mum doing that!).  <br/>
But I honestly do believe that a little bit of compassion and empathy  <br/>
go a long way towards more effective communication. They have with my  <br/>
children and I am finding the same thing in other parts of my life  <br/>
also...<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that ultimately it is up to each individual to make  <br/>
change or not � they have to open the door. However I also think we  <br/>
as a community could help more people widen that door with a cultural  <br/>
shift. It does not cost anything and often is just a difference of a  <br/>
few words or way of phrasing things. The message can be just as  <br/>
sharp, pointed and challenging... yet with that greater compassion  <br/>
and empathy on occasion the same message will more often fall on open  <br/>
ears.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you are simply of the &quot;Sergeant Major School of Thought&quot;. You  <br/>
know... all those bad war movies with the full on Sergeant Major who  <br/>
yells at the new recruits to &quot;harden&quot; them for the war out there  <br/>
because hes only got a matter of weeks before they face battle. The  <br/>
new recruits hate it at the time, then in the midst of shelling they  <br/>
all say &quot;Thank God for the Sergeant Major&quot;. Of course you dont  <br/>
yell... but you get my point. I do believe there is space for &quot;tough  <br/>
love&quot; and words that cut to the core but that is just one aspect to  <br/>
communication...<br/>
<br/>
With my time on this list i have all to often seen some poor shmuck  <br/>
innocently share an issue or challenge they face only to get  <br/>
responses that, while i agree with the content, the form would scare  <br/>
away many, or worse get them defensive and get them posting more  <br/>
frustrating arguments and lead to very frustrating threads... in many  <br/>
ways that style creates &quot;more work&quot; for you and others who keep  <br/>
engaging in the argument that ensues.<br/>
<br/>
So again I say thank you. I am concerned if you truly are getting  <br/>
fatigued at what you do because it is of real value to many including  <br/>
myself. You are a very powerful force for parenting change... but i  <br/>
do believe that a &quot;Sandra with added compassion and empathy for other  <br/>
parents&quot; would be even more powerful!<br/>
<br/>
Im naming you because you initiated this post, but of course its not  <br/>
really about you as you also make the point often... Im really asking  <br/>
the question � what sort of culture do we want for the unschooling  <br/>
community? Its worth even the most experienced RU parent asking  <br/>
themselves this question before they post responses...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe im just a wimpy, over mothered, in need of coddling kind of  <br/>
guy... but i want a culure of honesty, challenging ideas, sharp  <br/>
debate (ive got all this)... but also one of compassion,  <br/>
understanding and empathy (this can be sorely lacking at times).  I  <br/>
really believe that it is that sort of culture that will welcome even  <br/>
more people to these ideas and practices...<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277129867">-=-Im really asking the question – what sort of culture do we want  <br/>
for the unschooling community?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of it as a community.<br/>
<br/>
Various people go on emotionally about feeling a part of a tribe, or  <br/>
a community.<br/>
<br/>
I see unschooling as something my family chose to do that other  <br/>
families have chosen to do.  I know how to help them do it.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
made some friends because of unschooling, but I have lots of friends  <br/>
who aren&#39;t unschoolers too.<br/>
<br/>
If I were a missionary or salesman and needed to try to get as many  <br/>
people as I could in as quickly as possible, that would be a way  <br/>
different deal than if I&#39;m staying in one place, building a website,  <br/>
discussing things with people who&#39;ve found this list on their own.   <br/>
It&#39;s not that easy a list to find, which is fine with me.  It was  <br/>
always intended to be an advanced unschooling list, only for people  <br/>
who had already read some John Holt and knew what they wanted to do.   <br/>
And it was always specifically intended as a list for people who  <br/>
didn&#39;t mind discussions with me.  It&#39;s my list, my own sole list,  <br/>
unlike UnschoolingDiscussion which is jointly owned, or other lists  <br/>
which also sprang from the UnschoolingDiscussion list, lists I&#39;m not  <br/>
even on.  Unschooling Basics.  There are others.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
I want to do what I do, voluntarily and freely.  It would be better  <br/>
for me and others if those who weren&#39;t comfortable with it found a  <br/>
more comfortable place instead of trying to persuade me to be like  <br/>
someone or something else.<br/>
<br/>
If I never helped anyone there wouldn&#39;t be anyone on the list, and if  <br/>
I didn&#39;t have anything to say, I&#39;d&#39;ve had nothing to put on the  <br/>
website.  I don&#39;t feel the need to help everyone in the whole wide  <br/>
world.  I don&#39;t go door to door and I don&#39;t advertise.   I stay where  <br/>
I am waiting for people to come and want to discuss the ideas in  <br/>
depth, and to untangle what seems tangled up in their thinking.<br/>
<br/>
When I started unschooling there were very few resources.  I was  <br/>
lucky because I knew two  unschooling families.  One family, years  <br/>
later, started a school and then all their kids were schoolkids  <br/>
(their dad was the minister of the church attached to the school, so  <br/>
they kinda needed to go there if the church was going to run a  <br/>
school).  It was a creative artsy school, because their mom&#39;s so much  <br/>
that way.  The other family, the kids didn&#39;t go to school, but the  <br/>
parents separated and the dad kept trying to force them to &quot;do work&quot;  <br/>
and the mom was having a hard time dealing with it all, and it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
ideal.  They&#39;re all grown now, but it wasn&#39;t the most glowing of  <br/>
unschooling stories, overall.  Neither of those families ever did the  <br/>
online discussion things.<br/>
<br/>
I waited two months for another issue of Growing Without Schooling,  <br/>
and then I waited again.  I read and re-read John Holt books.  But  <br/>
mostly I hung out with Kirby and watched him and talked to him and  <br/>
showed him the world and took note of his reactions and shared  <br/>
stories with other moms I knew well from La Leche League.  Marty came  <br/>
along; Holly came along.  We never changed or faltered or doubted  <br/>
unschooling.  Most families either started there and ended up  <br/>
changing course, or they started with school and moved to  <br/>
unschooling.  There are things I&#39;ve learned from watching families in  <br/>
person, from meeting families at conferences and keeping up with  <br/>
their lives sometimes in person, sometimes online, through visits in  <br/>
their home or mine,  or conferences.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it&#39;s not a community in a social sense for me.  I love knowing  <br/>
unschoolers, but I&#39;m not depending on them to provide all my social  <br/>
needs.<br/>

I really believe that it is that sort of culture that will welcome even<br/>
more people to these ideas and practices...<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
I can see folks feeling this way -- wanting more understanding and <br/>
empathy when they post.  If this were the only unschooling list on the <br/>
internet, that would be a very compelling argument.  There are lots of <br/>
lists, tho.  I belong to several, and I&#39;ve come to know which lists <br/>
will best answer the questions I have in a particular moment, or in the <br/>
particular way I feel I need to hear those answers.  <br/>
<br/>
When I sense that I&#39;ve let my issues get in my kids&#39; way and that I&#39;m <br/>
really the one who needs to grow a bit, I come here to read, or I post <br/>
over at unschooling basics -- because I know that Kelly & Ren won&#39;t let <br/>
me get away with anything!&lt;g&gt;  If I feel the same need for <br/>
accountability, but I&#39;m feeling a little vulnerable that day, I&#39;ll post <br/>
at Always Unschooled or maybe at Shine, where things tend to be a bit <br/>
gentler.<br/>
<br/>
On the issue of empathy, another point for me is who gets that empathy -<br/>
- the parent posting, or his/her kids who could use more empathy from <br/>
that parent?  It&#39;s not always possible to be empathetic towads both.  <br/>
When that&#39;s the case, the kids get my empathy every time.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of being like that drill seargent is an interesting <br/>
one.  I spent two years as a LaLeche League Leader.  It was my *job* to <br/>
support the Mom in her goal to breastfeed.  It wasn&#39;t my job to hold <br/>
her hand while she felt sorry for herself and found 15 reasons why she <br/>
felt she couldn&#39;t nurse.  It was my responsibility -- to her and to her <br/>
baby -- to remind her that she came to me because she wanted the very <br/>
best for her baby.  She may have forgotten in that moment -- in her <br/>
distress, what her goal was, but I was just removed enough to have the <br/>
clarity to remind her -- this is about your baby, not about you. It was <br/>
time-sensitive because if she didn&#39;t get it now, her supply would <br/>
dwindle and her baby would outgrow the nursing days.  If that happened, <br/>
they would fail at nursing.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is much the same way.  Our kids are only kids for a short <br/>
time -- something less than 20 yrs of childhood in a lifespan of maybe <br/>
80 yrs.  How those 60 yrs of adulthood turn out has a lot to do with <br/>
what I find a way to give to my kids in the first 20 or so.  I don&#39;t <br/>
have the luxury of figuring it over a long time, because every day, <br/>
week, month, year that I don&#39;t get it, it&#39;s my kids who don&#39;t get what <br/>
I want to give them.  I&#39;m 44yo and still wading thru the damage my <br/>
parents did to me.  I don&#39;t want that for my kids, so I&#39;m willing to <br/>
offer myself up to folks who won&#39;t let me get away with anything.  <br/>
<br/>
No one forces anyone to read at this -- or any other -- list.  Everyone <br/>
on the internet is here by choice. They found their way here and if <br/>
what they see/read here makes them so uncomfortable they can&#39;t get it, <br/>
then they can stop reading. <br/>
<br/>
As to whether or not this is a community, I&#39;m sure people will always <br/>
disagree on that point. I don&#39;t consider these online groups a tribe or <br/>
community. I know some people from these groups(IRL) and I consider <br/>
them friends, some who offer me great advice but with whom I have <br/>
little other than unschooling in common, some I&#39;d likely not choose for <br/>
friends, but who have shared invaluable insights over the years.  I may <br/>
sometimes bristle at the approach, but I always appreciate their <br/>
honesty. <br/>
<br/>
On the local, IRL level, I do belong to an unschooling group I consider <br/>
to be my tribe.  We enjoy a much deeper level of community and support <br/>
than I expect to find online.  We share more than unschooling, too, in <br/>
many ways.  As a group we&#39;ve been able to achieve a balance of empathy <br/>
and accountability.  They offer me great friendship and support, and <br/>
they know I expect them to call me on it when I&#39;m not being the Mom, <br/>
the person, I want to be.  We all know each other well enough, and see <br/>
each other often enough to be more adept at finding empathy for both <br/>
parties while remembering that our common goal is being true to our <br/>
principles as radical unschooling parents.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415981843">-=-Maybe im just a wimpy, over mothered, in need of coddling kind of<br/>
guy... but i want a culure of honesty, challenging ideas, sharp<br/>
debate (ive got all this)... but also one of compassion,<br/>
understanding and empathy (this can be sorely lacking at times). I<br/>
really believe that it is that sort of culture that will welcome even<br/>
more people to these ideas and practices...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does one list need to try to fulfill each member&#39;s desires?<br/>
COULD one list fulfill each member&#39;s desires?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a list is a culture.<br/>
This list is for discussion.  It&#39;s a small part of my big life.  I&#39;m  <br/>
assuming every other participant here has a really big life and this  <br/>
list is not what will make or break their unschooling or their  <br/>
happiness.  In any case in which someone has considered this a basket  <br/>
in which to put all her eggs, that&#39;s not something I designed or  <br/>
invited.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the odd behavior of people being super-involved and then  <br/>
over-reactionary.  I&#39;ve seen it with people and churches.  Mostly  <br/>
women and churches.   Someone will come and invest lots of time and  <br/>
energy and praise (some of God, but mostly of the minister or of her  <br/>
favorite members of the congregation)  and then they see a flaw, a  <br/>
sin, an imperfection.  And they get CRAZY about it, totally obsessed  <br/>
and indignant.  And they start badmouthing everyone and every thing  <br/>
associated with that church, and they practically go atheistic and  <br/>
they froth, until they find a new church to worship, and they cycle  <br/>
starts again.   Probably, usually, they become unhappy and then look  <br/>
for the flaw as a justifcation for their unsettled feelings.  They  <br/>
want something or someone to blame besides themselves for their  <br/>
restlessness or embarrassment or frustration or whatever emotion it  <br/>
is.  So they lash out and blame someone or something prominent and  <br/>
visible, someone whose name is on the wall or the program, preferably.<br/>
<br/>
I have never tried to be a church, I&#39;ve never wanted to be anything  <br/>
like a church, I&#39;ve just talked about ideas, my whole life.  And I&#39;ve  <br/>
written ideas down.  I&#39;ve tried them out and changed them, or I&#39;ve  <br/>
tried them out and become stronger in my confidence in one idea or  <br/>
another.    I&#39;m not perfect, but I&#39;m confident.  I don&#39;t know  <br/>
everything, but when I&#39;m not confident I admit it.  About things I  <br/>
don&#39;t know or care about, I don&#39;t say a word.   Those people who want  <br/>
me to be perfect somehow, or want this list (or any list, or group,  <br/>
or club, or church) to fulfill all their needs are showing a needy  <br/>
immaturity that isn&#39;t the fault of the list, group, club or church.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that there are ways to help our children grow up  <br/>
without having that neediness so many adults have maintained since  <br/>
childhood.  I was pretty sure years ago, and I&#39;ve made choices toward  <br/>
that direction for 21 years now and my children&#39;s demeanor and  <br/>
carriage and confidence have done nothing to make me think I was all  <br/>
wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698882590">-=-With my time on this list i have all to often seen some poor shmuck<br/>
innocently share an issue or challenge they face only to get<br/>
responses that, while i agree with the content, the form would scare<br/>
away many, or worse get them defensive and get them posting more<br/>
frustrating arguments and lead to very frustrating threads... in many<br/>
ways that style creates &quot;more work&quot; for you and others who keep<br/>
engaging in the argument that ensues.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When others&#39; ideas are clarified, it&#39;s not work.  It&#39;s joy.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;I never really understood this until that moment,&quot;  <br/>
then someone learned.  The person who learns the most isn&#39;t always  <br/>
the person who came with a question about how to get two kids to  <br/>
share a bottle of bubbles.  And the learning is rarely about bubbles,  <br/>
it&#39;s about the nature of growth and of what children need.<br/>
<br/>
A child might think she needs bubbles, when she needs something new  <br/>
and fascinating to look at.<br/>
<br/>
A mom might think she needs one, simple, narrow answer, when she  <br/>
needs to discover that she can find a way for all her imagined list  <br/>
of future questions to disappear like little bubbles.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did you know bubbles pop way faster in dry air than humid?  I  <br/>
should&#39;ve known that, it seems, and it makes sense, but if your kids  <br/>
like bubbles, and if you&#39;re in the desert, wait for one of those  <br/>
overcast days before it rains, or after it has rained, and check it  <br/>
out! The bubbles are strong and longer lasting, and prettier with  <br/>
clouds than with full sun bleaching them out and popping them the  <br/>
moment they form.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I am concerned if you truly are getting<br/>
fatigued at what you do because it is of real value to many including<br/>
myself.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not tired of people getting the spark of insight, or of gathering  <br/>
up free clues and taking them and making their home nest better.<br/>
How could I get tired of that!?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of criticism from people who can&#39;t do better, or haven&#39;t  <br/>
even tried.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  And I meant that.  I should have said, if I don&#39;t want your <br/>
answer (or the answers that&#39;ll show up on this list) I won&#39;t ask the <br/>
question. &lt;g&gt;  I like your answers because of what they are. <br/>
Thoughtful, empowering, real, and full of more questions to ask <br/>
myself.  I like my Mom&#39;s answers because they are blunt, tactless and <br/>
educational.  I have a friend who would give me a point by point <br/>
answer, and one who would never get around to an answer but it would <br/>
be a great conversation anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The way you and so many others here of tweaked my brain around to <br/>
better thinking is exciting for me.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, thank you for letting me clarify myself.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t always have THE answer, but I do always try to give a real  <br/>
&gt; answer.  Or sometimes I try to ask real questions, so that the <br/>
person  <br/>
&gt; can find her own answers (in the teaching a man to fish way).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this list and other such sources can help others figure out how <br/>
to  <br/>
&gt; find their own answers that&#39;s way better than giving simple &quot;just <br/>
do  <br/>
&gt; this&quot; answers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that&#39;s why sometimes people get mad and accuse us of <br/>
picking  <br/>
&gt; apart their words instead of just telling them what to do.  If <br/>
they  <br/>
&gt; can just rearrange their thinking a little bit, better answers <br/>
will  <br/>
&gt; start flooding in.  If we keep telling them what to do, they&#39;ll <br/>
keep  <br/>
&gt; asking us what to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s why principles work better than rules, in unschooling. It&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; the same reason learning from everything all the time is better <br/>
than  <br/>
&gt; reliance on a curriculum.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Helping people find lots of different ways to see is better than  <br/>
&gt; telling them what to look at.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Empowering people is good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday Holly and I saw &quot;No Reservations.&quot;  The main character <br/>
is  <br/>
&gt; seeing a therapist, and clearly wasting her time and money there <br/>
week  <br/>
&gt; after week by not being honest or open with him.  At one point he  <br/>
&gt; puts a dig to her that she can&#39;t help but think about, and she <br/>
asks  <br/>
&gt; something like &quot;So is this a new technique, insulting the <br/>
client?&quot;   <br/>
&gt; As he turns away, he says &quot;Only the best therapists use it,&quot; or <br/>
some  <br/>
&gt; such (I didn&#39;t write it down at the time; should&#39;ve!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When he was being kind and nice, she was feeling soothed and  <br/>
&gt; justified in not actually sharing.  When he showed her something <br/>
she  <br/>
&gt; was doing that repeatedly sabotaged her own happiness, it pissed <br/>
her  <br/>
&gt; off, but she was able to change enough to have a happier life <br/>
because  <br/>
&gt; of it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a good plan to purposely irritate someone, and  <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not what I do, but if someone is saying &quot;I keep grounding <br/>
my  <br/>
&gt; kid and it&#39;s not helping,&quot; I won&#39;t hesitate to say &quot;You just said  <br/>
&gt; yourself it&#39;s not helping, so why do you keep doing it?&quot;  And if <br/>
the  <br/>
&gt; person says &quot;You don&#39;t know enough about me to say something like  <br/>
&gt; that, every single other person who&#39;s reading it will know that  <br/>
&gt; either I know enough to say that (because given all the options in  <br/>
&gt; the world it&#39;s what the poster chose to write and post), or the  <br/>
&gt; poster wasn&#39;t careful or honest (which also happens sometimes).<br/>

list, there are lots of people and you don&#39;t have to take one person&#39;s <br/>
posts to heart - you can read other people&#39;s posts too - one&#39;s that fit <br/>
your style better. If the over all tone of a list is not to someone&#39;s <br/>
liking - go find one that suits better!<br/>
<br/>
Personally I have been put off lists where the tone has been all <br/>
sweetness and comfort and that&#39;s fine, you&#39;re lovely blah blah. That <br/>
drives me nuts till I leave. I love the precise sharpness of Sandra&#39;s <br/>
responses: it&#39;s precisely because of her tone that she can cut through <br/>
the defenses in my head and make me reassess and reevaluate my ideas. <br/>
The gentle sweetie nature of some other people&#39;s posts just lulls me <br/>
into complacency. When I feel a stab of indignation while reading one of <br/>
Sandra&#39;s comments, I know it&#39;s time to take a deep breath and look <br/>
inside myself, not criticize her!<br/>
