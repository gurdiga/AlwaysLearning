<div id="ygrps-yiv-758926408"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Evolution is a powerful force.  More powerful than<br/>
&gt;God, unaffected by prayer, promises you<br/>
&gt;nothing in return for your belief except maybe the<br/>
&gt;idea you have as good a chance at life as the common<br/>
&gt;ground beetle does.  Or that cat on your<br/>
&gt;lap.  It&#39;s humbling when you stop thinking of<br/>
&gt;yourself as Godlike. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe this too, and obviously I am a very<br/>
spiritual person.  Evolution is a natural force and as<br/>
much a part of my faith and spirituality as the<br/>
evolution of the soul or the evolution of the human<br/>
being from birth to death both physically and<br/>
emotionally/intellectually.  All natural forces are a<br/>
part of the great web that includes all life and my<br/>
higher power.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What do you think?  My sister in law believes in a<br/>
&gt;higher power, a universal force <br/>
<br/>
&gt;(Luke, Luke...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for good or evil as we choose to use it.<br/>
&gt;Deb L<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe this too, and my universal force is that<br/>
universal higher power, which is both male and female<br/>
and not sexed or human at all.  I can be very specific<br/>
in ritual and worship in directing my energies in<br/>
thoughform towards a specific embodiment of energies<br/>
and ideas that is a particular &quot;persona&quot; of my higher<br/>
power, but they are all essentially different facets<br/>
of the same spectrum, different faces in the mirror. <br/>
It matters not what you call your Higher Power, even<br/>
if your Higher Power is the strength within yourself<br/>
that allows you to defend your principles and beliefs<br/>
and feel your connection to all living things.<br/>
