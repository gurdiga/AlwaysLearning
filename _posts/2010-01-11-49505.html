<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reality is so...real. And it was so nice to see real kids talking about their real reality. Yesterday afternoon&#39;s discussion was pretty neat, and anyone present could not argue with the fact that these amazing, inspiring, beautiful, and real unschooled kids are indeed living their reality day to day. Really and for reals. It was really cool to hear the Sorooshians talk about their lives, and to hear the Dodds talk about their lives and Ms. Fetteroll talk about her life, and to know that kids that have lives without school become real people who do real things every day.  For some reason I find it incomprehensible that there are folks out there that want to argue that concept.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I&#39;d had a bit more time to really get into meaningful discussions with your kids, Pam&#39;s kids, Joyce&#39;s kid, plus all their parents, and everyone else. Time constraints and being a commuter rather than staying on-site contributed to that. But I&#39;m thankful for the exchanges I was able to attend.<br/>
<br/>
I was beyond intrigued by the Sorooshian girls&#39; standards of unschooling families, and I&#39;m certain that we don&#39;t measure up at the moment. The parenting path I&#39;ve taken has had so many  twists, turns, hills, and detours. I started out open-minded, patient, and loving, but clouded with the baggage of my own conventional childhood upbringing. I do know, however, where we strive to be. I&#39;m certain that due to hard work, diligence, patience, love, and the ability to maintain an open mind my family will one day achieve the standard these girls speak of. For my girls&#39; sake I work towards that.  <br/>
<br/>
For us, the Unschooling part comes easy.  I have no qualms about cleaning up messes, tv, video games, play all day, etc. That&#39;s easy. For us, the challenges are mostly that Mom is the boat-floater, and therefore out of the home for about 28 hours per week. Thankfully we have both sets of grandparents close by, and they are all supportive. Even though the grandparents have different methods for dealing with day-to-day life, I&#39;m certain their input is valuable. This adventure is just that, and having just met all these remarkable kids, teens,  young adults, and their parents at the conference I am newly rejuvenated and inspired.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for putting this on, Sandra, and thanks to all the presenters.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Rosie and Cyrus and I are in Flagstaff - on our way back to So <br/>
California. At the symposium, Sandra said that Rosie had been at a <br/>
conference and had said that Sandra and I were the only real unschooling <br/>
parents there. Something like that.  Rosie says she&#39;s a little <br/>
embarrassed that she&#39;d said that, but that I should mention that it was <br/>
hyperbole and she was making a point. (Which I&#39;ll get to below.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been to a zillion conferences, but I know which one that was --- <br/>
it was one where a lot of local people who were not actually practicing <br/>
unschoolers had come and we also had, for some reason, a lot of contact <br/>
with those particular parents (who had young children, by the way). <br/>
There was quite a bit of telling children what to eat and what to do and <br/>
when to sleep and there was open talk, among the parents, about how they <br/>
would never allow their children to watch television or eat sugar, etc. <br/>
One of the parents sat at dinner and argued with us quite vociferously <br/>
about the need for regular bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - as we were driving home, she said she wanted to clarify that <br/>
she didn&#39;t mean that she was going around judging whether someone is or <br/>
isn&#39;t a good unschooling parent or not, but that HER idea of what <br/>
unschooling is was not what these other parents seemed to think it is.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the point - these kids don&#39;t have the baggage that interferes <br/>
with clarity of vision in seeing all, and I mean ALL, the logical ways <br/>
that unschooling principles apply. To them, it seems just completely <br/>
inexplicable that someone would understand that forcing reading is a bad <br/>
idea and not understand that trying to enforce arbitrary bedtimes or <br/>
controlling what a child eats are, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was Rosie and she meant that people seem to have hang-ups that <br/>
prevent them from seeing how unschooling principles apply to certain <br/>
things.  They go so far, but they can&#39;t let go of being controlling <br/>
about certain things. Also, she noticed that lots of parents revert to <br/>
more conventional parenting when under some kind of stress.<br/>
<br/>
Very true - it is what a lot of this list is about, right?<br/>
<br/>
The thing that is interesting, though, is that these next generation <br/>
kids (unschooled and now old enough to be thinking about parenting kids <br/>
of their own), just have so much more clarity in what makes unschooling <br/>
sense. They see through a much more clear lens.<br/>
<br/>
It is like me and how I think of spanking. I grew up with no spanking, <br/>
ever. I witness it a few times and heard friend&#39;s parents threatening <br/>
it, and the idea of it just kind of sickened me and I avoided those <br/>
households where it was a constant threat. They scared me.<br/>
<br/>
I have never one single time had an urge to strike a child - it isn&#39;t in <br/>
my repertoire. My own kids are horrified and there is no way they could <br/>
spank their children.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling will be a bit like that - there are things that just <br/>
don&#39;t enter into their mind as to how children should be treated. They <br/>
won&#39;t belittle them, they won&#39;t shame them, they will be generous and <br/>
supportive, and it won&#39;t be hard for them to be that way, it will just <br/>
make sense, it will be how they &quot;are&quot; insteaed of how they are trying to <br/>
behave.<br/>

That&#39;s powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Some people start out acting like unschoolers (and &quot;fake it til you  <br/>
make it&quot; can work in some ways), but they don&#39;t really feel it.  They  <br/>
aren&#39;t making direct unschooling choices yet.<br/>
<br/>
Many other newish unschoolers won&#39;t spot it, but Rosie and Holly do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our interactions with the &quot;real&quot; world have been REALLY good as my kids <br/>
reach the teen years. My son, who is 16, and my oldest, has had some <br/>
amazing experiences going out there and interacting with people and <br/>
being really well recieved. There have been some challenges, too, which <br/>
has led to lots of really interesting discussion. Understanding why <br/>
people act in ways that can be so unpleasant has been hard. Getting out <br/>
there and seeing that he is competent and even exceptionally talented in <br/>
some things, has been a huge part of it, though, and in general he has a <br/>
positive and excited outlook on the future, and mostly positive <br/>
experiences with people.<br/>
<br/>
I had discussion with some other homeschooling moms the other day- who <br/>
are either unschooling or seriously trying it on. My statement was that <br/>
uschooled teens often APPEAR to be exceptional to people in the &quot;real&quot; <br/>
world. My proof of that is my own children, and the kids I meet, and <br/>
stories I hear. Another mom said she gave up on the idea that her kids <br/>
would BE exceptional just because they were unschooled. I understand her <br/>
point that we should not expect them to excel in real world ways, <br/>
neccesarily, though they might. And that there is no way to be <br/>
exceptional in any absolute way, it really is about how others perceive <br/>
you. And I am perfectly willing to admit that I see my kids and other <br/>
unschooled kids as talented and amazing partly because of how I am <br/>
looking at them, and partly because they just ARE. And when kids feel <br/>
you percieving them from this point of view- they usually respond well. <br/>
I see this in the difference between how my kids respond to me, and his <br/>
dad. His dad is learning, but still at times can be very judgemental, <br/>
and he gets a very bad reponse from the kids when looking at them that way.<br/>
<br/>
The ways in which kids can be exceptional and amazing can be infinite. <br/>
Exceptional in their skill or talent at what they love to do, <br/>
exceptional in their ability to understand themselves, to relate to <br/>
others, to just enjoy their lives, exceptionally  lovely to be around.<br/>
<br/>
My son was trying out a new soccer team - he was one of the less skilled <br/>
players. Many of parents of the kids on that team were very convinced <br/>
that their kids are exceptional. It seemed like a pretty good thing for <br/>
many of the kids- though some of the parents did seem pretty pushy, and <br/>
very negative when their kids made mistakes. Though not all - some of <br/>
them were very loving and obviously willing to go to great lengths to <br/>
support their kids in athletics, at least.  And the way that these <br/>
parents see their kids has gone a really long way to allowing them to <br/>
see them selves as capable, and their lives as full of possibility. Kids <br/>
like the kids on the soccer team, who are encouraged in their athletic <br/>
and academic ability, are given that positive view of themselves as <br/>
default, because it is what the larger society values, and parental <br/>
support helps even more. Unschooling parents can give their kids that <br/>
positive view of themselves no matter what their strengths and interests <br/>
are. That makes a huge difference to a kid. For an unschooling kid, who <br/>
hasn&#39;t gone out into the real world as much, it is even bigger, because <br/>
their parents are such a large part of their world. If a kid whose <br/>
parents are supportive is in a school environment, and their strengths <br/>
are not those typically valued in that environment, the parents support <br/>
does help, but there is still a lot of negative that kid is getting <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have time to get really good at something, in a relaxed way, <br/>
when they want to. Often kids who are excelling in school, athletics, or <br/>
classical music, for example, have really incredibly packed schedules. <br/>
These kids can get really good at things, too, but I doubt they have the <br/>
time to proceed as thoughtfully as an unschooled kid.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts- but something about unschooling CAN be so powerful - <br/>
and it has such excellent &quot;results&quot;, that can be perceived by just about <br/>
anyone. It depends on how it is done. I certainly know families who are <br/>
unschooling in some way, but are very negative towards their kids, <br/>
dispointed and adversarial. That doesn&#39;t have such good results.<br/>
<br/>
But in the end, I do it for the every day result of a good relationship. <br/>
It is really nice that it also can work in so well in a real world <br/>
context. And important, for more people wanting to try it and more happy <br/>
kids.<br/>

<br/>
Even the youngest school kids I see are losing it. It&#39;s what my daughter was losing--in Kindergarten, and it&#39;s what made me wake up and say, &quot;NO WAY!&quot; I won&#39;t let her light be extinguished. Maybe it&#39;s even more prevalently gone in the littlest kids because they are the ones so hugely impacted (the sensitive ones, anyway) by all the things the school does that can squash out that light.  From being taken away from Mother, to having to meet strangers who ask them questions, to not knowing whether they can ask to go to the bathroom--or not even knowing where the bathroom is, to having to put up with really talkative kids asking questions, to having to eat at set times...all these things impacted my 6-year old in profound ways that worked towards pushing her away from her own true identity. I&#39;m thankful for all the steps that brought us to this place.</div>

 <br/>
Chamille is generally well received when she out and about interacting in real ways in the real world, shocking looks and all!  The folks she&#39;s had the MOST trouble with are the parents of teens who are NOT unschooling.  Everythings she&#39;s about suggests to other teens that what their parent&#39;s say isn&#39;t always truthful and that rules are often lame and meant to be broken.  It&#39;s not something that she&#39;s out to do or present, but her very existence makes it so.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s helped enormously to understand WHY parents do that to their kids.  Even so Chamille understands the why, she still finds it very inexcusable, the ways in which parents treat their teens, her friends that she cares for deeply.<br/>
 <br/>
This morning, she was talking about the differences between unschooled teens and schooled teens.  She said that while there are plenty of human traits exhibited by all, the unschooled teens aren&#39;t cruel to other kids.  She&#39;s decided that that&#39;s the biggest difference.  If unschooled teens don&#39;t mesh with another unschooled teen, they don&#39;t dismiss that person, don&#39;t trash that person, but are much more likely to just simply not hang out with them.  There isn&#39;t badmouthing or trash talking or outright cruelty, and even general acceptance of that person as just someone who doesn&#39;t have the same interests.  But that is NOT the case for schooled teens at all, there is rampant cruelty of those that are different, or who, in any way are viewed as unacceptable by any other.<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s spent 2 lunches at a local high school to hang out with some of her friends, who she says don&#39;t exhibit the kinds of traits most schooled kids do, they just keep to themselves, a small circle of friends.  She&#39;s watching and observing how teens behave in this larger schooled context and her insight is fascinating.<br/>
