read, but he didn&#39;t know what turpentine was, so reading the name on the can <br/>
didn&#39;t help. WHY would a kid DRINK it? I have no idea. He was in a coma for a <br/>
day -- but came out of it and suffered no long-term effects.<br/>
<br/>
He and his mom were standing at the counter at a hardware store and Nick <br/>
opened the can and took some big guzzles before anybody noticed. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a smart kid, too. It seems like a very odd thing for him to have done.<br/>
