<div id="ygrps-yiv-708078683">Just remembered so figured I&#39;d go ahead and post (hope no one minds).  Ds,<br/>
14, really liked this article.  He&#39;s recently said he might like to be a<br/>
doctor as well as do something in gaming for future employment.  The doctor<br/>
part is new.  I think this article has had that big of an impression.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about a women who loves to play, how she came to love the game and why<br/>
she still does...  <br/>
She has many physical difficulties and manages to play on..<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
