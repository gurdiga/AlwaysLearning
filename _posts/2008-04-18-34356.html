<div id="ygrps-yiv-940315260">I always wanted to be the cool mom when thinking about my <br/>
relationship with my kids but I never really thought about <br/>
relationships with their friends.  Claire is having some problems <br/>
with her boyfriend of 6 months and they both asked me to sit and <br/>
talk with them about it.  I felt honored that they would trust me so <br/>
much to let me in like that.  I hope I helped.  I tried to stay <br/>
objective and tried to just repeat what they said.  In other words, <br/>
I was helping them communicate, a skill I didn&#39;t learn until my <br/>
30s.  <br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, I was taking Sebastian (her boyfriend) home.  Claire <br/>
stayed home because her head was hurting and she wanted to go to <br/>
bed.  That gave Sebastian and I a chance to talk alone.  He told me <br/>
it felt both weird and good to be able to talk to me and trust me.  <br/>
He said he was going to be sad if he and Claire broke up because <br/>
he&#39;d miss our family.  As I was driving home, I thought back on <br/>
talks he and I had.  He tells me about his difficulties with his <br/>
parents, their expectations, his progress in school, his hopes and <br/>
dreams for when he gets out of school.  It never occurred to me <br/>
until tonight that I might be the only adult in his life who listens <br/>
to him and doesn&#39;t have a preset of expectations for him.  And then <br/>
I thought about some of her other friends who have trusted me enough <br/>
to talk with me.  It just made me really thankful for the awesome, <br/>
trusting relationship I have with my kids.  I wish the parents of <br/>
these other kids could have that same type of relationship with <br/>
their children.<br/>
