<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658796111">Holly, who only learned to read in the past year, reads over my shoulder a <br/>
lot.  I was going to send an e-mail to friends who had brought her a belated <br/>
birthday gift, on November 6, and she said &quot;Wait, mom.&quot;  She just leaned past <br/>
me, and editted my e-mail. I&#39;ve meant to share it here ever since.   Here it <br/>
is:<br/>
<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
She just got it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, when she got it I was on the phone with AppleCare (Canadian <br/>
contractors--all with cute Canadian accents) getting my computer to go.  It <br/>
woke up with a big question mark on its face this morning.  That always <br/>
scares the HECK out of me, that I&#39;ll lose everything I have.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for thinking of her, and as usual you got PERFECT things.  <br/>
You have a knack for knowing what Holly likes!!<br/>
<br/>

(Holly changed &quot;to&quot; to &quot;with&quot; on &quot;I was on the phone to AppleCare...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that same day she said:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It makes me feel so good inside because so many schoolkids mumble when they <br/>
read but I don&#39;t have to.   10/6/02</div>
