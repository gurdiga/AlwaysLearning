I found a link to something translated into what I think is Chinese.   <br/>
I&#39;m quoted and my site is linked.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I get between a thousand and two thousand hits a day on my  <br/>
site (SandraDodd.com) and one day last week I got 90,000, because a  <br/>
letter from David Bowie I&#39;ve had there for years got linked out.    I  <br/>
used to always bring the site announcements here to this list.  Then  <br/>
for a while they were too frequent, and now it&#39;s been a month so I&#39;m  <br/>
reminding people that site announcements can be subscribed to by e- <br/>
mail or the blog can be saved somehow, because I won&#39;t always bring  <br/>
them here.  It could crowd the list up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been kinda slow here this week, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953142335">One of my adoptive children, an (approximately) 18 year old<br/>
young man who we adopted from China four years ago, confirms<br/>
that this is,indeed, Mandarin Chinese.  He doesn&#39;t read very<br/>
well, in Chinese or English--he does other things well:  he&#39;s<br/>
got a beautiful singing voice and he&#39;s a talented artist and <br/>
an amazing cook, and he&#39;s very generous with his time and energies--<br/>
anyway, the parts he *was* able to read, he was able to let me<br/>
know that the English quotations below the Chinese translations...<br/>
or should that be the other way &#39;round?... are spot-on.  Just <br/>
to be very clear:  he couldn&#39;t read all the Chinese, but everything<br/>
he could read to me and translate into English corresponded directly<br/>
with the English.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that a Chinese speaker would groove on<br/>
unschooly ideas; that culture, what I know of it, anyway, has<br/>
a lot of competition in the schools, a lot of memorization, a <br/>
lot of surpress yourself and impress your teacher...<br/>
<br/>
...I think all of that at least partially explains why this<br/>
particular son chooses to go to school.  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps a little,<br/>
