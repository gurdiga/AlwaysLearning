<div id="ygrps-yiv-739973741">I&#39;m up WAY too early this 4th of July!  But all my family members are <br/>
otherwise engaged for tonight, and so it&#39;s a very different 4th.<br/>
<br/>
Figuring I&#39;d seen enough fireworks for a lifetime (including 2nd row seats at <br/>
a competition between American manufacturors years ago when I had no children <br/>
and hallucinogenic drugs didn&#39;t seem so illegal), I agreed one by one to <br/>
release my husband, middle son, oldest son and daughter to their various and <br/>
sundry other 4th of July activities.  Keith will be in Wyoming at an SCA <br/>
event with a male friend.  Marty will be three hours south at Elephant Butte <br/>
Lake with his friend Logan&#39;s extended family.  Kirby is going with Carol <br/>
Rice&#39;s family (famous here from the really-late reading article at <br/>
www.unschooling.com) to watch the fireworks at Kirtland Air Force Base, and <br/>
Holly had a choice of two plans and is going to go with Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I&#39;ll stay here and comfort the dog and make a webpage for my friend <br/>
Ramona King whose husband and three kids are away in North Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is a big Anglophile.  She doesn&#39;t know or care much about castles and <br/>
kings, which is the draw for many such folk.  She&#39;s interested in language <br/>
and modern cultural differences.  She asked me what they do in England on the <br/>
4th of July.  Well, I said, probably nothing much but feel bad that we kicked <br/>
their butts.  <br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is that the thought of that will not leave her until she&#39;s too <br/>
old to remember (or otherwise can&#39;t remember), because I said they can do the <br/>
little happy dance about whupin&#39; Spain in the 1600s still, but it was down <br/>
hill for them militarily for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
All she knows about colonization and the American Revolution (which at her <br/>
age and with her interests isn&#39;t much) she will tie to how England feels <br/>
about us now, and how all that came to evolve.<br/>
<br/>
What she knows about Russia and the USSR and eastern Europe is WAY different <br/>
from the small propagandistic nonsense I knew at her age, and it&#39;s for <br/>
entirely different reasons and from different angles.<br/>
<br/>
I love watching them learn, and thinking back and wishing I could have <br/>
learned that way.  Sometimes I did, but not with the same outside approval <br/>
and in the absense of the school outline and brittle summary.<br/>
<br/>
So the 4th of July is not hot-dog day for my kids.  It&#39;s exploration day.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not so exciting for them because so is every other day!!  <br/>
<br/>
And I get to make a website, using the scanner I hooked up myself, and the <br/>
knowledge I&#39;ve (somewhat painstakingly) gathered over the past couple of <br/>
years about html (more the past month than all the time before that, but I <br/>
did have my toe in the water a long time on that before I decided it wasn&#39;t <br/>
beyond me), and hang out with Ramona for the first time ever without two to <br/>
six children in and around the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a GREAT day!!<br/>
<br/>

We don&#39;t celebrate it and it was always interesting when the US bases in<br/>
the UK had celebrations -- they were forced to be very low key.<br/>

Now what will really piss off the older generation is when you discuss how<br/>
the US pushed their way in during WWII -- that really gets tempers flying:)<br/>

<br/>
One momentary mental happy dance that King George wasn&#39;t more organized or <br/>
better at divergent thought isn&#39;t dissing England for all time.  Nor is it a <br/>
reflection on the current population of the United Kingdom, any more than I <br/>
can personally take credit for the founding of the United States.  It&#39;s a <br/>
holiday, that&#39;s all.  People remember or &quot;celebrate&quot; what they want, and I&#39;m <br/>
sure MOST celebration is lacking in lofty purpose or political correctness.  <br/>
A day off and a case of Bud is sufficient for a lot of guys.<br/>

purpose of creating Americans (one culture, one mindset, one big crowd of<br/>
right-voting and -buying ignoramuses), not for the purpose of learning<br/>
history.  Those Virginians are only repeating what they&#39;ve been taught (and<br/>
of course, the teacher wouldn&#39;t have *lied*...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613169566">&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t mind admitting that the Americans were a big help during WW2 but<br/>
they only arrived for the last 18 months or so. Right. I&#39;ll get off my<br/>
soapbox. I&#39;ve been harassed by people here in Virginia for being English so<br/>
I&#39;m feeling a tad ticked off. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear that people are giving you a hard time there, Shyrley.<br/>
:(<br/>

My dad fought in WW2, landed on the beaches in Normandy, actually. And he<br/>
always had nothing but admiration for the British. He said they were the<br/>
toughest people he had seen in a long time...strong and determined in spite<br/>
of the bombings and raids that were happening in their country at the time.<br/>
He wasn&#39;t someone to compliment easily - and certainly didn&#39;t have the same<br/>
to say about the French. But the British - held in the highest esteem.<br/>
<br/>
I agree - those James Loewen books are great at helping to set some of the<br/>
historic records straight. Remember, I live in TEXAS - the state that James<br/>
said had the MOST inaccurate historical markers in the whole country! I<br/>
believe it!!! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
We had a great 4th of July in spite of the rains. We did our own fireworks<br/>
in our own driveway out in the country. Very simple. The kids were thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Belated 4th , Everyone! Including you, Shyrley the RDI (Recently<br/>
Declared Independent!) &lt;g&gt;<br/>

How are you holding up in the heat?  It&#39;s supposed to be 105 <br/>
here tomorrow. YUCK!!  At least it&#39;s a dry heat (only 10-11% <br/>
humidity).  I wish I had a swimming pool.<br/>
We had a great 4th!  We went to a friend&#39;s house and swam and <br/>

to 112F. Yesterday is was only 101F but so humid you could <br/>
almost have a shower out there :-(<br/>
I hate the summers here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962760533">Driving home today I noticed a big sign with the temperature displayed on <br/>
it.......100 degrees at 6:30 PM!!  and 100 percent humidity doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
rain.  ):0  <br/>
<br/>
  We have discovered eating a watermelon that has spent several hours in the <br/>
freezer is a great way to beat the heat.  Snow cones and popsicles are great <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
  I teach an exercise class (Jazzercise) several times a week and I take <br/>
frozen wash clothes in my cooler with me.  The participants are very <br/>
grateful.  I put a few drops of lavender essential oil in the rinse cycle <br/>
before I put them in the freezer and that is a a real treat.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So true.  100% humidity is pretty common here, along the banks of the <br/>
Mississippi River.  Bleagh.  Stepping outside feels like having a wet wool <br/>
sweater put on.  :P  Sometimes the air is so saturated here, that the <br/>
humidity just &quot;falls&quot; out of the sky on a cloudless day.  It&#39;s water, but is <br/>
definitely NOT a refreshing rain!  I don&#39;t understand how it works, but <br/>
unfortunately it does.  It&#39;s usually accompanied by a strong smell of ozone.<br/>
