<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917607042">Greetings-<br/>
<br/>
Our family has just taken a short walk through hell--my husband has been laid <br/>
off from his job, and new job prospects are dim.  Think major airline here. I <br/>
suffered a major depressive episode, and am now much better--but it has been <br/>
a dreadful 5 months.  <br/>
 I&#39;ve been the homeschooling parent for over ten years now, and am forced <br/>
back into the workforce due to our financial situation.  Well, it turns out the <br/>
20+ years of devoted volunteer work, a smattering of college and part-time jobs <br/>
doesn&#39;t count for much in terms of wages, so I&#39;m returning to school with the <br/>
intention of studying nursing.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that is making me crazy is having to figure out how to <br/>
home/unschool our 16yr son.  He would be happy to spend all day, every day, on the <br/>
computer, much of it playing fps games.  I know that all this activity isn&#39;t <br/>
wasted--he&#39;s a wiz at these games, he knows the computer inside and out (well, pretty <br/>
much--he&#39;s screwed up a few things in the process of learning).  We live in a <br/>
rural area, and he doesn&#39;t drive yet; finances are so stressed that we can&#39;t <br/>
afford his car insurance when he does drive.  So, there is the isolation <br/>
factor.  Then, I&#39;m finding myself fretting about his writing and mathematical <br/>
abilities.  He reads well, but writes as little as possible, and I suspect some <br/>
learning disabilities in math.<br/>
<br/>
Timing is everything--this was supposed to be the time when he&#39;d really start <br/>
to blossom, as he had been the past year or so.  Now our life feels like it <br/>
has collapsed and I&#39;m trying to figure out the best way to parent him when both <br/>
of his parents will be gone much of the time.  I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not younger, and <br/>
I do know that there are valuable lessons he&#39;ll be learning through this <br/>
whole mess, but I feel an urgent need to better prepare him for adulthood and I&#39;m <br/>
not going to be around as much to do so.<br/>
<br/>
He is the youngest of our three children, the others married or in college. <br/>
I&#39;m not done with him yet and our life just got way more complicated!  On top <br/>
of it all, I&#39;m really trying to overcome the feeling of &quot;being so old&quot; and <br/>
returning to school--although we feel it is the best thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you look at the overall wage-earning situation, maybe being in  <br/>
nursing school isn&#39;t the best way for you AND your son to be making  <br/>
enough money five or ten years from now.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s sixteen.  Can you wait two years to go to work?  Could you and  <br/>
he both get jobs somewhere?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve been the homeschooling parent for over ten years now, and am  <br/>
forced<br/>
back into the workforce due to our financial situation. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please try not to see your situation in terms of &quot;being forced.&quot;<br/>
Your husband didn&#39;t die and you&#39;re not starving, right?<br/>
You&#39;re working on making choices, you&#39;re not being forced at gunpoint  <br/>
to do something, or they wouldn&#39;t have let you come and write to us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-We live in a<br/>
rural area, and he doesn&#39;t drive yet; -=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not studying nursing in a rural area, are you?  Can he go to  <br/>
town with you when you go to class?   Can he take some classes?   <br/>
Maybe not academic classes, maybe music or photography or computers,  <br/>
without intent to enroll in a degree program.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Timing is everything--this was supposed to be the time when he&#39;d  <br/>
really start<br/>
to blossom, as he had been the past year or so.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Timing is a BIG part of life, and when you finish  nursing school you  <br/>
will no longer have a &quot;school-aged&quot; child.  The age of compulsory  <br/>
schooling will have passed you by.  You won&#39;t be able to go back and  <br/>
have a sixteen year old, or a seventeen year old.<br/>
<br/>
Can you rent out your bigger rural house and live in an apartment for  <br/>
a bit here so he&#39;s not isolated?  Maybe he can get around town on  <br/>
foot, or by bus, or bicycle.<br/>
<br/>
The cost of living rurally is about to become very expensive for you  <br/>
too, if you can&#39;t be there to drive him out into the larger world.<br/>
<br/>
Would he want to go to high school next year?  They couldn&#39;t give him  <br/>
a diploma, but he could spend a year in the company of other kids,  <br/>
practicing some math and writing, without the pressures they will  <br/>
have to make good grades and finish their diplomas.  And the bus  <br/>
would pick him up for free, right?<br/>
<br/>
-=-On top<br/>
of it all, I&#39;m really trying to overcome the feeling of &quot;being so  <br/>
old&quot; and<br/>

<br/>
Does your son feel it is the best thing for you to do?<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
Can he go stay with one of his siblings every so often?  Maybe it  would be <br/>
possible for him to stay with the married sib one week and the college  sib the <br/>
next and then at home the next?  I assume his sibs live in town  somewhere, <br/>
where your son could get some interaction with other teens or hook up  with <br/>
some kind of group or event or activity that piques his interest.<br/>
 <br/>
I am not in financial distress, but I do find myself looking toward  <br/>
career/vocation instead of being home with my 12 yo. who is my youngest as  well.  <br/>
Sometimes I get so involved that I forget he&#39;s around momentarily,  and then I <br/>
remind myself that it&#39;s still not just about me.  I still have  to include him <br/>
in my life for the next few years.  I&#39;m thinking of going to  college, too, but <br/>
he still needs me and I have to do what he needs.<br/>
 <br/>
Can you work parttime and your son work parttime in different shifts so you  <br/>
can share the driving duties?  That would get him out of the house.   It <br/>
sounds to me like if you get a nursing degree, then you&#39;ll be having a  full-time <br/>
job after that.  What will he do then?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-867476094">Just some quick thoughts. <br/>
  (and understand I know where you are coming from. I&#39;m not someone who has tons of money or a hubby with a six figure salary. Mine lost a good job 7 years ago and I went back to work at the same time he went to work at wallyworld where he still works.)<br/>
   <br/>
  Why nursing right now if what you really need is money? Talk about a financial outlay.<br/>
   <br/>
  If you are up to it, wait tables for the next few years. Money is immediate and can be quite good. You can work when your dh is off (I&#39;m assuming he is going to get a job doing just about anything when his severance/unemployment runs out) and then your son will have someone aorund who can do things with him. For that matter it maybe a good thing for them to be around each other a ton.<br/>
  Until this summer I had been waiting tables for 6 years (this go around...I&#39;ve actually done it about 17 years off and on) till I just got fed up with my manager and quit (long story, silly thing to do, ended up having hernia surgery so I would have been off work for months anyway) and now sell Vintage Clothes on ebay. I made more money as a waitress, but my feet don&#39;t hurt anymore and I&#39;m FINALLY doing something I really, really love.<br/>
  If there is something you love and know about ebay is a good way to make extra money.<br/>
What does your son want you to do? What does he want to do?<br/>
  Is there anyone who he could hang with a few days a week while you are at school? Other homeschoolers/unschoolers?<br/>
