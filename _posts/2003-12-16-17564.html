Parent&#39;s Bill of Rights<br/>
Even though you are a parent, you have rights.  Be concerned with your <br/>
own rights.<br/>
<br/>
You have a right to a night&#39;s sleep without:<br/>
<br/>
  a.. Worrying where your child is.<br/>
  b.. Being awakened by your child coming in drunk, stoned, etc.<br/>
  c.. Phone emergencies from police, hospitals, stranded family members.<br/>
You have the right to:<br/>
<br/>
  a.. Live in a clean house.<br/>
  b.. Expect cooperation and courtesy in your home.<br/>
  c.. Expect responsible behavior from children in your family, <br/>
regardless of age.<br/>
  d.. Stop paying other&#39;s fines.<br/>
  e.. Stop &quot;helping&quot; your child and start taking care  of yourself.<br/>
  f.. Make changes in your behavior that your son/daughter does not like.<br/>
<br/>
You have the right not to be treated badly or inconsiderately by your <br/>
child.  Loving your child is no excuse for accepting rude, violent, <br/>
inconsiderate behavior. Help your children learn about your rights.  If <br/>
you do not make sure that your rights are respected, you cannot expect <br/>
others, even your children, to respect your rights.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243586788">FWIW, looks to me like they are advocating firm boundaries for <br/>
parents.  In theory, children eventually honor those boundaries and <br/>
learn to set their own respectful boundaries with others.  Also, <br/>
they point out that parents cannot continue to &#39;rescue&#39; bad <br/>
behaviors (paying fines, etc.) or their children will learn to live <br/>
in codependency throughout their lives.  Sometimes this stuff <br/>
feels &#39;unattached&#39; to me; not warm and fuzzy like I think of my own <br/>
family feelings.    <br/>
<br/>
But, it is nice to know I have a &quot;right&quot; to a clean house!!!  I will <br/>
inform my husband immediately as he is the worst culprit (not the <br/>
freakin kid)!!  lol  Now, can I call them?  Will they lock him up in <br/>
dirty house jail????  a little silly...<br/>
