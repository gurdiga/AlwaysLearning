<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004165278">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
I again am looking for more replies to the New Beginnings situation.  It <br/>
is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
I am going to start a new job in two weeks.  My baby is nine months old <br/>
and stays with her dad during the day, as he works the night shift.  <br/>
With my old job, he brought the baby to work at lunch so I only needed <br/>
to pump once in the morning.  I am uncertain how to broach this <br/>
breastfeeding/pumping subject with my new manager.  How do I let my <br/>
manager know that my pumping will not affect my work, and how do I talk <br/>
to him about the daily visits from my husband and infant? <br/>
<br/>
Send the responses to my email (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joylyn@...">joylyn@...</a>).  Also, replies <br/>
become the property of LLLI and are subject to editing.  :-)  Please <br/>
including your full postal address (full name, street address, city, <br/>
state, and zip)--we only publish your name and city, but we need the <br/>
rest to send you a copy of the magazine. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much!<br/>
<br/>
Joylyn</div>
