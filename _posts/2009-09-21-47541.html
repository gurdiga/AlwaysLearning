<div id="ygrps-yiv-482657079">The blogger, Steve Pavlina posted an article today about online communities, that I thought had some well-stated points. It&#39;s VERY long - start with &quot;You&#39;re an Invited Guest&quot; for the parts I thought most relevant about these email lists.<br/>
<br/>

I can say I get the most value from the moderated lists. Our local unschooling list barely discusses unschooling at all, because the owners have taken a &quot;we&#39;re not here to judge what people call unschooling&quot; attitude. It&#39;s nice for finding homeschoolers (who might call themselves unschoolers) who live close to me, but that&#39;s really about it.<br/>
<br/>
There has to be a clear vision for the email group and some discernment about what gets discussed, for it to be very valuable *unschooling* discussion. I&#39;m grateful this list is here.<br/>

I liked that line.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s wrong about the free speech, though. It&#39;s like freedom of the  <br/>
press.  I don&#39;t have the right to demand that Newsweek publishes my  <br/>
article, or even my letter to the editor I do have as much right to  <br/>
publish a magazine as the owners of Newsweek have.<br/>
<br/>
What people don&#39;t want is to write their one little article and send  <br/>
it to their friends and relatives. They want the entire readership of  <br/>
Newsweek!<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to be in a big unschooling discussion but doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want it to be mine, that&#39;s a problem. It belongs to somebody.  They  <br/>
can go along with the discussion as the owner prefers, or they can  <br/>
start their own discussion.  Their freedom of speech has to do with  <br/>
them having the same right I had to start a yahoo list or to have a  <br/>
webpage or a blogspot page or a Twitter account.  But some don&#39;t want  <br/>
their own small new list.  They want my fat, ripe eight-year-old  <br/>
vibrant list.   Nope; they don&#39;t get that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used the analogy he used to, about people being guests in my  <br/>
home, when they&#39;re guests on my forum/message board/whatever.   Some  <br/>
people don&#39;t get it because they think &quot;freedom of speech&quot; means they  <br/>
can say whatever they want to wherever they want to.  It means they  <br/>
can say what they want to at their own house (if it&#39;s not too loud for  <br/>
the neighbors and not too threatening).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the dark and shady part, though, and twice it happened this  <br/>
weekend.  Someone writes to me on the side and is really hateful or  <br/>
threatening because of something that happened in a public discussion,  <br/>
or because I returned a post on someone who was on moderation for  <br/>
being new to the group.  For someone to write me something mean on the  <br/>
side, that&#39;s like following me home to my house, and in the dark on my  <br/>
front porch, saying something really awful.   In my real life if  <br/>
someone did that I would turn on the porch light and if they didn&#39;t  <br/>
scurry off like a cockroach, I would call 911.  When it&#39;s e-mail, my  <br/>
version of turning on the porchlight is to bring it to the list and  <br/>
say &quot;Look what someone just did out on the dark front porch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am under no obligation whatsoever to let people threaten or insult  <br/>
me on my porch or in my e-mail.  I have the right to open the trapdoor  <br/>
under people on this list.  It&#39;s right in the intro, &quot;trapdoors for  <br/>
the uncooperative.&quot;  I&#39;m also not under any obligation to trap-door  <br/>
someone quickly.  If they insist on staying and being tacky, it&#39;s not  <br/>
illegal or immoral for me to give them another chance or three to see  <br/>
the porchlight and do better.<br/>
<br/>
When someone acts like a twerp or a twitchy-witchy woman, others will  <br/>
see and learn how not to be on other lists.  So there&#39;s a learning  <br/>
aspect too.  And if someone sees for the first time how terrible  <br/>
someone can be, even when there are others trying sincerely and freely  <br/>
to help them understand unschooling or parenting better, then many  <br/>
people have learned something, even if the crazed front-porch speech  <br/>
maker hasn&#39;t (yet).<br/>
