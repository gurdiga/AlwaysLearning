*licking* the ball.  Must have cracked everyone up.  &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

Better that she came back out and licked the neighbor boy!! &lt;woohoo, archaic <br/>
English!&gt;<br/>
[Except for the phrase still out there from a watch commercial, &quot;takes a <br/>
lickin&#39; and keeps on tickin&#39;,&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure my kids wouldn&#39;t know the <br/>
phrase &quot;a lickin.&quot;  They used it on the Simpsons once, when Bart was Tom <br/>
Sawyer and Milhouse (I think) said &quot;Whitewashin&#39; sucks, Tom--it POWERful <br/>
sucks.&quot;]<br/>
