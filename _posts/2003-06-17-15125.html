<div id="ygrps-yiv-314052365">Lexie has learned to open a wine bottle.  It just kinda happened, but I <br/>
think it&#39;s quite an achievement even if I can&#39;t put it on her Learning <br/>
Record.<br/>
<br/>
And Janene has learned how to perform a toast, better than some adults. <br/>
 Today Lexie brought me a glass of wine while I was bathing with Janene. <br/>
 She brought Janene a glass of water.  I made a toast to Janene, per <br/>
Janene&#39;s request.  &quot;To my most beautiful purple haired soon to be five <br/>
year old daughter, I&#39;m so lucky you are mine!&quot;  Janene makes her toast <br/>
&quot;To my wonderful and sweet mommy, whom I love dearly, I&#39;m lucky you are <br/>
my mommy!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
