<br/>
Pam wrote the above years ago. It&#39;s very inspirational. In it:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It does not get more difficult to learn most things later; it gets easier.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I immediately remembered how much easier statistics was when I was 43 than<br/>
when I first signed up at 35 and dropped it for later. I couldn&#39;t wrap my<br/>
head around it. The same is true for Karl who now finds it easy pick up<br/>
whole phrases (like &quot;no soy no dairy&quot; on the coconut milk container) at a<br/>
glance. That was today. He has been pulling up webpages, glancing at phrases<br/>
or directions, and reading them with no hesitation or confirmation to make<br/>
sure he&#39;s right. He knows it&#39;s right. About six months ago he said he would<br/>
have to learn the longest words in the world and then he would be able to<br/>
read, with a look on his face that it seemed impossible to imagine being<br/>
able to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is like that too. It gets easier and it gets better. I&#39;m having<br/>
fun watching things develop. It&#39;s like I&#39;m watching a movie and I get some<br/>
good lines in my part too. Karl who has always been one to avoid schedules<br/>
is now interested in winding back his sleep schedule. Who knew. He says it&#39;s<br/>
time for bed.<br/>
