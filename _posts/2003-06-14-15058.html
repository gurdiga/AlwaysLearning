Council, and constantly hears whining about Girl Scouts and how bad it is. (One <br/>
theme seems to be adults who boast with pride, &quot;I was kicked out of Girl Scouts!&quot; <br/>
We suspect their parents pulled them out because they were tired of getting <br/>
calls about how disruptive they are, then told them they were kicked out.)<br/>
<br/>
Beth will appreciate someone talking about the positives for a change.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m thinking of it, I have a rant. Recently the Philadelphia area Boy <br/>
Scout council&#39;s board unanimously voted in a non-discrimination policy <br/>
(including about sexual orientation). A long-time teenage Boy Scout then came out in a <br/>
newspaper interview...and was kicked out. Sigh...<br/>
