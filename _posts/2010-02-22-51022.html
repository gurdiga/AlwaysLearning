<div id="ygrps-yiv-616220274">I forgot to bring the John Holt quotes!<br/>
<br/>
The list count has passed 2500:  Members: 2519<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure 1000 of them have forgotten they were on the list, or are  <br/>
duplicates, or something, but that definitely leaves the &quot;over a  <br/>
thousand&quot; I picture when I&#39;m writing.<br/>
<br/>
This new member count is also higher than usual:  Activity within 7  <br/>
days: 39 New Members - 204 New Messages -<br/>
<br/>
I know there are some people on the list for no other reason that to  <br/>
try to persuade people to go to other lists.  I know who a couple of  <br/>
them are, but it&#39;s not worth making a deal of it.   They have lists  <br/>
with no &quot;face,&quot; no outlet, made of disgruntled and frustrated people  <br/>
they pick up here and there, and take to their negative, not-so- <br/>
helpful lists.  So if you&#39;re recruited on the side, from this list, it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t done by someone with good intentions.  And they probably don&#39;t  <br/>
count half their members as active as I&#39;ve always done.  They think  <br/>
they&#39;re doing something really great, no doubt, but they&#39;re not  <br/>
hurting me, they&#39;re not hurting this list, and they&#39;re misleading  <br/>
unschoolers in the dozens.<br/>
<br/>
Those John Holt Quotes in handwriting.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m going to put them out where people can see them better.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
look in the files and photos of yahoo groups very often.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to contribute one to a collections, find a Holt quote  <br/>
you like, write it in your own writing, scan it (or send it and I&#39;ll  <br/>
scan it and put it on my site) and others can come and be inspired.<br/>
