pets.  When they hatch, or at least when you can first see them, they&#39;re <br/>
maybe a quarter of an inch long.  We kept them in a gallon jar with some <br/>
water and raspberry or blackberry leaves.  They grew to be maybe 4 inches <br/>
long.  Where I live, they wouldn&#39;t be able to survive the winter, so I <br/>
didn&#39;t worry too much if they got loose.  You&#39;d have to think carefully <br/>
about that if you live where it doesn&#39;t freeze, unless they are native in <br/>
your area.  I can&#39;t offer any ideas on where to get them.  They were passed <br/>
around our local homeschooling community when anyone had babies to get rid of.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our parkeet is Zazu... I&#39;m afraid our pets&#39; names sometimes reflect popular<br/>
culture from the time in which we acquire them.  I had an Airedale named<br/>
Jonathan (Livingston Airedale, of course!).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A rat named Arwen? And Legolas? I LOVE it!!  An elvish sort of rat.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mice.  The mice are getting elvish names; they have such large ears.<br/>
Legolas is a type called a dumbo, for its even larger large ears (he&#39;s<br/>
calico adorable, btw).<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t consistent in naming from novels, though.  Dd named her cat Violet<br/>
and her first two rats Lucy and Cheryl, for no other reason than she liked<br/>
the names; her second pair of rats were Isabelle (Izzy) and Chloe, after<br/>
characters in &quot;Disaster Blasters.&quot;  (Chloe is the surviving cinnamon blue.)<br/>
Sparky the English Shepherd was named for Charles Schulz, the first name we<br/>
could agree on in a hurry -- &quot;Bubba&quot; just had to go!  I wanted to call him<br/>
Johnny Cash, but the kids vetoed me.<br/>

sticky-footed kinds, do not require the lighting set-up of most lizards, and<br/>
eat mealworms which you keep in the fridge (hey, I have dead mice in my<br/>
freezer, so what&#39;s a worm or two in the butter compartment?).  Your 10-gal.<br/>
aquarium would be just fine; be sure to get the kind of heater that sticks<br/>
onto the bottom (that&#39;s your biggest expense since you already have a tank).<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t even need a screen top if you don&#39;t have a cat who might jump<br/>
in and eat the little guy; they can&#39;t climb out.  If you feed him crickets,<br/>
though, you&#39;d need a top &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are hypoallergenic cats, rats and dogs, too, but they tend to be<br/>
hairless.  ;-)<br/>

and really don&#39;t have much personality, guinea pigs are bigger and sort<br/>
of dull (which also makes them a great pet for preschoolers, my sister<br/>
once forgot a guinea pig on the sofa and when we asked her hours later<br/>
she rushed back and the guinea hadn&#39;t moved an inch), and gerbils can be<br/>
interesting but are also awfully jumpy, at least compared to a rat. Rats<br/>
are the smartest, most easily tamed, and friendliest rodents - and I&#39;ve<br/>
owned all of the above plus hamsters, as well as at least 7 or 8 rats.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mice smell a lot more than rats!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always kept rodents and cats in the same room, with tight-fitting<br/>
lids on the rodent cages. Granted, our cats are sort of slow and stupid,<br/>
but they have been interested in the various rodents, especially the<br/>
mice... but we&#39;ve always had cages big enough that they can&#39;t be pushed<br/>
around by cats, and the cats generally give up, although they still like<br/>
to watch..<br/>

they must have very high matabolisms because they eat a lot so you can&#39;t be<br/>
casual about feeding them regularly.<br/>
<br/>
I found the mice to be more work than what they returned. But the cats sure<br/>
enjoyed watching them! :-)<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ve owned gerbils, guinea pigs, rats and ferrets, but never mice.  I<br/>
think there are two issues to consider: which are easiest to care for,<br/>
and which make the best pets.  My experience has been that rats are the<br/>
best pets by a huge margin (though if you were including ferrets in this<br/>
discussion, they would be equal to rats, but in a very different way),<br/>
but gerbils are by far the easiest to care for.  Since gerbils are<br/>
desert animals, they don&#39;t go through a lot of water.  They eat a lot<br/>
less that rats or ferrets also, and since they are not carnivores like<br/>
rats and ferrets, they&#39;re poop doesn&#39;t smell as much.  A friend of ours<br/>
who is very gerbil experienced gave us a great tip  - put lots of drier<br/>
lint in the tank and let them tunnel, tunnel, tunnel.  It makes them<br/>
much happier and much more fun to watch.  With that said, I will never<br/>
own gerbils again.  I personally think they were put on the planet to<br/>
bite people&#39;s children.  Since rats eat meat-based foods, they&#39;re poop<br/>
is wetter and smellier, and they eat and drink a lot more than gerbils,<br/>
but they are SO, SO much fun to own.  They come to you rather than<br/>
running from you, they love to snuggle in your hair, they come when<br/>
called much of the time, they kiss (I hear some of you saying ewwww!)<br/>
:), and you can train them.  It&#39;s like having a tiny dog in a cage!!  I<br/>
found guinea pigs to be more trouble than gerbils and not near as<br/>
rewarding as rats.  Ferrets are awesome, but lots of work and<br/>
long-lived.  I think rats are winning in your poll!<br/>

of these are the easiest?  I&#39;m sorta ODed on critters.<br/>
Cedar shavings don&#39;t work? What about shredded<br/>
newspaper or other paper?  We have a paper shredder.<br/>
Copy paper tends to have sharp edges, but things like<br/>
my Hamilton Bookseller flyers are newsprint. OK for<br/>
worms......Where will I put them? They can&#39;t be on the<br/>
porch, the cats have access, I loath the smell of<br/>
mice, so I prefer them not in the house, but I guess I<br/>
may just have to hold my breath :-) Glad this<br/>
discussion is going on just now, when I needed to<br/>
learn a little more up-to-date info.  My older boys<br/>
had mice, and gerbils.  They were a bother!  But I did<br/>
learn a lot about rodent habits....however we lived in<br/>
a larger house at that time, this is a wobbly-box!!<br/>
LOTS of OUTdoor space!!! And the older boys had each<br/>
other to express enthusiasm with...Roy only has<br/>
me....and I am squimish with mice....though I can and<br/>
have faked it.....oooo! Well, maybe I can fake it,<br/>
again. Maybe.<br/>

I know ferrets are illegal here, the rationale being that they could get<br/>

that the ferrets kept as pets have been domesticated for hundreds of<br/>
years and thousands of generations and most likely couldn&#39;t even survive<br/>

Funny, though, many petstores sell ferret food, and ferret cages, and<br/>

Ferrets can&#39;t. Cats are good, domestic ferrets are totally lame. They won&#39;t<br/>
eat stuff that doesn&#39;t come in a container marked &quot;ferret food&quot;. It would be<br/>

turned out to be deaf after I&#39;d already adopted him, and he was so<br/>
brutally aggressive - leaping on my pants leg, climbing up and biting me<br/>
in the stomach (I swear I&#39;m not making this up!), that I took him to the<br/>

that he was deaf, and helped me deal with his behavioral problems.  I<br/>
still don&#39;t allow strangers to touch him or get my mouth too close to<br/>
his mouth (he still likes to latch onto lips), and my husband and oldest<br/>
son still don&#39;t care to handle him much, but overall he&#39;s become a very<br/>
decent pet now.  My funniest ferret story ever was a couple of years ago<br/>
when I still owned my Border Terrier, who came from a line of dogs bred<br/>
to go to ground - a dog sport where they work through a tunnel to find a<br/>
ferret or rat in a cage and then bark maniacally.  He was never the<br/>
boldest of Border Terriers, but he loved to stalk the ferrets.  One day<br/>
the above-mentioned aggressive ferret got loose.  I didn&#39;t realize this<br/>
until I walked through my family room, only to see my terrier slumping<br/>
through the room like Eeyore (sp?), with the ferret merrily bouncing<br/>
along behind him, grabbing at his hindquarters!  It was the saddest,<br/>
funniest thing you&#39;ve ever seen!  I told the Border Terrier&#39;s breeder<br/>
about it and she made me promise never to tell the rest of the Border<br/>
Terrier club, for fear of utter humiliation.<br/>

once, so I don&#39;t think aggreesiveness is the problem. My ferret was<br/>
definitely top-pet in a household that included a dog (black lab) and 2<br/>
cats, all uncaged. And she ate cat food and raw eggs, since these were<br/>
the days before commercially available ferret chow.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I don&#39;t think they could survive in the wild, especially in the<br/>
desert where the black-footed ferret lives. The ferret that killed the<br/>
chinchilla didn&#39;t eat it... I know some cats and dogs survive go feral -<br/>
our lamest cat was born feral, he is so lucky he found us! - but not<br/>
ferrets, according to everything I&#39;ve ever read on it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335499402">I never meant they were cowards. The four ferrets we&#39;ve owned would have <br/>
cheerfully bounced up to a Grizzly. (&quot;Hi! We&#39;re Lewis! And Clark! We&#39;re<br/>
ferrets! Got any Yogurt Drops?&quot;  We named the second pair Smith and Wesson.)<br/>
<br/>
But domestic ferrets don&#39;t establish wild colonies (there may, somewhere, be<br/>
an exception or two, but this is a general rule). All of us can think of<br/>
examples (as Joyce pointed out) of wild cat colonies. Dogs can go feral,<br/>
though not as easily or successfully (usually) as cats, until they breed<br/>
through a couple of generations and you get a more competent feral dog. When<br/>
ferrets get out, they come back or die.<br/>
<br/>
There are few domestic ferrets who can successfully learn to hunt *wild*<br/>
rodents out on their own (many will eventually kill some hapless mouse you<br/>
put in the cage, but that&#39;s a far cry from hunting).<br/>
<br/>
I used to be involved with the efforts to get ferrets legalized in<br/>
California. Part of that was reading reports from 48 other states Fish &<br/>
Game Depts. that there were no feral ferret colonies anywhere in the U.S.<br/>
that anybody could find. California, in spite of the ban, is one of the most<br/>
ferret populous states around. We don&#39;t have wild ferret colonies in spite<br/>
of the fact that domestic ferrets are Already Here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314849581">Our ferrets got along *great* with our cats (they tried to get along great<br/>
with our dogs, too, but our dogs were afraid of them &lt;g&gt;). The cats learned<br/>
to play with them very well, both species have a similar &quot;pounce&quot; style of<br/>
play. You will find that almost nothing intimidates a ferret. I would never<br/>
have left them alone together, but there were no problems.<br/>
<br/>
I would not advise ferrets loose with any &quot;prey&quot; animals (rabbits, mice,<br/>
rats, guinea pigs, etc.) though ours didn&#39;t seem to have any hunting<br/>
instincts to speak of, except of course when they were attacking our feet!<br/>
(Only as babies and only when we were wearing socks. Like kittens, it just<br/>
takes a little time and training until your toes are safe).<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to do anything interesting with ferrets, contact me off line,<br/>
I have some advice, one Californian to another. ;)<br/>

Since you seem to have a lot of experience with ferrets...<br/>
How do ferrets and cats get along (in general, I mean)? We have<br/>
two dogs and a cat and I would like to get a ferret, but I&#39;m not<br/>
sure how the cat and ferret would react to each other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107177251">I know you asked Pam this question, but thought I&#39;d chime in!  My cats<br/>
and ferrets have always gotten along beautifully.  They have either<br/>
ignored each other or played together.  Generally they&#39;ve played until<br/>
the cats grew up, then stopped.  Dogs have been another story.  Some of<br/>
my dogs have gotten along fine with my ferrets, but one of my Dalmatians<br/>
killed one of my ferrets (long story), and I think either of my other<br/>
Dalmatians might do the same if given the chance.<br/>
