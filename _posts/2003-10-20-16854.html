<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333315342">&lt;&lt;After explaining to Janene how we didn&#39;t have money to burn on buying <br/>
little bouncy balls which are dangerous to the dogs, I turned to the mom<br/>
<br/>
and said &#39;that&#39;s how unschooling works!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Joylyn&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share something cool.  Jay, 7, older than Janene of<br/>
course, tripped me out the other night.  Several weeks ago in passing it<br/>
came up that even numbers can be divided into two equal parts -<br/>
something along the lines of a 2 second comment.  I didn&#39;t think about<br/>
it again. A couple of nights ago as I was tucking Jay into bed he<br/>
started with &quot;6 is an even number, 7 is not, 8 is an even number, 9 is<br/>
not...&quot;  so on... I asked him how he knew that... He said, &quot;I just<br/>
picture it in my head and see if there are the same number on each side<br/>
when I make two groups.&quot;  He even asked how you &quot;picture&quot; larger amounts<br/>
like 22 and 387, etc.  Lol... I told him just look at the last number.<br/>
So he lay in bed for a while coming up with huge numbers and designating<br/>
them even or odd. I don&#39;t know if that sounds like much, but it was to<br/>
me.  :)  btw - had a great time with Lexie yesterday - she showed Jay<br/>
and me around the island in the park we were at... She is such a hoot<br/>
and I enjoy her when we see her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it sounds like a lot too!  I think it&#39;s very meaningful that he <br/>
can a. picture numbers in his head and divide them and play with them.  <br/>
This means he is way ahead so much of our population.  And b. that he <br/>
can comprehend odd and even, and c. that one little comment can take you <br/>
such a long way! <br/>

<br/>
She is a sweet funny girl with so much personality.  I think about how <br/>
she was when she was five, and she so could have been molded into a <br/>
perfect school child, she could have played the game and been teacher&#39;s <br/>
pet and learned to earn perfect &#39;A&#39;s.  I&#39;m so very glad we didn&#39;t do <br/>
that, because she is a hoot.  :-)<br/>

there I might of gone.  I was sorta partied out, I am such an introvert <br/>
and sometimes that isn&#39;t good. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Joylyn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Introvert?  wow, I never really saw you as such...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, introvert.  You should have seen me as a child, I was literally <br/>
forced by my parents to learn to get along in social situations, and I <br/>
often felt (feel?) very uncomfortable, teased, and not very well liked.  <br/>
I had the oppotunity to be in gifted classes, but my parents felt that I <br/>
needed to learn to get along with my peers, and because of the fact I <br/>
was gifted and different, I was teased constantly.  I hated school and <br/>
learned to hate social situations.  During park days, I have to repress <br/>
these feelings, and social situations are very uncomfortable for me. I <br/>
come away thinking &quot;did I say things OK?  Did I make a fool of myself?  <br/>
Did I talk too loud?  Did I say stupid things?  Does everyone hate me?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
How different my life could have been if I had just been around my <br/>
peers, if I had not been forced to &quot;socialize&quot; with children with whom I <br/>
had nothing in common? <br/>
<br/>
I am also an introvert because I get energy from being alone, not from <br/>
being with people.  Mark is an extrovert.  If I have to do too many <br/>
things with people (like too many parties or gatherings over a short <br/>
time period (a weekend), especially if I have to be &quot;on&quot; like a LLL <br/>
Meeting or Girl Scout function when I am in charge or in the classroom <br/>
as the teacher&quot; I need to have quiet time alone to recharge.  Now that <br/>
I&#39;m &quot;on&quot; in the classroom 8 hours a day, and coaching and brownies and <br/>
LLL during the week, etc. I feel as though on the weekend I need more me <br/>
time, so I limit stuff to one day.  Make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish I was a true extrovert, instead of someone who was <br/>
forced to pretend to be one as a child. <br/>

Janene is my &quot;little pill.&quot;  :-)<br/>

A hoot is pretty good too, though.<br/>

I know this one.  Probably contributes greatly to my being so quiet <br/>
most of the time - harkening back to the old saying - better to say <br/>
nothing and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have too many close friends.  Part of me figures if people <br/>
actually get to know me, they really won&#39;t like me.  I find if I <br/>
start hitting it off with anyone, I end up pulling away just to <br/>
avoid the inevitable.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;I hated school and <br/>
&gt; learned to hate social situations.  During park days, I have to <br/>
repress <br/>
&gt; these feelings, and social situations are very uncomfortable for <br/>
me. I <br/>

<br/>
Again... all too familiar.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; I am also an introvert because I get energy from being alone, not <br/>

<br/>
Complete sense.  I enjoy the park and like that the kids get to hang <br/>
out with other cool kids.  But after a while I get over-loaded <br/>
sometimes and need to go home and find some solitude.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Joylyn, who is rambling and who, as soon as she sends this will <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; &quot;should I have sent that?:&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you should have.  Or at least I&#39;m glad you did.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure everyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinks I&#39;m a pill... as opposed to the far more desirable hoot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know, I like the word pill.  <br/>
<br/>
My grandmother was the THE... the (yes, the) stereotypical Jewish <br/>
grandmother.  I got the word &quot;pill&quot; from her.  Perhaps it&#39;s one of <br/>
those regional or generational words as regards to its meaning or <br/>
usage.  I don&#39;t know.  When she used it, it was in reference to <br/>
someone who might be mildly amusing, but with an annoying edge - <br/>
someone you just look at with a blank stare, maybe a couple of <br/>
expressionless blinks.  lol... Schmuck, now, that was a whole other <br/>
matter.  Never good to be a schmuck.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve always been a &quot;pill&quot;, and <br/>
&gt; Janene is my &quot;little pill.&quot;  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see to it that my use of the word pill is appropriate to given <br/>
company then.  lol.  But then I don&#39;t as a rule sit around name <br/>
calling or using derogatory language in groups. So if I were to use <br/>
it, assuming I was actually going to speak, it would probably be <br/>
more like your version anyway.<br/>
