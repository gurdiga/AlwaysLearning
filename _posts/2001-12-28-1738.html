<div id="ygrps-yiv-707468481">Hi all<br/>
My name is Cathy, married to Craig, and living in South-Africa. I have 5<br/>
children, who have always been homeschooled, oldest is nearly 12, youngest<br/>
is 5 months. Recently I have become interested in Unschooling, and am<br/>
particularly interested to clarify whether or not I can be both a Christian<br/>
and an Unschooler - there is fairly heated debate on this topic in<br/>
homeschooling circles I notice! We are currently conducting an &quot;Unschooling<br/>
Experiment&quot; in our home (we have been Unschooling since 9 October), and I am<br/>
pretty excited with what I am observing. I am also reading John Holt, who, I<br/>
think, introduced the seminal ideas that led to Unschooling, and I am<br/>
challenged and intrigued. As a result I am interested in communicating with<br/>
people who are Unschooling, and who are Christians, and who feel that it is<br/>
possible to reconcile the two. I would like to know more, so I am here to<br/>
learn....<br/>
Blessings<br/>
Cathy<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I&#39;ve never seen the unschooling.com list -- in fact, I&#39;m new to this<br/>
list<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rational discussion.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling.<br/>
&gt; Honesty.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;...and what&#39;s the importance of having a moderator for it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is *the* list of www.unschooling.com, HEM&#39;s unschooling forum.  It has<br/>
500<br/>
&gt; members, give or take, as life flows.  If it is not a good, safe, place<br/>
&gt; promoting unschooling, unschooling is not as well protected and promoted<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; some would like for it to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This list formed as a result of a car wreck of sorts during an<br/>
&gt; unschooling-dotcom rush hour.   Sometimes side roads are best.  But<br/>
freeways<br/>
&gt; are still important.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What John Holt stuff is available to read online?  Some people don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; good access to the books.<br/>

Thanks for clarifying. I am not looking for a &#39;&#39;Christian group&#39;&#39;. I am<br/>
wanting to learn about Unschooling, and I need to clarify for my own frame<br/>
of reference how it fits with Christianity. Seems a worthwhile research<br/>
topic anyway!<br/>
Will look at the recommended website...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757063392">Hi Cathy and welcome. We just had a lively, respectful and pretty <br/>
interesting discussion about Christianity and unschooling. You can find <br/>
those in the archives at Yahoo. There have also been quite a few discussions <br/>
on the topic over at unschooling.com. If you haven&#39;t already done so, I&#39;d <br/>
point you to the message boards over there as well. Lots of great <br/>
discussion, info, support and advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274445797">Hello<br/>
I finally made it to this group through, Robin, I know you sent this <br/>
like a month ago. I have been lurking for a few weeks since then. Now <br/>
that I finally have my own computer, I have learned that I am not <br/>
computer savvy, or as my children say  I&#39;m &quot;computerbarrissing&quot;.  <br/>
My name is Kimberlie Patraw, I go by my old nickname: Kime. I  have 7 <br/>
children ranging in age from 15 to 4.  John Holt was one of the first <br/>
books I read about 8 yrs ago, but I admit I had a difficult time <br/>
applying his ideals. Shortly after I began homeschooling I met Sandra, <br/>
---[I&#39;m glad to see you on line ---in a computer type email I know how <br/>
to work]; without her common sense, my oldest son would have hated his <br/>
parents.  My journey into homeschooling has not been easy for me. My <br/>
ideas were a bit messed up, partially due to too many years of playing <br/>
the college game. I have been growing closer to unschooling, but I know <br/>
my journey is not over. Now my oldest son is  purely unschooled, due to <br/>
his own strengths and desires, and with a little help from Sandra in the <br/>
past. The rest of my children are unschooled to a certain extent of <br/>
cooperativeness.<br/>
Our families biggest interest  is chess, we all play and we travel to <br/>
play in different tournaments when possible. As family we like hiking, <br/>
backpacking, camping, swimming, and playing all different types of <br/>
games. I think I said enough or too much. Kime</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468654807">We are still in Nevada. We moved to the south and are now in Las Vegas. <br/>
 This is good, because of our interest in chess. Mike has become very <br/>
good at chess and now plays with the experts. Most of his friends are <br/>
over 30, and live all over the world. A couple of high school coaches <br/>
have been trying to get him to play for their team, so he went down a <br/>
checked it out and didn&#39;t like it. He said the team was just to immature <br/>
for him, and the campus looked like a jail. The high schools here are <br/>
closed campuses, so you arrive and are locked in behind large steel <br/>
gates with barbed wire fencing around the fields. That bothers Mike, and <br/>
he won&#39;t go back even for an after school event. I could rant more on <br/>
it, but I think you get the picture.<br/>
I have found a few more unschoolers down here. Not as many as we had in <br/>
New Mexico, and I am still considered a radical.  I got involved with <br/>
some of the politics here, which is probably why my alignment is more <br/>
fearful. Those who don&#39;t agree with me, call me a trouble maker. They <br/>
say that to my face, it&#39;s too funny.  <br/>
All I need is a quick comeback and I would be set, but I am too slow of <br/>
wit. So it just drops off there.  Its good see your name again Sandra, <br/>
and thanks for the welcome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783066947">Hi, Robyn.  Welcome!  I love meeting people with lots of kids.  I have 4 <br/>
and would like to have at least 2 more.<br/>
<br/>
I have not had a cesarean, but reading all your stories, I now truly <br/>
appreciate how lucky I am to have very easy births.  One thing I&#39;ve <br/>
always believed helped me to have it easy was used the Bradley method. <br/>
 It made me feel so empowered and in control. Did anyone else use it and <br/>
what did you think?  I do know that it teaches how to handle VBAC&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think using the help of a midwife and a doula play a huge part in <br/>
the course of a pregnancy and labor.  I went to an obstetrician for the <br/>
first 6 months of my 1st pregnancy and switched to a midwife at 7 mnths <br/>
because I realized that my dr really didn&#39;t even know who I was, not <br/>
really.  Nor did he care to.  To him I was just another customer there <br/>
for him to crank a baby out of and put money in his pocket. My midwives <br/>
have always been so much more caring and willing to talk and discuss <br/>
things for as long as I need to.   HeidiC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5135111">Hello everyone!!<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Kerri & my family lives in Ontario on 3 acres of forest in a house we started to build in 1998. <br/>
<br/>
While in college I had a placement & then did research working with language delayed & not language delayed pre-schoolers who were primarily in day-cares. That is when I decided I would NEVER put my child/ren in day-care. Then I was at a placement in the primary school system & decided I could not put my kids into primary school either. <br/>
<br/>
Personally school was not a very good experience for me. We moved a lot when I was a kid (my dad was a bank manager). I almost always ended up starting at a new school at the end of October. My marks were always good despite all this. However I was very tiny for my age, was placed a year ahead (started senior kindergarten when I was 4) and I wore glasses. So...I was teased A LOT.<br/>
<br/>
Then I got to high-school I was still very tiny, still wore glasses & had moved from the city to a very small town so was an out-cast because I was a &quot;city-slicker&quot;. Though I did surprise them with my &quot;country&quot; knowledge as I had always wanted to live in the country & had volunteered at a country animal-shelter and with twin veterinarians who did large & small animals when I did live in the last city. For some odd reason they all thought I was super-smart. Ha, far from it!! So I was shunned into the &quot;smart&quot; group, which was also apparently the &quot;kids of professionals&quot; group. They wouldn&#39;t accept me either because I wasn&#39;t snobby enough!! So I had the odd friend here & there & was never in a group. I was however, still teased a lot. I was stuffed into my locker (not locked in at least), the football players would scoop me up onto their shoulders, carry me half way through the school & make me late for class. Plus the verbal teasing wasn&#39;t pleasant either. <br/>
<br/>
So I would be content for my kids to not go to high-school either.  We belong to a provincial home-schooling organization right now. <br/>
<br/>
I had to really convince DH that our kids would be fine learning at home. His brother is a teacher & his new wife is too. They were against our choice to home-school as were both sets of our parents. My MIL even told my oldest DD if she didn&#39;t go to school she would end up being stupid. Funny thing is BIL&#39;s DD was home-schooled by his ex-wife & his DD went on to a 3 year college program in computers.In the meantime, his DS (living with my BIL) was unable to read when he was in grade 9. BIL had no idea till the school told him!So I figured he better stop nagging us about the merits of &quot;public&quot; education!!<br/>
<br/>
I essentially unschool. Have tried the &quot;forced&quot; book work stuff when DH was bugging me to do it. Kids & I never lasted long ( a few days ). It was often after visiting with his parents!! <br/>
<br/>
After my twins were born the 4 older kids were totally unschooling!! It really is amazing to see how much they do learn just from living life. <br/>
<br/>
The kids have recently asked if we could do learning stuff in the mornings. So we do, but their choice of what to do.<br/>
<br/>
My issue right now is my 13 year old DD really wanting to go to high-school. She admits it is for social reasons, not to learn. So I am trying to give her alternative ideas, other than going to a &quot;brick & mortar institution&quot;. My DH had a wonderful high-school experience & seems oblivious to the abuse, drugs, attitudes, teasing, etc. that occured. We went to the same high-school, but he is 2 years older. I must say, that he was one of the popular kids who teased the other kids. We met after we were both done school & he was very different when not with his previous peer group.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if he was married to someone that was very mainstream. That he would also be mainstream. He has agreed with my choices for our family, because that is what I think is best. But though he agrees, it isn&#39;t in his heart, they way it is in mine. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry this ended up being a novel didn&#39;t it!!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to getting support here for my choice of unschooling my children. Thanks for having this group!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147945504">My dh and I don&#39;t tend to have many conversations about what it means to<br/>
unschool, it&#39;s more my interest and not his.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, today I was talking about how much I have been learning from this<br/>
list.  He said that in his opinion school is pretty much designed to teach<br/>
kids from a young age to be somewhere they don&#39;t want to be, working for<br/>
someone they don&#39;t necessarily like, doing something they don&#39;t necessarily<br/>
like, so they can then go home.  Wow...  he is so right!<br/>
<br/>
This led us to a conversation about how often we use words to communicate<br/>
something that&#39;s been programmed without really thinking about what we are<br/>
saying.  Some words we might use that are really &#39;schooly&#39; for example.<br/>
This ties into a book I&#39;ve been reading called &quot;Non-Violent Communication&quot;,<br/>
which shows how to separate our expressions of observation, feeling,<br/>
request - and not throw evaluation or judgement into the mix.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to get glimmers of deeper understanding.  It still doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be something I can communicate very well, but I can feel a shift.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008904318">Hi, I live in the north of England and have joined your group because <br/>
I am committed to home-based unschooling with my little boy, just <br/>
turned three. I have not always had the courage of my convictions, my <br/>
son took me by surprise (I wasn&#39;t supposed to be able to conceive)and <br/>
since his birth I have struggled to extracate myself from some very <br/>
unhealthy relationships which have left me with low self-esteem, <br/>
anxiety problems and a hard time trusting my own instincts. <br/>
Consequently, I have done things in the first three years of my sons <br/>
life which I regret - following the advice/opinions of others rather <br/>
than trusting myself. I do, however, have extremely strong <br/>
ideals/beliefs which I am now learning to live by. My belief in <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling runs to the very core of my being.<br/>
I am looking forward to &#39;talking&#39; with you all and learning from your <br/>
thoughts/experience.<br/>

It&#39;s too late to get tickets, I think, so I hope you already knew about  it.  <br/>
HesFes is a campout in the end of May, the other end of the country from  <br/>
you.  <br/>
If aren&#39;t making it this year, maybe next year.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re going this year, though, my daughter Holly will be there.<br/>
If you&#39;re going next year, hundreds of other unschoolers will be there but  <br/>
not likely Holly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122432397">I just realized that I maybe did not do an introduction before I started posting. I tried to <br/>
scan older posts to see where I posted originally, and don&#39;t really see any of my posts. <br/>
Odd, because I know I&#39;ve read them before. Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my name is Melissa, I live in Oklahoma. I&#39;m married to a networking tech named <br/>
Zane, we have seven kids. Josh is age 10, Breanna is 8, Emily is almost 7, Rachel is 5, Sam <br/>
is four, Dan is two, and Avari is four weeks old today. I&#39;ve posted before about my 8yo, <br/>
who has severe autism. Josh also has autism in the form of Aspergers. Sam has dysarthria, <br/>
characterized mostly by his speech deficits. On top of that, Bre is allergic to all cornbased <br/>
products and Dan is allergic to wheat.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short was I had always planned on homeschooling the kids, but when Bre was <br/>
diagnosed at age three I was convinced that the school system would know what was best <br/>
for her. That was the same year that Josh was to start kindergarden, and dh was deadset <br/>
against homeschooling. After three years, public school became a struggle. Emily and <br/>
Rachel started school, Emily in kindergarden, Rachel in PreK, Josh was dxed, and Breanna <br/>
left the comfort of the developmentally delayed program. By last Christmas I was ready to <br/>
pull my poor, stressed out children OUT of school.  We left them in til the end of the year. <br/>
Bre&#39;s psych is generally against homeschooling for someone as severe as she is, but finally <br/>
agreed it was that or medicating her. What a fool I was for thinking the schools are trained <br/>
for this. In some places maybe, but not here. <br/>
<br/>
My plan was to just spend a year getting to know my kids, and practice being a family. Bre <br/>
needs a schedule, so it was easy to kind of follow the preschool schedule that Emily and <br/>
Rachel were used to from preschool and kindergarden. It worked until I was put on <br/>
bedrest. Actually we had a lot of fun, and we had fun on bedrest too. It was probably the <br/>
best thing that happened, lots of times the kids would bring books to me, we did a lot of <br/>
just growing from one topic to the next, depending on their interests. Josh and Emily love <br/>
to sit and work on math, so they are the kind to ask for math equations. Rachel loves to <br/>
draw, and actually learned to read from art books. Breanna is very kinesthetic, learns by <br/>
doing. Sam is very active. The school last year kept asking him how excited he was to <br/>
starte preschool this year, and I thought even if we were going to keep them home, there <br/>
was NO way I would send Sam to preK, they would break his spirit in no time. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would like to unschool. I would like a lot of support to unschool. I think because <br/>
of my thinking, it will be hard for me. there is a lot of the pressure that Sandra mentioned <br/>
earlier in the &#39;filter&#39; of others. It&#39;s very hard for me to face other people when they ask me <br/>
over and over what curriculum I use, how many hours a day we study, etc. And I say none. <br/>
<br/>
thanks all for reading this far (forgive my presumption in that, it&#39;s possible that no one has <br/>
made it so far LOL!) Please be patient with me, i was referred from the always learning <br/>
website as this being the place to learn more about unschooling. :-) I think i was referred <br/>
to always learning from Oklahoma radical mothers. I dont&#39; know that I&#39;m so radical, but I <br/>
like the idea. :-P<br/>

Rachel were used to from preschool and kindergarden. It worked until I was put on <br/>
bedrest. Actually we had a lot of fun, and we had fun on bedrest too. It was probably the <br/>
best thing that happened, lots of times the kids would bring books to me, we did a lot of <br/>
just growing from one topic to the next, depending on their interests. Josh and Emily love <br/>
to sit and work on math, so they are the kind to ask for math equations. Rachel loves to <br/>
draw, and actually learned to read from art books. Breanna is very kinesthetic, learns by <br/>
doing. Sam is very active. The school last year kept asking him how excited he was to <br/>
starte preschool this year, and I thought even if we were going to keep them home, there <br/>
was NO way I would send Sam to preK, they would break his spirit in no time. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would like to unschool. I would like a lot of support to unschool. I think because <br/>
of my thinking, it will be hard for me. there is a lot of the pressure that Sandra mentioned <br/>
earlier in the &#39;filter&#39; of others. It&#39;s very hard for me to face other people when they ask me <br/>
over and over what curriculum I use, how many hours a day we study, etc. And I say none. <br/>

made it so far LOL!) Please be patient with me, i was referred from the always learning <br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Introduction<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just realized that I maybe did not do an introduction before I started<br/>
posting. I tried to <br/>
scan older posts to see where I posted originally, and don&#39;t really see any<br/>
of my posts. <br/>
Odd, because I know I&#39;ve read them before. Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my name is Melissa, I live in Oklahoma. I&#39;m married to a networking<br/>
tech named <br/>
Zane, we have seven kids. Josh is age 10, Breanna is 8, Emily is almost 7,<br/>
Rachel is 5, Sam <br/>
is four, Dan is two, and Avari is four weeks old today. I&#39;ve posted before<br/>
about my 8yo, <br/>
who has severe autism. Josh also has autism in the form of Aspergers. Sam<br/>
has dysarthria, <br/>
characterized mostly by his speech deficits. On top of that, Bre is allergic<br/>
to all cornbased <br/>
products and Dan is allergic to wheat.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short was I had always planned on homeschooling the kids, but<br/>
when Bre was <br/>
diagnosed at age three I was convinced that the school system would know<br/>
what was best <br/>
for her. That was the same year that Josh was to start kindergarden, and dh<br/>
was deadset <br/>
against homeschooling. After three years, public school became a struggle.<br/>
Emily and <br/>
Rachel started school, Emily in kindergarden, Rachel in PreK, Josh was dxed,<br/>
and Breanna <br/>
left the comfort of the developmentally delayed program. By last Christmas I<br/>
was ready to <br/>
pull my poor, stressed out children OUT of school.  We left them in til the<br/>
end of the year. <br/>
Bre&#39;s psych is generally against homeschooling for someone as severe as she<br/>
is, but finally <br/>
agreed it was that or medicating her. What a fool I was for thinking the<br/>
schools are trained <br/>
for this. In some places maybe, but not here. <br/>
<br/>
My plan was to just spend a year getting to know my kids, and practice being<br/>
a family. Bre <br/>
needs a schedule, so it was easy to kind of follow the preschool schedule<br/>

did a lot of <br/>
just growing from one topic to the next, depending on their interests. Josh<br/>
and Emily love <br/>

Rachel loves to <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would like to unschool. I would like a lot of support to unschool.<br/>
I think because <br/>
of my thinking, it will be hard for me. there is a lot of the pressure that<br/>
Sandra mentioned <br/>
earlier in the &#39;filter&#39; of others. It&#39;s very hard for me to face other<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832181012">Hi Christy,<br/>
  As far as answering those who ask how many hours a day do you study you can reasonably say we study all day...cause at this age the kids are learning all the time.  We listen to classical, we draw, color, play games...of course they have plenty of time to play, but my 6 yog is often found of her own volition copying, writing numbers, we are finishing Peter Pan (the real one) and about to start the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe...I mean truly the children are constantly engaged in something.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My PS teacher husband asked my daughter one day what I had taught her and  she said &quot;I teach myself&quot; and we had a long discussion on motivation and he had to agree that the optimal position to &quot;teach&quot; from was more as a guide to someone who is motivated.<br/>
   <br/>
  As far as what curriculum you can say you are eclectic, or we use the public library.  I personally feel that the term &quot;unschooling&quot; is kinda imflammatory and people just have no concept and jump to the worst conclusions.<br/>
   <br/>
  That said I had a big discussion with my sil tonite on hsing and she is thrilled with her ps and it sounds like they have a good one from what she said but a few of the thoughts I left her with *we just want something different* and *we don&#39;t really need government testing because I already know how she&#39;s doing*  and as a response to her complaint that her 13 yos is getting disrespectful I told her that it sounded like he needed some private time with her and she said she just couldn&#39;t cause there is no time and I told her that that is one of our luxuries *time*<br/>
   <br/>
  Fortunately I had my sis there who used to hs, doesn&#39;t anymore (Don&#39;t know why) but she totally backed me up that the ps kids are bullies and really rotten to anyone who is not up to snuff academically.<br/>
   <br/>
  I have been learning about Thomas Jefferson Education and I&#39;m totally turned on by it to be honest.  They have a lot of fantastic ideas that are totally unschoolish, and yet I am learning how I can inspire my kids to learn...one of their foundation ideas is *inspire, not require*  and also that the leaders of tomorrow are going to have a hard time developing into leaders if they are constantly being directed to do this and that.  Like I said...I am totally jazzed.<br/>
   <br/>
  So that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m stickin&#39; to it.<br/>
   <br/>
