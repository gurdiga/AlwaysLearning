<div id="ygrps-yiv-202886958">Hi Janis<br/>
Maybe you could contact you local psychiatric services or equivalent. He<br/>
does sound like he needs some sort of help. It would freak me out if some<br/>
guy I didn&#39;t know wanted to fiddle with my hair! It sounds as if you have a<br/>
tricky situation on your hands.<br/>
<br/>
My only other suggestions - does he have relatives anywhere you could<br/>
contact? Or maybe emailing Tony Attwood - I believe he&#39;s in Australia but<br/>
may have some suggestions. Believe me I&#39;m no expert - we have had one Dr say<br/>
&quot;Asperger Syndrome&quot; and a psychologist say &quot;Doesn&#39;t fit the criteria closely<br/>
enough for it to be Asperger Syndrome&quot; so the jury is still out so to speak.<br/>
It&#39;s from the reading I have done that I get many &#39;Aha&#39;s!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t be more help. There are so many disorders out there that are<br/>
so similar it can be hard to know sometimes - and they&#39;re only a label. From<br/>
my reading most Aspies are just a bit odd or eccentric by their mid to late<br/>
20&#39;s or early 30&#39;s. A lot of them function really well - maybe your<br/>
nieghbours is also a low intelligence thing as well. How does he do in his<br/>
job? Is he like this with his co workers?<br/>
<br/>
Regards, Alison</div>
