<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050548423"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Great point. And it gives me a glimmer of understanding as to why some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people get upset if the sentence is altered to &quot;I have no problem with<br/>
you doing that, but just don&#39;t call yourself an unschooler.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Like I said earlier, I&#39;d have no problem with someone saying that THAT <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like homeschooling to me. I mean - if someone tells me they&#39;ve <br/>
signed their kid up for a public school program and they have a teacher who <br/>
gives them all their assignments and they go TO the learning center every day <br/>
for classes and their teacher grades them and tests them....&quot; then I&#39;d have <br/>
no problem saying &quot;Doesn&#39;t sound like homeschooling to me.&quot; That is based on <br/>
what that person is REALLY doing, not just on their legal status.<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem with saying that people aren&#39;t real homeschoolers just <br/>
because they&#39;re in a public school program (AEP) REGARDLESS of what they <br/>
really do. My problem is letting the government define who is a homeschooler <br/>
and who isn&#39;t. I&#39;m not claiming that everybody is homeschooling regardless of <br/>
what they really DO.<br/>
