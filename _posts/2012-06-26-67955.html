<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692564180">This is a hot topic for me personally.  I&#39;ve done hours and hours of<br/>
research on this in the past.<br/>
The conclusion I came to was that parents could avoid ALL of it if they<br/>
took even a moment and did some critical thinking and analysis of their<br/>
own personal dynamic they have with their kids.<br/>
It is incredibly common to find problems with kids and teens.  It&#39;s also<br/>
incredibly disheartening when I see it and hear it and read about it. <br/>
If a parent can really see what the problem is and recognize that it is<br/>
generally their own perception that even makes it a problem to begin<br/>
with, they will be one step closer to making better parenting choices.<br/>
Kids react to their environment.  Sometimes their reactions aren&#39;t<br/>
great, sometimes they are terrible and have terrible consequences, like<br/>
running away from home, or over using drugs or alcohol.  The fact that<br/>
they are reacting to their environment says everything that needs to be<br/>
said.  It is up to the parents to change that environment whether their<br/>
kids are in school or out.  It isn&#39;t up to the kids to change their<br/>
reactions to their environment, unless of course you want kids to put up<br/>
and shut up in life.<br/>
I don&#39;t know many parents who want their kids to mindlessly follow<br/>
orders.  Most parents, even the ones who expect this of their own kids<br/>
in regards to their own rules, admittedly don&#39;t want that for their<br/>
kids.  They simply don&#39;t see themselves as training their kids to do<br/>
just exactly that.  If you&#39;ve intentionally or unintentionally created<br/>
an environment that makes your kids miserable, do you really want them<br/>
to simply adjust with that and accept it?<br/>
I know I don&#39;t want that for my kids.  I don&#39;t want my kids to EVER be<br/>
in a situation that makes them miserable and uncomfortable and not see a<br/>
way out.  Parents are the most influential part of a kids life.  If<br/>
parents enforce this of their kids, the kids will accept it as normal. <br/>
If parents allow kids to have hundreds of choices and work really hard<br/>
at creating a life for their children in which kids can safely express<br/>
their likes and dislikes and truly have a choice, they won&#39;t be nearly<br/>
as accepting of things that make them terribly unhappy.<br/>
How does any of this relate to video games?<br/>
Here&#39;s an excerpt from that health group:<br/>
****************************************Top 5 Signs You Need Help With<br/>
Gaming or Internet Addiction<br/>
Do you or someone you know spend too much time playing video or computer<br/>
games or going online? Here are some ways to tell if you need to ask for<br/>
help:<br/>
<br/>
    1. You feel really happy when you&#39;re online or when you&#39;re playing<br/>
games, but as soon as you have to stop, you get angry or upset.<br/>
    2. You think about going online or playing when you are supposed to<br/>
be focusing on other things, like doing school work or having dinner<br/>
with your family.<br/>
    3. You spend more time with your keyboard or controller than<br/>
physically hanging out with your friends.<br/>
    4. Your friends or parents ask what you spend all your time doing,<br/>
and you lie about it or laugh it off, but inside you know they may have<br/>
a point.<br/>
    5. You get up in the middle of the night to check your e-mail or your<br/>
MySpace comments because you&#39;re having a hard time sleeping.<br/>
*************************************<br/>
I don&#39;t know how other people feel, but if I&#39;m happily playing a game or<br/>
happily online doing something I see as important and awesome, &quot;yes&quot;, I<br/>
do feel upset if I&#39;m pulled away from that.  Since I have kids, I do get<br/>
pulled away and I&#39;ve learned how to do that happily and I&#39;ve learned how<br/>
to make my time online not interfere with their time needed of me.<br/>
Sometimes I think about being online or playing when I&#39;m supposed to be<br/>
doing other things, but you know what, it&#39;s normal to think about doing<br/>
other things if you are engaged in something you don&#39;t necessarily want<br/>
to do.  I can see how school work would fall into that category.<br/>
Spending more time with keyboards and controllers over friends.  Well,<br/>
this is incredibly outdated!  One can truly have both at the same time.<br/>
If someone were constantly measuring my time and then judging whether or<br/>
not my activities were worthy ones, I&#39;d likely hide my activities too. <br/>
That&#39;s a normal human reaction to being measured and judged by others<br/>
when what they are measuring and judging is something the one doing that<br/>
measuring and judging has decided is negative and unworthy.<br/>
Also, yes, if I&#39;m having a hard time sleeping, then I will definitely do<br/>
something other than just lie there!<br/>
The &quot;signs&quot; of addiction are only signs of addiction in that someone has<br/>
deemed the activity negative and unworthy.  Would someone say these<br/>
things of another if it applied to sports or music or art or science?<br/>
I want my kids to know without any doubts, that I will support their<br/>
passions.  It took me a while to really understand my older daughter&#39;s<br/>
love of horror and gory things, but when I could find a way to at the<br/>
very least revel in her joy of it, everything in our life was just that<br/>
much better.<br/>
One time Schuyler gave a talk on TV at an unschooling conference.  A mom<br/>
stood up at the end, during the question and answer part, and said flat<br/>
out that she could NEVER support her son watching horror movies because<br/>
she didn&#39;t like them.  I thought how sad that was, how much that mom was<br/>
going to miss out of something really fascinating because she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to support her kid in something he loved simply because she didn&#39;t.<br/>
One of the very best things about unschooling is how it has opened up my<br/>
world, how many things I have learned because of my kids, things I would<br/>
never have learned about otherwise.  As unschooling parents we can shut<br/>
a kids world just a tiny bit or we can open it up.  We can fear<br/>
addiction and millions of other things, or we can let that go and really<br/>
see the beauty in what our kids love.<br/>
My oldest daughter is 18 and I&#39;ve seen many different styles of<br/>
parenting.  Without a doubt, the ones who supported their kids, are the<br/>
ones who still have decent relationships with their kids.  The ones who<br/>
didn&#39;t, the outcomes have been horrendous, lots of damaged kids growing<br/>
straight into adulthood with wounded souls, unable to eliminate their<br/>
baggage and it had everything to do with how their parents didn&#39;t honor<br/>
those kids.  I know I&#39;ve shared this before, but I&#39;ll say it again. <br/>
This is from my dad.... In any given moment you can either bless or<br/>
curse your children but you can&#39;t do both at the same time.<br/>
Giving your kids the ability to enjoy their passions, whatever they may<br/>
be, is a blessing.  Denying them is a little curse.<br/>

<br/>
But there are environmental realities, and parents can help kids be happy with what they have to work with.<br/>
<br/>
If parents become their children&#39;s partners, changing the environment and helping the kids have a realistic and peaceful perspective is part of creating a happy situation.<br/>
<br/>
This, though, is spot on:  <br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is about creating an environment in which natural learning can flourish.  (I said that once in Arizona and Roxana Sorooshian wrote it down  and showed it to me, and I&#39;ve used it ever since. :-)<br/>
<br/>
A parent can&#39;t expect to get the kinds of relationships those of us with older kids have without changing the environment (physical and emotional) in which they live when they&#39;re younger, and throughout.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen some unschoolers not do a great job, but it&#39;s from being illogical or inattentive, of from there being a lot of negativity in the situation and the kids picking that up.<br/>
<br/>
Negativity is crippling to curiosity, wonder and joy.<br/>
