Japanese Cartoon<br/>
Strongbad answers the question<br/>
&quot;What would you look like as a Japanese cartoon and what would it be  <br/>
about?&quot;  This is art about art.  These are cartoons about cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I added those last two sentences this morning to the page on art<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/arts">http://sandradodd.com/arts</a><br/>
<br/>
And after I wrote it I realized that last night when Holly and I got  <br/>
back from having seen Lady in the Water, I told Kirby and Marty &quot;It&#39;s  <br/>
a fairy tale about fairy tales. It&#39;s a movie about movies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess that idea was still in my head when I wrote &quot;This is art  <br/>
about art.  These are cartoons about cartoons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So there are probably lots of other such things, like paintings about  <br/>
paintings (There&#39;s a Norman Rockwell of him doing a self-portrait,  <br/>
looking in a mirror. I should put that in my mirror art collection,  <br/>
now that I think of it.) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/mirrrors">http://sandradodd.com/mirrrors</a><br/>
<br/>
There are songs about songs.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of a few plays about plays, but I know them as movies of  <br/>
plays about plays.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fun idea and I just love fun ideas that can turn into years- <br/>
long scavenger hunts.<br/>
