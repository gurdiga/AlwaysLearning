<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138540056">Thank you, Kelly, for asking about grok and thank you Karen for <br/>
answering.  I thought it was one of those LOL type of things.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...just wanted to share a really fun thing that happened last <br/>
night.  My two older girls, Aislinn, 7, and Elysia, 5, have been staying <br/>
up with me for the last 3 nights until about 12:30.  The first two <br/>
nights we looked at &quot;reborn&quot; babies online (check them out, they&#39;re <br/>
amazing!).  Last night was different.  We have a library room in our <br/>
house with a built-in bookshelf that&#39;s about 9&#39; high x 13&#39; wide thats <br/>
overflowing with books.  But off on it&#39;s own is a little antique <br/>
bookshelf with glass doors.  It too is full of books, but antique books. <br/>
 For the first time last night, Aislinn asked me about those books.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the books belonged to my greatgrandfather.  About 25 are my <br/>
greatgrandmother&#39;s diaries. Some belonged to other passed away family <br/>
members.  Some I just bought at yard sales because they were beautiful.  <br/>
<br/>
So the girls asked if we could get a few out.  The first one they picked <br/>
was a monsterous old bible. As soon as we opened it we made a fabulous <br/>
discovery...a letter to my great grandfather mailed on Oct. 4, 1945 from <br/>
Ontario, Canada...and it&#39;s never been opened.  We were so excited.  The <br/>
girls didn&#39;t want to open it.  They have a thing about suspending the <br/>
magic and mystery as long as possible.  So I asked them how they would <br/>
feel if we let my Oma (Grandmother) open it.  The letter is addressed to <br/>
her fil.  So now we can&#39;t wait until she comes over today to show her <br/>
the letter.<br/>
<br/>
After that, we picked a book at random from among the diaries.  The <br/>
small autograph album I pulled out was gifted to my ggm on March 18,1893 <br/>
as a going-away present from her friends as she was moving from <br/>
Plymouth, Kansas to Kenmore, NY where she met and married my ggf (to <br/>
whom the letter is addressed).  She had traveled to Kansas with her <br/>
family in a wagon train.  The girls and I were moved to tears as we read <br/>
the wonderful little good-bye poems that people wrote.  Ex: the first <br/>
one...Dear Mary, Friends must part, Strangers meet, Ties be broken once <br/>
so sweet.  This world must change and be anew, And you and I must bid <br/>
adeiu.  Forget-me-not.  From your friend, Lizzie Beiyliff.  Each person <br/>
had a different poem and they are all so sweet.  They skipped pages and <br/>
then later on others wrote in it too including my gf, her adopted son, <br/>
wrote on Dec 21., 1921: &quot;To Mother, Remember me when this you see.  The <br/>
 many miles apart we be.  Your loving son, Kenneth.&quot;  He was 10 years <br/>
old when he wrote that to her.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long.  It was just a kind of magical night filled with <br/>
friendly ghosts and talk of times gone by.  Then we went to sleep <br/>
together on our screened-in porch where we continued to<br/>
talk about all sorts of meaningful stuff.  Wow...what a great night.<br/>

Is it possible there was enough glue left and humidity over the past 50 years <br/>
that it resealed itself?  <br/>

I have envelopes reseal themselves sometimes even in New Mexico sometimes.<br/>

is.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At one time (as late as the early &#39;60s since I remember it) it was cheaper<br/>
to mail unsealed letters than sealed ones. So it&#39;s possible it had been<br/>
delivered unsealed and then sealed itself over the years.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to find out why there was a discount but couldn&#39;t. But here&#39;s a few<br/>
of interesting things I ran across, how Rural Free Delivery was responsible<br/>
for improving roads, missle mail and a still running mule mail delivery and<br/>
things you can&#39;t send to other countries. Some odd things showed up in a<br/>
number of country&#39;s lists like prison-made items, shoes and playing cards.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.usps.com/history/history/his1.htm">http://www.usps.com/history/history/his1.htm</a><br/>
Rural Free Delivery<br/>
 <br/>
Today it is difficult to envision the isolation that was the lot of farm<br/>
families in early America. In the days before telephones, radios, or<br/>
televisions were common, the farmer&#39;s main links to the outside world were<br/>
the mail and the newspapers that came by mail to the nearest post office.<br/>
Since the mail had to be picked up, this meant a trip to the post office,<br/>
often involving a day&#39;s travel, round-trip. The farmer might delay picking<br/>
up mail for days, weeks, or even months until the trip could be coupled with<br/>
one for supplies, food, or equipment.<br/>
<br/>
John Wanamaker of Pennsylvania was the first Postmaster General to advocate<br/>
rural free delivery (RFD). Although funds were appropriated a month before<br/>
he left office in 1893, subsequent Postmasters General dragged their feet on<br/>
inaugurating the new service so that it was 1896 before the first<br/>
experimental rural delivery routes began in West Virginia, with carriers<br/>
working out of post offices in Charlestown, Halltown, and Uvilla.<br/>
<br/>
Many transportation events in postal history were marked by great<br/>
demonstrations: the Pony Express, for example, and scheduled airmail service<br/>
in 1918. The West Virginia experiment with rural free delivery, however, was<br/>
launched in relative obscurity and in an atmosphere of hostility. Critics of<br/>
the plan claimed it was impracticaland too expensive to have a postal<br/>
carrier trudge over rutted roads and through forests trying to deliver mail<br/>
in all kinds of weather.<br/>
<br/>
However, the farmers, without exception, were delighted with the new service<br/>
and the new world open to them. After receiving free delivery for a few<br/>
months, one observed that it would take away part of life to give it up. A<br/>
Missouri farmer looked back on his life and calculated that, in 15 years, he<br/>
had traveled 12,000 miles going to and from his post office to get the mail.<br/>
<br/>
A byproduct of rural free delivery was the stimulation it provided to the<br/>
development of the great American system of roads and highways. A<br/>
prerequisite for rural delivery was good roads. After hundreds of petitions<br/>
for rural delivery were turned down by the Post Office because of<br/>
unserviceable and inaccessible roads, responsible local governments began to<br/>
extend and improve existing highways. Between 1897 and 1908, these local<br/>
governments spent an estimated $72 million on bridges, culverts, and other<br/>
improvements. In one county in Indiana, farmers themselves paid over $2,600<br/>
to grade and gravel a road in order to qualify for RFD.<br/>
<br/>
The impact of RFD as a cultural and social agent for millions of Americans<br/>
was even more striking, and, in this respect, rural delivery still is a<br/>
vital link between industrial and rural America.<br/>
<br/>
Missile Mail <br/>
<br/>
Throughout its history, the Postal Service enthusiastically has explored<br/>
faster, more efficient forms of mail transportation. Technologies now<br/>
commonplace -- railroads, automobiles, and airplanes -- were embraced by the<br/>
Post Office Department at their radical birth, when they were considered<br/>
new-fangled, unworkable contraptions by many.<br/>
<br/>
One such technology, however, remains only a footnote in the history of mail<br/>
delivery. On June 8, 1959, in a move a postal official heralded as &quot;of<br/>
historic significance to the peoples of the entire world,&quot; the Navy<br/>
submarine U.S.S. Barbero fired a guided missile carrying 3,000 letters at<br/>
the Naval Auxiliary Air Station in Mayport, Florida. &quot;Before man reaches the<br/>
moon,&quot; the official was quoted as saying, &quot;mail will be delivered within<br/>
hours from New York to California, to Britain, to India or Australia by<br/>
guided missiles - missile mail.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
History proved differently, but this experiment with missile mail<br/>
exemplifies the pioneering spirit of the Post Office Department when it came<br/>
to developing faster, better ways of moving the mail.<br/>
<br/>
Mule Mail - High Tech, Then Low Trek Descent into Grand Canyon, Mule Mail<br/>
<br/>
 The sign on the only cafe in town reads &quot;No Fries &#39;Til Mail.&quot; Life in the<br/>
community of Supai, Arizona, literally survives on its mail--and eats more<br/>
mail than it reads.<br/>
<br/>
Arguably the most remote mail route in the country, the Supai route is the<br/>
last mule train delivery in the United States. The route brings everything<br/>
from food to furniture to the tiny Havasupai Indian Reservation, consisting<br/>
of 525 tribal members who live deep below the south rim of the Grand Canyon.<br/>
<br/>
The only way in and out of Supai is an eight-mile trail on foot, mule, or<br/>
horseback. The first two miles of the trail consist of a dizzying series of<br/>
switchbacks that careen along the red rock cliffs of the Grand Canyon&#39;s<br/>
shale formation. <br/>
<br/>
Helicopters and air drops are impractical here, so the mule mail train makes<br/>
the three- to five-hour trip five days a week, even through wind and rain.<br/>
During a typical week, more than a ton of mail is sent via the mules, with<br/>
each mule mail animal carrying a cargo of 200 pounds.<br/>

YES!  It was the way people used to send Christmas cards, with the flap just <br/>

I think it was at the time that the law went away, early 60&#39;s?  late 50s? <br/>

Sending a sealed packet was some high-class privilege you paid extra for.<br/>

Some of what&#39;s below is helpful, and some isn&#39;t, but I&#39;ve put both parts <br/>

<br/>
&quot;or a Christmas greeting simply signed and not sealed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mom said that too.  If you wanted to write a letter or note, it had to be <br/>
letter-price, but if you just signed your name you could send them at the <br/>
unsealed rate.  <br/>
<br/>
Before zip codes, if people were sending mail within their own city, they <br/>
didn&#39;t put the city and state, but just put &quot;City&quot; on the third line.  &quot;City&quot; <br/>
mail is mentioned below.  <br/>
<br/>
July 11, 2000<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
    Dear Sir,<br/>
<br/>
The 1¢ rate George Wagner discusses [March Specialist, p. 113] for postcards <br/>
with simple messages on them is merely the 1¢/2 oz. circular third class rate <br/>
that existed from May, 1879 to April 15, 1925, and then became 1 1⁄2¢ per 2 <br/>
oz. until January 1, 1949.  Check Tables on p. 114 of his reference 5 [U.S. <br/>
Domestic Postal Rates, 1872-1999, Revised Second Edition], or p. 111, Figure 22-7 <br/>
for an example. <br/>
<br/>
You could also mail a folder of postcards at the same rates, or a Christmas <br/>
greeting simply signed and not sealed.  The third class mailings of 1925 and on <br/>
were often called Christmas card rates, and eventually displaced the use of <br/>
postcards in favor of the card and envelope combinations. <br/>
<br/>
The disadvantage of using the third class mailings was that they were not <br/>
favorable or returnable without an added fee.  His reference 3 - United States <br/>
Official Postal Guide - is quite helpful on pages 10 and 11 as to details.  The <br/>
Post Office expected such third class mailings to be in groups of 20 <br/>
identical, unsealed copies, but this was not always enforced.  There was no &quot;local&quot; <br/>
rate for such mailings, but unpaid mailings were subject only to dues at a single <br/>
rate, vs. double rates for those out of town. <br/>
<br/>
Mr. Wagner&#39;s Figures 4, 6 and 7 are good examples of third class mailings, <br/>
assuming they were mailing qualifying quantities.  Figure 5 is just a mistake by <br/>
a Post Office dealing with the massive Christmas mailing they had in WW I. <br/>
<br/>
I dislike &quot;nitpicking&quot; an author, but this one suggests a special unlisted <br/>
rate that was only one portion of a long existing rate. <br/>
Warren Bower<br/>
The Author Responds<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the comments by Mr. Bower, and I certainly don&#39;t believe he is <br/>
&quot;nitpicking.&quot;  One of the reasons that I wrote the article was to promote <br/>
discussion on the subject and to try to produce evidence for or against a <br/>
postulated one cent rate for post cards.  In addition to this letter to the Editor, I <br/>
have received several others directly.  It is my intention to summarize their <br/>
discussion points, as well as those from Mr. Bower, in a follow-up article. <br/>
<br/>
Section 33 of the 1918 Postal Guide does list cards as included in articles <br/>
of the third class; but cards are also included in articles of the first <br/>
class.  In Sections 11 to 16 that discuss post cards under first class matter, <br/>
references to post cards that are more properly third class also include the words <br/>
&quot;entirely in print&quot; and do not include exceptions or provisions for manuscript <br/>
inscriptions.  But it is also true that Section 35(b) under third class <br/>
matter describes, as permissible, manuscript dedications or inscriptions of the <br/>
nature described in my article. <br/>
<br/>
The bottom line seems to be that the regulations were not exactly clear; and <br/>
perhaps the Postmaster at Washington, D.C. was trying to simplify it for his <br/>
staff and for the public.  It certainly would have been a welcome financial <br/>
relief to the public to know that they could legally continue to mail greeting <br/>
cards at one cent.  It just appears that almost no one understood it. <br/>
<br/>
I still welcome additional correspondence on this subject. <br/>

though I have lots of memories of my childhood, I doubt I&#39;d have such clear<br/>

<br/>
(The earliest memory I can identify is at 3 1/2, while my mother was in the<br/>
hospital having my sister.  It was 1960 and my father was an engineer so<br/>
liked technology and we had a dishwasher. My grandmother was staying with me<br/>
and I was flabbergasted that she was choosing to do dishes by hand. I tried<br/>
to show her how to turn on the dishwasher but she just didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
taught. ;-)<br/>

else, like sharing a taxi?  Or did you have to pay extra just to keep the <br/>
postman from reading your mail? <br/>
<br/>
There has to be some kind of reasoning behind it, probably based on the way <br/>
people sent messages previously.  I&#39;m trying to imagine what that might be, but <br/>
I&#39;m apparently missing some crucial bit of trivia.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...<br/>

live. Our road is dirt but the main road it comes off of is not, and<br/>
going half a mile down to the road for mail would beat going all the way<br/>
into town.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re eligible for a free PO box in the town where we technically &quot;live&quot;,<br/>
but that&#39;s around 12 miles away, in a direction we rarely drive. There&#39;s<br/>
another town about 6 miles away in the direction we go most often, and we<br/>
pay $20 a year for a box there. We can get our mail anytime but to get<br/>
packages, we have to go in when the post office is open, which is M-F<br/>
7-4, and it&#39;s closed from 12:30 to 1:00 for lunch. The postmaster<br/>
(postmistress) is the onlt person there, unless she&#39;s on vacation and a<br/>
woman from an even smaller town fills in. If we show up early Saturday<br/>
morning while the mail is being put in boxes we can sometimes call<br/>
through the box and ask about packages, and she brings them around, but<br/>
we&#39;re not generally early people.<br/>
<br/>
Fedex, UPS, and all the other carriers do deliver to our house. When I<br/>
order something online, I often run into trouble with the delivery<br/>
address, because the other carriers won&#39;t deliver to our PO Box address,<br/>
and the US postal system won&#39;t deliver to our home address. Some<br/>
companies don&#39;t say which carrier they use - I know amazon uses different<br/>
carriers for different orders - so I&#39;m left leaving long messages in the<br/>
comments sections, whic sometimes don&#39;t seem to get read. My computer has<br/>
been in for service twice while under warranty and both times they&#39;ve<br/>
managed to ship it all the way from Tennessee to California and then<br/>
realize that the address they had was a PO Box - even though they came<br/>
and picked it up at my home address.<br/>

Kind of, I guess.  Even now, second class and fourth class mail aren&#39;t sealed <br/>
totally up, usually.  The purpose for sealing now is to KEEP something from <br/>
accidentally riding along.  I got a gas bill for someone way across the country <br/>
once, stuck in a bulk-mailed newsletter.  Some of that stuff gets just thrown <br/>
away unseen, so that&#39;s where some of the lost mail undoubtedly goes, into the <br/>
trash, unseen, in the wrong state.<br/>
<br/>
Magazines used to be mailed under the assumption they wouldn&#39;t be sealed up, <br/>
but now some come in plastic bags (Nintendo Power does).  So they&#39;re sealed <br/>
but NOT sealed--if they&#39;re in brown paper and sealed (like a clasp envelope) I <br/>
think they have to be first class (or bulk first, which is only a little <br/>
cheaper).<br/>

Can you just put BOTH whenever they ask for an address?  Put the house number <br/>
first and THEN the P.O. Box which might be fine with those companies that say <br/>
&quot;no P.O. Boxes&quot; but the post office works from bottom up, so they see zip <br/>
code first, then state, city, then second (or third) line of the address.  If you <br/>
have all kinds of junk in the first or second line that shouldn&#39;t affect <br/>
their P.O. Box delivery at ALL.<br/>
<br/>
If you put the P.O. Box on the line under your name and further explanation <br/>
in the following line, that will screw up both systems, though.<br/>

wasn&#39;t sealed then it became conventional to consider them as and use the<br/>
rate for &quot;cards&quot;. Apparently the rate for cards was intended for postcards,<br/>
but no one had defined what &quot;card&quot; meant.<br/>
<br/>
On that link I sent before the stories, there was another story about the<br/>
reorganization of the Post Office. It mentioned how disorganized everything<br/>
was because the Postmaster General had no authority to make any decisions or<br/>
change anything. The Post Office wasn&#39;t being run like a business but a<br/>
branch of the government. (It didn&#39;t say, but maybe congress was voting on<br/>
changes?) Rates made no sense based on the cost of delivery and lots of<br/>
other nonsensical stuff. It said that except for zip codes essentially<br/>
everything was handled exactly as it had been 100 years before while having<br/>
to handle a huge overwhelming volume of mail.<br/>
<br/>
So there was a lot of stuff going on that didn&#39;t make any sense. Then there<br/>
was the postal strike in 1970&#39;s and everything was reorganized into the now<br/>
self-supporting business of the US Postal System.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894785430">We use a box at a commercial mail store instead of the<br/>
US post office because we get to use an actual address<br/>
and not a PO Box address. Ours is called The UPS<br/>
Store.  Companies are happy to send packages there and<br/>
we can pick them up when we like..., well, whenever<br/>
they are open.  And their hours are much more generous<br/>
than the US Post Office.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Missouri farmer looked back on his life and calculated that, in 15 <br/>
&gt; years, he<br/>
&gt; had traveled 12,000 miles going to and from his post office to get <br/>
&gt; the mail.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really want to know why we can&#39;t get mail delivery to the farm where we<br/>
live. Our road is dirt but the main road it comes off of is not, and<br/>
going half a mile down to the road for mail would beat going all the way<br/>
into town.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re eligible for a free PO box in the town where we technically &quot;live&quot;,<br/>
but that&#39;s around 12 miles away, in a direction we rarely drive. There&#39;s<br/>
another town about 6 miles away in the direction we go most often, and we<br/>
pay $20 a year for a box there. We can get our mail anytime but to get<br/>
packages, we have to go in when the post office is open, which is M-F<br/>
7-4, and it&#39;s closed from 12:30 to 1:00 for lunch. The postmaster<br/>
(postmistress) is the onlt person there, unless she&#39;s on vacation and a<br/>
woman from an even smaller town fills in. If we show up early Saturday<br/>
morning while the mail is being put in boxes we can sometimes call<br/>
through the box and ask about packages, and she brings them around, but<br/>
we&#39;re not generally early people.<br/>
<br/>
Fedex, UPS, and all the other carriers do deliver to our house. When I<br/>
order something online, I often run into trouble with the delivery<br/>
address, because the other carriers won&#39;t deliver to our PO Box address,<br/>
and the US postal system won&#39;t deliver to our home address. Some<br/>
companies don&#39;t say which carrier they use - I know amazon uses different<br/>
carriers for different orders - so I&#39;m left leaving long messages in the<br/>
comments sections, whic sometimes don&#39;t seem to get read. My computer has<br/>
been in for service twice while under warranty and both times they&#39;ve<br/>
managed to ship it all the way from Tennessee to California and then<br/>
realize that the address they had was a PO Box - even though they came<br/>
and picked it up at my home address.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Or did you have to pay extra just to keep the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a way, yes. I remember my father at the time saying that it so the postal<br/>
officials could check to make sure that you weren&#39;t including anything more<br/>
than a signed card, like a personal letter that requires more postage.<br/>
<br/>
Up until I left the University of North Texas in 1995 all items sent out<br/>
through the school had to be submitted unsealed so they could be checked for<br/>
official state business only. The folks in the mail office sealed and<br/>
affixed postage before sending it off into the world.<br/>
