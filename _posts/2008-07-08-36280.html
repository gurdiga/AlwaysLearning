<div id="ygrps-yiv-360114819">**It&#39;s telling to me that teens in the US can drive a vehicle before they<br/>
can drink alcohol.   Personally, I think teens should have more access to<br/>
everything and more rights and more responsibilities, not less.**<br/>
<br/>
In the US people are allowed to drive, marry, enter into contracts all before <br/>
they are allowed to drink alcohol. <br/>
<br/>
A person can join the military and go to war, be entrusted with weapons and <br/>
the choices of when to kill and when not to kill, and then not be allowed to <br/>
raise a glass to fallen comrades at the local VFW when they return. It&#39;s just <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
By setting up alcohol as the adulthood gate we practically guarantee that <br/>
more teens will have serious alcohol problems.<br/>
