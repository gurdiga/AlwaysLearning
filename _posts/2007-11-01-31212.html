 <br/>
My boys went trick-or-treating with another unschooling friend and I<br/>
noticed that our kids would launch into long conversations with the<br/>
adults giving out candy.  They would tell them about their costumes and<br/>
introduce themselves.  They would linger at each door and just chat<br/>
while the other kids in the neighborhood would zoom up to the door,<br/>
barely utter &quot;thanks&quot; and rush to the next house.  I see this as a<br/>

and store clerks and other parents.  I credit this to the fact that<br/>
they&#39;ve never been trained to view adults as distant authority figures<br/>
at the front of some classroom or that they are not supposed to engage<br/>
with adults other than when they raise their hand to ask a question.  <br/>
 <br/>
I love this about our kids.  The other day we were at our weekly park<br/>
day and my 9 year old was having the greatest conversation with another<br/>
mom about his new Tamagatchi.  She was sharing tricks and ideas about<br/>
her own experiences and generally just enjoying his company,<br/>
enthusiastic about his new passion.  It never occurred to him that this<br/>
was out-of-the-ordinary.  It has just been his experience in life.<br/>
 <br/>
This is the kind of benefit from unschooling that can be taken for<br/>
granted sometimes.  But really, when it comes right down to it, it&#39;s one<br/>
of the greatest and most important reasons why I unschool.  For my<br/>
children to know that their ideas and passions are important and worthy<br/>
- even to an adult - will serve them so much more than if they ever know<br/>
algebra or how to diagram a sentence.  In fact, those things can be<br/>
learned in a relatively short time period.  However, the belief that<br/>
their passions and ideas are insignificant to adults and that they must<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454749637">My 5 year old son would talk to them a bit.  Not huge conversations but he<br/>
would tell them a little about his costume (SWAT team costume) and if they<br/>
had a costume on he would say &quot;nice costume&quot; or if it was a lady giving out<br/>
the candy he would tell them they were pretty.  He&#39;s a charmer.<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old son decided to give out the candy this year.<br/>

was actually interested in the answer and in pursuing the conversation. <br/>
  Up till then, I&#39;d never had a conversation with a teen who didn&#39;t look <br/>

Holly was nearly two, and she and I went to Georgia for an SCA event  <br/>
(Fool&#39;s War).  I was staying with friends of an SCA friend, because  <br/>
they had a bigger house and room for us.  I was apprehensive about  <br/>
staying with strangers.  I was delivered to their house and a boy 11  <br/>
or 12 came out, introduced himself, helped me get my luggage, made  <br/>
eye contact, was wearing jeans that were too short for him, and was  <br/>
of a geeky build and constitution, but was carrying himself as though  <br/>
he were Arnold Schwartzenegger in 1976.<br/>
<br/>
When he was out of earshot, I said to the mom, &quot;You homeschool, right?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
We didn&#39;t actually trick-or-treat. The Marina we live at hosts a big bbq<br/>
party and bonfire, so we went to that. My children were the only children<br/>
there, and I felt kinda weird about that. Like somehow I was stunting them,<br/>
or something.<br/>
<br/>
Then I put away my fears, and started actually watching *my kids*.<br/>
<br/>
Rowan (who is five) appointed himself the Greeter. The pit where the bonfire<br/>
was is down from the parking lot and walkway, so Rowan would see people<br/>
pausing uncertainly at the edge, dash up the stairs, introduce himself, ask<br/>
them if they were hungry, and then direct them to the goodness on the BBQ<br/>
and the potluck table, pointing out his favorites along the way. Then once<br/>
they were talking to an adult, he&#39;d run back up the stairs to watch for more<br/>
people. Once the stream of newcomers died down, he began circulating, making<br/>
sure people had had a chance to throw wood on the fire (he&#39;d gotten the idea<br/>
it was good luck to do so), and just generally exuding hospitality. I was,<br/>
frankly, in awe. I&#39;m not nearly that gregarious, but apparently, he is.<br/>
<br/>
Kestrel (who is two) was all about the food. We&#39;d asked people to bring some<br/>
sort of dessert item to share, above and beyond the bag-o-candy default, and<br/>
they outdid themselves. There were crockpots of chili and bowls of salads<br/>
and chips and breads and cakes and pies and cookies and tarts and just an<br/>
amazing array of &quot;the good stuff&quot;. Kestrel would toddle over, ask for help<br/>
getting a cookie or whatever, take it back to his seat, eat it with intense<br/>
focus, toddle back over, try something new. Sometimes he&#39;d see people reach<br/>
for something, and announce loudly &quot;Oh, that&#39;s yummy! You want that!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Rowan, as we were heading to bed once it was all over, if it was fun<br/>
for him, or if he&#39;d have rather done the dress up, house-to-house thing. He<br/>
smiled, and said, &quot;I had a great time, Mama. I&#39;m very good at parties.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744579104">As we were walking I was talking to the mom&#39;s I was with when we were trick<br/>
or treating.  Mine were the only unschooled kids.  Both of the other girls<br/>
have always gone to public school.(but one is going to be home/un schooled<br/>
soon)  The kids were 10, 11, 12, and 13, and we had a toddler in tow.  The<br/>
girls walked to all the houses and just enjoyed being out.  They didn&#39;t even<br/>
seem to mind waiting till the toddler caught up.  They were in no hurry.  My<br/>
comment was that I remember RUNNING from house to house.  I am not sure what<br/>
is different with these kids.  I do know my kids are drawn to kids with a<br/>
similar personality though.  Hmmm.  Just thinking.<br/>

Wyl, 8, *runs* from house to house, but he runs everywhere. {grin} *At*  each <br/>
house, he does strike up conversations-sometimes moving on and thinking of  <br/>
more to add to the conversation, so he goes back to talk some more! Then he&#39;s  <br/>
off at a full-tilt run again. He used to talk to the kids, too, commenting on  <br/>
their costumes and stuff, but has started holding back on talking to the <br/>
kids...  they look at him like he&#39;s from another planet when he talks to them. I <br/>
don&#39;t  know if they don&#39;t know how to talk to a kid they don&#39;t *know* or if <br/>
they&#39;re not  used to sincere compliments with no agenda or if its something <br/>
else... sad,  though...<br/>

conversation-starter on each shoulder... her pet rats (well, two at a <br/>
time of the five females).  The only kid who squeaked and ran away was <br/>
a teen girl, but she came right back; she said she&#39;d owned a pet rat <br/>
that had died, and Laura&#39;s looked just like it.  Most kids and parents <br/>
enjoyed seeing them.  (Alex wanted to bring his snake out to help with <br/>
candy distribution, but she&#39;d gone to sleep under her water dish.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110968604">Sometimes my kids rushed from house to house very excited, and sometimes<br/>
they went more slowly, but they all chatted with the people at the doors.<br/>
 <br/>
At one point one of my daughters tripped and her cauldron of candy fell and<br/>
candy spilled in the driveway and gutter.  There were two groups of people<br/>
near us.  The group approaching us was headed by a mother and she called out<br/>
&quot;let&#39;s help this girl pick up her candy&quot; (she also said &quot;and I want to see<br/>
it go in her bucket, no one else&#39;s&quot; which was sad) and all of those kids<br/>
took time to help pick up the candy.  I&#39;m sure they would have anyway even<br/>
if she had said nothing, of course.  Another group of kids was behind us<br/>
crossing the street and one guy, who sounded about 13 or so, said &quot;point and<br/>
laugh, point and laugh.&quot;  I was torn between helping my child and going over<br/>
and saying something to them, but I stayed to help her.  The niceness of<br/>
these other kids offset the other guy.  <br/>
