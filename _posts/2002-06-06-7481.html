<br/>
This is a tetanus surveillance report; basically, there were 124 cases in<br/>
the U.S. from 1995-97, only 5% were under 20 years old, probably due to high<br/>
vaccination rates in that age. There were 11% fatalities from the disease,<br/>
which is less than I thought.<br/>
<br/>
This is just FYI; my kids are immunized for tetanus; that&#39;s one I don&#39;t mess<br/>
with. I keep myself immunized as well, because of my profession. My<br/>
grandmother has told me of watching her three year old sister die from<br/>
tetanus after she stepped on a nail. I know that was 90 years ago, and the<br/>
rate has dropped, but it&#39;s still out there. It&#39;s up to you to minimize the<br/>
risk to your son and make the best decision for him. Just don&#39;t let the<br/>
medical establishment run over you!<br/>
