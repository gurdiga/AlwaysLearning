<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388029337">First some background - we live in my mom&#39;s daylight basement.  Our space is the entire downstairs and we share the kitchen.  We moved in last May and will likely be here for about five more years.  Before we moved in there was a discussion about not adding any more pets to her house.<br/>
<br/>
Megan has wanted a dog forever.  Because of our living situation we have had to tell her that a dog is a possibility in the future, but not right now.<br/>
<br/>
Well, on Sunday, my mom changed her mind.  She said a smaller dog would be fine.  She was thinking of something Cocker Spaniel size.  As I check shelters and rescue organizations, I am<br/>
not finding anything in the small size she wanted that is also good<br/>
with small kids and cats.  I am finding some medium sized (under fifty pounds) dogs that<br/>
might work for our family.  There is also a family preference for something larger than a cat.<br/>
<br/>
Her reasoning for not allowing a bigger dog is that they poop and pee in the yard and it ruins the grass.  At one point my family owned a lab (after I had moved out of the house).  No one took the dog for walks and it was left alone in the backyard for 90% of the time.  It was also fed people food, never trained, and bascially not well cared for.  While I know her belief makes sense to her, I think a well trained, well cared for dog would be an exception.<br/>
<br/>
Megan, after being told &quot;no dog&quot;, is beside herself with happiness about getting a dog.  Megan is seven and wants a dog now.  Today.  Right now.  Yesterday, even.  I understand how hard this is for her.  We&#39;ve talked about making sure we get the right dog for our family.  She&#39;s helping me look at dogs on petfinder.com.  We are<br/>
 talking about breeds and sizes and colors.  We stopped at a shelter yesterday and while they didn&#39;t have a dog that would match what we needed, the attendant did bring out a dog that he thought we might like.  It would not have been a good match.  But Megan was hugely upset that we didn&#39;t take the dog home.  Megan didn&#39;t even really like the dog we saw, but she really wants a dog now.  I don&#39;t know how to help her.  We did a visualization exercise about what her perfect dog would be like and that helped.  She&#39;s going to have to meet all the dogs we look at and I know it is going to be really hard on her.  She is getting upset just looking at pictures of dogs and realizing that this dog or that dog won&#39;t work for our family.<br/>
<br/>
We are getting a dog.  There is no question about that.  While Megan is excited, I have to admit I am worried that I am taking on more than I can handle by adding a dog to the family.  Zoe is 2.5, Megan is 7.5, we have a rabbit and cat.  My husband works and goes to school full time.  We take care of my niece on the weekends.  There is alot going on and I&#39;m sure adding one more thing is possible, but I still have concerns.  I know I will be taking on 98% of the work of a new pet.  My husband tells me I over-think things to the point of being paralyzed and he&#39;s mostly right.  My only real experience with dogs is my family&#39;s lab, so I don&#39;t even know how a dog really behaves.<br/>
<br/>
So, in addition to having trouble finding a dog in the pre-approved size, Megan wants a dog now and there is nothing available *right now*.  I need some suggestions on how to make this waiting time easier for Megan.  And helping her if she finds a dog she loves and we aren&#39;t able to get it (either it is adopted while we are deciding or it is too large).<br/>

<br/>
We had absolutely no luck looking for a dog at the humane society or<br/>
shelters.  We looked within an 80 mile radius of our house.  Where we<br/>
live, there was a weight restriction for dogs.  It had to be under 40<br/>
lbs.  That may seem like a big dog, but it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
We encountered the same kind of thing that you have at all the shelters,<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t adopt a small dog out to anyone with young children, and<br/>
Margaux was little at the time.  I know why people give up and go to the<br/>
pet stores, they can get any dog they like there.<br/>
<br/>
We looked for over a month at shelters, and petfinder, then I started<br/>
perusing craigslist.  That is where I found our dog and we got her for<br/>
free, which was good because we had to get her spayed and all that.  She<br/>
was 11 months old when we got her, so still a bit of a puppy, but potty<br/>
trained and trainable for other things still.  In many ways, I think we<br/>
lucked out, but I also think, going through the pet ads on craigslist<br/>
was a way better means of finding what we wanted without all the<br/>

<br/>
I just remember something that Chamille did when we were on our search. <br/>
She was the same way, every dog was hers from the moment we said &quot;hi&quot;. <br/>
There were many heartbreaking moments that happened.  She made herself a<br/>
folder of dogs.  She did this on her own accord, she used a three ring<br/>
binder, and printed out pictures of the dogs that we met, that were on<br/>
petfinder or the humane society and put their names on the pictures and<br/>
put them all in a folder.  I ran across that folder about a month or so<br/>
ago and it made me smile.  I don&#39;t know why she did it, or what her<br/>
reasoning was for doing it, but it helped tremendously to keep on with<br/>
her search for the &quot;right&quot; dog.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009064798">If you went to see the dogs yourself without her first and only took her to<br/>
meet ones that you felt were possibly a good match, it might be easier on<br/>
her emotionally.  I think Craig&#39;s list or a local newspaper might be a good<br/>
way to find a good dog.  Sometimes families just realize they bit off more<br/>
than they could chew and even though the dog might be a nice dog, they may<br/>
still want to re-home him, often for free.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We got a dog last spring and even though I planned to do 95% of the dog<br/>
care, it is still frustrating sometimes when the kids complain about doing<br/>
something for him.  I try to remember that I knew I would do 95% of the care<br/>
but I still get frustrated sometimes.  (And it shows because he gives me 95%<br/>
of his attention) I would really recommend you try to find a mature dog that<br/>
was raised with children which would be easier than all the puppy training.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761754103">Hi I am new to this list but have to say that we have never gone out and<br/>
looked for a dog. Never wanted a dog actually because of our sensitivity to<br/>
flee bites. But we belong to the local freecycle groups on Vancouver Island<br/>
and one year just after we rented some acreage an Akita/Malamute came up for<br/>
adoption on it. It was perfect, we went to look at it and he came home with<br/>
us 3.5 yrs ago, the day before my husband&#39;s birthday and the same breeding<br/>
as his childhood dog. Then this past November (again we weren&#39;t looking) we<br/>
adopted a Shitzu/Boston Terrier from a friend who had 3 puppies left and<br/>
couldn&#39;t sell them. Both were free and neither were being sought out, they<br/>
just happened. I think sometimes we look too hard for things that when given<br/>
a chance what we want, or don&#39;t want, will appear at the right moment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can check the local freecycle groups (not all allow pet adoption)<br/>
and maybe check with friends and neighbours or put up signs. Could be<br/>
someone is looking to adopt out their pet or puppy and your ad will bring<br/>
the right one to you.<br/>

There is good reason that shelters and rescues (and many breeders)<br/>

You have a very full life!  A dog is a big commitment.  Dogs need<br/>
training, exercise, proper socialization at specific stages of their<br/>
development, grooming, vet care, proper nutrition, etc., etc.  I do <br/>
not think you are over-thinking this; in fact, it is wise to go slowly.  <br/>
Many people think of a dog as a &quot;thing&quot; but it is a living being, with<br/>
a 10-15 year life span, and definite needs of its own.  <br/>
<br/>
Considerations before you get a dog:<br/>

<br/>
How a real dog behaves depends upon its background<br/>
(both genetic and social) and how it is treated (trained, socialized,<br/>
exercised, etc.).  If you don&#39;t know how a dog really behaves,<br/>
that is another reason to take this slowly and not rush into<br/>
a commitment you are not necessarily really and truly ready<br/>
to make.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I need some suggestions on how to make this waiting time easier <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or, to phrase it in a more general way, how can we support our<br/>
children when they face disappointments?  Surely there are<br/>
folks on this list who have lots of thoughtful ideas on how<br/>
to help children cope with disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
What have you done to help her through past disappointments,<br/>
and would that work now?<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could be more help regarding the issue of disappointment,<br/>
but you know Megan best.<br/>
<br/>
I would proceed slowly.  Just because grandmother has now<br/>
given approval and even if you have promised Megan you<br/>
will get a dog, you really do need to consider how Megan<br/>
would feel if you got a dog and then found you had to<br/>
give it up because you could not adequately care for it or<br/>
because a safety issue came up between the dog and the<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>

My dog is 14 years old. We got her as an 8 week old puppy when my kids <br/>
were 10, 7, and 4. Golden retriever. She&#39;s as sweet as sweet can be and <br/>
I don&#39;t regret one minute of having her. The children LOVED her and <br/>
she&#39;s part of our family. We&#39;ve never had any problems with her and <br/>
children. She chewed a few things over the years. We never really <br/>
&quot;trained&quot; her, but somehow she learned to &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;stay&quot; just from <br/>
people fooling around with her. She doesn&#39;t bark. She doesn&#39;t whine. She <br/>
has very occasionally dug a hole in a flower bed. She stayed VERY <br/>
puppy-like for a couple of years - lots of energy. But, even so, dogs <br/>
sleep a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
If I had it to do again, I&#39;d get a smaller dog - maybe a 30 poundish <br/>
one. That&#39;s just because it would be more convenient for traveling.  My <br/>
sister has had different smaller dogs - both poodle/something mixes and <br/>
both have been truly awesome dogs with little children.  My other sister <br/>
has two australian shepherds and I wouldn&#39;t recommend them for families <br/>
just because they absolutely need to get out and get a LOT of exercise <br/>
every single day. Smaller dogs can get enough exercise running around <br/>
the house with the kids, so that&#39;s a big plus.<br/>
<br/>
Kids and dogs are great together if you do some good research on which <br/>
breeds are calm and handle being handled well.<br/>

Correct.  But it&#39;s okay for someone to be uncomfortable with my  <br/>
analogies.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty wanted a dog, 11 years or 12 ago, I took him to the city  <br/>
shelter, and then to the other shelter 15 miles away, and then to the  <br/>

could say no to so many dogs who so obviously wanted to go home with us.<br/>

this one.&quot;  I would have taken the first dog that looked at me  <br/>
lovingly.  Marty had other criteria.<br/>

very honest about the fact that she is questioning that.  She also very honestly<br/>
states that she doesn&#39;t know what a normal dog is like, which is one<br/>
reason I suggest slowing down and thinking about this more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but, while I agree it should be <br/>

poke eyes and pull ears and tails and hug tightly and don&#39;t<br/>
realize that this is hurting the dog.  They are just exploring!<br/>
Still, it is very natural for the dog to react by biting the child.  <br/>
This does not mean that the dog is vicious, but it can&#39;t stay, <br/>
&quot;Please stop!&quot; or &quot;Ouch, that hurts!&quot;  The dog can&#39;t push curious<br/>
hands away.  The dog has a growl, which a toddler may well <br/>
not understand means, &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot;  And the dog has teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Once the dog has bitten, finding it a home becomes more difficult. <br/>
It gets labeled &quot;vicious dog.&quot;  I&#39;m speaking from experience.<br/>
<br/>
And while some adults may find giving the dog away easy,<br/>
I think many children would find it a great disappointment<br/>
to have to give up their dog.  As the op is very concerned<br/>
about her DDs sense of disappointment, that is a real<br/>
concern that merits more consideration... IMO.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Our society says that dogs are disposable things,<br/>

&gt; Maybe your society does. I don&#39;t know anybody who would say that.<br/>
<br/>

society&quot; on this list.  Fair enough.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kids and dogs are great together if you do some good research on which <br/>
&gt; breeds are calm and handle being handled well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  Our family, too, has successfully combined toddlers and<br/>
dogs.  And those dogs weren&#39;t calm; they were Border Collies!  I am not saying,<br/>
 &quot;Don&#39;t do this!&quot;  I *am* saying, &quot;Don&#39;t rush into this.&quot;  Megan is in a big hurry, <br/>
but mother should set the pace in this case.  She may very well be doing<br/>
exactly that, but if so, that didn&#39;t come through clearly in the original<br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve given op one idea on how to help Megan deal with disappointment:<br/>
show her fewer dogs.  So that is one thing she can do.  And what else?<br/>
Would spending time with other people&#39;s dogs... dogs that have families...<br/>
where it is clear that Megan is just visiting, not looking for a dog of<br/>
her own to keep... would that help Megan during the wait for the perfect<br/>
dog?  If she wanted to, and the dog&#39;s owners were willing, Megan could<br/>
play with the dogs, pat them, maybe help groom them, maybe help<br/>
feed them, maybe walk them.  Is there a dog in the neighborhood she <br/>
could befriend? Or a local dog park she could visit, one that allows kids <br/>
under 8 to come in?  (Some don&#39;t for the same reasons that many agencies<br/>
won&#39;t adopt dogs out to families with kids under 8.)<br/>
That would give her some opportunity to experience the joys<br/>
of being around dogs, and if there was a very clear understanding that<br/>
these dogs are for making friends with, not for bringing into our own<br/>
family, could Megan enjoy something like that?  It would also give her<br/>
more opportunities to spend time with dogs, and then go home without<br/>
the dogs.  That could be good or bad for Megan.  Her mom would be<br/>
the best judge of that.  <br/>
<br/>
What about reading dog books?  I read a book at Christmastime, _A Dog<br/>
Named Christmas_ by Greg Kincaid.  Kinda saccharine for my taste,<br/>
but, still heartwarming, and on-topic.  It&#39;s about a Vietnam vet who<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to commit to bringing another dog into the family,<br/>
after the painful loss of two dogs, and his conflict with an adult son<br/>
(20 yo son, with Down Syndrome, who wants very much to have a dog.)<br/>
I wonder if Megan would enjoy having her mother read this story to<br/>
her?  My 8 yo&#39;s wouldn&#39;t find the war references and the father&#39;s sadness<br/>
too heavy... but mine are not Megan!  The book has a lot of good<br/>
messages about relationships and overcoming grief and taking a chance,<br/>
even when it feels uncomfortable, on saying &quot;yes.&quot;  It presents the young<br/>
man in a positive light, too; he is the real hero of the story and the father<br/>
is really focused on all the wonderful things that the young man can do,<br/>
rather than being focused on his &quot;disability.&quot;  And, of course, the young<br/>
man does convince his father (and many others in their community) to get<br/>
a dog, and all works out happily. So, that might be a good read, if Megan <br/>
likes being read to, or perhaps others could suggest books with a similar <br/>
theme:  child wants dog and is disappointed at having to wait to see that happen?<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Some more thoughts on books... if books will help.<br/>
<br/>
_The Stray Dog_ is a nice picture book, (and a true story!), about a family<br/>
that finds the perfect dog when they aren&#39;t looking for it.<br/>
<br/>
_A Dog on Barkham Street_ is about two boys, one boy who loses his dog<br/>
because his parents expect him to take care of it, and he doesn&#39;t, &#39;cause he&#39;s <br/>
just a kid and not ready for that responsibility, and one boy who gains a dog<br/>
but loses an uncle.  The boy&#39;s feelings of disappointment, and yes, shame, come<br/>
through.  We read it here and it led to interesting observations from my kids on <br/>
how those boys&#39; parents had a very different relationship with him (and his sister, <br/>
and each other) than the relationships we have in our family.  It is told from the<br/>
POV of the boy who gets to keep the perfect dog, but has to lose an uncle in<br/>
the process.<br/>
<br/>
 _The Bully of Barkham Street_ tells the same story from the other boy&#39;s POV.<br/>
Warning:  One of these books includes a scene in which some boys get<br/>
accidentally locked in a boxcar, and there is some hinting at the fact that<br/>
it was lucky that they were found before they died in there.  Might be<br/>
disturbing for a 7 yo! <br/>
<br/>
I *loved* anything by James Herriot when I was Megan&#39;s age.  I read<br/>
those books voraciously as a girl, even though I already had a dog and two<br/>
cats.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74810530">I think that unless we pick the first dog we meet, there will be lots of little heartbreaks for her.<br/>
<br/>
The right dog for her is the first one that says &quot;hi&quot; too.  She also wants a dog that will play fetch and can maybe be taught some tricks *and* likes to snuggle with her.<br/>
<br/>
The right dog for our family is one to five years old, housebroken, leash trained, and under fifty pounds.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about it tonight and she asked that I look at the dogs on petfinder.com and only show her the ones that might work for us.  She said it was too frustrating seeing all those other dogs.<br/>
<br/>
She did pull out her dog breed book and look at that for awhile tonight.  Most of the dogs we are looking at are mixed breed, so she wanted to compare sizes and colors of the different mixes.  Mixed breeds are one of those things that really spark her interest.  It is one of the things that bleed over into Pokemon too!  <br/>

I just remember something that Chamille did when we were on our search. <br/>
She was the same way, every dog was hers from the moment we said<br/>
&quot;hi&quot;. <br/>
There were many heartbreaking moments that happened.  She made herself a<br/>
folder of dogs.  She did this on her own accord, she used a three ring<br/>
binder, and printed out pictures of the dogs that we met, that were on<br/>
petfinder or the humane society and put their names on the pictures and<br/>
put them all in a folder.  I ran across that folder about a month or so<br/>
ago and it made me smile.  I don&#39;t know why she did it, or what her<br/>
reasoning was for doing it, but it helped tremendously to keep on with<br/>
her search for the &quot;right&quot; dog.<br/>

Leaving Megan behind isn&#39;t an option.  We don&#39;t have someone to watch her and she really does want to meet each dog.  The biggest consideration is how she and the dog interact, so leaving her behind doesn&#39;t make sense in this case.<br/>

If you went to see the dogs yourself without her first and only took her to<br/>
meet ones that you felt were possibly a good match, it might be easier on<br/>
her emotionally.  I think Craig&#39;s list or a local newspaper might be a good<br/>
way to find a good dog.  Sometimes families just realize they bit off more<br/>
than they could chew and even though the dog might be a nice dog, they may<br/>
still want to re-home him, often for free.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We got a dog last spring and even though I planned to do 95% of the dog<br/>
care, it is still frustrating sometimes when the kids complain about doing<br/>
something for him.  I try to remember that I knew I would do 95% of the care<br/>
but I still get frustrated sometimes.  (And it shows because he gives me 95%<br/>
of his attention) I would really recommend you try to find a mature dog that<br/>
was raised with children which would be easier than all the puppy training.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if Megan is dealing with disappointment exactly.  Maybe impatience.  I imagine it feels like Christmas, but with no way to count down the exact date.  If I could say in &quot;x&quot; number of days we&#39;ll have a dog, I know it would be easier for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753469909">Hi Gwen.  I don&#39;t have any answers on how to help Megan to wait -- but I wanted to share our experience in owning dogs.<br/>
<br/>
First to say, we are CAT people, I am not a DOG person.  So, we started with one of those little hot-dog dogs, a miniature one (I can&#39;t remember their official name), but anyway, it was a pure-bred, and to me, seemed brain-dead.  He was hyper as he could be, and we had no success in training him.  After I&#39;d take him out to pee, or for a walk, he&#39;d come right back in and pee on the bed.  And by walk, I mean ME carrying him because he refused to walk!  We found him a nice new home.  At the time, my oldest was a toddler, and Penny, the dog, would jump up in his face and scratch him a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Next we tried a lab mix from the shelter.  Mistake for us.  When I would go outside to feed him, he&#39;d flatten me on the ground, standing on me, licking my face (like Dino in Flintstone&#39;s!).  He was a very happy, well-meaning dog, just too, too hyper.  I took him to dog obedience school for a month, but to no avail.  We found him a nice new home.<br/>
<br/>
The last try was Tasha.  She was a golden retriever/chow mix.  Another big mistake.  That dog never stopped barking.  She was very sweet and very hyper also.  My niece took her for us after we had Tasha about a year.<br/>
<br/>
IF we try a dog again, we want to get a big, lazy dog, like a St. Bernard.  I&#39;ve read that even though they&#39;re huge, they don&#39;t eat as much as a hyper dog, like a lab, because they&#39;re so sedate.  They just lay around and look cute, and let the children lay on them.  That&#39;s my kind of dog.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know what kind you end up getting.  I&#39;d be interested to hear about it.  Jimi Ann</div>

Do we have the same child?!?!  I&#39;m kidding of course, but having a dog,<br/>
and the right kind of dog, with the right kind of attributes, was very<br/>
much like going Pokemon hunting, looking and looking and finally<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433486726"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe you can check the local freecycle groups (not all allow pet adoption)<br/>

the right one to you. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a cat from freecycle.  It was meant for company for my other<br/>
cat.  Eventually it worked out but it might not have.  I knew some of<br/>
the risks, that the cat might have been ill-treated and not be able to<br/>
overcome some of the conditioning.  I kept in contact with the<br/>
freecycler by email and phone for a while to get information.  The cat<br/>
was not spayed but had all her shots.<br/>
<br/>
The freecycler reluctantly agreed to keep in contact .... which to me<br/>
was a sign that something was wrong.  And there was.  She had had many<br/>
cats and one tom cat she just had neutered had been confined to the<br/>
same small space of the cat she gave me.  Also a toddler who had been<br/>
rough on the cat.  My freecycler lived in a mobile home, and she had<br/>
rescued my cat as a kitten which had been hiding underneath the<br/>
bathtub.  All 5 of the cats she had were in a mobile home and it was<br/>
too many, so they were having lots of behavior problems (peeing and<br/>
spraying).  She insisted on keeping them all indoors even though some<br/>
of them really wanted out.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky to have the history of my cat to help me provide better<br/>
care and know some of the things that she was struggling with.  I knew<br/>
she and my other cat might not end up being friends but took her in<br/>
because I had more space and have had lots of experience with cats<br/>
through the years.  Now that we have so much space and live in the<br/>
country, my two cats are pretty happy and get along well together.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion when dealing with freecycle folks is to keep in contact<br/>
if at all possible. If you haven&#39;t had a lot of experience with your<br/>
type of pet, then I personally don&#39;t recommend freecycle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895581199">When we got ours from freecycle we did keep in contact with the other<br/>
family. Their situation had changed in that they were moving to a different<br/>
province and didn&#39;t have a way to transport him in their small car (he&#39;s a<br/>
61 lb fur ball), with their toddler, and no home for him when they arrived.<br/>
They were very upset to have to leave him but were happy with us, they even<br/>
sent him a Christmas package that first year. We hear from them from time to<br/>
time. Our dog was in a dog run so not free to roam the fenced yard, we kept<br/>
him on a chain for the first few months to get him used to us and our home,<br/>
then started letting him off during the day when we were home and then<br/>
always off unless we were away for a weekend, we lived on an unfenced 20<br/>
acres. We did have to take our children when we went to see him to see if he<br/>
would fit with us. My youngest was afraid of some bigger dogs after being<br/>
constantly (and unintentionally) knocked over by a friends pair of<br/>
Dobermans, they were young and were unaware of their bodies. While Yukon is<br/>
a high energy bouncy type of dog, he settled right down after his first<br/>
bounce around all of us and my youngest loved him.<br/>

I have a cat from freecycle. It was meant for company for my other<br/>
cat. Eventually it worked out but it might not have. I knew some of<br/>
the risks, that the cat might have been ill-treated and not be able to<br/>
overcome some of the conditioning. I kept in contact with the<br/>
freecycler by email and phone for a while to get information. The cat<br/>
was not spayed but had all her shots.<br/>
<br/>
The freecycler reluctantly agreed to keep in contact .... which to me<br/>
was a sign that something was wrong. And there was. She had had many<br/>
cats and one tom cat she just had neutered had been confined to the<br/>
same small space of the cat she gave me. Also a toddler who had been<br/>
rough on the cat. My freecycler lived in a mobile home, and she had<br/>
rescued my cat as a kitten which had been hiding underneath the<br/>
bathtub. All 5 of the cats she had were in a mobile home and it was<br/>
too many, so they were having lots of behavior problems (peeing and<br/>
spraying). She insisted on keeping them all indoors even though some<br/>
of them really wanted out.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky to have the history of my cat to help me provide better<br/>
care and know some of the things that she was struggling with. I knew<br/>
she and my other cat might not end up being friends but took her in<br/>
because I had more space and have had lots of experience with cats<br/>
through the years. Now that we have so much space and live in the<br/>
country, my two cats are pretty happy and get along well together.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion when dealing with freecycle folks is to keep in contact<br/>
if at all possible. If you haven&#39;t had a lot of experience with your<br/>
type of pet, then I personally don&#39;t recommend freecycle.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; constantly (and unintentionally) knocked over by a friends pair of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mom had dobermans in later years that were all rescue dogs, and used to <br/>
have dobies in Australia that were direct from breeders. One was sitting <br/>
outside her front gate in Galveston all beat up just waiting for her to come <br/>
out one morning. The shelter knew to call her when a doby came in which is <br/>
how she got her fourth as a pup (not all 4 at once). Eventually when Mom was <br/>
very ill, my dad found a lovely retired couple, former dog breeders with a <br/>
ranch, to take the old lady and still youngish male. The dogs are/were <br/>
really happy there. But from Mom&#39;s experience of what must be close to a <br/>
dozen different dobies over the course of 30+ years, they are not a breed <br/>
that likes children. Just not, in general. Plus very territorial. Henry <br/>
believed that Mom was alpha dog, but he was absolutely number 2 ahead of my <br/>
dad, Chelsea (dog) and anyone else in the house! He had to be locked out <br/>
when the maid came (she was terrified), and locked in when the pool guy came <br/>
(he was terrified), just because he would bail anyone up against a wall <br/>
until Mom (and only Mom) called him off. This was not a trained behavior; it <br/>
was his territorial personality. When we stayed there with Jayn the dogs <br/>
went into the Kennels.<br/>
<br/>
Poodles - standard and smaller - now they love children. They can be played <br/>
with and are very patient with little ones. My uncle had a standard for a <br/>
long time who was a dear and very cute when his hair was long. My friend&#39;s <br/>
toddler was once saved from falling over a cliff by their standard poodle <br/>
who continually placed himself between the baby and the edge, barking oddly <br/>
until mom came running. They don&#39;t shed at all, and my friend also has a <br/>
bunch of cats in the house with which the poodle got along fine. So a poodle <br/>
or poodle mix might be a good choice for someone where there are concerns <br/>
about mess and relatively small spaces and other pets already.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who knows more about St. Bernard&#39;s might be better to speak up, but <br/>
they are a working dog - they were bred to rescue people lost in the snow - <br/>
so perhaps the lying around personality is a bit of a movie myth?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know... We had an old english sheep dog when I was a kid, very much a herder, but also would seemingly lie for hours totally doing nothing.  That dog, even though you couldn&#39;t see his eyes or wether or not they were open, that would just lay there for hours, ALWAYS knew where the members of the family were.  When we&#39;d go camping, my sister and I would wander far away, and he would always find us, no matter how far we went.</div>

<br/>
And of course they&#39;re massive.  The St Bernard in the Beethoven movies<br/>
is very energetic.  If movies are anything to go by (probably not).<br/>
<br/>
Some collies are great protectors of children.  Not all collies (like<br/>
a border collie I wouldn&#39;t characterize that way).<br/>
<br/>
With any dog, it matters a lot how they&#39;ve been treated, if they&#39;re<br/>
trained or at least very stable, and it helps tremendously to get to<br/>
know dogs yourself.  I was strictly a cat person when I married Brian,<br/>
and he being a dog person and allergic to cats as well, well...  I<br/>
eventually figured out dog language.  It&#39;s very different from the<br/>
body language of cats.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you go with your daughter to be around dogs for the purpose<br/>
of understanding them better, you&#39;ll have a much better chance of<br/>
success with the dog you pick for a pet.  My sister has oodles of big<br/>
dogs and learning what they expect and how they communicate is key to<br/>
getting along with them.<br/>
<br/>
To help your daughter with the wait, you could simply say let&#39;s get to<br/>
know the different kinds of dogs because people who know dogs have<br/>
said that would help us a lot.  Or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to add an animal to your family you want to be as<br/>
considerate of the feelings of this new family member as much as you<br/>
would a person.  (In my opinion.)  And to make a place that welcomes<br/>
the animal and makes that family member comfortable as possible.  It<br/>
*is* going to be a new home after all, and unfamiliar.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been mulling over this aspect of your post--the part about Megan being disappointed.  I have a daughter that I can imagine being very similar in this regard, and I have two things to say.<br/>
<br/>
The first is to set things up in a way that might help Megan with a framework for the dog search, such as, &quot;We are going to look at X amount of dogs before we choose one.&quot;  Or something like that, so that before you even look at the first one there is a deal in place to look at others.  She may still want the first one, but the fallback position is to wait and see the other dogs.<br/>
<br/>
The second is that she may just need to go through this process.  You can only do so much, and should do your part to support her and set things up to her best advantage, but then the rest is her life experience to get.  You can&#39;t, and shouldn&#39;t, imho, protect her from herself to the extent that she doesn&#39;t get to have these experiences.  Some people are more impulsive than others and will learn through life experiences how to manage those emotions.  We all have our own challenges to work out, and this may be a big one for Megan.<br/>
<br/>
I see with my daughter that she is learning all the time how to come up with strategies to deal with that aspect of her nature.  If I tried to shield her from all disappointment she wouldn&#39;t have the perspective that she does.  <br/>
