<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344142468">Hi list!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Bronwen and I just jumped on this list.  I have three children dd<br/>
13, ds 9, ds 16 months.<br/>
<br/>
This discussion of &quot;experience&quot; leads me to ask how you all &quot;fit&quot; in in your<br/>
homeschool group (if you have one).  I am having sort of an uncomfortable<br/>
time.  My son (9) is really enjoying this new homeschooling group I have<br/>
been going to.  The &quot;leader&#39; of the group is an unschooler but has much less<br/>
experience than me (children 7,5yrs) which isnt a problem  (it is fun to<br/>
share my ideas- I love her :-) but recently I have realized that there is<br/>
maybe only one other person who is an unschooler in the group.  I realized<br/>
this because recently there was a secret blow out where my parenting<br/>
(philosophy) came into question (by a woman who has been homeschooling her<br/>
12 year old *one* year) ..ugh..  It was &quot;handled&quot;.  But now I feel<br/>
uncomfortable and a bit defensive..I really am a radical unschooler.  ( I<br/>
have this underlying yearning to &quot;nail&quot; the woman with words..hee hee<br/>
because as you all must know, I&#39;m RIGHT- unschooling rules!, BUT ..i have to<br/>
be diplomatic..)<br/>
<br/>
You know, I am really feeling good about helping others on their journey<br/>
with this- understanding what real freedom means..  but now I am wondering..<br/>
I mean, do you all mix with the &quot;homeschoolers&quot; frequently?-  am I really<br/>
going to be of help there? am I going to get a feeling of community and<br/>
support from a group that generally doesn&#39;t share my philosophy and have<br/>
children younger than mine?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess the bottom line is I will keep going as long as my sons want<br/>
to,  and I really enjoy at least two people in the group, . there are<br/>
definately no other &quot;better&quot; groups.<br/>
<br/>
Any one work on this kind of thing?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Bronwen,<br/>
Kind of the same situation here.  There is a very loose group, kids all<br/>
close to the same age, and all structured homeschoolers.  There are only<br/>
six of us altogether and I am the only unschooler.  <br/>
When they ask specific questions of me, I answer.  In the beginning I<br/>
tried to ease in unschooling philosophies, but I&#39;d get that kind of<br/>
glazed, what planet are you from, look and figured it wasn&#39;t worth the<br/>
effort.  When they talk about Saxon math or History text books I just<br/>
sort of wander off and pinch one of their kids, or something.&lt;G&gt;  Anyway,<br/>
I&#39;ll go as long as my son is finding something he enjoys there.  They&#39;re<br/>
all very nice families and nice kids so it&#39;s not such a problem.  No<br/>
one&#39;s beating me over the head with curriculums.  <br/>

your<br/>
homeschool group (if you have one).   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bronwen - I belong to a big inclusive group. When I joined it was not so big <br/>
and there was maybe one other unschooler. I didn&#39;t say much in the group, but <br/>
once I gave a presentation on unschooling so everyone knew where I was coming <br/>
from. The other unschooler who never talked in the group thanked me <br/>
afterword. Slowly, people would come to me after the meetings and ask <br/>
questions, more questions, call me, more questions. Now the group is huge, <br/>
still most everyone &quot;homeschools&quot; but most folks look at me in an admiring &quot;I <br/>
wish I could do that&quot; way instead of an &quot;I think you&#39;re an idiot&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t talk about unschooling directly unless someone asks. Of course, I am <br/>
the newcomer&#39;s coordinator, so I get asked a lot &lt;gg&gt;. I like to make sure <br/>
that new homeschoolers realize the range of choices they have.<br/>
<br/>
So:<br/>
 ( I<br/>
have this underlying yearning to &quot;nail&quot; the woman with words..hee hee<br/>
because as you all must know, I&#39;m RIGHT- unschooling rules!, BUT ..i have to<br/>

<br/>
Yep, that&#39;s really the best way to promote unschooling, otherwise you can be <br/>
dismissed as a nut.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; am I going to get a feeling of community and<br/>
support from a group that generally doesn&#39;t share my philosophy and have<br/>
children younger than mine?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As long as you can relate to each other on other human levels, I&#39;ve found <br/>
that it is possible.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Most people I talk to say &quot;yeah, it&#39;s a good idea but I could never do it. <br/>
I need my kids to have more structure, to have a classical education, blah, <br/>
blah, blah&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay the first fifty times. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to stay patient when we suffer as much &quot;What, is that legal?&quot; as <br/>
the structured homeschoolers do.  ALL homeschoolers share that &quot;Why aren&#39;t <br/>
you in school?&quot; drill.  And all homeschoolers know that they know both about <br/>
school (and its arguments) AND about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So when an unschooler has to suffer another irritating grilling from the <br/>
other homeschoolers, it&#39;s tempting to say <br/>
&quot;YOU know about school, and I know about school.<br/>
I know about structure, and YOU know about structure.<br/>
But I know about unschooling, and you don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the same people who don&#39;t trust their kids can&#39;t hear about <br/>
unschooling, because they don&#39;t trust.  They have more fear than trust, and <br/>
that fear keeps them from hearing themselves and keeps them from hearing <br/>
peole who do other than confirm their fears.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085214589">Hi Bronwen,<br/>
<br/>
I can understand your feeling uncomfortable in your homeschooling group. I am definitely feeling that way myself at times.<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my boys (9 & 10) for 5 years with this group, going along with all they do. But since September my ideas have changed towards radical unschooling, which I am doing now. There is one person in the group who understands and says she is *mostly* an unschooler, but I can see she does not unschool quite like I do.<br/>
<br/>
I continue to go to the group because of the friends my boys have made with the kids in this group. And I have no problem with the kids, I think they are all very special. But I am longing to meet with other unschoolers who share my (new) philosophy. I&#39;m not having much luck finding anyone. So until I ever do meet other &quot;real&quot; unschoolers, I&#39;m sticking with my original group and finding my unschooling support online.<br/>
<br/>
I also understand about helping others in their journey -- I&#39;ve been much more outspoken recently about unschooling and what it is and why I&#39;m doing it. Most people I talk to say &quot;yeah, it&#39;s a good idea but I could never do it. I need my kids to have more structure, to have a classical education, blah, blah, blah&quot;. I&#39;m feeling more and more isolated in all the curriculum talk and using Saxon and homeschooling &quot;all year long&quot; because they feel so behind in their school work. I tell them &quot;it&#39;s great at our house - it&#39;s like summer vacation every day, all year long&quot; and they look at me like I&#39;m a little crazy!<br/>
<br/>
So, all I can say is I hear you and understand how you&#39;re feeling and I&#39;m jealous you even have some other unschoolers in your group!<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Oh, definitely. We&#39;re in a large-ish inclusive group and go to weekly park<br/>
days and my daughter also does on-again off-again ice skating lessons with<br/>
them, so Wally and I end up talking a lot to the other parents.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been with them for about 18 months now, and we&#39;ve been cheerfully out<br/>
of the closet as radical unschoolers from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing is, they&#39;re good people. They don&#39;t understand us completely<br/>
&lt;g&gt;, but when they talk curriculum we just sit or do something else. When<br/>
they ask unschooling questions (&quot;How will they learn...&quot;) we answer. And we<br/>
talk about a lot of other things.<br/>
<br/>
One of the women is extremely anti-gun, anti-violence, etc. At one of the<br/>
first park days we attended, something came up about one of the women whose<br/>
husband hunts, and I mentioned Wally is a competitive target shooter.<br/>
<br/>
The anti-gun homeschooler and Wally are now good friends. Her husband brings<br/>
packing peanuts home from work by the sackload for us to use for our mail<br/>
order business. Wally went with their family to MacWorld in San Francisco<br/>
this year. We&#39;ve been to their house for dinner and game night.<br/>
<br/>
So, friendships can happen in the unlikeliest places. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I were looking to the park day group for unschooling support, I&#39;m sure<br/>
I&#39;d be wild with frustration, but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re there.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, it&#39;s uncomfortable. Sometimes, one of the parents will say<br/>
something like, &quot;Devin couldn&#39;t come to park day last week because he didn&#39;t<br/>
finish his math.&quot; Sometimes, I want to grab Devin on the spot and adopt him.<br/>
&lt;g&gt; But we get through. The benefits outweigh the cost, at least at this<br/>
stage.<br/>

parenting which gets to me.  It&#39;s the &quot;do this because I&#39;m the mom and<br/>
you&#39;re the kid&quot; which really, really upsets me.  Last time we went one<br/>
of the 3 year olds was using a swing, my daughter was using the other one.<br/>
Two other kids came along including the 3 year old&#39;s older sister.  In<br/>
a matter of minutes the mother made the 3 year old get off the swing;<br/>
then when the child started crying she made some comment of the effect<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t come to me looking for sympathy - it&#39;s your own fault.&quot;  I was<br/>
livid and much too angry to make some constructive comments.  I discussed<br/>
with my daughter that we would be leaving soon so she needed to consider<br/>
what else she wanted to do at the park; the end result was my daughter left<br/>
the swing and went off to do something else and the 3 year old got a swing<br/>
back.  I know that my reaction was in part to the fact that I had coercive<br/>
disrespectful parents and there&#39;s a little girl inside me that got really<br/>
angry about it but could do nothing.  But it&#39;s really, really hard to go<br/>
to the park.  The mother who said that looked to me and another mother<br/>
for sympathy at what an awful child that 3 year old was.  I walked away<br/>
at that point.  To make matters worse this is my daughter&#39;s best friend&#39;s<br/>
mother and she thinks that means we need to be good friends too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; daughter&#39;s best friend&#39;s<br/>
&gt; mother and she thinks that means we need to be good<br/>
&gt; friends too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you could deflect her onto a more gentle,<br/>
loving path with a swift kick to the head? You know,<br/>
just to get her attention. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, perhaps it would be helpfull to the girls if<br/>
you did befriend the Mama as a sort of reflecting<br/>
pool.  It might be possible for her to see herself as<br/>
she is....and to actually modify some her her cruel<br/>
behaviors.  Then your own daughter would have a funner<br/>
place to visit.<br/>

<br/>
In some towns, there are free bulletin boards in veterinary clinics, feed <br/>
stores, health food stores, book stores... (thinking...)  <br/>
<br/>
What about a little ad in the back of the most hippified newspaper in town?<br/>
<br/>
Hanging around parks in the middle of &quot;school days&quot; has sometimes flushed out <br/>
a few other homeschoolers for us.<br/>

day a woman there talked nonstop to her kids, telling<br/>
them how to play and what not to do.  I felt very<br/>
sorry for them and her because she was so stressed<br/>
about how they played.  <br/>
A lot of times, though, I get angry because people<br/>
tell their children, in a loud voice to make sure I<br/>
hear, that they cannot play with my boys because they<br/>
are &quot;wild&quot;.  Those parents also tell my kids what to<br/>
do, which does not bother my kids most of the time. <br/>
Although a few times John has cried about it.  It<br/>
always bothers me though.  How do they think a little<br/>
kid is suppose to play?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would bother me.  I&#39;ve gotten into some pretty intense arguments with<br/>
people who tell my kid what to do. Once she was lifting a (smaller) <br/>
friend up to reach through an open minivan window and unlock the door -<br/>
we were all going somewhere together and they had run ahead of us - and<br/>
the neighbor came out and starting yelling at them not to climb through<br/>
the window... so we walked faster and when we got there I asked Cacie<br/>
what was happening, and the woman broke in and said, &quot;They were trying to<br/>
climb through the window, that&#39;s dangerous, the glass could break&quot; and<br/>
Cacie said, rather hotly &quot;No, we weren&#39;t&quot; and the woman just wheeled on<br/>
her and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you lie to me, I *saw* you!&quot; Man, what a scene. I<br/>
don&#39;t even remember what I said exactly, but I had some pretty strong<br/>
words about calling people liars and minding one&#39;s own business.<br/>
<br/>
And Cacie explained later what had happened, she was kind of scared<br/>
afterwards, a delayed reaction thing... but she really didn&#39;t need to. If<br/>
she said she wasn&#39;t, she wasn&#39;t. I can probably count on the fingers of<br/>
one hand the times she&#39;s lied to me (lies, as opposed to stories) and it<br/>
was always after I&#39;d tried to coerce her around something and set down<br/>
some stupid rule that trapped her in a double-bind.<br/>
<br/>
My friends ended up selling the house and moving, in large part because<br/>
of that neighbor from hell... <br/>
<br/>
But anyway, what is &quot;wild&quot;? Do they respect other people&#39;s feelings and<br/>
belongings and ideas and bodies? Generally, if the kids are happy with<br/>
how the game is going, I am too...<br/>

wild.  They climb up the slide, which really seems to<br/>
bother some people, but they don&#39;t do it when another<br/>
kid is coming down.  They respect other people and<br/>
have never done anyhting to harm another child playing<br/>
at the park.  They are energetic.  Maybe they say it<br/>
because I let my kids play without my constant<br/>
interference.<br/>
