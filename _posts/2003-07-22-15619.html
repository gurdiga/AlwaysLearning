 </span></blockquote>Just a suggestion Joylyn. Tell your dad I&#39;m certainly not saying it is<br/>
better in Tucson right now. ;) <br/>
<br/>
We used to foolishly just take the little un-airconditioned Datsun into<br/>
the back country in the middle of August looking for petroglyphs or<br/>
whatever. Walking around fields of volcanic black rocks. Yeah, that was<br/>
hot.  We&#39;re still foolish since we&#39;ve been ripping down the old walls<br/>
and residing the garage this week and I don&#39;t know how hot it&#39;s been, I<br/>
usually quit counting over 103, it is but it is pretty darn hot and it<br/>
isn&#39;t a dry heat right now.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t go camping in the summertime here. I&#39;m a wuss. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a url for Winslow weather:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s 11:00 PM here, Phoenix is 95 degrees, Tucson is 89, Winslow is 75<br/>
right now (was 79 at 9:00 PM and they had a light rain today) and<br/>
Flagstaff is 70. I don&#39;t know if they are going to let you light a fire<br/>
or not. You might check fire conditions/danger at the place you are<br/>
expecting to camp. <br/>
<br/>
The  Homolovi Ruins sound nice. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen those. <br/>

Idolatry, a Tyrant against Rebellion, or a Lyer against Forgery, and a<br/>
