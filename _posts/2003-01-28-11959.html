<br/>
Do you remember that great smelling shampoo that was available back <br/>
in the 70&#39;s, it was called &quot;Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific!&quot; Well, <br/>
it hasn&#39;t been available for almost 20 years now. But... good <br/>
news! I found out it is available again, but you can only buy it <br/>
online! <br/>
<br/>
You can order Gee at:<br/>

I always laugh when I hear about &quot;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s Butter!&quot; One of <br/>
my sisters made a wedding cake for one of my brothers once (it went on <br/>
for days, first the plain cake sat in the middle of the table, then it <br/>
was partially frosted, then it had the flowers with  &quot;I can&#39;t believe <br/>
it&#39;s butter!&quot; added) It didn&#39;t work right and it sat in the middle of <br/>
the table on a lazy susan looking really strange until one of my other <br/>
sisters scraped off the offending flower decorations that looked a bit <br/>
like mould and put on some fake flowers instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619879495">As you may know, I recently joined the list. I am Homeschooling Brianna,<br/>
aged 10.<br/>
When we first started, I had the idea of a curriculum. However, I soon<br/>
realized that it was not to be. Not for her. Not for me. I didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
shackled to a clock, whether hourly or monthly. I also didn&#39;t want to make<br/>
Brianna study something that she wasn&#39;t interested in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I have a home business. So it was natural that Brianna do her studying in<br/>
my office, (which is really our living room) Brianna has always been very<br/>
involved in the business. We set up at powwows, (Brianna is a Fancy Shawl<br/>
Dancer) feasts (not so many, we prefer powwows) and we go to some &#39;old age&#39;<br/>
homes and set up there. We have a price structure that Brianna & I have<br/>
worked on. For example, we offer Military or Veteran discounts. We offer<br/>
&quot;Golden discounts&quot;, we have a Crones discount, heck we have family<br/>
discounts, well, you get the point. All of these discounts have to be<br/>
figured, written, accounted, Brianna can do that.<br/>
Brianna can pitch a tent, inflate the air mattress, set up our 10&#39;X20&#39; store<br/>
tent (she needs help, but no direction), set out our stock, sell it, make<br/>
change, she&#39;s very good at what she does. She is very involved in theatre<br/>
and has a puppy and takes horseback riding lessons. She likes math and will<br/>
pick up the Addison Wesley Math book for grade 4. She loves science and has<br/>
a number of experiments going on at any given time, many of which are<br/>
forgotten or somehow disappear (maybe they&#39;re living with all that minutiae<br/>
of ours lives that disappear?)<br/>
She&#39;s a very smart girl.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here&#39;s my question; Are we unschooling? Does her use of a textbook<br/>
fall outside of the unschooling parameters? Is there a place/site that will<br/>
tell me more?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know much. I do know that no one can take care of her as I will. No<br/>
one treasures her as I do. I had her in public school. It was not good, not<br/>
good at all. She was finished with her school work by Tuesday and then<br/>
wasted the rest of the week drawing or helping the class bully. He sat in<br/>
her group because of his last name. He is a victim of benign neglect on the<br/>
part of his parents. Long about the last time he hit her, I was informed<br/>
that the school could not do anything about it. There were over riding<br/>
issues that I was not aware of. Well, if they can&#39;t teach her and can&#39;t<br/>
protect her, why is she there?<br/>
So anyway, there you have it.<br/>
<br/>
Are we unschooling?<br/>
Please, are there links that will help clear up this confusion?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Janis<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906807313">Brianna studies what she wants. She sits with me in the office. Lately she&#39;s<br/>
been reading about dogs; training, breeding, feeding, showing. She&#39;s also<br/>
getting ready to perform in the &#39;Vagina Monologues&#39; here in Newport, RI.<br/>
There&#39;s been a part written for a 6 y.o. that Brianna really wants to do.<br/>
She&#39;s also getting ready to audition for a part in Annie, here at Trinity<br/>
Square Rep. She & I are studying audition techniques.<br/>
Brianna is excited about the &#39;Vagina Monologues&#39;. 90% of the money goes to<br/>
fight Domestic Abuse here in RI and 10% is going to the Lakota Woman&#39;s Safe<br/>
House in South Dakota.<br/>
Brianna likes to do math and science. That was one of my fears about PS. I<br/>
knew, from my experience, that once she got to a certain age/grade, she<br/>
would be pushed away from science and math.<br/>
So when she &#39;studies&#39;, she studies what she wants, when she wants, for as<br/>
long as she wants.  There are no tests, except for the tests that life gives<br/>
her. For example, she uses math in our business, and uses it well.<br/>
I must admit, she hates doing laundry, it&#39;s funny how she has to &quot;finish my<br/>
chapter&quot; whenever it&#39;s laundry time!<br/>
I expect Brianna to be the best Brianna she can be!<br/>
Take care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898704524">Welcome.  I think it is very cool that Brianna would performed in the <br/>
Vagina Monologues.  I read the book and miss the performance when they <br/>
came to Ottawa.  I was in the hospital that week.  Hope they come back <br/>
some other year.<br/>

&gt;I think it sounds like you fit quite well with the unschooling philoshophies! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;And I also think Brianna is a lucky girl to have you in her life!      The performance of The Vagina Monologues sounds great,  I had never heard of parts for a kid,  cool! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;It came to our town here,  in northern Minnesota, but I missed it.   I was bummed. <br/>
