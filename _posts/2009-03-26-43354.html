<div id="ygrps-yiv-803400283">Hi, I just read this by sandra:<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think it helps in ALL those cases to think more in terms of clarity,<br/>
understanding and learning than of any larger or secondary words. We<br/>
don&#39;t need &quot;academics&quot;; we need learning. We don&#39;t need &quot;intellect&quot;;<br/>
we need thought and the consideration of ideas.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like that.<br/>
thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know if I told you (all), but I started an italian list for &quot;apprendimento naturale&quot;<br/>
the address is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/apprendimentonaturale/?yguid=286713246">http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/apprendimentonaturale/?yguid=286713246</a><br/>
it is definitely new, but I am finding alot of people interested. <br/>
<br/>
but most people dont read english and I cant decide which article to translate first.<br/>
<br/>
any favorites for absolute newcomers to even the idea of homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
(I had done a few last summer, but the computer &quot;ate&quot; them :-(  )<br/>

thanks, melissa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328556272">Joyce&#39;s page on the philosophy of unschooling, maybe:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s too detailed.  Maybe you could summarize it in simpler  <br/>
Italian and refer people to Joyce&#39;s site if they want the original all- <br/>
embroidered version.     Some of it might not translate to Italy  <br/>
culturally and referentially, either.<br/>
