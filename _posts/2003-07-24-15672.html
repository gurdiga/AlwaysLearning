&lt;&lt;&lt;But IF you can <br/>
JUST ask your questions without saying things that can be seen as<br/>
implying <br/>
that our kids probably aren&#39;t as cool as you want your kid to be &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
again. i&#39;m sorry if you inferred something that was NOT THERE. i am sure<br/>
home/unschooled kids are WAY cooler than most. which is why i&#39;m<br/>
interested. but. i don&#39;t know any (for clarification, that means, i<br/>
don&#39;t know any home/unschooled kids, NOT that i don&#39;t know any who are<br/>
cool). &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Pam,<br/>
<br/>
How old is/are your kid(s)?  Lol.  Sorry, there are just so many people<br/>
on a few lists and I simply can&#39;t keep up with so many.  I can barely<br/>
remember which kids belong to which moms/dads in the group I see in<br/>
person!  Anyway, I was just going to comment on something you said above<br/>
regarding the coolness of kids.  :)  It took me nearly two years, but I<br/>
finally found some folks near me with older kids who do unschool.  These<br/>
are by far the coolest kids I have ever encountered - and my daughter<br/>
(now 13) clicked immediately - finally found &quot;her people&quot; in this group.<br/>
It&#39;s been a long road for us and we still have a way to go (I still feel<br/>
like I&#39;m bouncing about aimlessly sometimes and am not sure what I&#39;m<br/>
doing), but the kids (mine I mean - I also have a 7 year old boy) seem<br/>
to be taking care of it nicely.  I&#39;m still in need of some personal<br/>
de-schooling - years of things to undo. I&#39;m working on it!  Finally,<br/>
these kids we&#39;ve found, as compared to the typically public schooled<br/>
kids who live all around us, are light years ahead in creativity,<br/>
personality, independent thought, social skills with each other and the<br/>
adults, and they&#39;re just plain far more pleasant to be around.  And<br/>
their parents are pretty awesome too!  :)  That&#39;s all, just sharing a<br/>
bit of personal experience with you so as to maybe ease your mind and<br/>
give you info that is not immediately available to you first hand as you<br/>
haven&#39;t yet found &quot;your people.&quot;  <br/>

observe unschoolers in action!<br/>
