&gt;   &gt;In our home now, we have &quot;mom and dad&quot; gifts and &quot;Santa&quot; gifts.  Gifts<br/>
do<br/>
&gt;   &gt;not go under the tree until Christmas Eve.  We celebrate St. Nicholas<br/>
day on<br/>
&gt;   &gt;December 6th(a family/german tradition).  We talk quite a bit about the<br/>
&gt;   &gt;spirit of christmas, the spirit of the Santa figure etc, but Dana has<br/>
yet to<br/>
&gt;   &gt;dive full and ask questions.  I told her that the tooth fairy wasn&#39;t<br/>
real<br/>
&gt;   &gt;and she said, &quot;Mom, you just don&#39;t know about fairies and wishes&quot;.  So,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;   &gt;dropped it - we will cross the Santa/Easter/Fairy bridge when we come<br/>
to it<br/>
&gt;   &gt;next time.<br/>

&gt;   This is how it is at our house, too, except for the St. Nicholas day,<br/>
although we are part german! Santa gives way more gifts than mom and dad.<br/>
&gt;   The tooth fairy is a regular, too, except some nights she is forgetfull<br/>
and the poor kids have to try again the next night! The second try always<br/>
works.<br/>

&gt;   also wishing I had a snappy nickname<br/>
