<br>This makes me think, as we head into Christmas, of the things we&#39;ve spent money on, and what has been worth it, and what hasn&#39;t. 
<br>
<br>Upstairs there are many, many Beanie Babies, at about $5 each. They&#39;re not collectible, because we did the unthinkable and immediately removed the tags so Julian could PLAY with them. And he has, and still sometimes does, even though he&#39;s twelve. (He&#39;s a major animal freak.)
<br>
<br>The Playmobile castle stuff was ridiculously expensive, but again, it was played with so much it was worth it.Over the years we&#39;ve bought other stuff that hardly got used at all, and even if it was cheap, it wasn&#39;t worth it.
<br>
<br>The D&amp;D stuff certainly is, although I often wonder where those dice go...it always seems we&#39;re buying dice....
