Carrey as Count Olaf, and the cast also includes Meryl Streep, Emily<br/>
Browning, Jude Law, Liam Aiken and Jennifer Coolidge, according to one fan<br/>
board. Apparently it&#39;s run into director troubles and the original start<br/>
date of holiday 2003 has been pushed back to at least next summer.<br/>
