&lt;&lt; And here&#39;s a BIG BONUS!!! I didn&#39;t know this until right this minute, but <br/>
both my boys fell on that ramp during the conference.<br/>
They told me just now when my dh asked what I was writing about.<br/>
Jared fell and landed on his back.<br/>
Trevor said he landed on his butt. AND he fell into the door at a later time <br/>
because of all the wetness around the whole area.<br/>
So there&#39;s some witnesses for ya! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH MY!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Just reading that made my stomach jump and then made my leg hurt.<br/>
<br/>
This is really really bad.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times since I&#39;ve been home I&#39;ve thought clearly of that moment <br/>
when I went down and have cried really, really hard.  I SO MUCH was ready to <br/>
kick off that conference and I hadn&#39;t looked forward to anything as much as I <br/>
was that for a long time.<br/>
