<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750718296">and never been wrong!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a smart kid, he knows it. He can&#39;t be wrong, it doesn&#39;t exist in his<br/>
world. It&#39;s not just me, his friends will agree. I wish I could video<br/>
tape his every move and play it back for him so he can see life from a<br/>
different point of view.<br/>
This morning he worked on his bike in the garage, he&#39;s a grease monkey<br/>
and loving it. I heard a bang on the door and figured he wanted in. He<br/>
knows the grease isn&#39;t welcome on the doorknobs or anywhere else for that<br/>
matter. He tries to be compliant. Sometimes. He&#39;s a good kid. I opened<br/>
the door , he asked for me to work the hose so he could rinse off the<br/>
goop he was cleaning his all so blackened hands with. He had found a deep<br/>
root watering thingy in the trash a couple days earlier, it was still<br/>
attached to the hose but he said that would work fine for washing up. I<br/>
turned on the spigot and told him we&#39;d have to move down near the street<br/>
so the chemicals wouldn&#39;t kill my garden, but the thingy must have been<br/>
clogged for no water was coming out. We realized it had to come off the<br/>
hose. DUH! right. I couldn&#39;t find the nozzle and asked him where he put<br/>
it when he removed it to hook up the DRW thingy. Frustrated, he said to<br/>
just pull the hose down towards the street without it. I&#39;m living in<br/>
drought country here, it&#39;s a waste to turn the water on and let it flow<br/>
freely and unused and besides I figured the pressure the nozzle makes<br/>
would work better anyway. I asked again where the nozzle is, he cursed<br/>
and grumbled something about the cleaner and how it was going to eat<br/>
through his skin. I find the nozzle hidden in a plant, put it on the<br/>
hose, turn the spigot back on and head towards him but he was gone. I<br/>
hear the garage door open and shut, he&#39;s in the house washing up. I let<br/>
him know I&#39;d like him to clean off the door knob and put away the hose I<br/>
had just pulled out for him. He grumbled. I was a bitch, why didn&#39;t I<br/>
just rinse his hands off yesterday? He&#39;s so impatient. So am I,<br/>
sometimes, like now. I told him he&#39;s got a bad attitude, I complied with<br/>
his request for help, he couldn&#39;t wait the extra minute for me to locate<br/>
the nozzle, the nozzle he misplaced!( ok, I yelled!) I try to be patient<br/>
but he seems to create small problems, ignore them, let them manifest<br/>
into bigger ones, and then the shit hits the fan. Why must we fight? It<br/>
sucks!<br/>
10 minutes later he comes over calmly to explain why he had to rinse his<br/>
hands off immediately, shows me his dry calloused, well worked hands and<br/>
tells me the goop eats though his skin. I&#39;ve used goop many times, I<br/>
don&#39;t think it eats through your skin, I think the work you do to get<br/>
them so dirty does though. But he&#39;s never wrong.<br/>
He&#39;s gone out to meet up with friends.<br/>
Now I&#39;m afraid to look in the garage cause I have a terrible feeling it&#39;s<br/>
a big mess. That&#39;ll be our next conflict of the day.<br/>
<br/>
How does the saying go?<br/>
A dirty kid is a happy one?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292645519">Hey Sharon,<br/>
Keep the faith! It sounds as if he is developmentally<br/>
normal.. HURRAY HUH...With my two grown sons we went<br/>
through a time that was unbearable. Especially tough<br/>
with my son who thought he knew everything and could<br/>
not be wrong. <br/>
I was a foster parent for years. I helped lots of<br/>
teenage girls and boys have trouble get through that<br/>
tough time, but when my kids went through it all my<br/>
buttons were pushed. My second son could have me<br/>
acting like a maniac in five minutes flat till I<br/>
figured out non confrontational was the way to go with<br/>
him. So what did work was to make sure I took care of<br/>
myself. No one can call me a name and expect my<br/>
cooperation.  Sometimes I would just walk away and<br/>
continue with my life. With son number two I would<br/>
have to wait till the situation settled and then make<br/>
I statements.. Like, &quot;I would really appreciate you<br/>
taking care of your things when you have a chance,<br/>
Thanks a lot bud&quot;. I believe that teenagers have such<br/>
an internal struggle going on that in many ways they<br/>
revert to much younger behavior.  So a once<br/>
responsible kid forgets and is so absorbed in self<br/>
that what seem like normal demands to us become<br/>
overwhelming and irrationally irritating to them. I am<br/>
seeing it now with my daughter.. The only bonus is I<br/>
know they turn back into their best selves again. <br/>
Both sons are some of the finest folks I know.So<br/>
please take my compassion and know that this too will<br/>
pass.<br/>
Kathleen<br/>
very fortunate<br/>
mom of eight<br/>

Have you ever thought cold water would rinse it off?  Or grease?<br/>
<br/>
If it had been your husband or an adult friend who was working on a bike for <br/>
you, wouldn&#39;t you have opened the door for him and get dishwashing liquid or <br/>
something that would take grease off and run him some hot water and find a rag <br/>
you didn&#39;t mind him using and hand it to him?<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but it seems from the account that you were treating him in <br/>
a second-class way from the point you wanted him to use the hose, but were <br/>
grumpy about running cold water during a drought.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But he&#39;s never wrong.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Maybe he was right about thinking he needed hot water and soap to wash his <br/>
hands.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181842954">Oh no, you don&#39;t understand. Goop is hand cleaner. We keep it in the<br/>
garage just for cleaning our hands. He was using it to clean the grease<br/>
off. <br/>
I did open the door when he knocked/banged. I thought I was letting him<br/>
in. I helped him with the hose because that&#39;s what he asked for, but <br/>
when I asked him for help locating the nozzle he didn&#39;t have the patience<br/>
or thought the hand cleaner was damaging his skin so he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
wait or help me locate the nozzle. <br/>
I asked him where the nozzle was because he was the last one who handled<br/>
it. I didn&#39;t see it anywhere near the faucet, that&#39;s were we usually keep<br/>
them when they&#39;re not on the hose. <br/>
It&#39;s not like this was taking forever, this happened within 5 mins. He<br/>
basically stormed off into the house to rinse his hands in the sink.<br/>
He could have done that in the first place. I wouldn&#39;t have had a problem<br/>
with that, well, less the bad attitude.<br/>
I would have opened the door again for him if he said forget it lets just<br/>
go in the house. <br/>
He knows he can use hot water inside but he also knows that his hands<br/>
were super greasy and needed a prewash.<br/>
He decided to use the goop first, and he wanted to wash them off with the<br/>
hose.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t grumpy about using the hose, I would just prefer to have the<br/>
nozzle on so I wouldn&#39;t have to waste the water as I walked down the path<br/>
to the street.<br/>
<br/>
I felt mistreated, like his servant that didn&#39;t help right enough, quick<br/>
enough. I could take back my old job if I wanted to be treated like that.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, I&#39;m never wrong, not him. 8)<br/>

I keep going back to that for strength.<br/>
<br/>
He just came home and is telling me all the messed up stuff his peers are<br/>
into. I love that he talks to me about this stuff. Sometimes life for<br/>
these kids today looks like a nightmare to me. Talk about externally<br/>
motivated internal struggles. I wonder how bad things between us would be<br/>
if we couldn&#39;t  / didn&#39;t talk, but I don&#39;t want to know.<br/>

Raine replies: (((Sharon))) It can be tough when our kids (or anyone) get in these types of funky moods. However, I know I can get a bit &quot;pissy&quot; myself at times. <br/>
I feel for you... it just seems like one of those things that occur with people that we live with, or spend a lot of time with. <br/>
In reading your story, I can see times when I have treated someone else, likely my kids, like you described. I see some work that needs to be done in myself. <br/>
Thank you so much for sharing. I am a better person for having read this thread.<br/>

    I don&#39;t think that was what was meant. Kathleen correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
What I thought she meant was take a time out for yourself. Cool off and<br/>
think about what you want to say instead of speaking in the heat of the<br/>
moment. I know I get all wrapped up in it sometimes when I&#39;m upset with my<br/>

It seems part of the leaving-home package that they start to think parents <br/>

phases we were in yelling matches and power struggle<br/>
frequently. Also I  believe taking care of yourself<br/>
models to them how to do that and not allowing someone<br/>
to cuss you out or verbally abuse you  sets a standard<br/>
of treatment for what  is acceptable. Would you want<br/>
you kids to think it is okay to take it while a spouse<br/>
or boss calls them names? It is not abandonment to set<br/>
a standard of what is acceptable treatment of another<br/>
person, especially persons we love. I am not<br/>
suggesting to hold a grudge, just bottom line when you<br/>
can speak to me like I am a person I am all ears.Allow<br/>
them to find another way of releasing all of the<br/>
frustrations of teenagerness, something productive<br/>
like a walk or a run or a punching bag.<br/>
I really wasn&#39;t trying to offend Sharon and can really<br/>
respect her struggle because I was so unsure if we<br/>
would live through it, or if we would like each other<br/>
at the end.<br/>
I agree totally with Sandra that it is their job to<br/>
break away. Imagine a beautiful sweet smelling cuddly<br/>
infant was ready to leave home .... NOOOOO&gt;&gt;&gt; By the<br/>
time my two boys left I was helping them pack. LOL .<br/>
Really I was sad, but it was time and we both felt it.<br/>
<br/>
I am new here and have enjoyed everyones posts so<br/>
much. I am really at the start of our unschooling<br/>
experience with my six who are home. I have<br/>
homeschooled for the past year. With a flicker of<br/>
unschooling but was freaked out that I would be<br/>
&quot;putting them behind&quot; if I did not follow a<br/>
curriculum, but the more I read the more I am<br/>
convinced that this is the way to go.. <br/>
Have a Great day all.<br/>

&gt; Anyone have a cure for internal struggles?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So a once<br/>

&gt;&gt; that what seem like normal demands to us become<br/>
&gt;&gt; overwhelming and irrationally irritating to them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Exactly! When I ask if he&#39;s done something  even if it&#39;s only once he<br/>

&gt; My MIL told me years ago that everything is only temporary. It&#39;s so true.<br/>
&gt; I keep going back to that for strength.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He just came home and is telling me all the messed up stuff his peers are<br/>
&gt; into. I love that he talks to me about this stuff. Sometimes life for<br/>
&gt; these kids today looks like a nightmare to me. Talk about externally<br/>

I haven&#39;t read it myself, but I&#39;ve read about the studies of teen brains vs.<br/>
adult brains.  A homeschooling friend of mine read the book, and found the<br/>
only flaw was the author doesn&#39;t know about homeschooling; he makes a big<br/>
deal about getting kids to cooperate with school.  Otherwise, it&#39;s<br/>
excellent.  <br/>
<br/>
A teenager&#39;s brain does not function the same as an adults; they think with<br/>
their emotional centers, not their reasoning ones.  You say &quot;please take out<br/>

I agree. <br/>
Now to get him to cooperate with this concept.<br/>
<br/>
This morning he asked for a $100 loan to buy a three wheel ATV from a<br/>
yard sale. He was all excited, it runs and the lady was going to hold it<br/>
for him. I took a ride to the cash machine with him but when he pulled up<br/>
to the yard sale it was gone. The woman said she sold it for $150 after<br/>
he left. Good for her! but It still wasn&#39;t right for her to say she&#39;d<br/>
hold it and then didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
He told her he thought she said she&#39;d hold it , he got the cash, and she<br/>
sucked for selling it, have a nice day , fucking bitch.<br/>
<br/>
I understand he was upset but he didn&#39;t need to speak that way. He&#39;s<br/>
hating all people today, we all suck.<br/>

I want my children to be nice and at the same time want them to be strong<br/>
enough not to take crap from people. The strong part is coming easy.<br/>
I fear we&#39;ll end up hating each other and it&#39;s so stupid cause the power<br/>
struggles are sometimes about things that won&#39;t mean a thing tomorrow.<br/>
BTW my son has a drum set and although it might drive the rest of the<br/>

when he gets angry. He does use them at times to take out his<br/>
frustrations. I figure better the drums than us.<br/>

Raine replies: Yes, my husband&#39;s father would take the dishes (not washed properly) outside and throw them! When my sister-in-law left her curling iron plugged in, he layed it on her arm to show that it was hot enough to start a fire!! My beloved husband is not one whit like his dad, but he does struggle at times. So, I can relate.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86040601">I&#39;ve learned from my DH&#39;s experience with is dad that I didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
that way. If it&#39;s something important, I kinda sneak around after no one<br/>
is looking to fix things if someone else tried but didn&#39;t get right. I<br/>
know my DH gets discouraged easily now and won&#39;t even try if he knows<br/>
he&#39;ll get it wrong. I don&#39;t want to discourage my children that way.<br/>
<br/>
Shhh, don&#39;t tell em.<br/>
<br/>
Eww, the curling iron thing is just sick. A friend of mine had a brother<br/>
that had to touch the hot stove for smoking or playing with matches, I<br/>
forgot what his crime was but it&#39;s just not right. Parents!<br/>

&gt; Raine replies: Yes, my husband&#39;s father would take the dishes (not <br/>
&gt; washed properly) outside and throw them! When my sister-in-law left <br/>
&gt; her curling iron plugged in, he layed it on her arm to show that it <br/>
&gt; was hot enough to start a fire!! My beloved husband is not one whit <br/>
&gt; like his dad, but he does struggle at times. So, I can relate. <br/>
&gt; Parenting, much like living, is a never-ending learning process, and <br/>
&gt; some of us start out at a disadvantage, unfortunately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758889593">Sharon - it is totally normal - for some of our kids and not for  <br/>
others. Don&#39;t compare, because you&#39;ll find out that there are kids who  <br/>
NEVER act like this and you&#39;ll start wondering what you did wrong, etc.<br/>

Just be his mom and be with him as he is now. One thing I can reassure  <br/>
you about - it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll always be like this so tell yourself  <br/>

&gt; Kathleen, thanks for your post I truly feel that you understand.<br/>
&gt; I want my children to be nice and at the same time want them to be  <br/>
&gt; strong<br/>
&gt; enough not to take crap from people. The strong part is coming easy.<br/>
&gt; I fear we&#39;ll end up hating each other and it&#39;s so stupid cause the  <br/>
&gt; power<br/>
&gt; struggles are sometimes about things that won&#39;t mean a thing tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; BTW my son has a drum set and although it might drive the rest of the<br/>
&gt; people in our home nuts at times I tell everyone to let him pound on  <br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; when he gets angry. He does use them at times to take out his<br/>
&gt; frustrations. I figure better the drums than us.<br/>

&gt;&gt; That is somewhat what I meant. I believe cooling off<br/>
&gt;&gt; before you lose it is really important with teenagers.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Not that I never lost it, when they headed into these<br/>
&gt;&gt; phases we were in yelling matches and power struggle<br/>
&gt;&gt; frequently. Also I  believe taking care of yourself<br/>
&gt;&gt; models to them how to do that and not allowing someone<br/>
&gt;&gt; to cuss you out or verbally abuse you  sets a standard<br/>
&gt;&gt; of treatment for what  is acceptable. Would you want<br/>
&gt;&gt; you kids to think it is okay to take it while a spouse<br/>
&gt;&gt; or boss calls them names? It is not abandonment to set<br/>
&gt;&gt; a standard of what is acceptable treatment of another<br/>
&gt;&gt; person, especially persons we love. I am not<br/>
&gt;&gt; suggesting to hold a grudge, just bottom line when you<br/>
&gt;&gt; can speak to me like I am a person I am all ears.Allow<br/>
&gt;&gt; them to find another way of releasing all of the<br/>
&gt;&gt; frustrations of teenagerness, something productive<br/>
&gt;&gt; like a walk or a run or a punching bag.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I really wasn&#39;t trying to offend Sharon and can really<br/>
&gt;&gt; respect her struggle because I was so unsure if we<br/>
&gt;&gt; would live through it, or if we would like each other<br/>
&gt;&gt; at the end.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I agree totally with Sandra that it is their job to<br/>
&gt;&gt; break away. Imagine a beautiful sweet smelling cuddly<br/>
&gt;&gt; infant was ready to leave home .... NOOOOO&gt;&gt;&gt; By the<br/>
&gt;&gt; time my two boys left I was helping them pack. LOL .<br/>
&gt;&gt; Really I was sad, but it was time and we both felt it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am new here and have enjoyed everyones posts so<br/>
&gt;&gt; much. I am really at the start of our unschooling<br/>
&gt;&gt; experience with my six who are home. I have<br/>
&gt;&gt; homeschooled for the past year. With a flicker of<br/>
&gt;&gt; unschooling but was freaked out that I would be<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;putting them behind&quot; if I did not follow a<br/>
&gt;&gt; curriculum, but the more I read the more I am<br/>
&gt;&gt; convinced that this is the way to go..<br/>
&gt;&gt; Have a Great day all.<br/>

I think it may depend on the situation. Sometimes I could be animated and <br/>
funny and sweet---and moments later surly and quiet. I see Cameron fluctuating <br/>
too. But he is less intense than I ever was. <br/>

all the time, about  how I didn&#39;t want to be like my parents, or did <br/>
want to be like my parents ( It was never exactly clear cut), wanted to <br/>
imitated some adults but not others... and some days was just plain <br/>
confused and overload...  It&#39;s part of growing up.  Part of you realized <br/>
you can only be yourself and  part of you is trying to define that <br/>

that there was a time when I wasn&#39;t so confortable and sure of myself. <br/>
