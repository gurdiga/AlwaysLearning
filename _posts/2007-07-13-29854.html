In our very homeschooling friendly state, CT, there is a procedure for<br/>
anyone in your situation.  The lawyer in our state is a homeschooling mom,<br/>
has a national organization (National Home Education Legal Defense) and is<br/>
excellent.  She is one of the reasons our state&#39;s laws are so homeschooling<br/>
friendly!  She may be able to help you.  Go to:  www.NHELD.com<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nheld.com/">http://www.nheld.com/</a>&gt; .  I believe people in your situation have gotten<br/>
their records cleared.  By the way, I think it is wonderful your son has the<br/>
freedom to run around naked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738884441">-=-By the way, I think it is wonderful your son has the<br/>
freedom to run around naked.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But depending where you live, he might NOT have that freedom.<br/>
<br/>
If he was in the front yard instead of the back, or if your neighbors  <br/>
can see your back yard and he was running around naked, that honestly  <br/>
might not be legal or sufficiently friendly.<br/>
<br/>
My kids did lots of nekkid water play in our back yard, with a high  <br/>
fence, with a good patio roof for shade, with friends over, mixed  <br/>
groups.   Had they done that in the front yard, at the advanced ages  <br/>
of five or six, I&#39;m sure people would&#39;ve called and complained to the  <br/>
city.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much a person&#39;s right not to see a penis outweighs a person&#39;s  <br/>
right to show his penis.  So really, it&#39;s worth finding out and  <br/>
considering the feelings of the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about unschooling or homeschooling.  Schoolkids could be  <br/>
playing nekkid in summer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-923954028">Hi<br/>
<br/>
First stop freaking out.  It&#39;s ok.  As someone told me once, act like <br/>
everything I do is Fine, is OK is wonderful, and others are more likely <br/>
to see it as Fine, OK, and wonderful.  If I act like  my actions, as a <br/>
parent or as a person, are not fine, OK and wonderful, others might <br/>
question me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had CPS three times in our house.  Because of a nasty divorce, with <br/>
my ex making bad choices regarding his parenting.  All of them turned <br/>
out fine.  Why?  Because I am a good mom doing the best I can under <br/>
difficult circumstances.  The visits were stressful, but the above <br/>
advice served me well.  During our first visit the <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling issue didn&#39;t even come up, although I had to <br/>
educate the social worker on vaccination laws and education laws, which <br/>
I did sweetly and with obviously knowledge.  Honestly, if they didn&#39;t <br/>
remove your child today, it&#39;s not going to happen.  They said they&#39;d <br/>
close the case, so obviously all is fine. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I have friends who are social workers and they say they&#39;d rather <br/>
see a house with child clutter, meaning the children have freedom to <br/>
play and get toys out, than a perfectly clean house with no clutter.  :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987118989">I used to be a Department of Children&#39;s Services Social worker and did some  <br/>
CPS work. First of all. Nudity in and of itself is not at all child abuse.  <br/>
Unless someone (the adult) is gaining sexual gratification it is not sexual  <br/>
abuse or should in anyway be considered so. I agree with the previous poster.  <br/>
You did nothing wrong so be confident in that. I was an approved foster home,  <br/>
adoptive parent and was a children&#39;s services social worker and had CPS  called <br/>
on me 5 times. (Annoying nosy body neighbor) Each time I just said come  on <br/>
in we have nothing to hide. It will be fine. Clutter is not neglect or abuse.  <br/>
Especially outside. I&#39;ve got toys everywhere here. If that&#39;s abuse or neglect <br/>
my  kids would be gone by now. Oh and five year olds have a tendency to strip. <br/>
My  youngest sister went to kindergarten her first day stripped down to her  <br/>
underwear if the teacher hadn&#39;t caught her she would have been nude. : ) Mom  <br/>
never could keep clothes on that child. : ) Again be confident in your <br/>
parenting  abilities. You know you are a good parent. I will keep you in my prayers <br/>
and if  there is anything I can do to help let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567265160">-=-First of all. Nudity in and of itself is not at all child abuse. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, but it could be considered neglect.<br/>
<br/>
Parents have a duty to provide for children, and there are phrases  <br/>
like &quot;clothe and feed&quot; that are so deeply a part of our culture that  <br/>
a child being hungry, having no food in the house, a child not owning  <br/>
or wearing clothes appropriate to the season/weather, can all be  <br/>
termed neglect.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I agree with the previous poster.<br/>
You did nothing wrong so be confident in that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction--state to state, county  <br/>
to county (township, parish, whatever that state has), town to  <br/>
town.   The concept of &quot;community standards&quot; means that what is  <br/>
acceptable in one place, what is deemed decent or okay (by social  <br/>
workers or judges or juries or whatever) is what&#39;s to be considered  <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. Clutter is not neglect or abuse. Especially outside. -=-<br/>
<br/>
A statement like this just can&#39;t be made.  Beyond all I wrote above,  <br/>
some neighborhoods have binding covenants making it illegal to have  <br/>
clutter.  There are neighborhoods with the weirdest laws, and if a  <br/>
family has relatives or neighbors willing to call the county or the  <br/>
state on them, they need to find out what local rules and laws are,  <br/>
not take the word of anyone on an international discussion list about  <br/>
what is or isn&#39;t legal.<br/>
<br/>
In our city it&#39;s illegal to have a non-running vehicle, even in the  <br/>
back yard.  It seems like a stupid law, but there it is.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
child neglect just to  have one, but if a kid got hurt playing in an  <br/>
old pickup (we own two, both of which run, but they don&#39;t look like  <br/>
they&#39;d run, just to look at them), then the other law can be called  <br/>
out and it would could be neglect to follow the law, to supervise  <br/>
children, to exercise due caution.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Again be confident in your parenting abilities. You know you are a  <br/>
good parent.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the person who wrote that is friends with the original poster,  <br/>
take the reassurances private.  If someone who didn&#39;t even know a  <br/>
person at all wrote that, please don&#39;t do it on this list.   <br/>
Seriously.  We can&#39;t see each other.  Even people I&#39;ve met,  unless  <br/>
I&#39;ve known them for a long time, could be putting on a show for me.<br/>
<br/>
I assume people are good parents, but I&#39;m not going to reassure  <br/>
someone blindly and I&#39;d prefer not to provide a list for others to do  <br/>
so on.  Let&#39;s talk about ideas and not people, even in the most  <br/>
positive of ways, whenever we can.<br/>

IVe dealt with cps in several different ways and in different places. Ive done er nursing, taken foster parenting classes , and my 3 god children were taken away by cps 6months ago........one is still in foster care, other 2 were returned 3 weeks ago. <br/>
<br/>
In most places cps really supports the parents and isnt out to get you . They look for several things but what is acceptable varies from places to place and things like finances are usualy taken into consideration. For example I was raised in Houston, TX and never once slept in my parents bed nor had I ever heard of any of my friends. Dh was raised in Lousiana and where he was it was very common for family members to sleep in a bed together, mom, dad kids, grandma and grandchilren, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway on the question of school.....if he was in school they would likely speak with his teacher, the nurse, etc to see if any concerns came up. Also they just like to know that the kids development is being supported. <br/>
The bed question. I think they do want to know he has a safe comfortable and clean place to sleep .....but I also think its a good excuse to be able to do a quick glance through the house. :)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like things are going to be ok. I would suggest taking pics TODAY . The yard, the area he sleeps, a cabinet full of food, and any areas that were messy. <br/>
In the off chance you end up in court and you have a cps worker tryt to say well the house was messy your lawyer may be able to use the pictures to show well yes it was messy ....we have some cars here and paper and markers laying out. <br/>
If they do come back out once again take pictures as soon as they leave. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, <br/>
Nicole <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698821780">-=-If i was too write here and say my son<br/>

<br/>
Giving choices doesn&#39;t mean giving all the choices in the whole  <br/>
world. It means not making arbitrary decisions for him.<br/>
<br/>
What people you don&#39;t even know might think (what you imagine they  <br/>
might say on a list) isn&#39;t nearly as real as what a social worker  <br/>
thinks in your own town.<br/>
<br/>
Going through your list of what&#39;s what is great, because the more  <br/>
you&#39;ve thought about it (not panicked, but analyzed calmly), the  <br/>
better prepared you&#39;ll be to respond at the return.<br/>
<br/>
You might be living where nudity of whatever sort there was is  <br/>
absolutely not a problem.  You might not be.  Nobody here knows and  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t matter.  What does matter is that you consider that it&#39;s  <br/>
different different places, and it&#39;s worth considering (for anyone,  <br/>
anywhere) what the neighbors think.   I don&#39;t live and die by what my  <br/>
neighbors think, but it would be as wrong to live for them wholly as  <br/>
it would be to disregard them totally and do whatever I want  <br/>
regardless of the effect on the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
Balance is worth attempting.<br/>

<br/>
The only thing mentioned by the poster was the nudity by the child  and the <br/>
yard. It is not neglect for a child, especially a 5 yr. old to be  running <br/>
around naked in the summer, especially while playing in a pool. I could  get that <br/>
one thrown out of court very quickly.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction-Laws vary from jurisdictio<br/>

<br/>
Laws do vary by state. But not all. And even if your state or your  community <br/>
states that nudity is not allowed. You are breaking the law  or  ordinance <br/>
not committing child abuse. Big difference. I do agree though that  each <br/>
individual should know what the laws and ordinances in there area are so as  to avoid <br/>
those type of situations. Especially those who homeschool or unschool,  <br/>
because we are more closely scrutinized by others.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Well, it&#39;s your board Sandra so I will agree to do as you ask.  However, may <br/>
I point out that others encourage each others often on this board.  Maybe I <br/>
should have reworded my statement and said, &quot; If you know you are doing  nothing <br/>
wrong and know that you are a good parent, then be confident in that. &quot;  Wou<br/>
ld that statement have been better?<br/>
 <br/>
It seems any time that CPS is mentioned people just freak out. That  is not a <br/>
good thing to do when you are faced with an investigation it can cause  you <br/>
to look guilty.  Would you all like me to leave the group? I ask this  because <br/>
I have been asked by other un-schooling and home schooling groups in the  past <br/>
when they find out I am a former CPS worker. I have been a CPS investigator  <br/>
but I have also been an advocate for children&#39;s right&#39;s and an advocate for  <br/>
parent&#39;s rights. SOme of those right&#39;s being their right to choose the type of  <br/>
education their children receive and their right to raise their child how <br/>
they  want even though it may not be the norm for society. I however, and let me <br/>
make  this very clear, in no way advocate for abuse or neglect of children. <br/>
That is  the most horrible offense that our world has. Children are our gifts <br/>
from God  and we are given their lives to support, love and train so that they <br/>
can grow  into mature loving, well rounded adults. Abusing an innocent child <br/>
would put  that person at the top of my list of un-worthy adults. Ok now me and <br/>
my children  (their&#39;s 8 of them) are going shopping, should be fun, but if I <br/>
don&#39;t  post again today it could mean that they totally wore me out, and I am  <br/>
at home having a calgon take me away moment. : ) <br/>

learning-related questions here, not the CPS question, though it  <br/>
still applies).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Laws do vary by state. But not all. -=-<br/>

Please, hundreds of people read this list.  Write carefully.  Only  <br/>
quote the parts to which you&#39;re responding.  Differentiate quotes  <br/>
from responses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Well, it&#39;s your board Sandra so I will agree to do as you ask. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a list.<br/>
This is a board:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.info/forum/active.asp">http://unschooling.info/forum/active.asp</a><br/>
Clarity with language helps in every case in which language is all we  <br/>
have, such as on a discussion list, or message board.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, may I point out that others encourage each others often  <br/>
on this board. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you think I was unaware that a list I created involved  <br/>
encouragement of others?<br/>
<br/>
Encouraging people to find ways to keep their families happy and to  <br/>
continue to unschool very often involves reminding them to know what  <br/>
the laws are where they live.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe I<br/>
should have reworded my statement and said, &quot; If you know you are<br/>
doing nothing<br/>
wrong and know that you are a good parent, then be confident in that.<br/>
&quot; Would that statement have been better?-=-<br/>
<br/>
ABSOLUTELY!!!<br/>
That would be better for being useful, and true.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you all like me to leave the group-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, but I would like for everyone who posts here to post with care  <br/>
and consider whether any and every statement will help someone who&#39;s  <br/>
lurking and might never reveal herself by posting.<br/>
<br/>
A blanket &quot;You&#39;re a great mom,&quot; to a stranger, or &quot;You know your  <br/>
child better than anyone&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re doing a great job!&quot; is worse  <br/>
than saying nothing.  It&#39;s fluff and nonsense, to write that to  <br/>
someone you&#39;ve never even seen.  Those who desire such  messages  <br/>
desire fluff and nonsense, and I don&#39;t want them to find it on this  <br/>
list.<br/>
