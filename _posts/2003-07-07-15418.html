It&#39;s an okay article.  I&#39;m a disappointed in a couple of the points they made <br/>
but overall it&#39;s positive.<br/>
<br/>
I was kind of afraid they would skunk me, as I was totally insistent that the <br/>
third week in May was NOT a good time for our family to have two extensive <br/>
visits from a photographer.  &quot;You won&#39;t even know she&#39;s there,&quot; the editor told <br/>
me.  And when I said &quot;There&#39;s nothing to photograph that won&#39;t look like them <br/>
just living everyday lives,&quot; she assured me the photographer was a <br/>
professional.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  &quot;Professional&quot; enough to make the week of preparations before an SCA <br/>
event, while we&#39;re hauling out of our house enough wooden benches, tables, boxes <br/>
and chests full of medievalish dishes, clothes and camping equipment to set <br/>
up five days of food and camp for a dozen and some people?  That does NOT make <br/>
my house look photogenic at all.  And I was making bread, in already-hot New <br/>
Mexico, and didn&#39;t need to be further interviewed by a photographer.<br/>
<br/>
I offered REALLY good photo-ops where there would be more homeschoolers than <br/>
just my kids.  I gave specific times and places, none more than a mile from my <br/>
home, six different activities guaranteed to look cool in the paper, but they <br/>
wanted pictures of me homeschooling my kids.  I said that would look my me <br/>
driving them around or me watching a movie with them or them telling me a story. <br/>
  She was getting really frustrated, but not as frustrated as I was getting.<br/>
<br/>
So there are no photos of me or the kids, which is fine.  They got plenty of <br/>
schooly-looking stuff to publish from other families.<br/>
<br/>
I think it will be online for a week or so, and then will be available only <br/>
to subscribers to the Journal site.<br/>
