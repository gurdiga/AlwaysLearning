<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156860084">My daughter, Sophia, turns four next week.  This past year she has gone two mornings a week to a nursery school at the YMCA.  I was hesitant to do this, but did do it because I was working at the YMCA during those hours, was encouraged to by two friends whose sons were enrolled in the program, and because I thought my daughter would really enjoy it.  She has always been very, very social and always wants to be wherever other children are.  Well, she does indeed LOVE it.  She asks me every day how many more days until she goes to school and her eyes absolutely light up when I tell that tomorrow she goes to the YMCA.  She has never once wanted to stay home from the program, even when she had the stomach flu.  Her only sibling at this point just turned one, so there&#39;s not that kind of kid play opportunity at home. <br/>
<br/>
I have always wanted to do some form of homeschooling/unschooling with her.  I discovered the concept of radical unschooling in November and am definitely drawn in that direction and have begun to move slowly in that direction at home.  (I ws never really rule oriented to begin with.)  Now, however, my daughter wants to go to preschool like the other children will do next year.  Of course, she doesn&#39;t have a real conception of preschool, other than that is where other children will be and perhaps that it will have that school structure to it. Perhaps that is part of what she likes.  I don&#39;t know for sure.  I just know she LOVES going to the YMCA nursery school. <br/>
<br/>
I have told her we are going to do something different at home.  I have plans to enroll her in swimming and gymnastics at the YMCA to give her some of that social dynamic she seems to crave and gather with friends often.  (By the way, I know of no other people in my rather rural locale who would call what they are doing unschooling.  I know lots of school-at-homers, mainly from a Christian mindset.) Part of me regrets sending her to the YMCA nursery school, but how can I regret something that has given her so much joy?  <br/>
<br/>
So, I am having my doubts about keeping her home.  If the point of unschooling is to follow their interests, shouldn&#39;t I allow her the joy she gets from going to school?  I have read the section on school choice on Sandra&#39;s website, but I feel like she is so young and that she will never not want to go (at least during the fun preschool year next year) and therefore I will loose her to the school model.  I feel like it will be years before she ever asks to stay home, if she ever does.  This really makes me sad, but I don&#39;t want to keep her home just because that is what I want.  I want her to want it to, but she is so young, I almost feel like she doesn&#39;t really know the alternatives yet.  However, isn&#39;t the unschooling philosophy to let them discover it for themselves and not make these decisions for them?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for any thoughts/ideas/words of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

<br/>
So are they using a subject curriculum or is it undirected play?  It <br/>
sounds like your child likes to play with other kids.  Enrolled in a <br/>
nursery.  Is this for the sake of having a spot open for her to be <br/>
there?  It&#39;s not actually school enrollment, is it, even thought it&#39;s <br/>
called &quot;school.&quot;  Is the nursery school basically a babysitting <br/>
provision for people at the Y?<br/>
<br/>
On the days she is home is there some place you can take her that she <br/>
could play with kids?  I have taken Karl to McDonald&#39;s play places, <br/>
parks, libraries, children&#39;s museums, walking around the neighborhood, <br/>
friends&#39; houses and so forth.  There are all sorts of impromptu and <br/>
planned child play opportunities, especially in a city environment.  <br/>
You&#39;re not limited to the YMCA.  It&#39;s fun there and other places too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900307525">Since you will be signing her up for classes like gymnastics at the same Y<br/>
she&#39;s been going to, just tell her that she is going to school! School does<br/>
changes as kids grow older. She&#39;s going to the same place, likely with some<br/>
of the same kids. That can go on for years actually! Other kids will<br/>
eventually be doing &quot;after school&quot; activities while that is your child&#39;s<br/>
&quot;school&quot; but it doesn&#39;t matter what you call it if she enjoys it and gets<br/>
her social needs met.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is almost 5 and has taken classes at our local parks and rec center<br/>
since he was 1 or 2 (these are wonderful classes in all sorts of things:<br/>
mostly sports and arts). For the younger kids the classes are only 30-45<br/>
mins and super cheap (like $12 for 4 classes). As they get older they move<br/>
to 45-60 min classes (and the price goes up to a whopping $18-20 for 4<br/>
classes). We did a lot the year he was 3 because he expressed a lot of<br/>
interest in sports, so he did soccer, baseball, gymnastics, etc. and he<br/>
loved going and doing the classes. Incidentally, we are not doing any<br/>
classes right now because he doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere, which I am a<br/>
little sad about but that is a whole other story. (I am honoring his need to<br/>
stay home even though I feel he needs to get out more and be around other<br/>
kids, but we have play dates with our local unschooling group sometimes that<br/>
seems to satisfy his current group social needs. I guess in due time he may<br/>
want to take classes again. We just got the summer class catalog and I will<br/>
ask him if he&#39;d like to take any classes.)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I had a good laugh one day when he was 3 and when we went to the<br/>
playground park that is right next to the rec center where he took classes<br/>
and he pointed and said, &quot;There&#39;s my school!&quot; So after that when he had a<br/>
class there, we were going to school. Most of the sports classes were taught<br/>
by a wonderful teacher named Michelle who seemed knowledgeable in all sports<br/>
and had an incredible amount of patience with small children. She even had<br/>
her own teenage children help her with the classes sometimes (as they&#39;d<br/>
break the kids into smaller groups). Her oldest college age son is now<br/>
teaching some classes on his own! We really lucked out in finding such a<br/>
great teacher and having a cheap parks and rec dept close by.<br/>
 <br/>
I had always intended to homeschool and had wondered what it would be like<br/>
if my son ever asked to go to school, and that curiousity was satisfied by<br/>
finding out that he was going to &quot;school&quot; with his &quot;teacher&quot; Michelle! I<br/>
think I miss the classes more than he does! But they also satisfied family<br/>
members (daddy included) ideas that Damon needs to be around kids his own<br/>
age more. I&#39;ve been getting more questions about when he&#39;s starting classes<br/>
again. **sigh**<br/>

<br/>
How many alternatives have you shown her?  With a child so young, it&#39;s<br/>
not as much about letting them discover it for themselves, but bringing<br/>
things to them and them to things for discovery to happen.<br/>
<br/>
What about co-ops, or part time preschool, or continuing the YMCA<br/>
program?  Why does it need to be all or nothing?  Classes are a good<br/>
idea, but not necessarily the best for social ops.  Good old free play<br/>
at the playground or play gym are really good for being able to play<br/>
with other kids.</div>

He liked playing on the playground and being with the kids.  He kind of wanted to go back the next year so we talked about what he liked about it and then provided him with those things in other ways.  He primarily like playing on the playground and playing with the kids so we did lots of park days and playgroups.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Join or start a homeschool group for free play and maybe some planned <br/>
activities. You can set up planned activities so they aren&#39;t school <br/>
like. Parents can pick a theme (with kids&#39; input and interests in mind). <br/>
For example, you can have &quot;music day.&quot; Each family puts together some <br/>
kind of &quot;music day&quot; activity. Maybe they bring some interesting musical <br/>
instruments and the kids try them out. Maybe they bring a &quot;science&quot; <br/>
activity - it is fun to bring lots of things to bang on like drums <br/>
(oatmeal boxes, pot lids, etc.) and put rice on them so you can actually <br/>
see the vibrations), maybe someone teaches everyone to sing a round <br/>
together. We&#39;ve done music day, dice day, lego day, take-apart day, <br/>
airplanes day, international day, &quot;sun&quot; day, archaeology day, colonial <br/>
america day, westward movement day, rhyming day, mud day, games day, old <br/>
photos day, candlemaking, balloon day, soldering day, origami day, rock <br/>
day, erosion day, science experiments you can eat day, light day, puzzle <br/>
day, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Kids were not required to participate - some kids always just played in <br/>
the park the entire time. Some kids did every activity offered. Mostly <br/>
they were not group activities, but each parent would set up a station <br/>
and kids would go around and do whatever interested them. We did these <br/>
at parks. Also had holiday celebrations and once a month science day and <br/>
every other week a sports day and the kids put on plays together and we <br/>
went on tours together and went camping together, etc.<br/>
<br/>
After about 6 or 7 years of that - my kids wanted a lot more free play, <br/>
fewer elaborate planned activities. So we started another group and the <br/>
goal of the group as stated was to protect their free play time. We did <br/>
also offer an occasional activity - but it would be just one or two <br/>
activities on a day rather than the 10 or sometimes even more that our <br/>
old group would have in one day. Take-apart day - everyone brought lots <br/>
of tools and old broken appliances. Candle making, origami, bubbles, <br/>
bottle rockets, rope-making, etc. Lower key than our previous group.<br/>
<br/>
Both groups are still going - some people go to both, some to just one <br/>
or the other, depending on what their kids like. My now-18 year old <br/>
still goes most weeks and plays games with her buddies. She started when <br/>
she was 4 years old.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a really social kid - this is something you can do. They <br/>
won&#39;t want to go to school if it means missing out on that much fun with <br/>
friends. It is a lot of work, but also really a lot of fun. I know <br/>
someone who puts on activities like this in her back yard on a regular <br/>
basis. She charges a little for it - makes a little money on it. She <br/>
does all the work and so can offer stuff her own kids really enjoy. <br/>
Built-in  social life for her kids, too.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be clear these are very much NOT school-type activities. They <br/>
are hands-on fun things to do. At &quot;colonial day&quot; for example, one person <br/>
brought clay and the kids made clay marbles and learned to play marble <br/>
games from back then. Someone brought big washtubs and washboards with <br/>
lots of doll clothes and some kids spent the day scrubbing clothes and <br/>
hanging them up to dry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060153076">i personally feel that children under about 7 or 8 love school because they get to see the same &#39;tribe&#39; of kids every day...it gives them a sense of belonging and they develop those friendships every day more and more...<br/>
<br/>
this is tough on a lot of kids who are homeschooled/unschooled as they do not often have that consistency...they  miss their friends who live far away or too far to see every day or even every week or more... <br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t think its all or nothing... it IS finding a balance but when we parents who have already put our young kids in schools want for our kids to want the true freedom unschooling &quot;consists of&quot; (pun intended!)this is not easy to undo...they get hooked and want to stay put w/ their &#39;clan&#39;. they get to thinking in their reality that this is IT and this is where they belong and they aren&#39;t budging. makes sense, really... <br/>
<br/>
i have expressed that this is very difficult to not send my daughter back to school once the year is up (and on into the grades...)but as much as she protests unschooling, i trust that at 6 yrs old she really does not comprehend the alternative...which for me isn&#39;t even an &#39;alternative&#39;. it is true freedom. it is truly LIVING. i don&#39;t believe that schools of any sort are truly living FULLY for children...and i don&#39;t feel that is going to extremes.<br/>

The original comment was qualified with &quot;they do not often...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some kids I went to school with were there throughout.  Except for  <br/>
first grade, I went to Espanola Elementary, Espanola Jr. High and  <br/>
Espanola High School.   Some kids I went to school with were there for  <br/>
a year, or part of a year, and had been in six other schools before.    <br/>
So even kids who go to school aren&#39;t guaranteed any consistency.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have friends from their childhoods and babyhoods, but it&#39;s  <br/>
more that we haven&#39;t moved, and that we participated in La Leche  <br/>
League and the SCA than anything else.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
When our daughter was 4, she definitely wanted to go to  school.  She too <br/>
loved the local playgroup she attended.  We&#39;d been  vaguely considering home <br/>
education but felt that she was asking for the  structure and especially the <br/>
social life that school offered, and so we  enrolled her.  Would we have <br/>
taken the same decision now we know  better; now we&#39;ve seen how the classes <br/>
bored her and the peer pressure almost  stifled her individuality?  I think we <br/>
might still have let her cross the  threshold and enter the first class to <br/>
satisfy her curiosity, but we&#39;d have been  much more alert to the warning <br/>
signs that she was increasingly unhappy.  It  shouldn&#39;t have taken us 7 years <br/>
to finally take the plunge and deregister  her.  If we&#39;d been truly <br/>
listening we might well have taken her out  before she finished her first year.<br/>
 <br/>
If you do allow your child the freedom of choice in this way it may well be <br/>
 good to be prepared that she may change her mind quite soon.  But  watch <br/>
and listen with great care because (if our experience is anything to  go by) <br/>
even if she hates the place, she may not openly voice her wish to leave  <br/>
school until some years later. <br/>
 <br/>
I hope at least that our mistakes can help you make the right decision for  <br/>
your child.<br/>

may i ask where your kids met these other kids? did they go to school (your children) i hope that my daughter&#39;s friends now (the ones who are the most precious to her...) will be able to stay in touch (via their parents/grandparents) come next fall...i really do. but i do know how people can be...as soon as either they or we get outside of an arena socially, the relationships aren&#39;t nurtured anymore... so this is what i&#39;m fretting about sometimes for my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m going to join our local christian homeschool groups as the local unschooler group so far isn&#39;t feeling right to me...i&#39;ll give it a shot for a few more months but i also will try the other. thing is, i&#39;m not christian. they are welcoming though and don&#39;t need to know this... they do so much together and we do know one family already who we like a lot. they swim here at the resort we live at as the dad&#39;s parents stay here in the summertime. so that in itself is a nice connection. :O)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711428073">i truly do not believe this...reason being is she is still so young (which i&#39;ve already shared) and doesn&#39;t comprehend the choices she has! if she were older, i feel it&#39;d be different.<br/>
<br/>
how am i giving my child a choice when she has been in school the past year? how am i givine my son a choice if he is unschooled and all of a sudden wants to go to kindergarten because his friends from some playground go? i don&#39;t know...but i think once they are older its more rational...but not when they are so young. <br/>
<br/>
also, and you can call me selfish if you want to (and i&#39;m humble enough to take it) but i want a lifestyle for us that school does NOT offer. in fact, i&#39;m tired of women especially feeling guilty and that we are selfish for what we need in our lives, in our families... and after all, these ARE children that we have been blessed with caring for and raising...i just feel that when it comes to a family&#39;s lifestyle, the parents usually set the course and the kids follow. then, ironically, we follow their lead... if that makes any sense. <br/>

&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i have expressed that this is very difficult to not send my <br/>
&gt; daughter back to school once the year is up (and on into the <br/>
&gt; grades...)but as much as she protests unschooling, i trust that at 6 <br/>
&gt; yrs old she really does not comprehend the alternative...which for me <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t even an &#39;alternative&#39;. it is true freedom. it is truly LIVING. i <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t believe that schools of any sort are truly living FULLY for <br/>
&gt; children...and i don&#39;t feel that is going to extremes. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pulling a child out of school who wants school rids the child of as <br/>
&gt; much freedom as taking a child to school who doesn&#39;t want school.   On <br/>
&gt; the important issues in a child&#39;s life, freedom isn&#39;t freedom where no <br/>
&gt; choice is allowed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689836335">I joined local homeschool groups, I got involved and set up gatherings myself, some I had met a the LaLeche Meetings since my son was 5 months old.<br/>
Go for it. I am very outgoing and that helps.<br/>
I also had to let got of trying to find friends for ME in the parents. I get along with all and some have become friends but I look for friends to my kids not myself.<br/>
