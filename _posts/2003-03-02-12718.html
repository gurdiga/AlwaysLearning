&lt;&lt; Looking at the table of contents,  it was great to see that so many of the <br/>
main articles were unschooling ones.    Cool! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it was very cool. I got the issue and was really thrilled to see I was <br/>
amongst such writers as Rue Kream, Mary Gold (Zenmomma) and Sandra of course. <br/>
A bit intimidating for this newbie...but inspirational too. <br/>
I have loved reading Mary and Sandra&#39;s stuff ever since I came to <br/>
unschooling.com, so that was really cool of course.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing, I&#39;m working on a little piece about last years conference and <br/>
this is the absolute last call for any comments or quotes. I am finishing up <br/>
editing this weekend, so if I&#39;m going to squeeze a little something in, NOW <br/>
is the time.<br/>
Anyone? Thanks y&#39;all...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562669317">I hadn&#39;t read any of my issue of HEM yet, and just read Ren&#39;s while <br/>
re starting my computer.  <br/>
It was wonderful!<br/>
It&#39;s just what I needed to read.<br/>
I&#39;m having trouble with fear at this point and time and I so don&#39;t <br/>
want to be this way.<br/>
The joy is all around me, and I need to let it win.<br/>
Thanks for the inspiration Ren.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was a wonderful article.  It was so nice to see so many unschooling tid <br/>
bits and articles in this issue.  I have subscribed and unsubscribed in the <br/>
past because it was too homeschooly with not much unschooling in it.  It <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to fit with how we are now and I wasn&#39;t getting much out of it <br/>
but this issue was GREAT!!!<br/>

knew another Pam until now.  LOL)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thanks for the inspiration Ren. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are so completely welcome. I feel humbled that something I wrote could <br/>
help in some small way. <br/>
I think you have a right to feel fear right now.....and your being aware of <br/>
it will help it not control.  Hang in there.<br/>

Thanks Rue, I liked yours too!! It was full of unschooling stuff, very <br/>
awesome.<br/>
When I got my issue and turned to my page, the first thing I said was &quot;COOL, <br/>
I know Rue!!&quot; :)<br/>
Then Mary Gold was there and Sandra&#39;s regular article and I just felt right <br/>
at home.<br/>
