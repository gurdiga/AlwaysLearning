<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161573548">I have an idea. How about pretending that the games are math books<br/>
and he&#39;s frantically trying to find the ones that suit him. Really<br/>
envision that scenario and then treat the games (and money for the<br/>
games) the same way you&#39;d treat the books.<br/>

I love this.  What a great way to think about soooo many things!!! This is<br/>
one for my board.<br/>
I&#39;m going to print it out, paste it onto a colored file card.  Then I am<br/>
going to tape it on the inside door of our computer armoir.  Whenever I get<br/>
wierd about something...I can look at it!  Thanks Pam.<br/>
