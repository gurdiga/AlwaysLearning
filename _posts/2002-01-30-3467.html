<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s called Blue Planet and has some pretty amazing images <br/>
&gt; of deep sea life. We both watched slack-jawed as schools of 1,000&#39;s of <br/>
&gt; sharks descended on unsuspecting prey. We saw a killer whale eat a sea lion <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Casey told me it was a killer whale, I wasn&#39;t sure). It&#39;s a great show, <br/>
&gt; just frame after frame of amazing images.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We watched that too!!  It was awesome,,,,although I did get quite<br/>
annoyed that they would show the different animals breeding and <br/>
laying eggs, but NOT show the babies hatching!!  I wanted to see<br/>
what happened next when the babies were born.  Maybe they&#39;ll<br/>
show that part later?  Anyway, I guess it&#39;s a series.  We watched <br/>
the first part on Sunday and then the second part that they showed <br/>
right afterwards (and I noticed they did them both all over again two<br/>
hours later!).  Unfortunately, I missed last night&#39;s episode because <br/>
I&#39;m such a Roswell junkie, but if there&#39;s another part to the Blue <br/>
Planet series tonight, I&#39;ll be sure to tune in!  I&#39;m hoping they will <br/>
make it available to borrow from the library eventually.<br/>
