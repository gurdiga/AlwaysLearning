oooh, I had an Opa!! It was my Godfather&#39;s Dad...lot&#39;s of Norweigan <br/>
background.<br/>

Here are some ways we&#39;ve tried to make Trevor&#39;s Birthday stand out during a <br/>
huge holiday season....Although being New Years is probably easier than <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
We turn the tree into a &quot;Birthday tree&quot;...taking off all of the Christmas <br/>
decorations and putting on balloons, streamers and some small gifts or toys <br/>
(hot wheels worked great in past years).<br/>
Making special foods that the child likes that aren&#39;t very holiday related,  <br/>
have a pinata (we&#39;re doing one on Christmas day this year!!), have everyone <br/>
do a special treasure hunt together (adults too)....<br/>
It&#39;s always tough to make a Birthday stand out on a huge day like Christmas, <br/>
but little things can make the child feel that it&#39;s their special day too.<br/>
Trevor thinks it&#39;s really cool to have his Birthday on New Years because <br/>
&quot;everyone celebrates on my Birthday!!&quot; as he puts it. And people always have <br/>
the day off.<br/>

&gt; Hey, do you know Terry Stafford or Pat Lucey?  I know Terry is a DRE near <br/>
&gt; Vancouver, and I&#39;m not sure what Pat is near Ottawa, but something like <br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

quite a few of us DRE/Unschoolers out there.<br/>
