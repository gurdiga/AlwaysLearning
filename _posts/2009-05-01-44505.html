<div id="ygrps-yiv-226661045">What could possibly be good about KimPossible?<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would ask what others think about that show.  What <br/>
good things come from watching it?<br/>
<br/>
This is in the interest of supporting Karl who really loves to watch <br/>
KimPossible.  Other shows I&#39;m thinking of in the same vein are Danny <br/>
Phantom and Trollz.<br/>
<br/>
Astroboy seems to draw no objections.  Powerful cute little robots that <br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
The objections to the other shows are the presence of magic and <br/>
meanness or mean spiritedness (don&#39;t ask me to define these because it <br/>
would be considered very pointed and rude of me to ask).<br/>

If she&#39;s not watching every show and having physical withdrawals when  <br/>
it&#39;s not on, she&#39;s probably not addicted.<br/>
<br/>
Once when Kirby was little he told he he thought about Ninja Turtles  <br/>
all the time, he even dreamed Ninja Turtles.   He was saying it  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959740070">Yes and some people really LUV to complain and hear themselves.  I <br/>
swear it&#39;s drama.  ;)  It really wears on me and I am doing different <br/>
things out of self-defense.<br/>
<br/>
Repeat as necessary.  That used to be my motto (picture me taking it <br/>
out and giving it quick polish).  I think I&#39;ll drag it back out again.  <br/>
:D  Maybe I&#39;ll even turn into Danny Phantom.<br/>
<br/>
One of the different things I did today is take Karl to the library <br/>
after the car came home and we got the use of it to switch out our <br/>
videos which were coming due Sunday (or Saturday.. I can never remember <br/>
those durn due dates).  We got some old faves which just luckily happen <br/>
to be on the not very objectionable list.  Karl is watching them right <br/>
now.  We got six.  Since Karl picked them out, he&#39;s very excited.  He <br/>
loved the Bill Nye the Science Guy that I got but I picked it.  He said <br/>
it was so funny.  But I know he likes those others more.  Comfort zone <br/>
type things.  Land Before Time.  It will give worriers something else <br/>
to talk about besides worries.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572515713">Karl is so much like Kirby it&#39;s hilarious.  He said something very <br/>
similar about TMNT when he had just turned 5 and was sooo into ninjas <br/>
and karate stuff.  And Mario was such a great big deal... still kinda <br/>
is though he&#39;s taken a little hiatus for now (the games are challenging <br/>
and he takes breaks instead of practically breaking himself over them <br/>
like he used to).<br/>
<br/>
I think KimPossible is very humorous for Karl.  He laughs a lot <br/>
throughout the show.  Something about it tickles him.  We were talking <br/>
about it the other day and he say he loves it when the &quot;good guy kicks <br/>
bad guy booty.&quot;  That&#39;s a quote.  I&#39;ve noticed that he laughs at the <br/>
banter too not just at the kick booty parts.  He didn&#39;t used to <br/>
understand banter.  That has definitely changed a lot since he&#39;s <br/>
started watching shows with more social elements.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s my take, as an avid watcher of both these shows (and many other <br/>
cartoons my son enjoys).<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that cartoons are for entertainment and artistic <br/>
pleasure, and these provide plenty of both. Pretty good things in my book!<br/>
<br/>
They are  both well made, entertaining cartoons with likeable (and <br/>
dislikable!) characters whose central theme is the battle of good vs <br/>
evil (the title characters are on the good side, and good always wins!).<br/>
How could that be a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
They are similar to every story where a kid somehow gets the power to <br/>
&quot;kick bad guy booty&quot;. I think it is an important and powerful feeling <br/>
and theme, which is why it is repeated over and over throughout the <br/>
history of children&#39;s tales.<br/>
<br/>
Another couple of pretty good cartoons with fun variations of that theme <br/>
  are:<br/>
<br/>
Jake Long: American Dragon (elements of chinese martial arts, culture <br/>
and magic)<br/>
<br/>
Ben 10: (sci-fi elements, aliens, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Tom<br/>
<br/>
p.s. Kim Possible has some pretty good music/video sequences too - we <br/>
always found &quot;The Naked Mole Rap&quot; to be particularly hilarious.</div>
