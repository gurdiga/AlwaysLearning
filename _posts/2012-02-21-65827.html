<div id="ygrps-yiv-344231368">This article on cnn.com: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/7colvdg">http://tinyurl.com/7colvdg</a> reminded me of the recent discussion here about carrying the 6 year old into grandma&#39;s house when she didn&#39;t have shoes. This article references the importance of refusing to carry a THREE year old - wow. This article is terrible - lots of rhetoric about &quot;coddling&quot;, &quot;hovering&quot; and waiting on kids &quot;hand and foot&quot;. If you want to see an example of the antithesis of unschooling and respecting kids, this is it. It could be critiqued, almost line by line, by anyone with a basic understanding of unschooling. I can hear Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s and Pam&#39;s, and others&#39; voices in my head rebutting every mainstream parenting principle it espouses :)<br/>

It *could* be critiqued, but there are a million more where that came from.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to read them. :-)<br/>
