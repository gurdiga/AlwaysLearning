<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083841013">Keith and I are off for an overnight trip, to hear my sister perform music in a bar in Chama.  I made a similar trip with four young people a couple of weeks ago, but that was more rushed.  Keith and I are goofing around.  As I write this, Saturday about dinner time, Keith&#39;s accidentally fallen asleep and I have no internet, so this will probably launch itself unexpectedly in the middle of the night or something, when the spotty wifi coughs up some power.<br/>
<br/>
On the way up here, we were talking about Holly, and Keith remarked on her confidence--that part of what made her attractive was that she has a confident presence.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s true.  She doesn&#39;t avoid eye contact, she has not a bit of ducking or shame or avoidance or anything.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share a description of herself on some website:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Singing, dancing, stretching, growing, farting, thinking, expanding, shining and dining. Seemingly random notes in between can be found here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like her confidence and lack of self-consciousness, even in something that casual.<br/>
<br/>
