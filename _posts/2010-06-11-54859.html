<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388846035">How do you deal with kids who lie? I would really like to hear from other parents about this. Not your own kids--but your kids&#39; friends. My kids have some friends who lie so consistently that the boys no longer believe what their friends say, and I have gotten skittish about saying things to the parents like, &quot;So, little Octavian says you&#39;re going to Las Vegas next week!&quot; because such things have so often turned out not to be true. I&#39;m struggling with how to respond to the children, and also with how to talk to my kids about this.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the lies seem to be face-saving lies. Eric beats a kid at a video game, so the kid tells Eric about how much better than Eric his brother is at that game. Or my kids mention an upcoming trip, and the friend tells a big story about the much bigger and better vacation he and his family are taking soon. Or a kid seems to want to cover up areas of ignorance, so confronted with, say, a video game he hasn&#39;t played before, he&#39;ll nonetheless make up a bunch of stuff about what happens in the higher levels (this is not exactly lying...it&#39;s something else, similar and part of a pattern of behavior but not quite the same). Caught out, he&#39;ll claim to have gotten the information from &quot;a friend.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know that lying is a common childhood thing, but in these cases it&#39;s a very consistent behavior that happens every time the kids are together. (About one of their friends, the quip about Clinton fits: &quot;Every word out of his mouth is a lie, including &#39;and&#39; and &#39;the.&#39;&quot;) The boys have caught on to it to the point that they will say to me or David, &quot;Octavian says he used to have a lot of really cool Legos, too, but he gave them away, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true.&quot; What do I tell the boys? Do I talk to them about the factors (like, in one case, economic disparity between homes) that might lead a child to lie like this? Do I counsel them to ignore lies because of the motives I think lie behind them, or to confront them?<br/>
<br/>
in one case, the parents have been very helpful in talking about it, but it seems like some of the strategies that work for them (like asking mildly, &quot;Is that something you know, or something you just think might be true, or something from your imagination?&quot;) don&#39;t work as well for me--I think this kid doesn&#39;t feel as safe with me, so he won&#39;t admit to having made something up if I ask that.<br/>
<br/>
In another case, when I mentioned &quot;Hey, your kid says this thing!&quot; and it turned out not to be true, the parent was angry and indicated she would punish her child for the lie, and I don&#39;t want to get kids in trouble, God knows, for what I think are most likely adaptive but not all that functional responses to situations that are challenging for them.<br/>
<br/>
In neither case is restricting visits a very good option right now. One of the kids is the son of my best friends, and he was only able to be taken out of school this year (which he desperately needed) because I agreed to keep him two days a week (we&#39;re down to one day a week now that his mom&#39;s job has ended for the summer), and there are a variety of reasons why, for the most part, I want the other one--a neighbor kid--to feel welcome at our home. The boys are not wanting less contact with their friends, at least not that they&#39;ve told me.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of sympathy for these kids but I am also frustrated and sometimes irritated, and just a few minutes ago there was a big fight when my kids challenged a friend and he got defensive.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for any ideas people have; I just want to get outside my own head with this and get some new ideas to mull over.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133029393">My children have several friends who do this. We call it telling &quot;tall tales&quot;. My children are 13 and 10. We have discussed the reasons these children might do this to help them understand. I have also had a lot of discussions with my 13 yro daughter about picking your battles, because she cannot stand lying. The only time I say something is if they take their lie a little too far, like talking about riding a wild bison. I usually keep this between the other children and us because their parents punish them and I feel bad when this happens. So far the only time I have told a parent was when another child stole from my daughter and she caught her. I was worried about her stealing from other children and not being caught.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it just economic disparity? Are there other reasons why these kids  <br/>
might lie? To feel important or powerful? To gain some control? To  <br/>
mitigate the lack of freedom they might have in their own homes? Do  <br/>
their parents lie to them? This was the situation with my daughter&#39;s  <br/>
friend. She was caught between her warring parents, her mother was  <br/>
really controlling and wavered between outright lying and telling her  <br/>
daughter the gruesome reality.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s worth talking about those things with your kids. They  <br/>
might have some good insights themselves on why they think these kids  <br/>
are lying - you can discuss those ideas. Do you think there&#39;s reason  <br/>
to be accepting of them, in spite of their lying?<br/>
<br/>
You can even talk about when lying might be justified. There are real  <br/>
reasons to lie. To protect someone else. To protect yourself. Talk  <br/>
about that in terms of ethics and social behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why you have to address this with the parents. Can you  <br/>
explain why you felt that was necessary?<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;lying is unequivocally wrong&quot; (and I&#39;m not say you are),  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t give kids much room to understand other people&#39;s  <br/>
motivations for lying. Using that &quot;Clinton quip&quot; about friends is  <br/>
pretty judgmental and harsh. And your kids are pretty young to  <br/>
understand the Clinton context, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when your kids hear what they think is a lie, they should always  <br/>
come to you, instead of challenging their friends. Challenging them  <br/>
won&#39;t help. You might consider talking with these boys in a casual  <br/>
way, sometime. Find out what&#39;s going on in their heads without  <br/>
directly addressing the lying itself.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps suggesting they ignore what their friends say, as if it&#39;s just  <br/>
a story and to take their stories &quot;with a grain of salt&quot; is a better  <br/>
way to deal with it at this point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the case of one kid, he is my best friends&#39; sons and this is a problem he&#39;s had for years--his preschool teacher was the first one to talk to them about it, and he&#39;s 10 now--that they&#39;ve been working on with him with little success.

I felt it was necessary because I wanted to be their partner, and for any response I made to be in keeping with the way they were choosing to handle it, rather than doing something that would inadvertently undermine their efforts.<br/>

other parents about this. Not your own kids--but your kids&#39; friends.  <br/>
My kids have some friends who lie so consistently that the boys no  <br/>
longer believe what their friends say, and I have gotten skittish  <br/>
about saying things to the parents like, &quot;So, little Octavian says  <br/>
you&#39;re going to Las Vegas next week!&quot; because such things have so  <br/>
often turned out not to be true. I&#39;m struggling with how to respond to  <br/>
the children, and also with how to talk to my kids about this.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t make chit-chat with the parents that could get the kid in  <br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the age, it might be something he&#39;ll grow out of.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t struggle.  Be matter-of-fact, and kind and compassionate.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Or my kids mention an upcoming trip, and the friend tells a big  <br/>
story about the much bigger and better vacation he and his family are  <br/>
taking soon.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend that my children not brag to the boy, if he&#39;s  <br/>
feeling sad that he doesn&#39;t have cool stuff to report.  They can play  <br/>
with him without getting into reciting what they have that he doesn&#39;t,  <br/>
maybe, especially if he&#39;s likely to cover over with bravado or  <br/>
bluff.    Maybe the kindest thing your own children could do would be  <br/>
to say nice things to and about the boy. Maybe he doesn&#39;t get enough  <br/>
of that.  Maybe he needs to hear that some of the things he knows and  <br/>
can do are cool and impressive.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was seven or eight he went through a season of saying  <br/>
things that weren&#39;t true.  I said various things but one was &quot;Do you  <br/>
wish that would happen, you mean?&quot; and gave him a chance to rephrase.   <br/>
Sometimes once he started the story he didn&#39;t know how to get back out  <br/>
of it.  I reminded him a few times how important it was to be  <br/>
trustworthy, and somehow he moved out of that into being very  <br/>
truthful.  We coached him gently.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The boys have caught on to it to the point that they will say to me  <br/>
or David, &quot;Octavian says he used to have a lot of really cool Legos,  <br/>
too, but he gave them away, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true.&quot; What do I  <br/>
tell the boys? Do I talk to them about the factors (like, in one case,  <br/>
economic disparity between homes) that might lead a child to lie like  <br/>
this?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Gently and in simple terms, maybe, yes.  Be careful not to give them  <br/>
things that they might repeat to the boy that would hurt his feelings  <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-Do I counsel them to ignore lies because of the motives I think  <br/>
lie behind them, or to confront them?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Neither.   I would help them think of ways to pass on by the  <br/>
situations without attaching to them.  If he says &quot;I used to have a  <br/>
dog like that,&quot; your kid could say &quot;Those dogs are pretty,&quot; not &quot;What  <br/>
was his name, then?&quot; or &quot;what happened to him?&quot; or &quot;I bet you  <br/>
didn&#39;t.&quot;   Neither entrapment nor argument will help the boy.  Maybe  <br/>
just diverting the stories into other topics, kind of changing the  <br/>
subject or saying something that is simple and doesn&#39;t say &quot;HOW COOL!&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;REALLY?&quot; would be better than either buying into the lie or  <br/>
calling it a lie.<br/>
<br/>
Saving face for the guest might be the boys&#39; goal.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would talk to the other-family kid one-on-one  <br/>
somehow, casually if possible, and say it&#39;s important to only say what  <br/>
REALLY happened.  It can be something that short.  Or if a longer talk  <br/>
is better, maybe:  &quot;When you tell a story, it&#39;s better to say &#39;I wish&#39;  <br/>
or &#39;wouldn&#39;t it be cool if...&#39; than to say it as if it were true.    <br/>
And be careful with the truth.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772194334">My eldest son had a problem with a friend who lied.  They are no longer<br/>
close friends because of this reason.  My husband dealt with it the<br/>
best--gently inserting the truth into a story to diffuse the situation. He<br/>
reassured the boy that we liked him whether or not he was a spelling bee<br/>
champion.  (This was highly unlikely as my son beat him at Scrabble prior to<br/>
his making that statement and he seemed to be quite a poor reader and<br/>
speller).<br/>
<br/>
My son never pretended to believe his friend, and a few times when other<br/>
kids accused him of lying, Rowan always calmly asked everyone what did it<br/>
matter if the boy had been untruthful or not.  One time this boy left in a<br/>
huff because other kids had accused him of lying and he expected my son to<br/>
back him that he had not cheated at a game. Rowan instead sided with the<br/>
other kids.  Rowan asked him friend to apologize, which offended D. I<br/>
overheard him telling the other kids after D. left that they shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
been so mean.<br/>
<br/>
My son often observed this boy&#39;s parents lying to avoid confrontations with<br/>
him.  My husband at one point drew the ire of the boy&#39;s mother by telling<br/>
him that his parents had told my husband that there could be no gameboy<br/>
playing during visits.  This led to the boy going home and crying for hours<br/>
according to his mother and this was inconvenient for her as she had a yoga<br/>
studio in her home.  She told my partner that he should not have told the<br/>
boys the truth about who was deciding about the gameboy play being banned.<br/>
This helped me be more patient, because I realized lying was part of his<br/>
family&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; way of living.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422356331">-=-So far the only time I have told a parent was when another child  <br/>
stole from my daughter and she caught her. I was worried about her  <br/>
stealing from other children and not being caught. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told fairly young kids (7, 10) that the thing they&#39;re doing is  <br/>
something adults go to prison for sometimes.  It could be theft or  <br/>
violence or severe sneakiness or bullying/extortion kind of kid- <br/>
behavior.   A couple of times other on discussion lists have said I  <br/>
was TERRIBLE and they would *never* tell their child that he could go  <br/>
to jail.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say the child could go to jail.  I said they were doing  <br/>
something as children that was wrong--so wrong that if an adult did  <br/>
it, he could be put in jail.   I wasn&#39;t playing &quot;I&#39;ll call the police  <br/>
right now&quot; boogey-man games with them.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose there might be quite a few people in jail who had mothers  <br/>
who thought it would be TERRIBLE ever to mention &quot;jail&quot; or &quot;prison&quot; or  <br/>
even &quot;police&quot; in front of their precious child.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not saying every time the neighbor claims he used to have 100  <br/>
rabbits you assume it&#39;s a lie and define misrepresentation or perjury  <br/>
to him (not that he would have sworn solemnly in a courtroom that he  <br/>
had 100 rabbits...).    I still think compassion and patience are  <br/>
good.   I&#39;m saying that IF a parent speaks to a child who&#39;s not seeing  <br/>
why some behavior or another one might be bad, it can be useful to  <br/>
say, &quot;No, really; a crime, if an adult does it.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I liked how Marina&#39;s son had the attitude of &quot;what does it matter&quot;... there&#39;s no use arguing with a lie, as a person who is using it to cope will often dig themselves deeper. Most of the  time, kids who lie have a good reason for doing so, even if we can&#39;t figure it out or address it with them.<br/>
<br/>
It may (or may not - you choose) be helpful to talk to your own kids about why a person may be lying... Robin&#39;s list is fabulous. I&#39;d add: To protect a fragile sense of self? To correct a sense of lack in who they are or in some other aspect of life? To avoid embarrassment or shame? To avoid getting in trouble? I&#39;m sure there are many more possible reasons that are compelling to the person who is lying.<br/>
<br/>
Some people lie compulsively and in that case appropriate therapy may be the helpful path. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t suggest that to a parent of my child&#39;s friend (or even to a family friend)... unless they brought it up.<br/>
