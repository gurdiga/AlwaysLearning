<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265432931">Just last week, my 2-year-old decided to call me, &quot;Mom.&quot; My mom cracked up when I told her Chloe was too little to call me mom; I was to be &quot;mommy&quot; until she was more grown up! All of this was said with smiles, but only half way in jest -- &quot;mom&quot; sounds a little too independent for me -- although, now that I type it, Chloe is about the most independent child I know.....<br/>

    Perhaps Mommy and Daddy feels more affectionate to <br/>
  them than Mom and Dad?  Have they said? <br/>
<br/>
  My kids call me Mom too.<br/>
