 </span></blockquote>Wait... there&#39;s Rick Springfield, who is kind of a glam-guy who tries to<br/>
look &quot;cool&quot; now, IMO, although I liked him when I was younger... he did a<br/>
very hard-to-find song (I think only recorded is Australia) called &quot;Speak<br/>
to the Sky&quot; that I just love, it&#39;s very simple and just nice.<br/>
<br/>
Bruce Springsteen, OTOH, is who he is, does an awesome show, and wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be caught dead doing Vegas, IMO... love him. &quot;Tie that Bind&quot; is my<br/>
favorite Bruce song, I used to play it over and over. He&#39;s got that hunky<br/>
&quot;working-class&quot; look, you could see him as a roofer or something...<br/>
