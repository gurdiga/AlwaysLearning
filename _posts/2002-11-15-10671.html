<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689662900">Harry Potter comes out today. We are all going, even though I had to half <br/>
threaten Moly if she mentioned even one more thing about the movie, she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go. I do believe that between the books, the commercial teasers, the <br/>
web site (s), Jay Leno, and all the others, Moly knows exactly what is going <br/>
to happen, what is in the movie that isn&#39;t in the book and what is in the <br/>
book. And she has told us all at least a thousand times a day for the past <br/>
three or more weeks. <br/>
<br/>
So here I am, taking a break from cleaning the house to check my mail, and <br/>
wish you all a happy Harry Potter (I mean Alan Rickman) day!<br/>
<br/>

PS. Shryley, My Mom sent me a box of birthday gifts, one was a book called <br/>
The Grand Canyon and the Southwest. It is full of beautiful photographs by <br/>
Ansel Adams. I love his work, and had a thought you might like his work too. <br/>
You should go see if your library has any copies of his collection in books.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Church of Rickman declares this day (and all the others) to be <br/>
Alan Rickman Day.<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen it yet. We&#39;re going Monday after the stampede is <br/>
over. I&#39;m sure DD will sit through it and complain about which bits <br/>
are different from the book. She did with the first one.<br/>
