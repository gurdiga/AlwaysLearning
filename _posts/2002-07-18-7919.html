Again, I played with my scanner.<br/>
Those with modems might need to get a cup of tea, because it might take a <br/>
minute to load (a whole minute, maybe two... I can&#39;t stand the slow pace of <br/>
life sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the last of the already-published essays to put in a public <br/>
place.  Some of the others already are out there in other places, and I think <br/>
I&#39;ve deposited the set of those that weren&#39;t yet on line.<br/>
