<div id="ygrps-yiv-981394221">When my kids want something that we dont have, sometimes I respond with &quot; yeah! That would be fun&quot; or &quot; yeah I wish we could&quot; but brightly and kindly. Sometimes we play a game building wild fantasies about what I would grow on trees if I could, like wii games and chocolate bars. It&#39;s fun and silly and they totally get into it. I ask them what they would grow on trees and we can imagine are the trees just for us or are they trees for everone, etc.  It&#39;s a playful way to ease out of a sad or whiny conversation about what we don&#39;t have or cant get right now. <br/>

&gt; feel I want to be sympathetic. I want to rock them and say &#39;I&#39;m sorry we can&#39;t buy that for you&#39;. But that this will just make them sad. I also know I need to be more positive. And that the children won&#39;t feel any loss if I can still create abundance, albeit in a different way. </span></blockquote></div>
