<h4>Jennifer and Scott Lynch</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428242868">Ahhh. . .I love the unschooling life!  I have read with great interest the<br/>
emails regarding porn, alcohol and (in the slightly distant past) guns and<br/>
swords.  I believe that those of us who choose to unschool do so because the<br/>
goals, priorities and methods of the Institution of School (capitalization<br/>
on purpose) do not match the goals, priorities and methods we wish for our<br/>
families.  Every person is unique and every family is unique.  School does<br/>
not recognize that.  School works to erase that.  No one has a definitive<br/>
answer that will work for all people in all situations. (I love when Sandra<br/>
asks for more info before giving advice!)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s family has a biological legacy of the disease of alcohol.  Her<br/>
attitudes, concerns and advice about it will be colored through her life.<br/>
People should read what she has to say and rejoice that they have heard<br/>
another perspective, check if it works in their life, if it does, HURRAH!<br/>
Apply it to your question or problem.  If it doesn&#39;t listen to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Same for porn/sex/computer wackiness. I think most of us would agree that<br/>
part of living an unschooling life is that freedom to choose is very<br/>
important.  I would be shocked if I found out that, for the people on this<br/>
list, the only acceptable images of sex would be procreative sex between a<br/>
man and a woman.  Come on!  I don&#39;t want to start a debate about porn.  I am<br/>
against the exploitation of anything against its will.  But I am 100% for<br/>
creative, interesting, unique and arousing ideas about sex.  For my family,<br/>
we have a healthy, stable, safe house and set of overall relationships.  Why<br/>
would/should looking at porn be any different than looking at seahorses,<br/>
gaming tricks or electrical circuit instructions?  Do it privately, ask<br/>
questions if you want, enjoy it if you want.<br/>
<br/>
As for guns and swords. . . I was fascinated by the discussion a few months<br/>
ago regarding the purchase of guns and swords for children who requested<br/>
them.  Until reading those posts I was very against the idea of even having<br/>
toy guns in the house.  The posts from people who bought their kids guns and<br/>
knives and swords and taught them to use them really brought completely into<br/>
the ethos of unschooling.  &quot;Damn!&quot; I said to myself &quot;What is my problem?&quot;<br/>
Somehow I had picked up the general idea that &quot;guns are bad,&quot; &quot;Having guns<br/>
will make a bad person.&quot;  My daughter has no interest in guns or swords at<br/>
this point in  her life.  I am thrilled that my eyes were opened to a<br/>
different way of thinking about it all because if she ever wants to take up<br/>
archery or target shooting or sword fighting I will be ale to say, with a<br/>
truly open heart, &quot;alright honey, let&#39;s get you what you need.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Every interaction (whether in person or online) is a chance to gather more<br/>
&quot;data&quot; for one&#39;s life.  File the stuff that makes you uncomfortable for<br/>
later (you never know when you&#39;ll use it) and embrace the stuff that feels<br/>
right that you had never thought of.<br/>
<br/>
I think this list totally rocks, I am so excited to read everything<br/>
everyday.  I love the &quot;day in the life&quot; posts most of all because it makes<br/>
me so happy to know that we are not the only family out there enjoying our<br/>
life so very much.  Keep all the great stuff coming everyone!<br/>

I *think* what she was saying, and what I say, is that<br/>
we don&#39;t separate learning into &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot;<br/>
learning....if my child had an interest in internet<br/>
porn, it wouldn&#39;t be any &quot;worse&quot; than if she had an<br/>
interest in anything else...it would just be an<br/>
interest.  My kids are 11 and 6, and I don&#39;t think<br/>
they&#39;ve seen any internet porn, although I do read<br/>
them the titles from emails I get and we all<br/>
laugh....My 11 yo has looked at sex toy sites, though,<br/>
and we have had long discussions about the pros and<br/>
cons of various vibrators....&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We were reading a book this morning together, called<br/>
&quot;Six-Legged Sex--the erotic life of bugs&quot; and we were<br/>
all laughing hysterically at the waterbugs who play<br/>
&quot;music&quot; on their penises to attract mates!  Sex is<br/>
interesting and funny and there&#39;s no reason NOT to be<br/>
interested in it!  :)<br/>

My daughter is 4.  She does not look at porn.<br/>
<br/>
I knew something in that post would end up as a &quot;hot potato&quot; and it looks<br/>
like that is the one.  I think Sandra and Dana&#39;s follow-up posts are helpful<br/>
in clarifying my point.  Why is porn any &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; than anything<br/>
else?  What will happen if my child sees porn?  What will happen if I forbid<br/>
porn? What is the overall principle I am trying to live by with regards to<br/>
access to information? What happens at the magical age of 18 that makes<br/>
seeing porn okay? Why is sexual activity, in all its myriad forms, so taboo?<br/>
<br/>
Sex and the sexuality of children is a really tough issue for a lot of<br/>
people.  There is a book called &quot;My Mommy Laid an Egg&quot; by Babette Cole.  It<br/>
is a hilariously illustrated account of two parents who are trying to tell<br/>
their children how babies are made and are giving them all sorts of<br/>
ridiculous explanations (they&#39;re found under rocks, squeezed out of tubes<br/>
etc.) The children roll their eyes and proceed to draw in vivid detail the<br/>
real story of sexual intercourse and fertilization for their obviously<br/>
misinformed parents.  There is a particularly hilarious page where the words<br/>
say &quot;These are some ways Mommies and Daddies fit together.&quot;  The<br/>
illustrations are of Mommies and Daddies engaged in intercourse hanging from<br/>
balloons, on a roller coaster etc.  I took it to my daughter&#39;s gymnastics<br/>
class to share with two of the mothers who asked for suggestions of<br/>
children&#39;s books about &quot;where babies come from&quot; for their children who were<br/>
asking.  All the moms laughed at the book and said it was great and all of<br/>
them said they wouldn&#39;t be able to read it to their kids, it would be too<br/>
embarrassing and it was too much information.  I was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your reactions and questions Leslie.  To be honest this is all<br/>
theoretical at this time.  If this list still exists years from now and if<br/>
my daughter ever starts looking at porn I will have to get back to you with<br/>
my reactions of the moment.  All our societal taboos around sex and pleasure<br/>
(whether from sex or food or whatever) are really puzzling and infuriating<br/>
to me.  That is a discussion for another place, I am happy to talk about it<br/>
off-list if you are really interested.<br/>
<br/>
All of these are just my opinions.  I like being able to express them!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Leslie, and Sandra and Dana!<br/>

My daughter is 4.  She does not look at porn.<br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
When someone says they will let their child eat all the candy he wants, I <br/>
think some people picture a kid in cartoon mode, surrounded by empty candy <br/>
wrappers, all bloated after a four hour binge.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that when someone says &quot;my kids don&#39;t have a bedtime&quot; some <br/>
might think kids just stay up for days.<br/>
<br/>
Those things don&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked Holly, who&#39;s watching the Simpsons next to me, whether she&#39;s <br/>
ever seen any porn.  I read her the rest of this post.  She said she never has.  <br/>
I asked if she&#39;s ever even walked in and seen something on the computer that <br/>
the boys were looking at.  No.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her if she&#39;d ever seen a Playboy or anything like that.  No.<br/>
At somone else&#39;s house, maybe?  No.<br/>
Would you like to?  She kinda laughed, and said no.<br/>
<br/>
(Keith has a small stack of stuff from the 70&#39;s up in a box in his closet.  A <br/>
former roommate moved out and left them, and they&#39;ve been in that box for <br/>
years.)<br/>
<br/>
I know Marty and Kirby have seen some, but they seem pretty open and calm and <br/>
Kirby&#39;s room is very rarely locked.  <br/>
<br/>
Saying it would be okay with a parent if a child wanted to watch something is <br/>
not even remotely the same as the parent providing a child with something the <br/>
child had shown no interest in.<br/>
<br/>
Holly knows she wouldn&#39;t be in trouble if she had seen porn.  She has no <br/>
reason to lie, and no reason to seek it out.<br/>
<br/>
Another question we get sometimes is whether people let their young children <br/>
see R movies with sex scenes.   Few young kids will even look at romance <br/>
scenes, and if kissing starts they&#39;ll say EEYEW!   Why would those kids want to see <br/>
sex?  They don&#39;t even want to see candlelit dinners with hand holding.  They <br/>
want to see dogs, and singing pickpockets and flying cars.  But if the parents <br/>
were willing, the children made a choice, and they chose not to.   If a child <br/>
HAD no choice, he might wonder or wish or want or feel deprived.  And worse, <br/>
he might wait for that promised day when he can do the forbidden thing.  And <br/>
after waiting five or ten years, y&#39;think he&#39;ll just forego his glorified reward?<br/>
<br/>

that.  i am extremely glad i did ask because sandra&#39;s answer did <br/>
make me think and made very good sense.  i think sex and porn were <br/>
not handled properly with me as a child and so i honestly don&#39;t know <br/>
how to handle it with my child.  i appreciate the responses.  i <br/>
really look to sandra and the rest of this group for guidance when i <br/>
feel i need it because i have never ever found people that i feel i <br/>
relate to like i do everyone here as far as lifestyle, beliefs, etc. <br/>
and i only found you all a couple years ago.  thank goodness too.  <br/>
