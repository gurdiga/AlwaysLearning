<div id="ygrps-yiv-114380574">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m needing advice, once again. Lewi is 6 and a half and for the past few months has developed a real interest for Warhammer. He&#39;s put his first set on lay by and we&#39;re trying to get hold of a rule book off ebay. I want him to have the freedom to go with this interest to wherever he wants to go. That&#39;s what the theoreist unschooler in me says (and I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;d all agree). The little voice inside of me though keeps saying: but he&#39;s far, far too young (Warhammer&#39;s really aimed at teenagers) and it&#39;s SO expensive to experiment with it if it&#39;s only going to last 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I have a really good idea what the responses to this will be, and I really am in need of them as I&#39;m finding it hard to be fuller free (inside my head at least) on this one and I want to be fully free.<br/>
<br/>
Also, are there any other younger kids, like Lewi, who do Warhammer and understand it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>
<br/>
Kim<br/>
Who&#39;s uptight about feeling restriction in my head again<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536574492">I have a friend whose son got interested in Warhammer around 8. Spent <br/>
lots of money but then went off it. Yikes! all that money!<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s 12 now and well back into it. So it wasn&#39;t wasted anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe Lewi will stick with it, maybe he won&#39;t. Maybe he will ditch it <br/>
for good, maybe he will come back to it.<br/>
<br/>
If you restrict his interests on the basis of cost and maybes, what will <br/>
he be able to do? Is there anything that couldn&#39;t be denied on this sort <br/>
of basis?<br/>

nothing I will not do my best to get for my son <br/>
(11½ years old) if he&#39;s really interested in it, <br/>
especially if he seems to demonstrate a passion <br/>
for it.  I&#39;ll move heaven and earth to make it <br/>
happen if I can.  I figure it this way:  If he <br/>
were in school, all kinds of big-time heaps of <br/>
dough (mine and the taxpayers&#39;) would be spent on <br/>
all kinds of things he&#39;s not even really <br/>
into!  It doesn&#39;t really matter if the interest <br/>
fizzles and dies; what matters is that he is <br/>
exploring these paths that excite him in the <br/>
moment, and that&#39;s good enough for me and even cause for rejoicing!<br/>

<br/>
Marty played ice hockey one  year.  It was the most expensive thing  <br/>
any of my kids have ever done.   He wanted to quit for a while, and  <br/>
after that I felt guilty and tried to encourage him to go again.  He  <br/>
only ever *kinda* wanted to.  But he has the memory and experience,  <br/>
and still goes to skate, still owns hockey skates all the time (when  <br/>
he wears a pair out or outgrows them, he gets another pair), and if  <br/>
he wants to skate anytime for the rest of his life, he knows what&#39;s  <br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby reminded me (to my embarrassment) that when he was young there  <br/>
was a certain scenario/RPG kind of game that I wouldn&#39;t buy him  <br/>
because it involved a lot of reading, and when he was older he ended   <br/>
up buying it for four times or so more than it would&#39;ve cost new, on  <br/>
ebay.  A friend of his had promised to give his to Kirby as soon as  <br/>
Kirby could read, but he just didn&#39;t (and when Kirby asked once, he  <br/>
said yeah, when he found it he would...).    I offered to pay for it  <br/>
(the ebay version), but Kirby had money.  He had just wanted to razz  <br/>
me.  I was ashamed, and really wish I had just gotten it for him.   <br/>
(But at the time I was afraid he would make me read it all to him and  <br/>
try to play with him, and I also had a two year old and five year old  <br/>
and was kinda... overwhelmed.)<br/>

Hi Cally,<br/>
Yes, you are sooooo right! I know this in my heart and I say this to others, I just need it said to me when I get into an occassional challenging mindset.<br/>
<br/>
So a big THANKS<br/>
<br/>
