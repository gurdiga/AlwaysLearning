<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156744372">The discussion of the alleged evils of computer games reminded me of  <br/>
an article in the current People magazine, about a girl who left with  <br/>
someone she met on the internet and was a captive for years, was  <br/>
rescued, and now is going around talking about it at schools.<br/>
<br/>
Her advice is AWFUL.  Terrible.<br/>
<br/>
Her experiences was awful and terrible too, but rather than talking  <br/>
to younger kids about what horrors can happen if they&#39;re captured and  <br/>
sexually abused and exploited, she&#39;s telling them not to be on the  <br/>
internet, and also telling them AWFUL things that won&#39;t help their  <br/>
self esteem a bit.<br/>
<br/>
In the article it says:  &quot;As she tells her audiences, &#39;There are lots  <br/>
of predators on the Web.  They are older than us.  Smarter than us.   <br/>
If you give them any information, they&#39;ll get you.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So she&#39;s telling them they&#39;re little and stupid--that they&#39;re too  <br/>
young and they&#39;re lacking in intelligence.<br/>
Yet she *KNEW* the guy was a liar.  He had pretended to be a girl her  <br/>
age.  When she found out he was really a 31 year old an (according to  <br/>
the article, &quot;She said she was mad for a few hours, then got back  <br/>
online with her friend because, in her mind, &quot;Christine was still  <br/>
Christine to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Welll.... She also arranged for the guy to come to get her, and got  <br/>
into the car and left.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s the list of Alicia&#39;s Tips for Online Safety (page 118,  <br/>
People Magazine, April 16, 2007):<br/>
<br/>
* Everyone is a stranger on the Internet.  Forever.<br/>
<br/>
* Never give anyone online any information about yourself.<br/>
<br/>
* Profile pages contain too much information about you.  If you have  <br/>
one, take it down.<br/>
<br/>
*  Use gender-neutral screen names.<br/>
<br/>
* One in five kids are approached by pedophiles while online.<br/>
<br/>
* Never have a computer in a private room or bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to comment on those in later e-mails.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910432194"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So here&#39;s the list of Alicia&#39;s Tips for Online Safety (page 118,  <br/>
&gt; People Magazine, April 16, 2007):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Everyone is a stranger on the Internet.  Forever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow! Crazy!  My daughter talks to people online all the time, some of <br/>
them by phone, and she definitely considers them friends, not <br/>
strangers.  I very much don&#39;t agree with that assessment.  Heck that <br/>
would make Sandra a stranger, even though I&#39;ve met her IRL.  I <br/>
admittedly don&#39;t know her well personally but if I saw her again, I <br/>
would say hello and be happy to see her, as well as her kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; * Never give anyone online any information about yourself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Profile pages contain too much information about you.  If you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one, take it down.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I see, is that most kids are really careful about giving out <br/>
personal info.  Even to the people they consider friends.  There is a <br/>
group of people that my dd regularly chats with, some she likes way <br/>
better than others.  For a long time she gaurded her real name, then <br/>
she held a bet sort of to see who could pronounce it right first.  <br/>
It&#39;s Chamille but pronounced with a K sound.  I think that everyone <br/>
knows everyone&#39;s real name now.  All of these kids are on the up and <br/>
up, most of them chat without their parent&#39;s knowledge or permission, <br/>
yet there they are.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of them through web cams and <br/>
heard their pubescent voices.  I&#39;ve answered the phone on a number of <br/>
occasions.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; *  Use gender-neutral screen names.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, now most of these kids my dd talks to use anime names or just <br/>
weird names.  However, you can generally tell what gender these kids <br/>
are by the things they say and the way they talk, or what anime <br/>
person they name themselves after.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; * One in five kids are approached by pedophiles while online.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There has been on occasion some weirdo online, but Chamille weeds <br/>
them out.  They don&#39;t get much say in the conversation, because these <br/>
kids are smart enough to tell, who is who, by computer ID&#39;s and how <br/>
they say things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; * Never have a computer in a private room or bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have laptops and wifi.  My kids are welcome to use the computer <br/>
anywhere they want to.  My oldest just turned 13 and as a present, we <br/>
redid her room.  It was a nice coming of age sort of present, take <br/>
all the little kid stuff and give her some style.  She loves her room <br/>
so much, we hardly see her anymore!  She used to sit out in the <br/>
living room and chat and stuff.  She has nothing to hide.  She shows <br/>
me stuff and occasionally asks me to join her chat room.  I know all <br/>
the kids that she talks to, by their made up names and real names.  <br/>
Some of their numbers are programmed into my cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
Just last night, my dd decided that she was bored chatting with her <br/>
online friends and requested time with me, just to chat and hang out <br/>
one on one.  We talked for hours and hours until I had to kick her <br/>
out because I was falling asleep and I wanted to turn off the lights <br/>
and go to bed.  It&#39;s possible that she went back to her room and <br/>
chatted online more.  I don&#39;t know.  I completely trust her.  I&#39;m not <br/>
afraid of the internet boogie man.  <br/>
<br/>
She likes being at home so much that she usually wants her friends to <br/>
come over to our house, instead of the other way around.  Quite <br/>
honestly, most of her friends prefer that too.  I seriously don&#39;t see <br/>
her wanting to go out and meet some 30 yr old man somewhere, just <br/>
because she met him online and he wanted to meet her.  She knows <br/>
plenty of 30 yr old men IRL to know that they&#39;re ok, but kids are <br/>
more fun to hang with.  The neighbor girl is much more at risk for <br/>
that because she hates her home, isn&#39;t allowed internet access, and <br/>
comes over here to use the internet and talk to people that her <br/>
parents know nothing about.  When I am uncomfortable with someone she <br/>
is talking to, I tell her and so does my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Right now the neighbor is grounded from my daughter, so who knows <br/>
what she&#39;s doing lately.  Our house is her safe house, and when it&#39;s <br/>
off limits, I have no idea what she does.  But that&#39;s a whole other <br/>
story...</div>
