<div id="ygrps-yiv-882273566">So, I&#39;m wondering how some of you handle things after you&#39;ve had your less-than-ideal unschooling moments.  For example, today I had my 3-week old daughter crying loudly in one arm while I was trying to wipe my 3 yo daughter&#39;s butt for her and my 7 y.o. daughter comes in shouting some question about the iCarly website.  I yelled something along the lines of &quot;Will you shut up, can&#39;&#39;t you see I&#39;m a little busy?&quot;  (straight out of my own mother&#39;s mouth, it seemed).<br/>
<br/>
I apologized to my older daughter after everything had calmed down, and explained to her about feeling overwhelmed, and how she feels if things are being asked of her when she&#39;s busy with something else.  In retrospect, I was wondering how I could have handled the apology better, because i&#39;m bound to lose my patience again sometime, and I don&#39;t want to turn an apology into a justification for why I yelled at her.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your ideas on what to do after the fact when you lose your patience.<br/>

But more important than that is to think carefully about what I could  <br/>
have done better to prevent the bad moment.   You only get a few dozen  <br/>

<br/>
I have been doing a lot of this careful thinking and today had somewhat a breakthrough with my middle daughter.  Her older sister has a way of &quot;pushing her buttons&quot; and will use words to get her going, and then she will end up hitting or doing something else physical out of her anger, and then she&#39;ll say &quot;it&#39;s her fault!!&quot;  In the past I would get angry myself (guess where she gets it from) or I would get stuck on telling her that what she does with her body is &quot;her fault&quot;, no matter what her sister does to her.  Well, today I really put that aside, I really was able to put myself in her shoes and realize how she felt and I was able to hold her and tell her I understood (not putting details here) but she melted and softened and I really was able to comfort her and help her deal with the feelings of anger and helplessness that she was feeling, and by her knowing that I &quot;got it&quot; she was able to &quot;feel&quot; that there truly was another option.  By empathizing<br/>
 with her it really helped ME too--  where in the past I would default into how I &quot;thought&quot; I should handle it, but when I was able to feel what she felt, and we really connected.   A potentially bad moment became a beautiful moment of relationship. <br/>
<br/>
I love what&#39;s happening in our family.  :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263284955">&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I lost it.&quot; is a really good response. If you want to explain how it wasn&#39;t about her and it was about how you were feeling in that moment, that&#39;s not a bad thing too. <br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have asked for her empathy in this moment, by comparing your frustration to when she might get frustrated. It seems like you&#39;re asking for her understanding by doing that - and you don&#39;t need her understanding or empathy. It&#39;s an unfair comparison anyway; as an adult you have far more resources than a 7-year-old, in terms of managing your frustration and overwhelm.<br/>
<br/>
You were asking her, by mentioning that, to NOT ask things of you when you&#39;re busy doing something else - something most 7-year-olds would have a very hard time remembering in the moment. And by putting her at bay, you could potentially miss a lot of the natural exuberance and excitement she has about things as they come up. Each moment is precious! <br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m going through a tough time - worries, PMS, etc. - I remember to take a deep breath FIRST, and look at my sons in their eyes. Really connect with them - then yelling isn&#39;t an option. It took practice! But now, yelling happens only in fun, and it&#39;s been that way for quite a few years.<br/>
