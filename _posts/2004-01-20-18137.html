You might want to google the &#39;Glad Rags&#39; brand of flannel pads... not to <br/>
necessarily buy (although they are nice people and a very small woman-owned <br/>
company) but to look at the design.  They&#39;re flannel pads with wings that <br/>
snap around the underwear.  If you had a serger or even a machine with a <br/>
zig-zag stitch, they&#39;d be easy to make.  I use them quite a bit and they&#39;re <br/>
very comfortable.  They even make really long ones for night-time <br/>
use.  Excellent designs.<br/>
<br/>
Just another option so you don&#39;t have to spend money on winged disposables <br/>
if you don&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
(and for what it&#39;s worth, for whomever out there mentioned it, some women <br/>
*never* get comfortable with tampons.  Not that you&#39;d ever pressure her to <br/>
use them if she didn&#39;t like them, but to just so you could let her know <br/>
that some other grown women find them quite uncomfortable as well.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448386387">That&#39;s what the ones I made look like (glad<br/>
rags)...She wants to use organic disposables when<br/>
she&#39;s out and about, because she doesn&#39;t like to carry<br/>
a purse, and she doesn&#39;t want to start just so she can<br/>
carry a bloody, used pad ;)  I understand completely<br/>
:)  I&#39;d proabably do the same in her case :)<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the company name, and the product info.  I would love to <br/>
create a pattern for these for my Dd who have never taken to the <br/>
whole idea of tampons.  I gave up tampons back in my thirties, and <br/>
now, in my late fifties, do not need anything.  But it would be great <br/>
for her to know she had this option, especially the extra long ones <br/>
for night use. <br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&gt;(and for what it&#39;s worth, for whomever out there mentioned it, some <br/>
women *never* get comfortable with tampons.  Not that you&#39;d ever <br/>
pressure her to use them if she didn&#39;t like them, but to just so you <br/>

<br/>
How could anyone pressure anyone to use them?  Mine tried them <br/>
because all of her friends were using them, but she simply could not <br/>
do it, could not bring herself to insert one.  So she rejected them <br/>
and has stuck with winged pads.  I stopped using tampons back in the <br/>
late 1970s when the TSS link with tampons first hit the media.  Then <br/>
there was the business about the little plastic things washing up on <br/>
beaches, which made me happy I had only ever used OB when I did use <br/>
tampons.  Glad to hear that lots of other women have considered and <br/>
chosen other options.  <br/>
