<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136683611">My kids are all alergic to milk and other food items but all to <br/>
differing degrees (from eczema to asmah(sp?) to skin rashes to upset <br/>
stomach and more)  I always tell them the result of eating such a <br/>
thing and (as long as they are not going to have asmah and wind up in <br/>
the ER) I let them have it.  Alot of the time they say but it tastes <br/>
so good and eat it.  I never understood this I would think it wasn&#39;t <br/>
worth it to them but alot of time they go for it (with other options <br/>
available).  I always said with alergies it will help them over come <br/>
the reaction (trying to slowly introdouce it into their diet) but I am <br/>
usually met with rolled eyes and people trying to convince my child <br/>
not to eat it.  Thanks for finally someone who gets what I am trying <br/>
to teach (them to make their own decisions).<br/>
<br/>
great board every time I read it <br/>
