<div id="ygrps-yiv-984381234">Like when I do the finances and put my cute little highlights and <br/>
stamp the bills PAID lolololol. I am really *playing* in my own head <br/>
even if I am actually taking care of real life business. I think <br/>
there is that &quot;SHIFT&quot; of thinking with many things. I believe my <br/>
perspective changes this??? :)It is hard to do on many a daily <br/>
chores, yet when I do this task I&#39;m right back to being 8 yrs old <br/>
and playing &quot;grown-up or Real estate&quot; in my *office*.<br/>

(who needs to go and look up Zoombinis as I have no idea what you <br/>
are talking about and am going on my own tangent??? :) )<br/>
