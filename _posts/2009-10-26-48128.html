<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770433157">Jill Parmer has a request for a topic chat.  I&#39;ll make a transcript of  <br/>
the Monday afternoon chat on this question:<br/>
What would you have done differently?  Especially if your unschooled  <br/>
children are teens or grown, what would you change if you could do it  <br/>
over?<br/>
<br/>
For some people the chat&#39;s inconvenient or they don&#39;t type fast or the  <br/>
font is small.  I know it&#39;s not for everyone.  So if anyone on this  <br/>
list wants to put some ideas out here, I could add some of those to  <br/>
the page with the chat transcript, too.<br/>

<br/>
Correct.  I&#39;ll keep the important good parts and put them on a page.  <br/>
And if people want to discuss the same topic here, I could save  <br/>
important good parts from here too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927261950">My kids are 12 and 16.<br/>
<br/>
I would have let go of more control over  TV, video games, and food much <br/>
earlier, or not ever started to control those things. I regret and am <br/>
embarrassed that I ever did it, and the controlling has bad results. <br/>
Most of them, but not all, are healed at this point- after 5 years or <br/>
more years since I got it.<br/>
<br/>
I would have responded more kindly and with less blame to my kids when <br/>
they were fighting. Getting angry at them repeatedly did not help them <br/>
be less angry with each other. Their relationship has not benefited from <br/>
any anger or consequences I inflicted on them before I figured it out. <br/>
At this point they do not fight, and rarely even argue, but are not <br/>
really good friends, either. Which they might not ever have been, as <br/>
they don&#39;t have all that many things in common, but I will always wonder <br/>
if they could have been.<br/>
