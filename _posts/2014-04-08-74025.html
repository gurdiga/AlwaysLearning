<div id="ygrps-yiv-185911807">For anyone who has thought about going to an Always Learning Live symposium, I have a few things to say:<br/>
<br/>
The next is soon, in Rochester, Minnesota.  If you are within range and can afford it, DO THIS.  I won&#39;t be travelling as much as I have been for long.  I want to do that one in Albuquerque in December, and let people come to me, more. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just back from Australia where there were four gatherings—three ALLive events (based on the Always Learning group) and one organized locally for just anyone.  The difference is profound.<br/>
<br/>
I would rather speak to a small group of people who have read here for a while and really want to understand more than a big group (or any sized group) of baffled folks, or skeptics, or people who come in as though I&#39;m running a sales meeting and they can obtain unschooling in one weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to harsh, I&#39;m trying to be encouraging of people who DO want to understand unschooling to consider the value of an in-person experience where you can meet other unschooling families.  Some might just be the good or bad examples of a day or two.  Some might be your friends for life.  <br/>
<br/>
May 29-June 1, 2014, Alex Polikowsky, Pam Laricchia and myself will be there to tell stories, share ideas and experiences, and answer questions.<br/>
<br/>
If you think you might attend, make a hotel reservation (and remember to cancel it if you can&#39;t get there).  More details are at the link below:<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t like for this discussion to carry announcements that are essentially local, but when I do a symposium called &quot;Always Learning Live,&quot; it IS about this discussion. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The richest parts of the Australian gatherings were when people who ARE familiar with this discussion asked questions.  Beginning at that level, the information soared.  <br/>
<br/>
There will be two more this year, after Minnesota:  Maine in September, and New Mexico in late December.  <br/>

The Minnesota event is soon, though, and nearer to very many of you than those other two are, so don&#39;t let it slip by if you need it and can get there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926683134"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1926683134ygrps-yiv-1312698403">We attended one of the Australian gatherings and can say without doubt that <br>
seeing and listening to Sandra in person (instead of on the computer from <br>
the other side of the world which can feel quite remote) and meeting other <br>
unschooling families and making some friends who we are now in contact with <br>
has been absolutely invaluable to getting close to what radical unschooling <br>
means, and we are pretty new to this way of life. We drove for two days to <br>
get there because we live on the edge of outback queensland which is far <br>
from, well, everywhere, and was totally worth the money and time away from <br>
work. We can now carry that experience with us now. Its so much better to <br>
have had that personal contact. Highly recommend getting along to an ALLive <br>
event!<br>
