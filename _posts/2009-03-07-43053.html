<h4>Pam Sorooshian</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165186285">Does anybody here create simple podcasts using a pc? I used to have a <br/>
mac and I used garageband to make podcasts and it was super simple. All <br/>
I want is one track of music and one track for a voice. I want to be <br/>
able to create mp3&#39;s from it.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be appreciated - maybe offlist, though, since it isn&#39;t <br/>
directly about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465812941">I have a Mac too but I think Audacity is what PC people use.  I use Audacity<br/>
to record because my podcasting co-host has a PC so she uses it too, then<br/>
she sends me her AIFF file and I mix everything in GarageBand.  But you can<br/>
use Audacity to mix too.<br/>

<br/>
Why on earth did you go from Mac to PC?  Or maybe I don&#39;t want to know.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659963251">I put those up here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
so those who like to look back at articles don&#39;t need to save those  <br/>
links.<br/>
<br/>
The first one has this quote:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Benny’s parents aren’t home-schooling in the traditional sense, by  <br/>
hewing to a curriculum, nor are they strictly “unschooling,” that is,  <br/>
following the teachings of John Holt, a progressive educator who  <br/>
promoted a child-led learning movement that is a wildly democratic  <br/>
subset of the home-schooling world. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Since I don&#39;t think of it as &quot;democratic,&quot; I don&#39;t like the idea that  <br/>
it&#39;s a &quot;wildly democratic subset,&quot; but it&#39;s just one tossed-off  <br/>
definition of dozens in the world.<br/>
