<div id="ygrps-yiv-948984934">Hi Nanci,<br/>
My two boys are a little older than yours but they<br/>
actually do well with all kids, younger than them is<br/>
better since my kids, especially the 13 yr old, don&#39;t<br/>
act &quot;older&quot; in the sense that teenagers who are in<br/>
public school act.  Somehow that doesn&#39;t sound right<br/>
but I&#39;m sure you get what I mean.  My kids thankfully<br/>
still act like kids which I love.  I also have 2<br/>
grandchildren who my kids adore, Joey will be 5 in<br/>
March and he is personality plus and Aaron will be 3<br/>
in April.  The kids are great with the little ones. <br/>
Going to the beach would be great.  The kids and I<br/>
were just watching home movies the other day and were<br/>
talking about how much fun we have going to the beach<br/>
and lifting up the rocks to see the little crabs and<br/>
things and generally exploring.  <br/>
<br/>
Are you back on this side of the state yet?  I was<br/>
sorry to hear about your husbands accident!  Does he<br/>
rent a place over there?  The reason I ask is that my<br/>
husband is staying in our travel trailer in Seattle<br/>
but he&#39;s going to have to move it soon since the house<br/>
where it&#39;s at is being sold and we&#39;re trying to find a<br/>
different solution that doesn&#39;t cost alot.... trailer<br/>
park, house or land sitting, park on someone&#39;s<br/>
property in exchange for my husband mowing their yard,<br/>
etc....  Any ideas?<br/>
