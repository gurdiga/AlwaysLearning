<div id="ygrps-yiv-111041629">When I used to go to so many La Leche League meetings, for years, babies “needs” were considered to be the same as babies’ wishes—that if a baby wanted something, there was a need.  A need for food, or comfort, or nearness, or of curiosity and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Today I came across an older Just Add Light entry that matched a newer one.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Being proactive will work better, more effectively and leave him less needy. <br/>
. . . .<br/>
&quot;It takes time and a greater focus at the beginning. It takes letting go, a lot, of your needs for down time or personal time or time to sit and chat with other people. But the more you do work to partner with your son, to help him before he needs help, to be with him more, the easier it will get and the less needy the relationship will feel.&quot;<br/>
—Schuyler Waynforth<br/>
<br/>
And recently, I quoted Sylvia Woodman, about food:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If I can bring someone a snack before they come tell me they are hungry it can make a real difference in the kind of day we are all having!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
When parents say their kids are whiney, maybe it’s because the parents didn’t provide in advance, sometimes!  (I’m thinking of specific instances with my own kids, when they were whiney because they didn’t have clean clothes, or were hungry, or couldn’t find something, or were being harrassed by a sibling.)<br/>
<br/>
Think of stories or propose general examples of ways to soften and strenghten the environment for unchooling.  Maybe this is an unschooling nest collection, and maybe it’s a service-as-a-gift set.<br/>
