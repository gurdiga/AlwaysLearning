<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300915182">Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean unparenting.<br/>
<br/>
If your child, whom you love and cherish, is about to do something that <br/>
might cause harm, than of course you should speak up.<br/>
<br/>
However, in my mind, simply because there are rules doesn&#39;t mean those <br/>
rules are fair or enforcable.  In your first example, the sidewalk has a <br/>
sign that says no running.  Why is that sign there?  You say it&#39;s an <br/>
incline, right?  Is it such down hill that if he runs, falling woudl be <br/>
more dangerous than just running on another sidewalk?  If so, then I&#39;d <br/>
point that out.  Hey, look Janene, there is a sign that says no running <br/>
(pointing out the sign), I wonder why it says that.  I might take her <br/>
hand and have a conversation.   In your second example, I think parents <br/>
have a responsibility to make sure their children don&#39;t damage property, <br/>
including that in a store.  My children don&#39;t stand on shelves simply <br/>
becuase we&#39;ve said, since they could do so, that&#39;s not a good idea, and <br/>
explained why. <br/>
<br/>
I have really decided recently that I do not like the term unschooling, <br/>
because un means no or not, and I don&#39;t like that connotation.  We learn <br/>
together as a family.  They are the children and Mark and I are the <br/>
parents. I am not more than they are, nor less, we just are.  We learn <br/>
together, but because I am older, I have learned more, especially, I <br/>
would hope, about how life works.  We talk a lot about lots of different <br/>
things.  I would like my children to learn through other&#39;s mistakes, and <br/>
not just their own.  If they could learn through my mistakes, the ones I <br/>
made not just last week but those I made as a child, than that&#39;s be great. <br/>
<br/>
Does a child really need to fall and break an arm in order to learn that <br/>
a sign posted on an incline indicating not to run might be something to <br/>
head?  Surely a logical discussion regarding that sign and the <br/>
conditions would work just as well.<br/>

When asked why (after all, my kids always ask why) I explain that the rule is posted by whatever authority there is, and is for his safety, because the people responsible don&#39;t want to see anyone hurt, and because it would cost them a lot of money if he got hurt or someone else was hurt.

Yes, in that example of the no running rule, and similar ones.  For example, at our neighborhood park there is a sign that reads No Fishing, No Wading No Swimming at the pond. Actually it&#39;s just a big drainage basin, but it does have fish, ducks and frogs -- it also has a rough concrete finish, and the water is beyond skanky and filthy.  The rule exists for a good reason.  Besides, the entire time they are leaning over the edge looking for fish, I&#39;m truly very worried someone will fall in and be hurt.  I realize it&#39;s obssesive, but it&#39;s one of my genuine phobias, so in that case, I&#39;m glad I can cite the rule and herd them back towards the playground.  Maybe I should more closely examine my motives, and how I respond.<br/>
 <br/>
   For that matter, it might be best if everyone just discounts much of what I say this weekend -- I&#39;ve just been thru an &#39;encounter&#39; with my Mom where she has AGAIN offered unsolicited advice for how I should be disciplining my children, the many mistakes I&#39;ve made with my oldest (and the current fall-out he&#39;s working thru) adn how I really need to look at my methods and make sure I prevent the same mistakes with the other two....  and I&#39;m a little defensive and scattered right now.   It&#39;s probably time for a personal rant into my journal.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling means &quot;not&quot; schooling. It means living without the <br/>
trappings of school. Maybe some day (maybe sooner than we think &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
learning will no longer be equated with schooling and even schooling <br/>
will no longer mean what it does today - lecturing, testing, imposed <br/>
curriculum, grades, assignments, and learning during specific <br/>
hours/days. Until then, it makes sense to me that we are defined by the <br/>
fact that we do NOT do those things - we do not do school. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
talk about what we do instead - but that is not what distinguishes us <br/>
from how other people educate their children. My oldest daughter went <br/>
to school until 4th grade. When she was in school she was schooled, but <br/>
she also learned &quot;naturally&quot; - she learned through games and <br/>
conversation and real life, just like she continued to do, later, as an <br/>
unschooler. The ONLY difference was that when she was in school she was <br/>
also &quot;schooled.&quot; We pulled her out and then she was no longer schooled <br/>
- hence, she &quot;unschooled.&quot; The natural learning just kept right on <br/>
going, through it all. While it is true that unschooled kids don&#39;t have <br/>
the roadblocks in their natural learning pathways that school sets up, <br/>
to say we are &quot;natural learners&quot; as if kids in school don&#39;t also learn <br/>
&quot;naturally,&quot; sets up a false dichotomy. Remember, much of what kids <br/>
learn in their lives is learned outside of school, naturally, even in <br/>
spite of lecturing, grading, homework, assignments, and <br/>
one-size-fits-all curriculum. Even though it takes up far more of their <br/>
lives than seems healthy to us, school isn&#39;t their ENTIRE life and <br/>
natural learning happens in schooled kids lives, too.<br/>
<br/>
In response to the question, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t the term &#39;natural learning&#39; be <br/>
more affirming than the use of the negative in the term &#39;unschooling&#39;?&quot; <br/>
Suzanne Carter, a poet and homeschooling mom, wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Lots of people make this point, but I never see the negation as <br/>
negative in a value-judgment sense when I use the word--to me <br/>
unschooling is as positive as unchaining, unbinding, unleashing, <br/>
unfolding, unfurling, unlimiting....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All mean freedom and growth and vast possibilities to me.&quot;<br/>
