<div id="ygrps-yiv-679385084">When the kids head to NBTSC in August dh and I will be spending the week<br/>
visiting the south west Oregon area from Bandon to Bend and Corvallis. We<br/>
would love to do some flat water kayaking.....small lakes and easy going<br/>
rivers would be best. We&#39;ve done a bit of paddling but would be best in<br/>
areas good for beginners. Anyone have any thoughts?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
