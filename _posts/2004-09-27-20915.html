<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535629315">I&#39;m interested in different ways unschoolers handle swearing. I know I have<br/>
a lot to get over myself (I just think they sound 20 degrees lower in<br/>
intelligence when swears are inserted into their sentences, like they can&#39;t<br/>
think of something more creative to say...my problem, I know), but I also<br/>
wonder if there are some reasons to encourage kids not to swear (I haven&#39;t<br/>
been able to think of much that makes sense). I have no problem listening to<br/>
other teenagers swearing while they talk, just my own. And so far, I haven&#39;t<br/>
said much, except an occasional &quot;that may offend so and so&quot; particularly to<br/>
the use of J.C. in their talk. I know intellectually that most swears are<br/>
actually disrespectful in their NON-use, because they come from one tribe<br/>
taking over another tribe and then making certain words from the loser<br/>
tribes&#39; language unacceptable...swear words. So logically it shouldn&#39;t<br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
After reading over this, I am more convinced this is my problem. I would<br/>
love to hear others&#39; thoughts however :)<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137265952">I handle this the same way that I handle my son wanting to wear dresses -<br/>
explain that I probably cringe because I&#39;ve been conditioned a certain way<br/>
but that logically there is no real reason that certain words are worse than<br/>
others. I tell them that my experience has been that for a very complicated<br/>
variety of reasons, people have developed all these weird ideas about what<br/>
kids should and shouldn&#39;t do, men and women should and shouldn&#39;t do, etc.<br/>
And as far as the swearing thing - I noticed that when you became an adult,<br/>
there were certain situations where it was not acceptable to swear and<br/>
others where it would be highly advisable NOT to swear. I&#39;ve always talked<br/>
about these cultural issues when I thought about or read about them and so<br/>
this is not a new discussion. I also believe - and share that belief that if<br/>
you are willing to take the consequences then do what you want - as long as<br/>
you aren&#39;t physically invading someone. If the other person can walk away<br/>
then do what you want but be prepared for the likely consequences. I make<br/>
sure they really get what the consequences are and if they complain later<br/>
about the consequences, I offer what I would to a friend - options about how<br/>
to change opinions of others - we do a lot of brainstorming about these<br/>
things. As a result - I rarely cringe anymore. I know my kids swear, but<br/>
they don&#39;t do it a lot around me - probably because I don&#39;t do it a lot and<br/>
when you remove the &quot;shouldn&#39;ts&quot; and replace it with &quot;when in Rome&quot; that&#39;s<br/>

After  reading over this, I am more convinced this is my problem. I would<br/>

<br/>
~~~<br/>
I&#39;ve always just tried to demystify cuss words.  (I&#39;m from  Arkansas.  Cuss <br/>
is an actual word. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
Kids at different times become enamored with the idea of cussing and they  do <br/>
it.  I&#39;ve offered a chance for my 10 yo to go in a room or somewhere no  one <br/>
will hear him, and just scream out all the cuss words he can think of.   He <br/>
wouldn&#39;t take me up on it.  At 10, many kids are way too modest and shy  and <br/>
afraid to break the &quot;rules&quot;, even if there very few rules.<br/>
 <br/>
If I had offered that at 6 (a time when he probably knew very few cuss  <br/>
words), he probably would have taken me up on it.   :)<br/>
 <br/>
But just talking about the idea of shouting out cuss words has helped take  <br/>
the mystery from them.  We talk about what they mean.  I say them, he  tries to <br/>
force himself to say them.  We make up euphemisms for them (cuss  words are <br/>
usually euphemisms for something else, so that&#39;s interesting,  too).  &quot;Holy <br/>
Shit-ake mushrooms!&quot;  We make up jokes with almost-cuss  words in them, or sing <br/>
songs that we know have cuss words in them.  He  still will bleep out the word <br/>
hell in a Barenaked ladies song that we  know.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have grown sons, and they both had a fascination with cuss words at  one <br/>
time or another.  I used to joke that they could cuss when they had  whiskers on <br/>
their face.  Of course, it was many years after they started  using cuss <br/>
words before they had whiskers.  When they were teenagers I  tried to make them <br/>
aware that some words just don&#39;t sound appropriate out of the  mouth of their 4 <br/>
yo brother, so to please use discretion.  But they had  already learned <br/>
discretion by using them in the wrong place, or being told when  it was okay and <br/>
when it was not.  It wasn&#39;t hard for them to pick that  up.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t really care if my kids swear.  I swear.  I don&#39;t swear in  front of <br/>
people who would take offense, or I try not to.  Today I used the  term &quot;pissed <br/>
off&quot; in front of some little kids that I didn&#39;t know well, and  while no one <br/>
said anything or seemed to care, *I* felt like I should have  censored my <br/>
language, and at least shown some respect for the fact that I didn&#39;t  know how <br/>
their parents would feel about it.  All of my sons have leaned  that direction, <br/>
rather than cussing with abandon no matter where they are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342325853">Thanks for your feedback Karen.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve offered a chance for my 10 yo to go in a room or somewhere no  one<br/>
will hear him, and just scream out all the cuss words he can think of.   He<br/>
wouldn&#39;t take me up on it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s so funny, because we do the same thing with our ten year old, only he<br/>
ALWAYS takes us up on it:) Come to think of it, it usually starts with him<br/>
saying, &quot;Can I say a whole bunch of cuss words?&quot; to which we always reply,<br/>
&quot;Sure!&quot; and the whole family often then embarks on trying to outdo each<br/>
other in creativity and combinations. This is sometimes in the car together,<br/>
or after a family meeting or some other time when we&#39;re all together and<br/>
someone is feeling feisty.<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t mystified swears, on the contrary, we have educated about swears<br/>
and where they come from, but my thoughts were around hearing my teenage<br/>
sons incorporate it into their everyday language. They both have spent time<br/>
with crowds of teenagers a lot lately, in particular having to do with the<br/>
band they are putting together, and I believe it is just the culture of what<br/>
they are doing. Also their dad is a frequent swearer, and I guess I can only<br/>
have so much control over this home environment that way.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess the struggle is: do I say something at this point when they have<br/>
been given the information already, or do I just leave it and let the world<br/>
around them give them the feedback?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;they both had a fascination with cuss words at  one<br/>
time or another.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My guys don&#39;t seem fascinated, just talk with swears mixed in. In fact, they<br/>
seem completely comfortable with it, almost oblivious to it. It&#39;s not at all<br/>
what I do, which is why I think it is an internal struggle for me, but one<br/>
that I haven&#39;t acted on too much, except like Karen said, to give them<br/>
information about how others tend to see this.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess that it is true that they know when NOT to swear, so they<br/>
probably see the whole picture just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751106724">You know - I certainly don&#39;t know what should and shouldn&#39;t be done - but I<br/>
keep coming back to my own intuition to treat kids like I would a friend in<br/>
a similar situation. If a friend was swearing a lot around me and it made me<br/>
feel uncomfortable - or say a friend of a friend started saying bigoted<br/>
stuff - I think it&#39;s my right to say &quot;Ya know - that really bothers me when<br/>
you say that.&quot; And if the people (whether it&#39;s friend of friend or my own<br/>
kids) have been raised with respect and know it&#39;s given to them then my<br/>
experience is that they try to respect other&#39;s wishes too - unless they have<br/>
damned good reason not to. I could see this conversation in a few years with<br/>
my daughter and maybe she&#39;ll make a point like &quot;I respect this mom but my<br/>
friends are hardly ever here and I&#39;d like to make them feel comfy - can we<br/>
expand our comfort zones for a few hours?&quot; or something like that. They<br/>
already do negotiations like this telling their point of view to counter<br/>
mine. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re also right about looking at the possibility that it&#39;s your own<br/>
boundaries - it&#39;s really difficult to know if you really see logic in<br/>
something or it&#39;s just so conditioned in you that you really have never<br/>
thought about it. I can&#39;t possibly count the number of times I&#39;ve come face<br/>
to face with that. We never realize how much of what we just accept actually<br/>
is simply tradition and we&#39;ve never really thought it through. Luckily, when<br/>
you allow your kids to be themselves (more and more as we are all evolving<br/>
in this ourselves) they grow up to challenge those ideas and help us in<br/>
expanding our minds. <br/>

When my  kids come across a new &quot;bad&quot; word or phrase we always <br/>
discuss it.   Sometimes it&#39;s helpful for them to know exactly what <br/>
the word or phrase  means, whether or not it&#39;s a &quot;bad&quot; word that&#39;s <br/>
also mean or hurtful (some  are and some aren&#39;t), what context they <br/>
heard it in, when it might be of  questionable appropriateness to say <br/>
as opposed to *definitely*  inappropriate to say, etc.<br/>
My kids also ask me about language they hear in  movies (the South <br/>
Park movie sparked a whole lot of conversation for  example).  If I <br/>
told my kids that I didn&#39;t particularly care to hear  about <br/>
what &quot;bad&quot; words they learned it would cut off a whole line of  <br/>
communication that&#39;s really important IMO.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I stress that there is no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; word----just more or in-  <br/>
appropriate times to use some words.<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron and I spent an hour drive going through all the names for male and  <br/>
female body parts. It was a good time! &lt;g&gt; He told me a couple I didn&#39;t  know, <br/>
and I gave him a slew of new ones! <br/>
 <br/>
In my dog world, bitch is MORE than acceptable. Duncan has heard at a  <br/>
friend&#39;s house that this is a BAD, BAD word (mom has some huge issue with it, I  <br/>
guess). We talk about dogs and bitches here all the time----it&#39;s just casual  <br/>
conversation. Dunc still gets upset when he hears it.<br/>
 <br/>
I cuss like a sailor (even on-line---just not on e-lists &lt;g&gt; But  watch out <br/>
if I IM you! &lt;G&gt;). I can &quot;control&quot; myself around my mother&#39;s  friends, around <br/>
small children, not-my-own, and out in public. The boys see  this; they follow <br/>
suit. It&#39;s not hard! It just involves thinking a little bit!  &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t care at all if they swear----I&#39;d just rather they know when  it&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006367177">&quot;None of my kids swear in the company of adults and only one swears much<br/>
with<br/>
kids (Hell and damnation are his favorites).  Dh and I rarely swear and not<br/>
in front of the kids at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering the ages of your children. I do believe that if they don&#39;t<br/>
hear swearing, they probably won&#39;t use it. Mine are 14 and 15 and have<br/>
entered a world beyond their home. That world includes teenagers who swear,<br/>
and I&#39;m not about to become prudish about it, or put my uptightness on that<br/>
situation. I have to question why it&#39;s bothering me.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The kids that have gone to school usually get off the bus from Kinder<br/>
telling me they learned all the &quot;bad&quot; words and did I want to hear them.  I<br/>
usually say &quot;not particularly&quot; and go about my business.  That is about the<br/>
most discussion we have ever had about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t this cut off an area of communication? I imagine that they really<br/>
want to tell you, and if they can&#39;t tell you, where  will that desire go?<br/>
<br/>
Honest questions.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, this is along my line of thinking. If people researched the history of<br/>
most swear words, they may be surprised at how calling a word &quot;bad&quot; is<br/>
actually contributing to the original bias of making the word &quot;bad&quot;. Because<br/>
I know this, it brings me to the question, &quot;Why am I bothered?&quot; Because of<br/>
my baggage. I don&#39;t think I have a whole lot compared to most people, but I<br/>
do have this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I cuss like a sailor&quot;<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can &quot;control&quot; myself around my mother&#39;s  friends, around<br/>
small children, not-my-own, and out in public. The boys see  this; they<br/>
follow<br/>
suit. It&#39;s not hard! It just involves thinking a little bit!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m pretty sure my guys are the same way...just swearing with their<br/>
friends. And because we discuss so much, THEY&#39;ve known the history of most<br/>
swears for a while, and make the choice to see them as no big deal...but<br/>
also they know that most people don&#39;t see it that way and I believe choose<br/>
accordingly. That&#39;s what they tell me anyhoo, and I haven&#39;t seen otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If a friend was swearing a lot around me and it made me<br/>
feel uncomfortable - or say a friend of a friend started saying bigoted<br/>
stuff - I think it&#39;s my right to say &quot;Ya know - that really bothers me when<br/>
you say that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree. But it doesn&#39;t bother me in the least when other people swear.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t ask them to stop, in fact there is something refreshing to me<br/>
when I hear someone breaking through those barriers (Kelly, I&#39;ve got to IM<br/>
you sometime!). Which is why I&#39;m understanding that this is more a hang-up<br/>
for me. My parents did not allow swearing, for the typical reasons and ones<br/>
which made no sense to me, did swear themselves on occasion, and I saw this<br/>
as OOOOOOOO, and the stigma was just ingrained.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that there is a little voice in me that says I will be judged<br/>
for my guys&#39; behavior. THAT could be a driving force as well :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input...it is very helpful.<br/>

I have generally just gently said something to the effect of, &quot;That word isn&#39;t really very polite.&quot; Often, the child hasn&#39;t thought about that and has just been trying out something new that they heard and, once they have this information about how it sounds, they don&#39;t choose that word again.<br/>

<br/>
Having done all three, I think there&#39;s a time and place for such things.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think uttering a word is the same as the other two, but my kids are all <br/>
very good about knowing their audience.   I don&#39;t say anything if they &quot;say a <br/>
bad word,&quot; but they have always used them in context, not as weapons, not to <br/>
hurt people, and not just for shock value.   So with them it&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Of my family, I&#39;m the worst to say something and my kids are the best at <br/>
elbowing me to remind me that there are younger kids or squeamish mothers or <br/>
unknown-element newer folk present.<br/>
<br/>
I like the opportunity to discuss the socio-political and linguistic <br/>
histories of &quot;bad words.&quot;   We&#39;ve been watching lots of English movies and video, and <br/>
the American/Brit differences are fun.  Holly likes Futurama, and the robot is <br/>
named &quot;Bender.&quot;  He bends things.  In American slang, &quot;a bender&quot; is a long <br/>
session of drunkenness.  And Bender drinks.   But then I had forgotten the <br/>
British English slang having to do with. . . one man bending another over.<br/>
<br/>
So when the end theme song to &quot;Money&quot; came on (from the second season of <br/>
Black Adder), there is a word which is NOT &quot;a bad word&quot; here, and a word Holly <br/>
likes because of Futurama, and we were afforded a discussion moment:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;. . .and if your finances do fail,<br/>
make sure your banker&#39;s  not a bender.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Blackadder, Blackadder,<br/>
he trusted in the church.<br/>
Blackadder, Blackadder,<br/>
it left him in the lurch.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925929021">Hahahahaa - you know - the other thing that concerned me about limiting<br/>
swear words is that for writers, they are absolutely necessary. I think an<br/>
ability to utilize the whole language is imperative and I hate the thought<br/>
of taking a chunk of pretty powerful words away - they also provide great<br/>
lessons on how language grows. They are really fascinating in many ways.<br/>
When you label something &quot;bad&quot;, you hide it away and it loses all that good<br/>
potential. Also, although I don&#39;t swear a lot - I find that in certain<br/>
circumstances, expletive communication is just what&#39;s needed - and as my<br/>
grandmother showed me long ago - when that sweet, Christian woman got<br/>
frustrated enough to utter the &quot;s&quot; word and an entire room went silent -<br/>
when you use them sparingly, they are a secret weapon of sorts. <br/>
<br/>
I tell my kids that story to show them the power and responsibility that go<br/>
along with certain methods of communication. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044493932">You know - this whole thread made me think of how bothersome certain slang<br/>
is to me and how I had to train myself to not just randomly squash THAT with<br/>
my kids more than swearing. I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;d rather be called a<br/>
swearword than &quot;dude&quot;. It just makes me cringe when I hear my babies talking<br/>
street slang. I remember handling this with my daughter when she was first<br/>
in school (very badly I should confess) - and you know - it&#39;s not been an<br/>
issue since they have not been in school. But eventually, I looked at it and<br/>
thought I need to handle this logically and without personal emotions - so I<br/>
just told my daughter what my fears were in relation to that - once I<br/>
figured them out for myself - and then I let go and let her decide. She<br/>
played with it for a while and then dropped it. I learned a valuable lesson<br/>
in the process - about myself, and how kids really learn - what they test,<br/>
what they hold on to. <br/>

<br/>
Years ago I worked at a print shop with three others and the owner.  We all <br/>
knew one another well and for years before we worked together.  The owner had <br/>
been an air traffic controller who went on strike in the 70s and so was <br/>
unemployed.<br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s running a print shop, with machines he had already had at home and he <br/>
knew well.   He is a very quiet guy (still in our lives, Holly&#39;s godfather), <br/>
and soft spoken in every way.<br/>
<br/>
Offset print shops can be very loud, and there was all kinds of ka-chuck and <br/>
slice and chop and sort noise all the time.  One day we heard Ray say clearly <br/>
and plainly (not yelling) &quot;DAMN it.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
The rest of us were in the front room and he was in back.  My first thought <br/>
was maybe he had cut his finger off or something horrible, it was so out of <br/>
character for him.  We all went absolutely big-eyed, non-breathing silent and <br/>
then tried not to laugh.   <br/>

<br/>
Words are neither polite nor impolite.<br/>
<br/>
It might be not very polite of a person to use a word in a certain place or <br/>
context, but the words are just mouth-noise.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up with people who would wash mouths out with soap (it didn&#39;t happen <br/>
to me but it happened to cousins and neighbors, and a teacher did it once at <br/>
school with that brown paper towelling and the yellow liquid soap--made a boy <br/>
hold his tongue out and wiped the soap on it), and spank for &quot;bad words.&quot;   The <br/>
damage of soap-in-mouth and spanking and the clear lack of regard for the <br/>
person were and are MUCH worse, in my opinion, than any word itself.<br/>
<br/>
If someone breaks a glass and says &quot;son of a bitch,&quot; that neither calls <br/>
anyone a bastard nor hurts anyone.   If they say &quot;Darn&quot; instead, that&#39;s just short <br/>
for God damn it to hell.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to get angry if we said &quot;gosh&quot; or &quot;guy&quot; because that was short <br/>
for &quot;gosh darn it&quot; or &quot;Golly&quot; which were short for &quot;God damn it&quot; or &quot;God.&quot;   <br/>
HUGE waste of air and energy for her to object to that, with a beer in one hand a <br/>
cigarette in the other.  It was almost as though she had wrecked her life but <br/>
she might still be somewhat redeemed if we were &quot;perfect.&quot;<br/>

OK---here is where the &quot;bad word&quot; pisses me off.<br/>
 <br/>
My niece, five at the time, said she wasn&#39;t allowed to watch &quot;Rugrats&quot;  <br/>
because of the &quot;bad words&quot;. Now, I&#39;ve watched enough Nickelodeon to know  that they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t allow certain words to be used on one of their shows. <br/>
 <br/>
So I asked, &quot;What bad word?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;The S-word!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I though a minute. They say *shit* on &quot;Rugrats&quot;?????<br/>
 <br/>
I questioned further----&quot;What s-word?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
She said, &quot;You know the S-word! SSSS       SSTTTT      &lt;whispering&gt;   ooooo   <br/>
 Stoooooo-----you know----stoooo      pid.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Riiiiight. The S-word!<br/>
 <br/>
So my niece isn&#39;t allowed to watch &quot;Rugrats&quot; because of the bad language!  <br/>
Shit! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

words were &quot;bad&quot;, but I wouldn&#39;t censor it for chrissakes!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344386503">Reminds me of a story my dad told me once about his time in Hollywood. He<br/>
was a comedian at the time and got some limited success then dropped out of<br/>
it. He actually got to do some writing for the tonight show and got a spot<br/>
doing his bit on the Dinah Shore show. He had all these jokes about &quot;stupid<br/>
people&quot; that were like ethnic jokes or blonde jokes but not bigoted because<br/>
ya know - it was about something you could control. And the producer, after<br/>
hearing his act in a rehearsal, told him he couldn&#39;t do those jokes because<br/>
they might offend stupid people. To which he replied &quot;Do you really think<br/>
stupid people would understand that they are stupid enough to be offended?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
OK---here is where the &quot;bad word&quot; pisses me off.<br/>
<br/>
My niece, five at the time, said she wasn&#39;t allowed to watch &quot;Rugrats&quot;  <br/>
because of the &quot;bad words&quot;. Now, I&#39;ve watched enough Nickelodeon to know<br/>
that they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t allow certain words to be used on one of their shows. <br/>
<br/>
So I asked, &quot;What bad word?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The S-word!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I though a minute. They say *shit* on &quot;Rugrats&quot;?????<br/>
<br/>
I questioned further----&quot;What s-word?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;You know the S-word! SSSS       SSTTTT      &lt;whispering&gt;   ooooo<br/>
<br/>
Stoooooo-----you know----stoooo      pid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Riiiiight. The S-word!<br/>
<br/>
So my niece isn&#39;t allowed to watch &quot;Rugrats&quot; because of the bad language!  <br/>
Shit! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &quot;None of my kids swear in the company of adults and only one swears much<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; kids (Hell and damnation are his favorites).  Dh and I rarely swear and<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; in front of the kids at all.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering the ages of your children. I do believe that if they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; hear swearing, they probably won&#39;t use it. Mine are 14 and 15 and have<br/>
&gt; entered a world beyond their home. That world includes teenagers who<br/>
swear,<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m not about to become prudish about it, or put my uptightness on<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; situation. I have to question why it&#39;s bothering me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The kids that have gone to school usually get off the bus from Kinder<br/>
&gt; telling me they learned all the &quot;bad&quot; words and did I want to hear them.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; usually say &quot;not particularly&quot; and go about my business.  That is about<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; most discussion we have ever had about it.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t this cut off an area of communication? I imagine that they really<br/>
&gt; want to tell you, and if they can&#39;t tell you, where  will that desire go?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Honest questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

To be more precise:  I would say something to the effect of: &quot;That&#39;s not a very polite thing to say&quot; (&quot;polite&quot; meaning:showing good manners towards others, as in behavior, speech, etc.; courteous; civil (Webster&#39;s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary pg. 1497) ) or, &quot;I&#39;m sure you could think of a kinder way of saying that.&quot;  Of course, this does not apply only to &quot;swearing&quot; or &quot;cussing&quot; or using derogatory slang it is about creating an atmosphere by the words (or other mouth noise) we choose and the emotions behind them. <br/>

<br/>
I see this issue as more of one of the talker&#39;s tone and intent. I agree<br/>
that words can not be polite or impolite. People are polite or impolite. I<br/>
think a person can say anything in a way that is loving, big smile, arms<br/>
extended, &quot;You big bastaaaard&quot; or with anger and spite, &quot;YOU BIG<br/>
BASTARD!!!&quot;. The tone is what is really heard. We sometimes say the nastiest<br/>
things to our dogs in the most loving and affectionate ways, just for<br/>
laughs, knowing that we truly are loving them, they know we are exuding love<br/>
love love, and in those moments we are showing the meaninglessness of the<br/>
words. The dogs are happy as anything, and know what we mean.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think calling people names in a seemingly joking way is a good idea.<br/>
My point is that words are often nothing on their own without the meaning<br/>
that people put behind them.<br/>
