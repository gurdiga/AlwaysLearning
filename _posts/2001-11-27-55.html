 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll have to look at that one.  We have two games for the Game Cube and<br/>
I&#39;m looking for something my children (6 & 4) could play.  We have<br/>
Jet Race and Luigi&#39;s Mansion.  (No choice : Nintendo gave the system<br/>
and the games to my husband since he was part of the team which designed it.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m impressed with the system.  When I was last working fulltime (7 years<br/>
ago) a system with those capabilities cost tens of thousands of dollars.  <br/>
Now you can get it for a lot less!<br/>

&gt; I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. I have suffered from severe perfectionism ever since I can remember. I&#39;ve had several failures in my life because of it, including flunking out of 2 colleges, one of which was a very fine Ivy League school. Perfectionism can truly paralyze you. A bad case of perfectionism along with clinical depression and very poor self-esteem can really mess you up. I&#39;m 42 now and I&#39;m much more relaxed.

 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t exactly brave or empowered of me, but I like to blame some of my perfectionism on the school system.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about testing, and grades and answers marked wrong in red that contributes to building perfectionism.  I especially don&#39;t like the idea that you are tested at one point in time, and if you don&#39;t know the answer at that moment, then you are wrong forever.  That seems to imply that you might as well not bother knowing it later.  Because you don&#39;t know something yet, you are downgraded in perpetuity.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I totally agree.  All of that can be very damaging to a child.  <br/>
And, depending on the individual, of course, deschooling may take years <br/>
and some of the damage done is irreparable.    But, from personal <br/>
experience, I believe that what happens, or doesn&#39;t happen, between a <br/>
child and the parent(s) can have a much more severe impact on the psyche <br/>
of a child.<br/>

someone who marked mistakes on kids&#39; work with a circled LO for learning <br/>
opportunity.  It&#39;s a step, anyway.<br/>

thought that if I did &quot;it&quot; perfectly my parents would love me.  My<br/>

making mistakes.  My son (who is younger) seems to have more difficulty.  He<br/>
went thru a period of time where he wouldn&#39;t try to draw anything because she<br/>
or I could do it better.  I would help him when he asked and now he&#39;s fine<br/>

My husband told me about some fairly interesting Psych research, that&#39;s
obliquely related to what you are talking about.
<p>They&#39;ve done testing using online simulations of gambling (slot machines,
I think), and found that the more variable the results, the more deeply
hooked the player is.&nbsp; (Measured by how long the test subject will
chose to keep playing for the return offered.)
<p>I can see how this applies to romantic relationships -- it explains
the whole &quot;playing hard to get concept&quot;.&nbsp; (Which I loathe!)&nbsp;
It can probably be extended to apply to parents a little bit.
<p>I&#39;m struggling with my relationship with my dad right now.
