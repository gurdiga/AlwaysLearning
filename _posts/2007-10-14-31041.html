<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990786793">I have a friend, adult friend in his late 30&#39;s, who isn&#39;t the most  <br/>
reliable.   I was frustrated because when he says he will do  <br/>
something he won&#39;t.  To be fair, the friend who introduced us told me  <br/>
so early on.  &quot;If he says he&#39;s coming over, don&#39;t expect him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But still...  I live in hope and all that.<br/>
<br/>
So twice so far this weekend he&#39;s not been where he said he&#39;d be, and  <br/>
it&#39;s a little inconvenient for me, but the bit inconvenience is that  <br/>
I expected him to be there!<br/>
<br/>
I expressed this to Marty, who knows us both well, and he said that  <br/>
when a friend says &quot;I&#39;ll call&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll come over&quot; and Marty knows  <br/>
it&#39;s not likely to actually happen, that he says &quot;That would be nice!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just perfect, and I hope to remember to use it, or at least  <br/>
think it. It&#39;s positive and non-committal, and excuses them right up  <br/>
front, I think.<br/>
