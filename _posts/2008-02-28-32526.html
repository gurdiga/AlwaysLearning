Not Returning to toxic grandmas&#39; house<br/>
Yesterday we went to my parents house. Mostly because My son did not<br/>
see papa for many months. As we were pulling up my mother and sister<br/>
were also arriving. As my mother got out of the car and saw us, I<br/>
heard her say to my sister&quot;oh,she&#39;s with him&quot; (my son) this was not a<br/>
happy statement. We went in and My son was sitting on the floor. She<br/>
stood over him and very loudly said&quot; You look like a girl!&quot; because he<br/>
has long hair. I waited to see if my son would say something. He did.<br/>
He said: I am a boy with long hair! Then she loudly said&quot; I don&#39;t like<br/>
it! Nice grandma tio insult a chid huh? She has a favorite grandchild<br/>
&quot;C&quot; because C is the daughter of her favorite son. She is always<br/>
saying what a doll she is. If that had been C sitting on the floor, no<br/>
way in hell would she had said that! My mother was talking to me one<br/>
day about her other great grandkids how ugly they were. Can you<br/>
imagine a grandmother saying that??? Luckily my dad came home but she<br/>
did manage to scowl at my son a few times. She is a sicko. It is sad<br/>
she can&#39;t find any joy in her grandchild. She also talks so rudely to<br/>
my dad&#39;s friends and customers that they hardly call. If you call and<br/>
she anwers she&#39;ll screech&quot;Who&#39;s this?!&quot; She never has come to our<br/>
house for my son&#39;s birthday or xmas. I told my DH what she did<br/>
yesterday and he wanted to know why i didn&#39;t get in her face and ask<br/>
her what her problem was when she was getting out of the car and<br/>
said&quot;oh,she&#39;s with him&quot; I told him it woudn&#39;t do any good. The real<br/>
sad thing is DS had a normal,loving Grandmother who passed away. I<br/>
think these things about her are enough reason to keep my son away<br/>
from her,for good, don&#39;t you? On the rare occasions we visited there<br/>
when Lukas was smaller she did strange harmful things to him that i<br/>
caught her doing and stopped. Once she opened the fridge trapping him<br/>
against the door of it and the wall edge and was just looking at<br/>
him,slighty pushing it to see if he would move. She put steak knives<br/>
on the table within his reach, refused to move pots off the front<br/>
burners when she invited us for dinner. She is sadistic! How can<br/>
someone be so miserable? When she was over my late M.I.L house for<br/>
Lukas&#39; 2nd b-day she was the only one not smiling. I think it&#39;s best<br/>
to sever all ties don&#39;t you? She is in her 70&#39;s. I didn&#39;t mention how<br/>
she screams in the background when i&#39;m talking to my dad on the phone<br/>
and other people said she does the same. She gives me the 3rd degree<br/>
when i want to speak with my dad:what do you want him for? Tell<br/>
me,why? He&#39;s sitting in the living room,tell me and i&#39;ll tell him! It<br/>
is very hard to get to talk to my dad. I told him he doesn&#39;t desrve to<br/>
be treated that way but he says&quot;oh that&#39;s your mother,she&#39;s from<br/>
Brooklyn,N.Y.   huh? Never met anyone like that from there.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659189667">You get to choose your friends, but you don&#39;t get to choose your family (or do you?).  <br/>
Anyhow, just because someone is family doesn&#39;t mean you HAVE to be a family with them.  <br/>
It sounds like not only for the sake of your son, but for YOUR OWN mental health, put <br/>
some distance between you.  Doesn&#39;t sound like she comes to your house, so that problem <br/>
is already solved.  Meet your dad for lunch or coffee out.  Call him at work or on his cell <br/>
phone.  I am sure you can find a way to stay connected with him, but keep the toxic away.<br/>
<br/>
We too have the hair comments.  My boys have longer hair and almost on a daily basis, <br/>
someone calls them girls.  Usually it is a stranger that honestly thinks they are girls and <br/>
says something like &quot;oh look, you have three girls&quot;.  The boys usually let these comments <br/>
slide off their backs.  They are used to it, the strangers are making an honest mistake and <br/>
they boys know that they are capable of ending these mistakes by getting their hair cut.  I <br/>
will take them any time they with to get their hair cut but they like it long and I think they <br/>
are very handsome.  Now, family and friends feel that it is okay to be more rude.  We <br/>
constantly get &quot;when are you going to cut their hair&quot;, &quot;they look like girls&quot;, &quot;I can&#39;t believe <br/>
you let them have their hair that long&quot;.  To which I always calmly comment, &quot;it&#39;s their hair, <br/>
if they want it cut, they can get it cut, if not, they can have it how ever they want it&quot;.  I <br/>
don&#39;t even bother having a conversation with anyone about it.  Good grief, it is just hair <br/>
and it is THEIR hair!  A year or more ago, Dh was having a really hard time letting go of <br/>
the hair control.  I asked him, &quot;would you make the boys grow their hair long if they didn&#39;t <br/>
want to  but you wanted them to have long hair?&quot;  He answered, &quot;of course not&quot; to which I <br/>
replied &quot;interesting&quot; and let him ponder it a bit.  He got the point.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Years back dh weighed a lot less ( whispers so did i ) and had a beard and hair down his back. He looked remarkably like jesus , was called jesus by most of our friends and would do his crucified pose . <br/>
   <br/>
  He decided to cut it 4 or 5 years ago to take a job in it at a casino <br/>
