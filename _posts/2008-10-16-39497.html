<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155532330">&quot;...nor are they strictly &quot;unschooling,&quot; that is, following the<br/>
teachings of John Holt, a progressive educator who promoted a child-led<br/>
learning movement that is a wildly democratic subset of the<br/>
home-schooling world. Rather, theirs is an ad hoc, day-by-day<br/>
exploration into what it means to be a stay-at-home parent and child in<br/>
an accelerated culture like New York.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm wildly democratic subset... Is that what I do with my kids?  Our<br/>
life is more ad hoc, day-by-day exploration, but not about the meaning<br/>
of being a stay at home parent and child.  Eww that sounds terribly<br/>
boring.  What we do is more of an ad hoc exploration of the world that<br/>
we live in.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting article.  It really causes more confusion about unschooling.<br/>
The label is kind of tossed around in a &quot;yes we are doing that&quot; and &quot;no,<br/>
we are doing something else&quot;.  That was a bit confusing to me.  I know<br/>
how overwhelming it is to have a 5 yr old and choose not to put them in<br/>
school though.  It&#39;s very life altering!<br/>
<br/>
The comments are fun, in a train wreck sort of way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283962764">Well....  :P~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
To my way of thinking it would be hard to find a more wide open fun<br/>
environment to homeschool or unschool in.  The only drawback being the idea<br/>
(according to some) that homeschooling is not good enough to measure up.<br/>
New York City is a great place to visit for sure and there are times when I<br/>
think I would like to live there if I could only afford it.  It&#39;s a such<br/>
wonderful place.  What&#39;s all this with New York being so set against<br/>
homeschooling!?<br/>

<br/>
New Yorkers are famously opposed to everything in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a song in a Marx Brothers movie:<br/>
<br/>
I don�t know what they have to say,<br/>
It makes no difference anyway --<br/>
Whatever it is, I�m against it!<br/>
No matter what it is or who commenced it,<br/>
I�m against it.<br/>
<br/>
Your proposition may be good<br/>
But let�s have one thing understood --<br/>
Whatever it is, I�m against it!<br/>
And even when you�ve changed it or condensed it,<br/>
I�m against it.<br/>
<br/>
I�m opposed to it --<br/>
On general principles I�m opposed to it!<br/>
<br/>
Chorus: He�s opposed to it!<br/>
In fact, in word, in deed,<br/>
He�s opposed to it!<br/>
<br/>
For months before my son was born,<br/>
I used to yell from night till morn,<br/>
Whatever it is, I�m against it!<br/>
And I�ve kept yelling since I commenced it,<br/>
I�m against it!<br/>

That&#39;s different, though.  That&#39;s a joke on parents telling their  <br/>
kids &quot;Just say no&quot; (even in the 1700s or whenever).  I made all-state  <br/>
mixed choir using an &quot;art song&quot; version of &quot;Oh No John&quot; as my try-out  <br/>
piece.<br/>
<br/>
The cynical attitude some people adopt as their way of being has to  <br/>
do with the idea that if you find fault with things, it proves you&#39;re  <br/>
smart.  That causes some god-awful music and movie reviews, some  <br/>
crazy advice columns...   There are kid attitudes that survive into  <br/>
adulthood, where a sigh, and eye-roll and a comment in the range of  <br/>
&quot;that&#39;s boring&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s stupid&quot; passes for conversation and opinion.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to avoid it when you can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804546897">Yup, it is different but it really did remind me of that song  :)<br/>
What you said about saying no also reminded me of the Fantastiks which<br/>
is all about saying no (especially the song &quot;Never say No&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the connection wasn&#39;t relevant enough to post.  Sorry about<br/>
that!  It did remind me of rules versus principles (and why rules<br/>
alone are silly) so I thought it would be interesting... but still not<br/>
what was being discussed<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re in a nest of critical cynicism, though, which might be part of  <br/>
why it seems harder to unschool there.  Everyone&#39;s a critic (and not  <br/>
in a nice or a funny way).   There are some other unschoolers there,  <br/>
but there seems to be a lot of class/neighborhood fragmentation that  <br/>
might make it difficult to create a cohesive get-together group.  I  <br/>
could be wrong, for sure, and I hope the article does stir enough  <br/>
discussion or info-sharing that there might be others to step off the  <br/>
path with.<br/>
<br/>

nyc tends to be a culture of money, money, money. its a status thing.  <br/>
it seems that the<br/>

<br/>
Though it might not be as universal in other places, I see that  <br/>
hugely with Holly&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s family.  Parenting is proven with  <br/>
receipts.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; For months before my son was born,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I used to yell from night till morn,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever it is, I&#39;m against it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I&#39;ve kept yelling since I commenced it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m against it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
