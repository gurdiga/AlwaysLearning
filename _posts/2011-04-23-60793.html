<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392574564">I am still conflicted on the topic of swearing with young children.<br/>
I just reread some previous posts on the topic, and they make sense but it seems to be one of those things that I have issues with so maybe I need some direct input.  My 8 year old has been experimenting with swearing since he was 3 at grandmas and said &quot;Sh--&quot; and then<br/>
&quot;F---&quot;.  (My husband swears, he stopped for a while and so did my son.) I was not sure how to handle that with them or him. He has sworn at park days though to my knowledge stopped when I told him that it is not very appropriate if you are not around others that swear. They will say things like &quot;Hey, Hell is in Hello&quot; and &quot;Oh, are we reading &quot;Little Bitches&quot; again.  I am thinking it would be more useful to be glad they are experimenting with words. My middle son will sometimes shout obcentities at his brother when he gets mad.  I guess the spirit of some swearing gets to me.  It can sound very vulger to my ears.  Also, my oldest flipped off my sister the day after seeing Mrs. Doubtfire, there is a scene where Robin Williams flips someone off who he was mad at.  My sister had been less than nice with him a few minutes before so I understood it.  We discussed that it is not really a nice thing to do even if someone has made you mad.  Wondering how others have talked about swearing (or flipping off) in their house.  I am pretty sure my issue is that I just don&#39;t like it and don&#39;t want it to become part of our daily language as well as the concern of what others will think.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472894760">I have definately asked him to stop.  Going down a different road here, any suggestions to help kids stop behaviour that seems to overtake them?  I am not having a ton of success with helping them redirect behavior in certain situations, especially lately.  When the middle son 7, sees something as unfair from the oldest 9, he may lash out either physically or verbally. I have tried offering suggestions or having them come up with their own alternatives to hitting or swearing but they seem to get for gotten in the moment.  Maybe I should reread your &#39;breath&#39; article.  Should I just get in there and gently but physically remove one of them from the room?  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever lead them to believe that hitting is okay and we discuss it but lately they seem to be getting into it more.  I have been pondering and discussing it with the boys (with some success at diverting fights) and there are certain areas that are triggers; situations were the older tries to control the play or activity of the middle, the oldest is not a great sport and won&#39;t be out when he is out and is often in denial of wrong doing (said he did not see the scene of RW flipping someone off in Mrs. Doubtfire).  It is frustrating for the middle son.  I have talked to the middle about the olders behavior and have let him know that I see what he is doing but haven&#39;t yet figured out how to help him not be like that.  <br/>
What did Holly do instead of hit her brother when she got mad?  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m inclined to think part of the issue is that you&#39;re thinking &quot;talking to your kids&quot; is going to somehow solve the problem. It&#39;s not uncommon for kids to experiment with swearing etc, or to play potty-mouth games with friends and siblings. The main difference is that when kids are punished for it they do it a little less in front of parents. Sometimes that will mean they do it More behind parents&#39; backs, too. <br/>
<br/>
By all means go on letting them know when it is and isn&#39;t appropriate to cuss or flip someone the bird, but be aware that being their partner means they&#39;re going to trust you to give them that feedback - which means they&#39;ll try things out in front of you. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My middle son will sometimes shout obcentities at his brother when he gets mad.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***************<br/>
<br/>
How does his brother feel about that? If his feelings are hurt, then its important to step in, separate them maybe, talk to them in private to give them a chance to cool down and come up with some better tactics for next time. But the brother - you didn&#39;t say older or younger, just middle - might be fine with the swearing part and then it isn&#39;t such a big deal. <br/>

<br/>
Then it would be a good idea to intervene more and sooner. Give the kid who&#39;s mad a chance to cool off and the kid who&#39;s feeling attacked a chance to escape (and sometimes they may both feel both ways!) so they can think again. Over time, getting away can become a valuable strategy for some people! Ray will often walk away from situations that are getting too &quot;hot&quot; - now, I mean, at 17, but at 9 he could still blow up pretty quickly if he was feeling like an underdog. Giving him a chance to get away and cool down helped a lot. <br/>
<br/>
How to do that is going to depend a lot on the situation. Sometimes it can be enough for a parent to step in the middle of an altercation with a firm &quot;Stop!&quot; and then shoo the kids away from each other or take one in another room with you. <br/>

<br/>
If you have ever failed to gently but physically remove one of them from the presence of the other, you have led them to believe that hitting is okay.<br/>
<br/>
Not &quot;gently but physically,&quot; necessarily.  Maybe suddenly and loudly and verbally.   Remaining calm when someone is being hurt isn&#39;t a virtue.  It makes it seem as though the agression isn&#39;t worth getting upset about, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-What did Holly do instead of hit her brother when she got mad? -=-<br/>
One or two of these:<br/>
Talk to me.<br/>
Leave the room.<br/>
Object to the behavior.   <br/>
Yell &quot;Stop.&quot;<br/>
Say &quot;When I&#39;m 18 I&#39;m gonna HIT you&quot; (if it was Marty, maybe).<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I have talked to the middle about the olders behavior and have let him know that I see what he is doing but haven&#39;t yet figured out how to help him not be like that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I did, lots of times, with my two boys:<br/>

<br/>
I disagree.  Many a younger brother will say &quot;that&#39;s okay&quot; about various forms of abuse, to avoid further abuse when the parents aren&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
If a battered wife is fine with the occasional violence and it isn&#39;t such a big deal to her, it&#39;s still considered wrong, bad and a crime.<br/>
<br/>
Even in cussing someone out, there is a range.  If they&#39;re playing halo and one just got shot and calls the other an asshole, that&#39;s kind of part of the game.  There are other times and ways and circumstances when it would be an attempt to wound deeply, and that&#39;s not cool.<br/>

I disagree. Many a younger brother will say &quot;that&#39;s okay&quot; about various forms of abuse, to avoid further abuse when the parents aren&#39;t there.<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
As the youngest of four, I know first hand that it is way easier for a sibling to say that it is okay to be abused (physically or verbally) than it is to speak up. When I was a kid, I knew that it was always best to keep my mouth shut if my siblings did something I didn&#39;t like. If I spoke up, I knew that I would pay one way or another. One of my sisters would tell mom when the rest of us did mean stuff (even if she was part of it). That sister received lots of abuse from the oldest ones. It would have been nice if somebody had spoken up for us so that we didn&#39;t have to worry about silently suffering or getting paid back. Without a vigilant parent that will stand up on the behalf of all of the children, it is no longer safe environment. <br/>
<br/>
If one of my younger ones does something to my oldest, my oldest will sometimes say, &quot;That&#39;s okay mom&quot; and I will say, &quot;No it isn&#39;t.&quot; I don&#39;t want any of my children to ever think that abusing another human being is okay. Sometimes I use strong words to convey that message. I will physically intervene if necessary because I will not tolerate my children purposely hurting each other or anyone else. <br/>

better now, you need to be the one doing it. Be more present to change  <br/>
directions when things head down hill. Help them with better ways  <br/>
until they can do it themselves. Coach them. But the peace is your  <br/>
responsibility not theirs. If they could be more peaceful it sure  <br/>
would make your job a lot easier! But it&#39;s not up to them. It&#39;s up to  <br/>
you. Just as it was up to you to transport them until they could walk  <br/>
on their own. It would have been easier if you didn&#39;t have to carry  <br/>
them, but you did until you didn&#39;t need to. Same with this.<br/>

&gt; not work, you go find an advocate (parent or older sib) to assist  <br/>
&gt; you in dealing with the conflict. If none of the above works, THEN  <br/>
&gt; you can hit. Well, we never get to the third phase, because the  <br/>
&gt; advocate always works. :) I coach them a lot as to &quot;you could try  <br/>

chose not so great solutions to help them see where the kids&#39; seeking- <br/>
of-a-better-solution broke down.<br/>
<br/>
It will help to see that they have needs they want to meet. They don&#39;t  <br/>
want to hurt others, but the needs loom large and they&#39;re still in the  <br/>
crawling stage of getting to those needs in ways that aren&#39;t direct.  <br/>
No matter how much you want them to walk, no matter how much you  <br/>
explain the process of walking, you can&#39;t get them to walk until  <br/>
they&#39;re able.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  She got that from me. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It was my way to deal with hitting.   If they didn&#39;t follow the procedure, they couldn&#39;t hit.   (The assumption was that if they did follow the procedure, they might get to the point that hitting was acceptable.)<br/>
<br/>
First, talk about it.<br/>
Second, get a grownup&#39;s help.<br/>
Third, hit.<br/>
<br/>
So if Marty said &quot;Kirby hit me,&quot; I didn&#39;t have to harangue Kirby about why hitting is bad, or make him apologize, or any of the regular things people do.  I just said &quot;Did you talk to him first?  Did you tell him what you were mad about?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the answer was no, I just said, &quot;Next time, talk to him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the answer was yes, I would say &quot;Then you should&#39;ve asked me to help.&quot;  Or, &quot;Did you get a grownup&#39;s help?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And those questions weren&#39;t asked in a sing-songy or entrapping way, at all.  Honestly asking.  And eventually they could checklist themselves.<br/>
