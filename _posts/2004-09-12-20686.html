<br/>
I think there are some flaws in the logic of your response. And I think the<br/>
flaws are caused by:<br/>
<br/>
1) the word unschooling being defined differently by different people. So<br/>
when people say HEM isn&#39;t about unschooling and you say you are, you aren&#39;t<br/>
all using the word unschooling to mean the same thing. Some people who write<br/>
to you are using unschooling to mean radical unschooling. You&#39;re using the<br/>
term to cover a much broader range of practices from radical unschooling to<br/>
wanting to dip their toes into learning by living.<br/>
<br/>
2) assuming that since HEM in your view is an unschooling magazine and<br/>
people are saying only Sandra&#39;s column was unschooling, that must mean the<br/>
complaints are from Sandra&#39;s supporters and they mean no more than &quot;Sandra&#39;s<br/>
supporters&quot; are outraged at a perceived injustice towards Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
First, I&#39;ll tell you how I define radical unschooling so we&#39;re on the same<br/>
page about that! ;-) Radical unschooling, too, gets defined differently by<br/>
different people. *To me* radical unschooling means applying the philosophy<br/>
of trusting children to learn from living to all aspects of their lives<br/>
including parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I think good things *beyond* reaching the unschooling audience HEM<br/>
is targeting can come from keeping the definition of unschooling broad and<br/>
presenting learning by living in the personal story way that HEM does. As a<br/>
wonderful *side effect*, HEM&#39;s gentle way presents a &quot;user friendly&quot; view of<br/>
unschooling to those who may even be outside of homeschooling. :-) There&#39;s<br/>
so much all unschoolers are learning about how children really learn that<br/>
flies in the face of conventional (school based) knowledge of how children<br/>
&quot;need&quot; to learn. And it&#39;s great to have a venue where outsiders can see<br/>
inside unschooling, can see that children don&#39;t need to be taught to learn,<br/>
without being turned off by ideas that are too radical.<br/>
<br/>
So, when people say HEM isn&#39;t about unschooling, I bet many of them mean it<br/>
isn&#39;t about radical unschooling and that HEM isn&#39;t addressing the needs they<br/>
have as radical unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
Whether HEM should try to meet the needs of radical unschoolers (as I&#39;ve<br/>
defined them) or not is a separate issue from recognizing how the needs of<br/>
radical unschoolers differ from unschoolers (using a broader definition).<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschoolers aren&#39;t content to take from unschooling only what<br/>
they&#39;re comfortable with. They want what they perceive as the whole shebang.<br/>
:-) They want the effects that radical unschoolers talk of: the relationshp<br/>
and personal effects that come from completely trusting their kids<br/>
personally and academically.<br/>
<br/>
*In general*, for unschoolers (using the broader definition) I think the<br/>
goal is to do what they feel is best for their children. They&#39;re going to<br/>
take what they feel are the best parts of unschooling for them and cobble<br/>
something together that works for their family. What they need and how they<br/>
go about making it work it can&#39;t be defined by anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
But radical unschoolers (*in general* and as I described them), on the other<br/>
hand, do want something specific. They want to get to a specific place. But<br/>
conventional parenting and schoolish thinking are road blocks for many of<br/>
them. The personal stories in HEM aren&#39;t as useful to them because they<br/>
already understand the benefits of (radical) unschooling. What they don&#39;t<br/>
know is how (and why it&#39;s helpful) to think in new ways, and how they can do<br/>
something that makes them uncomfortable while they work on eliminating<br/>
conventional thinking roadblocks, so they can make radical unschooling work<br/>
for them. And they value the hard questioning that goes on in places like<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion and Unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately that more direct presentation of radical unschooling thought<br/>
is the antithesis of what many unschoolers (as defined more broadly) need.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling *is* an idea that exists separate from Sandra&#39;s writing<br/>
about it. Sandra just makes it sound so obvious which is one of the reasons<br/>
her writing is so popular! But the idea of radical unschooling is doing well<br/>
on the unschoolingbasics list (that Ren Allen started when you changed the<br/>
name of Unschooling-101) without Sandra. (Over 300 members and very busy.)<br/>
The hard questions are being asked, the conventional assumptions are being<br/>
challenged. The lists are meeting the needs of radical unschoolers in ways<br/>
that HEM isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Not that HEM should necessarily try to meet the needs of radical<br/>
unschoolers. I don&#39;t think the needs of people who want to the take parts of<br/>
unschooling they like are compatible with people who want to challenge their<br/>
own thinking in order to get the whole shebang are compatible. (And why the<br/>
lists suffered too many blow ups.) But to dismiss people who are complaining<br/>
about Sandra&#39;s dropped column as &quot;Sandra supporters&quot; is to dismiss the needs<br/>
of radical unschoolers who make the UD and unschoolingbasics lists and<br/>
Unschooling.com boards so busy.<br/>
<br/>
I said recently that I wouldn&#39;t mind participating in a &quot;radical<br/>
unschooling&quot; (and/or &quot;radical unschooling parenting&quot;) corner of a message<br/>
board like AOL used to have where the full range of unschooling is<br/>
discussed. I think it&#39;s valuable for unschoolers to see -- even if they<br/>
don&#39;t want to do it -- how far it&#39;s possible to let go and still raise great<br/>
kids. The knowledge that a conventional practice is a choice not a necessity<br/>
can be very freeing. :-) Frankly, I think radical unschoolers&#39;s needs are<br/>
met by discussing radical unschooling ideas amongst each other on the lists<br/>
and boards that serve them (and the new magazines that have come out in the<br/>
last year). But it doesn&#39;t help other unschoolers see how far it&#39;s possible<br/>
to let go since the lists and boards are more oriented towards people who<br/>
already know they want radical unschooling or are sure they want to know<br/>
more about it, not to people who are causaully curious.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hello &lt;name withheld&gt;,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for taking the time to write and share your concerns with me.<br/>
&gt; A number of people have written about the same concerns, but I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been very busy with family matters these last few weeks and have not<br/>
&gt; had a chance to respond to anyone until now. If you have the<br/>
&gt; opportunity - via discussion lists, message boards or other forums -<br/>
&gt; perhaps you could share my reply here with others who are concerned<br/>
&gt; about the changes we&#39;ve made at HEM regarding Sandra Dodd. It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; necessary, of course, and I&#39;ll be trying to find those who wrote<br/>
&gt; earlier and reply to them directly, but their contact information may<br/>
&gt; be lost to me by now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I share your disappointment about Sandra&#39;s column no longer<br/>
&gt; appearing in Home Education Magazine. I&#39;ve always loved the wonderful<br/>
&gt; way Sandra could put words together to convey a thought or an idea or<br/>
&gt; a concept - that&#39;s why she was selected to be an HEM columnist in the<br/>
&gt; first place. Her writing has a special quality, a clarity of purpose<br/>
&gt; and a way of making the reader feel as though they, too, can do all<br/>
&gt; the wonderful things she writes about doing, whether it&#39;s making math<br/>
&gt; simple and easy to understand or sharing music with her kids and<br/>
&gt; friends and family or just enjoying the simple wonderfulness of<br/>
&gt; watching her children figure things out for themselves. She could<br/>
&gt; write it all down in a way that made you feel like you could do all<br/>
&gt; of that and more with your own kids. Her writing is clean, pure, and<br/>
&gt; honest, and those qualities do not come through in everyone&#39;s writing<br/>
&gt; like they come through in hers. If it was ONLY about the writing, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; certain that Sandra would still be writing for HEM, but her writing<br/>
&gt; was only a small part of a much larger situation which led to our<br/>
&gt; making the decisions we made.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I understand it there has always been plenty of Sandra&#39;s writing<br/>
&gt; available online, not only at her own website but at many other<br/>
&gt; sites, forums, discussion lists, and in books and magazines. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think her absence in HEM will be much noticed by those who want to<br/>
&gt; read her writing, as I believe she wrote far more for other venues<br/>
&gt; than she ever wrote for our bimonthly magazine. She&#39;s a very prolific<br/>
&gt; writer and a tireless advocate on the lists and forums. In that<br/>
&gt; respect, HEM was never much of a source for those who wanted to<br/>
&gt; benefit from her writing and discussions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the same time, it has struck those of us here at HEM as odd that<br/>
&gt; people think there has been some significant change in the magazine.<br/>
&gt; Almost everyone associated with HEM - the publishers, editors,<br/>
&gt; writers, columnists, office staff and various others - are all<br/>
&gt; unschoolers at heart, all believe pretty much the same kinds of<br/>
&gt; things Sandra has written about and promoted, and have always worked<br/>
&gt; hard to share the unschooling philosophy with our readers. The odd<br/>
&gt; attitude that Sandra&#39;s column was the only thing worth reading in HEM<br/>
&gt; and it&#39;s not worth subscribing if she&#39;s not going to be writing for<br/>
&gt; it is a somewhat bizarre revelation to us - and it tells us all that<br/>
&gt; this is much more about Sandra&#39;s faithful followers defending some<br/>
&gt; perceived wrongdoing than about anything truly relating to our<br/>
&gt; magazine. That also strikes us as bizarre because we&#39;ve always<br/>
&gt; thought true unschooling was about finding one&#39;s own path and not<br/>
&gt; simply dogging someone else&#39;s footsteps to learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always loved what John Holt had to say about that concept: That<br/>
&gt; true leaders don&#39;t look around to see who&#39;s following them, they<br/>
&gt; simply move ahead doing what they think is right and good and in<br/>
&gt; doing so they empower others to do the same for themselves. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what we&#39;ve been doing at HEM for over 20 years, and it&#39;s what we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; continue to do for the next 20.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again for writing,<br/>
&gt; Helen<br/>

<br/>
Well this is the crux of why I never responded to the magazine the few times<br/>
I got hold of a copy. My needs *are* mostly being met by the lists, and my<br/>
less frequent reading of the boards - where I would mostly lurk for the sake<br/>
of getting a good dose of the rad stuff especially when the lists were<br/>
quiet. Also I am enjoying the other mags most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But it doesn&#39;t help other unschoolers see how far it&#39;s possible<br/>
to let go since the lists and boards are more oriented towards people who<br/>
already know they want radical unschooling or are sure they want to know<br/>
more about it, not to people who are causaully curious.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And this point is the reason why I think it&#39;s a shame that Sandra&#39;s column<br/>
has been removed.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has posted that she is OK with that situation and grateful for the<br/>
past opportunities. However the response to subscribers&#39; assorted<br/>
dissatisfaction has by no means been as gracious.  <br/>
<br/>
Which brings us back to the boards and what will end up happening to them,<br/>
and more importantly those wonderful voices (like Lyle) who are (were?)<br/>
there but not on the lists. Anne O. has recently joined Basics, for the<br/>
information anyone here who didn&#39;t know, although I believe she has<br/>
previously been more active on the boards by preference for the format<br/>
presumably. There is so much in the archives that it would be a shame to<br/>
lose also.<br/>
