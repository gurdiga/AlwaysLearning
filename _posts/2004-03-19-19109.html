<div id="ygrps-yiv-160600336">This is an interesting conversation.  I wonder if it<br/>
is a genetic predisposition, some kind of hunter<br/>
gatherer sensativity to certain textures.  Maybe it<br/>
has to do with racial heritage, or maybe it&#39;s just a<br/>
random thing.  I know that I am almost all Irish, and<br/>
I can&#39;t eat (either from allergies or from dislike)<br/>
many tropical foods, like coconuts, bananas, avacados,<br/>
and others.  Then again, I adore lemons, and those are<br/>
not cool weather fruits, so it&#39;s probably just a<br/>
coincidence, but an interesting one.  I grew up in a<br/>
household where cooking was considered a high art, and<br/>
in a city world famous for it&#39;s restaurants, with<br/>
parents who liked to eat out , travel and eat out, and<br/>
to host gatherings where food was a focal point.  They<br/>
were in gourmet clubs for many years.  So I had<br/>
exposure to many different incarnations of foods<br/>
bearing the items I dislike, prepared very well, but<br/>
was still never able to eat them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hey I did this with my son in law.  He hates tomatoes<br/>
&gt;he said.  I asked him when the last time he tried<br/>
&gt;them, after all he loves sauce and ketchup.  <br/>
&gt;He willing tried it again after admitting it had been<br/>
&gt;years, shook his head no and went to the trash. <br/>
&gt;Something about the texture. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is me too.  I love sun dried tomatoes, tomates in<br/>
stews, sauces, pizza, etc, but fresh tomatoes, blech! <br/>
Unless they are cut up very small.  I guess it&#39;s<br/>
textures.  I always peel them off sandwiches and<br/>
burgers and things like that.  I peel off the warm<br/>
wilty sauce covered lettuce too, puke!<br/>
<br/>
My husband, when we first got married, had dislikes to<br/>
a lot of foods, like a number of vegetables, many<br/>
different dishes (like meatloaf, or pork chops) many<br/>
spices, and other things.  I was dismayed at the<br/>
limitations in what he said was appealing to him for<br/>
me to cook.  It turns out that almost all of these<br/>
dislikes are due to his being raised in a household<br/>
without very impressive cooking, where vegetables came<br/>
out of the freezer or a can, a lot of margarine was<br/>
used, and everthing was boiled and overcooked.  I&#39;m a<br/>
pretty good cook, and I use mostly fresh ingredients,<br/>
always of good quality, lots of herbs and spices,<br/>
enjoy experimenting and have a pretty good sense of<br/>
what tastes and textures go well together.  I have<br/>
never cooked anything that he tasted and didn&#39;t like. <br/>
Almost without exception he raves over it.  <br/>
<br/>
Now my meatloaf, pork chops, stuffed peppers, steamed<br/>
veggies and many other things he never used to eat are<br/>
his favorite things.  Just this morning he was doing a<br/>
little happy dance because he got to take leftover<br/>
meatloaf to work for his lunch.  He loves getting all<br/>
kinds of envious comments from his coworkers when he<br/>
heats up his good smelling lunches and dinners at work<br/>
(he teaches night classes.)  He&#39;s learned to be quite<br/>
a good cook in his own right, making things from<br/>
scratch, baking bread, and using spices with<br/>
confidence.  He often marvels at how he is eating<br/>
something with relish now (like a big salad with lots<br/>
of veggies, or candied yams) that he never would have<br/>
even wanted to put in his mouth before.  It makes me<br/>
wonder how much of some food dislikes are due to<br/>
environment or limited experience and how much are<br/>
just inborn. <br/>
