<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749109191">I know there was conversation recently about sprains,<br/>
but a lot of the advice was about putting weight on<br/>
it, recognizing a break, and wrapping it.  None of<br/>
this really applies in the case of neck injury, so I<br/>
could use a little advie/reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday afternoon my five year old came out from the<br/>
computer with his head cocked to one side, crying and<br/>
in pain.  At first we were thinking that it was just<br/>
one of those painfull &quot;pops&quot; or overextensions, or<br/>
whatever those are, which hurt intensely for a few<br/>
moments and then ease off.  But by evening he was<br/>
still crying when he tried to move his neck around,<br/>
even after heat and ice, tylenol and rest.  He was<br/>
sitting at the computer when he did this, just twisted<br/>
it wrong or something.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been giving him tylenol to reduce inflamation<br/>
and for pain, and icing the spot on his neck.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to take him to the doctor if they are just going<br/>
to cause him pain and cost us money to tell us to have<br/>
him rest and take tylenol.  I read about pediatric<br/>
neck injuries on the internet last night, and that&#39;s<br/>
all they really said.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, he&#39;s not crying anymore, but he whines<br/>
and complains when he tries to move his neck wrong, or<br/>
when we have to move him.  He&#39;s been in our bed,<br/>
propped up when he wants to eat or read, with a U<br/>
shaped buckwheat hull pillow supporting his head. <br/>
He&#39;s eating and drinking fine, awake and active with<br/>
arms and legs, and annoyed at being stuck in bed, just<br/>
doesn&#39;t have full rotation on his neck.  He can rotate<br/>
fully to one side, and put his chin down, but not<br/>
touch his chin to his chest, and cannot tip his head<br/>
back or towards the injured side.<br/>
<br/>
He can walk, when he has to go to the bathroom or<br/>
wants to eat at the table briefly, but it&#39;s hard for<br/>
him with his neck injury, and he wants to go lie down<br/>
afterward.  He needs help sitting up and lying down to<br/>
keep fro using his neck.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else we should be doing or red flags<br/>
we should be looking for or anything?  Anyone have any<br/>
experience with this type of injury?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473239346">My only thought is if you have a chiropractor that you trust or can get a<br/>
good reccomendation I would consult with them.  If it&#39;s muscles there may<br/>
not be anything they can do, but if he moved and something moved out of<br/>
alignment that could be helped.  We swear by our chiro and just went through<br/>
a week of visits for a massive ear ache and in the end I think it cleared up<br/>
faster because of her advise and treatments than if we&#39;d gone the antibiotic<br/>
route.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929020035">Carrie,<br/>
This is the first I&#39;ve heard of a chirp for infection! Can you point me in the right direction? Brianna is having big trouble w/ antibiotics.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202151335">I have known of strains to occur because of extended computer time.<br/>
Usually the computer screens are not at the right height, so there can be<br/>
an over extension of muscles.  Others have recommended a Chiropractor.  I&#39;d<br/>
like to suggest an Osteopath or Craniosacral Therapist.  I prefer their<br/>
treatments over Chiropractors; they are not as jarring and personally I<br/>
think they are more in tune with what the body is already doing to fix<br/>
itself.<br/>
<br/>
Also, along the lines of infections and antibiotics.... There is an<br/>
excellent book called &quot;No More Amoxicillian&quot; (written by an MD) which<br/>
discusses why antibiotics are overused in this country, why they don&#39;t<br/>
really help ear infections, and then she gives some really simple massage<br/>
techniques that can be used to clear infections (they boost the person&#39;s<br/>
immune system.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016941539">Thanks so very much. Brianna had a small scratch that became infected; hence the amocycillin - that caused UTI and a yeast infection. The Dr called two days after prescribing two more drugs for the yeast & UTI. He said that he wanted to take her off one drug and put her on another. That one made her very sick. Now, she&#39;s in bed on still another drug and Non aspirin pain reliever.<br/>
I&#39;m going to pick up that book.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so very much.<br/>
If anyone has any other suggestions, please, e-mail me<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
thanks again,<br/>
