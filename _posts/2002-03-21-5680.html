<div id="ygrps-yiv-761399916">The same way a conversation flows from one topic to another, unschooling life <br/>
can flow.  One movie leads to another.  An article in Smithsonian magazine <br/>
leads to the library.  A song on the radio leads to getting the album out, <br/>
and showing the kids another version.  That leads to getting on the internet <br/>
to see who wrote the song and who else has recorded it, and maybe printing <br/>
out the lyrics.  That leads to playing it on an instrument.  That leads to <br/>
cleaning a room.<br/>
<br/>
Conversations don&#39;t happen if nobody talks.<br/>
<br/>
Activities don&#39;t flow if there are no activities.<br/>
