<div id="ygrps-yiv-835810526">We&#39;ve run out of ideas for Christmas gifts for my mil and we decided <br/>
that we&#39;d try something made with homemade paper.  But I&#39;ve never done <br/>
it.  I&#39;ve searched the Internet and gotten a couple of recipes...but I&#39;d <br/>
like to get one from someone who&#39;s done it before.  A tried and true one.  <br/>
<br/>
Any help out there?  <br/>

We make paper about once a month these days, but I don&#39;t have a special<br/>
recipe.<br/>
We just use our scrap paper and add things to make it colorful or<br/>
interesting.  Our friends sent us some poke salad from Arkansas and we<br/>
used the berries in paper making.  It was beautiful.   Just experiment<br/>
and have fun!<br/>
