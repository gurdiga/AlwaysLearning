<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084912937">I thought this was a great quote.  I think this should be the goal of<br/>
unschooling&lt;g&gt;.  I took it from the newsletter I get every day from IMDb<br/>
(internet movie data base).  It reminds me of another quote from another<br/>
book or movie, but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it.<br/>

My father says that almost the whole world is asleep. Everybody you know.<br/>
Everybody you see. Everybody you talk to. He says that only a few people are<br/>
awake and they live in a state of constant total amazement.<br/>
<br/>
From Joe Versus the Volcano (1990)<br/>

*seeing,* and mindfulness and knowing and...  <br/>

How cool!  I&#39;ve never seen that movie.  I should go rent it today.<br/>

It reminded me of The Matrix imeediately. (Sorry to keep mentioning it.) Did <br/>
anyone see Holy Man with Eddie Murphy? The story was dumb, but the message <br/>
was cool.<br/>
