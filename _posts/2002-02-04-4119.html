<div id="ygrps-yiv-284087015">Wow.  We went hiking, which turned into snow shoeing, and snow ball<br/>
fights and I think one frostbitten toe, but wow! <br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t had much snow for the past few years and so haven&#39;t been snow<br/>
shoeing.  But we all seemed to be suffering from cabin fever over the<br/>
weekend and decided to head out.   We did find snow deep enough to<br/>
warrant the snow shoes.  <br/>
Dylan had a wonderful time, had more stamina than we did and wants to go<br/>
again next weekend.  Lots of time on the Playstation I think,  has made<br/>
him a dead aim with snow balls as well.   We left a snow man standing out<br/>
there  and felt bad when we got home that he was all alone.  If he&#39;s<br/>
still there next weekend we&#39;ll make him a friend.   My husband says a<br/>
snow dog lifting his leg on Mr. Snowman would be funny, but Dylan doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem too impressed.<br/>
Saw lots of deer and elk and one coyote.  <br/>
If my toe doesn&#39;t fall off everything will be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Deb L,  sore but happy.</div>
