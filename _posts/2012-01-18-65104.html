<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914743356">What&#39;s below was written by Glenda/wtexans, maybe on this list, sometime in the past.  I have it on this page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/change/">http://sandradodd.com/change/</a><br/>
<br/>
But I wanted to talk about relationships a bit, and this is a great intro.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I vividly remember there being a point several years into unschooling when I realized that so many of the things that had taken conscious effort in the beginning, had become second nature for me at some point along the way.<br/>
<br/>
So my answer would be, be conscious of what you&#39;re saying and doing. Be more aware of your thoughts. If you act or react in a knee-jerk way that doesn&#39;t help relationships with your family, apologize to them and make a different, better choice in that moment.<br/>
<br/>
I found it pretty easy to make the paradigm shift in my interactions with my son, but it was much harder to make that shift in my interactions with my husband. And that&#39;s still an ongoing change in our relationship, although it does come more naturally nowï¿½but it&#39;s still not as seamless as it is for me in my interactions with my son.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m tired or hungry or don&#39;t feel well, I have to be more thoughtful about how I talk to my husband and how I think about him, because it&#39;s easy for me to slip into a negative place and to focus on the things he didn&#39;t do that I wish he had or the things he did that annoyed me.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things I&#39;ve done for our marriage is to be more quiet when I&#39;m tired/hungry/not feeling well. In those instances, I&#39;m more prone to feel like snarking at my husband, or commenting on something he did / didn&#39;t do, or otherwise saying something that would be hurtful to him.<br/>
<br/>
What goes along with that, for me, is to remind myself of the things he *does* do. And also to remind myself that &quot;it&#39;s not all about ME!!&quot;. If the trash is full and he doesn&#39;t take it out when he heads outside, him not taking it has nothing whatsoever to do with me, in spite of what my tired/hungry/cranky brain may want to think in that moment ;-).<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re feeling competitive with your husband, be aware of what you&#39;re thinking and be aware of how easy it could be, in that moment, to snark at him. Then make the choice to not snark at him. And make the choice to think nice thoughts about him, to think about the nice things he does for you and your daughters. Be the one to make the better choice in that moment, to not say or do something that contributes to the competitiveness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182485735">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on this list for some time now, this is my first post. I&#39;m from <br/>
Germany with no unschooling families at reach. This is about me <br/>
(mostly), but also about my three year old son, my neighbor and her now <br/>
4 year old son.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to find new perspectives and ways to handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of telling my next door neighbor to leave me and my family <br/>
alone, espacially to quit knocking on our door to ask us out (playing in <br/>
the courtyard, going to the playground..). It disturbs me so much that <br/>
she is doing that. In fact it disturbs me to see her around the house <br/>
(although she ist not really doing anything to me, we just have some <br/>
history and most importantly I feel controlled and measured by her). She <br/>
moved here a little more than a year ago, first they lived on another <br/>
street but they moved to our house last july and are my next door <br/>
neighbors ever since. When they lived elsewhere we were kind of friends. <br/>
Her son (being one year older then my son - so at that time was 3 and <br/>
mine was 2yr old) was stressed from the move they had just done (or so I <br/>
thought!) and was hitting my son and disturbing his play a lot. He also <br/>
was and is a very loud child. They had to move again (and ended up at <br/>
our house) because of that.<br/>
<br/>
That has not changed. He screams at the top of his lungs every morning <br/>
and often during the day. He goes out in the stairwells and screams or <br/>
starts kicking the door (his) or demaging the stairs, kicking the metal <br/>
handrail.. basically making as much noise as even is possible. It <br/>
distubrs ALL the people living here (some work nightshifts). Sometimes I <br/>
wake up, startled from all this (he goes to Kindergarten so leaves home <br/>
around 8 o&#39;clock) noise.<br/>
He also destorys things mostly by throwing them or bashing them onto the <br/>
ground repeatedly (this got better, but still).<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not easy being his mom, but I felt for her and tried to <br/>
&quot;be there&quot; for about a year. Now, I&#39;m out of energy for this familiy.<br/>
<br/>
When we leave our home and/or (it depends) return to our home: they open <br/>
their door (we do keep quiet upon leaving/returning!) to check if it <br/>
really is us. Mostly the kid does that - which leads to my son <br/>
requesting to go play with him which often does not work for me or our <br/>
plans. Especially when we return after a busy day when we were out for <br/>
adventure and the plan is to eat and rest. Or just to rest because we <br/>
ate on the way.<br/>
Even when my son is tired he still wants to go and play. I feel bad <br/>
every time I tell him that it doesn&#39;t work out. I feel bad every time I <br/>
say yes.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my son turned 3 years about 6 weeks ago. We had our bad moments <br/>
when he was 2 and so on, but he generelly was a kid who looked at me for <br/>
advice/reassurence, who was gentle and careful and really disturbed by <br/>
my neighbors kid hitting him.<br/>
Now he is the one hitting and disturbing play. He does it mostly to this <br/>
other kid, but he also hits his dad and me (not so much his baby sister <br/>
who is 9 month old now).<br/>
<br/>
This is where I come in. I yell at him a lot which I did not when he was <br/>
younger. His father (my husband) does this too (on different issues than <br/>
I do).<br/>
I want a close and peaceful relationship with my son. I can see how I <br/>
disruped the trust he has build in me. I can change and I do, gradually.<br/>
<br/>
What I also see is that he shows a lot of the behavior of my neighbors <br/>
child. He starts to be noisy in the stairwell. Yesterday he broke a <br/>
windwheel his great-grandma gave to him on his 2nd birthday by bashing <br/>
it to the ground repeatedly. He said that his friend does this stuff. <br/>
They broke a plaything which belongs to his babysister by shoving it <br/>
down the stairs (made noise in the stairwell too). He said that it was <br/>
something his friend (my neighbors son) suggested.<br/>
<br/>
I see the patterns, I can imagine WHY he is doing what his friend does <br/>
or wants. The more he spents time with his friend the more he is <br/>
drifting from us. He did not just stop doing what we ask (like sitting <br/>
down at the table or be more quiet) sometimes he is even doing the exact <br/>
opposite now. Not always though.<br/>
<br/>
I think he looks for ways to connect with us more. Since I had the baby <br/>
(July last year) I had less and less time or patience for him.<br/>
I even can say, that I never really had time for him, not even during <br/>
pragnancy (when I was pragnant with HIM!). I wrote my master thesis then <br/>
and I worked parttime. He was born 2 month early because of all the <br/>
stress I had. That was when I started to change my views on a lot of <br/>
things. I started therapy then because of depression and trauma. I <br/>
continued to work parttime until May last year.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like a lousy mom, although he is such a great kid. The reason I <br/>
shout and yell so much now is that it just infuriates me when I see the <br/>
behavior of my neighbors child copied by him.<br/>
Or isn&#39;t it the other childs behavior? Is it just because my son turned <br/>
3 years old now? There are stories that this happens if childern turn 3 <br/>
but I never believed them.<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with my neighbor is complicated because I was raised to please <br/>
everyone&#39;s opinion so I basically throw myself against myself when I <br/>
think of telling her to leave us alone as much as possible. I do not <br/>
like to spent time with her. I feel controlled. I do not want my son to <br/>
see more of her sons behavior.<br/>
<br/>
But being next door neighbors does mean, that we will see each other <br/>
around. Espacially with summer coming.. the kids playing outside, they <br/>
will of course play together when they meet.<br/>
<br/>
So..it won&#39;t really help our neighborly relationship if I tell her, will <br/>
it?<br/>
On the other hand I really do not feel safe in my own home. I like to <br/>
keep to myself, I like being quite. My peace feels disturbed. I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed that I&#39;m angered when my son just mentions the other kids name.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want this.. dispute. I do not want to take away a friendship, <br/>
but on the other hand my son is 3 years old and the other kid&#39;s behavior <br/>
is not a peaceful example at all. But it is espacially the mother (my <br/>
neighbor) that I can&#39;t stand anymore with her stories of how sugar is <br/>
pure death and tv/every screen is so bad and even my telephone is <br/>
killing us slowly because it&#39;s wireless.<br/>
Her son cannot take any candy/choclate and when he does she tries to get <br/>
rid of it in mean ways that look nice. Like telling him to share (and I <br/>
can&#39;t believe that works, but it does), even if every other kid got the <br/>
same candy and the same amount.<br/>
We had a lot of situations where I felt so bad, because my son got <br/>
icecream and her&#39;s didn&#39;t (which led to a screaming and crying child, my <br/>
son being concernd for his friend, me being unhappy AND hurt by the <br/>
noise her son was making), her telling my son (who wanted to share <br/>
-unasked!- his candy) to stop sharing (she never told my directly that <br/>
her son cannot have any candy from me).<br/>
<br/>
What started out like a wonderful oppurtunity for a family friendship <br/>
has become my personal nightmare. I am so happy and relaxed now because <br/>
they are out of town for a week or two.<br/>
<br/>
This post is getting waaaaaaay to long (thanks to everyone reading it up <br/>
until now!).<br/>
<br/>
I feel like making a decision about our relationship would be most <br/>
helpful but at the same time I feel like I&#39;m missing something. Maybe I <br/>
didn&#39;t think it through enough. Maybe my son behaves the way he does <br/>
because he is 3 years old (and those stories are true after all!).<br/>
But I feel in my gut, that I do not want to continue spending any time <br/>
with them. My son does not seem to miss the other kid. He is talking <br/>
about him but does not express a wish to see or speak him. This adds to <br/>
the observation, that my son only asks to go play with my neighbor&#39;s son <br/>
when they meet anyway, casually, when they see each other on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of you can point me to the knots in my thoughts. I&#39;m <br/>
interested in reading more about 3 year olds and friends vs. family <br/>
issues. I&#39;m also looking for ideas how to connect more with my son (we <br/>
co-sleep and I breastfeed both my children). He does not go to <br/>
Kindergarten. Should play with him the whole day long? What about my <br/>
baby? She needs me to be there to. What about me? I do join in or even <br/>
initiate plays sometimes, but I make our meals too (and wash our clothes <br/>
and clean our home). I don&#39;t really have the interest to play the whole <br/>
day either. Never did.<br/>
<br/>
Please excuse me for writing this much. I have a tendency to do this <br/>
(also thinking to much as my parents always said). For those of you who <br/>
worked through this long text: THANK YOU!</div>

Al-anon has been helpful for me, sorting out how my relationships (including my relationships with my children) have been affected by things that happened while I was growing up, and helping me learn better coping skills than the ones I had.&nbsp; It has also helped me begin to better understand unschooling principles that I didn&#39;t understand before (even though I thought I did). <br><br>
&lt;&lt;I feel like a lousy mom, although he is such a great kid.&gt;&gt;<br>Feeling that way won&#39;t help you do better, in fact, focusing on negative feelings will make it harder to do better.&nbsp; Looking at what interactions make you feel lousy and separating how something makes you feel from your worth as a person or a mother, will help you gain some perspective.&nbsp; If something you do makes you feel lousy, like yelling at your son, you can begin to choose to do something different, something better.&nbsp; <br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/betterchoice.html">http://sandradodd.com/betterchoice.html</a><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/breathing">http://sandradodd.com/breathing</a><br><br>&lt;&lt; The reason I <br>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ways to handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you&#39;re doing is wrapping all the potential contributing factors and all the issues into one big problem and then looking for one solution. That&#39;s what overthinking is.<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t have *a* situation. You have a dozen things you&#39;re rolling into one. <br/>
<br/>
Break the problem down into manageable bites.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest, most effective thing you can do is be there more for him. Some of the aggression might be being 3. But some of it sounds like he&#39;s lacking for your attention and it&#39;s coming out in hitting and destruction. You need to be with him. Not just nearby but attuned to him, attentive when he&#39;s showing you something, responsive when he needs something, aware to respond to shifts in the atmosphere that suggests he&#39;s in need of a change.<br/>
<br/>
The second thing you can do is look at the bigger picture of the times when you find yourself yelling. You&#39;re yelling because life won&#39;t obey you. Of course it won&#39;t. But you *can* change the environment so people&#39;s needs are clashing. What&#39;s leading up to these times? *Why* is he hurting others? What need is he trying to meet that you&#39;re frustrating? How can you help him so he doesn&#39;t have to resort to methods that hurt others?<br/>
<br/>
Be closer when the two boys play. When either child hits, let them know that&#39;s a no and let them know you&#39;re there to help. &quot;No hitting. What do you want?&quot; Be firm. If there&#39;s an instance or two you can write out -- succinctly! -- people can offer what they&#39;d do so you can get a better idea of what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Be more aware of the times when he&#39;s resorting to hitting the family. What&#39;s been going on before? Is the hitting &quot;I&#39;m trying to do this! I need help! And you&#39;re not paying attention!&quot; The more of that you can eliminate, the easier it will be to handle the times when he&#39;s hitting because he&#39;s 3.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But it is espacially the mother (my <br/>
&gt; neighbor) that I can&#39;t stand anymore<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While it&#39;s understandable since your parenting approaches are very different, I think you&#39;re also blaming her for a problem you don&#39;t know how to solve. You&#39;re just wishing she&#39;d go away and take the problem with her. As they say, be careful what you wish for. If she does move, someone even more difficult could move in!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; most importantly I feel controlled and measured by her<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She can&#39;t control you unless you let her. When she says something that makes you feel controlled, breath. You could say, &quot;Well, I disagree, so let&#39;s talk about something we can agree on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her assessment of you means nothing unless you let it. She&#39;ll judge you. Others will judge you.  It just means you&#39;re not living your life the way they think is best for them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s your family&#39;s judgment that counts. Is what you&#39;re doing supporting them in being happy? Would you change to make them unhappy in order to make someone else happy?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe keeping a copy of the Serenity Prayer posted where you can see it often will help:<br/>
<br/>
Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br/>
The courage to change the things I can,<br/>
And wisdom to know the difference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Especially when we return after a busy day when we were out for <br/>
&gt; adventure and the plan is to eat and rest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who&#39;s &quot;we&quot;. Was the plan all agreed on? Why can&#39;t the plan change?<br/>
<br/>
It will help now and in the future to let go of labeling the decisions you make as &quot;we&quot;. While you *will* be doing most of the scheduling, the schedule should be to accommodate needs, not confine them. Be as flexible as you can be when new opportunities arise. Your priority shouldn&#39;t be making your life easier and more convenient but to find ways to do one thing AND another. *Sometimes* that will mean putting a playdate off until the next day. But do make that a priority. Don&#39;t count on him forgetting. Ask him the next day if he still wants to play.<br/>

&gt; They broke a plaything which belongs to his babysister by shoving it <br/>
&gt; down the stairs (made noise in the stairwell too). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You need to be with him more. The more he feels you&#39;re there to help him, the less he&#39;ll need to act on the feelings of being disconnected and shoved aside for his sister. Do this because *he* needs you closer, not because it will fix your problem with him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He did not just stop doing what we ask (like sitting <br/>
&gt; down at the table or be more quiet) sometimes he is even doing the exact <br/>
&gt; opposite now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He can&#39;t defy you if you don&#39;t give him things to defy. Some of this might be discovering the power he has. But the less he needs to feel his power, the less he&#39;ll be fighting. Being with him more, engaging with him during the day will take care of the parts of this that are in reaction to feeling disconnected. Then it will be easier to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel like a lousy mom, although he is such a great kid. The reason I <br/>
&gt; shout and yell so much now is that it just infuriates me when I see the <br/>
&gt; behavior of my neighbors child copied by him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s taking his frustration with you out on the world. And you&#39;re taking your frustration with the world creating problems for you out on him.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s tiny and easy to dump on.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you want to model for him?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than seeing him as the problem, see his behavior as a *reflection* of what&#39;s going on in his life. Work on the things that he&#39;s reflecting back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We had a lot of situations where I felt so bad, because my son got <br/>
&gt; icecream and her&#39;s didn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t do that. Don&#39;t let him have something you know the other boy can&#39;t have. Find something they can both have. If you&#39;re out and your son wants something, speak quietly to him that it will make his friend sad. *Don&#39;t* expect him to shut off the need though! but the more he trusts that he *can* have something at another time -- *and* trust that his need is important to you so you won&#39;t go back on the offer as soon as the situation is done -- the less he&#39;ll protest. Let him know he can have whatever it is later. If he&#39;d rather have the treat than be with his friend, that&#39;s a good indication he&#39;s done playing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This adds to <br/>
&gt; the observation, that my son only asks to go play with my neighbor&#39;s son <br/>
&gt; when they meet anyway, casually, when they see each other on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s 3. That&#39;s most likely true. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that he&#39;ll keep on seeing him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414232705">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for responding! Your insights help a lot!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra:<br/>
<br/>
-=- If you were to move far from your neighbor, what would be different? <br/>
  What would be better? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be calmer. I am now, since the neighbors are out of town. My familiy <br/>
life has improved and I was able to actually address some issues (that <br/>
means thinking and talk with my husband about our son&#39;s behavior) and <br/>
make changes because I got calmer the instant I knew that they were <br/>
going on a trip!<br/>
It was a BIG relief to me. It still is. Although I&#39;m stressed about the <br/>
day of their return.<br/>
I am tense when she is around and I just realized how much this is the <br/>
case as they left.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about it some more. I&#39;m stressed because of her many beliefs <br/>
of what is right and what is not. There is a lot of negativity, even <br/>
when she talks about her son (which makes me sad).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  -=-  Say her negativity is difficult for you to be around, and you <br/>
would rather talk about pleasant things when you&#39;re together. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes! I&#39;d love to do that, because it is true. I can&#39;t bear her <br/>
negativity and sometimes her need to justify why she put her son in <br/>
Kindergarten. It&#39;s just.. we are at a point where we barely have <br/>
anything to talk about at all. Mostly she does the talking, so I take <br/>
away her negativity I fear there is close to nothing left to say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- Invite the boy over and TELL HIM to be quieter.  TELL HIM that if he <br/>
wants to play at your house he needs to be softer and gentler. -=-<br/>
<br/>
She comes along with him and I don&#39;t really want that. But I talked to <br/>
the boy a lot over the past year and he changed since Kindergarten so <br/>
that he IS quieter, softer and gentler in my home. I&#39;m okay with him <br/>
mostly - just a little uneasy sometimes because his ideas of fun still <br/>
involve destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- You would still feel like you didn&#39;t want to play with your child, <br/>
and he would want a playmate. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I do rarely play in a sense of sitting with him for hours to build <br/>
blocks or so. But we do a lot of stuff together and I help him with <br/>
things he wants to do alone. We do puzzles, we paint, we read and sing a <br/>
lot. We dance.  He likes to join in when I cook or clean. Today he asked <br/>
me to paint his fingernails. We play. He plays with his dad, too.<br/>
(I have the benefit of my husband being home on most afternoons)<br/>
<br/>
How important is it to have a friend of the same age? They are so young, <br/>
often they don&#39;t even play together but side-by-side. Or my son disturbs <br/>
the ongoing play by telling his friend to go away (or by taking his <br/>
stuff back).<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s like &quot;be there but don&#39;t be there&quot; with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lisa:<br/>
<br/>
-=- The pattern that you&#39;re seeing is children learning how to cope with <br/>
being powerless, and controlled, and frustrated. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes! More so with my neighbors son, so I guess I fear that my son will <br/>
never recover from that experience and that will ruin our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your experience and espacially for this line:<br/>
<br/>
-=- Fury is often fear trying to be strong.  Figuring out what you&#39;re <br/>
afraid of might help you start to understand more clearly what it is <br/>
you&#39;re reacting to. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I will do that. Thank you so much for giving me a new perspective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joyce:<br/>
<br/>
-=- What you&#39;re doing is wrapping all the potential contributing factors <br/>
and all the issues into one big problem and then looking for one <br/>
solution. That&#39;s what overthinking is. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Overthinking, yes. My therapist often said this, too. As a child this <br/>
was a very important skill to have - now it&#39;s causing more trouble than <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Be more aware of the times when he&#39;s resorting to hitting the <br/>
family. What&#39;s been going on before? Is the hitting &quot;I&#39;m trying to do <br/>
this! I need help! And you&#39;re not paying attention!&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned this and I realized that he mostly hits my husband/his <br/>
dad. For attention our out of frustration (it depends or maybe it <br/>
doesn&#39;t because he is frustrated about the lack of attention?). The <br/>
broken toy of his baby sister I mentioned earlier -&gt; happend when he was <br/>
outside with his dad and the neighbor&#39;s son.<br/>
A LOT of this stuff happens when my husband is home. Is it because I <br/>
relax but my husband is not that attentive to our son&#39;s needs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- While it&#39;s understandable since your parenting approaches are very <br/>
different, -=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess they are. I came to radical unschooling from the attachment <br/>
parenting and continuum concept ideas. But than again my neighbor claims <br/>
to live the attachment parenting approach.. I don&#39;t know. What she&#39;s <br/>
doing certainly looks and feels different to me.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s part of the problem. She is the only one near me with children <br/>
more or less the age of my children. I have some friends with kids that <br/>
age too but we only meet once a week or less. My friends have (very) <br/>
different parenting approach but none of the negativity, so there was <br/>
never a problem between us. Even with different approaches we agree <br/>
often and our kids get along really well. Another friend left country to <br/>
be able to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think you&#39;re also blaming her for a problem you don&#39;t know how to <br/>
solve. -=-<br/>
<br/>
In a way I do.<br/>
Mostly I feel very uncomfortable and tense around her. I don&#39;t trust <br/>
her. I want some distance but living door to door does not provide that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- She&#39;ll judge you. Others will judge you. It just means you&#39;re not <br/>
living your life the way they think is best for them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s your family&#39;s judgment that counts. Is what you&#39;re doing supporting <br/>
them in being happy? Would you change to make them unhappy in order to <br/>
make someone else happy? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
I want my familiy to be peaceful and happy and to trust one another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   -=-    &gt; Especially when we return after a busy day when we were out <br/>
for adventure and the plan is to eat and rest. &lt;<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s &quot;we&quot;. Was the plan all agreed on? Why can&#39;t the plan change?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I was not clear. &quot;We&quot; means husband, son, baby-sister and I. So <br/>
it&#39;s us as a family. Not me the mother as a pluralis maiestatis. If we <br/>
plan for something we usually all agree (well, the baby doesn&#39;t state <br/>
her opinion yet) or -if not possible- seek to find a way that works for <br/>
everyone.<br/>
A No from our son was and is heard and respected in our home. (I&#39;m glad <br/>
I read Liedloff about 3 years ago and read more and more after that)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  -=- It will help now and in the future to let go of labeling the <br/>
decisions you make as &quot;we&quot;.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I never do this, which of course you couldn&#39;t know. I&#39;m very clear about <br/>
which decisions are mine and why. Sorry again for not giving that info.<br/>
We try to go for much flexibilty and plans change.<br/>
I guess coming home with a tired child that suddenly wants to go play <br/>
because he saw his friend (often said friend is already about to go to <br/>
bed) at a time when the respective parents are also tired and/or doing <br/>
their evening routine and have no interest in hanging out (more) is just <br/>
to much for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Karen:<br/>
Thank you for the book link! I&#39;ll look into that.<br/>
<br/>
This helped me, because I *know* that but somehow do not want to <br/>
acknowledge it. It&#39;s true though and I agree. It is a useful skill. <br/>
Maybe one I lack.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Not every person you son meets in life will have his best interest <br/>
in mind.  Learning how to navigate that is a very useful skill.  This <br/>
sounds relatively benign place to explore some of that.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
This was very soothing, thank you!<br/>
<br/>
  -=- Try to think less in extremes.  Relationships typically fall <br/>
somewhere between wonderful and nightmarish.  ;-)  Learn to see the good <br/>
and build on that.  Learn to navigate the more difficult with as much <br/>
grace and honesty as feels comfortable to you.  In watching you do this, <br/>
your son will learn skills that will be valuable to him for his <br/>
lifetime.   -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About the icecream:<br/>
Where met in the supermarked and while I considered all of what you <br/>
suggested I came to the conclusion not to let her aversion control my <br/>
behaviour towards my son. I tried to talk to him, but he got all up in <br/>
tears as he did not understand (we always get icecream when we are <br/>
shopping and he wants to and my neighbor knows that). I could not do <br/>
that to him, neither did it feel right to do that to his friend. I felt <br/>
trapped and made a choice. My neighbor could have choosen to buy her son <br/>
a cone, too. She does that sometimes so it&#39;s not like a <br/>
never-going-to-happen-rule. It isn&#39;t about money either.<br/>
<br/>
When the boys play outside or at our place I offer other snacks but <br/>
there are times all they want is candy. Besides my neighbor has candy at <br/>
her home, she just restricts it for her son (he gets some sometimes, I <br/>
don&#39;t know what it depends upon).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have some new perspectives now. You all suggested to be more <br/>
attentive. I&#39;ll take that to heart.</div>

Rough! Loud! Active! play. That&#39;s an issue for some moms - if you didn&#39;t grow up with a lot of rough-and-tumble fun, it can be shocking to deal with a kid who likes a lot of that. &nbsp;Here&#39;s a page of ideas for active things to do with a child:</span></font><br><font color="#3f3f3f"><span style="line-height:13.541666030883789px;"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/physicality/">http://sandradodd.com/physicality/</a><br></span></font><br>Also, be sure to take him places where he can Be Loud - outside places, most likely ;) don&#39;t just send him off to play, though, be prepared to do big loud things with him. Look for ways to make big exciting noises outside - when he finds a way to to make a big noise Inside, suggest bringing it to the park next time - and be sure to do it! Make a list or a special &quot;take to the park&quot; bag especially for that kind of fun.<br><br>&nbsp;At the same time, look for quieter noisy things to do inside - little plastic containers full of things that rattle, for instance. Rice makes a different sound than pennies, or beans, or salt. They also make different kinds of messes ;) so be prepared to clean those up when you open the containers to see what&#39;s inside. Put the same sorts of things in bags and see how the sound changes. Get a cheap electronic keyboard and play with the sounds it makes - you might want to get headphones with that! Make an old &quot;telephone&quot; with two cans and some string and talk to each other. Make your own &quot;wind chimes&quot; out of found objects - plastic lids, shells, bent forks... anything you can find.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow up balloons and let the air ppppppppppppth out of them for fun - save the squeaking noise you can make with them for the park ;) Try to catch the balloons while the whiz around the apartment.&nbsp;<br><br>If he&#39;s hitting things, consider that he might need to exercise the big muscles in his arms and back more - I don&#39;t mean right at that moment, but proactively. Play games that let him swing his arms around. Help him find ways and things to climb. Play games where he drags himself along the floor using just his arms. Get lots of soft bits of cloth to wave around and dance with them. Rig a chin-up bar in a doorway for him to pull himself up. He might also enjoy wrestling - do you or your husband wrestle with him? For some kids, the physical stimulation of wrestling is actually really important! Near the bottom of that page I linked - Pat R&#39;s sensory activities - includes a lot of &quot;wrestling&quot; type play activities you can do with a young child.&nbsp;<br><br>Plan to do things with his friend, too - organize their time together a bit more, so you aren&#39;t just running after them. Find fun things for small active children to do together so they have a reason to want to be with you - you&#39;re not just supervising, you&#39;re the purveyor of good times. Since you know your son&#39;s going to want to play with his friend when you come home from somewhere, Plan for that. Don&#39;t just brace yourself to say No, plan your energy and patience around the fact that coming home Means he&#39;ll want to play with the neighbor. That might mean less outings for awhile, if you know that doing all that will leave you too tired. It might mean planning to go out in such a way that you come home while the neighbor is in school, and you have a chance to rest before he comes home. The good thing about something that &quot;always happens&quot; is that you get to think ahead.&nbsp;<br><div class="ygrps-yiv-1705139474ygroups-quoted"><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&nbsp;I like to&nbsp;<br> </span></blockquote>keep to myself, I like being quite.&lt;&lt;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1705139474ygroups-quoted"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1705139474ygroups-quoted">Maybe your son doesn&#39;t. I like to keep to myself and be quiet. My stepson is very social, very active, and as a little boy was very loud. Some of that loudness was because he needed more attention and care, but some was that he needed a lot of stimulation. I learned to adapt to that, to set him up to be loud and rough. Some of that involved taking him outside a lot. Some involved finding was to direct his energy with games and activities. And some involved learning to stretch my own boundaries for the sake of someone I cared about. One of the things I learned along the way was that by getting into the spirit of playing loud and energetically, I didn&#39;t feel like my boundaries were under attack. It was like I was &quot;pushing back&quot; against the sound and touch and intrusion, creating my own personal space in a fun way, rather than grimly defending my boundaries.&nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1705139474ygroups-quoted"><br>---Meredith</div></div>

-=- It will help now and in the future to let go of labeling the<br/>
decisions you make as &quot;we&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never do this, which of course you couldn&#39;t know. I&#39;m very clear about<br/>
which decisions are mine and why. Sorry again for not giving that info.<br/>
We try to go for much flexibilty and plans change.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Who was the &quot;we&quot; then in &quot;we try&quot;? ===<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;we&quot; was &quot;my husband and I&quot; - this was my first and fast answer. <br/>
Then I thought: &quot;wow, that&#39;s simple. I should have written &quot;my husband <br/>
and I&quot; instead of &quot;we&quot; - and then I thought about it some more and deeply.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What hit me, when I read and re-read your post was that I never even <br/>
noticed I had written my part the way I clearly did. I was sure that == <br/>
I never do this == (use the &quot;we&quot; for just my opinion) and I was sure <br/>
that == I&#39;m very clear about which decisions are mine and why. ==<br/>
It was very unsettling to discover that I&#39;m not as clear as I thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I grew from this. Thank you for pointing out!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this needs to be posted seperately:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have another question since. It&#39;s up in my head and I can&#39;t quite put <br/>
it in the right words just now.<br/>
It&#39;s about my fear (it occured to me I have one) of ruining my <br/>
relationship with my son in various ways..for instance by saying &quot;no&quot;. <br/>
It&#39;s about saying yes. It&#39;s about my three year old watching youtube <br/>
videos often, regularly and sometimes for over an hour (up to two hours <br/>
or more) straight.<br/>
First thing we come home: he turns on the tablet for youtube. Often when <br/>
he gets up in the morning he goes straight for tablet and youtube. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t care for eating with me, my husband and his baby-sister. He <br/>
misses meals (or eats in front of the tablet). I feel neglected. I fear <br/>
he might feel neglected. I try to offer other activities, bring new <br/>
toys, play with him. I watch some videos with him (but I honestly cannot <br/>
watch for such a long time). He watches songs about dinosaurs or the <br/>
alphabet or numbers mostly. All in English, which isn&#39;t our native <br/>
language. He&#39;s learning but I fear that he misses out on learning our <br/>
native tongue (German) - which is a strange fear seeing that I grew up <br/>
bilingual. And I like to spend my time at the computer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it really okay for a child this young to spend so many hours a day <br/>
watching videos? I mean physically okay for his eyes and his brain. And <br/>
emotionally okay? Should I really not interfere?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Won&#39;t it ruin his life when I say yes to everything he wants? With us <br/>
being four different people I try to go for balance, but this is really <br/>
hard. And sometimes just sucks when the other people&#39;s plans are <br/>
hindered or rendered impossible. My biggest concern: I breastfeed him <br/>
and his little sister. I don&#39;t want to. What I want is to finally wean <br/>
him. But when he cries for his milk.. I can&#39;t take it. To just let him <br/>
cry and beg is far beyond me. So he gets &quot;his&quot; milk.<br/>
I&#39;m a breastfeeding consultant so I know about him still being within <br/>
age and all the benefits. Nevertheless it&#39;s wearing me out to nurse two <br/>
kids (he&#39;s 3 and his sisters first birthday is coming up). And it&#39;s <br/>
unfair to wean him while continue to nurse his baby-sister. I feel bad <br/>
and it&#39;s difficult to navigate through this. Maybe somebody here knows <br/>
of this dilemma and has insightful advice?</div>

&gt; or more) straight.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re not available for him, if you&#39;re not bringing other opportunities into his life, then he would choose the least boring thing he&#39;s able to do himself.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing just one thing isn&#39;t an indication of failure to provide other things. A failure to provide other things can *look* like choosing just one easy least-boring thing.<br/>
<br/>
So block the iPad from your vision and look at your son. If there were a variety of things beyond that block, would you be worrying?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t put the burden of proof that you&#39;re provide enough on him. Don&#39;t make your judgement depend on him choosing something other than the iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I watch some videos with him (but I honestly cannot <br/>
&gt; watch for such a long time).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you know enough about what he&#39;s doing that you can share his delight when he shows you something?<br/>
<br/>
 It won&#39;t take 2 hours of the same game to get to know what he finds delightful and annoying. Sit with him because you *want* to, not because you&#39;re supposed to. Sit with him to get to know him through his interests. Sit with him because he enjoys your company and you enjoy his.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s learning but I fear that he misses out on learning our <br/>
&gt; native tongue (German)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you stopped speaking German to him? His primary source for language will be you. It&#39;s what he&#39;ll use when he needs something.<br/>
<br/>
Right now it&#39;s what he&#39;s watching that&#39;s so appealing and understanding English is just one of the hoops between him and what he loves.. If he had to stand on his head to watch them, that&#39;s what he&#39;d do. But would you fear he&#39;d never stand on his feet?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it really okay for a child this young to spend so many hours a day <br/>
&gt; watching videos? I mean physically okay for his eyes and his brain. And <br/>
&gt; emotionally okay? Should I really not interfere?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where is this fear coming from? Do you see physical signs? Or is it from the voices in your head whispering that your a bad mommy? What are *those* voices based on? If those voices are based on truth then when radical unschoolers say it&#39;s okay, doesn&#39;t that mean they&#39;re putting radical unschooling ahead of their child&#39;s health? That we don&#39;t care that we&#39;ve let our kids ruing their eyes and health? Do you think that might be true? Or is it more likely the fearful voices are just based on nothing more than fear of the unknown?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Won&#39;t it ruin his life when I say yes to everything he wants?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably. And ruin other people&#39;s lives too.<br/>
<br/>
It will also ruin his life to say no arbitrarily in order to not always saying yes.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look for rules. Look for principles. The principle is to help him meet his needs. He depends on you. He&#39;s powerless. You&#39;re knowledgeable and powerful. Be his power. But don&#39;t hand it over to him blindly and unquestioningly. He doesn&#39;t want to hurt people. But he&#39;s tiny and knows little about the world. He needs you to be his better. Help him reach what he&#39;s trying to reach. Help him out if he&#39;s doing it in a way that&#39;s unsafe or dangerous or hurtful to others. He doesn&#39;t need to be taught better ways. He needs to see better ways so he can learn.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And sometimes just sucks when the other people&#39;s plans are <br/>
&gt; hindered or rendered impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s little. He&#39;s going to ask unreasonable thing because he can only see the direct path between him and what he things will fill the hole in him.<br/>
<br/>
Think outside the box. Find solutions that take others into account.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably help to post a time or two when you supported him but at other&#39;s expense. Then people can suggest practical ways to put the principles into practice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I want is to finally wean <br/>
&gt; him. But when he cries for his milk.. I can&#39;t take it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor can he. And he&#39;s far more helpless in the world.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others will have some practical ideas on what they started offering to give him other choices besides just the breast. But the less you focus on weaning him, the less you focus on needing him to make a different choice, the sooner he&#39;ll be able to move on. The more you pressure him to let go, the tighter and longer he&#39;ll hold on.<br/>

Sometimes he&#39;ll want rain when there&#39;s not a cloud in the sky, or a parade to march down the street when none is scheduled for months. Life is full of disappointments - so many that it&#39;s not necessary to add a single one for kids to learn about the downside of living. What we can do is help kids experience disappointments within a context of optimism, abundance, and support. We can see the real limits in life as opportunities to offer compassion and solve problems together. We can help our kids move through life thoughtfully and creatively by becoming more thoughtful and creative, ourselves.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);"><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> </span></blockquote></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">&gt;&gt;</span><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);word-spacing:normal;font-size:13px;line-height:1.25;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);word-spacing:normal;font-size:13px;line-height:1.25;">My biggest concern: I breastfeed him</span><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);word-spacing:normal;font-size:13px;line-height:1.25;">&nbsp;</span></div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">and his little sister.

And kids at home, not being shuffled from one thing to the next, have the luxury to really get into something and do it for hours.

That can be hard on moms. My daughter&#39;s an intense introvert and has been from birth. She never made eye contact as a baby, never had much interest in people in general or me, her mother, as more than a source of boobs and basic care. Her second word was &quot;self&quot;. Had I expected a baby who cuddled and cooed and loved me to pieces, I might have been pretty heartbroken - because I didn&#39;t really get any of that on an overt level from Morgan until she was considerably older. It&#39;s possible something like that is going on with your son - he&#39;s not wired in such a way that connecting with you is a priority. It&#39;s even possible that the ways you want to connect are so unnatural for him that he&#39;d rather watch videos -</span><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;">&nbsp;because with a video the only way you can interact with him is side-by-side, rather than face to face.&nbsp;If that&#39;s true, then it makes sense that he won&#39;t want to eat with other people, won&#39;t like to play with you, won&#39;t do a lot of interactive things - because you don&#39;t interact the right way, from his point of view. It&#39;s something to watch for and experiment with. When he&#39;s not watching videos, be careful how you interact - try being more to his side rather than face to face. Watch and listen and don&#39;t say much.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;">---Meredith<br><br><br></span></div></div>

    <div id="ygrps-yiv-753925969ygrp-text"><p>Hi!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m back online. I&#39;m sorry it took so long, as I meant to reply to this:<br>
<br>
=== There is nothing deleted in this cut and paste:<br>
_______<br>
<br>
-=- It will help now and in the future to let go of labeling the<br>
decisions you make as &quot;we&quot;. -=-<br>
<br>
I never do this, which of course you couldn&#39;t know. I&#39;m very clear about<br>
which decisions are mine and why. Sorry again for not giving that info.<br>
We try to go for much flexibilty and plans change.<br>
___________<br>
<br>
Who was the &quot;we&quot; then in &quot;we try&quot;? ===<br>
<br>
The &quot;we&quot; was &quot;my husband and I&quot; - this was my first and fast answer. <br>
Then I thought: &quot;wow, that&#39;s simple. I should have written &quot;my husband <br>
and I&quot; instead of &quot;we&quot; - and then I thought about it some more and deeply.<br>
<br>
What hit me, when I read and re-read your post was that I never even <br>
noticed I had written my part the way I clearly did. I was sure that == <br>
I never do this == (use the &quot;we&quot; for just my opinion) and I was sure <br>
that == I&#39;m very clear about which decisions are mine and why. ==<br>
It was very unsettling to discover that I&#39;m not as clear as I thought.<br>
<br>
I grew from this. Thank you for pointing out!<br>
<br>
Maybe this needs to be posted seperately:<br>
<br>
I have another question since. It&#39;s up in my head and I can&#39;t quite put <br>
it in the right words just now.<br>
It&#39;s about my fear (it occured to me I have one) of ruining my <br>
relationship with my son in various ways..for instance by saying &quot;no&quot;. <br>
It&#39;s about saying yes. It&#39;s about my three year old watching youtube <br>
videos often, regularly and sometimes for over an hour (up to two hours <br>
or more) straight.<br>
First thing we come home: he turns on the tablet for youtube. Often when <br>
he gets up in the morning he goes straight for tablet and youtube. He <br>
doesn&#39;t care for eating with me, my husband and his baby-sister. He <br>
misses meals (or eats in front of the tablet). I feel neglected. I fear <br>
he might feel neglected. I try to offer other activities, bring new <br>
toys, play with him. I watch some videos with him (but I honestly cannot <br>
watch for such a long time). He watches songs about dinosaurs or the <br>
alphabet or numbers mostly. All in English, which isn&#39;t our native <br>
language. He&#39;s learning but I fear that he misses out on learning our <br>
native tongue (German) - which is a strange fear seeing that I grew up <br>
bilingual. And I like to spend my time at the computer.<br>
<br>
Is it really okay for a child this young to spend so many hours a day <br>
watching videos? I mean physically okay for his eyes and his brain. And <br>
emotionally okay? Should I really not interfere?<br>
<br>
Won&#39;t it ruin his life when I say yes to everything he wants? With us <br>
being four different people I try to go for balance, but this is really <br>
hard. And sometimes just sucks when the other people&#39;s plans are <br>
hindered or rendered impossible. My biggest concern: I breastfeed him <br>
and his little sister. I don&#39;t want to. What I want is to finally wean <br>
him. But when he cries for his milk.. I can&#39;t take it. To just let him <br>
cry and beg is far beyond me. So he gets &quot;his&quot; milk.<br>
I&#39;m a breastfeeding consultant so I know about him still being within <br>
age and all the benefits. Nevertheless it&#39;s wearing me out to nurse two <br>
kids (he&#39;s 3 and his sisters first birthday is coming up). And it&#39;s <br>
unfair to wean him while continue to nurse his baby-sister. I feel bad <br>
and it&#39;s difficult to navigate through this. Maybe somebody here knows <br>
of this dilemma and has insightful advice?<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232829671">=== Choosing just one thing isn&#39;t an indication of failure to provide <br/>
other things. A failure to provide other things can *look* like choosing <br/>
just one easy least-boring thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So block the iPad from your vision and look at your son. If there were a <br/>
variety of things beyond that block, would you be worrying?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t put the burden of proof that you&#39;re provide enough on him. Don&#39;t <br/>
make your judgement depend on him choosing something other than the <br/>
iPad. ===<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t *know* if I provide enough, I don&#39;t know how things look from <br/>
his point of view and he is not verbal about it. I want some proof that <br/>
I provide enough other things. But I don&#39;t know where to get that from. <br/>
I&#39;m worried because we used to do stuff together but it got less and <br/>
less.. he wants to do his own stuff now, sometimes he asks me to join <br/>
(yay!). I think he is quite happy. Maybe I worry to much. Maybe I expect <br/>
to much or see myself in a bad light? Like not living up to some fuzzy <br/>
expectations I think others may have about me?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an introvert (up to not leaving the house at all until we ran out of <br/>
food and cash to pay for a delivery - this was before I had kids). I&#39;m <br/>
not good at smaltalk and I avoid some settings which I deem difficult to <br/>
handle for me. It got better with my kids being around, but still it&#39;s <br/>
not easy. I&#39;m not the outgoing kind of person.<br/>
At home I was the &quot;invisible child&quot; - keeping to myself, no siblings <br/>
around, parents who had no time to play with me (but they were home at <br/>
least half of the day).<br/>
So that&#39;s why I want a close relationship with my kids. I want to get to <br/>
know them, to be friends. I kind of feel rejected if my son goes out to <br/>
play with his friend (the neighbors kid, I worte about at the very first <br/>
post) or does stuff without me. At the same time I kind of want to keep <br/>
to myself, so doing stuff without me comes in quite handy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It leaves me clueless how to navigate and validate for myself that I am <br/>
providing enough. I don&#39;t even know what &quot;enough&quot; would be.<br/>
But he is not alone, I am attentive and I care for him and we do stuff <br/>
together. He seems happy most of the time, so maybe it&#39;s okay as it is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=== Do you know enough about what he&#39;s doing that you can share his <br/>
delight when he shows you something?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t take 2 hours of the same game to get to know what he finds <br/>
delightful and annoying. Sit with him because you *want* to, not because <br/>
you&#39;re supposed to. Sit with him to get to know him through his <br/>
interests. Sit with him because he enjoys your company and you enjoy his.===<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we do find cool delightful stuff together. I want to get to know <br/>
his interests and I want to support him. I think I could be even more <br/>
there - I&#39;m working on this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=== Where is this fear coming from? Do you see physical signs? Or is it <br/>
from the voices in your head whispering that your a bad mommy? What are <br/>
*those* voices based on? If those voices are based on truth then when <br/>
radical unschoolers say it&#39;s okay, doesn&#39;t that mean they&#39;re putting <br/>
radical unschooling ahead of their child&#39;s health? That we don&#39;t care <br/>
that we&#39;ve let our kids ruing their eyes and health? Do you think that <br/>
might be true? Or is it more likely the fearful voices are just based on <br/>
nothing more than fear of the unknown? ===<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not anyone near me who lets their children watch tv or youtube <br/>
&quot;freely&quot; - most people are really restrictive about it. Our pediatrician <br/>
was surprised to hear that my son watches tv at all. He made it clear, <br/>
that if there is tv/youtube (and I think all screens involved) no more <br/>
than 30min daily was appropriate for a child this young.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never met a child (or an adult) who wasn&#39;t restricted (tv and <br/>
otherwise). It&#39;s fear of the unknown. I need to trust more and fear less.<br/>
It is fuzzy! My own childhood experience was that I returned a TV (given <br/>
to me by my parents) some time (years?) later because I ended up not <br/>
using it. Didn&#39;t own a TV since (but used computers a lot and I still <br/>
enjoy to do that!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=== -=-Is it really okay for a child this young to spend so many hours a day<br/>
watching videos? I mean physically okay for his eyes and his brain. And<br/>
emotionally okay? -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. ===<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was what I needed to hear :) I took a deep breath and it helped <br/>
relax a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=== It will probably help to post a time or two when you supported him <br/>
but at other&#39;s expense. Then people can suggest practical ways to put <br/>
the principles into practice. ===<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He wants to go visit his friend (right next door, same building) and <br/>
there is A LOT of back-and-forth, meaning he leaves our home, knocks on <br/>
their door, gets in, comes back after a few seconds (sometimes minutes), <br/>
leaves our home... and so on. As if he can&#39;t decide where to stay. I&#39;m <br/>
okay with this for a few repeats but I don&#39;t want him to disturb the <br/>
family life next door so much. So after some back and forth I tell him <br/>
to either stay there or stay with us. Doesn&#39;t work so well. I try to <br/>
explain that they have dinner and bedtime. He doesn&#39;t seem to get it. I <br/>
do tell my son, that he can hang out with his friend the next day again. <br/>
But often he doesn&#39;t grab this either.<br/>
Yesterday I finally told him to go one more time, tell his friend <br/>
goodnight then come back and stay with us for the rest of the evening.<br/>
That worked (I was surprised).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like to not bother people by noise or constant interruption of their <br/>
activities. Especially in the evenings or early morning. I like my kids <br/>
to understand, that there are times visiting is inappropriate.</div>

<br/>
I forgot to add this: I see physical signs as in him being sleep <br/>
deprived. His eyes get red and he rubs them minute after minute but he <br/>
won&#39;t go to bed. I&#39;d say &quot;let&#39;s lie down&quot; or offer to read or sing to <br/>
him or just say that I&#39;m going to lie down a bit. He&#39;s not interested.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t *know* if I provide enough, I don&#39;t know how things look from <br/>
&gt; his point of view and he is not verbal about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He communicates in other ways. His tone. His laughter. His sadness. His body language. His actions. His reactions. His choices.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re getting frustrated that he doesn&#39;t speak your language. Get to know *his* language.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t take his communication as a reflection of you. If he&#39;s sad it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve been a bad mommy.  It means he&#39;s sad. *Don&#39;t make is about you. Make it about him!* Take his communication as an indication of what&#39;s going on inside of him. *Use* that information to make choices. Why is he sad? What does he like when he&#39;s sad for similar reasons? (Not all sadness is the same!) Try things. Fix what you can fix. Cuddle. Do something else with him. Get snacks together. Use his reactions as more information to make even better choices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want some proof that <br/>
&gt; I provide enough other things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t proof. There are clues. There is mounting evidence that one thing is more likely true than another. Right now you&#39;ve got blinders on. You&#39;re only seeing what your yardstick measures: when he does things you suggest. You&#39;re ignoring all the others clues he&#39;s showing you.<br/>
<br/>
You can grow greater confidence that what he&#39;s doing is normal by reading what other unschoolers have seen is normal. But your son is who will tell you -- in the non-verbal language of a 3 yo -- what is right and good *for him*.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m worried because we used to do stuff together but it got less and <br/>
&gt; less..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you worry when breastfeeding got less and less?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re judging what&#39;s working by the yardstick of &quot;him doing the activities you suggested.&quot; But every day he&#39;s a different person than he was the day before. That yardstick doesn&#39;t work for the new person he is. Find new ways of judging his happiness.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he wants to do his own stuff now, sometimes he asks me to join <br/>
&gt; (yay!). I think he is quite happy. Maybe I worry to much. Maybe I expect <br/>
&gt; to much or see myself in a bad light? Like not living up to some fuzzy <br/>
&gt; expectations I think others may have about me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about using your son&#39;s vision of you rather than other people&#39;s? Isn&#39;t he the one whose opinion on how good of a mother you&#39;re being that counts?<br/>
<br/>
What does his body language say? Does he have things he loves so much that he forgoes sleep for them, for instance? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m an introvert (up to not leaving the house at all until we ran out of <br/>
&gt; food and cash to pay for a delivery - this was before I had kids). I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; not good at smaltalk and I avoid some settings which I deem difficult to <br/>
&gt; handle for me. It got better with my kids being around, but still it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not easy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Everyone* has parts of unschooling that are hard for them. Different people find different parts difficult. But they&#39;re handicaps not unremovable shackles. You *will* have to work harder than an extrovert to get out. (Assuming your kids do want to get out.) But you won&#39;t have to work as hard as an extrovert will to stay home with her introverted kids! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Ask. Ask people on the list what has worked for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So that&#39;s why I want a close relationship with my kids. I want to get to <br/>
&gt; know them, to be friends. I kind of feel rejected if my son goes out to <br/>
&gt; play with his friend (the neighbors kid, I worte about at the very first <br/>
&gt; post) or does stuff without me. At the same time I kind of want to keep <br/>
&gt; to myself, so doing stuff without me comes in quite handy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a big clue there. You&#39;re making choices in reaction to your past. You&#39;re looking at your past then trying to do the opposite. You&#39;re trying to parent the child you were instead of the child you have.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looking at what you needed as a child, look at your son and what he needs.<br/>
<br/>
Because what you really needed as a child *wasn&#39;t* parents who gave you everything a child could want. It was parents who listened *to you* and to your needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want to get to know <br/>
&gt; his interests and I want to support him. I think I could be even more <br/>
&gt; there - I&#39;m working on this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you use &quot;get to know his interests&quot; as a rule, you&#39;ll be disappointed if he gets grumpy that you&#39;re with him too much!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s connecting when we find other people who share our interests. It&#39;s connecting to share what we love and have someone be happy for us. It&#39;s connecting when someone&#39;s happy because we&#39;re happy and have things we love. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s disconnecting if you decide what connecting must look like but it&#39;s not what feels connecting to your son.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is confusing! We&#39;re all grown up with depending on rules to tell us how to live our lives. Read with your kids 30 minutes a day. Brush your teeth after every meal. Don&#39;t let your kids drink sodas.<br/>
<br/>
But all of that is looking at rules, then trying to get kids to conform to the rules. That doesn&#39;t work for unschooling! In fact it doesn&#39;t work well for any relationships. For those stuck not knowing where to begin, perhaps begin with a common rule but then use the other person&#39;s reactions as feedback on what they like and what they don&#39;t like. Then forget the rule and make adjustments from there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There&#39;s not anyone near me who lets their children watch tv or youtube <br/>
&gt; &quot;freely&quot; - most people are really restrictive about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is another obstacle. But again, not an unremovable shackle. You won&#39;t have the ability they do to turn to neighbors for examples and advice. It means finding people who live far from you to see what supporting kids choices looks like, how it works, what the pitfalls are and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our pediatrician <br/>
&gt; was surprised to hear that my son watches tv at all. He made it clear, <br/>
&gt; that if there is tv/youtube (and I think all screens involved) no more <br/>
&gt; than 30min daily was appropriate for a child this young.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And physicians once advertised cigarettes.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean everything doctors say is full of crap. It means give more weight to what they say about a the flu than they do about parenting. Their parenting advice is likely to be very mainstream. Their words feel like they carry more weight when a doctor says it. But doctors didn&#39;t spend 8+ years learning about parenting in college.<br/>
<br/>
When talking to doctors, give happy but vague answers. They&#39;re all meaning but in terms of parenting outside the mainstream not likely to be more helpful than your next door neighbor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My own childhood experience was that I returned a TV (given <br/>
&gt; to me by my parents) some time (years?) later because I ended up not <br/>
&gt; using it. Didn&#39;t own a TV since (but used computers a lot and I still <br/>
&gt; enjoy to do that!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which says more about you, your needs, your personality than it does about TV. You got to *choose*. Your letting your child choose then worrying about his choices. I&#39;m assuming your parents didn&#39;t wring their hands when you returned the TV.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As if he can&#39;t decide where to stay. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; okay with this for a few repeats but I don&#39;t want him to disturb the <br/>
&gt; family life next door so much. So after some back and forth I tell him <br/>
&gt; to either stay there or stay with us. Doesn&#39;t work so well. I try to <br/>
&gt; explain that they have dinner and bedtime. He doesn&#39;t seem to get it. I <br/>
&gt; do tell my son, that he can hang out with his friend the next day again. <br/>
&gt; But often he doesn&#39;t grab this either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s 3. Don&#39;t expect him to understand as an adult. Don&#39;t expect him to change his feelings just because you tell him (in essence) they&#39;re wrong or impractical. (In fact that doesn&#39;t work with anyone, regardless of age!) Do give him information! But expect that for right now he doesn&#39;t feel that he has *any* control over his feelings.<br/>
<br/>
He *will* have wants and needs that disturb others. It&#39;s up to you to help him meet the need in a way that doesn&#39;t step on others toes. *OR* find a substitute! If he wants a picnic and its raining you accept that he&#39;s disappoint and may need to grieve for a bit. But you&#39;d also find something else to do. *Not* to fix him! Don&#39;t see his sadness as anything other than about him. It&#39;s not yours not fix. But do focus on making some changes in the environment so that he has a better situation to be sad in. (Which might mean cuddling. Or doing something fun. *Don&#39;t* take on his sadness. Be understanding that it&#39;s *normal* to be disappointed and sad. Then tweak the situation.)<br/>
<br/>
If he wants to visit the neighbors, you can say &quot;They&#39;re having dinner. Let&#39;s do that new game on the iPad.&quot; Or &quot;Can you help me make something special for Daddy for dinner?&quot; &quot;Having dinner,&quot; is the information you&#39;re basing your response on. Don&#39;t expect that he&#39;ll get that in the same way that you do. But the more you respond with choices and support rather than feeling bad that he feels bad, the more help you can be. <br/>
