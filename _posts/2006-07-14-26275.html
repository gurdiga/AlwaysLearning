<div id="ygrps-yiv-126814205">~There&#39;s a photo of him in a long tunic, though not the total full-<br/>
skirted version, second photo here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/duckford/">http://sandradodd.com/duckford/</a><br/>
gunwaldt and he&#39;s holding baby Holly. Baby Asta. (The upper photo<br/>
isn&#39;t Viking costumes, that was for a different thing.)~<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the pics, and beside the cuteness I saw you were all in MY<br/>
Kingdom (for Fool&#39;s War)!! Ok, not MINE, but where I live. And now you<br/>
don&#39;t participate except behind the scenes. Well dang.<br/>
