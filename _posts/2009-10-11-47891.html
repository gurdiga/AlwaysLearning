<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088783561">Hi - <br/>
<br/>
I never post but enjoy getting insight from the posts in this Group. <br/>
<br/>
I think it was in this Group about a month or so ago that someone posted a wonderful article about math - it was a math scholar being &quot;interviewed&quot; about how the beauty of math is lost in the way public schools teach math. <br/>
<br/>
I think it was from the AMA but I searched their site and couldn&#39;t find it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if it was someone here that posted that link - could you please post it again?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399385568">Thank you Joyce!!  I have been going crazy trying to find this - not to mention spending way too much time on the maa.org web site (I remembered that much).<br/>
