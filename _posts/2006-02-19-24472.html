<div id="ygrps-yiv-245950317">That is a favorite saying, &quot;Man, that sucks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Least favorite (or at least one of the least fave) &quot;Time heals all wounds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I want to share this as I read mothers sort of pissed off at having to take<br/>
care of their children and own lives: my father died at 42 of a heart attack<br/>
when I was 6 yo, my sister was 8 and my brother was 3. My brother died of<br/>
cancer at 18. My sister died of cancer at 33. My mother is mentally ill and<br/>
only sort of normal part of the time, and that normal time was never when we<br/>
grew up, the stress of life was too much for her wobbly brain to handle.<br/>
Life is *not* fair, but we don&#39;t need to be reminded about it. We need<br/>
comfort and support and sometimes a big hug.<br/>
<br/>
There was so much comfort and support coming my way when my sister died<br/>
after 2 years of horrid treatments. Some of my clients called in a<br/>
conference call to my home the day after Dawn died to try to cheer me up and<br/>
got my answering machine, I was picking out casket/flowers/tequila/etc...<br/>
And this is what I hear, a room full of women (all of whom I really liked<br/>
and still am friends with today 10 yrs later) trying to be cheerful in their<br/>
lovely Texas rose way and say nice things on my answering machine and then<br/>
they all burst into huge rolling sobs, tears so bad they could not continue<br/>
speaking. They had to hang up and call back, embarrassed and apologizing for<br/>
not being *supportive*. That was THE MOST comforting message I have ever<br/>
gotten and I told them so.<br/>
I miss my family of origin with all of my heart, most days. Time does not<br/>
heal all wounds. Some wounds never close. But with time the good memories<br/>
slip back in too, not just the losses.<br/>
<br/>
I tell you that for me some mess is not that bad, too much mess is a home<br/>
out of control and I need to get off my franny and stop whining and bless my<br/>
family and myself by cleaning up. I like an organized, slightly decluttered<br/>
home, nice clothes washed and folded and put away, I like toilets that don&#39;t<br/>
stink just as much as the next person. I do what I can for myself and to<br/>
bless my family (love that Flylady.net!! She&#39;s so positive) and the rest is<br/>
proof that my babies are ALIVE and able to run around on their own 2 legs.<br/>
<br/>
We are raising children and they are gathering memories of their family of<br/>
origin. Maria Montessori said The Child is the Father of the Man. What will<br/>
our grown children remember about their childhood? How with that shape who<br/>
they are? I hope that my children remember that I, their mother, cleaned up<br/>
*happily* after my family, not being too snobby or mean to be the servant of<br/>
my cherished family (Christ washed his disciples feet, and they were grown<br/>
men, certainly *able* to wash their own feet). I hope that my children<br/>
remember that I valued their feelings more than I valued my possessions and<br/>
that I &quot;freely shared&quot; all that was originally mine so that they had things<br/>
and a home of their own, given to them with love as I myself received the<br/>
gift of life with love. I hope that they remember they are unconditionally<br/>
loved for simply *existing*, not based on what they chose or not chose to<br/>
do, and that the choice is really theirs, just as the choice to conceive and<br/>
raise them was really *my* choice (oh, yeah, dh had a fun part there too).<br/>
And, very importantly, when they are adults in their probably very busy<br/>
lives, I hope they remember to *call their mother*. (if they ever move out,<br/>
which my mother says is not likely based on how well they are taken care of,<br/>
aaahhhh, the plan all comes together, lol) -Arlynn</div>

I loved your post.  I am sorry that you lost so many people that you love<br/>
but I think it&#39;s wonderful that you see all the blessings in your life.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been keeping up with the posts, so I don&#39;t even know what sparked<br/>
yours, but it was inspiring to read.  There&#39;s not so much to whine about in<br/>
life when you are surrounded by the people you love.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m new to this group so I don&#39;t know anyone yet and<br/>
looking forward to getting to know folks, but I had to<br/>
comment on this...that is just so true and so cool to<br/>
hear someone say! I always got the thing where my<br/>
mother wanted me to love her and be grateful just<br/>
because she gave birth to me, but when I was a child<br/>
and she had left when I was an infant, that was too<br/>
much to ask.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I make sure my kids know that I feel priviledged<br/>
to have them in my life and I&#39;m continually grateful<br/>
to them for making a mother out of me!<br/>
<br/>
One time my son paid me a complimrent when he didn&#39;t<br/>
know it: he had heard something of what my mother had<br/>
done when I move in with her at 14. My son said, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t believe you, no mother could be mean to her own<br/>
child so that just can&#39;t be true!&quot; Because I know he<br/>
assumes all families are like his, his idealism is a<br/>
wonderful compliment to me!<br/>
<br/>
They amaze me daily.<br/>
<br/>
merry meet,<br/>

Thankyou for sharing that. loss does put things into perspective. A <br/>
friend of mine died recently leaving behind two small boys. When my <br/>
own kids are more than a handful I think &quot;Amy will never be able to be <br/>
frustrated by her kids again.&quot; and it makes me grateful for the time <br/>
that I have.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; yours, <br/>
&gt; Angela<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, looking back it does look like my post came out of nowhere. So I&#39;ll<br/>
explain. I&#39;m on digest and I was reading in one sitting of a quick read all<br/>
the posts about forced cleaning and holy mother ego issues and then the post<br/>
about the little girl with leukemia and it all was so sad to me that we<br/>
humans get so caught up in the day to day nitty gritty of who the hell is<br/>
going to take out the trash and how stupid it is to get all bent out of<br/>
shape about who does it as if we, the mother of the family, are too good to<br/>
do it ourselves now that we became queens of our castles by the act of<br/>
popping out a few royal servants (aka children) (of course, some are<br/>
disabled and would *love* to be able to take it out if they had the health<br/>
to do so) and why and I thought I would share some of my thoughts since it<br/>
does seem that the wonderful mothers on this list truly do *get it* and its<br/>
nice to share with people who get it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the past few days and thinking there must be childhood<br/>
pain in these lives and how fierce some of the retorts were (I am not<br/>
judging them to be bad responses, just highly charged, which I do not feel<br/>
is a bad thing, but those kind of fierce feelings I find come from a hurt<br/>
place inside of me so that is what I was wondering about where were these<br/>
fierce feelings coming from?) So then today some were sharing the terribly<br/>
sad things that happened in childhood from forced cleaning and shaming and<br/>
comparing and other horrible mother mishaps and it all explains the<br/>
fierceness we feel about how we are raising our children without shaming<br/>
them and without trying to get them to conform to someone&#39;s mold and I am<br/>
happy to be taking it all in. I hope to God with all my heart that my<br/>
children will look back and not have these painful memories, but that they<br/>
look fondly on our time together and say they had a happy childhood that<br/>
they hope to repeat for their own children.<br/>
<br/>
On forced cleaning, I was given chores to do every day, not terribly hard<br/>
ones, but a certain amount. All 3 kids helped around the house. We sort of<br/>
didn&#39;t love it but it wasn&#39;t too bad either. I had to go out to work at 11<br/>
yo to help earn money to survive, that wasn&#39;t too bad either, I was cleaning<br/>
other peoples houses, I got to keep $5 out of the money for my necessities<br/>
such as clothing, schoolbooks, and whatever 11 yo&#39;s like to buy. I was very<br/>
good at saving my money and budgeting for what I had to buy for school. That<br/>
wasn&#39;t too bad either, not my favorite, I thought I should have got to keep<br/>
more of the money, like $10, but whatever. The thing that irked me to no end<br/>
and actually still brings my blood to boil is the time that my mother went<br/>
shopping without me, bought socks that I f*ing hated and didn&#39;t want nor<br/>
need and then put them on my bed with the receipt and forced me to give her<br/>
the money for the socks out of my $5 and I can&#39;t remember exactly how much<br/>
they were but it was almost all of the $5 for the week and she left me<br/>
nothing but change for the entire week and yelled at me about my bad<br/>
attitude. This is a tiny sliver of her ridiculousness in my childhood, but<br/>
really, it still irks me to this day like the poster who posted about her<br/>
mother throwing out her rocks she collected, this is like that for me.<br/>
Stupid f*ing socks. Still makes me burn.<br/>
<br/>
And another thing, my sister hated making her bed, it was somehow the most<br/>
dreaded chore in the universe for her. I was NOT allowed to make it for her,<br/>
although I would sneak and make it if I thought I wouldn&#39;t get caught. Every<br/>
time she forgot to make the bed my mother would strip it naked, throw all<br/>
the sheets out the window and the mattress too onto the lawn outside and my<br/>
sister was forced to pull it all inside, up the stairs, clean everything,<br/>
put it all back together &quot;properly&quot; and pass inspection before she was<br/>
allowed to go to sleep at night. That poor girl slept on a COUCH for almost<br/>
her entire adult life she was so traumatized by the frigging bed making<br/>
issues of our maniacal mother. We used to joke about it, b/c in our shared<br/>
apt. she had a couch to sleep on, where most of us have a bed. She only<br/>
switched to a bed very late in her 20&#39;s when she got a boyfriend that would<br/>
sleep over our apt. sometimes and he refused to sleep on the end of a couch.<br/>
I am still laughing over it right now, but only the fun times we had after<br/>
we got out of our mothers house.<br/>
<br/>
I will never make my children do forced cleaning. I suppose you can see why.<br/>
And I try to not mumble and grumble about it myself, since I am honored to<br/>
have a house that needs cleaning. There are so many homeless people in our<br/>
own country and I cannot even go in my mind to other countries where women<br/>
and children sleep on the streets in filth with nothing even to eat before<br/>
they lay down. The things I find myself not seeing as a blessing, I give it<br/>
away to someone who is in more need than me and it lightens my workload. A<br/>
win/win situation. I happen to love freecycle. If I feel weighed down with<br/>
too much stuff, I post it on freecycle and someone who needs it comes and<br/>
picks it up from me and I feel happy to share my wealth and happy to be rid<br/>
of something that I didn&#39;t want. I grew up without almost anything, so it is<br/>
impossible for me to throw anything away, but freecycle is *giving* and that<br/>
I love to do.  -Arlynn</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328713979">And another thing, it looks like I am so holier than thou with that last<br/>
post. Sorry! I&#39;m only human, cleaning warts and all (just &quot;washed&quot; the<br/>
kitchen floor by throwing down a babywipe, stepping on it and moving my foot<br/>
around over the dirty spots I didn&#39;t feel like looking at all day).<br/>
<br/>
I loved what Sandra shared about Holly not minding taking out the trash in<br/>
her barefeet but her son minding. I think that really shows its just our<br/>
personal preferences (like I don&#39;t mind making beds but my sister hated it)<br/>
and it was nice to read about Sandra not minding, one way or the other who<br/>
took it out nor if anyone wanted to at all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this list Sandra and everyone. It is wonderful to read about<br/>
everyone&#39;s families. -Arlynn<br/>

I use rags or paper towels when I use that method.  Probably I&#39;d use  <br/>
baby wipes if my youngest weren&#39;t 14. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I did actually mop my kitchen floor last week and the warm feeling of  <br/>

April or so.<br/>

A quick spray of 409, spray water across floor with sinks hose <br/>
sprayer, then throw a towel on the floor, step on it and slide/walk <br/>
all over the floor.  I usually use a semi dirty towel from the hamper.<br/>
