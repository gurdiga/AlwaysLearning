HSLDA--Help Defend Homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
Dear HSLDA member,<br/>
<br/>
We have less than four weeks to go before the crucial mid-term<br/>
elections.<br/>
The results of this November 7 will significantly impact the direction<br/>
of<br/>
the country because, for the first time in over a decade, control of<br/>
both<br/>
the U.S. Senate and U.S. House is realistically at stake. A change in<br/>
party<br/>
control could have a wide ranging impact on homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Based on Home School Legal Defense Association&#39; s experience of<br/>
protecting and defending homeschooling on the state and federal <br/>
levels,<br/>
I can<br/>
assure you that the Republican majorities in Congress are friends of<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This is not only demonstrated through their actions, with <br/>
Congresswoman<br/>
Marilyn Musgrave sponsoring HoNDA, which helped many homeschool <br/>
families<br/>
who were facing discrimination via quirks in federal law, but is also<br/>
clearlystated in the party platform: &quot;We [the Republican Party] defend<br/>
the option for homeschooling and call for vigilant enforcement of laws<br/>
designed to protect family rights<br/>
and privacy in education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This strong, positive stance on homeschooling is not shared by many<br/>
Democrats and their education union allies. It is very clear that the<br/>
Democrat Party&#39;s ties with the National Education Association have and<br/>
will<br/>
continue to influence its stance on educational freedom, and we know <br/>
how<br/>
the<br/>
NEA feels about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to remind you what will occur should Democrats take the<br/>
majority in the U.S. House: George Miller of California will likely be<br/>
the<br/>
Chairman of the Education Committee. Twelve years ago, George Miller<br/>
attempted to<br/>
introduce an amendment that would have required that all teachers,<br/>
including homeschool moms, be certified teachers.<br/>
He will try something similar if he ever gains the chairmanship of <br/>
this<br/>
important committee.<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschooling freedom is fragile. One amendment passed by a<br/>
Democrat-controlled House and Senate could find its way into law.<br/>
HSLDA will do everything, with your help, to stop this from happening,<br/>
but<br/>
our job, to defend your right to homeschool, will be much easier with<br/>
government leaders who support our position. We are all in this <br/>
together<br/>
and the homeschool community must play its role to defend our<br/>
own freedom.<br/>
<br/>
The lines are clearly drawn for us on the homeschool, life, and <br/>
marriage<br/>
issues. I am convinced that we must do all that we can to ensure that<br/>
Republicans maintain control of Congress on November 7.<br/>
<br/>
To that end, HSLDA PAC has endorsed candidates in key races around the<br/>
country, and in the last week of the campaign, the PAC is sending out<br/>
numerous teams of homeschool students to participate in key House and<br/>
Senate<br/>
races. These young people will be working hard to &quot;Get-Out-The- Vote.&quot;<br/>
They<br/>
will campaign door to door, make literature drops and call thousands <br/>
of<br/>
voters. This work must occur if we are to prevail. Time and time <br/>
again,<br/>
it<br/>
has been shown that an effective grassroots effort can sway a <br/>
political<br/>
race, even if the polling data is against your candidate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking that you not only vote and volunteer for the pro-family<br/>
candidate in your area, but that you help support these young people <br/>
in<br/>
their<br/>
efforts.The PAC will be helping pay their travel, lodging, and food<br/>
expenses for<br/>
the last week of the campaign. It is possible to donate online to the<br/>
HSLDA<br/>
PAC</div>

Turn off the radio.<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t make sense to you, listen to &quot;Chicken Heart&quot; by Bill  <br/>
Cosby, and THEN turn off the radio.<br/>
<br/>
Stop getting HSLDA mailings.  They want poor homeschoolers to send  <br/>
them $100 (probably more now) so they can make $200,000 each (or more  <br/>
now) a year to try to turn the U.S. into a creationist theocracy .<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t even read their stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266858506">Thanks. I do not belong nor do I willingly get mailings from HSLDA. I <br/>
am against everything they stand for. This was sent to me by another <br/>
homeschooler.  BUT with the elections coming up I wanted to make sure <br/>
I was well informed about what could happen with my vote, especially <br/>
as I am torn between candidates.  <br/>
<br/>
I assummed that it was a scare tactic but again, I just wanted to make <br/>
sure. I figured you guys here would know the answer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738352954">The ability to think clearly and critically is something we all  <br/>
probably want for our kids - unschooling allows their thinking  <br/>
ability to develop really well because they get to pay attention to  <br/>
what matters to them so they naturally think deeply about those  <br/>
things. When teachers or homeschooling parents try to force kids to  <br/>
think about things that don&#39;t matter to them, they, naturally, don&#39;t  <br/>
think any harder than they must in order to get a decent grade (if  <br/>
they care about grades) - and the whole thinking process can feel  <br/>
very inauthentic to schooled kids - like it isn&#39;t really their own  <br/>
thinking that they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons that clear critical thinking skills are so  <br/>
important is so as not to be swayed or manipulated by statements such  <br/>
as this HSLDA alert.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most important critical thinking skill is to always read  <br/>
everything while keeping in mind the author&#39;s underlying motivation.  <br/>
In other words, read ALL seemingly objective statements as, in fact,  <br/>
someone&#39;s beliefs that are based on their own biases, self-interest,  <br/>
world view, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, once we&#39;re aware of the basic facts - that HSLDA is a  <br/>
right-wing political organization that uses homeschooling as a  <br/>
platform for promoting their overarching agenda, then we can evaluate  <br/>
everything they say with that in mind. (If anybody hasn&#39;t look into  <br/>
their activities, just spend a few minutes googling &quot;The Generation  <br/>
Joshua Project&quot; and the goals of Patrick Henry College.)<br/>
<br/>
Using our knowledge about this organization and the people and  <br/>
activities they support, we can understand that providing legal help  <br/>
is their way of garnering a devoted following which they then use to  <br/>
support certain political goals.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things to keep in mind - a fact and an idea:<br/>
<br/>
Congresswoman Republican Marilyn Musgrave is an extremist - extremely  <br/>
anti-United Nations, anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage, anti-science,  <br/>
and anti-environmentalism. You decide if you&#39;re actually worried  <br/>
about her being voted out.<br/>
<br/>
It puts homeschooling legal freedom more at risk for HSLDA to create  <br/>
the impression that all homeschoolers are right-wing Republicans/ <br/>
members of the Christian Right and that Democrats are all anti- <br/>
homeschooling. It is HSLDA, itself, that is endangering our freedom,  <br/>
by setting up this false conflict. When Democrats DO take over, it  <br/>
would be better for homeschoolers if they were NOT under the  <br/>
impression that we are all in synch with HSLDA&#39;s platform.<br/>
<br/>
My point isn&#39;t to discuss HSLDA - not appropriate for this list. Just  <br/>
using them as a jumping off point for thinking about critical thinking.<br/>
<br/>
But how we respond to HSLDA&#39;s alerts is based on our own critical  <br/>
thinking skills. I&#39;m just saying - if we are finding it hard to  <br/>
figure out what HSLDA is up to, then we might give some thought and  <br/>
time to developing our own clarity of thinking, research ability, and  <br/>
decisionmaking skills - in order to better help our kids learn to be  <br/>
discerning and competent thinkers, themselves.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The alerts always remind me of my brother in law&#39;s<br/>
football games. I was helping him explain to my sister<br/>
why *this* game is the most important one of the<br/>
season: you know--it&#39;s the preseason, the games that<br/>
set up the play for the whole season. OR it&#39;s the main<br/>
season, the meat and potatoes of the whole season--the<br/>
most important games of the season. OR it&#39;s the<br/>
postseason play--determining the champions and clearly<br/>
the most important games of the season.<br/>
<br/>
These alerts are like that--whatever seems to be<br/>
happening right now is breathlessly important, whether<br/>
it is or not. And then there&#39;s the issue of whether or<br/>
not you agree with their specific agenda items.<br/>
<br/>
