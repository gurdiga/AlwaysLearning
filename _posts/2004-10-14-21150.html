<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189096448"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;For  example: My husand says he was forced to<br/>
&gt;learn and he turned out great.  Well he did turn out great. He got a<br/>
&gt;good education, and makes a lot of  money, and is a happy man.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know my husband is happy and has a good job as well, he also loved  <br/>
college.  Sometimes he does wonder if what he is doing is because it is  truly what <br/>
he would have chosen if he had been left alone to choose or if  he was swayed <br/>
by family.  He does enjoy his job but it is all he  knows.  He will sometimes <br/>
wonder if he had not had that influence would  there have been something else <br/>
that he would have loved even more.  He  sometimes wonders if he grew up in an <br/>
environment close to what we are trying to  do for our children would he have <br/>
followed a different path.  Was there a  path out there that he was meant to <br/>
be on and he got sidetracked by school,  family pressures etc.<br/>
