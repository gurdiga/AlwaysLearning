<div id="ygrps-yiv-855333138">One story about saying No and one story about food.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, the kids and I were running errands. We stopped at  <br/>
McDonald&#39;s for a drink, and the boys also got toys. They were  <br/>
Spiderman toys, and the boys were very excited about them. They were  <br/>
talking together in the back of the van, comparing what they&#39;d gotten,  <br/>
and so on. After a few minutes, Eric, 7, asked in a very pleasant,  <br/>
inquiring voice, &quot;Mom, do you think we could stop at a different  <br/>
McDonald&#39;s after we go to Sam&#39;s Club? Carl and I really want some more  <br/>
of these, and a different place might have different ones.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought for a minute about time, money, and when the baby might need  <br/>
her nap, and said, &quot;Sure, I don&#39;t see any reason we can&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The boys were pleased.<br/>
<br/>
After a minute, I said, &quot;By the way, Eric, I really appreciated the  <br/>
nice way you asked me about that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eric said, &quot;Well, I knew that you&#39;d only say No if you had a good  <br/>
reason.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, in case you think Eric is some kind of fantasy prodigy child and  <br/>
nothing like this could ever happen with yours, I will tell you that  <br/>
it is often very hard for him to hear No. He can get so fixated on  <br/>
what he wants that it becomes very hard, if not impossible, for him to  <br/>
see or accept alternatives or delays. Asking for things can be very  <br/>
fraught for him because even before he asks he&#39;s already sort of  <br/>
thinking to himself, &quot;What if they say No? I can&#39;t handled it! I have  <br/>
to have this!&quot; (though probably not in so many words).<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s a big thing for _him_ to think it through ahead of time and  <br/>
get to a place where, before he even asks, he&#39;s OK hearing either Yes  <br/>
or No. But it&#39;s a big thing for _me_ because moments like this make me  <br/>
think, &quot;It&#39;s working! It&#39;s getting through! The way we are parenting  <br/>
really does make a difference!&quot; He can put it into so many words!<br/>
<br/>
Story 2 is from today.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at Meijer to get me some new underwear. A few days ago,  <br/>
Carl (5) had been wishing for lollipops and I promised we would get  <br/>
him some the next time we were at Meijer. So, after I picked out my  <br/>
underwear, we headed over to the bulk candy aisle. On the way there,  <br/>
we had this conversation:<br/>
<br/>
Eric: Can I get something other than lollipops?<br/>
<br/>
Me: Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Carl: Can I get lollipops, AND something other than lollipops?<br/>
<br/>
Me: Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Carl: Just two things?<br/>
<br/>
Me: No, you can get anything you want.<br/>
<br/>
So we go to the bulk candy aisle, and, as the boys are shopping and  <br/>
choosing things, they ask questions and I say again more than once,  <br/>
&quot;Whatever you want is OK. Yes, you can also get that.&quot; and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what my two non-food-restricted boys chose when taken to a  <br/>
candy aisle full of bins they could grab from and told they could get  <br/>
anything they wanted, and as much as they wanted:<br/>
<br/>
Carl: six suckers. One handful (about 5) gumdrop candies. 4 Willy  <br/>
Wonka chewy candies, each about 1&quot; square. [The bag of Willy Wonka  <br/>
candies was so light it didn&#39;t register on the scale at the checkout.]<br/>
<br/>
Eric: double handful of chocolate coins. About a half dozen peppermint  <br/>
hard candies. And, OK, he did pretty well stuff a bag with Voortman  <br/>
Vanilla Wafers, but he especially loves those.<br/>
<br/>
Then they talked about whether they should get Yehva, 21 months,  <br/>
something of her own or just share with her. A conversation about what  <br/>
Yehva especially likes led to them deciding to get her some chocolate  <br/>
coins of her very own. &quot;But we can still share the other things with  <br/>
her,&quot; Carl said.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, I said mock-grumpily, &quot;Oh, sure, you guys get candy and  <br/>
I get _underwear_.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Both boys immediately said, &quot;I&#39;ll share mine with you, Mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yet another story that most of my friends would either not believe, or  <br/>
chalk up to my kids being some kind of mutant non-sugar-loving strain  <br/>
of humanity. But stuff like this happens all the time.<br/>
