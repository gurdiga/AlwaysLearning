<div id="ygrps-yiv-713644054">Duncan spilled a drink on our keyboard the other day. Killed it. So <br/>
we&#39;ve been without a keyboard for a couple of days. I&#39;ve been wanting <br/>
to respond to the diploma/GED thread, but couldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But I have a snazzy new keyboard now. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SO. First off, I had never been asked for my diploma---ever---until a <br/>
few years ago when we joined a homeschool accountability association <br/>
(to homeschool in SC). That association required that I produce one. I <br/>
couldn&#39;t. I know I have mine somewhere. I thought it was in my <br/>
scrapbook from high school, but it never materialized; so I had to <br/>
contact my high school and ask for a copy.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t have any. And they wouldn&#39;t make a up a special one for me. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What they *could* give me was a *transcript*.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I wasn&#39;t so all-fired up about sending this association my high <br/>
school transcript, but there simply wasn&#39;t an alternative at the time. <br/>
So I did. Now I *run* an association, and I don&#39;t require that the <br/>
&quot;teaching-parent&quot; send me an actual copy of her transcript OR diploma. <br/>
Just a guarantee that she has one is fine enough for me.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here actually ever been asked to produce a diploma??? For <br/>
ANY job???<br/>
<br/>
A diploma is simply a piece of paper. States that you have completed <br/>
the requirements of that school. High schools have different <br/>
requirements. Colleges don&#39;t even require diplomas---they actually want <br/>
transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a generic job application a while back. It doesn&#39;t ask whether <br/>
you have a *diploma*---it asks level of education: some high school, <br/>
high school graduate, some college, college graduate, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Original Poster: If you would like a diploma for your child, <br/>
please send me your child&#39;s name, your homeschool&#39;s name, and $29.95, <br/>
plus shipping and handling. I will calligraphy a piece of <br/>
parchment---tied up in a BOW even (what are your homeschool&#39;s colors?). <br/>
If you act NOW!, I&#39;ll make TWO diplomas! Two for the low, low price of <br/>
$29.95! (plus s&h) That&#39;s in case your child ever needs to homeschool <br/>
*her* children in the state of SC!<br/>
<br/>
As as a &quot;special gift,&quot; I will throw in a FREE bumper sticker that <br/>
says: &quot;The Truly Educated Never Graduate&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631689706">You know, I hadn&#39;t really pondered on it before, but to register as a  <br/>
homeschooler in NC, you have to be a high school graduate and I had  <br/>
to mail in a copy of my diploma.  Hmmmm....A bit ironic don&#39;t you  <br/>
think.  What if my NC homeschooled kids grow up in such a wonderful  <br/>
environment that they choose to homeschool their own kids.  What will  <br/>
they do about the diploma thing?<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I don&#39;t know why, but all this talk about GEDs makes me  <br/>
want to take the GED exam just to see what it is all about.  Is it  <br/>
hard?  Is it easy?  But then I might over-qualify myself what with  <br/>
already having a high school diploma and then a GED on top of that.   <br/>
