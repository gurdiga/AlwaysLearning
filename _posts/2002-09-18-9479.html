<div id="ygrps-yiv-470432992">I went to a Celtic Festival in Grass Valley this past weekend.  It <br/>
was WONDERFUL!  My friend and I also explored the Grass <br/>
Valley/Nevada City area.  I LOVE it!  I really felt as though I had <br/>
&#39;come home&#39;.  I am going to work on moving there within the next <br/>
year.  <br/>
I have felt restless and unsatisfied (a bit like always having one <br/>
foot out the door) this past year living here in Paradise.  I have <br/>
met very few unschoolers (2 to be exact, and one of those is in <br/>
Chico) and not a decent single man in sight &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
I found the people there to be friendly and welcoming.  There is a <br/>
lot of &#39;alternative&#39; stuff going on (medicine, enviromentalism, <br/>
music, spirituality, etc.), that I am interested in.  I didn&#39;t feel like a <br/>
round peg in a square hole for the first time in a year.<br/>
Apparently there are a large number of, &#39;not for religious <br/>
reasons&#39;, homeschoolers and unschoolers in the area (I&#39;m <br/>
going to research that one to check on it).<br/>

<br/>
I was born in Grass Valley!  My aunt and uncle still live there behind a<br/>
shop that they once owned, my grandfather started the shop back in the<br/>
30&#39;s.  Their house was built by an artist and author who was a friend of<br/>
our family, part of the construction still includes his original<br/>
paintings and a fireplace he built by hand from river rock and topped by<br/>
a sculpture.<br/>
<br/>
Downtown is a victorian house with a historical landmark sign, it was<br/>
used as a women&#39;s hospital for a while but is a private home again now. <br/>
I was born upstairs in a room that looks like a sort of turret on the<br/>
outside.<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely know what you mean about the place feeling like home. <br/>
Although most of the folks I knew as a child are dead now it still feels<br/>
like I belong there.  I have frequent dreams about moving back there,<br/>
into the house that my grandfather built.  I often wonder if I will<br/>
eventually move to live there one day, that would be a dream come true. <br/>
That little town is rich in history.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the new name of the shop or the type of business it is<br/>
but I&#39;ll ask my mom, she may know since she visits them from time to<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re in the area again you might want to check out a little town<br/>
called &quot;Rough And Ready&quot; which is where we lived when I was born.  My mom<br/>
says that the Grange building there is over 100 years old and is still in<br/>
use, she and my father attended dances there before I was born.  There<br/>
are a couple of other historical building there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Another beautiful place to see is the Empire Mine.  It has a small museum<br/>
and you can see the owner&#39;s &quot;cottage&quot; and grounds which contains one of<br/>
the first indoor pools.  My mom says that when the mine was in operation<br/>
it was so lound from the pounding of the hard rock ore that it could be<br/>
heard all the way into Grass Valley.  I bought a book on my last visit<br/>
there which is a great history on the narrow gague railroad, Grass Valley<br/>
and Nevada City.<br/>
<br/>
All this talk has me itching to get back there again, I could spend a<br/>
couple of weeks just wandering the area.<br/>
