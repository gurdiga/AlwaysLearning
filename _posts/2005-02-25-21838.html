<div id="ygrps-yiv-932036681">This is commentary on a small slice of life of a friend&#39;s son who is very <br/>
schooled.  I got to visit his Jr. High a few years back on the night when parents <br/>
visit each classroom to see the coolest stuff, and the science fair was on.  <br/>
He wasn&#39;t yet into the arts then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 What can one really say? &quot;Superb and gratifying&quot; don&#39;t do it.  REALLY don&#39;t <br/>
do it for me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
So the son, now in high school,  is going to go to a statewide gifted arts <br/>
conference.  Honestly the conference will probably be a blast, and I&#39;ve seen <br/>
some of his art and it&#39;s the kind of stuff corporations will pay big bucks for <br/>
for artsy new buildings, and he could become rich and famous.  Or not.  But it&#39;s <br/>
really good stuff. Interactive sculpture that makes you think.  And my friend <br/>
Michael, whom I see every year or two and have dearly loved since we were <br/>
teens in college, wrote this in the cover e-mail and it&#39;s funny and cute for him <br/>
to have written:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, I unabashedly am living vicariously through the kid.  I tried living my<br/>
<br/>
own life, but vicarious is definitely better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
&quot;I am thrilled that so many of my students have been selected for this <br/>
honor,&quot; said Kristine Hatanaka, the Artistic Director for the Art program at the <br/>
academy. &quot;The recognition of their talent and hard work is gratifying.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Benjamin Hersh, a Junior at Culver City High School and one of the winning <br/>
students, said, &quot;This has been a truly superb experience for me, and a <br/>
delightful opportunity for academy members to seek recognition for their continuously <br/>
growing skills.&quot;<br/>
***************<br/>
<br/>
Benjamin doesn&#39;t speak that way.  He hardly makes eye contact with adults.  <br/>
He expresses the posture and vocal inflections that say &quot;boredom and disdain.&quot;  <br/>
 Very school-kid behaviors, in that way.   Many one-word answers without joy, <br/>
in real life.  Restlessness.  But... He has a touch of the Asperger&#39;s.  Not <br/>
obvious at first, but his parents have thought so for years.  Yet he&#39;s zipping <br/>
along in the arts.  And he&#39;s not going to the convention for writing or <br/>
speaking. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688083649">This thread compels me to write about my 16 yo son Andrew who has Asperger&#39;s<br/>
and who has been unschooled for a couple of years now. Before that we were<br/>
part of a Summerhill type private school. He is a filmmaker and creative<br/>
writer. He hates to follow someone else&#39;s idea of a schedule, and really has<br/>
his own rhythm in life (I guess we all do...his seems more unique to me).<br/>
With the freedom of unschooling, we were able to hook up with a local movie<br/>
producer here in the Phoenix area, who is now producing Andrew&#39;s first film,<br/>
a dark comedy/horror. This producer has let the whole creation and<br/>
production of Andrew&#39;s movie come from him, and has been an unbelievable<br/>
support and resource. Tonight there are local actors coming over to do a<br/>
read-through of the script. Andrew went to Sundance Film Festival a few<br/>
weeks ago with the film producer and made some connections. When Andrew is<br/>
working on the film, he has light in his eyes, makes eye contact, and is<br/>
just so alive. You&#39;d not know he has had such major communication and social<br/>
issues in his life. This is so different from when he was in school<br/>
following a &quot;school&quot; schedule. He was (and sometimes still is) just like the<br/>
boy you described Sandra, flat affect, bored-looking, no eye contact. If he<br/>
was in school full time, I don&#39;t know what he would be doing or enjoying at<br/>
this point, since he wouldn&#39;t have had the time to pursue his passion. I am<br/>
so glad we are free. I hope that boy gets more joy too.<br/>

===============<br/>
 <br/>
Wow.  Fantastic story.  School would&#39;ve probably told him he  couldn&#39;t go to <br/>
the festival because he would miss a math test or some  lameness.<br/>
 <br/>
13 years or so ago there were two stores being told by homeschoolers.   Kinda <br/>
sickening stories.  One was of a kid who&#39;d been invited to go on tour  in <br/>
Europe with an orchestra or choir.  Her school said no and her parents  said <br/>
okay.  The other was, I think, a violinist with a change to go to  Australia.  <br/>
School said no, parents thought that reasonable. <br/>
 <br/>
HOW ON EARTH could *ANY* semester of any school at any level begin to  <br/>
compare to a trip to another continent to do something real with and for adults  AND <br/>
kids, something life-changing...  ?  And how could those kids&#39;  parents have <br/>
bowed down to the school?<br/>
 <br/>
In the case of my friend&#39;s son, he&#39;s gotten an opportunity by being in  <br/>
school, but Jacki&#39;s story is better, to me, because instead of her son applying  <br/>
through school for a school-sponsored thing, he influenced individuals as an  <br/>
individual, in the real world.<br/>
 <br/>
GOOD FOR HIM!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for telling that story.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I hope that boy gets more joy too.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well he&#39;s an only child, and I&#39;ve  never seen parents more dedicated  or <br/>
gentle and kindly with a child.  Other than school, which none of them  question, <br/>
he seems to have an enviable, ideal homelife and that&#39;s  wonderful.  <br/>

When my bil took his family to Vietnam for a vacation, the schools wanted to send homework.  My sil told them she was taking her kids to ASIA and they would not be doing homework there, thank you.  She did agree to have each of the kids write some kind of report though.<br/>
