<div id="ygrps-yiv-256631141">I brought my son to the zoo today with no agenda of what we should do. <br/>
It was really neat to see what he chose without my micro managing it<br/>
all.  He had SO much fun and I was more relaxed than ever.  In fact, the<br/>
time just flew by as I spent time enjoying the fresh air instead of<br/>
ordering him around, insisting we see ALL the animals.<br/>
<br/>
   There were lots of schools there and I could not help but notice the<br/>
stark difference.  I heard a teacher telling a child he was in time out;<br/>
15 students waiting in line to ride a train, then waiting on the train<br/>
for the train to go, then waiting again to go to the bathroom.  I was<br/>
exhausted just watching how their every move was so directed.  I was a<br/>
real rebel today, allowing my 3 year old to tell ME when he was ready<br/>
for his diaper change, which he did.  Okay, maybe a little later than I<br/>
would have prefered considering the diaper was almost falling out of his<br/>
pants, but hey.<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed how much my son was learning today - how much MORE he<br/>
learned because of his natural curiousity and questions.  He played full<br/>
of energy for two hours!!  I am NOT kidding!  This is his NATURAL energy<br/>
level.  Therefore, it hit home that making him feel bad because he goes<br/>
up a porch side ways, or because he runs and doesn&#39;t walk from point a<br/>
to point b is utterly cruel to a child.<br/>
<br/>
On the way out a daughter asked her Mom is she could play in the sand<br/>
pile.  The Mother replied, &quot;No, I am not sending you back to school<br/>
dirty.&quot; [:-s]<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this list which gives me a place to express my thoughts as I<br/>
grow as a parent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If he has lots of chances to run and climb, then the periodic mention that This Place is not the best for running or climbing isn&#39;t cruel, it&#39;s valuable information. But the &quot;lots of chances&quot; part is really, really important in that regard! Too many &quot;nos&quot; are hurtful And don&#39;t offer any useful information about the world. <br/>
