<div id="ygrps-yiv-192937209">I just got a job offer with my dads company. My hours would be from 7am-3pm. I might be able to get my sister to babysit my two girls while I am working but I am nervous about working such long hours and unschooling with them. I have been looking for a part time job but I hate to pass this up with my husband and I have marriage trouble. Please if any of you have any advice I could use it and quick. Thank you so much for your help.</div>

<br/>
Marriage first.  Unschooling only works with some stability.<br/>

<br/>
If the kids are in school for a while until you can get enough money  <br/>
and peace with your husband to make things solid and stable, then  <br/>
maybe you can unschool later.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d take the job.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426200876">Are you taking a job in order to be prepared financially for a separation? <br/>
Or is it to head off a separation?<br/>
<br/>
How does your dh feel about unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I would agree with Sandra that working on the marriage is priority one. Many <br/>
unschoolers have found Retrouvaille to be a marriage saver. It&#39;s free.<br/>
<br/>
www.retrouvaille.org<br/>
<br/>
It will be harder to unschool happily if you are also having to help your <br/>
children heal from divorce, even if your then ex-dh doesn&#39;t insist on <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I could unschool and work 8 hours/day outside of the home, <br/>
unless dh was home. But then I don&#39;t have any congenial family nearby as you <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
Your Dad&#39;s company? Any chance for more flexibility - telecommuting part of <br/>
the time - fewer hours - using the childcare at the job.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t say how old your two girls are. There is a lot of difference <br/>
between leaving a 13 and 14 year old with your sister versus leaving a 4 and <br/>
5 year old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702645755">I am the primary source of income for my family. It is not always easy, and surely my husband and I are continuously and ever-presently trying to live our lives harmoniously day to day, and many days that is a challenge. I work 32 hours a week, and sometimes more hours are required, but not too often (meaning I often draw the line with my employer even though they expect me to work until midnight on occasion--but I refuse--I&#39;ll quit at 4pm). My kids are aware of the fact that Mom is the one who works and brings in the money that provides for our lifestyle, which is decent. That said, we are highly spoiled. My mother-in-law, my mother, my sister-in-law, and my 16-yr old nephew are all are involved with the lives of my children, so perhaps we are not an example of the average family.  However, we make it work. I try to ensure that I have ample time to do what I need to do (errands, exercise, etc.) but I understand that often my kids needs come before my own. I guess, to sum it up, I am committed to making all of this work, and I feel pretty confident that it&#39;s already working. I think most families with a similar committment will make it work for them as well.<br/>
