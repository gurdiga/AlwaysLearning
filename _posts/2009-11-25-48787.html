Good, Pebs!! This reminds me that it&#39;s Wednesday and I didn&#39;t finish  <br/>
my gratitude set.  I still have time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful for this list and so many people who participate!<br/>
<br/>
My other gratitude posts are here, and I&#39;ll make a new one now.  SO  <br/>
glad you reminded me!<br/>

Ah! Possibly that was the original source on Facebook for the  daily <br/>
giving-of-thanks status &quot;challenge&quot;. I got it from someone else, but I&#39;m  really <br/>
pleased and thankful that it spread around-it is a great thing for  <br/>
unschooling, from what I can tell. The one I picked up was &quot;one status update of  <br/>
something you&#39;re thankful for each day through Thanksgiving&quot;, but mine has  <br/>
evolved.<br/>
 <br/>
It has prompted me to start thinking of things I am thankful  for <br/>
throughout the day, unprompted. It has been so *nice*, thinking of nice  things, <br/>
wonderful stuff, happy things that it has made all our lives a bit  brighter and <br/>
happier. Mind you, I&#39;m definitely an optimist and generally happy,  but I <br/>
can still occasionally get &quot;stuck&quot; in &quot;this sucks&quot; kind of attitudes, but  <br/>
this thankfulness exercise seems to have done the trick for being able to move <br/>
 away from that kind of thinking, quickly. Maybe I&#39;ve formed new synapses <br/>
or  exercized and strengthened parts of the brain that needed it, but it has  <br/>
definitely changed the way I think. I&#39;m enjoying posting something thankful <br/>
 every day *so* much that I&#39;m going to continue indefinitely. Whenever it <br/>
stops  being new or it becomes challenging to think of something new I&#39;m <br/>
thankful for,  it will dwindle out of existence for me. Right now, I&#39;m having a <br/>
hard time  sticking to ONE a day. :~)<br/>
 <br/>
I hope everyone has a wonderful time with their loved ones  today-we all <br/>
have so very much to be thankful for.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
De<br/>
