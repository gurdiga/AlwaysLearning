<div id="ygrps-yiv-820327538">I just wanted to share the great day I had with my 2.5 year old son Logan.<br/>
<br/>
He is at the age where people are questioning us about pre-school.<br/>
Everyone is in such a rush to get their kids out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
Today exemplified all of the reasons that Logan will be Unschooled.<br/>
We left the house and headed to the subway, (we live in Manhattan).<br/>
On the way there, Logan spotted a number of street signs.<br/>
He commented on their shapes and colors, he gets very excited by this.<br/>
We got to the subway, and he said we were taking the &quot;A&quot; train, so we sang the song together.<br/>
At 14th Street there is an elevator to get out of the subway, so he talked about going up and down.<br/>
We were headed downtown to a really fun water playground.<br/>
He had a blast playing in the water, filling up a cup and spilling it out.<br/>
He also practiced his climbing to get to the big curly slide.<br/>
Logan also got to socialize with lots of kids of many different ages.<br/>
Sometimes that takes some negotiating...he&#39;s learning.<br/>
After a few hours we headed back home.<br/>
When we got off of the train, Logan wanted to go to Central Park, which we call our back yard.<br/>
There is a small lake near us, and he loves to look at the ducks.<br/>
We watched the ducks; he counted sticks and threw them in the water, looked at trees, flowers and squirrels. Sometimes we see Raccoons too.<br/>
As an added bonus, there was a troop of actors performing Shakespeare.<br/>
There was sword fighting, so Logan wanted to watch the show.<br/>
<br/>
It was such a fun filled day with no nap, so now he is fast asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I never had this much fun, or got so much out of a day in school.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
BTW Sandra, your daughter Holly was quite impressive on You Tube.<br/>
My husband wants to hear more from young adults who have been unschooled.<br/>
I&#39;m going to have him watch her video.</div>

Thanks for this:  -=-BTW Sandra, your daughter Holly was quite  <br/>
impressive on You Tube.<br/>
My husband wants to hear more from young adults who have been  <br/>
unschooled.<br/>
I&#39;m going to have him watch her video.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some of the criticism Holly got from people who are sure they know  <br/>
more than she does about how to be normal included the suggestion that  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have enough social skill to make eye contact with a  <br/>
camera.   She was looking at the interviewer, and cameras don&#39;t have  <br/>
eyes....   And TWO people thought she had said she couldn&#39;t read at  <br/>
17.   Seems someone with a high school or college education would have  <br/>
the attention span for a video that&#39;s less than three minutes long.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thick-skinned about people criticizing me, but they were insulting  <br/>
my baby!!<br/>
(There were some nice comments, too.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722937073">I loved Holly&#39;s video. I thought she was great in it.<br/>
Having met her in person and exchanged a few words I know she looks righ in your eyes with a nice wide smile and she is just  so ...how can I put it sweet, adorable beautiful and at the same time confident and secure young woman.<br/>
Don&#39;t let those comments bother you.<br/>

<br/>
Only when the interview&#39;s being done remotely does the interviewee  <br/>
talk to the camera. Or probably they talk to a monitor next to the  <br/>
camera since if it&#39;s done by phone you can see their gaze wandering  <br/>
off sometimes. If the interviewer is there in the room with them,  <br/>
they talk to the interviewer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And, it&#39;s obvious to me that those people criticizing Holly, haven&#39;t<br/>
spent a lot of time with many young adults/older teens.  Other than<br/>
homeschooled or unschooled kids and the exceptions from public school,<br/>
most of that population that&#39;s been in school, don&#39;t have nearly the<br/>
sparkle or clarity that Holly displayed.  I thought it interesting that<br/>
someone even disparaged the fact that Holly liked her parents, as if<br/>
that wasn&#39;t a huge big deal in and of itself!</div>

After being a stranger to this list the past 4 years, this is my first glimpse of Holly other than early childhood pics.  I was so impressed by her confidence, and how comfortable she was with herself.  It bears repeating that her inner radiance comes shining through.  Wow.<br/>
