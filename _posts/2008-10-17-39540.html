<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693271050">-=-She&#39;s not really concerned about her<br/>
history knowledge, and has only recently wondered why people even want<br/>
or need to know history. That was a pretty interesting discussion.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I brought this from another topic.<br/>
<br/>
NObody &quot;knows history&quot; in a knows-everything-about-history way.   <br/>
Everyone knows more history than they think they do.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the interesting discussion referred to didn&#39;t involve the idea  <br/>
of &quot;know history&quot; in classroom kinds of ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918803674"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; NObody &quot;knows history&quot; in a knows-everything-about-history way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is almost exactly what I told her!  I told her about my interest in<br/>
various points in history and why I find them interesting and how I came<br/>
to find it interesting.<br/>
<br/>
My initial response was &quot;what are we talking here, history of the world,<br/>
history of the US, history of our state, history of China, Europe, and<br/>
how far back do we go?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Everyone knows more history than they think they do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was the majority of the discussion, how people absorb ideas of the<br/>
past in, just by living.  Somehow she came to understand that &quot;history&quot;<br/>
was knowing dates and such, probably like one of her friends was<br/>
learning in school.  Which is so NOT knowing about the past and where we<br/>
come from.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope the interesting discussion referred to didn&#39;t involve the idea<br/>
&gt; of &quot;know history&quot; in classroom kinds of ways.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well partly yes, because she wanted to know why schools made such a big<br/>
deal about it.  The conversation continued into how real history is<br/>
compared to date memorization, etc etc, then we talked about various<br/>
reasons why schools make a big deal of it, like knowing the past can<br/>
help people to not repeat their mistakes.  I also told her about how I<br/>
never made real historical connections until I was an adult and started<br/>
reading a lot of historical fiction, which is probably my favorite<br/>
genre.<br/>
<br/>
It was an interesting discussion because ultimately she sees everything<br/>
in connection with everything else.  She really didn&#39;t understand why<br/>
history was made into such a big deal in schools because it really is<br/>
all around us.  The whole idea of &quot;history&quot; was a bit of a mystery for<br/>
her.  So when she understood what it was that schools did with history,<br/>
it seemed to clear up some confusions in her own mind about the whole<br/>
concept of history/passing of time vs. history as a subject to be<br/>
taught.</div>

<br/>
When computer games were new things, the kids had some educational  <br/>
computer game about paintings and sculpture.  It was a museum mystery  <br/>
game.  One of the paintings we needed clues from was some guys on a  <br/>
boat, and we were supposed to identify the period of the painting.  I  <br/>
knew by the hats and costumes.  Unfortunately, somehow the &quot;real  <br/>
answer&quot; was to know it by the boat rigging.  And it was no big boat,  <br/>
either, but a little kind of six passenger slightly-bigger-than- <br/>
rowboat, with one sail.   Well hell, I don&#39;t have to know about that  <br/>
to identify periods.  There are clues in the painting style and the  <br/>
people and their facial hair, and hairdos, and hats...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Brett and I saw Nights in Rodanthe, and all the previews  <br/>
were for movies set in modern times.  This was notable, because Holly  <br/>
and I saw The Duchess the other day and all the previews were for  <br/>
&quot;period movies&quot;--none as old as The Duchess, but two from the 30&#39;s,  <br/>
one from the 40&#39;s, one 50&#39;s, and one from the 70&#39;s (Milk, which might  <br/>
be early 80&#39;s?).<br/>
<br/>
Holly noticed it the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids all are forming their own historical trails/tunnels/ <br/>
histories with what they know about toys, video games, computers,  <br/>
popular music, and movies.  Same me, of course.  I mentioned to a 30  <br/>
year old friend yesterday that I was David Bowie&#39;s first American  <br/>
fan.  He was skeptical.  I was calm.  I&#39;ll send him the link, which  <br/>
someday will have the newspaper envelope and photostat pictures  <br/>
scanned.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me if he believes me or not.  It was  <br/>
over 40 years ago.  His belief or disbelief doesn&#39;t change a single  <br/>
thing about it.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bowieletter">http://sandradodd.com/bowieletter</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve shown my kids where I saw the first Star Wars movie (the Lensic  <br/>
theater in Santa Fe, where I also saw The Sound of Music, when it was  <br/>
new, sitting in the back row holding hands with Frank Garcia), and  <br/>
where I saw three new Beatles movies (The El Rio in Espanola, and  <br/>
yes, everybody DID call it &quot;The El Rio&quot; whether they spoke English or  <br/>
Spanish).  That&#39;s some history, though it didn&#39;t seem like it at the  <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are living history right now, being part of the first really  <br/>
big batch of unschoolers.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it now, but they&#39;ll  <br/>
definitely have some stories to tell, whether unschooling gets more  <br/>
common or becomes wildly unpopular or illegal or whatever!  :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That part is fun to me, because it&#39;s like a mystery.  I identify old<br/>
paintings with clothing too.  The Dutch really had the clothing thing<br/>
going on in their paintings too, so often that&#39;s a clue for me of where<br/>
the artist came from.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was trying to figure out how old sleeves were made and I used<br/>
dutch paintings to figure that out.  I&#39;m sure there were other resources<br/>
out there, but it was fun to kind of go to the source of actual<br/>
historical documentation rather than take someone&#39;s word for it, even if<br/>
they were an expert.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our kids all are forming their own historical trails/tunnels/<br/>
&gt; histories with what they know about toys, video games, computers,<br/>
&gt; popular music, and movies.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly why my husband doesn&#39;t like to get rid of stuff!  Our<br/>
house has a lot of weird items tucked away.  We like to browse thrift<br/>
stores and antique stores just to find unusual things of the not so<br/>
distant past.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our kids are living history right now, being part of the first really<br/>
&gt; big batch of unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I started to think about, after this conversation was this<br/>
idea of failing or not failing a history class.  Chamille has a friend<br/>
who isn&#39;t doing so well in her history class.  The idea of it seems so<br/>
absurd to me.  I mean, if we had the ability of time travel maybe we&#39;d<br/>
all be experts in history.  The idea that someone could fail &quot;history&quot;<br/>
is such a weird thing to consider.  I know in reality she probably got<br/>
dates wrong, but for someone like her, or others that don&#39;t do numbers<br/>
well, that&#39;s a really bad way to look at history.  Even for people who<br/>
do like numbers, history isn&#39;t about that.  To me, it&#39;s more about the<br/>
evolution of ideas and how they are physically portrayed.<br/>
<br/>
What we have are other people&#39;s documentation of things of the past,<br/>
books, music, pictures, objects, etc.  These things are all around us,<br/>
and things of the 20th century will be around for many many years still.<br/>
Something that used to really bother me in school was how history seemed<br/>
to be documented by dates of wars. conquering of lands, and famous male<br/>
figures, things I really don&#39;t have a lot of interest in, it&#39;s only<br/>
notable peripherally.  I was more interested in what people actually did<br/>
on a day to day basis in various points in time and I wanted to know not<br/>
only what people from the US or England did, but what people from Japan<br/>
or India did.  I had to wait until college to learn some of that stuff. <br/>
My kids can learn these things any time they want to, whenever it<br/>
interests them.  That&#39;s really exciting to me!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Kinda like the movie Back to the Future, a person from the future<br/>
would completely mess up the present and future.  <br/>
<br/>
So many things in that movie made me laugh, like when he ordered a<br/>
Tab, which my kids now have NO idea what he&#39;s talking about just like<br/>
the guy from the diner.  And how he&#39;s wearing a down vest and the guy<br/>
from the diner thinks he&#39;s in the Navy.  And the skateboard scene...my<br/>
son loves that!  Graham can&#39;t contemplate a time w/out skateboards! <br/>
<br/>
Back in the 70&#39;s when I went to school I moved a lot and it seemed all<br/>
I ever learned was early American history (over and over again).  I<br/>
was soooo bored with it.  But I never learned about the stuff that<br/>
really interested me, it wasn&#39;t until I saw the TV series Roots that I<br/>
really was turned on to history.  Blown away by that aspect of<br/>
history, but I don&#39;t recall ever talking about it in school.<br/>
<br/>
All those years of American history, I never learned about the<br/>
Japanese interment camps.  Not until a movie I saw in my 20&#39;s (not in<br/>
school).  Again, blown away...mostly that I didn&#39;t know about it!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After reading that book, I began to reconnect with my interest in history.  Great fun.<br/>
<br/>
On a different topic, I was channel surfing and landed on a show on the History Channel <br/>
that just didn&#39;t sound that interesting to me at first.  It was ancient military technology.  It <br/>
was fascinating, and mostly centered around Asia.  <br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, whole wars were lost, sometimes, out at sea before even landing due to <br/>
bad timing and/or the wrong equipment.  If fact, Japan was the last hold-out to Ghengis <br/>
Khan and had become a thorn in his side with all the pirating--that&#39;s a different pirate <br/>
image, huh?  He sent everything he had--perhaps 10,000 ships.  Meanwhile, the Japanese <br/>
prayed for deliverance.  It came in the form of a storm that sank almost everything as the <br/>
Mongolians reached the Japanese coast--a &quot;wind of God&quot; that they called &quot;Kamikaze.&quot;  <br/>
Direct connection to modern times.  <br/>
<br/>
And, in school, I didn&#39;t learn anything about the whole range and scope of Ghengis Khan-<br/>
-just that he was a barbarian conqueror.  I&#39;m thinking he was a little more than that.  He <br/>
had a territory that was something like 3 times the size of the United States at one time, if <br/>
the history channel was right.  I think that was important to a lot of people!<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t get why they have to sacrifice wonderful stories for the dry memorization of <br/>
dates and names.  It makes the conspiracy theories pretty believable.<br/>
