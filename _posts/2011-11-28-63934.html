<div id="ygrps-yiv-37963504">My son just turned nine, so there is no urgency for me to think about his teen years.  Yet, it is something I do think about regularly, partly out of my own apprehension of what is to come.  I was not an easy teen, and I made a lot of really poor choices.  I know now that was partly because I was reacting to all of the controls and unreliable adults in my life, but I would still find it very helpful to read about the lives of unschooled teens so that I can see a different outcome to my own.  Any suggestions - books, websites, lists?</div>

If you&#39;re near enough to come to the ALL Unschooling Symposium, there will be several teen and young-adult offspring of longtime contributors to this list.<br/>

Other conferences give chances to observe, meet and talk to older unschoolers and their parents, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-314319042">Hi Karen-<br/>
<br/>
I strongly recommend this book:<br/>
<br/>
Parent/Teen Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach<br/>
<br/>
It is not about unschooled teens, but it was recommended to me by <br/>
unschooling parents, and was very helpful to me as my kids reached the <br/>
teen years<br/>
<br/>
My kids have not always had the easiest time as teens, for a variety of <br/>
reasons, but the unschooling approach has always helped us through <br/>
difficult situations. Saying connected to my children has NEVER been a <br/>
bad thing. I can&#39;t speak to how kids &quot;turn out&quot; in the long run, as <br/>
adults, as mine are now only 14 and 18, but at this moment we are all <br/>
very pleased with the in the moment results of unschooling. The older <br/>
one is in college, and is enjoying it and adapting to the change in <br/>
lifestyle easily. The younger one is often lonely, as most of her <br/>
homeschooled peers have gone to school, but is committed to unschooling, <br/>
is developing her own interests, and her sense of self is quite positive.<br/>
