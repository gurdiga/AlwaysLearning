<div id="ygrps-yiv-237033701">&lt;&lt;The woman in me will be proud that day, but the mommy in me wishes <br/>
they could<br/>
stay little.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And the mommy in me is shocked that Holly is 11!! My head knew that, <br/>
but I still see her as a darling little girl playing with a dollhouse <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Time flies&quot; is SO much more than just a saying. Time is a damned <br/>
freight train.<br/>

Kass & Kree asked DH and me when we will stop referring to them as &quot;the <br/>
babies&quot;, to which we replied, &quot;Never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were like, &quot;So when we are grandmas and you are still alive you&#39;ll still <br/>
call us the babies? &quot; <br/>
<br/>
DH said it faster than me, &quot;Sure, you&#39;ll still be our babies.&quot; They walked <br/>
away rolling their eyes and smiling at the same time.<br/>

long time, I refer to him as &quot;my baby&quot;.  That&#39;s said looking up, way up, at<br/>
him.  But he&#39;ll always be my baby because he&#39;s my last.<br/>
