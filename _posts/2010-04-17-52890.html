I&#39;m assuming everyone knows not to click on the link in Jacqueline&#39;s<br/>
email.<br/>
<br/>
Jacqueline you&#39;ve probably got a virus!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I deleted the post in the archives.   I think it might not be a virus,  <br/>
but just some internet bot that disguises itself as different people&#39;s  <br/>
e-mail addresses, and that address could make it through to that yahoo  <br/>
group.  I don&#39;t think those live in computers, but on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
I get mail from myself sometimes.  Kirby got mail from himself a  <br/>
couple of days ago.<br/>
I just deleted it.  I can&#39;t stop it.  I&#39;m sure there are geeks in the  <br/>
full-time business of trying to stop it, at yahoo or wherever all.<br/>
