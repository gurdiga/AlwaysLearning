<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858850674">This is supposidly a myth (love my creative spelling, this is the one <br/>
list I can sorta feel comfortable not fixing it).  However, I personally <br/>
always get a little sick after the shot.<br/>
<br/>
I am supposed to get one every year, but with a new car, a car accident, <br/>
my sister who is sick, my job (teaching) which is a pain, and my <br/>
impending (and now over) surgery, it never happened.  now it won&#39;t as <br/>
there are none left.  I have lung issues so it would have been better if <br/>
I had gotten one.  My kids didn&#39;t get one either, nor did Mark...  I <br/>
guess I will rely upon lots of white light and healthy living.<br/>
