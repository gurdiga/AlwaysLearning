<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414219765">--=-When I was in college I hung out with... (I hanged out with? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
art students and they all had been required to buy a deck of colored<br/>
cards for some horrible amount of money like $36 (probably like $100<br/>
in todays gas prices) --=-<br/>
<br/>
That makes me think  of a book I bought at the used bookstore, while  <br/>
I was in High School.<br/>
It had 8 color chips. You were to put the color chips in order of  <br/>
your favorite, best to least.<br/>
Then, it had a key which explained your personality or mood based on  <br/>
the order you picked the colors.<br/>
Hours of fun. :)<br/>
