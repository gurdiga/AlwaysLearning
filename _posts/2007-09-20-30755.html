<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826744076">Thanks for the comments on my last post. It helps to know what Sean <br/>
White and Tony Hawk&#39;s opinions are on passion. I certainly needed that <br/>
bit of re-enforcement and reminder of what it is I am actually helping <br/>
my kids do in this unschooling thing. But is it healthy for them to be <br/>
so absolutely bored with everything else? If they can&#39;t participate in <br/>
their sport, or watch something about it, or shop for items related to <br/>
it, they are completely at a loss, and seem unhappy. I have tried all <br/>
I can do to bring related info in, but I am feeling a bit ineffective.<br/>
People I know here that unschool with their families all have kids who <br/>
are very passionate about a few things, so it seems they always stay <br/>
pretty busy following those passions. Am I doing something wrong?<br/>

magazines, go see big-name competitors speak or demonstrate. Maybe  <br/>
plan a snowboard trip to another country or to Alaska or somewhere  <br/>
really exciting?<br/>

My nephew (he is German, grew up in Germany), came to visit here when  <br/>
he was 15. He was a serious skateboarder and, while he was here for 6  <br/>
weeks, one summer, we spent a lot of time in his &quot;skateboarding&quot;  <br/>
world. He had places he wanted to see, stores he wanted to spend  <br/>
hours and hours in, browsing and &quot;talking shop&quot; with all the guys who  <br/>
sell wheels, etc. (He spoke little English, but somehow managed to  <br/>
talk to other skateboarders and improved his English a lot, that  <br/>
way.) He had places he wanted to go skateboard - Venice Beach, for  <br/>
example.<br/>
