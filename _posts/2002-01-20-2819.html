<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573660467">First of all, hello everyone. Peggy introduced me to this list. My<br/>
name&#39;s Tara and it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you all. After reading just a<br/>
day worth of posts, I think I&#39;ve met some kindred spirits.<br/>
 <br/>
This morning I wanted to take Isaiah (4 d.s.) to the planetarium. He<br/>
kept telling me he wanted to go to the Children&#39;s Museum. I said we&#39;ll<br/>
go to the planetarium today and the Children&#39;s Museum tomorrow, which he<br/>
was still not too happy about. My brother-in-law called and asked if he<br/>
wanted to go hiking. I said sure. Isaiah started saying, rather loudly,<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to go hiking. I want to go to the Children&#39;s Museum.&quot; I<br/>
promptly told BIL I&#39;d call him back. I told Isaiah we&#39;d go to the<br/>
planetarium and then hiking and TOMORROW we&#39;d go to the Children&#39;s<br/>
Museum. (The reason I&#39;m so insistent on going today is that they have a<br/>
program geared just toward his age group today.) He looked at me and<br/>
said, &quot;Mom, you are not respecting my wishes. I want to go to the<br/>
Children&#39;s Museum.&quot; I was getting a bit upset, so I gave myself a quiet<br/>
time-out in the bathroom. I was looking in the mirror when I thought,<br/>
&quot;He&#39;s right. I&#39;m not respecting his wishes. I&#39;m pushing this planetarium<br/>
thing on him, because I want him to see it, when all he really wants is<br/>
to go to the Children&#39;s Museum. If I take him to the museum today,<br/>
there&#39;s many other Saturdays I can take him to the planetarium. It&#39;s<br/>
much more important to tell him and show him that I *do* respect his<br/>
wishes than to expose him to the planetarium.&quot; So, I came out of the<br/>
bathroom and told him that he was right, I wasn&#39;t respecting him. He<br/>
looked me square in the eyes, smiled and said, &quot;Thanks, Mom.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I think the best thing I&#39;ve taught Isaiah is to speak his truth.<br/>
Sometimes that can seem disrespectful. That&#39;s only because I was taught<br/>
to mind my elders and not talk back. I&#39;ve also spent 30 years not living<br/>
for myself, but doing what everyone else wanted. I don&#39;t want that for<br/>
Isaiah.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes it takes a time-out to make you come to your senses. I&#39;d<br/>
rather take one than hurt his feelings. <br/>
 <br/>
After all, he&#39;s just like a tiny shoot coming out of the ground in<br/>
Spring, aiming his tiny leaves at the sun. Those tiny shoots are so<br/>
fragile. You tend them with love and kindness, and they grow to be<br/>
beautiful flowers to bring beauty and hearty plants that bring<br/>
nourishment.<br/>
 <br/>
Glad to be here.<br/>
 <br/>
Namaste,<br/>
Tara<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He really is incredible. His eyes are so deep and thoughtful, it really<br/>
is hard to believe he is only four. I like your idea of a time out to<br/>
think things through rather than reacting impulsively.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. And there is a time for learning and coming to terms with<br/>
the inner self and a time for working through and learning how to think<br/>
about what others are feeling and thinking. I think a too early emphasis<br/>
for toddlers and preschoolers on the outer view can be very harmful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Glad you checked it out. Did you peek over at the Canadian Homeschool<br/>
site too and check out the Quilt 4 Afghanistan site? Don&#39;t for get to<br/>
click on the Additional Prizes button and check out the beautiful pillow<br/>
and tapestry.  And, for anyone who wants to buy a raffle ticket, I<br/>
believe they are now taking PayPal payments too. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
