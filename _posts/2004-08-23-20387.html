&lt;&lt; Nobody knows for sure. &lt;g&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know what I think, but it doesn&#39;t match everyone else&#39;s thoughts. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some of us will claim to have unschooled our children from birth. Some only<br/>
from 5 or 6 years old. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some will claim to have unschooled from birth and then put their kids in <br/>
school when they&#39;re five, and so in such cases I think they just had kids and sent <br/>
them to school on schedule.<br/>
<br/>
The exception and dissent seems mostly to be from Delaware, which is weird.   <br/>
There are places in that part of the world where kids get on waiting lists <br/>
for preschools before they&#39;re even born, and to be cool among moms, your two <br/>
year old needs to be in a prep school.  They assure me this is seriously true.  <br/>
<br/>
In such cases, some families have to fight the relatives and say &quot;we&#39;re <br/>
homeschooling&quot; when their kid can&#39;t even pull up his own pants.<br/>
<br/>
My own opinion is that kids are home with their parents no matter whether <br/>
they will later go to school or not.   Whether the time they don&#39;t go to school <br/>
is three, four, five or six years old, until that day they don&#39;t go to school, <br/>
why would they be &quot;homeschooled&quot;?<br/>
There wasn&#39;t any schooling option/avoidance/rejection.<br/>
<br/>
If the state says a child has to be enrolled in school by the start-of-school <br/>
nearest or after his fifth birthday or whatever/however each state words it, <br/>
THEN the moment that child doesn&#39;t get on the bus, THEN the parents have made <br/>
the plunge.   He is not in school, they are responsible, and they  have become <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Before that they might&#39;ve been thinking about it, planning it, living for it, <br/>
but they didn&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
That is my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
If they were living those first five yto bathroom, waiting until 11:45 to eat <br/>
lunch and only allowing 20 minutes in silence (or whatever), were those kids <br/>
in school?  No, not until they got to school.<br/>

There wasn&#39;t any schooling  option/avoidance/rejection&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have been discussing this with a few friends of mine.  There is a  Mom with <br/>
a 3 YO son.  He goes to a Montessori preschool three times a week  and she <br/>
calls herself an unschooler.  She has said that she believes this  is an <br/>
enriching environment where he can learn and get some social  interaction.<br/>
 <br/>
My thinking was that he is not even old enough in NC to be homeschooled so  <br/>
how can she begin to say he is unschooled.<br/>
 <br/>
Second:  He is in SCHOOL!!!!   The other moms said &quot;well she  needed a break <br/>
from him so to her it is like a baby-sitter or Mom&#39;s Morning  Out.<br/>
 <br/>
Third: Her thought process is still that of &quot;this place is the place he  will <br/>
learn.&quot;  Not that &quot;leaning happens everywhere.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I do believe that he will just continue on in the Montessori program.   I <br/>
have been thinking about this a lot the past few days.  And I can&#39;t wrap  my <br/>
brain around it.  I can&#39;t understand how these other mom&#39;s can see that  if he is <br/>
3 and in school he is not homeschooling and certainly not  unschooling.  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Just a couple of my thoughts,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382578125">&lt;&lt;&lt; Do children have to be &quot;school aged&quot; to unschool?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;When parents of preschoolers call or write to me about homeschooling, I<br/>
make a distinction between youngsters and &quot;school aged.&quot;  In California,<br/>
kindergarten is (for now) not mandatory, so school aged means 6 and first<br/>
grade.  Unschooling starts at birth, IMO, but homeschooling starts when you<br/>
don&#39;t institutionalize your kid in mandatory school &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote the following when this same issue came up on U/D a little while<br/>
ago. <br/>
<br/>
My decision is to call us Unschoolers even though Jayn is still below the<br/>
legal age.<br/>
<br/>
We had decided to homeschool before Jayn was born. We joined a newly formed<br/>
local support group when Jayn was 18 months old, three years ago, and I had<br/>
already been on the HSC list. I was reading John Holt, but had not really<br/>
had the courage or understanding to commit to unschooling until Pam<br/>
Sorooshian let me know about this list [UnschoolingDiscussion] - but I don&#39;t<br/>
remember exactly when that was.<br/>
<br/>
I have to call myself an Unschooler, and have done for a while, as I am<br/>
surrounded by people who are most emphatically not unschoolers in my hs<br/>
group. I finally had to &quot;come out&quot; at my group although I knew a long time<br/>
before doing so. Most of them are relaxed/eclectic, but still use curriculum<br/>
materials, some are charter, and most have &quot;educational goals&quot; for their<br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
There is definitely an aura that they feel slightly superior and view my<br/>
unschooling being not so much dangerous neglect, but a crackpot experiment<br/>
that will undoubtedly fade away once Jayn gets older and starts to need more<br/>
teaching. I have no fear of this occurring myself! <br/>
<br/>
Most are rigidly controlling of food, tv, computers and how their time is to<br/>
be spent. They are also wonderfully gentle, non-spanking parents who allow<br/>
their children the opportunity to develop their own games and relationships<br/>
at the park without the constant mediation and bossiness that characterizes<br/>
the &quot;ordinary&quot; parents we see at parks. <br/>
<br/>
So many of these hs&#39;ers I know are &quot;following a program&quot; even for their<br/>
little children, recommending the &quot;early reading&quot; and &quot;reading readiness&quot;<br/>
materials. They look for resources for &quot;early immersion Spanish&quot; or take<br/>
classes, seek out teachable moments, or insist that their children must do a<br/>
certain amount of various subjects before playing. I hear the conversations<br/>
although I don&#39;t usually participate in them. The parents strive to make it<br/>
&quot;more interesting&quot; and sometimes even use (gasp!) videos as part of some<br/>
unit studies. These are 3 and 4 and 5 year olds. <br/>
<br/>
They talk about how they did &quot;The Food Pyramid&quot; (as if there were only one)<br/>
so that they could explain why their parental food controls were right. They<br/>
genuinely delight in how much fun the kids had cutting out little pictures<br/>
of fruit etc and sticking them on some chart they downloaded. (Jayn has not<br/>
shown the slightest interest in this type of activity so far - she likes to<br/>
cut out paper dolls, snowflakes or geometric shapes for use in collages.) <br/>
<br/>
There is plenty of talk about how much enjoyment their child gets from the<br/>
whatever Unit they are doing, and how &quot;We have to stop or she&#39;d want to<br/>
learn ALL the State capitols in ONE DAY!&quot; I always say, &quot;So, why stop?&quot; The<br/>
answers are always either along the lines of some other commitment coming up<br/>
in the next half hour, or parental exhaustion. There is always a sense of<br/>
envy (not from me!) for those parents whose children love to do workbooks<br/>
from the &quot;unlucky&quot; ones whose children resist the things.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the children go, when the homeschoolers are all playing together<br/>
at the park, it is impossible to tell which ones use Abeka or Sonlight or<br/>
whatever (names I have heard but know nothing about) from the Unit studiers<br/>
or Jayn. It is only when they start to interact with their own parents that<br/>
differences in parenting become discernible. There are quite a few parents<br/>
who are ready to jump in with &quot;Did you say Thank you for that cracker?&quot;.<br/>
There are sometimes: &quot;Can we go to Sophia&#39;s tomorrow?&quot; &quot;We have to finish<br/>
our school work first&quot;; and the occasional inexplicable &quot;May I take off my<br/>
sweater?&quot; &quot;No&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It is those moments that remind me with a jolt that I am an Unschooler with<br/>
a whole different mind set. Thank goodness!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Robyn summed up nicely why I think unschooling is something that can be<br/>
claimed from birth.<br/>
<br/>
The whole mindset of a parent of a two year old who will be going to<br/>
preschool next year or is in a homeschooling family and has his future<br/>
learning mapped out for him is different from the mindset of a parent of a<br/>
two year old who they know will be unschooled. The life of the child is<br/>
different, too, unless the parents are &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;let them play&quot;<br/>
until they&#39;re five.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe we should call it pre-unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

unschooling or not hinged on the state&#39;s minimum compulsory attendance<br/>
laws.  I was asking, with examples of state laws, if I understood you<br/>
correctly or not.<br/>
<br/>
In answer to your other questions:<br/>
No, I&#39;m suggesting that unschooling (and homeschooling, for that<br/>
matter), are separate from school, and that both (assuming parents<br/>
don&#39;t send their children to school in the interim) might start quite<br/>
in advance of a state&#39;s minimum compulsory attendance age.<br/>
No.  I was trying to understand what you said.<br/>
What I was really asking was if I understood you or not.<br/>
I wanted to know what you meant and if I understood it for my own<br/>
edification.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759098209">I am having trouble grasping this concept (see quotation below please) <br/>
maybe someone can help me.<br/>
<br/>
Is the family who decided to unschool from birth suddenly transformed by <br/>
the click of the clock over to midnight on the first day of school? Are <br/>
they suddenly in possession of a whole new set of ideals and credos <br/>
because their child went from being pre-school age to being school aged?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t the family who decided to unschool from birth &quot;living and <br/>
learning&quot; from real life just as the parents of older children are vs. <br/>
employing hothousing practices such as flash cards to cause pre-school <br/>
learning to happen artificially?<br/>
<br/>
I am a SAHM and have many other responsibilities besides taking care of <br/>
my child (shopping, cooking, cleaning, gardening, starting a nonprofit, <br/>
taking care of pets, etc.) responsibilities that would be much easier to <br/>
handle if I put my child in daycare. But I have the same problems with <br/>
daycare that I have with school: not enough one on one interaction, too <br/>
much emphasis on &quot;schoolish&quot; activities, too much emphasis on gender <br/>
specific toys, discipline that is too punitive, artificial division of <br/>
the day into different activities based on a pre-formed schedule, etc. I <br/>
could go on all day.<br/>
<br/>
So because I believe so wholeheartedly in the unschooling philosophy, I <br/>
choose to &quot;unschool&quot; starting now, rather than to put my child in the <br/>
hands of someone who would make her eat &quot;balanced meals,&quot;  or tell her <br/>
that she can&#39;t use finger paints because it&#39;s time to be read to, or <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It goes beyond the choice to send my child to daycare or not though. It <br/>
encompasses my decisions to let her eat what she wants, play with <br/>
whatever toy she wants, go outside when she wants, brush her own teeth, <br/>
etc. rather than imposing arbitrary limits. Limits  that are the norm in <br/>
most families.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am already doing it (unschooling) at least to the maximum <br/>
extent that I can for a 15 month old. There are some decisions that I <br/>
feel must still be made for her but in the not too distant future I <br/>
think she will be able to make them herself too.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I am trying to ask is I feel like we are unschoolers <br/>
already. Is that truly not possible?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

educational method or not.  <br/>
<br/>
If you see it as a form of &quot;curriculum&quot; (I use that term loosely),<br/>
then, no you&#39;re not &quot;really&quot; unschooling until the magic school-age<br/>
for your state.<br/>
<br/>
If you see it as a lifestyle choice (as you seem to), then, yes, you<br/>
are already unschoolers.  (I&#39;m of the latter opinion).<br/>

I don&#39;t think unschooling is ideals and credos.  I think it&#39;s natural <br/>
learning instead of school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t the family who decided to unschool from birth &quot;living and <br/>
<br/>
learning&quot; from real life just as the parents of older children are vs. <br/>
<br/>
employing hothousing practices such as flash cards to cause pre-school <br/>
<br/>
learning to happen artificially?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Just like people learned before schools were invented.  Just like <br/>
people learn who go to school and then get out and start learning on their own.  <br/>
Just like schoolkids learned before they went to school (if they were lucky; the <br/>
way I learned before I went to school).<br/>
<br/>
I did a TON of learning on my own as a kid--in the summer I sometimes learned <br/>
more than during the schoolyear. I learned a lot during school, reading books <br/>
under my desk.  I was in 4-H, girlscouts, church education groups (Bible <br/>
history, girls&#39; auxiliary, training union), ALL voluntarily.  But I wasn&#39;t <br/>
unschooled.   I was a schoolkid who liked to learn.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am a SAHM and have many other responsibilities besides taking care of <br/>
<br/>
my child (shopping, cooking, cleaning, gardening, starting a nonprofit, <br/>
<br/>
taking care of pets, etc.) responsibilities that would be much easier to <br/>
<br/>
handle if I put my child in daycare. But I have the same problems with <br/>
<br/>
daycare that I have with school: not enough one on one interaction, too <br/>
<br/>
much emphasis on &quot;schoolish&quot; activities, too much emphasis on gender <br/>
<br/>
specific toys, discipline that is too punitive, artificial division of <br/>
<br/>
the day into different activities based on a pre-formed schedule, etc. I <br/>
<br/>
could go on all day.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called attachment parenting.   I think it&#39;s wonderful.  Did it myself!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So because I believe so wholeheartedly in the unschooling philosophy, I <br/>
<br/>
choose to &quot;unschool&quot; starting now, rather than to put my child in the <br/>
<br/>
hands of someone who would make her eat &quot;balanced meals,&quot;  or tell her <br/>
<br/>
that she can&#39;t use finger paints because it&#39;s time to be read to, or <br/>
<br/>
whatever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Attachment parenting, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It goes beyond the choice to send my child to daycare or not though. It <br/>
<br/>
encompasses my decisions to let her eat what she wants, play with <br/>
<br/>
whatever toy she wants, go outside when she wants, brush her own teeth, <br/>
<br/>
etc. rather than imposing arbitrary limits. Limits  that are the norm in <br/>
<br/>
most families.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mindful, respectful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I feel like I am already doing it (unschooling) at least to the maximum <br/>
<br/>
extent that I can for a 15 month old. There are some decisions that I <br/>
<br/>
feel must still be made for her but in the not too distant future I <br/>
<br/>
think she will be able to make them herself too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that kind of mindful freedom-allowing parenting is a good framework <br/>
for unschooling families, but it is not in and of itself unschooling, in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I guess what I am trying to ask is I feel like we are unschoolers <br/>
<br/>
already. Is that truly not possible?-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about words and concepts and categories.  I don&#39;t consider it <br/>
unschooling.  Others do.<br/>

The exception and dissent seems mostly to be from Delaware, which is weird.  There are places in that part of the world where kids get on waiting lists <br/>
for preschools before they&#39;re even born, and to be cool among moms, your two year old needs to be in a prep school.  They assure me this is seriously true.  <br/>

In such cases, some families have to fight the relatives and say &quot;we&#39;re homeschooling&quot; when their kid can&#39;t even pull up his own pants.&quot;<br/>

I started saying we were homeschooling when my son was 4 and didn&#39;t go to preschool.  It is expected that any child over the age of 3 is in school.  It is easier to say we are homeschooling than to explain that we plan to homeschool when he is school-age.

what my family does instead of school is to say that we live as <br/>
though school doesn&#39;t exist.  This is the reason that I don&#39;t even <br/>
love to use the word &quot;unschool&quot; but rather learning through living <br/>
or some other variation that isn&#39;t so reactionary to the concept of <br/>
school.  <br/>
So in that sense, the kind of lifestyle that we are striving for can <br/>
certainly start at day one (birth).  I guess it seems to me that the <br/>
lifestyle -apart from labels- has no age limit, but once you attach <br/>
the word &quot;unschool&quot; to it then it makes sense that you must be <br/>
school age to &quot;un&quot;do it.  Does that make sense? I&#39;m thinking as I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340974666">When I wrote that, I meant to include a reference to the &quot;first day of <br/>
school&quot; discussion that has been going on in the unschooling discussion <br/>
group. It seemed to be a point of great pride amongst unschoolers to <br/>
report, &quot;We didn&#39;t even notice when the first day of school happened, we <br/>
are that indifferent to it,&quot; or something along those lines when asked <br/>
how do they celebrate not going back to school.<br/>
<br/>
So why is the first day of kindergarten for one family so significant if <br/>
the rest of the first days of school are so beneath the notice of most <br/>
unschoolers? I tend to think that when DD turns 5 or 6 (not sure what <br/>
the law is, just moved here, I&#39;ll have to look it up) WE won&#39;t notice <br/>
when the first day of school rolls around either. How would we even know <br/>
unless we actively went seeking that info? Why would we care?<br/>
<br/>
Someone said here recently that unschooling is a subset of <br/>
homeschooling, that without school, there would be no homeschooling. I <br/>
don&#39;t look at it that way at all. That we need to focus on the existence <br/>
of school to emphasize the choice to homeschool, and that unschooling is <br/>
a type of homeschooling . . . I don&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t feel right. It <br/>
feels too . . . inextricably connected to the school system. Like if I <br/>
am wearing a black shirt, I don&#39;t refer to it as a &quot;not white&quot; shirt. <br/>
It&#39;s apparent and need not be emphasized. If there were no such thing as <br/>
school there would be ONLY homeschooling. So I don&#39;t get that.<br/>
<br/>
I feel absolutely no pull to define myself in terms of &quot;not school&quot; or <br/>
even &quot;X type of homeschooler.&quot; I wish there was a term for unschooling <br/>
that didn&#39;t even contain the word school. Some call it child-led <br/>
learning, or delight-driven learning. Those seem to me to be a more <br/>
accurate description of what unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
Of course that is totally subjective, I&#39;m not suggesting that anyone <br/>
should stop calling themselves unschoolers if that&#39;s what they prefer. <br/>
But the more I am told that what I am doing is attachment parenting and <br/>
not unschooling, the more disenchanted I become with the term <br/>
unschooling. Attachment parenting has to do with being responsive, yes, <br/>
but it&#39;s not about removing limits the way unschooling is. There are WAY <br/>
more limits in most AP households than in mine. And even more limits in <br/>
non AP households. I am consciously implementing the unschooling <br/>
philosophy now, so that there is no difficult transition later.  That is <br/>
not the same as practicing AP.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I raise a concern about the future for my family in the context <br/>
of unschooling, I am often told by those who have been through it, &quot;Just <br/>
live life and it&#39;ll work out.&quot; So that&#39;s more how I&#39;ve started thinking <br/>
about unschooling. Not as a type of homeschooler or as the anti-school <br/>
but just as a liver of life. Not liver like ew LIVER, but a person who <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are different ways the same things can be grouped and regrouped.<br/>
<br/>
Legally and linguistically they&#39;re related.<br/>
<br/>
Philosophically, school and structured homeschooling are the same, and <br/>
unschooling and attachment parenting are the same.<br/>
<br/>
But parenting doesn&#39;t have 12 or so years of legal requirements that some <br/>
people opt out of by exemption/exception.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times when people have talked to me about &quot;we&#39;re all in this <br/>
together&quot; or tried to tell me in short summary why people homeschool, I have used a <br/>
visual model (works best at restaurants or tables at home) where I put something <br/>
big in the middle, and set something off to one side of it and say <br/>
&quot;Structured homeschoolers think the school is too lax, exposes kids to too much, doesn&#39;t <br/>
control them well enough.&quot;   And I set some matching thing on the far other <br/>
side of the school thing and say &quot;Some people homeschool because they think the <br/>
schools are too rigid, don&#39;t expose kids to much, and controls them too much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If school didn&#39;t exist, or if compulsory attendance were abolished as a law <br/>
or concept, I would not say &quot;I unschool.&quot;  I would say &quot;my kids don&#39;t go to <br/>
school.&quot;<br/>

That is what an unschooler does in my opinion. That&#39;s what we are doing <br/>
now, following our interests, or rather her interests. I follow my <br/>
interests when she&#39;s sleeping, which seems like never sometimes. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not what everyone with a toddler is doing, believe me. They are <br/>
doing what they think they are &quot;supposed&quot; to do, whether they are aiming <br/>
for a certain preschool or even if they aren&#39;t planning to do preschool <br/>
or school at all.<br/>
<br/>
Some of them are imposing a ridiculous amount of structure on children <br/>
younger than mine. They are on a &quot;track&quot; whether it&#39;s to have a <br/>
homeschooled spelling champ or to get into THE preschool in their area, <br/>
they are pressuring and testing their kids already.<br/>
<br/>
Others are doing nothing at all, and I mean NOTHING other than feed, <br/>
clothe, and provide shelter. That is not unschooling. I do not want to <br/>
be lumped in with them just because we have children that are the same <br/>
age and told that the only difference between us is that their children <br/>
will eventually go to kindergarten and mine won&#39;t.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think you are aware of the concerns of unschooled parents of <br/>
&gt; kids that age, but you&#39;ll probably pick up a pretty good picture as you <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never claimed to be aware of ANY concerns of the parent of a 5 year <br/>
old, unschooled or not. I have never yet been the mother of a 5 year <br/>
old, so I can&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t speak about how it would be. But I have <br/>
been, and continue to be, an unschooler, and proud of it, man.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341743983">HOMESCHOOL:<br/>
Homeschool (all one word), and it&#39;s derivatives (-ed, -ing, -s, <br/>
etc.) does indeed have a definition.  HSLDA defined it for us, <br/>
and &quot;endorsed&quot; this spelling as the one they will use within the <br/>
organization. Spelling it this way is to signify that you are a <br/>
parent that is doing school at home for religious related reasons <br/>
(preserving a religion, separatism from the secular world, or <br/>
separatism from school policy or curriculum choices).  <br/>
<br/>
Many HSLDA members, people they lobby to, and the general public <br/>
they encountered, were using different terms to describe learning at <br/>
home.  So HSLDA chose to go with &quot;homeschool&quot; universally.  There <br/>
are implications, mostly hypothetical now, but remember, in a less <br/>
free society, the group closest to the power will have the say in <br/>
the term, and thus who might be eligible to be under <br/>
the &quot;homeschooling&quot; umbrella. <br/>
<br/>
HOME SCHOOL or HOME-SCHOOL (notice it&#39;s all not one word):<br/>
Bear with my scattered thoughts here...HOME SCHOOL with a space is <br/>
gramatically correct.  A hyphen would not be technically, but if <br/>
someone here or there in the home ed world could define home school <br/>
with a hyphen and make it a popularized term.  <br/>
<br/>
Why do I care?  Since HSLDA definded homeschool, I guess the rest of <br/>
the non-ps&#39;ers  thar are not in school for reasons other than <br/>
religious do not fit into that term.  For now, the spelling is a <br/>
seemingly small technicality and spelling it all different ways goes <br/>
on because it hasn&#39;t caught on in many groups or the media.  I&#39;ve <br/>
wasted a fair amount of needless time (?) on a lot of what if, <br/>
futuristic, hypothetical questions that ponder where would we be, as <br/>
home-schoolers if the term homeschooling was somehow made the only <br/>
way to define school or learning away from brick and mortar (or <br/>
cyberschool) school.  Onto...<br/>
<br/>
SUB-CATEGORIES:<br/>
The terms eclectic schooling, classical schooling, cyberschooling, <br/>
CM, WTM, Ambelside, Waldorf, and so on, AND, unschooling could be <br/>
considered sub categories of both homeschooling and home schooling.  <br/>
True unschooling would be rare for the homeschooler, but it could <br/>
happen.  <br/>
<br/>
BACK TO UNSCHOOLING:<br/>
I think it&#39;s high time that there be three categories:  <br/>
homeschooling, home-schooling, and unschooling.  Since homeschooling <br/>
has been defined for us by HSLDA, it&#39;s up to others to define the <br/>
differences between home school and unschool in the public/political <br/>
forum.  Sort of a we can do what they can do &quot;thang&quot;.  Pam?  <br/>
Sandra?  Robin?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>STARTING TO UNSCHOOL:<br/>
Someone made the term unschooling stick with me somewhere here, or <br/>
on the big board.  I printed out part of the post, but I can&#39;t <br/>
credit the proper person - I&#39;m sorry!  What made total sense to me <br/>
was that true unschoolers really &quot;get&quot; the following terms (I&#39;m <br/>
going to quote the poster here):  <br/>
<br/>
autonomous living, <br/>
non-coercive parenting, <br/>
mutually agreed upon solutions, and <br/>
consensual living*<br/>
<br/>
I agree with poster GoldStandard, that you need to walk the walk <br/>
with an unschooler, home schooler or what ever, to talk the talk   <br/>
Until that time (somewhere psychologically around the 5- to 7- <br/>
mental schema shift is the point I think previous posters were <br/>
trying to convey the mental &quot;switch&quot; outward to learning), parents <br/>
with younger children may benefit more from boards dealing with the <br/>
above as well as attachment parenting rather than primarily here?  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
*Oh, and thank you, thank you, thank you for these terms! I read who-<br/>
ever-you are&#39;s post each day and after reading up on the topics have <br/>
started implementing them with great, great success!  All those <br/>
seemingly unruly unschoolers with out passions, or those using some <br/>
curriculum, or unschool parents disciplining their child with <br/>
bribes/coercion/consequences, etc.,  just didn&#39;t jive with my <br/>
thoughts and readings about what true unschooling was. For the <br/>
longest time,  I just couldn&#39;t put the learning style and life style <br/>
together as true unschooling.  Now I know! Or at least I&#39;ve defined <br/>
it for myself... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met some wonderful parents that have married lifestyle and <br/>
unschooling, and now can tell the differences between which <br/>
unschooling families &quot;do&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t&quot;.  I hope I&#39;m making sense!</div>
