<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749304899">Hi Joanne,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What was a problem is that he continued to run away from me so that I was<br/>
&gt;unable to talk with him about how it was getting dark, it was almost<br/>
&gt;seven o&#39;clock and I needed to eat, that my ds had no idea where we<br/>
&gt;were and I didn&#39;t want him to worry).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First I&#39;d just like to say that this has become almost a non-issue for me<br/>
as Nicole has gotten older.  I do remember that when she was 5 I had<br/>
several heart thumping moments when she would run away from me and then I<br/>
couldn&#39;t see her.  Once was in a crowded unfamiliar store.  I know that she<br/>
loved (and still does) to play hiding games and running away games.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel that comfortable playing these games in groups of other kids,<br/>
but she wants to do it.  When it happened in the unfamiliar store I<br/>
explained my concern about not being able to find her (and indeed she had<br/>
gotten lost and scared a few times up to that point), and we worked out a<br/>
deal where she would tell me in advance where she was going to run away to.<br/>
It didn&#39;t seem to be a big issue that I not know, just that she got to do<br/>
it.  Kind of like how she used to talk in the back seat w/ her friends<br/>
about what to say to me as if I couldn&#39;t hear because they weren&#39;t talking<br/>
*to* me.  I expect that when she gets older (and is able to be very<br/>
discerning about safety) it will be important to be *really* hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Another tool that really helped empower her at the music festivals that we<br/>
go to is a walkie-talkie.  She loves being able to go ahead of me and still<br/>
be connected and to be using a cool gadget all at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But then he disappeared and did not answer.  He finally did show up.  I was<br/>
&gt;headed up the hill by then.  When I told him I was worried.  He just<br/>
&gt;matter of fact tells me he was fine. I consider this a safety thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been wondering, because of his matter of fact nature that you sensed,<br/>
if he is trying to be a bit more autonomous and wanting very much to know<br/>
that he can make decisions about safety.  I also remember at the 5yo point<br/>
a marked difference in how Nicole started to cross the street and inform me<br/>
of all the various car movements.  She chose to do it in a way that was<br/>
still right next to me rather than on her own, but it was clear that I was<br/>
to follow her lead for knowing when to cross the street.  I also feel that<br/>
if I hadn&#39;t honored that I might have set myself up for a power struggle.<br/>
Mind you, I wasn&#39;t going to walk in front of a car!  But I did let her<br/>
lead, knowing that I was still going to jump in if needed.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how important it is for you to know that your son is safe.  So<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that you go ahead and let him explore beyond the hill on<br/>
his own if it really isn&#39;t safe to do.  But are there other areas where he<br/>
really can explore and express his autonomy wrt to safety?  Maybe having<br/>
him lead you would be helpful?  Anyway, that&#39;s the only idea I&#39;ve had so<br/>
far.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Any suggestions to what I do when I have a need, would like to communicate<br/>
&gt;it and he just won&#39;t get close enough to me to be willing to work things<br/>
&gt;out...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, when it comes to communication I usually try to do it before and/or<br/>
after.  I&#39;ve also seen it referred to as briefing/debriefing.  In<br/>
situations where right now I have needs and the communication isn&#39;t<br/>
happening then I take a deep breath, I think about my most important need<br/>
in that moment and I put that need into the context of my being in<br/>
relationship w/ Nicole, and I hold it all in my heart.  Then, I take into<br/>
account Nicole&#39;s needs and I hold them in my heart.<br/>
<br/>
These are just the types of moments where I could easily slip back into the<br/>
old paradigm and just *make* it happen (whatever it might be, like leaving<br/>
the park or whatever).  But I&#39;d prefer not to damage my relationship.  I&#39;d<br/>
prefer not to wound my daughter&#39;s spirit, or mine for that matter.  I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed that when I do slip and I get upset I&#39;m starting to feel the wound<br/>
of it myself.  Not the guilty feeling... just that a bit of my connected<br/>
wholeness has been slighted.<br/>
<br/>
This is all another way of me saying what I often try to say, which is that<br/>
I hold the seemingly opposite needs, the paradoxical needs, together.  I<br/>
connect them.  I allow them to exist with love and as much space as they<br/>
need.  To use your park story as an example... I don&#39;t drop my need to<br/>
leave, but I don&#39;t *insist* that it happen right now.  At the same time I<br/>
open up to my dd&#39;s need which she is choosing to manifest by running away.<br/>
I allow that to be... to exist with love.  That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ll be<br/>
staying at the park, but it does mean it has some space.  All together, I<br/>
soften and I become more present while still holding on to the issues that<br/>
are imposing themselves from the future.  I think when I make that<br/>
physical, mental, and emotional shift Nicole notices it and she can make<br/>
the shift very quickly thereafter.  In a way, it&#39;s about setting time aside<br/>
for a little while...<br/>
<br/>
Others have suggested that you make a game out of it, chase him.  I know<br/>
you can&#39;t run after your son.  But how about if you make the game w/ your<br/>
words.  Take the idea that yes, you&#39;d like to go and yes, he&#39;d like to stay<br/>
into a word game, chasing him with your words.  Be the sports commentator,<br/>
watching his every move away from you, no closer, no further, off to the<br/>
left, ooo close to that tree...  Maybe even turn it into a chase/commenting<br/>
game w/ the car being the goal.  Allow both realities to exist, that&#39;s the<br/>
trick and the key.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101962465">Hi Barbara,  I continue to be delighted with the way people take the time to reach out.  Explaining things to new people (who really have so much to learn) can take a bit of time.  Thank you for that gift.  I think you may have provided me some insight. .  He feels ready.  Now I am just the one who needs to let go with love.  Briefing and debriefing is so foreign to me.  I am used to talking about it as it comes up.  As I read I quickly reflect back and realize that it never worked that way.  Why did I not stop sooner and try something else?  I think I was stuck in the way that was familiar.  But now I want to stretch to find the way that allows me to remain the most connected :)  Thanks again, Joanne<br/>
