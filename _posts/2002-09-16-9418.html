<div id="ygrps-yiv-497374570">I just got off the phone with my mom a little while<br/>
ago.  I guess I need to vent a little. Ok, a lot!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m usually good at avoiding any topic of controversy<br/>
with my mom, like religion, homeschooling, basically<br/>
any important topics, and keep it superficial, yeah,<br/>
I&#39;m fine, the kids are fine, it&#39;s hot today....  So<br/>
she asked how homeschooling was going, and I said<br/>
&quot;fine&quot;.  Great, you say.  But then she asked what we<br/>
were studying.  My response...&quot;uh...&quot; I know, I know,<br/>
in hindsight, I should have come up with something,<br/>
maybe &quot;ancient civilizations&quot; or something at least<br/>
interesting.  But instead I confessed that we weren&#39;t<br/>
really doing lessons.  (It has been easy to avoid<br/>
specifically outlining our unschooling philosophy<br/>
since we live in AZ & they live in AL.)  So we had a<br/>
long conversation.  Or maybe I should say, she had<br/>
lots of concerns & worries & told me all the things I<br/>
&quot;should&quot; be doing with Quentin (he&#39;s 6).  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, I better back up a bit.  This really started<br/>
because I made a comment about us being behind a guy<br/>
this morning on our way to church & he had TX license<br/>
plates & a Texas A&M sticker on his car.  (Dh & I both<br/>
graduated from Tx A&M).  Mom followed that with the<br/>
suggestion that we find or start an alumni group here<br/>
(in Tucson).  Hah!  As if that would be something we&#39;d<br/>
be interested in.  So I told her that.  And she said<br/>
&quot;Well, aren&#39;t your kids going to go to college?&quot;  I<br/>
replied &quot;maybe, if they want to&quot;.  &quot;Well&quot;, she says,<br/>
&quot;if we were in an alumni group then our kids might<br/>
want to go to the same college we went to.&quot; (!) &quot;why<br/>
would we want them to do that?&quot;, I think as a nice<br/>
response now, an hour later...(note: she & my dad are<br/>
active in their UF alumni group in Alabama, mostly,<br/>
maybe exclusively for the football watching parties!)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, mom has a masters in education & is a former<br/>
teacher (mostly first grade).  She has no clue what we<br/>
are doing, well, now she does, but she has no<br/>
understanding about WHY.  I tried to explain, but she,<br/>
of course, thinks we should have a curriculum & doing<br/>
lessons & on & on.  So I addressed all the concerns<br/>
she came up with & then she said &quot; well, what if<br/>
something happened to you & chris?&quot;  I interpret this<br/>
to mean, what if we die tomorrow?  So I reply &quot;well, I<br/>
imagine someone would end up putting them in school.&quot; <br/>
Mom:  &quot;well, that would be so HARD on them if they&#39;ve<br/>
been homeschooled and have never done lessons before&quot;<br/>
or something to that effect.  <br/>
<br/>
So the conversation continues... about &quot;don&#39;t we have<br/>
to do testing?&quot; NO.  &quot;doesn&#39;t the state require every<br/>
kid to be in school?&quot;  YES.  &quot;So if Child Protective<br/>
Services investigates and finds out your kids are just<br/>
playing games and not doing school...?&quot;  MOM!  CPS is<br/>
not going to take my kids away just to put them in<br/>
school!   I couldn&#39;t believe she said that! <br/>
I still can&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, rant over...<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718720858">heather, i had a very similar conversation with my parents.  it was a <br/>
bit upsetting.  i thought that they agreed with unschooling--after all, <br/>
i first read holt from their bookshelves!  when i was in high school.<br/>
<br/>
my parents are also former teachers/educators.  my mom taught special <br/>
ed, and we had a private school for years. my dad taught for years, and <br/>
t hen became a counselor.  they are both retired now.  <br/>
<br/>
the only difference in the conversation between your mom and yourself, <br/>
and my parents and me was that my parents also went into how the schools <br/>
will never be the same and that it is partly the fault of homeschoolers. <br/>
 my mom said that kids like lexie make the schools look good, because <br/>
she would test well.  like that is a reason to put her in school.  yes, <br/>
she is like me, she would love those silly standerdized testing, <br/>
although they would be a bit long for her, and she would test well, but <br/>
still.... besides the fact that us homeschoolers are going to be the <br/>
downfall of public schools (something i truly do not understand, i <br/>
almost want to ask them to tell me more, but i really don&#39;t want to go <br/>
there) we are also doing a bad thing by not doing school lessons with <br/>
lexie.  i know they live in new mexico and we live in california so they <br/>
dont&#39; see lexie a lot, but man, i really thought they would be ok with <br/>
unschooling, at least for a few more years.  <br/>
<br/>
i admit that i have thought a few times that i am lucky that lexie is <br/>
advanced for her age.  my sister&#39;s youngest son did not really read at <br/>
all until recently, and even then he is only reading &#39;on grade level&#39;. <br/>
 my parents were very worried about him--he&#39;s just one year older than <br/>
Lexie, he just turned 8!  i know that they haven&#39;t said things because <br/>
lexie is obviously very bright and learning--but they said she needs to <br/>
learn to be bored, to do things that are boring.  how will she suceed in <br/>
college if she isn&#39;t bored now.  i really don&#39;t get it.  <br/>
<br/>
i mean, a short brag here, but lexie is doing so well.  she is counting <br/>
money.  no worksheets, no fake money, she just finds money and then <br/>
counts it.  she and i had a neat conversation about prime numbers.  i <br/>
was in high school before i understood about prime numbers, but she gets <br/>
it, at 7!  we recently raised butterflies and i was amazed at her <br/>
knowledge of the lifespan of butterflies--she got out all our <br/>
dictionaries and world books and animal books and was mad because none <br/>
of them had a picture of the painted lady butterfly.  but she read about <br/>
butterflies and read to janene, etc.  it was very cool to watch. (one of <br/>
the butterflies is deformed.  so sad.  the wing didn&#39;t open up all the <br/>
way and the other wing had holes in it.  the girls decided to keep it in <br/>
the net cage (which is pretty big) until it dies, 2-4 weeks.  so we buy <br/>
fresh flowers and give it cut oranges and i try not to cry a bit when i <br/>
walk by and see this deformed little guy.  how sad.  not really the <br/>
lesson i had in mind when i ordered the butterflies!)  i love watching <br/>
lexie learn and grow and become.  janene too.  today she and lexie and <br/>
daddy made cookies and when janene came up i asked her how many cookies <br/>
she ate.  she said i ate 4 first and then two more.  i said and how many <br/>
is that!  she laughed and held up four fingers and then made my hand <br/>
hold up two fingers and counted them all.  anyway... this is turning <br/>
into a rant now too.  <br/>
<br/>
i like to think that it&#39;ll be a bit like breastfeeding.  when lexie was <br/>
about 6 months my dad found out that i planned to nurse her until she <br/>
self weaned and that it could be years.  (i didn&#39;t know it would be <br/>
almost 6 years, i figured 3 at that time, but that was way too long for <br/>
my dad).  my dad said that as a counselor all the kids he had been <br/>
around who had nursed that long had seperation issues, major problems <br/>
with leaving mom, etc.  he was truly upset that i was choosing to do <br/>
something he felt would be harmful to his granddaughter.  about a year <br/>
later he admitted that he was wrong.  but i was lucky.  lexie is an <br/>
extrovert.  nursing had little to do with her inate personality.  yes, i <br/>
believe that our parenting helped her to be secure but it wasn&#39;t just <br/>
that.  so i guess i am just hoping that in a few years my parents will <br/>
see that lexie can truly learn in this way, and that she doesn&#39;t need to <br/>
be bored to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
joylyn who will get a keyboard tomorrow--water and 4 year olds and <br/>
keyboards don&#39;t mix.  no shift key<br/>

Are there things you&#39;d like to have, like a globe?  Some attribute blocks?  <br/>
Cuisenaire rods? A toy cash register? a wall map?  Chalk and a chalk board? A <br/>
relief map of Arizona?    I&#39;d ask the first-grade-teacher mom if she had any <br/>
lying around, or knew where to get some.  She might have connections with a <br/>
school still or might really enjoy going to an educational supply store and <br/>
buying you some &quot;educational supplies.&quot;  And the kids could play with those <br/>
while she was there and she would be THRILLED.<br/>
<br/>
A geoboard and some colored rubber bands.<br/>
<br/>
Puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
I would try to do an aikido maneuver so that her desire to see school-style <br/>
learning could be turned to your advantage (and hers) during the visit.<br/>

You could say &quot;John Holt&#39;s stuff I read on YOUR bookshelf.  The only reason <br/>

Sometimes its difficult to get families to understand. When I took <br/>
my kids out of school my mother-in-law (high school physics <br/>
teacher, married to a university lecturer and obsessed with maths <br/>
and physics) assumed I was doing it so I could &#39;hot-house&#39; the <br/>
children.<br/>
H was labelled &#39;gifted&#39; at school as her maths was 6 years ahead of <br/>
her classmates so MIL assumed we&#39;d be ploughing ahead with a <br/>
maths and physics curriculum with an eye to Oxford or Cambridge <br/>
in the future. Man, was she disappointed!<br/>
While we were still in the UK she would try and drop little hints <br/>
about hours per day that should be spent on maths. Fortunately <br/>
the hints were little cos she knows I don&#39;t like her much and that <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t be welcome in our house again if she annoyed me. <br/>
She would then feed my husbands fears about how the children <br/>
weren&#39;t learning, how would they get into a good university, how <br/>
there were only narrow windows in time where certain things could <br/>
be learned, how they would end up like some of the &#39;morons&#39; she <br/>
taught, not even going to university. Sigh.<br/>
Now we are 4000 miles away she sends workbooks to the kids <br/>
through the mail, obviously expecting them to be thrilled. My <br/>
daughetr is 10, the work-books are nearly always aimed at 16-18 <br/>
yo&#39;s. The boys get nothing cos they are boys and she doesn&#39;t like <br/>
them.<br/>

downfall of public schools (something i truly do not understand, i <br/>
almost want to ask them to tell me more, but i really don&#39;t want to go <br/>

<br/>
The simplest idea is that fewer students choosing public school means<br/>
fewer jobs for public school teachers.  And if homeschooling yields<br/>
better &quot;results&quot;, either in test scores or in personal happiness, then<br/>
more and more people are going to homeschoool.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that I think will happen is that homeschooling will<br/>
prove that school doesn&#39;t work.  If all the kids whose parents read to<br/>
them a lot took them out of school, then I think test scores would drop.<br/>
 And I think all the worksheets and remedial reading programs and longer<br/>
school years wouldn&#39;t raise the test scores back up again.  I believe<br/>
that natural learning in a relaxed and undistracting environment works<br/>
better than anything in the classroom.  And I believe that in reading 4<br/>
Harry Potter books twice to my son this summer I &quot;developed his<br/>
vocabulary&quot; (pardon me) more than my husband did in teaching 150<br/>
&quot;scripted reading lessons&quot; to his middle school students.  Believe me,<br/>
while I was reading Harry Potter to my son, I was wishing I could read<br/>
it to a much larger swarm of kids.  (The district mandates the scripted<br/>
reading program, and this kind of approach has been gaining in<br/>
popularity in California.)<br/>
<br/>
I think I lost track of my point in all the details. But, I believe if<br/>
schooly learning is expanded into the preschool years and into<br/>
additional homework at night and summer school attendance, then kids<br/>
will actually learn LESS.  A lot of the &quot;progress&quot; that kids show in<br/>
&quot;language arts&quot; during the K12 years is actually learned outside of<br/>
school.  If enough involved parents take their kids out of school, it<br/>
may be revealed that school learning methods are terribly ineffective.  <br/>
(Pssst! The emperor isn&#39;t wearing any clothes.  Pass it on.)<br/>

I told her not to worry because IF that happened, then we would just move in with her so I could work nights and still keep the kids home!  She didn&#39;t say much more after that......:)<br/>

&lt;&lt; To extend this argument to its absurd conclusion: you shouldn&#39;t even be<br/>
affectionate to your kids in case you die and the future foster parents<br/>
aren&#39;t as affectionate.  Then your kids won&#39;t know what they are<br/>
missing.  ::: shudder ::: &gt;&gt;<br/>

That probably isn&#39;t too far from what some people HAVE thought in the past.<br/>

&lt;&lt; A lot of the &quot;progress&quot; that kids show in<br/>
&quot;language arts&quot; during the K12 years is actually learned outside of<br/>
school.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AND what kids learn about science and history!  Much of it comes from <br/>
hobbies, movies, reading for fun, travel...</div>

&lt;&lt; The simplest idea is that fewer students choosing public school means<br/>
 fewer jobs for public school teachers.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Boy, here in the Houston area there are billboards along the freeway <br/>
encouraging people to become public school teachers!  (Picture of a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599575329">This is the conversation my mother is itching to have with me but won&#39;t.<br/>
She tries to get my relatives on her side (Don&#39;t you think those kids should<br/>
be in school?)  I decided to confront her directly last week.....she denied<br/>
everything and said it wasn&#39;t her business.  I told her she could ask me<br/>
anything about what we&#39;re doing, to help her understand, yada yada.  She<br/>
said she had no concerns.  At least your mother was honest with you!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, dd IS in school right now - our local Sudbury School (she needs LOTS<br/>
of people ALL the time to interact with and our HS group, families, and kid<br/>
playdates/neighborhood kids wasn&#39;t cutting it for her.)  But since they&#39;re<br/>
not making her do academics, it doesn&#39;t count (nor does the presence of 2<br/>
certified teachers with more than 20 years of PS experience mollify her -<br/>
not that I really care *g*).<br/>
<br/>
DS is chugging along just fine unschooling at home (or rather the office :)<br/>
