<br/>
I was looking at the When Humor Isn&#39;t Funny page on your site   <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/notfunny)">http://sandradodd.com/notfunny)</a> and my youngest dd came up and looked <br/>
over my shoulder and saw the picture there (bird holding a sign which <br/>
says Raising Children is like being pecked to death by a Chicken), she <br/>
read it, and said, &quot;Uh!&quot;, very offended.  I asked her if it was <br/>
insulting to her, and she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  Then she put her arms around my <br/>
neck, sat down on my lap and started giving me little kisses on my <br/>
neck.  I laughed and asked if she was pecking me to death...and yes, <br/>
she was. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE unschooling!<br/>
