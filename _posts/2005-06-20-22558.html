<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541044109">Hello all - first posting<br/>
Have been researching home education for 6/8 months now and still<br/>
undecided/confident enough to make the leap...<br/>
<br/>
My 7.5yr old wonderful son is in primary 2 at our local village school and<br/>
pretty happy.  Before enrolling him I had no idea that we had the choice of<br/>
whether or not to send him - we probably wouldn&#39;t have.  As it was we<br/>
deferred his starting school (his birthday is end of January so we enrolled<br/>
him at 5.7yrs) and at the time I found this decision hard - with more<br/>
knowledge I would very much prefer our kids to start school (if doing so)<br/>
aged 7 or 8. <br/>
<br/>
Now I am very torn between wanting him to continue as a confident,<br/>
sensitive, happy person and my increasing worry that the whole &#39;schooling&#39;<br/>
process could turn him into a more insecure, hesitant person whose life is<br/>
directed by pleasing others!<br/>
<br/>
I feel closer to him, more connected, when we have spent the entire day<br/>
together.  When we walk home from school, I hate the fact that I have to<br/>
question what he did and who he spent time with.  There are many of the<br/>
teaching practices that I strongly disagree with and can totally understand<br/>
why and how they would stunt enthusiasm and curb curiosity.  We  have a 2<br/>
year old daughter (the age gap was deliberate - we wanted our second child<br/>
to have the same one-to-one time that Cal obviously benefited from) and I<br/>
wonder about the balance of the pros and cons when dealing with the<br/>
practicalities of this age range.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s in a class of 20 and I know most of the children.  The teachers aren&#39;t<br/>
fantastic but they&#39;re not terrible either.  He&#39;s very popular and bright but<br/>
he also says he misses me and still obviously needs the hugs and kisses and<br/>
quiet time of home.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, I flux between &quot;letting it lie&quot; and &quot;we should all be<br/>
together&quot;.  A year ago I wouldn&#39;t be agonising over this, he would be part<br/>
of the crowd and fitting in fine  - is ignorance bliss?<br/>
  <br/>
Also -  how much of our own life experience injuries do we inflict on our<br/>
children?  <br/>
<br/>
Any guidance welcomed.<br/>
Jan<br/>

Ps we live in Scotland where the home-schooling concept has yet to blossom.<br/>

As little as you can.  When I had children, I re-examined all my  childhood <br/>
memories in their great light.<br/>
 <br/>
I wrote this about my sister years back and it might help you:<br/>

 <br/>
If you let your son choose whether to return, or let him know he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have to go if he doesn&#39;t want to, he will be the most powerful boy in his school  <br/>
at that very instant.  And after that if he goes to school, he will be the  <br/>
only one there (probably) who is there by his very own choice.  That will  make <br/>
things different for him, inside and out.<br/>
