<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112338904">In reading over responses on various issues, I&#39;m confused about how to <br/>
help a child understand both simple politeness as well as more refined <br/>
etiquette practices for our culture.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I&#39;ve read several times where a parent will talk about <br/>
not forcing a child to share or say &quot;Thank You&quot;. Some parents will say <br/>
&quot;Thank You&quot; themselves for the child, or toys that the child might <br/>
hold dear should be set aside before a play date, but I&#39;m wondering <br/>
what other options people use?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;ve now seen two people use the word &quot;coach&quot; when <br/>
describing how they helped their child(ren) respond politely in a <br/>
given situation.<br/>
<br/>
So are there times when I *should* tell my child to share, or do I <br/>
step in and find other solutions? <br/>
<br/>
I supposed this would also depend on age...my 6 year old understands <br/>
the idea of sharing, as does my 4 year old. But with both of them I <br/>
always did the &quot;You need to share. In a few minutes, let them have a <br/>
turn...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
With my twins I find it especially difficult just between them as they <br/>
are both the same age (17 mo.) and often want the same thing of <br/>
course. But if one takes the toy from the other, I&#39;m not sure that me <br/>
taking the toy back and returning it to the original child is modeling <br/>
the right idea, either.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in light of reinforcing positive behavior, I&#39;ve noticed that <br/>
unschoolers tend to put down the idea of saying things like, &quot;good <br/>
boy&quot; or &quot;good job&quot; to their toddlers or children. Or at least that&#39;s <br/>
the impression I get. I don&#39;t try to do this in a childish or <br/>
manipulative &quot;do what makes mommy happy&quot; sort of way, but in a way <br/>
that I&#39;m hoping makes the child feel proud in an accomplishment of <br/>
theirs. Like when one of the babies first put a piece of garbage in <br/>
the trash can on their own without me even explaining what trash was, <br/>
I said, &quot;Good job, Logan!&quot; And he grinned really big because he knew <br/>
he had picked up on something that &quot;big people&quot; do that he now did.<br/>
<br/>
Is that kind of acknowledgment petty or simply what I meant it to be - <br/>
an affirmation that he figured something out?<br/>

<br/>
I told my kids to share lots of times.<br/>
<br/>
More often I was persuasive and made suggestions that would help them  <br/>
choose to share and feel good about it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I supposed this would also depend on age...my 6 year old  <br/>

of them I always did the &quot;You need to share. In a few minutes, let  <br/>
them have a turn...&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the toy and situation, sometimes I just said &quot;When he&#39;s  <br/>
done, you can play with it if you still want to,&quot; and that worked  <br/>
pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But if one takes the toy from the other, I&#39;m not sure that me  <br/>
taking the toy back and returning it to the original child is  <br/>
modeling the right idea, either.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the method of the taking, and the attitude of the one  <br/>
who had it first, I might return it to the original child.  But one  <br/>
of the best ways to get a kid to drop a toy (or an adult, for that  <br/>
matter) is to offer something interesting in its place.  If they  <br/>
choose another more exciting thing, cool.  (Either kid.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, in light of reinforcing positive behavior, I&#39;ve noticed that<br/>
<br/>
unschoolers tend to put down the idea of saying things like, &quot;good<br/>
boy&quot; or &quot;good job&quot; to their toddlers or children. Or at least that&#39;s<br/>
the impression I get. I don&#39;t try to do this in a childish or<br/>
manipulative &quot;do what makes mommy happy&quot; sort of way, but in a way<br/>

<br/>
-=-Is that kind of acknowledgment petty or simply what I meant it to  <br/>

an affirmation that he figured something out?-=-<br/>
<br/>
To toddlers, &quot;Good&quot; is often fun for them to hear.  Some people avoid  <br/>
it because it&#39;s the opposite of &quot;bad&quot; and they don&#39;t want to set up  <br/>
that dichotomy, I think.  Some people combine it with ideas of  <br/>
intrinsic motivation and say kids should put things in the trash  <br/>
because of logical larger reasons, but babies don&#39;t have logical  <br/>
larger reasons.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to communicate approval, relief, joy, and other  <br/>
positive feedback.  What I use in my own life to gauge whether I&#39;m  <br/>
being condescending to my kids (or just talking too much) is to think  <br/>
whether I would say it to an adult friend or to my husband.<br/>
<br/>
The other day Holly and I left the mall and I walked right through  <br/>
the door without touching it, without looking back, and then I  <br/>
noticed Holly had stopped and held it open for an older man and two  <br/>
older women.  Yikes!  I hadn&#39;t even noticed they were there.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know if I started to drop the door right in their faces or what, and  <br/>
I was glad Holly had noticed and held the door.  They were nice to  <br/>
her and thanked her, and when we were alone, I said I was glad she  <br/>
had seen them and held the door.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know that from an unschooling perspective, what bugs me is the <br/>
cookie-cutter praise, &quot;Good job!&quot; said in that certain tone of voice, used <br/>
over and over again. After a while, it loses its meaning and value. I don&#39;t <br/>
think unschoolers are against acknowledging wonderful things their children <br/>
do; I think the issue is offering a fake &quot;Good job!&quot; vs. being really <br/>
authentic and true to yourself and your children when expressing to them how <br/>
much you truly like what they did. It sounds like you actually have a handle <br/>
on the main idea, but I&#39;ll elaborate anyways:<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3-year-old who loves to throw things in the trash and close any <br/>
open drawer/cabinet he sees. When I&#39;m in the vicinity and he does that, I&#39;ll <br/>
often say, &quot;Thanks, Jaiden!&quot; or &quot;That was nice of you to throw that away for <br/>
me - thanks, I appreciate it.&quot; He has been closing drawers and tossing trash <br/>
for months now, and I can see that he&#39;s happy every time he closes a <br/>
drawer - happy for *himself* and the situation; he doesn&#39;t look up at me <br/>
after closing a drawer and ask for approval or praise with that &quot;look&quot; of <br/>
&quot;Did I do a &#39;good job&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where the distinction, I think, of societal praise vs. unschooling <br/>
praise comes in to play. We are authentically acknowleding what we <br/>
appreciate in their behavior; we aren&#39;t just giving them an A+ for putting <br/>
trash in the trash can.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to add, though, that there are times when a small deed like this <br/>
seeks to be acknowledged with a huge &quot;YAY!&quot; or even a &quot;Way to go, bud!!! <br/>
Good job!,&quot; in my opinion. But in such times, it&#39;s still very authentic. <br/>
Usually, the kiddo is waaaaay excited about the trash, and his newly found <br/>
success, and you just want to reflect that big energy back to him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992939361">Re: twins and good jobbing--<br/>
<br/>
I have twins, too (they just turned three) and we handled the sharing issue a couple of <br/>
different ways--<br/>
<br/>
1. If it was a toy that was in high demand, we just had two of them.<br/>
2. Honestly, I let them work it out. It worked for us, but usually the takee would just go <br/>
find something else, and if I got involved I created a problem where there wasn&#39;t one.<br/>
<br/>
The good jobbing--in that instance, if he&#39;d done something I&#39;d asked of him, I&#39;d just say <br/>
&quot;Thank you.&quot; If I asked someone else to throw something in the trash, or hand me <br/>
something, that&#39;s what I&#39;d say, not &quot;good job.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you should make a child share when they really don&#39;t <br/>
want to, but they can learn to want to share.  We talk about why we <br/>
share, how we feel when we share or don&#39;t share, and how the other <br/>
person feels about it.  We also talk about our options.  You can give <br/>
the toy to the other person, play together, or politely let them know <br/>
that you are going to play with it and they can have it when your <br/>
done.  I also let the children choose for themselves when they are <br/>
going to be done.  If you were reading messages on the computer and <br/>
your spouse said &quot;okay, you only get 5 minutes, then it&#39;s someone <br/>
elses turn&quot; you wouldn&#39;t be very happy and you would feel rushed, so <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t enjoy it.  <br/>
I also think it is important to talk to children about it before they <br/>
are at play dates with other kids, so they already know.  There is a <br/>
game I play with my preschoolers where we build a block circular wall <br/>
and put stuffed animals in the middle.  The object of the game is to <br/>
rescue the &quot;friends&quot; from the middle.  We go around the group and <br/>
each one says a nice thing you can do for a friend(say please, thank <br/>
you, share, let them play with you, don&#39;t hit, etc.)when you say <br/>
something nice you can take one block.  Once all the blocks are down <br/>
you can rescue the stuffed animal friends.  the kids love playing it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really liked this response.  I think that when a parent is trying to move beyond &quot;making <br/>
my child do ...&quot; and you are looking for something new, you can choose to not make them <br/>
do something, but then you might find yourself in the realm of &quot;unparenting.&quot;  Talking <br/>
with our kids, helping them to move beyond a &quot;no&quot; into a softer place of considering the <br/>
feelings of others, and some of their own more subtle feelings of happiness when they can <br/>
help make another person happy--this is a place of truer empowerment and connection.<br/>
<br/>
I consider that my kids often have many answers inside of them-sometimes a no is a no, <br/>
but often a no changes when the information they are considering changes.  And every so <br/>
often, if they are stuck in place that seems pretty clearly off base to me, I give them a <br/>
nudge over to a different track.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I need a nudge over to a different track, and sometimes they are the ones to <br/>
give it to me.  It goes both ways--sometimes we are just flat out wrong--and it&#39;s not just <br/>
children that are wrong!  In the end, I always appreciate that someone I love has gone out-<br/>
on-a-limb with me to point out that it&#39;s me that needs to shift, not the world.  LOL<br/>

understanding that turns with a toy didn&#39;t need to be cut short, but that the child with the <br/>
toy would say, &quot;You can have it when I&#39;m done.&quot;  The second child would feel heard and <br/>
that they were the next in line.  It worked almost all of the time.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All of the current pop-child rearing info is on rewards and behavior modification.  This can <br/>
too easily turn from a communication between two people to manipulation.  If you think <br/>
that a child needs to hear that they did &quot;good&quot; then you might be missing some larger <br/>
issues of dignity and self-knowledge.  (Note that I said &quot;might&quot;)  A child knows he did <br/>
good, because his/her actions help create more peace, cleanliness, order, etc. etc.    <br/>
<br/>
There is power in not acknowledging actions that are part of everyday life, just as there <br/>
can be power in acknowledging them.  I&#39;ve been one of those parents who automatically <br/>
said &quot;good&quot; every time my kids did something desirable so that they would repeat the <br/>
action.  Blech!  Since I&#39;ve stopped that (long ago now) I see how powerful it can be for <br/>
them to just be a part of a working system.  In some ways, my commentary pointed out <br/>
that they weren&#39;t part of the family in some way.  I don&#39;t comment every time my hubby <br/>
takes out the garbage, but every so often I do, if it was especially full and it really makes <br/>
my life easier for it to be emptied, and then he does, for instance.<br/>

goodness will emerge in a nurturing environment.<br/>
<br/>
I know that positive reinforcement works with my dogs and horses.  Maybe &quot;thank you&quot; is <br/>
more appropriate with people?<br/>

Keith and I always said please and thanks a lot, before we had kids,  <br/>

please pass the box, and then say thanks.  If I  need a drink of  <br/>
water, I&#39;ll say please and thanks.  Saying it about such small things  <br/>
makes it pretty automatic to say it about bigger things.  Holly drove  <br/>
yesterday.  I thanked her.  I don&#39;t love to drive for fun.   Brett  <br/>

computer character on an educational video game.  &quot;FanTAStic!&quot; every  <br/>
time the kid clicks the right answer or something.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t just recite &quot;thank you&quot; in a quoty kind of  way.  It&#39;s  <br/>
really a thank you.  It will be &quot;I&#39;m glad you did that because I  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to put my shoes back on&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re so nice to take the  <br/>
snow off the car for me!&quot; or &quot;Thanks for making this  <br/>
food!&quot;  (Thanking cooks or people who bring us sandwiches is big here.)<br/>
