Another sex-education book volume in library at center of storm<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
CONROE - A second children&#39;s sex-education book is caught in a book-banning <br/>
battle that is expected to change the Montgomery County library system&#39;s <br/>
selection process.<br/>
A crowd of about 200 people spilled into the hallways at Commissioners <br/>
Court on Monday to hear the debate on a proposed ban on It&#39;s Perfectly <br/>
Normal, by Robie H. Harris.  Critics of the book asked that a second book <br/>
by Harris, It&#39;s So Amazing, which addresses sex education for younger <br/>
children, also be removed because of what they called its pro-homosexual <br/>
stance.<br/>
County Judge Alan B. Sadler said he had received hundreds, and perhaps <br/>
thousands, of comments from residents and the sentiment appears to be about <br/>
evenly split on the issue.<br/>
&quot;It frankly does not sway my feelings on wanting more control on what is on <br/>
the shelves that is accessible to children in Montgomery County,&quot; Sadler said.<br/>
&quot;We have to draw a line in the sand,&quot; said Jim German, a Republican <br/>
precinct chairman. &quot;We are fed up with the liberals shoving immoral views <br/>
down our throats.&quot;<br/>
After complaints about It&#39;s Perfectly Normal were raised two weeks ago, the <br/>
county referred the book to a library review panel, which will make a <br/>
recommendation to Library Director Jerilynn Williams. The formal complaint <br/>
beginning the process was delivered to Williams during Monday&#39;s court session.<br/>
It&#39;s So Amazing is not on the list of popular books facing bans in <br/>
libraries throughout the county, although It&#39;s Perfectly Normal ranks as <br/>
the 13th-most-challenged book since 1990, said to Beverley Becker, <br/>
assistant director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American <br/>
Library Association.<br/>
&quot;From our perspective, the notion of a library is to protect access to <br/>
books,&quot; Becker said, adding that the organization believes individual <br/>
families should decide which books are appropriate.<br/>
Most of the speakers, many of them members of the Republican Leadership <br/>
Council, the Christian Coalition of Montgomery County and area Christian <br/>
churches, called for Williams to be fired, for the creation of a citizen <br/>
review panel and for the county&#39;s withdrawal from the American Library <br/>
Association.<br/>
Some even attacked the county&#39;s $10 million bond proposal, scheduled for a <br/>
November election, to build three libraries. They said the money would help <br/>
to purchase unwanted books.<br/>
&quot;It shows a gross lack of good judgment and accountability,&quot; said the Rev. <br/>
Bill C. Craft, executive director of Christian Life Ministries of Conroe. <br/>
&quot;Those promoting these liberal attitudes have the audacity to promote a <br/>
&#39;yes&#39; vote on a $10 million library bond issue.&quot;<br/>
A small group, led by the Northwoods Unitarian Universal Church of The <br/>
Woodlands, asked commissioners to keep the books on library shelves.<br/>
&quot;What is at issue is the attempt by certain individuals to impose their <br/>
views on the rest of the county,&quot; said K.E.S Palmisano of The Woodlands, <br/>
reading a statement from the church. &quot;It is contrary to the First <br/>
Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, press and religion. We are <br/>
free to decide for ourselves what to read and review.&quot;<br/>
Sadler has vowed to change the policy for selecting children&#39;s books within <br/>
30 days, probably adding citizen members to a local library panel that <br/>
examines books for purchase.<br/>
Also Monday, Frank P. Williamson of west Montgomery County complained that <br/>
the library refused to display a poster featuring an American flag and the <br/>
motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; until it was approved by the library board.<br/>
&quot;Here we are celebrating Sept. 11 and we can&#39;t post it in the library,&quot; <br/>
Williamson said.</div>

 </span></blockquote>The tactics described above are being used all across the country to limit the<br/>
information people have access to through libraries. Also, there is beginning<br/>
to be a strong movement here, and in Britain, to sell the libraries to private<br/>
corporations and run them privately. Sort of like Barnes & Noble taking over,<br/>
putting in a coffee shop, and lending out only what is most popular or<br/>
uncontroversial. All of these actions could have a significant impact on<br/>
limiting the materials available to our children&#39;s generation.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, rewriting history to fit a current agenda and limiting access to<br/>
previous generations writings in history that dispute the current view, it a<br/>
tactic that we all need to be concerned about.<br/>
