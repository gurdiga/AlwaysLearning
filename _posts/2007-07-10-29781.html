<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014122260">Beholden:  Back in the day (that would be about the 11th century)  <br/>
when behold meant &quot;hold by virtue of duty or obligation,&quot; this was  <br/>
its past participle. It has far outlived its parent&#39;s original  <br/>
meaning and we use it today as a predicate adjective meaning  <br/>
&quot;obligated.&quot;<br/>
=======================================================================<br/>
<br/>
That came in the daily e-mail from Visual Thesaurus, which you can  <br/>
use a few times free, but I subscribed to it because it has lots and  <br/>
lots of words presented in an unusual way, and it helps me think.   <br/>
$20 a year, which is a lot (considering there are dictionaries galore  <br/>
online), but if I think about what it would cost to take a single  <br/>
class on English and its history and depth, or to buy (another)  <br/>
dictionary or thesaurus, it seems more justifiable.<br/>
<br/>
My granny, who lived in Texas, used the word &quot;beholden.&quot;  She was  <br/>
born in the very early 20th century.  She used it two ways, and  <br/>
idiomatically, which means (to me, in this context) that she always  <br/>
used it in the same phrases, as part of a group of words.<br/>
<br/>
One way she used it was a politer and stronger version of &quot;thank  <br/>
you.&quot;  She would say &quot;I&#39;m much beholden to you.&quot;  She&#39;d even say it  <br/>
to me when I was a little girl, four or five years old.  It wasn&#39;t  <br/>
just &quot;thank you,&quot; it was &quot;I owe you one,&quot; and &quot;That was really  nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other way was a sharp kind of defensive insult that was used the  <br/>
way some people now will say &quot;she can kiss my butt.&quot;  It was &quot;I&#39;m not  <br/>
beholden&#39; to her.&quot;  It meant &quot;I don&#39;t owe her anything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So in both uses it had to do with a social indebtedness.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like having an museum-quality antique, to come across a word  <br/>
that is SO OLD and yet still in use.<br/>
<br/>
A newish song uses &quot;embark.&quot;   It&#39;s a Death Cab for Cutie song called  <br/>
&quot;I Will Follow Your into the Dark,&quot; and it says &quot;If there&#39;s no one  <br/>
beside you when your soul embarks, then I&#39;ll follow you into the dark.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Embark&quot; came into English from French, 600 years or so ago.  It  <br/>
means to take ship--to step onto a boat, to leave (usually).   <br/>
Nowadays it&#39;s usually in phrases like &quot;embarking on a new journey&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;embarking on a new phase of his life.&quot;  It&#39;s from a French word for  <br/>
a sailing ship, from a Latin word for a ship.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing about its use in reference to death is the whole River  <br/>
Styx idea from Greek mythology, that one travels into the underworld  <br/>
on a boat.<br/>
<br/>
Have I mentioned, lately, my strong belief that everything is connected?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347456600">My brother and I both often refer to a conversation we had with my  <br/>
dad, around 25 years ago, about a Rick Springfield song.<br/>
It was &quot;Jessie&#39;s Girl&quot;, and we all loved the song (and the album,  <br/>
though we had it on tape, and of course, we loved Rick).<br/>
There was a line, &quot;I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is  <br/>
probably moot&quot; (have to look up what it rhymed with in the couplet)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We both thought then, and now, that it was really a cool word to work  <br/>
into a song. If either of us use the word to each other (which we  <br/>
might try to do), it immediately brings up that song, and we share  <br/>
our inside joke about it.<br/>
<br/>
You dont hear moot very much.<br/>
<br/>
And, another story to do with my brother, I once asked him if he was  <br/>
&#39;casting aspersions on my character&#39;, which sparked a debate about  <br/>
the word aspersions, and if its ever used without &quot;casting&quot; right  <br/>
next to it. Anyone know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783959322">Usually only in the singular &quot;aspersion&quot; . . . it means &quot;a sprinkling<br/>
of water.&quot;<br/>
Occasionally, aspersions are modified as in &quot;vile aspersions&quot; meaning<br/>
that the things one is saying (gossip one is sprinkling about town,<br/>
say), is particularly vile.<br/>

at the piano working out the chords for &quot;I Will Follow You Into The<br/>
Dark&quot; because my BIL was playing it over and over at our holiday<br/>
bonfire last week.  He heard someone sing it at a party and downloaded<br/>
an MP3 version, so I made a chart for him. <br/>
<br/>
Before the 4th I&#39;d never heard of Death Cab for Cutie - I loved<br/>
listening to this song to learn the melody, and it&#39;s been in my head<br/>
for a couple of days.  Cool connections.  One of my favorite metaphors<br/>
 is the Buddhist concept Indra&#39;s Net, which envisions reality as a<br/>
shining web with a jewel at each intersection reflecting all the other<br/>
jewels, as in a hologram.  That&#39;s such a lovely image. <br/>

It is beautiful, and if you know of any art &quot;out there&quot; I&#39;d love to  <br/>
import some (or link it) to my connections page!<br/>
