<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418130305">1. Give your love generously and criticism sparingly. Be your  <br/>
children&#39;s partner. Support them and respect them. Never belittle  <br/>
them or their interests, no matter how superficial, unimportant, or  <br/>
even misguided their interests may seem to you. Be a guide, not a  <br/>
dictator. Shine a light ahead for them, and lend them a hand, but  <br/>
don&#39;t drag or push them. You WILL sometimes despair when your vision  <br/>
of what your child ought to be bangs up against the reality that they  <br/>
are their own person. But that same reality can also give you great  <br/>
joy if you learn not to cling to your own preconceived notions and  <br/>
expectations.<br/>
<br/>

This is one of thirteen items Pam Sorooshian wrote up in response to  <br/>
a question on a state list.  It will be new to most of the people here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to put the items out separately.<br/>
<br/>
Names for them would be cool.  Maybe they could have one-word names,  <br/>
or XandX names (Ren and Stimpy, Mutt and Jeff) like... support and  <br/>
respect (but I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d all have a two-word &quot;summary.&quot;<br/>
