<div id="ygrps-yiv-268796179">Hi everyone,<br/>
So this is actually my first post though i have been an active reader for many years. :)<br/>
<br/>
The reason i am finally posting is my family is coming to the US in 2 weeks! Our dates in CA will be 23/Oct - 4/Nov. We will be staying in Seal beach (Orange county area) and i would love some ideas from people!<br/>
My daughter is almost 7 and my son is 3.5yrs. Would anyone like to recommend some fun/cool stuff to do in the area in general? Places to check out?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d also especially be interested in any Halloween related stuff, we are staying with grandparents and will be doing our first trick o treat thing but we&#39;d love to hear if there is other fun stuff around?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d also be interested in any unschooling meets in the area during that time, would love to catch up for play.<br/>
<br/>
This is off topic so if you have any recommendations for us just drop me an email offlist on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lisabogle@...">lisabogle@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone - Happy Halloween :)<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Lisa</div>
