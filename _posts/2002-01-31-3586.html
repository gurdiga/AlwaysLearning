So don&#39;t you think that those people who hold close to the same ideals as you <br/>
have, and have lived them longer and with older children have nothing more to <br/>
offer than a newbie?<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, but if I want advice on how to handle a situation, I would turn to <br/>
Sandra, Joyce or Pam before I went to someone that has just started <br/>
Unschooling. Not that I haven&#39;t gotten great ideas from less experienced <br/>
people. I have. And I love talking to a lot of different people regardless of <br/>
how &quot;experienced&quot; they are. So I don&#39;t think any bias or prejudice was <br/>
implied. But if someone holds dear, the very philosophies which I believe <br/>
strongly in, and has applied them MANY more years than I, it is natural to <br/>
trust those voices as having a better grip on that idealistic philosophy.<br/>
And being in my 30&#39;s now, I have learned that I have a whole lot more to <br/>
learn than I thought I did in my 20&#39;s.<br/>
I have become more humble and willing to rethink previous beliefs. <br/>
Not everyone comes into that in their 30&#39;s...no. But a lot of people do. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s also quite possible that Kitrina might have a completely new idea <br/>
about something that&#39;s gone around for a while.  Up to a point, I agree <br/>
with what Sandra said about reading more and posting less.  But I also <br/>
dislike ageism, and would hate to see it taken that far.  (I don&#39;t think it <br/>
has, but maybe it feels that way to Kitrina.)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 26 now and had her first child when she was 19.  She read <br/>
almost every book she could get her hands on about childbirth, babies, and <br/>
child-rearing.  After Skye was born, she joined a mother&#39;s group.  These <br/>
women were all much older than she was, but they had done no research at <br/>
all into how they were going to parent their children.  They were basically <br/>
following the usual methods of our culture.  They were always looking down <br/>
their noses at her and her &quot;weird&quot; ideas.  (attachment parenting, etc.) <br/>
They may have had more life experience, but they didn&#39;t have more smarts <br/>
than she did.  She was a very mature young woman at that point.  I realize <br/>
the comparison doesn&#39;t completely work, but they could have learned <br/>
something from her, had they been willing to listen.<br/>

What you think of me is none of my business.<br/>

I don&#39;t doubt that.  I&#39;m sure the newest unschoolers here would have news for <br/>
people who&#39;ve never heard of unschooling.  But on this list, in this context, <br/>
to come and explain to us things we already know, or to argue things on <br/>
theory that we know from experience would be as for your daughter to have <br/>
pressed to have equal time, say and weight on a La Leche League discussion <br/>
with leaders and mothers of four, or on the Continuum Concept boards, without <br/>
regard to whether the people who wrote the books were in there hearing the <br/>
summary fed back to them.<br/>
<br/>
I think what&#39;s bothering me at this point is the repetition.<br/>
<br/>
If issues are being discussed, we can decide whether the opinions are valid, <br/>
but ALL that is being discussed is that we should consider the opinions of <br/>
young people valid.  Or consider their opinions regardless of experience and <br/>
age.  <br/>
<br/>
WHAT opinions?  If the only opinion is &quot;consider my opinion,&quot; repeating it <br/>
ten or twenty times should be sufficient.<br/>
