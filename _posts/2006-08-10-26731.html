<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356902811">This started off to be about critical thinking, but ended up being  <br/>
about Smurfs.  All this reading has warped my fragile little mind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Violence has increased 720% since 1982.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the whole sentence.  Doesn&#39;t specify what kind of violence or  <br/>
in what part of the world.  Just states plainly as fact, no data, no  <br/>
reference, Violence has increased 720%.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that increase is domestic violence.  That seems to have  <br/>
been much worse at least where I am before it was so illegal.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t think it was violent executions.  Those have become clinical  <br/>
for the most part.  It&#39;s not violence to kids in public school,  <br/>
because very few places will allow swats anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he means violence on TV, but if so it&#39;s probably an absolute  <br/>
number of instances per week or something, without allowing for there  <br/>
being hundreds of channels instead of three or four.<br/>
<br/>
When something can&#39;t be made to mean something, it just means  <br/>
nothing.  It&#39;s an absolutely meaningless statement.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another from the same thing (a transcript of a radio show):<br/>
-=-The Toy Industry as we know it today began in the early 1930&#39;s,  <br/>
during the depths of the Great Depression. Manufacturers realized  <br/>
that parents simply did not want to deny their children Christmas  <br/>
gifts, even in times that were very, very difficult. Parents would  <br/>
save all year long for the Christmas gifts for their children.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  But he didn&#39;t define &quot;as we know it  <br/>
today.&quot;  Maybe he&#39;s talking about the founding of some companies that  <br/>
still exist.  I don&#39;t know.  There were certainly toys made before  <br/>
that time, and even in factories.  Is anyone here a history-of-toys  <br/>
buff and know where that statement might have come from?  If parents  <br/>
couldn&#39;t afford potatoes for dinner, I doubt they were saving for  <br/>
Christmas anyway, so I think the whole thing just came out of the  <br/>
guy&#39;s imagination.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of imagination, I know lack of TV is supposed to make it  <br/>
magically arise, but this guy says toys are evil because they affect  <br/>
the fertile and active minds of children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Let us begin our discussion by examining what really happens when  <br/>
a child plays with a toy, any toy. In their minds, children become  <br/>
one with the toy, interacting with it and assuming the properties of  <br/>
it. If the toy is a figure, the child imagines that he possesses all  <br/>
the powers and abilities of the figure. If the toy is a Western gun  <br/>
set, the child imagines himself as being a cowboy or gunfighter. If  <br/>
the toy is a spaceship, the child imagines he is the captain of the  <br/>
ship, and assumes all the characteristics of the captain-=-<br/>
<br/>
Toys are evil, to this guy.  Papa Smurf is a White Witchdoctor.  My  <br/>
Little Pony displays a Satanic phenomenon:  they fly.  And (claims  <br/>
this guy) the popularization of unicorns came about because of My  <br/>
Little Pony.  That is incorrect.  I had friends (good Mormon girls in  <br/>
SLC) collecting unicorns in the late 1970s.  Daniel 8: 4-5 is  <br/>
supposed to describe a unicorn, something about the Anti-Christ.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know the Castle Greyskull was demon possessed.  I guess I  <br/>
didn&#39;t watch enough Masters of the Universe.  I&#39;ll ask Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  I had seen this article before.  It was starting to look  <br/>
familiar. Captain Planet is classic Satanism too.<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;ll leave it to individual  readers to see how Ninja Turtles  <br/>
and 101 Dalmations were designed to harvest your children&#39;s souls for  <br/>
Satan.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s a humor page.  Maybe it&#39;s someone just making mean fun  <br/>
of fundamentalists.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was a kid (early 60&#39;s) the only store we regularly shopped at  <br/>
that had toys was the drug store. Probably half an aisle of Barbies  <br/>
and board games and paddle balls. Pretty much like the big chain drug  <br/>
stores today but that was without Toys &#39;R Us.<br/>
<br/>
At Christmas time Penny&#39;s would clear out a big section of their  <br/>
downstairs -- which normally had furniture -- and bring in a wide  <br/>
array of toys. When Christmas was over, the toys were all cleared out  <br/>
and lawn furniture would appear.<br/>
<br/>
There must have been small toy stores that sold toys all year round  <br/>
but I can&#39;t remember any. I grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh so it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t like we were out in the middle of cornfields ;-)<br/>

<br/>
We were in the middle of... apple orchards near the river and cactus  <br/>
above the irrigated area. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had toys at the mercantile [Catholic statuary sold by the only  <br/>
Jewish family in town, rope, buckets (lots of feed store stuff, but  <br/>
no feed), storm lanterns, cowboy clothes) or at the department store  <br/>
(which was two long quonset huts side by side with clothes, hardware,  <br/>
dishes, records, and some books.  That was the best place for toys.   <br/>
They had one side of an aisle.  That store was called J.W. Owen&#39;s,  <br/>
and Mr. Owen used to drive to our house and give each of us four  <br/>
girls $5 every Christmas for a few years, because he also owned a  <br/>
burger drive-in and my dad had made the awnings that the cars parked  <br/>
under.  We girls all helped him do it, and Mr. Owen thought that was  <br/>
so sweet and charming he paid us a bonus every year for several years.<br/>
<br/>
That awning and the burger place are still there, but both of the  <br/>
stores have been razed.  Owen&#39;s was on land leased from Santa Clara  <br/>
Pueblo on a 99 year lease, that was up in the 1980&#39;s sometime.  The  <br/>
other place was just too old and ugly for Espanola.  They should&#39;ve  <br/>
kept it, but they didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And the grocery stores had little sections of cheap toys, as stores  <br/>
still do.  Balsa wood airplanes, marbles, jacks or tops or whatever  <br/>
was the seasonal thing.  Jump ropes.  Replacement Yahtzee pads.   <br/>
Checkers and checker boards sold separately.  &quot;Barrel of Monkeys.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But none of that proves or disproves anything about the toy industry  <br/>
in the 1930&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Albuquerque did have a real, fulltime toy store called &quot;Toys by  <br/>
Roy,&quot; at Winrock mall.  It was a NICE store.  That&#39;s where I saw the  <br/>
Spanish castle blocks we couldn&#39;t afford before Kirby was born and  <br/>
that I later found for $5 at a thrift store.  Toys by Roy used to  <br/>
sponsor one of the afternoon kids&#39; shows that had a studio audience  <br/>
and showed some cartoons, or re-runs of old serials that had first  <br/>
been shown in weekly installments at the movie theaters.<br/>
<br/>
