<div id="ygrps-yiv-446466098">**Holly&#39;s exciting European vacation is halfway over today, and I have a <br/>
story about a story involving little fish they played with in holes on <br/>
Omaha Beach in Normandy. **<br/>
<br/>
The June 6th issue of U.S. News and World Report has a cover story: Remembering Reagan: How His Great D-Day Speech Changed a Nation.  (The speech he gave at the Pointe du Hoc monument.)  You might want to grab a copy while it&#39;s still on the stands, to illustrate that event some for Holly, while Normandy is fresh in her mind.<br/>
<br/>
(Although, I admit the magazine lacks the &quot;oomph&quot; that a video clip would have, but I bet Google would supply that.)<br/>
