<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668266870">A friend whose husband left her recently phoned me asking for help <br/>
continuing to homeschool her sons.  Her husband had always supported <br/>
homeschooling until she walked into mediation recently, when he <br/>
shocked  her by saying he wants joint custody and by the way, &quot;Isn&#39;t it <br/>
time the boys were in school?&quot;  She was asking me for some short, like one <br/>
or two sentences or so, arguments in favour of homeschooling that might <br/>
sway an ex-husband.  I thought since I&#39;ve heard of a number of cases like <br/>
this in the last year or so, that maybe we could generate a list of &quot;pithy <br/>
sayings&quot; about homeschooling that might help these mothers.  Maybe we could <br/>
put them up on a web page for others to use.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that these guys *really* rot my socks.  It&#39;s one thing if the <br/>
husband had been even slightly negative about homeschooling before the <br/>
breakup, but in all the cases I&#39;ve heard about, they&#39;ve been totally <br/>
supportive until they left and realized that they could pay less support if <br/>
the wife went back to work, which wouldn&#39;t be possible if she continued to <br/>
homeschool.<br/>

homeschooling while he has custody.  If he wasn&#39;t involved when they were<br/>
married, maybe he doesn&#39;t know what to do.  Are they unschoolers or<br/>
homeschoolers?   Is he thinking he&#39;ll have to miss work when the kids are<br/>
with him in order to homeschool?  Is he thinking about how badly he did<br/>
in math?  She might address that.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, she might appeal to his protective nature.  The upheaval of divorce<br/>
will be difficult for their children, shouldn&#39;t they try to keep the rest<br/>
of their lives as normal as possible.  The changes of divorce are bad<br/>
enough,  the change of schooling might be overwhelming.   Maybe a  &quot;now<br/>
isn&#39;t the right time&quot;  approach is better than an &quot;over my dead body&quot;<br/>
approach.   <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of single, working, homeschooling moms.  It&#39;s probably<br/>
very hard, but it&#39;s not impossible.  She shouldn&#39;t feel like she&#39;s at his<br/>
mercy.   Maybe hearing from some of those working moms would help.   <br/>
When this happened to a friend of mine she found other homeschoolers,<br/>
working and not, willing to co-op child care. <br/>
 <br/>
How sad if it really is about the money.<br/>
