<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892492425">My son, who was relaxed homeschooled all of his life, is trying out public<br/>
school for the first time in his life this year.  I really want him to come<br/>
back home next year - I&#39;ve seen the attitude change -  and I was trying to<br/>
think of an incentive.  He loves Diablo II.  Do any of you have children who<br/>
play Diablo II?  I was thinking he could do that until he beats the darn<br/>
game and can move on to something else.  That would be my incentive.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, are there any unschool discussion groups for children?  I think if he<br/>
could find a group like that he might enjoy being at home - gaming.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I heard an interview with Sandra Dodd and it was really eye-opening!<br/>
It was on the radio free school?  <br/>

<br/>
If he wants to come home, why should he have to wait until next year?<br/>
<br/>
But if he doesn&#39;t want to come home, and he came home for a video game, would <br/>
that really be enough?<br/>
<br/>

Also, are there any unschool discussion groups for children?  I think if he<br/>
could find a group like that he might enjoy being at home - gaming.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an unschooler gamer list (I don&#39;t know of real-time chats, but a <br/>
mailing list) and it&#39;s linked on this page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
along with the UnschoolingBasics list which might be good for you, if you <br/>
really want to move toward purer unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you just buy him the game now, and let him know about that list?  <br/>
But other lists or message boards for Diablo II players (regardless of whether <br/>
they homeschool) might be even better.<br/>
<br/>
If learning and happiness are high on your list of priorities, and the game <br/>
could provide any of that, it&#39;s probably worth getting.  Maybe it will make him <br/>
wish he didn&#39;t have school.   Maybe not.  But to use it as a prize for <br/>
quitting school doesn&#39;t seem right and good to me.  In its absence (if he wants it) <br/>
you add a punishment for his being in school.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case you haven&#39;t considered other ways to deal with his being in <br/>
school:<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for all the advice and links!  He was excited to learn that there was<br/>
actually a list like that.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorry I wasn&#39;t very detailed.  He has the game, Diablo II, and has been<br/>
playing it all year in his spare time.  He was even waking up at 5:00am to<br/>
play it before school started each morning.  This is my son who slept until<br/>
noon for most of his life!  (He had never been to school)  I want him to<br/>
beat Diablo already so that he can move on to something else.  He has<br/>
learned so much from playing this game:  looking up cheats, downloading and<br/>
installing programs to help him move up levels, and he even made a web page<br/>
about games that he likes.  I want him to come home so that he can continue<br/>
to learn, but it was his idea to try out public school and I thought I would<br/>
make him do one year.  He enjoys school, but he enjoyed home too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also want him to come back home because we used to travel when we all were<br/>
on the same schedule.  My husband does shift work and has seven consecutive<br/>
days off each month!  (if he takes three days off, he ends up with 14<br/>
consecutive days off!)  We have not been able to just pick up and go since<br/>
he is trying out public school.  My son sees pros and cons for with both<br/>
settings; public and home.  He likes public school some days and he wants to<br/>
return home on others. I just tried to help in that decision by telling him<br/>
that if he came home, he could play his game more and maybe even meet some<br/>
kids who play too.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I did want him to put in ONE year of public school, since it was his idea to<br/>
try it out.  I didn&#39;t want him to go back and forth in his mind.  This<br/>
public school experience DEMYSTIFIED the whole public school concept in his<br/>
mind and he knows he was never missing out on anything. But this has been<br/>
the most inactive year of our family life because of the school&#39;s schedule!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What he loves most about school: report cards  (He has no negative<br/>
association with them so he thinks they are exciting and new!  We never<br/>
tested or kept grades, except at his request in third grade.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me vent.<br/>
