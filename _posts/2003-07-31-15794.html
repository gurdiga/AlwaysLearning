thornless blackberries (If anyone wants one of the thornless blackberries, put in <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944001319">Wow you guys,  I can&#39;t imagine planting anything in the end of July,  how<br/>
nice!   I&#39;m in Minnesota, so short growing season :)<br/>
<br/>
I would also take some extra squash Deb!   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We built this house, that we are living in and were particular about not<br/>
taking out too many trees.   I love trees.  But...didn&#39;t think about the<br/>
fact that if you have lots of trees, you don&#39;t have much sun and,, hence,<br/>
no place for a garden :(<br/>
<br/>
I did get to grow some tomatoes on our deck last year but you can only do so<br/>
much there!<br/>
<br/>
So as far as growing things right now,  its been flowers around the house.<br/>
(and weeds)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to figure out where we can take out some more trees though!  And<br/>
then we have to put up a 6-9 foot fence to keep the deer out!<br/>
