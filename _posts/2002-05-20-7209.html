I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re back and posting.  I&#39;ve enjoyed your insights and<br/>
observations so much!  <br/>
Dylan is now picking up a few Korean words as well.  His Karate club has<br/>
a visiting Tae Kwon Do instructor a few times a month, and in just this<br/>
short time, with no special effort, he&#39;s counting in Korean or Japanese,<br/>
responding to commands in the appropriate language and even painted a<br/>
poster for the club in Japanese.   I don&#39;t know about Portuguese.... It<br/>
sounds intimidating! &lt;G&gt;  All I can say is I&#39;m glad you speak English so<br/>
well, because if we had to communicate using my Japanese, you&#39;d never<br/>
know what I was talking about...  These smart children will translate for<br/>
us, maybe.  <br/>
