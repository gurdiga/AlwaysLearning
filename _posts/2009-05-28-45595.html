<div id="ygrps-yiv-694399734">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Tracey and I am a mother of five.  We all use My Father&#39;s World curriculum right now, but unschooling has definately caught my attention lately.  The freedom of it...anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But, how do you allow high schoolers that freedom while making sure that they pass their SAT&#39;s and such?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938313883">First - be concrete and clear about what you mean by &quot;SAT&#39;s and such.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are you talking state-required assessment tests or college entrance <br/>
tests? What is &quot;and such.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Second, be concrete and clear about why they are needed. Is there a <br/>
&quot;real&quot; purpose served or are you jumping through hoops? Is there a way <br/>
around the hoops?<br/>
<br/>
Third - to get the most from this list, it will help to tell us what <br/>
your kids love, what they want to pursue, what are they like? <br/>
Unschooling means supporting them - we can help you come up with ways to <br/>
do that.<br/>

<br/>
My priorities changed because of unschooling.   It&#39;s not my job to  <br/>
&quot;make sure&quot; my kids pass tests, or go to college.  It&#39;s my job to keep  <br/>
them safe and happy and learning, and I did that pretty well!<br/>
<br/>
If a family sees the SAT test is bigger and more important than safe/ <br/>
happy/learning, then they probably won&#39;t be happy with unschooling.    <br/>
But you&#39;re not the mother of the SAT tests, so don&#39;t focus your life  <br/>
on that.<br/>
