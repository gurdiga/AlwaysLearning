I&#39;ve almost been killed on my bike by many drivers down here and the fact <br/>
that they don&#39;t know how to use the freeway makes me extremely frustrated <br/>
with southern drivers. Having lived in several areas, I can honestly say that <br/>
the drivers are worse in this area.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t meant to reflect on you, nor on people that don&#39;t want to live in <br/>
the big city.<br/>
A person should know how to drive on freeways if they&#39;re going to use them.<br/>
Idiots don&#39;t belong on the road, they&#39;ll kill you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372559135">&quot;Sorry, bad reaction on my part&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t apologize...I felt bad for over generalizing.<br/>
There just seems to be a monopoly on bad driving here and I&#39;m a bit <br/>
cynical as of late. Dh was hit on his bike, hit and run situation. He <br/>
didn&#39;t get the license number since he&#39;s near sighted...really sucks.<br/>
Thankfully he wasn&#39;t hurt and his bike got hit on the pedal which <br/>
probably damaged the car more than his bike.<br/>
We regularly get cut off by drivers, stuck behind people that don&#39;t <br/>
know how to merge and read bumper stickers that say &quot;Time to Kick <br/>
some Ass&quot; with a big American flag on it.<br/>
(I suppose there are other lamo&#39;s in other cities with those )<br/>
And then there is the confederate flag thing.....I see enough of <br/>
those in windows of cars to make me ill.<br/>
I really do understand the pride in region thing, but that old <br/>
confederate flag seems to imply a hell-uva-lot more down here, YK?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry to upset ya! I love a lot of things about the South.<br/>
And if you&#39;re homesick, come on down. Pensacola isn&#39;t far from Mobile <br/>
and there are fab beaches to hang at.<br/>

Oh thanks, rub it in then!! Hmmmmphf...<br/>
I really, really liked the parts of New Mexico we saw while on a road trip <br/>
four years ago. But the main problem is lots and lots of beach without the <br/>
acompanying OCEAN! lol<br/>
We mainly moved here for the beaches and the weather.<br/>
If it weren&#39;t for that, we&#39;d be living elsewhere.<br/>
Pensacola is a pretty cool town, it&#39;s just when you start getting away from <br/>
the downtown area it gets more and more Southern (in a redneck kinda way) and <br/>
less and less eclectic and artsy and interesting.<br/>
So we live in town and research other areas of the world, and talk to all of <br/>
you to keep sane!! :)<br/>
I&#39;m finding some  cool people here in the South though, really.<br/>

dates back to the Byzantine empire, as does the double-headed eagle, another<br/>

&gt; Maybe to a few but in West Virginia, most of those who sport them on<br/>
&gt; their vehicle of flying above their front door are not that concerned<br/>
&gt; about politics. The nazi swastika was originally a native american<br/>

The Swastika is way older than the nazi&#39;s. It can be found in <br/>
sumerian documents form 4000 years ago, in India adorning the <br/>
temples. The nazi&#39;s pinched it. I used to know why but can&#39;t <br/>
remeber right this second.<br/>
