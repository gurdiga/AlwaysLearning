<div id="ygrps-yiv-858779146">I&#39;ve moved everything out of my office into two other rooms and part of a <br/>
storage shed.  SO... stuff that has been in piles and boxes has come to the <br/>
surface.  And some stuff that was on the surface has gone into piles and <br/>
boxes.  Always frightening and exciting.<br/>
<br/>
I was throwing away old catalogs and shipping lists and remembering when my <br/>
kids were younger and my favorite catalogs were Hearthsong and Chinaberry.  <br/>
And I came across a catalog for Geographics t-shirts.  A friend had given it <br/>
to me in 1995.  FUNNY stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
So... I went to www.google.com, and here they are!<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m going to tell you what&#39;s on three of the shirts, and then quote from the <br/>
page on custom ordering.  I really like the guy&#39;s style of writing.  They&#39;re <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427841799">Okay,<br/>
So I&#39;m on this mostly-hs-mainstream list with some decent folk and some <br/>
real linear thinkers, okay?  And this one woman comes across with (get <br/>
this) *reading curriculum*!!!!  and she&#39;s saying how she makes her kid take <br/>
tests because *they live in the real world* and she doesn&#39;t want him to be <br/>
limited in his future life or something equally inane.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I mostly-politely posted how tests don&#39;t mean diddly squat and <br/>
have absolutely no relation to anything else when all I wanted to do was <br/>
yell that she was a DOOFUS doing that to her kid when Testing Doesn&#39;t Mean <br/>
Diddly Squat You Insecure Doofus Of An Unthinking Dolt!<br/>
So, I wanted to vent here because I&#39;m tired of hearing such stupid, doofus, <br/>
mindless, kid-wasting things out there in the world and getting frustrated <br/>
about it is seriously inhibiting my linguistic abilities because I don&#39;t <br/>
usually repeat my insults and can generally come up with something a great <br/>
deal more interesting than &#39;doofus&#39; and &#39;dolt&#39;...  but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
The sheer inability of people to break from that &#39;educator-think&#39; mold is, <br/>
is, well, it&#39;s infuriating.  I want to go shake them all until they can&#39;t <br/>
think straight and maybe a fresh thought will break into their stagnant, <br/>
pudding-filled brainpans.  Yeah, right.  Next millennium maybe.<br/>
<br/>
GRRRRrrrrrrrrrrr......<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  Right.<br/>
I&#39;d quit the list, but then they&#39;d talk all the newbies into curriculum <br/>
lists and essential tests and etc.  I&#39;ll leave it someday, but maybe not <br/>
just yet.  I&#39;ve got a few more people to free.<br/>
It&#39;s nice to have somewhere where I&#39;m *not* the radical.<br/>
Thanks for sitting through the vent.<br/>

couldn&#39;t be winners... Some parents really buy into that reflected glory thing<br/>
too. And, to some, I think it is sort of god with them, the god of &quot;Quantify&quot;<br/>
everything cut up into it&#39;s tiniest parts and formed into a chart all neat and<br/>
tidy for all the world to see. And they graph the aberrations in their kids as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
You know how they are advertising wireless phones with pictures now? I just<br/>
had this mental image of some of those folks considering &quot;picture phone time&quot;<br/>
with their kids as &quot;quality time&quot;. And imagining them glance at their watches<br/>
to make sure they talk long enough... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074634253">Heidi, I laughed so hard at your post.....I GET it, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
You are describing my neighbor, but she isn&#39;t a homeschooler.  She goes on<br/>
and on about the stupidity of school, the idiocy of homework (her son is in<br/>
first grade), then goes on to babble about how when he writes he still gets<br/>
his letters backwards (well, duh, it&#39;s normal and he&#39;s only six!).  I keep<br/>
using Sandra&#39;s line on her, &quot;Well, you could always pull him out.....&quot; or<br/>
&quot;There ARE alternatives...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last week the boy called, wanting to come over and play with my kids.  I<br/>
said, sure, they&#39;re out riding bikes.  Bring yours.  Well, he shows up with<br/>
his dad, sans bike.  The dad says he couldn&#39;t bring his bike because he<br/>
can&#39;t ride it yet.  I asked about the training wheels.  Well, dontcha know,<br/>
the parents took them off back in the spring trying to coerce the kid into<br/>
riding without them (why???) and he (the kid) doesn&#39;t want to.  So I said,<br/>
why don&#39;t you just put them back on?  He&#39;ll ride without when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
The dad sheepishly admitted he threw them out.  I countered with the fact<br/>
that they&#39;re only ten bucks at Wal-Mart, you could buy new ones.  Meanwhile,<br/>
the kid has been without a bike ALL SUMMER, YOU MORON!!  (I wanted to shout<br/>
that but didn&#39;t.)  He left, and his kid happily rode my 4yo&#39;s bike with<br/>
training wheels (BWEG:) while ds rode his trike so all 3 could ride.<br/>

I don&#39;t go to the local homeschooling meetings anymore.  My choice is to sit <br/>
on a bench and hear calmly how someone can&#39;t get her child to do her work (a <br/>
four or five year old, sometimes) OR for me to go into unschooling.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to do either, in person, with people who might not even be back.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could just not read the list for a few weeks and then go in twice a <br/>
month or so with links to unschooling stuff and a reminder for new people <br/>
that the school model doesn&#39;t work or it would be working at school!<br/>

I am relatively new to unschooling  (I have 5.5 yo and 2.5 yo boys) and<br/>
we have just started incorporating the concepts into all areas of our lives.<br/>
We got rid of tv/computer limits about a month or so ago (that is going<br/>

in the adjustment phase and hoping to survive. Still debating the wisdom of<br/>

The best time!!<br/>
<br/>
OTHER people paid for the materials.<br/>
<br/>
All our lives people say &quot;If you eat too much of that you&#39;ll get sick.&quot;    <br/>
Some people have never managed to get sick no matter how much candy they eat. <br/>
 Some have.  But we don&#39;t know what&#39;s true unless we actually try it.  And <br/>
sick from candy is rarely worse than not wanting more, or the squirts.<br/>
<br/>
And the amount it takes to get sick is not three pieces.<br/>
<br/>
But how cool when a kid tastes a piece of candy and throws the rest in the <br/>
trash because he feels so rich with all his halloween candy that it&#39;s <br/>
expendable and he CAN throw it in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are not allowed candy will eat ALL of the most horrible little <br/>
piece, because it cost them so much to get it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome, Stephanie. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve eaten way more Halloween candy than either of my daughters have (and I<br/>
was raised with limits &lt;g&gt;). We usually &quot;combine the tubs&quot; of candy after a<br/>
few days. This year, the day after Halloween when I was organizing<br/>
things-in-general I asked the girls if they minded if we just put all the<br/>
candy (both of theirs, some extras I&#39;d bought, plus the leftovers that<br/>
didn&#39;t get handed out Halloween night) in one big tub.<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If they were limited, they&#39;d be candy misers like I was growing up. Sharing<br/>
out of one big tub would be abhorrent to them.<br/>
<br/>
When my youngest asked if there were any more Twix and I told her there<br/>
weren&#39;t, she took it philosophically. I also told her I&#39;d pick them up next<br/>
time I went to the store.<br/>
<br/>
I like our way better. :)<br/>

parents who just kept their kids out of school and did nothing with <br/>
them.  This it the justification for the gov.  coming in to test all <br/>
kids, even homeschooled ones.  One of my sisters very firmily told <br/>
me I should have my kids tested, IF ONLY to be sure they know how to <br/>
take tests!  Oh gee, they don&#39;t even know that I am one of the <br/>
crazies who doesn&#39;t do a reading curriculum.  Since we were heading <br/>

was working!  (Back in the dark ages.)  There was a report they would have to <br/>
compile on excel every month tracking workers compensation costs by <br/>
department by injury and updating the real dollars spent and the dollars in <br/>
reserve in cast the claim blew up.  It was complicated, involved, really a <br/>
pain in the ass to do.  I would spend a lot of time reviewing it, monitoring <br/>
the claims, etc.  Turns out all the managers who NEEDED the report were not <br/>
even reading it and couldn&#39;t interpret it if they wanted to.  But they needed <br/>
something for their files and it looked pretty.<br/>

So, yes, some things in life are like the testing these parents are requiring <br/>
of their kids.  But they are still asinine.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719051546">Hey all,<br/>
I&#39;m recently back from a three-week across-the-country (well, mostly) trip <br/>
with my darling 16 year old daughter.  And we&#39;re both alive! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what made it possible were two things.<br/>
1. Books on tape (from library and a discount book store)(Daughter hated <br/>
them, but I told her tough ta-tas unless she was willing to drive.  She <br/>
wasn&#39;t.)<br/>
2. Feather pillow on my car seat, under my tuchus.<br/>
(Glory Hallelujah!  Makes all the difference in the world.)<br/>
1 again. I chose the trip path going out, Daughter chose the trip path <br/>
going back.<br/>
(okay, so it&#39;s two things plus a third.)<br/>
2. Lots of snacky food in the back seat, reachable, and stopping for food <br/>
whenever one of us is hungry.<br/>
(Okay, four things.)<br/>
1. Driving late at night so we could get some distance, but letting <br/>
ourselves sleep late in the morning (&#39;cause that&#39;s the way our body clocks <br/>
work.)<br/>
(alright, so who&#39;s counting?)<br/>
2. Being willing to drive on the Extraterrestrial Highway and not minding <br/>
taking a wrong turn and having to go through Death Valley instead of <br/>
someplace a little less warm.  (When we make a wrong turn, we *really* make <br/>
a wrong turn!)<br/>
<br/>
And those are my two secrets for successful long car rides.<br/>
Most important is maybe only traveling with one other person.  Makes it <br/>
easier to meet everyone&#39;s needs, especially your own. (grin)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We (Rae, Zaria (Rae&#39;s NBTSC friend who lives in Ohio and I) high tailed it <br/>
across on Hwy 70 (get out your atlas&#39;s) from California to Ohio, took the <br/>
back roads where Cali meets Nv and wasn&#39;t that pretty!, stopped in Reno at <br/>
Circus Circus (lost $20 at the slots and $20 for the kids to win stuffed <br/>
animals in the kiddy part so we&#39;d have something to bring back to her <br/>
brother.)  Realized I&#39;d left *ALL* of my clothing at home, so I have a <br/>
circus-circus outfiit now with boxer underwear that says &#39;Big Winner!&#39; <br/>
(grin).  Stopped at various truck stops as soon as I figured they had <br/>
hawaiian shirts on sale and a stock of big-waisted sweatpants.  I&#39;m all <br/>
stocked up now, good and festive.  (and Y-fronts are *amazingly* <br/>
comfortable, ladies!   You might want to try them!)  Stopped again for gas <br/>
somewhere in Montana and discovered &#39;Fred&#39;s Place&#39; where the table setter <br/>
is 95 years old if he&#39;s a day and all the ranchers looked at us curiously <br/>
and the cook had his (pretty inane, but kind of funny) books self-published <br/>
and on each of the tables (available for purchase!) and they have the <br/>
World&#39;s Best Hamburgers!  Honest!  Had some tire-work done shortly <br/>
thereafter and the tire place gave us (just handed the keys over - no ID, <br/>
no nothin&#39;) this old conversion van from the early 70&#39;s, puke brown and <br/>
green with the little window in the rear and shag carpeting on the walls, <br/>
so we had fun trucking around in that for a while, trying to remember all <br/>
the disco tunes we knew until the tires were fixed.  Ran out of gas in <br/>
Nebraska or Iowa someplace at 11 at night.  Luckily gas was less than a <br/>
mile away.  Hooray!  Stopped a few other places, but we&#39;d mostly just sped <br/>
to get to Ohio where I dropped the girls off to visit awhile.  I went to <br/>
Minnesota, then took the ferry (complete with stateroom!) from Wisconsin to <br/>
Michigan to visit my new baby nephew and other assorted family members, <br/>
helped my brother paint his house, picked Rae up in Ohio again and mostly <br/>
took 80 back.  We stopped for barbeque in St. Louis (went up the arch then <br/>
made it to the local AAA office five minutes before closing, but the guy <br/>
loved our trip and was hauling out maps left and right finding great places <br/>
for us to go and didn&#39;t leave until well after closing time) and Kansas <br/>
City (love that barbeque!)  I said I&#39;d wait to see carhenge (Nebraska) <br/>
until the next trip out, so she could do four corners and I could visit an <br/>
indian site (NM, or Arizona, I think.) I forgot my pillow in a hotel, but <br/>
called them and they UPS&#39;d it back home so we didn&#39;t have to turn <br/>
around.   Hooray!  The Extra Terrestrial highway (long and flat, funky <br/>
vegetation!), almost running out of gas along the ET because there were <br/>
*no* gas stations and I didn&#39;t think to turn around and fill up completely <br/>
(15 gallon tank, it took 14.3 gallons to fill it when we finally found <br/>
gas!), almost getting a ticket in some little bitty town in Nevada, right <br/>
near the California border, missing the turnoff and going south into death <br/>
valley (hot, hot, hot, hot!) then through Yosemite and back home to the bay <br/>
area!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the most unexpected part was losing the tread on a tire - <br/>
Twice!  I know what it feels and sounds like now and I have four new tires <br/>
on the car.  Hooray!  ..and then there was the time the air conditioner&#39;s <br/>
overflow tube got plugged up and we started a swimming pool on the right <br/>
side of the car.  What a hoot!  Couldn&#39;t figure it out for the longest time.<br/>
<br/>
The best part was somewhere in Kansas, passing up seeing the six legged cow <br/>
(thank goodness), stopping for gas and lunch, looking to the right and <br/>
seeing the Prairie Museum.  They had a really cool sod house, The Biggest <br/>
Barn in Kansas, an old 1800&#39;s house with furnishings and an old school <br/>
house we could walk through - all on our own, with nobody else around, and <br/>
we could touch whatever we wanted.  The outhouse was smelly.  Still in use, <br/>
I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Inside was a museum that was made up of things folks have in their houses - <br/>
and not necessarily from a long time ago.  It was kind of odd the things <br/>
the curator valued.  Gaudy jewelry from the 1950&#39;s like my grandmama would <br/>
wear, in a case right next to a tiffany vase.  A little wacky!  It was kind <br/>
of like an every-day-person&#39;s museum with stuff a person would have <br/>
accumulated themselves.  It was great!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d do it again in a minute, now that I&#39;m all rested up again.<br/>

That sounds fantastic!<br/>
How long were you away?<br/>
Did you count up the miles you&#39;d driven?<br/>

I&#39;m planning to do a road trip of the US when my daughter is older.<br/>
That sounds just fab.<br/>
