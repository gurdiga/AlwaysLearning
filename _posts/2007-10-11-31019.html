<div id="ygrps-yiv-697245713">I recently had an interesting conversation with someone I had just <br/>
met.<br/>
<br/>
She had several grown children that she homeschooled for over a <br/>
decade, beginning in the eary 90&#39;s. She was telling me about their <br/>
experiences learning about homeschooling, how the support groups have <br/>
changed over the years, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she said, &quot;There were some people in the groups -- not many --<br/>
 who weren&#39;t really homeschoolers. They were just using the <br/>
homeschool laws to hide behind their kids&#39; truancy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought she meant the kids were getting caught for <br/>
skipping school, and were telling the authorities they homeschooled <br/>
just to get off the hook.<br/>
<br/>
But then she went on: &quot;They were basically imposters. They filled out <br/>
the paperwork claiming that they were homeschoolers, and they called <br/>
themselves homeschoolers, but they weren&#39;t actually doing it. So <br/>
their kids were actually truant. They were neither homeschooling nor <br/>
attending school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked (as politely as I could), &quot;But how could you know that they <br/>
weren&#39;t truly homeschooling? You weren&#39;t in their home 24 hours a <br/>
day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, quite confidently, &quot;I knew these people personally, and I <br/>
knew what their kids were like, and I knew how they said they were <br/>
spending their days, and it clearly didn&#39;t add up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought this was all very interesting, and somewhat <br/>
amusing. I tend to assume these &quot;imposters&quot; were unschoolers, but it <br/>
did make me wonder if there are people who &quot;use homeschooling laws&quot; <br/>
just to be negligent, or if that&#39;s even possible to do.<br/>
<br/>
I also wondered if it was common for traditional homeschoolers to <br/>
view unschoolers as being negligent, or imposters, or &quot;not really <br/>
homeschoolers,&quot; or something similar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869476908">I have a friend who is doing this.  She pulled her kids out of school to &quot;homeschool&quot;.  When she does attend homeschool get togethers (about once a year) she tells people &quot;I homeschool, but I don&#39;t&quot;  If they ask what she means by that she says that she &quot;unschools, kind of&quot;  She really does nothing with them.  She doesnt work, but lives off of welfare, her house is beyond messy, and her kids are always playing video games at the neighbors house or running around outside unsupervised.  She admits that she doesnt do anything with them, but someday she&#39;d like to.  It&#39;s been 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
There is a huge difference between unschooling and not schooling, but to &quot;outsiders&quot; they probably look the same.  People question all the time what we are doing and they agree that it is good educational stuff, but most people not familiar with it, still want to see book work and test scores.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910072052">-=-it did make me wonder if there are people who &quot;use homeschooling  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s easy to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning I had surprise correspondence with someone who&#39;s  <br/>
been saying &quot;unschooling&quot; for many years.  The oldest ran away, the  <br/>
second is in school and the third is considering school.<br/>
<br/>
More than anything academic, what a family needs is happiness and  <br/>
joy.  Learning can flow in, when there are smiles and there&#39;s  <br/>
relaxation and humor.  Nothing but more negativity can flow in when  <br/>
negativity is valued and encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
Last week I gave a talk about how important it is to find ways to be  <br/>
happier.<br/>
I&#39;ve really become to believe that cynicism is one of the worst  <br/>
traits a person can have, and it&#39;s contagious, and cynics shame  <br/>
others who don&#39;t share their twisted view.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  I&#39;ve heard many times that unschooling is lazy and  <br/>
irresponsible and ungodly and neglectful.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are really good people, but some of that is probably  <br/>
genetics, some is luck (horrible things could have happened to us but  <br/>
haven&#39;t, yet; might not at all), but much is joy and opportunity and  <br/>
loving support and stimulation of all sorts.<br/>
