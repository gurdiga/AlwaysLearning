<div id="ygrps-yiv-827005718">When I was little I went out for a walk and got lost. We lived on the <br/>
edge of a small town and I remember something about being scared by a <br/>
pen of pigs and running away from them, ending up in the cornfield <br/>
behind our house.<br/>
<br/>
Although the memory is vague now, I stood between a couple stalks of <br/>
corn to hide and leaned forward to look down the row. There was a <br/>
blinding light rushing toward me and I felt like I was being propelled <br/>
WAAAAAY up in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what this memory is about, but it was a major one and <br/>
every time I started talking to a therapist about it my whole body <br/>
would tremble.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve checked for scoop marks in my skin and haven&#39;t found any (remember <br/>
that?). &lt;g&gt;<br/>
