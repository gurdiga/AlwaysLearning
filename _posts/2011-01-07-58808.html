<div id="ygrps-yiv-288066166">An article in the New York Times says that children have forgotten how to play.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For several years, studies and statistics have been mounting that suggest the culture of play in the United States is vanishing.&quot;<br/>

I am astonished at the notion that children need to be taught how to play!<br/>
<br/>
In the article there is various blame to go around, including video games.<br/>
My 4 year old loves playing games on my IPhone, and also comes up with wonderful, imaginative games on his own. He knows how to play, we didnt teach him, but we do join in.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so lucky that I found Unschooling and this group.<br/>
