&gt;<br/>
&gt;If someone reads embroidery books (as I do, for fun, like fantasy) <br/>
&gt;but doesn&#39;t embroider (as I don&#39;t, because I&#39;m very impatient and my stitches <br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t pretty), what&#39;s THAT!?  It&#39;s me, appreciating other people&#39;s <br/>
&gt;embroidery, and looking at the beautiful pictures of ethnic, traditional <br/>
&gt;embroidery that I can&#39;t personally do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Wow.  It&#39;s the only thing that fits.<br/>
