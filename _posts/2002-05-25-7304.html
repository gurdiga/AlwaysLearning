<div id="ygrps-yiv-476476212">As a mother who has been there and done that. I can ask when these <br/>
moments occur have you had your nap that day? LOL<br/>
<br/>
Actually I learned something from another support group called HALT, <br/>
it works for so many aspects of life. Hungry,Angry, Lonely and Tired. <br/>
All of which apply to a mother with young children on any given day <br/>
of the week. The bottom line, when you are feeling irritable stop and <br/>
allow yourself the luxury of checking in with your body. Are you <br/>
tired? Has it been more than 4 hours since you have spoken with <br/>
someone on your own adult level? When was the last time you met your <br/>
physical, emotional or spiritual needs? <br/>
<br/>
I can trace my every impatient moment back to one of these. Then too <br/>
I read a book called positive parenting, can&#39;t remember off the top <br/>
of my head who the author was, however, she talked about these <br/>
moments and called them, low energy moments. It was the first time I <br/>
entertained the thought that just maybe i didn&#39;t have to be in a <br/>
wonderful high energy mood all day long. Just acknowledging I felt <br/>
low allowed me to pull into myself like a turtle, speak as few as <br/>
words as necessary and just give myself time to turtle until my <br/>
energy level came back up or I had time to do something for myself. <br/>
<br/>
To only have a few of these moments you are really doing great and <br/>
trust me when I say this is the most challenging task you will ever <br/>
face however, no other success compares!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerly,<br/>
<br/>
