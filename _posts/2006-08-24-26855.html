<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479354645">Below is part of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/notfunny">http://sandradodd.com/notfunny</a> and I don&#39;t know how  <br/>
it will come out in e-mails, but I hadn&#39;t mentioned this $5 way to  <br/>
&quot;light up someone&#39;s day&quot; with an &quot;all-too-true&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
The sign is &quot;Raising children is like being pecked to death by a  <br/>
chicken.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once someone posted on a list I *was* on &quot;raising a teenager is like  <br/>
nailing jello to a tree.&quot;  I report the outcome of that below and on  <br/>
the page linked above.<br/>
<br/>
HOW MUCH HAPPIER those families could have been had they dealt  <br/>
directly with one another as the actual people they were instead of  <br/>
taking on roles and spouting phrases they happened to have at the tip  <br/>
of their tongue (without thinking of where those bits of pre-formated  <br/>
dialog came from)...<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE my teens.  They&#39;re better people than those who manufacture  <br/>
plastic chickens with anti-child, anti-parent, anti-family messages  <br/>
and sell them.   There&#39;s nothing jello-like about them.  There&#39;s  <br/>
nothing chicken-pecking about them. There&#39;s nothing &quot;to death&quot; about  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if they felt I had pecked them to death, or been wibbly- <br/>
wobbly and inconstant like jello they would be different people now.   <br/>
And I would be a different person.  I would probably have found ways  <br/>
to justify my actions and choices and would laugh at them behind  <br/>
their backs.  Only I didn&#39;t and I don&#39;t.<br/>

===============the quoted passage:================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was on someone&#39;s humor list, and once received a set of anti-child  <br/>
jokes that really offended me. I responded to the list and said  <br/>
something along the lines of what&#39;s above (but very short version),  <br/>
and got three hateful e-mails and lost my friendship. The people on  <br/>
that list were almost all teachers in the public schools, in Salt  <br/>
Lake City. Some of them I know to be childless. I liked that  <br/>
friendship a great deal at one time, but I like my children&#39;s future  <br/>
and my integrity much more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ï¿¼<br/>
On a New Mexico list for homeschoolers I created and maintained for  <br/>
years, someone put up a quote from e-Bay (- great source of  <br/>
quotes- :-/) that said raising a teenager was like nailing jello to a  <br/>
tree. I objected to it, lightly, said I wasn&#39;t having problems with  <br/>
my unschooled teens, and was hooted down by some people insulting me  <br/>
and unschooling. The upshot was I gave the list to someone with  <br/>
thicker skin and newer energy, and I quit the whole list. If on a  <br/>
homeschooling list it&#39;s to be fine to insult those whole people to  <br/>
whom we have supposedly dedicated our lives, there are problems with  <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>

&gt; I LOVE my teens. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was at our local HS group park day the other day, and a mom showed <br/>
up that i hadnt met before. She had a few teens and a younger child <br/>
with her. I thought maybe her kids might be interested similar <br/>
things as my son, so i asked &quot;What do your kids like to do?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Her answer:&quot;Complain.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ummm....ok, thanks that was helpful. I had forgotten that alot of <br/>
people don&#39;t *like* their kids, or if they do secretly like them <br/>
they think its not &quot;cool&quot; in the parenting world to let anyone know. <br/>
Meanwhile, my kid is the only one sitting with us parents, happily <br/>
drawing in his notebook. The other day he said &quot;I&#39;m so happy i&#39;m <br/>
your son. You&#39;re a great mom!&quot; I tell him all the time how glad i am <br/>
that he&#39;s my son. I also like to say nice things about him when he <br/>
can overhear me (to other people, i mean.) <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait for him to be a teenager. I think it will be fun. The <br/>
longer i have a respectful relationship with my son, the more <br/>
bizarre it sounds when people say really rude things about their <br/>
kids in public, to near strangers. And then the poor teens get the <br/>
blame for being disrespectful, for not wanting to spend time with <br/>
their parents, for sneaking around. <br/>
