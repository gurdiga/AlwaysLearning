&gt;Also we were already letting them eat whatever and whenever, and we never <br/>
&gt;made them clean their plates or any of that.  It was when I was pregnant with <br/>
&gt;Holly that we went to Disneyland and hung around with grown childless friends <br/>
&gt;there and ordered pie as soon as we got in the restaurant.  They told us the <br/>
&gt;kids wouldn&#39;t eat other food if they ate pie.  PSHAW!!  They will, we said, <br/>
&gt;and this will keep them happy and we can stay here longer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yep.  They ate pie a while, and then ate chicken and vegetables for dessert!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we go to our favorite all you can eat restaurant, the kids like to <br/>
get ice cream and candy first, then eat all the meat and vegetables <br/>
later. The first time we did this, Bil was telling me I was crazy for <br/>
letting them get that stuff right away, but it worked out fine!<br/>
