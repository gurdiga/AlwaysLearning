There&#39;s the resident NUT, who can rile the list up pretty quick---like she <br/>
did this week telling folks that they should join H$LDA. Sorry, I can&#39;t stay <br/>
quiet about THAT. I also won&#39;t stay quiet about all those unschoolers who use <br/>
curricula or unschool except for math and reading. I WON&#39;T shut up then! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
I myself got a little riled up about book-worship---and that went on for <br/>
DAYS! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry! My keyboard was sending without me meaning for it to! <br/>
Something I was hitting was sending letters off before I was ready. <br/>
And I didn&#39;t even have much to say. After all this, it should be <br/>
something profound! Instead, I was just going to say that Kelly keeps <br/>
the SC list from ever getting boring. Kelly and the resident nut both <br/>
do their parts.<br/>
