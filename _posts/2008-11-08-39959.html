<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142499909">I woke up with these two phrases in my head.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling requires that a parent be engaged and engaging.<br/>
Unschooling requires that a parent be interested and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Probably half the people here figured that out somewhat on their own,  <br/>
or from similar statements made by Pam or Joyce or Deb or someone  <br/>
when they describe what unschoolers DO and not just what they don&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
It ties some things together for me, though, that have been clear in  <br/>
my head but less clear in explanation, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
For years I&#39;ve said &quot;not everyone can unschool,&quot; and people have  <br/>
asked &quot;like who?&quot; and I&#39;ve said some people are too cynical and  <br/>
unwilling to change.<br/>
<br/>
So here, I think, is where the cynicism and pessimism have hooked up  <br/>
to my other concepts.   A person who is negative and unsure things  <br/>
will work (or worse, expresses a belief that things will NOT work)  <br/>
needs to change that before unschooling can thrive.<br/>
<br/>
There is unschooling that barely qualifies, that would maybe pass a  <br/>
test or that someone else would nervously or grudgingly say &quot;Yeah,  <br/>
that&#39;s unschooling...&quot;  maybe thinking &quot;except...&quot; or maybe saying  <br/>
&quot;but you should get them out more&quot; or &quot;but you need to hang out with  <br/>
them and really pay attention to them.&quot;  Then there is unschooling  <br/>
that is undoubtedly alive with its own propulsive intensity and joy.   <br/>
There is unschooling that has momentum and flow.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I was trying to describe in August, on this list, when I  <br/>
wrote the response below<br/>
******************<br/>
&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t figure out how unschoolers do these things if they don&#39;t plan<br/>
to do them or structure the day so there is a time to do them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s like priming a hand-pump (another air pressure/water<br/>
situation)--the first pump gets nothing. The second usually gets  <br/>
nothing.<br/>
Once the water&#39;s in the pipe, though, every touch on the pump handle  <br/>
brings<br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
Or like sourdough bread. Once you have the starter and you keep paying<br/>
attention enough to make more bread every once in a while, &quot;It&#39;s  <br/>
easy.&quot; But<br/>
for those with no starter, it&#39;s not just not easy, it&#39;s not possible.<br/>
(That&#39;s theory. There&#39;s sourdough breadmix now that has the sourdough in<br/>
some kind of powdered and encapsulated form.)<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
It can be hard to get it started, because it takes new kinds of  <br/>
effort and learning and attention on the parents&#39; part.  But if it  <br/>
DOES get started, it will be self-sustaining for short bursts and  <br/>
then longer periods, and eventually the parent(s) can figure out how  <br/>
to do it with less effort.  But if they never do the work to learn  <br/>
how it works and then get it started, it would be like buying a hand  <br/>
pump and leaving it in the box and continuing to ask how it&#39;s  <br/>
supposed to get water out of the ground, or like getting bread  <br/>
starter and never even trying to make any bread.<br/>
<br/>
Yet unschooling is easier than hooking up a water pump or than making  <br/>
sourdough.<br/>
<br/>
People have this list and others; my website and Joyce&#39;s and others;  <br/>
my book and Rue&#39;s and others.   Being in proximity to those things  <br/>
doesn&#39;t help, though.  What helps is being interested enough to take  <br/>
the ideas and use them until you start to understand them, and then  <br/>
replace your old reactions and beliefs with the ideas that will turn  <br/>
you into an unschooler.    Being on a list with other unschoolers  <br/>
isn&#39;t enough.  It won&#39;t happen by osmosis or reflection.<br/>
<br/>
I think now that when people come here and want to be unschooled  <br/>
themselves, they want me to treat them like I treat my children, that  <br/>
they want to have water come out of their pump just because I say I  <br/>
have a pump.  They want to eat homemade bread at their house for  <br/>
having read about other people&#39;s  sourdough bread.<br/>
<br/>
Reading helps.  Thinking helps.  Questions and dialog and discussion  <br/>
can help, but they can&#39;t create unschooling at anyone&#39;s house.  The  <br/>
parent must find ways to be engaged and engaging; interested and  <br/>
interesting; inspired and inspiring.<br/>

<br/>
And when others respond to one as considerate, that will feel good,  <br/>
and consideration might take hold.<br/>
<br/>
When kids respond to a parent&#39;s interesting and engaging actions, it  <br/>
might lead to more authentic and natural and easy engagement and  <br/>
interestingness.  (What  a word, but I have to take Holly out to a  <br/>
doctor&#39;s appointment and maybe a movie.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pam, I think the two statements can work together, but I don&#39;t think  <br/>
someone can really understand or trust unschooling until they see  <br/>
some evidence with their own children, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here has suggestions for tweaking these theories and  <br/>
examples, let&#39;s do it!  If we can summarize what we&#39;ve danced around  <br/>
for years, it will be wonderful.<br/>

i also think learning styles definitely factors in here - some people DO learn, or at least gain the confidence and commitment to try something new  - just by reading lists and talking to others.  Other people need to *see* the &quot;evidence&quot; that it works in their family...or *experience* the feeling of being interesting and engaging....so maybe some reflection on an individual level of how each person changes/learns/adopts new behaviors  - or had in the past with other life changing things - would reveal a path that works on an individual level?  <br/>

<br/>
And if kids are between school sessions, they have *earned* their  <br/>

just &quot;prove&quot; to those families that unschooling doesn&#39;t work.   But  <br/>
anyone whose been through deschooling could tell them it won&#39;t work  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe so, my site and Joyce&#39;s and this list and other providing all  <br/>
of what anyone would need to be prepared to try unschooling no matter  <br/>
what their particular learning style.  It&#39;s their responsibility to  <br/>
figure out how to make it work, not ours to ensure that they get it  <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a book on making fountains.  I&#39;ve seen articles and  <br/>
seen  homemade fountains before, but I just wanted the book because  <br/>
the photos are pretty and it had some great ideas.  It has a page of  <br/>
supplies one might need, with pictures and notes.  We have most of  <br/>
those things, but not all.  I&#39;m interested in getting the rest.  If I  <br/>
can&#39;t figure it out, I&#39;ll go online and look for faqs or  <br/>
discussions.   But it&#39;s not the job of the author of that book to  <br/>
follow me down to the afternoon that I actually try to set up a  <br/>
fountain and make sure it&#39;s working.  And it wouldn&#39;t make sense for  <br/>
me to write to the author (or to complain behind his back) that I  <br/>
have that book and yet I still don&#39;t have a homemade fountain  <br/>
(especially if I didn&#39;t actually buy the supplies or read the book).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s still something missing.  Somehow, for some reason, some  <br/>
people expect unschooling to happen to them magically because they  <br/>
have communicated with unschoolers.  Is it school?  Church?  Social  <br/>
clubs?  What analogy is kicking in inside them that seems to make  <br/>
them angry at experienced unschoolers when they don&#39;t get it going?   <br/>
Partly it could be jealousy.  Partly it could be irritation that  <br/>
there actually is a lot of work involved, and that others ARE  <br/>
expecting them to put up or shut up, to some extent.<br/>

<br/>
See, I got stuck here. It is possible. I&#39;ve done it, no package, no hand-me-over starter, I set a little flour and water trap and in 7 days of coaxing and paying attention I got a sourdough starter (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://waynforth.blogspot.com/2006/04/sourdough-starter-recipe.html)">http://waynforth.blogspot.com/2006/04/sourdough-starter-recipe.html)</a>. I&#39;ve had it for 3 years now. I feed it regularly, I use it regularly, the population lives in my fridge. The flavor has changed as we&#39;ve moved from place to place. There are different yeast in different places. If you buy a San Francisco sourdough starter pack it will change with time to a local yeast population, unless you keep them in a hermetically sealed environment with filtered air...<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s a technicality, but sourdough is possible to create even without the starter. As long as you give yourself the week run up...<br/>

thing.  You can&#39;t absorb unschooling through osmosis or reflection, but<br/>
you can take those ideas to heart and once you really get them, you can<br/>
live them.<br/>

feels extremely daunting.<br/>

<br/>
A friend came over on Wednesday, after the election results were in and she was bummed, not by the election, but by the response that she had gotten from other people when she&#39;d started a conversation about the U.S. election. This morning I was thinking about that cynicism, the cynicism with which her excitement had been met by the Brits she wanted to share with. Maybe part of it is simply that it doesn&#39;t touch that deeply into the British public, they aren&#39;t engaged by the election, even though U.S. politics have deeply affected Britain the entire time I&#39;ve lived here, and I&#39;m sure it has been doing so for a long, long time. Part of it is trying to be funny and smart. I know the person who most disappointed her with his response and he likes to be detached from most things. Cool is important, and cool = cynical from his perspective. Part of it may be that the U.S. system of electing a president may in and of itself produce an excitement that having a<br/>
 prime minister doesn&#39;t do. You don&#39;t elect the prime minister, and, while technically you don&#39;t elect the president, it certainly feels like a greater degree of separation than the U.S. system has. <br/>
<br/>
Elections are exciting to me. I have such optimism in each and every election I&#39;ve watched. When I was a child we had election parties at our house. My dad ran for a few elections and so there was that level of excitment, that sense that change is possible that infused my relationship with elections. Nobody there was cynical. Nobody thought that it didn&#39;t matter who made it to the City Council or the Water board, or which new by-law was passed. There was a real sense that politics could change their world, my world, everybody&#39;s world. And they owned that changed, they walked the miles, they made the fliers, they shook the hands and they researched the routes of change. <br/>
<br/>
It is different here. I can&#39;t vote, I&#39;m not a citizen. I could change that. I could still get involved with things, even without voting. Instead of putting my time into changing the political world however, I&#39;ve volunteered my time to the unschooling world. It has changed my life, and I get really excited about the process and the ideas and the little things that make a difference in mine and Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s and David&#39;s lives. I get excited, too, when I see that change happening in other people&#39;s lives. It can make it hard when somebody seems to want change, but only in theory. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that is clear. I don&#39;t know if that is really what I wanted to say. But Linnaea wants to update her Meez and I&#39;m working on getting Simon&#39;s character on WoW up a few levels before the expansion pack comes out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863031108">I was thinking about your post and Pam&#39;s post, and here is what<br/>
bubbled up for me.  It doesn&#39;t directly address the questions posed,<br/>
but I think it is relevant nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of questions for which the answer is TRUST.  Trust<br/>
that your kids won&#39;t turn into people who play video games during<br/>
their waking hours, eat nothing but sugar, never sleep, etc.  There is<br/>
a lot of encouragement to trust.<br/>
<br/>
Which is good.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of.<br/>
<br/>
The trouble is that it can be misunderstood and turned into an excuse<br/>
for laziness.  I have seen posts on this list and others where people<br/>
think that unschooling isn&#39;t work.  They think that they can set up<br/>
this environment and the kids will just go.  My kids are younger (5<br/>
and 2) so there are a lot of things that they need me to help with<br/>
that they may do on their own later (look things up, reserve books at<br/>
the library, read :).<br/>
<br/>
In my house, I can tell when I am doing a good job and when I am not<br/>
doing such a great job.  When I am stressed, haven&#39;t had enough sleep,<br/>
or I am feeling down, I find that don&#39;t do as good of a job and things<br/>
aren&#39;t as sparkly.  When I am doing a great job following up on<br/>
interests, thinking of new things that my kids would like, being very<br/>
engaged etc. the difference in what the kids are doing and learning is<br/>
visible. It&#39;s wonderful and  sparkly.  It isn&#39;t that way all the time,<br/>
and it isn&#39;t the kids, it is me.  I am trying to work on being<br/>
engaged, interested, and in inspiring even when I am feeling that way,<br/>
but it is something that takes effort.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the fact that so much of the discussion is about trust and<br/>
being respectful that the other HUGE part of it seems to be overlooked<br/>
by people new to unschooling.  So perhaps in the discussions about<br/>
trust, a reminder of the work is important too.  It&#39;s happy work, in<br/>
my mind... but there is a LOT for the parents to do.<br/>
<br/>
This is something the mother of a five year old who was trying to<br/>
unschool said &quot;I wish I could find a way everyone could have their<br/>
needs met and coexist peacefully without me always having to be the<br/>
catalyst. &quot;  This is another bit from this list &quot;One motivation for<br/>
making a change [to unschooling] is that I&#39;m slowing down because I&#39;m<br/>
aging. I turn 62 in December [snip] I love parenting. I&#39;ve loved<br/>
homeschooling. But I&#39;m tired.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Trusting does seem to be hard for a lot of people and I&#39;m sure that<br/>
it&#39;s why it comes up so often.... but somehow the work involved in<br/>
unschooling seems to get overlooked.  Yes, links to the strewing site<br/>
are posted regularly, but I think that sometimes that part of it seems<br/>
small (in terms of what is discussed) and I think that it is easy to<br/>
think that it&#39;s less work than it really is.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t just unschooling lists... people that I know in real life<br/>
(who aren&#39;t unschoolers) think that unschooling is the mom doing<br/>
nothing.  It is dead wrong, but that idea is out there.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, it seems strange to me when people think that unschooling is<br/>
less work.  I think that it would be soooooo much easier to send kids<br/>
to school or to do curriculum out of a box.  I don&#39;t unschool because<br/>
it&#39;s easy, I unschool because it can be sparkly and wonderful and it<br/>
is worth the work.<br/>

&gt; I woke up with these two phrases in my head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling requires that a parent be engaged and engaging.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling requires that a parent be interested and interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Probably half the people here figured that out somewhat on their own,<br/>
&gt; or from similar statements made by Pam or Joyce or Deb or someone<br/>
&gt; when they describe what unschoolers DO and not just what they don&#39;t do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It ties some things together for me, though, that have been clear in<br/>
&gt; my head but less clear in explanation, maybe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For years I&#39;ve said &quot;not everyone can unschool,&quot; and people have<br/>
&gt; asked &quot;like who?&quot; and I&#39;ve said some people are too cynical and<br/>
&gt; unwilling to change.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So here, I think, is where the cynicism and pessimism have hooked up<br/>
&gt; to my other concepts. A person who is negative and unsure things<br/>
&gt; will work (or worse, expresses a belief that things will NOT work)<br/>
&gt; needs to change that before unschooling can thrive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is unschooling that barely qualifies, that would maybe pass a<br/>
&gt; test or that someone else would nervously or grudgingly say &quot;Yeah,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s unschooling...&quot; maybe thinking &quot;except...&quot; or maybe saying<br/>
&gt; &quot;but you should get them out more&quot; or &quot;but you need to hang out with<br/>
&gt; them and really pay attention to them.&quot; Then there is unschooling<br/>
&gt; that is undoubtedly alive with its own propulsive intensity and joy.<br/>
&gt; There is unschooling that has momentum and flow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s what I was trying to describe in August, on this list, when I<br/>
&gt; wrote the response below<br/>
&gt; ******************<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; I can&#39;t figure out how unschoolers do these things if they don&#39;t plan<br/>
&gt; to do them or structure the day so there is a time to do them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s like priming a hand-pump (another air pressure/water<br/>
&gt; situation)--the first pump gets nothing. The second usually gets<br/>
&gt; nothing.<br/>
&gt; Once the water&#39;s in the pipe, though, every touch on the pump handle<br/>
&gt; brings<br/>
&gt; water.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or like sourdough bread. Once you have the starter and you keep paying<br/>
&gt; attention enough to make more bread every once in a while, &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; easy.&quot; But<br/>
&gt; for those with no starter, it&#39;s not just not easy, it&#39;s not possible.<br/>
&gt; (That&#39;s theory. There&#39;s sourdough breadmix now that has the sourdough in<br/>
&gt; some kind of powdered and encapsulated form.)<br/>
&gt; **********************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It can be hard to get it started, because it takes new kinds of<br/>
&gt; effort and learning and attention on the parents&#39; part. But if it<br/>
&gt; DOES get started, it will be self-sustaining for short bursts and<br/>
&gt; then longer periods, and eventually the parent(s) can figure out how<br/>
&gt; to do it with less effort. But if they never do the work to learn<br/>
&gt; how it works and then get it started, it would be like buying a hand<br/>
&gt; pump and leaving it in the box and continuing to ask how it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; supposed to get water out of the ground, or like getting bread<br/>
&gt; starter and never even trying to make any bread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yet unschooling is easier than hooking up a water pump or than making<br/>
&gt; sourdough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People have this list and others; my website and Joyce&#39;s and others;<br/>
&gt; my book and Rue&#39;s and others. Being in proximity to those things<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t help, though. What helps is being interested enough to take<br/>
&gt; the ideas and use them until you start to understand them, and then<br/>
&gt; replace your old reactions and beliefs with the ideas that will turn<br/>
&gt; you into an unschooler. Being on a list with other unschoolers<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t enough. It won&#39;t happen by osmosis or reflection.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think now that when people come here and want to be unschooled<br/>
&gt; themselves, they want me to treat them like I treat my children, that<br/>
&gt; they want to have water come out of their pump just because I say I<br/>
&gt; have a pump. They want to eat homemade bread at their house for<br/>
&gt; having read about other people&#39;s sourdough bread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reading helps. Thinking helps. Questions and dialog and discussion<br/>
&gt; can help, but they can&#39;t create unschooling at anyone&#39;s house. The<br/>
&gt; parent must find ways to be engaged and engaging; interested and<br/>
&gt; interesting; inspired and inspiring.<br/>

kids have never been to school or we have never used a curriculum I <br/>
still approached things with a school mentality to some degree.  For <br/>
the past several months I have let go of alot.  I have tried to think <br/>
alot about why we do this or that and honestly I dont feel our lives <br/>
have been all that interesting or engaging.  But over time I have felt <br/>
myself become interested in things again.  In the last few weeks I <br/>
rented some movies on netflix that I thought I would like. documentarys <br/>
about things I have always been interested in.  I love history but have <br/>
spent so little time pursuing it.  Anyway, my 7 year old sat and <br/>
watched one of them about Explorers in Egypt with me.  He was <br/>
facinated.  When we went to the library I found a couple books on <br/>
Egypt.  Yesterday my 5 year old was asking me about Egyptian writing <br/>
and my 7 year old started telling him about them.  We found a chart in <br/>
one of the books and they wanted to write their name on a clay tablet <br/>
so we used playdo.  Today my 7 year old wanted some popcorn and I was <br/>
trying to get a few bills done and had asked him to wait a few minutes <br/>
while I finished and he came in with a note he had written me in <br/>
hierogriphics (telling me how hungry he was).  We also came across an <br/>
Egytian board game in one of the books and they wanted to play it.  I <br/>
guess I am saying that as I feel myself genuinely interested in more <br/>
things they seem to be waking up too.  As I take more interest in their <br/>
interests, I see them light up.  It takes time, or it has for us, but <br/>
it is happening.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271778553">Hi,<br/>
I would not have had a name for what I do instinctively on a<br/>
day-to-day basis until I found these sites and thought &quot;hey there r<br/>
people like me out there&quot;  :-).  People who just enjoy being with<br/>
their children and just accept them as other people in the family, and<br/>
not as objects to be ordered, directed and patronised.  I think<br/>
accepting that I am not perfect and am still discovering things about<br/>
myself and the world, (a lot of which I am understanding through the<br/>
eyes of my children), has also helped a great deal becos it takes away<br/>
the compulsion to see yourself as the authority.  I have been truly<br/>
astounded at times by the logic and reasoning that flow from the<br/>
mouths of my dd 7 and my ds 4.  We by no means have perfect days, as<br/>
another poster stated, and there are times when I am grumpy and tired<br/>
and not my best.  There are times too when my children feel the same<br/>
way. I alwys try to apologise if I have reacated in a certain way due<br/>
to my feelings on those days and try to understand their reasons for<br/>
their reactions on their &quot;off days&quot;.  I think the process of<br/>
unschooling is about growing together and establishing a relationship<br/>
with your children that sincerely tries to help them become everything<br/>
they have the potential to become, and then being there to pick up the<br/>
pieces and restore them when life doesn&#39;t turn out how they expect it too.<br/>
I have unsure days, but am beginning to realise it is only when I<br/>
begin to compare with others (usually not of an unschooling ilk,<br/>
usually the more structured home-schoolers).<br/>
My dd will never be a jump thru hoops kind of girl and I am beginning<br/>
to see that the way she is being able to interact with her world<br/>
allows her to pick and choose how she wants to progress and develop. <br/>
My ds is a sensitive little chap who had severe excema as a baby.  He<br/>
is over-whelmed easily and I could not imagine him at this time of  <br/>
his life coping with a roomful of other 4 year olds and not being<br/>
labelled as uncoperative and disruptive.  Here at home he can go to<br/>
the supermarket with his dad at 8pm at night, watch a fish being<br/>
gutted (his request), bring it home, give it a name and just sit and<br/>
stroke it.  Have a discussion about fish and how he wouldn&#39;t be able<br/>
to swim in the water now, and then the next day cut open the fish and<br/>
examine it&#39;s back bone, tail and the intracacies(sp?) of its&#39; gills.<br/>
Unschooling for me just sums up life and all it&#39;s fun and sorrows, <br/>
joys and downfalls, kisses and hugs,  chickens in the garden, sleeping<br/>
babies at 9am on a Monday morning when everyone else is rushing to<br/>
work, and running naked in the garden (the children not me) on a hot,<br/>
sunny day without a care in the world when most of the rest of the<br/>
city&#39;s children will be sweating at their desks.<br/>
Gosh.....I&#39;ve just reassured myself in a big way what this life means<br/>
for me and what a life it means to my children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061599214">Yes, that is what I meant :)  I have never tried playing video games<br/>
while asleep.  I suppose you could play some sort game that was<br/>
controlled by what you did in your sleep.  It could sort of like being<br/>
in the Matrix, if you could do it right.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of games, my son (2) was playing Mario Kart on our Wii and he<br/>
had us captivated one morning with his playing and my husband looked<br/>
at me and said something along the lines of &quot;and if he wants to write<br/>
a video game instead of going to swimming, he can.&quot;  His parents made<br/>
him go to hours of swim practice year round  (he wasn&#39;t allowed to<br/>
quit until he went to college) and he couldn&#39;t spend very much time<br/>
during his summers writing video games with his best friend (DH is a<br/>
programmer now, so they didn&#39;t permanently foil him).   I was really<br/>
glad that he could see some of the good in unschooling.  I&#39;m the one<br/>
who reads these boards and he sometimes has doubts and frustrations<br/>
about the way I want us to do things.  It was really nice to see him<br/>
be so happy about unschooling and it&#39;s all because of video games :)<br/>
<br/>
I had a similar happy moment about my mom.  She found a video game<br/>
that she wanted to get my son a video game for Christmas and asked me<br/>
if I thought that he would enjoy it.  I thought that was so cool.  Not<br/>
many grandmothers would buy a video game (a real one intended for fun<br/>
- not an &quot;educational&quot; title) for a two year old.  It made my day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139709537">I was thinking about it to and I couldn&#39;t have done it without information or curiousity or desire. The desire was actually from Simon and Linnaea or for Simon and Linnaea. We went to a friend of my step-dad&#39;s to see her wood stove that she used to bake bread. Simon and Linnaea loved her bread and I wanted to see if I could do something similar. I&#39;m not a big bread fan, but I love giving Simon and Linnaea things that make them smile.  Some of it may be what Jenny wrote: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Always, what helps me, is to turn towards my kids, physically and<br/>
&gt;mentally.  It is really that simple for me.  If my focus is on them<br/>
&gt;instead of the whole host of other things I could be focusing on, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;changed the dynamic.  I can still do other things once my focus has been<br/>
&gt;directed toward them first, but if I do those things without my focus<br/>
&gt;being first on my kids, then they end up not being in the equation. <br/>
&gt;That alone is what allows me to be engaging with them, rather than<br/>
&gt;seperate from them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I spent a lot of yesterday playing on WoW. Linnaea was sitting next to me on this computer and Simon was on the couch on a different computer and David was either in the study, outside working on the car, or in this room watching television. There wasn&#39;t a lot of engagement going on. However, I was working on getting Simon&#39;s main character up in levels and cash and would frequently tell  him where I was and what was going on. Linnaea played on Sims and then worked on her Meez and then on Toontown (which doesn&#39;t have as much available for non paying players as it did a year ago) with Simon and Linnaea and I talking about what she was doing. When they were littler I couldn&#39;t have done that. Simon and I used to sit and play games on the computer together, but Linnaea wanted motion and engagement and being and doing more. She still does. I be and do with them a lot. I enjoy the things I do, I like playing WoW, I like playing with the crocodile dentist with<br/>
 them or going roller skating or building decks to play Yugioh. Actually, there was a lot of engagement going on. There were conversations about the cats and the crocodile dentist was out so a game of risk was going regularly. Pickle was playing with his towel, which got lots of conversation and movement around him. Linnaea had a big decision to make about whether she wanted an energy drink at 7 at night. I gave her my opinion and Simon enticed her to stay up late with him. In the end she decided that she didn&#39;t want to not be able to go to sleep when she wanted to. She did stay up pretty late. I don&#39;t know when she came to bed, she still wants me to sleep with her, but she read in bed for a while before turning off the light when it began to disturb my sleep too much. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes a near constant willingness to be interested in whatever is going on. It doesn&#39;t mean withholding judgement, but it may mean delaying it, giving something a go and not dismissing it out of hand. I really like that aspect of unschooling. I really like having &quot;willing to give it a go&quot; as part of my job description. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-294593727">I&#39;m new to the group, but have been avidly reading this list and the Radical Unschooling <br/>
site.  I see Sandra&#39;s phrase &#39;engaged and engaging; interested and interesting&#39; as the day-<br/>
to-day physical living out of the philosophical principles Pam mentioned:<br/>
<br/>
===(What is really interesting to me is that I just told people almost the<br/>
===opposite the other day when I said that they need to focus on<br/>
===understanding the basic reasons for and principles of unschooling -<br/>
===that if they really grasp those, they won&#39;t have to decide whether or<br/>
===not to unschool, they won&#39;t have to &quot;pick&quot; unschooling like they pick<br/>
===a new curriculum, it will be the only thing that makes sense to do,<br/>
===the only way they feel comfortable living.)<br/>
<br/>
As my 2 daughters are still young (nearly 4 & 16 months), my approach to unschooling <br/>
has been from theory to practice.  A friend introduced me to the writing of John Holt and <br/>
John Taylor Gatto, I then found Sandra&#39;s Radical Unschooling site, and have never looked <br/>
back. I have started to condense all this reading into principles which I then use every day <br/>
to make my behaviour more peaceful and loving and dynamic:<br/>
<br/>
- my kids learn from my example<br/>
- my mothering instincts can be trusted<br/>
- I am guided by my love for my children<br/>
- unschooling is a continuum that can last a lifetime<br/>
- hard work in the early years is repaid many times over<br/>
- I am fallible just like everyone else but openness and reflection can help me not to repeat <br/>
mistakes<br/>
<br/>
I think for unschooling to work there needs to be a unity of theory and practice - both a <br/>
well thought-out philosophical framework and an ability to bring those principles to bear <br/>
on a daily stream of ever-changing scenarios.  For this to be possible I think one of the <br/>
main things required is time - time to read, to mull over what you read, and then time <br/>
during the whirl of the day to take a breath, stop the controlling reactions and draw forth <br/>
your loving, patient, engaged and interesting self.  Each day, in little steps, I am doing this <br/>
and already I can see that our home is more peaceful and our relationships more loving.<br/>
<br/>
The hard work of unschooling comes not only from the day to day engagement with kids&#39; <br/>
learning, but also (and this may be too big a hurdle for some) because ultimately <br/>
unschooling asks us to confront the question &#39;What kind of person am I?&#39;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506791257">I have been TRULY unschooling for about one month now. My 12 year old daughter came out of the blue and said she wanted to do some math. She is doing it in small increments when she feels like it. I am glad, I was apprehensive at first. I am so glad I let go of all the stress and worry from trying to force curriculum on my kids. We watch tv, play games, go on Myspace, and the park. My kids are pretty smart, and very energetic. They seem so happy now. I&#39;m so glad I found out about unschooling. And I only have one other family here that unschools. The rest of the mothers seem a bit holier than thou, but it &#39;s alright. I like the park days.<br/>

Claire, thanks for this!  I think it&#39;s that talk of the state and  <br/>
nature of &quot;being&quot; that makes people so nervous.  Talking about the  <br/>
way they are is like religion or philosophy.  It&#39;s on the spiritual  <br/>
level, and it&#39;s hard to get to unschooling without going through  <br/>
there somehow.  I&#39;ve seen some people try it for years, and their  <br/>
kids aren&#39;t as happy and centered as some others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

toys, washed dishes, helped in beading projects, got out origami and<br/>
explored a lot of paper projects online, like paper bangers and<br/>

<br/>
I was constantly available to both my kids who were in seperate rooms<br/>
because neither of them felt good and couldn&#39;t agree on what to watch on<br/>
TV and didn&#39;t want to share the couch.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, it&#39;s not so different from any other day, which I&#39;m<br/>
constantly available, just maybe less hop to, since they will do stuff<br/>
on their own accord knowing that I will help them get what they want if<br/>

That is exactly It!  I never would have been involved in a Halloween<br/>

it.  That is the case a lot.  One of my kids has an idea and rather than<br/>
dismissing it or finding reasons to NOT do it, we encourage it and find<br/>
ways TO do it.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Chamille wants us out of the house so that she can do some video<br/>
making thing with a friend.  John and I are taking Margaux to a movie to<br/>
make it happen.  When I was a kid, that never would have been considered<br/>
a valid request, I would have been made to feel selfish if I&#39;d even been<br/>
brave enough to ask in the first place.  In fact, the dynamic of my<br/>
house, as a kid, being what it was, I probably wouldn&#39;t have even<br/>
considered this in the first place.  The idea of it wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
occured to me.  This is a big difference that I see in Chamille, her<br/>
thinking isn&#39;t defined by parental parameters in that manner, she thinks<br/>
big and offers suggestions that never would have occured to me.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can cause &quot;in the box&quot; thinking or &quot;in the parent approved box&quot;<br/>
thinking.  It stifles creative thinking and the generation and flow of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yeah, i have also had some experiences of what i would consider &quot;thinking small&quot; leading to a snowballing of experiences - in the &quot;if you give a moose a muffin&quot; tradition.  but none of it would have happened without responsiveness, and engagement on my part - which i am just recently really recognizing and developing...<br/>
<br/>
for example, thursday night, i was showing my son (10) a web site of wolf haven, because i had just proposed going on a road trip with my kids there next week, when my husband is out of town.  his first response was &quot;no&quot; (very common for him) but he was open to the notion of just going for the experience/adventure, even if the destination itself doesn&#39;t turn out to be facinating for him.  so i was showing him some of hte sights we could see/experience along the way, and one was a cider press/farm.  on that page, we saw a lovely color photo of fresh baked cinnamon rolls, which inspired a deep desire for one!  i overcame my initial &quot;it&#39;s dark, late, i don&#39;t want to go to the store just for that&quot; feeling&quot; and took him.  he was elated, and remarked on the way out the door how nice i was to do so.<br/>
<br/>
once there, i was looking in the baking aisle for citric acid to make bath bombs, and he saw the cake decorating supplies.  it reminded him of a cake workshop he&#39;d been involved in a few years back in school, and he said &quot;i want to make a cake&quot;<br/>
<br/>
he has been at loose ends/bored/restless for a while so this was really cool, for him to choose something that inspired him.  we got supplies.  <br/>
<br/>
the next day he was ready to make the cake, and we did - he did almost all of it himself, and  was happy and easygoing about it (another accomplishment for him, as he tends to be very intense and easily stressed by collaborative work or focused projects that encounter snafoos or might.)<br/>
<br/>
it came out great, and he was delighted with it.  the final development from this experience was that he had been struggling with anxiety and stress around what he wanted to do for a unschoolers children&#39;s market event i am coordinating - and had decided it was too much for him and he would just be a customer and not have a booth.  after the cake experience, i suggested that maybe he&#39;d want to bake a cake and raffle it off and that was a VERY exciting idea for him - so now he has a plan for that as well.<br/>
<br/>
so - a hankering for a cinnamon roll turned into a processional of experiences that contributed to his joy, learning, confidence, and peace!<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we&#39;re talking about something people have never talked about  <br/>
&gt; before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes--I think this is the crux of it right here.  I believe that the ethic that we as adults need <br/>
to make decisions for our children is so strong that that is what stands in the way of <br/>
people getting unschooling.  I think this is also why many people who are truly trying to <br/>
find partnership parenting, in trying to dislodge this thought from their brains, do the only <br/>
alternative that makes any sense at first, which is to then try to have the child make all the <br/>
decisions instead. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about still figuring out who will have control.  When still in this paradigm, it seems like <br/>
power can&#39;t really be shared--someone must have 51%.  So they try giving the 51% to their <br/>
child.  I moved through a phase like this, and eventually I figured out how to move out of it <br/>
altogether, but I personally had to experience what it was like for me to give up &quot;control&quot;  <br/>
to a child in order to find how to work together.  Our cultural ideas about parenting are so <br/>
incredibly hierarchical that I think it&#39;s hard for people to see their way around it without <br/>
first running smack into it.  Because we were all raised to be controlled in some way by <br/>
our parents.  We all know how to be controlling or helpless, but not how to work in <br/>
partnership with a child.<br/>
<br/>
I think many people get stuck in that dynamic, in either trying to make it work or feeling <br/>
that this isn&#39;t right either and give up.  Partnering with our children is just not a reality that <br/>
most people have ever seen or heard of--it is a really different mindset that isn&#39;t <br/>
supported or modeled anywhere, except perhaps attachment parenting (I don&#39;t know for <br/>
sure because I didn&#39;t know about that until it was too late).<br/>

I think people try to do the &quot;stuff&quot; of unschooling and then call it unschooling even though <br/>
that isn&#39;t really it, because they either don&#39;t understand about the real shift that needs to <br/>
happen, or they just can&#39;t go there.<br/>
<br/>
People who want to find this new place are all looking for a road map, but the destination <br/>
is hidden until you get there.  I think that those of us who are involved in trying to help <br/>
other people find it are trying to find ways to better describe the destination.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775669698"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What is really interesting to me is that I just told people almost the  <br/>
&gt; opposite the other day when I said that they need to focus on  <br/>
&gt; understanding the basic reasons for and principles of unschooling -  <br/>
&gt; that if they really grasp those, they won&#39;t have to decide whether or  <br/>
&gt; not to unschool, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think part of it is that grasping &quot;principles&quot; wrt parenting has<br/>
often (historically?) been about acquiring a set of skills and tools<br/>
to, e.g., achieve discipline, or teach sharing, or something specific<br/>
(in mainstream parenting books etc.).  And maybe people are in the<br/>
habit/custom of instituting a principle as if it were a timeout or a<br/>
gold star.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s difficult for some of us to understand principles in the<br/>
broader context of a life changing, fundamental, who am I at heart<br/>
kind of thing.  We have so long been trying to bend the spoon.<br/>
<br/>
We juxtapose principles with rules and make simple differentiations to<br/>
replace the other with the one.  I think this may sometimes downplay<br/>
the magnitude of the shift required.  It&#39;s difficult to see that you<br/>
have to step into a whole new paradigm, *system* of thought; very much<br/>
like the Matrix, you didn&#39;t imagine it could be like that.  You have<br/>
to realize that the spoon doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
And then you realize that *being* interesting is indeed a principle. <br/>
It&#39;s about embracing LIFE, being alive, every minute, because you love<br/>
it and it&#39;s worth doing.  And that any other choice that involves your<br/>
kids feels very near to choosing death.<br/>
<br/>
And when you see that, this is true:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they won&#39;t have to &quot;pick&quot; unschooling like they pick  <br/>
&gt; a new curriculum, it will be the only thing that makes sense to do,  <br/>
&gt; the only way they feel comfortable living.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, Pam and Sandra both describe the process clearly.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe this is easier to do based on certain circumstances.  When the<br/>
concept of unschooling, or perhaps whole life learning, occurs to<br/>
people who have recently been shocked with the life-changing<br/>
experience of becoming a parent; maybe they are more ripe for the<br/>
unschooling Change.  When you come to unschooling because schooling<br/>
and then homeschooling wasn&#39;t working for you, you may be more likely<br/>
to be gradually acquiring more and more sophisticated &quot;tools&quot;.  Yet<br/>
not really seeing (or wanting to see) the whole new world order, so to<br/>
speak.)<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that for many of us, being interesting has been<br/>
dangerous.  You know, the whole school thing and all.  I had a Russian<br/>
friend in college who would say to me, &quot;So, Jaayyne, telll me, what do<br/>
you think?&quot;  And so often my answer would be, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Jaayynne, what do you waant to do?&quot;   &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Eventually he<br/>
would just say it for me, &quot;I know, I know: you donnn&#39;t knooowww&quot;,<br/>
teasing me.  I would get incredibly frustrated and refuse to hang out<br/>
with him for a while because he was so rude and snobbish.  He simply<br/>
valued interesting conversation and I was seriously lacking, afraid to<br/>
voice any thought or idea at all.  It&#39;s taken me *years* to get to a<br/>
point where I value and know what *I* like.  This seems pretty common<br/>
to me.  And maybe this is the part that can actually be too difficult<br/>
to overcome or change.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is my first post here.  Hello!  I have seen many of your<br/>
names on other lists and on the RUN.  I doubt I&#39;ll be posting much<br/>
here.  I just wanted to lurk and learn but I thought I might have<br/>
something useful to contribute on this thread.  I&#39;m mom to two bio<br/>
daughters, Selena and Samantha (4 and 2) and two step daughters,<br/>
Kelsey and Abbie (17 and 14).  I&#39;m married to Dean and we live in<br/>
Massachusetts.<br/>
