A thoughtful memorial to Fred Rogers.<br/>

<br/>
In Fred Rogers&#39; neighborhood of make-believe, King Friday befriended a<br/>
bird named Troglodytes Aedon (the scientific name of the House Wren). <br/>
Mr. Rogers loved and appreciated birds as well as children.  On my radio<br/>
program today, I did a little tribute to him.  Here&#39;s a link to the<br/>
script if anyone is interested.<br/>

There is symbolic as well as actual beauty in the migration of the birdsÂ…<br/>
 There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of<br/>
nature-the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after the<br/>
winter.<br/>
