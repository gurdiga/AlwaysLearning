<div id="ygrps-yiv-398485430">We didn&#39;t win any money, but a clip I sent to America&#39;s Funniest Home<br/>
Videos is airing this Sunday :-)  It&#39;s of Sly, one of the horses at<br/>
Partners Therapeutic Riding Center, where I volunteer. It<br/>
should be in the &quot;What&#39;s that Sound&quot; segment; I won&#39;t spoil it by<br/>

<br/>
Will it be available online afterwards?  It wounds my soul to watch  <br/>
that show because of the meanness and derision in so many of the  <br/>
videos.  I don&#39;t like to see people wounded.    So maybe Monday could  <br/>
you tell us more what it was about, and maybe let us know if the clip  <br/>
will be on hulu or youtube or some such?  Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had to sign documents that stated I had not uploaded the video to  <br/>
any public sites beforehand; I&#39;ve sent an email to my contact with the  <br/>
show to ask if it&#39;s okay to do so now that it has aired.  I&#39;ll let you  <br/>
know :-)<br/>

the camera, stuck his nose at it, then turned a suspicious eye its  <br/>
direction.  Oh well.<br/>
