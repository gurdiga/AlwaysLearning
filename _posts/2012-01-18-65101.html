<div id="ygrps-yiv-483629976">As part of her European tour, Sandra will be coming to France in June. We<br/>
are organising a 3 day get together somewhere close to Geneva, but most<br/>
probably in France. We are looking for a place before we can finalise the<br/>
exact dates.<br/>
<br/>
And to find a place, we need to evaluate how many people are thinking of<br/>
coming. To help us with that, we have created a little online survey. If<br/>
you&#39;re interested in coming, please fill in the survey as soon as possible:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=fr&formkey=dHJiWmNqZWpmM3VoYk5PNWsxQWR1SGc6MQ#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=fr&formkey=dHJiWmNqZWpmM3VoYk5PNWsxQWR1SGc6MQ#gid=0</a><br/>
<br/>
Filling the survey is NOT A RESERVATION. It&#39;s just intended to help us<br/>
evaluate how big a place we need. We will handle reservations/registrations<br/>
when the dates are finalised and the cost is known.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, email me in private at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:claire@...">claire@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Claire<br/>

&gt; for news and announcements of that here (or just to look at the blog to see<br/>
&gt; the photos as they come up in those days).<br/>
