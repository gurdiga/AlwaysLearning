School with no rules is forced to lay down law because of spoilt pupils<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By Richard Garner, Education Editor<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Published: 03 June 2006<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For years, Summerhill, the &quot;free&quot; school founded by the philosopher A S<br/>
Neill in the 1920s, gained notoriety for its pupils skipping lessons,<br/>
outdoor bathing in the nude and voting for their own school rules. It <br/>
was,<br/>
in fact, the very epitome of the kind of liberal progressive school so<br/>
frowned upon by education traditionalists such as Chris Woodhead, the <br/>
former<br/>
schools inspector.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in a new book, its current head, Zoe Neill Redhead, the founder&#39;s<br/>
daughter, reveals the school is having to adopt a more disciplinarian <br/>
tone<br/>
towards its current pupils, who have been so pampered by their parents, <br/>
she<br/>
says, that they no longer know the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We see the results of parental interference and over-indulgence all the<br/>
time,&quot; she says in the book Summerhill and A S Neill, previewed in this<br/>
week&#39;s Times Educational Supplement and published by the Open <br/>
University.<br/>
&quot;In modern society, parents seem to be unable to leave their kids alone <br/>
for<br/>
more than a short while. At Summerhill, we now see many children who <br/>
are in<br/>
constant search of adult influence and stimulation, unable to quietly <br/>
get<br/>
along with their own lives without the need for admiration and <br/>
attention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The result has been that - while the school still adopts its liberal<br/>
approach with pupils able to make their own rules - it has had also to <br/>
adopt<br/>
the role of a disciplinarian towards them, because they know no rules. <br/>
In<br/>
Mrs Neill Redhead&#39;s words, it has had to start &quot;teaching kids that they<br/>
can&#39;t do what they like, that they have to have regard to other people&#39;s<br/>
rights and feelings - a bit of a role reversal that Neill would have <br/>
found<br/>
interesting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The philosophy of Summerhill, which is in Leiston in Suffolk, has always<br/>
been that the individual has control over his or her own life. Hence the<br/>
policy that pupils are allowed to decide for themselves which lessons <br/>
they<br/>
want to attend - a policy criticised by Ofsted, the education standards<br/>
watchdog, in the late Nineties, which led the then education secretary <br/>
David<br/>
Blunkett issuing a notice of complaint against the school which could <br/>
have<br/>
led to its closure.<br/>
<br/>
He was insistent that pupils should be compelled to attend lessons - but<br/>
ultimately lost a court battle with the school.<br/>
<br/>
So Summerhill continued with its ideal that &quot;you don&#39;t have to be <br/>
answerable<br/>
to your parents or any adult; you can just get on with your life and <br/>
learn<br/>
or make mistakes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can be lonely, you can be bored, you can take risks, you can be <br/>
really<br/>
nice or you can be quite horrible,&quot; says Mrs Neill Redhead. &quot;So long as <br/>
what<br/>
you do doesn&#39;t upset or hurt anybody else, you can be completely <br/>
yourself.&quot;<br/>
Unfortunately, she argues, this philosophy does not fit in with modern<br/>
parenting. &quot;The new parenting trend makes parents feel they have to be <br/>
part<br/>
of their children&#39;s childhood at every turn,&quot; she writes. &quot;Parents rush <br/>
home<br/>
 from work or pick up the children from school and are immediately <br/>
involved<br/>
in the pattern of providing a stimulating environment for the children. <br/>
We<br/>
must not let them watch too much television, play computer games or play<br/>
outside in the street ... Talk to them at home and make sure that we are<br/>
always on hand to inspire and encourage them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This in itself causes many tensions within the family for the obvious<br/>
reason that parents find it extremely difficult and tiring to provide <br/>
this<br/>
constant stream of enthusiasm and that the children are more often that <br/>
not<br/>
reluctant participants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for Summerhill, it is thriving again with 84 pupils (its average was <br/>
60<br/>
while A S Neill was head), after winning its legal showdown with the<br/>
Government.<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
True.<br/>
<br/>
I think about that sometimes, in an unschooling context.  Sometimes  <br/>
in the past detractors of mine have said &quot;You think you can tell  <br/>
people whether they can unschool.&quot;  They misunderstand deeply.  There  <br/>
are people who can&#39;t successfully unschool, but it has nothing to do  <br/>
with the opinions, approval or permission of others.  They wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be able to unschool even if I&#39;d never been born, or never had kids,  <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Some people aren&#39;t energetic or creative or desirous enough to do it.<br/>
<br/>
But when it comes to the social end of parenting, the nature vs.  <br/>
nurture part is very problematical.  If parents aren&#39;t filled with  <br/>
interpersonal intelligence, and their children are genetically  <br/>
likewise unendowed, how will the children get the clues they need to  <br/>
deal with other people?<br/>
<br/>
School?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there&#39;s a teacher who&#39;s able to help kids understand some  <br/>
social realities.  My 4th grade teacher was really good at  <br/>
relationship counseling on a casual level.  She noticed if best  <br/>
friends were mad at each other, or if someone was being harrassed,  <br/>
and would give subtle suggestions to both parties to help them move  <br/>
toward more peaceful stuck-in-the-same-classroom co-existence.<br/>
<br/>
More often, schoolKIDS &quot;teach&quot; other kids how to act, or how not to  <br/>
act.   In some cases that might be better than nothing at all, if the  <br/>
family of origin was able to provide exactly &quot;nothing at all.&quot;  It&#39;s  <br/>
cruel and can be painful, though.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I have watched the first season of Desperate Housewives  <br/>
this week.  I&#39;m nearly through and she has a couple of bonus bits to  <br/>
watch.  That&#39;s the most intense watching she&#39;s ever done and the most  <br/>
I&#39;ve done since The Two Towers DVDs came out.  It&#39;s a lot at once,  <br/>
which is kind of fun.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a situation in which Lynette leaves all her kids with Bree  <br/>
suddenly, after all others turned her down.  Bree was saying no, but  <br/>
she relented.  Those kids are played as horror kids sometimes, for  <br/>
the effect.  Bree spanked one, for dumping a tray of homemade cookies  <br/>
all over the floor after she had told him no, and wait, and that she  <br/>
would give him cookies when they were cool.  He kept going back, and  <br/>
then the whole pan and cookies were on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Lynette was furious because Bree spanked, but Lynette&#39;s tool was &quot;I  <br/>
will spank you&quot; and she never did (admittedly).  So the next time she  <br/>
was really angry with her kids, she threatened to take them to Bree&#39;s  <br/>
house for a spanking. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But my rambling point is that at some level if parents are unable to  <br/>
learn at home how to be considerate of others, and to take &quot;no&quot; for  <br/>
an answer about other people&#39;s personal stuff and boundaries, their  <br/>
children will have to learn that somewhere else.  The idea that  <br/>
parents whose kids weren&#39;t good at interpersonals would leave their  <br/>
kids at a boarding school (no matter how &quot;free&quot; the curriculum) is  <br/>
probably the very issue central to that article.<br/>
<br/>
So I retract my previous defense, because I suppose it is possible  <br/>
for parents to be with their children SO much that the kids never  <br/>
have an opportunity to see whether they can get along with other  <br/>
people, and make social decisions without looking at their mom for  <br/>
direction or approval.  And a level lower is those who look to a mom  <br/>
for approval and she approves EVERYTHING, no matter how wrong or bad,  <br/>
and then simple gets angry at the other people for not allowing the  <br/>
inappropriate behavior.<br/>
<br/>
And since I&#39;ve already written a friggin&#39; book here, I will close  <br/>
with a recent success story.   Yesterday two of Marty&#39;s friends were  <br/>
going to pick him up to go run around, but they ended up staying  <br/>
here.  Then another friend came over to see all my kids.  Then a  <br/>
friend of Kirby&#39;s from work came over.  I hadn&#39;t met her before.  She  <br/>
was nice.  So my three (14, 17, 19) plus four more (17-21) were all  <br/>
having a great time laughing and looking at stuff on Kirby&#39;s computer  <br/>
and around our house, and Marty&#39;s big Lego Viking village, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
They decided to go out for ice cream and then to see &quot;Over the  <br/>
Hedge.&quot;  I asked Holly if she needed money, and she didn&#39;t.  (She  <br/>
saves her allowance up.)  Every other person there has a job.   <br/>
Outside of Kirby possibly having an interest in the girl from work,  <br/>
there were no couples.  Two of those kids do have steady others, but  <br/>
didn&#39;t bring them over.  So it was four teenaged girls, four teenaged  <br/>
boys, no romantic tension (unless Kirby and new-girl; didn&#39;t see any).<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s the big success part.  They asked Keith if he wanted to  <br/>
go.  I didn&#39;t know they had, when Marty came and asked me if I wanted  <br/>
to go.  So they would have taken me, or Keith, or both of us, with them.<br/>
<br/>
We separately thanked them and declined and found out later they had  <br/>
asked us both.  Pretty sweet!<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t &quot;teach them&quot; to invite their parents to the movies.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
One advantage of our not going was that then they could fit into the  <br/>
big van and didn&#39;t have to take two cars.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey - I DID go to the movies with a bunch of teenagers on Friday  <br/>
night. A late show - started at 10:30 - by the time we saw it and  <br/>
stood around in the parking lot and talked about it for a while, it  <br/>
was 2 am when we got home.<br/>
<br/>
It was 8 boys ages 16 to 20, my 15 yo daughter, and me. Breakdown -  <br/>
two other radical unschoolers, two pretty relaxed homeschoolers, one  <br/>
school-at-home homeschooler, one who goes to public school, one who  <br/>
graduated from high school, one who got himself out of high school  <br/>
and is taking back his own life - after getting to know unschoolers.   <br/>
They mostly know each other through their karate studio. We went out  <br/>
for ice cream, first, then we went to see Mission Impossible. I hung  <br/>
out with them easily, naturally, and didn&#39;t give it much thought  <br/>
except I do remember saying to one of them that it had suddenly  <br/>
occurred to me that this was a really unusual group of kids who  <br/>
didn&#39;t think twice about including a mom in their Friday night out  <br/>
plans and that I was really lucky to know them. There were two other  <br/>
adults who I thought might go along, too, but didn&#39;t. And there was  <br/>
another mom and her son who had ice cream with us, but didn&#39;t go to  <br/>
the movie. Maybe I&#39;m deluding myself, but I honestly think they like  <br/>
me just fine and it never even occurred to them that it was in any  <br/>
way odd for me to go with them. I was there when plans were being  <br/>
made and was included very naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Now - the other unusual thing was the 8 boys to 1 girl ratio, among  <br/>
the teens, I guess. but that is not unusual for my daughter - she has  <br/>
some girlfriends and has overnighters with them and hangs out some  <br/>
with them, but most of her close friends are boys.  There was another  <br/>
girl who had been with them earlier in the evening, at the karate  <br/>
studio, and we thought she was going, and also a sister of one of the  <br/>
boys was planning to go and then backed out. My other daughter was  <br/>
planning to go - I was actually on my way to pick her up and she  <br/>
called and said she&#39;d gotten hooked on watching recorded episodes of  <br/>
LOST, so she&#39;d changed her mind.<br/>
<br/>
So - two back-to-back stories of movies and teens and parents being  <br/>
invited/included. Cool!<br/>
<br/>
By the way - it was really good to see Mission Impossible with a  <br/>
bunch of teenage boys - they LOVED it - they were all charged up by  <br/>
it, lots of adrenaline - made it that much more fun for me, just  <br/>
observing their reactions to it.<br/>

I went to see Troy with six or seven teenaged boys, a midnight  <br/>
showing.  They liked it in ways I wouldn&#39;t have thought to like it.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  It was more fun for being with them.  Bummer it wasn&#39;t a better  <br/>

But does that fit us into the category of parents who are with their  <br/>
kids so much that when the kids go to Summerhill they don&#39;t know how  <br/>
to behave?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
[I know... there are WAY too many factors to simplify it, and it&#39;s  <br/>
also very possible that the deterioration of Summerhill has nothing  <br/>
at all to do with parental practices, but simply with the loss of a  <br/>
cult-of-personality situation.   Many projects depend on the  <br/>
founder&#39;s knowledge and energy and commitment to work longterm.   <br/>

<br/>
  To me it&#39;s not so much about being with the kids too much as it is <br/>
about being with the kids and not caring, not guiding. Not helping them <br/>
to understand others&#39; personal boundaries and what&#39;s socially <br/>
acceptable in different situations.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve had a couple of discussions lately at UnschoolingBasics about <br/>
&quot;unparenting&quot;---Deb Lewis (as usual) made some really good points. Ren <br/>
and I talked about it a bit before/during/after the NE Unschooling <br/>
Conference.<br/>
<br/>
  Freedom&#39;s great, but it needs to be tempered with direction. We&#39;re not <br/>
necessarily seeing that as much as I would like (especially in my role <br/>
as conference coordinator! &lt;G&gt;). I don&#39;t want to see kids held by the <br/>
hand and escorted everywhere and screamed at not to touch. But at the <br/>
same time the &quot;wild monkeys&quot; aren&#39;t my cup of tea either.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the wild monkey atmosphere at Summerhill that is <br/>
causing the problems: the children haven&#39;t been guided at all---just <br/>
let loose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987763476">Yeah it&#39;s like that with us too. Our kids actually like us and enjoy our<br/>
company. The feeling is mutual of course, which is just as unusual in our<br/>
society. I&#39;ve learned, since I&#39;ve been unschooling that teens are great<br/>
people, not the inevitably angry, confrontational, unhappy people I used to<br/>
think they were. My teens still go through some difficult stuff about<br/>
finding their way in the world, but having a good relationship with them<br/>
allows for communication and real help and support.<br/>
<br/>
I used to feel so powerless and scared when my first 2 kids (now 24 & 22)<br/>
were teenagers. I just hung in there and waited for it to be over! Now I<br/>
have 3 teens (17, 16 & 13) and life is sweet! I&#39;m starting to organise<br/>
activities for teens in our homeschool group, with the kids choosing what<br/>
they want to do. And they all want the adults to join in. Super cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761040954">When I first read Summerhill I thought it sounded great. but almost straight away I got an irky feeling about the whole thing. Neill set up a free school and that&#39;s fantastic in an &#39;education&#39; based society but how disconnecting it is for the family unit? Send them off to boarding school! I can&#39;t see that there&#39;s anything good about that. Educating parents about a better way to parent and a better way for harmonious living is surely a better thing to do. Then educate them about education and schools and how unschooling is a way of life and a peaceful, joyful existence.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of parents send their children away to school? They must already be so disconnected - damage then is already done to these children.<br/>
<br/>
Just my slant on Summerhill. I just don&#39; t think it&#39;s ever been all it&#39;s cracked up to be.<br/>

  School with no rules is forced to lay down law because of spoilt pupils<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  By Richard Garner, Education Editor<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Published: 03 June 2006<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  For years, Summerhill, the &quot;free&quot; school founded by the philosopher A S<br/>
  Neill in the 1920s, gained notoriety for its pupils skipping lessons,<br/>
  outdoor bathing in the nude and voting for their own school rules. It <br/>
  was,<br/>
  in fact, the very epitome of the kind of liberal progressive school so<br/>
  frowned upon by education traditionalists such as Chris Woodhead, the <br/>
  former<br/>
  schools inspector.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, in a new book, its current head, Zoe Neill Redhead, the founder&#39;s<br/>
  daughter, reveals the school is having to adopt a more disciplinarian <br/>
  tone<br/>
  towards its current pupils, who have been so pampered by their parents, <br/>
  she<br/>
  says, that they no longer know the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;We see the results of parental interference and over-indulgence all the<br/>
  time,&quot; she says in the book Summerhill and A S Neill, previewed in this<br/>
  week&#39;s Times Educational Supplement and published by the Open <br/>
  University.<br/>
  &quot;In modern society, parents seem to be unable to leave their kids alone <br/>
  for<br/>
  more than a short while. At Summerhill, we now see many children who <br/>
  are in<br/>
  constant search of adult influence and stimulation, unable to quietly <br/>
  get<br/>
  along with their own lives without the need for admiration and <br/>
  attention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  The result has been that - while the school still adopts its liberal<br/>
  approach with pupils able to make their own rules - it has had also to <br/>
  adopt<br/>
  the role of a disciplinarian towards them, because they know no rules. <br/>
  In<br/>
  Mrs Neill Redhead&#39;s words, it has had to start &quot;teaching kids that they<br/>
  can&#39;t do what they like, that they have to have regard to other people&#39;s<br/>
  rights and feelings - a bit of a role reversal that Neill would have <br/>
  found<br/>
  interesting&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  The philosophy of Summerhill, which is in Leiston in Suffolk, has always<br/>
  been that the individual has control over his or her own life. Hence the<br/>
  policy that pupils are allowed to decide for themselves which lessons <br/>
  they<br/>
  want to attend - a policy criticised by Ofsted, the education standards<br/>
  watchdog, in the late Nineties, which led the then education secretary <br/>
  David<br/>
  Blunkett issuing a notice of complaint against the school which could <br/>
  have<br/>
  led to its closure.<br/>
<br/>
  He was insistent that pupils should be compelled to attend lessons - but<br/>
  ultimately lost a court battle with the school.<br/>
<br/>
  So Summerhill continued with its ideal that &quot;you don&#39;t have to be <br/>
  answerable<br/>
  to your parents or any adult; you can just get on with your life and <br/>
  learn<br/>
  or make mistakes&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;You can be lonely, you can be bored, you can take risks, you can be <br/>
  really<br/>
  nice or you can be quite horrible,&quot; says Mrs Neill Redhead. &quot;So long as <br/>
  what<br/>
  you do doesn&#39;t upset or hurt anybody else, you can be completely <br/>
  yourself.&quot;<br/>
  Unfortunately, she argues, this philosophy does not fit in with modern<br/>
  parenting. &quot;The new parenting trend makes parents feel they have to be <br/>
  part<br/>
  of their children&#39;s childhood at every turn,&quot; she writes. &quot;Parents rush <br/>
  home<br/>
  from work or pick up the children from school and are immediately <br/>
  involved<br/>
  in the pattern of providing a stimulating environment for the children. <br/>
  We<br/>
  must not let them watch too much television, play computer games or play<br/>
  outside in the street ... Talk to them at home and make sure that we are<br/>
  always on hand to inspire and encourage them.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;This in itself causes many tensions within the family for the obvious<br/>
  reason that parents find it extremely difficult and tiring to provide <br/>
  this<br/>
  constant stream of enthusiasm and that the children are more often that <br/>
  not<br/>
  reluctant participants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  As for Summerhill, it is thriving again with 84 pupils (its average was <br/>
  60<br/>
  while A S Neill was head), after winning its legal showdown with the<br/>
  Government.<br/>

Continuum Concept.    She said that sometimes, parents seem to go too far <br/>
and become child-centred to the point where the child gets the feeling that <br/>
the parents are expecting him to lead<br/>

<br/>
I also think that kids who are shuttled from one thing to another -- ALWAYS <br/>
adult-directed and managed -- don&#39;t learn to use their own resources.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to put into words without sounding like I&#39;m advocating <br/>
parent selfishness, but I can see it when it&#39;s happening either in my family <br/>
or in other families -- when the child is feeling stifled and panicky by <br/>
having all this adult energy focused on him, and so reacts by getting <br/>
resistant or spacey when left alone.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s better for the kids to do the &quot;leaning on a truck&quot; parallel play <br/>
or work kind of thing that Sandra mentioned in her article <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/truck.">http://sandradodd.com/truck.</a>   I would imagine that was the original idea <br/>
behind Summerhill since I know it&#39;s a big part of what John Holt wrote <br/>
about. .... doing serious satisfying things and letting the kids be part of <br/>
that real world.<br/>

What sort of parents send their children away to school? They must  <br/>
already be so disconnected - damage then is already done to these  <br/>
children-=-<br/>
<br/>
A couple of unschooling families have sent a kid (both times a  <br/>
teenaged girl) to Summerhill.  One has been and gone home, I think;  <br/>
one is going to go next year.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid wants to live in England for a while, it doesn&#39;t seem like a  <br/>
bad idea!  Holly got to spend a month in England last spring, with  <br/>
another family.  Not the same as boarding school.<br/>
<br/>
But in England there&#39;s a big tradition of boarding school, and if I  <br/>
were a kid there and had a choice between a traditional school and a  <br/>
progressive school, I&#39;d like progressive.<br/>
<br/>
There was a boarding school in southern Colorado in the 60&#39;s called  <br/>
the Rocky Mountain School.  Someone a little older than I was named  <br/>
Peyton Dew went there.  Her dad was a rich Wyoming ranger with a  <br/>
winter house in Santa Fe and a couple of years she went to that  <br/>
school.  She was there the first year, when the students built a  <br/>
couple of buildings so they didn&#39;t have to live AND have classes in  <br/>
the barn.  It was on some old ranchland, and they raised chickens and  <br/>
planted food.  A hippie school.   John Holt taught there a while.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t know how long it lasted.<br/>
<br/>
Then and for a while after (and honestly, I think STILL) there was  <br/>
the Santa Fe Alternative school, which was a day school and not  <br/>
boarding, but attendance wasn&#39;t compulsory.  I know a couple of  <br/>
people a little younger than I am who went there.<br/>
<br/>
Those schools have long served the purpose of negating claims of  <br/>
mainstream educators (as unschooling success stories do now), and the  <br/>
additional purpose of being thinktanks and laboratories for those  <br/>
interested in alternative education and school reform.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056935405"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the wild monkey atmosphere at Summerhill that is <br/>
&gt; causing the problems: the children haven&#39;t been guided at all---just <br/>
&gt; let loose.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder if it could also be a case of kids suddenly having freedom <br/>
and not knowing what to do with it. We talk on here all the time about <br/>
how if a child is restricted in what they can eat, when they must go <br/>
to bed, or how much tv/videogames they can watch, that if those <br/>
restrictions are suddenly lifted they may go way overboard with the <br/>
freedom of it at first. <br/>
<br/>
I dont know if the majority of kids at Summerhill come from more <br/>
restrictive households, or are more unschooly-type families. In <br/>
*either* case i would hope that there would be some level of adult <br/>
involvement, that it wouldnt just be assumed that the children will <br/>
behave well since they are entrusted with freedom. They probably still <br/>
need to get feedback from adults on appropriate behavior, on a regular <br/>
basis. <br/>

And Aussies. My husband is from a family of 7 kids and they all (bar the last 2 - one of which is him) went to boarding school. Both the boys and the girls schools were in Sydney which was 8 hours drive by car to their home. That family is totally disconnected (but for many other reasons too) and no wonder. They really don&#39;t know each other and it&#39;s so sad. Lots of rural people ove3r here, on western properties etc send their kids to boarding school. It&#39;s a cultural thing for them - their parents went, their grandparents and so on. i guess, for them, it&#39;s what&#39;s normal.<br/>

someone forwarded to me recently, which I will try to find and link  <br/>
to, but can&#39;t at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
The title was something to the effect of &quot;schools crack down on  <br/>
millennium parents&quot;, and the gist was, that parents now (in the US),  <br/>
are becoming so involved in their children&#39;s lives, that they are  <br/>
trying to control the outcomes of EVERYTHING their children do.   <br/>
Almost like they care so much that they are trying to micromanage  <br/>
every little detail of their children&#39;s lives, from infancy on up.  I  <br/>
think it results in situations where the children develop a unique  <br/>
sense of entitlement due to their parents stepping in at all times to  <br/>
manage their lives, particularly when things go &quot;wrong&quot;.   This could  <br/>
contribute to negatively perceived behavior down the road, perhaps.   <br/>
All from parents who really DO care, but are somehow getting it wrong  <br/>
through an excessive amount of controlling involvement (in the  <br/>
school&#39;s estimation).<br/>
<br/>
Apparently school systems are having entire conferences around how to  <br/>
manage these types of parents.<br/>

<br/>
Oh!<br/>
Even when I was in school in the 1960s there were a few parents who  <br/>
came and told the teachers how to be, after they had already chosen  <br/>
the teachers their kids would have.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to college, my first roommate&#39;s mom had come with her for  <br/>
the first week.  Her mom was sitting and filling out her schedule for  <br/>
her totally, while the roommate was arranging her lotions and  <br/>
shampoos and underwear.  That seemed to me at the time to be too much  <br/>
mothering, but probably I was partly just jealous that neither of my  <br/>
parents knew enough to advise me at all, and had basically left me  <br/>
off at the curb and waved goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby took some community college classes I did help him with  <br/>
his schedule.  Those schedules are really hard to read, but I did try  <br/>
to show him what all the little codes meant about what building and  <br/>
what days and hours.  We were trying to work around his work schedule  <br/>
and karate, too, so it was complicated.  Still... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Schools have for years said &quot;parents need to be more involved&quot; but as  <br/>
soon as a parent does get involved, the teachers and administrators  <br/>
get defensive and feel crowded.   In the case of charter schools,  <br/>
locally, some of them become SO infested with parental input that  <br/>
they don&#39;t even last the year.  A friend of mine started last fall at  <br/>
a new charter school being based on some system that had just gone  <br/>
out of print, so they were kinda winging it, and only two teachers  <br/>
had been trained in it (whatever it was, I forget), and by October  <br/>
parental pressure was turning the school into a Waldorf school.  In  <br/>
summer when the school was advertised nobody said &quot;Waldorf,&quot; and by  <br/>
October some kids were pulled out because of disorganization, and by  <br/>
Christmas anyone who didn&#39;t like Waldorf was gone.  I seriously doubt  <br/>
that the school lasted all year.  Another charter school in town here  <br/>
was closed in late winter for financial mismanagement.  It&#39;s  <br/>
interesting to see even public schools coming apart from within.<br/>

&gt; to understand others&#39; personal boundaries and what&#39;s socially<br/>
&gt; acceptable in different situations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just happened on this topic and it reminded me of an article that <br/>
someone forwarded to me recently, which I will try to find and link <br/>
to, but can&#39;t at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
The title was something to the effect of &quot;schools crack down on <br/>
millennium parents&quot;, and the gist was, that parents now (in the US), <br/>
are becoming so involved in their children&#39;s lives, that they are <br/>
trying to control the outcomes of EVERYTHING their children do. <br/>
Almost like they care so much that they are trying to micromanage <br/>
every little detail of their children&#39;s lives, from infancy on up. I <br/>
think it results in situations where the children develop a unique <br/>
sense of entitlement due to their parents stepping in at all times to <br/>
manage their lives, particularly when things go &quot;wrong&quot;. This could <br/>
contribute to negatively perceived behavior down the road, perhaps. <br/>
All from parents who really DO care, but are somehow getting it wrong <br/>
through an excessive amount of controlling involvement (in the <br/>
school&#39;s estimation).<br/>
<br/>
Apparently school systems are having entire conferences around how to <br/>
manage these types of parents.<br/>
