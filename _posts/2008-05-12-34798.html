<div id="ygrps-yiv-285610276">I&#39;m not sure about that being manipulative, but maybe it is.  It doesn&#39;t sit<br/>
right, either way.  I have been known, on many occassions, to apologize to<br/>
my kids and my grandkids for something I&#39;ve done.   I believe that children<br/>
should know that we aren&#39;t perfect and that it&#39;s ok to respectfully<br/>
disagree.   I think it sets a better example for them when they see us<br/>
recognize our own mistakes and apologize.  I&#39;m not sure we are giving the<br/>
same example when we point out their &#39;wrongs&#39; and ask if they have seen us<br/>
do that.   You know, as I sit here trying to focus my words and type them, I<br/>
think it is manipulative.   It may not be an intentional manipulation, but<br/>
it is manipulation.   If my child does something that I percieve as &#39;wrong&#39;,<br/>
the only effect I can see from that is guilt.  By me saying, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry<br/>
I&#39;ve set a bad example.  It&#39;s my fault you did this&quot;,  I am trying to cause<br/>
them to feel guilt that they have made me feel responsible.  That&#39;s<br/>
manipulation.  It&#39;s also absolving them of responsibility and that isn&#39;t<br/>
what I want to teach my children/grandchildren.   I want them to learn to<br/>
accept responsibility for the things they do. <br/>
<br/>
OK, this is JMHO.   Thanks for giving me something to think about!<br/>
  <br/>
As always, Mi Vida Loca<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It IS manipulative. Because instead of just saying &quot;I have an issue<br/>
with ________&quot; you&#39;re trying to lay on a big old guilt trip. It might<br/>
be totally honest in the right moment, if you truly DO something that<br/>
isn&#39;t helping your child, but that seems like a &quot;tool&quot; the parent is<br/>
using to manipulate a certain outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, it&#39;s labeling the child&#39;s behavior as &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; and<br/>
usually when we seek understanding and connection, we truly see the<br/>
child is doing the very best they can at the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122930432">I think *my* problem with it is the part that goes &quot;for setting a bad<br/>
example&quot;. If you&#39;re going to ask for forgiveness, ask because it was the<br/>
wrong thing to do, period. I&#39;ve done that before, sincerely, when I suddenly<br/>
saw things from the other person&#39;s (child or adult&#39;s) POV due to being in<br/>
new/different circumstances. The kind of &quot;example&quot; that set had nothing to<br/>
do with it, it was the way I was being treated/had treated the other person<br/>
that had everything to do with it. Make sense?<br/>

I think it makes the moment about the parents, and also suggests  <br/>
indirectly (sometimes indirectness can be very irritating) that the  <br/>
child will copy the parents, instead of thinking independently.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the child says &quot;No, you didn&#39;t&quot; (which is probably the &quot;right&quot;  <br/>
answer or the parent wouldn&#39;t have asked) then it&#39;s a kind of &quot;so  <br/>
it&#39;s not your fault&quot; from the child, verbally, to the parent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be a situation designed to certify the parent as  <br/>
blameless and the child solely at fault.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298711171">It doesn&#39;t sit well with me either, but I think apologising for a<br/>
specific known mistake is fine.  Good, even<br/>
<br/>
We were dog sitting for my parents&#39; dog recently. He kept digging<br/>
under our fence and I referred to him as a stupid dog a few times in<br/>
frustration.  My daughter started calling him stupid after that and I<br/>
realized how terrible it sounded and that it wasn&#39;t really what I<br/>
meant at all... so I told her that I didn&#39;t really realize it until<br/>
she said the same thing I did but that it was a mistake and what I<br/>
really meant was that I was frustrated with what he was doing and I<br/>
should have just said that.  I stopped.  After a while she did too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I think that she isn&#39;t responsible for her own behavior,<br/>
but she is very observant and learns a lot from watching me so if I<br/>
act as though something is OK then she will generally think that it<br/>
is.  And if I let her think that about something that isn&#39;t OK then I<br/>
have wronged her and I do indeed owe her an apology.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is a well intentioned reaction to hypocritical parents who<br/>
would tell you not to do things and walk around seemingly oblivious to<br/>
the fact that they did the exact same thing. I think there are better<br/>
ways to do this, but if they really do seem sincere to the child then<br/>
it could be a lot worse.  In writing, though, it sounds insincere an<br/>
condescending.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295578858">my mom sort of twists this into saying &quot;I know we were trying to make the perfect family and I can see where you guys will all screw up your kids too&quot; but she does not really think SHE did anything wrong it was just the culture of how you raised kids- <br/>
<br/>
a little more sincere could be when someone says &quot;I wonder if my mom felt like this or my grandma&quot; for instance my grandma said something about that how she was feeling must be how her mom felt when the next generation started going to the grandma&#39;s house instead of the great grandma&#39;s house- instead of a blame thing<br/>
