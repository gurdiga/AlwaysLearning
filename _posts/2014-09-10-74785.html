<div id="ygrps-yiv-695822236">We&#39;ve been living by radical unschooling principles since my oldest was 2.&nbsp; She is now 8 and considered by the state to be in third grade.&nbsp; So for the last 2 years (for her and last year for my 2nd child), we&#39;ve had to register as a private school (the only way to homeschool in our state without using a charter).&nbsp; The record keeping requirements are not extensive and no one sees our records except us, unless there is a problem.<br><br>So, I&#39;ve been keeping records just in case we were ever reported for anything.&nbsp; I also enjoy it.&nbsp; It&#39;s fun to look back over the week or the month and remember all the things we did and talked about.&nbsp; I just had a notebook where every day I&#39;d write down things like &quot;Planted trees with 4H&quot; and all the discussions that sprang from that- renewable resources, building houses with wood vs. rocks.&nbsp; Or discussions sparked by minecraft or using fractions while we cooked or things we read and so on.&nbsp; <br><br>This last year, as the year went on, I noticed myself responding differently to the kids&#39; requests to do things depending on whether or not it was something I could record as &quot;educational.&quot;&nbsp; I truly believe that tv, video games, imaginative play, and everything else in life are all things kids learn from, but if I ever had to show my records, a judge would not likely be impressed if I had written down &quot;watched Winx,&quot; unless I also wrote down a conversation about something &quot;educational&quot; that was sparked by the show.&nbsp; <br><br>I would catch myself responding differently and correct it, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any ideas for how to keep records without even making that distinction in my mind.&nbsp; <br><br>Another aspect of this is that my husband is out of state for work, and I really want to keep some kind of record or journal of what we do to keep him in the loop.&nbsp; I have a blog, and I guess I could just blog more, but so many things aren&#39;t picture-taking, bloggable stories or events.&nbsp; It&#39;s just a 4 sentence conversation here, and noticing the kids saying something new they learned to each other there, and those are the kinds of things I used to write down.&nbsp; <br><br>So I guess I need ideas of how to journal our lives in such a way that doesn&#39;t require me to think daily &quot;would this be considered educational by the state?&quot; but would suffice (with some changes if necessary) for that purpose if it were every needed.&nbsp; <br><br>Emily <br><br>E~ 8<br>L~ 6<br>Z~ 3<br>A~ brand new<br><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-695822236yui-cursor"></span></p></div>
