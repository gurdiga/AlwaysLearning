Thank you for this simple, beautiful story.  How wonderful to know that there are other children in the world who are free to expereince angst without the risk of losing mother&#39;s love.  Bless you, bless you, bless you.<br/>

She was at my feet, screaming and crying.  I reached out and <br/>
picked up one of her favorite candy bars, KitKat, and paid for that <br/>
too.  Janene refused to leave.  She held on to the counter, screaming, <br/>
out of control.  I picked her up and carried her gently to the car.  <br/>
Her <br/>
little arms wrapped around me and she loved on me as she was screaming <br/>
at me.  I just held her tight, until she settled and then put her in <br/>
her <br/>
carseat and we drove home.  About half way home I started talking about <br/>
the plan for the evening, janene and I go upstairs to cuddle in bed, <br/>
and <br/>
Lexie and Taylor wait downstairs for Taylor&#39;s mom.  Janene started to <br/>
say she didn&#39;t have a candy when I told her that I had bought her a <br/>
candy.  She was so happy. <br/>
<br/>
Thisi s a long convoluted way of saying that a few years ago I would <br/>
have said &quot;she doesn&#39;t get a candy, she had a tantrum.&quot;  But thanks to <br/>
all of you, instead I thought &quot;she is so tired, it&#39;s hard to make a <br/>
choice.&quot;  I don&#39;t think she saw the candy as a &quot;reward&quot; for her <br/>
behavior, as I have been taught would happen.  Instead I think she saw <br/>
it as a--I don&#39;t know, Sandra, Pam, all of you, help me out, a symbol <br/>
of <br/>
my love, that even through she was upset, I still loved her.  Maybe <br/>
more. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she&#39;s quiet in bed now and I&#39;m going to go cuddle until she <br/>
goes <br/>
to sleep. <br/>
