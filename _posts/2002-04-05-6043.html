<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669610748">I think it&#39;s best to have more than one rat at a time because they are<br/>
so bright and social and get easily bored, but one could work if you<br/>
were really committed to giving it plenty of attention.  I always used<br/>
Carefresh for bedding, and the California breeders recommended it, but<br/>
we did have a couple of respiratory issues, so I&#39;ll look into aspen<br/>
shavings when we start again.  I live in VA, but I had an almost<br/>
impossible time finding any local breeders, so I called CA everytime I<br/>
had a major question.  I did finally find 2 semi-local breeders for when<br/>
we get more rats.  We never had a problem with our male rats fighting<br/>
with each other, but the breeders told me we were lucky on that score.<br/>
Oh, it&#39;s nice to find other rat fans!  I get so tired of people where I<br/>
live being so grossed out by them.  I subscribe to AFRMA&#39;s magazine, and<br/>
it has really interesting rat information in it.<br/>
