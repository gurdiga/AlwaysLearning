<div id="ygrps-yiv-935410855">Patty,  definately it&#39;s always about perception and this spurred my own need to vent and get feedback on the particulars of our situation.  As i am not worried about the comments or concerns coming from strangers however it&#39;s the family.  very supportive and mostly positive But in this case we have a world-traveled, very intellectual teacher who is very close with our kids.   Basically she thinks my son is missing out on so much and struggling from not reading.  While my concerns are there too (he is almost 10) I do see him growing every day and can appreciate his learning in so many ways that arent about reading.  I guess, they (inlaws and sil) _are_ showing concern more than they are judging but when you hear the restrained tone and see &#39;the look&#39; in their eyes as I speak it&#39;s difficult to think they arent judging me. <br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt;I can only hope she thinks it over more but in the mean-time i  wonder if <br/>
&gt;her judging us is your typical human behavior done so as to take the  pressure <br/>
&gt;off of ones own issues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;I think there&#39;s something to that.  I wonder if it works the other way  <br/>
&gt;sometimes too, like we *think* people are judging us because we&#39;re judging  <br/>

<br/>
Judgment is part of the way people think.  &quot;Judgment&quot; has a negative  <br/>
connotation, but then we hope for our kids to use good judgment.    <br/>
It&#39;s worth paraphrasing when the thought &quot;judgment&quot; comes up.<br/>
<br/>
So what they&#39;re judging you?  If they were saying your kids were more  <br/>
impressive than schoolkids, that would be judgment but you probably  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be complaining!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could offer to put her concerns in writing, which the two  <br/>
of you could read now and then open and read again together in ten  <br/>
years.<br/>
That might make her feel better.  And she&#39;ll probably decline.<br/>

<br/>
One of the things about teachers and reading is that they have a vision of <br/>
how reading happens starting with special books containing two word <br/>
sentences and lots of repetitive sounding words and very much baby subject <br/>
matter. I suspect that they then have a fear that an older person learning <br/>
to read at 10 or 12 or 14 must necessarily start &quot;at the beginning&quot; with <br/>
this kind of early material and progress in the regular schoolish way <br/>
through material of increasing complexity.<br/>
<br/>
The experience of Unschoolers appears to be that &quot;later&quot; readers begin <br/>
magically at age appropriate and interest driven material like Steven King <br/>
novels or game walkthroughs and technical manuals. This seems to be Jayn&#39;s <br/>
experience as she is looking at and starting to decipher the words in her <br/>
enironment, many of which are game instructions or magazine articles. The <br/>
material of interest reflects the high sophistication of the child&#39;s <br/>
*spoken* vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t following the usual sequence and they aren&#39;t trapped in toddler <br/>
land either.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very reassuring idea, don&#39;t you think?<br/>

It&#39;s just not true. Reading is the most *efficient* way for assembly  <br/>
line learning to happen. It&#39;s the most efficient way for one teacher  <br/>
to lead 30 kids through the same material.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s no more best than any other way people learn, or only best  <br/>
if that&#39;s the way a particular person learns best. But teachers don&#39;t  <br/>
realize they don&#39;t know how to help individual children learn.  <br/>
They&#39;ve only learned how to lead a crowd through material in a way  <br/>
that&#39;s testable and recordable and accountable.<br/>
<br/>
So when they say a child needs such and such, what they really mean  <br/>
-- without realizing it -- is a child *in school* being lead through  <br/>
a programmed sequence of learning needs such and such in order for  <br/>
the average in the classroom to stay at adequate levels.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788350232">Thanks.  This is all very true.  <br/>
The comment was made more or less to the effect:&quot; What about when his friends can read things and he cant? I know he feels bad for not reading&quot;<br/>
-First, i told them that his friends help him when they&#39;re playing a game.<br/>
 - as to the next concern, I told them that he usually does feel badly about anyhing he has trouble with- that&#39;s how he is. I thought later that maybe their perception is that he feels outstandingly badly because of his not reading, But it&#39;s mostly their perception and certainly their slight comments when i&#39;m not there could be part of the equation.  He is a very sensitive kid and i dont doubt for a minute that when his pap-pap asks him to read something there is absolute zero pressure. <br/>

<br/>
It surprised me.<br/>
<br/>
I had a few friends who could read well before they went to school.   <br/>
I had never thought very hard about it.  Vaguely I had thoughts like  <br/>
maybe their moms helped them, or they were just some kind of language  <br/>
prodigies, or just quick at whatever all reading took.   But none of  <br/>
them were longterm &quot;geniuses.&quot;  One is a good writer, and he did okay  <br/>
in school but not fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
So that data was just kinda left scattery in my brain and I hadn&#39;t  <br/>
looked at it until after I saw how my kids learned to read.<br/>
<br/>
The saddest thing I&#39;ve heard from people about their early reading is  <br/>
that once they could read their parents stopped reading to them, so  <br/>
they were sorry they had learned so early.    A child who &quot;can read&quot;  <br/>
might not be reading really fluently and that will relegate him to  <br/>
easy books, or to reading slowly and painstakingly.   Kids in school  <br/>
reported the same thing; I remember it myself.  When my mom read to  <br/>
me it was Winnie the Pooh, Uncle Remus and poetry.  I wish she&#39;d read  <br/>
way more but we didn&#39;t have any books.   When I came home with A&#39;s in  <br/>
reading, it all ended, and I was stuck with my schoolbooks and  <br/>
&quot;Little Golden Books&quot; (some weren&#39;t bad, but still they were short  <br/>
and for kids) and comic books (one a week if I was lucky).<br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t start reading phonetically, or maybe I didn&#39;t call  <br/>
phonetic stumbling &quot;reading.&quot;  School does.  It misleads everyone  <br/>
involved.  Even &quot;the good readers&quot; feel there&#39;s something wrong when  <br/>
the teacher says &quot;you can read&quot; but there are words all around them  <br/>
they can&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids could read, all words looked legible.  WERE &quot;legible.&quot;   <br/>
They could read like real people, not like first graders or second  <br/>
graders or third graders.<br/>

<br/>
I find that teacher/friends always ask me at what level my (8yr) son<br/>
is reading. I never know what to say. His reading ability is anywhere<br/>
from easy readers (but not all of them) to complex gaming instructions<br/>
(but not every word on the level), to reading each recipe title in the<br/>
cookbook I&#39;m reading. It&#39;s in no way a straight linear path at all.<br/>
And it definitely doesn&#39;t look like how school said it happens. <br/>
