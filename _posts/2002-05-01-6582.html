<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387721888">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I sat down to watch Frontier House on PBS last night with two of my children, expecting to peek into the past and at the realities of life for homesteaders in the 1880s.  The show turned out to be more about the difficulties involved for modern females trying to cope without make-up and shampoo on the frontier.  Really.  I don&#39;t know why the Malibu, California family signed up for the experience when the two fifteen year old teenagers and the mom were so obviously upset about their appearance sans make-up and blow-dryer.  But anyway, I was surprised to find so many posts to our local homeschool support group list about how disappointing the show was.  Many decided against allowing their children to view the show due to the lack of educational value.<br/>
<br/>
 Previously I would have also been disappointed at the lack of historical information to be found in this show.  But without even trying, I discovered I found value in the show, because it provided an opportunity for at least three members of my family to spend enjoyable time together.  We had a lot to comment on anyway, such as the values these girls had learned, teamwork, snow in June, and more.  But even if there were no comments, and only enjoyable time together as a family, that would have been enough for me.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first made the big switch to unschooling two months ago, I put away all the school texts and workbooks, but I pulled out the other stuff:  Family Math, Math for Smartypants, books of science experiments, computer games, etc.. We&#39;ve rented lots of movies, spent time playing Monopoly and Yahtzee.  But the movies were The Ten Commandments and Cleopatra, and the games are obviously math oriented. I thought replacing the boring stuff with the more fun stuff, in addition to giving choices and opportunities to say no, would mean I was unschooling, agenda or not.<br/>
<br/>
My reactions to the educational value of show last night made clear to me my philosophy of unschooling is changing.  These are my new thoughts:  I can have absolutely no agenda, not even think about anything academic at all, but just remain supportive and participatory in my kids&#39; lives by doing things for no other reason than to have fun.  <br/>
<br/>
But now I&#39;m doubting my judgment.  Am I radically unschooling, or being neglectful? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for answering even though it may be the millionth time you&#39;ve had to!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa <br/>

My reactions to the educational value of show last night made clear to me my<br/>
philosophy of unschooling is changing.  These are my new thoughts:  I can<br/>
have absolutely no agenda, not even think about anything academic at all,<br/>
but just remain supportive and participatory in my kids&#39; lives by doing<br/>
things for no other reason than to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
But now I&#39;m doubting my judgment.  Am I radically unschooling, or being<br/>
neglectful?<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t see much harm in thinking, &quot;Isn&#39;t that interesting how much<br/>
math she&#39;s picking up from Yahtzee.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The harm comes when you think, &quot;She&#39;s not doing enough math. Tonight I&#39;ll<br/>
try to get her to play Yahtzee.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a matter of motives and intent.<br/>
<br/>
And there will be plenty of things that appear to have no redeeming<br/>
academic, social or other value that your kids will want to do. &quot;Appear&quot; is<br/>
important in that statement, because some or many or most things they do,<br/>
including watching whiny people on 1900 house, may very well be valuable to<br/>
them in ways that neither you or they will fathom for days, months, or<br/>
decades.<br/>
<br/>
What interests them is what they need at any given time. If you are taking<br/>
note of their interests, and doing your best to encourage and assist in<br/>
them, and keeping an eye out for other things that your experience with your<br/>
kids has told you might ALSO be interesting to them, you&#39;re radically<br/>
unschooling. Neglect would be cheaper and more restful. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
My thoughts are usually something to this effect: &quot;Oh, they want to play Yahtzee.  That&#39;s good, it involves math.&quot;  I&#39;m wondering if it is too radical and even neglectful to move towards, &quot;Oh, they want to play Yahtzee.  That&#39;s good.&quot;<br/>

Is it neglectful to not even fathom, or worry or care about, if/when it will be valuable to them ever?

<br/>
Instead of backing away from obviously historical movies, though, maybe go <br/>
even further into them, while trying to forget the &quot;value,&quot; and pretty soon <br/>
it can be a fun genre all on its own.  My favorites:<br/>
<br/>
El Cid<br/>
Spartacus<br/>
Ben Hur<br/>
<br/>
Wallow in that stuff!!<br/>
<br/>
All KINDS of parts and connections will stick, and you don&#39;t have to assist <br/>
other than just provide the soup pot, water and ingredients.  It can simmer <br/>
for years.<br/>

No.  You&#39;re only responsible to consider learning for six hours times 180 <br/>
days per year.  The rest of the time they can &quot;just waste.&quot;  &lt;Bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Can I just not think about it at all &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
By George, I think you&#39;ve got it! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now that you mention it, Frontier House *hasn&#39;t* been educational, in the<br/>
Abeka sense of the word. And I&#39;ll bet there *are* hsing moms who will turn<br/>
it off because it&#39;s showing real people, warts and all. Even married people<br/>
who might want to get it on once in five months. Darn it, where&#39;s Pa Ingalls<br/>
when you need him?<br/>
<br/>
Still, neglectful mom that I am, I&#39;ve slouched in front of the tube with<br/>
both kids last night and tonight. Here&#39;s what we&#39;ve talked about (not<br/>
learned, since it&#39;s not, you know, educational...)<br/>
<br/>
Families come in different sizes and colors. They express their feelings<br/>
differently than we do. Not everyone who argues gets a divorce (although<br/>
jury&#39;s out on this one so far...)<br/>
<br/>
Priorities differ greatly among families. How would ours be different?<br/>
<br/>
What would be the thing you&#39;d miss most about your life right now? What one<br/>
thing would you take with you? (No, Nintendo does not count as one thing.)<br/>
<br/>
One person says she&#39;s a Christian and wants to act like one. Does she really<br/>
act like she says she will?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s morally right even if it&#39;s against the law.&quot; Do you agree? When might<br/>
it be correct? Is it correct in this instance?<br/>
<br/>
How did Gordon&#39;s opinion of his health change after the doctor saw him and<br/>
said he was OK? Why did he think he was sick?<br/>
<br/>
Who was Catherine Howard and why were they talking about her before the<br/>
chicken was killed?<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on, but we generally didn&#39;t talk about life on the<br/>
prairie. IMO, it&#39;s not about that; it&#39;s about adapting to change, and<br/>
psychological isolation, and expectations vs. reality. If they want to see<br/>
frontier life, I&#39;ll rent The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.<br/>
<br/>
My kids did learn a lot tonight, but don&#39;t tell them that. There&#39;s still one<br/>
night to go!<br/>

That&#39;s a pretty decent definition of unschooling you have there. Put that on<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We talked about this. The library apparently doesn&#39;t count as one thing<br/>
either. :-) Cacie and I both think that what we&#39;d miss most is reading.<br/>
We figured we&#39;d probably have almost nothing to read, at least nothing<br/>
modern... probably no comic books at all. And no email. I&#39;ll bet each of<br/>
us spend 2 or 3 hours in an average day reading something or other, and<br/>
there&#39;s no way we could bring enough books for 6 months in that wagon. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t an obvious answer, but I think it&#39;s true for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
We also talked a lot about how annoying certain people on the show<br/>
were...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822332091">Well, I threw that out there off the top of my head since we just saw it<br/>
again last week. It&#39;s really about town life in the 1800&#39;s, and the battle<br/>
over statehood. John Wayne does a great John Wayne impression; he has all<br/>
the mannerisms that people use to mimic him and it looks almost like a<br/>
parody of himself! (Yes, he really did say &quot;pilgrim.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Others? Last of the Mohicans. Jeremiah Johnson. Sarah, Plain and Tall and<br/>
its sequels. For realistic, frontier survival: Heartland, with Rip Torn and<br/>
Conchata Ferrell. That one is tough to watch but will stick with you. Bring<br/>
Kleenex.<br/>
