<div id="ygrps-yiv-211202871">hello everyone. my name is Angela. i homeschool/unschool my 4 <br/>
children. everyone is learning fine except my daughter. she is 12 and <br/>
not reading yet. she just has no desire to learn it. she thinks she <br/>
doesnt need it. i am starting tolose patience honestly as this is VERy <br/>
important to me. if she could read...well i would probably never ask <br/>
her to do another thing again. iwould let her read till her eyeballs <br/>
fell out:-D<br/>
my question is what do i do? i am afraid if i seek help from and <br/>
outside source, then i will be turned in for *neglecting*  her <br/>
education and she will be taken away from me as well as my other <br/>
children.<br/>
any ideas on what i should do?<br/>

<br/>
Have you been trying to teach her to read?  Is there pressure? How  <br/>
did your other kids learn to read?<br/>
