 </span></blockquote>Since the question *ought* to be how MANY unschoolers does it take to change<br/>
a light bulb, my unschooled 15 y.o. dd offers this answer:<br/>
<br/>
One -- duh!  <br/>
(Unless it&#39;s up really high and you need someone to hold the ladder.)<br/>

needed light! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590932014">Ok I don&#39;t have a good answer. But in my house the unschooler would not <br/>
even ask me for help. They would take care of it themselves and only <br/>
draw me in if they hit a major problem---like an explosion or major <br/>
breakage of something.<br/>
