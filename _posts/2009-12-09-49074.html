<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757141751">There&#39;s a blog challenge Frank Maier (an unschooling dad) picked up,  <br/>
and I copied, and some other people copied me, or him, and it&#39;s going  <br/>
around.  Each day there&#39;s something to write about the best [whatever]  <br/>
of 2009.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday it was &quot;peace,&quot; and I wrote some on my blog and put some  <br/>
photos, so I&#39;ll give you a link to that, but I wrote about my back  <br/>
gate, and about being in person with Kirby in September.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I read what Frank wrote that I remembered my whole  <br/>
&quot;Big Noisy Peace&quot; idea--that peace doesn&#39;t need quiet or solitude.    <br/>
Frank&#39;s is awesome and he&#39;s talking about his wife (who&#39;s on this  <br/>
list, I think, and other unschooling places as &quot;df&quot; or dragonfly or  <br/>
Ronnie) and daughters...<br/>

Moment of peace (December blogfest)<br/>
Moment of peace. An hour or a day or a week of solitude. What was the  <br/>
quality of your breath? The state of your mind? How did you get there?<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about skipping this one but then decided to give my  <br/>
take on it. For me, the idea espoused here equates to internal  <br/>
stillness. I know people who meditate. I think I understand the  <br/>
concept. The closest I come to that is when I&#39;m soaking in the bathtub/ <br/>
shower, my mind floating among the quanta. Otherwise, my brain is  <br/>
always gnawing at something. Always. Except...<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I frequently achieve a significant, mind-expanded inner  <br/>
stillness during animated conversations among the four of us. Chloe,  <br/>
MJ, Ronnie, and I will be engaged in a spirited discussion which will  <br/>
then mutate to the point where the three of them are embroiled in some  <br/>
specific concept, leaving me in a quiet conversational eddy. As I sit  <br/>
and watch them attempt to unscrew the inscrutable, I find myself  <br/>
slipping into an exceedingly peaceful state, my awareness open but  <br/>
unengaged, not actively gnawing at anything, my needs nonexistent, my  <br/>
wants nonexistent, the flow of time nonexistent. Ronnie, MJ, and Chloe  <br/>
are intensely engaged, their minds integrating, synthesizing, their  <br/>
brilliant exchanges of energetic thought almost visible in their  <br/>
intensity; but in those moments I feel that I am a stillness at the  <br/>
center of things, the shanti of the East.<br/>

<br/>
If any of you want to write something, even just on this list and not  <br/>
on a blog, I&#39;d love to read other people&#39;s peaceful moments and maybe  <br/>
save some of those that could help other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you did this on your blog, please bring the link here, too.   <br/>
It&#39;s a good topic.  Peace can be contagious and that&#39;s the kind of  <br/>
contagion a busy end-of-year holiday season can always use.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542289400">Here&#39;s one, with a quote from the middle of it:<br/>
<br/>
And, in that small, magical moment, standing with the woodstove  <br/>
warming my back, I had a sudden revelation as all these bits of living  <br/>
coalesced...<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere, in my sleepy mind, that refrain I used to hear so loudly,  <br/>
&quot;What a big mess!&quot; was transformed, and I found myself grinning in the  <br/>
dimly lit room, as the fire threw shadows around, thinking, &quot;What a  <br/>
big YES!!!&quot;<br/>
