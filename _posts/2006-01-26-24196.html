<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792271546">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
I just found a small group of radical unschoolers in the South Florida <br/>
area and trying to actively promote it so we can grow.  It seems to <br/>
strange that we have so few unschoolers in such large metropolitan area.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are in South Florida (Dade, Broward or Palm Beach county) or <br/>
thinking of moving to South Florida, please join &quot;RUBroward&quot; yahoo! <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna mom to Jacob & Jonathan - Miami, Florida</div>
