<div id="ygrps-yiv-249201248">I&#39;ve just discovered a page I started and didn&#39;t add enough to to announce it.  I have one account and need at least three.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here remembers something posted on this list, or on my site, or feels like messing with searching, or if anyone just wants to write something new in that vein, the page was made to house various reasons people started unschooling.<br/>

I was afraid if I didn&#39;t leave this note, I wouldn&#39;t find the page again for a year or forever.<br/>
