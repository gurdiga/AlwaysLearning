<div id="ygrps-yiv-261030289">Hello Unschooling friends.  I joined this group nearly a year and a <br/>
half ago.  I posted a bit in the beginning but haven&#39;t really been <br/>
around much other than a bit of searching for specific info here and <br/>
there, since.  <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if those of you with teenagers and adult children could <br/>
share your thoughts on the following.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, almost 14, has been going to sleep between 3 and 5 AM <br/>
consistently for months, now.  She sleeps until between 12 and 3 on <br/>
average, then wakes up and has just enough time to get dressed and eat <br/>
before going to her many classes, activities, sleepovers, etc.  This <br/>
situation concerns me for several reasons.  She can&#39;t seem to go to <br/>
sleep earlier than this without serious challenges biologically, nor <br/>
is she very cooperative with my requests for her to try.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the things I need is for her to contribute to the family jobs <br/>
before going to her activities every day in order for me to provide <br/>
the level of service that she wants from me (I am a single parent to <br/>
her and her brother, who is 8, and am limited in what I can offer plus <br/>
she happens to have LOTS of interests, outside commitments and <br/>
activities).  She is very good at getting jobs done once she sets her <br/>
mind to it but seems confused about how it all works logistically, <br/>
even though it&#39;s been discussed ad nauseam.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, she constantly tries to re-negotiate her way out of doing <br/>
the jobs that she&#39;s previously agreed to.  It&#39;s at the point where I <br/>
have begun telling her that it&#39;s either re-negotiating or her daily <br/>
activities that I can participate in because I do not have the time <br/>
and physical/mental energy for both.  Also, she often does a poor job <br/>
at the chores, even though I&#39;ve seen her do way better work many <br/>
times, until I approach her with what ends up turning into constant <br/>
little micro-managing requests that negate the ability for her to <br/>
contribute in the first place if I am needed to do so much guiding (it <br/>
gets to where we need to stop the work she&#39;s doing and re-define what <br/>
`doing the dishes&#39; means for the thousandth, for example).  <br/>
<br/>
She has been honest and said that she wishes she could just have all <br/>
the activities and interests AND my high level of service to her <br/>
without having to contribute anything in the way of family jobs in <br/>
exchange.  She seems not to want to let go of that wish and it appears <br/>
to be a driving force in our daily exchanges.  Also, she has become <br/>
increasingly hostile toward me when I remind her of her agreements and <br/>
commitments to the job she&#39;s previously agreed to for the day Â– the <br/>
one that ensures that she can be driven to her activity/activities for <br/>
*that day* in exchange for.  So our household has become very <br/>
unpredictable and volatile due to her constant deal-breaking and <br/>
pattern of hostility.  This has become increasingly unrealistic and <br/>
stressful for her brother and for me.  <br/>
<br/>
The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.  <br/>
For example, when I ask her to TRY to go to sleep earlier than 3-5AM, <br/>
she agrees to get into the bed at, say, 11 or 12 with a book (she&#39;s <br/>
all too quick to make verbal agreements, that is the pattern, but then <br/>
she breaks them constantly).  Then, I often come out at 2 or 3 AM and <br/>
she tells me that she tried to go to sleep earlier but  it didn&#39;t <br/>
work, so there she is on the computer in her room or watching TV, <br/>
again.  Then, the next day, we&#39;re back at the same place of her <br/>
needing to sleep until very close to the time to leave and me feeling <br/>
very stressed about her help toward the family jobs because, not only <br/>
is she breaking her commitment to my need for her to do her share of <br/>
housework a good deal of time before it&#39;s time to go to her activity, <br/>
but shortly after she wakes up and for a while afterward is when she <br/>
becomes very unkind in her language and behavior, uncooperative and <br/>
deal-breaking, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, I&#39;ve had to cancel my participation in several of her classes <br/>
and activities because things have escalated beyond what I can <br/>
personally handle.  Again, there are no other adults committed to <br/>
providing for her, so it is up to her and I to create our own reality, <br/>
here.  There is also my son that I am equally committed to, but it <br/>
always seems that Dd&#39;s behavior and interests dominate my time and <br/>
energy.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a big part of why I have come to the place of canceling my <br/>
offers of contribution toward her interests when she breaks her word <br/>
about our agreements.  Kindness is my very first priority as a person <br/>
and as a parent and I&#39;ve learned not to try to push myself past my own <br/>
limits so as to continue providing opportunities to my daughter <br/>
because I become unkind to myself, to her, and even to my son by way <br/>
of his passive involvement when I don&#39;t honor my limits and abilities.  <br/>
I am also wanting to honor her limits and it appears that her behavior <br/>
is more honest about them than her words are, so that is also my <br/>
intention in canceling some activities).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already told her that I am indefinitely unwilling to participate <br/>
in any interests of hers that begin before 1 or 2 in the afternoon <br/>
because of the patterns she has.  I need for at least *me* to be clear <br/>
about reality, here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has some feedback or experience to share, I would be so <br/>
grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance.</div>

<br/>

&gt; `doing the dishes&#39; means for the thousandth, for example).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things:<br/>
<br/>
My dd does the dishes, but in the middle of the night, when she&#39;s  <br/>
awake.  Is there some reason the chores have to be done in the  <br/>
morning?  I mean, vacuuming while people are sleeping would be rude,  <br/>
and I myself don&#39;t do it in the morning while my kids are asleep, but  <br/>
hand-washing dishes isn&#39;t noisy.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, does she know what you expect -- I mean, does she really?   <br/>
You may think she does, but if she hasn&#39;t been taught to do it the way  <br/>
you expect, you can&#39;t hold her to your standard.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like she&#39;s getting you back by doing a poor job (passive  <br/>
aggression, maybe).  Try accepting the way she finds works best for  <br/>
her, even if its not exactly how you would do it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She has been honest and said that she wishes she could just have all<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why don&#39;t you knock it off, then?  You&#39;re the one in control, not her  <br/>
-- except, of course, if she doesn&#39;t do what you want.  You&#39;re giving  <br/>
her that power, but it&#39;s her only power.  How about letting go of the  <br/>
jobs, doing them yourself, lowering your standards, etc.?  Find a way  <br/>
to take her out of the equation.  It takes two to fight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.<br/>
&gt; For example, when I ask her to TRY to go to sleep earlier than 3-5AM,<br/>

&gt; but shortly after she wakes up and for a while afterward is when she<br/>
&gt; becomes very unkind in her language and behavior, uncooperative and<br/>
&gt; deal-breaking, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she goes to sleep at 3 to 5 a.m., and, like all teens, needs 10 to  <br/>
12 hours of sleep every day, she&#39;s not going to wake up rested until 3  <br/>
to 5 p.m.  She wakes up to a mom angry at her for *sleeping,* stressed  <br/>
about some stupid household chore, calling her a &quot;Deal breaker,&quot; etc.   <br/>
I&#39;d be unkind, too.  I&#39;d avoid contact with that mom, and I&#39;d be  <br/>
cranky and uncooperative, too.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if my mom *honored* my sleep pattern, recognized that I truly  <br/>
*cannot fall asleep* sooner than 3 a.m., cannot wake without 10 to 12  <br/>
hours&#39; sleep, was kind enough to arrange her day to accommodate my  <br/>
needs, I might feel more kind and cooperative.  I might suggest doing  <br/>
the chores after mom and brother go to bed, so mom wakes to a clean  <br/>
kitchen, for instance (I call my dd a &quot;house elf,&quot; after Harry  <br/>
Potter).  And I always say &quot;thank you.&quot;  When I drive my son to a  <br/>
friend&#39;s house, he alway says &quot;thanks mom&quot; when he gets out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you have to do in her activities, beyond providing  <br/>
transportation and perhaps fees?  Would you have no time and energy to  <br/>
do these things if you did all the housework your daughter is failing  <br/>
to do?  Perhaps you both need to cut back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Again, there are no other adults committed to<br/>
&gt; providing for her, so it is up to her and I to create our own reality,<br/>
&gt; here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She might be doing more than she truly wants or needs to do; mine each  <br/>
had one activity at a time.  We didn&#39;t try to do lots of classes or  <br/>
sports.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  There is also my son that I am equally committed to, but it<br/>

&gt; offers of contribution toward her interests when she breaks her word<br/>
&gt; about our agreements.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does she have a real choice in these agreements?  If you can cancel,  <br/>
can she?<br/>
<br/>
In my home, I&#39;ve never, ever required chores.  If I ask one of my kids  <br/>
to help or to do something, they do it.  If they ask for my help, like  <br/>
driving somewhere, I do it.  No negotiations, though a &quot;Can I do it a  <br/>
little later?&quot; is always a possibility; I try to not ask while  <br/>
someone&#39;s in the middle of a video game, etc.  Now, my *husband,* on  <br/>
the other hand, does want to see them help in exchange for their  <br/>
allowance ($20 a week each, which they use for their own pets, lunches  <br/>
out, and games tournament entry fees).  There are a few things we  <br/>
parents don&#39;t usually do anymore, like scooping the yard.  Other  <br/>
things, like folding laundry, are done by anyone in the room at the  <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>

the plans are truly important to *her,* she can be responsible for  <br/>
getting there.  Take yourself out of the equation.  If it&#39;s something  <br/>
your son wants to do, leave your 14 y.o. daughter home to sleep.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been a consistent pattern for my 14 yr old too!  However, I<br/>
don&#39;t see this as a problem.  I think teens have a different biological<br/>
clock than children and adults.  The house is quiet and her time is<br/>
uninterupted by her younger sibling.  She can talk to people from<br/>
different parts of the world because of the time difference, or she can<br/>
do other things on her computer without IM interuptions.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t schedule anything involving her before noon, ever!  If I do,<br/>
it&#39;s exceptional and she makes the effort to get to bed earlier and get<br/>
up earlier because she wants to do the activity.  When she wakes up, I<br/>
try to ensure that she has at least an hour to get herself ready in a<br/>
relaxed way.  I also don&#39;t force her to attend any of her activities, or<br/>
our activities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; her and her brother, who is 8, and am limited in what I can offer plus<br/>
&gt; she happens to have LOTS of interests, outside commitments and<br/>
&gt; activities).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This would be overwhelming for my daughter!  She wouldn&#39;t even begin to<br/>
know how to work under those conditions.  She helps out a lot though,<br/>
especially if I ask her kindly and give her the option of saying &quot;no&quot;. <br/>
She routinely cleans the bathroom that she uses without my asking.  It&#39;s<br/>
messy most of the time, but she will tidy it if I ask her, if there is a<br/>
guest coming over or something of that nature since it would be the<br/>
bathroom used by a guest.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t clean her room, nor do I ask her to.  She only sometimes<br/>
does the dishes, but she will pick up stray dishes if she sees me doing<br/>
them.  Mostly though, I clean up after her because she clearly isn&#39;t<br/>
ready for that task of keeping a household in working order.  In common<br/>
areas, she really does try to keep her mess contained to her area and is<br/>
perfectly okay with a quick tidy up.<br/>
<br/>
Also, she often does a poor job<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at the chores, even though I&#39;ve seen her do way better work many<br/>
&gt; times, until I approach her with what ends up turning into constant<br/>
&gt; little micro-managing requests that negate the ability for her to<br/>
&gt; contribute in the first place if I am needed to do so much guiding (it<br/>
&gt; gets to where we need to stop the work she&#39;s doing and re-define what<br/>
&gt; `doing the dishes&#39; means for the thousandth, for example).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the biggest clue that you should stop what you are doing and<br/>
either stop expecting her to help or accept what she gives to you<br/>
without critique.  If she can&#39;t do the dishes alone, do them with her,<br/>
you wash, she dries and puts away.  Really it will go super fast and you<br/>
won&#39;t have to worry about wether or not they are clean.  Put her<br/>
favorite music on and do it at her pace.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So our household has become very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unpredictable and volatile due to her constant deal-breaking and<br/>
&gt; pattern of hostility. This has become increasingly unrealistic and<br/>
&gt; stressful for her brother and for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Take the pressure off.  Hire someone to come in and clean up major stuff<br/>
every other week, so that you have a quick tidy up every other week<br/>
before the cleaning person gets there.  All of you can work on each room<br/>
of the house together and pick up so that the cleaning person can clean<br/>
the floors and bathrooms or whatever it is that you feel absolutely is<br/>
soo super necessary for feeling like your house is clean.  Seriously, it<br/>
would take about an hour or 2 once every other week or once a week if<br/>
you so choose that option.  That is not much time at all!  If you can<br/>
afford a lot of extra activities for your kids, you can afford<br/>
housecleaning service, they are really not very expensive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just as an example, I have a family of 4 and I do dishes once a day and<br/>
it takes literally about half and hour, sometimes an hour if it&#39;s really<br/>
messy.  That&#39;s such a small chunk of time, and it can be pleasant listen<br/>
to music and contemplate life time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.<br/>

&gt; all too quick to make verbal agreements, that is the pattern, but then<br/>
&gt; she breaks them constantly).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s trying to avoid you and get you off her back.  Unless that is your<br/>
goal with your relationship, stop trying to get her to do something she<br/>
clearly doesn&#39;t want to or can&#39;t do!<br/>
<br/>
  Then, the next day, we&#39;re back at the same place of her<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; needing to sleep until very close to the time to leave and me feeling<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back to the housework.  I&#39;m actually trying to imagine what kind of<br/>
household chores you have since they seem to take precendence over all<br/>
other things at your house other than making it to activities and<br/>
getting enough sleep.  I absolutely don&#39;t clean house everyday!  I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine what kind of chores one would have to do EVERY day that is<br/>
taking up so much of life for your family!  The only things I do every<br/>
day are dishes, kitty litter boxes, and feeding pets and people, that&#39;s<br/>
it!  Other things happen here and there, laundry, yard work, clean up,<br/>
floor cleaning, but not every day.<br/>
<br/>
Quit making her life miserable and about meeting your expectations!<br/>
<br/>

sleep and being realistic about starting time of activities.  Before 1<br/>

chores done and other work necessary for living.  After 1 or 2 can be<br/>
daughter time, relaxed and free from your expectations of what she<br/>
should be doing.  Go and take her to her activities and do all that fun<br/>
stuff with her.  Create an atmosphere of fun and enjoyment with her<br/>
without all that other stuff getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
If I know we have to get going sooner than my daughter would like, I&#39;ll<br/>
go in and wake her up with a nice warm cup of coffee and be kind and<br/>
gentle with her to get her going.  I WANT her to be happy and relaxed,<br/>
so I create whatever atmosphere will help that to happen!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84354073">-----------------snip-------------------<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if those of you with teenagers and adult children could <br/>
share your thoughts on the following.<br/>
-----------------snip-------------------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have teenagers or adult children. My oldest child is 11. I, however, am an adult child and one who is applying the principles of unschooling throughout her life. As a suggestion, you might do well to open the question to all and not just to limit your respondents to those in a similar situation.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------snip------------------<br/>
My daughter, almost 14, has been going to sleep between 3 and 5 AM <br/>
consistently for months, now.  She sleeps until between 12 and 3 on <br/>
average, then wakes up and has just enough time to get dressed and eat <br/>
before going to her many classes, activities, sleepovers, etc.  This <br/>
situation concerns me for several reasons.  She can&#39;t seem to go to <br/>
sleep earlier than this without serious challenges biologically, nor <br/>
is she very cooperative with my requests for her to try.  <br/>
-----------------snip-----------------<br/>
<br/>
From the time I was 2 until I was in my 30&#39;s I stayed up late and slept late. It got more extreme in my early teens and stayed that way until I had Simon and Linnaea. And still, if things are stressful I will tend to stay up later in response. As guilty as I felt for being unable to sleep well, I can remember lying in bed at night, tossing and turning, listening to relaxation tapes, having mom or dad tell me to turn my light off, all of that, I never fell asleep easily before about 3 am. Much like your daughter tells you: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;For example, when I ask her to TRY to go to sleep earlier than 3-5AM, <br/>
she agrees to get into the bed at, say, 11 or 12 with a book (she&#39;s <br/>
all too quick to make verbal agreements, that is the pattern, but then <br/>
she breaks them constantly).  Then, I often come out at 2 or 3 AM and <br/>
she tells me that she tried to go to sleep earlier but  it didn&#39;t <br/>
work, so there she is on the computer in her room or watching TV, <br/>
again. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could not go to sleep unless I was exhausted. I still can&#39;t. If I don&#39;t fall asleep right away I won&#39;t fall asleep without entertainment. I will lie in bed for hours and hours tossing and turning and getting more and more frustrated until the wee hours of the morning. No matter how tired I am. If, instead, I do something, like read a book or play on my ds or get up and watch television or spend time on the computer, I can fall asleep much more easily. Some nights I will fall asleep reading a book and then wake up enough to turn off the light and be woken too much in the process and the whole thing will start all over again. She isn&#39;t lying to you, she isn&#39;t yanking your chain, she is describing something that happens to me and has happened to me for much of my life. <br/>
<br/>
You wrote: &quot;The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward opposition.&quot; A &quot;tendency toward opposition&quot; only comes up when there are requests that are made of someone that they feel oppositional about. I would argue, most strenously, that your perspective that she is staying up late to oppose you is wrong. Maybe not completely, maybe she is rebelling against you. But being a night owl is not unusual. And it isn&#39;t willful. I tried for years to go to sleep at a more &quot;normal&quot; hour, I used to take sleeping pills and melatonin as well as relaxation tapes. It didn&#39;t work, my clock just wasn&#39;t set for early to bed early to rise. <br/>
<br/>
-----------------snip------------------<br/>
One of the things I need is for her to contribute to the family jobs <br/>
before going to her activities every day in order for me to provide <br/>
the level of service that she wants from me <br/>
-----------------snip------------------<br/>
<br/>
What are the family jobs that you require from her? How are they negatively impacting your life if they aren&#39;t done. Our house is not the neatest of places much of the time. Dishes usually are done, vacuuming is occasionally done, sweeping and mopping rarely, I do laundry, but  often it isn&#39;t put away. None of that really negatively impacts my life unless I&#39;m having allergy moments. Usually, though, cleaning makes my allergies worse as I stir all the stuff up in the process. But maybe your family jobs are something different then household chores?<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of family jobs, Simon and Linnaea could care less how clean the house is. Maybe there is a standard they have for cleanliness, but I haven&#39;t gotten too far gone for them. The standard of cleanliness that I tend to maintain is my own. It isn&#39;t a &quot;family&quot; job, it&#39;s a personal requirement. There are some things that David maintains to a level that is far beyond my awareness. He doesn&#39;t think about waxing the car as a family job, even though Linnaea and Simon may join in, it&#39;s something he wants to do because he likes the car to be protected from the elements. He doesn&#39;t hound me to clean the car or to change the oil or to check the brake pads. Those are things that are important to his sense of wellbeing, not mine. When we were dating he was appalled by the state of my car. I was fine with it. He didn&#39;t want me to drive it and would swap it for his fairly new truck. His standards are really different than mine. <br/>
<br/>
-----------------snip------------------<br/>
(I am a single parent to <br/>
her and her brother, who is 8, and am limited in what I can offer plus <br/>
she happens to have LOTS of interests, outside commitments and <br/>
activities).<br/>
-----------------snip------------------<br/>
<br/>
It is fantastic that her day is full of things to do and ways to explore the world. I imagine that it can feel overwhelming and disconnecting for you to have her be asleep or out all the time. Still, how fantastic that she is so engaged with so many things. Try and think about all the things that she is committed to as things that bring her joy. Think about helping her to achieve those things as ways of helping her to be happier, more fulfilled, more switched on. It will feel much nicer when you drive her to or pick her up from something or the other and you think about how fantastic it is that you get to help make this thing happen and you get that time between one thing and another with her. It is good to look at the bright side. And to find joy in giving to your children. <br/>
<br/>
-----------------snip------------------<br/>
She is very good at getting jobs done once she sets her <br/>
mind to it but seems confused about how it all works logistically, <br/>
even though it&#39;s been discussed ad nauseam.  <br/>
-----------------snip------------------<br/>
<br/>
I turn off of things that are discussed ad nauseum. I don&#39;t hear when it moves to more than one repetition. My face goes blank and I start thinking about other things or getting really resentful of the speaker. It often feels patronising and rude. Even if I&#39;m being rude in response.<br/>
<br/>
Why are the jobs difficult to comprehend? Is there a standard that you are asking her to achieve? Beth Fuller tells a story of when she used to be quite obsessed with being the perfect homemaker. Her husband Kevin wanted to give her a gift so he vacuumed the whole house, all of it, every room, for her. She smiled and thanked him and started doing it all again because he hadn&#39;t made straight lines with the vacuum cleaner. Are you expecting there to be ruler straight lines in your carpet? Are you asking her to do for you like she was a cleaning service and you need the plates washed and dried and put away in such and such way? I may just not be clear on what the &quot;family jobs&quot; are that you need to have done. <br/>
<br/>
Linnaea wants the computer. And a chocolate shake. Sorry I couldn&#39;t write more. <br/>

Everyone does.  That&#39;s why they call it &quot;ad naseum.&quot;  You keep on  <br/>

<br/>
I think it helps for a mom to write out what she&#39;s frustrated about  <br/>
and let us point at what she wrote.  It will help her when she stops  <br/>
being cranky and embarrassed about it, and it will help others who  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-458399278">-=-Hello Unschooling friends. I joined this group nearly a year and a<br/>
half ago. I posted a bit in the beginning but haven&#39;t really been<br/>
around much other than a bit of searching for specific info here and<br/>
there, since. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Having read your original post twice, and all the responses,  my  <br/>
first comment is that had you read this list for the past year and a  <br/>
half, you wouldn&#39;t have any of the problems you&#39;ve reported to us.   <br/>
We can help, but I maybe you should switch to getting the list by e- <br/>
mail.  I suspect you intended to just read the responses to this one  <br/>
question on the list.  By doing that, though, you won&#39;t have a feel  <br/>
for which of the posters are who and how, and that can make a  <br/>
difference in how you see their responses.<br/>
<br/>
Very often, the question someone asks isn&#39;t leading to the answer  <br/>
they need.  They&#39;re not sure what they need.  That&#39;s why coming  here  <br/>
occasionally for specific info didn&#39;t net you the full set of  <br/>
knowledge that would have  helped you move smoothly from having a  <br/>
twelve year old girl to having a really happy fourteen year old whose  <br/>
company you were enjoying.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not too late to make changes, but that year 13 is gone.  Don&#39;t  <br/>
let fourteen and fifteen pass by the same way.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I got to this part:  &quot;So our household has become very   <br/>
unpredictable and volatile&quot; it didn&#39;t seem at ALL &quot;unpredictable&quot; to  <br/>
me.  It seemed inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So our household has become very unpredictable and volatile due to  <br/>
her constant deal-breaking and pattern of hostility.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How might your daughter describe the situation?  (It doesn&#39;t matter  <br/>
to us, but you might want to consider it, if you can.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-The sleep issue is also affected by her tendency toward  <br/>
opposition. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Was she born with a &quot;tendency toward opposition&quot;?  Or is she  <br/>
responding rationally to too much control?<br/>
<br/>
-=-She has been honest and said that she wishes she could just have  <br/>
all the activities and interests AND my high level of service to her -=-<br/>
<br/>
What you define as your &quot;high level of service to her&quot; might be what  <br/>
others here would consider being a good mom.  It&#39;s your job to make  <br/>
her life easier.  It sounds like you&#39;re making her life hard in some  <br/>
ways, and she&#39;s trying both verbally and through action to  <br/>
communicate with you and you&#39;re ignoring the messages in favor of  <br/>
judging her oppositional, volatile...<br/>
<br/>
I think it would help immensely if you change your policy on chores.   <br/>
The first result will be she won&#39;t want to do anything, but that&#39;s  <br/>
because you didn&#39;t start sooner.  It will get worse unless you do  <br/>
something to make it better.<br/>

My kids all have slept when they wanted to.  Each night we talk about  <br/>
who needs to be up when, and whether they have an alarm set or want  <br/>
to be woken up.  We always have done that.  It&#39;s friendly.  We keep  <br/>
the house quiet until noon if possible, and even after if people are  <br/>
sleeping and there&#39;s no pressing need to use a vacuum or blender.  If  <br/>
everyone&#39;s awake before noon, the noise can commence.<br/>

<br/>
The boys had jobs at 14 and 15, respectively.  They&#39;re now 19 and  <br/>
22.  Both of them have had early morning jobs (6:30 five days a week,  <br/>
for Marty, for over a year), and both have had late-night jobs.   <br/>
They&#39;ve had no problems.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is more variable in her sleep schedule.  She&#39;s nearly 17 and  <br/>
has just come out of a time of sleeping ten hours or  every night.   <br/>
She needs less sleep now than she did.   She just filled in a long  <br/>
online application for Toys R Us, applying to work stocking shelves  <br/>
for Christmas.  She checked all possible shifts, late and early, any  <br/>
day of the week.  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll get the job, but she wasn&#39;t  <br/>
limiting herself to only afternoons.   If she needs to get up, she  <br/>
will.  Nowadays, when she wants to get up, she does.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s looking forward to what will happen when they wake up  <br/>
will be glad to wake up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949507544">Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
I was hoping for some advice from some of you all experienced USers.  I have been unschooling for several years now, and am FULLY convinced that I am doing the right thing.  Trouble is, I have a mother that I am very close to.  She lives next door to us, employs my husband, etc.  Our lives are very much intertwined.  Each year, with her encouragement, I buy a curriculum that I never use.  I have hinted at our convictions, without ever telling her, that my kids use the curriculum in a very non-traditional way (if at all).  Each time, I have mentioned it, she says that kids need to learn certain things at certain times, if for no other reason than to not look stupid to others.  I think that is absolutely ridiculous, but I am having  a hard time talking her out of this mindset.  My kids are brilliant.  They are good at many different things, even experts on several subjects, but they can&#39;t tell you all the state capitals.  That REALLY bothers her.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have been comfortable letting her think we are using a curriculum (however loosely).  But I am getting ready to have a significant surgery, and will be staying with her for recovery (for 6 weeks).  She wants me to bring our &quot;school&quot; so that the kids won&#39;t get behind.  I asked the kids if they would like to use their curriculum for several weeks, and they looked at me like I was nuts.  I guess I&#39;ll have to come clean.  Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299970375">i totally agree with the other feedback you have gotten, and i have nothing much to add - except that i have a 13 year old and am a recent convert to *true* RU with regard to chores, sleep, food, all of it.  so perhaps from that perspective, my experience can provide some encouragement.  i would say that until recently, the dynamic between my daughter and me (i have a son too, who&#39;s 10 - different dynamic) was markedly similar to what you describe. i felt torn between wanting help, acknowledgement, demonstration of  &quot;responsibility&quot; and all kinds of other things from her that were beyond her capabilities and really unreasonable for me to expect.<br/>
<br/>
almost as SOON as i backed off and really listened - and really started giving to her unconditionally, and let go of ALL the power struggles, etc. - she shifted to a place of much more peace and willingness to contribute - both on her own initiative, and when i request it.  <br/>
<br/>
but she is NOT responsible for keeping order in our home up to MY expectations.  and she needs nurturing still - in the form of small gestures like me making her bed at night (takes 20 seconds and makes her feel cared for and nurtured), me serving her meals and getting her snacks often (although because i am so willing to do it so often, if i ask her to do it herself she is absolutely fine with it.)<br/>
<br/>
our entire relationship has shifted with these changes and i wouldn&#39;t trade the cleanest house in the world for the way things were before.  i have become acutely awared of just how little time left at home she likely has, and just how *extremeley* important our relationship is - above and beyond all else.  <br/>
<br/>
i highly recommend giving deep consideration to all the great advice you&#39;ve gotten here.<br/>

Say, &quot;No, I&#39;m not planning to do that.&quot;<br/>

Stop there.<br/>

If she keeps talking about it say something like, &quot;I&#39;ve decided that I  <br/>

But you don&#39;t have to explain any more than that. If she argues, use  <br/>

<br/>
Also, I&#39;m wondering why you all are going to live next door - why  <br/>
doesn&#39;t she just come help you out and let you stay in your own house?  <br/>
Seems that would be so much more comfortable for you and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I hope MY kids want to live next door and all that &lt;G&gt;, but you&#39;re a  <br/>
grown woman with children and a husband and you shouldn&#39;t be afraid of  <br/>
your own mother anymore. Maybe ask yourself what the worst-case  <br/>
scenario is if you stand up to her. How bad could it really be? YOU  <br/>
have control over her grandkids - ultimately YOU could keep her from  <br/>
even seeing them at all. Seems to me that YOU have the power in this  <br/>
relationship but you don&#39;t act like it. Is it because your husband  <br/>
works for her? Maybe that&#39;s a really bad idea if it makes you feel you  <br/>

I agree with this.  And make it clear that as they learn all year  <br/>
anyway, the WHOLE time should be total vacation.  If she breaths the  <br/>
least school-sounding thing, you would only need to say the single  <br/>
word &quot;vacation.&quot;  (Thinking of Pam&#39;s &quot;towel&quot; here.)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, maybe they could show her cool stuff on youTube or on DVDs  <br/>
or they could do art together and you&#39;d know they were learning but  <br/>
she would think &quot;vacation&quot; and if she forgot you could say &quot;vacation.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The very first thought I had was that when you are in surgery, you could<br/>
declare a vacation for your kids as well.  If you aren&#39;t really wanting<br/>
to have a big curriculum discussion vs. unschooling discussion with her<br/>
right before you have surgery.  Perhaps you could put together some fun<br/>
activities where your mom only needs to drop them off places or take<br/>
them places.  Perhaps have a series of movies and books and activities<br/>
that all kind of relate to each other that take up lots of time in a<br/>
relaxed kind of way that keeps the kids looking busy and gives your mom<br/>
something to do that feels helpful.<br/>
<br/>
You could even use something from the curriculum as the inspiration for<br/>
the activities and call it the hands on activity development or<br/>
something.  Since you did already tell her that you use the curriculum<br/>
loosely, she could see it&#39;s loose usage and help put it in action.  You<br/>
could tell her that you only &quot;do&quot; school from 10-noon each day and some<br/>
days you go out.  So during 10-noon they could watch movies and do<br/>
little grandma crafts.</div>

Don&#39;t try to talk her out of it.  Let it be.  But don&#39;t let her be  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES. This is what finally got me to completely let go of demands and  <br/>
resentment - I realized that I could yell or cry or shame the kids  <br/>
into submission, but they&#39;d really still not do much, and we&#39;d all be  <br/>
unhappy. OR I could spend the time I&#39;d have been struggling with them  <br/>
doing some of the housework, doing it happily and with an attitude of  <br/>
doing it as a gift for them. WHAT a change in dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, my kids don&#39;t do a lot of housework, definitely not as much  <br/>
housework as I would have tried to make them do. But it is very sweet  <br/>
when they do it. I love walking into the kitchen, thinking I&#39;m going  <br/>
to unload the dishwasher, and discover it&#39;s been done by someone else.  <br/>
That&#39;s something they seem to do whenever they see it needs doing. And  <br/>
they do all their own laundry unless I happen to think of offering to  <br/>
do it - which is only every few months. We&#39;re living in a house that  <br/>
is often pretty messy - I can live with that for the sake of having  <br/>
happy times with my kids. When it gets to me, I clean up.<br/>
<br/>
Housework takes a lot less time than I used to think, too. I think  <br/>
when I was a kid and my mom made me do housework that it was such a  <br/>
negative experience, with all the badgering and complaining and  <br/>
resisting, that I built it all up in my head and I think of each task  <br/>
as HUGE! But I figured out that I can almost completely clean the  <br/>
kitchen, including doing a big load of dishes, in the time it takes  <br/>
for my coffee maker to make one pot of coffee. So I do that almost  <br/>
every morning and having a clean kitchen makes the rest of the messy  <br/>
house a lot easier to handle, for me.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, one of my kids lives in her own house now and her  <br/>
housekeeping is a lot like mine - somewhat neglected in favor of more  <br/>
enticing activities, then deep cleaned in a big huge burst of  <br/>
housekeeping frenzy. Her house always seems really nice and tidy and  <br/>
comfortable to me, but that&#39;s me - I&#39;m used to a lot of clutter from  <br/>
all the stuff we&#39;re always doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41714226">Thank you, everyone, for your replies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is good to know that her sleeping habits are normal amongst <br/>
Unschooled teens.  We aren&#39;t close with any other RU teens and no one <br/>
else in our little community of friends is doing anything remotely <br/>
like this (even our fellow Unschooling families) so it is VERY helpful <br/>
to get your feedback in this area.  This part was the main thing I was <br/>
hoping to get clarity about with my inquiry.  I had already assumed it <br/>
was normal, at least for my daughter, because it is simply what is in <br/>
her reality.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From what I see of your responses, this pattern is normal for teens <br/>
who are allowed to decide on their own sleeping habits and that is <br/>
reassuring to know because I don&#39;t like being the only ones!  (Or, <br/>
rather, I like knowing that we are not so unusual in as many areas as <br/>
it sometimes feels.  I don&#39;t mind being different, I love it actually, <br/>
but with too many things it begins to cause doubt for me.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE the idea of middle-of-the-night household work!  We&#39;ve <br/>
discussed it and are going to give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Based on some of your responses, I want to elaborate on where I am <br/>
coming from in my intentions.  I have always placed mothering my <br/>
children above all other priorities on my list of life goals.  Yes, <br/>
kindness is my first priority as far as my values go, and mothering is <br/>
the vehicle for my kindness as action.  I love nothing more in this <br/>
world as much as serving my children and seeing them happy and <br/>
creating/getting what they want from life.  That said, I have had to <br/>
learn the hard way that I do not want to support their happiness at <br/>
the *expense of my own*, which has been a difficult hurdle for me as <br/>
my own mother was big on sacrifice and suffering in the name of <br/>
mothering and was, thus, confused yet outwardly and inwardly unkind.  <br/>
This resulted in my extreme dislike for her (my mother) for many,  <br/>
many years which, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t resolved before her tragic <br/>
death at age 56 when I was 30, already a mother for nearly 7 years at <br/>
the time, and only just beginning to want to get close to her again.  <br/>
I&#39;ve learned that I think I would have much preferred a kind mother <br/>
and less options than the many options and stressed-out, demanding <br/>
mother that were my reality.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do &quot;my daughter&#39;s&quot; chores when I cancel my participation in her <br/>
activities.  &quot;THE chores&quot; have to get done no matter what, so I do <br/>
them when she doesn&#39;t.  However, I believe that my standards for the <br/>
chores are actually deeply relaxed and, yet, there is a certain <br/>
baseline standard that I refuse to leave the house without it being <br/>
met.  We&#39;re talking basic safety & hygiene, here.  Nothing even close <br/>
to extreme at all.  The jobs are not *required* of her but I do need a <br/>
certain minimum of them done each day in order for our home to <br/>
function, regardless of who they&#39;re done by.  There is also the very <br/>
real issue of time constraints.  We have no electric dishwasher, live <br/>
in a tiny little house and eat almost all our meals at home -- so the <br/>
dishes are a big deal as are any piles of anything around here.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as the suggestion of hiring outside help with the chores:  I do <br/>
not have money for that.  I have a very, very limited income.  Nearly <br/>
70% of my kids&#39; classes are free programs and the others are all <br/>
reduced-fee/sliding-scale/trade kinds of arrangements.  The money that <br/>
I do have for their interests is kind of an either/or thing -- classes <br/>
OR services like house-cleaning help.  We&#39;ve discussed this one <br/>
before and she chooses classes over hired house-cleaning help if there <br/>
is not the option for both.  For a short while, we tried an <br/>
arrangement of her contributing funds from her babysitting work to <br/>
help contribute toward a little bit of hired help with the chores (her <br/>
idea as an alternative to participating in them herself).  It didn&#39;t <br/>
last, however, because she quickly realized how expensive it was <br/>
compared to her realistic earning ability and my limited ability to <br/>
contribute financially to the situation, as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I call them family jobs because the children like having dishes to use <br/>
for eating, too.  If they were to opt out of using any were there no <br/>
clean ones available, I could see them not minding making an even <br/>
bigger mess with their food if there were no plate/bowl underneath it <br/>
because then they&#39;d likely opt out of cleaning that up, too.  Then <br/>
there would be even more cleaning jobs to do.  Personally, I like to <br/>
keep the jobs as minimal as possible since there is only so much of me <br/>
to go around and, again, there is literally no other adult picking up <br/>
any of the slack, here, and it&#39;s been this way for the better part of <br/>
my entire parenting career.  Furthermore, I have health issues that <br/>
greatly limit my energies.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have also been down a path of experimentation where I did not ask <br/>
for any help with any jobs.  Yes, Dd contributed voluntarily, but, <br/>
yes, it was far less than was realistic to sustain things.  The result <br/>
is that there was far less of me to be available for serving her <br/>
interests and yet she kept plugging for my contributions toward her <br/>
interest.  This pattern effectively dried up my availability to my son <br/>
and HIS interests, which did not sit well with me.  So we sat down and <br/>
I explained to Dd how, if she wanted these things from me, I needed <br/>
more from her in the way of reliable help with the jobs.  That her <br/>
contribution toward them meant more of me to serve her.  She gets it <br/>
entirely but just doesn&#39;t always remember the logic in the day-to-day <br/>
of things, which I understand.  It&#39;s the going around and around of <br/>
all this that is just so exhausting.  It is cyclical.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, I am just running myself too thin. I am the single <br/>
driver, food-maker, house-cleaner, day-planner and supporter-of-<br/>
everything else financially, physically, energetically, mentally, <br/>
emotionally, etc. I have tried to maintain the same level of life-<br/>
quality for her even though her contributions and their quality have <br/>
declined because, frankly, I want her to have these things as much as <br/>
it is possible -- &#39;what is possible&#39; being the key factor. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you asked for details regarding my participation in my <br/>
daughter&#39;s activities.  Here is the breakdown:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*  paying fees when relevant<br/>
*  organizing time/schedule-planning<br/>
*  researching class/activity offerings (and discussing them with her <br/>
which is surprisingly time-consuming)<br/>
*  talking on the phone/orchestrating daily plans<br/>
*  driving (huge time-sucker)<br/>
*  waiting during activities and occupying her brother during the <br/>
waiting<br/>
*  the biggie:  being available to receive and negotiate her Very <br/>
Frequent requests for lots of things/experiences/opportunities/etc.  <br/>
(I can elaborate on this one if requested.  Basically, my daughter is <br/>
a very energetic, highly-spirited person who makes tons of requests <br/>
all the time - she&#39;s been this way for her whole life.  The requests <br/>
are for information, activities, outings, material things, etc. etc. <br/>
etc. She&#39;s really into planning & doing lots and it all still needs to <br/>
involve me to a large extent, being the only supporter of her <br/>
reality.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I want to mention also how thankful I am for all of your <br/>
critical feedback.  It is good to look at this stuff from as many <br/>
angles as possible and I love that there is this group of people who <br/>
are all paving their own paths as they go.  I am reminded of just how <br/>
valuable support is to me and that I may need to participate in this <br/>
group more regularly so as not to feel so strange compared to nearly <br/>
everyone else we know.  Most of our local Unschooling friends have <br/>
children that are younger than my daughter&#39;s age, so she is kind of <br/>
the pioneer of our little community.  Friends come to US to ask what <br/>
is normal for their child&#39;s age because I&#39;ve got the oldest one.</div>

I am not *angered* by this pattern of hers.  I was feeling afraid for <br/>
her well-being as many people in my life say things like &quot;that is not <br/>
normal&quot; as in &quot;unhealthy&quot; and/or that it is &quot;unacceptable&quot;, etc.  <br/>

<br/>
Yes.  It&#39;s a cycle that&#39;s causing problems, and we&#39;re trying to help  <br/>
you see how to stop the negative cycle.  You&#39;re blaming your  <br/>
daughter, but it&#39;s not your daughter&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, I do &quot;my daughter&#39;s&quot; chores when I cancel my participation in  <br/>

This might help you see this as a choice instead of as a &quot;have to.&quot;   <br/>
I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t gotten a chance to look at the links about  <br/>
chores, but please do look at them.  It&#39;s a small tweak with a large  <br/>
effect.<br/>

<br/>
You referred to your &quot;RU Teen.&quot;  I&#39;d rather people use full terms on  <br/>
this list.   I question whether you should be using &quot;radical  <br/>
unschooling&quot; if you&#39;re cranky about late hours and requiring lots of  <br/>
chores.<br/>
<br/>
Another request I&#39;ve made before on this list is for people to really  <br/>
look at the euphemisms they might be using, and be honest with  <br/>
terminology.   To call chores &quot;family jobs&quot; is just a euphemism.  At  <br/>
my house there are NO chores.  Zero.  Chore means &quot;unpleasant  <br/>
task.&quot;   But we don&#39;t have another tricky  name for chores either.   <br/>
We call things what they are.  There is yard work, and laundry.   <br/>
There&#39;s cooking (which is fun).  There&#39;s filing books and putting  <br/>
games and DVDs back on shelves.  Each thing is done because we need  <br/>
the new work space or because we&#39;re looking for something and it&#39;s  <br/>
easier when things.  One of us puts towels in each bathroom.  When  <br/>
one bathroom is nearly out of toilet paper, they all get toilet  <br/>
paper.  When it&#39;s the night before trash day, a couple or three  <br/>
people go around and empty trash from various little trashcans.   <br/>
Someone (not always the same person) takes the can to the curb.   If  <br/>
I were the only one living here, I would do it all myself, but I&#39;m  <br/>
not so I don&#39;t.  Neither do I assign any jobs to anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I know it must seem impossible to picture for anyone who hasn&#39;t  <br/>
really, truly and fully let it go and been willing to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Same with most of the other parenting aspects of radical  <br/>
unschooling.  Same with the deschooling itself.  Anyone who isn&#39;t  <br/>
willing to take the risk cannot have the benefit.  Anyone who won&#39;t  <br/>
let it go until it happens will not have it happen a their house.<br/>
<br/>
To say &#39;I had to cancel my participation&#39; instead of &quot;I told her I  <br/>
won&#39;t drive her anywhere before noon&quot; is a dodge.  Mindful parenting  <br/>
won&#39;t come without clarity of thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I call them family jobs because the children like having dishes to  <br/>
use for eating, too. If they were to opt out of using any were there  <br/>

<br/>
Ah.  You didn&#39;t go to Joyce&#39;s site and read what she has to say about  <br/>
dishes, or you wouldn&#39;t have written this.<br/>
<br/>
Before you post again, please do read what you&#39;ve missed about  <br/>
chores.  You would have saved SO much energy and time already had you  <br/>
read those things a year and a half ago.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-We&#39;ve discussed this one before and she chooses classes over hired  <br/>
house-cleaning help if there is not the option for both. For a short  <br/>
while, we tried an arrangement of her contributing funds from her  <br/>
babysitting work to help contribute toward a little bit of hired help  <br/>
with the chores (her idea as an alternative to participating in them  <br/>
herself). -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a LOT of words to say (I think) that if she didn&#39;t want to do  <br/>
chores she would have to pay someone else to do them.  This is not  <br/>
relationship building.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-We have also been down a path of experimentation where I did not ask<br/>
<br/>
for any help with any jobs. Yes, Dd contributed voluntarily, but,<br/>
yes, it was far less than was realistic to sustain things. The result<br/>
is that there was far less of me to be available for serving her<br/>
interests and yet she kept plugging for my contributions toward her<br/>
interest. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A path of experimentation&quot; is not a commitment.  I&#39;m guessing  your  <br/>
experiment lasted a couple of weeks.  Just as with deschooling, the  <br/>
more you&#39;ve required, the more a child will celebrate the lack of  <br/>
requirements by &quot;doing nothing&quot; at first.  A child who hasn&#39;t been  <br/>
allowed to have food will gorge if the rules are lifted.  You can&#39;t  <br/>
say &quot;I&#39;m going to experiment with letting  you play all the video  <br/>
games you want for a week,&quot; and NOT expect the child to play 20 hours  <br/>
a day, knowing you&#39;re about to go back to the rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-yet she kept plugging for my contributions toward her interest.  <br/>
This pattern effectively dried up my availability to my son and HIS  <br/>
interests, which did not sit well with me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You blame her in harsh words for your life not being more pleasant.   <br/>
It&#39;s not loving.  It&#39;s not kind.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if your goal could be learning, and unschooling, more than  <br/>
kindness, you could make choices with that foremost.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So we sat down and I explained to Dd how, if she wanted these  <br/>
things from me, I needed more from her in the way of reliable help  <br/>
with the jobs. That her contribution toward them meant more of me to  <br/>
serve her.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This &quot;serve her&quot; sounds a little oogie now, especially since it  <br/>
sounds like you were (perhaps ad nauseum) explaining to her how she  <br/>
needs to serve you if she wants her unschooling life to be rich and  <br/>
full.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sandra, you asked for details regarding my participation in my  <br/>
daughter&#39;s activities. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, I asked for a rephrasing of &quot;had to cancel my participation in my  <br/>
daughter&#39;s activities.&quot;  I have three kids, each of whom was fourteen  <br/>
for a full year.  I know what it means to support their activities,  <br/>
to drive them around, to wait during classes.   What I don&#39;t know is  <br/>
&quot;had to cancel my participation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You chose to refuse to do something, but you had a fancy way of  <br/>
dodging the responsibility for that decision.  Maybe you&#39;re even in  <br/>
denial within yourself of the kinds of limits and conditions you&#39;re  <br/>
putting on  your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Your relationship sounds very adversarial.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps I didn&#39;t read everything, but anger or no anger this is what you<br/>
said<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So our household has become very<br/>
unpredictable and volatile due to her constant deal-breaking and<br/>
pattern of hostility. This has become increasingly unrealistic and<br/>
stressful for her brother and for me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of a happy coexistence with a 14 yr old, having a<br/>
volatile relationship seems pretty bad.  None of us are in your house<br/>
listening to your interaction with your daughter, but, I don&#39;t see how a<br/>
parent can appear happy and cheerful to a daughter that isn&#39;t measuring<br/>
up in the parent&#39;s standards.  I think both of my kids would see that as<br/>
being angry, or dissappointed, or something, but clearly not happy<br/>
coexistence, and certainly not pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Your voice could be kind and patient, but your actions are not, and kids<br/>
read those just as much as tone and presence.</div>

I had 4 &quot;loaner&quot; kids at my house last week. My little friend, Willow, 7,<br/>
commented several times she was *so* happy our house was as messy as theirs<br/>
:D Having a house that looks like people *live* there is far more important<br/>
than having a house that&#39;s presentable to those who live in museums! Not to<br/>
mention the free time I have available for fun stuff because I&#39;m not<br/>
obsessing about any household chore *have-tos*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883257303">Now that is an even better suggestion than midnight cleaning. Look for easy ways to get things solved like dishes. Paper plates are brilliant for us when there are lots of people over. Even though there are still other things to be washed, having the plates be paper takes some of it out of the equation. Ask for more specific help and lots of people will offer suggestions. If you want to have a less volatile household you need to move toward being less oppositional with your daughter, move to finding more solutions that don&#39;t include her labor. There are lots of helpful solutions that people come up with for ways of taking care of the things that you feel need to be cared for much easier. I am often impressed with the ideas that others have thought of and use. <br/>
<br/>
Simon and Linnaea have never opted in for doing the dishes, well, when Simon was 5 and Linnaea was 2 they did them a couple of times. We have never had a dishwasher and we&#39;ve always managed to have enough clean dishes to serve everyone. Even when David wasn&#39;t around. Even when folks are sick. Even when we are really, really busy. At no time are we requiring Simon or Linnaea to do the dishes. And yet neither of your choices, children washing dishes or no dishes leaving children eating out of their hands, seems to happen. <br/>
<br/>
I like doing dishes. I like standing in the kitchen and looking out the window with music playing on the stereo or talk radio thinking wispy thoughts, following the tendrils of ideas for a little while, washing the dishes. It&#39;s very meditative. It&#39;s very relaxing. It doesn&#39;t take long, maybe 15 minutes twice a day, maybe 25 minutes once a day. I do have help. David does the dishes fairly regularly. I think he enjoys doing them too. He plays really loud music while he does the dishes. The dishes air dry, which takes a step out of the labor. And they get put away before the next wash, usually, although sometimes they get used before the next wash happens. Sometimes I let things soak overnight. Sometimes I start doing the dishes and get distracted by something more important, more engaging and go and deal with that and then something else and then it&#39;s too late and when I get up in the morning I drain the sink and refill and they are really easy to finish. <br/>
<br/>
Having a clean house isn&#39;t anywhere near as important as having a house that all of us enjoy living in. Having dishes done isn&#39;t more important than hanging out with Simon and Linnaea. Having a vacuumed floor isn&#39;t more important than letting Simon or Linnaea watch a television show uninterrupted. Having my to do list cleared isn&#39;t more important than going to the game store because Simon wants to get Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow for the DS and we could fit in a 20 minute game of laser tag and check out Casltevania Portrait of Ruin from the library. Actually, I don&#39;t have a to do list, but if I did...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But what it&#39;s sounding like to me is that you&#39;ve allowed yourself to  <br/>
overschedule and are depending on your daughter to make the  <br/>
overscheduling work. But she isn&#39;t capable of that. Yes, I understand  <br/>
she&#39;s agreeing to put in the time, but at 14 she&#39;s showing you she  <br/>
isn&#39;t capable.<br/>
<br/>
The original problem is fitting all these activities into the day.  <br/>
You&#39;ve chosen the solution of your daughter helping in order to make  <br/>
that happen. And now you&#39;ve turned getting your daughter to help into  <br/>
the new problem.<br/>
<br/>
Start over. Focus on the original problem, not this made up problem  <br/>
about 14 yo help that&#39;s obviously not working.<br/>
<br/>
Put yourself on the schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Be realistic about the number of hours you need to get your stuff  <br/>
done. Show the kids what you would like to accomplish to see if they  <br/>
can see where you&#39;re maybe making it more difficult for yourself.  <br/>
Take their ideas seriously, even if they sound off the wall  <br/>
initially. (*Don&#39;t* show them the list to guilt them into helping.)  <br/>
Don&#39;t schedule more than you have time for. If they offer to help,  <br/>
let them know ahead of time what activity you won&#39;t be able to take  <br/>
them to if something doesn&#39;t get done. Don&#39;t get mad. Don&#39;t expect  <br/>
them to help. It&#39;s not a way to punish them. Reality is that there  <br/>
are just so many hours in the day and if you&#39;ve overbooked an hour,  <br/>
something&#39;s got to give.<br/>
<br/>
Bring some of the chores that seem to suck up time here and ask what  <br/>
others do. The solutions people suggest may not be perfect to your  <br/>
situation, but in those cases look at the sideways thinking rather  <br/>
than the specific suggestion.<br/>

Some people do find those pages and read them and their children&#39;s  <br/>
lives are made better, and their own lives are made better, and they  <br/>
get along better with the other people in their lives.  I know it&#39;s  <br/>
true because I get feedback, and because that feedback needs to be  <br/>

I&#39;m further down in my e-mail now and I know some of the morning&#39;s  <br/>
posts were headed off and returned.  It&#39;s probably for the best, but  <br/>
my response here is based on some of what didn&#39;t go to the list.   <br/>
Sorry about that, but the poster could use the feedback, perhaps, and  <br/>
I&#39;m unwilling to spend energy in private that could benefit others  <br/>
reading here.<br/>

The poster had commented that some of her posts hadn&#39;t gone through.   <br/>

(Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to- <br/>

When a mom is having trouble with a 14 year old and wants to bat all  <br/>
suggestions away as undoable, impossible, inapplicable, and then  <br/>
insult the list and listowner what, in the meantime, is going on with  <br/>
the relationship with the daughter?  This list doesn&#39;t exist to make  <br/>
mothers feel better about not changing.  It exists to help fourteen   <br/>
year old girls have better mothering.<br/>
<br/>
One glance in the archives will give a clue at how many thousands of  <br/>
hours of writing hundreds of unschooling parents have done to freely  <br/>
and generously help others understand unschooling.  For someone to  <br/>
come here and say &quot;I joined a year and a half ago...&quot; and then prove  <br/>
that none of that was being read or  used does make me want to grease  <br/>
up my long-unused trapdoor.  But I think it helps others see how far  <br/>
they&#39;ve come when someone resists all this help and experience.<br/>
