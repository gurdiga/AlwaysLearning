 </span></blockquote>I am. For us. I&#39;m out two or three nights a week and I really like it when <br/>
I&#39;m home that we all have some time that we sit together and don&#39;t do <br/>
anything else. Otherwise, these days, we dont&#39; have a lot of that kind of <br/>
time - with two teenagers and me working and so on....<br/>
<br/>
We typically eat dinner together with the tv off. Unless the Simpsons are on. <br/>
Or something else we ALL want to watch. Then we watch it and eat together and <br/>
that&#39;s great too. It doesn&#39;t seem to ever be a big deal - the rest of my <br/>
family is just happy to have a nice dinner on the table - nobody EVER <br/>
complains about coming to eat it together. That would be weird.<br/>
