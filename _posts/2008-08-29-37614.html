<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969036702">J likes to read to his little brother and sister before bed.  J&#39;s <br/>
reading skills are not up there yet but he does his best.  I just nod <br/>
if I am in the room, or help alittle if he seems to want me to but for <br/>
the most part he remembers the story.   I have mentioned here before <br/>
that his younger brother can read pretty well and J is beginning to <br/>
notice this.  I can see it in his face.  He has actually quit trying <br/>
to read as his brother has improved.  B reads to me quite often and J <br/>
hears him.  I have noticed the past few nights when I asked J is he <br/>
wanted to read to the kids that he would say yes, but then change his <br/>
mind and say something like, &quot;no my throat kind of hurts tonight&quot;. or <br/>
last night he said he couldnt see so well cause his glasses are <br/>
broken.  I just nod and go read to the kids.  Today, he came to me and <br/>
asked if I would write someone a note, and another time asked if I <br/>
would read something for him, &quot;because he isnt good a reading yet&quot;.  I <br/>
guess I just wonder if I should say anything to him about what might <br/>
be bothering him or just wait and see if he brings it up.  For the <br/>
most part he is happy, he has his things he feels he is good at, but I <br/>
know it bothers him sometimes.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567261210">Are there things he could do more from memory?  I&#39;m thinking maybe  <br/>
the good Dr. Seuss books like The Sneetches (and all the stories in  <br/>
that book) or Yertle the Turtle (and accompanying stories).   Or Shel  <br/>
Silverstein poems?   Like if you read them to him several times,  <br/>
maybe he&#39;ll pick them up, and could read from those.<br/>
<br/>
Those are good aloud-reads because they&#39;re musically poetic, and funny.<br/>
