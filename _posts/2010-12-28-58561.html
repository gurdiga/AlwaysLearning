<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059024782">ODD = Oppositional Defiant Disorder. It&#39;s helpful on lists to write things out and not assume everyone reading knows what you&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reading the list I found here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aacap.org/page.ww?name=Children+with+Oppositional+Defiant+Disorder&section=Facts+for+Families">http://aacap.org/page.ww?name=Children+with+Oppositional+Defiant+Disorder&section=Facts+for+Families</a><br/>
<br/>
it very much looks like my youngest would have been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, as well, except for one thing: I stopped making him do stuff he didn&#39;t want to do. ta-da! Before radical unschooling, I used to &quot;make&quot; him clean, pick up his things, go places he didn&#39;t want to, etc.  After we made the leap into radical unschooling, and I stopped requiring those things of him, he was no longer defiant. Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
I went through quite a long time where I never asked him to help, etc. - I wanted to make sure he knew I was serious, about cleaning, etc., being his own choice.<br/>
<br/>
He does blame others for his mistakes sometimes, still, but I am reckoning that with time and maturity, that will change. It HAS changed, as a matter of fact, he does that much less frequently than he used to.<br/>
<br/>
When he was quite young, a friend described him as &quot;very strong willed&quot; and yep, that&#39;s very true! His first response to authority is often &quot;no&quot;, even when what they&#39;re suggesting might be helpful. So... I don&#39;t push. I ask him, &quot;What do you think would help?&quot; rather than presenting solutions, for example.<br/>
<br/>
When you say &quot;I feel that there must be a better way to handle it all, although saying yes more and being passive and unconditional in love does not seem to help either&quot; were you or the parents thinking that treating him that way would produce a sudden, magical change? If he was in school, and resisted people telling him what to do and how to do it, his whole existence the time he was in school was stressful and difficult for him. He will not heal from that overnight.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also not sure what is meant by &quot;being passive&quot;. What did you mean by that? Just trying to get clarity, here - thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009991444">I don&#39;t know anything, really, about oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). I do <br/>
know that in our home there is very little to be defiant about. Linnaea or Simon <br/>
or David or I would have to work really hard to come up with things to rally <br/>
against. Looking at the Mayo clinic&#39;s webpage on it there are suggestions that <br/>
stress may be a contributing factor. Less stress is probably a better <br/>
prescription than more discipline. Calmer home, more peaceful environment, more <br/>
yesses, more time together, more awareness by the parents of what pre-eruption <br/>
signs there are so that they can move things from growing in stress to calmer. <br/>
All of those things and that class of care makes more of a difference in any <br/>
tension in our home. Food when he&#39;s hungry, drink when he&#39;s thirsty.<br/>
<br/>
 There isn&#39;t a need to label something that is a normal stress response as an <br/>
aberrant thing. I get grouchy when things are stressful, or I&#39;m hungry or <br/>
thirsty or tired or bored or stuck inside for too long or it&#39;s too dark or <br/>
whatever. It took me years to see that it was something about my response to the <br/>
world and not about the world that was setting me on edge. Generosity and love <br/>
and kindness and attention and engagement, those things will do far more than <br/>
anything else for oppositional defiant disorder. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087850002">He is not adopted.  They definitely say yes more and try to let things go as much as they seem able to do at the moment and no I don&#39;t think they are looking for a quick fix, they just want to help in whatever way they can.  It is much more than just the average &quot;I don&#39;t want to do something&quot;.  It is very extreme!!!  Sometimes the answer cannot be yes and at least 2 times a day (usually far more) he gets into a complete fit that goes on for an hour or so, swearing at people, throwing things, crying, begging, hitting, etc...it really is way over the top.  It is usually something that they just can&#39;t say yes to like wanting to go to someones house yet he isn&#39;t invited, or wanting a toy that is too expensive for them.  He seems to have anxiety over what he gets to do next, always wanting to have a friend over or something but kids are not willing to play with him anymore because he is so difficult to deal with, always arguing or pushing and he is 9.<br/>
  <br/>
This is not a normal stress response type thing it is far more then that.  Not sure what I am looking for, I guess just wondering if someone has actually dealt with this before and wondering what worked for them.  I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you are around it.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286627203">There were times in Linnaea&#39;s development, in Simon&#39;s development, in my <br/>
development where what you describe was part of the day. Linnaea had a <br/>
particularly hard time between about 4 and 7. It wasn&#39;t constant, it wasn&#39;t all <br/>
day, every day, but it wasn&#39;t infrequent. One winter it was so bad that I can <br/>
remember wandering through our nearest city crying. My crying didn&#39;t help. <br/>
Looking for a label wouldn&#39;t have helped. I think David actually stumbled across <br/>
operational defiant disorder as a descriptive one day and thought it might be <br/>
applicable. But what would I do with a label? It wouldn&#39;t give Linnaea cuddles <br/>
and love when she needed them. It wouldn&#39;t bring her food when she was hungry, <br/>
hold her and read to her and watch a movie with her when she was tired. It <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do anything but give me something to tell others when I needed an <br/>
excuse. She&#39;s tired worked just as effectively. Or something along those lines. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What worked was being with her, not blaming her, not telling her who or how to <br/>
be, not explaining, again, how much the world couldn&#39;t revolve around her. Just <br/>
being with her, being what she needed. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was a day when I nearly melted down in Toys &#39;R Us. I could feel everything <br/>
going pear shaped and I was tired of everything and all of it was stupid and I <br/>
was going to explode. And I stopped and I thought what would help now. And food <br/>
would help now. So we went to McDonalds and we got some food and then we came <br/>
back. If someone said I was having an ODD moment it wouldn&#39;t have helped. Food <br/>
helped. Recognising that when shopping in a toystore with two children under 10 <br/>
I need to have low expectations of speed or decision making helped.  All of <br/>
those things took me thinking about how I felt and what worked for Linnaea when <br/>
she was unhappy to get me to move forward. All of those things took knowing what <br/>
had helped on previous occasions. The more someone knows how to feel better the <br/>
easier it is for them to find ways to feel better. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking to the child in the moment helps. Sitting with a child more and more and <br/>
more helps. Watching for signs of a frustration build up helps. I am very aware <br/>
of the tone of voice that either Simon or Linnaea have when they are moving <br/>
toward frustrated. I am very good at cuddling or leaning in or offering <br/>
something nice in the moment when I hear that tone of voice. Those things make a <br/>
huge difference to how peaceful our home is. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I couldn&#39;t afford something I would talk about when I could. Write it down on <br/>
a list of things we are saving for. If Simon or Linnaea wanted to go to <br/>
someone&#39;s house I would call and see when we could arrange it. I would see if it <br/>
was going to their house that was important or if it was seeing the person. I <br/>
would plan a party or a gaming day or a gathering when people could come. The <br/>
more those things were being done, the more Simon and Linnaea knew I was <br/>
interested in making the things they wanted happen. They were much better at <br/>
waiting if they knew I was working for their goals. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A label and drugs and discipline won&#39;t help nearly as much being with the child, <br/>
helping the child, not trying to fix the child, just holding (if allowed) loving <br/>
and being generous and kind and patient. And when it feels impossible to be <br/>
patient, find a way. That sounds horribly like wait for a miracle, but honestly, <br/>
if someone can see their disappointment or frustration as something of their own <br/>
then maybe it will be easier to be kind and patient than if one looks at it as a <br/>
reflection on one&#39;s parenting. <br/>

<br/>
The reason I asked about adoption was to suggest a genetic component.<br/>
IF he&#39;s the biological child of these two parents, ARE these two his parents?  Is it a step-parent situation?   <br/>
Is either parent that way too--quick to defend personal space and choices?  <br/>
<br/>
IF any of the above, then that should be looked at first.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how many layers of frustration (or abandonment or shame) might need to be undone before he could start to relax.<br/>
<br/>
If school frustrated him and the family tried to force him into the school mold (before deciding to give that up), that might be another layer of recovery they&#39;ll need to look at.   <br/>
<br/>
IF he can be given space to really relax back to calm, maybe they can start again with new policies and relationships, but it will take a while.  And if either parent is also oppositional and defiant, and wants to control the child as much as he does not want to be controlled, unschooling might never work for them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He seems to have anxiety over what he gets to do next<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ray had a lot of anxiety in that regard and it helped to have a very regular routine *and* have things he wanted put in the same place all the time. The routine was fit around his needs, though, and mainly involved things like meals - knowing when he tended to get up and be hungry, I&#39;d make sure to offer him food at predictable intervals even though food was always available. The regularity/predictability seemed to help him a lot. <br/>
<br/>
It was also important with Ray to give him looooooots of time and notice to transition... but sort of conversely if there was something coming up that was &quot;iffy&quot; (and his bio mom&#39;s ability to plan tended to be especially &quot;iffy&quot; in those days) we wouldn&#39;t tell him at all. Anticipation was agonizing for him if there wasn&#39;t a clear &quot;as soon as we&#39;re done with lunch X will happen&quot; he&#39;d be a basket case. And if something didn&#39;t happen at all he&#39;d be a wreck for a solid day after. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Sometimes the answer cannot be yes and at least 2 times a day (usually far more)...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*************<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too many &quot;nos&quot; - parents need to find more ways to say yes, or at least &quot;partial yes&quot;. This child&#39;s needs need to become the priority for awhile, that&#39;s important! Its also very likely something that the whole family will resist - why &quot;should&quot; his needs be more important? But the reality is they are, that when they are not met then Everyone in the family suffers as a result. <br/>
<br/>
One of the hardest parts of learning to be an unschooling parent is learning to be proactive, and I suspect that&#39;s where these parents are getting stuck, still. They&#39;re still reacting rather than thinking ahead, actively looking for ways to make their child&#39;s life easier. Maybe they&#39;re still resisting the idea that making his life easier is valuable or important - that&#39;s a common point of resistance for many parents because so much of the &quot;parenting wisdom&quot; that floats around is exactly contrary to that sentiment. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you are around it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and no. People with very easy-going kids don&#39;t have much context for more intense kids, for sure, but at the same time its often very difficult to know which longtime unschoolers have (or had) more intense kids. Part of that is the principles of unschooling don&#39;t change from one set of needs to another, even though the practice may look very different. If these parents are being &quot;passive&quot; then they haven&#39;t gotten a good grasp on those principles! <br/>
<br/>
But part of it, too, is that unschoolers describe children and situations very differently than the norm - and sometimes that can make it seem as though all our kids are perfectly easy-going. It might help these parents to read through the &quot;special needs&quot; section on Sandra&#39;s site, if they haven&#39;t yet:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988411957">Again, be more present more of the time. When Simon or Linnaea have a hard time <br/>
with someone I am much nearer to them. It doesn&#39;t matter their age, it matters <br/>
their ability to cope with the situation. Again, look to the child and not to <br/>
the expectation. If Simon had a hard time with others I worked to make it easier <br/>
for everyone involved. Offering engaging things to do, food that they like, <br/>
tension breakers movement from one activity to another when something is waning, <br/>
alternative activities instead of just one focus makes it easier for others not <br/>
to even notice that one of the party may have a hard time socially. <br/>

become the priority for a while, for as long as he is suffering he needs to be <br/>
helped. There aren&#39;t other solutions that work. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Meredith sent links, I followed along to this page: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/giftedness.">http://sandradodd.com/giftedness.</a> It&#39;s about labels. Sandra wrote this: &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who WAS really tall in 4th   grade--taller than the TEACHER!  I <br/>
always thought of her as Really TALL,  and when we  were grown she was 5&#39;2&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We had a friend who couldn&#39;t reach the water  fountain in third grade, and he <br/>
grew up to be 5&#39;4&quot;--  you know what that  says for giftedness? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a mark on a curve. <br/>
If someone looks like a genius on third grade  tests,  it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll <br/>
forever be 50% smarter than people his age  for the rest of his life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The label ODD is the same kind of thing. If this 9 year old boy were 2 people <br/>
would talk about the terrible twos, if he were a teenager people would talk <br/>
about the inevitability of difficulties with teenagers. He is who he is, ODD <br/>
won&#39;t make him better or worse. He needs his needs to be the priority for a <br/>
while. This family needs his needs to be the priority for a while. <br/>

-=-Yes and no. People with very easy-going kids don&#39;t have much context for more intense kids, for sure, but at the same time its often very difficult to know which longtime unschoolers have (or had) more intense kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And the suggestion seems to be that those who are around it DO understand it.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of a horribly botched-up marriage and near divorce, someone could say, &quot;I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you are around it.&quot;  And that would be intended to dismiss the advice of those whose marriages are not endangered by thoughtless and irresponsible decisions made by both partners over many months or years.<br/>
<br/>
What the &quot;it&quot; might be that someone can&#39;t understand is how bad things can get if the people in the situation aren&#39;t very careful to avoid making it terrible.<br/>
<br/>
I could, if I wanted to, ruin my marriage in the next week.  I could cause Keith to not want to be with me ever again.<br/>
<br/>
I could, if I wanted to, destroy the faith and trust of Marty, or Holly, or both.  They would move out in a rage and I would say GOOD RIDDANCE.  (That would probably ruin my relationship with Keith if I hadn&#39;t already done that beforehand.)<br/>
<br/>
If I did that, should I say &quot;I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you have been in my situation&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Should people at risk of divorce take advice from divorced friends, or from happily married friends?<br/>
Jocelyn and Dan Vilter are celebrating 25 years of marriage today.  Erika Davis-Pitre and her husband John had a big anniversary of some sort last week.  They have way-grown kids.<br/>
<br/>
My sister left her husband of 20 years because it seemed her kids&#39; karate teacher was a nicer guy.  She left her 14-year-old son without a mom and without a karate teacher.  She was 14 when my parents divorced.  She&#39;s already divorced again, and that youngest son is often in trouble with the law.<br/>
<br/>
Do not take marriage advice from my sister.<br/>
<br/>
So. <br/>
There are relationships between parents and children, and although a marriage might last 50 years or more, the relationship between a parent and child has quite a different arc.  When Marty was little, I was strong and could pick him up and carry him.  Now Marty is big and strong and helps me carry things, and gets things off high shelves for me, and reminds me of things.   If I live until Marty is getting old and feeble, I will be MORE old and feeble. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My point is that parents have a short time to build trust and create peace.   They have a short window in which to attempt to repair damage.  They have an infinite number of ways to make things worse, and a limited number of ways to make things better, within their available few years.<br/>
<br/>
This is humor, but it&#39;s serious:  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513897882">I don&#39;t usually comment on this board, however, I thought I may be able to<br/>
offer a perspective from our experiences.  Our now 16yo son has always been<br/>
&quot;strong willed.&quot;  We began unschooling him in 1st grade, because he had gone<br/>
to a preparatory school for K, and he was 2 years ahead of the public school<br/>
kids when we moved. In 3rd grade he decided to try the PS.  They were<br/>
concerned that he didn&#39;t respond well to their prompts.  He didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
try his best unless I was there helping or watching his presentations.  They<br/>
thought he possibly had ODD and that he was too attached to me.  After about<br/>
a year (his choice) we went back to unschooling.<br/>
I remember questioning myself if his behavior was really a problem, but all<br/>
he really wanted was to treated with respect. He didn&#39;t like being ordered<br/>
around by teachers or other kids.  He wasn&#39;t used to being treated that way<br/>
at home or by our friends.  We tried to be around people that treated kids<br/>
with love and respect as individuals.  That&#39;s NOT the atmosphere in school<br/>
to a child that recognizes injustice.<br/>
Once back home he was back to his old self after about 6 months.  During the<br/>
first 6 months, we could not do any classes or anything that resembled<br/>
school to him, even though he enjoyed those things.  They brought out an<br/>
oppositional, negative attitude. His relationships with his sibs were very<br/>
strained.  About 2 years later I couldn&#39;t even believe that anyone could<br/>
have questioned his behavior.  He was such a happy kid, loving life and<br/>
learning.<br/>
Then in 7th grade he decided to try school again.  All his football friends<br/>
were in school and they convinced him that middle school was great.  We<br/>
supported him.  We all, including him, saw the oppositional attitude emerge<br/>
once again.  He left middle school at semester, but the deschooling process<br/>
took much longer this time.  I think that for kids who have such a strong<br/>
injustice recognition, any request, no, ect. can really seem like a command<br/>
or a power (control) struggle if not done very delicately.  They really need<br/>
to know that you really are on their side and want to help them maintain<br/>
control in their world.  At 16 he now knows that he doesn&#39;t always have<br/>
respect for authority.  He feels that being older than him doesn&#39;t<br/>
automatically warrant respect. His goal is to one day own his own company<br/>
because he recognizes that he does not enjoy being told what to do.<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, give it time.  After a while of being<br/>
treated with respect and freedom and choices, the defiance and oppositional<br/>
feelings may go away.  It takes time though.  He may grow up to be a very<br/>
caring, empathetic person if he is treated that way now and can see that his<br/>
parents place value on his happiness.<br/>
Hope this makes sense.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the suggestion seems to be that those who are around it DO understand<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the case of a horribly botched-up marriage and near divorce, someone<br/>
&gt; could say, &quot;I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you are<br/>
&gt; around it.&quot; And that would be intended to dismiss the advice of those whose<br/>
&gt; marriages are not endangered by thoughtless and irresponsible decisions made<br/>
&gt; by both partners over many months or years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What the &quot;it&quot; might be that someone can&#39;t understand is how bad things can<br/>
&gt; get if the people in the situation aren&#39;t very careful to avoid making it<br/>
&gt; terrible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could, if I wanted to, ruin my marriage in the next week. I could cause<br/>
&gt; Keith to not want to be with me ever again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I could, if I wanted to, destroy the faith and trust of Marty, or Holly, or<br/>
&gt; both. They would move out in a rage and I would say GOOD RIDDANCE. (That<br/>
&gt; would probably ruin my relationship with Keith if I hadn&#39;t already done that<br/>
&gt; beforehand.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I did that, should I say &quot;I suppose it is very difficult to understand<br/>
&gt; unless you have been in my situation&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should people at risk of divorce take advice from divorced friends, or from<br/>
&gt; happily married friends?<br/>
&gt; Jocelyn and Dan Vilter are celebrating 25 years of marriage today. Erika<br/>
&gt; Davis-Pitre and her husband John had a big anniversary of some sort last<br/>
&gt; week. They have way-grown kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My sister left her husband of 20 years because it seemed her kids&#39; karate<br/>
&gt; teacher was a nicer guy. She left her 14-year-old son without a mom and<br/>
&gt; without a karate teacher. She was 14 when my parents divorced. She&#39;s already<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74389951">I have one son, of my 4 kids that I would say people might consider intense.  He is more sensitive in many ways than my other kids and I need to be more aware of cues and anticipate situation more with him.  <br/>
We had a friend spend the night tuesday night, wednesday he didnt leave till about 2.  His mother asked if I might watch him and his sister today.  I knew, knowing my son, that this was alot of company time for him.  He needs breaks when it comes to people, he needs his space.  This has gotten better over the past few years, mainly due to our acceptance of our son for who he is and a conscious descision to view him as a unique individual and not someone that needs to be fixed.  So when we have alot of company, I make sure that Ben has a space to retreat too.. he can always leave the group and play on the computer or come to my room and watch t.v or read or whatever.  Today he retreated to my room and hid in his sleeping bag.. I brought him a rootbeer and pretzels and he was better not too long later.  My mother makes comments quite often about how we treat my son, implying and outright saying that we are spoiling him.  But I havnt always treated him this way.  When he was little I thought alot about how he was different, how we could &quot;fix&quot; him and he was misserable, cried alot, had tantrums, lashed out.  And now, he really doesnt and a child who said no all the time, no longer has a reason to.  He is also so much more cooperative when I really need/want him to be.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842035301">I just finished reading a very timely article that talks about the way addiction (like the Rat Park study), ADD, ODD and other serious conditions are largely a result of the way children are being raised. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.alternet.org/world/149325/trauma%3A_how_we%27ve_created_a_nation_addicted_to_shopping%2C_work%2C_drugs_and_sex/?page=entire">http://www.alternet.org/world/149325/trauma%3A_how_we%27ve_created_a_nation_addicted_to_shopping%2C_work%2C_drugs_and_sex/?page=entire</a><br/>
Here is a quote:<br/>
 And the essential condition for the physiological development of these brain circuits that regulate human behavior, that give us empathy, that give us a social sense, that give us a connection with other people, that give us a connection with ourselves, that allows us to maturethe essential condition for those circuits, for their physiological development, is the presence of emotionally available, consistently available, non-stressed, attuned parenting caregivers.<br/>
......<br/>
DR. GABOR MATÉ: Well, it&#39;s a great question. I just finished reading a very timely article that talks about the way addiction (like the Rat Park study), ADD, ODD and other serious conditions are largely a result of the way children are being raised. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.alternet.org/world/149325/trauma%3A_how_we%27ve_created_a_nation_addicted_to_shopping%2C_work%2C_drugs_and_sex/?page=entire">http://www.alternet.org/world/149325/trauma%3A_how_we%27ve_created_a_nation_addicted_to_shopping%2C_work%2C_drugs_and_sex/?page=entire</a><br/>
Here is a quote:<br/>
<br/>
......<br/>
DR. GABOR MATÉ: Well, it&#39;s a great question. You see, when we hear the phrase &quot;acting out,&quot; we usually mean that a kid is behaving badly, that a child is being obstreperous, oppositional, violent, bullying, rude. That&#39;s because we don&#39;t know how to speak English anymore. The phrase &quot;acting out&quot; means you&#39;re portraying behavior that which you haven&#39;t got the words to say in language. In a game of charades, you have to act out, because you&#39;re not allowed to speak. If you landed in a country where nobody spoke your language and you were hungry, you would have to literally demonstrate your angersorry, your hunger, through behavior, pointing to your mouth or to your empty belly, because you don&#39;t have the words.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that, yes, a lot of children are acting out, but it&#39;s not bad behavior. It&#39;s a representation of emotional losses and emotional lacks in their lives. And whether it&#39;s, again, bullying or a whole set of other behaviors, what we&#39;re dealing with here is childhood stunted emotional developmentin some cases, stunted pain development. And rather than trying to control these behaviors through punishments, or even just exclusively through medications, we need to help these kids develop.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>when we could arrange it. I would see if it was going to their house that<br/>
was important or if it was seeing the person. I would plan a party or a<br/>
gaming day or a gathering when people could come.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I like this a whole lot and I would also add that starting over with<br/>
different people, different kids is another possibility. Move on to other<br/>
horizons so that the child can have a new start and the parent can too. So<br/>
that the temporary problem with children who won&#39;t play with this child is<br/>
what it is.. temporary. The idea that a child has annoyed people enough that<br/>
others don&#39;t invite the family/child to events seems a bit ... I don&#39;t know.<br/>
Maybe not true.<br/>
<br/>
Not thinking in terms of permanent damage while ALSO dealing with the<br/>
child&#39;s frustration(s) will feel less frustrating and more doable.<br/>
Sometimes, for any number of reasons, friendships may form, not work out and<br/>
fall apart. Don&#39;t make the relationship that does that be the parent/child<br/>
one. Let that relationship be ok and welcoming, whatever frustrations may<br/>
come to alter a child&#39;s behavior. Child/child friendships will come and go<br/>
to some degree. If the parent/child relationship is solid, then the<br/>
temporary cessation of play friendships can be waded through much more<br/>
easily with less damage to the child.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem I see with labels like ODD is that the potential to<br/>
damage the parent/child relationship and the child&#39;s view of him/herself is<br/>
too great. Labels are risky business. Especially one that shouts ODD.<br/>
<br/>
How old is this child again? Nine is still so young! I have a tender 7 1/2<br/>
year old child.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how old one is, if one&#39;s frustration isn&#39;t easily articulated or<br/>
not at all articulated, then finding out how to help in just the right way<br/>
is vital and make take time. Keep making determined efforts to avoid writing<br/>
off frustration as &quot;nothing.&quot; Stay open and aware. Don&#39;t close off and think<br/>
that making rules is or will become the answer. It may not be possible to<br/>
directly help all situations that are frustrating a child but one may be<br/>
able to ease them so that they are a bit more bearable. I wish my parents<br/>
had been able to do that for me about my hearing loss, wearing hearing aids,<br/>
having trouble in school and communicating with others, with making friends<br/>
and so on. For a long time those were frustrations I couldn&#39;t explain, that<br/>
I needed more help with which my parents didn&#39;t understand at all, being of<br/>
normal hearing themselves. For me it was simply reality, the way things<br/>
were. I didn&#39;t have the same experience of normal that others did so<br/>
explaining *my* normal was hardly something I could figure out until I was<br/>
no longer a child anymore and could help myself or find help.<br/>

There are kids who have divided or destroyed homeschooling groups with bad behavior the parents can&#39;t address.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re a good friend for trying to find some ideas for this family. You see it happen and realize this is not within &quot;normal&quot; limits (whatever that means).<br/>
We lived through it as a family. It is as close to hell as I&#39;ve ever felt (if I believed there is a hell, that is). <br/>
No one understood. We were the cause of the problem. It was because of how we parented, etc. That of course only makes it worse. And it is not true.<br/>
What saved our family was the nurtured heart approach, as described in the book &quot;Transforming the Difficult Child&quot; by Howard Glasser. You can find more info here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://difficultchild.com/">http://difficultchild.com/</a><br/>
I may not agree with the title &#39;difficult child&#39;, but it definitely is a difficult situation. Dangerous for us and for our son&#39;s younger sister too. And so, so horrible for our son....<br/>
We started meticulously applying what is suggested in the book and within a week the symptoms started decreasing. It was that fast.<br/>
Howard Glasser is training people to help others. Your friends can contact him (his contact info is in the book) and ask where there might be a group or a person in their area who can help. There wasn&#39;t one in our area, but we managed by doing exactly what the book said. It is very in line with unschooling, so that is a good thing, so that it does not feel counter to what they are already trying to do. Our son is a very well-liked and happy person, so there is hope!<br/>

<br/>
For me, it is hard to see how giving a child points for &quot;good behavior&quot; (who decides?) which they can then use to buy things like TV and computer time is &quot;in line with unschooling.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It is wonderful that you and your family found something that works for you, but I would definitely hesitate to offer the endorsement that it follows the principles of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Glasser *seems* to give control to the child--it is his/her choice to act according to the rules parents/teachers have set up, and they aren&#39;t &quot;punished&quot; when they fail to act accordingly, which *is* a huge plus in terms of behavior modification practices.  But the whole system of authority figures deciding which areas are rewarded and which aren&#39;t, and then implementing an economic system where privileges are purchased from the points one rackes up, doesn&#39;t equal a partnership relationship, it is still one where the powerful (parents) have ALL the control over children.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  ï¿½<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is not a normal stress response type thing it is far more then that. ï¿½Not sure what I am looking for, I guess just wondering if someone has actually dealt with this before and wondering what worked for them. ï¿½I suppose it is very difficult to understand unless you are around it. ï¿½Thanks.<br/>

Actually, the rest of your post goes on to state that it was, indeed true. I think you&#39;ve mistaken &quot;because of how we parented&quot; for &quot;we were Bad People&quot;. Your parenting - you wrote - didn&#39;t work for your child, so you changed that. That&#39;s fantastic! So many people get stuck thinking &quot;its not My Fault&quot; and don&#39;t change the way they parent, even when its hurting their beloved children. <br/>

<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s common to let kids sink or swim, socially.<br/>
<br/>
Even among unschoolers, though, sometimes people don&#39;t talk to the parent because the parent is also problematical, or clueless, or mean.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In many cases, I just speak directly with the child and don&#39;t deal with the parents.  If they could have fixed the problem, they would have.  Sometimes honest communication from an outsider can make a difference, especially when the child and parent have an adversarial relationship and the child has his own power tied up in thwarting his parents&#39; controls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558821046">I come from a different perspective than many of the responses here... and I<br/>
agree with the many responses encouraging the philosophy of building the<br/>
parent child relationship and saying &quot;yes&quot; when possible. I have 2 children<br/>
with neuro-psych issues and I work in the field of child and youth mental<br/>
health.<br/>
<br/>
I am not convinced of the validity of the diagnosis of ODD. On the other<br/>
hand, I recognize (and experience) the reality of oppositional behaviors in<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
It was incredibly liberating for me to hear someone say (a few years<br/>
ago) that &quot;oppositional&quot; usually means &quot;anxious.&quot; It allowed me to see my<br/>
daughters through a lens of empathy. My daughters are both adopted and have<br/>
birth parent history of significant mental health issues.. They both have<br/>
mood disorder involving both high and low moods. One of them has an ODD<br/>
diagnosis... and I have never agreed with the diagnosis. The oppositional<br/>
symptoms only occur during her unstable mood states. When she started taking<br/>
a mood stabilizer, she stopped physically striking out at us, and the verbal<br/>
aggression decreased immensely. Her mood cycles last abbout 7 to 16 days,<br/>
and for about one third of the time, she was incredibly out of control of<br/>
herself, and felt very badly about herself. The medication has changed her<br/>
life! Sometimes medication is necessary!<br/>
<br/>
All of the children I know of with an ODD (oppositional defiant disorder)<br/>
diagnosis, have other neurological or neuro-psychiatric conditions. Some may<br/>
not be diagnosed yet... but there is something else going on. This may be<br/>
anxiety, autism spectrum, attachment issues, or a mood disorder, for<br/>
example.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the anxiety...  We have discovered that if we assume that<br/>
oppositional responses mean anxiety, it leaves us (the parents) responsible<br/>
to do the detective work on behalf of our child who is not really able to<br/>
think clearly for herself in the momemt. Sometimes there are clear triggers<br/>
we can observe : a change in plans leads to oppositional behaviors. Other<br/>
times we don&#39;t see clear reasons, and sometimes we can find patterns that<br/>
lead us to clues as to what is provoking the anxiety: the last 4 episodes<br/>
occurred while getting into the car after leaving a store or an activity.<br/>
<br/>
Nagging our sullen oppositional anxious child to do something, makes things<br/>
worse. When I am in a hurry to get somewhere, I give lots of time<br/>
checkpoints (15 minutes till we leave, 5 minutes... etc) and still at the<br/>
last minute, things may &quot;blow out&quot; At that point... I calmly state that I am<br/>
going down to put on my shoes. I don&#39;t ask anything of the overwhelmed<br/>
child. She will steam and stew a few moments... and then come downstairs to<br/>
get ready.<br/>
<br/>
 It is not easy to parent an intense child... and sometimes the intensity<br/>
comes packed with some major issues that do need to be unpacked!<br/>

&gt; Hi all,  I have a friend who is just in the beginning stages of unschooling<br/>
&gt; and it seems very clear that her son suffers from ODD, it is very stressing<br/>
&gt; on the entire family and was a huge concern in school.  This year they<br/>
&gt; pulled him and his sister out of school and are now home but the problems<br/>
&gt; seem to be escalating.  He is exhibiting all the classic symptoms and<br/>
&gt; apparently has his entire life.  They also do have him medicated, which<br/>
&gt; helps some.<br/>
&gt; My problem is that everything I have read so far is pointing to therapy for<br/>
&gt; the child but mostly for the parents to train them how to deal with him.<br/>
&gt;  That would be OK except that all of it seems to not mesh with unschooling<br/>
&gt; or peaceful parenting at all.  It seems to suggest isolating the child,<br/>
&gt; making them suffer for their bad behavior.  It seems to not be in his<br/>
&gt; control and I feel that there must be a better way to handle it all,<br/>
&gt; although saying yes more and being passive and unconditional in love does<br/>
&gt; not seem to help either.  I worry for all of them!!  My question is if there<br/>
&gt; is anyone out there that suffers with the same issue and if there are any<br/>
&gt; solutions besides medication and military like discipline?  I was a huge<br/>
&gt; factor in leading them down this path and I want to help them out as much as<br/>
&gt; I can even if it is just to gain knowledge that I can share.  Thanks so much<br/>
&gt; in advance:)<br/>

<br/>
How can a child live and act &quot;in opposition&quot; to a partner, though?<br/>
<br/>
Adversarial relationships create adversaries.  They&#39;re made of adversaries.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My daughters are both adopted and have<br/>
birth parent history of significant mental health issues.. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If their parents had been even-keeled saints, the children would still have problems because of adoption.  Even the best adoptive parents and the best genetics are faced with biological realities our culture doesn&#39;t recognize, discuss or consider.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly smells like I do.   Marty has Keith&#39;s temperament, sensibilities, and mathematical whizzitude.    Understanding one of them goes a long way toward undersatnding the other one.<br/>
<br/>
Even a biological parent in an intact family can be a mismatch for his or her own child, and that partnership can be strained and confusing. <br/>

That page isn&#39;t long.<br/>
Rebellion, defiance, opposition, stubborness, obstinance.... those are all the same thing.  They are a natural reaction to powerlessness and criticism.  They are attempts by someone to escape from a trap of belittlement.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another way of saying that is to see behavior as a form of communication. Its not always the most *straightforward* form of communication! A child who is hitting is not *necessarily* needing to hit something - and coming to understand those kinds of non-verbal cues can take some time and experimentation on the part of parents. <br/>
<br/>
This thread is cross-posted and I want to quote something I wrote on another list as it pertains to this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not convinced of the validity of the diagnosis of ODD. On the other<br/>
&gt; hand, I recognize (and experience) the reality of oppositional behaviors in<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The trouble with diagnoses is they can muddy the waters around those specific<br/>
needs. &quot;ODD&quot; doesn&#39;t actually say much of anything. Is he attacking people<br/>
physically and smashing the furniture? You didn&#39;t say, but I&#39;ll go with that<br/>
since its what I&#39;m familiar with. Ray did that sort of thing when he was younger<br/>
and &quot;passive&quot; parenting was disastrous! It amped up his uncertainty and sense of<br/>
being out of control. But the opposite of passive isn&#39;t controlling or<br/>
disciplining, its working with the child so that the child feels more in control<br/>
of his life and world.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue to consider is that the child in question has been in school - so<br/>
he&#39;s gone from a very regimented environment to something else and may be<br/>
reacting to the feeling that what little control he did have over his life is<br/>
now gone. So he&#39;s doing what people do in chaotic situations, he&#39;s trying to<br/>
Create a sense of control by lashing out - just as though he were in an abusive<br/>
environment or a war zone. That&#39;s not to say his home life is abusive (although<br/>
&quot;ODD&quot; can be a symptom of abuse, especially in boys) but that it may feel That<br/>
scary and out of control to him.<br/>
<br/>
What to do to help him feel more in control is going to depend on his Specific<br/>
needs, though. What helps him feel good and solid and stable? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93154599">Well this might be a bit off subject on this thread. But somewhere I felt a<br/>
bit connected regarding my son Ishaan who is almost five now. He is a pretty<br/>
imaginative child and has never been to school. He has always got along<br/>
better with older boys than with boys his age. So when we have kids his age<br/>
or perhaps girls his age come over or meet at other people&#39;s places, he<br/>
finds it difficult to find a game to his liking.<br/>
<br/>
Most of his games are creations of his favourite movies like those Night in<br/>
the Musuem, Madagascar or simply playing the engine driver of his<br/>
innumerable trains. Now most kids his age are not willing to play those kind<br/>
of games. One reason I figured out for that was that many of the moms<br/>
restrict their kids to a single room. Whereas my kids have the whole house<br/>
to play in. The other kids are at loss of &quot;what to do all the time in one<br/>
crammy room?&quot; . when their friends come over to our place I generally close<br/>
myself into my study and let them use the rest of the house except my<br/>
bedroom. I do not mind cleaning up later.<br/>
<br/>
The boys who come over sometime are happy playing the usual hide and seek or<br/>
some board game. Now my kids play other games of their own invention. so<br/>
when Ishaan cannot communicate this to those kids he generally throws a<br/>
tantrum. I try and mitigate by saying to the other kids  &quot;this is what he<br/>
means&quot; My daughter who is 9 also helps in such situations.<br/>
<br/>
But I also explain to Ishaan sometimes you have to play their kind of games<br/>
too or else no one might want to come over to our place. Otherwise I just<br/>
put on his favourite show on TV or DVD and let him not play at all. My<br/>
daughter is the follower by nature, so she continues to play with them.<br/>
<br/>
But I too feel it does get a bit out of hand at times when Ishaan just<br/>
screams or throws things around when no one wants to play his game. Any<br/>
suggestions how to handle it better and more effectively...<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that all their friends go to school and have pretty<br/>
strict rules to follow at home....<br/>
