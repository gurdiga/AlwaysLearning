<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should have seen that 10yo girl of ours chopping firewood, oak no less, <br/>
&gt; with an axe.  She has broad shoulders like her Daddy&#39;s sisters, and is strong as <br/>
&gt; a little bull from climbing trees.  Each morning she styled her hair and <br/>
&gt; freshened her make up.  She opted against bringing her black &quot;go-go boots&quot; with <br/>
&gt; no input from us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually we camped in the Manistee National Forest.  It&#39;s wilderness <br/>
&gt; camping, no water, elec or even outhouses.  Who wants a nasty outhouse anyway?  Best <br/>
&gt; of all NO ONE was there and it&#39;s free.  It was so deserted we could have <br/>
&gt; walked around nude, hubby said he&#39;d be interested in that!  You don&#39;t say!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Husband has been suffering with jock itch.  As we lounged in the dunes <br/>
&gt; watching spectacular Lake Mich, 10 yo dug sand for all her worth and I kept a <br/>
&gt; lookout so he could sun his &quot;gents,&quot; (I think she abbreviated &quot;genitals&#39; - quite <br/>
&gt; appropo) as daughter calls them.  I think it helped.  I told him he looked <br/>
&gt; like a pervert.  We tried to come up with a code word as warning for an <br/>
&gt; approaching person.  &quot;Land ho!&quot; was first, then, &quot;Walking the dog&quot; and then I told <br/>
&gt; him if someone approached I was going to yell, &quot;Cover up your penis!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sunday when we woke up we heard a couple of rifle shots far away and were a <br/>
&gt; little dismayed.  I thought it would be awful to be shot with your pants down <br/>
&gt; squatting in the woods.  (As if it wouldn&#39;t be awful any other time!)  <br/>
&gt; Headlines started emerging from our combined sleeping bags, &quot;Rochester woman shot <br/>
&gt; while shitting down&quot;  this from hubby:  &quot;Rochester woman loses left cheek&quot; <br/>
&gt; and my final: &quot;Cheeky Rochester woman loses it.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Mr. Cool&quot;  has been teaching himself web page design.  I remember him <br/>
&gt; sitting through math classes (gr 5-8 the same old shit for four years) pulling his <br/>
&gt; hair, he was so frustrated.  (He decided to start homescool for &quot;gr 9&quot;.)  He <br/>
&gt; got a gig with a company in town and he&#39;s doing an amazing job.  They&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; told him they&#39;ll pay him $75 for it, which is cheap by any standard, but good <br/>
&gt; bucks when you&#39;re 15 and you enjoy the work.  It could be a fabulous referral.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 10yo decided she&#39;s like to be in &quot;6th grade&quot; this year.  All that carefully <br/>
&gt; constructed bullshit the system promotes!  I&#39;m so glad she can see that the <br/>
&gt; emporer is naked....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fondly,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Retta<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the emperor, and apparently, your husband too LOL<br/>
<br/>
I want VERY much to hang out with your family. This cracked me up. You sound <br/>
like very cool people.<br/>
