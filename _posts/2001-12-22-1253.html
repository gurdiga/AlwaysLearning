<div id="ygrps-yiv-888855239"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;What is the viewpoint from one who believes there is no &quot;higher <br/>
&gt;&gt;power&quot;/force...something greater than ourselves?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t consider myself an atheist, but I also don&#39;t follow any <br/>
organized religion. And I don&#39;t even know if what I believe in would be <br/>
classified as a &quot;higher power&quot; or &quot;higher&quot; anything. I believe in the Tao. I <br/>
believe that it connects us all. I believe that many people believe <br/>
similarly, but do not use the same words as I do to describe it. Nor do they <br/>
have to. I still feel that connection. We are all part of this world. We <br/>
*are* connected. I don&#39;t need a set of rules or morals or divine <br/>
inspirations to tell me how to connect. I connect, by connecting. And I have <br/>
seen my children act with compassion and caring and selfless attention to <br/>
others. All without any commandments to do so. I believe it&#39;s within us all, <br/>
if we are open to believe it.<br/>
