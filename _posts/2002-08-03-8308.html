<div id="ygrps-yiv-279575978">That&#39;s a toughie. I&#39;ve done it twice; once when I had just one kid, and I<br/>
left him with grandparents and spent a day and a night in a cabin in a nice<br/>
little camp. I was bored stiff; wrote a little and read (usually I could<br/>
read till I drop and often do) and finally went into town and caught a<br/>
movie. The other was after our first year of homeschooling and I left the<br/>
kids with dh, spent the entire day in Barnes and Noble and then met a friend<br/>
for dinner and a movie. And yes, the house was trashed both times. What&#39;s up<br/>
with that?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always dreamed of going for a week to a retreat, but who knows how I&#39;d<br/>
do if there weren&#39;t movies available? I do better with mini-retreats, even<br/>
if it&#39;s just in the house or lunch to myself now. Or I catch a movie... :)<br/>

have some structured time, or sometimes just &quot;play&quot; time, but we go to a <br/>
reasonably nice hotel (with good packages or off-season rates. The Cape in <br/>
winter is great for this.) and hang out. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s WONDERFUL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368420918">My little sister got her father to pay her salary for<br/>
one year (last year) and quit her job as a librarian<br/>
to take the time for herself. Now that her &quot;sabatical&quot;<br/>
year is drawing to ta close her father is paying for<br/>
her to go to school for MA in art education.<br/>
<br/>
During this year she went scuba diving, visited lots<br/>
of her friends here and there....goofed off<br/>
lots....read almost nothing....sewed less than<br/>
usual...but got a big room all set up for in case she<br/>
felt like it....bought a new (older) house with an<br/>
inground swimming pool and had parties by and in the<br/>
pool.She ate in resteraunts and went to museums,<br/>
galleries and perforamnces a lot. She told me (past<br/>
tense) about lots of her good times. Visited theme<br/>
parks....went to puppeteering conferences....SLEPT<br/>
LATE EVERY day and took lots of naps. Didn&#39;t clean<br/>
house. But actually....this is not too different from<br/>
herself when she did work, except the the scuba<br/>
diving...which she isn&#39;t perseuing as she didn&#39;t like<br/>
it so much. Just too athletic. And no particular<br/>
schedule, except what she wanted. No transportation<br/>
provided for the kids, just herslef. She did have some<br/>
fibroids removed, laproscopically. And she did take<br/>
the time to SHOP for her doctors, for herself. She<br/>
told me it was a SABATICAL when she stopped doing for<br/>
others. But now she is in school doing what (I<br/>
confided was my fantasy...I want to  have an art(s and<br/>
crafts) &quot;school&quot; for children). Sigh. She will do well<br/>
with it, I am sure. She is sweet, personable,<br/>
charming, sociable, pretty, and she pays attention to<br/>
Roy without hurting his feelings..something few any of<br/>
my other realtives do (and I gratefull) But then she<br/>
does remember how hard she made my life when the older<br/>
boys were little.<br/>
<br/>
If I had the same, I suspect I would do differently,<br/>
but Roy is only 8, her youngest child (of 3)is 16. And<br/>
if someone paid my slalary for ayear it would be $0. <br/>
I suspect taking time for yourself with no money<br/>
doesn&#39;t really work ;-/ .  It might be a problem for<br/>
most stay-at-home-moms.  Also, her daddy paid for her<br/>
college, before and most of their first house and her<br/>
cars. She is his only child, and I refused to allow<br/>
him custody (he didn&#39;t DARE contest) when I legally<br/>
took her from Mother. Anyway...time off has to be paid<br/>
for somehow...her children have devoloped  some<br/>
problems as younge adults in the past year. Or mayabe<br/>
she is just more aware of the problems, now. Dunno.<br/>
They were day-care/public-school/so she could do her<br/>
stuff kids. Or maybe the problems are just more<br/>
interesting to talk about, now, that it is harder and<br/>
less expected to do personal intervention.?  Is that<br/>
always the cost for parents? I suspect it is. The<br/>
children are placed at risk when we, as parents, take<br/>
too much time out from being INVOLVED  parents.<br/>
Especially mothers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853542793">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I give myself beach camp.  Of course I&#39;m now down to one big kid - before I <br/>
had up to five.  When Trevor goes to his day camp right here in town, I drop <br/>
him off, and go directly to the beach.  No problems parking that early.  I go <br/>
for a long walk, and then read, write, listen to books on CD or tape -- or <br/>
sleep to the sound and smell of the ocean.  Sometimes I have a friend meet me <br/>
there for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Then I come back, pick him up and catch up on life.  It is much easier than <br/>
doing a chunk of time away -- and the only expense is the gas to get there.  <br/>
I love it, and feel very refreshed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I spent a 8 days alone to celebrate my 40th birthday in January.  The <br/>
thing is, you can&#39;t go for just one day.  You need a couple of days just <br/>
for the static to clear out of your head, and for your ears to stop <br/>
perking up at every little noise that you think might be some body, some <br/>
thing or some dog needing something from you.  And then you need a few <br/>
days just to get good and bored, and then you need the last few days to <br/>
get through that, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I actually didn&#39;t get too bored.  I read 10 books while I was away, and <br/>
I gave myself permission to not read the ones I brought and go to the <br/>
book store and buy more.  While I was at the book store, I came across a <br/>
book called &quot; The Marriage Sabbatical&quot;, which in some cosmic <br/>
Oprah-related coincidence turned out to be the book that planted the <br/>
idea in me for a sabbatical in the first place.  I recommend this book. <br/>
 And also &quot;The Women&#39;s Retreat Book&quot;.  (I&#39;m sure other people can tell <br/>
you the authors...I&#39;m terrible remembering them.)  <br/>
<br/>
I also read &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;, &quot;The Four Agreements&quot;, &quot;The Red <br/>
Tent&quot;, and &quot;Gift from the Sea&quot;, among others.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Corpus Christi, TX and rented part of a beach house, so I had <br/>
time and space to just hang out on the beach and fix myself simple food. <br/>
 There was no TV reception, so that worked out well.  I did find the <br/>
public library and send emails to my family keeping them updated.  I <br/>
rented a car so I could drive around, because that&#39;s good thinking time. <br/>
 I went to San Antonio and communed with the tourists, and Padre Island <br/>
seashore and communed with the hornets which were attracted to Burt&#39;s <br/>
Bees stuff in my backpack.  <br/>
<br/>
My idea was to let myself get completely bored, and then see what my <br/>
head would come up with.  The only thing I wouldn&#39;t allow myself to do <br/>
is go home early.  I ate well, drank good wine, burned candles.  The <br/>
only people I spoke to were waitpersons and the pesky guy who came to <br/>
paint the beachhouse, who kinda gave me the creeps.  <br/>
<br/>
The things my head came up with can&#39;t really be explained, but I still <br/>
feel refreshed and renewed.  It was a good experience, and my dh, who <br/>
would have never thought of such a thing, has decided he wants to do <br/>
something like it for his 40th next year.  I recommend it, for as long <br/>
as you can get away with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455083137">The last few years I&#39;ve had breaks by going to conferences. True it&#39;s work<br/>
but it does refresh me and give me a needed boost about research or<br/>
teaching. Last year I ended up spending one night a week away in Dubai<br/>
(about 2 hours away) and at first it was kind of neat but then got very<br/>
old. When I first started spending the night away I couldn&#39;t sleep as well<br/>
because it was so unusual NOT to be kicked or poked with little feet or<br/>
elbows. It was good because it made me realize that I actually missed it --<br/>
even though I still get annoyed sometimes at 3 am:)<br/>
<br/>
My mom and I just spent 10 days together in Europe and it was really nice.<br/>
Again it made me appreciate my kids so much more when I got back. But I<br/>
don&#39;t leave mine until they are somewhere between 3 and 5 years so with<br/>
another one due in a few months this was my last solo fling for awhile!<br/>
