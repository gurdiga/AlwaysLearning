<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377094803">&quot;Blah, blah, fricking BLAH.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ren wrote that, about parents saying things about Barbie and makeup.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to quote it.  &quot;Blah, blah, fricking BLAH.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I added a line to the &#39;how to screw it up&#39; list about talking TOO much  <br/>
to kids.   Explaining things they don&#39;t understand or don&#39;t care about  <br/>
or that seem crazy to them will sound like &quot;Blah, blah, fricking BLAH.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One guy (who might have joined this list, which would be fine) wrote  <br/>
that he always knelt down to talk to his child so he wasn&#39;t talking  <br/>
down to her.    &quot;Talking down&quot; to someone has little to do with  <br/>
relative height.  Sometimes when people write about problems they&#39;re  <br/>
having with their children and they tell the story, they&#39;ll use  <br/>
phrases like &quot;mommy needs her rest&quot; or &quot;this is bothering  <br/>
brother.&quot;     Children will learn to speak properly sooner and more  <br/>
easily if their mothers speak English as it was intended, too.    **It  <br/>
bothers Sandra when other mommykins talk baby talk to their babas and  <br/>
then ask listowner how their babyses can learn to use their right  <br/>
words to mama.**<br/>
<br/>
Words have power, and sometimes it&#39;s the power to make life  <br/>
irritating, and to make communication insipid.  It can make the child  <br/>
think the mom isn&#39;t very bright.  It sets a separation between the  <br/>
things you want the child to know are communicated toward him (the  <br/>
baby talk) and real world communications (when you start using  <br/>
personal pronouns and names).  Let the world be all one thing.  Let  <br/>
your children be a part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Something I wrote in the Barbie discussion, to Ren, was:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You have politely or tactfully said that a parent&#39;s judgment causes a  <br/>
child to doubt herself. In my life, my self confidence was strong, and  <br/>
my mother&#39;s judgment caused me to doubt her, and then resent her, and  <br/>
eventually to ignore her opinion entirely. That never did hurt me,  <br/>
though, nor her, because her mothering instinct was never switched on  <br/>
well at all, though she had three children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is possible, I know from my own experience, for a child to have  <br/>
little regard for a parent&#39;s opinion.  Make your opinions valuable by  <br/>
not expressing worthless opinions.   Tadaa!  Easy!<br/>

  ***************This is so true. I talked to my babies right from the start like they were people. I mean obviously they are people but they aren&#39;t always perceived that way.<br/>
<br/>
  I would carry them around, tell them what I was doing, point things out. I didn&#39;t use baby talk, I used real words.<br/>
<br/>
  My kids all speak very well and use a variety of words.<br/>

  &quot;It&#39;s not that I feel that school is a good idea gone wrong,&quot; he says, &quot;but a wrong idea from the word go. It&#39;s a nutty notion that we can have a place where nothing but learning happens, cut off from the rest of life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503437685">I totally agree about baby-talk being disrespectful and counterproductive.<br/>
I spoke to my kids with the same level of respect and using the same<br/>
language as my partner, while in the sling.  My expectations for their<br/>
responses was fairly realistic.  But I still remember when my oldest used<br/>
the word exacerbate at the playground--he was two and a half!<br/>
I also remember a dad trying to teach his infant French.  He wasn&#39;t French,<br/>
and the broken French was so painful to hear.  I understand if one&#39;s<br/>
cultural heritage is involved and speaking two or three languages is common,<br/>
like in Switzerland, but it seems silly to want your child &quot;fluent&quot; in a<br/>
language you can&#39;t speak.  I think communication is the key to learning to<br/>
speak and any other agenda should be on hold.<br/>

This is true!  Here&#39;s a perfect example.  About a year ago when Mia was 6, I wanted to educate her on the evils of sweatshop, child labour, etc.  She often asked me why I didn&#39;t like them, and I would tell her that Barbie was not made with love, but by some poor individual working a job they didn&#39;t like for close to no money.  One night I sat her on my knee at the computer while I perused the net to find some sort of image to support my statements.  I figured something visual would have more of a lasting impact.  I asked her what she thought of it all and she responded along the lines of, &quot;Can you show me pictures of them making a Barbie?&quot;   &#39;Blah, blah, fricking BLAH&#39; alright!  Her focus was on how the dolls are made, not the plight of the worker.  The lesson I learnt was load and clear -- &quot;DON&#39;T PREACH!!&quot;  I very quickly hopped off my soap box.  I was doing *exactly* what most dislike; being told what to think.  Absolutely NOT unschooling.  Needless to say I do a lot more listening, and a lot less talking!<br/>

I believe there are much better ways to help a country become progressive personally, but it&#39;s good to look at lots of different views and not get too entrenched in our own &quot;values&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Yes you can. The recent DVD release of &quot;Barbie in A Christmas Carol&quot; has a <br/>
featurette about the most recent Holiday Barbie being designed. A lucky mom <br/>
and daughter pair of collectors got to go behind the scenes at Mattel HQ and <br/>
see the prototype being designed, following the process from the costumer, <br/>
the makeup artist, the hair stylist (sewing into the head) and the packaging <br/>
makers. There may not be love in the factory in China, but there is in the <br/>
design center in California.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135541610">Our prejudice against sweatshops and call centers in India and such  <br/>
parallels the prejudices against &quot;primitive cultures&quot; by the  <br/>
Victorians.   It&#39;s not a good topic for this list, really, except to  <br/>
remind people to try not to assume that everyone wants to be like we  <br/>
are, or could if they wanted to, or that American &quot;compassion&quot; for  <br/>
undeveloped nations doesn&#39;t have a hefty base of job protection.    <br/>
International business is all the rage on the news (TV, newspaper,  <br/>
magazine, internet, radio) so take it with a grain of salt, don&#39;t get  <br/>
emotional if it doesn&#39;t directly affect your family and don&#39;t burden  <br/>
your kids with things that will have changed twice or three times by  <br/>

<br/>
I think the book I mentioned over there was Why Globalization Works by  <br/>
Martin Wolf, but if I&#39;d been thinking more carefully when I posted I&#39;d  <br/>
have been clear that my point wasn&#39;t to get into a pro/anti-buy-from- <br/>
China argument, but to say that when it comes to dealing with our kids  <br/>
it can help to remember that perfectly reasonable, smart, well- <br/>
informed people (experts even!) can have a different perspective than  <br/>
we do. How that works for me is that I try to remember that no matter  <br/>
how much I think I know about something or how strongly I feel about  <br/>
it, I could very well be wrong. Or, more likely, there are  <br/>
perspectives I haven&#39;t thought of or been exposed to.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t give my kids my radical ideological version of things (not  <br/>
even about unschooling!), and I stay open to the possibility that they  <br/>
will disagree with me about some things. I wouldn&#39;t give one of my  <br/>
kids the &quot;that Barbie was made by an exploited child&quot; talk in part  <br/>
because I have read a whole lot about globalization with the result  <br/>
that, while I am concerned about child labor and other labor abuses, I  <br/>
am also mindful of the enormous benefits to many Chinese people from  <br/>
the liberalization of their economy. Globalization is one of many  <br/>
issues that, the more I have tried to educate myself about it, open- <br/>
mindedly reading materials from a number of experts who have varying  <br/>
perspectives, the less I know what I should think or do!<br/>

Su -- you weren&#39;t unschooled by any chance???<br/>
<br/>
Years ago I crashed and burned (pre-kiddies) and suffered a devastating depressive episode.  I remember at the time, the most scariest thing about it all, was my fear of not *knowing*.  Not only the building blocks of my life over my (then) 26 years of life had fallen, but the very foundation crumbled and it was all a little scary, to say the least!  What if everything I *knew* was wrong?  Who was I to *tell* someone how it all is?  In hindsight, it was THE best thing that happened to me!  It triggered a questioning of everything.  My foundations are no longer *solid*, but bendy, stretchy!  I like being bendy, stretchy, because it allows me to see through new eyes.  Unfortunately, every now and then my foundations start to solidify.  My kids do a pretty good job of knocking them down!  For the more *set* pieces, seasoned unschoolers such as yourself pound them down!  Love it!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me it wasn&#39;t a depressive episode--it was being extremely  <br/>
ideological in my early and mid-20s. I was radical feminist/lesbian  <br/>
separatist--I wouldn&#39;t read books by men, listen to music with men&#39;s  <br/>
voices, let men in my house, I thought women who had children were  <br/>
just pawns of the patriarchy, believed women in America were an  <br/>
oppressed class akin to, say, slaves in ancient Egypt.  Gradually I  <br/>
realized how wrong I was about so many things (hello! married to a  <br/>
man! three children! best friend is a man! some of my favorite books  <br/>
are by men! recently discovered the music of Del McCoury, who is a  <br/>
man, and can&#39;t get enough! Stay-at-home mom, which is in some sense  <br/>
just the new PC word for &quot;housewife&quot;!). I thought lesbians were the  <br/>
highest evolution of humanity.<br/>
<br/>
My best friend (and lover for a long time) back then used to joke that  <br/>
she was going to have &quot;Dyke&quot; tattoo&#39;d on her arm, and if she ever  <br/>
decided she wasn&#39;t a lesbian anymore, she&#39;d just cut her arm off.<br/>
<br/>
Ha ha ha ha. Joke&#39;s on us--he&#39;s a man now. (still my best friend)<br/>
<br/>
At our house, we never say &quot;never&quot; anymore, having had to eat our  <br/>
words too many times in the past. Heck, David and I are big ol&#39;  <br/>
homebodies and yet we both, independently, recently started to think  <br/>
that it would be a neat thing to take the kids somewhere overseas to  <br/>
live for awhile in a few years. Maybe we&#39;ll do it; maybe we won&#39;t. But  <br/>
not that long ago, we would have said, &quot;Our ideal vacation takes place  <br/>
within three hours of home and lasts no more than 5 days. We would  <br/>
never travel abroad for months on end.&quot; Now we can&#39;t say &quot;never&quot; about  <br/>
that anymore--we can imagine it now, at least. [*cough* midlife crisis  <br/>

<br/>
But it was that sense that I could not have believed any harder in the  <br/>
things I believed, and they were wrong. Some things had a kernel of  <br/>
truth stretched to an outrageous extreme; some didn&#39;t even have that  <br/>
kernel. And some really were man-hating dressed up in a veneer of what  <br/>
we called &quot;woman-loving.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So now, whatever I believe, there&#39;s this little bit of, &quot;Wow, I was  <br/>
really wrong back then. I could be wrong about this, too.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471448361">HA Su That is a great story!<br/>
 <br/>
When I was young I did NOT want to have kids at all. I wanted to be a career woman because that was what i wanted. I even graduated from Law School in Brazil!<br/>
I pestered my friends that co-slept and told them to let their kids Cry It Out between other things.<br/>
I have called every friend I had and apologized for it.<br/>
I also had no compassion for stay at home moms with a messy house - that was a biggie.<br/>
Well come take a look at my house!...and its not even bad today......<br/>
I was also a big city girl that loved surfing and the beach could never see my self anywhere far from the Ocean.<br/>
Here I am in Minnesota , living in a Dairy Farm in a small town and with my own big vegetable garden.<br/>
I now say never say never......<br/>

Garak, who is not human and has never heard the fable before, <br/>
replied: &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s the point, Doctor?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bashir said: &quot;Of course.  What else could it be?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Garak:  &quot;That you should never tell the same lie twice.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, for sure:  lecturing people does not work!<br/>

Just yesterday I was trying to make a point while talking with Ethan. I<br/>
tapped his knee and said, &quot;Did I tap your knee?&quot;<br/>

Ethan: &quot;I dunno. Maybe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Me: &quot;Ethan, really, it was me. I&#39;m the only person who could have done it.&quot;<br/>

Ethan: &quot;No you&#39;re not. Maybe a ghost did it.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Ethan: &quot;Right. There&#39;s lots of things we don&#39;t know and can&#39;t prove and you<br/>
can&#39;t say for sure that there aren&#39;t ghosts. Maybe one just controlled your<br/>
hand and tapped my knee.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Ummm. OK, but I know I did it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ethan: &quot;At least you think you know you did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I have to tell Ethan the phrase &quot;Blah, blah, fricking BLAH.&quot; He always<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s good to be as clear and honest as possible in discussions such as  <br/>
these, and even though it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone else or spoil the  <br/>
discussion, noticing when one is exaggerating or generalizing is  <br/>
valuable in thinking and seeing more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-He generally says it to me in reference to<br/>
something I&#39;ve said or if he&#39;s recounting something that happened. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I say it about a story I&#39;m telling sometimes when I get to the part  <br/>
where they already know or don&#39;t care, and it&#39;s like &quot;time passed&quot;  <br/>
until I get to the next better part of the story.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of what would happen if I said it to my husband or  <br/>
one of my kids or one of my friends.   I can think of a couple of  <br/>
people I could envision saying it to in certain circumstances, but it  <br/>
would be an indicator that I thought they weren&#39;t really thinking  <br/>
about what they were saying.<br/>
<br/>
Relationships can be built up or torn down, and helping our children  <br/>
see which is what is helpful to everyone concerned.<br/>

I suspected that it was going to be along these lines, with humor and in <br/>
appropriate situations.<br/>
<br/>
However I think it&#39;s important not to leave an unclear story hanging in the <br/>
air to avoid creating yet another stupid myth about unschoolers along the <br/>
lines of &quot;unschoolers don&#39;t care if their kids are rude to people&quot; sitting <br/>
up there beside &quot;unschoolers let their kids run wild&quot; and &quot;unschoolers don&#39;t <br/>
