Surgeons Who Play Video Games Err Less<br/>
<br/>
Research Shows Playing Video Games Leads to Fewer<br/>
Mistakes on the Operating Table<br/>
<br/>
NEW YORK April 6 ï¿½ All those years on the couch<br/>
playing Nintendo and PlayStation appear to be paying<br/>
off for surgeons. Researchers found that doctors who<br/>
spent at least three hours a week playing video games<br/>
made about 37 percent fewer mistakes in laparoscopic<br/>
surgery and performed the task 27 percent faster than<br/>
their counterparts who did not play video games...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195692604">That is SO COOL.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are MUCH better drivers than I was when I started driving.  Some of <br/>
it might just be better spatial reasoning skills inherited from their dad.  But <br/>
their dad was quite accident prone as a young driver.  I had several in-yard, <br/>
in-driveway, in-parking-lot &quot;oopses&quot; when I was a teen, and Kirby has had <br/>
zero in over a year, not one bump.  And Marty has driven already (with a <br/>
learner&#39;s permit) in some serious rush-hour (serious for Albuquerque/Rio Rancho &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
and on I-25 75 mph on a dark night with big trucks for four hours.   He&#39;s <br/>
hardly even nervous and he does very well.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s because of video games.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned it to them, and Kirby said all the cars are driving with you, not <br/>
against you.  Nobody else WANTS to get in an accident.  It&#39;s quite <br/>
cooperative.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The second is factually more accurate, but I would fear having the <br/>
grandparents jump on the kids with that one. We&#39;ve heard of some that <br/>
have.  The top one communicates &quot;The buck stops here.&quot; and doesn&#39;t <br/>
encourage the grandparents to undermine the family nearly as badly.<br/>
