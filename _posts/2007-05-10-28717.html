<div id="ygrps-yiv-443394127">I have read with fascination the on-going saga of TV and yesterday I <br/>
was listening to NPR and heard a conversation with a young man <br/>
called either &quot;Long Long&quot; or &quot;Lang Lang&quot;.  He&#39;s supposed to one of <br/>
the worlds best piano players and the reason he started playing <br/>
piano was really young because he saw the Tom and Jerry Cartoon on <br/>
TV where Tom is playing really fast and well and it inspired him to <br/>
become a professional concert player....<br/>
<br/>
Just shows how something I would consider uninspiring (Tom and <br/>
Jerry) is so inspiring for someone else!!!<br/>
<br/>
Loved what those of you who have been self directed learners for <br/>
years had to say and to question.... Those are the people I respect.<br/>
<br/>
Off to watch my TV TIVO recording of Medium.... I&#39;m sure someone&#39;s <br/>
thinking it&#39;s a waste of time (LOL).<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
