<div id="ygrps-yiv-747097029">***-=-In that case, one thing she might consider is to negotiate with her<br/>
husband face to face without lawyers present. I did that ... in the<br/>
lawyer&#39;s office. I sprung it on them and asked him directly if I<br/>
could talk with him privately. Brian and I had not seen each other<br/>
for months, and he felt that he would be fine with me on his own for a<br/>
few minutes. I think he was also curious. Several things being in my<br/>
favor, our meeting was ok not harmful to either of us.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a helpful response. It&#39;s just a response. &lt;g&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean, Sandra, but I did what the OP did here and what really helped in my divorce was letting her know that I didn&#39;t hate her, didn&#39;t blame her, wasn&#39;t mad at her, and that I still loved her even if we couldn&#39;t live together.  I think it really helped diffuse the situation and helped us get past any antagonism and work towards focusing on the kids and making the divorce as pain-free for them as possible.  That meant being kind to each other, respecting each other, not bad-mouthing each other, not putting the kids in the middle, and maintaining peaceful homes on both ends.  It also meant that we weren&#39;t going to disrupt their lives by sticking them in school, we weren&#39;t going to argue over custody and child support, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Amicable divorces ARE possible in some cases, if the adults can get past their own issues and focus on the kids.  I found that as unschoolers we were able to do that because of the relationship we had with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m aware that staying married would have been better for the family, but a marriage can&#39;t work when one party has decided that working together to save the marriage isn&#39;t worth the effort, that counseling is out, that things are just over.  Sometimes crap happens and you have to deal with the fallout.  I think some of these &#39;you have to put the kids in school&#39; are more a way for one parent to control the other than because they are truly concerned with how homeschooling/unschooling is going, and they know the courts will usually side with them.  One final &#39;ha ha, I won!&#39; sort of thing.  Diffusing that stuff up front can really help.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s very difficult and can make unschooling impossible for<br/>
most people to have as their lives become something like in that list<br/>
of worse case scenarios:<br/>
<br/>
Poverty<br/>
Mental Illness (including destructive self-medication thereof)<br/>
Single Parenting<br/>
Divorced Parenting (amicable)<br/>
Divorced Parenting (antagonistic)-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a really important distinction above....  between single and<br/>
divorced parenting, which is not the same.  Divorced parenting is only<br/>
technically &quot;single parenting&quot; and not generally single in reality..<br/>
there&#39;s remarriage and also in the meantime there&#39;s probably both<br/>
parents --along with their respective incomes-- involved in their<br/>
children&#39;s lives in some way.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another distinction .. whether the divorce is amicable or<br/>
antagonistic makes a world of difference to the outcome in family<br/>
relationships.  I know only a handful of amicable divorces where the<br/>
kids are happy with both parents and well cared for.  I don&#39;t know any<br/>
antagonistic divorces with happy kids and intact family connections.<br/>
<br/>
One friend has a family of 5 and had divorced in the early 90s.  Then<br/>
she had a catastrophic car wreck ... which made it extremely difficult<br/>
to continue homeschooling (very relaxed eclectic with unschooly<br/>
parenting style).  After the youngest were older, the children finally<br/>
went to school to ease things for their mother who has major spinal<br/>
injuries.  The whole time, some kids lived with their mom and others<br/>
lived 3 houses down with their dad.  They had perfect freedom to be<br/>
with either parent at anytime.  I would say their family remains<br/>
largely intact despite the divorce.<br/>
<br/>
Most divorces aren&#39;t anything like that but are rageful and<br/>
destructive --- antagonistic.  I do think it&#39;s worth it try one&#39;s<br/>
utmost to make as much peace as can possibly be had.  Our divorce<br/>
started out very badly.  I was not at all assured that Brian could be<br/>
calmed or reasoned with.  Now we&#39;re back together, working things out.<br/>
 There was infidelity involved too, not wonderful, not the end of the<br/>
world, something we both learned a lot from (not a recommended path<br/>
though).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s up to a friend to guide another into doing their<br/>
utmost to make peace.  Some people just can&#39;t imagine or can&#39;t go<br/>
there, so they don&#39;t.  The example of my friend&#39;s amicable divorce<br/>
years and years ago was very helpful to me once things went bad<br/>
between me and Brian.  She and I talked a good bit about how to<br/>
improve our situation.  And that was very helpful.<br/>

<br/>
Even from their point of view, unschooling itself can be difficult to<br/>
express outside the home.  At least that&#39;s the way it is around here.<br/>
:)  I don&#39;t like to use the word much because alternative paths don&#39;t<br/>
get much respect, excite curiosity or generate fun in certain social<br/>
circles.<br/>
<br/>
Which can be fine for us nonetheless.  We just don&#39;t hang out very<br/>

You&#39;re right that it wasn&#39;t a bad unschooling decision, then.  It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t an unschooling decision to say they didn&#39;t have to go to school  <br/>
anymore.<br/>

this list.  That&#39;s not the purpose.  But if there&#39;s ANY compulsory  <br/>
attendance law where you are, to have an exception is likely going to  <br/>
be something both parents have to agree to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the case of your friend, if a father insists on his kids being in<br/>
school, then the mother should make every effort to get them there and<br/>
any decisions her kids make about dropping out will be obviously their<br/>
own.  She should encourage the children to do their best and if the<br/>
case can be made in court, they might be able to do the homeschooling<br/>
thing they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
In court, the mother can present the wonderful thing they *were* doing<br/>
before school went into effect.... and records from some accredited<br/>
place like Clonlara could help in that presentation.<br/>
<br/>
Then in court it won&#39;t look like it was the mother holding up the<br/>
school process.  Once court is in session, the mother won&#39;t have any<br/>
chance to change that.  AND guaranteed every moment of the mother&#39;s<br/>
resistance to the idea of school will be held up for review in court.<br/>

<br/>
The most important person she could present this to is the father of<br/>
their children.  Ultimately the court may decide whatever they decide,<br/>
and the parents can still agree to something else together or go back<br/>
to court later or whatever.  If she can convince the father that the<br/>
kids *are* learning and aren&#39;t suffering from their unschooling path,<br/>
that would make a world of difference.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of parents without a hint of divorce in the air who<br/>
find the need to reassure the co parent of unschooling&#39;s good (lack of<br/>
harm).<br/>
<br/>
Do all in your power to present unschooling well.<br/>
