<div id="ygrps-yiv-751957456">Two good links, links I liked, are gone now.<br/>
<br/>
One was the Texas unschooling link.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.texasunschoolers.com/">http://www.texasunschoolers.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Is it just totally and forever gone, or moved?<br/>
<br/>
The other is/was this:<br/>
The Inspirit site has information on the book Christian Unschooling -  <br/>
Growing Your Children in the Freedom of Christ, and there is a review  <br/>
on a different site, with other useful links (links page on Christian  <br/>
Unschooling) for Christians.<br/>
<br/>
All gone.  I tried google but only found book sales sites.<br/>
<br/>
I can pull them off my pages if they&#39;re just plain gone.<br/>
<br/>
What can I put on the local page for Texas though?<br/>
