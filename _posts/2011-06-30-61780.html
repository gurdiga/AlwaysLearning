I love reading the group and thinking about the the posts and learning about new stuff and new ways of being.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who posts get dissected and those who do the dissecting. Taking bits and parts helps to clarify my own thoughts about certain topics and issues. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who&#39;ve gone before and whose children are grown for continuing to be a part of this list and sharing your experiences.  <br/>

Even though all the topics may not apply to me directly they can still help with nuggets of wisdom generally applied.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362002371">I whole heartedly agree with you. I have been reading posts on this group for two years and have found the information so invaluable.  Unschooling and Always Learning have helped to breathe new life into our family. Thank you.<br/>
Cathy and family.<br/>
