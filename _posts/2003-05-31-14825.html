&gt; How come wrong numbers are never busy?<br/>
&gt; Do people in Australia call the rest of the world &quot;upover&quot;?<br/>
&gt; Does killing time damage eternity?<br/>
&gt; Why doesn&#39;t Tarzan have a beard?<br/>
&gt; Why is it that night falls but day breaks?<br/>
&gt; Why is the third hand on the watch called a secondhand?<br/>
&gt; Why is lemon juice made with artificial flavor, and dish washing liquid made <br/>
&gt; with real<br/>
&gt; lemons?<br/>
&gt; Are part-time bandleaders semi-conductors?<br/>
&gt; Can you buy an entire chess set in a pawn shop?<br/>
&gt; Daylight savings time - why are they saving it and where do they keep it?<br/>
&gt; Do jellyfish get gas from eating jellybeans?<br/>
&gt; Do pilots take crash-courses?<br/>
&gt; Do you think that when they asked George Washington for ID that he just <br/>
&gt; whipped out a quarter?<br/>
&gt; Have you ever seen a toad on a toadstool?<br/>
&gt; How do you write zero in Roman numerals?<br/>
&gt; How many weeks are there in a light year?<br/>
&gt; If Barbie&#39;s so popular, why do you have to buy all her friends?<br/>
&gt; If cats and dogs didn&#39;t have fur would we still pet them? <br/>

are always coming up with these types of questions. I recently asked a friend, <br/>
if you are pre-menopausal or post-menopausal, when are you just menopausal? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting this to several lists so if you get it more than once, I <br/>
apologize.<br/>

&lt;&lt; One of the ones I picked up was George Carlin&#39;s. Julian had never heard <br/>
him, <br/>
and LOVED it....played it over and over again. It&#39;s fun watching Julian <br/>
listen <br/>
to something like that that he finds REALLY funny....he just is overcome with <br/>
laughter.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Marty had a George Carlin binge a year or so ago.  I bought him the newest, a <br/>
two-CD collection, a book, and he was AMAZED that I had a couple of George <br/>
Carlin LPs (AND some Cheech and Chong!)    Points for mom that month.<br/>
