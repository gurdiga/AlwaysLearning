<div id="ygrps-yiv-675516692">These made me think &quot;Thanks, but no thanks&quot; LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the encouraging comments.  I&#39;m planning<br/>
a short thanks.  Along the lines of &quot;Thank you for<br/>
your concern.  The kids really liked the outfits you<br/>
sent. blah blah blah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mom had been warning me about this letter for<br/>
months & I actually spent a lot of time worrying about<br/>
it.  Why?  I don&#39;t know.  I think now that I must have<br/>
thought she might have had some valid arguments I was<br/>
going to agree with.  But her letter was so far over<br/>
the top that I ...well, I want to say speechless.  But<br/>
no, that isn&#39;t quite it.  Astonished, maybe. <br/>
Flabbergasted.  That is a little closer to the mark. <br/>
I finally got some post-it notes & while reading the<br/>
second half of the letter, wrote my &quot;replies&quot; to some<br/>
of her arguments.(page 8 was just where I quit reading<br/>
for awhile.  It actually is 14 pages plus numerous<br/>
newspaper articles which she cut out and highlighted<br/>
for me!)  <br/>
<br/>
My dh & I were tempted to write an equally lengthy<br/>
reply, but it would be wasted effort.  They have never<br/>
once asked WHY we decided to homeschool/unschool. <br/>
They are just sure we are wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is the P.S. Kim is dh&#39;s sister.  They have one<br/>
child, Will, who is 10.  <br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Have you truly investigated Mostessori schooling? <br/>
Discovery learning is its main goal.  Kim&#39;s family<br/>
strongly feel it is highly beneficial.  Are you<br/>
dismissing this as a possibility for your children<br/>
simply because of Chris&#39;     family&#39;s endorsement or<br/>
do you have some valid reasons?    Montessori<br/>
schooling has the potential to satisfy all of our<br/>
dreams.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
AHHHHH!  All of WHOSE dreams!  <br/>
<br/>
I love this list.  Oh, and fyi, my lovely children are<br/>
Sierra, who is 5 1/2 & Quentin, who just turned 8 1/2<br/>
last Friday.  <br/>
<br/>
Off to homeschool park day -<br/>

<br/>
Our park day was also today.  When there were bumps and bruises the crying children were comforted by coming back to their mothers (and some fathers).  Which leads me to wonder *whose* dream is being satisfied by separating children from parents?  Why are some people certain that it&#39;s better for children to have detactched (and interchangeable) teacher rather than strong family connections?<br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t our parental goal to help them be all they can be?<br/>
<br/>
Starting in 6th grade (when they first &quot;allowed&quot; you to select <br/>
courses), I spent years trying to get public school counsellors to <br/>
help me figure out what I what I wanted to &quot;be&quot;, so that I could <br/>
choose the courses that would help me prepare. My senior year of high <br/>
school, I finally did only what I had to, to get out. And this was in <br/>
one of the top schools in the state! I can&#39;t expect it to be much <br/>
different today.<br/>
<br/>
Keep sending your family loving notes attached to articles about <br/>
successful homeschoolers! Eventually they&#39;ll catch on!<br/>

Happy learning!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-449255113">Oh--I am so busy I usually lurk but the word Montessori got me <br/>
started.  :-)  I am working with a Montessori teacher--she&#39;s been <br/>
teaching Montessori methodolgy to HOMESCHOOLERS for about 30 years <br/>
now (as well as at the schools she&#39;s worked with).  And I love what I <br/>
have seen--because as I begin to try these things out slowly on my dd <br/>
who is nearly 3 I am seeing wonderful improvements in her--especially <br/>
in her confidence levels.  (Ok--so she&#39;s thrilled I let her scrub <br/>
veggies and wash her own face!)  But did you know anyone can use the <br/>
word Montessori and open a school under the Montessori name?  Not all <br/>
schools are created equal.  As I am still setting up my homeschool <br/>
plan (my ds is 7 months old), my friend, the Montessori teacher, is <br/>
taking me on  tours of local Montessori schools.  Maria Montessori <br/>
developed her system in the early 1900s--and didn&#39;t copyright a thing-<br/>
-so there are a great many out there not teaching the Montessori <br/>
methods and still raking in the Montessori bucks.  I do not claim to <br/>
know everything about Montessori--or even much at all--and I <br/>
recognise that to do things the way Maria Montessori teaches requires <br/>
at least 20 children in order to do it properly (as my friend <br/>
constantly points out to me).  But from what I do see and from what I <br/>
do understand--there is absolutely not one thing wrong with using the <br/>
Montessori training methods at home.  And for my friend teaching <br/>
Montessori to homeschoolers has worked so well that she is now <br/>
teaching the children of her former students--at home.<br/>
I am not trying to advocate Montessori over any other method--for me <br/>
it was a place to begin for my children because of my friend.  I have <br/>
unschooled myself ever since about 5th-6th grade--when public schools <br/>
began and continued to let me down.  Imagine my surprise when <br/>
vocational schools and college classes also let me down when I fell <br/>
under pressure to conform and &#39;earn&#39; a &#39;proper education&#39;.  I am an <br/>
eclectic learner--and I&#39;ve never tried to teach anyone other than <br/>
myself--which is why I have been reaching out to every resource I <br/>
know in order to find something that will work for us--until the kids <br/>
look at me and say I want to do this--otherwise every moment with <br/>
them has been and always shall be a learning experience on both sides-<br/>
-but now I have a model upon which to structure things--in case I <br/>
ever need to explain to the state here&#39;s what we do and why.<br/>
That&#39;s just my 2 cents worth--thank you for listening.<br/>
Namaste--<br/>
