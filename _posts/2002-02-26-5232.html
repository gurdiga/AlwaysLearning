<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285512328">Some of you may want to reconsider eating those fruits and veggies South of <br/>
the border.<br/>
In several tests they have been shown to have LESS pesticides than their U.S. <br/>
counterparts.<br/>
Why?<br/>
Well all those chemicals cost a whole lot of money, something we have and <br/>
many farmers South of the border don&#39;t.<br/>
So it has less to do with regulations and more to do with availability and <br/>
access.<br/>
Grapes from Chile almost ALWAYS have less residue than the American ones.<br/>
You&#39;re probably safer with almost anything imported actually.<br/>
Hmmmm?<br/>
I would go organic if I could.....it&#39;s still best to eat lots of fruits and <br/>
veggies even if they&#39;re sprayed.<br/>
And the government is actually starting to revamp how we judge the safety <br/>
limit of pesticide/insecticide residue. They are coming up with a system that <br/>
looks at ALL of the different residue on one fruit or veggie instead of each <br/>
substance separately.<br/>
It&#39;ll probably take years for them to figure it out though...duh.<br/>
