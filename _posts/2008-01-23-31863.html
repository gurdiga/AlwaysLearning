<div id="ygrps-yiv-988454109">Both Simon and Linnaea really liked the Usborne picture dictionaries for English. They were sort of find the object books, maybe the French and Spanish books are equally fun to cuddle up with and wander through. <br/>

Is your 4 year old plus interested in learning a foreign language? You may want to think about why you are wanting to get a 4 year old to master a foreign language, or at least to acquire some knowledge of a foreign language. I took years and years of foreign language and the words that stick the best are the ones I used in Japan when we lived there, and I never studied Japanese, and I was 31 when we went there. Simon and Linnaea like to play with the sounds of other languages, and David and I know a couple of words here and there of a few different languages, but they don&#39;t have any desire to learn anything other than who to get by in the UK, the US and Australia at the moment. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>For what it&#39;s worth, Rowan&#39;s discovery of Dora the Explorer coincided<br/>
fortuitously with a trip to Puerto Rico (when he was four), and the moment<br/>
he connected the dots and realized that the words he sorta kinda was<br/>
learning a little in Dora could be used to actually talk to and interact<br/>
with the people in Puerto Rico, the lightbulb was just amazing. =) He<br/>
insisted on being spoken to in Spanish, learning vocabulary, and just<br/>
generally being a sponge.<br/>
<br/>
That was a year ago. He still is completely obsessed with Spanish language<br/>
learning, by way of Dora, talking to people, and asking people to look words<br/>
up for him in a spanish-english dictionary we have. He&#39;s not learning<br/>
structure so much, just vocab, pronunciation, and social use. I&#39;m totally<br/>
impressed, because being a book learner myself, words don&#39;t stick in my head<br/>
unless I see them written down. Rowan is doing his thing completely by ear,<br/>
and his retention of what he hears is just amazing. But this has been a<br/>
really valuable lesson to me in not assuming my kids need what I needed to<br/>
cover the same territory.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s interesting is that this has given him a confidence about language.<br/>
When we were discussing Japan, and listening to Japanese 101 podcasts, he<br/>
was sorta interested, but his take was that &quot;I&#39;ll learn that when we get<br/>
there.&quot; Because he has gone someplace, and picked up enough language to be<br/>
conversational, he knows he can do it no matter where he goes or what they<br/>
speak there. It&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>

need to be able to read to use it.  Wasn&#39;t sure if you were referring  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853560067">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a member here for a while -- &quot;lurking&quot; -- I guess. My name is <br/>
Janelle and my 2 1/2 year old daughter is Winter. I found this group by <br/>
looking for some homeschooling information, and I&#39;ve learned a lot, and <br/>
ordered &quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; and &quot;Learning all the Time,&quot; which I haven&#39;t <br/>
read yet. I had never heard of unschooling before, so I don&#39;t feel like <br/>
I am ready to add anything yet. I&#39;m still soaking it all up. It&#39;s been <br/>
great reading everyone&#39;s messages. Thanks a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to reply to this post because I do have &quot;Muzzy&quot; in Spanish. <br/>
Since my daughter is so young, we just watch the DVD&#39;s and read the <br/>
book, which is the script. I&#39;ve checked out the CD-ROM with her, but so <br/>
far it&#39;s nothing she&#39;s been able to really do. I do like it, though, <br/>
and think it can be handy in the future if she&#39;s interested. She likes <br/>
me to read the script to her, too, and has asked to watch the DVD&#39;s <br/>
MANY times over. I think they can soak up a lot from those. It&#39;s pretty <br/>
expensive overall, I think, for what you get -- maybe Ebay would have <br/>
some for better. <br/>
<br/>
I also got some French and Spanish audio CD&#39;s from a catalog called <br/>
Magic Cabin. They have a website, and I ordered them on-line. They <br/>
are &quot;Magic French (Spanish) for Kids&quot; and &quot;Fun French (Spanish) for <br/>
Kids.&quot; So far, I like these, too, they have dialog and music, and I <br/>
think they can pick all of this up from just listening to it. I also <br/>
got their books &quot;First 100 Words in Spanish (French).&quot; This is only <br/>
basic vocabulary, but I like the books.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing -- if you can find a cute picture dictionary -- I dug up <br/>
an old one while cleaning my garage -- my sister&#39;s. Every word has a <br/>
picture and a sentence. My daughter likes me to read it to her, just <br/>
like a story. I guess it helps with the book readings if you can speak <br/>
the languages enough to model it for them. I&#39;ve also checked out really <br/>
simple story books and fairy tales from the library. These are great. <br/>
One of them came with an audio tape, which she could listen to, and <br/>
when I got the book without the tape and was unsure of some of the <br/>
pronunciations, I checked it out again to refresh myself.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is really long -- sorry -- and my first post!! But I hope <br/>
it helps. I know I love getting good information from other people and <br/>
maybe I&#39;ve passed on a little something. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody for this group!<br/>
<br/>
Janelle<br/>

Hi Rietta,<br/>
<br/>
When our ds was little he was crazy for Spanish.  We did <br/>
try &quot;programs&quot; - all of them frustrated him and none of them worked.  <br/>
My hubby learned German from living in Germany so he suggested we <br/>
just do immersion and that did work! <br/>
<br/>
DVD language options like Sandra said.<br/>
Spanish setting on the TV, Spanish channels on the TV, Spanish music <br/>
channels on the radio and TV.<br/>
Spanish storybooks from the library - especially stories he already <br/>
knew and loved in English because he loved translating them back to <br/>
us.<br/>
Full Spanish versions of all of his favorite shows.<br/>
We ordered the Spanish newspaper (mostly did the funnies :)<br/>
Bought all of our products with bi-lingual labels.<br/>
We taped the Spanish names of things to everything in our house and <br/>
kept an oral journal (tape recorder) of everything we saw outside and <br/>
that&#39;s how he learned most of his nouns and vocabulary.<br/>
My husbands boss at the time was a native Spanish speaker and our guy <br/>
loved going to the shop and hanging out with him and his kids.<br/>
<br/>
We never told ds we were &quot;doing a Spanish lesson&quot; or &quot;having Spanish <br/>
class&quot;, we just had these things on, around, etc. all the time.  He <br/>
learned to read Spanish before English and was incredibly fluent in <br/>
his early years.  Later he kind of lost interest but at 12 he wanted <br/>
to pick it back up and wanted (and got) Rosetta Stone which he thinks <br/>
is pretty cool.  He&#39;s now at 14 learning German in much the same way <br/>
as he did the Spanish and talks of doing French next.  German is not <br/>
as widely spoken in our area but he has no trouble finding German <br/>
things on the internet.  He does say it was MUCH easier when he was <br/>
young and has learned all about how his younger brain learned <br/>
languages easier than his &quot;older&quot; one, lol! <br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you!<br/>

<br/>
This may sound like a silly question, however, the site says that it <br/>
is free.  I hate to sign up for stuff to only find out that it <br/>
is &quot;free&quot; for 30 days or something like that.  Is this site really <br/>
free or is there some catch.  I think it looks likes like an <br/>
interesting site, but I wanted to check before I went to the <br/>
registration section.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
