<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588423573">I was reading e-mail from Pam Sorooshian about the difference between  <br/>
philosophical discussion and support, and how some people can&#39;t seem  <br/>
to understand the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Holly came in to talk to me about a project she&#39;s working on.  I had  <br/>
helped her brainstorm yesterday, and printed some things out for her  <br/>
she might use as a basis for some of the art.   While we were  <br/>
talking, I was taking notes on a napkin and when I showed them to her  <br/>
later she said &quot;these are really good!&quot; and I said &quot;Well I&#39;m a  <br/>
writer, so I wrote some stuff.&quot;  It was happy and busy and fun.<br/>
<br/>
So when Holly came in today to talk about her progress, she told me  <br/>
what she had just done, and I nodded and kept looking at her, and she  <br/>
said something like  &quot;You&#39;re my writer, so I need you to help me say  <br/>
this better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh!  I thought was being your mom.  &#39;Okay, dear,&#39;&quot; I said in an  <br/>
approving, supportive mom-way.<br/>
<br/>
And in the sing-songiest of poodle voices, Holly imitated a  <br/>
supportive mom, and she said &quot;That&#39;s a good iDEEa!  Follow your dreams.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was hilarious and I wrote it down.   At sixteen she knows what  <br/>
moms can do to &quot;be supportive&quot; in a way that doesn&#39;t really help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In writing that down, I&#39;m aware that some people might read this and  <br/>
say that I said not to tell a kid her idea is good, and not to  <br/>
encourage a child to follow her dreams.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is tempted to think that way, please consider that few  <br/>
things in the world are all or nothing.  If all a parent does is  <br/>
voice pre-spoken platitudes, it won&#39;t be as helpful as if real words  <br/>
are spoken. If you use a phrase others have used, use it with  <br/>
awareness and intent, for a good and specific reason.<br/>
<br/>
There are times to say &quot;You know John better than the coach does,&quot;  <br/>
but that&#39;s not to say  it&#39;s very helpful to tell an unseen, unknown  <br/>
mom &quot;You know your child better than anyone.&quot;  First, it might not be  <br/>
true.  Second, she might be in the midst of a very neglectful or  <br/>
clueless or delusional season, and it can&#39;t help for a stranger, by e- <br/>
mail, to say &quot;You&#39;re a great mom and your child is lucky to have you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to support people in their quest to understand natural  <br/>
learning and mindful parenting, but that support involves  helping  <br/>
them understand the principles behind why it works, and finding ways  <br/>
to adapt their lives in ways that will help it flourish in their  <br/>
families.<br/>

Lewi, at 8, understands this too. It amazes me, sometimes, how much our children take in at an early age. The differences between parenting the way we are and the way some others do it are so obviously big!<br/>
<br/>
We joke around like that too and it&#39;s fun and just the way we are in our family. It feels really connected to me - being able to talk on that sort of level with our children. I&#39;m so thankful to have known about being respectful (arrghh, it sounds revolting put like that - as it should be bleedingly obvious to us humans, shouldn&#39;t it???) at the beginning of my parenting journey because the relationship I have now, with my son at 8 is really wonderful and very real.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173408528">-=-If I wasn&#39;t interested in<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s one thing that women do for other women, on a very  <br/>
surface level.  It&#39;s fine behavior for church, or for a get-together  <br/>
to process food, or for a quilting bee.    Great behavior for a  <br/>
garden party or a tea party.  It&#39;s not about learning, though, it&#39;s  <br/>
about being pleasant together until it&#39;s time to go home.<br/>
<br/>
Men have their own way of doing similar things when they go hunting  <br/>
or help each other build or carry or plant or harvest.  These are old  <br/>
behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are groups gathered for the purpose of inquiry or study or  <br/>
exploration, and they&#39;re more likely to &quot;stay on topic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the topic is pressing, and the inquiry is of an emergency  <br/>
nature, and I think unschooling often comes in that category.   <br/>
Sometimes people who come here are distraught or afraid or just  <br/>
stunned by the idea that they&#39;re actually considering going against  <br/>
their entire upbringing and all their friends, neighbors and  <br/>
relatives.   That&#39;s big.   And just like when someone&#39;s in shock  <br/>
someone should help them stay conscious and alive, when someone is in  <br/>
social shock, telling them to just do whatever they want to is  <br/>
supremely UNhelpful.   Those who do have some idea what needs to be  <br/>
done to get the family moving toward unschooling without them having  <br/>
to fight and cry and freak out should (if they&#39;re willing, as many on  <br/>
this list and other such places are) help them do it.<br/>
<br/>
If we were in person, the help  might involve another a woman holding  <br/>
another woman by the shoulders and looking into her eyes and saying  <br/>
&quot;Breathe.&quot;    That might seem extreme, but without the breathing,  <br/>
without the &quot;WAIT!  Listen--&quot; moment, she could blubber and natter on  <br/>
for hours or weeks or months, having no idea what direction to go,  <br/>
and could manage to piss off her husband, lose her kids&#39; confidence,  <br/>
spread guilt and confusion, and end up with the kid back in school,  <br/>
only with the history of some weird incident where his mom took him  <br/>
out.  Or back to the curriculum sales sites where she spends another  <br/>
$600 to try to teach him a different way, because last year&#39;s way  <br/>
caused tears and sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
In a moment of emotional distress, tea-party manners are infuriating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781984232">in these past few years that Ive come online to discover the wide<br/>
world of forums discussion lists and support groups Ive found that if<br/>
I just present what Ive learned living my life without the *how* I got<br/>
there, without the path which I followed that has brought me to this<br/>
particular moment in time, well, it is then that I find that people<br/>
get upset or offput by what I have written.  <br/>
<br/>
If I am able to take the time to present my past experiences then the<br/>
whole thing softens.  <br/>
<br/>
I dont always feel like doing that though--Ive got a lot of<br/>
experiences accumulated just because ive had 7 children, traveled<br/>
around the world slowly and have beenliving in a foreign country for<br/>
longer than I lived in the US.  <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I share a view, without that sort of path-background and<br/>
it gets picked apart, and my own ego prickles...:o)<br/>
<br/>
but yes, I agree that I love the push that some pickles without the<br/>
tea party can give me.  <br/>
<br/>
I too really enjoy reading and participating on this list...well more<br/>
reading and thining than participating alas.<br/>

sometimes I wake up and see my kids all anew and have that thought that<br/>
I really don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; them!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think other people know them better simply because they are<br/>
more similar or something.  I really do know my kids, but sometimes they<br/>
really stump me or throw me for a loop on something that I thought I<br/>
knew of or about them.<br/>

attention and listen to really know them better, every day.</div>

You don&#39;t need to qualify your remarks in a sigline.  The assumption  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248571145">I find that those who are serious about unschooling look for<br/>
discussion.  Half-assers usually want support.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone find that at their local homeschool groups people get<br/>
defensive when you mention that you are unschooling?  Everyone talks<br/>
about curriculum and field trips and yada yada yada until they meet<br/>
me.  Then it turns to &quot;oh well, we do SOME unschooling&quot; or &quot;we<br/>
unschool but we still have math and bedtimes&quot;.  Why suddenly get so<br/>
defensive?  Are they threatened by my presence?  It seems I make most<br/>
uncomfortable, but I&#39;ve inspired one at least.  :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345000304">Rosie and I got involved in a discussion with several young men (ages  <br/>
18/19) about Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus. A couple of them were  <br/>
EXTREMELY opposed to parents allowing young girls to watch Hannah  <br/>
Montana or to buy any related products, etc. Their arguments were not  <br/>
particularly well thought out - they were clearly spouting stuff  <br/>
they&#39;d heard from some other people - moms of younger kids who they  <br/>
hang out with a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Their main point was that little girls get &quot;completely obsessed&quot; with  <br/>
looking like and being like Miley Cyrus and they don&#39;t feel like they  <br/>
stack up well in comparison to her and so they develop low self- <br/>
esteem. They also threw in some stuff about the young girls being  <br/>
taken in by sophisticated marketing techniques and turned into  <br/>
materialistic shallow consumers. They saw fighting against Disney&#39;s  <br/>
influence as a feminist issue.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to talk to them about it again - mostly for the purpose of  <br/>
helping them not be so willing, in the future, to parrot other  <br/>
people&#39;s ideas without thinking them through for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m asking you all for input. It is a little different than  <br/>
talking to other parents about their own kids.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see how liking Miley Cyrus and being influenced by her is a<br/>
feminist issue.  If anything, it supports the idea that girls can have<br/>
careers, even young girls.  Miley Cyrus hasn&#39;t yet portrayed a &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
image for young girls to emulate.  That&#39;s yet to be seen though, as she<br/>
hasn&#39;t quite launched herself solo of Disney.  Britney Spears wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be a good example of Disney pop iconism, but Christina Aguelera did<br/>
pretty good for herself and remains a talented musician.<br/>
<br/>
Since Miley Cyrus grew up in Hollywood pop culture, it would stand to<br/>
reason that she might be a bit more savvy when it comes to her public<br/>
image.  Maybe.  So far, that seems true.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux loves Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montanna.  She likes the show, she<br/>
likes the music.  Heck, even Chamille likes the newer Miley Cyrus music,<br/>
and that isn&#39;t her genre at all (plus she&#39;s impressed that Miley Cyrus<br/>
is friends with Jeffrey Starr IRL).  What Margaux likes most, is singing<br/>
to her music.  We, as a family unit all like her co-star best of all,<br/>
the girl who plays &quot;Lilly&quot;, Emily Osment.  Her brother is a fine actor<br/>
as well, really awesome in the 6th Sense.<br/>
<br/>
Miley Cyrus looks like a well dressed ordinary girl.  I think that is<br/>
why she is so popular.  Yes, she&#39;s pretty, but not extraordinarily so,<br/>
like some pop icon girls.  There is something about her that is both<br/>
extraordinary and ordinary, that draws girls to her, perhaps it&#39;s the<br/>
dream of feeling extraordinary.  It seems all little girls want to be<br/>
the princess, it&#39;s an old theme that Disney uses often, in varying ways,<br/>
this is just a spin off that theme.<br/>
<br/>
When I look around me at all the little girls I know, most of them do<br/>
not try to emulate Hannah Montanna, they may like her and buy her<br/>
products, but &quot;emulate?&quot;, I&#39;m not so sure.<br/>
<br/>
As far as fighting Disney goes, well, sometimes Disney irritates me,<br/>
it&#39;s true, but for the most part my kids have all really enjoyed a lot<br/>
of Disney movies and shows.  It brings up a lot of conversations around<br/>
here.  Besides all that, it&#39;s not the only thing out there that kids are<br/>
influenced by.  I think everyone in my family would watch SpongeBob over<br/>
Hannah Montanna most days.  We don&#39;t emulate SpongeBob either.... hmmm<br/>
that would be a little scary!</div>

talking to other parents about their own kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ask them which characters in the media might be better role models.<br/>
<br/>
Ask them if they think young girls&#39; desire to grow up quickly and be  <br/>
part of the in crowd would be satisfied if they were totally deprived  <br/>
if ANYthing to fantasize about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My train of thought here is to skirt the edges of what you figuring  <br/>
they have in their own lives as heroes or icons.  Skateboarders?   <br/>
Racecar drivers?  Athletes?  Musicians?  What music do they listen to  <br/>
and why?  I wouldn&#39;t ask them, I&#39;d just run a parallel line of  <br/>
inquiry on the girly side.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And definitely show them this, if you need a tension breaker:<br/>

Well... in our household Kyra, 11, actually goes out of her way to avoid Miley Cyrus products or things with over marketed stars on them.  (Except Sponge Bob &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

When the Hannah Montana show first started she enjoyed watching it, but in the last year or so she has said that she is so tired of seeing Miley everywhere.  So Disney has actually done the opposite with Kyra as far as selling those products or an image.<br/>

<br/>
Sierra has a pretty strong and healthy sense of self esteem and she<br/>
LOVED the whole Hannah/Miley thing for a while. She also has a very<br/>
funky, unique style that looks NOTHING like anything on tv, so I don&#39;t<br/>
think those shows have that much power. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a big fan of them myself, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re harmful. I<br/>
think the environment the child is surrounded by has  LOT more to do<br/>
with how they view themselves and the kind of consumers they are than<br/>
any tv show or singer out there!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bunch of hogwash, but when people see lots of young girls<br/>
mimicking and looking up to celebrities like that, they assume the<br/>
power to influence is with the celebrity. It&#39;s not so much. <br/>

<br/>
Same with Sierra. She&#39;s so tired of seeing/hearing about it! She found<br/>
out how those kind of celebrities are &quot;created&quot; and it kinda disgusted<br/>
her because she values true singer/songwriters that create their own<br/>
music. She adores musicians like Regina Spektor so Miley can&#39;t really<br/>
compete after a while.:)<br/>
<br/>
But she loved it at first and I see no ill effects from that! Even if<br/>
she still loved it, I don&#39;t believe for a second that it would be<br/>
harmful to her self esteem. Cripes. I think I mentioned something<br/>

mom is using it to justify same-old/same-old.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I responded to some writings about TV, and I don&#39;t think  <br/>
anyone who had written so bravely had a kid over the age of four.  So  <br/>
I was able to tell them my 16, 19 and 22 year olds are fine, so I  <br/>
know TV won&#39;t hurt their kids.   But will they see me as bullying  <br/>
them with experience or sharing knowledge?  Each will see it from  <br/>
inside her own head, and depending how open she is to learning and  <br/>
change, she&#39;ll see it as helpful, good, dangerous or satanically  <br/>
evil.    And still, my kids are great.<br/>
<br/>
This is presented anonymously.  It&#39;s not my writing.  It could sure  <br/>
SOUND like my writing.  I guess I&#39;m not the only one who feels this  <br/>
way, then!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not very patient when it comes to waiting and getting  <br/>
unschooling.  The kids grow up way too fast.  I&#39;m trying to be nice,   <br/>
but I refuse to water down my views.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is what is required for social chit-chat:  watering down.  Nicey- <br/>
niceness.  It might not be sincere, but golly it&#39;s *nice.*   Nice is  <br/>
good when we&#39;re trying to comfort each other about the hopelessness  <br/>
of our predicament, or the powerlessness of our position as women.   <br/>
Once we stand up and put some walking shoes on and realize it&#39;s not  <br/>
the 19th century anymore,  it&#39;s not even the 20th century anymore, we  <br/>
can interact from a place of power and choice.<br/>

Meanwhile, each time I sat down, I worked on a little piece of  <br/>
performance art (an self-serve, interactive web page for special  <br/>
occasions).    Come to think of it, it&#39;s entirely for, by and about  <br/>
women.  Men might not get it or they might get it but not appreciate  <br/>
it at all.  That&#39;s okay.  In all the dozen and some years I&#39;ve been  <br/>
helping other unschoolers, not a single male has ever said &quot;I came  <br/>
here for support.  This isn&#39;t very supportive.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I watched an episode - part of an episode - of Hannah Montana with my<br/>
son Pat (he&#39;s 13). I told him I thought it sucked. He gave me a<br/>
dressing down for jumping to conclusions after watching ten minutes of<br/>
one episode. But he didn&#39;t actually say what he thought of it. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t watch it in any event. We catch a trailer from time to time<br/>
<br/>
I certainly wouldn&#39;t be opposed to him watching the show if he wanted<br/>
to. Or anybody else. It&#39;s still bright, bubbly and shiny which is no<br/>
bad thing, even if I think it&#39;s shallow. But then I&#39;m a 56 year old<br/>
guy with my head in a different world. Probably. Pat and I both like<br/>
The Suite Life of Zac and Cody, though, which is pretty close to as<br/>
shallow as you can get. And Clueless is one of my all time favourite<br/>
movies (for some reason). So I think it&#39;s Hannah Montana itself that<br/>
doesn&#39;t appeal to me not the genre. <br/>
<br/>
As for Miley Cyrus, well, that goes back to Helen Shapiro and before<br/>
her probably. <br/>
<br/>
From Helen Shapiro&#39;s Wikipedia page: &quot;In 1961, at the age of fourteen,<br/>
she had two number one hits in the UK: &quot;You Don&#39;t Know&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#39;<br/>
Back to Happiness&quot;; and, indeed, her first four single releases all<br/>
went into the top three of the UK Singles Chart. Her mature voice made<br/>
her an overnight sensation, as well as the youngest female chart<br/>
topper in the UK. At a mere 14 years and 316 days old when &quot;You Don&#39;t<br/>
Know&quot; hit the top, she was nevertheless a year older than Frankie<br/>
Lymon had been when &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; hit the UK number one<br/>
slot in 1956.<br/>
<br/>
Before she was sixteen years old, Shapiro had been voted Britain&#39;s<br/>
&#39;Top Female Singer&#39;, and when The Beatles had their first national<br/>
tour it was as her supporting act. The Beatles even wrote the song<br/>
&quot;Misery&quot; for her but, inexplicably, EMI decided not to record her<br/>
singing it.<br/>
<br/>
By the time she was in her late teens, however, her career as a pop<br/>
singer was on the wane. Undaunted, she re-invented herself as a<br/>
performer in stage musicals, a jazz singer, (jazz being her first love<br/>
musically), and more recently a gospel singer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These days, of course, it&#39;s all more sophisticated and complex and<br/>
there are more ways to get into our faces. But IMO it&#39;s not<br/>
fundamentally different.<br/>

Holly watched an episode of Hannah Montana when we were in a hotel in  <br/>
Minnesota last year.  We don&#39;t have cable, so she only knew them from  <br/>
the radio.  The Jonas Brothers were on that episode, and she liked  <br/>
that, because they&#39;re cute.  Holly doesn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; cute; she has a  <br/>
perfectly good boyfriend.  Still, she&#39;s in  the throes of the age at  <br/>
which physical attraction is huge and new and fun.  She likes their  <br/>
singing.<br/>

My kids are not much prone to faddish attachments.  If someone&#39;s not  <br/>
any good musically, they won&#39;t listen just because their friends  <br/>
are.  They&#39;re pretty analytical.<br/>

sending the 3yo to her room *so the mom can cool off*...I want to just<br/>
lay in quickly, concisely that what she&#39;s doing sucks...that she needs<br/>
to work on how she is viewing all of this *inside her head*.<br/>
<br/>
when I do this without sharing *how* Ive come to this place (knowing<br/>
how my thoughts are what are taking me to this place of contention,<br/>
for example, without sharing my diverse experiences of being in<br/>
similar places with a 3yo and then learning to move past that, and<br/>
what it looks like now for me with a 3yo...) when I avoid the details<br/>
and just give what she needs to do *now* this is where I might be told<br/>
Im not being supportive, and my words hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I wasnt really meaning, &quot;Ive been doing this for years like this, and<br/>
so I know it works.&quot;<br/>

I sent the link to a local list that was intended to be unschooling<br/>
friendly (unschooling is in the group name) in response to these<br/>
emails seemingly advocating the tea party approach.  Thought you might<br/>
be interested in seeing the case for the tea party approach.  Perhaps<br/>
not... perhaps you have seen it advocated too many times to want to<br/>
hear it again.<br/>
<br/>
The context is that someone from this list posted about protesting a<br/>
spanking advocate, someone else replied with this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How interesting.....A fair number of homeschooling families will<br/>
likely be attending this seminar, while others are protesting it.  No<br/>
one can say all PNW homeschoolers fit any one cookie-cutter.<br/>
Diversity does make for some interesting, learning, and sometimes<br/>
stretching opportunities. &quot; (followed by information on the speaking<br/>
dates of the spanking advocate)<br/>
<br/>
and then followed by this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well said &lt;name removed&gt;.<br/>
I think we can all agree to respectfully state our opinions and be<br/>
heard without being attacked. This is what makes a good board and<br/>
topic interesting.  When someone says something that differs from what<br/>
I think, it causes me to rethink it through and reconsider why I<br/>
thought that in the first place.And also if I still think it.<br/>
Sometimes I think it, but have a hard time verbalizing it out of my<br/>
mind. &quot;Iron sharpens Iron&quot; being a good proverb here. I am on<br/>
another board where people get snotty easily and &quot;go off in the<br/>
mouth&quot;. I always regret how they do that and don&#39;t think they really<br/>
want to listen or understand one another. They are just reacting all<br/>
the time. We all have reactions and I think it is a really important<br/>
to be able to deal with them in the right way. Sometimes I realize<br/>
that it&#39;s just something I need to work through and other times I<br/>
realize I may need to move out of my comfort zone and talk to someone.<br/>
It&#39;s something I have been trying to teach my kids as well. It seems<br/>
like their personalities make this harder or easier at times.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say the surface can look like that.<br/>
<br/>
I think school culture fosters a need for kids to conform to some  <br/>
accepted-by-the group-leaders standard in order to be accepted by a  <br/>
peer group.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s prejudice to judge what&#39;s going on beneath by what&#39;s on the  <br/>
surface. Where&#39;s the proof that the kids have warped their  <br/>
personalities to conform to some ideal?<br/>
<br/>
In fact some kids purposely dress to shock those who judge by surface  <br/>
appearance. They want to make people angry because the kids are angry  <br/>
that no one cares who they really are. The only real power they&#39;re  <br/>
given is the power to shock.<br/>
<br/>
If there is conforming and warping going on, it doesn&#39;t come from an  <br/>
image but a pressure and need to conform. Miley would have no  <br/>
influence if the need didn&#39;t exist. Taking away Miley doesn&#39;t remove  <br/>
the need, just makes the mom feel better because there isn&#39;t an  <br/>
obvious external window into what&#39;s going on inside the child.<br/>
<br/>
There is, of course, a natural need to be accepted. Humans are social  <br/>
creatures. We need acceptance of who we are. Unfortunately kids grow  <br/>
up in the school culture where outward conformance often substitutes  <br/>
for acceptance and kids can only play act within a limited scope of  <br/>
characters or be ostracized. Some personalities can accept the  <br/>
ostracism as part of their need to not conform. Some personalities  <br/>
are willing to give up some self expression to have a social circle.  <br/>
School is not a healthy social climate but Miley shouldn&#39;t be blamed  <br/>
for what&#39;s been going on well before even her parents were born.<br/>
<br/>
The teen years are also a time of trying on various personas to see  <br/>
what they feel like. It&#39;s a teen version of pretending to be Pokemon  <br/>
and fairies and mommies and daddies. Right now my daughter is trying  <br/>
out being an 80&#39;s metal guitarist. Is she a sparkly red top and faux  <br/>
leather pants? It&#39;s shallow and thoughtless to stop there in seeing  <br/>
who she is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147252698">Their main point was that little girls get &quot;completely obsessed&quot; with<br/>
looking like and being like Miley Cyrus and they don&#39;t feel like they<br/>
stack up well in comparison to her and so they develop low self-<br/>
esteem. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
We watch a lot of Hannah Montana here.  Dan (7) even DVR&#39;s new<br/>
episodes.  As Disney shows go, it&#39;s not bad.  I&#39;m not a big fan of<br/>
Disney, for a variety of reasons -- chief among them the<br/>
parent-attrition rate.&lt;g&gt;  Disney seems convinced you can&#39;t have a<br/>
story with both parents still alive and present in a child&#39;s life (the<br/>
only exception I see is Wizards of Waverly Place). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed many of the HM shows revolve around some stupid, shallow,<br/>
thoughtless, or immature choice made by Miley, and they all wrap up<br/>
nicely with the usual Disney morals.  As a result, Miley doesn&#39;t<br/>
always come off as the &#39;girl you want to be&#39; character.  Lilly comes<br/>
across as more thoughtful and at time, I think. <br/>
<br/>
The Dad is a little heavy-handed and immature himself, but that&#39;s part<br/>
of what sells family sit-coms (Dads especially seem petty and clueless<br/>
on TV). <br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
They also threw in some stuff about the young girls being taken in by<br/>
sophisticated marketing techniques and turned into materialistic<br/>
shallow consumers.<br/>
<br/>
******<br/>
This sounds like them parroting what the adults say.  Mainstream<br/>
parents truly believe kids are stupid, and will buy anything marketed<br/>
to them.  Retailers seem to think so, too.  I give kids more credit --<br/>
we know kids are really much more savvy than &#39;experts&#39; say they are.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
They saw fighting against Disney&#39;s influence as a feminist issue.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I can see how folks could make that argument, but Cinderella, Sleeping<br/>
Beauty and Rapunzel have been around much longer than Disney.  Disney<br/>
doesn&#39;t deserve all the &#39;save me, I&#39;m a helpless princess&#39; mindset. <br/>
<br/>
And I can find many non-feminist reasons to revile Disney.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757647791">-=-But it&#39;s prejudice to judge what&#39;s going on beneath by what&#39;s on the<br/>
surface. Where&#39;s the proof that the kids have warped their<br/>
personalities to conform to some ideal?-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I was a big Beatlemaniac.  I was of an age to be  <br/>
able to save my meager allowance to buy Beatles albums for $5.  Once  <br/>
I sold an art easel to my neighbor for the price of a Beatle&#39;s album.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In fact some kids purposely dress to shock those who judge by  <br/>
surface  appearance. They want to make people angry because the kids  <br/>
are angry that no one cares who they really are. The only real power  <br/>
they&#39;re given is the power to shock.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those would be the kids who liked the Rolling Stones, when I was  <br/>
young. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And also the whole set of us, who wore fringed jeans we hadn&#39;t  <br/>
ironed, and didn&#39;t want the holes patched, and went braless and let  <br/>
our hair be straight or curly as it came out on its own without  <br/>
slavishly &quot;styling&quot; it.  And the boys let their hair grow long.  And  <br/>
for parents who had been participants in WWII, that was a HUGE &quot;screw  <br/>
you guys&quot; kind of shock.  I think my kids don&#39;t appreciate how  <br/>
extreme that was, in the 60&#39;s.  Now, to shock parents from the 60&#39;s,  <br/>
kids have to pierce and tattoo the heck out of themselves, because  <br/>
merely messing with hair or clothes wasn&#39;t parent-shocking.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t seem to have as much of that as school kids.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen some unschooled kids who did seem to be longing to shock, and I  <br/>
wondered whether the parents were not spending enough time with them.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Miley would have no influence if the need didn&#39;t exist. Taking  <br/>
away Miley doesn&#39;t remove the need, just makes the mom feel better  <br/>
because there isn&#39;t an obvious external window into what&#39;s going on  <br/>
inside the child.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It is not Miley it will be someone else, and Miley&#39;s better  than  <br/>
just about any other young female performer, as to what I would want  <br/>
a  young girl to want to wear or long to be like.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid there were very few female performers who could be  <br/>
emulated, and it wasn&#39;t the fashion to do so.  I think it&#39;s a good  <br/>
sign that feminism &quot;took,&quot; that girls are willing to idolize and  <br/>
emulate girls instead of spending ALL their time (instead of just  <br/>
some) wishing they could be the girlfriend of some rock&#39;n&#39;roller or  <br/>
athlete.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce is totally brilliant.  I want to be like Joyce.<br/>

effective means of &quot;fighting against&quot; it. I&#39;m pretty sure that Zoe  <br/>
can both love Ariel and understand that her costume did not have to  <br/>
be so sexy. We used to watch &quot;Friends&quot; as a family and we both  <br/>
laughed at the jokes and talked about their level of sexual activity.  <br/>
I&#39;m sure I could think of a million more examples, but the point is I  <br/>
think that watching/listening and talking WITH your kids is a much  <br/>
more effective way to develop critical thinking.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a sigline on a feminist mom&#39;s posts on a forum somewhere.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to quote it exactly, and it&#39;s in color anyway, but it says  <br/>
something to the effect of having taken her daughter out of the  <br/>
institution before she could stop liking trucks and blue and start  <br/>
liking princesses and pink.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;t create femininity and role modeling.  It might reward  <br/>
it a little bit, but I know lots of kids who never went to school,  <br/>
and some locally whose parents were SURE that gender identification  <br/>
was all nurture and no nature.  Their kids are Kirby&#39;s age and older,  <br/>
and the parents were wrong.<br/>
<br/>
We had neighbors who had a pinkish boy who were awful to him.  It was  <br/>
a mom and a boy, no siblings, step father I learned later was gay.   <br/>
Mom was doing the entire local baseball team. NOT a good match for a  <br/>
non-macho husband.   And the boy liked to come over to our house and  <br/>
put on puppet shows and plays with my kids, and he wanted to play the  <br/>
princess. I let him.  My kids weren&#39;t teasing him about it at all.   <br/>
But he had to change QUICKly if his mom called.  So I think what she  <br/>
was doing was wrong.  But what my other friends did was as wrong in  <br/>
the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe, now that I think about it, it was the very same thing.<br/>

Please try to rephrase instead of using the word &quot;stupid.&quot;  There&#39;s  <br/>
no meaning left in that word anymore, it&#39;s just a wad of negativity  <br/>
without substance.  I don&#39;t mean just on this list.  I think when  <br/>
people use the word &quot;stupid&quot; they&#39;re not communicating.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this is emotion on my part, but the one word that&#39;s not used  <br/>
at my house without comment or cringing is &quot;stupid.&quot;  So I&#39;d like to  <br/>
ask that people avoid using it on this list and maybe everywhere on  <br/>
earth.  I can ask, but I can&#39;t enforce.  Please think about it,  <br/>
though.  I commented the last time someone used the word here too, so  <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to pick on anyone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And I can find many non-feminist reasons to revile Disney.....-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Reviling&quot; Disney (what, the man?  The corporation?  The theme  <br/>
parks?  Every movie made for 80 years?) isn&#39;t productive or useful  <br/>
and it won&#39;t help anyone become better unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can love the art in &quot;Snow White&quot; without loving Old Yeller.   <br/>
Someone can love Freaky Friday without loving The Love Bug.  Please,  <br/>
let&#39;s aim for fair-minded discernment on the list, in ourselves, and  <br/>
with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a list (there are probably several out there) just of the  <br/>
animated films:<br/>
