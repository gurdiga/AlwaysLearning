&lt;&lt; On to my question---Is anyone familiar with &quot;Life Learning Magazine?&quot; It <br/>
looks interesting, but as it&#39;s not cheap, I&#39;d like to get some feedback <br/>
before subscribing. Opinions? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love the two issues I&#39;ve read!! Excellent magazine overall. Hopefully <br/>
they&#39;ll be making enough money to pay a little something for submissions <br/>
soon....it seems to be doing well. Let&#39;s hope they stick around!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to a lovely corner of the internet. I think you&#39;ll like it here.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
