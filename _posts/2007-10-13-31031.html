<div id="ygrps-yiv-214695938">Marty&#39;s sitting next to me playing Oblivion, an X-Box game.  He said  <br/>
he thought he had played just about all the scenarios in the game,  <br/>
but discovered thirteen or so more.  He was happy about that.<br/>
<br/>
A certain theme came on and I said &quot;I like that.&quot;  The art&#39;s  <br/>
beautiful and the music, in that game.  I&#39;ve loved the music since  <br/>
the NES Mario games, though, when it was all tinky and beepy.<br/>
<br/>
Marty said he could tell me in just a minute who wrote it, and I  <br/>
asked if he was at the end of the game.  No, this game doesn&#39;t have  <br/>
an ending, but there&#39;s a credits link, so we watched the credits and  <br/>
talked about the people&#39;s names.  American looking names.  Maybe  <br/>
German and other northern European, or maybe just Americans with  <br/>
those kinds of names.<br/>
<br/>
Down below is what we found, in just moments, along with pictures of  <br/>
the twenty or so video games whose soundtracks he&#39;s done, and lots of  <br/>
music on the site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I have two more stories first.  A few years ago Dan Vilter, Kathy  <br/>
&quot;sofar8&quot; (I&#39;m forgetting her real name) and I did a workshop at the  <br/>
HSC conference in Sacramento.  It was well received to standing-room  <br/>
only, but was also reviled by a few hecklers and I felt pointed not  <br/>
invited back fora couple of years (could&#39;ve been my imagination, but  <br/>
part of the objection and negativity  was definite).  When people  <br/>
were coming into the room and leaving, we were playing music from  <br/>
Final Fantasy (IX, I think), which Kirby had bought and sent along  <br/>
with me.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly and I were at the Traaseth&#39;s last week, Kelli had some  <br/>
piano music for something from Final Fantasy or Halo... (Kelli, fill  <br/>
in, please and could you post that YouTube link with the mood  <br/>
lighting? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So here is something very thought-provoking and moving:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jeremysoule.com/">http://jeremysoule.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Jeremy Soule began life as a passionate composer of symphonic music  <br/>
at a very early age.  Since the age of five, Soule took an intense  <br/>
interest in the symphony orchestra.  “The Orchestra is the ultimate  <br/>
instrument.  I find that it has the ability to define nearly every  <br/>
human emotion in existence” stated Soule from his Cascadian studio in  <br/>
the Great Northwest of America.<br/>
<br/>
Mastering the art of orchestration, melodic composition and emotional  <br/>
context was no easy task for the British Academy Award winning  <br/>
composer...<br/>
<br/>
“Every day is a challenge.  I am not able to take anything for  <br/>
granted when it comes to music.  Music is a literal language that is  <br/>
a life study for me.  I find that the natural inspiration behind  <br/>
sound starts with the beauty of the human spirit.  Everything in  <br/>
music is a reflection of who we are in Creation.  Composers draw from  <br/>
the same sorts of places as other disciplines of the Arts in that we  <br/>
are all connected to some greater cause and energy.  Defining our  <br/>
place in this energy is the beauty of our Art.”<br/>
<br/>
That video games could be considered “Art” was unthinkable over 30  <br/>
years ago during the debut of the first game machines such as the  <br/>
Magnavox Odyssey.  The sights and sounds of the mid-eighties machines  <br/>
also did little to hint at the coming revolution.  Today, video games  <br/>
feature development budgets in the tens of millions of dollars and  <br/>
often command some of the top talent in an ever-growing $20 billion  <br/>
industry.<br/>
<br/>
For over a decade, Soule has provided music for some of the most  <br/>
successful and admired games of all time.  Star Wars: Knights of the  <br/>
Old Republic, Harry Potter, Total Annihilation, SOCOM: The Navy Seals  <br/>
and the Elder Scrolls series can all attribute music to him.  His  <br/>
versatility as a composer has also been demonstrated from his  <br/>
critically acclaimed traditional Asian score for Guild Wars Factions  <br/>
to his work with children’s properties such as Rugrats and Lemony  <br/>
Snicket and the Series of Unfortunate Events.<br/>
<br/>
The year 2006 witnessed one of the best years yet for Soule with such  <br/>
critical and commercial success coming from The Elder Scrolls IV:  <br/>
Oblivion, Guild Wars: Factions/Nightfall, Prey and the World War II  <br/>
epic Company of Heroes.  Soule won the inaugural MTV Video Music  <br/>
Award in August for “Best Score” and was honored with his third  <br/>
career British Academy Award nomination in October.  In November,  <br/>
Soule won another “Best Score” award from Spike TV and was the  <br/>
recipient of numerous press awards such as Game Daily’s “most iPod- <br/>
worthy score”.<br/>
<br/>
In feature films, Soule’s Walden Logo was used at the start of the  <br/>
$744 million earning film: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the  <br/>
Witch and the Wardrobe.  His work with Narnia also continued with  <br/>
director Norman Stone’s critically acclaimed film C.S. Lewis: Beyond  <br/>
Narnia.<br/>
<br/>
In concerts, Soule’s music was a component of the successful “Play  <br/>
Symphony” tour that featured prominently Elder Scrolls as well as  <br/>
Prey as part of their concert program.  Performances were conducted  <br/>
with symphony orchestras in Vienna, Stockholm, Chicago, Philadelphia,  <br/>
Detroit and Toronto.  Future performances are scheduled in Stockholm,  <br/>
Sydney and Singapore.  Visit www.play-symphony.com for more  <br/>
information. A special note to our readers...<br/>
  “I love my fans—especially young composers.  I encourage anyone  <br/>
that wishes to contact me to write me here at this website.  It may  <br/>
take me a little while to reply to everyone but be assured that I  <br/>
will respond.” –Jeremy Soule</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s from Final Fantasy XI,  To Zanarkand is the song,  composed by Nobuo Uematsu.  It is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the youtube with the version I&#39;m trying to find music to, probably a lost cause though.   I think this guy put some different arrangements together and added in some of his own.  I&#39;ve found a few different variations but not as good as his, (dang!)  I&#39;ll keep working on it though.<br/>
<br/>
The mood lighting that Sandra mentions is really cute &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I also like a lot of different music from video games.  I liked Crystal Chronicles, Final Fantasies, and there&#39;s some Halo stuff that&#39;s pretty good too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info on Soule Sandra,  I&#39;m going to check it out.  We have Oblivion but Alec gets a little freaked out playing it.  He says some of it is just too much for him.   <br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s another video that Sandra shared with us that other&#39;s might like too:<br/>

Thanks for the new connection! I had thought all the Rugrats cartoons&#39;  music <br/>
was done by Mark Mothersbaugh or the Mothersbaugh brothers (Devo, Ohio  <br/>
natives), so I had to Google and search. Turns out that not only has Soule  created <br/>
the score for Rugrats games (how could I forget there were Rugrats video  <br/>
games??), but he&#39;s also done at least one episode of the cartoon. Cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049312141">I really appreciated this thread.  It&#39;s gotten me thinking about all the<br/>
ways videos games have enriched our lives and created opportunities for<br/>
enjoyment and growth along the way.  The music has been a very big<br/>
influence on us and I can see how it will continue to lead us down paths<br/>
of interest and passion.  <br/>
<br/>
The first game we got when we bought our GameCube was PacMan 2.  The<br/>
background music played a lot during those days and now every time I<br/>
hear it I think back to that time when we were just beginning our<br/>
unschooling journey and the excitement and newness of it all.  Now, many<br/>
of the background songs for our favorite games take me back to the time<br/>
we first played a particular game and what was going on in our lives at<br/>
the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Now my 9 year old, Connor, has expanded his interest in music and has<br/>
started learning to play the piano by ear.  Every morning he plays a bit<br/>
and the music that he has chosen are all songs from his favorite video<br/>
games.  This thread helped me realized that there is even more expansion<br/>
with this passion by exploring the composers of the songs (duh!) and<br/>
sharing that with Connor as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Connor also has a great ear for discerning different instruments.  He<br/>
pointed out that the PS special edition of Harvest Moon used a banjo in<br/>
the theme song instead of the guitar features in the GameCube version.<br/>
(I may have the instruments mixed up, because I don&#39;t have the ear for<br/>
music that he does &lt;g&gt;.)  In any case, we can also add &quot;Music<br/>
Appreciation&quot; to the long list of benefits we experience from our games.<br/>
<br/>
Connor has some great role models, as his dad is a passionate musician<br/>
and my step-son (Connor&#39;s older half-brother) is a composer and writes<br/>
music/sound effects for computer and video games, and movies, etc.<br/>
Recently he had a song used on the TV show, &quot;My Name is Earl.&quot;  We have<br/>
one of his computer games, (Professor Wizmo&#39;s Workshop) and it&#39;s so much<br/>
fun to be aware when we are playing it and think, &quot;Wow, Rob created all<br/>
those sounds that affect our mood and cue us into what&#39;s going to happen<br/>
next.&quot;  We have had some great conversations about what he uses for<br/>
inspiration for some of the sounds.  He&#39;s always on the look out for<br/>
cool new sounds that he can add to his library.  Now that Connor has<br/>
recently started producing videos for YouTube, we are about at the point<br/>
to start introducing musical effect into them, so that will be an<br/>
exciting venture.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to add my own little A-has about how learning is<br/>
happening in our lives and how huge influences can come in (seemingly)<br/>
very subtle ways by just following our passions and enjoying life.<br/>
<br/>
Rock on!<br/>
