&lt;&lt; Actually, his birthday is the 15th, but this is the Monday we celebrate <br/>
his <br/>
birthday this year.<br/>
<br/>
Tuck &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Monday-holiday government birthday.<br/>
<br/>
They made Washington and Lincoln share one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I checked my mailbox twice before I remembered it was a holiday.  Trashman <br/>
comes; mail comes.  That&#39;s Monday.   Kids didn&#39;t go to school?  NOT A CLUE.<br/>
<br/>
Oh hey!  Today, though, Kirby and  Marty socialized with high school kids!<br/>
<br/>
A high school kid works where Kirby works.  As there was no school today, <br/>
guys from his school had planned a big Halo extravaganza with four tvs and four <br/>
game systems (X-Box).  Sixteen players at once.<br/>
<br/>
So because they weren&#39;t going to school today, they decided to spend the <br/>
school hours playing Halo.   No problem for them.  For Kirby and Marty!?  (And <br/>
Joey and Jeremy, who spent the night so they&#39;d be here when it started...)   They <br/>
were to meet at the parking lot of the gaming store at 7:00 so Mike, the <br/>
school-guy, could lead them to his friend&#39;s house.   <br/>
<br/>
I was happily sleeping (actually having an elaborately stupid and frustrating <br/>
dream, so it was fine) when the phone rang at 6:59.  Marty was on it, but I <br/>
got up and hiked to the front of the house to see whether Kirby had failed to <br/>
wake up or something.  No, Kirby was out scraping frost off the windshield.  He <br/>
has never driven a car that early in the morning and didn&#39;t know much about <br/>
frost.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
So  the call was this:  Mike got there to meet Kirby, and the window was <br/>
broken on the store.  They&#39;d been broken into.  So he called Kirby to find out <br/>
what to do.  They called their boss (who lives half an hour away instead of two <br/>
minutes as we do) and waited for him to get there before going on to play.<br/>
<br/>
That was a lot of excitement for before 8:00 a.m.   And the game was tons of <br/>
fun.  They came back all tumbling over each other to tell storie about how <br/>
cool it was.<br/>
<br/>
So on a day when school was out, my kids did a school-schedule day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
