<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110623960"><p>I could use some help thinking through an issue about children making their own medical choices. My five year old is suffering from terrible constipation (pain,&nbsp;weeping&nbsp;and screaming &quot;It won&#39;t come out! Why won&#39;t it come out! Come out poop!&quot;)&nbsp; At her doctor&#39;s recommendation, she took Miralax for six days.&nbsp; I am totally comfortable with using bribes or incentives so that is what we (mostly)&nbsp;did in order to get the medicine down.&nbsp; I say &quot;mostly&quot; because sometimes I did lapse into badgering behavior that was not helpful but I caught myself and apologized and let her know that it was her choice to take the medicine to help the poop come out.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this did not clear the blockage and&nbsp;today our doctor is recommending an enema or suppository. My daughter is now refusing to have any medicine and becomes completely distraught when I mention that she can take medicine in her bum.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is back in diapers 24/7. My husband feels that we &quot;have to&quot; make her take an enema or suppository right away.&nbsp; I am concerned about the mental and relationship damage any such enforcement could cause, not to mention the physical impossibility of me restraining her to get the medicine in.&nbsp; I want to offer her time to get used to the idea and a choice of enema or suppository, but I am not sure that even with time and these choices that we will get to anything approaching a &quot;yes.&quot;&nbsp; She says she want to wait for the poop to come out on its own.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is just magical thinking or if I should just&nbsp;step back&nbsp;and trust her or if there are other approaches that I am missing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some background: Thanks to help from this group and other unschooling resources, we have been doing monkey platters for about a year now. I&nbsp;think the constipation is&nbsp;partly due&nbsp;to her food choices.&nbsp;I have shared information with her about what foods can help her poop be soft but I do not restrict her food choices.&nbsp; I let her know what things she could add to her diet but she chooses not to right now and gets really mad if I put a fruit choice on her platter with&nbsp;her regular favorites.&nbsp; So there is no easy diet fix for this. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She&nbsp;has been an every couple of days pooper&nbsp;since she was 2 or so.&nbsp; She&nbsp;uses the toilet to pee but not poop.&nbsp; I have been following a &quot;let her do it in her own time&quot; approach to using the toilet but it appears by taking that route she has developed real pain associated with pooping that I did not recognize.&nbsp; She generally wanted to poop in private in the bedroom so, while I knew she was straining, I did not realize that it was hurting so much that she has begun a withholding pattern.&nbsp; She also weaned about 5 months ago so we no longer have the help of nursing to encourage bowel movements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I also now realize that some of the behaviors that I was attributing to what gets labeled a&nbsp;&quot;highly sensitive&quot; or &quot;highly spirited&quot; temperament, such as wanting to stay home most all of the time and an over-the-top grouchiness, is probably coming from&nbsp;ongoing physical discomfort and a desire to be near a safe place to poop, as much as any personality traits.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think this situation can be a chance to deepen our unschooling practices&nbsp;over the long-term.&nbsp; She&#39;s already drawing pictures of how poop comes out and she and I constructed a handmade doctor&#39;s kit that she is using on all her stuffed animals and our cat.&nbsp; I know the information I have shared is being taken in on her own schedule. But, according to medical sources, the longer we wait to do this enema/suppository, the more her colon will get stretched out of shape and the longer the recovery from that will be.&nbsp;Not to mention that we will need to negotiate if she will take the medicine suggested for the following month or months to help her poop get soft enough to end the withholding pattern&nbsp;and negotiating if she will try sitting on the toilet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably more sticker&nbsp;charts and bribes:)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, at this point, we have not been out of the house, except for 2 doctors visits and&nbsp;a trip to the toy store for almost two weeks now and not much outside time at all for the past month.&nbsp;I understand that she wants to stay home but I could use a bit of fresh air and sunshine (or a walk&nbsp;under the moon)&nbsp;to recharge my mothering batteries.&nbsp; I am the only one who she lets&nbsp;her diaper. She wants me to stay in the house with her, period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I want to get at the larger issues here but also&nbsp;want to help her alleviate the <var id="ygrps-yiv-1110623960yui-ie-cursor"></var>immediate blockage.&nbsp; Suggestions?</p></div>

<br/>
If that links breaks, search on &quot;constipat&quot; which will bring up constipation, constipated, constipate.<br/>
<br/>
There are suggestions that humans aren&#39;t designed to sit to poop. Squatting gets the innards lined up properly. There are stools that wrap around the toilet that bring the knees up. Search for &quot;squat potty&quot;. (Amazon sells them.) They&#39;re for adults as well as kids so just get one and use it yourself. You can say you stumbled across the idea that squatting is better while reading about pooping and wanted to try it yourself. Show her how to move it out of the way.<br/>
<br/>
What might help is to stop focussing on what will help her go. Instead just add things to her life that will help her go. Right now it probably feels like the whole day is focused on her pooping. Which is probably increasing her tension and withholding!<br/>
<br/>
Walking, climbing. Horseback riding :-) Warm baths. (Get some new fun things to do in the bath.) Massage with scented oil. (Massaging the belly can help, but an overall massage can help ease her tension and make it less poop focused ;-) Ease out the white flour and (possibly) cheese where you can. Substitute more fiber rich snacks and foods. (A sudden big up in fiber can cause cramps.) Popcorn. Peas. (My daughter loved frozen peas :-) Berries and seeds, perhaps in granola bars or yogurt or the smoothies and popsicles Sandra mentioned. Probiotics might help (some yogurts will have them. Kefir (Lifeway brand is especially yummy.)) Make fiber rich snacks like cookies and muffins. Make your own bread. Do these with her :-) Make it as easy as possible for her to drink; keep a water bottle near her, juice boxes, filled sippy cups. Up the oil in her diet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495137843"><p>Hi. I&#39;m sorry you are going through this. It is so very hard to watch our kids go through any kind of discomfert </p>
<p>My oldest dd who&#39;s 10 now had issues while pooping when she started potty training for preschool when she was three. This was before our unschooling days. She would hold it for such a long time and we ended up doing enemas and seposotories. It was awful to watch my little girl be in so much pain. I did some research back then and had her tested for celiacs disease and that wasnt it. Then I came across foods and natural remedies to soften stool. Smoothies like sandra mentioned is a plus add some to the smoothies and fish oil and you can get ground flax seed meal and add that. Flax seed pancakes are good I like flax seed muffins too. If you can get her to drink some carrot juice. If you don&#39;t have one already a juicer would be good to get fresh juice has lots of fiber. As well as some fruits and veggies benefit the colon especially thos with beta carotene in them. She could help you juice my kids love using the juicer.</p>

<p>I myself have Ulcerative Colitis and have to keep my fiber intake just right. Diet plays a huge role in our bodies especially elimination. If our vitamin and mineral level is out of wack somewhere it can really effect the elimination process. The issue with taking a multi vitamin id that everyone&#39;s bodies are different and some vitamins are not water soluable so the body can too much of one vitamin that is where a good diet comes into play. If my 8 year old DD and I get gluten we are in severe pain within minutes. I cant have dairy or caffine either. I don&#39;t stop others in the home from eating these things. I have shared a lot of information with them about foods and the effect they have on the body mind and soul. We eat mostly gluten free and mostly a paleo diet. I bake a lot gf goodies like cookies brownies pies etc... I also make a lot of raw food snacks as well. The beauty of baking at home is knowing what&#39;s in it. A lot of people in this world can&#39;t handle gluten or processed foods and a lot of them don&#39;t realize that a lot of health issues are caused by eating processed foods and gluten. Sense I have went paleo with eating mostly fruit and veggies my uc cleared up within days and i had just gotten out of the hospital for the sixth time in less then four years with a near miss of surgery and a ostomy. I Had realized at that monent after reaching 70lbs, and almost dying that the natetalpath that i had visited was right i needed to go on a paleo diet. I made a lot of paleo goodies for myself to make it easier on me during the die off of the gluten and processed foods. I also realized how very important it is that we are knowlegable and cautious of what we are putting into our bodies. </p>

<p>With all that being said i have noticed that diet makes a big difference in our overall health. How long has this been going on? How long has she been using the potty? Has her diet changed before this started? Is there more change or stress in her environment? All these things are important to consider. There is a natural cure for this. You can find good alternatives to her favorite snacks and foods. Experiment and try making new dishes and snacks that are gluten free and all natural. </p>

<p>I would also suggest looking into going organic as much as possible. There is a dirty dozen list for fruits and veggies that can make it more cost effective. Walmart sells all natural gluten free and gmo free noodles that are less then 2.00. That could be an alternative. I make a mac n cheese for my kids out of real cheese and milk and they love it. There are so many options. My kids love corn chips with sugar and cinnamon on them baked. Breakfast burritos with corn tortillas. So many options out there. You can also find coupons for gluten free and gmo free foods and produce then match with a store sale. I have saved a lot that way that has allowed us to eat thr way we have been. Our health is very important because it determins our mental emotional and physical health. I would start with making some diet changes and trying to not make it to drastic. </p>

<p>I hope some of this helps and that I haven&#39;t overwhelmed you.</p>

 may not do with her bum are probably only going to further stress out a five year old and make her more anxious about it.&nbsp; Also, her decisions about what to ingest are wrapped in not causing herself further discomfort-- there probably isnt much joy to be found in it for her right now if impaction is the case.<br><br>When I searched the archives prior to posting about my son&#39;s impaction, I found a few suggestions about enemas and suppositories.&nbsp; I was able to do a suppository with my son and with the guidance of a nurse friend, used oil and a finger to dislodge the impaction.&nbsp; It was over in less than ten minutes.<br><br>We got some cute fun straw cups my son loves and he takes miralax in those.&nbsp; We just mix it and leave it out all day, and he usually finishes it all.&nbsp; I don&#39;t stress (anymore) when he doesn&#39;t finish a dose one day.&nbsp; If it&#39;s more than a day, then I need to change something up.&nbsp; A different cup?&nbsp;
 Juice instead of water?&nbsp; I pay attention to what&#39;s going on around him when he&#39;s content to sit and sip at the cup.&nbsp; He&#39;s in a comfy spot on the couch, with a movie he loves on.&nbsp; Or on a longish car ride in his seat.&nbsp; I try to offer more of that he hasn&#39;t been finishing it.<br><br>And food-- he eats what he wants, when he wants, regardless of whether or not I think it might cause constipation.&nbsp; He&#39;s not at all interested in how his food affects his pooping.&nbsp; That&#39;s what the miralax is for.&nbsp; I&#39;ve found that the stress level in our home seems to have far more impact on how often he poops than what he&#39;s eating. <br><br>Someone also linked the pages on sandra&#39;s page on gratitude and abundance in the discussion.&nbsp; Wonderful.<br><br><br>Lisa C<br><br><br><div><br></div></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30524238">Miralax!!!  My daughter, 10 months, has Downs Syndrome along with some other serious health issues. She takes diuretics which drain her body of water so her lungs won&#39;t fill with fluids. Results in painful constipation. The Dr. advised me to give her miralax.  After 1 week of taking a dose everyday her stool is so much softer. Mix it with whatever your child likes to drink. I continue with warm baths and massages and if she wants, prunes and applesauce. Sometimes she only wants green beans. At 10 months, this girl knows what kind of baby food she likes!!!<br/>

Now I see there is such a variety of gentle options to get some pooping-friendly foods into his environment, and I can let go of my expectation that he eat x-amount of this, or not eat
 y-amount of that.&nbsp; There&#39;s so much middle ground that I was totally missing.&nbsp; <br><br>My son really liked popsicles made with peach puree, coconut cream, gelatin, and chia seeds soaked in water.&nbsp; And any kind of sweetener (sugar, xylitol, honey, etc) if it&#39;s too plain.&nbsp; You can also use a powdered probiotic in them, or substitute the coconut cream for yogurt.&nbsp; And xylitol can loosen stools actually, but I think it has to be a lot.<br><br>Lisa C<br><div><br></div></div></html></div>

My five year old is suffering from terrible constipation (pain,&nbsp;weeping&nbsp;and screaming &quot;It won&#39;t come out! Why won&#39;t it come out! Come out poop!&quot;)&nbsp; At her doctor&#39;s recommendation, she took Miralax for six days.&nbsp; I am totally comfortable with using bribes or incentives so that is what we (mostly)&nbsp;did in order to get the medicine down.&nbsp; I say &quot;mostly&quot; because sometimes I did lapse into badgering behavior that was not helpful but I caught myself and apologized and let her know that it was her choice to take the medicine to help the poop come out.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this did not clear the blockage and&nbsp;today our doctor is recommending an enema or suppository. My daughter is now refusing to have any medicine and becomes completely distraught when I mention that she can take medicine in her bum.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is back in diapers 24/7. My husband feels that we &quot;have to&quot; make her take an enema or suppository right away.&nbsp; I am concerned about the mental and relationship damage any such enforcement could cause, not to mention the physical impossibility of me restraining her to get the medicine in.&nbsp; I want to offer her time to get used to the idea and a choice of enema or suppository, but I am not sure that even with time and these choices that we will get to anything approaching a &quot;yes.&quot;&nbsp; She says she want to wait for the poop to come out on its own.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is just magical thinking or if I should just&nbsp;step back&nbsp;and trust her or if there are other approaches that I am missing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some background: Thanks to help from this group and other unschooling resources, we have been doing monkey platters for about a year now. I&nbsp;think the constipation is&nbsp;partly due&nbsp;to her food choices.&nbsp;I have shared information with her about what foods can help her poop be soft but I do not restrict her food choices.&nbsp; I let her know what things she could add to her diet but she chooses not to right now and gets really mad if I put a fruit choice on her platter with&nbsp;her regular favorites.&nbsp; So there is no easy diet fix for this. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She&nbsp;has been an every couple of days pooper&nbsp;since she was 2 or so.&nbsp; She&nbsp;uses the toilet to pee but not poop.&nbsp; I have been following a &quot;let her do it in her own time&quot; approach to using the toilet but it appears by taking that route she has developed real pain associated with pooping that I did not recognize.&nbsp; She generally wanted to poop in private in the bedroom so, while I knew she was straining, I did not realize that it was hurting so much that she has begun a withholding pattern.&nbsp; She also weaned about 5 months ago so we no longer have the help of nursing to encourage bowel movements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I also now realize that some of the behaviors that I was attributing to what gets labeled a&nbsp;&quot;highly sensitive&quot; or &quot;highly spirited&quot; temperament, such as wanting to stay home most all of the time and an over-the-top grouchiness, is probably coming from&nbsp;ongoing physical discomfort and a desire to be near a safe place to poop, as much as any personality traits.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think this situation can be a chance to deepen our unschooling practices&nbsp;over the long-term.&nbsp; She&#39;s already drawing pictures of how poop comes out and she and I constructed a handmade doctor&#39;s kit that she is using on all her stuffed animals and our cat.&nbsp; I know the information I have shared is being taken in on her own schedule. But, according to medical sources, the longer we wait to do this enema/suppository, the more her colon will get stretched out of shape and the longer the recovery from that will be.&nbsp;Not to mention that we will need to negotiate if she will take the medicine suggested for the following month or months to help her poop get soft enough to end the withholding pattern&nbsp;and negotiating if she will try sitting on the toilet.&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably more sticker&nbsp;charts and bribes:)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, at this point, we have not been out of the house, except for 2 doctors visits and&nbsp;a trip to the toy store for almost two weeks now and not much outside time at all for the past month.&nbsp;I understand that she wants to stay home but I could use a bit of fresh air and sunshine (or a walk&nbsp;under the moon)&nbsp;to recharge my mothering batteries.&nbsp; I am the only one who she lets&nbsp;her diaper. She wants me to stay in the house with her, period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I want to get at the larger issues here but also&nbsp;want to help her alleviate the <var id="ygrps-yiv-1318777577ygrps-yiv-783894631yui-ie-cursor"></var>immediate blockage.&nbsp; Suggestions?</p></div></span></blockquote></div></div>

Especially with the internet! It&#39;s what you&#39;re trusting your kids can do. :-) So trust yourselves. Show you&#39;re kids you trust you can figure things out. Trust the process of learning about something. Try things. See what happens. Learn from that.</div><div><br></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>
