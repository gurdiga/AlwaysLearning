shock value is &quot;Taste it, and if you hate it you can spit it out in my hand,&quot; and <br/>
I hold my hand out there.   That means they don&#39;t even have to run to the <br/>
sink or trashcan if they want to spit it out.  I think Holly&#39;s the only one who&#39;s <br/>
ever spit it back.<br/>

Sometimes it helps just to let them smell it to decide.<br/>

Last night Marty tried spaghetti again.  He doesn&#39;t like it.  I told him it <br/>
would be really helpful to everyone else if he liked it because it&#39;s so cheap <br/>
and easy to make.  Usually he has just the sauce, with toast or rice, which is <br/>
okay too, really.  So he said he would try again and I gave him a small <br/>
portion which he took to eat in another room. I don&#39;t know whether he liked it; I&#39;ll <br/>
ask next spaghetti day.    I&#39;m just telling this because Marty&#39;s 15 and it&#39;s <br/>
not just toddler-parents whose kids have an aversion that they might or might <br/>
not grow out of. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I make sure there is a drink at hand to wash away the taste too.  <br/>
Jack won&#39;t eat any kind of pasta, or rice.  He rarely eats the same <br/>
dinner as everyone else.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161917335">The only thing that works (or doesn&#39;t depending upon your viewpoint) is <br/>
when I say &quot;I hope you DON&quot;T like this because it means more for me.  <br/>
Usually I really mean that, and they taste and love it.  My kids will <br/>
taste anything once, and have never had a problem trying something. <br/>

fruit.  Always has.  He&#39;s over 30.  Refuses to eat<br/>
anything with visible pieces of fruit, or with bits or<br/>
chunks of fruit in it, or just plain fruit.  No<br/>
jellies or jams, no pies except pumpkin or chocolate,<br/>
no dried fruits, no cookies or cakes with fruit, fruit<br/>
salad, etc.  But he likes strawberry milshakes a lot,<br/>
IF there are no chunks in it.  He will also eat<br/>
applesauce, and my apple stuffed pork chops, if I cut<br/>
the apples really thin and don&#39;t use as much apple in<br/>
the stuffing as usual.  I&#39;m pretty sure it a<br/>
hypersensativity thing to textures.  He also will only<br/>
wear certain types of clothing, won&#39;t drink after<br/>
anyone, even his wife or his 4 kids, is germ and bug<br/>
phobic, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t eaten fruit since I was a tiny baby, except lemons and limes<br/>
(like in lemonade or key lime pie). The idea of eating it turns my<br/>
stomach, and I&#39;m literally nauseated by the smell of bananas. When I was<br/>
8 my dad offered to pay me a quarter if I&#39;d eat a plum, and since I was<br/>
desperately saving for a Baby Alive doll I did, taking infinitesimally<br/>
small bites so it took an hour and a half to do it. He told me later that<br/>
he regretted the offer after the first ten minutes - he had assumed that<br/>
I&#39;d either say no, or say yes and take a bite and realize it wasn&#39;t so<br/>
bad.<br/>
<br/>
Rain won&#39;t eat any fruit either, except apples and lemons and limes,  and<br/>
I did try to offer lots when she was little and she used to like grapes.<br/>
And I know two other woman wh don&#39;t eat fruit, and who also have a<br/>
daughter who doesn&#39;t eat fruit, and they both say bananas are the worst.<br/>
What is the worst fruit to your brother? On woman also has another<br/>
daughter who *does* eat fruit. I wonder if there&#39;s a sort of genetic<br/>
sensitivity to fruit esters that we have, or a sensitivity to the enzymes<br/>
that make these esters. I do think that when kids repeatedly chose not to<br/>
eat something there&#39;s often an underlying biological reason for it, and<br/>
that if we eat what we feel like eating things work out better, generally<br/>
speaking - but food has gotten really complicated these days, with<br/>
artificial stuff designed to fool the body.<br/>
