<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559928717">More ideas?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cool thread....I like this.<br/>
We light candles a lot in the winter. If we don&#39;t feel like messing with a fire in the fireplace (sometimes more work than I have energy for) we light multiple candles and place them inside the fireplace. I have a candle holder designed for fireplaces too. You get the light an ambiance without the mess.<br/>
<br/>
I smudge with sage if there&#39;s too much negative energy floating around.<br/>
Popping some microwave popcorn gives an instant good smell to the house, warm and inviting.<br/>
<br/>
As far as fun indoor activities, tea parties seem to be good mood enhancers.<br/>
<br/>
Or spread a big blanket on the living room floor and have a picnic.<br/>
Buy a very small plastic pool (might be hard to find this time of year though) and fill with popcorn (yes, popped) or dry beans for scooping and pouring or spray shaving cream in designs and play with it, or whip cream and then EAT it! OR put it in the kitchen and fill it up with warm water and have a beach day, messy but really fun, keep lots of towels around.<br/>
<br/>
Have a &quot;food as art&quot; day...use mashed potatoes, jello, carrots etc...for sculpting, no flatware allowed. Squishing mashed potatoes through your fingers is quite satisfying!<br/>
Have a parade. Decorate a wagon or each other, make banners or ribbon poles etc...and parade through the house.<br/>
<br/>
Buy lots of little toys or goodies from the dollar store and keep them in a closet for a day when you need a few tricks up your sleeve. New toys, bath items or books always seem to be good mood busters around here. Wrap them in pretty paper for an even better effect!<br/>
<br/>
Have a treasure hunt! Hide those dollar store things through the house and put clues with each one for them to find the next little thing. <br/>
Or a scavenger hunt, work in teams if possible and make a list of items they have to find in the house. It&#39;s more fun outdoors if the weather is ok, but it can be a good indoor game too. Lists can be varied to make it harder for older kids/adults.<br/>
<br/>
Baking something that smells really great always lifts our spirits. My favorite combination is cinammon rolls and Chai tea from scratch. It&#39;s impossible to feel down when drinking aromatic, spicy Chai. <br/>
<br/>
Have a &quot;backwards&quot; day. Wear your clothes backwards, reverse word meanings, try to do things in reverse order...crazy fun. Yes means no, and no means yes on backwards day!<br/>
<br/>
ok, I&#39;m all used up now...someone elses turn. &#39;Course, I personally use the BEACH as my mood buster...hint, hint.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255817362">&quot;Roast mini-marshmallows on toothpicks over candles.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be a mood downer...BUT lots of candle wicks have lead in them...not to mention some of the crap in the wax that wouldn&#39;t be good to ingest.<br/>
We discovered something really cool though. If you take a heavy duty pan and coat it with butter, then sprinkle some of the mini-marshmallows in and put in the oven under broil for about 2 minutes (watch carefully, they cook quick) it makes a lovely dish of roasted marshmallows! Mmmmmmm.<br/>

We buy beeswax candles from craftedcandles.com so I<br/>
dont&#39; usually worry about that anyway, though.<br/>
<br/>
Candles made in the US are not allowed to have lead<br/>
wicks, but candles imported from other countries may<br/>
contain lead. <br/>
