<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634002282">Talking about the simpson&#39;s : My dad wouldn&#39;t let us watch it when we were growning up (he just saw the t-shirts and didn&#39;t like them) Then he got hurt and spent Alot of time in front of the TV getting better and Now he is their biggest fan (he doesn&#39;t even mine the grandkids watching!)  Shows what an open mind can do huh!<br/>
just think its funny how he made the 360 with a little first hand info<br/>

When The Simpsons first came out there was great hue and cry that children <br/>
would identify with Bart and all become bratty.**<br/>
<br/>
When the first T-shirts came out that said &quot;I&#39;m Bart Simpson -- who the hell are you?&quot; my mom was appalled. (She&#39;s still believes, without watching, that the Simpsons is appalling and is likely to degrade social standards.)<br/>
<br/>
My son recorded and watched 3 episodes of The Simpsons every day for months. He&#39;s intelligent, affectionate, and pretty much well-behaved. Not at all what she would have predicted.<br/>

My dh bought me the &quot;Underachiever and Proud of It, Man&quot; shirt. I <br/>
enjoyed wearing it to church events hosted by the public school teacher <br/>
