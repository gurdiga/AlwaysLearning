Holly  and I got into a<br/>
rambunctious Donkey Conga game that resulted in my  family&#39;s Xmas purchase of<br/>
it (yay!).<br/>

<br/>
OH!  We got Donkey Konga 2.<br/>
The songs aren&#39;t as good (by &quot;good&quot; I mean songs I know and like  &lt;g&gt;), but <br/>
there are a couple of very good games, and you spend the points  you make to <br/>
play the games.  Also, points can be made with two players  together.  So two <br/>
players can play a cooperative game, make points, and  then go and play a <br/>
game-within-the-game together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912878353">I got Jungle Beat for Mother&#39;s Day which isn&#39;t about playing to the<br/>
music, instead it uses the kongo&#39;s as the controller.  Simon and<br/>
Linnaea and I really enjoy it.  It&#39;s gotten even more use than the<br/>
Donkey Konga game.<br/>
