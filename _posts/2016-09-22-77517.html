<div id="ygrps-yiv-545991844">Joyce wrote something in another topic that’s worth looking at just all by itself for the writing and phrasing and for the type of thinking it takes in the reader to parse this—to read it looking for the meaning of each word and phrase.   [I’m not talking about “parse” meaning to diagram it—that’s a newer use of “parse.”]<br/>

Sometimes things need to be read twice, or read one day, and read again the next.<br/>

It’s the difference between creating an environment where they can explore safely and creating a safe environment where they’re allowed to explore.<br/>
<br/>
It’s the difference between putting a barrier around where they’re exploring so they feel safe and putting up a barrier to keep them safe within it.<br/>
<br/>
Put up a barrier that moves with them to keep out the dangerous stuff. Don’t put them inside a barrier to keep them safe.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one of those helps create the image of helping kids explore safely that unschoolers work towards. :-)<br/>

A long time ago I wrote<br/>
 “Try not to learn. Don&#39;t try to learn. Those two aren&#39;t the same thing but they&#39;re close enough for beginners.”<br/>
<br/>
So for those of you who are not beginners anymore, please hang on to this (leave it open, print it, keep it in mind) for a few hours or days, and let me know what you think, please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344796623">The first image that comes to mind is armor vs. a pen. So the way I read Joyce&#39;s comment, a parent should be the &quot;armor,&quot; in the sense that armor is meant to be articulated, flexible, mobile, and customized, rather than be a pen or a cage that is inert and immovable. If your armor is perfect, you shouldn&#39;t even notice it-it will protect you while giving you full range of motion. A wall, on the other hand, you can crash into and it won&#39;t move. <blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1344796623gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:#fff;">
