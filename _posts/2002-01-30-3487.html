<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900322760">Oh Joylyn,<br/>
I got a great laugh out of the slut/clutz mix up! And Mary&#39;s humorous <br/>
post....that&#39;s hilarious.<br/>
I am picturing speaking with a Southern Baptist Fundi and saying &quot;Geez, I&#39;m <br/>
such a slut&quot; and what their face would do!!! Oh...too funny.<br/>
<br/>
Ari,<br/>
We&#39;ve all been through the tv debate so much, I think some of us would prefer <br/>
to discuss anything else!! Well, not totally. I don&#39;t mind if people are <br/>
really interested in understanding the letting children choose issue, but to <br/>
come here and post any anti tv arguements is a moot point. We&#39;ve all BTDT. We <br/>
have chosen a different path and are happy with that choice. If you want to <br/>
understand why, I think you&#39;ll get a lot of great answers. If you want to try <br/>
and convince anyone differently with anti-tv information, you are really just <br/>
wasting your energy, YK?<br/>
Discussing is great. Debating an issue that (I think) most of the people here <br/>
have already dealt with is different.<br/>
Or maybe I&#39;m putting words into people&#39;s mouths....don&#39;t want to do that. <br/>
Just giving you my view on the whole topic.<br/>
<br/>
Now for my rant,<br/>
I have a friend that I really do enjoy for the most part. But we met under <br/>
the guise of her being an unschooler..which is not the case.<br/>
I am wondering if that is why some of the things she says just really bug <br/>
me!! I seem able to let go when another friend has opposing view points, but <br/>
it&#39;s harder with her.<br/>
She did tell me she&#39;s not an unschooler at one point, so I should understand <br/>
that we won&#39;t agree...but it just rankles me!!<br/>
Topics like spanking, letting children choose etc... are hot buttons to be <br/>
avoided. We don&#39;t agree at all.<br/>
As we parted company today, her kids were begging to come over to our house. <br/>
I had said &quot;sure, great&quot; when mine invited hers over.<br/>
But she was bent on going home because they all had vitamins to take? They <br/>
have a special diet and we didn&#39;t have proper food for them (no, it has <br/>
nothing to do with allergies, just a control issue). Then they asked if they <br/>
could come AFTER lunch and her answer was that they &quot;needed&quot; to be outdoors <br/>
..&quot;whether  they liked it or not&quot;<br/>
When they voiced their dissent (they really, really wanted to be with my <br/>
kids) she replied &quot;this is not a democracy, it&#39;s a dictatorship&quot; end of <br/>
discussion.<br/>
I feel so sad for those kids.<br/>
To feel powerless to even choose who you hang out with or what you do....ugh.<br/>
She feels she is making these choices for their health.<br/>
What about their emotional health? Does this not even enter these parent&#39;s <br/>
heads? It&#39;s not just about WHAT you eat, or WHAT you do.....it&#39;s about being <br/>
a whole person. Able to choose your own path. Emotional health is more <br/>
important to me.<br/>

I snipped your rant about your friend but I<br/>
hear ya.  I know I&#39;m not truly an unschooler<br/>
yet, but I&#39;m really heading in that<br/>
dierction.  I&#39;m trying and learning.  But the<br/>
parents that try to control food--it drives<br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t emotional health &quot;not on the test&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of an &quot;extracurricular activity,&quot; or more likely a home-problem.  <br/>
Unless it comes to BD (Behavior disorder) so that the school can get more <br/>
funding and put you in a special class, why would your emotional health  <br/>
matter?<br/>
<br/>
And for priorities, physical health shows, it&#39;s measurable.  Behavior shows <br/>
to grandma and neighbors.  But &quot;emotional&quot; stuff?  How and what you *FEEL*?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you how to feel, missy!  Feel grateful that we don&#39;t  just put you <br/>
in school!   So do what we tell you to do!<br/>
<br/>
(I wish I knew not one single family to base this line of thinking on.  I <br/>
wish I was saying &quot;I don&#39;t understand how a homeschooling family can no care <br/>
about their children&#39;s feelings.&quot;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing that *might* help both you and her kids is, when she <br/>
first starts this kind of conversation with them, to get up and get <br/>
very clearly out of hearing range as quickly as you can.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I suggest this is that some people REALLY show off <br/>
to a crowd (my mother, for one). If she&#39;s got you there listening, <br/>
she might just be playing to you, &quot;See, these kids don&#39;t push me <br/>
around&quot; or &quot;I have such clever arguments, admire me&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, sometimes the opposite is true and you&#39;re in a better <br/>
position to know this woman than I am -- sometimes getting out <br/>
of range might be a cue for her to stop being &quot;easy&quot; on them (in <br/>
her mind), and would be worse for the kids.<br/>

&quot;Heathen&quot;  Unsaved is good though.<br/>
<br/>
I was sitting at a table with some other<br/>
homeschoolers (school at homers,  we can&#39;t<br/>
afford the local christain or catholic school<br/>
so we homeschool because we don&#39;t want our<br/>
kids with those heathens in public<br/>
school-ers--it was at a friend&#39;s house) and a<br/>
few of the girls (not mine) were playing<br/>
&#39;going to heaven&quot; and I made a under my<br/>
breath comment that I was glad my girls<br/>
weren&#39;t up involved in that game and she said<br/>
&quot;well, why not.&quot;  I said, well I don&#39;t<br/>
believe in heaven, and I&#39;m damn sure I don&#39;t<br/>
believe in hell.&#39;  I then realized that I<br/>
loved my friend too much to get involved in<br/>
this conversation in her house and needed to<br/>
go outside, but I&#39;m sure that is what the<br/>
other homeschooler thinks of me now.  My<br/>
friend is also catholic and sends her kids to<br/>
the catholic school, but she&#39;s less<br/>
judgemental and actually we have very good<br/>
discussions about such things.  When I left I<br/>
said &quot;thanks for letting us heathens come<br/>
visit.&quot;  She just laughed.<br/>
<br/>
I just laugh at the game &quot;going to heaven.&#39;<br/>
