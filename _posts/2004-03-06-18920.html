saying, I think. So Sandra can, typically, say, &quot;Marty, that&#39;s loud,&quot;<br/>
(she doesn&#39;t even have to make a request - just gently bring his<br/>
attention to it) and Marty would immediately become cognizant of his<br/>
surroundings, recognize what other people were trying to do there,<br/>
understand that his loudness was impinging on their ability to do it,<br/>
and he would CARE enough to inconvenience himself.<br/>
<br/>
However, sometimes a child may not see the sense in a request. The<br/>
assumption that a child is rational is generally true, imo, but that<br/>
rationality is constrained by their knowledge and their ability to<br/>
predict consequences AND their ability to be empathetic.  Although<br/>
discussing it helps them along in that development, they may simply not<br/>
have enough background knowledge, they may confuse what they hope would<br/>
be the consequences with the actual possible consequences and they<br/>
simply may not care.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Funny, Trayton sometimes is impatient with me b/c he sees what I think may<br/>
be a problem, disagrees with me, makes his own call and assumes it will be<br/>
fine.  For example, he often walks around with a long wooden dowel he uses<br/>
as a prop or as a karate staff.  And although he has on occasion bumped<br/>
someone with it (not lately) he is pretty adept at knowing within inches<br/>
that he has enough clearance.  Nevertheless, It drives me crazy to see so<br/>
many &quot;close calls&quot; (to him these are expertly executed near misses).  For my<br/>
own comfort and the safety of people and property alike, we have some rules:<br/>
Don&#39;t practice in the house, If it&#39;s in the car, it needs to ride in the<br/>
trunk area, and keep it out of the parent circle at park day.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean to frighten or annoy and he honestly forgets these rules at times b/c<br/>
to him, there is no problem. When he remembers, which to be fair is most of<br/>
the time these days, he&#39;s just following my request out of respect for my<br/>
feelings, not because he perceives the rule makes sense.  To him we&#39;re just<br/>
all being overly cautious. He he he :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608479414">I sure could use some helpful advice here.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my 13 year old daughter had a girlfriend<br/>
(12) over for the evening.  She&#39;s a new friend and<br/>
we&#39;re living in a new town and right now, she&#39;s the<br/>
only friend.<br/>
<br/>
This was maybe her fourth or fifth visit here, they<br/>
stayed mostly out on the deck, listening to music and<br/>
talking or so we thought.  After we took the<br/>
girlfriend home, my daughter told us that a boy they<br/>
didn&#39;t know had come by (hearing their noise and<br/>
music) and they&#39;d sneaked him up on the deck and he&#39;d<br/>
been there all evening with them.  At first, he said<br/>
he was 17, later he said he was 15.  We found a beer<br/>
can last night, the girls said he drank it.    <br/>
<br/>
Dh and I were around all night but everytime we came<br/>
around the deck, the girls would come inside and he<br/>
would hide until we left.  Mostly we were downstairs.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time anything remotely like this has<br/>
happened with my daughter (not the hiding/sneaking<br/>
part, just the boy and beer parts).  <br/>
<br/>
Our initial plan was just to talk to her about it.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning, we insisted that the girl tell her<br/>
mother what happened before she come over here again. <br/>
(She was very concerned that we would call her mother<br/>
and tell her).  And that the girl&#39;s mother call me and<br/>
let me know she knew what had occurred (We&#39;ve already<br/>
been lied to once about what mom giving permission for<br/>
her to come over).  <br/>
<br/>
As for the boy, who is &quot;really really nice&quot;, we said<br/>
he could knock on the door and we&#39;d meet him and take<br/>
it from there. That was before we found two more beer<br/>
cans in the yard, the girls said they drank none and<br/>
we saw no signs that they might have.<br/>
<br/>
This morning the girl says she can&#39;t tell her mom,<br/>
she&#39;ll be grounded forever, never allowed to see my<br/>
daughter again (something like this happened before<br/>
with another girl and that was the outcome), she&#39;ll<br/>
never  be allowed to live with her father, and her mom<br/>
has slapped her in the face.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is sure that the friendship is over (if<br/>
she doesn&#39;t tell her mom, we won&#39;t let her come over;<br/>
if she does tell her mom, she&#39;ll never be allowed to<br/>
come over again), both girls are in tears, her mom<br/>
still doesn&#39;t know.  My daughter is saying now we have<br/>
to let her be friends with the boy because she has no<br/>
one else.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling really emotionally torn and unsure what to<br/>
do next.  Help?<br/>

I would let it slide if it were me.<br/>

The other girl might need you and your understanding MUCH more than she needs <br/>
trouble with her parents.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the boy is nice.  Maybe the boy&#39;s wonderful.  Maybe he&#39;s not.  But the <br/>
girls aren&#39;t hurt, and they had a little adventure without ever leaving the <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
Next time the girl&#39;s coming over, maybe call her mom to make sure it&#39;s okay, <br/>
and chit chat with her about what time and how the girl should get home.  <br/>
Don&#39;t rat her out, just have direct conversation with her mom so that the girls <br/>
aren&#39;t in a position to bend the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Tell them to stay in the house instead of out on the deck.<br/>
<br/>
If she meets the boy in daylight, you talk to him and tell him the beer was a <br/>
really bad idea, and leaving trash in your yard was even worse.   Look him in <br/>
the eye when you say it.   He&#39;ll respond one way or another, but you&#39;ll have <br/>
a better idea of his honesty/directness/character, etc. (if you&#39;re any good at <br/>
people-reading, and if he is, vice versa about you).<br/>
<br/>
Over-reaction is bad in these cases.<br/>

assumtion that my dd would know that I would trust her in a situation <br/>
like that, and she would let her friends know that I&#39;m cool with <br/>
visitors.<br/>
I would also expect her to let anyone know that the beer wasn&#39;t okay, <br/>
and to get rid of it if they wanted to hang out.  <br/>
If I found out that my assumption was wrong and my dd felt a need to <br/>
be sneaky, I would be really suprised and wonder where the <br/>
communication break down happened.<br/>
She knows that there is no punishment, that there is discussion <br/>
instead, if things are confusing or mistakes are made. <br/>
