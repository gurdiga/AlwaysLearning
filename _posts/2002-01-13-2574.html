<div id="ygrps-yiv-616489629">I find it possible to live mindfully and in<br/>
<br/>
the present, and to also think about that which cannot be proven. I don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
see pondering the imponderables as letting wishfulness guide one&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
decisions. But I&#39;m also not out to convince anyone else that I have anything<br/>
<br/>
all figured out. My path is mine alone, whether or not someone has joined me<br/>
<br/>
before or not.  Mary<br/>
<br/>
I like this Mary... I think there is so much we don&#39;t know about what&#39;s<br/>
going on in the Universe that I&#39;d rather keep an open mind to the<br/>
possibilities that are out there in all aspects of my life.... I live in the<br/>
present..<br/>
