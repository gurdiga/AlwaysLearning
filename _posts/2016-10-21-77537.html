If it&#39;s mostly coming from people your husband works with/knows/family then i&#39;d make my own account on FB and not friend those people, and stop sharing an account with my husband so I don&#39;t see that kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
If I have friends on FB that continually post negative stuff like that, I&#39;ll defriend them, and if I don&#39;t feel like I can do that (because they are family, or people I see IRL a lot) I hide their posts. FB is my happy place...I will do all I can to keep it
 that way :)&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201464825">I don&#39;t think my parents ever *let* me touch a hot stove. I can&#39;t remember if my children ever did. I sure tried to keep them away from hot/sharp surfaces until they were old enough to understand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quinn says that once he touched the hot metal surface at a buffet and Leif has bumped the edge of the frying pan while helping make dinner. Neither was a memorable occasion. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an adult, I&#39;m a spectacular klutz and provided lots of opportunities for my kids to see what happens if you touch a hot surface.  Sometimes they&#39;ve laughed with me when the injury was minor and the situation was ridiculous. (Knocking the big carving knife off of the counter and onto my bare foot just after starting blood thinners is one example. I got lucky and it didn&#39;t even break the skin. I think the laughter was mostly relief that we weren&#39;t on the way to the ER)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you ignore  these type of posts?  Give feedback? Unfriend?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen the one about the spanking/gang members. I unfriend if someone posts too many things like that (except a couple of family members -- those I just try to ignore)  I&#39;m not going to reform the people who are posting them, at least not the ones in my life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392823878">-=-Your post actually brings up another question for me. Do you ignore these type of posts?  Give feedback? Unfriend? -=-<br/>
<br/>
In the days long before facebook, I got an e-mail with several people on it (eight or ten), with some jokes about kids that were all mean. Cruel adults (parent or teacher) jokes, sent by a teacher I knew in another state, had known for years.  I knew three of the people on the copy list were teachers, and it was probably sent to me because I had been a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I responded, and I don’t remember exactly what I said, but in a reply to all, I said that as a parent, I didn’t think cruelty should be laughed about, and that teachers should be more compassionate or some such, and responded to the whole group.   One person wrote and said “I don’t even know who you are, and don’t know why this is in my mailbox,” and someone else wrote that it was humor, and I shouldn’t be critical.<br/>
<br/>
It was pretty much the end of my friendship with someone in that group, which is okay.<br/>
<br/>
On facebook, depending who it is, I might just write “not really funny,” or “Wouldn’t be funny if it were a joke about violence to a woman,” or maybe would ignore or unfriend.  Depends.<br/>

<div>I rarely respond to those mean-to-kids or parents-shouldn&#39;t-be-their-kids&#39;-friends memes (I don&#39;t see them too often either, thank heavens), but I will always &quot;like&quot; and maybe comment on or repost things that are about connection and compassion towards
 children.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I have relied a lot on the &quot;unfollow&quot; option on Facebook to stop seeing posts from people who I don&#39;t necessarily want to unfriend (that usually feels like too big of a statement to me) but who post too much stuff that bothers me. It&#39;s a great tool for
 cleaning up your newsfeed. &#55357;&#56842;<br>
