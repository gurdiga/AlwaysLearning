<div id="ygrps-yiv-150441790">Here&#39;s something some of you might want to ask for, or to buy to give away, and it will be a gift to your children and family if you don&#39;t own these, and you can incorporate some of the ideas in them!  <br/>

<br/>
Three books together:  The Big Book of Unschooling, Free to Learn and Moving a Puddle<br/>
<br/>
US, cover price, free shipping.<br/>
Canada, $5 for shipping (which costs $12.95, actually).<br/>
Others/further, $10 for shipping (which will cost $16.95; I usually charge $15 per individual book for shipping)<br/>
<br/>
BUT the post office has just this summer made a bigger flat-rate envelope that will hold more than one book.  Woohoo!  <br/>
<br/>

If you already have all those books and  nobody to give them to, but you still want a great unschooling Christmas, consider a trip to Albuquerque!  If your kids have received great Christmas gifts and the dad wants to hang out with them in some peace and quiet, maybe it would make a good visit-with-other-parents trip, for those whose kids are old enough for that sort of thing.<br/>

If Albuquerque seems crazy, is Minneapolis in May a bit less crazy?<br/>
