Tamzin (the original spelling was Tamsin - but no one<br/>
pronounced it right over here, so we changed the<br/>
spelling) is a southern pansy (and a lovely one at<br/>
that) with a Cornish name. I lived in London for the<br/>
first 8 years and Brighton for the last 4 years (T was<br/>
born in London). I love Cornwall! That&#39;s where I<br/>
wanted to live, but ex-dh was a muso and London was<br/>
the &#39;centre of the musical universe&#39;. How are you<br/>
adjusting to the US? I&#39;m finding it a bit difficult<br/>
(and I was raised here - LOL!).<br/>

wears off after about 18 months :(<br/>
My family are cornish and have broad accents, then we moved to Ireland<br/>
and then yorkshire, then the south. I did my degree in london - where I<br/>
tried to lose my yokelised accent but once we moved to the west country,<br/>
back it came. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
People here in Virginia often ask me to repeat things cos they don&#39;t<br/>
understand what I just said although they all recognise me as english. I<br/>
can copy any accent from the UK so sometimes I&#39;ll change to scottish or<br/>
welsh or yorks, mainly people don&#39;t actually notice although Glaswegian<br/>
means communications problems :)<br/>
<br/>
We went back home for Christmas and have been back in the US for two<br/>
days and I&#39;m homesick again. I did, however, arrive back with 5 bottles<br/>
of gin :)<br/>

I have a hard time understanding Yorkshire or Cornwall and thereabout.<br/>
<br/>
Holly didn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a hard time understanding some people from the eastern edge of Arkansas <br/>
once.  THAT was disturbing.   I can understand any Texan or Okie, and most <br/>
southerners, and I thought Arkansas&#39;s right there, it&#39;s no problem.  But the <br/>
rhythm or &quot;tune&quot; of the words was wrong, and I was missing my clues. And the <br/>
words were unfamiliar sometimes--terminology itself.   (And that might have <br/>
been my problem with Yorkshire.  They call things what they call things, and <br/>
they contract and slur words differently.)<br/>
<br/>
So &quot;roze nairs&quot; was nothingness to me, and even when I saw the ears of corn <br/>
&quot;roze nairs&quot; wasn&#39;t English, because in my life that had always been &quot;sweet <br/>
corn.&quot;  Now it was (I was taught when I recovered) &quot;roastin&#39; ears.&quot;   WHY?  <br/>
They boiled it.  <br/>
<br/>
Very disturbing for me. &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
