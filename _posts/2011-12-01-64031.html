Please PLEASE, for the good of every member of that group and of unschooling itself, call it an unschooling group.<br/>

From that page:<br/>
I don&#39;t always get my way, but I have attempted to keep jargon out of unschooling discussions I&#39;m in. When a new term is proposed, I rush to be the first to say &quot;Use plain English, please.&quot; Some people are using &quot;RU&quot; and pronouncing it &quot;ARE YOU&quot; or &quot;RUE&quot; and some people are &quot;Ruing,&quot; and I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s a bad idea.<br/>
