<div id="ygrps-yiv-192424782">Photo/Image contest with four categories:<br/>
<br/>
Animal, Mineral, Vegetable or Video<br/>
<br/>
Each image submitted should include the Learn Nothing Day logo/art.   <br/>
If you buy a t-shirt or magnet or notebook or something, that could  <br/>
be in the photo. Time is running out, so order soon to get things by  <br/>
the 24th!)<br/>
Alternatively, the image in a variety of sizes may be lifted freely  <br/>
for use:<br/>
                  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/images">http://sandradodd.com/learnnothingday/images</a><br/>
<br/>
Animal:  The photo/image should have at least one animal of some  <br/>
sort, and the logo.<br/>
Mineral:  The mineral is... a mirror.  Silicon as in glass. Or  <br/>
silicon as represented by a computer.  MIrror or computer (not  <br/>
pottery or bricks or sand or rocks, though they can be there  <br/>
secondarily, of course, in any of the photos).  And the logo.<br/>
Vegetable:  Plant(s) and the logo.  The photo can also have people,  <br/>
animals, whatever... but having a botanical element is the ticket.<br/>
Video:  The logo in a video or animated gif or flash cartoon or  <br/>
something.  An image that moves, and that I can put on a webpage.<br/>
<br/>
Images can be profound, or funny, or artsy, or might show people not  <br/>
learning, or learning.  Have fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There will be several-to-many judges, at least two of whom aren&#39;t  <br/>
unschoolers and won&#39;t know anyone involved.<br/>
My relatives are ineligible.<br/>
Entry equals agreement to let me put the image on a webpage with  <br/>
other Learn Nothing Day art and materials.<br/>
Entrants can be individuals or teams or families.<br/>
More than one category is fine.<br/>
More than one entry per category is fine.<br/>
Entries can be on blogs or other places first, during and after the  <br/>
contest.  No problem.  Send me an image or a link to the image.   <br/>
You&#39;ll still own it, but I want to be able to have them on display  <br/>
all year until next Learn Nothing Day (or indefinitely, if this is  <br/>
the last one ever).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Winners will receive a one-of-a-kind quite-personalized certificate,  <br/>
and a copy of Moving a Puddle or a set of Thinking Sticks.<br/>
If the winner has all that stuff already, I&#39;ll send something else.   <br/>
I don&#39;t know what.  Depends who wins.<br/>
<br/>
There will be at least four winning entries, and maybe more.<br/>
<br/>
Entries will be accepted through July 26, with winners announced by  <br/>
the end of July.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about writing and poetry, but that disturbed me with school- <br/>
and-teacher feelings.  Writing should be for fun and practicality.   <br/>
And so I do apologize for those of you who have been art students and  <br/>
might have school-and-teacher feelings wrapped up in imagery.  Sorry  <br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Here end the rules and the disclaimers.    You might think of some  <br/>
questions, and that could lead to more rules.<br/>
Y&#39;know why it  has rules?  Because it&#39;s a game.  Thanks for playing.<br/>
<br/>
