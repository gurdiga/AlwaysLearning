<div id="ygrps-yiv-500944001">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I joined this list I&#39;ve heard mention let the kids decide. Now, <br/>
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a wild unschooler. Maybe I would be more wild in the wild, <br/>
for now I&#39;m living in suburbia. I do let the kiddos decide much of their <br/>
world. Mine are little, 7, 5, 2. I wish I had no TV. would be much easier.  <br/>
I do find the kids need to have more interactive, real experiences and less <br/>
passive ones, so I limit their TV. I like my kids to find the resources <br/>
laying around. When they watch TV they forget to play. I really turned to <br/>
homeschooling to allow them unlimited play time, to be themselves in their <br/>
home. So, anyone want to talk about TV and unschooling again?<br/>
<br/>
My little guy never gets enough TV. He would watch every movie every day <br/>
forever. He tantrums for the TV to be on longer all the time. The more he <br/>
watches the more he asks the more he wants.I also notice he has less ability <br/>
to contain his wilds after watching TV. His body needs to go. I wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
him eat all the sugar in the house either. I quess I&#39;m not comfortable <br/>
letting him choose what is right for him yet. Maybe I will grow to see he <br/>
does have inner control. When it comes to TV and computer stuff, he will go <br/>
for ever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503822488">&lt;&lt; When it comes to TV and computer stuff, he will go <br/>
for ever. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is an unfair statement.  You&#39;ve never given him &quot;forever,&quot; so you don&#39;t <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
You probably know families in which TV is very limited, and the children <br/>
always feel needy concerning TV.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go to www.unschooling.com you can read about lots of families who <br/>
don&#39;t limit it, whose kids turn it off (or don&#39;t turn it on for days).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
him eat all the sugar in the house either. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you let him try, he would not eat &quot;all the sugar in the house.&quot;  And if he <br/>
ate a lot for a day or two, he would get to the point that he was tired of <br/>
it, and no longer crave it as a forbidden substance, or feel deprived.<br/>
<br/>
Your thinking on such matters seems to be either you yourself dole out and <br/>
control, or the children on their own will never come to a limit.  &quot;All in <br/>
the house,&quot; or &quot;forever.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969589838">***Ever since I joined this list I&#39;ve heard mention let the kids decide. <br/>
Now,<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a wild unschooler. Maybe I would be more wild in the wild,<br/>

<br/>
Hey, I live in suburbia, in a TOWNHOUSE in a COMMUTE town. I<br/>
out-tame-neighborhood anybody any day. &lt;g&gt; You can be a wild unschooler<br/>
anyplace (well, okay Sandra, not in Swiss Boarding School &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
*** I do let the kiddos decide much of their<br/>
world. Mine are little, 7, 5, 2. I wish I had no TV. would be much easier.<br/>
I do find the kids need to have more interactive, real experiences and less<br/>
passive ones, so I limit their TV.***<br/>
<br/>
But below, your son is finding more tantrum, whining experiences by NOT<br/>
watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
*** I like my kids to find the resources<br/>
laying around.***<br/>
<br/>
What resources? The TV is just laying around (well, okay, you probably keep<br/>
it up on some kind of stand or shelf, but you get the point). Resources are<br/>
resources are resources. TV is no less valuable than a book. A book is no<br/>
more valuable than a jar of peanut butter and a piece of straw. A jar of<br/>
peanut butter and a piece of straw hold no more or less importance than a<br/>
sunbeam and a comfy couch. Unschooling is life.<br/>
<br/>
*** When they watch TV they forget to play. I really turned to<br/>
homeschooling to allow them unlimited play time, to be themselves in their<br/>
home.***<br/>
<br/>
Themselves in their own home want to watch more TV. They won&#39;t forget to<br/>
play if it&#39;s important to them.<br/>
<br/>
*** So, anyone want to talk about TV and unschooling again?***<br/>
<br/>
I *LOVE* talking about TV and unschooling. I even talk about it to<br/>
school-at-homers who HATE TV and would like me to agree with them for some<br/>
reason (well, I know the reason: the reason is that I tell people flat out<br/>
that my girls love TV and watch as much as they want and that tends to be a<br/>
lot by many if not most people&#39;s standards and yet, and YET -- pay<br/>
attention, here&#39;s the good part! -- they continue to walk upright, do not<br/>
drag their knuckles and don&#39;t even know how to belch yet! They are slender,<br/>
funny, bright, cheerful, thrifty, brave, kind, daring, and better than steak<br/>
sauce. People HATE that about them when I&#39;m telling them that TV not only<br/>
didn&#39;t cause them to become sub-humanoids, it actually HELPS them because<br/>
it&#39;s what they choose and there&#39;s much to be learned from it. But not<br/>
necessarily more than from a piece of straw and a jar of peanut butter. Um,<br/>
I think this parentheses break needed it&#39;s own chapter. Sorry about that.)<br/>
<br/>
***My little guy never gets enough TV. He would watch every movie every day<br/>
forever.***<br/>
<br/>
He really, really, really wouldn&#39;t. Really. I can say this and I haven&#39;t<br/>
even met the lad. At some point, he would really need to go to the bathroom.<br/>
And even if he didn&#39;t, he wouldn&#39;t. Really.<br/>
<br/>
*** He tantrums for the TV to be on longer all the time. The more he<br/>
watches the more he asks the more he wants.***<br/>
<br/>
Put it on and let it stay on for a full year. No, two years. The reason he<br/>
cannot limit himself is because you&#39;re limiting him. There is no way for him<br/>
to find his natural patterns if you&#39;re there either demanding or cajoling<br/>
him away from the TV.<br/>
<br/>
***I also notice he has less ability<br/>
to contain his wilds after watching TV. His body needs to go.***<br/>
<br/>
Then let it go! After he watches TV if he&#39;s full of vim and vigor (I don&#39;t<br/>
even know what vim is, I remember the expression from somewhere and can only<br/>
hope it isn&#39;t x-rated. Nancy, help? &lt;g&gt;) design a mad relay race around the<br/>
house for everyone, including the dog, who&#39;d like to participate. Then a<br/>
family jog to the local park. Then jumping jacks! You&#39;ll all be fit and trim<br/>
and he gets to watch his TV and de-pressurize after. Everyone wins!<br/>
<br/>
*** I wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
him eat all the sugar in the house either.***<br/>
<br/>
I also let my daughters eat all the sugar they want. People also hate THAT,<br/>
especially when my ridiculous healthy daughters race around and ask me in<br/>
the morning (with a large bowl of candy ALWAYS available) if I would please<br/>
make them a bagel. Seriously, people HATE that.<br/>
<br/>
*** I quess I&#39;m not comfortable<br/>
letting him choose what is right for him yet. Maybe I will grow to see he<br/>
does have inner control. When it comes to TV and computer stuff, he will go<br/>
for ever.***<br/>
<br/>
No, again, he won&#39;t. It might feel like forever while you&#39;re adjusting your<br/>
prejudices, but it&#39;s not anywhere near forever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114811861">This was one of my questions, also. I have a four-year-old. He didn&#39;t<br/>
begin watching TV until he was 2.5. My husband and I would rather do<br/>
other things. I read. He plays on the computer. Starting at 2, he<br/>
watched half an hour a day, if that. Now he watches 1 to 1 and a half<br/>
hours a day, if that. He doesn&#39;t watch everyday. When his time is over,<br/>
he turns off the TV. He chooses what he watches. He loves Redwall, but<br/>
doesn&#39;t like Anne of Green Gables, so if he wants to watch more on<br/>
Sunday morning, he puts a tape on. What I did was have guidelines. He<br/>
may have complained in the beginning. I don&#39;t remember it. He&#39;s a rather<br/>
rational guy. <br/>
 <br/>
From what I reading, (I&#39;m so new to the unschooling concept) is that you<br/>
think your child should choose what he does, at every point? Is that<br/>
right? <br/>
 <br/>
I know that with our lifestyle there&#39;s lots more for Isey to do than<br/>
watch TV. So it&#39;s not something he wants to do all the time. By having<br/>
an enriched environment, he chooses other things. I get that. Okay now<br/>
to other things. Brushing his teeth. He has to do it. But won&#39;t unless I<br/>
remind him to. He&#39;d leave his toys out all over, unless I remind him to.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Is part of the unschooling philosophy to not tell them to do anything? I<br/>
get that message from reading some of the posts. But I also read one of<br/>
Sandra&#39;s essays about Moving Water, where she asked her son to empty the<br/>
water gun. So, I&#39;m not sure. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m really curious about this. And if it is part of the philosophy not<br/>
to tell Little Ones to brush their teeth, how do you deal with that<br/>
Dragon Breath? :)<br/>
 <br/>
Just plain curious,<br/>

<br/>
Rational does not equal learning not to complain about other people<br/>
scheduling your time and activities, IMHO. Resigned, maybe.<br/>

right? ***<br/>
<br/>
I think my daughters should choose how to spend their time, from the<br/>
activities and resources around us. This includes the television. It isn&#39;t<br/>
limited to the television. I trust (that&#39;s a key word, if I were teaching a<br/>
class right now I&#39;d tell you it would be on the test &lt;g&gt;) that in the<br/>
process of spending their time as they wish, they will learn everything they<br/>
need to know to become normal, sane members of society. So far, so good.<br/>
<br/>
***I know that with our lifestyle there&#39;s lots more for Isey to do than<br/>

<br/>
What do you consider an enriched environment? You may just mean you have<br/>
plenty of craft supplies and a kite-making book, but the phrase sets off<br/>
educationese alarm bells in my head. Resources, as I think I may have<br/>
yammered on one post ago, are resources. A set of encyclopedias is not<br/>
inherently more educational than the cat or a pair of tennis shoes. And<br/>
definitely not more educational than the cat AND the tennis shoes together!<br/>
(feeble cat humor, my cat would be rolling his eyes if he could read this).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some unschoolers are non-coercive parents and would not make their children<br/>
brush their teeth, but it&#39;s not an unschooling precept. My daughters are<br/>
required to brush their teeth or let me brush them, same with hair if they<br/>
want to keep it long and they do. They sometimes have to go places when<br/>
they&#39;d prefer to stay home, if other arrangements can&#39;t be made (they&#39;re too<br/>
young currently to stay on their own). There are lots of other things that<br/>
they do naturally to be decent human beings, so I have no need to force them<br/>
-- please and thank you and not shrieking at each other and not kicking the<br/>
cat are natural, painless behaviors in our household.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350394734">Okay, as I sent my post in, two others came back with the answers to my<br/>
questions. Wow! I think that&#39;s all I can say. Your complete trust is<br/>
amazing. It&#39;s something I will strive for, like I strive for spiritual<br/>
enlightenment. I have *Major* issues with the TV. I grew up with the TV<br/>
as my parents. I didn&#39;t want to do anything but be in front of the TV.<br/>
It was my drug, until I discovered drugs and alcohol. So me and TV are<br/>
not good friends. I loved dancing when I was a kid. Loved this ballet<br/>
class I was taking. Then a cartoon I liked came on while ballet class<br/>
was in session. I quit ballet to watch that cartoon. It was all downhill<br/>
from there. I know that&#39;s my trip and my household is much more stable<br/>

to clear up my TV issues. (that&#39;s a joke)<br/>

Kirby wanted bagels.  <br/>
I forgot to get bagels.<br/>

We have now ten on-sale boxes of breakfast cereal (we had four teenaged boys <br/>
here all weekend, and will have two or three in and out during the week), but <br/>
Kirby wanted bagels.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night I offered to take him and one of the others to the store to get <br/>
anything they wanted.  They decided to just make the world&#39;s best peanut <br/>
butter sandwiches. We had a new container of Peter Pan smooth.  They <br/>
ceremoniously opened and inhaled the brand-new smell, and Kirby made two <br/>
sandwiches with that, cream cheese, and a little home-made honey jar that had <br/>
to opened with a corkscrew (had been sealed with cork and wax).  <br/>
<br/>
Given a choice between anything at a grocery store half a mile a way and <br/>
peanut butter sandwiches made by kids, they chose peanut butter.<br/>
<br/>
This would never have come about without the freedom to choose.  Real freedom <br/>
and real choices.<br/>

the lessons as much as I loved hearing my parents be proud, and loved hearing <br/>
my parents say I loved the lessons.  And I still play piano for fun and for <br/>
purposes--learning tunes, goofing, playing around, &quot;demonstrating musical <br/>
principles&quot; (answering Holly&#39;s questions like &quot;What is an octave again?&quot;).  <br/>
<br/>
But NOW there are VCRs and kids&#39; favorite shows can be taped for later <br/>
viewing!<br/>
Now kids can watch a show that&#39;s on at the same time as piano or ballet, so <br/>
that old problem is moot.  NOW kids will not have the TV to blame if they <br/>
want to quit a class.  <br/>
<br/>
Classes can be picked up again later.  I took piano lessons later, when I was <br/>
12 or so and following.   I missed Gilligan&#39;s Island re-runs to do it, too.<br/>

Classes can be picked up again later.  I took piano lessons later, when<br/>
I was <br/>
12 or so and following.   I missed Gilligan&#39;s Island re-runs to do it,<br/>
too.<br/>

 <br/>
Yes, Sandra, they can. It&#39;s my big gift to myself this year, to take<br/>
some sort of dance class. Been telling all the moms at homeschool<br/>
meetings that I&#39;m gonna do it. Now I gotta get off my duff and do it. I<br/>
can&#39;t blame TV now. DAMN! It&#39;s all on my shoulders. The pressure. (said<br/>

What do you consider an enriched environment? <br/>
 <br/>
I mean parents who love him and have created a lifestyle where we are<br/>
both around  A LOT, where we live without so that he can have us around<br/>
to read to him whenever he wants, listen to him play the violin, play in<br/>
the mud (there is a complete tunnel system in my backyard he and dh<br/>
designed), go to the library, create all things Lego, create blanket<br/>
playhouses, cast runes, clean the pool, talk about the seasons, follow<br/>
his lead, do fun things. Enriched to me means a house full of love. <br/>
 <br/>
You may just mean you have<br/>
plenty of craft supplies and a kite-making book, but the phrase sets off<br/>
educationese alarm bells in my head. Resources, as I think I may have<br/>
yammered on one post ago, are resources. A set of encyclopedias is not<br/>
inherently more educational than the cat or a pair of tennis shoes. And<br/>
definitely not more educational than the cat AND the tennis shoes<br/>
together!<br/>
(feeble cat humor, my cat would be rolling his eyes if he could read<br/>
this).<br/>
 <br/>
Tennis shoes can be entertaining and educational. I remember when Isey<br/>
played with his shoes for hours on end, also his clothes. He wanted to<br/>
learn to do it, so he just sat and did it. Ne&#39;er a frustrated bone in<br/>
his body. Pure bliss.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, it&#39;s a lot easier to not have a TV or sugar in the house. Works for<br/>

<br/>
Well.  We have a tv -- which is used generally for three things.  PlayStation <br/>
2 games.  DVDs.  Discover channel shows -- sometimes TLC and Animal Planet.  <br/>
They could watch other shows...they used to watch a lot of Disney cartoons -- <br/>
that phase seems to be over. <br/>
<br/>
We have a bowl of Dove Dark Chocolate squares available at all times, for <br/>
anyone.  I consider it essential to sane living, personally.  Christmas candy <br/>
is still sitting on the family room table -- I&#39;ll probably toss it today.  <br/>
There&#39;s ice cream in the freezer, should anyone be so inclined.  It&#39;s not a <br/>
big deal.  The kids have learned they feel better if they balance sugar <br/>
intake with protein, so they generally do.  I nudged them into being aware of <br/>
their reactions so they could assess them.  And they don&#39;t get cavities.  But <br/>
I don&#39;t think that unlimited sugar necessarily prevents cavities.  I think <br/>
they have good teeth/bacteria resisting genes.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t limit tv, or computer, or modeling clay, or reading, or Dungeons and <br/>
Dragons, or hot dogs per se -- I DO nudge my kids if I see they&#39;re starting <br/>
to get bleary or short with themselves and each other, in that moment, so <br/>
they can recognize symptoms and start to handle it on their own.  Nick can <br/>
spend all day on the computer -- he can also spend a day broken up into lots <br/>
of different activities.<br/>
<br/>
I also nudge them in terms of specific ideas.  We talk a lot.  I lead here <br/>
and there.  They lead here and there.  They take flute and piano lessons.  <br/>
The deal is that if I pay for lessons, they practice and work with their <br/>
teachers.  They play spontaneously during the day most days -- but some days <br/>
life gets busy and I nudge them about practicing as per our deal.  They&#39;re <br/>
free to discontinue lessons at any time.  They are happy with their ability <br/>
and progress -- excited about playing duets together.<br/>
<br/>
I nudge.  I go on instinct with what my kids need from me.  There was a time, <br/>
in our deschooling period (Nick went to private school through grade 2) -- <br/>
when I didn&#39;t say word one to him about what he &quot;should&quot; do.  And he spent a <br/>
long time in front of the TV.  It was a year and a half before he picked up a <br/>
pencil to write or draw.  At the moment, Nick appreciates nudging with <br/>
geometry -- he&#39;s using the Key-to series and is feeling good about his <br/>
progress.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found is that while many theories on living and raising kids have <br/>
interesting elements, and unschooling in particular changed important and <br/>
basic things for us, I know my kids better than the purveyors of any theory.  <br/>
I learned to trust myself as a parent.  I look at how they&#39;re doing -- are <br/>
they happy?  Are they able to function at home and in the outside world?  Are <br/>
they healthy?  Are they learning about themselves and their world?  I make <br/>
adjustments as they go through phases -- I watch, I listen, I learn.  We talk <br/>
about what we do and why we make the choices we do, mistakes we make, what <br/>
seems to be working for us as individuals and as a family -- and what <br/>
doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t assert there is one way which will work for all children.  I share my <br/>
experience with my kids -- what has worked for us and is working for us.  <br/>
Data points for consideration, not outlines for living.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118972638">Whenever this topic comes up on unschooling boards, I feel sad and lonely.<br/>
I always thought that TV was the major tool of institutional mind control<br/>
(no, really! :-) ) and that people who unschool are more likely to wean<br/>
themselves from it. Doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Does anyone here NOT have<br/>
a TV?<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe more important, I find TV ugly. Most of the stuff shown is<br/>
esthetically offensive. Does anyone else think that? Sandra recently said<br/>
something to the effect that she&#39;s allergic to bullshit. Well, I&#39;m<br/>
allergic to ugliness, and I try not to keep ugly things around.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has a sense of taste that they use to select books to read,<br/>
music to listen to, videos to watch, computer games to play, food to eat<br/>
-- and thereby, shape their children&#39;s environment and control (horrors!<br/>
:-) ) their choices. To some extent. Of course, children will choose<br/>
things on their own too. But if you talk about your tastes and values to<br/>
your children and around them, they are likely to accept them as their<br/>
own; at least, those of them that you&#39;re most passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s harder to be passionate about not watching too much TV (what&#39;s<br/>
too much, anyway?) than not watching any at all, in my opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55171692"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From what I reading, (I&#39;m so new to the unschooling<br/>
&gt; concept) is that you<br/>
&gt; think your child should choose what he does, at<br/>
&gt; every point? Is that<br/>
&gt; right? <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sort of.  I don&#39;t let my children do dangerous things,<br/>
like run into a busy street.  Sometimes they have to<br/>
do things they do not want to, like run an errand, but<br/>
their opinion is considered.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Brushing his teeth. He has to do<br/>
&gt; it. But won&#39;t unless I<br/>
&gt; remind him to. He&#39;d leave his toys out all over,<br/>
&gt; unless I remind him to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids see me brush my teeth every day.  I will tell<br/>
them if they have bad breath or if their teeth look<br/>
grimy.  They choose to brush them.  Some days they<br/>
don&#39;t want to, and that is okay, but I will make<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
As for the toys, if my boys don&#39;t pick them up, I do. <br/>
They don&#39;t like how I do it, so they are pretty good<br/>
at picking them up.  I don&#39;t mind some toys laying<br/>
around.  They don&#39;t have to clean their rooms, that is<br/>
their space.  Of course, stepping on a lego or<br/>
hotwheel usually motivates them!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; Is part of the unschooling philosophy to not tell<br/>
&gt; them to do anything? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, it is to let them decide when you can.  I will<br/>
tell them what to do when it involves their safety.  I<br/>
make suggestions about hygiene, although I rarely feel<br/>
the need to.  If they are hurting each other or<br/>
fighting, I will separate them and encourage them to<br/>
talk about what caused it.  Most things can be handled<br/>
with asking or suggesting if parents feel they need to<br/>
intervene.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really curious about this. And if it is part of<br/>
&gt; the philosophy not<br/>
&gt; to tell Little Ones to brush their teeth, how do you<br/>
&gt; deal with that<br/>
&gt; Dragon Breath? :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Breath mints?  That toothpaste gum?  Most people, kids<br/>
included, would probably get sick of their mouth<br/>
feeling dirty and eventually brush...... I would hope.<br/>

child&#39;s environment only works for so long, however. What happens at<br/>
parties and outside events? In my experience the mother or father then<br/>
becomes the big controller allocating candy like allowance funds. The<br/>
child doesn&#39;t develop the self regulation skills they need to feel good<br/>
about making their own choices. I think some of these things are<br/>
developmental issues - more control while young and isolated and less<br/>
when autonomy kicks in, but no parent is able to totally isolate their<br/>
children from the surrounding influences. My daily prayer isn&#39;t to god,<br/>
it is to myself to let go and quit thinking I run things that I really<br/>
do not. Sort of my mantra. ;)<br/>

<br/>
I can take or leave tv, and rarely turn it on. It bothers me, purely as a<br/>
noise thing. I don&#39;t like noise very much. Cacie *loves* tv. She also<br/>
loves Smash Mouth, and will listen to both at the same time. If I&#39;m in<br/>
the room, that makes me totally crazy (and she will turn one off if I ask<br/>
her to, she&#39;s nice like that).<br/>
<br/>
I eat tofu from the box and have avocado sandwiches for lunch most days.<br/>
Cacie doesn&#39;t like either one. She loves on vegetarian gyoza, which I<br/>
don&#39;t like very much.<br/>
<br/>
I read pretty much nothing but non-fiction, just can&#39;t get into fiction<br/>
much. Cacie almost exclusively reads fiction. <br/>
<br/>
I could go on... we do agree on some stuff, of course, but we have very<br/>
different tastes. She tends to agree with me when what I say makes sense,<br/>
and for me to be passionately anti-tv seems illogical to both of us.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;institutional mind control&quot;, I guess I give my kid more credit<br/>
than that. Of course there&#39;s a bias, and of course they&#39;re trying to sell<br/>
you stuff, and she knows that. Sometimes I worry that she&#39;s too cynical,<br/>
since she doesn&#39;t seem to believe anything any commercial says... tv is<br/>
fairly interactive around here. I listen to her sometimes as she watches<br/>
the tv, and it&#39;s, &quot;Oh, the *boy* saves them! How *sexist*!&quot; &quot;Oh, right,<br/>
like I want to buy some dumb makeup kit just because it has Barbie on<br/>
it!&quot; and on and on. <br/>
<br/>
She critiques books, too, in much the same way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Enriched to me means a house full of love.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good point.<br/>
<br/>
Enriched to me means that, but I define it as freedom and positive regard.  <br/>
Some houses have stuff, but the kids are subtly (or overtly) shamed and <br/>
teased for using it.<br/>
<br/>
I think encyclopedias are as good as a cat.  &quot;A cat can look at an <br/>
encyclopedia.&quot;  I would be more worried about a family that had no internet <br/>
access AND no encyclopedia than a family that didn&#39;t have a cat.   Shoes are <br/>
okay, but thrift stores are full of them (and rarely have cats or <br/>
encyclopedias).<br/>
<br/>
I believe it would be very difficult for a person who loves a stripped-down <br/>
house without *stuff* to unschool.   Some families with kids in school just <br/>
have houses for sleeping between work days and school days.  They assume that <br/>
at school kids can do art, make noise, play with clay, look at a globe, read <br/>
books, have paper and pencils  And that at home those things are just clutter <br/>
and nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
So I think unschoolers should get to their houses anything the parents used <br/>
to think the kids would be able to learn about at school.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>
that would be, depends on what the parents think!  <br/>
<br/>
Holly has been asking me about terrariums (terrariae sounds like something an <br/>
elephant would say) and I&#39;ve lamely been saying people used to make them out <br/>
of jars and big plastic bottles and not DOING it (because I don&#39;t have a <br/>
green thumb and I don&#39;t want to make the Jar of Doom for her).    But if she <br/>
was in school, I could tell myself (and tell myself to believe me on faith) <br/>
that at school she&#39;d get to see one.  And maybe a turtle and a hamster.    <br/>
But not at OUR house.<br/>
<br/>
So I think unschooling houses can be used being enriched with acceptance,  <br/>
curiosity, joy in discovery, toys, tools, materials, demo objects (those five <br/>
little balls hanging on a frame to show transference of energy and the <br/>
pendulum; our most recent set was played with until it was down to two, and <br/>
we need another one becaue they&#39;re just to fun), magnets, music, cookbooks... <br/>
<br/>
I think of &quot;enriched&quot; as the opposite of &quot;sparse.&quot;   (Some people see <br/>
&quot;oppulent&quot; as the opposite of &quot;sparse&quot; maybe or &quot;cluttered&quot; but that&#39;s their <br/>
own mindset.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842468746">Pam Hartley said everything so amusingly and well that it hardly seems<br/>
like I should be yammering, but I will.<br/>
My son is nine now and we never limited the amount of TV he could watch,<br/>
video games or computer games or  the content, never restricted sugar, or<br/>
how much.  He discovered Godzilla movies when he was four, and shortly<br/>
after that all other monster movies, and then the Three Stooges, nyuk,<br/>
nyuk, nyuk. (This I could do without ) <br/>
There were days he watched TV, or played play station all day, and still<br/>
are, but he also does everything else.  There are days he eats cake for<br/>
breakfast and more days when he doesn&#39;t.  He knows what he wants, same as<br/>
I do.<br/>
Your son will find his own balance.  Wild energy after sitting all day is<br/>
balance, just like activity after sleeping at night  and a walk after a<br/>
big dinner.   Your son is showing you he knows about balance.  TV doesn&#39;t<br/>
make him a wild man, it is nature says ok, you sat, now you run. <br/>
I would urge you to LET HIM BE.  You don&#39;t know what the future has in<br/>
store for him.  What if he&#39;s going to be another George Lucas, would TV<br/>
seem like a waste of time then?  If you knew he was going to be a pilot,<br/>
would you ever think he could read too many books about flying?  Play<br/>
with too many toy airplanes?<br/>
My son at nine is just one example of a child let alone to make his own<br/>
choices.  He&#39;s not a couch potato.  He&#39;s never had a cavity. He&#39;s not<br/>
overweight.  He has an active life of play and sports and quiet times and<br/>
TV time and he&#39;s OK. <br/>
Kids who have loving families and lots of choices will never ALWAYS<br/>
choose TV.<br/>
They might choose TV for ten days in a row or twenty, but never ALWAYS. <br/>
And you wouldn&#39;t be worried if he chose to go outside and play in the<br/>
sand box everyday for ten days running.  There is value in everything. <br/>
You might not see it yet but it&#39;s there and your child has found it. <br/>
It&#39;s filling some need of his right now and when he&#39;s finished he&#39;ll move<br/>
on to the next thing.   I just hope for your sake it&#39;s not tarantulas or<br/>
taxidermy.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I<br/>
make suggestions about hygiene, although I rarely feel<br/>
the need to.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I say to Marty this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You need to take a shower before you go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;You have to take a shower because I said so,&quot; it is &quot;I perceive <br/>
that you have the need to have a shower.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so he doesn&#39;t argue.  I&#39;ve done him a favor.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby takes a shower every morning when he wakes up.  If he&#39;s not going <br/>
anywhere until late afternoon, he might wait until after he eats.  Pretty <br/>
much, though, he stands and showers.<br/>
<br/>
In the fall of 2000 he got a job, working at 8:30 Saturday mornings.  I used <br/>
to suggest he take a shower before he went to bed, but he has long hair about <br/>
which he&#39;s vain, and didn&#39;t want it lumpy.  So he would get up and take a <br/>
shower, which had the added effect of waking him up.<br/>
<br/>
Before that, he had stayed with my sister a week (he was 12) and she <br/>
complained that he didn&#39;t bathe enough.  So all we had was that some-months <br/>
once-a-week early shower.  And without any parental rulings or advice, that <br/>
turned into a daily shower for a kid who only works twice or three times a <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
He saw it as the good thing it is, not as a parental rule to try to run <br/>
around the end of.<br/>
