<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140474985">Dylan and I went on a small mammal ecology field trip Saturday.  It was a<br/>
program offered through the university in a town about forty miles from<br/>
us.  We&#39;re on their mailing list for special classes and programs. <br/>
 <br/>
This field trip was to show what biologists in the field do when they are<br/>
studying a particular critter.  Dylan has actually done field work before<br/>
for the geology department at this same university, monitoring seismic<br/>
sites and writing down what he observed, and once, for a month,<br/>
monitoring cut worm populations.<br/>
<br/>
The biologist on this trip is studying huanta(sp) virus in deer mice<br/>
populations in western Montana.    The night before the trip she had set<br/>
out live traps in two locations in a high mountain meadow.  One of the<br/>
sites was the cabin of a friend of hers,  as she was hoping to show how<br/>
common deer mice are in our living spaces.  ( seven mice out of eight<br/>
traps ) <br/>
 <br/>
We had to be there at the crack of early because these little critters<br/>
may have been stuck in the traps all night and she didn&#39;t want to inflict<br/>
more stress than necessary on them.   At the first place we stopped her<br/>
first trap had a pack rat in it, so now we&#39;re in love with pack rats<br/>
around here and there are at least six drawings of the little guy stuck<br/>
to the kitchen walls.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole trip was amazing, but the most amazing thing was how different<br/>
the kids on the trip were.  There were three other kids there, older than<br/>
Dylan, who looked like they&#39;d rather be anywhere else.  Dylan asked<br/>
questions, wanted to know how she took blood samples, weighed the mice,<br/>
asked about huanta virus, asked about West Nile virus in small mammals,<br/>
asked about protected species,  how long do deer mice live, how do you<br/>
tell the sex, and on and on.   I didn&#39;t ask the other kids but wondered<br/>
if they had any say about being there that day.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the trip the biologist gave Dylan the deer mice ear tags<br/>
she had and said he could pierce his ears with them if he wanted.   <br/>
<br/>
She finally asked what school he went to and was science his favorite<br/>
subject and when he told her he&#39;d never been to school she said &quot; Well,<br/>
that explains it! &quot;<br/>
She said last year one of her students at the university was a fourteen<br/>
year old girl who&#39;s &quot;hippy&quot; parents had never sent her to school, just<br/>
let her play, and that she was the smartest kid she&#39;d ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan has asked for a good, basic book on biology.  He&#39;s been on the<br/>
Internet and discovered that the first ever southern bog lemming was<br/>
discovered in Montana, greatly expanding their previously known range. <br/>
There are drawings of bog lemmings here too, one&#39;s wearing a hat, like a<br/>
big, floppy sun hat (is that the southern belle bog lemming, I wonder?)  <br/>
My mom cut an article out of the paper about black footed ferrets and now<br/>
he&#39;s asking questions about plague.  <br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is, on the weekend we&#39;re going picnicking and to a<br/>
concert, and then he&#39;ll be digging his dad&#39;s guitar out and strumming and<br/>
life will be bringing him something new. <br/>
