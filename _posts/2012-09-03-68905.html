<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754702407">Several months ago, a link was posted to a sheet that was a sort of<br/>
recordkeeping system for unschooling families, if they wanted one.<br/>
The headings were things like &quot;Listening,&quot; &quot;Doing,&quot; &quot;Watching,&quot; etc.  Then<br/>
you could keep a record of what your child did each week that<br/>
fit under each heading.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone repost that link or form?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I created the &quot;Unschooler&#39;s Recordkeeping Form&quot; about 10 years ago and have<br/>
published it in a number of places. But I&#39;ll just give you the headings,<br/>
here, and you have my permission to make one for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Recordkeeping for Unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
Use these headings as ticklers to remind yourself of what you might want to<br/>
record. Format it leaving space for notes. I usually do it in two columns.<br/>
