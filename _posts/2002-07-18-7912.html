you in my thoughts. I can only imagine how stressful this time must be for <br/>
you. I&#39;ll be sending positive healing energy your way, as I&#39;m sure just <br/>
about everyone on this list will be. Hang in there and be good to yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Athena, brain tumors are a pretty good reason to be shaken up.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize that it&#39;s likely that you&#39;re dealing with a totally different <br/>
type, etc., but my partner many years ago had a brain tumor she was not <br/>
supposed to survive six months. Obviously, she&#39;s around. If it would help, I <br/>
think she&#39;d be happy to e-mail with you. Just let me know, and if there&#39;s <br/>
anything else we can help with, please tell us.<br/>
