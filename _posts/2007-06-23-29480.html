<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648918965">Someone who used to be on this list is posting elsewhere that I had  <br/>
edited threads.  I edited nothing.  For the record, posts that are on  <br/>
the list aren&#39;t edited.<br/>
<br/>
I brought this because I just hate bullshit.  I have comments at the  <br/>
end.<br/>
<br/>
First part is me responding to silly public claims out in public:<br/>
<br/>
-=-.there is no way any other person beside Sandra or I can know the  <br/>
extent our conversation because that thread has been edited and  <br/>
moderated and private exchanges ignored.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I edited nothing. I ignored nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Guests who go into other people&#39;s homes (or lists or blogs) and start  <br/>
insulting other guests will probably be asked to leave. Hostesses  <br/>
have responsibilities to trusted guests who were already there.  <br/>
Homeowners (and listowners, and blogowners) have more rights than  <br/>
drive-by commenters have.<br/>
<br/>
The implication that comments were edited by the listowner is untrue.  <br/>
All e-mails were saved. It would be possible for ANYone to know what  <br/>
passed, but I have better things to do than defend myself against  <br/>
lies. Kirby will be 21 next month. He was unschooled throughout.  <br/>
Other people&#39;s belief, disbelief, approval or disapproval can&#39;t  <br/>
change his life, or Marty&#39;s, or Holly&#39;s. Sharing the details of their  <br/>
lives has helped other families&#39; lives. I won&#39;t stop doing that just  <br/>
because a few people who don&#39;t want to unschool wish I would stop.<br/>
<br/>
Melissa, you are kind and generous. I&#39;m sorry someone brought strife  <br/>
and meanness to your blog.<br/>

Not meant in a spirit of meanness or strife *at all* and this will be  <br/>
my last comment on this subject on someone else&#39;s site. Anyone  <br/>
wishing to discuss this with may contact me at tia AT sixredheads.com:<br/>
<br/>
* I was never asked to leave Always Learning by the list owner. I  <br/>
never meant to insult anyone there and apologized repeatedly to no  <br/>
response. I think it was assumed I would be one more hurt and  <br/>
offended woman on her list that would fade quietly into the background.<br/>
<br/>
* My posts were certainly edited and I was scolded. Moreover, after  <br/>
things were clearly going downhill in that discussion on the list (I  <br/>
was feeling misunderstood and saddened others felt hurt by my words),  <br/>
I shifted to private communication in an effort to clear things up.  <br/>
This was very unsuccessful. But there are several emails in that  <br/>
strain of the conversation that are invisible to anyone reading on  <br/>
the list.<br/>
<br/>
I am primarily disturbed by Sandra&#39;s attitude that &quot;it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
matter&quot;. She has offended several people who have tried different  <br/>
levels of clearing communication for the benefit of good dialog. But  <br/>
this underscores my repeated experience with her that some people  <br/>
just don&#39;t matter. It is an attitude that is completely discordant  <br/>
with mindfulness and the human respect unschooling is supposed to be  <br/>
in support of. If her credibility and consistency does not matter to  <br/>
her, what good is anything she has to say?<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I&#39;m moving on from this discussion on this website. I can  <br/>
be reached at the email address above. My sincere apologies to  <br/>
Melissa for the direction this discussion has gone into.<br/>

-=- and apologized repeatedly to no response.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In e-mail complaining about the list, there were repeated but  <br/>
insincere seeming apologies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true that I do assume that then I ask people to chill or to stop  <br/>
being harsh or harrassing that they will stop, and that if they don&#39;t  <br/>
want to stop they will go away.  I put a &quot;no solicitors&quot; note on the  <br/>
door yesterday.  The Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses knocked anyway.   Then my  <br/>
phone rang and someone hung up.  If someone had come into the back  <br/>
yard I would&#39;ve been pissed.  If they&#39;d gotten a loudspeaker and  <br/>
started filling up the street with noise, that would be harrassment  <br/>
and I would&#39;ve called the police.<br/>
<br/>
If someone goes to another place to badmouth this list it seems like  <br/>
unhealthy obsession and harrassment to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If her credibility and consistency does not matter to her, what  <br/>
good is anything she has to say?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve been consistent for fifty three years.  My &quot;credibility&quot;  <br/>
with a person who won&#39;t even read before going off half-cocked isn&#39;t  <br/>
valuable credibility.   What I have to say is absolutely no good at  <br/>
all to someone who can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t want to understand it.  But that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I should change. I&#39;m not trying to be everything to  <br/>
everybody, nor everything to anyone.  I&#39;m trying to talk about  <br/>
unschooling with unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Six billion people on the planet, and one I don&#39;t even know is  <br/>
obsessing about me!?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think it was assumed I would be one more hurt and offended woman  <br/>
on her list that would fade quietly into the background.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fade quietly into the background&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hurt&quot; is too strong a word for someone who came in insulting  <br/>
unschoolers right off, whether it was on purpose or just clumsiness.<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who would rather harrass me to change than to quietly go  <br/>
elsewhere:<br/>
<br/>
Get away and do something productive and real.  Be with your family.   <br/>
Find a list you like better.  Build a pyramid of sugar cubes.  Watch  <br/>
all of the Monty Python videos.  Make a quilt.  Take your kids to  <br/>
Disneyland.  Go backpacking.  Read all the Harry Potter books.  Read  <br/>
all the Patrick O&#39;Brien novels, or Jane Austen.   Plant vegetables.   <br/>
Play Sudoku.  here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.websudoku.com/">http://www.websudoku.com/</a>   Look at prairie dog  <br/>
pictures and be glad your children are alive:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a> <br/>

Running around the internet obsessed about me and writing nonsense is  <br/>
no good for anyone.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, wait.<br/>
Six billion isn&#39;t a fair number.  Over a billion of them only speak  <br/>
Chinese, and another billion or two probably don&#39;t even have  <br/>
electricity.<br/>
<br/>
Someone give me a more realistic number, of people with internet who  <br/>
read and write English please.  And many of that billion in India DO  <br/>
read English and have internet, so don&#39;t forget India.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be unfair.<br/>

have internet access, it&#39;s still ridiculous that anyone would spend so<br/>
much time & energy on something like this -- does she not have<br/>
anything better to do? Is this the most pressing and exciting event in<br/>
her life right now? Good grief.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not.  But, it&#39;s probably a whole lot easier and <br/>
less challenging for her to spend time obsessing about Sandra than it <br/>
would be for her to confront her own demons, whatever they are.  Right?<br/>
<br/>
I *adore* Sandra&#39;s healthy attitude about stuff like this, though!<br/>
<br/>
When *I* grow up...  ;)<br/>
