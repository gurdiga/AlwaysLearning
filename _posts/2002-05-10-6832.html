&lt;&lt; She was very religious and very strict.  Some of the kids are still living <br/>
 (or were a few years ago).   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
oooh, that is so sad. I thought the movie was so delightful because of her <br/>
following her heart and the way she lightened up all the strictness with her <br/>
playfullness!!<br/>
Too bad the real Maria wasn&#39;t like that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Karen, for the link. I went to google also and read a brief timeline.<br/>
I thought it was interesting that the Captain was actually very musical with <br/>
the children before she ever came along...and there were NINE children. Wow!<br/>
It&#39;s a great musical. I prefer the fiction over reality in this story.<br/>
But now I have all these avenues to persue.....recorders, food, the war. <br/>
Connect the dots.<br/>
Unschooling.<br/>
Learning all the time.<br/>
Thank goodness for those gaps in learning that make it all possible!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Sandra, if you find the recipe book, or you remember the name (or if <br/>
anyone else has a name of a recipe book related to the Trapp family) could <br/>
you post it?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Somehow I love to link everything I learn to food. An obsession of mine, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
All that talk about Opera&#39;s earlier got me digging out my CD&#39;s and looking up <br/>
stuff online. I found a couple cool websites, one has recipes that you could <br/>
link with Rossini...if anyone&#39;s interested.<br/>
