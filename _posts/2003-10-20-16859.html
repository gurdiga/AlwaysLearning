bit, though it&#39;s not pertinent to me personally.  Actually I was<br/>
standing right there, not eavesdropping, but not participating either,<br/>

a bit in a common area...  I live in a neighborhood lousy with public<br/>
school teachers - many of my neighbors teach at the local elementary<br/>
school which I hear is supposed to be a great school.  Anyway, two<br/>
public school teachers - one lives right on top of me and the other next<br/>
door to us (she has a son who my boy plays with pretty regularly...)<br/>
Anyway, the gal (thus far childless, young, married) was saying to the<br/>
&quot;mom&quot; teacher &quot;...other people who are stuck in jobs they hate have to<br/>
hate them year round.  At least I can rest easy in the knowledge that<br/>
this is temporary and come summer these horrible kids will be gone and I<br/>
may get a better group next year after my summer off.&quot;  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
that I have any more to say than that.  I&#39;m not sure what to make of it.<br/>
Guess I&#39;m dumb-founded - and glad my son isn&#39;t in her class - this<br/>
summer before school she kept telling me she only had 18 kids in her<br/>
second grade class coming up and I should seriously put him in there...<br/>
Now she could be hating him as part of the group, too, eh?  ... Yes,<br/>
still dumb-founded... Or I&#39;d comment.  Um........<br/>

Hi, Alyce.  I feel her pain.  The teacher&#39;s I mean.  It&#39;s important to remember that everyone in a school system is confined and institutionalized, and we all suffer negative effects from it.  I say this as a former teacher.  No, I never hated the kids in my class, but I was absolutely torn up inside about the way the school environment was sucking the life, independence, and individuality right out of them.  <br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of people in schools can see this to some degree, without even knowing what they&#39;re seeing, and without knowing what to do about it.  Some of them blame the kids for what&#39;s happening (maybe the teacher in your example), some of them blame the school administration, some of them blame the parents, and some of them blame themselves.  That&#39;s what I did.  I blamed myself for the negative effects of their imprisonment, so I kept searching for the perfect teaching technique, the perfect approach that would make it all better.  When I realized what the real problem was--basically an across-the-board, institutionalized lack of respect for kids, I had to leave.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t think she hates all kids.  She&#39;s just caught up in a tremendously frustrating and damaging system, one that hurts kids and teachers alike.  And when she&#39;s with a fellow teacher, she&#39;s just releasing all her frustration.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t get the impression she hates all kids.  :)  It seemed <br/>
sad though that she felt this way - sad for her, sad for the kids.  <br/>
Once upon a time I wanted to be a teacher.  I realized before <br/>
heading that direction how tied my hands would be in so many ways as <br/>
pertained to operating in the classroom.  I figured why go to 4 <br/>
years of college, etc, just to be fired my first week?  :)  I don&#39;t <br/>
envy teachers one iota.  I wish there was an easy solution for all <br/>
of it.<br/>

I will second what Julie has said.  I don&#39;t think that most teachers <br/>
get into teaching intending to hurt children.  Most, like my sister, <br/>
teach because they really want to help children.  My sister says that <br/>
she has stayed in teaching, while I left long ago, because some kids <br/>
will never have the choice to homeschool and they are the ones who <br/>
need someone like her to advocate for them, to intervene when the <br/>
system rides them too hard, crushes their spirits mercilessly.  Each <br/>
teacher has his or her own coping mechanism.  But the one that works <br/>
best is the one I chose, and Julie chose (if I read your post right), <br/>
to walk away, to get out before the system eats us up and spits us <br/>
out, too.  No teachers retirement fund is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Now I wander in as a substitute teacher, quite tangentially, very <br/>
much on the fringe of that institutionalized reality.  I observe, and <br/>
I am often shocked by what I observe.  But I get to go home to my <br/>
self-determined learner, to the comfort of our own learning <br/>
environment.  The other teachers, often stuck there out of what they <br/>
perceive as economic necessity, do not choose to exercise that <br/>
option.  <br/>
