&lt;&lt; But I do notice that children who have never been able to order for <br/>
themselves are at a loss when we go out to eat.  I ask &quot;what do you want&quot; and <br/>
they look like a deer caught in the headlights.  The servers always ask us <br/>
what the boys want as well and the boys will pipe up and order for <br/>
themselves. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours used to work at Blackeyed Pea, and we&#39;d go in every week or <br/>
two to visit her.  We&#39;d sit at the bar.  Then after a few MONTHS, a different <br/>
manager came in and got ALL irate that Holly was sitting at the bar.  So we <br/>
moved.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s how Holly (who was seven or so) used to order:<br/>
(Loudly):  &quot;I want that stuff I choked on one time!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fried mozarella sticks.  That&#39;s what she wanted. <br/>
<br/>
A few weeks back I was out with Holly and Marty and when dessert time came, <br/>
the server asked me, and I turned and asked Holly if she wanted any dessert, <br/>
and she looked at me and then the server and said, &quot;No, thanks, we&#39;re done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she&#39;d ever seen that before, the waitress.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980830984">I had never given much thought to ordering.  Sometimes we each order for<br/>
ourselves.  Sometimes once person orders for everyone, because we all talked<br/>
about what we want (I&#39;ll have 4 chocolate milkshakes, please)....I had never<br/>
noticed that anyone gave me funny looks when my kids ordered....I&#39;ll have to<br/>
pay more attention....<br/>
