<div id="ygrps-yiv-932374376">I&#39;ve been laughing at this all morning so I figure it&#39;s either really<br/>
funny or I&#39;m really easily amised...<br/>
<br/>
Cacie and my dad and I saw a play about mathematicians last night (it&#39;s<br/>
called Proof, and it&#39;s really more about the interrelationships between a<br/>
family and all that, but 3 of the 4 characters were mathematicians... we<br/>
really enjoyed it).  One of the characters, Hal, was in a rock band made<br/>
up of mathematicians, and he was telling another character about one of<br/>
the songs they did. <br/>
<br/>
The line went something like this: &quot;It&#39;s called &quot;i&quot;. You know, a<br/>
lower-case i. We all stand there and do nothing for 3 minutes - it&#39;s an<br/>
imaginary number!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I saw it coming, but I had to explain it to Cacie during intermission...<br/>
then she liked it.<br/>
