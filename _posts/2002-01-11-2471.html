<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047564600">Hi all, Mary here in Davis, Ca. I&#39;ve been busy with illness and broken <br/>
computers and holiday etc. Glad to be back. My son is 5 today, hurray.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing to get a little feedback. My 7 year old treats us family members <br/>
like doo doo. She talks back, pretends to kick us, slams doors, yells, <br/>
resists help many times each day... She is great out and about, makes <br/>
friends easily. As for her home behavior, I&#39;ve had enough of letting her <br/>
express her feelings. She actually loves to joke too, the silly stuff, which <br/>
I find sooooo iritating when I&#39;m in need of a simple ok, lets do it, like <br/>
brush teeth. To me, she is stuck in a mode and needs some alternatives. I am <br/>
now finding myself threatning her with if you treat me and your brother <br/>
poorly, no afternoon friends, (just a fancy go to your room, I can&#39;t take <br/>
it). She would love to play with friends all day everyday. I find she treats <br/>
us worse the more she is away by herself.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a simple example of her mode. Both kids have new cool electronic <br/>
toys. Brother asks to play with her toy. NO she barks. I help pull him off <br/>
her, respecting her no. Later he asks again. No she barks. Same scene. It <br/>
happens again. Then she asks brother for a turn with his cool toy. Sure Ash. <br/>
After she takes her very long turn, Riley asks for a turn with her toy. No <br/>
she barks. I did insist she give him a turn this time.<br/>
I do&#39;t get it. Then later, she let&#39;s all the neighborhood kids take as many <br/>
and as long of turns as they want.<br/>
<br/>
Seems she has been festering this type of behavior since she was about 5. <br/>
Did I mention we have a 2 year old too. Hubby and I wonder if this isn&#39;t a <br/>
case of I want to be an only child. Or give me more attention. Seems that we <br/>
do spend a ton of our time in Ashley&#39;s world. I&#39;m looking for suggestions on <br/>
how to help her see what she is doing hurts our feeling. Also ways to guide <br/>
her towards better choices, yet I know she has to be the one to want to be <br/>
kind. Talk to you all soon,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it helps at all, I know quite a few kids who were like this until they<br/>
turned 8, and then they became much easier to be with...<br/>
<br/>
What kind of help are you trying to give her? My daughter resists help<br/>
pretty much all the time, unless it&#39;s something she&#39;s specifically asked<br/>
for help with, and even then she wants only the help she&#39;s asked for and<br/>
no more. If I don&#39;t respect her boundaries here, she does get cranky with<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your daughter maybe needs more social interaction than you<br/>
and your son, too - is she an extravert in a family of introverts? I know<br/>
a family like this, and when the daughter&#39;s needs for social interaction<br/>
aren&#39;t met, she can get pretty nasty to her family... and it took a while<br/>
for them to see it, because the mom and son cane quite happily stay home<br/>
and putter 5 days out of 6, but a day without friends is torture for the<br/>
sister. It&#39;s been hard for them to come to a balance, but the girl really<br/>
needs to recharge her batteries by being with people.<br/>
<br/>
Also, with the not sharing with her brother stuff - I wonder if some of<br/>
this is behavior she&#39;s picked up from other kids. I&#39;ve noticed that the<br/>
homeschooled kids we know, almost without exception, are generally<br/>
protective of siblings, but the schooled kids we know are generally at<br/>
odds with them. Not all the time, of course, but enough that I notice it.<br/>
I also wonder if this is a pattern that you&#39;ve all fallen into and your<br/>
son is equally aware of it and working it - it&#39;s easy sometimes to blame<br/>
the kid who looks &quot;mean&quot;, but perhaps your son also has found a role he&#39;s<br/>
comfortable with, and he knows that you&#39;ll eventually step in and make<br/>
his sister give him what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
Just some random thought,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing YES.<br/>
<br/>
She probably needs to be held and babied, and have time alone with mom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Seems that we <br/>
do spend a ton of our time in Ashley&#39;s world. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she needs to spend more time in your safe world, without competition.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;yet I know she has to be the one to want to be <br/>
kind.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Give her so much kindness she has extra to distribute.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s <br/>
any other way.    And you need to do it now, not think about it until summer. <br/>
 She&#39;s needy now, and the meanness could solidify into something painful for <br/>
all unless you break it up and let it pass now.  Think kidney stones, for an <br/>
analogy.  Change her diet and medicate it now (with love and attention) and <br/>
they might break down and pass on through.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t spend time with her talking about how you want her to act.  Spend time <br/>
with her acting like you want her to act.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493332330">Hi Mary - Happy birthday for your son! It seems to me a lot of kids and adults here have birthdays in Jan. & Feb.<br/>
Anyway, I have an 8 yos (soon to be 9 later this month) that acts up in irritating ways sometimes. As I think about it in retrospect, it is usually because he wants attention and I guess that is his way of getting it.<br/>
<br/>
What I have been trying lately (when I can remember) is that whenever he is acting particulary *bad* I tell him, &quot;I think you need a hug&quot;. He resists, because it is such an unnatural time for a hug when emotions are flying. But I pull him to me and hug him and he just melts into it and returns the hug back. Sometimes this is enough to diffuse any bad feelings on my part or his, and we can continue on with the day. Sometimes we talk about what might really be bothering him. Just showing and expressing that I love him even when he is at his worst does wonders. Something like this may work for you, too. Good luck.<br/>

What is it you say about smelling your kids hair?  I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
exact phrasing, or whatever, but I have done it at times when I thought I<br/>
was really mad at Matthew, and it works like magic for me - I think there&#39;s<br/>

When I was angry with little kids, I would hug them and take a full, deep <br/>
breath where I could smell their heads, and it calmed me down every single <br/>
time.  It still works with Holly, but I miss doing it with Kirby and Marty.<br/>
<br/>
Another primal thing is going on--they don&#39;t smell so good to me anymore.  <br/>
I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s part of the separation phase.  When there are several <br/>

shower, but my own STINK.  And Kirby takes a shower every day, so I&#39;m <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140364797">Hi Mary.  It sounds like she really needs some<br/>
attention, probably alone with you. My oldest son was<br/>
having some similar behaviors and they have improved<br/>
greatly since I have made sure that everyday he gets<br/>
time alone with me.  I spend about 20 mins every<br/>
evening doing yoga with each of my kids separately. <br/>
Then I read to them or play a game with them, still<br/>
separate.  It has given them each time to have mommy&#39;s<br/>
full attention for about an hour and their attitudes<br/>
have really become more positive.<br/>
Maybe you can find something both you and your<br/>
daughter enjoy doing, and schedule time to do those<br/>
things alone together.  Also, sometimes older siblings<br/>
do not want to share toys because the younger ones<br/>
have broken or damaged things in the past.  She may<br/>
have a very reasonable explanation for some of her<br/>
behavior and may see you stepping in as &#39;taking<br/>
sides&#39;.<br/>
Above all, show her she is loved, even if she is<br/>
feeling unlovable.  Affection can go a long way.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find something that works for you.<br/>

I&#39;m not saying that he never needs a shower, because he often times does.<br/>
But there&#39;s still something there for me, beyond the boystink that calms my<br/>
heart and makes me remember whatever it is that I&#39;m pissed about is only<br/>
transitory.  I imagine that my days of separation are coming :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323923054"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;She would love to play with friends all day everyday. I find she treats us <br/>
&gt;&gt;worse the more she is away by herself.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like she&#39;s an extrovert, like my daughter. My Casey *needs* to get <br/>
enough people time or she gets whiny and disagreeable. Like someone else <br/>
commented, it&#39;s how she recharges her battery. If she doesn&#39;t get enough <br/>
input, it&#39;s like being hungry, cranky or overstimulated for another kid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Here is a simple example of her mode. Both kids have new cool electronic <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She probably shouldn&#39;t bark no, but he shouldn&#39;t be getting physical with <br/>
her either. Maybe they&#39;re just playing off each other in the only way they <br/>
know how. Or do you mean pull him off her in the figurative sense?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Then later, she let&#39;s all the neighborhood kids take as many and as long <br/>
&gt;&gt;of turns as they want.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a weird way, I always take this as a good sign. It shows that she knows <br/>
her family will always love her, even if she acts as cranky as she feels. <br/>
It&#39;s safe. That&#39;s a good thing in its&#39; own way. With friends and neighbors, <br/>
she might not be so sure they won&#39;t turn on her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Seems she has been festering this type of behavior since she was about 5. <br/>
&gt;&gt;Did I mention we have a 2 year old too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember reading that when an only child is really young when the second <br/>
is born, they don&#39;t get a chance to express their true feelings about it. <br/>
They&#39;re too little to tell you how they feel. Then when number three comes <br/>
along they act out all the bad feelings they may have had as a toddler about <br/>
getting a new sibling and going from being an only to an older sister. Does <br/>
that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Hubby and I wonder if this isn&#39;t a case of I want to be an only child. Or <br/>
&gt;&gt;give me more attention.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could be. She might just need &quot;more&quot; of everything. I know my Casey does. I <br/>
try to love her up as much as I can and give her what I think she&#39;s needing. <br/>
Usually it&#39;s more attention or something new to stimulate her mind. Lots of <br/>
times it&#39;s NOT hugs or kisses or tickles. She has a big personal space, even <br/>
with me sometimes. She wants me to allow her in, but not to force my <br/>
affection on her. Respecting that need helps a lot too. People have a hard <br/>
time understanding that she doesn&#39;t want a hug when she falls down. But she <br/>
does want attention.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Seems that we do spend a ton of our time in Ashley&#39;s world.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s great to give her as much of yourself as you can without <br/>
ignoring everyone else&#39;s needs, including your own. It can be a balancing <br/>
act, but well worth it. I think 7 is a tough year. Casey didn&#39;t get &quot;mean&quot; <br/>
but she became almost phobic about her attachment to me. I think a lot of <br/>
development goes on at 7 and it comes out in different ways for different <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601427736">I&#39;ve been following this thread with increasing interest, trying to<br/>
figure out why all of this sounds so much like my 11 year old daughter,<br/>
an only child.  I think I finally got it.  I remarried a little over a<br/>
year ago and much of what is happening around here is very similar to<br/>
the 7 year old with new siblings except that in our case, it&#39;s the new<br/>
hubby/stepdad.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d subscribed to a step parents list but most of the people there are<br/>
what I would consider cruel, tough love, that kind of thing.  I&#39;m<br/>
becoming more convinced than ever that she&#39;s feeling left out and acting<br/>
out of hurt and rejection.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I need to make more of a point to spend more one on one time<br/>
with her, although mostly what she asks for is more time with him.<br/>
Recently, he&#39;s been making an increased effort to spend more time with<br/>
her.  I often feel like she&#39;s just trying to keep us apart.  Three is<br/>
such a difficult number to balance, we so often end up divided two and<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone has some helpful words to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541948633">Hello,<br/>
Thank you all for you kind and helpful words. I read through my original <br/>
post and felt, wow, I must have been grumpy myself. Anyhow, she is 100 <br/>
percent extrovert. She also is very physical, like smother love. We do all <br/>
cosleep. I like the idea of each kid having a day each week. I also know my <br/>
own emotional bankaccount is low. Sick kids (strep and chicken pox times 3), <br/>
sick hubby, aging Fil at resthome. I am really trying to remember when they <br/>
are the most unlovable they are in need of the most love. Sandra, I like <br/>
your analogy to treat it now like an illness. Gosh, I&#39;ll stay up all night <br/>
with sick fevery kids, now I need to find the combination of love and <br/>
attention to provide her. I do think she does hate her brother at some deep <br/>
level. As for her baby sis, she is much more kind to her. I&#39;m trying to see <br/>
her positive traits.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have siblings who really do dislike eachother, what do you do. I <br/>
know Riley feels deeply for Ashley, so the dislike is more one sided. He <br/>
gets crushed by her constantly. No, Riley that E is backwards. We try never <br/>
to correct the kids, yet this guy gets corrected 1000 times each day by her. <br/>
Riley on the other hand still thinks it is ok to hit, hurt, damage things <br/>
when he is mad. He gets mad alot. Double mad at sis for ever time she tells <br/>
him he is wrong. She doesn&#39;t seem able to stop telling him things which hurt <br/>
his feelings. Such a cycle. Any thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Mary in Davis, Ca.<br/>

<br/>
Marty and Kirby had a rough few years.  Marty used to say &quot;I hate Kirby,&quot; <br/>
when we were alone, and he meant it.   What I would say was that it was my <br/>
job to  make sure that each of them had as good a life as they could, and I <br/>
had to defend Kirby some too.  Marty understood that.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I used to do sometimes when it was just me and Marty was to <br/>
talk about what if Marty was an only child.  And we&#39;d talk about what would <br/>
be really cool, and also what he wouldn&#39;t like about it.  And I&#39;ve told him <br/>
that he was the only planned baby of the three, and that he was the very <br/>
sweetest baby of them all, and that when he was born he looked at me in a way <br/>
the others didn&#39;t, seeming very familiar with the world and very wise.  <br/>
<br/>
I reminded Kirby just yesterday that I&#39;m glad to have been part of his <br/>
childhood and sometimes I miss that little Kirby, and that I&#39;m proud of the <br/>
man he&#39;s becoming.<br/>
<br/>
These discussions are good for private, and not much like that can be said in <br/>
mixed groups of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s particular fantasy is that she could stay little.  We talk about that <br/>
sometimes, and I still pick her up and rock her sometimes.  Yesterday I did.  <br/>
She jumped up and I stood in the kitchen and rocked back and forth with her.  <br/>
She said &quot;I&#39;m so glad you can still pick me up.&quot;  I am too.  <br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was mean to Marty I would save Marty from the situation, and try <br/>
to get him out of the house for something real and useful, or find him <br/>
something to do that he hadn&#39;t done for a long time, or ever.  I&#39;d pull out <br/>
some old box of games that Keith and I had put up high when we had kids, or <br/>
photos of when Marty was little, or something comforting and distracting.<br/>
<br/>
And meanwhile I&#39;d go tell Kirby (he was 9, 10 at the worst parts of it) that <br/>
he shouldn&#39;t be cruel because it made Marty&#39;s life rough and it didn&#39;t make <br/>
him/Kirby a better person.  I&#39;d remind him to take a deep breath if he was <br/>
getting frustrated, and I&#39;d sit and let him tell me what it was that Marty <br/>
had done that made him so angry.  <br/>
<br/>
After a bit, I&#39;d go talk to Marty and say, &quot;You know, Marty, when Kirby is <br/>
playing with you nicely, you probably shouldn&#39;t do X...  and he&#39;ll play with <br/>
you longer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t do was to make rules about how every such incident should be <br/>
handled, because they were different, and the kids were older each time.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t punish either one of them.  Being brothers in those days was more <br/>
punishment than either deserved, and it was MY doing, not theirs, that they <br/>
were forced into the same house and family, and forced to share a mom.<br/>
<br/>
Too many parents treat their kids like uninvited guests who are being <br/>
uncooperative about the few or many simple rules which are being imposed on <br/>
them.  That seems ignorant and cold to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so true, Sandra, for so many siblings. Here in our house, one kid is <br/>
an extreme introvert and the other an extreme extrovert. While they seem to <br/>
like each other right now, there have been times when one or the other is <br/>
not so agreeable. As you said, they didn&#39;t choose each other. And they <br/>
usually do seem to appreciate each other for their differences.<br/>
<br/>
We were once talking aobut the idea that we choose the family we belong to. <br/>
Kind of like our soul choosing where we want/need to go. Anyway, right at <br/>
this moment Conor got upset with Casey over something and was grumping <br/>
mightily. In light of our conversation, I asked him &quot;well, why did you <br/>
choose this family if she&#39;s such a pain?&quot; He responded without missing a <br/>
beat, &quot;I thought I was going to be an only child!&quot; lol It was all said light <br/>
heartedly, but made me think.<br/>

Joyce and I met a guy the other day who believes he and his iguana have had <br/>

I think we&#39;re randomly where we are.  I just think about how many sperm are <br/>

discount it either. The fact that matter can be neither created or destroyed <br/>
gives me cause to think. I know our bodies replenish the earth after we die. <br/>
Why couldn&#39;t the energy of our spirit, what makes Us who we are, also move <br/>
on. I don&#39;t mean it in a touchy-feely religion bound way. More of a <br/>
something we haven&#39;t discovered yet scientifically way.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was never meant as blaming anyone. If my kids actually did choose me, <br/>
then I am the most blessed woman in the universe. And they know I feel that <br/>
way. If it was all a random act of a strong swimming sperm, I am no less <br/>
blessed.<br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make me feel better, but clinging to things which have little <br/>
basis in evidential fact makes me feel creepy.    I know tarot card readers <br/>
are sometimes in the business of telling people they spent previous lifetimes <br/>
with their current family members, or with someone they&#39;re about to meet.  <br/>
Why?  If each person is in the process of developing spiritually (which is <br/>
possible) there&#39;s not a good reason I&#39;ve ever heard, except sentimentality on <br/>
the part of those who hope it&#39;s true, that it should be with the same people <br/>
again.  Mathematically speaking, it doesn&#39;t seem likely, unless as also <br/>
sometimes seems the case, there are only a few thousand speaking parts in the <br/>
play and the other five billion and some are extras, or &quot;new souls.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve often felt that my husband and I have have &quot;danced this dance&quot; <br/>
before. <br/>
There&#39;s nothing I could prove, it&#39;s just a feeling that floats in and out my <br/>

before? It may be fun to giggle at him and believe him superstitious, but <br/>
that doesn&#39;t make him wrong.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Deja vu is most likely a memory-mirage.  It&#39;s fun when it happens, but it <br/>
isn&#39;t a pointer to time travel or anything.  A mirage on the highway doesn&#39;t <br/>
make it possible that there WAS a puddle there, and getting there and finding <br/>
the dip in the pavement dry (and the mirage magically the same distance <br/>
ahead, showing as yet ANOTHER puddle) doesn&#39;t seem cause to me to say &quot;It may <br/>
be fun to have believed it all a mirage, but that doesn&#39;t make those who saw <br/>
water wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe all mirages are really water.<br/>
Maybe all deja vu is premonition or memory of premonition, or proof that time <br/>
is swirly.<br/>
Maybe each feeling of comfortable knowing is proof of reincarnation.<br/>
<br/>
Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
So basing one&#39;s relations on mirages seems to me personally to be living not <br/>
in the present, living not even in the past or the future, but living in <br/>
speculation.  Letting wishfulness guide one&#39;s decisions.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s wishing and hoping in all things.  I hope a bomb or plane or meteor <br/>
doesn&#39;t fall on my house.  I don&#39;t live like it might be about to.  Where <br/>
would I hide?<br/>

clinging only to that which can be proven by evidential fact makes you feel <br/>
better? Better than creepy, anyway. And why does allowing for the <br/>
possibility that there may be things we don&#39;t yet understand have to <br/>
indicate one is &quot;clinging&quot; to those ideas?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Mathematically speaking, it doesn&#39;t seem likely,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not likely if our current understanding of mathematics is the complete <br/>
understanding.  But mathematically speaking, it doesn&#39;t seem likely that <br/>
we&#39;ve figured it all out yet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Deja vu is most likely a memory-mirage.  It&#39;s fun when it happens, but it <br/>
&gt;&gt;isn&#39;t a pointer to time travel or anything.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s &quot;most likely&quot; one thing, doesn&#39;t that leave open the *possibility* <br/>
that it could be another thing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;So basing one&#39;s relations on mirages seems to me personally to be living <br/>
&gt;&gt;not in the present, living not even in the past or the future, but living <br/>
&gt;&gt;in speculation.  Letting wishfulness guide one&#39;s decisions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where did this idea come from? I don&#39;t think I suggested it in anything I&#39;ve <br/>
written thus far. Personally, I find it possible to live mindfully and in <br/>
the present, and to also think about that which cannot be proven. I don&#39;t <br/>
see pondering the imponderables as letting wishfulness guide one&#39;s <br/>
decisions. But I&#39;m also not out to convince anyone else that I have anything <br/>
all figured out. My path is mine alone, whether or not someone has joined me <br/>
before or not.<br/>

<br/>
It came from my first statements, from prior discussions here and elsewhere, <br/>
from a lifetime of considering this&#39;n&#39;that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a good way to indicate except to keep saying it occasionally <br/>
that I&#39;m not responding to one single person&#39;s ideas or statements, but <br/>
talking about the ideas themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone living for heaven or a gypsy prophecy ten years away, or to grow up <br/>
and be real is missing the moment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Personally, I find it possible to live mindfully and in <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t either, but holding them out as equal possibilities, as it seems some <br/>
of the tales were doing, is something some people get attached to, fall into, <br/>
live in.  The souls choosing their own new lives thing is a slice of the <br/>
marginal, not a big liklihood.  Yet lots of people seem attached to the idea, <br/>
and seem to base their decisions on it.  Souls being bound to one another <br/>
from past lives being a basis for life&#39;s decisions.  <br/>

years because of new studies.  Clinging to anything,<br/>

&gt;   I find sooooo iritating when I&#39;m in need of a simple ok, lets do it, like<br/>
&gt;   brush teeth. To me, she is stuck in a mode and needs some alternatives. <br/>
&gt; I am<br/>
&gt;   now finding myself threatning her with if you treat me and your brother<br/>
&gt;   poorly, no afternoon friends, (just a fancy go to your room, I can&#39;t take<br/>
&gt;   it). She would love to play with friends all day everyday. I find she <br/>
&gt; treats<br/>
&gt;   us worse the more she is away by herself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Here is a simple example of her mode. Both kids have new cool electronic<br/>
&gt;   toys. Brother asks to play with her toy. NO she barks. I help pull him off<br/>
&gt;   her, respecting her no. Later he asks again. No she barks. Same scene. It<br/>
&gt;   happens again. Then she asks brother for a turn with his cool toy. Sure <br/>
&gt; Ash.<br/>
&gt;   After she takes her very long turn, Riley asks for a turn with her toy. No<br/>
&gt;   she barks. I did insist she give him a turn this time.<br/>
&gt;   I do&#39;t get it. Then later, she let&#39;s all the neighborhood kids take as <br/>
&gt; many<br/>
&gt;   and as long of turns as they want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Seems she has been festering this type of behavior since she was about 5.<br/>
&gt;   Did I mention we have a 2 year old too. Hubby and I wonder if this isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt;   case of I want to be an only child. Or give me more attention. Seems <br/>
&gt; that we<br/>
&gt;   do spend a ton of our time in Ashley&#39;s world. I&#39;m looking for <br/>
&gt; suggestions on<br/>
&gt;   how to help her see what she is doing hurts our feeling. Also ways to <br/>
&gt; guide<br/>
&gt;   her towards better choices, yet I know she has to be the one to want to be<br/>
&gt;   kind. Talk to you all soon,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401587699"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Another primal thing is going on--they don&#39;t smell<br/>
&gt; so good to me anymore.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s part of the separation phase. <br/>
&gt; When there are several <br/>
&gt; teenaged boys here, the others might smell earthy or<br/>
&gt; slightly in need of a <br/>
&gt; shower, but my own STINK.  And Kirby takes a shower<br/>
&gt; every day, so I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; thinking it&#39;s that he stinks to me more than to<br/>
&gt; other people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This holds true for papa&#39;s and stepdad&#39;s even more. DH<br/>
seemed to find the boy adolescents (my sons&#39;) VERY<br/>
offensive.  To me they smelled no stronger (and were<br/>
often less) noticeable than his own &quot;manly aroma&quot;.<br/>
Especially after engaging in hours of strenuous<br/>
activity during a muggy spell. He several times<br/>
complained about the smells emanating from their<br/>
rooms, when I could tell that it was only their<br/>
identifying scent, not lack of hygiene. <br/>
<br/>
Even this shall pass. <br/>
