<div id="ygrps-yiv-321969542">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have been watching this group for sometime now, close to six <br/>
months.  And I have five children.  I am a homeschooler - and I <br/>
understand that children learn best on their own and I guess I am <br/>
trying to figure out how to keep up with the &quot;records&quot; of <br/>
homeschooling legaleze when it comes to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you write down, what do record, how do you do it. <br/>
<br/>
And also, how do you deprogramme say, a thirteen year old who seems <br/>
to have absolutely NO self motivation?  How do you encourage a child <br/>
who seems to not want ANYTHING?  <br/>
<br/>
We are a family who has chosen to steer away from TV - since we have <br/>
moved to Maine eight months ago we have not owned a Tv, and I do not <br/>
forsee us getting one anytime soon.  It became too much of a focus in <br/>
life to be happy with at all.  We do watch movies, and have a radio <br/>
and computer.. but most boys at this age are into video games and the <br/>
like.  We, as parents, have decided that we don&#39;t want that to be a <br/>
major part of our lives...<br/>
<br/>
Do you have the children participate in daily chores of the <br/>
household?  Or do you let them choose when they want to help and when <br/>
they want to veg?  How do you do this.<br/>
<br/>
I have a thirteen yr old boy, who wants to be all grown up and not <br/>
have me make any choices for him. I have a nine yr old girl who would <br/>
do anything to help mommy, and a seven yr old boy who loves to learn <br/>
outside all by himself, a four year old who thinks she IS the boss of <br/>
the whole world, and a two yr old boy who is close behind...  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen many many benefits to letting my children learn as they <br/>
wish - but it is a great challenge with my thirteen year old, as he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go find something on his own.  he is so used to <br/>
direction and doesn&#39;t function well with &quot;what do YOU want to do?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I am confused as to how to unschool and keep records that will be <br/>
acceptable to the state... and how to help my kids really be who they <br/>
are meant to be - NOT according to me!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can help?</div>

Deschooling.  One month of nothingness/vacation for every year he was  <br/>
schooled (in school or at home).  Don&#39;t expect anything to happen if  <br/>
you try to short-cut the deschooling.  And assuming you&#39;ve been in  <br/>
school yourself for many of the years of your life, you probably need  <br/>
twice as much deschooling as your son does.<br/>
<br/>
-=- How do you encourage a child who seems to not want ANYTHING? -=-<br/>
<br/>
How long have you been unschooling?  Until he is comfortable and  <br/>
interested in things again, I would say  you accept your role in  <br/>
having discouraged a child from wanting things, and give him  <br/>
acceptance while he recovers.<br/>

&quot;Have them&quot; like require or make them?  I don&#39;t make my kids do  <br/>
things, and because this has been true for many years, they volunteer  <br/>
to help quite a bit, and if I ask for help they&#39;re almost always  <br/>
eager to help.  When they&#39;re not, I don&#39;t press them.  The only way  <br/>
they can choose to help is if they have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Or do you let them choose when they want to help and when they  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have a &quot;veg&quot; problem here at all.  If my kids are busy  <br/>
they&#39;re probably reading, or on the internet, or playing a video game  <br/>
in which they&#39;re deeply engaged.  They don&#39;t &quot;veg.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How it works is the same way deschooling works.  The parents have to  <br/>
be willing to never get help again.  You need to start seeing it as  <br/>
your choice, and really, honestly, truly not expecting any help, and  <br/>
then someday you might be surprised.  Every time you throw a rant and  <br/>
complain and try to assign chores,  you have to start all over again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700732426"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; And also, how do you deprogramme say, a thirteen year old who seems<br/>
&gt; to have absolutely NO self motivation? How do you encourage a child<br/>
&gt; who seems to not want ANYTHING?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t deprogram a person unless you&#39;ve totally programmed them to<br/>
begin with.  I&#39;m thinking of &quot;brainwashing&quot; type programming.  A kid who<br/>
seems to not want anything, and has been told what to do by his parents,<br/>
is a kid who has no idea what it&#39;s like to make decisions for himself. <br/>
A kid who has been making their own decisions for a long time and seems<br/>
to not want anything could be in a processing, or down time mode.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We are a family who has chosen to steer away from TV - since we have<br/>
&gt; moved to Maine eight months ago we have not owned a Tv, and I do not<br/>
&gt; forsee us getting one anytime soon. It became too much of a focus in<br/>
&gt; life to be happy with at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does every person in the house feel this way or just the parents?  That<br/>
can cause kids to feel really powerless in decision making if they are<br/>
thwarted in their attempts to like something that the parents deem<br/>
unfit, such as TV.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you from first hand experience, having grown up in a TV free<br/>
house, that my kids, with complete and free access to TV, seem much<br/>
happier about TV than I did when I was a kid and wished I could watch it<br/>
and couldn&#39;t.  My husband and I opted not to do that to our kids.  Our 7<br/>
yro watches a lot of TV and our 14 yro, watches very little, but used to<br/>
watch a lot when she was little.  Both our kids are happy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We do watch movies, and have a radio<br/>
&gt; and computer.. but most boys at this age are into video games and the<br/>
&gt; like. We, as parents, have decided that we don&#39;t want that to be a<br/>
&gt; major part of our lives...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What part don&#39;t you want to be major, radio, computer, or video games? <br/>
If life is full of ALL choices, those won&#39;t be the only things to choose<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you have the children participate in daily chores of the<br/>
&gt; household? Or do you let them choose when they want to help and when<br/>
&gt; they want to veg? How do you do this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since I&#39;m the parent, I do the daily housework.  They choose when they<br/>
want to help.  Neither of my kids have vegged out.  If they are spending<br/>
more time inactively, it&#39;s because they are tired or sick or need rest. <br/>
It&#39;s not an either/or where they choose to work or vegg.  They don&#39;t do<br/>
either of those things usually.  They are usually involved in their own<br/>
projects.<br/>
<br/>
When Chamille, now 14, was little, we did a quick pick up every night,<br/>
but it wasn&#39;t mandatory and we did it together.  I let that go with<br/>
Margaux, now 7, because she plays differently, in an ongoing fashion,<br/>
where things can&#39;t be easily put away.<br/>
<br/>
The other day Chamille did all the dishes while my husband and I were<br/>
out, it was a sweet surprise for us to come home to.  She routinely<br/>
cleans the bathroom that she uses without anyone asking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a thirteen yr old boy, who wants to be all grown up and not<br/>
&gt; have me make any choices for him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you are making the wrong choices for him.  Perhaps he needs real<br/>
choices that directly affect his life, like wether or not he wants to<br/>
watch TV or play video games, without having his parents place judgement<br/>
on those choices.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have seen many many benefits to letting my children learn as they<br/>
&gt; wish - but it is a great challenge with my thirteen year old, as he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go find something on his own. he is so used to<br/>
&gt; direction and doesn&#39;t function well with &quot;what do YOU want to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is directly because you&#39;ve told him what to feel, and think about<br/>
some very basic things in his life.  Is he free to say what he really<br/>
thinks and do what he really wants to do, without judgement?  Until he<br/>
is allowed this, he will feel powerless and act accordingly.  He needs<br/>
to be able to make real choices for himself, not arbitrary, &quot;what do you<br/>
want to do in your spare time?&quot; kind of choices.<br/>
<br/>
Traditional parenting tells people to limit and control what their kids<br/>
do, for their own good.  The problem is, that once they turn 13 or so,<br/>
they want some more control and less limits, and they&#39;ll get it<br/>
eventually because kids grow up and move out.  How do you want that<br/>
process to look?  Do you want a continuous struggle until he leaves, or<br/>
do you want to change the dynamics?  This is a natural part of life,<br/>
gaining more independence, more choices, and bigger thinking.  As a<br/>
parent, you can either embrace that and move with it, or try to block<br/>
it.  This can happen naturally and a lot of parents can&#39;t see that<br/>
because our world around us is telling parents to control and limit our<br/>
kids for their protection, own good, etc.  It doesn&#39;t have to be that<br/>
way!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It is sooo much nicer to help your kids grow into adulthood with mutual<br/>
respect.<br/>

unschoolers in every state.  I would suggest a state unschoolers list<br/>
where you live to ask how others do it in your area.</div>

 </span></blockquote>No chores. I do ask for help but the request is a real question and  <br/>
she can say no. I retain full responsibility for the house. If I ask  <br/>
for help, I&#39;m fully aware I&#39;m asking for someone to set their life  <br/>
aside to do something for me, as I would with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot here on chores:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s also helpful not to see kids activities through the lens of  <br/>
&quot;veg&quot;. They are choosing to do what *to them* is important. We can&#39;t  <br/>
see their needs and shouldn&#39;t judge how they&#39;re choosing to meet  <br/>
them. If we want to them to respect our needs that they don&#39;t agree  <br/>
with or understand, we need to spend *years* of modeling respecting  <br/>
their needs and choices, *especially* the ones that we don&#39;t  <br/>
understand, like a need for downtime when mom has just put in her  <br/>
fifth load of laundry. (Though we can step in and help them find safe  <br/>
and respectful ways to meet a need when they&#39;re stepping on toes.)<br/>
<br/>
And the benefit is that when we&#39;ve put in years of respecting their  <br/>
needs, when we&#39;re trying to get the laundry done and the beds made  <br/>
before company comes we can say &quot;Hey, I could use some help here,&quot;  <br/>
and the kids will say &quot;Sure!&quot; When we don&#39;t impose on their time  <br/>
because of some false sense of them owing us, when we&#39;ve been  <br/>
generous with our help meeting the needs *they* feel are important  <br/>
(eg, making healthy meals for them isn&#39;t their need but our desire to  <br/>
cook in a certain way), then they&#39;ll be generous with their time. We  <br/>
will *be* someone they want to help.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And also, how do you deprogramme say, a thirteen year old who seems  <br/>
&gt; to have absolutely NO self motivation? How do you encourage a child  <br/>
&gt; who seems to not want ANYTHING?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of what you&#39;re seeing may be you filtering him though what you  <br/>
expect he should be like. Some may be  just who he is. Some may be  <br/>
caused by schoolish methods.<br/>
<br/>
If he had a broken leg, how would you fix him? Would you hover over  <br/>
him looking for signs of walking? Would you put his meal out on the  <br/>
kitchen table on his first day in the cast to motivate him to walk?<br/>
<br/>
What you do is give the leg time to heal in an environment that&#39;s  <br/>
helpful to healing both the body and the spirit. You nurture him. You  <br/>
meet his immediate needs. You create an environment where it&#39;s easy  <br/>
for him to meet his needs and in time he&#39;ll walk.<br/>
<br/>
If he has &quot;NO self motivation&quot; is he in bed all day staring at the  <br/>
wall, not eating, not going to the bathroom? Or by &quot;NO self  <br/>
motivation&quot; do you mean he&#39;s not doing what you see as valuable?<br/>
<br/>
If you see him through the lens of &quot;NO self motivation&quot; you won&#39;t be  <br/>
able to see where he is motivated.<br/>
<br/>
Make a nurturing environment for him. What does he love? Don&#39;t just  <br/>
think in terms of academics or even interests. Does he glow if you  <br/>
bring him something to drink while he&#39;s reading? Start thinking about  <br/>
everything he loves without sorting it into categories of good and  <br/>
bad, academic and entertainment. *Everything* they&#39;re interested in  <br/>
is part of the way they learn.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see the contradiction between this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and how to help my kids really be who they are meant to be - NOT  <br/>
&gt; according to me!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We, as parents, have decided that we don&#39;t want that to be a major  <br/>
&gt; part of our lives..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand where you&#39;re coming from. You feel there are some places  <br/>
where parents need to draw the line to create harmony or safety  <br/>
because the kids weren&#39;t making the right choices on their own.<br/>
<br/>
And yet the kids of radical unschoolers are given freedom and aren&#39;t  <br/>
spending their lives on the couch in front of the big screen TV with  <br/>
a bowl of chips and a six pack of Coke. Why is that? Is it just  <br/>
because our kids are naturally good so we get the luxury of trusting  <br/>
them to make the choices we would make for them?<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s the other way around. We can trust them to make thoughtful  <br/>
choices because we&#39;ve trusted them to make thoughtful choices. People  <br/>
who begin with restrictions -- with kids they were sure had no  <br/>
ability to control themselves -- have found that by saying yes more  <br/>
that their kids do find balance in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Watching a lot of TV isn&#39;t the result of TVs presence in the  house.  <br/>
That&#39;s giving the TV too much power. Your kids are more powerful than  <br/>
the TV.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped my daughter during her Cartoon Network years is  <br/>
TiVo. When she knew she could watch her favorite programs anytime she  <br/>
wanted, she watched a lot less. That feeling of being controlled by  <br/>
the programmers of the stations to have to be in front of the TV when  <br/>
they said she could watch her show kept her there waiting. The TiVo  <br/>
gave her back the control. Also key is providing activities that are  <br/>
*better* than TV. If kids are choosing TV because it&#39;s the least  <br/>
boring thing to do, then why wouldn&#39;t they watch TV? It&#39;s just common  <br/>
sense. And &quot;better&quot; needs to be better by their standards. Games and  <br/>
toys that they&#39;ve played with aren&#39;t better. (If they were better the  <br/>
kids would be doing that instead.) It involves us being more  <br/>
proactive at bringing things into their lives and getting them  <br/>
outside the house to new things. (No one said unschooling was for  <br/>
lazy people! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
*And* it also means being sensitive to their needs. Sometimes they  <br/>
*will* want to watch TV. And during the &quot;middle school&quot; years they  <br/>
may very likely want to watch a lot more TV than they did when they  <br/>
were younger (or will as teens). It&#39;s a transition period between kid  <br/>
interests and more grown up interests.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have seen many many benefits to letting my children learn as they  <br/>
&gt; wish - but it is a great challenge with my thirteen year old, as he  <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go find something on his own. he is so used to  <br/>
&gt; direction and doesn&#39;t function well with &quot;what do YOU want to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may just be who he is. While my daughter at 17 does now have  <br/>
passions she can pick up, if I ask &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; at the  <br/>
beginning of the day she&#39;ll often have no idea. People who are even  <br/>
keeled can have problems picking from a wealth of choices when one  <br/>
doesn&#39;t jump out (which it often doesn&#39;t for even keeled people.)  <br/>
It&#39;s just who they are. (I&#39;m the same way.)<br/>
<br/>
While she has things she loves doing on her own, drawing, writing,  <br/>
guitar, other activities she likes to do because it&#39;s fun to do with  <br/>
someone else. And often it&#39;s more fun when someone else does the  <br/>
choosing. I do give her the opportunity to voice her preference but I  <br/>
accept that I&#39;m the one who will have to do most of the choosing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We are a family who has chosen to steer away from TV<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be clear. When you say &quot;we are a family who&quot; was this a decision  <br/>
mutually agreed on by all? Or do you mean you and your husband decided?<br/>
<br/>
Even in a family decision, unless someone is really savvy about how  <br/>
unequal power disrupts what looks like equality, family decisions  <br/>
aren&#39;t usually mutual. Children know they can&#39;t say &quot;Hey, I changed  <br/>
my mind. We&#39;re getting a TV today.&quot; They know they don&#39;t have that  <br/>
power. They know that any power they have is loaned to them by their  <br/>
parents and can be taken away at any time.<br/>
<br/>
This is when radical unschoolers get accused of promoting TV as  <br/>
though families can&#39;t unschool without TV. No, what gets argued  is  <br/>
that unschooling can&#39;t flourish when kids lives are narrowed by  <br/>
parents choices for them.<br/>
<br/>
If you had kids who loved Chinese food and you hated it, would it  <br/>
make sense to ban it? There are unschooling vegetarian parents who  <br/>
have allowed their kids the freedom to explore a world of food that  <br/>
includes meat and make their own choices.<br/>
<br/>
If you had problems that seemed to come from TV, then this is the  <br/>
place to ask for help in making it work. There are plenty of people  <br/>
here who had the same experience. They didn&#39;t just shut their eyes  <br/>
and ears to it and grit their teeth. They found ways to make it work.  <br/>
There&#39;s a wealth of wisdom here to tap into that doesn&#39;t involve  <br/>
parents banning something kids love.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; most boys at this age are into video games and the like<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think that is?<br/>
<br/>
Most pregnant moms are into large intakes of calories. Why do  you  <br/>
think that is?<br/>
<br/>
Those are meeting some need they have at those times in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
If it were a truism that &quot;most boys at this age are into books&quot;,  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t you be supplying books? Why wouldn&#39;t you supply video games?<br/>
<br/>
I know why you think so. I know the arguments against video games and  <br/>
the voices in your head that are saying video games (and resultant  <br/>
behavior) are bad. So I don&#39;t say this out of ignorance. I say it  <br/>
from my personal experience and the experience of hundreds of radical  <br/>
unschoolers (some of whom began with restrictions): the arguments are  <br/>
wrong. There are hundreds of radically unschooled kids who have been  <br/>
given the freedom to play games who are vibrant interesting teens who  <br/>
are not addicted to video games. My daughter, too, played a lot of  <br/>
video games and watched a lot of TV during the &quot;middle school&quot; years.  <br/>
It tapered off as her needs changed and today she barely has time for  <br/>
video games or TV.<br/>
<br/>
When you trust that kids are getting something you don&#39;t understand  <br/>
for a need you can&#39;t see, then you can see better why video games and  <br/>
TV aren&#39;t bad. If you join in and play and watch to get enough sense  <br/>
of why they enjoy something, that not only helps you get the knot  <br/>
from your stomach but helps forge a stronger relationship with them  <br/>
because you&#39;re showing you care enough to find out who they are and  <br/>
find out about what they enjoy. There may be issues around video  <br/>
games and TV: arguing, testiness but those are side issues that can  <br/>
be dealt with separately.<br/>
<br/>
If your son was painting beautiful pictures but it made him testy  <br/>
with the family, would you take away his paints?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a thirteen yr old boy, who wants to be all grown up and not  <br/>
&gt; have me make any choices for him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This doesn&#39;t get any easier. Soon he will be making his own choices  <br/>
and you won&#39;t be able to stop him.<br/>
<br/>
Control over kids is an illusion. We do have the opportunity to be an  <br/>
influence in their lives but we blow that by trying to maintain the  <br/>
illusion we can control them. Once they have the ability to walk out  <br/>
the door because they&#39;re fed up with being told what to do and what  <br/>
not to do, we&#39;ve lost even the illusion of control and have  <br/>
squandered our influence. It&#39;s not too soon to get:<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also live in Maine. It is as easy as finding an evaluator that supports<br/>
unschooling.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/mainehomeed">http://www.geocities.com/mainehomeed</a>  Here is a list of<br/>
evaluators you can call and talk to.  Ask each one what they expect from you<br/>
and go with the one that you are most comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And also, how do you deprogramme say, a thirteen year old who seems <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to have absolutely NO self motivation? How do you encourage a child <br/>
who seems to not want ANYTHING? &gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you used to tell him what to do and how to do it and<br/>
now you don&#39;t (and call it unschooling) and he is not choosing to do things<br/>
that you deem worthy,  so you see him as unmotivated.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a 13 year old who has never been schooled (at home or in school)<br/>
Each day she does whatever she wants to do.  She has her own internal<br/>
motivations and no matter what she chooses, I don&#39;t choose to see her as<br/>
unmotivated.  She plays a lot of runescape, rides and cares for her horse,<br/>
rides and cares for other people&#39;s horses, cares for her cats and rabbit,<br/>
walks the dog with me, watches TV (we are into crime shows these days,<br/>
Survivor, and Smallville). <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been busy lately making small cross stitched Christmas ornaments to<br/>
give away for Christmas.  We play games at times, talk a lot, volunteer<br/>
occasionally at the animal shelter, and hang out.  I pick up her friends as<br/>
often as they can come over and bring them back. (lately only a couple times<br/>
a week because they are busy with school) I get her to pony club and I run a<br/>
small 4-H that she loves.  She still gets into pretend play from time to<br/>
time.  She is as busy as she wants to be.  It looks nothing like what<br/>
schooled children do, but she&#39;s happy and learning all the time.  She is<br/>
pleasant to be around and she is very helpful and kind.  She is fun and<br/>
funny.  She&#39;s intelligent and thoughtful.  I&#39;m glad to count her as one of<br/>
my friends.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;We are a family who has chosen to steer away from TV&gt; and the <br/>
like. We, as parents, have decided that we don&#39;t want that to be a <br/>
major part of our lives...&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did the kids get to choose not to have a tv?  (if not, I would not call it a<br/>
family decision, personally.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Do you have the children participate in daily chores of the <br/>
household? Or do you let them choose when they want to help and when <br/>
they want to veg? How do you do this.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids do not have chores but they help around the house daily.  They help<br/>
care for all our animals.  They usually help pick up a specific area if I<br/>
ask. (maybe the kitchen table top) My standards aren&#39;t very high and I do<br/>
most of the cleaning myself.  They can always say no. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;I have a thirteen yr old boy, who wants to be all grown up and not <br/>
have me make any choices for him. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have always allowed my kids to make as many choices as they could safely<br/>
handle and they value my input and want to know my opinion on their choices,<br/>
esp. the big ones.  It&#39;s about the relationship we have.  They trust that I<br/>
want to help them get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I have seen many many benefits to letting my children learn as they <br/>
wish - but it is a great challenge with my thirteen year old, as he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go find something on his own. he is so used to <br/>
direction and doesn&#39;t function well with &quot;what do YOU want to do?&quot; &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What does a normal day look like for him?  Maybe he&#39;s doing more than you<br/>
give him credit for?<br/>

<br/>
Ooooh.  Good point.  And even then, some of the programming is always  <br/>
going to be there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s damage, and even if damage is &quot;undone,&quot; the memory and maybe  <br/>
some of the pain can remain.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Does every person in the house feel this way or just the parents?  <br/>
That can cause kids to feel really powerless in decision making if  <br/>
they are thwarted in their attempts to like something that the  <br/>
parents deem unfit, such as TV.-=-<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll BE powerless, and that&#39;s another great point.  If the parents  <br/>
show by actions that they don&#39;t care what the kids want, and then say  <br/>
in words &quot;What do you want?&quot; why would the kids feel comfortable and  <br/>
confident in responding?  When there&#39;s too much &quot;no,&quot; kids stop  <br/>
asking (and sometimes start sneaking).<br/>
<br/>
Exactly:<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is directly because you&#39;ve told him what to feel, and think  <br/>
about some very basic things in his life. Is he free to say what he  <br/>
really thinks and do what he really wants to do, without judgement?  <br/>
Until he is allowed this, he will feel powerless and act accordingly.  <br/>
He needs to be able to make real choices for himself, not arbitrary,  <br/>
&quot;what do you want to do in your spare time?&quot; kind of choices.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I tell my kids what to do sometimes, but for their benefit, not  <br/>
mind.  Yeah, yeah... that&#39;s what parents say who forbid TV or require  <br/>
homework and an hour of piano practice or whatever all.  But what I  <br/>
tell my kids to do is to be thoughtful, consider other people&#39;s  <br/>
feelings, and the effects a week or a year from now of what they&#39;re  <br/>
considering doing.  And then I walk away happy, because Holly at 17  <br/>
and Marty at 19 have been making good decisions for 17 and 19 years.   <br/>
There are adults, parents, who haven&#39;t made good decisions yet!<br/>
<br/>
When people ask whether unschoolers are ahead or behind, they&#39;re  <br/>
usually thinking of algebra or memorizing something that would turn  <br/>
worthless if they moved to another state or another country.  My kids  <br/>
are WAY ahead of most people their age in the ability to learn and to  <br/>
live in the world as a responsible person.<br/>

&gt; *will* want to watch TV. And during the &quot;middle school&quot; years they<br/>
&gt; may very likely want to watch a lot more TV than they did when they<br/>
&gt; were younger (or will as teens). It&#39;s a transition period between kid<br/>
&gt; interests and more grown up interests.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or, as is the case in our house, both my girls seem to have really liked<br/>
TV early on.  Chamille stopped being really interested in TV a few years<br/>
back, about age 11 or so.  She still loves movies and certain shows, but<br/>
her TV viewing became more specific, her focus narrowed to certain<br/>
things, she expanded with the internet and YouTube, and her focus<br/>
stopped being TV specific.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux is much more general about her TV viewing, like Chamille was at<br/>
that age, she watches anything that looks remotely interesting to her. <br/>
Something else that happens, is that my kids have ALWAYS watched TV<br/>
while doing other things, it&#39;s never a solitary event.  Only on very few<br/>
occasions have my kids sat down on the couch to watch something<br/>
purposeful without doing other things, and in those cases, it&#39;s usually<br/>
the whole family watching something together (Harry Potter movies<br/>
especially!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Children know they can&#39;t say &quot;Hey, I changed<br/>
&gt; my mind. We&#39;re getting a TV today.&quot; They know they don&#39;t have that<br/>
&gt; power. They know that any power they have is loaned to them by their<br/>
&gt; parents and can be taken away at any time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  You can&#39;t have REAL choices unless you have the power to<br/>
change your mind!  Chamille spent a few years really disliking rap<br/>
music, in general.  Her best friend is in total agreement with that. <br/>
Lately though, Chamille has started to expand her musical preferences to<br/>
MANY genres, including rap and R&B, while still not her favorite, she&#39;s<br/>
open about it and has actually really liked some of it.  Her friend<br/>
doesn&#39;t understand this at all, but she&#39;s also a kid who is highly<br/>
controlled and can&#39;t make any decisions for herself except reactionary<br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
I love this about unschooling and freedom of choices!  My teen is hugely<br/>
open to many things.  I really don&#39;t see her schooled peers doing this. <br/>
Last night we watched the history channel, a show about WW2,<br/>
specifically about Japan and technology and inner workings of the<br/>
Japanese army and civilians.  A few months ago, we watched Grave of the<br/>
Fireflies (really sad movie), which connected perfectly to what we<br/>
watched last night.  With the miriad of choices of things to watch on<br/>
TV, I don&#39;t know many teens that would choose to watch a history show<br/>
about the Japanese army (except unschooled kids and maybe a few<br/>
homeschooled kids).</div>

&gt; your choice, and really, honestly, truly not expecting any help, and<br/>
&gt; then someday you might be surprised.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can tell you first hand that the surprises come in leaps and bounds! <br/>
Actually, I&#39;m not surprised, I had a lot of faith and trust that one day<br/>
my daughter would help on her own without prompting, but still it&#39;s like<br/>
little gifts every time she does it because I never expect it!<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would always be the one to clean out the cat litter boxes<br/>
because Chamille has a strong gag reflex.  Now, about half the time I go<br/>
in there to clean them, they&#39;re already clean!  When I&#39;m doing dishes,<br/>
she will often bring me all the dishes scattered throughout the house,<br/>
simply because she sees a need and wants to help.<br/>
<br/>
The other day when she did ALL the dishes by hand while we were out, she<br/>
actually had a friend over.  Her friend was being boring and Chamille<br/>
actually found doing the dishes to be less boring then her friend!</div>

<br/>
Does it really do that much damage? Sometimes, for a few really strong  <br/>
kids, hardly any. Do you want to do any damage?<br/>
<br/>
I know homeschooling families and schooled-kid families with great  <br/>
kids. I&#39;m not one to say that unschooling is the only way to end up  <br/>
with happy and successful kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think two of my three kids would have coped and had little damage  <br/>
done by some level of gentle schooling. I think Rosie would have been  <br/>
seriously harmed. But, I will also say that I know my kids wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
who they are today if they&#39;d been schooled all those years. Knowing  <br/>
them and how they&#39;d cope and what kinds of insidious damage would have  <br/>
been done, I&#39;m really really glad we unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
There are clear risks of schooling. There are likely outcomes (math  <br/>
anxiety is extremely probable, losing interest in reading for pleasure  <br/>
is common, hating to write - typical result).<br/>

<br/>
As far as &quot;way ahead&quot;, it depends on how one defines that idea.  If you<br/>
are strictly speaking, way ahead in test scores or school level, that&#39;s<br/>
arbitrary and sometimes not lasting.  If you never measure a kid against<br/>
others, they will never be behind or ahead, they will be themselves and<br/>

do things isn&#39;t unschooling and it will cancel out any hope that the  <br/>
parent can claim to have unschooled throughout.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of the time you mean to say homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some schooled kids are whole and confident and calm and responsible.   <br/>
Some  unschoolers aren&#39;t.  But there are some things that can&#39;t be  <br/>
denied.  Letting and helping young children learn to make choices  <br/>
with  money in small amounts gives them years of practice and  <br/>
advisement.  They will handle money better than someone who never had  <br/>
any options until he had his first job or took a school loan and  <br/>
couldn&#39;t help himself from blowing some of it on spending money  <br/>
freely for the first time EVER.   Deciding what to eat for breakfast  <br/>
for the first time at the age of 18 could cause more problems for a  <br/>
college student in a dorm who has places to be and important  <br/>
(expensive) things to do than for a five or ten year old kid to make  <br/>
iffy choices, at home, on a day when there&#39;s nothing pressing.<br/>
<br/>
Practicing with low stakes and small amounts of money and pressure is  <br/>
just one of many examples of what can be seen to work better for  <br/>
typical or average unschooling teens than for kids who are teens in  <br/>
school for the tenth or twelfth year straight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047639956">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;they have been asking questions about the festival and, of course, they are expecting to see stereotypical images there.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What type of festival?  The traditions of the different groups/tribes can vary widely.  I don&#39;t really have any ideas for a quick introduction into Native Americans in general.  My family has been pretty surrounded by Native culture all of my life, both due to location and my dad&#39;s job.  We live in southern New Mexico, very close to the Mescalero Apache Nation, and my dad worked with the tribe quite a bit and had many friends on the reservation.  <br/>
We also have close friends whom we consider family who are Laguna Pueblo (mom is Laguna, dad is Spanish, actually).  Apache and Pueblo traditions are very different.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know as much about the traditions of the other Native peoples in the US as I do Apache and Pueblo.<br/>
<br/>
I would search online for the specific festival that you will be attending.  Since it is a festival, there will probably be more stereotypical images present than usual.  Many may be in full ceremonial clothing.  I have met people though, who came to the southwest truly expecting all indians they met to be wearing deerskin dresses and feathers.    <br/>
<br/>
Here is a website that gives a history of the Mescalero:<br/>

<br/>
And here is a website with some info about the Laguna and other Pueblos:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html&lt;http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html">http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html&lt;http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The library should have children&#39;s stories by Native American authors, and about their beliefs and traditional life.  We have tons of them, ones I see in this room are <br/>
Snail Girl Brings Water, a Navajo story, retold by Geri Keams<br/>
Little Man&#39;s Family (also Navajo), by J.B. Enochs<br/>
Circle of Wonder: A Native American Christmas Story, by N. Scott Momaday (Jemez Pueblo story, there is another version also that I haven&#39;t seen) <br/>
Sing Down the Rain, by Judy Moreillon (Papago)<br/>
Antelope Woman, an Apache Folktale, by Michael Lacapa<br/>
<br/>
The scene in the Addams Family Values where Wednesday and Pugsly are in the Thanksgiving play is great, that could be an opening to talk about Thanksgiving myths.  <br/>

<br/>
You may have an image of your child happily progressing through a  <br/>
piano book, gaining joy and dazzling skill. And when you hear her say  <br/>
&quot;getting along really well&quot;, you&#39;re unconsciously thinking she&#39;s  <br/>
given that gift to her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m betting by &quot;really well&quot; she means making it through the piano  <br/>
book. It says nothing about whether her daughter is enjoying her  <br/>
exploration of the piano and music.<br/>
<br/>
I think where parental thinking takes a wrong turn into confusion  <br/>
over these kinds of things is that child prodigies often take lessons  <br/>
early so it seems like the early lessons caused the early blooming.  <br/>
But not so. The early blooming comes from passion and drive that just  <br/>
happens to be in them that pulls them through the lessons. It&#39;s not  <br/>
lit by lessons.<br/>
<br/>
While there may be the occasional adult who appreciates having been  <br/>
made to practice as a child, I&#39;m betting the number who want nothing  <br/>
to do with an instrument they were made to practice is at least ten  <br/>
times as many. Think of it this way, if you wanted to prevent a child  <br/>
from playing the piano as an adult, wouldn&#39;t a good way be to start  <br/>
building up negative associations with the instrument as a child like  <br/>
forced lessons?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the way she describes it her dd is good at almost everything<br/>
&gt; she tries, yet she has this more formal set up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because we equate doing well in school with being smart and  <br/>
successful. But is it true?<br/>
<br/>
Is her daughter gaining a useful understanding of how the world  <br/>
operates or is she learning how to do tests? Schools want us to  <br/>
believe they&#39;re one and the same but they aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also is it not true that schooled or more formally homeschooled<br/>
&gt; children can be &quot;way ahead�.......etc&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Way ahead of what? If kids are being made to jump through hoops in  <br/>
school (and homeschool) aren&#39;t they going to be good at jumping  <br/>
through hoops? But what do the hoops mean and why do you want your  <br/>
kids to be good at jumping through them?<br/>
