<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944356996">My dad recently asked a question about radical unschooling (not in a <br/>
critical way) which I don&#39;t yet fully understand for myself.  His <br/>
question was, &quot;Are there ever any limits *imposed* by unschoolers?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My follow-up thoughts and personal ponderings are, &quot;Do limits have <br/>
value?&quot; and &quot;Is there value in *imposed* _fill in the blank_?&quot;  I <br/>
would really like to hear thoughts from those of you with more RU <br/>
experience (I&#39;m still very new).  <br/>
<br/>
Learning natural limits (gravity, physics, etc), lifestyle limits <br/>
(finances, health, etc), and other *non-imposed* limits happen as a <br/>
result of experiencing life.  When I think about &quot;What are imposed <br/>
limits?&quot; I think of the word &quot;withholding,&quot; which is not something of <br/>
value in my mind.  A specific example my dad used in explaining his <br/>
question was that of families who are wealthy -- in an environment of <br/>
abundant wealth are spending limits, budgets, or allowances (all <br/>
imposed) valid learning tools or are they &quot;arbitrarily imposed&quot; <br/>
limits?<br/>
<br/>
I know that &quot;hypotheticals&quot; are of limited value here, but the <br/>
questioning of *imposed limits* seems to me to be at the heart of <br/>
unschooling.  I would love to hear from those of you with many more <br/>
years of experience!<br/>

budget on him without his input and against his will or by someone  <br/>
happily explaining why she has set up the family budget as she has  <br/>
when it comes up in daily life, answering questions, working with him  <br/>
to adjust the budget to work in his needs? And perhaps asked if he&#39;d  <br/>
like to set up his own budget to see how it works (and be perfectly  <br/>
happy if the budget project didn&#39;t last long.)<br/>
<br/>
Would he learn percentages (writing, history, ...) better if someone  <br/>
made him do something he had no interest in, or if someone showed him  <br/>
cool stuff as it came up and answered questions he had?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that something can&#39;t be learned through imposing your own  <br/>
rules on someone. It&#39;s that:<br/>
<br/>
1) it chips away at the relationship. It says right off the bat: &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t trust you.&quot; As soon as someone&#39;s defenses go up, learning goes  <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
2) they often learn other things beside (or instead of) what you had  <br/>
in mind. For instance, they learn that it&#39;s great to have power and  <br/>
it sucks to not have power.<br/>

I don&#39;t make any arbitrary limits, if that&#39;s what he means.<br/>

would think that you&#39;d still have limits as to wether or not you should <br/>
get 2 jets instead of 1.  I could be that you&#39;d have to get a bigger <br/>
hanger for 2 jets and that it would mean not going to Paris for the <br/>
next few months, to have the money for you new hanger to house the 2nd <br/>
jet.<br/>
<br/>
Very few people could actually afford to go to the moon.<br/>

More money just means more choices, not less.</div>
