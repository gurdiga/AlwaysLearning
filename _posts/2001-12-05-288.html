<div id="ygrps-yiv-225166865">I&#39;ve been searching forever for this list. Found lots of other great <br/>
sites while I was at it. Finally had to email Sandra to get a link.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m Joy in NM. I have Michael 17 yo  and Kenna 14 yo . We&#39;ve <br/>
been homeschooling/unschooling since May of 1998. <br/>
Michael is into video games and BattleBots.  <br/>
Kenna reads and writes a lot of fanfic.<br/>
I&#39;ll probably lurk here more than anything. <br/>
Nice to see you all,<br/>
Joy in NM</div>
