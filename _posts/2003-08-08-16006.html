&lt;&lt; Brianna & I have to spell certain words so that Teah (our dog) doesn&#39;t get <br/>
excited.<br/>
Some of the words are <br/>
out<br/>
eat<br/>
business. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We spell &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;Gudrun&quot; (her name) if we&#39;re talking about the dog where <br/>
she is, and it&#39;s not about something immediate.  We don&#39;t want her thinking <br/>
it&#39;s food or play time if it was just a passing reference.<br/>
