For me, one of the most difficult challenges of unschooling has been to<br/>
accept that there are areas that need improving in my parenting and in<br/>
myself.  This realization left me feeling quite vulnerable, but working<br/>
through that, and working with that, allowed me to make the changes I needed<br/>
to make to build that healthier relationship I desired for my family.  I<br/>
thought, in light of the discussions we have been having these past few<br/>
weeks, this video would be worth sharing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191442894">Thank you for this. I feel deeply connected with this because I had a<br/>
similar &#39;breakdown&#39; two years back and needed to be able to reach a place<br/>
within where I could say &quot;I am enough&quot; and I can now love whole heartedly. I<br/>
started with my husband with me but the catharsis that was happening was<br/>
difficult for him to handle so we decided to be away from each other. So I<br/>
had to move out only to find this place within me and get back with him and<br/>
my family. He has been physically away but always been there even when he<br/>
was miles away. Because I knew for sure that it was always about me and not<br/>
anyone else. Life is not perfect and to be hard on oneself in trying to make<br/>
it that way is the biggest illusion that one can live in.<br/>
<br/>
Most things we do we don&#39;t &quot;have to do&quot;. But if we chose to do it then to do<br/>
it with no expectation of the &quot;perfect picture&quot; is living life joyously and<br/>
with freedom.<br/>
<br/>
