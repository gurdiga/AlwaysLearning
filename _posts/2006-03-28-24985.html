<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080299645"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;We Holly flagged as her real age when we were in AOL, and found she  <br/>

**I&#39;m realizing this is the way it is for us too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
***Sorry about that! No thanks to reading their webpages or calling their <br/>
salesman! &lt;bg!&gt;  I&#39;m reading more responses on parental blocks here and I&#39;m <br/>
agreeing that having them is not only so limiting to us and our kids, they are also <br/>
a big pain in the butt and something I don&#39;t want to deal with. Not only <br/>
that, there is no way I would ever pay for something like that, especially on a <br/>
monthly basis. Parental controls on our internet service limit you so bad it&#39;s <br/>
ridiculous. We do explore the internet together with our kids and talk about <br/>
the things they may not want to encounter there all the time but they don&#39;t <br/>
always want us sitting there with them every time they get on and I don&#39;t blame <br/>
them for that. It&#39;s not that they are doing anything wrong, I know it&#39;s just <br/>
that they enjoy that freedom, and rightfully so. We have only had the Internet in <br/>
our house for a little over a yr. now (yes we&#39;re slow, we always just went to <br/>
the library or the kids used it at school) so this is still a learning <br/>
process for us. We&#39;ve also only been un/hsing for just over a year also. Thanks for <br/>
the &quot;free advice&quot; &lt;g&gt; I guess we just need more time...with the Internet and <br/>
UNschooling. :o)<br/>
