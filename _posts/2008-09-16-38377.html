<div id="ygrps-yiv-800527460">I usually don&#39;t care what people carry away and quote, but because  <br/>
this involves other people, I&#39;d like for it to stay on the list and  <br/>
in the archives, but not be taken out and quoted.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the past week each of my children has impressed me with a kind of  <br/>
maturity I didn&#39;t have at their ages.<br/>
<br/>
Marty broke up with his girlfriend, and talked to me about it.  He  <br/>
was concerned about her wellbeing, hoped to maintain the friendship,  <br/>
wanted to make sure he fulfilled things she had counted on him to do  <br/>
(he&#39;s still willing to help her paint her house... did I mention she  <br/>
has her own place?  Yeah.... I know I didn&#39;t, but it&#39;s a factor in my  <br/>
mind).   It was his decision.  I asked him if there was someone else  <br/>
he liked, and he said no, it wasn&#39;t that.   And he LIKES the girl.   <br/>
He said something like he just didn&#39;t have the urge to reproduce with  <br/>
her (he might&#39;ve said procreate).  So I think he was saying he wasn&#39;t  <br/>
madly in love with her.  I didn&#39;t quiz him further than what he  <br/>
volunteered to share.  Maybe he meant he didn&#39;t think she would be a  <br/>
good mom for some reason, but he didn&#39;t say that.  I think it was a  <br/>
comment about his feelings about her.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had been scheduled to go to Las Vegas, Nevada (we always  <br/>
specify in New Mexico, because Las Vegas alone is Las Vegas, New  <br/>
Mexico) this week, to be at Treasure Island for &quot;Talk Like a Pirate  <br/>
Day.&quot;   The loss of that plan came in stages.  Several of his co- <br/>
workers had heard they would all get a bonus at a certain time and  <br/>
decided to spend it on a trip to Las Vegas, but that bonus didn&#39;t  <br/>
come through (or not yet, anyway).  Then his roommate had invited a  <br/>
bunch of his high school friends to meet them there too there, but  <br/>
they all drink for fun.  So Kirby told me (a few hours after I had  <br/>
talked to Marty about his relationship change) that he had decided it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t worth the money and time off to him, as he doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
gamble or get drunk.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s is more subtle but involves a desire not to discuss having  <br/>
children with her current boyfriend (not to discuss the topic with  <br/>
anyone) because at the moment she can&#39;t figure out  how she would  <br/>
deal with his mother.  I reminded her that it&#39;s not something she  <br/>
needs to think about right away, and so she doesn&#39;t want to talk  <br/>
about it or think about it.  She loves the guy, and they get along  <br/>
very well, and he clearly loves her.  They both have a lot of growing  <br/>
and thinking to do.   What brought that on, though, was his visit to  <br/>
his grandmother&#39;s where he talked with his sister and aunt and  <br/>
grandmother, about Holly, and they expressed concern about whether,  <br/>
if he stayed with Holly longterm, their children would be  <br/>
homeschooled or go to school.  He said he doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he and Holly got married and stayed together until 2059, it  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t guarantee they would even *have* children.  Just thinking  <br/>
about all the possible pressures was too much for Holly to think  <br/>
about, and I don&#39;t blame her.  MANY teens and young adults and even  <br/>
young parents are absolutely positively sure in advance what they  <br/>
*are* going to do, and it turns out to be wrong!   They change their  <br/>
mind, for a myriad of reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Holly would love to have children, but she&#39;s considering the inlaws  <br/>
in her thoughts about who the father should be.  And laws are  <br/>
changing all around us.  It used to be that staying unmarried was all  <br/>
the safety a mom needed to be able to make all her own decisions  <br/>
about the child-rearing, but recent legal cases have blown that away.  <br/>
The government holds biological fathers responsible for child support  <br/>
(at least they do where I live), and the moms can&#39;t easily cut off  <br/>
from the obligation to let fathers AND grandparents have access to  <br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
But given all that in less than a week&#39;s time, I&#39;m feeling very  <br/>
confident that my kids can and will live mindfully and responsibly,  <br/>
because they already are.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;MANY teens and young adults and even <br/>
young parents are  absolutely positively sure in advance what they <br/>
*are* going to do, and it  turns out to be wrong! They change their <br/>
mind, for a myriad of  reasons.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was quite sure, myself. I had it all planned out. Very  traditional, much <br/>
how I was raised, minus the hitting and the clean plate club.  School, <br/>
grounding, parent-knows-best as boss, benevolent leader. Marrying before  I was 22 <br/>
(okay, I got that part), having kids close together and early, no  generation gap <br/>
in *my* family. :~)<br/>
 <br/>
Thankfully, fate stepped in. I am a hugely better mama (and  person) having <br/>
born my first at 33 rather than 21. Hugely. So far from  &quot;traditional&quot; and <br/>
&quot;mainstream&quot; that I think folks who knew me in high school  wouldn&#39;t recognize the <br/>
person I am today (personality wise). One of my biggest  mantras when I was a <br/>
teen was, &quot;Parent&#39;s *can&#39;t* be their kids&#39; friend!&quot; Ohy... <br/>
 <br/>
Most likely, my kids will be less averse to changing their  minds and see it <br/>
more as a simple, daily thing than I did. I know they&#39;re more  open-minded <br/>
about things and more interested in what is good rather than how to  please. They <br/>
know their own minds before 10 years old the way it took me over 35  years to <br/>
do-maybe even moreso than I do. And more naturally, easier than I  do.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank goodness we can change our minds.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Oh my gosh. They have translators.  I thought of doing my whole main  <br/>
page for the occasion on Friday, but I guess I won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did get this far, though, before a came to my senses:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The pirate speaks,&quot;LEARNING ALL THE TIME People learn by playin&#39;,  <br/>
thinkin&#39; and amazin&#39; themselves. They learn while they&#39;re laughin&#39; at  <br/>
somethin&#39; surprisin&#39;, and they learn while they&#39;re wonderin&#39; &quot;What t&#39;  <br/>
heck be this!?&quot; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big John Holt fan. Even t&#39; book titles be informative and  <br/>
inspirin&#39;: Learnin&#39; All t&#39; Time; Never Too Late; Teach Your Own.<br/>
<br/>
I have a discussion group called AlwaysLearnin&#39;, where t&#39; principles  <br/>
underlyin&#39; unschoolin&#39; be discussed. Some other discussion lists o&#39;  <br/>
interest be described and linked here.</div>
