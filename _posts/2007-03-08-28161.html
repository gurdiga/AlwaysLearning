<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753733843">My dd likes to pull at stuff like the couch and throw blanket <br/>
strings, and son starts to toss pillows off the couch, so we plan <br/>
around that.  <br/>
<br/>
We have loads of stuff around our couch (right now there is duct tape <br/>
for duct tape bags and wallets, paper dolls and scissors, legos, some <br/>
knitting and a lap loom, one of those tubes filled with water and <br/>
stuff, and some wooden spoons ~ not exactly sure *why* they are there <br/>
lol).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;d like to learn to finger knit while her skin heals a bit?  <br/>
Also, maybe keeping lotion around will keep the skin smoother.  For a <br/>
while my dd was biting the skin on her lips, and having a tube of lip <br/>
balm handy all over helped that healing.<br/>
<br/>
It seems as if a conversation about it, as in, &quot;Hey, are your hands <br/>
dry?  Mine are this time of year and I use blah blah...&quot; would be <br/>
more appropriate than leaving it alone.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for your response.  No, our lives are pretty stress-free *as  <br/>
far as I can see*.  Things may be happening in her life that she is  <br/>
not aware of.  DH is a fisherman, and his hands are full of dried and  <br/>
torn skin.  One day she started picking off the dead skin from his  <br/>
hands and from then on she started on her own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Vida!<br/>
<br/>
My dd (6.75) is also very fastidious about the skin around her <br/>
fingertips and nails, and so much so that she would chew the area and <br/>
it became infected, and rather painful, so she decided on her own she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t chew them anymore.  She doesn&#39;t like scaling skin on her feet <br/>
either, and picks at it, too.  <br/>
<br/>
At one point, we were talking about why she wanted to chew on her skin <br/>
and pick at the loose skin, she said it was a &quot;boredom buster&quot;!  So it <br/>
was something I needed to examine about how engaging and stimulating <br/>
and interesting things are for her around here and how I could make <br/>
things better, or more interesting.  She is very creative and likes to <br/>
do a lot of hands on stuff, so making myself (and lots of supplies!) <br/>
available for different crafts and sewing and beading and experiments <br/>
in general has helped in that regard, the more tedious the project, <br/>
the better.<br/>
<br/>
She still picks at any loose skin, she says she just doesn&#39;t like it!<br/>
<br/>
I always enjoyed when I was a kid stuck in school (yep, I was bored) <br/>
putting glue on my hands and letting it dry and then peeling it off.  <br/>
I still do it, on occasion!  Not because I&#39;m bored, but because it is <br/>
fun and I enjoy it :). <br/>
<br/>
Just some idears to think about,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129908075">Hi Sandie,<br/>
<br/>
This was great! Thanks for helping me see even more clearly that I  <br/>
need to keep letting go of control while  providing more interesting  <br/>
opportunities for her to get her fingers in.<br/>
<br/>
I must be doing something right... at least moving in the right  <br/>
direction.  Athena said to me yesterday, &quot;See Mom.... we never get  <br/>
mad at each other anymore.&quot;  That brought tears to my eyes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847309771">A small trick I use with myself when considering how to approach one of my<br/>
children is to think of how I would broach the subject with a friend.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest tends to lick his lips when they are chapped, until all the skin<br/>
around his mouth is raw.  He won&#39;t use lip balm or anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I simply asked him if it was painful, he said it wasn&#39;t.  I told him that my<br/>
concern was that it might get infected and that I thought drinking more<br/>
water would help.  For several months he ignored my advice but then one day<br/>
he began drinking water saying he wanted it to clear up.  It comes and goes<br/>
now but he takes care of it himself.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could just calmly ask her if her fingers are bothering her or if<br/>
they hurt.  Say it like you would to an adult, ask her if she would like<br/>
lotion or ointment.  If she were my child I would share my concern about<br/>
infection, especially on hands because they come into contact with so many<br/>
germs.  Do your best to not get pushy, I know I tend to dig in my heels and<br/>
become illogical when I&#39;m being pushed.<br/>
<br/>
