<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408945642">-=-We have some friends whose family are going through a court case  <br/>
here in Ontario, the question being can the children actually be  <br/>
&quot;forced&quot; to go to school - the father wants the kids to be in school,  <br/>
but the mother, who the court has ruled as the parent with custody and  <br/>
so therefore ruled that she could make the initial decision, took the  <br/>
children out of school - but the father is still pursuing the case,  <br/>
with the stated aim that the children could somehow be &quot;forced&quot; to go  <br/>
back to school - -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;forced&quot; when it&#39;s a court decision.  The mother wasn&#39;t  <br/>
&quot;forced&quot; to have custody, so putting that word in quotation marks puts  <br/>
emphasis in the wrong place, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is a luxury.  It&#39;s not the default.   Government  <br/>
education is the default.  Private schools are an allowable option.   <br/>
Homeschooling is a newer option, but it&#39;s no one&#39;s unchallengeable  <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am thinking this relates to your case perhaps - is it really  <br/>
possible that a state could &quot;force&quot; children who do not want to go to  <br/>
school, to go to school?=-<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  Easily.  It&#39;s called compulsory attendance, in most  <br/>
places.  If that&#39;s what the state provides and requires, anything else  <br/>
is an exemption, and exemptions can be revoked.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, I would imagine, in Ontario at any rate, that not having to  <br/>
pay for special programs for children on the spectrum, they wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be in a big hurry to put them back in the system -=-<br/>
<br/>
They &quot;Pay&quot; for those programs by giving the money to employees in the  <br/>
system.  It doesn&#39;t go outside the educational system (except to their  <br/>
suppliers of books, furniture, equipment).<br/>
<br/>
-=-- it might be a good &quot;reality&quot; check to see if the state has  <br/>
actually ever &quot;forced&quot; home-schooled children back to school - I could  <br/>
be being naive, but how could it be done?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The way it is done, frequently and regularly, is that a judge orders  <br/>
that the children have to attend school.<br/>
That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Divorce is the biggest danger to any child&#39;s ability to unschool that  <br/>
there can be.<br/>
<br/>
People need to get along with their spouses or partners or ex-es if  <br/>
they want unschooling in their lives at all, in any way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552174838">Kasey, have you considered skipping the test and do an non-testing evaluation instead?  You don&#39;t have to do a standardized test in WA if you do an eval with a licensed teacher.  You might try Patrice Torres who specifically does non-testing evals for unschoolers including for special needs students. (torresbrown.com).  <br/>
<br/>
We have not used her (yet) since our kids are under 8, but someone on EU recommended her and you can look through the archives for that info if you wanted to talk to someone who has actually used her services.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and try not to stress. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Stop worrying!  Breathe!<br/>
<br/>
The state of Washington doesn&#39;t require you to turn in any tests, it<br/>
only states that you must take them and keep them for your own private<br/>
records.  Nobody ever has to see them ever!  You don&#39;t even have to see<br/>
the scores, so stop looking at them.  When the scores arrive in the<br/>
mail, plop it into a folder marked homeschooling and file it away for<br/>
&quot;just in case&quot; you ever put your kids in school, which is the only time<br/>
a school official would ever want to see those test scores, and<br/>
sometimes not even then.<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage everyone who doesn&#39;t know, to get to know what their<br/>
local laws are.  Ignorance isn&#39;t really always bliss!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736634145">I don&#39;t know about Washington, but I can tell you what I know about <br/>
Georgia and SC, both as a former teacher and as an unschooling mother <br/>
of three fabulous children - one of which was diagnosed with <br/>
Aspergers 3 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Georgia tests every three years starting with 3rd grade.  Luckily we <br/>
avoided all that testing by moving to SC.  However, even if we were <br/>
still in Georgia, I wouldn&#39;t worry about the testing.  Georgia law <br/>
states that kids have to be tested, but no where in the law does it <br/>
say those scores have to be shown to anyone.  Even if the school <br/>
board comes to my door asking for them, I don&#39;t have to show them.  <br/>
The law is on my side in this one.  So step one in battling this fear <br/>
is to know your state&#39;s law.  If Washington is like Georgia, then <br/>
your son can take that test and you can file the results away in the <br/>
unopened envelope, and that will be the absolute end of it.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I know about Georgia and SC (and is probably true for <br/>
many other states), is that the schools are overcrowded and the <br/>
special ed department is stretched thin.  Regular classroom teachers <br/>
dread mainstreamed special ed students, due to the extra paperwork <br/>
involved as well as the classroom management and instructional <br/>
modification issues.  In other words, they can&#39;t see past my son&#39;s <br/>
label into what a truly fabulous kid he is, and they don&#39;t really <br/>
want him in their schools.  <br/>
<br/>
I have come to the conclusion that unless there are custody issues, <br/>
or some freak neighbor decides to file a report with DFACS, DSS, CPS <br/>
or whatever a particular state calls it, the state and the school <br/>
board are pretty much going to stay out of my business.  They are way <br/>
to busy, and I am just one little person who is too insignificant to <br/>
even show up on their radar (even if my son was previously in the <br/>
system).<br/>
<br/>
Which leads me to a question:  Are you concerned that the school <br/>
system might make you send your kids to school, or are you concerned <br/>
that your son is not making as much progress as you think he should <br/>
be making?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already addressed the former.  As for the latter, you have a <br/>
special boy.  Less than 1/3 of the children on the autism spectrum <br/>
can speak, and that figure includes high functioning autism and <br/>
Asperger&#39;s.  Every day, I am thankful that Trevor learned to <br/>
communicate, even if the right words don&#39;t always come at the right <br/>
time for him.  There is no deadline for him to learn what he needs to <br/>
learn.  I&#39;ve learned to appreciate the little things that I take for <br/>
granted in my other two children.  Like the first time Trevor told a <br/>
lie - I could have jumped for joy (actually my dh and I both did a <br/>
little victory dance once Trevor left the room).  Or when he used a <br/>
slang expression in the correct context.  My point is, I don&#39;t <br/>
measure Trevor&#39;s progress in terms of math and reading, or those <br/>
other things on the standardized tests.  Instead, I measure his <br/>
progress just like I did when he was a baby, in terms of what he can <br/>
do today that he couldn&#39;t do yesterday, and I always try to keep in <br/>
mind that some progress can&#39;t be seen or measured at all.<br/>

Their dad is the same, he doesn&#39;t listen to what they are saying about how unhappy they are in school or that they have an alternate plan in place (just to pacify him, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t do any plan - they are enrolled in the Clonlara home-based course, which is fairly unschooling-friendly, but requires paperwork)...they are hoping that the court will rule that since they have a plan in place, he doesn&#39;t actually have anything to base his objections on...and they will be getting a divorce, especially after this...<br/>

Is there any chance your friend the mom would be willing to stay with  <br/>

<br/>
Yes.  It has taken something on the order of 7 months for me and Brian<br/>
to have a really decent conversation about our relationship.  Really<br/>
rough going but bit by bit by bit, it has been possible for us to make<br/>
peace and maybe someday we can even be happy together.  I hope so.  We<br/>
divorced but got back together.  Long story.  Worth the effort in my<br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it seems like the other &quot;side,&quot; the person over there,<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a point or a good reason for disagreeing with a spouse.<br/>
Even if they don&#39;t, I think it&#39;s very worth the effort to try to make<br/>
things work out to the best of your ability and to gain in the ability<br/>
to do that.  Especially if unschooling is very dear to you and really<br/>
matters to you and the kids.  If the kids are teens and don&#39;t have<br/>
long to go, it would probably make their lives much easier, not just<br/>
in terms of immediate resources, but in the long run... in their own<br/>
relationship with their dad and men in general.<br/>

<br/>
  I&#39;m trying to make a list of things that parents and teachers think must <br/>
  be taught to children.<br/>
<br/>
  All ages - from infancy through young adulthood -<br/>
<br/>
  For example, they think children must be taught to say please and thank <br/>
  you, they must be taught to tie their shoes, they must be taught the <br/>
  alphabet, they must be taught to read, they must be taught to eat <br/>
  healthy foods, they must be taught to ...... whatever you think of <br/>
  that fills in that blank will be helpful to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230326865">My friend, did not want the divorce at all, despite the bad <br/>
marriage, she was willing to stick it out for the kids. She begged <br/>
him to go to counselling with her..but he refused. She&#39;s pretty sure <br/>
he&#39;s been seeing another woman. Their marriage has been rocky for a <br/>
long time. The kids do not want to go to school! The dad was ok with <br/>
hm&#39;schooling at first, but then he got to the point where he wasn&#39;t <br/>
interested in the family anymore, and not home alot. They&#39;ve been <br/>
married about 18 yrs. My daughter and her kids are best friends too. <br/>
We don&#39;t get to hang out so much now, since they&#39;re attempting to <br/>
study for this dang test.... sigh... frustrating, wish I could wave <br/>
my magic wand and fix it all. I&#39;m there when she needs to talk or <br/>
have a good cry...and I try to make it as much fun as I can, when <br/>
her kids are at my house.<br/>
