<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340234324">I would like to collect some stories, here, of the results of online friendships, in response to this, from another topic:<br/>

Why would you encourage a child to make friends online? That&#39;s not real interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real interaction. Your kid is not a robot.<br/>

A few of my stories:<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian and I have visited back and forth, with our three children who are about the same age, and used to be from 4-10 years old and are now from 23 to 29 or so.  It helped me to know another family with children about the same age, number and range as my kids, and they had fun together, many times.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll and her daughter Kat came to visit us many years ago (and a few times after) and there are photos of Kat holding a tumbleweed up over her head (somewhere).  It was a real tumbleweed, even if the rest of it was &quot;not real.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After I met Julie Daniel&#39;s family in person, they invited Holly (who was a teen) to stay with them for a while.  Recently after staying in India with someone I meet on the internet (and later in person), she wanted to stay with Julie&#39;s family on the way home, but they were driving across the U.S. (having visited people they  met online) and so Janine Davies (someone I only know online) very generously offered to host Holly for a few weeks.  Now I think they might be friends for life.<br/>
<br/>
When I was frustrated, overwhelmed and depressed once, Jill Parmer drove from northern Colorado to my house in Albuquerque to help me and to cheer me up.  It was VERY sweet, and for real. <br/>
<br/>
I could tell a hundred stories without thinking hard, about doing real-life things with people I first met online.<br/>

<div dir='ltr'>Most of the other unschoolers I know I first met online. Sandra Dodd has been to stay at our house, I have visited Schuyler Waynforth and Kai gamed with Simon while we chatted outside, and i&#39;ve made the effort to meet other unschoolers i&#39;ve known online when we have travelled around Australia - in Queensland, Melbourne, Adelaide, etc.<br><br>Beatrice Mantovani, whom I first met online, and her girls also came to stay with us - Kai took them spotlighting for koala&#39;s and spiders in our local national park :)<br><br>We have other friends we still only know from online - Kai skypes most days with Astra - an unschooled friend who lives in Sydney - we hope to visit them IRL this year sometime. He also skypes often with Caitlyn, an unschooled friend who lives in the US - not sure when we&#39;ll be able to visit Caitlyn IRL - but Caitlyn introduced us to Pokemon - a friend indeed!<br><br><b>Jo Isaac, PhD</b><br><br>Post-Doctoral Research Assistant,&nbsp;<br>Centre of Tropical Biodiversity and Climate Change,&nbsp;<br>James Cook University, Townsville.<br><br>Scientific Writer and Researcher: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joisaac.wordpress.com">http://joisaac.wordpress.com</a><br><br><div><hr id="ygrps-yiv-1577853507stopSpelling">To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br>From: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br>Date: Fri, 30 Jan 2015 15:47:21 -0700<br>Subject: [AlwaysLearning] People you have met online<br><br>

My son has online friends. They are other real human beings that he&#39;s communicating with via text/skype/video. Their conversations are real. Their fun is real. Their laughter is real (and contagious!) Their arguments, when they have them, are real. Their process of working through that and usually making up is real. Their connection is real. On the occasions he has met up with any of them in person, they&#39;re still real people, with the real history of friendship they&#39;ve forged online.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids don&#39;t live in the last century, with penpals and waiting several weeks for a letter from the other side of the world. They live here and now in this exciting time where they can not only log onto Skype and immediately see and chat with someone on another continent, and joke, chat and banter, they can also play together, collaborate on games and worlds and missions online in real time. That&#39;s absolutely real. The friendship, the play, the learning, it&#39;s all real, and in a form that&#39;s as natural to them as playing with the kids in the same street, because they&#39;ve grown up with it as a real option.<br/>

And I want to say that part of an interview I did with Jill Parmer (it will be in the upcoming issue of The Homeschooler magazine) is about online gaming leading to real-life meet-ups.  <br/>
<br/>
When Holly drove across the country last fall (Albuquerque to Washington DC, and back by a more southerly route) she stayed with LOTS of unschooling famiies, and one stop on the way back through Mississippi was with someone she used to play Halo with online when she was 14 or so, and they stayed in touch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232261506">When I was in high school, I met a friend online that went to Havard and he came and stayed with my family for a couple nights. He was a really nice kid and we talked online for months. He was also someone I would have never met otherwise because he was a 16 year old Harvard student and I was just an average girl in high school, chatting with some kids much smarter than I about philosophy type things. He was an east coast kid, I grew up in Southern California. Meeting him was a great experience and I&#39;m glad I got to spend that time with him!<div><br></div><div>My son is online right now playing with his friends. They are real friends.

      <p>I would like to collect some stories, here, of the results of online friendships, in response to this, from another topic:<br>

Why would you encourage a child to make friends online? That&#39;s not real interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real interaction. Your kid is not a robot.<br>

A few of my stories:<br>
<br>
Pam Sorooshian and I have visited back and forth, with our three children who are about the same age, and used to be from 4-10 years old and are now from 23 to 29 or so.  It helped me to know another family with children about the same age, number and range as my kids, and they had fun together, many times.<br>
<br>
Joyce Fetteroll and her daughter Kat came to visit us many years ago (and a few times after) and there are photos of Kat holding a tumbleweed up over her head (somewhere).  It was a real tumbleweed, even if the rest of it was &quot;not real.&quot;<br>
<br>
After I met Julie Daniel&#39;s family in person, they invited Holly (who was a teen) to stay with them for a while.  Recently after staying in India with someone I meet on the internet (and later in person), she wanted to stay with Julie&#39;s family on the way home, but they were driving across the U.S. (having visited people they  met online) and so Janine Davies (someone I only know online) very generously offered to host Holly for a few weeks.  Now I think they might be friends for life.<br>
<br>
When I was frustrated, overwhelmed and depressed once, Jill Parmer drove from northern Colorado to my house in Albuquerque to help me and to cheer me up.  It was VERY sweet, and for real. <br>
<br>
I could tell a hundred stories without thinking hard, about doing real-life things with people I first met online.<br>

encourage a child to make friends online? That&#39;s not real
interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real

      <div>When I was in high school, I met a friend online that went to Havard and he came and stayed with my family for a couple nights. He was a really nice kid and we talked online for months. He was also someone I would have never met otherwise because he was a 16 year old Harvard student and I was just an average girl in high school, chatting with some kids much smarter than I about philosophy type things. He was an east coast kid, I grew up in Southern California. Meeting him was a great experience and I&#39;m glad I got to spend that time with him!</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>My son is online right now playing with his friends. They are real friends. They are laughing and communicating. They are wearing headphones and hearing one another&#39;s voices. They are asking questions about one another&#39;s families and home lives. Hearing him interact--real interaction--makes me happy. I smile when I hear him. He would be gaming anyway, so why not game with other kids that share his same interests? What a wonderful gift technology has given us,&nbsp;that my son, who is not so fond of leaving the house, can connect and play with other kids!</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>My daughter plays on the unschooling minecraft server every day. She has friends on there whom she skypes with while playing. She loves her friends! They build together and chat, laugh and play. Why would I complain? Why would I discourage that?? She&#39;s connecting. She&#39;s relating. She&#39;s building relationships.&nbsp;</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>I have lots of friends on Facebook that I have never met. Other parents mostly who share my same interests and we chat and share about things we&#39;re going through and help each other out.</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>I&#39;ve recently had a baby and bought everything second hand. I bought the items from people I found online. People I had never met. We connected and met and I was able to purchase many necessary items for a fraction of the cost. If it weren&#39;t for online communications, I&#39;m not sure how I would have found these people!</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>I also have many friends online that I have met but don&#39;t see very often. Family and old childhood friends. We are able to keep up with one another&#39;s lives through Facebook. I think it&#39;s such a blessing! I can watch my cousin&#39;s kids grow up and feel like I&#39;m a part of their life. I personally really love online communication.</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>I listened to one Sandra&#39;s podcasts and one thing that really stuck out in my mind was when she said (paraphrasing here) a parent can really mess up unschooling when they don&#39;t allow their child to make lots of friends, wherever possible. This includes online. Our job is to encourage communication in whatever form that may come in. Just because you go to your neighbor&#39;s for coffee doesn&#39;t mean your neighbor is really your friend either, right?</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>Times are changing. I have friends from a trip to Myanmar that I still stay in touch with! They are on the other side of the world and I can still feel like a part of their life. I think this is huge!<span></span></div><div>&nbsp;<br clear="none"><br clear="none">On Friday, January 30, 2015, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

      <div>I would like to collect some stories, here, of the results of online friendships, in response to this, from another topic:<br clear="none">

Why would you encourage a child to make friends online? That&#39;s not real interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real interaction. Your kid is not a robot.<br clear="none">

A few of my stories:<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Pam Sorooshian and I have visited back and forth, with our three children who are about the same age, and used to be from 4-10 years old and are now from 23 to 29 or so.  It helped me to know another family with children about the same age, number and range as my kids, and they had fun together, many times.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Joyce Fetteroll and her daughter Kat came to visit us many years ago (and a few times after) and there are photos of Kat holding a tumbleweed up over her head (somewhere).  It was a real tumbleweed, even if the rest of it was &quot;not real.&quot;<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
After I met Julie Daniel&#39;s family in person, they invited Holly (who was a teen) to stay with them for a while.  Recently after staying in India with someone I meet on the internet (and later in person), she wanted to stay with Julie&#39;s family on the way home, but they were driving across the U.S. (having visited people they  met online) and so Janine Davies (someone I only know online) very generously offered to host Holly for a few weeks.  Now I think they might be friends for life.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
When I was frustrated, overwhelmed and depressed once, Jill Parmer drove from northern Colorado to my house in Albuquerque to help me and to cheer me up.  It was VERY sweet, and for real. <br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
I could tell a hundred stories without thinking hard, about doing real-life things with people I first met online.<br clear="none">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342732671">Several years ago, my son met a kid on XBox whom he really clicked with; after a year or so of daily on-line chatting, they decided that they wanted to meet in person (they were then about 15 years old).  We arranged with the young man&#39;s parents for him to come stay with us for a week.  His parents were understandably nervous, but they had a relative in the vicinity who we met beforehand.  The week-long visit turned into two weeks, and then another visit six months later.  The boys had so much fun!<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s other best friend is a kid in West Virginia (we&#39;re in Southern California); they met online when they were about 10, and they&#39;ve talked or texted nearly every day for the past seven years.  They&#39;ve helped each other through first jobs, girlfriends, learning to drive, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Some of my own favorite friendships have been &quot;virtual&quot; ones...some have led to real-life meetings (and even a girls&#39; trip to Vegas!), and many haven&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Online friendships feel (and look) pretty real to me! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551364896">&quot;I would like to collect some stories, here, of the results of online<br/>
friendships, in response to this, from another topic:&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Online interactions? Yes, please.<br/>
<br/>
Like Alex, I also met my husband online. Well, it wasn&#39;t really the<br/>
&#39;internet&#39; back in 1996. We were on the same BBS, a local chat site that<br/>
required dialing in via modem to a local server. Because long-distance calls<br/>
cost too much, these servers were usually bound by city limits and many had<br/>
occasional gatherings. I saw my husband from a distance at one of these<br/>
monthly gatherings (the only one I ever went to), and though I was too<br/>
nervous to walk up to him, I did ask someone else what his username was. And<br/>
so a conversation between &#39;hiwaychild&#39; (me) and &#39;nemesis&#39; (him) began. We<br/>
chatted on the BBS for hours and hours nearly every day, often until the wee<br/>
hours of the morning. We didn&#39;t meet in person for weeks, though we were<br/>
already completely infatuated by then. I&#39;d had a child at 16, and looking<br/>
back on it, it was a sweet way for us to have long, uninterrupted<br/>
conversations in a safe environment. I was almost 18 when we &#39;met&#39; online.<br/>
After 4 1/2 years of dating, we were married, and this year we&#39;ll celebrate<br/>
our 15th anniversary. Just recently, Dr. Doofenshmirtz even wrote a love<br/>
song about us! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9faYaGdLS4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9faYaGdLS4</a><br/>
<br/>
Shortly after I met my husband, I joined him in an online Diku MUD he was<br/>
playing (kind of like WoW, but with only text and no pictures ;) ). I joined<br/>
the same clan he was in and even though I didn&#39;t really talk to too many<br/>
people in the game, names became familiar. So when one person in our clan<br/>
was looking for someone in the Bay Area to be an office manager at his<br/>
company, I offered to do it. Another person in the clan, along with his<br/>
Japanese partner, had started a business in Japan. The hardware they were<br/>
creating was infused with high-security encryption, and the US government<br/>
required them to have an office here in the states in order to sell their<br/>
products. I came on as the second staff member and held full<br/>
responsibilities as office manager and accountant, handling all the payroll<br/>
and business taxes (I read a lot of books :) and running the entire office<br/>
by myself. I was barely 18. As the business grew, they hired more people<br/>
from the game. Two came from Michigan, one of which was a hacker who became<br/>
a very skilled and in-demand software programmer, later starting his own<br/>
business and selling it, making him a millionaire before age 25. I&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure he would not have had that opportunity in the small town in Michigan<br/>
where he lived. The company also hired a guy from Washington to be a<br/>
salesman, and the business even paid airfare and rented a fully furnished<br/>
home for these three guys near the office building. Once I left that<br/>
company, I had my pick of accounting jobs since I had done so many things<br/>
and I ended up as a consultant for KPMG before my 20th birthday.<br/>
<br/>
On a personal front, I&#39;m an extreme introvert and will rarely choose to be<br/>
around people. I have a great deal of social anxiety and had panic attacks<br/>
for nearly a decade whenever the phone would ring. I still hate talking on<br/>
the phone and will avoid it if at all possible. I often joke that texting<br/>
and Facebook were invented just for me. Now I regularly keep in touch with<br/>
friends and family all over the country. Thanks to Facebook, I say &#39;Happy<br/>
Birthday&#39; to people whose birthdays I wouldn&#39;t have even known, and I can<br/>
comment on how cute their kids&#39; haircuts are even though I&#39;ve never even met<br/>
some of their kids in person. I am still in contact with people I would have<br/>
stopped calling or seeing a long time ago, and I have more friends now than<br/>
the rest of my life put together. I can send a quick note of love to my<br/>
husband or let my sister in Phoenix know I&#39;m thinking about her any time I<br/>
want, even if it&#39;s not convenient for them. <br/>
<br/>
And in May, when my good friends move to Ethiopia to work at a children&#39;s<br/>
camp there for three years, I will communicate with them by email, because<br/>
even though internet connection is not reliable in their village, it still<br/>
has a better chance of arrival than a letter. I may even get the chance to<br/>
Skype with them, if I&#39;m lucky, so I can see their adorable 3-year old twins<br/>
and 10-month old baby as they grow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399808865">This has bothered me again in a whole new way:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why would you encourage a child to make friends online? That&#39;s not real interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real interaction. Your kid is not a robot.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m quite tired of parents who insult children for things the parents themselves are doing.<br/>
Parents (usually moms) will go online to rant and rave about how bad it is for kids to be online.<br/>
Parents (usually moms) will write at length about the evils of &quot;screentime,&quot; while spending that time NOT with their children.<br/>
<br/>
Hypocrisy should be an embarrassment.  Did the person who wrote &quot;That&#39;s not real interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real interaction. Your kid is not a robot.&quot; even think?<br/>
<br/>
Thinking is required for unschooling to work well.<br/>
<br/>
This group was created in November 2001.  It has nothing to do with robots.  There have been over 75,500 messages. Every single one was read by MANY people.  Hundreds of people.  That is real writing, for a real reason.   It has changed the lives of thousands of children over those years.  Readers are engaged, writers are engaged, lives are made better WHEN AND IF the readers are thoughtful, if they read a little and try some of those ideas out in their homes, with their real children.  <br/>
<br/>
That is real interaction, very locally between mother and child, and very internationally, because people from dozens of countries have written and read here.<br/>
<br/>
The second-worst thing is joining a group like this to, and using an electronic device to insult the very media.<br/>
The worst thing is joining a group that is so intended to support children and relationships, and to so casually disregard children and relationships.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394368464">This topic made me suddenly emotional . . .  it made me happy to think about people I have met online!  It also made me sad: that there could be any doubt about the value of friendship that is possible between people who have not actually met in person but who share their thoughts and feelings through writing (and now skyping - although I&#39;m not actually so good at this one!).  Because I love writing, that idea makes the written word and its capacity to communicate across distance quite impoverished.<br/>
<br/>
I met Sandra Dodd online - she and other people on this forum have given me so much real support and guidance in the last five years.<br/>
Sandra even came to stay with us in Cairns, Australia last year.  That was a sweet manifestation in real space/time of an online friendship.<br/>
<br/>
I have also a group of online women friends from when my ten year old girl was a baby.  I joined a continuum concept forum when I was pregnant with my first child and eventually some of us formed another sub group on Facebook as we shared many similar perspectives, especially unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently we spoke about how it would be wonderful if we could somehow bring ourselves together in real time, even though we are from so many different continents.  I think it is extraordinary that  people from so many diverse geographical locations can actually become a circle of friends as if sitting around a kitchen table!<br/>
<br/>
People have been communicating forever without being in the same space/time - ancient and modern people describe communicating with the dead, and with the yet to be born!  In Australia there are stories of indigenous people who could communicate across distance &#39;telepathically&#39;, convey knowledge from one area to another, from one person/group to another without ever having been in that place, or with that person.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247904991">Apart from all the wonderful unschooling people I&#39;ve met online, I also have the Internet to thank for my dearest friend. &nbsp;I met her on a message board two years ago, we started PMing, then moved to Skype messaging and now kik. We are also Facebook and Instagram friends. &nbsp;I talk to her every single day, sometimes for hours on and off. &nbsp;I know more about her, and she about me, than anyone except for my husband. &nbsp;I supported her through the illness and death of her mother last year. &nbsp;She makes me laugh every day and my life would be so much less colourful and fun without her. &nbsp;We have never met in person. &nbsp;<div><br></div><div>At the end of February she is flying from London to stay with me for nine days. &nbsp;I am so excited! &nbsp;I hope my girls make as many wonderful friends online as I have, all over the world. &nbsp;Not being restricted to who lives near you geographically is a wonderful, freeing thing. &nbsp;</div></div>

      This has bothered me again in a whole new way:<br>
<br>
-=-Why would you encourage a child to make friends online? That&#39;s not real interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real interaction. Your kid is not a robot.-=-<br>
<br>
I&#39;m quite tired of parents who insult children for things the parents themselves are doing.<br>
Parents (usually moms) will go online to rant and rave about how bad it is for kids to be online.<br>
Parents (usually moms) will write at length about the evils of &quot;screentime,&quot; while spending that time NOT with their children.<br>
<br>
Hypocrisy should be an embarrassment.  Did the person who wrote &quot;That&#39;s not real interaction.... I find the while idea disturbing. Kids need real interaction. Your kid is not a robot.&quot; even think?<br>
<br>
Thinking is required for unschooling to work well.<br>
<br>
This group was created in November 2001.  It has nothing to do with robots.  There have been over 75,500 messages. Every single one was read by MANY people.  Hundreds of people.  That is real writing, for a real reason.   It has changed the lives of thousands of children over those years.  Readers are engaged, writers are engaged, lives are made better WHEN AND IF the readers are thoughtful, if they read a little and try some of those ideas out in their homes, with their real children.  <br>
<br>
That is real interaction, very locally between mother and child, and very internationally, because people from dozens of countries have written and read here.<br>
<br>
The second-worst thing is joining a group like this to, and using an electronic device to insult the very media.<br>
The worst thing is joining a group that is so intended to support children and relationships, and to so casually disregard children and relationships.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167427140"><html><head></head><div>I&#39;ve been realizing recently that online communication &amp; friendships are easier &amp; more comfortable for me than being face to face with people. I like the breathing room that it gives me. I&#39;ve been feeling like I can be more myself then I have ever felt comfortable with before.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One example- I have only 1 sibling and I love him but I find him extremely difficult to talk to. He and his wife (who is Japanese &amp; also not easy to talk to) have spent 3-4 weeks in a camper on our property for the past 3 years. They live in Japan presently but his wife is required to spend a month in the US each year to maintain her status as a permanent resident alien. It has been a bit of a challenge as they are SO hard to talk to. Recently my brother &amp; I have both become more active on Facebook &amp; have been talking to each other. It is amazing how much more comfortable it seems to be for both of us to communicate through that buffer! We are able to share interesting things &amp; ideas with each other and he sees pictures of my kids &amp; what we are up to. It feels nice and I think that we are forming the basis for a new relationship. My hope is that if they come to stay this summer it will be more natural &amp; comfortable for all of us because we have built a closer connection to each other - from across the ocean!</div><div>-Cass<br><br>Sent from my iPhone</div><div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> On Jan 31, 2015, at 9:40 AM, &quot;BRIAN POLIKOWSKY <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:polykowholsteins@...">polykowholsteins@...</a> [AlwaysLearning]&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></span></blockquote></div><blockquote type="cite"><div>

Historically, once &quot;the post&quot; was created and letters were carried internationally, there have been long-distance friendships, more documented among intellectuals than other groups but probably there were many among people who were never famous enough for us to know.   Some had to do with research, when in the 19th century a lot of research was done by wealthy amateurs who had great houses and room to collect eggs, bird&#39;s nests, dead beetles and wasps—whatever it might have been.  Some were chess games between people in England and India, or other colonial &quot;outposts&quot; and people back home (of whatever nation).  Sometimes it was political discussion, or financial dealings.  <br clear="none">

Nowadays, these exchanges happen instantly, and information put online can be available to millions of people at once.  <br clear="none">

There&#39;s a lovely book called &quot;Can Any Mother Help Me?&quot; (Jenna Bailey) which is about the Cooperative Correspondence Club in the UK. It was effectively a private magazine written by a club of mothers across the country, each writing something for each issue and then posting it between them (no photocopiers back in 1935, when it started!). Some of them met, some of them I think never did, but they certainly built lasting friendships. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Can-Any-Mother-Help-Me/dp/0571282172">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Can-Any-Mother-Help-Me/dp/0571282172</a> It&#39;s a bit like a very slow Facebook group, or message board/forum, or mailing list, or any of the other much faster options we have now. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to answer the question about online friendships, but find it difficult because I find it very hard to disentangle online from &#39;real life&#39; friendships. I engage online with most of my friends, in various different places. Some of them I might have first &#39;met&#39; online and met in person later; some the other way around. I find it hard to remember. Which in itself is an answer to the question, I suppose. I&#39;ve gained a huge amount from online friendships since becoming a parent; I can have far more thoughtful discussions online, where we can all take time when we have it, than in person when running after toddlers. And some of my most thoughtful parent friends live miles away and I can see them maybe once a year at a camping meetup. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679638476">I met Jill Palmer online in Sandra&#39;s Wednesday chats. I met her in person at Always Learning Live. Her family stayed at my house and we toured San Francisco and Burlingame after the HSC conference two years ago. Her daughter, Addi stayed with us for six weeks last winter. Jill and I talked briefly about ways to see each other this year when I couldn&#39;t come to Always Learning in December. Our relationship has continued to grow over the years through conversations online.<br><br>I met Sandra in person for the first time at the HSC conference, but I bet she doesn&#39;t remember. :-) It was after her talk Partnerships In The Family. I bought her book and asked her if she would sign it. She was reluctant because she didn&#39;t want it to be something so special that I would be too gentle with it or not loan it out. I wish I had remembered to show it to her she came to have dinner at my house with Keith and Kirby. Or the other time when she stayed with my family before the HSC conference with Holly and we toured san Francisco.&nbsp;<br><br>I met Pam Sorooshian online, here at Always Learning. She met Austin (my son) at the Good Vibrations conference in San Diego. He made a lasting impression on her.&nbsp;<span style="line-height:18.0555553436279px;">Austin got a chance to play Settlers of Cattan with Pam, Roya, Robyn Coburn and Erika Davis at the Free To Be Conference in Arizona last year. He listed it as one of his top favorite experiences from the conference. The other one was when he and Jeff Sabo (I knew him from his blog) had a long conversation at dinner one night.</span><div><br>There are many people on this list I have online friendships with. Some I have met briefly in person, some I may never meet, but they are still very real friendships even without that face to face interaction.<br><br>Lisa Jonick and I have met. We&#39;ve only had a couple brief interactions with each other at conferences. Our online conversations have gone very deep about love, life, family, and parenting. We didn&#39;t need a lot of face time for those conversations to happen. We have shared interests and like each other.<br><br>This was a 100% online interaction between Lisa and I. I didn&#39;t need to see her face in person or hear her voice on the phone for it to happen and leave a lasting, sweet memory for me.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank"

It was the moms on this group who gave me the courage to drive her up there. Sort of -- it started with a cosplay event that Alex wanted to attend and I didn&#39;t think too hard about whether or not it was okay to drive up her up a public park in another state and hang out in the parking lot with my book for a few hours (leaving and coming back would have taken more effort and it was no hardship to stay put since I had something really good to read and my sons were happy at home with their dad.)<br><br>It was when she wanted to go up again and spend the weekend that I started to remind myself of how many times on this list I&#39;d read about kids going to spend time with friends they&#39;d met online. I was driving my daughter, not sending her on a plane. If something went wrong, I was only a hundred miles away. (Don&#39;t get me wrong -- that two hour drive seems HUGE if there&#39;s a problem, but after three or four of these weekends there&#39;s never been any need for me to rush up there and at this point I&#39;m not expecting one.) &nbsp;I think my husband was more worried about how awful it looked to the other girl&#39;s parents for us to drive up and leave our kid with someone she&#39;d met on the internet and then seen in a park than about anything actually happening. By the time we had the discussion, I&#39;d had plenty of time to decide that meeting online and hanging out with in the park wasn&#39;t any worse than &quot;met at a homeschool function&quot; or &quot;taken a couple of karate classes with.&quot; &nbsp;Neither of those implies any kind of safety.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><br></font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f">The girl my daughter is hanging out with attends public school.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400345589">-=-He is excited and inspired, and very grateful that my 12 yr old son is his friend.-=-<br/>
In school, a 12 year old would hardly be allowed to speak to someone 15.  If the other kids didn&#39;t hoot them down about it, the teachers would probably try to prevent it.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was 15 (maybe 14), he talked some married friends in their 20&#39;s out of a separation and possible divorce.  They stayed together.  (I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re still together, but not many kids that age get a chance to be listed to seriously, by adults, about life-changing situations.   He knew them from the gaming shop where he worked so it&#39;s not an online-friendship story, but it IS a story of unschooling opportunity.  He would have have had that job if he hadn&#39;t had so much time to volunteer to help out at the gaming shop when he was younger, and to be there when they needed him in later years.<br/>
<br/>
Very powerful, Janine:<br/>
-=-What can possibly be &#39;disturbing&#39; about this wonderful medium that has allowed my son to help his online friend (whom he would never have met otherwise) to be stronger and more courageous about how he wants his life to be, and my son getting, through his friend, the experience of what many many young people must be going through everyday with peer pressure and that awful feeling of being so controlled daily, and of wasting their time at school....-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327211651">-=- If not for all my (apparently fictional?) online interactions with other unschoolers - most of whom I&#39;ve never met - I wouldn&#39;t even BE an unschooler. Or at least not a successful one. Is that not real enough? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty big deal. :-)<br/>
And I&#39;ve been able to see lots of unschooling families in their own homes, so I have voices and faces to go with so many of the stories I&#39;ve read.  Many have seen me at my home (though now that the kids are gone it&#39;s unnaturally quiet, and safer around the floor. :-) )<br/>
<br/>
Even without &quot;making friends,&quot; people can learn, ask, see, hear, cook, repair from things they see on webpages and youtube videos.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Alex (not sure where she wrote it) that I wouldn&#39;t mind a bit being born these days, to have more years with the modern world.   <br/>

<br/>
Kirby was 15 and in a late-night anime club with adult friends.  They took him to Nan Desu Kan in Denver three years.  That third year, he met a small group of kids who were ALL HIS AGE! he reported excitedly, when he got home, and all went to the same high school. <br/>
<br/>
People who went to school will only smile at that, but it was the first time in Kirby&#39;s life that he had been with a group of kids based solely on age. :-)   So they invited him up to spend a weekend, and he wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Marty and I found other friends to stay with, dropped him off, and picked him up Sunday afternoon.  He was much less impressed with them after seeing them in their normal environment (even without the school itself), but he was polite and courteous.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was probably 13 when a girl he knew in an online game (a dozen years ago, way before you could see photos of people as easily as can be done now) asked to meet him, at the local mall.  Turned out they were both in Albuquerque.  I was willing to drive him and hang out.  He came up with another plan.  He took three friends, and she took three friends, so they were hanging out in a group instead of just two people.  Good idea, Marty!!  And I left them a couple of hours and then went back.    <br/>
<br/>
It was not a good match, but because of the other kids, it wasn&#39;t very awkward and everyone still had fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618322234">-=-I met Sandra Dodd online - she and other people on this forum have given me so much real support and guidance in the last five years.<br/>
Sandra even came to stay with us in Cairns, Australia last year. That was a sweet manifestation in real space/time of an online friendship.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I got to stay in a beautiful older Australian house and learn about the local architecture, and meet a very sweet family (and then some other families, and an even older house later.)  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Even if I hadn&#39;t been able to travel, the communications online were good.  Still are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328011726"><p dir="ltr">I am a robot. Beep.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My family just came back from a fun weekend meeting up with other unschoolers who I only know because of this list. Because of this list, I joined the unschooling-gamers yahoo group. I knew it was legit because Alex P. was active there. :)</p>
<p dir="ltr">When my family was poised to go to Minecon in 2013 and my husband wasn&#39;t able to go because of work, I reached out on unschooling-gamers and found someone who needed a ticket, and made a new friend. This mom and I teamed up to show our three kids the best time we could, and that was a very good time indeed. We didn&#39;t wind up becoming close friends, but I have nothing but fond memories of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The unschooling-gamers list also allowed us to meet up with other list members who were at Minecon, and we all met up at a Dave and Busters, which was a highlight in itself. Then, one of the moms invited us back to her home so we could attend her park day. We did and had a great time. We&#39;ve visited this family, and seen others they&#39;ve introduced us to, several times since then. Including this past weekend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every step of the chain of events above involves online communications. The chain of trust that let a mom who had met me five minutes before invite me to stay in her home the next day started on this list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have made amazing friendships online, but most especially starting from this list.</p></div>
