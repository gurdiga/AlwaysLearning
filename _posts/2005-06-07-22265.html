<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459671744"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;What&#39;s important to  one person might be exactly<br/>
&gt;everything school teaches (because the person&#39;s  <br/>
&gt;intelligences are mathematical and verbal, and the<br/>
&gt;person&#39;s personality is  conservative and<br/>
&gt;conforming).  <br/>
&gt;Sandra Dodd<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking the same thing, as in defining what&#39;s<br/>
important is totally subjective and so forth.  The<br/>
words you used above however put me in mind of my<br/>
sister in law, who loved school, is always preplexed<br/>
and defensive of my beliefs regarding institutional<br/>
shooling, has a teaching degree (although she is<br/>
currently at home raising her two youngest toddlers)<br/>
and is often singing the praises of her older<br/>
children&#39;s academic achievments.  Her oldest daughter<br/>
is in a special school for the &quot;gifted.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My sister in law skipped 2 grades in school and<br/>
graduated with top honors from highschool.  I can see<br/>
how someone who fits the system so completely and is<br/>
naturally conservative and conforming to authroities<br/>
could be genuinely shocked and confused by a stance<br/>
like mine, so diametrically opposed to that same<br/>
system.  <br/>
