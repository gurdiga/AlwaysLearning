<div id="ygrps-yiv-183225913">This came in e-mail, and it sparked up something I&#39;ve been angsty  <br/>
about since yesterday, so I can make a set of them.  The first is of  <br/>
a girl who went to school voluntarily, and might come back soon, but  <br/>
the mom&#39;s thoughts about the first grading period:<br/>
<br/>
-=-She has 2 A&#39;s, a B and a C (not that I care, but not bad for a kid  <br/>
that&#39;s never done &quot;school work&quot; before).  But I found I had to tell  <br/>
myself not to care.  Not because I think the grades reflect anything  <br/>
but because I wanted to validate that unschooling worked (yuck...that  <br/>
was/is a hard feeling to fight...my own ego).-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m supposed to be writing an article for a German parenting  <br/>
newsletter about how my kids learned higher math.  The article is  <br/>
half written and it&#39;s bugging the heck out of me.  My answers won&#39;t  <br/>
be what they want.  I hope they don&#39;t get what they want, honestly.   <br/>
But I do want to finish my article.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s bothering me about it the most is that I&#39;m procrastinating and  <br/>
stalling and feeling bad about it, while I would really like to be  <br/>
working on my webpages.  Those webpages do people good every day.  I  <br/>
like to tweak an  old page to match its  neighbors, check the links,  <br/>
fix a typo, announce the changes at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I really want to do.<br/>
But I took a homework assignment.  And part of it leads to Kirby  <br/>
having gotten the highest test grade when he took a math class, and I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to go there.  I do, but I don&#39;t.  What if he had gotten a  <br/>
low grade or an average grade?  But he didn&#39;t.  So...  There it swirls.<br/>
<br/>
My response was<br/>
-=-I understand this well, and I don&#39;t think you should feel guilty.   <br/>
I&#39;ll take this quote without names to the list and you can claim it  <br/>
or leave it anonymous, as you wish.-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925147644"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-She has 2 A&#39;s, a B and a C (not that I care, but not bad for a kid<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have kids who started taking some college courses as teenagers. They  <br/>
took classes in things they loved and really really wanted to do -  <br/>
voice, ceramics, computer programming, drama, dance. They got A&#39;s and  <br/>
I was proud and satisfied - but I have to say that in the types of  <br/>
classes they were taking, the A&#39;s came from the fact that my kids were  <br/>
eager to be there and eager to learn, so maybe that they weren&#39;t  <br/>
academic kind of reduced that &quot;ego&quot; factor a bit. Later, first Roya  <br/>
and then Roxana started having goals of getting a college degree and  <br/>
starting taking more academic courses. They still got A&#39;s, and now it  <br/>
was from a combination of their own work ethic and the fact that they  <br/>
were choosing to be there for their own reasons and the fact that they  <br/>
really did already know a lot - they had a really strong foundation of  <br/>
general knowledge in which to place what was in the course material.  <br/>
For example, Roya took a California geography course - we&#39;d traveled  <br/>
all over California - she was intimately familiar with the mountains  <br/>
and deserts and oceans and so on. Oh - and pretty much everything they  <br/>
were being taught in class related in some way to their big passion -  <br/>
musical theater - learning about the Great Depression in an economics  <br/>
or history class? They were thinking about Annie &lt;G&gt;. That might sound  <br/>
silly, but that sense of place and time is valuable and is very very  <br/>
difficult for people to achieve when studying textbook history.<br/>
<br/>
So - they&#39;ve gotten good grades and two out of three have chosen to go  <br/>
to college and I could be just bragging here for the sake of my own  <br/>
ego. I worry about it coming across that way when I talk about what my  <br/>
now-grown unschooled kids are doing. But, I think it is good news that  <br/>
it is possible to step into an academic environment and excel, not in  <br/>
spite of unschooling, but because of unschooling. I think there are a  <br/>
zillion high school kids who are channeled into college and have no  <br/>
good reason to be there. As they have their whole schooled lives, they  <br/>
are still dancing a dance that was choreographed by someone else. And  <br/>
it shows. They don&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; it - they don&#39;t &quot;own&quot; it. Some are  <br/>
pressured to do well and they work hard - some of that is completely  <br/>
internalized pressure, but it is still pressure to work hard and get  <br/>
good grades. That is VERY different than having a desire to learn.<br/>
<br/>
When Roya was in her junior year of college she said to me that she  <br/>
wished she could get it across to her college friends that if they&#39;d  <br/>
focus more on learning and less on trying to get good grades that they  <br/>
WOULD get better grades.<br/>

<br/>
IME, this isn&#39;t just an unschooling problem. I see moms do this with<br/>
elimination communication (EC) all the time. And whatever other<br/>
nonmainstream choices the parent is making. You want your child to be a<br/>
prodigy to justify the decision you made, and to use them to fend off the<br/>
naysayers. But the problem there is that you&#39;re using the methodology of the<br/>
paradigm your choice rejected, so it&#39;s an inherently flawed comparison.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken me three kids worth of doing EC to get to the point where I have<br/>
nothing to prove. With my first, when I was most insecure, I was a complete<br/>
(thoroughly annoying) evangelist. Now? I don&#39;t even mention it. It&#39;s just<br/>
what it is. With my first, the number of &quot;catches&quot; and &quot;misses&quot; mattered, so<br/>
I could justify to people why I was doing this offbeat thing. But if that&#39;s<br/>
what matters, there&#39;s no way you can explain to people the benefit of the<br/>
fact that responding to a baby&#39;s cues in this way strengthens the<br/>
communication abilities, and the trust, and the respect, between a parent<br/>
and child. I don&#39;t even keep track now. Aurora lets me know she&#39;s gotta go,<br/>
we head to the potty, and the look on her face, when she&#39;s done what she<br/>
needs to do, is the best and clearest &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;justification&quot; for<br/>
why I do what I do. And I can&#39;t explain that, I just have to show people and<br/>
hope they see what I see. And let go of my need to have them see it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I really want to do.<br/>
&gt; But I took a homework assignment.  And part of it leads to Kirby<br/>
&gt; having gotten the highest test grade when he took a math class, and I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to go there.  I do, but I don&#39;t.  What if he had gotten a<br/>
&gt; low grade or an average grade?  But he didn&#39;t.  So...  There it swirls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted on this list before (and I think it&#39;s on your webpage too,<br/>
Sandra) about Rowan getting thrown out of swim class for swimming. And I<br/>
asked the question, is it wrong to be so proud of your child&#39;s rugged<br/>
iconoclasm?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s this very zen thing... the ego involved in both ends of the<br/>
externally-imposed judgements of &quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot;. Technically, Rowan<br/>
&quot;failed&quot; swim class, and all the other parents were quick to tell me that.<br/>
But I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the only parent who walked out of that place with a<br/>
stronger relationship with my kid when we left than when we started. So my<br/>
success was huge, just not in a place that people traditionally look.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856461259">The original quote was from me about Lydia who is trying school for<br/>
the first time.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;You want your child to be a<br/>
prodigy to justify the decision you made, and to use them to fend off the<br/>
naysayers. But the problem there is that you&#39;re using the methodology<br/>
of the<br/>
paradigm your choice rejected, so it&#39;s an inherently flawed comparison.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting, I don&#39;t want her to be a prodigy, but I see what you&#39;re<br/>
saying...totally.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really care if she gets good grades (unless she cared) but<br/>
there&#39;s that little voice who wants her to do well to prove me right.<br/>
 I realize this isn&#39;t good...I&#39;m just being honest. <br/>
<br/>
 She is my first born and going to a public school that brags about<br/>
their high standardized test scores...yuck.  I just don&#39;t feel these<br/>
feelings about Graham (9) who goes to Montessori part time, for lunch<br/>
and recess (pretty much that&#39;s it).  He&#39;s not being judged, she<br/>
is...and I know I shouldn&#39;t care about their judgments.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And part of it leads to Kirby  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; having gotten the highest test grade when he took a math class, and I  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to go there.  I do, but I don&#39;t.  What if he had gotten a  <br/>
&gt; low grade or an average grade?  But he didn&#39;t.  So...  There it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>swirls.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should go there.  I&#39;m guessing he was there by choice,<br/>
there cause he was interested in the course.  Hence those factors are<br/>
probably why he did so well. <br/>
<br/>
Like Pam said;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But, I think it is good news that<br/>
it is possible to step into an academic environment and excel, not in<br/>
spite of unschooling, but because of unschooling. &gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The one course Lydia is getting a C in is history a subject that I<br/>
found very boring to learn from a textbook.  This teacher has a less<br/>
then interesting approach to history and definitely sticks to the text<br/>
book and has the kids memorize vocab and map facts and things Lydia<br/>
just isn&#39;t interested in.  <br/>
<br/>
So what if Kirby had gotten a low grade or an average grade?  How<br/>
would that change things? <br/>
<br/>
This list has been quite beneficial to me during this school<br/>
experience.  It&#39;s hard not to get caught up in the school think<br/>
mentality at times...like last night at conferences.  UGH...that&#39;s<br/>
another post!  This list keeps me grounded and keeps me on my toes<br/>
trying to make home a place she wants to be at and hopefully come back<br/>
to full time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534957212"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Not because I think the grades reflect anything<br/>
&gt; but because I wanted to validate that unschooling worked<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the problem is the word &quot;worked&quot;. If unschooling works when a  <br/>
child freely follows their interests, is unschooling also &quot;working&quot;  <br/>
when a child gets good grades in a classroom?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to remove the idea from our heads that performing well at  <br/>
classroom learning indicates anything other than performing well at  <br/>
classroom learning.  It doesn&#39;t indicate that kids can take what  <br/>
they&#39;ve learned and apply it to the real world outside of the  <br/>
classroom. (Obviously educators *want* classroom learning to apply to  <br/>
the outside world but they&#39;re hampered by methods that must  <br/>
demonstrate learning is happening.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids are learning through applying while they&#39;re already  <br/>
in the real world. I think what good grades in a classroom for an  <br/>
unschooler indicate is that real world knowledge sometimes transfers  <br/>
to the artificial setting of the classroom. I wouldn&#39;t always expect  <br/>
it to for every unschooled child, though.<br/>
<br/>
If classroom learning is leading kids through the zoo in an orderly  <br/>
fashion, reading all the signs, answering prepared questions and  <br/>
unschooling learning is kids wandering the zoo as their interest  <br/>
draws them, sometimes reading (or being read to), observing,  <br/>
discussing, what are the chances that an unschooled child would be  <br/>
able to answer a teacher&#39;s questions?<br/>
<br/>
I think there we get into a thinking trap. The goal of school is to  <br/>
get as much of the group to a single destination as the teacher can.  <br/>
The goal of school is for all the kids to possess the same knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of unschooling is for kids to grow in their own unique way.  <br/>
The goal isn&#39;t to absorb the same information. There will, though, be  <br/>
some similar information and skills just because life needs it (like  <br/>
addition and reading signs and so on.)<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not useful to make statements about what unschoolers as a  <br/>
group can do in school terms since unschooling is about the  <br/>
individual. *Some* unschoolers interests will have them intersecting  <br/>
with knowledge on a similar time line as kids in school. That doesn&#39;t  <br/>
indicate unschooling is working, though. It just indicates the  <br/>
child&#39;s nonlinear path allowed him to absorb knowledge in a similar  <br/>
order to the schooled kids. But for a child whose path went far  <br/>
afield who has very different knowledge (and can&#39;t apply it in the  <br/>
classroom), it doesn&#39;t indicate anything other than their path was  <br/>
far afield.<br/>

<br/>
Depends on the questions.  We were at a museum display once on the  <br/>
science of sports and sports equipment.  There was a handout for  <br/>
teachers to pick up and use and we picked one up to see what it  <br/>
said.  One of the questions was &quot;What color is the ball on the soccer  <br/>
display&quot; or something totally trivial, just to &quot;see if the kids were  <br/>
paying attention&quot; or something.  The color of the ball had *nothing*  <br/>
to do with sports or physics.  It was busy work.  Kids answering the  <br/>
questions on that form were wasting time they could&#39;ve been using  <br/>
actually learning from the displays. :-)<br/>
