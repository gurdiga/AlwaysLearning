<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073716914"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Wouldn&#39;t it depend more on Washington&#39;s homeschooling<br/>
&gt;laws?  Seems to me if the parents give permission for<br/>
&gt;her to be there, then she&#39;d be a Washingon resident<br/>
&gt;and Nanci would be responsible for her education.<br/>
&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right you are Tia.  Thank you everyone for your advice<br/>
and concern.  I talked with a person who has many many<br/>
years of experience being involved in legal lobbying<br/>
and office holding, as an unschooling parent and<br/>
grandparent.  She told me what our best course of<br/>
action is and I wanted to share it with you all, in<br/>
case anyone could use the information.  <br/>
<br/>
By not enrolling in shcool in CA for the fall and<br/>
informing the school there that she has moved, she<br/>
will remove herself from the California system in the<br/>
most painless manner possible.  Then by moving up here<br/>
and my filing of a Letter of Intent with the state for<br/>
Homeschooling, she will be free of the system up here<br/>
and can make her own choices about what she wants to<br/>
persue.  She said, to be on the safe side, have a<br/>
notarized statement from her parents making me &quot;Legal<br/>
Guardian for the purposes of Education&quot; but that<br/>
frankly, no one every checks those.  Simple,<br/>
thankfully, and very painless. <br/>
<br/>
So she is headed home to pack and take care of some<br/>
things there.  She really feels the need to have some<br/>
closure with her twin sisters, for whom she is the<br/>
primary caretaker.  She has made the VERY difficult<br/>
decision of leaving them behind to persue a life of<br/>
her own, as she cannot truly change their situation or<br/>
parents, and would only hurt herself by staying.  I am<br/>
totally sympathetic to how hard this is for her to do,<br/>
having had a similar situation of losing her when she<br/>
was about the age here sisters are now.  She wants to<br/>
do what I did, and get herself set up to be able to<br/>
have a place for them to come to if/when they can and<br/>
need it, to visit or to live.<br/>
<br/>
So in a month or so I will be making arrangements for<br/>
her to come back up here to stay, and she is so happy,<br/>
because after all summer here, being treated<br/>
respectfully and as an equal, she was dreading going<br/>
home again.  It&#39;s easier to accept horrible realities<br/>
if you don&#39;t really know what you are missing, and<br/>
this is the first year I have been able to wrest her<br/>
away from the rest of the family for the entire<br/>
summer.  Well actually the first year she was ballsy<br/>
enough to say &quot;I&#39;m not coming back, I&#39;m staying here<br/>
with Nanci all summer.&quot;  They grumbled and growled and<br/>
nagged and guilted, but we stood firm, and supported<br/>
each other. I can&#39;t tell you how excited I am to have<br/>
her FINALLY coming to live with us, coming home, as it<br/>
feels to me.<br/>
