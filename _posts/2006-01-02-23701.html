<div id="ygrps-yiv-383229764">Just wondering what kind of input I&#39;d get here. Friends and I were talking about putting <br/>
together puzzles, and someone mentioned how kids should be taught to do the outsides <br/>
first, follow the picture on the box etc. I must admit that we did that with our oldest, and he <br/>

developmental stage that people reach, or do people put puzzles together differently?<br/>
<br/>
Now when my hubby and I do a puzzle, we always spend set-up time turning all the pieces <br/>
over, separate the border pieces, put those together...so if the kids are involved, how should <br/>
we handle it. I mean, it&#39;s an activity that we start, and we&#39;re doing it our way, but when the <br/>
kids come up, they just go at it willy-nilly. So, how do we respect their need to experiment <br/>
with puzzling, when there&#39;s a thousand pieces scattering everywhere? There has to be a spot <br/>
in the middle. What do ya&#39;ll do?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for ideas...</div>

<br/>
Jayn is the person who always instigates the puzzle making. I am the person<br/>
who does most of the work. <br/>
<br/>
I like to start by doing the edges so that is what I do. Last time I started<br/>
a puzzle Jayn very sweetly went through the box looking for edge pieces for<br/>
me. She also particularly likes to find any faces. Usually she ends up<br/>
searching for particular colors, such as the stripes on a shirt or the<br/>
particular flowers or the roof tiles. Whatever seems to be distinctive. She<br/>
plays around putting them together. Then she will generally wander off and<br/>
lose interest until the puzzle is close to being done. She will return to<br/>
put in the last few pieces.<br/>
<br/>
The fastest way I know to DIScourage her involvement in any activity is to<br/>
tell her how to do it - even gently directing her process will cause her to<br/>
just stop and go away. Sometimes not doing that requires a lot of breathing<br/>
and silent self talk on my part.<br/>
<br/>
What is more important? That you and dh get to do the puzzle together, or<br/>
that it be a shared activity? If you and your dh find it too frustrating to<br/>
share the puzzle with your kids and their more anarchic approach, I suggest<br/>
that you get more puzzles so that they can do their own near you. <br/>
<br/>
Just let them do it in their own ways.<br/>

Not everyone puts the border together first.  Some people love to do  <br/>
borders; others prefer going by color.  My sister (the best at  <br/>
puzzles I&#39;ve ever known) has some elaborate sorting by shape that no  <br/>
one understands but her.<br/>
<br/>
If there are going to be rules about working puzzles, life in that  <br/>
family will be smaller and stiffer than it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, how do we respect their need to experiment<br/>

<br/>
Maybe get cardboard flats, or the lids of Xerox boxes, so pieces can  <br/>
be sorted into places other than the table.  Those make work spaces  <br/>
that can be taken aside, or all the blue pieces can be set aside in a  <br/>
box, or something.<br/>
<br/>
Pieces shouldn&#39;t be scattering everywhere; that&#39;s not cool.  I hope  <br/>
it was an exaggeration.<br/>
<br/>
Principles instead of rules might be the key to this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734721434">I tried the &quot; if you put the border together first , it seems easier &quot; way ......At first , I had to walk away if they chose NOT to do it as suggested (before I discoverd this new world of parenting), b/c it was SO hard for me to see them &quot;waste&quot; hours ...(I&#39;m so ashamed) BUT, if I stayed , I would say something negative........ANYway, many puzzles and lots of growing on my part later, One son puts the border together first and the other just runs with whatever piece he sees....and both ways work ;).........<br/>

Sounds as if you have a lot of &quot;shoulds,&quot; &quot;have tos,&quot; &quot;needs to,&quot; and &quot;musts!&quot; &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I try to find edges first, but that&#39;s what&#39;s easiest for me. My son sees puzzle pieces COMPLETELY <br/>
differently! He&#39;ll walk by and see two pieces on opposite sides of the table and snap them together. He <br/>
sees the whole picture and has been able to do that since he was a toddler. I see it in edges and colors. <br/>
Cameron actually sees the puzzle pieces and how they fit together---even when one is upside-down! He just <br/>
has a different way of looking at it.<br/>
 <br/>
We work together: I put the edges together and can figure out colors, but he can just throw 1-2 pieces <br/>
that just fit. We hang on to those until they fit in the bigger picture.<br/>
 <br/>
I never thought he was doing it WRONG though! He just sees it differently. I can&#39;t imagine making him do <br/>
it my way any more than I could imagine doing it his way---IT WON&#39;T WORK! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892968841">I realized the last time the three of us (36/ ds 11/<br/>
dd 14) did a puzzle very differently.  I, too, see an<br/>
image of the &quot;shape&quot; needed to match any gap.  My son<br/>
sees colors.  My daughter is just intense...not<br/>
wanting to leave the puzzle till its done.  I can<br/>
start off thinking I&#39;m looking for a slightly pink<br/>
piece with 3 notches but only find the 3 notches in my<br/>
brain.<br/>
<br/>
I always start with edges, too.  I do find it easier<br/>
to begin.  My son didn&#39;t like doing it that way the<br/>
first puzzle, but did on the second and others we<br/>
tried.  Made him feel he&#39;d accomplished &quot;something&quot;.  <br/>
It&#39;s not a &quot;rule&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986341516">I agree with what you&#39;re saying. However, our problem was with children who weren&#39;t really <br/>
interested in sitting down and putting a puzzle together, but rather exploring the pieces for <br/>
less than a second and then tossing them aside (usually under the table to be lost forever)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra had some good points and good suggestions for our toddlers. And what we did was <br/>
set up our folding table for puzzling, and have our big puzzle on it. It&#39;s right next to our <br/>
dining table. So everyone is welcome to work at the 1000 piece table, but they can do easier <br/>
puzzles at the dining table if they want. At one end of our table is a 40 piece space puzzle, <br/>
and then at the other table are some wood cut-outs, some 20 clifford puzzles, and some <br/>
extra toys. :-) It&#39;s working out wonderfully. Sometimes it just takes someone else saying what <br/>
should be obvious. My husband and I just kind of laughed and did the Homer. (Doh!)<br/>

There are some puzzles with big pieces on one end, medium-sized in  <br/>
the middle, and small ones on the other end.  Genius.  I wish it had  <br/>
been my idea. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Maybe also consider thrift-store puzzles, and throwing them away  <br/>
later, so it doesn&#39;t matter if pieces are lost.<br/>
