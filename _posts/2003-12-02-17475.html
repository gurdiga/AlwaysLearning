<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297414697">That is so awesome!  My son has been in the public school system and two different private schools.  You are right about only thinking about tomorrow.  Kameron was always thinking about how is &quot;this&quot; (what they were learning in class) going to help me be a better person or business owner.  He&#39;s always believed that he was going to be &quot;the boss&quot; and make lots of money!  :-&gt;  He&#39;s a hard worker, inquisitive, excellent work ethic and money management skills.  He&#39;s only nine.  All of his imagianation and idividuality was canstantly being surpressed in his other learning environments.<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t even ben a month that I withdrew him from a private military school.  I am a little scared and it feels good to hear from people who get what I&#39;m trying to do and why!  Yesterday, my neighbor told me that my son actually looked healthier since he&#39;s been home.  He didn&#39;t realize that Kameron has been on several meds that  the school district said that he needed to be on.  Now that he&#39;s off all meds and all of their side effects are diminishing he is better!!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on a confirmation moment!  May we all continue to get them.<br/>

That sounds great!<br/>
 This is really a good time of year to start unschooling.  Between <br/>
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year&#39;s nobody expects anything to happen except holiday <br/>
festivity-stuff, and so EASILY five or six weeks of deschooling can happen <br/>
without anybody noticing.  And if in January you have ideas of things to do, <br/>
either holing up and watching movies or going out and about, it&#39;s an easy time of <br/>
year for nobody to expect you to &quot;start doing schoolwork now, it&#39;s <br/>
September...&quot; or whatever.<br/>

Television Addiction Is No Mere Metaphor<br/>
By Robert Kubey and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most ironic aspect of the struggle for<br/>
survival is how easily organisms can be harmed by that<br/>
which they desire. The trout is caught by the<br/>
fisherman&#39;s lure, the mouse by cheese. But at least<br/>
those creatures have the excuse that bait and cheese<br/>
look like sustenance. Humans seldom have that<br/>
consolation. The temptations that can disrupt their<br/>
lives are often pure indulgences. No one has to drink<br/>
alcohol, for example. Realizing when a diversion has<br/>
gotten out of control is one of the great challenges<br/>
of life....<br/>

&lt;&lt; Has anyone seen this article?  I found my dh reading<br/>
it yesterday.  I don&#39;t know how he found it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read it just now.  Since it&#39;s from early 2002, it didn&#39;t get too much <br/>
excitement up, or people would have sent it to all of us sooner. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what kept it from being sent around is that it&#39;s pretty even-handed.   <br/>
They say that it could be that those who aren&#39;t big into social activities and <br/>
sports are watching TV because of that, and that the TV isn&#39;t causing their <br/>
lack of outside activities.<br/>
<br/>
I was interested in their discussion of cold-turkey studies, where  families <br/>
are persuaded or paid to turn the TV off for a set amount of time and then <br/>
they&#39;re interviewed to see how it&#39;s going.  Some reported not getting along as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
My guess on that was that ONE person (the mom probably) had agreed to this <br/>
study and the dad and kids weren&#39;t in on the decision.  That&#39;s pretty much <br/>
something to fight about.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of families just didn&#39;t make it to the end of the study period.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that as failure.  I see them saying that their right to watch a <br/>
movie is more important to their life that day than being guinea pigs in <br/>
someone&#39;s study which is using their real life/time/emotion/input as scientific data <br/>
regardless of the comfort or convenience to the family.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it presented thoughts and suggestions and ideas, but not <br/>
conclusions, which is fine.   It was kind of a chat about whether tv can be addictive, <br/>
and said &quot;kinda yes, and kinda no,&quot; and that there were scientists who were <br/>
unwilling to consider it as an addiction.<br/>
<br/>
Weird article, in a way, and too long to read if people don&#39;t just feel like <br/>
reading it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876133930">I think addition to anything has something to do with something lacking<br/>
spiritually, and I think TV addition is no different.  What is neat is that<br/>
when I was attempting to vegetate on TV last night I saw a little bit(I<br/>
couldn&#39;t watch the whole ting because it was too deep) of a Deepak Chopra<br/>
program in which he said that, too(not about TV, just the addiction part)!<br/>
