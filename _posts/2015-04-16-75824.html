<div id="ygrps-yiv-425051986">It&#39;s been a long time since I first visited the group so before I get to my questions (or plea for help) I&#39;ll give a little background. I have twin girls that have always been at home. I first tried to homeschool them more traditionally until they were about 9. Then I realized that was destroying them and us. It was creating a bad relationship between them and myself especially because I was always the bad guy forcing work. I discovered unschooling and jumped more or less right in. We met some great unschool families, and I saw these wonderful kids of all ages that loved life, were involved in so many things, and whose families enjoyed each other. I dropped all types of traditional work and just lived. <br><br>Fast forward and here we are. They are now almost 15. I&#39;m divorced with a husband who believes their education is neglected because they aren&#39;t &quot;up to school standards.&quot; I am not nearly as comfortable with unschooling now that the big, scary future is right around the corner. They have picked up my fear and are upset that I neglected their education because they are &quot;stupid.&quot; (Their words not mine.) One of my fears comes from the fact that they have never gotten interested in life as I thought they would. I think for unschooling to work they have to be curious about life and develop interests. <br><br>I know this sounds really harsh on my kids, but I&#39;m not thinking that way. I am more harsh on myself because I think I must have done something wrong. On the right side, I have the open relationship that I have always hoped to have. They come to me and talk to me about so many things that most &quot;normal&quot; teens would hide from their parents. <br><br>Since my divorce turned ugly and their father has threatened to take me back to court to force them to go to highschool, I&#39;ve become even more afraid. They aren&#39;t up to highschool standards, and I&#39;m afraid of what putting them in school will do to them. So I&#39;ve been trying to &quot;catch them up&quot; on some of their schooling. In many ways they&#39;ve seemed to thrive more on this than they ever did unschooling. They like having a set amount of work to do each day. They like learning these things (although they take no interest in exploring these things unless I say they have to). They have also began thinking that they want to go to highschool because they can&#39;t see how they can get into college or make a living without highschool and college. <br><br>So I&#39;m asking for ideas on so many things,<br>Is it possible that anyone has advice to calm my own fears? and theirs?<br>Do I have to give up on the idea of unschooling if I&#39;m trying to meet their dad&#39;s requirement for more traditional work?<br>Is there any way to help them develop a curiosity for life and a desire to learn things on their own? <br>(I know they are learning things on their own so I&#39;m speaking more out of my own fear here but, for instance, they will watch vines and tv all day.) How does that prepare them for the future?<br>Is there a way to meet other unschool teens so they can see what is possible?<br>Is there anything to read/watch that I can share with them about nontraditional kids? I don&#39;t want them to give up on it because they are being pounded by peer pressure. <br><br>I am fully looking for eye opening responses about my own thoughts as well. <br>Thanks<br><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-425051986yui-cursor"></span></p></div>

That they, the parents, have not fully understood unschooling, and the amount of attention it requires from the parents.<br><br>You say &quot;they will watch vines and tv all day&quot;. I can&#39;t tell definitively from your post whether you are happy with that, or negative about it, although I think the latter. (?) Plus you have not shared any of their other activities.<br><br>You came to this list for a bit when you first started unschooling and then left, and are now coming back? Is that right? If so, it&#39;s a shame not to have stayed around for the intervening time, not necessarily to post but just to read on a regular basis. You might have already had the answers to most of these questions, that honestly sound like someone new to unschooling, not someone with 6 years at it. It also sounds like you are not as confident in your unschooling that you can be a bulwark for your twins against the critique that they are getting from their Dad.<br><br>However you say have a nice relationship with them, which you may be jeopardizing with all this school pushing. It sounds like if they have to do school at home, they&#39;d rather do it at school. I would advise then that you continue to make your relationship with them your priority. <br><br>&quot;Is there any way to help them develop a curiosity for life and a desire to learn things on their own?&quot;<br><br>On the other hand, I wonder if they are showing apparent interest in the school work you are having them do because what they really are interested in is more connection and time doing something WITH you. <br><br>The goal of unschooling is to partner with our children, NOT expect them to learn things on their own.<br><br>I would also be honest with them, that Dad has concerns. Ask for ideas from them about how they might meet those, and still have the time to enjoy their current activities, whatever those might be - including time to watch tv etc. My 15 year old loves You Tubers, especially Dan and Phil and some of the Beauty Vloggers - make up tutorials and stuff.  I have made it a priority to subscribe to Dan and Phil&#39;s several channels and watch with her, so that when she wants to talk about them, I get what she is saying. Plus they are hilarious.<br><br>They might enjoy some of the online courses, such as things at Khan Academy (free!), which still puts the onus on themselves to work at their own pace, in whatever order they like, and anytime they like - instead of you taking on an authoritarian role. <br><br>But whether they like that idea or not, be ready to spend even more time with them, listening to their interests, being fascinated by their fascinations, and connecting, as their friend and partner.<br><br>As for meeting other teens, there are the annual Not Back to School Camps (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nbtsc.org/">http://nbtsc.org</a> ), the camps in East Tennessee, ARGH, several unschooling conferences around the country (Life is Good, NE Unschooling Conference, Free to Be are three I have been to that have strong teen presence) and often local group camp outs, and groups that often have teen groups too. Other places to meet teens include clubs or events based on their interests. For example, my daughter is interested in Vidcon, a convention about You Tubers.<br><br>OH. It just occurred to me that sometimes immersive TV watching to the exclusion of other things can be a reaction to trauma - like a healing period. It might be that they are reacting to your divorce, which certainly must have been traumatic for them too, with what looks like &quot;not interested in life&quot;. If your marriage relationship was troubled for a long time, that would effect unschooling also. Seen in that light, it is actually part of healing, part of making a safe cocoon of reliability and predictability, a safe escape. Please try to find out what they value in their shows and if you can immerse yourself in them too. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want them to give up on it..&quot;<br><br>Unschooling is not there for its own sake, or for people to unschool at all costs, just so that they can wave a flag for &quot;UNSCHOOLING!&quot; If it is not leading you to a happier lifestyle, then it isn&#39;t.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So important, what Robyn wrote above.<br/>
<br/>
Years back, my phone number was listed in a book (without my permission—a terrible thing someone did) and people would call me, in New Mexico, to ask about homeschooling.  My first question would be whether they were divorced or had hostile in-laws.   If they said yes, I would talk about finding a curriculum they would all agree to.   If they said no, I would suggest they look into unschooling and not buy a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t be done against the will of a biological parent  (one who is local and involved, anyway).  It can&#39;t be done with the presence of grandparents who think it&#39;s criminally neglectful.<br/>
<br/>
So part of the process is doing just what a parent understands, gradually moving toward understanding it in such ways that it takes root and grows and develops in strong and solid ways that show.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent doesn&#39;t REALLY see it happening, either she&#39;s looking for the wrong things, or it&#39;s not happening.  <br/>

That&#39;s not an easy answer, but there&#39;s not an easy answer.  Sorry.<br/>

<br/>
Is unschooling &quot;just living&quot;?<br/>
-=- I dropped all types of traditional work and just lived. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It needs to be extremely rich living, with constant interaction between children and parents.  BOTH parents should be involved with the children.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We met some great unschool families, and I saw these wonderful kids of all ages that loved life, were involved in so many things, and whose families enjoyed each other.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems perhaps that the mom saw kids who loved life (but their lives were different), were involved in many things (but she didn&#39;t find those things for her own children) and whose families enjoyed each other.   Her family, at that point, was not happy.  [-=-I realized that was destroying them and us. It was creating a bad relationship between them and myself especially because I was always the bad guy forcing work.-=-]<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not enough to stop forcing work.  That needs to be replaced with joyful, busy, interesting OTHER kinds of activities and life and conversations.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Fast forward and here we are. They are now almost 15.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The problems occurred in the five or six years that were &quot;fast forwarded&quot; through.  Something wasn&#39;t done.  Lots of things weren&#39;t done.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone whose children are young or who&#39;s new to unschooling, before getting too far from these thoughts, PLEASE consider this:<br/>

and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spouses">http://sandradodd.com/spouses</a><br/>
<br/>
Take care of your children by taking care of your marriage.  Divorce is nearly always the end of unschooling.  Unschooling is sometimes the beginning of a gloriously improved and solidified marriage.  What is done around the parental relationships is crucial.    Yes there are step families unschooling, and yes there are (a few) divorced parents unschooling, but they don&#39;t have it smooth or easy.<br/>
<br/>
When the biological parents are together and they both want to unschool and they do it well enough that the grandparents back down (or support them), THEN unschooling is optimal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One of my fears comes from the fact that they have never gotten interested in life as I thought they would. I think for unschooling to work they have to be curious about life and develop interests.-=-<br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to work, the parents need to be curious about life, and joyful about life. They need to smile and be  tour guides for the children.  They need to present and introduce the world of ideas and places and people and things, history, music, movies, plants, animals, inventions.... because they know more about those things than their children do, at first, and because they can transport their children (physically, emotionally, somehow) to other places.  <br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to work, the parents need to develop interests.  They should have hobbies or collections (of ideas, at least, or songs, or words or jokes).<br/>
<br/>
-=-One of my fears comes from the fact that they have never gotten interested in life as I thought they would.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The parents should be interested in life.  In life outside themselves.  In their own lives. In their family&#39;s life. In their children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I dropped all types of traditional work and just lived. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just&quot; is not a good word.  &quot;Just&quot; diminishes things, very often.  <br/>
&quot;They&#39;re just playing.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;I was just joking.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m just sayin&#39;...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just living&quot; is apparently not going to do it, then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182365531">-=-So I&#39;m asking for ideas on so many things,<br/>
Is it possible that anyone has advice to calm my own fears? and theirs?<br/>
Do I have to give up on the idea of unschooling if I&#39;m trying to meet their dad&#39;s requirement for more traditional work?<br/>
Is there any way to help them develop a curiosity for life and a desire to learn things on their own? <br/>
(I know they are learning things on their own so I&#39;m speaking more out of my own fear here but, for instance, they will watch vines and tv all day.) How does that prepare them for the future?<br/>
Is there a way to meet other unschool teens so they can see what is possible?<br/>
Is there anything to read/watch that I can share with them about nontraditional kids? I don&#39;t want them to give up on it because they are being pounded by peer pressure. -=-<br/>
______________________<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do I have to give up on the idea of unschooling if I&#39;m trying to meet their dad&#39;s requirement for more traditional work?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
Even if you were rich and hired a divorce lawyer who understood unschooling, if the dad&#39;s against it, and the kids think they&#39;re &quot;stupid&quot; the judge will not say &quot;Sure, keep on unschooling; dad, let that happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And even IF my some crazy fluke a judge did say that, if the kids have visitation with the dad, he can undermine and prevent unschooling&#39;s success by drilling and shaming and quizzing.  <br/>
<br/>
And with divorce sometimes comes re-marriage, or at least dating or relationships.  You might find another partner.  He might find another partner.  The likelihood of getting FOUR adults to understand unschooling when two who had children together couldn&#39;t get it is pretty well nil.<br/>
<br/>
So rather than have your children&#39;s lives subsumed by discussions and arguments about unschooling, after which they will have no high school diploma and they will spend all their time with their dad feeling afraid and ashamed, it might be better to support their going to school.  HELP them with homework.  ENCOURAGE them to take elective classes they will enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
Then there will be more peace overall, whether they&#39;re at your house or their dad&#39;s, and unschooling won&#39;t ruin their lives and yours.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I think this morning.<br/>

If the kids and the mom do persuade the dad to let unschooling proceed, there are ideas here.<br/>
I think the mom should Start OVER.<br/>
Start as though unschooling starts now.  Because for some reason, the first time didn&#39;t really take.<br/>

They must also pass any tests that he comes up with that he believes are grade appropriate in every subject. He wants them taught all the same subjects that they would be taught in school (chemisty, trig, algebra, history, social studies, English,etc). So I&#39;ve set about meeting those guidelines. I enrolled them in Time 4 Learning, and I have been trying to do school type work to get them up to the grade dad believes they should test at.

As a practical point, the attention thing does make me feel guilty. Being a single mom, I don&#39;t have the time or energy that I would like to devote to their interests. I can&#39;t spend hours each day with both of them. I can&#39;t do it on their time table either. I work nights and sleep during the day. I feel guilty every time they say to me that I&#39;m sleeping. It&#39;s like they want me to go without sleep in order to do things with them. Sometimes I do. But I&#39;m not super mom, and I get really grouchy without sleep. I&#39;ve talked to them about switching to a day shift, and they prefer me to stay on this one because then I do have some flexibility to be with them during the day and do things. For instance, they wanted to volunteer at an animal shelter about an hour and a half from home. I was able to drive them, meet the staff and tour the place, then I slept in the car while they worked. I also have my mom around who is a great support as far as getting them to things. <br><br>But on a more practical note, I hear over and over again how the parent must be actively involved and provide full attention. How? How does that look? Does the parent not have a life that they live too? Is it always being on call for the kids? I keep up with what they are watching by talking to them about it because I don&#39;t have the time to sit with them through everything. The same with their time at the barn, I talk about it.

Some of it I find just stupid. I don&#39;t threaten to take it away, but I&#39;m sure they can tell that I&#39;m less than happy with some of it. As for what else they do, they work at a barn (summer may make this more often. It&#39;s been slow during the winter.). They volunteer occasionally for an animal shelter. They would both like to find jobs, but because they aren&#39;t yet legal no one wants to hire them. They do a home school co-op once a week during the school year. They go to concerts that some of their friends have. They ride quads, and play outside during the warmer months. One took an interest in welding but quickly gave it up.

 when she wants to talk about them, I get what she is saying. Plus they 
are hilarious.**<br><br>My girls like them too. But I hadn&#39;t thought of subscribing to them myself. I occasionally watch with them, but that lack of time thing comes up again. BUT you gave me the idea of watching just a few minutes on my lunch/breaks at work. I can keep up with some of it that way. Thanks<br><br><br>**</span><span class="ygrps-yiv-1632490840">Unschooling is 
not there for its own sake, or for people to unschool at all costs, just
 so that they can wave a flag for &quot;UNSCHOOLING!&quot; If it is not leading 
you to a happier lifestyle, then it isn&#39;t. Better to be have happy 
relationships with your kids, with them in school, than to keep them out
 against their will and have friction just because Mom liked the idea of
 being an unschooler.**<br></span><br>That would be another reason that I stopped reading so much. I was becoming attached to the idea of the title rather than what was working best for&nbsp; us. I felt I had to do it a certain way to be doing it right, and I didn&#39;t like being tied to the label. I love the idea of letting them learn what they are interested in at their own pace. They aren&#39;t nearly as comfortable with that now. I think part of it is age, part of it is the family situation and part of it is societal pressure. Whichever way we go from here, it will be because we&#39;ve talked about it and have decided for ourselves. <br><br>Thanks Robyn for such a lengthy thought provoking response.<br><br>&nbsp;<br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1632490840ygroups-quoted">&nbsp;</div></div>

**if the kids have visitation with the dad, he can undermine and prevent 
unschooling&#39;s success by drilling and shaming and quizzing.  **<br>Already to that point. Dad led them into answering a question wrong and then used it in a court situation to say they aren&#39;t learning. <br><br>**So rather than have your children&#39;s lives subsumed by discussions and 
arguments about unschooling, after which they will have no high school 
diploma and they will spend all their time with their dad feeling afraid
 and ashamed, it might be better to support their going to school.  HELP
 them with homework.  ENCOURAGE them to take elective classes they will 
enjoy.**<br><br>I may be talking more to myself here, but if those same kids don&#39;t really want to go to school, how does that help anything? They like being home, having time for the bard and animal shelter. <br><br><br>You are completely accurate in divorce hurting everyone and everything. For those reading that may be struggling in your marriage, I encourage you to read all the resources Sandra posted. I can&#39;t change the past, and really now that my kids are laughing and smiling again, I don&#39;t want to go back, but it was a rough thing to get through, and I don&#39;t think my girls will ever get over the scars that it has and still is forming on them, both&nbsp; physically and psychologically.</div>

But Sandra is totally right. Unschooling isn&#39;t going to work for us. I&#39;ll never have dad on board. But I still want to spread that joy and live a more unschooling life with my girls. I know I&#39;ll always have to meet dad&#39;s stipulations for seeing their learning in a more traditional way. That means either that they will decide to go to high school, or we will have to adopt some curriculum and make the best of it. But I want to still provide them the love and support that unschooling families live and that is what first drew me to unschooling. Making lives rich. I will not be able to do that unschooling them, but that doesn&#39;t mean I still can&#39;t do it.<br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937046283">When you have a relationship that is deeply damaged & inflamed it isn&#39;t going to heal over night. Be clear in your mind about what your goals are (ie a peaceful, happy life for you & your children).  Envision what you want things to be like & really feel inside of yourself how that would be. <br/>
<br/>
 When you feel yourself moving toward anger & frustration - stop yourself for half a second. I used to sometimes yell &quot;stop&quot; in my mind. Take a breath & remember your vision. Let the next breath & thought be something that brings you closer to that vision, not farther away. Make better choices, one by one. Think about them and why you are making that choice. Question what it is within your thinking that is keeping you away from your goals. Try to think creatively & outside the box about the choices you have. <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;choices&quot; link on Sandra&#39;s site would be good to read.</div>
