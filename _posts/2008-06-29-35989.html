<div id="ygrps-yiv-846604354">hello to all.  some of you know me, I&#39;m cris trainor (quinn and<br/>
maddie&#39;s mom, if that helps :), homeschooler of four for a century,<br/>
unschooling for the past 8 years, thanks to Sandra and Kelly Lovejoy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read here (and many other unschooling lists) for decades (seems<br/>
like) but not ever posted.<br/>
<br/>
I am now because I was discussing unschooling with a friend, trying to<br/>
advocate for her kids (not a great idea, but I was sick of hearing her<br/>
rag on them) and not doing a very good job of it.  We both ended up<br/>
frustrated with each other.<br/>
Anyhoo, the next day she posted this quote on her myspace:<br/>
<br/>
We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than<br/>
to consume wealth without producing it.  g b shaw<br/>
<br/>
and I know it was in response to what I was TRYING to get across to<br/>
her, about kids not being obligated to their parents or household<br/>
life, just because they are part of the family; and setting the<br/>
example is more important (and effective) than nagging (which, of<br/>
course, isn&#39;t ever a very good idea!!).<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve been thinking and thinking about writing a piece in response,<br/>
and thought that this list was a good place to ask for responses to<br/>
that specific quote, as it relates to unschooling principles.<br/>
<br/>
Just interested in others&#39; input; whatever you have time and energy for...<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

#1, Shaw is full of unhappy poo.<br/>
<br/>
#2, Was the other mom referring to happiness she was sapping from you  <br/>
or from her kids?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;CONSUME&quot; happiness!?  That makes no sense whatsoever.  When one  <br/>
person (such as that mom) is unhappy, she has not &quot;consumed&quot;  <br/>
happiness.  She has prevented it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When her kids are unhappy, they should (if she has any compassion) be  <br/>
making her unhappy too.<br/>
<br/>
But if her kids are happy and she has their happiness as her own  <br/>
goal, then she should feel ecstatic because she has succeeded as a  <br/>
mother.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079311342">I don&#39;t know if I could come up with a response to this quote without first<br/>
having your friend explain what SHE thinks it means.  My guess is, she<br/>
hasn&#39;t thought it all the way through, especially the part about wealth.<br/>
But then again, she&#39;s your friend, so I don&#39;t really know---maybe she has.<br/>
I&#39;d ask her what she means by that, I guess.<br/>
Sometimes, I&#39;ve found, people like the simplicity of quotes and don&#39;t have a<br/>
clue what they really mean or what the full implications are of believing<br/>
them/aligning themselves with them.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906243131">Can you explain further what you think she meant by the quote?  Do you think that she <br/>
was implying that you were consuming happiness by arguing with her, or that she was <br/>
consuming happiness in trying to coerce her children?  If it&#39;s the second, then no response <br/>
seems necessary, and if it&#39;s the first, then that&#39;s a pretty strong statement of &quot;leave me <br/>
alone,&quot; and I would if it were me.  It doesn&#39;t seem like she&#39;s likely to be very receptive to <br/>
your point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Or is she talking about children who don&#39;t do chores that are consuming happiness?  If the <br/>
answer is door number 3, then I&#39;d still leave it alone, because if, after all the reasons <br/>
you&#39;ve likely expressed about why she shouldn&#39;t rag on her kids, she&#39;s posted that quote, I <br/>
think she&#39;s dug in her heels for the moment.  Maybe just backing off and seeing if the <br/>
seeds will grow might be a better use of your emotional energy.  At some point, she may <br/>
decide she doesn&#39;t like the sound of her own voice and your words will come to mind.  If <br/>
she is a very proud person, it may be hard for her to jump on board right away with you <br/>
watching so closely.<br/>
<br/>
She may need to have a little time for self-examination.  You can always continue to post <br/>
positive things on your blog, even if they don&#39;t reflect a specific answer to this quote--<br/>
because just the tone of loving and appreciating your children for who they are is going to <br/>
nag at her!  She&#39;d probably like to feel that and doesn&#39;t.<br/>
