&lt;&lt; Is there a secret handshake? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, but there&#39;s this neat bumper sticker I saw on several cars :)<br/>
Anne Ohman at the unschooling.com message boards sells it. I got all excited <br/>
when I went to Jacksonville to stay with an unschooler and when they drove up <br/>
there was the sticker!! I knew I&#39;d found friends immedietly.....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, welcome. I probably met you at the conference too but a lot of faces <br/>
are a blur (I was chasing Jalen too much to slow down )<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

Ren, I did meet you briefly.  You set me up with your unschooling friend <br/>
Alice in North Carolina. <br/>
