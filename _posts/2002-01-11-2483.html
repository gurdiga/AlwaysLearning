<div id="ygrps-yiv-187815130">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Decided it was time to ask the group about an issue I&#39;m having with Zak (6)<br/>
and the computer.  He has tons of cd&#39;s, reading, history, languages,<br/>
puzzles, math etc and we recently bought his a &quot;Lego Racers&quot; game.  Now he&#39;s<br/>
always played these other games in moderation.  He&#39;ll play for 1 hour<br/>
sometimes less and then move onto something else... So this is the issue...<br/>
as we are working on being as radical unschoolers as possible he has<br/>
unlimited time to do anything.  Today he spent 5 hours playing Lego<br/>
Racers!!!!... I finally asked him to come to the kitchen at 3pm for some<br/>
pizza with the rest of the family.  He has now gone outside to play with Max<br/>
(2.5) and DH, who worked from home today....<br/>
<br/>
So....the question....  Should I monitor how much time he spends playing the<br/>
Lego Racers program, when I don&#39;t monitor how much time he does anything<br/>
else?  Should I just let him spend all day and night on the computer if he<br/>
wants and see what happens?  I would love some feedback from those of you<br/>
that have had experience with this issue and the rest of you who have<br/>
thoughts about what you would do should this situation arise.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Dawn<br/>

Nick has, on occasion, spent all day....all day...playing a computer game.  <br/>
Goes in phases.  He&#39;s still a literate, insightful, able to converse with <br/>
adults kind of kid ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Now -- if he were playing all day and getting glassy-eyed and whining and not <br/>
eating and being snarky with family members, I&#39;d nudge him to do something <br/>
else to break the mood.  <br/>
<br/>
Depends on your boy and who he is at the moment :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Trust your instincts and how he&#39;s behaving. <br/>

forever.  He may seem like he will, but he won&#39;t.  My kids get new Gameboy<br/>
games, play til you think their eyeballs will bleed and their thumbs fall<br/>
off... and then either complete the game or come up for air.  They&#39;re 11 and<br/>
14 now, and so far have eyes and thumbs and no noticeable ill effects.  They<br/>
are good at monitoring themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I myself have been known to *read* for five hours straight; should someone<br/>
tell me to stop?  I&#39;ve spent even more time than that online... OK, bad<br/>
example &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My opinion is let it run it&#39;s course. When I let mine have unlimited<br/>
computer access they went nuts for about 3 weeks and played non-stop.<br/>
Now they play sometimes. Just like I do.<br/>
How would you feel if you substituted &#39;Math&#39; or &#39;Violin&#39; for computer<br/>
game.....eg. my son spent 5 hours doing math today. if he likes doing it<br/>
and gains pleasure it shouldn&#39;t really matter what it is.<br/>
I&#39;m off to play more games meself. :)<br/>

game.  Lars has always binged on the computer any time we got him a new <br/>
game.  After a week or so, the amount of time spent would gradually drop.<br/>

<br/>
I usually do not respond but I had to let you know that we share a very common experience.  My son is also 6 and was pretty much just like your son before and after he received Lego Racer.  He would wake up at 4:00am with that game on his mind and play for hours on end.   It took him about 2 months to completely master it and these days he has moved on and rarely do I hear that little lego racer tune coming from the computer room.  By the way, have you ever tried to play it yourself?  I have a very difficult time just staying on the track. My opinion is do not interfere because he is being challenged, that is what makes it so fun.  Just let him get it out of his system and then he will move on like my son has.  After all once you win first place every time it becomes a little boring.  Oh-yeah, look out there is also a Lego Racer ll.<br/>
