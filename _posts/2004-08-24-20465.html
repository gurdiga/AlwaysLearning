<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401646514">&quot;The kids love school but it is overwhelming for them and the rest <br/>
of us are currently paying a fairly steep price of dealing with <br/>
overly tired,<br/>
extremely grumpy kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I disagree - Most things that kids truely &quot;Love&quot; wont make them <br/>
overly tired and extremely grumpy, especially this old an age, they <br/>
can communicate with you their needs! (I can remember a 14mos or 2yo <br/>
doing something forever until they figured it out or exhaustion took <br/>
over) In my opinion they&#39;re telling you that it&#39;s NOT WORKING! <br/>
Ask them exactly what it is they &quot;Love&quot; about school - is it being <br/>
with their friends? Could you arrange for them to spend more time <br/>
with other kids if you took them out of school? I doubt it is having <br/>
to sit still, wait in line for everything and do only what they are <br/>
told... etc. Is there something there they don&#39;t want to leave but <br/>
you could get this for them at home? my son &quot;Tried&quot; kindy for a few <br/>
months (at his request, will write more another time) - what did he <br/>
miss most? He wanted the Putt-Putt computer game! So I got it for <br/>
him! If you were to ask him after that if there was anything he <br/>
missed about kindy he will tell you - Nothing! This year when the <br/>
neighbor kids went back - he would have gone to first grade - I <br/>
didn&#39;t even have to ask - he readily expressed his feelings that he <br/>
was glad he didn&#39;t have to go to &quot;School&quot; anymore - although mabye I <br/>
could sneak him into the playground sometime? ( LOL) On second <br/>
thought perhaps not a LOL - I&#39;m realizine that the super big <br/>
playground at the school is OFF LIMITS to students when it&#39;s not <br/>
their 15 minutes of time during the day, you drive by the school and <br/>
see the playground - kindof calling to the child to come and play - <br/>
but the only way the child can play is if they&#39;re enrolled in school <br/>
and then they aren&#39;t allowed to play to their fill - just a little <br/>
taste each day - and then ONLY if they behave &quot;properly&quot; enough for <br/>
the teacher to grant them such a &quot;reward&quot;. It&#39;s like the child <br/>
abductor waving a piece of candy in front of it&#39;s victom&#39;s face, <br/>
encouraging the child to go with them! I think I&#39;m starting to feel <br/>
sick now! I think I will remind my son that I will take him to any <br/>
of the city parks whenever he wants and, of course, he is free to <br/>
play in our own backyard whenever he wants, that perhaps that the <br/>
school playground just has too high of an &quot;admission fee&quot; for us to <br/>
be able to afford it!</div>

<br/>
Here the school playgrounds are open and unlocked, all the ones around where <br/>
we&#39;ve lived.  Some are incorporated half and half with city parks, so kids can <br/>
go to the equipment after hours.<br/>
<br/>
There are things people love that make them tired.   Grumpy isn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
a sign that they&#39;re not having fun, but it might be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442599849">Okey - I think I am seeing your point, I do try to believe what my <br/>
child tells me as well. The schedule could obviously affect <br/>
sleepyness and this is just the beginning of the school year so I do <br/>
agree with what you mentioned about waiting for awhile if their <br/>
words eventually match their mood. I&#39;m alo obviously not trusting <br/>
the parents enough to think that they will do the right thing by the <br/>
child, I know that is something I need to work on, I just see so <br/>
many parents who don&#39;t &quot;do right&quot; by their children sometimes I <br/>
apparently go on the child&#39;s defensive too quickly, obviously there <br/>
is a parent who is trying to do the correct thing by the children in <br/>
this case. Sorry I jumped too quickly on that - I am trying to <br/>
balance my emotions which are definately running wild these days <br/>
with the &quot;back to school&quot; thang. It&#39;s just when a young child&#39;s <br/>
words don&#39;t match their actions it does make me suspicous. As a mom <br/>
who let her child try kindy because he wanted to and we have now <br/>
since delt with many of the side effects of the experience, I <br/>
suppose now I am so &quot;school&quot; scared that I just want to save any <br/>
child from the negative effects of school and from parents who put <br/>
their children there with no chance of them ever getting them out <br/>
(like a jail). But if my child had not have tried school then he may <br/>
perhaps feel like he is &quot;missing out&quot; on something, he wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
his own experiences and reasonings to rely on as to why he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to be in that situation. Perhaps we wouldn&#39;t have had the many <br/>
conversations about what my son wanted to do to solve certain <br/>
situations, for going to &quot;school&quot; so little last year my son <br/>
certainly has &quot;learned&quot; a lot and I&#39;m not talking only the 3 Rs!  <br/>
While my son was in kindy I made some extra money by substituting - <br/>
I do have 3 college degrees one of which is a bachelors of <br/>
education -  frankly subbing was a pretty big eye opener for me as <br/>
well! Another way in which I would have probably not have known what <br/>
was going on. Sure I could think that schools are child friendly <br/>
places and all teachers are caring helpful people, but I got to jump <br/>
into schools as one of them, in place of an absent one of them, <br/>
almost an equal - I did several &quot;class within classes&quot; which were <br/>
continual shockers to me that the children are truely treated that <br/>
poorly by the teachers. I saw many examples of children being yelled <br/>
at and verbally abused (physical abuse was rarer but not <br/>
nonexistant), as well as just frankly being treated with NO respect <br/>
or that their opinions or interests mattered in the least. I <br/>
witnessed second graders being ordered to line up on the second <br/>
block and &quot;at attention&quot; - OOPs too late - No recess for you today <br/>
you better stop behaving like babies, you know better than playing <br/>
like that, if your regular music teacher was here she would make <br/>
sure you weren&#39;t having fun like that! Or a high school student who <br/>
didn&#39;t have his planner had asked to go to the bathroom the teacher <br/>
was going to simply make him &quot;hold it&quot; all period - &quot;It will make <br/>
him learn to be more responsibe&quot; the teacher said - I said &quot;It will <br/>
make him learn not to share his problems with adults&quot; and wrote him <br/>
a pass anyway - Of course that particular school didn&#39;t call me back <br/>
for anothe day as a sub. but I could have cared less! I had a math <br/>
teacher who was screaming at &quot;LD&quot; 9th grader because he <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;getting&quot; a particular concept she was trying to teach - the <br/>
child kept raising his hand and she kept yelling at him that he <br/>
didn&#39;t need to ask any questions that he should be writing down his <br/>
lessons. After watching the interaction for a few minutes I realized <br/>
the student was trying to ask for a piece of paper to try and <br/>
satisfy his raging teacher - I walked over and gave him one and he <br/>
started working after he mouthed me a quick &quot;thank you&quot; the teacher <br/>
glared at me for awhile before picking another student to torture. I <br/>
had this particular teacher&#39;s class one day when she was at a <br/>
conference and converted the problems to $ instead of the way she <br/>
had them written and they made a lot of progress, you could actually <br/>
see them understanding the problems because $ was something that <br/>
they wanted to know how to deal with, I&#39;m not saying it would work <br/>
with all students, etc. but they were making progress, when I <br/>
dropped my suggestion to the teacher in the teacher&#39;s lunchroom the <br/>
next day she said something to me along the lines of &quot;that&#39;s not <br/>
real math - that won&#39;t help them in the real world!&quot; I only <br/>
substituted for the half a year my son went to kindy - only <br/>
occasional days and when my son wanted to go to school which became <br/>
less and less as time went on because he simply didn&#39;t like being <br/>
treated as though his feelings an opinions didn&#39;t matter. But what I <br/>
saw in the schools when I substituted was enough for me to realize <br/>
that schools really arn&#39;t places where kids learn - they&#39;re places <br/>
where kids are housed while their parents work or somewhere they&#39;re <br/>
sent because someone thinks &quot;it&#39;s for their own good&quot;, they&#39;re <br/>
comparable to a factory that turns out &quot;compliant workers&quot; or <br/>
they&#39;re a kindof jail to keep them off of the streets and out of <br/>
grown ups way but they are NOT places where children learn anything <br/>
other than to not think for themselves. If I hadn&#39;t have substituted <br/>
then I wouldn&#39;t have known that things really are THAT BAD, I would <br/>
have possibly thought they weren&#39;t good but now I KNOW.   <br/>
I&#39;m sorry that I have written a book  - obviously I have a problem <br/>
with schools and I will have as long as it is obvious teachers feel <br/>
that it is okey for them to behave in this manner or it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
so universal in all the schools. <br/>

Around here, you can play at the school play grounds anytime school is NOT<br/>

This is so sad.  My kids have always loved going to those big school<br/>
playgrounds.  In our area they are considered &#39;public&#39; meaning anyone can<br/>
use them after school hours.  One time, though, we were passing by before<br/>
school (it was the first week of school in September) and the kids were<br/>
being told no and to get off the equipment and get in line.  One teacher<br/>
took my son&#39;s razer scooter and told him &quot;they are not allowed&quot; and that he<br/>
could get it back from the principal&#39;s office.  He told her he did not go to<br/>
school there but she didn&#39;t believe him.  I had to go retrieve it for him.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181469162">Thanks for your strory - unfortunately it sounds like the norm <br/>
that they did not believe the child!   <br/>
  They make it a point to lock the school yards up here - they lock <br/>
the kids in and lock others out during school playtime as well - I <br/>
agree that they should be public but they derive that to <br/>
mean &quot;public school use only&quot; and not public use like the city <br/>
parks. It&#39;s similar to them locking the school buildings only the <br/>
one entrance right in front of the office is left unlocked during <br/>
school time - to many problems with a student deciding to leave or a <br/>
parent getting in and observing without having an &quot;escort&quot; from the <br/>
office, it happened once about 2 years ago in this district, a <br/>
father came in during school and didn&#39;t sign in with the office upon <br/>
arrival and quietly observed his child&#39;s classroom for a few minutes <br/>
before he was &quot;found out&quot;, apparently he &quot;found out&quot; enough also <br/>
because he immediately withdrew his child from that school and <br/>
enrolled them in a local private school.<br/>
    They say the locks are for the child&#39;s protection - I personally <br/>
think the children need more protection from the school. Even fire <br/>
doors are locked from the inside so a teacher has to unlock them <br/>
before the children can leave the building for a fire drill. An <br/>
older child might be able to pull the lock but what if a small kindy <br/>
or 1st grader was trying to get out in case of a fire? Their <br/>
reasonings are beyond me! <br/>
<br/>
Also :<br/>
If SCHOOL did not exist:<br/>
<br/>
-the minimum work age would be lower -<br/>
 that and the amount of children competing for &quot;adult&quot; jobs were the <br/>
main reasons that the compulsory school laws were created in the <br/>
first place around 100 years ago. Sure a few hopefuls thought they <br/>
were doing it to better the children but the work issue was the <br/>
major reason it passed. <br/>
   Now, not that I think 10 year olds should be working all day in a <br/>
factory but perhaps they could have cound a better solution than <br/>
forcing all 10 year olds to be in a &quot;public school factory&quot; all day <br/>
instead. If you think about it 100 years isn&#39;t that much time sure <br/>
universities and schools have been around for longer than that but <br/>
they&#39;re not compulsory - they were for those who chose to go! (And <br/>
probably had the $ too, nothing is simple.) How has the country <br/>
become so addicted to something that is really such a young <br/>
idea?      <br/>
   Already most believe that it is the way it HAS to be, that you&#39;re <br/>
clearly a law breaker if your child does anything other than public <br/>
school! But I suppose since the USA is only over 200 years old <br/>
itself then half of that time has been spent compulsory schooling, <br/>
it definately seems like another American fundamental thang. But I <br/>
haven&#39;t had much time to research many other countries either, that <br/>
gives me someting interesting to research when I get the time. Moza<br/>

Last summer we went by my old elementary school in<br/>
another state, and I wanted the kids to see it....It<br/>
was July, and about 5:30 in the afternoon, so I<br/>
figured it would be empty.  We wandered onto the<br/>
playground, and there were all these kids playing.  A<br/>
woman swooped down, screeching at us, that people<br/>
weren&#39;t allowed, EVER, in the playground, and that<br/>
this was her daycare group and they had a right to be<br/>
there...I tried to explain my story, but as she had<br/>
seen my husband first she had visions of stalking<br/>
child molesters in her head and wouldn&#39;t listen, so we<br/>
left....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of something.  Last December we were visiting my home town.  I realized that I was explaining everything to my kids in relation to my &quot;school days&quot;.  After I noticed that, I made a conscious effort to say things like, &quot;when I was 10&quot; instead of &quot;when I was in fifth grade&quot;.  Or, &quot;when I was a teenager we used to...&quot; instead of &quot;when I was in high school we used to...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course I attended school as a child, so much of my life did involve school.  But I felt that I was glorifying my school days by telling my kids stories in that way.  Even if the story was about school, by rewording it, I put the focus on the story being about something that happened to ME rather than about school.<br/>
