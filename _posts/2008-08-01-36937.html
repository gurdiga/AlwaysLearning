<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807793229">So, we&#39;ve been unschooling from birth.  I have a 14, 12, 8 and 6yo.  The <br/>
14yo was in Kindie for 3 months before dropping out (we never made him <br/>
go on the occasions he didn&#39;t want to go and he was &quot;falling behind&quot; <br/>
(which was ridiculous to me as it should be impossible to fall behind in <br/>
Kindie, but that is the state of the school system these days and 9 <br/>
years ago)).<br/>
<br/>
We used to live in the US and could visit libraries and take occasional <br/>
classes and interact with other families but we have been living in <br/>
Mexico for over a year now and it just seems to me that the kids are not <br/>
getting exposed like the used to.  We traveled (RV) for 3 years before <br/>
we put down roots in Mexico and they got a lot of culture and history <br/>
that way but this past year they just seem to be stagnating (IMO).  <br/>
They&#39;re not complaining as long as they have unlimited computer and <br/>
internet access.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking that unschooling, the way we&#39;ve always done it, is not <br/>
enriching their lives.  Because I honestly don&#39;t see (and the 12 and 14 <br/>
yo will agree, though they may be telling me what they think I want to <br/>
hear to some degree) that playing Age of Empires and Runescape are <br/>
really opening them to new experiences, ideas and concepts.  And I don&#39;t <br/>
see how it prepares them for the outside world.<br/>
The boys (12 and 14) do not know how to multiply.  They do not know <br/>
fractions or decimals or percents.  Their math is limited to converting <br/>
pesos to dollars and dollars to pesos, which is a skill that is useful, <br/>
and can make change (but I don&#39;t think they could make change in US <br/>
coins and I know the girls have no idea what quarters, dimes and nickels <br/>
are but do know pesos and centavos).  Making change is a HUGE skill and <br/>
I&#39;m glad for that but they are really limited in their mad math skillz.  <br/>
I introduced the concept of opening themselves to new concepts and <br/>
challenging themselves and they both decided they wanted (though I truly <br/>
doubt they would have considered the idea themselves and thought it a <br/>
lovely idea) to do the Teaching Textbooks curriculum and have been doing <br/>
it daily.  They listen to the lesson without complaint and do as much <br/>
work as they decide they need to do.  They seem to be getting <br/>
satisfaction from the exposure to new concepts and self esteem from <br/>
mastering a new skill.  And I see all that as positive.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m thinking of further curriculum.  The girls (8 and 6) are easy - <br/>
they want to work on cursive (I already have books I&#39;ve purchased <br/>
(Spanish) down here that they adore) and math.  So I got some math <br/>
workbooks and have Singapore books coming for them and we&#39;ll do whatever <br/>
they want to do.  Neither girl is reading<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t concern me as the boys learned to read without any <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; or manipulation on my part and I can see the same signs in the <br/>
girls.  The 8yo just started doing inventive spelling, so no worries <br/>
there, though I did purchase some Explode the Code books because I know <br/>
how much they enjoy workbooks and I like to have a variety around for <br/>
them.  I&#39;ve looked into stuff and I&#39;m pretty convinced I&#39;ll buy stuff <br/>
and if nothing else, I&#39;m going to learn about Ancient Cultures and delve <br/>
into Latin (my 14yo expressed a desire to learn Latin) and hone my mad <br/>
writing skilz.<br/>
So my question is how much to push curriculum/learning/academics on <br/>
them?  They have no opportunities here (Mexico) for two reasons, they <br/>
refuse to learn Spanish (and as such are limited to the people they can <br/>
communicate with) and opportunities just don&#39;t exist here for <br/>
homeschooling resources.  The math leads me to believe that very slow <br/>
exposure, supported by confidence built by mastery can only enrich their <br/>
lives but am I convincing myself because I feel &quot;safer&quot; for their <br/>
futures if they can show mastery of society&#39;s accepted skills (3 R&#39;s)?<br/>
I feel like I&#39;ve walked the walk but now that it isn&#39;t so easy and the <br/>
kids are getting older I&#39;m falling for the &quot;unschooling won&#39;t provide a <br/>
good foundation&quot; argument.  I&#39;m mostly talking about the boys here (12 <br/>
and 14) and not the girls (8 and 6).<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas, input?</div>

<br/>
You have come to the wrong list for an answer to that.  If you&#39;re  <br/>
going to use a curriculum and have lessons, do it however you want  <br/>
to, or go to a homeschooling list where people think that&#39;s the way  <br/>
to go.  There must be hundreds of those.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They have no opportunities here (Mexico) for two reasons, they  <br/>
refuse to learn Spanish (and as such are limited to the people they  <br/>
can communicate with) and opportunities just don&#39;t exist here for  <br/>

<br/>
Any possibility of moving to an English speaking place so your kids  <br/>
can learn more easily?  But they have contact with other people on  <br/>
the internet.  Why can&#39;t you find a way to see that as a positive?   <br/>
And I bet those games they&#39;re playing are harder than that textbook.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where to start with explanations about how the skills  <br/>
needed for games are those used in real-world situations.  I&#39;m  <br/>
guessing you haven&#39;t been reading this list, and so I&#39;d be repeating  <br/>
things.  Some is here:<br/>

<br/>
It sounds more to me like you talked the talk in a recitative kind of  <br/>

Where are you hearing that argument?  Not on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling can work in a situation in which the kids&#39;  <br/>
interests aren&#39;t seen as valuable by the parents, or where the  <br/>
parents don&#39;t lead sparkly busy lives that inspire learning.  When  <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t working well, I don&#39;t think the family should claim  <br/>
&quot;unschooling since birth.&quot;  It will discourage those who are reading  <br/>
here trying to decide whether and how they can unschool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137733413">Do you intend to come across as a holier-than-thou and unaccepting?   If <br/>
so, message and sarcasm received loud and clear.  I see by your links <br/>
that you see yourself as some kind of unschooling guru, so perhaps that <br/>
is where your attitude (perceived or not) comes into play.<br/>

learning.  I don&#39;t have to see a certain level of learning to trust my<br/>

My daughter, 17, has no doubt about her ability to research and learn the<br/>
answer to ANYTHING.  My main objection to school, curriculum, tests, etc. is<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve lost confidence in unschooling, you&#39;re listening to the<br/>

&quot;teaching&quot; but you won&#39;t find anyone here to offer that.<br/>
<br/>
I am a lifelong learner, we all are, learning is inescapable, but some of us<br/>
enjoy and nurture it more.  If I had to choose one avenue to satisfy my love<br/>

My advice would be to leave your kids alone and begin learning about<br/>
unschooling.  Instead of looking to question the validity of learning<br/>
naturally, look to question the validity of &quot;education&quot;.  Does it make sense<br/>
to study that which doesn&#39;t capture the attention well enough to trigger<br/>
research?  Does it make sense to have someone tell you that what you are<br/>

time and enthusiasm learning what you won&#39;t need (unless you just enjoy<br/>
learning it)?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754263256">Yes, I understand that unschooling has nothing to do with academics.  We <br/>
have never encouraged the kids to do any academics; my 12yo taught <br/>
himself to read at 10 by playing Runescape, the 8yo and 6yo are still <br/>
not reading and it doesn&#39;t concern me as I have seen all 4 get what the <br/>
need thus far from living life.  Both boys have expressed a desire to go <br/>
to college however, and I see that as problematic for two reasons.  I <br/>
would like to make their entry into college as easy as possible and part <br/>
of that I see as honing mathematics and writing skills.  The second <br/>
problem I see is that college seems to be a desire mainly because <br/>
they&#39;re not exactly sure WHAT to do and know that many kids choose <br/>
college after schooling. <br/>
<br/>
I do see value in doing some type of curriculum as it will allow them to <br/>
decide if the subject interests them, it will allow them to see what <br/>
academics is about (and as such, they might have a greater ability to <br/>
decide if college is indeed their desire) and probably other stuff we <br/>
won&#39;t know until we try. <br/>
<br/>
I worry that we&#39;re aren&#39;t doing enough to provide them what they need to <br/>
be happy and successful in whatever they decide they want to achieve, <br/>
especially since they say they desire to attend college.  If that ends <br/>
up being what they want I would like to facilitate that to my best <br/>
ability.  I also worry that they are stagnating here as they would <br/>
prefer to stay inside all day, avoid outside contact and play on the <br/>
computer.  Well, not all day, because their current schedule is to stay <br/>
up til dawn on the computer and sleep all day.  I&#39;ve talked to them <br/>
about my concerns and they&#39;ve started getting up around 3pm so they can <br/>
at least be with the family during our waking hours and participate in <br/>
our day a bit.  The schedule isn&#39;t really an issue, but it does speak to <br/>
the limitation of their inability to participate in society.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it just boils down to the fact that I don&#39;t think we&#39;re doing <br/>
enough and I&#39;m not exactly sure what it is that we need to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517019087">-=-Do you intend to come across as a holier-than-thou and  <br/>
unaccepting? If<br/>
so, message and sarcasm received loud and clear. I see by your links<br/>
that you see yourself as some kind of unschooling guru, so perhaps that<br/>
is where your attitude (perceived or not) comes into play.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope it feels good for you to see your complaints out on the list.   <br/>
I could&#39;ve just deleted it, but here it is.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you intend to come across as a holier-than-thou and  <br/>
unaccepting? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Discussing curriculum and the failure of parents to understand  <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t the purpose of this list at all.  I didn&#39;t realize  <br/>
you had posted the very day you joined.  It&#39;s never a good idea on  <br/>
any list to do that.  I assumed you had been reading for a while and  <br/>
still asked your questions as you did.<br/>
<br/>
Within the topic of this list, I have no reason to be &quot;accepting&quot; of  <br/>
people claiming to understand unschooling and then telling us it&#39;s  <br/>
not working.  Why would anyone want to spend so many hours for so  <br/>
many years to provide a website and a list for the purpose of  <br/>
providing a platform for discouraging those who want to get better at  <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the list owner, and there are over a thousand people on the  <br/>
list.  It&#39;s a very active list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your perception of me as &quot;some kind of unschooling guru&quot; is  <br/>
affecting your attitude.  The links I gave you were offered freely  <br/>
for the benefit of your children, and maybe for a few hundred on the  <br/>
list who might have followed them too, when they came by.   They&#39;re  <br/>
not all things I wrote at all.    Most of what I sent was written by  <br/>
other people.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to find lists where people will be &quot;accepting,&quot; especially  <br/>
accepting of limiting children and telling them what to do and when  <br/>
and how.  You&#39;ll have no problem if you decide what you want is  <br/>
&quot;acceptance.&quot;<br/>

Someone sent me what&#39;s below the other day.  It&#39;s not from a list I&#39;m  <br/>
on, we&#39;ve had people leave UnschoolingDiscussion (another list I&#39;m  <br/>
on) and I&#39;ve had people leave this one (as you&#39;ve threatened to do),  <br/>
just sure they could do better.  If you need unschooling  <br/>
encouragment, you can get help here or on other unschooling lists.   <br/>
If you don&#39;t need help, you don&#39;t need this list.<br/>
<br/>
The quote below (to the end of this e-mail) was in response to  <br/>
complaints that some people&#39;s advice on another list was too direct  <br/>
(perhaps too holier-than-thou and unaccepting; I didn&#39;t see the  <br/>
complaints outside of this first little quoted bit)<br/>
<br/>
============================================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
aggressive advice/responses are a good way to go for some... but<br/>
some may want a gentler touch.<br/>
<br/>
I once felt like you about the posting style.  I hooked up with<br/>
another dissatisfied newbie unschooler and we started our own kinder,<br/>
gentler unschooling support group.  It didn&#39;t work out the way we<br/>
expected.  At first, we mostly discussed how attacked we felt on the<br/>
more popular lists, this one included.  Once we got past that, the<br/>
group just didn&#39;t really help me toward unschooling.  Instead, we<br/>
coddled one another on the areas where we were having trouble.  We<br/>
justified our excuses for not being able to truly unschool all areas<br/>
of life.  Rather than learning how to confront those monsters that<br/>
kept us at bay from living freely, we stayed in the safe place.  I<br/>
learned that safe place isn&#39;t where I want to be.<br/>
<br/>
I took the seasoned unschoolers advice and learned to look at the<br/>
posts on a non-personal level.  I no longer think the posts are<br/>
aggressive.  The style here is assertive and confident.  Sometimes I<br/>
do disagree with what someone says.  And that&#39;s okay because I can<br/>
mull it over in my mind and try to figure out why I disagree so<br/>
much.  I must say that when I really looked at the things that<br/>
bothered me the most, those were the things that were really keeping<br/>
me from living freely and joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m generally not the type of person that responds well to assertive<br/>
techniques.  I have shed many a tear thinking people just didn&#39;t<br/>
understand me.  But in truth, they did and do understand.  It&#39;s taken<br/>
me years to grow and become more assertive and confident in myself.<br/>
This is exactly why I think unschooling is so great for my children.<br/>
If I hold onto the arbitrary rules and beliefs that didn&#39;t make me<br/>
happy, then I wasn&#39;t allowing my children to be happy either.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that may help is to space out the posts a bit.  If you ask<br/>
a question or participate in a discussion, don&#39;t read all the<br/>
responses at one time.  Read 1 or 2 and think about them before<br/>
reading more or responding.  Maybe even journal your thoughts so you<br/>
can go back and physically view what your mind is processing.<br/>
<br/>
For me, when I really started actively looking into my thought<br/>
processes, I saw that I was feeling disrespected.  I felt like all<br/>
the housework was on my shoulders.  I felt like all the child care<br/>
responsibility was mine.  I felt like I had to be someone different<br/>
to please my husband.  But all of those were distorted perceptions.<br/>
My children didn&#39;t make messes to make me miserable.  They were just<br/>
trying to be happy.  They didn&#39;t want to stay up late because they<br/>
wanted to affect my sleep.  I was too personally involved in<br/>
everything.  Once I really learned to step back and not look at<br/>
everything in my life as something done personally to me, I was able<br/>
to readjust my thinking.  And it&#39;s been like a floodgate lifted.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m rambling on too much now.  I really do understand where you<br/>
are coming from.  I came to unschooling in stages, over the last 4<br/>
years.  I say we&#39;re unschoolers but I&#39;m still not exactly where I<br/>
want to be.  I&#39;m still learning each day along with my children.  It<br/>
has helped me to understand that the concept of unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
really about my children at all.  It&#39;s about changing what I&#39;m<br/>
thinking and how I live.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379090537">I too went through the whole &quot;but what if he decides to go to college&quot;???  Which he does talk about off and on.  Zac is 14 now and I really think that if he chooses to go to college he will pick up the skills he needs at that point and I will stand beside him and help him if he needs or asks me to - in whatever way he needs.  Whether that is hire a tutor, find a tutor if I cannot afford one, pay for extra remedial classes, do his laundry so he has more time to study, etc.; whatever it takes that I can do, I will.<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked at some past posts about strewing for teens - this might help you figure out some things you could do to enrich their lives.  My son spends a huge amount of time on various games.  He currently is happily playing a few computer games.  He also has a Wii system and a Playstation II that he enjoys.  While on the computer he is connecting with other players all over the world.  He says his favorite games are strategy games.  Who knows where this will lead - I don&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
He still loves Lego&#39;s - I invested a lot of money in Lego&#39;s this past spring.  He had not asked for new legos in a couple of years though he did play with what he had off and on.  Then all of a sudden this spring he was creating all over the place and &quot;needed&quot; more.   Who knows where that will lead - maybe he will work for Lego, Lego Land, or a design/construction something or other or perhaps he will go to college and become a structural engineer - or maybe he will have fond memories of Lego&#39;s as an adult and enjoy playing with his child ;)<br/>
<br/>
What if &quot;all&quot; I&#39;m doing is &quot;building&quot; a better future parent?????   I cannot think of anything better actually!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do know it is hard to let go of the fear - but this list has been the best for me/us.  I joined a year ago (last summer) because the doubts were creeping in as my son turned 13 and he was now a teen and it was much easier when he was younger ....... This list helped me over that hump and I&#39;ve relaxed again into the belief that he will learn it when he needs to/wants to.<br/>
<br/>
For example our son being 14 makes me worry sometimes (more like a fleeting thought) when he asks things like &quot;mom, is 2+6, 8?&quot;  To which I answered  &quot;yes&quot;    THEN  the very next day we were at Costco - which is a large wholesale place that sells in multi-packs - Hubby and I were looking at something that was 4 packs of 30 - Zac walked up and said there are 120 in the box.  He did multiplication in his head instantly - didn&#39;t even stop to think about it.   I could have sworn he does not know multiplication ;)<br/>

This shows a lack of understanding right here.<br/>
Unschooling has everything to do with....everything. It&#39;s about<br/>
trusting that humans will learn what they need, when they need it.<br/>
Which might look very academic for some.<br/>

What you were asking though, was not about how to support an<br/>

wonderful she is at what she does - she teaches classes at a kung fu  <br/>
studio and lately has been organizing martial arts demonstrations and  <br/>
classes for young adults with mental disabilities. She&#39;s a very  <br/>
physical person - plays soccer, dances, does a couple of different  <br/>

uncluttered, I guess, with any kind of societal dictates - she&#39;s not  <br/>
filled with &quot;I shoulds.&quot; She&#39;s filled with, &quot;I choose to....&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253698906">JamnKats left the list, but sent me this parting note.  Because  <br/>
others spent energy commenting too, I thought the list should know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I&#39;ve left the list as it was very clear to me that I wasn&#39;t welcome -  <br/>
as you pointed out, the very fact that my son went to Kindie  <br/>
disqualified me.  I have read the past months&#39; worth of posts and  <br/>
others with children in school aren&#39;t treated the same, so why I was  <br/>
immediately labeled &quot;TRAITOR&quot; because my son decided he wanted to go  <br/>
to school and I honored that request I really don&#39;t care to know.<br/>
I have no idea why you are so hostile to someone searching for  <br/>
clarity but it is your playground and you can be anyway you want to be.<br/>
<br/>
We live consentually.  Our children are not coerced.  We live in  <br/>
Mexico because they decided they wanted to live here.  I&#39;m not  <br/>
looking for curriculum discussion - I was looking for clarity.   <br/>
Perhaps I worded my post poorly; I do not know because you very  <br/>
clearly showed me the door.  An assertive style is one thing.   <br/>
Sarcasm and rudeness are quite another.  Apparently there is a  <br/>
laundry list that I did not fit into and I was judged unworthy.<br/>
<br/>
But thanks to my putting words to paper I was able to communicate  <br/>
more effectively with my boys and figure out exactly what they were  <br/>
trying to achieve and what needs they were meeting with the goal of  <br/>
college.  And that is well worth you deciding I don&#39;t deserve a label  <br/>
of &quot;unschooler&quot;.  I don&#39;t really need your label or anyone elses.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
-<br/>
<br/>
No one used the word &quot;TRAITOR.&quot;  Quotes are serious.  Either use the  <br/>
words a person used or don&#39;t use quotation marks.<br/>
<br/>
When someone has already bought curriculum and states the intent to  <br/>
buy more, that IS a curriculum discussion.  It does appear that the  <br/>
author wanted to be &quot;qualified&quot; (says she was disqualified), and not  <br/>
to be a traitor (though no one else used the word), and wanted to be  <br/>
judged worthy and to &quot;deserve&quot; the label of &#39;unschooler.&#39;&quot;  That&#39;s a  <br/>
lot of talk of wanting approval.<br/>
<br/>
It happens often (too often) that people come to this list or others  <br/>
similar to try to get some kind of blessing or approval or &#39;attaboy&#39;  <br/>
about compromising unschooling, or giving up, or quitting.  Just do  <br/>
it or don&#39;t without asking for an okay.  Those who &quot;really don&#39;t need  <br/>
our label or anyone else&#39;s&quot; (or those who say so) seem the most  <br/>
stunned and offended by questions and by people pointing out their  <br/>
inconsistencies.<br/>
<br/>
Is approval by unschoolers like magical leprechaun gold or  <br/>
something?  People will twist and turn and cheat to get it?<br/>

You can have thrown away the math table and still do all the multiplication<br/>
you want to!  No memorization needed, although you can if you want to.  Some<br/>
people can&#39;t memorize things well.  I always figure it out because I can&#39;t<br/>
remember the multiplication table.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76374451">I worry that we&#39;re aren&#39;t doing enough to provide them what they need to be happy and successful in whatever they decide they want to achieve, especially since they say they desire to attend college.  If that ends up being what they want I would like to facilitate that to my best ability.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
Can you do more? Live more exciting, captivating lives?  Help them find outside interests? And what&#39;s wrong with spending lots of time on the computer, especially if that&#39;s the only place they can find english-speaking non-family folks.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I also worry that they are stagnating here as they would prefer to stay inside all day, avoid outside contact and play on the computer.  Well, not all day, because their current schedule is to stay up til dawn on the computer and sleep all day.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Is this because there&#39;s nothing interesting going on outside?  Do they know anyone locally?  Do they have local friends?  You mentioned that the kids &#39;refuse&#39; to learn Spanish -- why?  Was living in Mexico (as ex-pat American, I&#39;m guessing) their choice or yours? Are they happy in Mexico?  If they choose college, will it be in the States or in Mexico?  What kind of launch into a future life can they have in Mexico, especially when they aren&#39;t willing to get out and mingle, learn the language and soak up the culture? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730476132">I&#39;ve seen her post on some other list, I think, when they were still roaming the country and making plans to settle in Mexico (her story and kids&#39; ages sound familiar).  IIt had to be an unschoolers&#39; list, since those are the only kind I belong to.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the kids were &quot;just telling her what she wanted to hear&quot; when they agreed to live in a country where they&#39;re not willing to learn the language.  That alone sounds pretty passive-aggressive to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832300721">Wow.  Unschooling while traveling in an RV and now living in Mexico?  And you don&#39;t see the unschooling opportunities??  My dream is to stick my kids in an RV in 2 years after some bills are paid off, travel the US, Canada, and Mexico in  our RV.  All I can see are hugely limitless possibilities for learning.<br/>
Living in Mexico?  How cool!  Do they not play with other kids?  How can you not learn the language of the country you live in?  Seems like they&#39;d pick up Spanish by osmosis (well, not really osmosis, but by being immersed in it).  And being bilingual is a huge asset.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m not understanding your post, but it seems to me there are so many learning opportunities where you are and I&#39;m not getting why, as an unschooler, you don&#39;t see them?<br/>

&gt; lovely idea) to do the Teaching Textbooks curriculum and have been<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it daily. They listen to the lesson without complaint and do as much<br/>
&gt; work as they decide they need to do. They seem to be getting<br/>
&gt; satisfaction from the exposure to new concepts and self esteem from<br/>
&gt; mastering a new skill. And I see all that as positive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something that I don&#39;t think I will ever truly understand.  The<br/>
idea that if a child seems like they are bored, the parent will decide<br/>
what they think the child needs to make the life more interesting<br/>
without asking the child what they want or need.  People who are<br/>
homeschooling always seem to go straight to more books and paperwork to<br/>
fulfill a kid.  I don&#39;t know of any kid that would choose that over all<br/>
the other infinite choices there are.  I&#39;m sure there may be a few that<br/>
gravitate toward that kind of thing, but very few I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a kid does something without complaint doesn&#39;t mean that it<br/>
is the optimal thing for that kid.  My kids often run errands with me<br/>
without complaint, yet I&#39;d be willing to bet that if they were to choose<br/>
between going to the park or any number of other things and go run<br/>
errands, I&#39;m sure that they&#39;d choose the first option.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So my question is how much to push curriculum/learning/academics on<br/>
&gt; them? They have no opportunities here (Mexico) for two reasons, they<br/>
&gt; refuse to learn Spanish (and as such are limited to the people they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>can<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; communicate with) and opportunities just don&#39;t exist here for<br/>
&gt; homeschooling resources.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s no wonder to me that a kid would refuse to learn spanish while in<br/>
Mexico if the choice is to learn it from a curriculum!  Even I would<br/>
balk at that a little.  Keep dictionaries handy for easy translation. <br/>
Get out and do stuff and translate as you go, like thinking out loud. <br/>
Kids, just like adults will absorb languages if immersed.<br/>
<br/>
  The math leads me to believe that very slow<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; exposure, supported by confidence built by mastery can only enrich<br/>
 </span></blockquote>their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lives but am I convincing myself because I feel &quot;safer&quot; for their<br/>
&gt; futures if they can show mastery of society&#39;s accepted skills (3 R&#39;s)?<br/>
&gt; I feel like I&#39;ve walked the walk but now that it isn&#39;t so easy and the<br/>
&gt; kids are getting older I&#39;m falling for the &quot;unschooling won&#39;t provide<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; good foundation&quot; argument. I&#39;m mostly talking about the boys here (12<br/>
&gt; and 14) and not the girls (8 and 6).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas, input?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would any kid feel confident over the mastery of math?  Math is<br/>
everywhere.  Kids can feel confident in a number of other ways, by doing<br/>
things they love and succeeding in them.  If the need for math hasn&#39;t<br/>
arisen, which is alone is highly suspect, then it will eventually, in<br/>
the way that each individual will need it to get what they want in life.<br/>
<br/>
Although, I didn&#39;t keep the original text here, the poster has mentioned<br/>
that all of the kids are translating peso and dollars which is pretty<br/>
useful and requires mathematics.  Even though the mom isn&#39;t confident<br/>
that this is enough math skill to get along in the world, I&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure that if a kid can do that kind of translation, then they are doing<br/>
other kinds of mathematical skills in their heads as well, especially<br/>
since they play video games.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t get how unschooling wouldn&#39;t provide a good foundation,<br/>
since unschooling IS a foundation, one that is built on helping kids<br/>
find the answers they need when they need them, helping kids grow into<br/>
confident people who know what they want and who they are and are happy<br/>
with that person.<br/>
<br/>
ALL that other stuff is extraneous, it&#39;s a by product of living.  The<br/>
living should be the focus.</div>

children, this is one of the saddest things I&#39;ve ever read... (hence my<br/>
delay in responding)<br/>
We&#39;re *not* in Mexico, because the dream is mine and I&#39;ve yet to fully<br/>
inspire those around me to share in that dream... I continue to share that<br/>
idea and one of these days ::::vbg:::: we&#39;re gonna go because we ALL want to<br/>
or I&#39;ll go as an empty-nester (they still like OLD redheads on those<br/>
telenovelas!). Meanwhile, I slowly work to surround myself with as much<br/>
Mexican culture as Corvallis, OR has to offer (and let me tell ya, it&#39;s WAY<br/>
more than Sioux Falls, SD had) and continue to work on my language skills.<br/>
If I never get there, that&#39;s okay with me, too, the dream of being a famous<br/>
soap star is better than the reality of dragging my family somewhere they<br/>
don&#39;t wanna be!<br/>
I invite Hayden to join my dream and we play with the &quot;what if&quot;s of Life in<br/>
Aguascalientes, Mexico. We imagine our housekeeper (because we could afford<br/>
one there!) and how she&#39;d help him with the basics in the house (how to ask<br/>
for a PB&J or turkey sammich); of gaining confidence by practicing this new<br/>
language with trusted others; of his family&#39;s history as Mexicans in<br/>
Mexico-now-known-as-California & his genetic connection with this vast<br/>
neighbor to the south; imagining us playing at the playground and gleaning<br/>
the rhythm and sound of the language from the children who are just gaining<br/>
command of their native tongue...<br/>
Not once does it come to mind that we would just *sit* and not be exposed to<br/>
the whirly-swirly life around us!<br/>
<br/>
We just moved 1/2 way across the country last October -- the differences<br/>
between SD and OR are so vast, we may as well have moved to a different<br/>
planet with the same language!! As the homebodies we are, we *still* get out<br/>
and venture &#39;round our new town. We love our proximity to the beach and<br/>
seeing mountains everyday is still a fresh surprise! We don&#39;t go anywhere<br/>
without some kind of conversation with the locals... (I&#39;ve even gotten brave<br/>
enough to begin speaking Spanish with the family that owns our neighborhood<br/>
taco joint) I can&#39;t imagine kids missing that....<br/>
<br/>
Mayhap it&#39;s a Tour Guide issue? If mom&#39;s reluctant to have a chat at the<br/>
panderia, who&#39;s showing the kids it&#39;s good to do that and HOW to do that?<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve really reinforced in talking to Hayden about Life in Mexico<br/>
is my responsibility to communicate FOR him until he&#39;s ready to do so<br/>
himself. I&#39;ve empowered him with the thought that Spanish is an easy<br/>
language (in comparison to English and it&#39;s Rules+Exceptions) and he&#39;d be<br/>
able to pick it up in a matter of weeks, conversationally at least!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where they are in the great country of Mexico, but I&#39;d bet<br/>
there are lots of  somethings cool, somewhere nearby where they&#39;d have FUN<br/>
and bring home some supercool Mexican memories!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830649382">I was in Mexico (landed in Mexico City and stayed in Morelia) for a month in<br/>
the early 90s.  Had a Spanish class there in college.  We arrived on Three<br/>
Kings Day with carnival in full swing.  There were kids and cotton candy<br/>
everywhere, mariachi bands, everything.  Despite altitude sickness the<br/>
entire time, really bad hearing, and not feeling confident about my Spanish<br/>
one bit, I had a blast.  Only place I ever had tequila.  I think I talk way<br/>
more than I drink any day, and I really don&#39;t need anything to break ice.<br/>
<br/>
We went place to place, and almost to Guadalahara but ran out of time.  The<br/>
culture is very different from my own, and so interesting.  Unlike the<br/>
States, children go wherever anybody else goes and there is little sense of<br/>
a need to separate family members.  Children were as likely to be in the<br/>
workplace with their parents as not.  We went to a volcano site by burro<br/>
(really skinny ones), and spun our &quot;wheels&quot; (on foot) going to the church at<br/>
the top.  Amazing.  We went to the Pyramids** of Teotihuacan, and climbed to<br/>
the top.  There were people selling things along the way anywhere we went<br/>
but as far as I know we didn&#39;t pay fees to get in and there were no gates to<br/>
speak of when we went sightseeing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to go back.<br/>

Yes, we did end up moving back to the States and my daughter is happy <br/>
to have native English speakers around her but still, it&#39;s <br/>
manageable. And possible.<br/>
<br/>
Are there no expats in your area who speak English? No restaurants <br/>
with workers who speak English? No English-language newspaper or <br/>
local blog or website? No programs for children who speak a language <br/>
other than Spanish? <br/>
<br/>
Do the little ones even care if the children they play with speak <br/>
English? You can communicate a lot with sign language and just <br/>
throwing a ball to someone or sharing digging toys at the park. Also, <br/>
are *you* giving off positive vibes about <br/>
learning a new language? I know when I finally gave up and stopped <br/>
learning Czech (we were in Czech Republic), I noticed that no matter <br/>
how much I tried to keep it to myself, my daughter could still tell <br/>
that I had stopped trying.  Are *you* happy where you live?<br/>

Very true, but many of *those* go home a little closer to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of it is because they&#39;ve had no concrete models (or maybe flesh & <br/>
bone models &lt;g&gt;) to emulate or examine. These online communities are <br/>
great, but actually *seeing* other families interacting is priceless. <br/>
It can be a huge revelation.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you&#39;re not quite on board, conferences can shift your thinking <br/>
just enough to make you a bit more comfortable at home.<br/>
<br/>
Each baby step we take brings us closer and closer to unschooling. A <br/>
conference can be a giant leap in the right direction! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I remember the first conference we went to when I told someone I could  <br/>
probably unschool my son but not my daughter...&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Our family wandered in to a weekend Live and Learn conference five  years ago <br/>
not really knowing much at all about unschooling and when we headed  home on <br/>
Sunday we knew that we wanted what we saw.  Those first  steps definitely took <br/>
place in the conversations with unschooling attendees  and presenters and <br/>
especially in watching the children as well as family  interactions during that <br/>
short time.<br/>
 <br/>
It was certainly life changing for our entire family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010347066">Yes you will find  people  like that in conferences.<br/>
There will also be people new to unschooling who still don&#39;t quite get it and very much and<br/>
just let the kids do whatever without supervision or guidance and most of those kids are not used to so much freedom coming from school.<br/>
I also met some parents that were there and had young kids and were still deciding if they wanted to unschool and wanted to check out the teenagers and were very critical of everything.<br/>
There were some families that had no TV because they think TV is &quot;bad&quot; for kids and regulated their kid&#39;s food not allowing them any &quot;junk&quot; or even a little sugar.<br/>
But there are many wonderful families that get it. Many wonderful kids and fabulous teenagers<br/>
In my family I was the one who had a melt down one day and needed to get out of the game room and my son wanted me to stay ( my mom was going to stay with him while I stepped out for a break from all the stimulation). I had a couple of mom come to try to rescue us. Like Kelly Lovejoy say those are &quot;learningtakes&quot;.<br/>
We had the time of our lives there. My son LOVED it. He had just turned 5 at the time.<br/>
So what I am saying is that there are many different families at the conference. <br/>
 But it is awesome!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve encountered that too.  Our local unschooling list is full of people<br/>
who control food and tv and unschool with school rooms in their houses. <br/>
Not everyone, but for some reason they are the vocal ones.  The woman<br/>
who moderates the list is cool though, I finally did meet her in person<br/>
at the Life is Good Conference, she&#39;s on this list too.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve only met a small handful of people who really unschool, one of<br/>
those families has their kids in a democratic/free school right now.</div>

<br/>
Hmmm...I guess that&#39;s all to be expected.  I imagine that the families<br/>
who&#39;ve taken the time and expense to attend are at least on a path<br/>
towards unschooling. That&#39;s different than people unschooling while<br/>
waiting for curriculum to arrive or before the kids&#39; 8:00 p.m.<br/>
bedtime.   We&#39;re still newbies ourselves as my daughter is 3 and<br/>
though she has been always unschooled, my husband and I are still<br/>
deschooling ourselves.  That&#39;s a process I don&#39;t see us mastering any<br/>
time soon.  Do you ever?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m expecting us to have some rough patches after a long road trip, a<br/>
new environment, and lots of people and other stimulation.  I love<br/>
learningtakes!  They&#39;re not always fun in the moment, but they are<br/>
great for learning.<br/>
