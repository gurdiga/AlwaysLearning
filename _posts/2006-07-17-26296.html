Joyce posted something very cool at UnschoolingDiscussion.  Some of  <br/>
you probably saw it.  Some of you aren&#39;t on that list.  Some of you  <br/>
might have someone ask in the next few day a question kinda like one  <br/>
of these.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My kids have been in public school most of their lives. I would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; like to unschool but when I ask my son what he would like to learn<br/>
&gt; he says I don&#39;t know. If I show him something I think he might be<br/>
&gt; interested in I ask him and again get the I don&#39;t know response.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;How do you get a kid that has been desensitized to learning to get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; excited again?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can send them to Joyce&#39;s extraordinary responses.<br/>
