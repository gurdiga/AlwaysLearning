<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676717573">Well, Sharon, lots of people want to match up with Shawn.  He is now in his <br/>
second long term relationship.  He vowed from an early age that he didn&#39;t <br/>
want to get married or have kids.  He wants to be the &quot;fun&quot; uncle.  He told <br/>
me that he saw what it took to be a good parent, putting the kids first, and <br/>
he has too much of his own life that he wants to concentrate on.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure he&#39;ll outgrow that thinking.  His last girlfriend wanted marriage, and <br/>
kids, but ------ <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He has never responded to the girls that send their #&#39;s to his table, throw <br/>
their numbers into his car during traffic slow-downs, the ones that try to <br/>
pick him up in the grocery store, or such!!!  He is truly an attractive <br/>
person, but luckily not only on the outside.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I am new to this list, and wanted to add my 2 cents<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to this question.  My <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; son, Shawn (aged 27), who learned at home except for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; kindergarten and then <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; college, is a performer.  He was a skateboarder from<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ages 8-14.  When an <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; injury sidelined him he taught himself to juggle,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and took that to a <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; performing stage when he discovered gymnastics.  He<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; was way too old to be <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; starting(about 19), but loved it, and is still<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; teaching it as one of his <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; part-time jobs while he is in school.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; That took him into diving (springboard, and tower),<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; which he is doing at <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; college in PA right now.  He will go to Nationals<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; soon, and we&#39;ll see how he <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; does.  In the meantime he has done a little<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; stuntwork in TV stuff, and had a <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; small part in an African movie, plus modeled.  He<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; went to jr. college here in <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; CA, and now is majoring in acting while on the dive<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; team in PA.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; He got to PA because he was in a dive show at 6<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Flags in Houston, and met a <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; dive coach that knew a coach etc.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Did he ever take classes?  NO-- not until he was old<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; enough to drive himself, <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and pay for them thro exchange work.  Maybe I was a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; lazy mom or maybe they <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; don&#39;t need to start &quot;classes&quot; but can work at<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; learning at their own pace.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; For instance - he learned the juggling with books<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and video, and then <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; regularly went to Balboa Park to join a group that<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; did street performing to <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; practice and learn with them.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I think he retained his natural enthusiam by not<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;having&quot; to do anything.  He <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; could make the choices by being older and being in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; control.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have 3 adult sons....who are all in stable<br/>
relationships.  No grandbabies yet, though. The older<br/>
two say they don&#39;t want be parents now, maybe ever.<br/>
Sigh. Roy, 8, talks about when he is going to be a<br/>
Daddy...hopefully :) that is down the road a bit. The<br/>
youngest older DS hasn&#39;t decided on anything for the<br/>
rest of his life yet (except music). Everything is too<br/>
interesting to eliminate choices.<br/>
<br/>
Are there more females in the general population, just<br/>
now?  My boys had, and still have, those  same<br/>
experiences....with girls and women. The phone#, etc.<br/>
As do  the sons of some of the other parents, here. Or<br/>
maybe it just a dearth of niceness in general? <br/>
<br/>
Do teen girls and young women have similar<br/>
experiences?  Just wondering. <br/>
