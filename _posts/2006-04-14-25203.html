<div id="ygrps-yiv-454830306">&quot;I don&#39;t want this to sound sarcastic because its not, but I don&#39;t see<br/>
how ya&#39;ll have so much time to write these long posts and still spend<br/>
&quot;most?&quot; of your time with your kids and know what they are up to every<br/>
minute, in the next room. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing...I work full time (33 hours per week), find time to post,<br/>
write, do art AND spend almost every moment away from work with my<br/>
children. They are usually happily doing something next to me OR<br/>
asleep when I post OR engaged in something and don&#39;t need me at the<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are pretty happy folks and they get along very well 98% of the<br/>
time. Sierra and Jalen are content to play games together, as are the<br/>
older boys and sometimes they&#39;re all together doing some game or art<br/>
project.<br/>
<br/>
I write fast, I talk fast, I think fast. I&#39;d probably be called<br/>
&quot;hyper&quot; by some.:) I can live with that.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, I got home from work (dh was working on taxes while the kids<br/>
played their own things) fed them, watched Sierra and Jalen battling<br/>
on a video game, chatted with the older boys, then sat down to read<br/>
for a bit. <br/>
I spend about 15-20 minutes in the morning and maybe 1/2 hour at night<br/>
online. My time online is almost always interrupted, I just grab<br/>
minutes here and there. Days off I can sometimes get a little more in,<br/>
but we&#39;re usually too busy hiking, or being with friends or creating<br/>
art or something fun.  I can hear Jalen getting frustrated with the<br/>
game right now...so time to get off.  This post took me about 3<br/>
minutes to write. Oh, I blog too.....<br/>
