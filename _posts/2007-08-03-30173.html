<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003519386">My son(almost 6yo.) has a hard time stopping play fighting and it<br/>
makes dh and papa mad. Dh plays with him like this, Lukas will punch<br/>
and kick but when dh says: okay,that&#39;s enough then stop,Lukas will say<br/>
NO and keep right on fighting until dh is very angry and keeps telling<br/>
him to stop to the point of holding him away from himself and taking<br/>
him away but Lukas just comes right back.I will hold Lukas away from<br/>
dh and tell him to stop and he will say&quot;okay,i will&quot; but goes for him<br/>
again Then dh yells:do ya want a whipping?!<br/>
I have told Lukas what it feels like to daddy when he doesn&#39;t stop, i<br/>
have said daddy loves playing with you but when he wants to stop,you<br/>
need to respect him. If dh yells Lukas runs crying to me and i have<br/>
said..well,you don&#39;t listen.<br/>
I know i can do better.When Lukas is playing with papa he will take<br/>
his eyeglasses even tho papa has told him not to and we told him that<br/>
papa needs them to see. He justs laughs and grabs for them again. I<br/>
want and need more peace,lol<br/>
Lukas wants jump on dh&#39;s back or on him alot of times dh isn&#39;t into<br/>
it.I do acknowledge Lukas&#39; feelings. I also have to think of dh and<br/>
i&#39;m so sick of the stress.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; makes dh and papa mad. Dh plays with him like this, Lukas will punch<br/>

&gt; NO and keep right on fighting &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This whole scenario sounds very familiar. I expect he is &quot;not stopping&quot; <br/>
because he is not done connecting with his Dad.<br/>
<br/>
We found that Jayn at 6 was aggressive in her play when she felt that she <br/>
hadn&#39;t had enough of Daddy&#39;s attention. When this combined with not having <br/>
had much physical activity earlier in the day for whatever reason it go <br/>
quite tough on dh. She really needed the physicality.<br/>
<br/>
It helped my dh to realize that although Jayn seemed to be &quot;attacking&quot; him, <br/>
she really didn&#39;t have it in her to be calmly verbal about wanting his <br/>
individed focus. Once he accepted that Jayn really was trying to give him a <br/>
message as best as *she* knew how in that moment, he was able to &quot;reply&quot; to <br/>
the real message instead of getting cross with her or endlessly trying to <br/>
get her to change and ask for attention with words. That change in his label <br/>
for Jayn&#39;s action (from &quot;attack&quot; to &quot;trying to communicate&quot;) forstalled the <br/>
negative spiral.<br/>
<br/>
We did several things about the &quot;not stopping&quot; issue. The big one was to <br/>
keep on focussing on her, and for dh not to withdraw his attention in an <br/>
offended huff just when she needed him most. Sometimes he would change the <br/>
physicality to be more like holding her so that she could push against him, <br/>
other times he would call me and we would both hold her - not punitively but <br/>
giving her pressure for big movements, and still be protecting ourselves <br/>
from her disorganized flailing. She would become more organized and <br/>
controlled and start directing our physical response eg &quot;now Daddy hold my <br/>
shoulders, Mommy move my feet&quot; until it was much more smiling and we could <br/>
feel her body relax.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing we did was purchase a punching post - inflatable with a <br/>
water filled base for stability - and some gloves. She enjoyed that for a <br/>
while, and then slowly she let it go. Dh also continues to try and do <br/>
physical things with Jayn such as taking her to the park by himself with <br/>
stomp rockets or other outdoor toys. Sometimes he coaches her to do some <br/>
calisthenics or sit ups while he counts, when she is willing and happy to do <br/>
that. She and I do swimming and yoga together, so our physical interaction <br/>
is much more quiet and gentle. When Jayn swims with her father they have <br/>
several diving games they play together, as well as vigorous tossing her <br/>
over the water type games.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn and dh had a special self devised board game that they used to play <br/>
together, without me, a lot. It involved many tiny figures and a piece of <br/>
cardboard with designs drawn on it - and I have no idea how it worked. But I <br/>
think it was just them being together alone that was the key.<br/>
<br/>
I would guess the repeated &quot;contrary&quot; behavior that Lukas is showing you is <br/>
likely a code for &quot;I want more of Daddy&#39;s attention&quot;. I would suggest <br/>
putting the glasses aside and playing instead of repeating information that <br/>
he probably knows by now. His emotional need is overriding his intellectual <br/>
knowledge. The beginning of the wrestling is like the floodgate opening - it <br/>
is very hard to shut it against a rushing flow - but it will slow to a <br/>
trickle if your dh can just persevere in the game without becoming angry.<br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful to have a list of physical games - like ball games, <br/>
running in the hose outside, stomp rockets (we use a hoop as a distant <br/>
target), climbing of some kind, jump rope, you will think of more - on hand <br/>
for your dh to suggest to Lukas at the first sign of restivness. Just <br/>
something that they can do together. If Lukas likes jumping what about a <br/>
small trampoline - your dh could hold his hand while Lukas jumps on it, or <br/>
make up some kind of game where he throws a bean bag or some soft thing to <br/>
him while he jumps - anything that keeps them connected even while Lukas <br/>
expends some of his excess energy.<br/>
<br/>
I have a suspicion that your next post is likely to include the idea that <br/>
your dh is tired after a long day of work and deserves to be able to relax <br/>
;) ..... however I would like to suggest to you and him that using the <br/>
positive energy of engaging in happy play has got to be less draining than <br/>
the habitual conflict, and may even be energizing. One other alternative is <br/>
to have a lot more physical activity for Lukas during the day before Dad <br/>
gets home, BUT then to have  ready and planned some quiet activities for the <br/>
pair of them to connect over. He has to make the mental committment to give <br/>
him that attention if he really expects Lukas to not be demanding it.<br/>
<br/>
It really is astonishing how much more time our children really want from us <br/>
than we think they should!<br/>
