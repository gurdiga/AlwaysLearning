I read that as I Filet probably the first twenty times I saw it. Had no idea <br/>
why you&#39;d call it that but figured it MUST mean something. I felt pretty dumb <br/>
when I finally parsed it out correctly. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Patrick (14 this week) is really into video games. Loves them. Absolutely. In <br/>
addition to owning a Game Cube, Nintendo DS, and half interest in an XBox, <br/>
he&#39;s trying to aquire a complete historic Nintendo hardware collection. He plays <br/>
a LOT of video games, and thinks and reads and writes about them when he&#39;s <br/>
not playing them.<br/>
<br/>
And still, it&#39;s not all he does. <br/>
<br/>
For the last half hour he was picking out Camptown Racers on the electronic <br/>
keyboard. He&#39;s been picking out songs almost every day this week. Thursday <br/>
evening he went to the driving range with his dad, they&#39;re just about ready to <br/>
finally go out for a round. Every day for the last week (month, year) he&#39;s gone <br/>
for a bike ride, at least a mile round trip. Twice this week he was at the <br/>
skate park working on basic skateboarding skills, as well as almost every day on <br/>
our patio. (He&#39;s asked for a GOOD skateboard for his birthday.) Today he was <br/>
out with friends whacking around with the foam swords he made, riding bikes, and <br/>
generally running around together. This week he&#39;s been reading the most <br/>
recent book in the Series of Unfortunate Events, Nintendo Power, GamePro, a book <br/>
about fencing, and a book on WWII tanks that his fencing instructor lent him. He <br/>
just picked up the Muse issue from March 2005 about Pompeii and took it up to <br/>
read while asking me for what else we have around the house on the subject. <br/>
He was awestruck by the recent exhibit at the Field museum in Chicago from the <br/>
excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum, it&#39;s taken a while to want to probe <br/>
further. <br/>
<br/>
His twin sister Sarah is also a gamer (one of her favorite T&#39;s reads &quot;Video <br/>
Games are a Full Time Job&quot;). She owns the other half of that Xbox, as well as a <br/>
Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS. She&#39;s often found on the unschooling gamers <br/>
list talking about the games she loves. But it&#39;s not all of her life. Yup, she <br/>
spent a LOT of time on the computer this week - she started a new SIMS family. <br/>
She also rode her bike 2 miles to the forest preserve to do some nature <br/>
sketching. She wrote a little more for her ongoing artist encouragement series. She <br/>
spent quite a lot of time painting. She read several more chapters in her <br/>
current fantasy novel. She spent hours and hours and HOURS on the phone with her <br/>
best friend who moved 1 1/2 hours away last summer. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve never, ever, only played video games, even on days when they had new, <br/>
wonderful games.<br/>
<br/>
And they&#39;re still pretty smart. :-)<br/>

It looks more like word swords, but that&#39;s FINE.<br/>
<br/>
Ambiguity can be another fun connection. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
