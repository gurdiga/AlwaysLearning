<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636107678">Actually, Buddhism the way Mahatma Guatama first shared did not have any <br/>
deity...hence it&#39;s compatibility with any religion.<br/>
It was not a religion...people evolved it into that.<br/>
It was a path to what is termed &quot;enlightenment&quot;<br/>
I have read a lot of different Buddhist sayings and none of them conflicted <br/>
with Christianity in it&#39;s &quot;purer&quot; form....what Christ taught.<br/>
The Buddha worship part would have Guatama rolling over in his grave I&#39;m <br/>
quite sure!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, speaking of religion...<br/>
I just got back from our local &quot;Firehouse Subs&quot; shop, I can&#39;t seem to do <br/>
normal tasks without thinking of you all.<br/>
We were reading the labels on all of their hot sauces (there&#39;s about a <br/>
jillion) and I came to one labeled &quot;Hellfire and Damnation&quot; and laughed out <br/>
loud...thinking of the topics we have discussed.<br/>
<br/>
We also seem to have secret codes, lines from fave movies.<br/>
&quot;Oh behave&quot; or &quot;Yeeaaah baibay&quot; <br/>
&quot;As you wish&quot; another PB<br/>
&quot;All right then, we&#39;ll call it a draw&quot;<br/>
Besides all the imitations we have around here.....<br/>
<br/>
Hope Hagrid is a convincing likeness Sandra! My kids would love to see him.<br/>
Maybe you could post a pic after?<br/>
How does one post pics anyway? is it at the main menu? I don&#39;t even know how <br/>
to get back to the club because I just get the e-mails.<br/>
Maybe someone could post a link?  Thanks.<br/>

soon as I hit send I remember a jillion things I wanted to say, but don&#39;t<br/>
want to bog down the list anymore than I already do &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
