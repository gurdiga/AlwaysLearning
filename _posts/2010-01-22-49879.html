<div id="ygrps-yiv-466096958">-=I loved this video of Gigi the first time I saw it (a year ago?). I<br/>
just smile through the entire thing!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  I&#39;m glad this note was here, because I came to ask whether  <br/>
there are other videos of unschooling kids or families you think would  <br/>
be good to have in a central location.   If they&#39;re out in public  <br/>
anyway, send a link.  If you have a good one that&#39;s not in public and  <br/>
you&#39;d like for it to be, I could help you upload it if you don&#39;t have  <br/>
a youtube account and don&#39;t want to have one, or if it&#39;s small I could  <br/>
put it on my photobucket.<br/>
<br/>
There was a blog with a video of a teenaged boy juggling and I got  <br/>
permission to use it, but I&#39;ve lost it.   If anyone knows...<br/>
<br/>
There was one of skateboarding, too.   And there was one of some  <br/>
surfing in San Diego...<br/>
