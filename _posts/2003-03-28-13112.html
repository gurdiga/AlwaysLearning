<br/>
Kelly found these.  It might be worth saving them to share with newer <br/>
unschoolers who are afraid of in-your-face unschooling lists.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;m nearly afraid myself!!  Not really, but it&#39;s been really <br/>
interesting that there are four or five (maybe more, I didn&#39;t really count) <br/>
people who have been for a few weeks giving what seem like harsher and more <br/>
extreme answers than I&#39;ve ever given.  I&#39;m used to being the edge, and <br/>
figuring if people got halfway between where they started and where I was <br/>
that would be a lot of motion and progress.  But lately it seems that from <br/>
behind me and over my head people are shouting &quot;HALFWAY SUCKS!  KEEP MOVING <br/>
THIS WAY NOW!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a bad thing, but I can say it&#39;s very, very different. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After however many years of me being sometimes the only voice and usually the <br/>
most challenging (and sometimes irritating) at whichever forum, group, <br/>
conference panel, now I&#39;m feeling the temptation to take a couple of people <br/>
aside and say &quot;Shhh....  wait.  Let them breathe between times!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, mathematically, if I&#39;m not the only person at the <br/>
edge, the average-middle comes closer toward me, and that could make it <br/>
easier for people to get further faster.<br/>

<br/>
That probably wouldn&#39;t hurt. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking lately I&#39;m not patient enough to answer anyone&#39;s questions. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of times I would have just reached out and flicked the noses of<br/>
some folks if I could have. <br/>
That&#39;s not helpful.    Satisfying maybe, but not helpful.  I&#39;m ten times<br/>
more patient than I used to be but I&#39;m still not patient enough.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shhh&quot;  is good advice for me right now.<br/>
<br/>
I never read you as harsh or extreme.   I never read what some of the<br/>
whiners (see what I mean?) read.<br/>
I read straightforward and honest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it depends on how much substance there is given with the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says little more than &quot;What?? You restrict your kids TV??&quot; it<br/>
provides the same information as &quot;What?? You let your kids watch TV all the<br/>
time??&quot; All the information it gives someone is &quot;I am shocked and outraged<br/>
at what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re wrong.&quot; That doesn&#39;t give anyone a pathway from<br/>
where they are to a better place. It doesn&#39;t give any insights into what<br/>
that better place is or why it&#39;s better. It only tells them they aren&#39;t<br/>
where someone else feels is the only good place to be.<br/>
<br/>
But, like your response on HEM-Unschooling, &quot;So you lied to your children,&quot;<br/>
it&#39;s not just startling, it&#39;s truth.<br/>
<br/>
What truth is there in our feelings towards what someone else is doing? From<br/>
their point of view we&#39;re wrong. From our point of view they&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Our feelings don&#39;t enlighten.<br/>
<br/>
But if we can get to the truth that inspires those feelings we can perhaps<br/>
help them see things in a way they couldn&#39;t before.<br/>
