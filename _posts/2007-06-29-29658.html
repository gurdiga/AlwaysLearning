<div id="ygrps-yiv-275945492">Hey everyone. I just wanted to post and let you all know whats been <br/>
going on with us lately. I have to say that I love being part of this <br/>
group, it is so encouraging and informative.<br/>
My son is going through his &quot;binge&quot; stage with tv. Since we have taken <br/>
all the limits off. Its been going on for about 3 months or more now. <br/>
He has found so many cool shows that he likes. Some of his favs are <br/>
Martin Mystery, Kappa Mikey and pretty much anything that is on <br/>
Nickolodeon. He likes it when I sit and watch tv with him and asks <br/>
questions alot about the shows hes watching. I want to thank this <br/>
group for being so helpful with this transition and Sandra your peice <br/>
about the myths of tv was very helpful.<br/>
My daughter watches tv most of the time with her brother but enjoys <br/>
doing workbooks and art sometimes.<br/>
My toddler watches tv too but is usually with me wherever I may be in <br/>
the house.<br/>
I purchased the books that some people on this site recommended - The <br/>
explosive child, the spirited child, how to talk so your kids will <br/>
listen and siblings without rivalry. I am currently spending alot of <br/>
time with the siblings without rivalry one b/c the kids fight alot <br/>
with each other and I want to learn the most positive way to deal with <br/>
it. I know it must be difficult for them having to be together all the <br/>
time so I have started to provide oppurtunities for them to be <br/>
seperated like spending the night at a friends house.<br/>
We also take them out individually and that has made a significant <br/>
difference.<br/>
Last night after I cleaned the kids room I was reading a story to my <br/>
oldest son and my daughter wanted me to read her a story. So I told <br/>
her that I would read hers after I was done with the other. She got <br/>
really upset and pulled all the books off the bottom bookshelf. I said <br/>
that it made me really sad b/c I just cleaned the room. I havent got <br/>
to putting them back yet and she tried to help a little on her own-but <br/>
it is really hard to get all the books back in there. I tried to <br/>
handle that situation in a good way. I wasnt condisending or anything <br/>
like that with my tone-but it really did make me sad cuase I had spent <br/>
all that time cleaning. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I <br/>
couldve handled that differently?<br/>
I went through a little burnout for about a week. It sucked but I <br/>
tried to stay positive through it. I think I did pretty good. <br/>
And my husband seems to be going through a burnout right now. But he <br/>
works outside (in florida) doing glass work so hes up and down ladders <br/>
all day carrying heavy peices of glass in the hot sun.  I think that <br/>
plays alot into it. I try to keep the house cool when he gets home so <br/>
it is comfy here for him.<br/>
I know this is long but I havent posted for awhile and just wanted to <br/>
post a little something. One Love~Tina</div>

<br/>
You said...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; So I told <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something that I have found that works with this type of situation is <br/>
inviting her to join you now and listen to that book...then read <br/>
hers. Sometimes I&#39;m not sure if that will be OK with the child I was <br/>
already doing something with so I throw out a couple of <br/>
suggestions...&quot;How about we all read together OR you grab another <br/>
book and be near by whlie I finish this one with your brother.&quot; There <br/>
are many possibilties!! I find that usually what the &quot;need&quot; is, is to <br/>
be included ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Also about TV...I found that when I *really* let go of my old beliefs <br/>
about it OR anything the process moves more quickly. Just something <br/>
to think about. You sound like your doing great, remember it&#39;s a <br/>
process!<br/>

them. Nothing was working. I felt really bad b/c I wanted to meet <br/>
her needs and just didnt know what to do. But thanks for the <br/>
suggestions. Sorry I forgot to post the other suggestions I made. It <br/>
happened late last night and I was up early this morning!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Focusing on the first part of this rather than the second might help. <br/>
Something powerful was working in her, something bigger than she knew <br/>
how to handle. You mentioned the sibling rivalry (aka insecurity), so <br/>
that might have been it, but I wouldn&#39;t assume anything. At the signs <br/>
of increasing upset, I might have said to your son, &quot;Your sister is <br/>
in a big hurry for some reason. Do you mind if we read her book <br/>
first?&quot; Not all kids would go for it, of course, but many would.<br/>
<br/>
The image of your daughter making an effort to put the books away is <br/>
very moving! What a sweet kid! And she already knows the immortal <br/>
lesson of the Traveling Wilburys:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been uptight and made a mess,<br/>
But I&#39;ll clean it up myself I guess,<br/>
Oh the sweet smell of success,<br/>
Handle me with care.<br/>

That seems like the best of all ideas, or just give up on the book  <br/>
reading altogether and sing a song they both like or know, or go  <br/>
outside and lie down and look at the stars (if you live where that&#39;s  <br/>
