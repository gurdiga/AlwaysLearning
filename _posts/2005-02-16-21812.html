<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136303064">You have a great vision.  I hope for your sake that<br/>
you have the flexibility to allow it to take form as<br/>
the opportunities best present themselves and don&#39;t<br/>
get too attached to your ideal expectations.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re probably aware that what you have described is<br/>
commonly called an Intentional Community, and that<br/>
there is a huge modern international movement to<br/>
create more cooperative village living in various<br/>
forms and scales in many countries, with a focus on<br/>
improving the standard of living for individuals and<br/>
families in both better emotional/psychological health<br/>
and  better financial health and independence.  There<br/>
are also many that are interested in sustainability<br/>
and/or self sufficiency, although not all are.  Some<br/>
are religious, many are not, some share politics or<br/>
diets or lifestyle elements, many others are more<br/>
purposefully diverse.  There are large, village sized<br/>
ones, and others more intimate extended family scale,<br/>
in both rural and urban settings.  Some are based<br/>
around a business, like a retreat center, sustainable<br/>
skills school or a living history center, others are<br/>
just neighborhoods where folks live, share resources<br/>
and gardens and events and such, and sometimes have<br/>
home based businesses.  There is one forming in Maine<br/>
around a celtic fantasy based village/living history<br/>
public attraction idea complete with elves, called<br/>
Dragonvale.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of communities in existence of<br/>
forming similar in parts to what you described in the<br/>
UK now, as well as in the US.  On the off chance that<br/>
you are not already aware of this information, I am<br/>
including a few links for you.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ic.org/">http://www.ic.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://directory.ic.org/records/?action=search_results&locations[">http://directory.ic.org/records/?action=search_results&locations[</a>country]=United%20Kingdom<br/>
The above link is to a listing of the 84 communities<br/>
in the UK who happen to be listed on the Communities<br/>
Directory at the link.  There are likely many more who<br/>
are more private and not listed there, but can be<br/>
found out about once you begin to contact the listed<br/>
communities and folks &quot;in the know&quot; in those areas.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ICfam/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ICfam/</a><br/>
The above link is a mailing list for folks interested<br/>
in, living in, or creating intentional communities<br/>
with a strong focus on families.<br/>

Elves?  People pretending to be elves?  Will they have fairies too?  Leprechauns?<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Living_Your_Dream</a><br/>
<br/>
 We look forward to conversing with you on matters unschooling.  I just want to let you know that we are going to UK Friday 18th and will return back to France on the 24th.  We will  be looking at ways to go back to Uk for a while and keep a property over here.<br/>
<br/>
I have questions to ask specificaly about reading and writing as I as a child read by 5 and was reading adult books by 7 and neither of my 2 ds aged 6 & 8 are reading.  I know that this is not a real problem but just need some conformation from those who have been there and now have older children.<br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Jay<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL, I don&#39;t think so.  I think their idea is a year<br/>
round Ren Faire kind of thing, where they host both<br/>
private events and scheduled regular events, as well<br/>
as maybe camps and such.  A working village (with a<br/>
blacksmith, village square, and Inn/pub, etc) where<br/>
the actors/hosts also live.  They intend to fulfill<br/>
both their sustainable lifestyle dreams, as well as<br/>
create jobs for residents doing something they love,<br/>
as their group are re-enactor types, and including a<br/>
fun magical sort of element with a Tolkienesque<br/>
flavor.  That&#39;s for their guests...they don&#39;t actually<br/>
think that they are elves.  :-P  I believe they have<br/>
their land (a couple hundred acres) and are currently<br/>
living in an apartment building they bought in a<br/>
nearby city.  <br/>

There&#39;s two links on that page to webpages about their community.<br/>

Lots of stories are collected there.  <br/>
I was surprised when my youngest, a girl, was the latest reader, and her story is there (about the advantages of Holly&#39;s late reading).<br/>
