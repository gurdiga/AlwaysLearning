<div id="ygrps-yiv-11675899">It seems silly and wrong for me to need to remind people to read the intro to the list.  I believe (please confirm or clarify if I&#39;m wrong) that each new member receives an e-mail introduction asking them to read the main page.  One thing that page has said for a long time is this:<br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way. New members&#39; posts are moderated, and it&#39;s good to read several dozen posts before jumping in.)<br/>

<br/>
Two members have been let out the hole for rude letters to the list and/or to moderators.  It&#39;s work to manage a discussion like this, and those who come with the purpose of insult and disruption aren&#39;t welcome.  The moderators, and other list members, have spent more time responding than those members spent reading those responses and links.  <br/>
