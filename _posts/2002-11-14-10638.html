&lt;&lt; I&#39;d appreciate your input, or anyone who knows how to find a good doctor &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would find out your state laws first of all.  If a naturopath is considered <br/>
equal to an MD, they will be well trained.<br/>
If you don&#39;t have laws like that, most states don&#39;t, maybe call the College <br/>
in Portland OR and ask for recommendations. I will check into that and see if <br/>
they have a referral service.<br/>
My problem with the ones down here is they want to put you on TONS of <br/>
expensive herbs, which is usually not necessary. Both times I went to the <br/>
College of naturopathic medicine, I left spending under $10 and got very fast <br/>
results.<br/>
That&#39;s well trained.<br/>
Dr. Jill Stansbury was our Naturopath up North, and I&#39;ve seen her quoted in <br/>
several books since I&#39;ve left. She was extremely thorough and well trained. <br/>
Her practice is in Battleground,WA if anyone gets up there. Just across the <br/>
bridege from Portland.<br/>
Anyhoo....I&#39;d ask where they recieved their training, how many years it was.<br/>
Maybe go to them a couple of times and simply feel it out. Some are VERY <br/>
thorough, ask a lot of questions and nail it on the head the first time.<br/>
Others will rush you, not ask enough, or come to a diagnoses very quickly.<br/>
Stay away from those types. They may luck out and get you on some powerful <br/>
herbs that help, but in the long run they don&#39;t know enough.<br/>
I had a guy here diagnose a severe headache and nauseousness after two <br/>
questions.<br/>
No way.<br/>
Thoroughness is one good sign. How much they want you to spend on &quot;cure&quot; is <br/>
another. Although some maladies require more extensive treatment for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749657588">Thanks for all your comments, Ren.<br/>
I looked and found out that we have the Southwest College of Naturopathic<br/>
Medicine and Health Sciences right here in town. They also have a clinic set<br/>
up. It never occured to me to try that out.<br/>
We also have the Desert Institute of Classical Homeopathy here. I&#39;ve been<br/>
tempted to try and find a good homeopathic doctor for our family, but have<br/>
heard that it can be so costly to become an established patient that I&#39;ve<br/>
been hesitant. Of course, our insurance doesn&#39;t pay a thing for homeopathic<br/>
or naturopathic doctors. :-/ But maybe if I do some thorough looking, I can<br/>
find someone reasonable.<br/>
Thanks again for your help.<br/>
