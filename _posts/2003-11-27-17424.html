* /The Cat Years/ from the San Francisco Chronicle by<br/>
Adair Lara:  *<br/>
<br/>
*I** just realized that while children are dogs --<br/>
loyal and <br/>
affectionate-- teenagers are cats. It&#39;s so easy to be<br/>
a dog owner.  You <br/>
feed it, train it, boss it around. It puts its head on<br/>
your knee and <br/>
gazes at you as if you were a Rembrandt painting.  It<br/>
bounds indoors <br/>
with enthusiasm when you call it.*<br/>
<br/>
*Then, around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns<br/>
into a big old <br/>
cat. When you tell it to come inside, it looks amazed,<br/>
as if wondering <br/>
who died and made you emperor.  Instead of dogging<br/>
your footsteps, it <br/>
disappears. You won&#39;t see it again until it gets<br/>
hungry-then it pauses <br/>
on its sprint through the kitchen long enough to turn<br/>
its nose up at <br/>
whatever you&#39;re serving. When you reach out to ruffle<br/>
its head, in that <br/>
old affectionate gesture, it twists away from you,<br/>
then gives you a <br/>
blank stare, as if trying to remember where It has<br/>
seen you before.*<br/>
<br/>
*You, not realizing that the dog is now a cat, think<br/>
something must be <br/>
desperately wrong with it.  It seems so antisocial, so<br/>
distant, sort of <br/>
depressed.  It won&#39;t go on family outings.*<br/>
<br/>
*Since you&#39;re the one who raised it, taught it to<br/>
fetch and stay and sit <br/>
on command, you assume that you did something wrong.<br/>
Flooded with guilt <br/>
and fear, you redouble your efforts to make your pet<br/>
behave. Only now <br/>
you&#39;re dealing with a cat, so everything that worked<br/>
before now produces <br/>
the opposite of the desired result. Call it, and it<br/>
runs away. Tell it <br/>
to sit, and it jumps on the counter.  The more you go<br/>
toward it, <br/>
wringing your hands, the more it moves away. *<br/>
<br/>
*Instead of continuing to act like a dog owner, you<br/>
can learn to behave <br/>
like a cat owner.  Put a dish of food near the door,<br/>
and let it come to <br/>
you.  But remember that a cat needs your help and<br/>
affection too.  Sit <br/>
still, and it will come, seeking that warm, comforting<br/>
lap it has not <br/>
entirely forgotten.*<br/>
<br/>
*One day, your grown-up child will walk into the<br/>
kitchen, give you a big <br/>
kiss and say, &quot;You&#39;ve been on your feet all day. Let<br/>
me get those dishes <br/>
for you.&quot; Then you&#39;ll realize your cat is a dog again.</div>

<br/>
As a mother of 2 grown children, I can see a LOT of truth in it.  The oldest <br/>
one wasn&#39;t unschooled at all.  He helps with the dishes.  :)  The next one was <br/>
unschooled from the age of 11.  It&#39;s the worst with that one, but that could <br/>
be just because we&#39;re going through it RIGHT NOW.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I do know of completely unschooled kids who had/have some of the <br/>
same traits my current teenager has.  I suspect it will be less intense with my <br/>
youngest, always unschooled.  But they have the same kind of hormonal changes <br/>
to go through, separation from mom and independence pains, and I hold no <br/>
illusions that it will be all peace and light  with him, either.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;You&#39;ve been on your feet all day. Let<br/>
me get those dishes <br/>
for you.&quot; Then you&#39;ll realize your cat is a dog again. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The end bugged me the most.<br/>
<br/>
In one way, it doesn&#39;t bother me at all.<br/>
Analogies are meant to be disposable, not to make connections that last <br/>
forever.<br/>
So as an analogy, it&#39;s kind of cute, but only works when people are familiar <br/>
with all the cat/dog comparisons and jokes.<br/>
<br/>
And more than that, I think it&#39;s a joke that&#39;s best when all these conditions <br/>
are met:<br/>
the reader&#39;s familiar with cat/dog joke tradition<br/>
the reader has owned cats and dogs<br/>
the reader has children who have gone to school and become sullen<br/>
the reader accepts that the relationship between children and parents <br/>
&quot;naturally&quot; deteriorates<br/>
and the reader doesn&#39;t mind humor that treats children as less than whole.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But as just an analogy, it doesn&#39;t bother me personally so much.  Maybe it <br/>
all came from that twisting away thing  (&quot;When you reach out to ruffle its head, <br/>
in that old affectionate gesture, it twists away from you&quot;), which I have <br/>
experienced with both Kirby and Marty and which I think is as natural a part of <br/>
growing up as the desire to be with/on/attached to the mom.<br/>
<br/>
And for families which are not swift at accepting changes or understanding <br/>
that teens truly do have some developmental realities, it might be a <br/>
once-removed and useful way for them to get AN idea (&quot;the&quot; idea seems wrong, but it&#39;s a <br/>
parallel idea that might make sense to them) and stop expecting teens to be <br/>
like little kids.  They&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Though I didn&#39;t train my kids to &quot;sit and stay,&quot; my dog does it and it&#39;s <br/>
really useful.  And it&#39;s true my cat&#39;s don&#39;t.  We tried sit and stay outside <br/>
Kinko&#39;s once, though, and the dog went home (block and a half), through alleys, <br/>
only crossing one residential street, but it scared us badly.   We thought she <br/>
would stay because there are glass windows and my friend Annaliese was with her <br/>
who is her favorite human on earth.  So I add THAT to my personal analogy.  <br/>
Even dogs won&#39;t always do what you think they&#39;ll do, so the best thing is to <br/>
live WITH that other being (dog or chid) directly, close enough to see and touch <br/>
and feel their feelings when you can.<br/>
<br/>
So it the cat/dog thing doesn&#39;t offend me deeply, but I&#39;m glad I live in such <br/>
a way that it isn&#39;t a positive addition to my idea-base.<br/>

&lt;&gt;If we treat them like humans all through their days, they&#39;ll act <br/>
like humans.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kittlin&#39; has been very cat-like most of her life.  Certainly never <br/>
like a puppy-dog.  But at 16 we have been dealing with hormonal <br/>
changes, to be sure.  And we see this in so many teens around us.  <br/>
Her friends who for the most part go to school are changing, too, and <br/>
their rebellion, in some anyway, tends to be more acute: lying to <br/>
their parents, smoking, drinking, doing drugs, having sex.   <br/>
<br/>
Her body keeps changing, shifting and changing.  These changes might <br/>
not be so noticeable in every teen, maybe just a change in jean&#39;s <br/>
size.  But in one who sails around the ice rink on a 1/4&quot; blade of <br/>
steel, at high speed, with one leg up above her head, or who hurls <br/>
herself through space torquing multiple times before landing on that <br/>
1/4&quot; of steel, or who spins in a blur then stops on a dime, these <br/>
subtle changes can be devastating.  <br/>
<br/>
Her hips are spreading, a perfectly normal happening in girls as they <br/>
mature.  But this changes the fine balance necessary for a figure <br/>
skater to do the things she has been training to do for 9 years.  Now <br/>
simple things have become more difficult.  The jump she was doing so <br/>
easily 6 months ago is now lost, has to be relearned.  When throwing <br/>
her body through space every subtle little change in body fat, bone <br/>
shifting, muscle mass, etc., is noticeable, throws off her balance.  <br/>
<br/>
And her moods can be very unpredictable.  Not terrible.  Not <br/>
something we can&#39;t live with or adjust to, but not the same as they <br/>
used to be.  The girl who had utmost confidence, who sailed around <br/>
the ice like the honored princess, is now insecure, unsure of <br/>
herself, afraid she will fail.  Her hair is awful.  Her face is a <br/>
mess.  She has no clothes to wear.  What happened?  <br/>
<br/>
I see part of this as preparation for having the impetus to leave <br/>
home.  Otherwise it is awfully tempting for her to just see herself <br/>
as staying home with Mom and Dad forever.  So the struggle plays out <br/>
in our lives as she wrestles with it inside herself.  She spent last <br/>
summer mostly away from home, attending college, living on campus, <br/>
going to several one week and two-week symposia and conferences far <br/>
away.  So she is split.  One part wants to stay and one part wants to <br/>
break away.  And we try to cope and try to smooth the way as much as <br/>
possible for whatever decision she makes.  <br/>
<br/>
But we are affected by the struggle.  Sometimes it hurts so much.  <br/>
Hurts her.  Hurts us.  But just as quickly she turns around and, <br/>
indeed, cuddles in our laps, wants to be held and petted.  Is it <br/>
easier this way, easier to have parents who can go with the flow?  <br/>
Who can ride the hormone-driven emotional roller coaster with her?  I <br/>
don&#39;t know.  But it&#39;s much too late to turn back now.  Will let you <br/>
know in a few years.  Meanwhile I guess it&#39;s time to learn to like <br/>
roller coaster rides.  <br/>
<br/>
Mind you, every teen may not face the same challenges, the same <br/>
physical changes.  But some will, and for some, no matter how much <br/>
they love us, or we them, this is still a difficult time.<br/>
