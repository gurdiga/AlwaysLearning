<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136034256">Has anyone seen this MTV commercial?<br/>
 <br/>
Animated.  Mom and son sitting on couch watching TV.  All you can  hear is <br/>
the sountrack of the movie, and there&#39;s dialog between a man and a woman  and <br/>
then a bad guy comes in.  Then you hear all this violence and hitting  and a gun <br/>
firing.  When that&#39;s all over, the woman on TV says something  like, &quot;My <br/>
hero...give me a kiss&quot; then there&#39;s sound of kissing, etc.  At  this point the mom <br/>
on the couch reaches over with her hand and covers the boy&#39;s  eyes.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then the line, &quot;Watch and Learn&quot; appears and it&#39;s over.<br/>
 <br/>
I thought it was cool.  <br/>
