<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533351036">I&#39;ve been lurking here and on UD for a couple of months (I think?) now, just absorbing information and allowing myself to make a paradigm shift in regards to my children and my parenting. My kids are 7,5,3, 20 months and our fifth is due in a couple of weeks. We&#39;ve always been a very laid back and unstructured family, but I&#39;ve had things to let go of (and still do ;) in order to get to the place that I visualize for our family.<br/>
 <br/>
One thing that I struggle so much with is my children and the name calling issue. It centers around my 5 yo son, who is extremely intense...he can blow you over with the Love that beams out of him and his kindness, or he can also erupt in terrible frustration like a volcano. One thing he resorts to is saying things like &quot;I hate you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;shutup&quot;, etc. Unfortunately, some time back I have made the mistake of giving these phrases WAY too much power, but they are a hot button for me and my intelligent children certainly know it. Also, when their father gets mad, he tends to let things build up and then &quot;explode&quot; in the same way, and he is known to say hurtful things to me and the children (probably one reason why speaking this way is a hot button of mine...). Not the same phrases my 5 yo uses, but just saying hurtful things in general. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve already tried to do the &quot;controlling&quot; thing by sending them to cool off or taking something away when this happens. Ok, obviously a hell of alot of good that approach did, LOL! I felt horrible after trying to manipulate them this way and they had hurt feelings with me acting in such a manner as well. <br/>
 <br/>
For awhile, now, I have vowed to simply look at them in the eyes and tell them how I feel when they do this....&quot; I don&#39;t like being spoken to with those words. You sound (mad, angry, sad, etc..) tell me what&#39;s going on&quot;. To which, in the heat of the moment my 5 yo usually sticks his tongue out at me or screams something else in response. My 7 yo daughter doesn&#39;t do this, but my 3 yo son is now learning from watching his brother. It just seems like things are spiraling out of control with this issue, and my husband is blaming it all on me because &quot;I just let the kids do whatever they want without teaching them any respect&quot;. Ugh. <br/>
 <br/>
My friends IRL that I&#39;ve mentioned this too have all looked at me strangely saying, &quot;gosh, my kids would NEVER say THAT!!&quot;. Well, that really helps, thanks! So, please give me your thoughts...be brutal I can take it. I&#39;m tired, very pregnant, and just want to get along and have a more peaceful house (if that can ever happen with 5 kids, hehe!). <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s got to be hard to do with two yonger kids, but if you take him aside <br/>
*with you* instead of sending him away it might be more helpful sometimes.  (But <br/>
something you need to stay with the more wounded party, too, I know.)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was our worst offender at saying something hurtful.   And it&#39;s hard (I <br/>
remember myself) being an only (or in your child&#39;s case, a younger) and then <br/>
being displaced before you were ready to give up your special mom-closeness.<br/>
<br/>
I would take Kirby aside and let him vent to me.  I&#39;d ask him why he was <br/>
frustrated, or why he was tired, or &quot;are you hungry?&quot; &quot;are you feeling sick?&quot; and <br/>
basically debrief him sympathetically, but at the same time help him form his <br/>
own checklist of &quot;what&#39;s my problem?&quot;  (There are adults who could use an <br/>
inner &quot;what&#39;s my problem?&quot; checklist. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m glad to have started developing one <br/>
myself, about the time I was 30.  Before that, if I was angry I thought I was <br/>
entirely justified in being angry, and all factors were outside of me; I got <br/>
better.)<br/>
<br/>
I have said to all my kids, but mostly Kirby on that case by case basis, that <br/>
I&#39;m sorry if I have ever hurt them with words and made a bad memory they will <br/>
have always, and I&#39;m sorry for some things I said to my sister when we were <br/>
little, that I could never ever take back.   I would say that thinking <br/>
something mean without saying it ise peace of each of my children in his or her own <br/>
home insofar as I can, and I&#39;m not just here to protect them from outsiders, <br/>
axe-murderers and boogie-men of whatever real or imagined sort, but from each <br/>
other as well.   <br/>
<br/>
It makes me crazy when I hear a mom say &quot;They need to learn to work these <br/>
things out for themselves.&quot;    It&#39;s such cop-out, and such disregard for both the <br/>
underdog kid AND the bullying kid, who is learning clearly that he can get <br/>
away with what he can get away with, and his mother isn&#39;t going to interfere <br/>
because she doesn&#39;t know or care how to make peace.<br/>
<br/>
But then what about families where the mom really doesn&#39;t know how to make <br/>
peace?  Maybe then it&#39;s good to have rules and time-outs so the peace kind of <br/>
keeps itself a little more.  But I think if she can gain more peacemaking tools, <br/>
it&#39;s better for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One thing he resorts to is saying things like &quot;I hate you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll kill <br/>
you&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;shutup&quot;, etc. Unfortunately, some time back I have made the <br/>
mistake of giving these phrases WAY too much power, but they are a hot button <br/>
for me and my intelligent children certainly know it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think they phrases do have power.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a big strong guy and learned early in his life that he had to <br/>
literally and figuratively pull his punches.   He COULD kill someone, and so he <br/>
had to learn to be patient and gentle, and to learn how to calm himself.  And <br/>
all people who are trained to kill need (theoretically and ideally) to also <br/>
learn how not to WANT to kill, and not to pull it out except in the direst <br/>
emergency.<br/>
<br/>
A desire to kill, with or without the knowledge and ability, isn&#39;t a healing, <br/>
soothing, thing.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend putting him in a martial arts class with a teacher who <br/>
stresses control and patience.   When Kirby wanted to take karate, I called around <br/>
and visited until I found a school that seemed peaceful and philosophical and <br/>
historical, not all street-fighting-technique and tournament preparation.    <br/>
And so now Kirby can take another person down without really thinking about it <br/>
hard, but he has never laid a hand on another person (past when he was quite <br/>
younger and would try to strongarm Marty out of his room or away from his <br/>
stuff).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, when their father gets mad, he tends to let things build up and then <br/>
&quot;explode&quot; in the same way, and he is known to say hurtful things to me and <br/>
the children -=-<br/>
<br/>
Genetics.  <br/>
What we saw in Kirby, we countered earliest with breathing.  <br/>
&quot;Take a deep breath, Kirby and then when you calm down tell us what happened.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First the calming down, and then the report/complaint.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a more detailed account of the best way I found to deal with disputes <br/>
with kids.  After me writing it several times, someone pressed me to put it <br/>
out one more time so I didn&#39;t just get tired of reporting it.<br/>

<br/>
Personally, I think it&#39;s a mother&#39;s job to manipulate the feelings of <br/>
children who are being hurtful to others.   Your other children are counting on you <br/>
to make things better.   And those thoughts and meanness are coming from <br/>
something real inside him that he needs to learn to control.    Spanking him will <br/>
make it worse.  Saying mean awful things to him too will make it worse.   <br/>
Punishments and groundings and limits might make it worse.  But if you can figure <br/>
out what to say to help him change his thinking, that could make it better.    <br/>
Helping him think about times he was hurt by others&#39; words, or helping him find <br/>
any sort of self-comfort, self-restraint tricks of his own are better for <br/>
him, for you, for your husband, and for the other kids.  Better for the <br/>
neighbors.  Better for your son&#39;s future wife and children.<br/>
<br/>
Karate, if you can manage it.  Maybe today. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
I really think it could help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252523954">I really liked Sandra&#39;s advice -- but also some other more short term things I thought of: <br/>
<br/>
In cases where he is saying these things to YOU - I have found that a mild &quot;really?&quot; can often diffuse the situation with my highly emotional nearly 7 yo - and picturing myself absorbing her anger, rather than reflecting it (or adding my own!). <br/>
<br/>
 Sometimes after the crisis has passed, I follow up with the informational, &quot;it hurts my feelings when you say that I am mean and horrible and never do anything you want.  do you really feel like that?&quot;  Not in a shaming voice, and not in a long drawn out discussion - but as information.  My other child is only 2, so she has never yelled anything at him, but I think if she did I might do the same mild information that she probably hurt his feelings and did she really feel like that? <br/>
<br/>
If it is just the words that bug you &quot;stupid&quot; &quot;shut-up&quot; &quot;I hate you&quot; that bother you -- can you get a book of Shakespearean insults or something and see if the two of you can come up with some more colorful but less hurtfully emotional words for him to use to blow off steam?  Maybe if he yelled something like  &quot;you puling poltroon&quot; it would feel less hurtful to all involved because the words had less emotional power? <br/>
<br/>
The thing I liked about Sandra&#39;s advice, is that it was long-term advice on how not to grow up into a person who holds things in and then explodes - my advice is more about managing the moment.   But I have noticed my own now nearly 7 y.o., seems to simply be growing out of many of those explosive name-calling behaviors that she had when she was 5 (though she is still prone to melt-downs when overly stressed by things like noise or activitiy)  No one in her genetic line is prone to explosive, confrontive anger, though, so that may make a difference. <br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helped. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238156467">Kristina,<br/>
<br/>
I read your post and so understood how you were describing your 5 yo. My <br/>
kids are 7, 5 and 4, and my 4 yo is extremely intense and explosive, <br/>
very much like you describe. When he was younger, much of his anger <br/>
would come out as aggression. Now that he&#39;s a bit older, he has shifted <br/>
into verbal aggression, which is a step better, but still aggression <br/>
nonetheless. Part of my job as a mother, I believe, is to provide a <br/>
safe, nurturing environment for *all* my children, and it breaks my <br/>
heart that there are times when it&#39;s a sibling I must protect them from. <br/>
It&#39;s so much easier when it&#39;s us against the world! *g*<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t reply to you right away because I&#39;ve been dealing with this <br/>
very issue myself and had no words of wisdom. I was soul-sick and <br/>
looking for my own support...  I still have no words or wisdom, but I do <br/>
now have the energy to commiserate and share some of what we&#39;re trying <br/>
to do here.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that my guy&#39;s rage seems to come in cycles. Things will be <br/>
really good for a while, then really bad for a while. I&#39;m still not <br/>
quite sure what sends him into a tailspin. It may be that we get too <br/>
busy and stop honoring his need for down time; it may just be that he <br/>
has a threshold and once crossed needs to blow off steam for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that controlling and time-outs don&#39;t work--in fact it escalates <br/>
the behavior. I discovered a long time ago, that walking away from my <br/>
guy while he was in one of his rages was the worst thing I could do to <br/>
him. The fear behind his eyes cut to my heart, and I could see that I <br/>
was abandoning him when he needed me most. That need can be difficult to <br/>
see when he doesn&#39;t want a hug or any kind of nurturing that I might try <br/>
to give, but the need is for my presence to reassure him that he is not <br/>
alone and that he is loved and that I will be there for him when he is <br/>
ready to be loved.<br/>
<br/>
When Sam says hateful things, my response is often, &quot;Please don&#39;t hurt <br/>
me/Em/ Julia with your words. You must feel really mad to have to get it <br/>
out like that, and you just need to get that hurt out, huh? Is there <br/>
something I can do to help?&quot; Yes, lots of times the response is a <br/>
guttural, back of the throat scream or a stick the tongue out raspberry. <br/>
Some of the time, it&#39;s a melting, &quot;Yes, sorry mama&quot; and curl up in my <br/>
lap. I wish I could make the latter response the norm, but that&#39;s up to <br/>
him not me.<br/>
<br/>
I think the important thing with small kids is just being there to <br/>
calmly, gently, immediately intervene, letting them all know that this <br/>
is not how people can be treated within the family. Reasoning with Sam <br/>
when he&#39;s raging is impossible, but talking with him after the fact <br/>
about his need for respect and the need for respect to work both ways <br/>
is, I believe, helpful for the long run if not the immediate moment. <br/>
With younger children I really do believe that much of the work we do is <br/>
groundwork, the effects of which are long term rather than short term. <br/>

<br/>
That sounds like I mean to imply that rage directed outside the family <br/>
is okay. Not what I meant at all. *g*<br/>
<br/>
Sam&#39;s rage is almost always directed at someone within the <br/>
family--partly because he doesn&#39;t usually play with other kids and <br/>
partly because this is where he feel safe.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to make that clear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515005343">It sounds like you are getting some good advise so far I just <br/>
wanted to add that the way I think of it as usually that the child <br/>
just hasn&#39;t learned the correct way to ask for what he wants or <br/>
needs. My 6 yo occasionally tells me to &quot;Shut up&quot; and it is usually <br/>
during a situation where he feels like he would rather be doing <br/>
something else but is stuck with a mom who is visiting with a <br/>
friend, etc. <br/>
    Sometimes I reply with a simple - &quot;I will be able to stop <br/>
talking in just a minute and then we can get going, Thank you for <br/>
being so patient with me&quot; and if it keeps up then later (after the <br/>
friend has left or take him aside alone) I will confirm his feelings <br/>
that he is ready to go, bored, wanting some attention for himself, <br/>
etc. whatever and I will ask that he would please try to let me know <br/>
what is going on with him in a more polite way, and I may also <br/>
remind him of how I am patient for him while he is looking at toys <br/>
etc. so perhaps that this could be a time he could be patient for me <br/>
etc. I think of it as the child not really understanding either the <br/>
polite way of saying something or perhaps he is at a loss for better <br/>
words but feels strongly about a situation. <br/>
    He went though a short phase (I look back and now it seems short <br/>
but I&#39;m sure at the time it seems an eternity) where he would yell <br/>
something like &quot; I hate you &quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want you for my parent <br/>
anymore&quot;, etc. and I was able to restate those for him like perhaps <br/>
he was saying he wanted to be able to have something for himself or <br/>
perhaps he was just trying to say that he didn&#39;t agree with us and <br/>
when I kept restating what he was saying with more appropriate <br/>
expressions then he was able to follow my model and now he rarely <br/>
says something totally inappropriate and in those cases he is <br/>
usually noticably hungry or tired as well.<br/>
    There was one instance before he really seemed to &quot;understand&quot; <br/>
that his words were capable of hurting me that he actually drove me <br/>
to tears and then he asked me what I was crying for because he was <br/>
the one who was upset and so I told him that his words had hurt me, <br/>
etc. that was kind of a turning point for both of us, that he <br/>
started to understand his words could hurt and I started to <br/>
understand that he didn&#39;t realize what he was saying so I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
take it at face value, etc. The book the Explosive child  (by Green <br/>
I think) gives some good examples about teaching a child better use <br/>
of their own words, but I don&#39;t agree with everything from the book <br/>
(especially his views on medicine or school)but that&#39;s like most <br/>
books I read I take what is useful to me and leave what isn&#39;t. Moza<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455311933">Hi Kristina,<br/>
<br/>
My now 14 year old Max had the most intense tantrums when he was 4 and 5. In<br/>
fact, I might even call them psychotic-looking (kidding! kidding! That was a<br/>
joke in reference to an earlier thread that caused a big response!).<br/>
<br/>
I learned that the most important thing in the moment of intense emotion is<br/>
to listen to the child. I like Sandra&#39;s suggestion to take him aside so as<br/>
not to upset others around you as much as possible, though the others<br/>
certainly can learn from watching how to handle rage with love. Becoming the<br/>
&quot;victim&quot; of your son&#39;s behavior definitely takes the heat off everyone else<br/>
too. But ideally, taking the problem away from others is probably a good<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
There is no talking &quot;sense&quot; to a child who is in the throws of emotions.<br/>
They need loving attention. It&#39;s usually not a good time to tell them how it<br/>
makes you feel. You have to take your triggers out of the equation. If what<br/>
he is saying bothers you in the moment, do your best to see that this is<br/>
simply a child in need of being listened to. You are his safe sounding<br/>
board. When he has a chance to let it out, he will be calmer, and that is a<br/>
great time to re-evaluate the situation together.<br/>
<br/>
If he is saying these things without intense emotion, but instead with<br/>
seeming intent to be mean, then I would simply intervene to stop the<br/>
behavior and then engage in discussion. Sometimes stopping the behavior will<br/>
actually trigger strong emotion, and then that is a good opportunity for the<br/>
child to release feelings that need to get out of the way. They are probably<br/>
the crux of what is driving his negative behavior.<br/>
<br/>
We have had family meeting discussions in general about mean talk. Everyone<br/>
has a chance to say how they feel when different things are said to them.<br/>
Give examples that are close to what you hear your guy(s) say as part of the<br/>
discussion. In a safe environment, the &quot;victims&quot; and &quot;abusers&quot; can each say<br/>
their thoughts and hear how others are effected. You may even get to<br/>
brainstorm ideas of what to do when:<br/>
-feeling like you want to say something mean to someone<br/>
-someone says something mean to you<br/>
-you hear someone being mean to someone else<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Coming up with ideas together can help everyone feel like they have been<br/>
part of the problem-solving, and help enroll everyone in making the<br/>
situation better.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that a couple of your children may be too young for participating<br/>
in discussions. If they see it happening at an early age though, they will<br/>
grow with a great example of how to work things out together.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son Max turned into a mild-mannered, deep thinking individual. His<br/>
occasional babysitter back then told me that she was very worried he had the<br/>
personality of a future axe murderer (yes, she was canned). Fortunately, I<br/>
had supportive people reminding me not to not be scared, it was not a<br/>
permanent thing, he just had feelings to get rid of, and to just keep<br/>
listening lovingly, and keep asking for help when I was stuck. I think that<br/>
advise was right on. It sounds like you do a lot of this already! I so<br/>
remember trying to get through tantrums without losing it myself. When the<br/>
tantrum was over, I learned to call a trusted friend to vent all the things<br/>
that it brought up in me. That helped me be clearer for the next one.<br/>

One thing that I struggle so much with is my children and the name calling<br/>
issue. It centers around my 5 yo son, who is extremely intense...he can blow<br/>
you over with the Love that beams out of him and his kindness, or he can<br/>
also erupt in terrible frustration like a volcano. One thing he resorts to<br/>
is saying things like &quot;I hate you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;shutup&quot;,<br/>
etc. Unfortunately, some time back I have made the mistake of giving these<br/>
phrases WAY too much power, but they are a hot button for me and my<br/>
intelligent children certainly know it. Also, when their father gets mad, he<br/>
tends to let things build up and then &quot;explode&quot; in the same way, and he is<br/>
known to say hurtful things to me and the children (probably one reason why<br/>
speaking this way is a hot button of mine...). Not the same phrases my 5 yo<br/>
uses, but just saying hurtful things in general.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already tried to do the &quot;controlling&quot; thing by sending them to cool off<br/>
or taking something away when this happens. Ok, obviously a hell of alot of<br/>
good that approach did, LOL! I felt horrible after trying to manipulate them<br/>
this way and they had hurt feelings with me acting in such a manner as well.<br/>
<br/>
For awhile, now, I have vowed to simply look at them in the eyes and tell<br/>
them how I feel when they do this....&quot; I don&#39;t like being spoken to with<br/>
those words. You sound (mad, angry, sad, etc..) tell me what&#39;s going on&quot;. To<br/>
which, in the heat of the moment my 5 yo usually sticks his tongue out at me<br/>
or screams something else in response. My 7 yo daughter doesn&#39;t do this, but<br/>
my 3 yo son is now learning from watching his brother. It just seems like<br/>
things are spiraling out of control with this issue, and my husband is<br/>
blaming it all on me because &quot;I just let the kids do whatever they want<br/>
without teaching them any respect&quot;. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
My friends IRL that I&#39;ve mentioned this too have all looked at me strangely<br/>
saying, &quot;gosh, my kids would NEVER say THAT!!&quot;. Well, that really helps,<br/>
thanks! So, please give me your thoughts...be brutal I can take it. I&#39;m<br/>
tired, very pregnant, and just want to get along and have a more peaceful<br/>
house (if that can ever happen with 5 kids, hehe!).<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184883037">Gosh,<br/>
Thank you *so much* to everyone for taking the time to respond to my challenges. I am saving all of these posts to refer back to often in times when I need some ideas. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s especially nice to hear about your son, Jaki, who is now older and has had these very intense emotional outbursts like I&#39;m experiencing. My son, Liam, was born intense. At about 15 months he started throwing himself down on the ground, kicking and screaming, when things were not as he needed them to be. I wondered what the heck was happening, because my first child never, EVER, did anything even remotely related to an episode such as this. The hardest and scariest thing for me, as a mother, was that even at that very young age he would never let me touch or console him. I would just sit with him, feeling so helpless, until he was done and would come up and finally snuggle and nurse with me. But, it was always on his terms, and if I tried to sing, speak softly, or touch him he would loose it even more. This continued until he was into his 3&#39;s (peaking between 15 months-3 yrs and then tapering off until he was around 4).<br/>
 <br/>
Once he turned 4 he really seemed to hit an even streak. During these times I read a gillion books (all LLL-ish books, as I am a local leader and that was my resource), and tried and tried to give him words to match his feelings, etc. Then, as Danielle mentioned, his physical aggression (though never really taken out on anyone else, just with himself) turned to verbal aggression with family members when upset. And, also, he is just really strong and literally doesn&#39;t know his strength with his 3 yo brother who is much more slight and petite than my very muscular 5 yo. <br/>
 <br/>
We do tell lots of stories about people learning to use their strength wisely  (like Hercules) and I watch for movies that might have these themes as well. I like Sandra&#39;s idea of martial arts, we will look into that in the future. He just started soccer, and this is his first &quot;activity&quot; away from home which is a big deal for him. He may not be quite ready yet for a structured class as martial arts, but we will see. Also, getting him away and focusing attention ON HIM when (or ideally right before he melts down) is ideal. My main struggle is my natural inclination is to focus on the victim, and I&#39;m usually juggling the younger children at the same time. I am going to make a big effort to make sure I can do this much more often (especially here before the baby comes), and try to make that connection with him in the moment, even if it&#39;s just sitting with him quietly as it was when he was a baby. <br/>
 <br/>
Also, I can relate to Jaki as all of those &quot;well meaning&quot; family members are so concerned that &quot;I allow&quot; this out of control behavior and say often they are concerned about what kind of older child and adult he will be. I just think that&#39;s horrible. It&#39;s certainly not like I&#39;m saying &quot;well, whatever, he&#39;ll work it out on his own&quot;, I&#39;m trying different things, and most importantly my heart is there with him trying to help in ways that I know how. I KNOW he knows this and that is most important. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve always felt that Liam was born with such a great Spirit and has had a bit of a harder time adjusting to this earthly world than some others have. I do CHOOSE to always see Liam surrounded by Light and beauty and for the wonderful, creative, powerful person/soul that he is. Thank you all so much for your words, they have helped me greatly!<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Kristina<br/>

&lt;&lt; My 6 yo occasionally tells me to &quot;Shut up&quot; and it is usually <br/>
<br/>
during a situation where he feels like he would rather be doing <br/>
<br/>
something else but is stuck with a mom who is visiting with a <br/>
<br/>
friend, etc.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of sounding like a crazed 50&#39;s mom, I wouldn&#39;t have a child say <br/>
&quot;shut up&quot; to me any more than ONCE.  &quot;Occasionally&quot; sounds like &quot;all the time <br/>
to me, for something like that.    But I categorize &quot;shut up&quot; with &quot;eat shit <br/>
and die&quot; and other really extreme, awful thigs that should only be said jokingly <br/>
among VERY close friends.<br/>
<br/>
-=-    Sometimes I reply with a simple - &quot;I will be able to stop <br/>
<br/>
talking in just a minute and then we can get going, Thank you for <br/>
<br/>
being so patient with me&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not simple.  That&#39;s like 25 words or so.  That&#39;s a speech.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying &quot;thank you&quot; to ANY human who tells me to shut up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I may also <br/>
<br/>
remind him of how I am patient for him while he is looking at toys <br/>
<br/>
etc. so perhaps that this could be a time he could be patient for me <br/>
<br/>
etc-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about patience, which is hard for ANYONE to learn.  It&#39;s about the <br/>
level of insult in the language.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think of it as the child not really understanding either the <br/>
<br/>
polite way of saying something or perhaps he is at a loss for better <br/>
<br/>
words but feels strongly about a situation. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I feel strongly that if parents model subtle, courteous ways to get someone&#39;s <br/>
attention and to communicate, the children will learn that.  But modelling <br/>
takes a while.  In the meantime, I don&#39;t think &quot;shut up&quot; is a useful addition to <br/>
any conversation (except those in which the people are ending their <br/>
relationship).<br/>
<br/>
-=- He went though a short phase (I look back and now it seems short <br/>
<br/>
but I&#39;m sure at the time it seems an eternity) where he would yell <br/>
<br/>
something like &quot; I hate you &quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want you for my parent <br/>
<br/>
anymore&quot;, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those are better information than &quot;Shut up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids have said really negative things, when they were little, I would <br/>
ask &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
A couple of times I told Kirby that if he knew another family he would rather <br/>
live with, I&#39;d call and ask if he could stay there, and talking through just <br/>
a little of what he was really angry with (with the idea of moving elsewhere, <br/>
with his clothes and toys, and that I would give them money for food), he <br/>
would calm down and sometimes end up laughing.  Sometimes I would recommend a <br/>
family he&#39;d been hanging out with a lot.   There weren&#39;t better places.   The <br/>
other kids haven&#39;t had that frustration.  I think it had to do with being oldest <br/>
and getting crowded as others came along.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I told him that his words had hurt me, <br/>
<br/>
etc. that was kind of a turning point for both of us, that he <br/>
<br/>
started to understand his words could hurt and I started to <br/>
<br/>
understand that he didn&#39;t realize what he was saying so I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
take it at face value, etc. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Words have a reality, though, and pretending people didn&#39;t say what they said <br/>
is only a false courtesy.   I&#39;ve done it.  I&#39;ve ignored mean things an angry <br/>
friend (or husband) said because I knew he was venting in fury because of too <br/>
many circumstances at once.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is still the least content person in our family.  The world is not as <br/>
comfortable for him as it is for some people.  Still, he has lots of friends <br/>
and a busy life and he&#39;s healthy and active, but sometimes it seems there&#39;s a <br/>
sadness and a restlessness the other two don&#39;t have.<br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Depends on what you&#39;re used to, I guess.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I was growing up, &quot;shut up&quot; was a common thing to say and hear.   I <br/>
never knew anyone considered it extreme insult until I was in the Army at Ft.  <br/>
Lee, VA, after boot camp.  I said, &quot;Shut up.&quot; to my bunk mate who just kept  on <br/>
and on complaining about everything and she was being very, very irritating  to <br/>
everyone around her.  She was distraught over something, no one could  tell <br/>
what it was, and she was being totally irrational.  Complaining  garners no <br/>
sympathy in the Army.  We&#39;re all in it together, you know?   No use complaining.  <br/>
Just do what you have to do.  So I just said,  &quot;Shut up.&quot; in a kind of &quot;come <br/>
on, just get over it already&#39; kind of way.<br/>
 <br/>
It was as if I had cursed her to hell.  No one, not even my overly  critical <br/>
mother, had ever indicated to me that &quot;shut up&quot; is an extreme  insult.  I&#39;m <br/>
still surprised when someone says that it is.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
    Occasionally in this case = 2X in last month. I think <br/>
perhaps &quot;shut up&quot; is a &quot;button&quot; with you? To me it is someone <br/>
saying - &quot;I don&#39;t really want to hear you talk anymore&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
ready to go&quot; but they just don&#39;t have better words at the time, it&#39;s <br/>
short and easy for them to remember, In reply I would like to model <br/>
politeness, like &quot;In just a minute&quot; or &quot;This is important to me and <br/>
I&#39;m going to have to ask you to be more patient awhile longer&quot;, etc <br/>
and then talk with them later about his choice of words. I could <br/>
tell him to fuck off but I think that would give the wrong <br/>
impression and he would probably tell me the same in return and then <br/>
we would just have other words that arn&#39;t the best choices anyways. <br/>
<br/>
    Probably the worst thing he has ever said was &quot;I don&#39;t want you <br/>
for a mom anymore&quot; and that he only said once because it made me cry <br/>
and he realized it hurt my feelings. I just don&#39;t give words that <br/>
kind of power especially when they come from a 6yo who isn&#39;t aware <br/>
of the impact. Now if my DS said it in a non-joking manner to me <br/>
then I would probably not take it as well, but luckily my dh is a <br/>
better model than that. I don&#39;t think this is a matter so much of <br/>
respect rather of learning more appropriate methods. <br/>
<br/>
So what happens if the child says it more than once?? That sounds <br/>
like a mother with a newborn saying &quot;my child is never going to cuss <br/>
or hit me, I won&#39;t let them!&quot; </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119228996">I just think it has not sunk in with my son that &quot;Shut up&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>
the most appropriate thing to say, he hears it on TV cartoons often. <br/>
Yes we talk about it but we also talk about a lot of things - many <br/>
of which arn&#39;t learned in just one instance, most are learned over <br/>
time. So I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;m not going to jump all over my son <br/>
for picking the words &quot;shut up&quot;, that may even make him think his <br/>
opinion doesn&#39;t matter or perhaps he shouldn&#39;t experiment with any <br/>
new words with mommy. Also if I tell him that a word &quot;isn&#39;t very <br/>
nice to say&quot; then what if he just isn&#39;t feeling &quot;very nice&quot; at the <br/>
time he said it? He could say it knowingly that he wasn&#39;t being nice <br/>
because of some other issue intirely! In my opinion it is better to <br/>
talk about things rather than just pick out certain words that my <br/>
son isn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to say. I know my son isn&#39;t perfect (I&#39;m <br/>
certainly not) and I know he is going to make occasional poor <br/>
choices in his words or actions and I feel it is more my job to <br/>
model, show him a better way, or talk about it rather than it is to <br/>
degrade or limit him. <br/>
<br/>
You said &quot;Can we go now?&quot; is what my kids would say if they wanted <br/>
to go.  Not &quot;shut <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; up.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I think there&#39;s a profound difference.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not in my opinion - there is only a slight difference of the child <br/>
knowing one saying is more appropriate.  <br/>
<br/>
You said: &gt; If children have never been told &quot;shut up&quot; and if when <br/>
the parents heard <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; others say it (in person, on TV, whatever) the parents had <br/>
 </span></blockquote>said, &quot;That&#39;s not very <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; nice to say,&quot; then why would the child want to use the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>phrase &quot;shut up&quot;?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   Perhaps the child couldn&#39;t think of what else to say? Perhaps <br/>
it&#39;s frequent use on TV is more overwhelming than the parent&#39;s <br/>
stating the word isn&#39;t nice? I&#39;m sure there could be many other <br/>
reasons - why do most people cuss in general even theough it&#39;s &quot;not <br/>
nice&quot;? <br/>
 Also you didn&#39;t actually answer the question -  So what happens if <br/>
the child says it more than once?? Isn&#39;t that limiting your child <br/>
and isn&#39;t part of unschooling not limiting your child? (Not that I <br/>
ever wish for your child to tell you to &quot;shut up&quot; - I&#39;m just trying <br/>
to understand what you&#39;re saying)<br/>

he needed them to be.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like he really needed to let it out!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;he would never let me touch or console him. I would just sit with him,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feeling so helpless, until he was done and would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;come up and finally snuggle and nurse with me. But, it was always on his<br/>
 </span></blockquote>terms, and if I tried to sing, speak softly, or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;touch him he would loose it even more. This continued until he was into<br/>
 </span></blockquote>his 3&#39;s (peaking between 15 months-3 yrs and then<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;tapering off until he was around 4).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like my oldest son Andrew (15). He was &quot;tactile defensive&quot; and<br/>
his cues for what he needed were MUCH different from my other children. He<br/>
was often inconsolable as a baby, and my instinct to cuddle and nurse him<br/>
was the opposite of what he wanted. He nursed for hunger, but did not<br/>
usually seek it out for comfort. It was very confusing and disheartening to<br/>
me. My earth momma ego was definitely bruised :) He was my first, so I<br/>
didn&#39;t have comparisons at the time except for the babies I had worked with<br/>
before, which is much different from having your own. He was eventually<br/>
diagnosed with high-functioning autism later on, when we wanted to get some<br/>
services from the state. It was very helpful to look it up on the internet<br/>
and get lots of information of things people had experienced and what helped<br/>
their children. Ultimately though, I think that there are a myriad of<br/>
different personality types, and the diagnoses are often a way to see how<br/>
some of those personalities do or don&#39;t fit into the box called &quot;public<br/>
school system&quot;. But I digress :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;his physical aggression (though never really taken out on anyone else,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just with himself) turned to verbal aggression with &gt;&gt;family members when<br/>
upset.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you not allow him to hurt himself as well as not<br/>
hurting others. Intervening so that he hits a pillow instead of himself, or<br/>
whatever else gets that abuse off of him, shows that you care enough for him<br/>
to not get hurt, while still recognizing that he has these feelings and they<br/>
need to come out somewhere safe.<br/>
<br/>
As far as verbally abusing family members, I think you have to stop that.<br/>
And when you do, be ready to take the heat until he gets it out of his<br/>
system. It is actually a great opportunity for him to get to the core, and<br/>
may be exactly what he is asking for by behaving this way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Also, getting him away and focusing attention ON HIM when (or ideally<br/>
 </span></blockquote>right before he melts down) is ideal.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a great idea. I have four children, and for a long time my<br/>
husband and I scheduled a &quot;special time&quot; each week with each child, a one-on<br/>
one time when they could do whatever they wanted, say whatever they wanted<br/>
and have our full loving attention. This was a transformative experience for<br/>
all of us. They sometimes stored up their hurts or excitements for that time<br/>
alone with one of us. It would be great if we could give that kind of<br/>
attention all the time, but with the logistics of life, it doesn&#39;t always<br/>
happen. Having a time that they could count on gave them an ability to hold<br/>
their frustrations for a time that was safe, and saved some &quot;victims&quot; of<br/>
their bad feelings. Their behavior outside of that special time became more<br/>
caring and confident.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My main struggle is my natural inclination is to focus on the victim, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m usually juggling the younger children at the &gt;&gt;same time.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is a struggle! I think your inclination to help the victim is a<br/>
good one, and if you only have ability in the moment to take care of one,<br/>
then taking care of the victim is probably the way to go. If that is what<br/>
happens however, make sure to get back as soon as you can to your son. As<br/>
you said, he is in need too, and helping him helps the victims.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m trying different things, and most importantly my heart is there with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>him trying to help in ways that I know how. I KNOW &gt;&gt;he knows this and that<br/>
is most important.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That Liam is one lucky dude to have you as a mom!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree.  There are limits in any relationship.  And those limits are<br/>
different in every relationship.  If a child or an adult is causing harm and<br/>
we don&#39;t limit it, the child or adult may not understand that they are<br/>
causing harm, may believe that the harm they are causing is ok, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I think the unschooling issue comes in with HOW you limit.  If any child or<br/>
any adult told me to &quot;shut up&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t threaten to hit them, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
threaten to take away priviledges.....I would say &quot;That was a very rude<br/>
thing to say to me.  I don&#39;t want you to talk to me that way.  I take it you<br/>
are ready to go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it continued, I would take a look not at what was being said....but WHY<br/>
it was being said after I expressed to the other person that I didn&#39;t like<br/>
it at all.  I would wait for a quiet time, a cuddle time, and ask them why,<br/>
listen without judging and see if we could figure out the problem.<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: children hurting with their words<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I just think it has not sunk in with my son that &quot;Shut up&quot; isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; the most appropriate thing to say, he hears it on TV cartoons often.<br/>
&gt; Yes we talk about it but we also talk about a lot of things - many<br/>
&gt; of which arn&#39;t learned in just one instance, most are learned over<br/>
&gt; time. So I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;m not going to jump all over my son<br/>
&gt; for picking the words &quot;shut up&quot;, that may even make him think his<br/>
&gt; opinion doesn&#39;t matter or perhaps he shouldn&#39;t experiment with any<br/>
&gt; new words with mommy. Also if I tell him that a word &quot;isn&#39;t very<br/>
&gt; nice to say&quot; then what if he just isn&#39;t feeling &quot;very nice&quot; at the<br/>
&gt; time he said it? He could say it knowingly that he wasn&#39;t being nice<br/>
&gt; because of some other issue intirely! In my opinion it is better to<br/>
&gt; talk about things rather than just pick out certain words that my<br/>
&gt; son isn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to say. I know my son isn&#39;t perfect (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; certainly not) and I know he is going to make occasional poor<br/>
&gt; choices in his words or actions and I feel it is more my job to<br/>
&gt; model, show him a better way, or talk about it rather than it is to<br/>
&gt; degrade or limit him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You said &quot;Can we go now?&quot; is what my kids would say if they wanted<br/>
&gt; to go.  Not &quot;shut<br/>
&gt; &gt; up.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think there&#39;s a profound difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not in my opinion - there is only a slight difference of the child<br/>
&gt; knowing one saying is more appropriate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You said: &gt; If children have never been told &quot;shut up&quot; and if when<br/>
&gt; the parents heard<br/>
&gt; &gt; others say it (in person, on TV, whatever) the parents had<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;That&#39;s not very<br/>
&gt; &gt; nice to say,&quot; then why would the child want to use the<br/>
&gt; phrase &quot;shut up&quot;?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Perhaps the child couldn&#39;t think of what else to say? Perhaps<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s frequent use on TV is more overwhelming than the parent&#39;s<br/>
&gt; stating the word isn&#39;t nice? I&#39;m sure there could be many other<br/>
&gt; reasons - why do most people cuss in general even theough it&#39;s &quot;not<br/>
&gt; nice&quot;?<br/>
&gt;  Also you didn&#39;t actually answer the question -  So what happens if<br/>
&gt; the child says it more than once?? Isn&#39;t that limiting your child<br/>
&gt; and isn&#39;t part of unschooling not limiting your child? (Not that I<br/>
&gt; ever wish for your child to tell you to &quot;shut up&quot; - I&#39;m just trying<br/>
&gt; to understand what you&#39;re saying)<br/>

&gt; &gt; or hit me, I won&#39;t let them!&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have a friend who told me Kirby was going to grow up to hit me,<br/>
&gt; because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t spank him when he was little.   Interesting &quot;logic.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We eventually quit having any contact with each other at all.  I<br/>
&gt; heard from<br/>
&gt; &gt; mutual friends that her teenager DID hit her when he was older,<br/>
&gt; and he was<br/>
&gt; &gt; spanked plenty.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And if a child say something really mean and the mom makes plain<br/>
&gt; that it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; too mean to say, especially in front of someone else, it would<br/>
&gt; take a pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; bad relationship or some serious hostility toward the parent for<br/>
&gt; the child to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do the same harsh thing again, in my experience.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Can we go now?&quot; is what my kids would say if they wanted to go.<br/>
&gt; Not &quot;shut<br/>
&gt; &gt; up.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think there&#39;s a profound difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that they&#39;re older, they might point at a clock or gesture<br/>
&gt; where the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other person can&#39;t see me, or come and hold my hand, or ask for<br/>
&gt; the car keys to<br/>
&gt; &gt; start loading the car.   I think they act that way because that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the way we&#39;ve<br/>

I agree absolutely.<br/>
If the principle is to use nicer words when we have a choice, then it&#39;s not a <br/>
rule about what is okay to say.<br/>
<br/>
But if a kid says &quot;shut up&quot; and the mom says &quot;thank you for being patient,&quot; <br/>
it&#39;s going to be confusing to the child, I think.<br/>

<br/>
I think talking about it is wonderful, and if it&#39;s clear to him that some <br/>
ways of talking are painful to his target and don&#39;t make him as good a guy as he <br/>
would probably like to be either, he will probably want to limit himself, for <br/>
the good of all involved.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-=-Not in my opinion - -=-<br/>
<br/>
If I ask my husband to do something and he says &quot;I can&#39;t right now&quot; that&#39;s <br/>
real information, and he&#39;s treating me like another human.  If he says &quot;Shut up&quot; <br/>
or &quot;screw you&quot; there&#39;s a profound difference not only in the words, but in <br/>
the attitude it shows toward the situation and toward me and toward our <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are old enough to understand situations and relationships pretty <br/>
earlier.   Some kids are, anyway.   Is it possible this is another interpersonal <br/>
intelligence issue?   <br/>
<br/>
-=- Also you didn&#39;t actually answer the question -  So what happens if <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know, because it doesn&#39;t happen here.  My kids really want to be <br/>
nice.  <br/>
I talk to them.  We talk about others&#39; behavior (others in real life and <br/>
others on movies, in songs, in books).   They LIKE for other people to be nice to <br/>
them.  They&#39;re analytical about what is nice and what isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Isn&#39;t that limiting your child <br/>
<br/>
and isn&#39;t part of unschooling not limiting your child?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The principle of making good choices isn&#39;t a limit.  It&#39;s a direction and a <br/>
principle.<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t possibly operate without values, direction and principles, <br/>
can it?<br/>

When I ask Jayn why she did something, or seemed to be feeling something, it<br/>
has to be a genuine question. That is I really want to understand why, and<br/>
help her to articulate why. Avoiding irritated statements masquerading as<br/>
questions like the &quot;What were you thinking?&quot; example above really is key.<br/>
They still pop out from me sometimes in the heat of the moment. But the mood<br/>
and manner and inflexion is very different in a quiet moment of reflective<br/>
conversation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239125173">Kristina your comment sparked my memory (glad to know that still can happen<br/>
&lt;g&gt;)of another &quot;key&quot; communication idea. I think I got this one from the<br/>
&quot;How to Talk...&quot; book as well. Rather than asking questions, which most<br/>
children are bombarded with,  make a statement that recognizes something in<br/>
the moment, and then don&#39;t say anything. Stay quiet until the child says<br/>
something. Oftentimes they are thinking and need more time to answer than we<br/>
are used to giving (well, maybe not so much the people on this list).<br/>
Something like, &quot;I noticed you said &#39;shut up&#39; to me&quot;. Or &quot;I&#39;m thinking you<br/>
aren&#39;t feeling well right now&quot;. An honest statement free from blame or other<br/>
yucky stuff often invokes an honest response from a child.<br/>

&lt;&lt; my<br/>
experience with my children is the minute the word &quot;WHY&quot; comes out they are<br/>
very defensive. I am as well. I don&#39;t like it when my husband comes to me<br/>
and says &quot;why did you do that?&quot; &quot;what were you thinking?&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But the mood<br/>
and manner and inflexion is very different in a quiet moment of reflective<br/>
conversation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  Not the accusational &quot;What the **@#!! were you thinking!?&quot;<br/>
but at worst a later, quiet &quot;Jeez, Holly.   Didn&#39;t you see her face?  Maybe <br/>
you could&#39;ve cut her some slack.  Why were you so angry with her?&quot;  And <br/>
ideally, &quot;What was going on that you were so angry today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I have those conversations it&#39;s not to review and amend what just <br/>
happened.  It&#39;s to help them be aware for future instances, and to see what tools <br/>
they had but forgot to use.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-894848905"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Rather than asking questions, which most<br/>

the moment, and then don&#39;t say anything. Stay quiet until the child says<br/>
something. &lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks Jaki,<br/>
I do like this idea, and I will remember to try it more. With my son, any blame at all can send him off. Need to pull out the books and re-read! LOL!<br/>
