<div id="ygrps-yiv-495423737">OK, I admit it, I read it as &quot;Frontier House Suvivor&quot;.  I was thinking, &quot;Good <br/>
god, now they&#39;ve got more reality in their reality TV.&quot;  Then I reread it and <br/>
realized *I* have too much reality!  or is that realism?  literalism?  <br/>
astigmatism?  caffeine-ism?<br/>
Enough already, I hear you saying.  <br/>
