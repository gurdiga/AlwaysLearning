<div id="ygrps-yiv-973144502">Hi folks...My mom&#39;s funeral was this morning, and I head home to Beth and <br/>
julian tomorrow morning. YAY!<br/>
<br/>
I wrote and gave the eulogy for her this morning, and wanted to share it with <br/>
you all. This is in honor of my mother, Carole Baptista. <br/>
<br/>
Some time ago I realized that I inherited most of the passions I have in my <br/>
life from my mother. Through her love of learning and books, love of travel, <br/>
her quiet respect for those she cared about, and her pragmatic strength, I <br/>
have learned to build a life I love. And my mother was unwavering in her <br/>
support of that.<br/>
    You need to understand-my mom was NOT a teacher. Always brilliant - she <br/>
always knew the Jeopardy answers-she was told she could go to Teacher College <br/>
or not at all. Well, in high school the nuns at her school had put her in <br/>
charge for months of a class of younger students, and she&#39;d hated it. So she <br/>
chose not at all.<br/>
    But she loved learning and passed that along to us. When my sister and I <br/>
were kids, my parents led interesting lives, and we were always welcome to <br/>
join in. So we constantly had journalists, activists, local politicians, and <br/>
dozens of other interesting people around. Rather than being sent to our <br/>
rooms, we were invited to hang out, and our ideas were always listened to. We <br/>
had adventures. One night my parents had friends over and they spontaneously <br/>
decided to have breakfast in Montreal. We all packed into the car and went.<br/>
    That respect for us has made a huge difference in my life, especially <br/>
impacting what kind of parent I wanted to be.<br/>
    My mom used to say she liked us more as we got older and could have more <br/>
interesting conversations. We shared books, stories about things we did, <br/>
conversations about politics and the world, and stories of travel. My mom <br/>
always loved to travel, and early in her illness had plans to join my family <br/>
on a trip to Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. Her illness unfortunately <br/>
interfered with her joining us, but she loved hearing about the trip when we <br/>
got back, and especially appreciated our lighting a candle for her at the <br/>
shrine in Fatima, Portugal.                <br/>
    Whatever we talked about, from the time I was very young, I knew I&#39;d be <br/>
listened to completely and with respect.<br/>
    She was a very pragmatic person, and the highest praise she bestowed on <br/>
anything was, &quot;That&#39;s practical.&quot; When she said that in response to telling <br/>
her that qwe&#39;d decided to homeschool my son, I laughed, because &quot;practical&quot; <br/>
was the last thing I thought it might be. But I knew she approved, especially <br/>
when the next thing she said was &quot;It&#39;s too bad we didn&#39;t know about that for <br/>
you.&quot;<br/>
    Even before that, my mother unconditionally supported me when I fell in <br/>
love with my partner, Beth, participating in our union service. She always <br/>
treated Beth like a much-loved daughter-in-law.<br/>
    Over the years my mom has bonded with her grandchildren - over cartoons <br/>
with little Journey, Harry Potter with Sean, and Star Trek with my son <br/>
Julian, who was astounded at how much she knew about it.  One of her concerns <br/>
was that no one would want her huge collection of owls. She was pleased when <br/>
Julian told her he would like to adopt them.<br/>
    In the end, my mother was still helping me learn. A little over a month <br/>
ago, after my sister Cheryl called to tell me my mother&#39;s decision to enter <br/>
hospice, I decided I needed to go help take care of her. It meant taking a <br/>
leave of absence from work and being away from my family, without knowing how <br/>
long. I would just have to trust.<br/>
    Being with my mom as she went through this was the most important thing <br/>
I&#39;ve ever done. I haven&#39;t even begun to realize all I have learned.<br/>
    I&#39;d like to share this poem by John Fox, that I think reflects my how my <br/>
mother was in the world.<br/>
<br/>
When someone deeply listens to you<br/>
It is like holding out a dented cup<br/>
You&#39;ve had since childhood<br/>
And watching it fill up with<br/>
Cold, fresh water.<br/>
When it balances on top of the brim,<br/>
You are understood.<br/>
When it overflows and touches your skin, you are loved.<br/>
When someone deeply listens to you,<br/>
The room where you stay<br/>
Starts a new life<br/>
And the place where you wrote<br/>
Your first poem<br/>
Begins to glow in your mind&#39;s eye.<br/>
It is as if gold has been discovered!<br/>
When someone deeply listens to you,<br/>
Your bare feet are on the earth<br/>
And a beloved land that seemed distant<br/>
Is now at home within you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll miss my mother very much. Thank you.</div>
