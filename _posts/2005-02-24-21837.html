<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303298921">I&#39;m reading Cinema Nirvana, by Dean Sluyter.  It&#39;s subtitle is  <br/>
&quot;Enlightenment Lessons fromt he Movies,&quot; and I&#39;m having a great time with  it.  It&#39;s a <br/>
connect-the-dots idea book full of  trivia, spirituality  and popular culture, my <br/>
favorite subjects!<br/>
 <br/>
I wanted to quote a paragraph for here.  It&#39;s not typical of the whole  book, <br/>
but is interesting on its own merits.  It was in the chapter called  &quot;I <br/>
Believe in America,&quot; which follows the movie &quot;The Godfather,&quot;  though each chapter <br/>
also quotes and connects things other than the particular  movie being <br/>
discussed.      (The *I* was just an  italicized &quot;I&quot; in the book, but I didn&#39;t think <br/>
italics would go through the  e-mail.)<br/>
 <br/>
-=-  It&#39;s pretty easy to see how dangerous &quot;God&#39;s will&quot; is in the  hands of a <br/>
bin Laden or a Bush.  What&#39;s harder to accept is that the danger  can start <br/>
with a Gandhi or a Dr. King.  If you say God tells you to treat  others with <br/>
decency and compassion, why can&#39;t I say God tells me to fly planes  into <br/>
buildings?  Who&#39;s going to adjudicate, who&#39;s going to listen to both  of our <br/>
answering machines and decide who got the right message?  That&#39;s why  *I* believe in <br/>
America.  Not so much America as a place, but the America of  the mind, the <br/>
place within us (no matter where we live) where we don&#39;t have to  bend the knee <br/>
to anyone&#39;s invented king, whether on the earth or in the sky,  where we treat <br/>
others with decency and compassion because that&#39;s what we freely  choose--and <br/>
where Tom Paine and Chuck Berry, Walt  Whitman and Susan B.  Anthony, Emily <br/>
Dickinson and Henry Thoreau, Frederick Douglass and Alfred E.  Neuman, Mae West <br/>
and Lenny Bruce all teach us in various ways to shake our booty  for freedom.  <br/>

 <br/>
It&#39;s a fun book with serious bits of Buddhist teachings and Bible  quotes and <br/>
quotes from rock&#39;n&#39;roll songs and movies.  As parenting books go  (it isn&#39;t <br/>
one), it&#39;s like Whole Child, Whole Parent.  The writing is not as  dainty as <br/>
Berrend&#39;s (who is addressing parents of newborns and toddlers), but it  uses the <br/>
same style of varied sources, and calls forth the same  mindfulness and <br/>
attention.   <br/>
 <br/>
 I really like Dean Sluyter&#39;s other books, Why the Chicken Crossed the  Road <br/>
and The Zen Commandments, so I ordered this one before it came out and got  it <br/>
last week.  It went on sale Tuesday.  There&#39;s more info and some  quotes at<br/>
_http://deansluyter.com_ (http://deansluyter.com) <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easy to have thoughts sparkling like fireworks, reading this  stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
The movies he&#39;s chosen to use (though many others are referenced) are <br/>
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs<br/>
THe Biig Sleep<br/>
Independence Day<br/>
The Graduate<br/>
Easy Rider<br/>
Jaws<br/>
The Truman Show<br/>
Memento<br/>
The Godfather<br/>
Goldfinger<br/>
Invasion of the Body Snatchers<br/>
Fistful of Dollars<br/>
Jailhouse Rock<br/>
A Night at the Opera<br/>
Casablanca<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve read half the book, but not the first half straight.   I&#39;m  going to the <br/>
chapters on movies I liked best first.  Some films I  haven&#39;t seen, and I <br/>
might want to watch them before reading those chapters(or  not).  When I&#39;ve <br/>
finished the whole book I&#39;ll probably put a review at  Amazon.  <br/>
 <br/>
I love this stuff!!<br/>
