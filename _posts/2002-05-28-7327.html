<div id="ygrps-yiv-54946693">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
First a citrus story. My little guy got sprayed with a &quot;safe and non toxic&quot; <br/>
citrus air freshener. He shreaked so loud I could barely get near him to <br/>
help. As I figured out what happened, I read the label, cold water and soap <br/>
to remove, so into the tub he went to get off this oily mess. His sister was <br/>
showing him how neat the tiny drops looked. He got it on his thigh, he was <br/>
sitting on the toilet. In the eye and I&#39;m wondering if he would still see. <br/>
His skin flared up red and swollen and he said he thought he was dying. As <br/>
much as I love low toxic stuff, citrus oil is powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Now my newest twist. Ashley has asked to try school. She will be 8 in <br/>
October, heading into 3rd grade in the fall she says. So, now what. I always <br/>
told myself school may be part of our unschooling journey if the kids ask to <br/>
go. Before I talk deep with her about this issue, I was hoping for some <br/>
great talking here about the pros and cons of trying school as an <br/>
unschooling family. Has anyone here experienced school for a trial? I&#39;m <br/>
wondering what she thinks she needs from school? She does play with lots of <br/>
schooled kids and this may be the source of her curiousity. Part of me is <br/>
game for trying, another part says once she starts she may never come back <br/>
home to us. And I bet her brother will want to try too, he would be K and I <br/>
really want him to stay home. He is one of those big moving boys, he would <br/>
find himself constantly remindered to sit and be quiet. He also does not <br/>
seperate well from me unless he decides to go somewhere. Just as we think <br/>
all is well, change again. I have 10 weeks or so to work this issue through.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to you soon,<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That would be something to ask her.  When my son was 2nd grade age, he asked<br/>
about it.  He said, &quot;Mommy, I think I&#39;m smart enough to go to school.&quot;  !!!!<br/>
Poor little guy had gotten the idea -- probably from his Little League<br/>
teammates -- that he wasn&#39;t in school because he was dumb.  So, (taking a<br/>
deep breath) I asked him what he thought they did in first and second grade;<br/>
he didn&#39;t know.  I told him mostly what they did was teach the kids to read.<br/>
I asked, &quot;Do you know how to read?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, looking at me like I<br/>
was an idiot, since he&#39;d been reading since he was 4.  &quot;Then what would you<br/>
do all day, while they teach the other kids to read?&quot;  &quot;Oh.  Okay!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was it.  I had no idea he even thought about school until then.  His<br/>
Little League pals thought it was their right to quiz him, of course, and<br/>
they were all most anxious about multiplication, so they&#39;d ask him to solve<br/>
big long problems they themselves weren&#39;t up to.  Stinkers!  (It never got<br/>
better, btw... 2 seasons later, Alex walked off the team because of their<br/>
harassment, despite his love for baseball.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both of my dds asked me at different times if they could go to school also. I too wondered why they would want to go. So, I asked, of course fearing the same things as you. But their answers surprised me. My oldest dd, 11 at the time, told me she just wondered what it was like. She thought she might have fun there. My youngest dd, 8 at the time, told me that she would like to make more friends and that school is fun, so it seemed like a great place to make friends. While I always try to let my children be a part of their education, I didn&#39;t feel that they were able to make a choice like this one. Perhaps many of you will disagree with this. But I felt that this was one decision they didn&#39;t have the ability to choose. It was mine and my dh who decided they should not go. But I did tell them about school. We told them what kids do in school all day. We also told them that we valued their opinions, but that in this case we felt that we were better able to make this choice for them. They were very ok with it. Neither one of them even seemed to care that we had said no. They both just said, ok, and went off and played. At the end of this school year, we had our annual evaluation, done by a certified teacher. It went very well. We met the teacher at the school she works, in her classroom. She was very nice and friendly with all of us. And she seemed very positive about homeschoolers. My oldest dd told me that she was so worried that the teacher would make her stay, and that she would have to go to school. Hmmmm, quite a change in just 1 year. My youngest dd, told me that she never wanted to have a teacher do an evaluation again, she said she couldn&#39;t believe that kids had to go to that place and stay all day, every day. She said it felt like she was in a prison or hospital. She said that she felt very sorry for those kids in the ps. Again, I was surprised at what 1 year did. <br/>
<br/>
I think that homeschool kids, perhaps not all, wonder at some time, what it would be like. They know that alot of kids go away to school. So they think there might be something they are missing. See, homeschooled kids, especially Unschooled kids, think school is fun. They think learning is an enjoyable thing. It&#39;s hard for them to imagine that there are kids who don&#39;t want to learn, that hate school. <br/>
<br/>
IMHO I would say don&#39;t let your daughter experiment with this. If you truly feel that you are doing the best thing for her, by homeschooling/unschooling, then you should talk to her. See if you can find out why she wants to go. Perhaps it&#39;s just curiosity, and you can talk with her to help her understand what the reality of ps. But I wouldn&#39;t let her go. Remember you are the parent and not all choices should be made by her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404485110">Sean wanted to go to school this time last year. When I questioned him, he<br/>
said he wanted to see the new wing at the school (he was there K-2nd grade),<br/>
he wanted to go to recess and see his friends, and he wanted to be the<br/>
oldest there (as a fifth grader). Dh and I decided that none of those<br/>
reasons were good enough to change our entire lifestyle to accommodate his<br/>
request. I did arrange more playdates with old school friends, and offered<br/>
to go up and tour the school with him (he declined). By the time school<br/>
started last fall, he wasn&#39;t talking about it anymore. A few weeks ago (I<br/>
may have posted this already) when I was describing a typical school day, he<br/>
thought it sounded like something the Taliban would organize. Big difference<br/>
in a year!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose I would try to get a feeling for just how much she understands<br/>
about what happens in school,  about how long the days are, about having<br/>
to raise your hand to talk or pee or get a drink.  I&#39;m guessing her<br/>
friends who go to school tell her the fun stuff that happens during the<br/>
fifteen minute recess but don&#39;t talk that much about what goes on the<br/>
rest of the time.   Does she know about homework and having to keep quiet<br/>
and not being able to dye her hair blue?( One of Dylan&#39;s friends was sent<br/>
home this year because she dyed the tips of her blond hair blue.)<br/>
<br/>
There is maybe no way you can make her aware of these things without it<br/>
seeming like a kind of brainwashing, but then she&#39;ll get that anyway if<br/>
she goes to school, just in a different fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Is there one little friend she&#39;s especially close with and would like<br/>
more time with? <br/>
Summer vacation might take care of that.  Or maybe she could join<br/>
something else the friend is in, gymnastics or campfire or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember where or when I read it, maybe on a list somewhere but a<br/>
mother equated school with a toxic waste dump.  She said she wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
her kid play at the one, so why would she let her play at the other?  <br/>
Maybe not everyone feels school is as bad as a toxic waste dump, but if<br/>
we didn&#39;t all have our suspicions, we wouldn&#39;t have bothered to keep our<br/>
kids out in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
Is there not enough going on at home that&#39;s interesting to her?  I<br/>
remember we had to try so hard during the summer my dad was sick, to find<br/>
and do interesting things, because we were so busy caring for him.   I<br/>
know it was a hard summer for Dylan, because we just couldn&#39;t take off<br/>
and go like we usually can.   If you do a lot of wonderful things this<br/>
summer and listen to her ideas about what other wonderful things she&#39;d<br/>
like to do when summer&#39;s over, maybe home is where she&#39;ll want to be.   <br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;ve said she sometimes has conflicts with her brother, does she<br/>
feel like school would be an easy way to get a break from him?  Could she<br/>
be using the school idea to get more of your attention if she feels like<br/>
too much of it is going to little brother?   Is something happening at<br/>
home that she&#39;d like to get away from?  ( did my mother secretly move in<br/>
with you??)  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my son would have been in grade 7, he announced that he was thinking <br/>
of school for the next year.  I arranged for him to go for 3 days.  He <br/>
actually liked it and wanted to go the next year.  We told him that he <br/>
could go if he was near grade level in the basics.  He had only barely <br/>
learned to read a little bit by then.  I was really uncomfortable with the <br/>
idea of sending him to middle school barely reading and writing, not just <br/>
because it would have been hard for him.  I also didn&#39;t want to give the <br/>
teacher&#39;s union any ammunition against homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
He did little towards getting better at reading and writing, and it didn&#39;t <br/>
come up again by the time school started the next year.  About mid-year, he <br/>
started again saying that he wanted to try it.  We told him he could, but <br/>
that he had to do school-at-home for a month first.  I set up a schedule as <br/>
much like school as I could.  At first he really got into it, but it wasn&#39;t <br/>
long before we were fighting about it.  (I know, I should have just backed <br/>
off then.)  I finally decided that it was up to him to decide whether he <br/>
was ready for high school (grade 9).  At that point his academic skills <br/>
were only slightly better.  He kept me on edge till the very end of summer <br/>
before deciding he wouldn&#39;t go.<br/>
<br/>
My granddaughter insisted this winter that she wanted to try school, so my <br/>
daughter set up a trial.  She went to grade 2 for a week.  Her take on <br/>
school?  Her teacher was mean, and it was boring.  She liked recess and <br/>
lunch, but not well enough to keep going.  My daughter told her that she <br/>
could call home if she wasn&#39;t happy there, but the teacher wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
her.  Even when she brought a note saying that she should be allowed to <br/>
call, the teacher wouldn&#39;t let her.  This woman was actually the perfect <br/>
teacher for a kid that you hope will choose homeschooling.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Both kids may decide not to go when the time comes, but even if they go, it <br/>
isn&#39;t likely to hold their interest for long if they have interesting <br/>
things to do at home and friends to interact with when they want to.<br/>
Another thing to consider is whether they&#39;re just wanting to ride the <br/>
school bus, or get a bunch of school supplies.  Sometimes it&#39;s as simple as <br/>
taking bus rides and buying a bunch of school supplies for them.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651060044">Hello all -<br/>
Dd (7) here wanted to pursue school out of curiosity too....she thought it <br/>
would be fun since she has &#39;seen&#39; school on tv....pretty benign and some <br/>
social time....<br/>
<br/>
I checked into the local school about her visiting but it was a no <br/>
go....(can&#39;t have strangers popping in and out - too disruptive)......I then <br/>
checked about us visiting the private schools in the area....that seemed to <br/>
be more do-able since we would be potential customers.....<br/>
<br/>
In the end, if there is such a thing, we have some days where I drive down <br/>
the street  and pick them up in the &#39;bus&#39; and take them to &#39;school&#39; via a <br/>
drive around the neighborhood....then we have &#39;fieldtrips&#39; and when we return <br/>
home I switched from Sally the busdriver to Mom asking about her day and <br/>
seeing if she wants a snack before starting homework.....<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that she will again express an interest in &#39;going&#39; to school....and <br/>
we can explore that again......I really trust her sense that she would figure <br/>
out that it is not how she wants to spend her time every day....<br/>
<br/>
best wishes....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935386965">Hi Mary,<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility is for you to plan something big for that &quot;Back to<br/>
School&quot; time. I used to know a family in Alaska that went on vacation a few<br/>
days before school started in their neighborhood. Often, it extended into<br/>
that first week of school. That way, all the newness - the stuff that<br/>
sometimes seems fun to kids - is somewhat routine by the time they get back.<br/>
Remind Ashley that these are the same kids complaining and calling it a<br/>
prison to each other. It&#39;s often just a rivalry thing....&quot;be true to your<br/>
school&quot; &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s an opportunity to explain to the kids that people often<br/>
feel like they have to defend their choices when someone swims against the<br/>
flow. You might see what part she plays in those conversations. Michael<br/>
would often get argumentative with the other kids, trying to get them to see<br/>
that they had no choice and he did. His part in it all really kept the<br/>
argument alive, instead of letting it just die out. Wonder where he got that<br/>
argumentative nature??? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Another Alaskan thing we used to do was a big NOT-Back to School park day<br/>
that lasted all day. We&#39;d sleep in, have a big breakfast. Call it a<br/>
Celebrate Freedom! Breakfast &lt;g&gt;. Talk about the fun stuff that we were<br/>
going to do that year. Feel sorry for the kids that had to be carted away<br/>
for another year. &lt;eg&gt; Then trek over to play all day with our friends at<br/>
the park. That was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Plan something fun for that time.  Wanna come out to Texas? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Take care!<br/>

wondering<br/>
about the weather. I was thinking March after Snowboarding Season here<br/>
(OH).<br/>
Would this be a good time, weather wise? Should we wait? What&#39;s been<br/>
your<br/>
experience?<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>

Take care!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33855216">Well I have a friend that moved to Spring, TX last year. I&#39;d like to visit<br/>
her. :-) I would like to go to San Antonio, maybe. Austin looks like it is<br/>
even closer to Spring. Texas is so huge. Each would be at lease a days<br/>
drive. Wouldn&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
 Where in Louisiana are a must see? My boys and I are really looking forward<br/>
to seeing more of our country before my oldest (16) doesn&#39;t want to anymore.<br/>
Thanks for your he*lp.:-)<br/>

No offense intended to any of my fellow Texans, but having lived 9 years<br/>
in Houston, it&#39;s the last place in Texas I&#39;d go for a vacation.  Do you<br/>
have some reason you need to go to Houston as opposed to more pleasant<br/>
Texas cities?  The humidity is frequently 97 and even 100%, and very<br/>
hot.  Hot and very humid is as bad as it gets weather-wise.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
said that Houston has all the bad traits of a big city (traffic, crime,<br/>
pollution) without any of the good traits (public transportation, great<br/>
museums, etc).  I will give Houston this, though - the commercial<br/>
architecture is very cool!  Now, Austin and San Antonio - those are<br/>
awesome Texas cities to visit.  But I can&#39;t go back to Texas without<br/>
venturing to the particularly charming Louisiana!<br/>

in a heartbeat)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Another Alaskan thing we used to do was a big NOT-Back to School park day<br/>
 that lasted all day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, it wasn&#39;t an Alaskan thing down here, but we did have a couple of those <br/>
parties too. It was kinda fun, just celebrating that we didn&#39;t have to do the <br/>
school thing!!<br/>
One of them was at a big lake and we hiked in the woods, ate and swam all day.<br/>
If fact (linking back to another discussion) that&#39;s where I saw my first <br/>
Banana spider...I have pictures of it too!!<br/>
