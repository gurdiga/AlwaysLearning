<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549601155">Thanks for this link - it was helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed a couple of people referencing hip-hop music as well - I <br/>
looked it up on wikipedia, and it seems to have a strong similarity <br/>
with rap.  Am I correct on this one?  Any recommendations there?  <br/>
<br/>
My son is very sensitive, and doesn&#39;t like emotionally &quot;heavy&quot; music, <br/>
but something upbeat, fun, humorous without being &quot;childlike&quot; (his <br/>
term).  He has a very wry sense of humor, and likes subtle wordplay...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136505134">I think the album I was thinking of is &quot;Three feet high and rising&quot; by<br/>
de la soul and amazon lists the album as rap/hip hop.  I can&#39;t quite<br/>
remember, though.  It has great reviews at amazon and it is one of the<br/>
groups recommended in that list so it might be good to check it out in<br/>
spite of my poor memory.<br/>
<br/>
No clue how genre is decided :)<br/>

<br/>
I am not sure about rap music specifically for kids, my son has always listened to all kinds of music, some of it is kinda raunchy, but we just talk about it.  If you are looking for something clean Will Smith/Fresh Prince only does clean stuff and it usually has a good beat.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509116895">Tobymac is a Christian hip hop artist whose latest music often crosses<br/>
over into pop and rock. His older stuff, especially with his first group<br/>
dcTalk, was much more rap oriented, and his second solo album Diverse<br/>
City was as well. Here are some of the most hip hop/rap stuff of his<br/>
that I&#39;m familiar with (and I&#39;m much more partial to the rock sound with<br/>
rapping and just a touch of scratching):<br/>

When a big kid hits a little kid on the playground, we call him a bully;<br/>
five years later he punches a woman for her wallet and is called a mugger;<br/>
later still, when he slugs a fellow worker who insults him, he is called a<br/>
troublemaker, but when he becomes a father and hits his tiresome,<br/>
disobedient or disrespectful child, we call him a disciplinarian. Why is<br/>
this rung on a ladder of interpersonal violence regarded so differently from<br/>
the rest? ~ Penelope Leach<br/>
 Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and<br/>
affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is<br/>
more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present. <br/>
<br/>
~ Jean Baptiste Lacordaire<br/>
