&gt; saying, <br/>
&gt; &quot;You don&#39;t get to study insects this year, that&#39;s not until 3rd <br/>
&gt; grade.&quot; Major <br/>
&gt; improvement.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes!  I didn&#39;t mean don&#39;t notice.&lt;g&gt;  My son is wild about insects and<br/>
can name and tell something interesting about almost every bug he sees. <br/>
When we saw that he really was fascinated we showed him where the field<br/>
guide was and how to use it.  He takes it everywhere with him,  but we<br/>
didn&#39;t make him sit down and label all the parts of a mosquito. (<br/>
although I&#39;d bet he can! )  When I notice someone giving a talk on bugs I<br/>
tell him about it and if he wants to go, we do.  When the museum in<br/>
Bozeman had a bug show and giant robot bugs, ( very cool!) there we were.<br/>
 If I find a book I think he&#39;d like, I get it.  But there are no<br/>
requirements.  That&#39;s much different from the spelling words and essays. <br/>
We don&#39;t squash spiders, we take them to Dylan to find out what they are.<br/>
 He identified the mosquito&#39;s we grew in a backyard bucket. <br/>
