I have used this site extensively over the past week for many of my questions concerning carpentry and painting, but it seems to have solutions to thousands of how-to questions, and not just about homes and decorating.  Check it out.  You might like it.<br/>

  Good luck on your tiling.  I bet you don&#39;t chicken out on Thursday. ;o)<br/>
