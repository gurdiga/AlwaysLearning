<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065458768">Hi,<br/>
 Out from lurking. I got this on another list.<br/>
<br/>
Tanya<br/>
<br/>
From another list:<br/>
<br/>
Marilyn Vos Savant, who Guiness Book of World Records lists as having the<br/>
highest IQ of any living person, has a column that appears in Parade, a<br/>
weekly supplement that appears in many newspapers nationwide. In the latest<br/>
issue, the following question about home school was asked by a reader of her<br/>
column:<br/>
<br/>
Reader:  My husband and I are thinking of home-schooling. Do you recommend<br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
Marilyn:  I believe that traditional homeschooling (one parent stays home to<br/>
teach all children in the family up through the high school years) can be a<br/>
fine alternative to an unacceptable public school, but I would not recommend<br/>
it broadly unless most schools were inadequate and most parents could teach<br/>
everything from literature to physics. And I don&#39;t believe that either is<br/>
true<br/>
<br/>
If home-schooling were institutionalized, half of the youthful potential of<br/>
Americans would go unfulfilled. Say that a bright young parent sacrifices a<br/>
rewarding career to stay home and teach the children. When those children<br/>
grow up, would half of them (one parent from each married couple) also<br/>
sacrifice their potential to stay home and teach their own children? If so,<br/>
then much of the result of home- schooling would be the creation of more<br/>
home-schooling parents for the next generation, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe home-schoolers can justify this loss. If so, please write. I believe<br/>
that home-schooling is a noble experiment done for the right reasons, and I<br/>
hope to hear why it may prove to be a success.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713751212">Sorry, but I think she&#39;s an idiot (idiot savant? &lt;beg&gt;)<br/>
She is asked (or prints) alot of questions that have nothing to do with a<br/>
high IQ. Lots of emotional type answers required. I personally think she has<br/>
no common sense.<br/>

I SO agree that just because she scores high on tests doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s Ann <br/>
Landers (in any positive ways).  <br/>

People should ask her about multiple intelligences, and how she does at <br/>
