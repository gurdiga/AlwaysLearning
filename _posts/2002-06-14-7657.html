I know our chips are their &quot;crisps,&quot; and our cookies are their biscuits.  Our <br/>
biscuits are their scones (SORT of--scones are better than our biscuits).<br/>

Our does-not-exist are their crackers.  Crackers are tissue-wrapped breakaway <br/>

I asked my mom once if she had ever ridden in a covered wagon, and she said <br/>

<br/>
Not a great answer, since it caused me not to ask my grandmothers, and one of <br/>
them had moved from Texas to New Mexico in a covered wagon, and my <br/>
grandfather on the other side had come from somewhere SE (northern Alabama?) <br/>
to Oklahoma and then Texas the same way.   <br/>
<br/>
My mom SHOULD have said, &quot;No, but my dad did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I never asked my dad&#39;s mom.  I found out years later.  She was still <br/>
alive.  But it would have been cool, when I was little, to have heard her <br/>
stories of moving when SHE was little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129367978">In my town we have the George Washington Carver<br/>
national monument  and every year they have a covered<br/>
wagon ride available the second weekend in september <br/>
plus cover wagon races.   Once you ride in a covered<br/>
wagon  you will understand why it took so long for<br/>
them to get anywhere.  30 minutes in a covered wagon<br/>
will give most people a severe headache/neckache from<br/>
all the bouncing around.  It is very very hot inside<br/>
the covered wagon so  most people who were able would<br/>
walk next to the wagon most of the time.   We have<br/>
friendly Amish people around here who provide the<br/>
wagons and the horses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122684907">For those that don&#39;t know, I&#39;m a recent transplant from the suburbs to the<br/>
country. And I mean country! Our little community doesn&#39;t make most maps and<br/>
has only fruit stands, orchards, and a little Baptist Church.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was typing away online last week, and the kids came running in<br/>
saying there was a wagon train out front. Sure enough, coming up the highway<br/>
were 5 covered wagons and about 15 people on horseback. So, my kids, not<br/>
having an inhibited bone in their body, ran to the property line. The wagon<br/>
train pulled over in the grove of trees just on the other side of the fence.<br/>
Well, with my kids down there meeting strangers (city tendencies kicking in<br/>
for me), I decided, &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll get dressed and see what&#39;s going on.&quot; Sad but<br/>
true, it was nearly noon. &lt;gg&gt; Now, I have not mastered the ability to<br/>
easily climb a barbed wire fence, so I hopped in the van and drove around to<br/>
where they all were. It was the annual 5 day trail ride that preceded the<br/>
Red River Rodeo. OF COURSE! We were clueless, asking a million questions.<br/>
They were very nice. Invited the kids to sign up to do it with them next<br/>
year. Told us all about the parade the next day and who to watch for in the<br/>
rodeo.  The Trail Boss was a younger woman who admitted that she didn&#39;t<br/>
sleep on the trail but went home to see that her daughter got to Summer<br/>
School. Ugh. Anyway, I smiled politely so as not to anger the locals. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a very cool thing to see. And, yes, I think Ron, Alyssa<br/>
and Michael may join them next year. Katie and I will wave to them from the<br/>
porch, sipping our coffee and mochas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457668831">Legs is coming along fine.  He is drinking his goat<br/>
formula every 4 hours, round the clock, but more at<br/>
night as it is too hot in the day. We have a fan<br/>
blowing though a window that opens onto his area. He<br/>
has poop like a human baby, almost the same scent.<br/>
Easy enough to clean up, just pick up the soiled<br/>
portion of hay. <br/>
<br/>
But fleas are a problem.  I put some dog flea stuff on<br/>
him, and I had used a thick coating on borax under the<br/>
hay on the &quot;deer porch&quot; but it is pretty bad already. <br/>
I can&#39;t see them on Legs, but as I feed him, I can see<br/>
them hopping onto me.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
I have now read up on deer and it seems that male deer<br/>
who have been bottle fed and bonded with humans become<br/>
very dangerous during in rut.  It is recommend that<br/>
they be castrated or slaughtered BEFORE that time. <br/>
All the experts say they won&#39;t hurt you, they will<br/>
kill you.  That is all we need, a dangerous animal<br/>
with horns :-(<br/>
<br/>
I talked with an (anonymous) vet....they get in<br/>
trouble even giving advice....and found the goat<br/>
substitute way up it Georgia (none within 50 miles of<br/>
here).  How odd.  Lots of goats around. <br/>
<br/>
DH has a friend who raises deer....that is where his<br/>
are coming from when he&#39;s is really ready....and<br/>
thinks he can take Legs there when he is a little<br/>
older.....but I&#39;m afraid that this person will have to<br/>
kill him.  <br/>
<br/>
Bottle fed by humans bucks don&#39;t make good pets, when<br/>
they reach rut age. They can&#39;t be turned out to a<br/>
domestic herd either, as they can&#39;t be herded...they<br/>
always go the wrong way...and they still will kill<br/>
humans when in rut.<br/>
<br/>
Still wonder why DH brought Legs home. He is a lot of<br/>
work to take care of and then have to kill. It is just<br/>
too sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312596861">Have you talked to or read articles from many people<br/>
who have raised orphan deer?    People (mostly vets<br/>
and conservation agents and animal rehabilitators have<br/>
told me that none of my animals would ever be good as<br/>
pets or be able to go back to the wild.  I realise my<br/>
animals were all of the small variety  but the only<br/>
problem any of my animals ever caused  was that one of<br/>
the raccoons I raised  once broke into a house by<br/>
ripping the screen out of the door and went in and<br/>
opened the freezer side of the fridge  and ate all the<br/>
ice cream they had,  and left. (meanwhile the family<br/>
was calling the police from the bedroom  reporting a<br/>
burglar)  This was a couple of years after the raccoon<br/>
had been released into the wild  and the only reason<br/>
anyone thought it was Mandy was that she was always<br/>
breaking into our house and getting icecream out of<br/>
our freezer  when we had her.   The squirrel I raised<br/>
this spring and recently released already met and<br/>
joined a squirrel family around here  which everyone<br/>
said wasn;t possible.  Anyway sometimes animals dont<br/>
act like everyone says they will.   Or you could start<br/>
looking up and contacting zoos  and find out if any<br/>
will take an orphaned deer   I had to do that with a<br/>
male iguana that bit the end of my husbands finger off<br/>
 because the iguana thought I was his female and<br/>
decided to challenge my male.<br/>

&gt; already. <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t see them on Legs, but as I feed him, I can<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; them hopping onto me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have now read up on deer and it seems that male<br/>
&gt; deer<br/>
&gt; who have been bottle fed and bonded with humans<br/>
&gt; become<br/>
&gt; very dangerous during in rut.  It is recommend that<br/>
&gt; they be castrated or slaughtered BEFORE that time. <br/>
&gt; All the experts say they won&#39;t hurt you, they will<br/>
&gt; kill you.  That is all we need, a dangerous animal<br/>
&gt; with horns :-(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I talked with an (anonymous) vet....they get in<br/>
&gt; trouble even giving advice....and found the goat<br/>
&gt; substitute way up it Georgia (none within 50 miles<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; here).  How odd.  Lots of goats around. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DH has a friend who raises deer....that is where his<br/>
&gt; are coming from when he&#39;s is really ready....and<br/>
&gt; thinks he can take Legs there when he is a little<br/>
&gt; older.....but I&#39;m afraid that this person will have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; kill him.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bottle fed by humans bucks don&#39;t make good pets,<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; they reach rut age. They can&#39;t be turned out to a<br/>
&gt; domestic herd either, as they can&#39;t be herded...they<br/>
&gt; always go the wrong way...and they still will kill<br/>
&gt; humans when in rut.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still wonder why DH brought Legs home. He is a lot<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; work to take care of and then have to kill. It is<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; too sad.<br/>

life specialist who will raise him appropriately, either for a zoo or to<br/>
be returned to the wild. .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470533634">Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told that diatomaceous earth, available at any pool supply store,<br/>
is great to get rid of anything with an exoskeleton.  To us it is a soft<br/>
powder but to insects it is like walking through shards of glass.  I&#39;ve<br/>
bought my bag but haven&#39;t got it spread around yet.<br/>

<br/>
We have used Lamb replacer with good success with our goats.  It may be<br/>
easier to find.  There is also a good supply place<br/>
www.hoeggersupplycompany.com that may be able to get some to you.<br/>

Sounds pretty usefull. <br/>
<br/>
How does it affect the good guys?  Ladybugs,<br/>
butterflies, moths, lizards, toads, frogs, snakes,<br/>
birds etc., kittens, fawn&#39;s eyes, lungs.  Our eyes,<br/>
lungs?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for help.<br/>
