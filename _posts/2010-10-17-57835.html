<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069613617">Thanks Robin, this is parenting manual in a nutshell:<br/>
&quot;Be on <br/>
your kid&#39;s side, always. Help her negotiate tricky situations. Be her <br/>
advocate to help her get what she wants, in appropriate ways. Talk <br/>
with her afterward and brainstorm ways to do better the next time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful for this today as I wrestle with how to do exactly this (and also wrestle with my people pleaser baggage).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199523851">yes i am going to keep this at the forefront of my mind ALWAYS, &quot;be on your kid&#39;s side&quot;.  she is my daughter and i may not always get it right but i am trying my very best to do the best i can for her. i am a total people pleaser and realise that about myself (glad to hear i am not the only one) but i have taken this way of life and must try harder to overcome my feelings in a situation and realise they are MY feelings.   <br/>
the sash has been lost a couple of weeks and i need to get her a new one but money is tight and we need to wait a bit until we hear about my husband&#39;s job.  it was more important on the night in question because of the smart brownie badge.<br/>

If you&#39;re sure it&#39;s in the house, finding it might be better, if it  <br/>
had any badges on it.<br/>
Trust, confidence...  those are important.  (It&#39;s important to trust  <br/>
in yourself, and haveconfidence in yourself, too.)<br/>
