<div id="ygrps-yiv-816850444">Melinda - I am tongue tied.  It&#39;s never affected my speech, except that I am<br/>
unable to trill my r&#39;s.  My daughter is tt too, and it&#39;s not causing her any<br/>
problems either.  Every doctor she&#39;s ever seen has mentioned that they could<br/>
clip it if we&#39;d like.  WHY???  I&#39;d say the only disadvantage is that my<br/>
tongue gets sore when I eat an ice cream cone :0). ~Rue</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146766346">Hi All.<br/>
<br/>
I was taught in college biology that the ability to<br/>
roll r&#39;s was genetic.  Something like 8 in 10 can.  No<br/>
real effort if you are one of the 8. More than<br/>
challenging if you are one of the 2.  Can&#39;t confirm<br/>
that is accurate info. as research changes may have<br/>
been updated in the last 15 years.  But maybe this is<br/>
not one they grow out of- but just a pre-determined<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
I can RRRRRRrrrrrrrrRRRRR from here to Sunday.  I am<br/>
also one of those children who had an attached tongue<br/>
at the bottom.(I hate the term &quot;tongue tied&quot;; sounds<br/>
like you have a fear of speaking.)  That attached<br/>
tongue is an inherited trait.  2 of my 4 children have<br/>
it. When they were infants, my mother suggested that I<br/>
should &quot;just have them clipped&quot; as she had done with<br/>
me @ 6 months.  At the family docs direction.  And,<br/>
&quot;Look how well you speak.&quot;   Her fear did not convince<br/>
me anymore than it had on other parenting issues she<br/>
disagreed with me on.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what do you know.  My 2 with the &quot;handicap&quot; are<br/>
now 6 and 10.  Neither had any real difficulties<br/>
pronouncing any sounds.  Their eccentricities of<br/>
speech lasted about as long as those of my 16 and 11<br/>
yo&#39;s with the &quot;normal&quot; tongues.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if they can roll the RRRrrrrrrr&#39;s but,<br/>
aside from not being able to stick their tongues out<br/>
to touch their noses, I don&#39;t see any permanent<br/>
disadvantage.  They did avoid the trauma of being cut<br/>
on in the mouth as an infant.  Which has to be a<br/>
psychic plus.<br/>
<br/>
I should also say that my 10 yo has mild to moderate<br/>
hearing loss in both ears as a result of antibiotics<br/>
he was given as a preemie. (They quite commonly lead<br/>
to nerve damage.) Yet, I had to Insist that our<br/>
Pediatrician give him a hearing test to diagnose the<br/>
loss when he was 4. (The screenings done as an infant<br/>
were in a normal range.  It&#39;s harder to detect<br/>
specific tone deficiencies when they are younger.) I<br/>
knew he was missing some sounds....   miss hearing<br/>
certain letters...  She was astounded when the results<br/>
came back confirming my suspicion.  Because- he speaks<br/>
so well. Perfectly by her standards. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s the 3rd child.  I did nothing different with him.<br/>
 We just talk so damn much that I think it&#39;s a matter<br/>
of practice, practice, practice around here. He was a<br/>
high needs baby and toddler ... still is some days. <br/>
So, maybe all the Required attention did increase his<br/>
&quot;talking lessons&quot;.  But mostly I think it&#39;s because we<br/>
are a family of talkers.  Some families are Huge<br/>
Go-ers, Readers, Doers, Athletes, etc........<br/>
<br/>
We all talk.  A lot.  All the time.  I love when I<br/>
have time to myself because it is always noisy here<br/>
from all the talking.  But, I do know that that is how<br/>
much of the learning occurs in our family. Discussions<br/>
of information.  Verbal analyzing.  Thoughtful debate.<br/>
Story telling, Role playing, etc........<br/>
<br/>
I chalk up the lack of any sound attainment<br/>
difficulties to sheer VOLUME. Most of us are<br/>
proficient at what we do the most.<br/>
<br/>
And as was previously noted, how many adults can&#39;t<br/>
make certain sounds?   Not too many. I think most kids<br/>
learn as they need to and develop strategies for<br/>
themselves that work for them in mastering language.<br/>
<br/>
On TV:<br/>
<br/>
Hi Lisa. And any others who still struggle with this<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Having been there/done that and figured it out-for us<br/>
anyway- just an observation or 2.  <br/>
<br/>
**What if you REALLY didn&#39;t pay attention to the tv<br/>
viewing.   What if it REALLY wasn&#39;t an issue for you.<br/>
<br/>
You say that you &quot;allow him complete access&quot; <br/>
And that you have exhausted your creative abilities in<br/>
trying to offer him alternatives to tv viewing.<br/>
<br/>
Can you just STOP trying to lure him away?  Can you<br/>
forget about it as an issue?  Not count the tv time or<br/>
think of it as wasted? <br/>
<br/>
Because, while you may not be forcing him to turn it<br/>
off, you are surely invested in trying to deter and<br/>
decrease his viewing.  And he knows it.  He knows by<br/>
your reaction when he does something else.  Your : )<br/>
tells him.  He knows by the anxious looks you send him<br/>
when he&#39;s zoned out for the 4th hour in a row.  He<br/>
knows by the stress that has to be coming in loud and<br/>
clear to him- as it&#39;s clear as crystal in your post. <br/>
He knows.<br/>
<br/>
We did have this issue when we started to unschool.  I<br/>
imagine we still would if I hadn&#39;t REALLY committed<br/>
myself to letting it go.  You might judge that we have<br/>
it now if you came on a day when TV was what held<br/>
their interest.  It&#39;s 101 degrees here today, same as<br/>
yesterday.  TV is more enjoyable than anything outside<br/>
right now.  But, it may be left off all day when we<br/>
get down to outside play temps again. Or if they are<br/>
making caves out of blankets or playing cards or.....<br/>
<br/>
More likely, it gets turned on, looked at for a bit<br/>
and then they wander off and go do something else.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s clear to me that no one is watching, I&#39;ll flip<br/>
it off.  Usually, I put in a cd when I do as the<br/>
stereo is connected to the tv for better sound. I take<br/>
a turn with music.<br/>
<br/>
I NEVER make them turn off when they are watching.  If<br/>
we have an event scheduled or I want to do something<br/>
because I want to do it, I will say... Time to go...<br/>
and they leave it voluntarily.<br/>
<br/>
They know there will never again be a tv rationing so<br/>
it&#39;s easy to leave when other things come up that<br/>
interest them. Like food.  Those who have been starved<br/>
or whose food supply is threatened will eat in<br/>
anticipation of the next period of want.<br/>
<br/>
One more consideration: I don&#39;t know what programs<br/>
your son has access to.  <br/>
<br/>
We are in an area with digital, which took us from @<br/>
60 channels to 250 with no additional cost. We now<br/>
have all the Discovery, History, TLC, .........<br/>
multi-Disneys,  all the really cool channels with<br/>
oodles and oodles of choices.  Mucho information and<br/>
topics of interest.<br/>
<br/>
My children have done an immense amount of learning as<br/>
a result of their viewing. They have developed a level<br/>
of animal knowledge that far surpasses mine or their<br/>
dads.  My middle son loves animals and has passed that<br/>
on to the other sibs through his heavy viewing of<br/>
animal programs.  Crocodile Hunter, Jeff Corwin,<br/>
Animal Planet shows.  Bill Nye and other kid friendly<br/>
science programs have spurred on their imaginations<br/>
and interests.  Same for news programs, history<br/>
topics, etc...   <br/>
<br/>
TV has become the poster child for laziness. It is an<br/>
erroneous correlation. There is just as much good<br/>
information  and worthy topics of interest on TV as<br/>
their are in books.  It is in a different form. It<br/>
does require discretion of the viewer. But so do<br/>
books. Many books are not worthy of the trees that<br/>
died for them.  Especially text books.  Can I say<br/>
&quot;YAWN&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
We seem, as a society, to be stuck in that &quot;back in<br/>
the good old days&quot; mind-set where tv is concerned.  <br/>
<br/>
TV and the internet allow all of us a view of the<br/>
world that previous generations could not access.  I<br/>
can get a photo of virtually any place on the planet. <br/>
I don&#39;t have to wonder what the favorite food of<br/>
Aussies is or how to raise a tadpole or what the<br/>
weather is like in Bejing today.  Just go look it up. <br/>
I think it&#39;s Exciting to live in this world we find<br/>
ourselves in.  The Possibilities are Limitless.<br/>
<br/>
TV can be a part of knowing the rest of the world.<br/>
Even most cartoons have a specific world view, whether<br/>
it&#39;s positive or not  ; )  ** What if, instead of<br/>
making your disapproval a standing known entity, you<br/>
asked him what his Favorite show is an made a date to<br/>
watch it with him.  <br/>
<br/>
Make his favorite snack.  Talk about it during<br/>
commercials.  What was funny?   What did you like, not<br/>
like, Why are the characters so _______ whatever they<br/>
are?  What do you think they like to eat, do with<br/>
their parents, etc.............  Support his interest.<br/>
 Let him know that it really is OK with you that he<br/>
likes what interests him.  Even if it is TV.<br/>
<br/>
Then, just leave it alone.  Let it be.  Do your thing.<br/>
 Do the family things and make no judgments on how<br/>
much or what.  Maybe suggest other shows that he might<br/>
like based on his other interests.  <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have access to a multitude of channels,<br/>
check your library.  We went through several series of<br/>
animal and science tapes the kids picked out. And all<br/>
the old favorites I had as a kid. Classics like &quot;Where<br/>
the Wild Things Are&quot;, &quot;Mike Mulligan&quot;, that donut shop<br/>
one where the machine gets stuck, etc...<br/>
<br/>
To me, it sounds more like a power struggle than a TV<br/>
problem.  If the same conditions were applied to<br/>
another activity, you&#39;d likely end up with the same<br/>
result.  He won&#39;t need to hang on to the constant<br/>
viewing if he doesn&#39;t feel that you are Hoping he will<br/>
do something else. He will likely ease up when you do<br/>
.......  Or maybe he will be the next Larry King or<br/>
Tom Brokaw.  <br/>

<br/>
I think the language acquisition theory of any human&#39;s ability to learn any <br/>
human language beat out the genetics theory a long time ago.  <br/>
<br/>
There used to be (in the lifetimes of some of our older grandparents) serious <br/>
thoughts that maybe language came along on its own.  (It&#39;s a stupid and scary <br/>
thought, I know...)  Kind of along the lines of if wolves raised babies they <br/>
would somehow speak ruidimentarily the language of their parents.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that does come from examples of babies who changed languages as <br/>
toddlers and never quite got the nuances.  But that part is explained better <br/>
by the discouragement of &quot;nonsense&quot; sounds and encouragement of &quot;language&quot; <br/>
theory.<br/>

OH never mind.  Those who couldn&#39;t speak the language wouldn&#39;t reproduce as <br/>
