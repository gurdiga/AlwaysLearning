<div id="ygrps-yiv-328505201">Pfizer Corp is making the announcement today that VIAGRA will soon be <br/>
available in liquid form and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power <br/>
beverage suitable for use as a mixer.<br/>
<br/>
Pepsi&#39;s proposed ad campaign claims: It will now be possible for a man to <br/>
literally pour himself a stiff one. Obviously we can no longer call this a <br/>
soft drink.<br/>
<br/>
This additive gives new meaning to the names of cocktails, highballs and <br/>
just a good old fashioned stiff drink. Pepsi will market the new concoction <br/>
by the name of Mount And Do.<br/>
