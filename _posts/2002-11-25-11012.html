&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please excuse the off topic post.  I was a member of this group <br/>
&gt; awhile ago, and as I recall there were some pretty radical TCS <br/>
&gt; adherents at that time.  I just stopped in to invite any TCSers to <br/>
&gt; join a group of homeschool debaters to debate TCS.  We are a group of <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers who like to debate -read argue if you like ;-)   <br/>
&gt; Anyway, most of the members are Christian (be forewarned - lol) and I <br/>
&gt; think it might be fun to spar with such oppositonal view points.  <br/>
&gt; BTW, most members had never even heard of TCS, until I brought up it <br/>
&gt; up as a possible topic for debate.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, if you have a few brave souls who would like to introduce TCS <br/>
&gt; from your viewpoint and stay as long as you&#39;d like to debate- Please <br/>
&gt; Join Us!<br/>

<br/>
Taking Children Seriously: The Final Phase of The Enlightenment<br/>
<br/>
TCS and the future of liberty<br/>
<br/>
Sarah Lawrence                                                 <br/>
<br/>
Taking Children Seriously (TCS) is the name of an organisation I founded to<br/>
promote the Libertarian educational philosophy. <br/>
<br/>
How can there be such a thing as the Libertarian educational philosophy?<br/>
Aren&#39;t parents in a Libertarian society free to educate their children in any<br/>
way they wish? <br/>
<br/>
Yes. But that doesn&#39;t make every possible choice morally right, or best for<br/>
the child, or compatible with the survival of the Libertarian society. To<br/>
satisfy these criteria, we must look more deeply than Libertarian political<br/>
philosophy  which is basically about how a society can run without the<br/>
initiation of physical force. <br/>
<br/>
What justifies both Libertarian political philosophy and TCS education theory<br/>
in my opinion is reason  something which, I fear, has yet to emerge in the<br/>
spheres of education and childrearing. <br/>
<br/>
Many parents do a very good job of bringing their children up to believe in<br/>
authority and obedience to dictators, whether parents or the state. Recently,<br/>
I had the misfortune to be present when someone I know was subjected to a<br/>
violent attack by his parent. I was very shaken and didn&#39;t throw myself<br/>
between my young friend and the angry adult, but I did manage to pluck up the<br/>
courage (once I poked my head up from behind the sofa where I was hiding) to<br/>
express the opinion that hitting children may not be the best way to deal with<br/>
disagreements, and that it may not be entirely morally unobjectionable.<br/>
Perhaps I was less diplomatic than The Parent thought appropriate, because he<br/>
accused me of trying to coerce him into changing his parenting practices, and<br/>
then played the children-are-property card: It&#39;s none of your business how<br/>
I raise my child. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t help wondering whether he would think it none of his business if I<br/>
were to pull out my trusty Smith and Wesson .44 magnum and start shooting at<br/>
his wife. Actually, they don&#39;t get on very well so perhaps that&#39;s a bad<br/>
example. <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I&#39;m glad that when a thug was trying to kill my sister in broad<br/>
daylight on the streets of New York, the bystanders didn&#39;t take that view but<br/>
saved her life by intervening instead. <br/>
<br/>
This Parent went on to say that my friend needed to be taught a lesson. Under<br/>
normal circumstances, since I think that such parents needs to learn better<br/>
ideas about how children learn, I would have removed my belt and offered to<br/>
teach him a lesson if that would help him learn, but in this case, he was<br/>
bigger than me and not living in a Libertarian paradise, I was unarmed. <br/>
<br/>
When I mentioned my little exchange with the parent to a fellow Libertarian a<br/>
few days later, he accused me of wanting to make children wards of the state<br/>
and have Big Brother dictate to us in our own personal affairs. (A bit like<br/>
parents do to their children then. Of course Big Brother is only in charge<br/>
when the parents aren&#39;t there to dictate to the children...) <br/>
<br/>
Now I know this may sound very surprising to those of you who are, at this<br/>
very moment, convinced that ISIL have made a big mistake in asking me to speak<br/>
here, and that you are listening to a rabid statist who wants to take away<br/>
parents&#39; rights, indeed, whose ideas make old Bill  Clinton  look like a<br/>
positive paragon of Libertarian virtue, but if you have jumped to the<br/>
conclusion that I want to take control of children out of the hands of parents<br/>
and put it into Nanny  er, the nanny state, that is, you are very much<br/>
mistaken. <br/>
<br/>
If you were beating your wife for failing to have your socks sorted by colour,<br/>
and I were to express the opinion that that may not be the best way to nurture<br/>
your relationship and might conceivably be the wrong thing to do, would you<br/>
jump to the conclusion that I was arguing that wives should be wards of the<br/>
state? Not unless you are more Neanderthal than your average man in the<br/>
street! You would understand that I was asserting the idea that wives are<br/>
people whose control of their own lives should not be infringed. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I certainly do not think that children should be controlled by the<br/>
state instead of parents. I think that they should control their own lives,<br/>
just as adults do. Indeed, TCS advocates raising children not just without<br/>
beating them but without doing anything to them against their will. <br/>
<br/>
I am not advocating violating parents&#39; legal rights. What I am saying is that<br/>
parents are right to behave in one way which is within their legal rights, and<br/>
wrong to behave in another way which is also within their legal rights. <br/>
<br/>
But what does a particular theory of child-rearing, however right and however<br/>
libertarian in the everyday sense of the word, have to do with Libertarianism,<br/>
the political movement? I can tell from the incensed looks some of you are<br/>
giving me that you remain of the opinion that I&#39;m some sort of PC adult-hating<br/>
leftist do-gooder with a touch too much arrogance for comfort, and that you<br/>
are still asking Aren&#39;t parents in a Libertarian society free to bring up<br/>
their children any way they like? <br/>
<br/>
I can see that some of you are already firmly convinced that TCS must be<br/>
mistaken because according to Libertarian principles, as one of my Libertarian<br/>
friends said to me, If I want to turn off the TV until the kids have done<br/>
their homework, I can. It&#39;s my TV. <br/>
<br/>
But that is confusing right and wrong with legal and illegal. <br/>
<br/>
Now you may say, as my friend did, a trifle testily I thought, But why<br/>
shouldn&#39;t I confuse right and wrong with legal and illegal? I am free to do<br/>
that aren&#39;t I?, and I&#39;ll agree that there should be no legal impediment<br/>
standing in your way here, but is it a good idea? Will it help you meet your<br/>
preferences? Will it make you happy? Will it be right? <br/>
<br/>
When parents say things like I paid for the TV so I can switch it off<br/>
whenever I like they are making the mistake of assuming that you can deduce<br/>
how to treat children  educational theory  from Libertarian principles. <br/>
<br/>
I want to give you some examples to show that that is a grave mistake. I want<br/>
to show that a functioning Libertarian society needs knowledge which isn&#39;t in<br/>
the principles of a Libertarian society. <br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;m going to give you an example to show that a Libertarian society<br/>
won&#39;t survive if they have the wrong educational policy, that is, one that<br/>
doesn&#39;t actually promote Libertarianism in the next generation. <br/>
<br/>
Given that this example will show you a society which adheres completely to<br/>
Libertarian principles but isn&#39;t viable, I am hoping that you will be<br/>
persuaded that Libertarian principles alone are not enough to make a society<br/>
viable. <br/>
<br/>
For a Libertarian society to survive and flourish, it must have a way of<br/>
passing its ideas on to the next generation. Obviously, there&#39;s nothing<br/>
automatic about survival. I once had a particularly pleasant dream in which I<br/>
and a bunch of frightfully agreeable Libertarians bought a beautiful tropical<br/>
island, declared independence and were living in freedom for ever. When I was<br/>
rudely awoken at the unearthly hour of nine o&#39;clock in the morning by my<br/>
neighbour having an argument with the gardener outside, I realised that not<br/>
only am I not living in my perfect Libertarian society, it was tipping down<br/>
with rain and I had to get to the Post Office to send off my tax return... <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, imagine a group of Libertarians who somehow get political independence<br/>
on an island where they create their own ideal Libertarian society. <br/>
<br/>
According to the principles of Libertarianism, they&#39;re now free to choose from<br/>
a vast range of possible lifestyles. They can grow as much cannabis as they<br/>
like without having to worry about being locked up  or waking up one morning<br/>
to find that it has all been stolen. They&#39;re free to spend all their money on<br/>
their dependants instead of financing state sinecures. In particular, they&#39;re<br/>
entitled to bring their children up to be Libertarians. Or not to. <br/>
<br/>
Suppose that these people happen to share a dislike for children, so they<br/>
don&#39;t have any. Suppose also that they don&#39;t write books or allow outside<br/>
visitors to view their society. Will their society thrive? Perhaps for a<br/>
while, but one thing we can predict without knowing any more about it than<br/>
that, is that because they&#39;re not passing on their Libertarian ideas, their<br/>
little society is not going to be the nucleus of the future Libertarian world.<br/>
Unless they perfect the technology of immortality, they&#39;ll eventually die out,<br/>
and then the society they created, no matter how Libertarian, will no longer<br/>
exist. <br/>
<br/>
Now if you thought those Libertarians were strange, here&#39;s an even stranger<br/>
group: These people do have children, but they bring them all up as<br/>
communists. This may be an unlikely scenario, but just consider the logic of<br/>
it. There&#39;s nothing in a Libertarian society to stop parents doing that, is<br/>
there? They&#39;re free to bring up their children in any way they like, aren&#39;t<br/>
they? It&#39;s not illegal to be inconsistent is it? Not all the ways will be<br/>
equally good for the children. Not all will be equally good for the society.<br/>
Some of them will be perverse, some will be nasty, cruel, and morally wrong,<br/>
despite being legal. <br/>
<br/>
By the time these perverse Libertarians are dead (or cryonically suspended),<br/>
and only the grown-up children remain, the children will have instituted a<br/>
communist government. Or maybe they won&#39;t have; maybe it&#39;s not so easy to<br/>
bring up children to be communists: the Eastern bloc&#39;s educational systems<br/>
tried very hard to do so, with only patchy success. <br/>
<br/>
Closed cultures such as the Amish survive by suppressing all creativity and<br/>
innovation but unless you&#39;re part of such a culture it&#39;s incredibly difficult<br/>
to bring up children to believe any particular idea you intend them to believe<br/>
(as many a parent will tell you). <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t calculate all the unintended effects of your actions, you can&#39;t<br/>
control every possible outside influence or calculate the effects of those<br/>
outside influences (though some parents do try  you should see what lengths<br/>
my neighbour goes to, to but I digress). So maybe these children won&#39;t end up<br/>
being communists after all; but even the most optimistic among you will have<br/>
to agree that it&#39;s all too easy to bring up one&#39;s children not to be<br/>
Libertarians. Most parents already do that quite successfully. <br/>
<br/>
So a Libertarian society, without violating any of the principles of<br/>
Libertarianism, could ensure its own destruction, simply by choosing the wrong<br/>
child-rearing ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Now, you may be thinking that although what I&#39;ve described is a logical<br/>
possibility, it&#39;s a little farfetched. Why on earth should parents who believe<br/>
in liberty choose to raise their children in such a way as to decrease their<br/>
liberty  and to end up fearing and hating it as non-Libertarians do? <br/>
<br/>
Well, in a way, I think that is just what you are doing (well, most of you<br/>
anyway), or are planning to do when you become parents. Most parents do this.<br/>
It isn&#39;t what you intend, but neither do most left-wingers intend to ruin the<br/>
economy, do they? <br/>
<br/>
In a Libertarian society, it&#39;s legal to raise your children as communists  or<br/>
Democrats or Republicans  or to have all sorts of debilitating hang-ups, of<br/>
which the fear of freedom is a common example, or to make them unhappy by<br/>
inflicting every sort of psychological cruelty. Perfectly legal. Isn&#39;t it? <br/>
<br/>
TCS advocates raising children without doing anything to them against their<br/>
will or making them do anything against their will. I hope you are already<br/>
beginning to see why I have little patience with libertarians who object to<br/>
this by citing the parents&#39; legal rights. Yes, switching off the TV until they<br/>
have done their homework should be legal. But that does not make it harmless,<br/>
nor does it make it any less vicious, nasty or morally wrong. <br/>
<br/>
There is a more general reason Libertarians need to think about more than just<br/>
a constitution or set of laws that determine when violence is and isn&#39;t<br/>
legitimate: <br/>
<br/>
Installing the right laws cannot by itself guarantee that you will get a<br/>
society that lives by those laws. That requires knowledge. This is the second<br/>
link I want to point out between education theory and Libertarian political<br/>
theory. <br/>
<br/>
Let me give an example: <br/>
<br/>
There are two kinds of country which have the US constitution. There are those<br/>
which, after they have instituted the US constitution, get an open society in<br/>
which all the constitutionally-protected human rights are respected (such as<br/>
in the US itself), and there are those which just ignore the constitution.<br/>
Merely introducing a Libertarian constitution would not ensure that liberty<br/>
was actually respected. <br/>
<br/>
(If you&#39;re thinking that the US isn&#39;t an example of a country in which all the<br/>
constitutionally-protected human rights are actually respected, and that in<br/>
fact the US constitution is often violated, that just makes my point more<br/>
strongly. If America isn&#39;t a place where the rights laid down in the US<br/>
Constitution are respected, what makes you think that, after it&#39;s replaced by<br/>
a new Libertarian Constitution, whether written or unwritten, the resulting<br/>
society will respect that constitution?) <br/>
<br/>
In 1989, Nigeria instituted a constitution strikingly similar to that of the<br/>
US. But has it produced a society like the US in terms of rights being<br/>
respected? Not exactly. Not unless you&#39;re being very uncharitable to the US. <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference? Would Nigeria become a Libertarian society if it were<br/>
lucky enough to have a constitution designed for it by the good people at<br/>
ISIL? No. If anything, adopting a Libertarian constitution would result in<br/>
even more of a mess. <br/>
<br/>
When the US constitution was adopted in America, most people in the society<br/>
(or at least the people who counted) were intellectually convinced that this<br/>
constitution was right; but the overwhelming majority of Nigerians would be<br/>
convinced that the ISIL constitution was not for them. Much as it would be in<br/>
their interests to adopt an ISIL constitution, the idea is a non-starter. And<br/>
if it were somehow implemented, people simply wouldn&#39;t act that way. The<br/>
Nigerians couldn&#39;t even behave in accordance with the US constitution, let<br/>
alone a better one. <br/>
<br/>
So having the right constitution or laws alone will not get you a Libertarian<br/>
society. You need the right sort of people. You need people with the right<br/>
ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Now  here is a third way in which education theory and Libertarian political<br/>
theory are linked: <br/>
<br/>
Some Libertarians believe that children have rights, perhaps the same rights<br/>
as adults. An intermediate position is that children have no rights other than<br/>
to leave home and find new parents. At the other end of the spectrum are<br/>
Libertarians who believe that children are, more or less, property, because<br/>
the parents buy the food which makes up the molecules of their bodies. These<br/>
different versions of Libertarian ideas would have different implications for<br/>
how parents would be allowed to educate their children, even in a Libertarian<br/>
society  even in a Libertarian-anarchist society. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, at this moment there are thousands of children all over the<br/>
country who want to leave home (or to leave school, or refuse consent to<br/>
medical procedures and so on), and in many of those cases the parents are<br/>
violently overriding their wishes, with the authority and assistance of the<br/>
state as well as of most bystanders on whose assistance the parents choose to<br/>
call. Now imagine that an anarchist revolution is achieved. What will happen<br/>
next? <br/>
<br/>
Some of the anarchists will regard all that parental violence as justified.<br/>
Others will regard it as the epitome of injustice. <br/>
<br/>
The two kinds of people will think it legitimate violently to assist whichever<br/>
side they think is in the right. <br/>
<br/>
If a civil war ensues  this isn&#39;t so farfetched: something very similar<br/>
happened in regard to slaves, following an earlier revolution for liberty  it<br/>
will be because although the individuals in that society agreed that violence<br/>
is legitimate only in self-defence  they disagreed about which entities have<br/>
a self in the appropriate sense. <br/>
<br/>
Now you may wish that everyone agreed with your particular conception of<br/>
Libertarianism. But although you may well have stumbled upon the ultimate<br/>
truth about what a Libertarian society should be like, you have to admit<br/>
you&#39;ve failed to hit upon the ultimate truth about how to propagate that idea<br/>
to each other  let alone to the next generation. <br/>
<br/>
What we are discussing here is a kind of knowledge. This knowledge is<br/>
philosophical, it is epistemological, it is psychological. It is knowledge<br/>
that is necessary for the functioning of a Libertarian society, but it can&#39;t<br/>
be derived from Libertarian principles. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the knowledge of what sort of citizen would make a society which is<br/>
nominally Libertarian actually function as such. That includes knowledge in<br/>
the mind of such a citizen. <br/>
<br/>
Does it include the knowledge of how to make such a citizen? Not exactly. I<br/>
don&#39;t believe it&#39;s either moral or rational to bring up children to propagate<br/>
a certain political view. Such a thing should be anathema to any advocate of<br/>
liberty, and in my opinion, to any decent parent too. <br/>
<br/>
What I am trying to illustrate with these examples  the libertarian society<br/>
that dies after a generation; the nominally libertarian society imposed on<br/>
people with non-libertarian ideas; the civil war about children&#39;s rights  is<br/>
that a functioning Libertarian society will depend on the existence of<br/>
knowledge that cannot be obtained from Libertarian principles alone. <br/>
<br/>
To discover such knowledge we must look to what underlies those principles<br/>
themselves. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, their underlying justification is epistemology. Applied<br/>
epistemology is otherwise known as education theory. <br/>
<br/>
It is important to seek an education theory that grows from the same roots as<br/>
Libertarianism, but it is a colossal mistake to try to derive educational<br/>
theory from Libertarianism. <br/>
<br/>
The main reason I&#39;m a Libertarian is that I believe that human beings are<br/>
fallible. That the powerful, in particular, are fallible and can&#39;t be trusted<br/>
to be right. Not kings, not bureaucrats  and not parents or teachers either. <br/>
<br/>
So I agree with Karl Popper that the question isn&#39;t who should rule? but<br/>
how can we limit the harm they do? <br/>
<br/>
In education theory, the who should rule? debate is still alive and<br/>
virtually unchallenged. Should it be parents? Teachers? School boards? The<br/>
government? The UN...? (A better answer would of course be me.) <br/>
<br/>
And as always when you start with that question, the answer is tyranny. The<br/>
real question is: how can institutions be set up within a family in such a way<br/>
that no one  including the children  is ruled. <br/>
<br/>
So that differences of opinion can be resolved, not only without the<br/>
initiation or threat of force (which is as far as Libertarian theory can<br/>
possibly take us), but without force at all: by reason, which implies by<br/>
consent. <br/>
<br/>
Libertarians today differ about many things  I have already mentioned<br/>
children&#39;s rights  but also whether, say, intellectual property is really<br/>
property, whether abortion is murder or not, and so on. What we really want,<br/>
and the whole point of a Libertarian society, and of a free society in general<br/>
as I see it, is not to entrench particular answers to such questions, but to<br/>
allow bad answers to be replaced by better ones. A fixed rule, such as the<br/>
parent is always right is inherently irrational and will systematically pick<br/>
the wrong answer. Family institutions that enforce such a rule are irrational. <br/>
<br/>
As good Libertarians and good parents, we should want our children to be able<br/>
to correct our errors. And by able, we should mean not just legally able<br/>
(that is to say, they won&#39;t be thrown in prison or punished by their parents<br/>
if they try) but psychologically able to, which means that they won&#39;t feel<br/>
fear or guilt or the weight of parental disapproval if they try. <br/>
<br/>
What we need  what TCS provides  is a completely different rhythm of family<br/>
life; as different as an open society is from a paternalistic dictatorship. <br/>
<br/>
To understand Libertarianism you have to understand that living in liberty<br/>
isn&#39;t just a pleasant experience, like eating raspberries. Liberty isn&#39;t just<br/>
a good, it&#39;s a condition for goods to be created. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, tyranny  the initiation of force  isn&#39;t just an un*pleasant<br/>
experience, like having a large teganaria giganiticus* charging at your bare<br/>
feet from across the room (if you hate spiders, that is!) <br/>
<br/>
As soon as you do think of it in that subjective way, you miss the point, and<br/>
lay yourself open to wicked arguments about tradeoffs  So, Mr Irresponsible<br/>
Libertarian, how many children are you willing to see die of heroin poisoning<br/>
or in gun accidents, just to give you the nice warm feeling of living in<br/>
liberty? <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that some people hate spiders, some people hate taxes. Those are<br/>
not the same kind of thing. The Libertarians&#39; hatred of taxation is<br/>
structurally different. John Gray, who wrote that deplorably defeatist book<br/>
Liberalisms, disagrees, but he&#39;s wrong. <br/>
<br/>
There is something more than personal preferences underlying the liberalisms,<br/>
in particular Libertarianism, and it does make sense, and it&#39;s reason. <br/>
<br/>
The reason for the Libertarian hatred of taxation is that the institution of<br/>
taxation is, in an extended sense, irrational. Not necessarily in the narrow<br/>
sense that the word rational has historically been used, but in the most<br/>
general sense: There are patterns of thinking that can work (that is, create<br/>
the knowledge needed to solve the problems and meet the preferences of the<br/>
person doing the thinking), and patterns that can&#39;t work (except by unlikely<br/>
coincidence). For instance, logical deduction can work when trying to solve a<br/>
mathematical problem, but, as generations of exam-takers have found, prayer<br/>
cannot. Scientific reasoning can work when trying to understand the physical<br/>
world, but logical deduction in the absence of experimentation cannot, and nor<br/>
can prayer. <br/>
<br/>
Rationalism is the theory that the patterns of thinking that can work are the<br/>
rational ones  where the exact criterion for a process being rational<br/>
depends on which species of rationalism one adopts. The one appropriate to TCS<br/>
is the same as the one that I believe is appropriate to the liberalisms in<br/>
general and to Libertarianism in particular: it is what is known as critical<br/>
rationalism, but with the proviso that we include unconscious and inexplicit<br/>
knowledge and thought uniformly in our scheme of things. (Thus a rational<br/>
process need not rely on verbal reasoning.) As fallibilists, we don&#39;t expect<br/>
there to be a closed definition of rational: the exact criteria are always<br/>
under critical review. <br/>
<br/>
To be rational in the fallibilist, critical-rationalist sense, a process has<br/>
to be truth-seeking, evolutionary, open to new ideas and to criticism of old<br/>
ones, avoid entrenchment of particular ideas, judge ideas according to content<br/>
rather than source ... and so on. <br/>
<br/>
In science, these criteria lead to Popper&#39;s conclusion that theories about<br/>
measurable phenomena must be experimentally testable if progress is to be<br/>
possible. In political theory, they lead to Libertarianism. In psychology and<br/>
education theory, they lead to TCS. <br/>
<br/>
The places where reason has gained substantial ground over the last few<br/>
hundred years, are specifically, in the areas of human rights, and in the<br/>
economy, and in science. If we call this the Enlightenment in the public<br/>
sphere, TCS is about extending the Enlightenment into the private sphere, and<br/>
specifically into the sphere of child rearing. <br/>
<br/>
We ask, applying the same philosophical principles as underlie the<br/>
Enlightenment generally, what sort of institutions within the family promote<br/>
the growth of knowledge in the same sense that the external laws of a<br/>
Libertarian society promote the growth of knowledge in the society as a whole,<br/>
and the rules of the scientific community promote the growth of scientific<br/>
knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
You can define a Libertarian society as one in which political issues are<br/>
decided by reason rather than force or blind obedience to tradition. <br/>
<br/>
In a non-Libertarian society, if I earn a hundred pounds, the criterion of<br/>
choosing how that should be spent isn&#39;t unanimous agreement between all the<br/>
parties, it&#39;s voting, and ultimately the use of police power to take the money<br/>
from me against my will. Whereas in a Libertarian society, every possible use<br/>
of the money I earn has to have my consent. So in society at large, the<br/>
alternative to consent is force. <br/>
<br/>
But in human relationships the absence of consent doesn&#39;t necessarily amount<br/>
to force. It&#39;s a wider class of behaviours, which includes force: there are<br/>
many patterns of interaction between people in close relationships that don&#39;t<br/>
resolve issues by reason at all, yet don&#39;t involve force either. <br/>
<br/>
When a parent gives Little Billy a telling off, she may use no physical force<br/>
and no overt threat of force, but it is still not reason. Despite this being a<br/>
mere exercise of the parent&#39;s freedom of speech, little Billy does not<br/>
consent to it. Even while he is having the flow of ideas initiated in his mind<br/>
by the telling-off, he simultaneously wishes he were not. <br/>
<br/>
When a parent gives Sally a choice between, on the one hand, taking out the<br/>
rubbish and having dinner, and on the other hand, not getting any dinner, she<br/>
is acting in such a way to put Sally into the psychological state of enacting<br/>
one theory while one or more conflicting theories remain active in her mind.<br/>
She is causing Sally to act literally against her will. Sally doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
take out the rubbish but fear of not getting any dinner effectively forces her<br/>
to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Even making disappointed faces at your children to shame them into complying<br/>
works in the same way, psychologically, instead of causing a genuine, FREE<br/>
change of mind. <br/>
<br/>
Some Libertarians I know force their children to eat everything on their plate<br/>
 presumably not on the basis that there are starving children in Africa  no<br/>
doubt they have some other pseudo-justification for this viciously immoral and<br/>
harmful practice, but the psychological effect upon the child is the same<br/>
either way. <br/>
<br/>
It may not be state tyranny, but if you are being controlled by someone else,<br/>
it feels bad whether it is the state or your parent. And in both cases, life<br/>
would be better for all if reason were applied instead of force. <br/>
<br/>
Reason also requires seeking truth, because if you are not seeking truth, you<br/>
are unlikely to find it. It is because rational processes seek a common and<br/>
objective truth that they tend to reach agreement, and it is this tendency<br/>
that powers the continual discovery of common preferences that replaces the<br/>
command structure of conventional education and parenting. <br/>
<br/>
Seeking the truth requires remaining open to criticism and change, because<br/>
otherwise you will fail to drop false theories even when better ones are to<br/>
hand. Failing to drop refuted theories is incompatible with reason. But that<br/>
is exactly what a child is required to do, when he is coerced into learning<br/>
something against his will. He prefers one activity; perforce he engages in<br/>
another. This is irrational. And because it is irrational, it fails to create<br/>
knowledge. Rote learning isn&#39;t knowledge in the true sense, merely the<br/>
semblance of knowledge, just as inflated money is the semblance of wealth. <br/>
<br/>
Judging ideas by their source rather than their content is incompatible with<br/>
reason  so mother knows best, and because I say so are the archetypes of<br/>
irrational child-rearing just as much as using the parent&#39;s physical strength<br/>
to settle a dispute would be. <br/>
<br/>
So what TCS asks is of a piece with what Libertarianism asks in regard to<br/>
politics and economics, namely: what rules of engagement in interpersonal<br/>
relationships have the property that rival ideas will be judged by reason (and<br/>
can therefore approach the truth)? This is what leads us to TCS educational<br/>
theory, whose most striking feature, especially to the newcomer, is the idea<br/>
that it is desirable and possible to bring up children without doing things to<br/>
them against their will. <br/>
<br/>
Just as an economic transaction takes place only with the unanimous consent of<br/>
all parties, so TCS family life seeks the unanimous consent of the family<br/>
members  including the children. <br/>
<br/>
The TCS project is the construction of institutions within the family which do<br/>
for the growth of knowledge there what the public institutions of capitalism,<br/>
common law and so on do for the growth of wealth, science and other knowledge<br/>
that involves the cooperation of strangers. So TCS is the final, most<br/>
difficult, but also the most valuable, stage of the Enlightenment. <br/>
<br/>
The future of liberty is TCS.</div>
