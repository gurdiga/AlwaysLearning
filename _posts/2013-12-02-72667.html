<div id="ygrps-yiv-291650607">As has been mentioned before, Pam Laricchia has a set of 10 emails introducing unschooling. They&#39;re an excellent start to understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
A thread has opened up at Radical Unschoolers Network to discuss the question from the first email, &quot;What are your goals?&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you sign up for Pam&#39;s newsletter, the first email will come right away.<br/>
