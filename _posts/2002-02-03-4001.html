<div id="ygrps-yiv-813474720">The other day we were talking about how my dd thought in the future we wouldn&#39;t need hoses.  Well, I found a very good science experiment book in the library that will tie into this.  The book is  &quot;39 easy meteorology experiments&quot; by Robert W. Wood.  I&#39;m looking forward to making a cloud!  He has lots of other cool ones too.  Anyone else have any science stuff they like?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you heard of the Experiment of the Week email list?<br/>
<br/>
Description:<br/>
Weekly science experiments that can be done with household items.  Topics<br/>
vary from physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, etc.  Most are easy<br/>
enough for young students, and most can be adapted for older students and<br/>
adults. <br/>
