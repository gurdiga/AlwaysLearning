<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362552947">For those who responded to minecraft server post:<br/>
<br/>
My son would love to play minecraft with other unschoolers!! were in the<br/>
process of trying to get a server up. If anyone has children that would like to<br/>
play on a server (when its up)...I am going to dedicate it to homeschoolers<br/>
only....let me know :) and I will send you the IP address.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for responding, however we are as of yet unable to get the server up and running, and are as of now going to have to cancel.  However, I will let you know if anything changes, please stop any further postings as I got a rather disturbing email from Sandra (see below): <br/>
<br/>
Are you willing to host all the unschoolers who are coming by?<br/>
<br/>
Please go back to Always Learning, if you could, and post your e-mail address or something so we&#39;re not getting so many &quot;me too&quot; posts.  It won&#39;t be fun for those who aren&#39;t playing Minecraft, and it would be more fun for those people to hear back from you directly.<br/>
<br/>
Can you see the e-mail addresses when you&#39;re at the site or in your e-mail?</div>

<br/>
All she&#39;s asking (politely) is that you ask people to contact you  <br/>
directly, not post to the list where the discussions and posts should  <br/>
be about unschooling itself.<br/>

What was quoted was NOT the first e-mail to Cindi, nor was it complete.  The e-mail I sent, and her response, are below:<br/>

Can you see the e-mail addresses when you&#39;re at the site or in your e-mail?  if not, let me know and I can send them to you, but I would rather the Always Learning list NOT be the gathering place, if you can offer a place for them to write directly.<br/>
<br/>
Please post an update.  Thanks.<br/>

Sandra,<br/>
 <br/>
I have no idea, nor do I feel that by you coming across as being irritated at &quot;me&quot; going to resolve anything....I&#39;m sorry you feel that you have to do this but I am not going to feed into it in any way shape or form thank you very much and have a good evening....:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327270503">I honestly don&#39;t know whether the original poster could see full e-mail addresses or not.  A few that came, I forwarded directly to her, hoping she was responding and gathering them, but I didn&#39;t get a response that time, and this recent response is very unpromising.<br/>
<br/>
So if there&#39;s someone else here who wants to volunteer to coordinate trying to get these families in contact with one another off list (or even better, knows how to set up a server and can do that), I can help (if necessary) with e-mail addresses.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry this didn&#39;t pan out, the same way I would be sorry if someone collected money for a pizza run at my house and never came back.  I know kids get their hopes up and it&#39;s a bummer to say &quot;sorry; it isn&#39;t happening.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90508143">That was a very polite and even sweet e-mail from Sandra.<br/>
I wonder why such a negative and big reaction one would have.<br/>
<br/>
Here I was going to post a link to the unschooling_gamers group where people are there to &#39;<br/>
talk about gaming and trading info and resources on gaming plus getting together to play.<br/>
Great place to talk about servers for Minecraft and much more!<br/>

I have the note below by e-mail this morning, with permission to share her e-mail address.<br/>
Alex, if you would be willing to help her gather all those who requested together, I&#39;d really appreciate it!  I&#39;ll send her the addresses I have thusfar.<br/>

Dear Sandra,<br/>
My family has a Minecraft server, and my unschooling son is seeking friends. I would LOVE to get the addresses of the people looking for a Minecraft server to play on. We&#39;ll contact them all. ...<br/>
