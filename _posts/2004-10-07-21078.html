I&#39;m in an early music group.   One doesn&#39;t read music, the others do.  One <br/>
can&#39;t hold a part alone; others can.   One can sing tenor or bass, another <br/>
can <br/>
only sing tenor.  One is the contact point for a possible paying gig.   One&#39;s <br/>

A lot of gaming goes on at my house and has even before we had kids.  When a <br/>
game comes out, some don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t play it.  Some really understand <br/>
the rules, others need a brush-up.<br/>
<br/>
Chess... everyone equals?<br/>
Bridge?<br/>
<br/>
Sports?  Everyone equals?<br/>
<br/>
So on this list, what creates equality or lack of equality?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725927380">Have you read the short story Harrison Bergeron? It&#39;s all about a world<br/>
where everyone is &quot;finally equal&quot;, and no one is prettier, smarter,<br/>
stronger, etc. It&#39;s an interesting concept.<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;equal&quot; referred to by our founding fathers refers more to<br/>
legal rights and opportunities than intrinsic abilities, but even that<br/>
isn&#39;t really true. Rich white guys have it better than poor black guys,<br/>
and so on. I think it&#39;s a goal more than anything else... we&#39;d like for<br/>
everyone to have the same rights and opportunities, at least those of us<br/>
who are somewhat idealistic would, but it&#39;s not really gonna happen.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Have you read the short story Harrison Bergeron? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah yes.  Vonnegut.<br/>
<br/>
Here, it&#39;s online.<br/>
(No one prone to depression should read this.  Just don&#39;t.  It&#39;s not cheery.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll quote the first part and then put a link for more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE YEAR WAS 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren&#39;t only equal <br/>
before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter <br/>
than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was <br/>
stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, <br/>
212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of <br/>
agents of the United States Handicapper General. <br/>
<br/>
Some things about living still weren&#39;t quite right, though. April for <br/>
instance, still drove people crazy by not being springtime. And it was in that clammy <br/>
month that the H-G men took George and Hazel Bergeron&#39;s fourteen-year-old <br/>
son, Harrison, away. <br/>
<br/>
It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn&#39;t think about it very <br/>
hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn&#39;t <br/>
think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence <br/>
was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was <br/>
required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. <br/>
Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise <br/>
to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains. <br/>
<br/>
George and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel&#39;s <br/>
cheeks, but she&#39;d forgotten for the moment what they were about. <br/>
<br/>
On the television screen were ballerinas. <br/>
<br/>
A buzzer sounded in George&#39;s head. His thoughts fled in panic, like bandits <br/>
from a burglar alarm. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;That was a real pretty dance, that dance they just did,&quot; said Hazel. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Huh&quot; said George. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;That dance-it was nice,&quot; said Hazel. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yup,&quot; said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. They <br/>
weren&#39;t really very good-no better than anybody else would have been, anyway. <br/>
They were burdened with sashweights and bags of birdshot, and their faces were <br/>
masked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face, <br/>
would feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vague <br/>
notion that maybe dancers shouldn&#39;t be handicapped. But he didn&#39;t get very far with <br/>
it before another noise in his ear radio scattered his thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
George winced. So did two out of the eight ballerinas. <br/>
<br/>
Hazel saw him wince. Having no mental handicap herself, she had to ask George <br/>
what the latest sound had been. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

This made me think about my &quot;previous life&quot; as an<br/>
administrator at a Health Plan/PPO.<br/>
<br/>
I always despised silly rules like<br/>
<br/>
* everyone needs to be here at 8am and work until 4:30<br/>
* everyone gets a 30 minute lunch hour<br/>
* vacation must be taken in one week increments<br/>
<br/>
that didn&#39;t take into account any differences between<br/>
people and their lives.<br/>
<br/>
So when I became a manager, I decided that my goal was<br/>
to treat everyone fairly, but not necessarily equally.<br/>
<br/>
One woman wanted to be home after school with her<br/>
young children, so she and I agreed that she could<br/>
work 7-3.<br/>
<br/>
One man&#39;s wife worked most weekends but had Mondays<br/>
off, so he worked longer days Tuesday-Friday and a<br/>
little on Saturday so he and his wife could be<br/>
together on Mondays.<br/>
<br/>
One woman wanted long lunches because she liked to<br/>
take a short nap before coming back to work.<br/>
<br/>
One woman liked to take her days off one at a time to<br/>
coincide with her kids&#39; days off school.<br/>
<br/>
One woman was such a fantastic and talented member of<br/>
the staff, but was maxed out at the top of the<br/>
established salary range and I couldn&#39;t offer her more<br/>
pay, so I&#39;d send her home early on Fridays as a<br/>
&quot;bonus&quot;  whenever the workload would allow it.<br/>
<br/>
It worked great for our department, which was part of<br/>
a larger health network, but I got complaints from<br/>
human resources, because other managers got complaints<br/>
from their employees because they weren&#39;t willing to<br/>
be flexible and believed that all of their employees<br/>
should be treated &quot;equally&quot;. <br/>

<br/>
This has been made into a TV movie of the same title, with Sean Astin (the<br/>
young man who played Sam Gangee) as Harrison. He ends up taking over a tv<br/>
station for a while and creating what become subversive recordings, in the<br/>
movie anyway. The movie has a hopeful ending (naturally).<br/>

<br/>
Karen<br/>

*****<br/>
But is that really true?  After all, those with greater financial wealth can just move out of that community if/when things get bad, even if that worsening is the result of their acts or policies the rich supported.  Often, it&#39;s only the poor and middle class who have a real stake in the community, in that they can&#39;t easily escape or that their lives will be measurably better if the community improves.  The rich would still be rich and powerful, and in fact, making their community more enjoyable and better for others might lessen their wealth and power.  So, really the stakes aren&#39;t equal -- neither is the risk.<br/>
 <br/>
In the original myth, it&#39;s that all men are &#39;created equal&#39; -- even that&#39;s assuming too much. What about birth defects, or financial opportunities, or even just the fact that some people are smarter than others?  Maybe not so much smarter as just one is great at math, another at communication, and another very good with his hands, or some such thing.  But equal in abilities and strengths doesn&#39;t even hold true for all identical twins, and they have the same dna.<br/>
 <br/>
In an ideal world, everyone would have equal opportunities -- really hard to achieve even today -- or be of equal value to the world/community. While that may already be true in the ideal sense, that&#39;s not the way it works out day-to-day.<br/>
 <br/>
The real problem I see with this myth is that it breeds contempt and jealousy.  It also gives the powers that be a platform for programs like public school and other standardized programs.  It&#39;s appealing to think you are as good as your neighbor, or at least to think he&#39;s no better than you. It&#39;s a great distraction to keep us from focusing on our own abilities and potential.   The average person is too busy being sure his kids get the &#39;same education&#39; as kids in the better neighborhoods and the like to have any energy left over to question the inherent unfairness of making all things equal.<br/>
 <br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t care whether or not I&#39;m equal to my neighbor or anyone else.  I do want to be treated fairly, and strive to treat others fairly.  As someone else posted, there&#39;s a difference between fair and equal, as concepts.  Fair involves assessing a person&#39;s strengths and needs and acting accordingly in a way that blesses as many people as possible.  Equal is arbitrary and doesn&#39;t take into account the individuality of each person involved.  <br/>
 <br/>
Did Sandra also ask if we&#39;re all euqal here?  If so, the answer is no -- everyone has his/her own level of experience, perspective and insights.  Sometimes, one person is more adept at a top than someone else, but that&#39;s just as likely to change tomorrow as not.  I think to the extent that posting here is very much what&#39;s described on the front page, it&#39;s as fair as it can be.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what do you think people mean when they say &quot;We&#39;re all equal here&quot; on a<br/>
list?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra didn&#39;t originate the pronouncement. It&#39;s been said by others many<br/>
times over the years.<br/>
<br/>
So what are they using those words to mean?<br/>
<br/>
Why should people assume that we would all agree that we are all &quot;equal&quot;? We<br/>
aren&#39;t born with that idea! It comes from somewhere that it&#39;s assumed we<br/>
would all mutually agree is right.<br/>
<br/>
I *do* think people pluck the idea from the Constitution and use it in a<br/>
context it wasn&#39;t intended to be used in. So the equivocating is when<br/>
someone says &quot;We&#39;re all equal here&quot; on a list not when Sandra asks what they<br/>
mean.<br/>
<br/>
Usually the context is someone will say &quot;Here&#39;s my problem.&quot; And a second<br/>
someone will say &quot;Here&#39;s how I handle that.&quot; Then a third someone will hold<br/>
the practice of the third person up to examination. The second someone will<br/>
get upset because they feel personally attacked. They perhaps feel that all<br/>
practices should just be thrown out there so others can take what they like<br/>
and leave what they don&#39;t like. And they say &quot;We&#39;re all equal here,&quot;<br/>
meaning, I think, &quot;I&#39;m just as good a person as you are. But by criticizing<br/>
my idea you&#39;re saying I&#39;m a bad mother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So what do you think people mean when they say &quot;We&#39;re all equal&quot; in that<br/>
context? Or do you see it used in a different context?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Aside from the equivocation issue (we can come back to that),<br/>
<br/>
&quot;equality&quot; in the context of the original post from the other list<br/>
<br/>
meant the equality the list members on that list had to post, even<br/>
<br/>
when their opinions differed from yours.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Joyce that the equivocation comes in using the term &quot;equality&quot; <br/>
as a talisman.   <br/>
<br/>
A guy named Louie Sanchez was my science teacher in 9th grade, and later I <br/>
taught with him.  I learned some good human-nature things from him, but he was <br/>
an outspoken crank too.  He had a teacher&#39;s-lounge rant about how wrong it was <br/>
for our district to spend so much on basketball and encourage these boys to <br/>
hope maybe they could play professionally, when the reality was that the local <br/>
gene pool rarely produced a man who was six feet tall, and that &quot;created equal&quot; <br/>
didn&#39;t take those realities into effect.   Soccer, he said, they&#39;d have a <br/>
chance.  But soccer wasn&#39;t the fashion in northern New Mexico in the 70&#39;s and <br/>
80&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The boys DID love basketball at that school.  And they WERE encouraged.  And <br/>
Louie was right.<br/>
<br/>
I have more years than not in my adult life run music groups at Christmas, to <br/>
do medieval and Renaissance Christmas carols.  This year we have only six <br/>
participants, and we might not perform more than once.  That&#39;s okay, because the <br/>
singing is just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Some years there were 20 or 30, and we performed a couple of medieval feasts, <br/>
a couple of public things, and wen caroling.   Each year some people were <br/>
frustrated.  There&#39;s a philosophical question that can&#39;t be avoided in such <br/>
cases, and that is which goal is greater:  the quality of the music or providing <br/>
each participant an opportunity to perform period music in a group.    If the <br/>
quality is too low, the best singers are frustrated (and the audience).  If the <br/>
quality consideration is too high, some singers need to be kept in the <br/>
background or discouraged altogether.  It&#39;s tiring to be in that decision-making, <br/>
organizational position, because invariably someone whose contribution has been <br/>
to show up to half the practices will complain on the side yet audibly at some <br/>
point, either that the performances aren&#39;t rehearsed enough or that she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a solo.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a used Saturn yesterday, from a friend.  I have another friend who&#39;s <br/>
a Saturn owner, and I called her for advice in advance.  She&#39;s a very frugal <br/>
and analytical person, and she gave me exactly the advice I wanted.  I trusted <br/>
her because I&#39;ve known her for a long time.  I&#39;ve ridden in various cars of <br/>
hers.  I picked her up from the scene of a T-bone accident that was not at all <br/>
her fault.  She is a credible, experienced, thoughtful source.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s driving a &#39;93 and I was considering a &#39;96.  She knew off the top of her <br/>
head what engineering improvements had been made, and what problems I might <br/>
encounter.<br/>
<br/>
Had I not had that resource, I would have looked online for a Saturn owners <br/>
discussion.   When I got there, I would have been willing to double check <br/>
anything I read, because I didn&#39;t have years to hang out and get to know the <br/>
people.  But in the course of a quick inquiry, it would matter to me whether the <br/>
person had owned Saturns or repaired them or been a lawyer in claims, or was just <br/>
there considering, as I was, for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
If someone claimed to have owned three Saturns and it turned out it was a <br/>
lie, that would be a turd in the lemonade for sure.  But even assuming people <br/>
were being honest, some opinions are more valuable than others. <br/>
<br/>
Some people consider e-mail discussions to be a social opportunity, or a tea <br/>
party.  Some are.  But a discussion marked to discuss unstopping is not, for <br/>
me, an opportunity for everyone who comes by to be equally heard and considered <br/>
and promoted.  Some people are wonderful at describing what they do with <br/>
their children.  Some aren&#39;t as good with words, and words are all we have here.   <br/>
Some people have just discovered unstopping and some have been at it for a <br/>
while.  Some got it easily and can describe clearly how their thinking process <br/>
went.  Some have struggled for years and are missing some aspect or concept <br/>
that might make all the difference.  Some are very logical, while others don&#39;t <br/>
think logic has a value.  <br/>
<br/>
But in a discussion which some people will join for a while, get what they <br/>
need, and move on, it&#39;s important to me as a moderator that they get clear, <br/>
useful information and not obfuscation or dishonesty.  This shouldn&#39;t be anyone&#39;s <br/>
sole source of information, and it&#39;s fine for it to be a specialized subset of <br/>
ideas.  For me, on this list, clear and useful and positive are more valuable <br/>
than muddled and troublesome.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay for basketball teams to prefer tall, athletic people.<br/>
It&#39;s okay for a music group to be organized to give people a chance to sing <br/>
in public, but it&#39;s also okay to have groups chosen by audition only.<br/>

Well, I was thinking in terms of a democracy that the equal stake we all  <br/>
have (unless we&#39;ve given it up for some reason) is our vote.  But then,  children <br/>
don&#39;t vote, so they don&#39;t have an equal stake.<br/>
 <br/>
I was thinking in terms of the most basic level at which we are all  <br/>
equal...citizenship maybe?  Life?  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m on a list where everyone is an owner of the list, so everyone really  <br/>
does have an equal stake in the list.  Equal power, equal  participation.  It has <br/>
nothing to do with whether I can ride a horse or  have money or can walk <br/>
straight.<br/>
 <br/>
I know one thing.  I&#39;d rather be in a place where &quot;equal&quot; is at least  an <br/>
ideal to be strived for, even if it is not the reality.<br/>

Yeah I think so.<br/>
People who are in a volunteer organization and don&#39;t show up for two years <br/>
don&#39;t breeze in and take a big role without causing those who have been doing <br/>

I have to say - this is quite a full and interesting response - it really<br/>
clarifies (for me) your vision for this list. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve struggled<br/>
with - having found myself often in situations where I was a part of the<br/>
&quot;chosen&quot; when I was asked to downplay whatever skills had landed me there in<br/>
order to allow everyone equal time and also being able to shine but having<br/>
many cry &quot;unfair&quot;, as well as sometimes not making that cut and having to<br/>
watch from the sidelines, I&#39;ve considered these things too. I think<br/>
automatically we (or at least I - and I&#39;ve noticed others in these groups)<br/>
assume that bulletin boards are going to be the more egalitarian of these<br/>
models for interaction. I know I have and now this response you&#39;ve made has<br/>
put it into a different perspective. I&#39;ve had mentors who were well - damned<br/>
hard - on those of us chosen for a specific talent or area of inquiry. This<br/>
is a very different environment from the usual, some would say, more<br/>
empathetic approach. I&#39;ve often argued that I learned a lot from those<br/>
professors who scowled over their glasses at me. I&#39;m still not sure how I<br/>
feel about that issue - I vacillate more when I think in terms of its<br/>
application to general population as opposed to for myself alone  - but this<br/>
email has given me a different way to think about the issue within the<br/>
context of these discussion group exchanges. I like that you have indicated<br/>
that sometimes one approach is applicable and at other times another. I<br/>
believe I&#39;m beginning to understand better.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030583085">So I&#39;m clear on this - I&#39;ve disagreed with Sandra on this and other issues -<br/>
but I&#39;m going to try to explain what I feel she is saying here. There are<br/>
some lists where you can say and do what you want and so can everyone else<br/>
equally. And these serve a great purpose on both sides  - hmmm - scratch<br/>
that - more like the whole spectrum of ways of seeing and dealing with<br/>
subjects. On the other hand, there are others (such as this one - I am just<br/>
now understanding) which take a different model - and that is to allow<br/>
certain types of thought to have some more sway. Now you might agree or<br/>
disagree with the thoughts which are able to come through here (I often find<br/>
myself on the other side) but it&#39;s a different model. Perhaps the part that<br/>
I have not yet understood - although I am understanding more the original<br/>
vision ( I think ) is how this way aligns with unschooling. For myself, I&#39;m<br/>
looking at this forum now as an exception in the sense that it is intended<br/>
for adults who are able to judge for themselves if those in a position to<br/>
moderate are giving them what they need or not - as opposed to the<br/>
vulnerable position in which children find themselves being not respected by<br/>
someone in a position of authority over them. No one here is really in<br/>
authority over any of us - if we choose to view them that way - that&#39;s<br/>
really happening in our heads. We&#39;re free to come and go - delete, argue or<br/>
just disregard. I find myself stopping in an argument with moderators here<br/>
and thinking - ok - I disagree - they know it - moving on. If we were<br/>
personally sitting in a room having a cup of coffee together - there would<br/>
be no moderation - I might approach it differently. But I&#39;m beginning to<br/>
understand the ideas behind how it&#39;s being approached. That last letter<br/>
actually showed me something I hadn&#39;t been looking at before. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I think<br/>
automatically we (or at least I - and I&#39;ve noticed others in these groups)<br/>
assume that bulletin boards are going to be the more egalitarian of these<br/>
models for interaction. I know I have and now this response you&#39;ve made has<br/>
put it into a different perspective. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think some people want ALL discussion lists or message boards to have the <br/>
same aims and policies.  Some ARE for chit-chat, bonding purposes.  Some <br/>
aren&#39;t.  People get grumpy on both sides.  My husband is on two Norse folklore <br/>
lists, and one is very chatty, and one is more businesslike and scholarly.  Both <br/>
get complaints, I hear.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an unschooling phenomenon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m still not sure how I<br/>
feel about that issue - I vacillate more when I think in terms of its<br/>
application to general population as opposed to for myself alone -=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the only portal to unschooling.   Good!<br/>
(It&#39;s not even the only list I&#39;m on, and there are tons I&#39;m not on, and those <br/>
where it is nonsensically claimed that all opinions are equally valid are <br/>
lists I have no interest whatsoever in being part of.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I like that you have indicated<br/>
that sometimes one approach is applicable and at other times another.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on a couple of teaparty lists too. &lt;g&gt;  We talk about our sexlives, our <br/>
dogs, and house repairs.   I can easily tell the difference between a workparty <br/>
and a lounge-about, look-at-the-best-Johnny-Depp-scenes day off.   I see this <br/>
list as a workparty that occasionally, on a slack day, might have an &quot;Ah, <br/>
Alan Rickman... isn&#39;t he wonderful?&quot; afternoon.<br/>

I have not yet understood - although I am understanding more the original<br/>
vision ( I think ) is how this way aligns with unschooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If every book contained all information, would that align better with <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
If no club had a name and purpose, and all humans were equally welcome to <br/>
join any club, would that align better with unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I think it would make for some pretty worthless books and clubs.<br/>

useless.<br/>

that it is intended for adults who are able to judge for themselves if those in a <br/>

<br/>
Every forum in the world, electronic or otherwise, is that way.<br/>
<br/>
Only the slow-witted and insects can fall into a jar and think they can&#39;t <br/>
possibly get back out again.  (Okay, and some small animals, or if the pit is big <br/>
enough, maybe lions in Tarzan movies.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-No one here is really in authority over any of us - if we choose to view <br/>
them that way - that&#39;s really happening in our heads.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not happening in most people&#39;s heads.<br/>
<br/>
There are some people who aren&#39;t as mentally clear and healthy as others.  <br/>
Should we cater to them?  Banish them?  Work around them?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;m assuming people who managed to find this are competent adults or <br/>
teens who have an interest in the topic and who have read the main page at yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
It has always baffled and embarrassed me that some people will become angry <br/>
(or distraught, or crazed) because they feel that unschoolers are advocating <br/>
being really gentle with children, but we&#39;re not treating every person who comes <br/>
by the way we treat our children.   The people who come by are not my <br/>
children, nor usually ANYone&#39;s children.  They&#39;re adults looking for information.  I <br/>
want to give them information, I don&#39;t want to ask them what they want for <br/>
lunch and make their beds and wash their socks.  I don&#39;t even want to hold their <br/>
hands while they take two or three years to get past the basic questions (and <br/>
some people do seem to want that, but meanwhile their children are <br/>
languishing).<br/>

I like to think of myself as a gatekeeper. Just because we are Unschooling<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m obliged to invite every blowhard or hateful person or<br/>
salesman who knocks on my door into my home. Cacophony might be an<br/>
occasional side effect, but it is not a particular goal.<br/>

<br/>
No . . .  There aren&#39;t just two kinds of lists either, but there ARE millions <br/>
of lists, and anyone who isn&#39;t liking a list she&#39;s on should trot on off and <br/>
do something she DOES like.<br/>
<br/>
The people who are most valuable on a list like this are those who are <br/>
actively helping other people understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The people who are least valuable on a list like this are those who are <br/>
divisive and obnoxious without ever having been or having intended to help anyone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and others (where the moderator<br/>
<br/>
chooses what the participants have the chance to view) -=-<br/>
<br/>
How could a moderator prevent a list participant from viewing all the rest of <br/>
the world?<br/>
<br/>
If a person looks into a list like this (with his head in, like Winnie the <br/>
Pooh, and the rest of him showing outside) and complains that he can&#39;t see the <br/>
rest of the world, that is a failing on the part of the Pooh.<br/>
<br/>
There is much cacophony (&quot;o&quot; there, sounds/phon) in the world, and sometimes <br/>
people JUST want to hear the Rolling Stones or Handel, or the voice of a <br/>
certain child, or they want to read what they&#39;ve chosen to read about.   I know of <br/>
no one who wants to be randomly subjected to troublemaking nonsense.   And the <br/>
description of this group pretty much says what the topic is, and <br/>
troublemaking nonsense isn&#39;t it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make an unschooling list and advertise it here because you&#39;re <br/>
sure yours would be more helpful to unschoolers, feel free to list the address <br/>
here.   You might draw more participants if you first spend a lot of time and <br/>
energy being really helpful to them in their unschooling.  <br/>

I suppose the crux of the problem is we do see differences of opinion about what is nonsense and what is not.<br/>
<br/>
(from another post and poster)<br/>
<br/>
**Aside from the equivocation issue (we can come back to that),**<br/>

From www.dictionary.com<br/>
<br/>
equivocation<br/>
<br/>
n 1: a statement that is not literally false but that cleverly avoids an<br/>
unpleasant truth [syn: evasion] 2: intentionally vague or ambiguous [syn:<br/>
prevarication, evasiveness] 3: falsification by means of vague or ambiguous<br/>

Well Betsy, you asked:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;How does it benefit anyone&#39;s unschooling to get down and wrestle about<br/>
topics like &quot;equivocation&quot;?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the dictionary meaning of the word makes me think that it is<br/>
something to avoid on this list, and probably in dealing with our children<br/>
too. <br/>
<br/>
Not that anyone on this list seemed to be recommending it, even if it is a<br/>
practice of ordinary parenting - like saying &quot;maybe later&quot; when you really<br/>
mean, have made the decision already, &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
