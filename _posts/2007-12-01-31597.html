 </span></blockquote>I know! We had a neopets account a few years ago and it was fun. Kids<br/>
weren&#39;t really intrigued by it at the time, but I played. :)  Now they are<br/>
interested and want their own accounts. So we signed up and discovered that<br/>
things require &quot;neocash&quot; now. Appreciate the heads-up on the free stuff -<br/>
that rocks!!<br/>
<br/>
All the sites the kids really like right now - such as brainpop, adventure<br/>
quest, club penguin - allow limited free play, but require a subscription or<br/>
purchase of &quot;points&quot; or whatever the platform calls money (poe, bucks, etc).<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to wrap my head around it... and figure out how it&#39;s possible to<br/>
afford these subscriptions and purchases each month for every site. Club<br/>
Penguin is fairly reasonable - $5.95 - but others want $30 to $50 or more a<br/>
month to be a &quot;full&quot; member. It starts adding up fast!<br/>
<br/>
We just got Mehalje a BarbieGirl mp3 player ($50) which allows her to use<br/>
all the features of the bariegirl website - hooking the player to the<br/>
computer is the only option available to get full access. After plugging it<br/>
in and registering it, we found out it only gives her a 1 year subscription<br/>
to the site. Not saying she&#39;ll still be interested in it a year from now,<br/>
but if she is I guess the site designers expect us to go out and buy another<br/>
mp3 player to continue her subscription?<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go, kids want to run to the movie store.<br/>

neopoints to buy the wearable stuff, only neocash.<br/>

Good news is the Advent calendar has given us a FREE wearable item on<br/>
each day so far.<br/>

I&#39;ve gotten wearable things as prizes here and there, and so they&#39;re  <br/>
not all that way.<br/>
