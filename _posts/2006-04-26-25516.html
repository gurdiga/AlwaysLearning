<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102494097">I&#39;ve always thought this too, even before there was podcasting.  I would be <br/>
driving all over L.A. listening to books on tape, or some fairly good radio <br/>
stations with my kids, and we would often be away from a computer until late at <br/>
night.  Then, I&#39;d be falling asleep in front of the screen, trying to keep up <br/>
with the latest hot topics.  Always wished I could be listening to posts from <br/>
my favorite lists, or have someone reading articles from my favorite newspapers <br/>
and magazines.  I love NPR, Air America, Pacifica, and Democracy Now, but <br/>
sometimes I would rather hear about subjects that are closer to my daily life, to <br/>
the way that I am actually living. Unschooling podcasts would be great.  Of <br/>
course, something like this might already exist.  There is so much private <br/>
podcasting going on these days, it&#39;s hard to find all that is available. <br/>
<br/>
There is a small podcasting studio here, in one of the artist&#39;s lofts <br/>
buildings downtown, called The Brewery.  They help folks do podcasting, teach about <br/>
it, rent out the space, etc.  I&#39;ll see the guy tomorrow night, and ask him <br/>
about setting something up.  <br/>
