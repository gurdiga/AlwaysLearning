<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226452629">Hi, all! Sorry for just jumping in and blabbing my fool head off without an intro.... :-) Here goes...<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m Rachelle...as you know we just moved from Colorado to North Idaho.  I&#39;ve been married to Shawn for almost 10 years and we have an 8 year old girl named Kennedy. I&#39;m also the proud Surrogate mama to Kayla, who just turned 5 last week (does that mean I can&#39;t blame this &quot;baby weight&quot; on her anymore!!?? ;-)  She lives in the Bay area and also part time in Hawaii with her Mom and Dad. Kayla&#39;s homeschooled, too! :)<br/>
<br/>
  Kennedy went to public school for preschool and most of kindergarten.  I pulled her out to homeschool and we&#39;ve just been having a blast ever since.  She starts 3rd grade next week.  <br/>
<br/>
  I pulled her out for several reasons...one of which being that I used to teach....hehehe... *that&#39;s* telling, isn&#39;t it? I know how hard teachers try to give kids the attention they need and it simply *can&#39;t* happen anymore.  Too many kids, too much red tape and paperwork, not enough help, time or money.  I also had a run-in with the admin. at her school and they proved to me that the parents&#39; opinions meant jack squat to them....so she came home with me.<br/>
<br/>
  Technically, we are not unschoolers (yet!) I hope you don&#39;t ban us! ;) I HATED school until I went to college... college is about LEARNING (gasp!), not popularity or money and all the rubbish that high school is about...and I was hooked instantly... I kept getting degree after degree and loving every second.  (and I have the student loans to prove it!) LOL...but it&#39;s OK...I feel that I am a more well rounded person than I would have been had I not done all that (of course, not that that applies to everyone...but it&#39;s MY personal path).  What college did was get the joy of sharpened #2 pencils, A pluses and chalk dust planted firmly in my heart... and so that&#39;s how I started our HSing... kind of school at home.<br/>
<br/>
  Well, as you all know....THAT DOESN&#39;T WORK VERY WELL! lol.... so while we still use curricula, I am starting to read up on unschooling and more &quot;real life&quot; learning and am anxious to start incorporating that kind of thing more into our days.  I ordered two books from Amazon on unschooling that just came last week and I look forward to reading them...and of course, learning from all of you!<br/>
<br/>
  So that&#39;s us.... basically, we managed to move from one conservative, right wing, heavily religious state to another, and we&#39;re kind of the *opposite* of all that....so we&#39;re a little lonely sometimes and looking forward to meeting some other HSers that might share more of our views and values.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for letting me join you!<br/>
  Rachelle<br/>

LOL...don&#39;t say that! You make me feel like I&#39;ll be surrounded forever! Tee hee....just kidding...<br/>
We&#39;ve actually met a very nice family here (a Preacher and his family, no less!) who are very sweet and very secure in their faith...therefore, they have no problem with us and our beliefs. They feel no need to convert us and we get along just fine... but I&#39;ve found them to be rare :-(<br/>
I lived in So California for a while and still have family there and it doesn&#39;t seem to be quite so conservative...BUT...maybe I was just living in the wrong places...you never know. AND...all the bleeding heart liberals in the world couldn&#39;t make me go back there...no offense to anyone who lives there...but it just WASN&#39;T for me...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Santa Cruz County in California isn&#39;t right wing or conservative.<br/>
In 1984 when Reagan was sweeping the country and especially CA,<br/>
Santa Cruz County was the only county in CA in which he did not<br/>
get a majority.  We have lots of Pagans, lots of Buddhists, lots<br/>
of hippies (old and young).  If you watched the Survivor in Africa,<br/>
Lex is a citizen of this area.  With all his tats and piercings he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be worth a second glance on the streets here!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of homeschoolers.  We have second generation homeschoolers.<br/>
The entire San Francisco Bay Area is fairly liberal.  But it&#39;s one of the<br/>
most expensive places in the country in which to live...<br/>

but unfortunately with budget cuts it was frozen. You do have lots of great<br/>
unschooling groups and things there plus people who are accepting of all<br/>
things &quot;new.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But as you say it&#39;s so expensive to live there. We lived in Hawaii for 3<br/>
years and SC area makes HI look cheap!<br/>
