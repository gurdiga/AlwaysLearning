OK, so where do you get decent Dalmatians? I haven&#39;t seen a good one since<br/>
101 (Ways to Overbreed) Dalmatians came out. There was a wave of puppies<br/>
when the cartoon video first came out, then another when the live-action<br/>
movie came out and IMO it will take years for the breed to recover. Jack<br/>
Russells are another breed that&#39;s suffered from popularity, and I see a lot<br/>
of people getting them who shouldn&#39;t. Not you, you&#39;ll do fine! :) I just<br/>
wish they&#39;d only use mixed breeds in movies so people wouldn&#39;t run out and<br/>
buy the latest fad... ::sigh::<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are English Shepherds in commercials, but the people who own them<br/>
don&#39;t usually tell the breed; they&#39;ll say it&#39;s a mix or let people assume<br/>
it&#39;s a border collie.  English Shepherds have the opposite problem of most<br/>
dog breeds -- too few, not too many.  There are about 600 individuals, many<br/>
of the neutered, and some tendency to hip dysplasia.  The last thing the<br/>
breed needs is popularity; just look what &quot;Babe&quot; did to border collies!!<br/>

must leave to attend a volunteer appreciation dinner where I must<br/>

tonight to write, write, write about Dalmatians and rats, and guinea<br/>
