Sorry for the lengthy soap opera. But I thought it would help answer some <br/>
questions.<br/>
*******************<br/>
One thing occurred to me as I read your description of what Dad did in honor <br/>
of his wife, and the attitude of everyone about her.<br/>
<br/>
I kept reading how perfect she was: homeschooling mom, creative, strong, <br/>
mature, wonderful. She&#39;s a saint.<br/>
<br/>
But she&#39;s NOT that perfect. She died and left them, and the kids are really, <br/>
really pissed and feel guilty because they&#39;re pissed. They can&#39;t act pissed at <br/>
mom because it wasn&#39;t her fault and she&#39;s perfect. So they have to be okay <br/>
because Mom would&#39;ve wanted it that way.<br/>
<br/>
I think if they can start talking with a counselor it&#39;ll help.  <br/>

that&#39;s a really good point, Kathryn.  My grandfather had been dead 20 years before my Mom realized she was still angry with him for dying.  I believe the youngest sister is still angry at him for that  -- she  almost never speaks of him, and has huge trust issues, alonf with a genuine deep-seated scorn for men.  The only memory I&#39;ve heard her share is of the day he died, and how angry her Mom was that he was dead.  <br/>
