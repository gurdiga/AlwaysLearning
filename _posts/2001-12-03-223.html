<div id="ygrps-yiv-804239843"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Can anyone recommend other books....my kids are 9 and 5.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have a book called, &quot;My Friends&#39; Beliefs: A Young Reader&#39;s Guide To World <br/>
Religions&quot; by Hiley H. Ward.  I got it from Chinaberry several years back.  <br/>
I&#39;m not certain if they still carry it.<br/>
<br/>
The back cover describes the book this way: &quot;Worshipers tread many different <br/>
paths in their search for peace, love, and eternal happiness.  This book <br/>
will tell you about the more familiar paths or faiths, and about some of the <br/>
lesser-know faiths, too... Hiley Ward takes us across the U.S. to visit <br/>
various worshiping groups.  At each stop we meet a young person who shares <br/>
with us the special ceremony that marks one&#39;s coming-of-age in his or her <br/>
own faith.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The book is not exhaustive in any respect, but a good jumping off point.  <br/>
The appendix lists addresses of the religions and groups discussed in the <br/>
book.<br/>
