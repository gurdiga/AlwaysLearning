Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Appropriating the word Unschooling<br/>
Date: Fri, Apr 19, 2013 6:01 AM<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had an e-mail from India this morning with some quotes discouraging people from thinking unschooling is anything remotely pure or good  [big paraphrase on my part; honestly, it sounded like the strident dad from Louisiana saying everything was learning and all learning was unschooling].  I saw something yesterday from Australia that was dismayingï¿½a recommendation NOT to try to do better, and NOT to focus on children.    Someone on facebook offered to recommend some &quot;nonjudgmental unschooling&quot; sites.<br/>
<br/>
That was within 24 hours.   <br/>
<br/>
This is from a few weeks ago, here:  &quot;Shifting of the meaning of labels happens in politics, religion and other areas. Maybe something like that will happen with &#39;unschooling&#39;. I hope we&#39;re not left with &quot;Very Radical Unschooling&quot;, though!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was a time a few years ago that Dayna asked me by e-mail whether I owned the term &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;  I said I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Many times in the past week I have remembered that moment and wished I had just said &quot;yes, I do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t like people claiming to own phrases  or words.  I wish others felt that way, too.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much rhetoric that&#39;s cruel, to sell a position (for money or otherwise).  Pro-life (dividing into life and death), rather than no-choice.   I&#39;m tired and not thinking of other examples.<br/>
<br/>
It the term &quot;unschooling&quot; has been adopted by two magazines and a national website (in Australia) that rejected it until just very recently, it&#39;s like a huge tie has come up carrying all the gunk and junk possible, and when it goes down again, the cleanup may never be completed.  <br/>
<br/>
Kind of frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I send out Just Add Light every night, and am planning details of in-person opportunities in Massachusetts, Lisbon/Leiden/London (and maybe The Yarrow Valley), Albuquerque, Adelaide/Melbourne/Bega/Newcastle/Gold Coast, Maine and New Hampshire.  I&#39;m going to go and speak as clearly and as persuasively as I can (and Joyse with me for much of that, and others, here and there) to people who want to really deeply understand what it is they&#39;re changing their lives to do.  <br/>
<br/>
If I need to call it something different, that&#39;s not evidence of more understanding in the world as a whole.<br/>

<br/>
Two days of presentations and group discussions and it will be the first weekend of April, 2014!  <br/>
The site is still being decided on.  <br/>
<br/>
In the three weeks before that, Joyce Fetteroll and I will be in Adelaide, Melbourne, Bega and Newcastle.<br/>
