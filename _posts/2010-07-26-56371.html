<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854332329">In defense of &quot;C-I-O,&quot; someone wrote on someone&#39;s blog somewhere far  <br/>
away:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I suppose I’ve never been in a family where either parent had the  <br/>
time to be at the beck and call of their babies 24/7. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s lazy and chickenshit for people to turn phrases into  <br/>
letters like &quot;C-I-O,&quot; pronounced &quot;cee eye oh&quot; instead of &quot;cry it  <br/>
out.&quot;    &quot;Cry it out&quot; is not harder to type than something with  <br/>
hyphens.  It&#39;s not longer to say, it&#39;s still three syllables.  But  <br/>
giving it a secret-jargon term makes it seem more distant, more a  <br/>
general practice than a decision, more scientific, less about *crying.*<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s too new, too &quot;modern,&quot; too much attempt to turn flesh-and- <br/>
blook crying baby into something chrome and glass, or at least  <br/>
organically treated crib-wood.<br/>
<br/>
But that was tied in with the phrase &quot;at...beck and call.&quot;  Because of  <br/>
my many years of medieval-studies hobby and my long interest in  <br/>
language, I know a lot about &quot;beck and call.&quot;  I&#39;ve thought about it  <br/>
and written about it.   What I wrote was not about babies, it was  <br/>
about ladies-in-waiting and other attendants in a tableau situation, a  <br/>
kind of theatrical make-believe situation where I&#39;ve been a coach and  <br/>
director.<br/>
<br/>
I am at my family&#39;s beck and call, because I like them.  If I have  <br/>
house guests, I am at their beck and call.  Nurses are at the beck and  <br/>
call of patients.  Flight attendants are at the beck and call of  <br/>
pilots first and then passengers.  Retail store clerks are at the beck  <br/>
and call of customers unless assigned to stay behind the cash register  <br/>
(convenience store clerks are not going to leave the liquor and  <br/>
gambling cards to go 20 feet to help you find the cheese crackers).<br/>
<br/>
That phrase needs be added here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/phrases">http://sandradodd.com/phrases</a><br/>

<br/>
P.S.<br/>
For anyone who&#39;s into language, or curious about what my hobby was  <br/>
before it was writing about unschooling, some &quot;beck and call&quot; notes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ranking people shouldn&#39;t have to say much to get someone to come  <br/>
closer. The concept of being at someone&#39;s &quot;beck and call&quot; means close  <br/>
enough that a gesture (beck) or call will get them there in a jiffy  <br/>
(or, more likely, in the nonce, meaning &quot;in an instance&quot;) They can&#39;t  <br/>
come quick, because &quot;quick&quot; meant &quot;alive&quot; in period, not fast  <br/>
(besides, even now teachers will tell you to use &quot;quickly.&quot;). If  <br/>
someone said &quot;quickly&quot; it meant &quot;lively,&quot; which can also be used in  <br/>
terms of speed, as in &quot;step lively.&quot; Fast meant stuck, constant, or  <br/>
fixed. Supper was &quot;fixed&quot; when it was put on the table. (In the  <br/>
southern U.S. people still &quot;fix supper&quot; even though it&#39;s not broken.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that.  It&#39;s part of this:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008498325"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;I suppose I’ve never been in a family where either parent had the<br/>
&gt; time to be at the beck and call of their babies 24/7.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this was said with sarcasm, as if it would be readily apparent <br/>
to anybody that the very idea of parents being at the beck and call of a <br/>
baby 24/7 would be ridiculous. Poor little babies.  For some reason I&#39;ve <br/>
been through a week of being around parents being quite mean to small <br/>
children. I&#39;m looking forward to hanging out with a whole bunch of <br/>
unschoolers on Wednesday and being soothed by their sweetness to their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Roya and I had an interesting conversation yesterday. She&#39;s working at a <br/>
summer daycare program - a really really good one run by a person who <br/>
has the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; idea that children should be free to play and <br/>
have fun and she tries to make daycare as free and in the control of the <br/>
kids, themselves, as possible. Anyway, Roya plays with the kids there, <br/>
or facilitates their play, and she was saying how surprisingly easy it <br/>
is, even for her, to say &quot;no&quot; to kids&#39; requests, when she could find <br/>
ways to say yes. Lots of the kids are very needy in the sense that they <br/>
very very obviously are not getting enough attention from parents. They <br/>
will cling to her and hug her and tell her they love her. And lots of <br/>
them are obviously very restricted and controlled at home (and at <br/>
school) and some have really awful parents, and lots of them have a <br/>
habit of trying to find the limits or boundaries and pushing them. She <br/>
has a group of kids to keep an eye on - her job is to keep them safe <br/>
while pretty much doing every thing she possibly can to support their <br/>
interests and meet their needs. Keep in mind, this is a 25 yo who has <br/>
been unschooled and not had arbitrary limits or controls in her own <br/>
life. And STILL she said she hears, &quot;No,&quot; come out of her mouth far too <br/>
frequently. She backs up, she said, over and over throughout the day and <br/>
says, &quot;Well, maybe, let&#39;s see if we can do that somehow.&quot; She says the <br/>
&quot;no&quot; comes from feeling pressured  - that the neediness and <br/>
demandingness and the pushiness of some of the kids gets wearing and the <br/>
&quot;no&quot; is more to say, &quot;No more,&quot; than really &quot;no&quot; to that particular <br/>
request.  I told her I thought that was sometimes the same kind of <br/>
reason for parents. She said she was getting really good practice in <br/>
finding ways to say yes more. So we talked about some of the problems <br/>
people have had with that concept &quot;say yes more&quot; and how it made some <br/>
people think they have to say yes ALL the time to absolutely everything. <br/>
Roya said she was getting really good at thinking about what would <br/>
&quot;serve the purpose&quot; of what a kid was asking. I liked that way of <br/>
thinking about how we respond, as parents, to requests....figure out <br/>
what will &quot;serve the purpose&quot; for the child.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - what surprised her was how easy it was to slip into &quot;no&quot; as a <br/>
default when being with a group of kids and how it took conscious effort <br/>
on her part not to do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905922137">CIO... when I first started seeing that I kept forgetting what it was.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest reason I got into attachment parenting is I don&#39;t hear<br/>
well-- sheer luck. At first I didn&#39;t want to miss something important<br/>
and it was about anxiety. I grew less worried and still didn&#39;t want to<br/>
miss anything.<br/>
<br/>
Had I been younger I probably would have taken my mom&#39;s offer of help<br/>
after the birth, but I didn&#39;t care if the house got messier. I was<br/>
busy recuperating and getting to know Karl. Over the phone the advice<br/>
was to not let him monopolize my time. Something about getting back to<br/>
normal? By that time I had had years of ignoring parental advice with<br/>
little or no ill effects.<br/>
<br/>
On finding ways to say yes, like Roya is finding. That&#39;s an<br/>
interesting read. Now that Karl&#39;s 7, it helps to say some of that to<br/>
him, that if I can&#39;t say yes to what he asks I can see how to say yes<br/>
to what he&#39;s asking. For instance, doing a particular activity might<br/>
not be possible right that moment but saying to him that we can find a<br/>
way to do something similar if the big part of his reasoning is about<br/>
something else. So let&#39;s do this instead... and that may work just<br/>
fine. Or the original request could become available later on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892971177">-=-She doesn&#39;t know how to make her kids &quot;tow the line&quot; now because  <br/>
her kids now<br/>
know they have the &quot;upper hand&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes &quot;Tow the line&quot; is written and defended as &quot;toe the line&quot;-- <br/>
not to move until someone tells you to, but to stay right there (as at  <br/>
the starting line of a race.  Be exactly where someone else tells you  <br/>
to be, down to your toe and don&#39;t move until directed.<br/>
<br/>
I used to see it written that way more than &quot;tow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Upper hand&quot; my first guess is the batter-choosing method of hands on  <br/>
bats and whoever has the top &quot;grab&quot; wins.<br/>
<br/>
Oh hey!  Someone agrees with me:<br/>
<br/>
Also, whip hand. A dominating or controlling position, as in Once you  <br/>
let Jeff get the upper hand there&#39;ll be no stopping him, or When it  <br/>
comes to checkers, my son-in-law generally has the whip hand. The  <br/>
first term alludes to an ancient game in which each player in turn  <br/>
grasps a stick with one hand, beginning from the bottom, and the last  <br/>
who can put his hand at the top wins. Its figurative use dates from  <br/>
the late 1400s. The variant alludes to the driver who holds the whip  <br/>
in a horse-drawn vehicle; it was being used figuratively by the late  <br/>
1600s<br/>
<br/>
I was going to mention &quot;having the whip hand&quot;--didn&#39;t mean they could  <br/>
whip the other person, it meant they were driving the coach/wagon/ <br/>
horses.  I know it from Jane Austen, a woman telling her son-in-law  <br/>
that now she had the whip hand over him, because he had married the  <br/>
daughter and couldn&#39;t give her back.  (Sense and Sensibility:  &quot; you  <br/>
may abuse me as you please said the good natured old lady you have  <br/>
taken Charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there I  <br/>
have the whip hand of you &quot; ).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938548866">What I found says &quot;toe the line&quot; was about loyalty to party politics<br/>
in the House of Commons (or Parliament.. I forget which). Getting the<br/>
&quot;upper hand&quot; is very old (according to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/)">http://www.phrases.org.uk/)</a>. A<br/>
game of chance in the 15th century, the details of which are lost<br/>
except the part where players competed to top other hands chasing up a<br/>
bat, hand over hand, like in sandlot baseball. The last hand could<br/>
control the bat if they were able to hold it without dropping it... it<br/>
couldn&#39;t just be a couple fingers that couldn&#39;t hold on.<br/>

Has to do with staying behind the starting line of a footrace.<br/>
<br/>
According to www.etymology.com<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Upper hand &quot;advantage&quot; is late 15c., probably from wrestling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I was thinking card games, which is what wiktionary suggests.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upper_hand">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upper_hand</a> )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So both phrases have to do with contests with winners and losers.<br/>
