<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048832613">I have read that recent medical thought on these two<br/>
syndromes is that they are in fact the same illness. <br/>
Some patients manifest different main symptoms, but<br/>
can basically have any amongst the symptoms from both,<br/>
because they are in fact the same problem.  It&#39;s a new<br/>
thought on the classification of these illnesses,<br/>
stemming from a greater number of cases to study over<br/>
time, where they can note and guage similarites<br/>
between symptoms.<br/>

does seem to be one important difference.  People with CFS are likely to <br/>
exercise-intolerant, whereas people with fibro tend to be helped by careful <br/>
exercise.  Possibly it&#39;s a matter of which symptom tends to be the most <br/>
bothersome.  For me, even though I&#39;m diagnosed with fibro, the biggest <br/>
problem is the fatigue.<br/>

I just read a book that discussed a possible link between fibromyalgia and<br/>
thyroid problems.  Seems worth making sure your doctor has checked the<br/>
thyroid out extensively.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup.  My thyroid problems started first.  That&#39;s partly why it took so long <br/>
to diagnose the fibro.  I was still thinking that the fatigue was from the <br/>
thyroid.<br/>
