It also touches excellently on the idea of balance which stumps so  <br/>
many new unschoolers.  I&#39;ll response to this with more about that.<br/>
<br/>
Those quoted are Schuyler (the first quote) and Joanna:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
====================================<br/>
<br/>
-=-Candy fed with love beats the heck out of broccoli eaten out of  <br/>
fear. And my kids like broccoli even in the face of a jar filled with  <br/>
candy and a drawer filled with snacks. Television watched as a family,  <br/>
altogether talking about Shirley Valentine or giant squids or Sandy  <br/>
the Squirrel and living as an astronaut under the sea, well that&#39;s so  <br/>
amazing, it&#39;s so many kinds of connection and conversation and joy,  <br/>
whatever fear you live with isn&#39;t anything against the absolute  <br/>
pleasure of hanging out together that I&#39;ve got with my kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is the heart of the matter for me--all the discussion about  <br/>
whether sugar is good or bad, or whether t.v. is good or bad takes the  <br/>
focus away from unschooling and sets my head reeling. The grounding  <br/>
force is the relationship with my children. And that&#39;s something that  <br/>
happens in the moment--in many moments. Will the moments be made of  <br/>
fear and control, or will they be made of something more connecting,  <br/>
with substance and trust that they have real thinking brains?<br/>
<br/>
People want to look at these issues as though there are only two  <br/>
options: free reign or limit. Black or white thinking. There is a  <br/>
whole world of conversation and relationship with your children  <br/>
between the two extremes. And that&#39;s where unschooling lives--a child  <br/>
exploring their world in connection with a parent.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to be a parent who enlarges your child&#39;s world and helps  <br/>
them to find their own power and hone their decision making and  <br/>
critical thinking abilities, or will you be a parent who limits and  <br/>
closes down your child&#39;s world and imposes your own ideas of right and  <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Stand WITH your child to navigate these issues, not in their way. The  <br/>
more you let them make important decisions, the more they will think  <br/>
them through and strive to make good ones for themselves.<br/>
