<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069051390">A while ago I compiled some strategies unschoolers had come up with  <br/>
to handle brushing teeth. I posted them and finally found time to  <br/>

Originally I figured it would be a list of little things, like not  <br/>
using toothpaste. But it turned into little windows peering in on  <br/>
unschoolers finding ways to help children respectfully.<br/>

move from one activity to another. (There will be more at some point,  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just read it!  Cool page!  I was expecting but didn&#39;t see it, the use<br/>
of a water pick.  That is what my youngest is using these days.  She<br/>
puts toothpaste in her mouth and kind of chews it around and then uses<br/>
the water pick to spray off food and get inbetween teeth.  She refuses<br/>
to use a toothbrush, she really dislikes brushing.  We&#39;ve tried all<br/>
kinds of toothbrushes and toothpastes, and none of them really got her<br/>
into brushing her teeth.  The water pick works great.  We also use the<br/>
flouride free Tom&#39;s apricot toothpaste, since she doesn&#39;t like any of<br/>
the other flavors.  The flouride free Tom&#39;s strawberry was her favorite<br/>
but we can&#39;t find it anymore, it has banana and flouride in it now and<br/>
is no longer enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 7 and she&#39;s never had a cavity, even when she wasn&#39;t cleaning her<br/>
teeth much which happened a lot.  She&#39;s also never lost any of her baby<br/>
teeth, so some of those teeth she&#39;s had for almost the full 7 yrs!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060947932">Boy.  There&#39;s nothing like going to Joyce&#39;s site for a wonderful<br/>
calming dose of sanity.  We still need that page on toothbrushing,<br/>
although we now treat the process more gently and easily than we have<br/>
in the past.  Very akin to pottying.  It&#39;s amazing the anxiety we have<br/>
about certain things, really.  The information you have there is very<br/>
very helpful.  And transitions... for us, it&#39;s because Karl loves<br/>
being home and I get so nutty sometimes to go out.  More helpful<br/>
thoughts there, Joyce.  Thanks very much.<br/>

People say chocolate is toxic to dogs too.  It must take a LOT.  And  <br/>
if it&#39;s so toxic, why don&#39;t people just buy their dogs a big box of  <br/>
Godiva when they&#39;re terminally ill instead of taking them tothe vet  <br/>
for a shot?   I don&#39;t think &quot;toxic&quot; means what people think it means  <br/>
sometimes.  The stories about what will kill dogs seem often to have  <br/>
more to do with wanting to control dogs or deprive them than anything  <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
We have a chocolate-eating dog.  THAT is something she will steal,  <br/>
even off a table, if it&#39;s left there overnight or for a couple of  <br/>
days.   I guess she figures if we wanted it we would&#39;ve eaten it  <br/>
already.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s something in the chocolate that&#39;s toxic. (Theobromine it says.)  <br/>
Milk chocolate has a little. Baker&#39;s chocolate has the most. Also  <br/>
depends on the dog&#39;s weight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724878573">What I know from my years of being married to a veterinarian ( my first husband) is that chocolate CAN be toxic for certain dogs more than others and it depends on how much they eat.<br/>
Grapes and raisin can also be toxic to dogs.<br/>
Xylitol CAN make them go into some kind of low blood sugar crash.<br/>
Again all those substancesa above can cause toxidity in some dogs and no problems in others.<br/>
Just a precaution. In my house my smooth fox terrier usually does not like xylitol mints but I think she has grabbed some gums that I retrieved from her mouth. The xylitol crystals she does not care for it so its is not a problem.<br/>

good chocolates as a special gift, then left the package on the back seat while <br/>
she ran into another store. Her two medium sized dogs snarfed the package <br/>
between them. They went into seizures before she got home and spent the next week <br/>
in the veterinary hospital.<br/>
