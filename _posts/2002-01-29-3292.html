<div id="ygrps-yiv-356452920">***&lt;&lt;Now just because I choose to avoid tv, I am not sitting in judgement of<br/>
others who choose tv.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can say that, but by banning it from your house, you are saying it is a<br/>
very bad thing, bad for babies, bad for children, unnatural, harmful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, it sounds like you are saying, that a person has no rights to have<br/>
choices in their lives, if one makeschoices it automatically implies a<br/>
judgement upon another&#39;s choice.  So where do you draw the line then, on<br/>
choices in your life, what you are willing to be exposed to and expose your<br/>
family to?  Are there no lines in your life at all?  Is anything that exists<br/>
fair game for your family?  How about dangerous things that are hard to<br/>
argue about like heroin?***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not Sandra, but I do definitely draw the line at my 7 year old taking<br/>
heroin. I&#39;m sure she would learn something from it, but I am unreasonably<br/>
adamant.<br/>
<br/>
Once again: drug use is illegal. Television is not. That&#39;s one big<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*** If you do have lines in your life are you the pot<br/>
calling the kettle black because you are criticizing me for having different<br/>
lines than you.***<br/>
<br/>
If you are letting your children use heroin, you betcha I&#39;m sitting in<br/>
judgment of you.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said: ***You can say that, but by banning it from your house, you are<br/>
saying it is a<br/>

<br/>
She said it about television, you&#39;re comparing it to heroin. So please tell<br/>
me what part of that quote you have a problem applying to heroin use or<br/>
abuse. I ban it from my house. If my child asked, I would tell her it&#39;s bad<br/>
for babies and children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***Is there no<br/>
difference between saying I do not like a &quot;thing&quot; (tv) for example, and<br/>
passing a judgement on another persons choice to have a tv?***<br/>
<br/>
Sure, there&#39;s a big difference. I can say, &quot;I don&#39;t like cauliflower&quot; and<br/>
you can say, &quot;Really? I love cauliflower&quot; and this is neither of us being<br/>
judgmental of the other.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I could say, &quot;I don&#39;t like cauliflower. I will also not allow my<br/>
children to eat it because a group over there says it causes sinus upset and<br/>
I hear Hitler loved cauliflower&quot; and you, as a cauliflower-eating person,<br/>
might feel I was judging you as not caring about your children&#39;s sinuses and<br/>
possible future as Nazis.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone here cares if you or I like TV. There is a concept<br/>
called unschooling and I (and others) have been arguing that by not trusting<br/>
children to make their own decisions about TV we do them a disservice in the<br/>
pursuit of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***It may be that tv free parents are not free to converse with<br/>
each other on this list***<br/>
<br/>
They absolutely are, as long as by &quot;free&quot; you don&#39;t mean &quot;free from anyone<br/>
else challenging their ideas&quot;. If you DO mean that, it&#39;s a matter for<br/>
private e-mail, or maybe an no-TV support list.<br/>
<br/>
