<div id="ygrps-yiv-47873464">I hope people here will share some of their takes of connections.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s mine from this morning.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days ago, I bought a DVD, LIttle Britain Live.  Holly and  <br/>
I went into a video store to see if High School Musical II was out.   <br/>
December 11, they said.  Holly got interested in that because of Zac  <br/>
Efron, who was in Hairspray, which she&#39;s seen three times, I think.   <br/>
So that&#39;s running backwards through the connections, but I want to  <br/>
run forward.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I was watching Little Britain, videotaped from a stage  <br/>
show (I&#39;ve seen most of the TV episodes through season 3).  One skit  <br/>
was the travel agency, the &quot;Computer says &#39;no&#39;&quot; character.  A mom  <br/>
wanted to take her ill daughter to DisneyWorld.  Her choices were a  <br/>
flight leaving in ten minutes, or a flight to Zimbabwe from which  <br/>
they would have to get to DisneyWorld on foot.  No, the mom thought.   <br/>
So he offered her a flight to Preston.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t guess I&#39;ve ever heard of Preston. The audience reaction and  <br/>
the comedian&#39;s comeback made me curious.  I was watching it on one  <br/>
side of my computer screen while I did e-mail on the other  <br/>
(frequently paused because I also was cleaning the kitchen, eating  <br/>
breakfast, feeding the birds, making my bed, in various bursts of up  <br/>
and down from the computer).<br/>
<br/>
There were maps and official city sites, but I decided to go with  <br/>
Wikipedia, because I know nothing for starters.<br/>
Preston was made the 50th city in England, in the 50th year of the  <br/>
reign of Elizabeth II.  (Just a few years ago.)  The history of  <br/>
Preston, though, as a crossroads and this and that, goes back over  <br/>
1000 years.<br/>
<br/>
I sent the article to my friend Jeff, for the 50th year/50th city  <br/>
part, because he&#39;s really interested in things like that.<br/>
<br/>
I clicked on &quot;Riot Act&quot; because there was a cotton workers&#39; protest  <br/>
incident in the 19th century, and read what Wikipedia had to say  <br/>
about The Riot Act (very, very cool, and all news to me).   I sent  <br/>
that link and a comment to my friend Jon who is the local assistant  <br/>
district attorney in charge of violent crimes.  He&#39;s interested in  <br/>
history too, and he and Jeff and I have all been in the SCA together  <br/>
for a long time.  Jon was formally one of my proteges (for those of  <br/>
you who understand that lingo, and he&#39;s now a Master of the Pelican,  <br/>
but...)<br/>
<br/>
Jon sent this:<br/>
<br/>
=========================<br/>
Ah - reading someone the riot act.  Very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was going to say that this was why we have, as part of  <br/>
the First Amendment, the right of freedom of assembly, but apparently  <br/>
not. :)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether all those reading this will have known already  <br/>
that &quot;The Anglican church&quot; is what Americans tend to call The Church  <br/>
of England, and those who are members of what would have been The  <br/>
Church of England are Episcopalians.<br/>
<br/>
All that has  happened before Marty and Holly ever woke up.  I might  <br/>
share some of it with them, or might not.  It might not be today.   <br/>
They have those kinds of connections going on in their own lives  <br/>
without me, though.  Sometimes they share them.  Sometimes it&#39;s the  <br/>
same day, or sometimes it&#39;s when something I say or see or do reminds  <br/>
them and they hook me up with the puzzle piece they already have, and  <br/>
we go on to build bigger universes in our heads.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Football has been a big connector lately. Hayden loves claw machines and on<br/>
our trip won (bought) a KC Chiefs window hangie thingamabobber. He thought<br/>
we should send it to the &quot;unschoolers who sing the Kansas City Song&quot; (Ken &<br/>
Amy Briggs). When we were at Burger King the other day, the kids&#39; prizes are<br/>
NFL related. He first found KC Chiefs and reiterated his connection to the<br/>
team, which led to a talk of the Briggs&#39; actually living in NY -- &quot;NY has<br/>
TWO teams!!&quot; As he browsed the other teams, he happened upon Cleveland<br/>
Browns -- &quot;Oh! Now I get the joke on Family Guy!! Cleveland&#39;s last name is<br/>
Brown, I thought it was because of his skin color, well it is! Both!&quot; I<br/>
didn&#39;t realize how many football jokes have been on that series, but Hayden<br/>
knew of a few others and it is just now that they&#39;re connecting and<br/>
beginning to make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I never knew how multi-layered most movies and television shows are, until I<br/>
lived the freedom of no censorship with my kids. I&#39;m excited to watch Shrek<br/>
again with Hayden... we&#39;ve not seen it in over a year and I know his sense<br/>
of humor has drastically changed, he&#39;s more aware of innuendo, it will most<br/>
likely be a whole new movie for him. I will miss his *younger* perspective<br/>
as much as I look forward to this *older* one.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the very first time I watched South Park with Hayden, who was<br/>
about 6 at the time. Boy was *I* uncomfortable!!! It was the episode, for<br/>
those who know, where the comet is coming, they&#39;re all gonna die and the two<br/>
dads masturbate one another in the hot tub. I really had no idea how to deal<br/>
with this explanation that surely my kid will demand of me... it never came.<br/>
He didn&#39;t understand the term, moved on to what he *did* understand (a<br/>
different tangent of the story, a different layer), found it funny and then<br/>
didn&#39;t watch the show again for a couple of years. He watches it now and<br/>
though it&#39;s a different understanding than he had at 6, he&#39;s 9 now, he&#39;s not<br/>
watching it through the same filters as I am.<br/>
[not to mention we&#39;ve had many many talks about the guys who make South Park<br/>
and their terrible public school experiences (which has tangent-ed into<br/>
Bowling for Columbine) and the controversy over the Tom Cruise in the Closet<br/>
episode and standing up for your principles (they threatened to pull the<br/>
whole show if the episode was not re-aired - South Park vs Comedy Central vs<br/>
Scientologists) which leads back to Family Guy and when they were going to<br/>
be canceled and they changed Stewie&#39;s words from &quot;laugh and cry&quot; to &quot;efffin<br/>
cry&quot; (check it out with closed captioning!) and the connections go on and on<br/>
and on]<br/>

a gourmet cook, and my oldest daughter loves to cook as well (she made<br/>
French Toast for us this morning, my other daughter made waffles and bacon -<br/>
we had a feast!).  My oldest daughter, Heather, loves to snuggle with her<br/>
dad and watch &quot;Good Eats.&quot;  It&#39;s a great connection for the two of them.<br/>
Heather will often watch a Good Eats and run to make one of the dishes. My<br/>
husband will save some of the episodes to watch with her, and it has<br/>
branched off into much cooking between the two of them, with one or the<br/>
other saving ideas to bring to the other to see if he/she wants to go<br/>
experiment.  The kids love to go online to Alton&#39;s site and look over his<br/>
periodic table of cooking equipment to pick out birthday/holiday gifts for<br/>
their dad and grandpa.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have begun watching &quot;Feasting on Asphalt&quot; and my husband is saving<br/>
those episodes on Tivo to share with Heather.  We love road trips and can<br/>
easily see ourselves taking on a Feasting on Asphalt road trip someday:  we<br/>
love exploring around the country and love adventure, and I am really<br/>
excited to connect with these restaurants Alton has highlighted (can&#39;t speak<br/>
for the rest of the family but they are usually excited about this too).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824879567">We&#39;ve had a lot of Sponge Bob connections lately.  We went to the <br/>
beach last week and that just added to it.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up camping at a beach camp site for a couple of days, then <br/>
came home checked on the cats, then went back to the beach to visit a <br/>
friend from out of town that was staying at a beach cabin (well more <br/>
like big beautiful house that used to be a cabin).  We got there <br/>
later in the day and by the time we&#39;d eaten dinner and such, it was <br/>
dark out.  The kids really wanted to go to the beach still so we went <br/>
in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to the beach hundreds of times, sometimes even at night and <br/>
I&#39;ve never experienced what we experienced that night.  When we were <br/>
walking along the area where everything has washed up, it was <br/>
sparkling like magic.  There were glitters lighting up in the sand <br/>
evertime someone stepped or kicked up sand.  It was the coolest thing <br/>
I&#39;ve ever encountered at the beach.  It turned out to be a type of <br/>
plankton, typically associated with a red tide, however there wasn&#39;t <br/>
a red tide.  It is phospherescent and glows and glitters at night.<br/>
<br/>
The girls were trying to see it with a flashlight and that just made <br/>
it glow more when the lights were off.  They were experimenting with <br/>
how much you could see it doing various things with the sand like <br/>
tossing the sand or stomping or dragging your feet.<br/>
<br/>
That started the whole Sponge Bob stuff all over because of <br/>
Plankton.  The next morning we had planned on getting up early to go <br/>
see the tide pools.  We didn&#39;t go see &quot;tide pools&quot; however, we went <br/>
to go see Patrick, and maybe a Squidward if we were lucky or maybe a <br/>
Sponge Bob.  We saw lots of Patricks and Mr Krabs.  We weren&#39;t <br/>
planning on seeing Mr Krabs, but we did and that was cool, but we <br/>
didn&#39;t see his daughter, she&#39;d be pretty far out at sea.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Sponge Bob stuff just added to more animal stuff, like the <br/>
vicious raccoons at the camp ground and the random bear hide at the <br/>
beach house that was smiling, yet really freaked us all out, which <br/>
led us to dog fights and dog behavior and how people contribute to it <br/>
in odd ways.<br/>
<br/>
We have been playing 20 questions lately as well, which always leads <br/>
to the questions Person?, Place?, Or Thing?, then Animal?, <br/>
Vegetable?, Or Mineral?, which leads to wether you can call a Person <br/>
an Animal and some of us say you can and some of us say you can&#39;t and <br/>
it goes back to theoretical questions and such, which has on occasion <br/>
related back to Sponge Bob.  (Margaux likes to ask if it&#39;s a piece of <br/>
toast, I have no idea, but she likes to ask that question in 20 <br/>
questions)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570790696">Wow...I sat down to write about a cool series of connections we had <br/>
this evening and I find this thread...so there&#39;s a connection!<br/>
<br/>
Nicky (my 8 yo) and I were reading through a rather randomly chosen <br/>
stack of library picture books.  We were enchanted (entranced, <br/>
mesmerized!) by &quot;Magic Beach,&quot; which I&#39;d picked up because it&#39;s by <br/>
Crockett Johnson of Harold and the Purple Crayon fame.  When we <br/>
finished Magic Beach (earlier published as Castles in the Sand), <br/>
Nicky started playing his DS, so I read the forward to Magic Beach, <br/>
which was by Maurice Sendak and he wrote about how he practically <br/>
lived with Crockett Johnson and his wife, Ruth Krauss and what a big <br/>
influence the couple had been on him.  (You can really see it when <br/>
you look at their books with that in mind.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, Ruth Kraus wrote &quot;A Hole is to Dig,&quot;  which I had as a young <br/>
kid and loved. (&quot;Mud is to jump in and slide in and yell <br/>
doodleedoodleedoo&quot;  &quot;&quot;Oo!  A rock is when you trip on it you should <br/>
have watched where you ar going&quot;  &quot;A floor is so you don&#39;t fall in <br/>
the hole your house is in.&quot;)  Maurice Sendak illustrated it.   I <br/>
mentioned this to Nicky  but didn&#39;t go looking for the book.<br/>
<br/>
But then I read the afterward to Magic Beach and learned that <br/>
Crockett Johnson played with the legend of the fisher king in Magic <br/>
Beach.  I wasn&#39;t sure I knew the legend so I googled it and wound up <br/>
on Wikipedia.  I love Wikipedia cause I always wind up far afield of <br/>
where I start.  I learned that the fisher king story is part of the <br/>
King Arthur legends (and probably Celtic myths as well).  Nicky and i <br/>
had recently been reading some of those and researching them a little <br/>
because we&#39;d been wondering how much of Monty Python and the Holy <br/>
Grail was Monty Python and how much was from the original Arthurian <br/>
legends.  So I told Nicky about where the fisher king came from.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about adding the Crocket Johnson book to the Wikipedia <br/>
list of modern versions of the fisher king and I googled Crockett <br/>
Johnson and discovered that he had  done a comic strip called <br/>
Barnaby, which was popular during WWII.  When Eric, my husband came <br/>
home, I told him all this because I had a feeling...well, turns out <br/>
Eric&#39;s dad was a big Barnaby fan, had all the books, and Eric read <br/>
them as a kid and still remembers some.  So we&#39;re gonna check those <br/>
out (which might go well with watching the Ken Burns WWII documentary <br/>
coming up).<br/>
<br/>
I also learned when reading about the fisher king that the wasteland <br/>
that the fisher king&#39;s kingdom had become was the basis of the name <br/>
and some of the themes in the T.S. Elliot poem.  I mentioned that to <br/>
Nicky and my husband and Nicky wanted me to read it to him.  I was <br/>
not up for that at 11:30 last night and was doubtful it would appeal <br/>
so I discouraged that but I think I will pull it out and read a <br/>
little to him if he still wants to.  (I remember struggling with that <br/>
poem in college...yikes...better be careful not to pass on poetry-phobia!)<br/>
<br/>
Then Nicky wanted to read Harold and the Purple Crayon, so I went to <br/>
pull that out....and what was next to it on the shelf?  Ruth Krauss&#39; <br/>
A Hole is to Dig, which I&#39;d never shared with my kids!  So I did and <br/>
that was all very fun.  But then I got up to get ready for bed and I <br/>
was going to put the library books back on the shelf and noticed the <br/>
first book we read, which was &quot;Bears&quot; which I hadn&#39;t noticed was <br/>
by....Ruth Krauss and illustrated by Maurice Sendak!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209483739">Hannah (15) and I started watching Trading Spaces a couple years ago<br/>
together...a whole lot. We loved that show.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t so much anymore, but this is what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, we started to pick up little tips here and there about color,<br/>
texture, materials, planning, furniture, etc. from watching different<br/>
designers and people redo room after room after room. There was so much<br/>
diversity and creativity every time...we picked something up from each show.<br/>
Neither of us had any interior decorating experience. In fact, it&#39;s kind of<br/>
hard for me to envision physical space...just don&#39;t know how to put<br/>
something like a cool room together in my mind. I have to try things out and<br/>
see them to know if I like them. Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
After about 6 months, Hannah decided to do over her room. First, she<br/>
culminated. Thought of different ideas, colors, angles, furniture. Then she<br/>
went online and found a website that let you try different color<br/>
combinations on walls, furniture and floor. At first she wanted to do big<br/>
squares of alternating bright pink and black. When we started to pencil out<br/>
the squares, she decided it was too much work (because after the penciling<br/>
comes the taping, then the painting of one color, then after drying the<br/>
re-taping, then the painting of another color) and so she chose a two-tone<br/>
wall look using green and rust colors. It was pretty sophisticated and had a<br/>
dramatic look when we were done. All of her siblings at one time or another<br/>
were in her room painting or taping, never asked, just automatically came in<br/>
to help. It was exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Then we had a room change. For numerous reasons Andrew (18) moved into that<br/>
room, and Hannah was going to move into another room. By this time, she<br/>
wasn&#39;t so keen on the former design and decided to go with another idea. My<br/>
mom offered to pay for Hannah to put a new floor in that room. So Hannah<br/>
chose two tones of blue, one for walls and one for borders and baseboards<br/>
and outlets and doors, then purchased a white quilt for her bed with a whole<br/>
slew of different sizes and shapes of purple pillows for her bed. She put in<br/>
a wood floor (well, those snap-in wood-like floors) and viola! She has a<br/>
room of her dreams. She even found a brass leaf filled chandelier at at<br/>
Lowe&#39;s for 75% off. She used some of her money to pay for things and we<br/>
contributed. We love yard sales and Goodwill, and were able to get some<br/>
great things for little money.<br/>
<br/>
Hannah did a ton of measuring, color research, discussion with professionals<br/>
(mostly at Lowe&#39;s), not to mention the down and dirty work of getting it all<br/>
done. We did have the floor installed but other than that, she just worked<br/>
away at it, and again, people came in to help.<br/>
<br/>
Once her room was done, everyone started hanging out in there. It was a<br/>
beautiful, crisp room with cool and calming blues and purples. It just felt<br/>
good to be in there. Cameron (13) decided he wanted to redo his room. Only<br/>
his idea was quite different. He wanted everything taken out of his room,<br/>
the walls painted bright green and grass put in for flooring. We hit a dead<br/>
end with real grass (though we certainly researched what it would take [sun<br/>
lamps, drainage for water, etc]) and that steered us toward artificial<br/>
grass, which sparked a whole lot of research. We learned about 90 count<br/>
versus 60 count, the types of materials used, and how to get the softest<br/>
feel and the longest grass. Soon, Cam had a green-walled room with lush soft<br/>
grass for flooring. He wanted nothing put back in the room. So his room is<br/>
empty except for many big pillows, a two person soft big bean bag (foam)<br/>
chair, and his mattress on the floor. Everything else that was in his room<br/>
is in our front room, waiting for a yard sale.<br/>
<br/>
Now everyone hangs out in Cameron&#39;s Zen-like room. Max&#39;s (17) jazz/funk/rock<br/>
band often goes in there to rehearse or hang out. Cam loves that. He loves<br/>
that people like to come hang out in this creation he made from his vision.<br/>
<br/>
So connections upon connections upon connections. Life is just such a joy.<br/>
<br/>
