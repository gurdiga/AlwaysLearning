<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684943122">I did it! I posted a photo of Tamzin in full leopard<br/>
mode. It was so easy. I don&#39;t know why I get so phobic<br/>
about doing stuff on the web. It&#39;s never as difficult<br/>
as I think it&#39;s going to be. The only recent photo of<br/>
me is one where my face is painted like a tiger, by<br/>
Tamzin. I&#39;ll wait until I have one to post that shows<br/>
what I actually look like! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
