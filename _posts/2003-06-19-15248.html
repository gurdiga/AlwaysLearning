<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847935863">I wrote about Lexie&#39;s writing tablet she got today.  I just noticed what <br/>
she wrote on the front.  It has printed on it Name:  Teacher:  School: <br/>
 With space after each word for the student to write.  Lexie wrote Name: <br/>
 Lexie.  Teacher:  Mommy  School  World.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
and then she drew a great big heart next to it.<br/>
