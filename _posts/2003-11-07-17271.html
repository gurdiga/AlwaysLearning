<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134603703">I know we all know this - but I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of Holly&#39;s party, taking care of her Mom, and all the rest of <br/>
what she was doing last week, Sandra read the rough of my book, and gave some <br/>
some wonderful comments to use on the back of the cover for the blurb.<br/>
<br/>
What did she write you might ask?<br/>
<br/>
This book has something others miss:  the changes that take place in a parent <br/>
who lives consciously and mindfully with children.  Natural learning is quite <br/>
different from &quot;school at home,&quot; and can be hard to explain or imagine.   It <br/>
comes not from &quot;what to do&quot; stories, but from considerations of how to live.  <br/>
Not all homeschoolers have models and mentors, but this book can be the next <br/>
best thing.  Not only are the Coltens&#39; lives shared, but other homeschooling <br/>
families have offered glimpses of their own herein as well.  Many questions are <br/>
answered.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, she took the time to send me the corrections she saw that <br/>
needed to be made.  She not only has a sharp wit, but a sharp eye!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to publicly thank her.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thank you, Connie!<br/>
<br/>
I just realized that I missed your chat on Monday.  I printed out the <br/>
announcement, but ended up being at my mom&#39;s that morning and at a movie with kids <br/>
and a guest that afternoon, and the week just rolled crazily by.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the nice note.<br/>
<br/>
