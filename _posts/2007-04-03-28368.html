<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761873535">Since I&#39;ve been paying closer attention to the unschooling lists again <br/>
(I&#39;ve been dealing with illness in the family for the past couple of <br/>
years), I&#39;ve noticed there are several more specialized lists (parents <br/>
of younger children, gamers, etc.) Does anyone know of one for parents <br/>
of unschooling teens?<br/>

No, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to have one.  Already,  <br/>
splitting things out has created some disadvantages.  Most people  <br/>
with a teen have a younger child too.  Most people with a toddler  <br/>
could use &quot;reading ahead&quot; to see what to expect or where they&#39;re going.<br/>

There are some things collected from other topics and writings, and  <br/>
you can talk about teens here or at Unschooling Discussion.<br/>

haven&#39;t seen it on the list. <br/>
