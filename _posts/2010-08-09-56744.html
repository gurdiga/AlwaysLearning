<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493767528">I pulled this exchange from the âhusband not on unschooling trainâ thread.  Sandraâs responses to the original poster (OP) really struck a chord with me and Iâve been thinking it over for the past few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
***************************<br/>
<br/>
OP: Apparently Year 1 was not very impressive. To him anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra: Apparently not. Perhaps you should have made it very impressive. Perhaps you&#39;re getting another chance, and you should figure out how to make an impressive unschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone should. I think you should&#39;ve done that last year.<br/>
<br/>
OP: I also feel this pressure to make unschooling look like the best thing EVER, not just to me and Damon, but somehow so Geoff and his mom can see it too.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra: Uh.... Yes. I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t feel some of that pressure from this group. I&#39;m sorry when your husband said (...and I&#39;m trusting your account and hoping you weren&#39;t just pretending...) &quot;he was fine with Damon staying home with me (mom) as long as he was learning something&quot; that it didn&#39;t strike you as a little pressure to make unschooling look good!!<br/>
<br/>
****************************<br/>
<br/>
I have a four-year-old daughter, a two-year-old son, and a baby due in March.  Many of my daughterâs friends are starting preschool or kindergarten this fall.  My husband and I have already agreed not to send her to preschool.  I have the feeling that the primary reason my husband agreed to this is because preschool is not free in our school district, and we have a very tight budget.  I have a feeling the discussion will go much differently next year when we are talking about sending her to kindergarten, which *is* free.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I read the above exchange with Sandra, I have begun to feel this pressure to make our next year of unschooling look really great.  I know that technically we arenât unschooling because she is not actually school age, but it certainly feels that way to me since many of her friends are going to be in school.  I feel like I have to show everyone what unschooling will look like and how great it is during this next year because Iâm not sure Iâll have the chance if she goes to kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
I am also feeling pressure from family members.  I have been diffusing questions about what weâre going to do for kindergarten by saying things like, âwe arenât deciding anything just yet, and weâll see where we are when the time comes to decideâ but I feel like my time is running out on these kinds of responses.  My family doesnât have a positive view of home schooling in general.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, my daughter has been talking about kindergarten and when she will get to go.  Iâm almost certain my mother-in-law and possibly sister-in-law (who is an elementary school teacher) have been talking about kindergarten with her when Iâm not around.  I donât want to prevent my daughter from going to kindergarten if thatâs what she really wants to do, but I also have a fear that she only wants to go because of the rosy picture others are painting of it for her.  Iâm pretty sure she thinks that kindergarten is where you go to play with your friends.  So I guess I also feel pressure to make unschooling/being at home really great for my daughter, so that she doesnât *want* to go away to kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like is suggestions and advice on how to make unschooling look impressive in our house over the next year.  I stay home with the kids full time, and I know how amazing they are and how much they are learning all the time.  I just need other people to be able to see that.  I also think I could do a better job of providing more new, interesting, stimulating things for them to do more regularly instead of falling into our usual activities.  I guess Iâm feeling a little guilty lately over how much my kids have been playing on their own or watching movies or being on the computer because I havenât been feeling well the past couple of weeks.  Iâm also worried about what will happen when the baby comes, because a newborn will take up a whole lot of my time and attention and Iâm afraid that will make it seem like my other kids arenât in an impressive unschooling environment.  Iâd like to be more proactive, and have some kind of general plan of things we can do or some vague kind of âcurriculumâ to appease well-meaning relatives, and even a well-meaning dad possibly.<br/>
<br/>
What I want to avoid is being in a situation like the original poster may have, where I have a strain on my marriage and a big disagreement over unschooling and a struggle with family members and maybe even my own daughter about whether or not she should go to kindergarten.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835122251">I don&#39;t think anyone else can tell you how to make an impressive unschooling <br/>
environment.  It depends on what your dd likes best.  I think in general you <br/>
know you&#39;ve done well when nothing about Kindergarten is impressive to her <br/>
anymore.  She should have whatever is most appealing about school at home.  If <br/>
it is art, have a fantastic art collection at home.  If she like to get together <br/>
with friends, set up lots of outings.<br/>
<br/>
My boys love Legos, TV, wii, and the trampoline.  We have all of this at home.  <br/>
There is no where they would rather be than with all the things they love.  We <br/>
mix in other things they like and try to provide opportunities to check out new <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for showing your husband, take pictures and set up a blog or something <br/>
similar.  Point out what she would be missing at school.  Relate the horror <br/>
stories you hear about school.  Find articles about the value of play.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think being proactive is a good plan.  At the preschool level their is a lot <br/>
of pro-school media.  We had to work hard to avoid it as we always planned to <br/>
homeschool.  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t want to leave the impression with anyone that I think it&#39;s  <br/>
only until the husband is brought onboard that moms should really try  <br/>
to make unschooling rich and impressive.  That should go on as long as  <br/>
there are children.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had quiet seasons and down seasons, sure, but 180 days a week  <br/>
should be full, good days!  Have 185 days off if you want (if you can,  <br/>
after it gets going well, and when it&#39;s going REALLY well, even one  <br/>
day a year off won&#39;t work.<br/>

<br/>
Parents, and eventually BOTH parents, need to come to see what natural  <br/>
learning looks like.  It does  not look like school.<br/>

-=-Ever since I read the above exchange with Sandra, I have begun to  <br/>

great. I know that technically we aren�t unschooling because she is  <br/>

many of her friends are going to be in school-=-<br/>
<br/>
More and more U.S. states require kindergarten now, and when and where  <br/>
free public schooling starts in ANY jurisdiction and a parent opts  <br/>
out, I think that&#39;s time to start saying &quot;we&#39;re unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even where enrollment isn&#39;t mandated until the age of 7, if most kids  <br/>
are in at 5 the parent is consciously doing something other than what  <br/>
the community and government expect them to do with their child each  <br/>
schoolday morning.<br/>
<br/>
But a four year old and pre-school, I don&#39;t think anything more than  <br/>
her being calm and happy and not crying about separations would be  <br/>
required if the relatives are at all thoughtful and compassionate  <br/>
about mental health.   Then again, many people don&#39;t think a bit about  <br/>
the mental health of children, until they&#39;re cutting themselves or  <br/>
using drugs or being suicidal.   Anything short of that is seen as  <br/>
normal.  :-/  And &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; are, unfortunately,  <br/>
considered to be equal, when most people look at kids, even if what is  <br/>
actually the norm is stressed, afraid and unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I stay home with the kids full time-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, even though you&#39;ll have an infant, you can start thinking of it  <br/>
as staying with the kids full time in the world.  Don&#39;t aim for  <br/>
&quot;home.&quot;  Get them out and going.  Infants in slings or carriers can go  <br/>
out as easily as staying home, and they might prefer it!  More things  <br/>
for them to see, touch, hear.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a blog yet, maybe start one with photos of places,  <br/>
or scans of tickets or programs (or just link to the websites of the  <br/>
places you&#39;ve been, and upload an image from there with a link back to  <br/>
it; they wouldn&#39;t mind that kind of use of their art, definitely!)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, when one is exhausted, the dishes aren&#39;t done, laundry is  <br/>
piling up, one kid&#39;s crying and one is not in evidence, to say at that  <br/>
point what good things have happened in the past week.    When Kirby  <br/>
was five and Marty was two and Holly was born, that was an exhausting  <br/>
time.  But we had other families trading play time (&quot;babysitting co- <br/>
op&quot; for points, but often it was just playdates for points), and so I  <br/>
could arrange time with just the baby, and I could easily get other  <br/>
kids over to play with mine, which helped.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your husband can get to a conference, do that.  It could  <br/>
make the biggest difference!   There are things he might listen to  <br/>
(depending how he is about such things) linked here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58199208">You get to see how impressive it all I&#39;d because you are there... Maybe the answer is not to change what you&#39;re doing (though no harm in doing extra fun stuff) but to keep a cool record so that others can appreciate your normal routine. <br/>
<br/>
A digital camera and a blog might let people see what wonderful things you&#39;re doing.  I know that my own days can seem uneventful till I look back at the photos and realise we&#39;ve done loads.<br/>

Depending on the situation, anything after age 3.5 years could be considered conscious unschooling, because (unfortunately0 it seems like public schools are pushing to have children earlier and earlier. There are school districts that have a preschool program in their elementary schools (some have taxpayer-funded programs that are &quot;free&quot; to attend). We&#39;ve gotten flack from family for not sending our children to preschool and even had cashiers ask why our kids weren&#39;t in preschool. <br/>

<br/>
Joining them where they are will gives you a chance to take pictures for a blog or scrapbook, it lets you see what they&#39;re doing so you can offer more things they like, plust to play with them. That&#39;s a win all the way around. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes little things like magazine subscriptions can be a boon in term of helping moms and kids change gears when things get stale around the house. Kid-magazines like Ladybug or National Geographic Kids can spark ideas for new fun, new trips, even new foods to try - And subscriptions make great things for extended family to &quot;give&quot;. Asking for things like that helps grandparents feel involved and connected, which can help them get over the &quot;no school&quot; hurdle and provide them with Other things to talk and ask about. If grandparents are willing to chip in a little more, ask for memberships to children&#39;s museums or zoos - whatever&#39;s in your area that you&#39;d love to do. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so. Many places where I could have chosen to live, there&#39;s a<br/>
Head Start kindergarten program starting kids at school at 4 years of<br/>
age. It&#39;s supposed to give qualifying kids an extra hand up. It isn&#39;t<br/>
free for all kids though, just for people who can&#39;t afford<br/>
kindergarten. So if your family is in that qualifying income bracket,<br/>
it looks a lot like a requirement, even when it isn&#39;t an official one.<br/>
 And if you&#39;re obviously NOT in that income bracket and you can afford<br/>
to pay for kindergarten, the option not to send a child to<br/>
kindergarten seems marginal and pro-school people are gonna ask why<br/>
parents are not allowing their kids to go to kindergarten if they can<br/>
afford it. The big question parents get is why would a parent NOT want<br/>
to??<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t free to all and may never be but lots of people see education<br/>
(in other words-- school) as a universal right. The pressure to send<br/>
kids to school starts very early in the US with a school system not<br/>
doing well internationally and the onus to improve not falling<br/>
squarely on the system alone but also on children to attend school<br/>
more and earlier.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s very good reason for parents to understand unschooling as early<br/>
in the game as possible and do it well.<br/>
<br/>
Four is still very young, a baby to me, and it wasn&#39;t until just<br/>
recently that Karl turned 7 and became interested in specific bits of<br/>
info to talk about. Before that, it was lots of storytelling and<br/>
playacting and very little conscious gathering of info or talking<br/>
about it. Some but not much. And there&#39;s still a lot of unconsciously<br/>
being awash in a sea of ideas. When Karl was 3 and 4, he loved playing<br/>
Reader Rabbit and I played together with him. Lots of times he skipped<br/>
things he didn&#39;t know and sometimes he asked me to answer parts for<br/>
him. I know that he was picking up ideas from what we did. We played<br/>
Starfall together and it was fun to click the words and so they could<br/>
read themselves and sometimes sing about themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing with watching old Sesame Street episodes on Youtube where<br/>
the actors name the letters hanging in midair and also have side<br/>
conversations about all kinds of other things that I would not<br/>
necessarily call academic. For instance, there was a breastfeeding<br/>
skit and Karl could easily relate to that as a matter of course, and<br/>
was what I would call confirmation of what he had experienced himself<br/>
firsthand. For another kid, who either doesn&#39;t remember breastfeeding<br/>
or who wasn&#39;t breastfed, that skit could be new, in other words, where<br/>
information to learn from is provided.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to show and tell if the child/ren want to watch and<br/>
listen. Do give information and learning will go on. Karl and I were<br/>
in a small local little restaurant and in the past he has gone up to<br/>
the register with the bill and money to pay for the meal. Instead of<br/>
asking him in words, I drew on a napkin a stick figure story of him<br/>
paying for the meal. He was curious to see what would come next,<br/>
watched as I drew, said &quot;Oh ok!&quot; and then I gave him the money/bill<br/>
and away he went. Later, he wanted me to draw another story with him<br/>
for showing his dad. I also have a note program in my PDA and Karl<br/>
dictates stories sometimes as we&#39;re settling in to sleep. There&#39;s all<br/>
kinds of ways to keep the learning flowing and keep it mixed up and<br/>
fun and never look to curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
Educational goals in the school system carry over from year to year,<br/>
repeating for reinforcement of info and gradually adding to repeated<br/>
material from previous grades.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, a huge advantage is lots of information that&#39;s very<br/>
comprehensive without resorting to forced repetition of concepts so<br/>
that a child can leisurely put ideas into the place it needs to go for<br/>
him/her. The objective for unschooling is simply to keep the learning<br/>
flowing.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh I hope there aren&#39;t many people who think unschooling is anti-learning.<br/>

So we have been constantly questioned about our choices since our boys each reached 3. Folk just didn&#39;t get why we were turning down this free opportunity and depriving our boys of a good early start. <br/>
<br/>
We get lots of enquiries on our local home education forum from parents who are having to make a decision whether or not to do what the community and government expects of them in respect of their toddlers. :(<br/>
