&lt;&lt; I may also head to one of the little Indian shops here that do Ayurverdic<br/>
medicines (although I draw the line at the urinology) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This looked to me (I was glancing) like &quot;urinography,&quot; and so I must tell you <br/>
the story of my now-deceased friend Stan.  After a bunch of us camped in the <br/>
same spot every year for many years, we moved to a bigger camping site.  Stan <br/>
balked BIGtime and did NOT ever want to go back.  He almost didn&#39;t go that <br/>
one time. <br/>
<br/>
When I questioned him about it he said it was too far East, and if he pissed <br/>
there it would run into the Mississippi, not the Rio Grande.<br/>
<br/>
For Stan, this seemed important.<br/>
<br/>
So in frustration I told him I was pretty sure no runoff from there could go <br/>
into the Mississippi, and if I confirmed that would he go camp?<br/>
<br/>
Reluctantly he agree.<br/>
<br/>
Keith, my husband, is Mr. Geography Guy--loves maps, loves trivia, loves it <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Pecos,&quot; said Keith.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Pecos,&quot; I told Stan, &quot;which rejoins the Rio Grande.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay, then...&quot;  and he went camping.<br/>
