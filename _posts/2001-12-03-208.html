&gt; being &quot;in tune&quot; (there&#39;s that music analogy again) with the universe -- it is<br/>
&gt; the &quot;brain&quot; having an AHA moment, not the heart. It is a little or big burst<br/>
&gt; of understanding about how things work in our world and having either a<br/>
&gt; flashing moment or a slow dawning of understanding about how the universe<br/>
&gt; works in patterns that repeat and make sense at many many different levels.<br/>
&gt; This is the level at which it feels spiritual to me. It is that level of<br/>
&gt; &quot;connectedness&quot; and patterns and things working in a way that makes some kind<br/>
&gt; of ultimate sense and that it is something we can strive to understand while<br/>
&gt; knowing we can never fully understand. This is somehow related (and I&#39;m sorry<br/>
&gt; that I can&#39;t express this more articulately) to my own belief that our<br/>
&gt; purpose in this life is to strive to know God - who is unknowable (and who is<br/>
&gt; not limited to the simple anthropomorphic concept of a deity that most<br/>
&gt; religions teach). So - striving to comprehend something that uncovers or<br/>
&gt; opens my eyes to patterns in the universe seems part of that spiritual<br/>
&gt; purpose.  But - so is EVERYTHING else that involves learning; all things that<br/>
&gt; give us glimpses into human nature or into the nature of the universe. I<br/>
&gt; believe that we&#39;re hardwired with in inherent inner need to learn things to<br/>
&gt; get those peak moment flashes or slow dawnings of understanding and that is<br/>
&gt; why unschooling &quot;works.&quot;<br/>
