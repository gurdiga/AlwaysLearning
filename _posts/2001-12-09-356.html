<div id="ygrps-yiv-238931566">KPGrew suggests extending bedtime or a reward at the end of the week.<br/>
<br/>
Lite2yu responds:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I dont think this would work for us. . .because we dont set arbitrary <br/>
&gt; bedtimes or things like that. Our children are free to choose bedtimes, <br/>
&gt; movies, dinners, etc. And this sets up this external reward system that is <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; contrary to unschooling I think. . . I dont know. . . maybe others have <br/>
&gt; different insights on it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suggested bedtime merely because it seems that every parent I know has a <br/>
set bedtime for their children that *could* be negotiated a wee bit.<br/>
<br/>
Hee hee.  Maybe I&#39;m becoming an unschooler & didn&#39;t know it. :O  My kids do <br/>
not have set bedtimes, either, but I do still use some occasional rewards.  I <br/>
began homeschooling four years ago in a very strict &quot;school-like&quot; manner.   I <br/>
thought they NEEDED to learn this, this, & this on a schedule and it just <br/>
wasn&#39;t working. The next year, I purchased an entire curriculum and we used <br/>
it, but followed it more as a guideline. Some things in the curriculum stayed <br/>
- some things went.  Last year, I purchased *most* of the curriculum; this <br/>
year, I didn&#39;t purchase a curriculum at all. LOL.  We mixed & matched <br/>
materials and have been using the library.  In my experience, they&#39;ve been <br/>
learning so much more since I&#39;ve relaxed and learning has been fun. :)<br/>
<br/>
In a roundabout way, this email group was recommended to me.  Is everyone <br/>
here unschooling?<br/>

Stick around this crowd and you&#39;ll know (sort of) some families without set <br/>
bedtimes.  That will skew your curve some.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t reward my kids with late nights or food, because they can already <br/>
have all of that they want.  They end up self motivated, or maybe behaving to <br/>
avoid a &quot;discussion&quot; with me about why they did whatever (dumbass) thing they <br/>
did.  <br/>
<br/>
Having broken nearly all the rules, I now have (to the dismay of those who <br/>
were dying to say &quot;I told you so&quot;) some really well behaved, thoughtful, <br/>
sociable kids.   It was a gamble, but it worked out better than I imagined it <br/>
could have.<br/>

when they were little. When they got tired they&#39;d fall asleep and <br/>
we&#39;d pack them off... which got harder and harder as they grew into <br/>
teenagers - we finally resorted to just tossing a blanket over them <br/>
wherever they finally fell... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. I haven&#39;t seen any of my kids for a couple of weeks now. <br/>
But I hear reports... People are always telling me what good, kind, <br/>
smart, sociable kids we have. It was indeed a gamble to raise them as <br/>
we did (radical underground unschooling with no holds barred), but <br/>
probably less so for us because I was raised that way myself - as <br/>
much as possible 30+ years ago. Mom and Dad never made us kids go to <br/>
school much, and since we travelled frequently, skipping school was <br/>
more the norm than attending, even when we were enrolled. I have a <br/>
report card from 5th grade that notes 41 days attended, 43 absent for <br/>
the time we were at that school. And we weren&#39;t hitting the books <br/>
when we weren&#39;t in school - more often than not we were out goofing <br/>
around the countryside sightseeing or just lounging around watching <br/>
sitcoms and old movies on TV. Picnics were a high priority item, and <br/>
going camping was plenty of reason to skip a few schooldays...<br/>
<br/>
I still hug my folks once in a while and thank them for raising me <br/>
the way they did. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

When people used to ask us &quot;What time does Kirby go to bed?&quot; <br/>
(or Marty, or the youngest-of-record), we took to saying &quot;About half an hour <br/>
after he falls asleep.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Holly has talked about how used to waking up in bed she was, and how few <br/>
times she remembered going to sleep in the bed as a baby--but slept in the <br/>
car, in someone&#39;s lap, on the couch, on a blanket under the table where <br/>
people were doing stuff, on a pile of cloaks at an SCA event.  She thought it <br/>
was totally normal to fall asleep one place and wake up somewhere else, and <br/>
for her it was.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, we let them deal with it. The first crash was in Alaska a <br/>
couple of years ago. Chris had an older station wagon, nothing fancy. <br/>
Jody borrowed it to go blueberry picking up in the mountains, lost <br/>
the brakes on a curve and almost took the car off a several-hundred <br/>
foot cliff. She managed to sideswipe it into a bank and get it <br/>
stopped, but totalled the car in the process. When we went back up to <br/>
get the car and I saw the tracks showing how she&#39;d come within 10&#39; of <br/>
going over I just sat down in the middle of the road and cried, <br/>
hugging her. Chris didn&#39;t say much that time.<br/>
<br/>
Next time it was his pride and joy - a &#39;66 Mustang. She ran a stop <br/>
sign and smacked into an Oldsmobile. Nobody got hurt but the Mustang <br/>
was totalled. Christopher was just happy that Jody and his buddy who <br/>
were riding with her weren&#39;t hurt. His only comment that time was <br/>
&quot;When she wrecks them she sure does a thorough job...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(This is a tall, mostly quiet kid, with a very dry sense of humor...)<br/>
<br/>
Last summer she was driving his Toyota 4-Runner and backed into a <br/>
lightpost, significantly damaging the read end (broke the rear <br/>
window). When Chris found out about this relatively minor incident <br/>
(relative to the two totallings) he made up for lost time, and really <br/>
took her to task about driving responsibly, making good on one&#39;s <br/>
debts (she hadn&#39;t paid him much on the other two, mostly &#39;cuz she <br/>
hasn&#39;t worked), and various other well-founded grievances. And told <br/>
her it would be a cold day in hell before she drove another one of <br/>
his cars.<br/>
<br/>
He was good for his word on that last score. Last August the two of <br/>
them drove his &#39;68 Mustang to Alaska and he never let her behind the <br/>
wheel once on the entire 2,800 mile trip.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What do you think allowed that? Did you stay out of<br/>
&gt;the discussion?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Just like I&#39;d stay out of the discussion if it involved two <br/>
friends of mine. It was their concern, not mine. We raised these kids <br/>
to deal with each other, and not through us as mediators, except when <br/>
absolutely necessary. They&#39;ve all learned to trust and respect each <br/>
other, and have all said they&#39;re each others&#39; best friends many <br/>
times. It probably helps that we&#39;ve always done a lot together as a <br/>
family, and the kids still go sailing, riding, partying, snowboarding <br/>
and travelling together. Last fall the three youngest (Chris and Jody <br/>
and the youngest, Michael, 15) organized a backpacking trip into a <br/>
huge wilderness area in the Cascade Mountains. They invited a dozen <br/>
friends and the group spent 8 days living on pancakes and fish and <br/>
berries and each others&#39; good company. It was one of the highlights <br/>
of everyone&#39;s year!<br/>

I wish my dd would get tired! Okay, she gets tired,<br/>
she just won&#39;t admit she&#39;s tired until her eyes are<br/>
about to close &lt;vbg&gt;. She was up until 3am last night<br/>
and 1am tonight. I have to say, sometimes (when I know<br/>
we&#39;ve got an am commitment) I &#39;talk her into&#39; going to<br/>
bed. She has always been the last one to &#39;fall&#39;, even<br/>
when she was really small (she&#39;s only 7 now). <br/>
