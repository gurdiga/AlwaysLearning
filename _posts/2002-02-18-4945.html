&lt;&lt;    There are ways to make your farolitos more<br/>
<br/>
decorative. Stencil Christmas patterns onto<br/>
<br/>
   the front of your bags, and using an<br/>
<br/>
ex-acto knife, cut out the patterns, then<br/>
<br/>
tape colored<br/>
<br/>
   crepe paper inside the bags. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll think you&#39;re a yankee.  I&#39;ve never seen a native do that, but I&#39;ve <br/>
seen things like that sold in magazines for elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The bags get filled with sand or dirt about 2-3&quot; deep, so rocks wouldn&#39;t <br/>
help.  The dirt weights the bags, keeps their shape (folding down the top is <br/>
crucial to keep them from catching fire) and keeps hot wax from getting on <br/>
the wall/sidewalk/ground.  <br/>
<br/>
Since both luminaria and farolito mean &quot;little fiery light-thing,&quot; it&#39;s not <br/>
worth arguing about.  If I&#39;m talking to someone in Santa Fe or points north, <br/>
I say &quot;luminaria.&quot;  In Espanola, where I grew up, luminarias were a certain <br/>
kind of fire made a certain way.  They put one in front of every house in <br/>
Santa Clara pueblo (maybe other pueblos--that&#39;s the place my friends lived, <br/>
though, and that I could smoke from, from my house just by looking toward the <br/>
river).  They are small split cedar sticks, smaller than your forearm, maybe <br/>
eighteen inches to two feet long (the size used for kiva-style, corner <br/>
fireplaces, or for woodstoves).  You lay it in a square tower, two flat, two <br/>
across those the other way, two more, etc, about two feet high.  Stick some <br/>
kindling down in the middle and light it.   They light them just as it gets <br/>
dark on Christmas Eve. The smoke is glorious and great-smelling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen them lining streets, but I suppose if you drove through the <br/>
pueblo or one of the other old neighborhoods where each family will make one, <br/>
it would seem to line the street (one per house).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen it done in or around Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
From November through December, little cases of 15 hour votive candles are on <br/>
sale CHEAP just everywhere, here.  And paper lunch bags in big bundles.  <br/>
<br/>
I like to collect the used candle-ends (no matter how burned down), melt them <br/>
in a can, and dip kindling sticks into for starting fires easier in the <br/>
fireplace.  For a few years we had a lot of SCA occasions which created scrap <br/>
wax, but all my students have been promoted (knighthood for one of mine and <br/>
two of my husband&#39;s, Pelicans for three, and now that they&#39;re all &quot;grown&quot; in <br/>
the SCA, I&#39;ll be scavenging neighborhood luminarias (since I&#39;m in <br/>
Albuquerque) for scrap wax next year again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547574535">During Christmas season way up here in the northland people sometimes <br/>
line the driveways or walkways with luminarias. It&#39;s an incredibly <br/>
beautiful sight--the glow of candles in sparkling snow.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which (&lt;-----is that a colloquialism?), what a wimpy winter <br/>
we&#39;ve had. It&#39;s the middle of February and there&#39;s almost no snow on the <br/>
ground at all--there really hasn&#39;t been much to speak of for weeks and <br/>
weeks and nothing exciting is in the forecast. Sigh.<br/>
