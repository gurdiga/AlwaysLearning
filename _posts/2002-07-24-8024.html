<div id="ygrps-yiv-429338236"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;True. Supposed to be. But it isn&#39;t. The VAST majority<br/>
&gt;of college students are sort of sleepwalking &lt;G&gt; when<br/>
&gt;it comes to learning. What I mean is that they just<br/>
&gt;do not have any concept of anything beyond school and<br/>
&gt;their sociallife. To them the ENTIRE point of a class<br/>
&gt;is to take the tests, get the passing grades, and<br/>
&gt;graduate. There are very very few who could not JUMP<br/>
&gt;at the chance to skip a class if they could just get<br/>
&gt;credit. <br/>
&gt;-pam<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting Pam, that you use that terminology,<br/>
Sleepwalking.  It&#39;s exactly the term I would use, for<br/>
the same reasons.  But I would not stop at applying it<br/>
to those droning through institutionalized schooling. <br/>
My husband and I have talked about and developed a<br/>
theory about folks in general.  So many people are<br/>
sleepwalking through life, not truly aware of their<br/>
own feelings, motivations, dreams, passions, talents,<br/>
spirit.  They are blind and oblivious to the pulse of<br/>
life, and to their place within that flow.  They limit<br/>
themselves with artificial boundaries, don&#39;t truly<br/>
connect with other human beings, are defensive and<br/>
small minded in their little fortresses of &quot;reality&quot;<br/>
which they have painstakingly improsoned themselves<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
It is so sad to us to see people thus living; shallow,<br/>
empty, seeking, unsatisfied, yearning after material<br/>
goods as if that will fill the hole within them.  It<br/>
is particularly sad when it is so easy to wake up, to<br/>
blink your eyes and breath deeply and really become<br/>
aware of life and the world around you in more than a<br/>
superficial way.  Well, it seems like it should be<br/>
easy anyway, although I know many people have painful<br/>
and often unrecognized emotional reasons for not being<br/>
truly honest with themselves, or not wanting to look<br/>
too deeply at their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I consider Unschoolers to be, in general, a pretty<br/>
awake group of people, vivaciously partaking of and<br/>
participating in life, not accepting the status quo,<br/>
toeing the line, or blindly accepting anything.  Most<br/>
importantly, they have deep and full relationships and<br/>
unserstandings of their loved ones, living in mutual<br/>
respect and admiration of one another.  I wish I knew<br/>
more unschoolers in person.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;  So many people are<br/>

<br/>
Maybe they are aware of as much as there is.<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s it for them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is so sad to us to see people thus living; shallow,<br/>
empty, seeking, unsatisfied, yearning after material<br/>

<br/>
True that some people have emotional blockage.<br/>
But some don&#39;t.  Some just ARE shallow.  The hole within them, if there is <br/>
one, is easily filled with a nice entertainment center.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is so sad to us to see people thus living; shallow,<br/>
empty, seeking, unsatisfied&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth considering that there could be TONS of people who are not empty, <br/>
not seeking, and who ARE satisfied, but who are not deep, searching or <br/>
spiritual.<br/>
<br/>
The problem sometimes is that some of them don&#39;t realize there are others who <br/>
are deeper and broader than they are.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a gift, being dissatisfied with just a few little ideas and <br/>
comforts.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d think it would be pretty warm and cushy to really believe in a simple <br/>
religion, to love your bed even if it&#39;s not objectively a great bed, to be <br/>
happy with your food without the whole-body-and-spirit angst and fear about <br/>
where it came from and what&#39;s in it, to trust doctors without asking <br/>
questions, to just be content with what&#39;s on TV and to believe what&#39;s on the <br/>
news and to feel safe because there are policemen on duty.<br/>
<br/>
I want that life.<br/>
<br/>
But lobotomy is not yet an approved elective surgery.<br/>

there are different timetables for a child learning to read, I believe there <br/>

Without knowing that there is any other way perhaps. Without having had the <br/>
inclination or maybe just the personal circumstances to be able think more <br/>
deeply about things.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think you&#39;re right that we all have the capacity... some just don&#39;t<br/>
have the desire.  <br/>
They don&#39;t see the need for it.  My old Auntie thinks any kind of self<br/>
reflection or deep thinking or spiritual seeking is an indulgent waste of<br/>
precious time that could be spent working.   She&#39;s 85, still has the<br/>
capacity for anything and everything, but sees no point in &quot;personal<br/>
growth.&quot;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she has neither of Howard Gardner&#39;s &quot;personal <br/>
intelligences&quot;--interpersonal or intrapersonal.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the same way people with great mathematical and verbal intelligences <br/>
think that those without them are mentally deficient, not &quot;gifted,&quot; not <br/>
&quot;smart,&quot; that those who have tons of intrapersonal intelligence assume that <br/>
those without it pine for it.<br/>
<br/>
I wish everyone had more interpersonal intelligence, but some of my friends <br/>
wish I could play volleyball and swim too.  We&#39;re all so disappointed! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wish all my friends could sing harmonies by ear.  They don&#39;t.<br/>

Apparently NOT on of my intelligences.  (And not for lack of trying!)<br/>
<br/>
BUT... I can cross one eye and they can&#39;t, so neener.<br/>

Deb L, perhaps lacking other intelligences as well...</div>
