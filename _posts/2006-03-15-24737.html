<div id="ygrps-yiv-525224597"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; However, now, years later, I am crumbling under<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; responsibilities of being a single, working,<br/>
&gt; unschooling mom.  I am exhausted, my<br/>
&gt; health is tenuous, my finances nonexistent, and the<br/>
&gt; sparkle/hope is fading from my kids eyes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Speaking from much more experience in stress and<br/>
strain than I ever wanted to have: GET YOUR NEEDS MET!<br/>
do whatever it takes to take care of yourself. if you<br/>
find it difficult to motivate yourself to take care of<br/>
you, think of it this way: your children will take<br/>
care of themselves as they have seen you do. are you<br/>
modeling your best hopes for their adulthood? don&#39;t<br/>
use that to berate yourself further, though! use it to<br/>
guide you in seeking the help you need. it may be time<br/>
for school for a while, as a pp suggested, if that&#39;s<br/>
what you have to do. it may turn out to be the best<br/>
thing for your kids! parenting teaches us a lot about<br/>
humility, doesn&#39;t it? your children need you-- they<br/>
need you *healthy, relaxed, and sane.* they don&#39;t need<br/>
you 24/7 if it compromises your health and happiness.<br/>
I myself fell victim to the litany of shoulds, as in:<br/>
I should want to be with my son 24/7. I should be able<br/>
to put my needs on the shelf until he&#39;s older. I<br/>
should be able to make this work financially. I should<br/>
be able to handle these sacrifices. I denied myself<br/>
until I developed severe panic attacks. it turns out,<br/>
I have to go back to work, for financial reasons<br/>
(egads) but even more so to meet my own needs so that<br/>
I can bring my best self to my mothering. this may<br/>
result in my son having to attend a preschool or<br/>
daycare for a while. I thought I would never do that<br/>
but my son needs me at my best, and if that&#39;s what it<br/>
takes then I have to be flexible, and realistic about<br/>
my own limits. he was getting too much of me at my<br/>
worst before I admitted this. we&#39;re all human; as moms<br/>
it is easy to insist we are not! we want perfection<br/>
for our children, and we get ideas about what that<br/>
means, then we make ourselves sick trying to do the<br/>
impossible. be gentle with yourself, get support,<br/>
figure out what you can do differently.<br/>
<br/>
very best wishes for positive change,<br/>
