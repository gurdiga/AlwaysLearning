San Diego one of the cloudiest cities in the U.S.? Compared to WHAT?!! LOL<br/>
Dh lived in San Diego for three years, sun, sun, sun! I think it&#39;s a lot like <br/>
Pensacola actually, the clouds move off and it&#39;s fairly sunny most days.<br/>
If you like cloudy, try anywhere from Seattle,WA to Corvallis, OR. Stay <br/>
closer to the coast in the NW and you&#39;ll be fine. Eastern sides of those <br/>
states are very sunny and snow in the winter.<br/>
If you like winter weather, Fairbanks, AK can&#39;t be beat!! haha<br/>
And talk about an eclectic, interesting mix of people.<br/>
Anchorage is more rainy in the summer, milder winters...but still snow. And <br/>
you&#39;ve got the MOST incredible array of mountains surrounding you.<br/>
If I liked rain and winter weather, Anchorage, AK would be the place.<br/>
The scenery is unreal, and the people well traveled and interesting....lots <br/>
of outdoor enthusiasts.<br/>
It&#39;s more expensive to live, but the wages are awesome too. And you get <br/>
permanent fund money every year for every person in your family. Last year it <br/>
was $1800 per person, my sister&#39;s family collected for five people!!! Can you <br/>
imagine just being handed that amount for living in a state?<br/>
PLUS, hardly any taxes. Only property tax. No sales tax, no income <br/>
tax....it&#39;s pretty awesome that way.<br/>
And Fairbanks has the most incredible children&#39;s room in their library.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, who could never, ever live in AK again!!!</div>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I said, I think... onshore flow makes it cloudy every day, but<br/>
it burns off.  The &quot;Places Rated Catalog&quot; rate it as one of the cloudiest (I<br/>
can&#39;t remember the exact ranking), but it&#39;s using the city of San Diego<br/>
proper as it&#39;s source, and the city is right on the ocean.  La Jolla stays<br/>
cloudier than any other stretch of beach, because of the shape of its<br/>
coastline; we&#39;ll go there at 1 p.m. in August and it will still be cloudy,<br/>
while up and down the coast is already clear.  If you&#39;re not on the coast,<br/>
say, 6 miles or so inland, you&#39;ve got sun anytime from dawn to10 a.m. til<br/>
sundown nearly every day of the year :-)))<br/>
