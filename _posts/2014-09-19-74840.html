<div id="ygrps-yiv-704655178">Anonymous question—good one, not a hard one.<br/>
______________<br/>
<br/>
I attended the HSC conference this summer, thank you for all the time you spent with us. I would like to ask an anonymous question, to either the Facebook radical unschooling info group or Always Learning, I&#39;ll leave that up to you, if you don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
In the spirit of making our home more full of things my kids love, I mentioned to my husband I was planning to order a big jar of jelly beans from Amazon, because I noticed all three kids always eat them at the neighbors house. <br/>
<br/>
My husband became very distraught. He grew up in a home with lots of food restrictions, the &quot;only health food&quot; model I&#39;ve been letting go of myself, and has struggled with his weight his entire adult life. He said he felt unsupported in his own home as I have been bringing in and offering more foods to my kids, including candy. He said he is unable to regulate, and the way he has always handled that was to not have those things in his home. It was probably not helpful in the moment, but I did point out that that strategy had not been particularly successful in terms of weight loss in the 11 years that I have known him. <br/>
<br/>
I asked him if I could present this quandary to this community, how to be supportive of my husband while still providing abundance and variety for my kids. He&#39;s game for some good unschooling wisdom, as am I. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all you do.<br/>

It offers the option to not have to be negative about it. My husband doesn&#39;t really get that from any other source.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where the terminology of &quot;holding space&quot; comes from but why is it better than &quot;I can be positive and accepting of it&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-If a big jar of jellybeans makes someone in the house unhappy, don&#39;t get one. Especially if that person is your husband! There are SO many other options.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I liked Joyce&#39;s suggestions better.  I&#39;ve been really busy and not at home and  was surprised that more people didn&#39;t contribute ideas and experiences. <br/>
<br/>
If a person&#39;s upbringing crippled him to the point that a jar of jellybeans (large or small) can make him unhappy, how many years should a wife &quot;accept&quot; that before pointing out that his woundedness IS EVIDENCE that the family should NOT impose the same damage upon their own children?<br/>
<br/>
This man can learn to choose a jellybean, or to leave a jellybean, or to eat ten one day and discover that he doesn&#39;t want them as much as he thought he would.<br/>

This article might could be read aloud between the spouses slowly, thoughtfully.  Studied.  Read aloud and left to hang in the air.<br/>
<br/>
Catering to the damage of control and deprivation, when it involves depriving the children a family has chosen to unschool, is not a step toward better unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Compassion, yes.  Creating illusions and falsehoods, no.<br/>
<br/>
And seriously:  I hear this kind of phrasing and the hair stands up on my arms It&#39;s not English.  Whose sculpting of wordly utterance and imagining of thought is it?  <br/>
&quot;I can hold my own space of positivity and acceptance around it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Lisa, your writing is some of my favorite these days, so I&#39;m wondering why you lapsed in to woo-age jargon.<br/>
