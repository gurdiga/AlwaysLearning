<div id="ygrps-yiv-138447631">Maybe I&#39;m just blind because I know FL laws and not other states, but what <br/>
does having the kids in school have to do with child support?<br/>
Here, it is based on how many children you have and what the guy makes income <br/>
wise, that&#39;s all.<br/>
And if you&#39;ve been married 12 years or more, that is considered &quot;long term&quot; <br/>
and you automatically get alimony.<br/>
Now that is assuming the mother has been home with the children and he is the <br/>
main financial support....but it wouldn&#39;t change his child support payment <br/>
one iota if the mother got custody, which they usually do in this <br/>
conservative area.<br/>
One nice thing about being in a conservative region, the judges award custody <br/>
to the Mum 9 x out of 10, and the child support and alimony are fairly <br/>
generous.<br/>
I would have gotten over half of Marks income had we divorced, and them being <br/>
homeschooled or not wouldn&#39;t have affected it one bit.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164937710">When I divorced my husband of 27 years a few years back, my daughter refused <br/>
to spend the night at my house, and my youngest son was at both houses about <br/>
1/2 the nights.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the judge ruled that schooling has nothing to do with anything (this <br/>
was about time spent with parents - seems where they sleep is the main point) <br/>
since all kids school (my lawyer wrote this moving paper about my parenting <br/>
style, which NO ONE read), and after being a stay at home mom with a small <br/>
homebased business (re-usuable cloth nursing pads) I had to pay my husband <br/>
child support!!  At least the kids weren&#39;t required to go to school (OVER MY <br/>
DEAD BODY that would have been).  Life can be amazing sometimes.<br/>
