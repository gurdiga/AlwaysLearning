FOR sure those two ages will be well-represented! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>

in any activity, although some may be more age-appropriate than others.<br/>
<br/>
If she has any particular interests, send them to me---I&#39;m very open to<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Right now (---tentatively, as the contracts aren&#39;t all in!), we have 2<br/>
storytellers (one&#39;s a native American and makes all sorts of things with<br/>
kudzu!, the other&#39;s a Mother Goose freak), bead-working, legos, costume<br/>
closet, felting, many card/board games, puppeteers (marrionettes),<br/>
magicians,<br/>
scrapbooking, bookmaking, origami, drumming, ecology lab (she might bring<br/>
baby alligators!), a mime, and a leadership/cooperative organization.<br/>
<br/>
My six year old is trying to talk me into a space walk tent. We&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll<br/>
be looking into the gaming store---and my 14 year old wants a skateboarding<br/>
funshop (?!). I&#39;m adding more every day as people get in touch with me.<br/>
<br/>
Keep ideas coming!<br/>
