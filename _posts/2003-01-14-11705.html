&lt;&lt; I think she&#39;s aspiring to be a 70 year old triathlete!  I admire her and <br/>
you <br/>
 for your training regimens... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well save all of your admiration for her, really!! I am no where near her <br/>
level. I can&#39;t even think about doing an ironman at this point. Certainly <br/>
don&#39;t have the time to dedicate to that level of triathlon nor the <br/>
inclination.<br/>
I do sprint level triathlons....it&#39;s perfect for people that want to have a <br/>
normal life and do triathlon. The level she is at it would be nigh to <br/>
impossible for me to work part time and have a family. They&#39;d never see me.<br/>
My training is anywhere from 1/2 hour to an hour on typical days. <br/>
Occasionally longer, especially when getting close to competition. But <br/>
nothing like those Ironwomen!!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
