<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012178751">Hello again,<br/>
I get grief from practically everyone about &quot;unschooling&quot;. I call it &quot;child-led-learning&quot; because &quot;unschooling&quot; seems to set everyone in a panic. My mother says,&quot;They&#39;re so smart- please don&#39;t ruin them.&quot; - in front of the girls! argh-<br/>
My best and dearest friend- who is a hs&#39;er but a curriculumaholic- bless her anal heart- is very concerned that they will not learn what they need to- even though my &quot;kindergartener&quot; (hate that)- is keeping up with her 1st grader. I know they all mean well- but a little confidence in me would be nice.  I also know that with time they will see that this is the best choice for my girls- and if not-- TOO BAD! (giggle). Everyone else keeps quiet- I guess they think I&#39;ll send them to school before long-<br/>
