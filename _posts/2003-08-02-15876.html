&gt; inevitably <br/>
&gt; croaks :-(. Maybe I should try cherry tomatoes, cuz I love &#39;em and maybe they<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanx Brenda, I may have to try that. I am desparate to grow food, the seeds <br/>
just see me and decide their fate before I take them out of the package. Last <br/>
year I went to Walmart, who in our area, has a humongous plant center. They <br/>
were out of seeds!!! I was shocked and disappointed until Phil (DH)said yeah, <br/>
well the earth must have let Walmart know I was on my way, so they decided to <br/>
save the seelings before I got there. It was hard to pout while I was laughing <br/>
so hard.<br/>
