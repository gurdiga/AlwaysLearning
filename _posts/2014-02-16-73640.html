<div id="ygrps-yiv-69026186"><div>I need help looking at this, and seeing my options for moving toward kindness, and peace.</div>My 4 yr old is being rude to his father a lot, and myself, at times. &nbsp;He&#39;s pretty sweet in general, and friendly and kind. &nbsp;He is sweet to my husband when he wants something from him. &nbsp;I think his rudeness is mostly coming from a lot of accumulated, pent-up frustrations and anger and powerlessness.<div>How to address it has been swirling around in my head for a few weeks, and I&#39;ve tried different things. &nbsp;Mostly I keep coming back to, addressing my own tendency toward impatience and rudeness first makes the most sense.</div><div>We (my husband and I ) have often been rude to him, with our tone and our words. &nbsp;When I hear my son being rude, I hear an echo of my husband and I. &nbsp;</div><div>For months I have being paying attention to my words and my tone, being kinder and more patient, but I am still occasionally using a rude tone. &nbsp;When I catch it, I apologize and rephrase. &nbsp;</div><div>It REALLY bothers my husband when his son talks to him rudely. &nbsp;Things get really tense really quickly between them.</div><div>I&#39;ve noticed that I get anxious about it too, that they&#39;re having these interactions. &nbsp;I know the anxiety I&#39;m feeling isn&#39;t helpful to either of them (or me for that matter), and I think it comes from this feeling of, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to make this better.&quot;</div><div>My guess also, is that the anxiety is interfering with my ability to really watch and see what is working and what isn&#39;t...&nbsp;</div><div>I feel like part of what my son is doing is experimenting with powerful language. &nbsp;He tends toward tense and reactive, he gets overwhelmed quickly with too many words (and I&#39;ve tended toward being too much of a talker), and is quick to yell and get emotional.</div><div>An example that comes to mind is last night my husband came home with two new toy cars for the boys, it was so sweet, and I could tell he was happy about it, but when he showed it to my son, Josh frowned and his whole body drooped and he said, &quot;Ugh, I didn&#39;t want this, daddy,&quot; in an irritated tone. &nbsp;I think he was expecting something familiar - when his dad brings home something, it&#39;s usually a specific kind of candy, and he was irritated at it not being what he expected. &nbsp;He actually played with the car right away and enjoyed it. &nbsp;I told my husband (later) that I thought it was such a sweet gesture, and that Josh seemed really thrown off by the surprise. &nbsp;It feels like I&#39;m making excuses for him, at least, I know my husband feels that way about it.&nbsp;</div><div>What I said to Josh, a little later, was &quot;when you say &#39;I didn&#39;t want this,&#39; it hurts people&#39;s feelings, I think it hurt daddy&#39;s feelings.&quot; &nbsp;He interrupted me mid-sentence, talking over me and changing the subject (I know he does this when he&#39;s feeling overwhelmed by what I&#39;m saying). &nbsp;I didn&#39;t know what else to say or do. &nbsp;</div><div>Later that evening they were playing a video game together and my son kept saying things like, &quot;Ex-CUSE-me, I SAID not to JUMP! Ugh!&quot; &nbsp;Another thing he&#39;s been saying a lot lately is, &quot;UGH, fine, whatever!&quot; This is something his dad says to him when they&#39;re having a struggle over something - like, when my husband is telling my son to do something or not do something, and they start arguing, My husband will usually end it with, &quot;Fine, whatever, do what you want.&quot; I&#39;ve been intervening as quickly as I can in these cases, either helping my son do what his father asked, or removing him from doing whatever he&#39;s being asked not to do. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>I&#39;ve tried various verbal approaches with Josh, &quot;that&#39;s not a nice way to talk to someone who is trying to help you play,&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t want to play if you&#39;re going to talk to me like that-&quot; he usually gets really upset when I say that. &nbsp;&quot;I won&#39;t let you talk to daddy that way.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me like that.&quot;&nbsp;</div><div>I&#39;ve also offered alternative, more polite phrasing, and he seems most receptive to that approach. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I think where I&#39;m getting stuck is in having difficulty accepting that THIS is where my son is, right now, and I&#39;m feeling anxious to change him into a nicer, more polite little boy. &nbsp;I know this is not helpful, or very kind.</div><div><br></div><div>My husband suggested that he&#39;s learning all these phrases and rude attitude from let&#39;s play you tube videos, and when I&#39;ve said things like, &#39;I don&#39;t know, he really kind of reminds me of us,&#39; he gets pretty huffy. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I think my first step with this is to breathe and relax more about it; to accept my son as he is right now (a little boy who is doing his best to talk and assert himself with the parents he loves, and to have his voice heard, who is dealing with strong feelings of anger and frustration, the way he&#39;s learned is appropriate from the people he loves). To accept that *I* haven&#39;t been the best example in the past, and that changing myself isn&#39;t happening overnight, but moment by moment. &nbsp;What works when it&#39;s just me and him is for me to respond gently to whatever he&#39;s trying to express, &quot;I fell in that hole and now we have to start over,&quot; and then maybe add sometimes, &quot;please be gentle with me. I&#39;m doing my best.&quot; &nbsp;And keep it fun and lighthearted, on my end. &nbsp;I have a harder time knowing what to say or do when it&#39;s him and my husband. &nbsp;I understand how they both feel. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s okay for my son to be rude to his dad (or anyone), and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s okay for my husband to be rude to our son, either. &nbsp;I&#39;ve often been rude in expressing these things to both of them. &nbsp;So, I&#39;m feeling insecure about how to approach this in a way that will be helpful and kind for them both. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div><br></div><div>Lisa C &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512582273"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-512582273gmail_extra">Hi Lisa</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-512582273gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-512582273gmail_extra">It may be helpful to remind yourself of your son&#39;s young age. He is only four - he&#39;s tiny! All children will go through phases of experimenting with how they talk. Don&#39;t panic. Just because he&#39;s not learning it *right now* doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t learn it ever. And remind your DH of this.</div>
<div class="ygrps-yiv-512582273gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-512582273gmail_extra">I&#39;ve learned that with adults who are rude as well as children, you can &#39;take the wind out of their sails&#39; by responding with genuine, loving kindness, as if the rudeness wasn&#39;t there at all. I hope it doesn&#39;t make them feel ashamed of how they spoke as shame is a horrid feeling, but I have noticed it makes them aware of how they spoke in contrast to the way they&#39;re responded to...maybe? Anyway, that may help...intentionally responding to the example you gave with an genuinely kind and concerned &#39;Oh, I&#39;m really sorry. I didn&#39;t want to get you something that would upset you. What could I do to make it better for you? Shall I take it back and bring something else tomorrow when I come home?&#39; may well have been met with &#39;Oh, actually, it&#39;s pretty cool. Thank you.&#39;<br>
<br>I also remind them before we have a present opening session, like at Christmas for example, that if they don&#39;t like what they&#39;re given, it&#39;s kinder to the giver to pretend you like it - not over the top, but to say thank you graciously. I try not to reprimand afterwards...so it&#39;s kind of pro-active rather than re-active. My 7yo opened a present from my sister this year that she&#39;d already been given the day before. She gave no indication of disappointment whatsoever! She said thank you, smiled and looked over at me...of course I winked at her and later said how amazed I was at how she responded and if she was disappointed, we could take it to the shop and swap it for something she&#39;d prefer in private or we could let Aunty Carla know quietly and I know she&#39;d be more than happy to swap it for her - whichever my DD preferred. She was concerned about upsetting Aunty Carla (although she wouldn&#39;t have been upset - she&#39;s lovely) so chose to swap it discreetly.Â <br>
<br>When I forget to respond kindly, but I have enough presence of mind not to respond crossly, I tend to say things like &#39;you may not have meant it that way, but that sounded really rude. Next time can you change your tone of voice as it&#39;s upsetting to be spoken to the way you just spoke to me.&#39; My third DD (7) says &#39;Mummy&#39; in a really demanding, cross way at the moment. She doesn&#39;t know she&#39;s doing it. I demonstrated to her the difference between different tones of voice the other day and she&#39;s trying really hard to get out of the habit (I think these things do become habits...just like our own reactions to things...we realise how ingrained they are in us when our children do it back at us!).<br>
<br>Like you, I also hear my words and tone of voice in my children so I am honest about my own attempts to try to speak more nicely by saying things like &#39;I&#39;m sorry, I spoke rudely - we&#39;ll have to help each other remember to try to speak more kindly&#39; often and when I need to remind them, I say &#39;I know I forget sometimes too, so I&#39;m not cross, just pointing it out because I don&#39;t think you wanted to be rude.&#39;<br>
<br>I&#39;ve spent a long time &#39;refining&#39; my approach to &#39;rudeness&#39; and trusting that my children will learn things if they&#39;re told it kindly often enough over time. We&#39;ve never punished rudeness, but we have got cross at times...which never works and always makes the situation worse. The rudeness usually abates very quickly when we&#39;re calm and loving and trusting about it.</div>
<div class="ygrps-yiv-512582273gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-512582273gmail_extra">I hope that helps and also that it fits with unschooling principles...I&#39;m eager to understand why not if it doesn&#39;t :)</div></div></div>

It&#39;s a massive ego stroke. It says &quot;I&#39;m a good parent&quot; and &quot;I am appreciated&quot;. The trouble is, most kids aren&#39;t very good at stroking their parents egos - certainly most 4yos aren&#39;t unless everything&#39;s going well in the moment And they&#39;re in the mood to pay attention to the people around them and stroke their egos. So rather than looking for ways to smooth things over between dad and son, maybe look for other ways to help dad feel good about himself. You be the one to tell him he&#39;s loved and appreciated. Notice his good qualities (out loud, to him). Notice when he&#39;s thoughtful and patient and kind. Don&#39;t try to teach him to be a better dad, help him feel good about who he is right now so he has some faith in his own ability to be even better.&nbsp;<div><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:13.541666030883789px;word-spacing:normal;font-size:13px;">&nbsp;What works when it&#39;s just me and him is for me to respond gently to whatever he&#39;s trying to express, &quot;I fell in that hole and now we have to start over,&quot; and then maybe add sometimes, &quot;please be gentle with me.

Once or twice. Then drop it. Ask him if he wants you to step in when things get tense or not - he might feel like it&#39;s criticism, and that&#39;s not helpful. It could be better to stay out of it for now and offer each of them support separately. You can&#39;t fix his relationship with his son for him, but you can push them further apart by getting in the middle too much.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:13.541666030883789px;word-spacing:normal;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:13.541666030883789px;word-spacing:normal;font-size:13px;">---Meredith</span></div></div>

 </span></blockquote>That doesn&#39;t sound much different than what he&#39;s saying. He gets a present he doesn&#39;t like, so he&#39;s critical. You hear something you don&#39;t like, so you&#39;re critical.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming he&#39;s saying what he feels because he doesn&#39;t understand. But either he *can&#39;t* (yet) understand. Or he doesn&#39;t know *how* to act differently. Intellectually knowing something isn&#39;t the same as knowing how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
It *is* pretty high level thought to put your feelings into words and then try to image how someone else will feel about those words. It&#39;s going to be a rare 4 yo who can do that. I think it&#39;s not until kids are 5 or 6 before they grasp that others don&#39;t share their feelings. In other words if they&#39;re doing something they think is fun, they just don&#39;t get that it&#39;s possible the other person isn&#39;t feeling the same.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, do that. He&#39;s barely had any experience with social interactions. They&#39;re complex! And he needs to see and hear how it&#39;s done lots and lots and lots to grasp it. But don&#39;t turn each instance into a lesson with the expectation that he learn what you&#39;re teaching. Make it short and quick. Give him the opportunity to absorb.<br/>

and I said I didn&#39;t want to play. &nbsp;&quot;Why&quot; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t like it when you&#39;re mean.&quot; &nbsp;So she invited me back and adjusted the game so she wasn&#39;t being the mean boss who was threatening to fire me and throw me out every time I did what she told me to do. :-) She would wad up my playdoh pizza and say &quot;WRONG! &nbsp;You&#39;re fired!&quot;

with her, for her, because I knew I was going home soon, and she would be around other people, and it couldn&#39;t hurt for her to have those scenarios in her repertoire. &nbsp;Someone might just stand up and walk away. &nbsp;Someone might ask her to be nicer, or not play.</span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">-=-</span></font><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">What works when it&#39;s just me and him is for me to respond gently to whatever he&#39;s trying to express, &quot;I fell in that hole and now we have to start over,&quot;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237276587"><blockquote><span title="ireply"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve noticed that I get anxious about it too, that they&#39;re having these interactions. &nbsp;I know the anxiety I&#39;m feeling isn&#39;t helpful to either of them (or me for that matter), and I think it comes from this feeling of, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to make this better.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span><br>

 </div></span></blockquote><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">Something that helped me was to look closely at where my need to make things better was coming from. &nbsp;I&#39;ll share something that was true for me. &nbsp;My dad is a lifelong alcoholic. &nbsp;He&#39;s in his eighties now, so can&#39;t physically get away with drinking as much as he used to, but he still drinks a lot more than I could ever tolerate. &nbsp;From a very young age, my mom has talked with me about the issues she has faced with my dad&#39;s drinking. &nbsp;I won&#39;t get into detail here, but the consequence of her confiding in me were that I took on the role of caregiver and problem solver. &nbsp;Not in a good way. &nbsp;In a controlling way. &nbsp;I got my feelings of self-worth from fixing people. &nbsp;</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">In recognizing why I felt the need to make things better, I uncovered the source of my anxiety when I couldn&#39;t achieve that goal. &nbsp;I also began to recognize that I am not responsible for making things better for others. &nbsp;I&#39;m responsible for making things good for myself, and, sometimes, when it&#39;s welcome, using what I have learned to help others do the same for themselves.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> </span></blockquote></span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An example that comes to mind is last night my husband came home with two new toy cars for the boys, it was so sweet, and I could tell he was happy about it, but when he showed it to my son, Josh frowned and his whole body drooped and he said, &quot;Ugh, I didn&#39;t want this, daddy,&quot; in an irritated tone.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><br>

 </font></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">I think there are excuses and there are facts. &nbsp;The reality is your son is only four and is just starting to learn how to interact with people graciously. &nbsp;I have found that I can influence how my husband responds to situations by how I respond to situations. &nbsp;If I cringe and look sorrowful, my husband feels that too and has a more negative reaction himself. &nbsp;If I do my best to address the reality of the situation in as calm and lighthearted a way as I can muster, it helps him do the same. &nbsp;After, when my son is out of earshot, I might offer my husband a chance to laugh and vent about it, but in a way that highlights the fact that my son is young and learning, and we&#39;re the one&#39;s he&#39;s learning from. &nbsp;</span></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350843725">Something I try to do when my 4 year old in particular, and also my older kids, ask for something rudely, is to happily repeat the request in a politer way - so if Millie comes into the kitchen and says &#39;Mummy - drink!&#39; I might say &#39;Would you like me to get you a drink?&#39; and she usually smiles and says &#39;yes please&#39; and the rudeness disappears. It helps me because it gives me a way to act that isn&#39;t reacting directly to the rudeness, and escalating the situation, and it helps her by seeing politer behaviour being modelled. It works well with my older kids too and even with my Mum, if she she&#39;s being snappy or stressed, I find if I can rephrase her request in kinder words, kind of a &#39;oh, would you like us to do .....&#39; then she relaxes and seems pleased that someone understood her - in the past I would have reacted to the rude tone and we would have snapped at each other and the thing she asked for would have not got done or done unwillingly.<div>Annie<br class="ygrps-yiv-350843725yui-cursor"><div class="ygrps-yiv-350843725ygroups-quoted"><br><br></div></div></div>
