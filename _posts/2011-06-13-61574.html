<div id="ygrps-yiv-974413404">I&#39;m new to unschooling, since last year when my son was about 4yr, though have been looking at home education route since he was about 3yr. <br/>
<br/>
Last easter my family went to France to visit the grandparents and also to spend few days with the family of my husband&#39;s friend. When they found out last year that we don&#39;t send our son to school, they&#39;ve been asking lots of questions about home education, especially the wife. She seems to be intrigued, and perhaps even would like to try it but there are a lot of things that make her thinks she can&#39;t do it. Lots of usual questions like socialisation, or how to cope with having children all the time at home, etc, I&#39;ve answered them as best I know. However, last easter she came up with more questions that I couldn&#39;t answer to her satisfaction because my knowledge is only as far as how it works in the UK. Things like: what about exams? What about getting a job? (They said you can&#39;t get a job in France without getting any qualification, hence the importance of passing exams). Is it possible to unschool in France? (I think they need to register and have evaluation yearly?) There were more questions but I can&#39;t remember.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to find info for them but my french is very limited so not much I can offer, and even those sites I found, I&#39;m not confidence about the content. And her english is not that great either so reading in english might be too tiring for her.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m wondering if you have links in french that she can read up. Better still, if you live in France (or know someone who does), and don&#39;t mind answering all her questions, it would be great if you would let me send her your email address. They live in Brittany, not far from Rennes in case that&#39;s an important detail.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>

Titis,<br/>
Ask her to e-mail me as soon as you wake up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Brittany this week, and home ed families are gathering here for the next three days.  I think ten families will be here, some camping, some staying in gites, and so if they want to come here Wednesday might be the best day.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/france">http://sandradodd.com/france</a> has some info, but our main discussion is 2:00 Wednesday afternoon.  Even if she misses that, she can still meet other families if she comes on thursday.<br/>
<br/>
I can ask these folks what online resources they most trust, too.<br/>
<br/>
There are some of my articles in French (and some other people&#39;s, linked) here:<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling *anywhere* is only doable when the family can figure out how they can comply with the laws, and it might help for people to consider these formats for describing unschooling:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a> because these sorts of descriptions can be adapted to local requirements.  Some places are easier than others.  <br/>
