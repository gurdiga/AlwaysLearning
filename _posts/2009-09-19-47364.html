<div id="ygrps-yiv-53894232">If people want information, this list is a good resource.<br/>
If people want support, there&#39;s this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a><br/>
<br/>
When people want to find an excuse not to unschool they write me  <br/>
things like this and they feel somehow superior and strong, but it&#39;s  <br/>
an illusion and their children are not helped:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I find your site as well as your list condescending and full of  <br/>
arrogant and snobby people.  If your goal is steer people away from  <br/>
unschooling and to let people know that unschoolers are a bunch of  <br/>
whackjobs, you&#39;re doing a excellent job.  You&#39;ve definitely opened my  <br/>
eyes to that fact that I don&#39;t want to be associated with unschoolers  <br/>
or subject my daughter to the type of narrowmindedness I&#39;ve  <br/>
experienced on your list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This hurt the author more than it hurt me.   The list thrives, my  <br/>
children are thriving, and the site and list will remain to help  <br/>
people for years to come.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think they&#39;re really feeling superior and strong.  They may wish they could feel that way.  I think they write you because they&#39;re feeling insecure and embarrassed after hearing thoughtful arguments against some of their own ideas and actions.  <br/>
<br/>
***...unschoolers are a bunch of whackjobs...***<br/>
<br/>
My kids life is better in big ways because of the things you&#39;ve written.  If it helps any I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a whackjob.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137771983">Wow,<br/>
I always think when I&#39;m fighting my schooled self &quot;what would sandra say?&quot;<br/>
and I always know exactly what you would write....and I tell myself &quot;Back<br/>
off, leave them alone, let them find their way, strew......&quot;  I still have<br/>
issues, but this list keeps me focussed.....<br/>
And when some amazing moment happens like &quot;rounding up&quot; or &quot;dividing&quot;<br/>
or reading incredibly big words for an incredibly small boy in real life<br/>
that takes hours to teach kids in the classroom I know you guys are right!<br/>
