<div id="ygrps-yiv-743525433">Thursday when I went in search of the trick or treat bag.  I found it<br/>
still with candy from last year.<br/>
<br/>
Two friends went out with Dylan.  They are older than Dylan and one is an<br/>
unschooler, no candy limits, the other gets candy rarely.  <br/>
When we came home the girl who seldom gets candy started munching like<br/>
mad.   Dylan sorted the kinds he likes into a bowl and said his dad could<br/>
have the rest.  Dylan&#39;s share fit into a cereal bowl, and his dad&#39;s into<br/>
a large mixing bowl.   He had two pieces Thursday night and I haven&#39;t<br/>
seen him in it at all since.  It&#39;s on the kitchen table.  <br/>
Anna&#39;s mom tells me her candy is almost gone, and she thought about<br/>
taking it away from her and giving it out in portions.  <br/>
The other boy gave half of his to his older brother when he got home and<br/>
his mom say&#39;s they&#39;ve hardly touched it.  <br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what I know about unschooling candy.<br/>

<br/>
THERE IT IS. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s some great proof!<br/>
I&#39;m saving your post, Deb.<br/>
<br/>
Have you sent it to Anna&#39;s mother?  YOU SHOULD.<br/>
<br/>

taking it away from her and giving it out in portions.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
My mom one year let us have two per day.<br/>
<br/>
We would eat it down to the last molecule no matter how vile a crummy little <br/>
tootsie-roll miniature it might be, because we waited all day for our two <br/>
crummy little pieces of candy.  I don&#39;t think that was done other days.<br/>
<br/>
My mom would get a box of chocolates each Christmas.  She would let each of <br/>
us have one piece a day, but whatever we got we had to eat.  Even if we <br/>
didn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
YUCK!  STUPID!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll let Holly bite off the corner of my fancy chocolates when I get them (as <br/>
I did when I was home with a broken leg and a friend send Godiva chocolates). <br/>
 If she likes it she can have it.  If she doesn&#39;t, I might eat it later.  If <br/>
I don&#39;t like it, it goes in the trash.<br/>

hers and we always end up throwing a lot of it away.  This year <br/>
my mom is here and helping to eat it though (she&#39;s got a serious <br/>
sweet tooth!).<br/>
She&#39;s more into lemon poppy seed muffins at the moment &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
