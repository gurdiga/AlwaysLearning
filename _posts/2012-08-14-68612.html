<br/>
New example at the bottom of &quot;abundance&quot;:<br/>

<br/>
Portuguese translation of one of Pam Sorooshian&#39;s pages and two interviews with me:<br/>
Princ�pios do &quot;Unschooling&quot;<br/>
Porque fiz �unschooling� com os meus tr�s filhos<br/>
Uma Entrevista com Sandra Dodd, 1998<br/>

If you know anyone who reads Portuguese, forward this on! <br/>
Marta Pires (in Portugal) did the translations, and Alex Polikowsky (from Brazil) did a pass to help polish them up.<br/>
