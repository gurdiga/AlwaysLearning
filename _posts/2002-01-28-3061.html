was so disheartening, I was certain it was a plot to gain inside information<br/>

I remember when everyone was posting goodbyes(after getting TOS offenses for<br/>
merely speaking their minds-myself included) and folks were posting lyrics<br/>
or poems - I searched the web for a song that matched my feelings.  The only<br/>
one I found was from &quot;Man from LaMancha&quot; it still seems terribly<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I don&#39;t know if it was talk behind the scenes or on the boards but some<br/>
people mentioned the same tactics had been used in a couple of other forums.<br/>
Rumor, not hard fact, but it does make sense.<br/>
<br/>
When AOL first began it provided the space and told folks to create the type<br/>
of place their special interest group would use. So Trekkies created the<br/>
Star Trek area. Jews created the Jewish area. Homeschoolers created the<br/>
homeschooling area. And they got these great speciality areas built all for<br/>
the cost of free AOL access. It would have cost them millions to pay experts<br/>
to do it. But volunteers voluntarily put in oodles of hours for fun.<br/>
<br/>
And then AOL decided it wanted a more uniform product, with more control<br/>
over content -- *probably* to make marketing it to advertisers easier. And<br/>
the folks running the areas weren&#39;t going to take that. (Which certainly<br/>
*was* a fact in the homeschooling area! I also remember Helen saying AOL put<br/>
a lot of pressure on her to accept AOL chosen advertisement in her HEM area.<br/>
AOL couldn&#39;t do the same to her since hers was a private area.) So AOL drove<br/>
them out.<br/>
<br/>
I was kind of assuming part of the tactic was to use stupid and incompetent<br/>
people to drive the old guard out but looking back on it, they were asked so<br/>
many pointed clear questions over and over and the questions were ignored or<br/>
given irrelevant answers or just plain pulled. I don&#39;t think anyone could be<br/>
that naturally and consistently incompetent and stupid ;-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my take on it. I didn&#39;t last behind the scenes until the end. Perhaps<br/>
someone else who was (Deb?) can offer a more insightful perspective.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; Do you really think, in retrospect, that it was a skillful planned<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; attack?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. <br/>
Well, not an attack, but a pre-planned undermining and restructuring.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And they got these great speciality areas built all for<br/>
the cost of free AOL access. It would have cost them millions to pay experts<br/>
to do it. But volunteers voluntarily put in oodles of hours for fun.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At first, when AOL was $2.90 an hour for the time you were logged in (people <br/>
used to download mail with &quot;flashsessions&quot; so they could only be on for <br/>
seconds at a time so they didn&#39;t pass their first five hours limit, I think <br/>
it was--$9.95 for the first five hours, and $2.90 an hour after??--then what <br/>
volunteers got was one hour free for each hour they worked.  Some had <br/>
overhead accounts--totally free.  So that was the cushy deal, they could stay <br/>
on as much as they wanted without counting.<br/>
<br/>
Then the price went up to $20 and anyone in the world could stay on as long <br/>
as they wanted.  So working for them for 30 hours a week used to seem to be <br/>
worth $90, and suddenly it was worth $2.50 or less.  And about that time they <br/>
started wanting MORE work from volunteers--reports, and training sessions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true that many of the same people brought that energy outside and made <br/>
it available to more people.   And it is WONDERFUL that HEM is paying for <br/>
some very nice bulletin board space, because those don&#39;t come free.  And it&#39;s <br/>
cool that yahoogroups exists, because before groups like this, people had to <br/>
go to newsgroups and those aren&#39;t very airy and sunny.<br/>
<br/>
So even without the particulars of the meanness of the final year or so of <br/>
the AOL glory, when LOTS of homeschoolers got AOL just for the homeschooling <br/>
forum, and there was a forum for GWS (very small and quiet, because they <br/>
never were computer-busy folk) and HEM (NOT so small and quiet!) and it was <br/>
worth people&#39;s money to sign up just for homeschooling support, the change <br/>
would probably have come anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are also the majordomo or some other list service software run groups.<br/>
Both Home-Ed with over 800 members and the UL with 300+ members use majordomo. <br/>
But Majordomo isn&#39;t for a non-computer savvy person or else you have to pay<br/>
a fee for it.  I&#39;ve just stepped up to be one of the admins for the Home-Ed<br/>
list and there&#39;s a much steeper learning curve there than at Yahoo!  I&#39;ve<br/>
been on a number of majordomo run lists - long before this web stuff came<br/>
along - so there was an alternative to the newsgroups.  The newsgroups were<br/>
probably a very different culture from AOL but I thought they were great!  <br/>
<br/>
I think that Yahoo has been useful for homeschoolers. I also think it can <br/>
lead to a Balkanization of homeschoolers.  It&#39;s so easy when the list isn&#39;t<br/>
just how you want it to go off in a huff and start a new list.  (And Sandra<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you did here.)  <br/>
<br/>
One of the most important to my growth as an unschooler  was the <br/>
Unschoolers Circle list.  Debbie Mitchell ran it and it was an off-shoot of <br/>
the UL (unschooler&#39;s list) because some of the people on the UC were <br/>
very direct and asked pointed questions and called people on their BS <br/>
and were not welcome by the administrator of the UL.  I was quite content <br/>
there for some time, if you can call it being content to be examining a lot of<br/>
beliefs about parening and living.  Then a lot of new people came in and <br/>
decided that the old-guard weren&#39;t nice enough.  In the ensuing debate the <br/>
list died.  It&#39;s still around and there may be 5 posts a month but the <br/>
old-guard-call-it-like-they-see-it are gone.  And what makes it all <br/>
so very interesting to me from a social understanding point of view is <br/>
two of the loudest (about things not being nice) were involved in the <br/>
troubles at unschooling.com - Lynda and Sarah.  I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
stop it.  Debbie had a strong bias towards free speech and didn&#39;t <br/>
interfere.  I&#39;ve been on the Internet for a long time and I&#39;m a strong <br/>
advocate of free speech too.  I also realize that everything is <br/>
impermanent.  But it bothers me to see some of the same people repeating <br/>
the same behaviour again and again.<br/>

targeted by them in the past.  It seems as though they<br/>
never learn that maybe it is them.  Why would they<br/>
have to keep starting new lists if it wasn&#39;t?  I like<br/>
Sarah, she is a very caring person, but it is<br/>
unfortunate she often chooses being nice over being<br/>
honest and takes honesty as an attack.  It is amusing<br/>
that they also have a tendency to find some one to<br/>
call a &#39;spy&#39;, especially when they admit to knowing<br/>
what is being discussed on this list.<br/>
