<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712687715">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sarah and I&#39;m mama to 2 boys:Sage is  6 and Dakota is 8.  We&#39;ve<br/>
been unschooling from the beginning, but I do have to admit that my idea of<br/>
unschooling was tragically misguided for many years and I now feel that I&#39;m<br/>
getting on the right track - finally!  I&#39;ve been reading this list for some<br/>
time now and haven&#39;t really posted much of anything, but I really have<br/>
learned so much from you all and enjoy the list tremendously.  Thanks for<br/>
all the goodies you all put out there.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I have found myself in the rut of the dirty house and exactly what<br/>
needed to be done about it.  When I don&#39;t slow down and enjoy the moment, I<br/>
get all crazy and foaming at the mouth over the state of the house and<br/>
eventually turn really bitchy towards my kids.  Completely unnecessary and I<br/>
have known all along that it wasn&#39;t about the mess, per se, as it was my<br/>
feelings of discomfort with my surroundings and insecurity that what we&#39;re<br/>
trying to do is working.  Knowing this and needing some resources, I spent<br/>
some time this morning reading Sandra&#39;s page on chores (<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/chores) and it seemed to help.  However, for me, reading<br/>
the words and practicing the words are very different things and I wondered<br/>
if I&#39;d be able to put this into practice.<br/>
<br/>
As the universe often works, not 20 minutes after I left the computer, I was<br/>
confronted with a pile of wooden and metal trains all over the floor right<br/>
in front of my laundry room - it was almost as if they were inviting me to<br/>
step on them, slip, and break my neck.  In that moment, I had the choice to<br/>
a) call my kids down from their Wii game to come clean them up, b) do<br/>
nothing and leave them there, or c) clean them up myself.  I chose C and did<br/>
it with a smile.  In the 15 seconds that it took me to clean that mess up, I<br/>
was reminded of an incident not too long ago where I had a complete meltdown<br/>
with regards to the the toys in the basement.  At one point, I was literally<br/>
*throwing* hot wheels at the cement floor and screaming at my kids.  It was<br/>
a full fledged typical 2 year old temper tantrum!!!  I&#39;m 32 years old and<br/>
here I was essentially flinging myself onto the floor, kicking and screaming<br/>
and demanding my way!  Not my most shining moment.  After I remembered that<br/>
tantrum, I also remembered that I was never ever &quot;allowed&quot; to have a tantrum<br/>
as a kid.  All strong emotions were squashed.  I couldn&#39;t be angry, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t be sad, I couldn&#39;t be scared, I couldn&#39;t feel worried, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
be confused.  I couldn&#39;t do anything other than &quot;get over&quot; myself and &quot;do<br/>
something about it.&quot;  I was never allowed to feel or show anyone else that /<br/>
what I was feeling.  But you know what I DID have to do?  Clean.  Always had<br/>
to clean.  Every surface, every spot, every dish, every window, everything.<br/>
No wonder I have such issues about cleaning the house --I grew up being<br/>
forced to clean other people&#39;s messes and my own things (which I never<br/>
considered to be a mess, btw,) and never being allowed to have feelings<br/>
about it or anything else!!!<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly I had such compassion for my younger self and a newfound compassion<br/>
for my children.  It took me 15 seconds to clean up that mess.  It would<br/>
have taken them at least 20 minutes when you add in all the time that would<br/>
have been spent arguing and forcing and manipulating.  Nothing at all would<br/>
have been gained from having them clean it up, but I gained huge insight by<br/>
doing it myself.<br/>
<br/>

Sarah, I&#39;m so sorry your post was stuck in the queue.  I read the end  <br/>
of my e-mail and thought that was all, and went and did a bunch of  <br/>
stuff, and came back and discovered morning mail I had just totally   <br/>
missed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES!  THis kind of thinking gets me through a LOT.  Seeing things from <br/>
the child perspective is so important.  It&#39;s hard work being a kid! It <br/>
also takes work to remember that perspecive as you get older.  It comes <br/>
more naturally to some than others, but it can be developed from <br/>
whatever stage one is at. When of my older children was stressing the <br/>
little one out (hey..it happens)I suggested she imagine living in a <br/>
world where EVERONE is way bigger than you are and you&#39;re taken places <br/>
and you don&#39;t always know where you&#39;re going or what everyone is <br/>
talking about.  She hadn&#39;t meant to be stressing him out she just <br/>
didn&#39;t have the full picture.<br/>

Thanks for telling us about this experience, Sarah. I really hope it  <br/>
inspires you to create more and more of such moments. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve  <br/>
inspired others here, too.<br/>

Not many therapists would&#39;ve recommended picking the stuff up  <br/>
yourself happily, I bet, though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my son was little, he loved spreading the Duplo (big Lego) blocks  <br/>
around the floor while using them.  When it was time to pick them up,  <br/>
I made a game of it: I&#39;d race him to see who could pick them up  <br/>
fastest, and who could throw them into the plastic bucket the  <br/>
*loudest.*  Great fun for a little boy!  (This is the same kid who, a  <br/>
few years later, enjoyed smashing broken toys with a baseball bat...   <br/>
And today, he&#39;s playing in a Smash Brothers video game tournament...  <br/>
hmmm.)<br/>
<br/>
When he graduated to Lego blocks, I&#39;d loan him my jelly roll pans  <br/>
(cookie sheets with an edge all around) to dump them on.  He could  <br/>
sort through the blocks easily, and the pans both kept them from being  <br/>
lost to the vacuum and made it really easy to put back in the buckets.<br/>

We have several of those in dedicated-to-toys roles.  The magnetic  <br/>
poetry words, other magnets, art supplies.<br/>
<br/>
Also plastic silverware trays from garage sales or thrift stores.   <br/>
not the ones with particular shapes for spoons, but just rectangular  <br/>
spaces--our &quot;attribute blocks&quot; (the wooden shape tiles) live in two  <br/>
of those, and colored pencils have one, and my calligraphy supplies  <br/>
used to have one.<br/>

Lilly (4.5) is a dumper. We just bought two of the smallest plastic pools we<br/>
could find which are about 4 ft in diameter for her to dump stuff in and<br/>
have it to play with. It has helped, but she still dumps on the floor and<br/>
that&#39;s okay too.<br/>

my sons train table into a lego table.  Sometimes the projects end up on<br/>
the floor but when I vacuum, I can just set them up there.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we just need another train table... [:)] !<br/>
