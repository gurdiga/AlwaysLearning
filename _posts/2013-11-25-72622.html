<br>
 I&#39;m not sure when I joined this list, but I think it&#39;s been at least four years.  In that time, my relationships with everyone, especially family, have improved and our lives are sweeter and more joyful :) <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724793804">Thanks for all the kid words.  I&#39;m back from vacation, have napped it off, am back on schedule and see that I misspelled &quot;Twelfth.&quot;  <br/>
Sorry to good spellers who kept seeing that. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to be home.  Projects at the moment are an interview in Spanish tomorrow that will be available to view at some point (I&#39;ll speak English, there will be translators, it will all be one video, switching from one speaker to another, so it can be understood in English or Spanish either).  I&#39;ll bring that link when it&#39;s available.<br/>
<br/>
Just Add Light continues.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com</a>  <br/>
That&#39;s three years and three months old (I missed the anniversary, and I would&#39;ve guessed two and a half years; time flies!), and has 1183 posts, with a randomizer (thanks to Joyce who found the code) in the upper right where it says &quot;Surprise me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday chats continue.  This week is the last of a series of chats on sections of The Big Book of Unschooling.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com">http://chatnotes-unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
After that we&#39;ll come up with some other serie of topics.<br/>
This is a two-hour text chat, noon to two mountain time, evening in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
I work on the webpage and announce changes and additions here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I share ideas that don&#39;t necessarily fit into  other places here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com</a><br/>
In my opinion, that should be the most popular thing among unschoolers, but it languishes.  Still, I use it myself to collect and remember and connect and appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s my newest project, the wheelbarrow collection.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wheelbarrowthings.blogspot.com">http://wheelbarrowthings.blogspot.com</a><br/>
I have things I haven&#39;t put there yet.  People have started helping me collect them. :-)<br/>
I think wheelbarrows are elegant and fairly simple and everywhere and ignored.  <br/>
