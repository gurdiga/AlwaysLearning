&gt; My own late reader, spells really well too.  I think for her, it had to<br/>
&gt; do with collecting words.  She&#39;d see a word, ask me what it said, I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; tell her and she rarely forgot it after that.  Once she knew enough<br/>
&gt; words, she was able to read fluently.  So all those words, she knew by<br/>
&gt; how they looked first, not how they sounded.  It&#39;s a different way of<br/>
&gt; learning how to read than the system used in schools of sounding out of<br/>
&gt; words, which made absolutely no sense to her before she knew how to<br/>
&gt; read.<br/>

::waving madly:: That&#39;s us too!  Although I&#39;m not sure Rowan&#39;s a late<br/>
reader (he&#39;s six), he is all about the shape and the color and the<br/>
size and the font of the word. My mother, who is a librarian, picked<br/>
him out a copy of &quot;Max&#39;s Words&quot;,<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Words-Kate-Banks/dp/0374399492)">http://www.amazon.com/Maxs-Words-Kate-Banks/dp/0374399492)</a> and<br/>
launched his &quot;word collection&quot;. He has a latching green plastic box,<br/>
and a pair of scissors, and all forms of printed recyclable material<br/>
that enter my home get examined for interesting words, which are then<br/>
cut out and put in the box.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny; he adores words, but isn&#39;t so interested in putting them<br/>
together. I&#39;ve suggested that it&#39;s a lot like legos, where you take<br/>
the pieces and connect them in your own way to form your own thing,<br/>
unless it&#39;s like following the lego directions, where you build<br/>
something according to someone else&#39;s rules (like haiku). He likes the<br/>
idea but isn&#39;t ready to leap there yet. However if you take it down a<br/>
level, he&#39;s fascinated by how the letters go together. He adores<br/>
spelling. He spells words in conversation rather than saying them.<br/>
He&#39;s constantly asking how things are spelled, and from the outside,<br/>
it looks soooooooo schoolish. I would *never* have drilled him in<br/>
spelling the way he&#39;s asking to be drilled. But as long as he&#39;s asking<br/>
and it&#39;s making him happy, we&#39;re rolling with it.<br/>
