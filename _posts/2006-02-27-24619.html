<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617995993">3rd vote here for Crockpots!  You can put the stuff in when everyone&#39;s  still <br/>
asleep, or when you get a moment when they&#39;re playing, and not even have  to <br/>
think about it till dishing out the plates!  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, if your family doesn&#39;t mind leftovers, always prepare enough for 2  <br/>
days.  Takes same amount of time, but gives you every other day &quot;off&quot; from  <br/>
cooking.  We do this a lot with stuff like spaghetti, soup, beans and  <br/>
chili,...really anything!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-403506538">We do a lot of crockpot stuff too...I usually start after everyone  <br/>
has eaten lunch and is satiated for the time being. In a half hour, i  <br/>
can usually do breakfast dishes, lunch dishes and chop up some stuff  <br/>
for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you can take two hours on a weekend or something, you can  <br/>
prepare a lot of meat or veggies or both (if you&#39;re an omnivore like  <br/>
us!) put it in ziplock baggies with dates on it. That way you have it  <br/>
prepared to just throw in. I can cook five pounds of scrambled beef,  <br/>
two pounds of chicken breasts and a roast, and chop it up, divide it  <br/>
into 1lb bags and have all the food we&#39;d possibly want for a week.  <br/>
Same for veggies, chop up a few onions, peppers, and just have it  <br/>
divided into the snack size ziplocks.<br/>
<br/>
Like Nancy said, prepare for leftovers! We like to have &#39;redo&#39;  <br/>
nights. So if we have spaghetti on Monday, we&#39;ll use the leftover  <br/>
sauce to make pizza on Tuesday, maybe some baked rigatoni. Whatever.  <br/>
Taco meat can turn into shepard&#39;s pie or mexican cassarole.<br/>
