&lt;&lt;  Good grief. My daughter has just joined Girl Scouts and they <br/>
 seem fine with the non-Christian bit. Some of the other girls said <br/>
 she might go to hell cos she saw Harry Potter and has read read <br/>
 the books and were also surprised when she wouldn&#39;t say the <br/>
 Pledge (why should she, she&#39;s English) but generally its been fine.<br/>
 <br/>
 I wonder if I want her involved in an organisation like that!!<br/>

non-discrimination policies.<br/>
