<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003711797">I love paper. Have tons of notebooks everywhere. Problem is that i <br/>
never just fill up a notebook and then move on to the next. Oh no, i <br/>
have several notebooks with a page or two or ten filled, and alot of <br/>
blank pages in between. Yesterday, i had grabbed one, and was making <br/>
my &quot;to do&quot; lists, when i came across some interesting pages from the <br/>
past, before i pulled my son out of school (which was just after he <br/>
turned 7, he&#39;s now 10.) <br/>
<br/>
I found two notes i wrote to seamus(which we would sometimes do if <br/>
we were fighting and not communicating well.) One said: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;To Seamus, I do not have to work for three days. You do not have to <br/>
go to school for 3 days. We can sleep late. It will be fun. Love <br/>
your mother Katherine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other said: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;To Seamus, I am sorry I yell at you so much. I will try to talk <br/>
like a friend. Maybe I can write letters instead. Love, Mom.&quot; and <br/>
next to it in Seamus&#39; six or seven yr old handwriting he wrote &quot;YES&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On a different page, i had made an outline for what i wanted my life <br/>
to look like, my sort of life goals. Listed there was 1. Do foster <br/>
care/adoption 2. To stay home/homeschool 3. To have a clean, <br/>
organized home 4. To make friends/have hobbies/be involved in <br/>
community .  All stuff i&#39;m either doing or in the process of doing <br/>
now. <br/>
<br/>
And then on a different page was a big narrative about how i wanted <br/>
my life, what i pictured my perfect life to be...and at the very <br/>
bottom i wrote &quot;To be a good mom who doesnt yell.&quot; I haven&#39;t created <br/>
exactly the life i wrote down on the paper, but i&#39;ve come close. And <br/>
that last part, the most important part, i definitely have!<br/>
<br/>
Its amazing how MUCH my life has changed since 2003. I can barely <br/>
even remember that life. I had forgotten that i was such a yeller, i <br/>
had forgotten a bit how angry my child was, how mad at each other we <br/>
were all the time. Last night i &quot;yelled&quot; at Seamus. He had mentioned <br/>
earlier in the evening that he spilled his pop on his pants and so <br/>
had changed. I didnt think anything of it. When i went to go to bed <br/>
that night (we share the queen sized bed at my mom&#39;s when we&#39;re here)<br/>
there was this huge dark wet stain right in the middle. I started <br/>
into this whole lecture about why he didnt tell me that earlier, <br/>
that i didnt know it was all over the bed, now its too late to <br/>
wash/dry it,where the heck are we supposed to sleep?? I wasnt <br/>
yelling, but i was talking louder than i normally do. As soon as <br/>
those words were out, i realized i was wrong. I felt horrible, just <br/>
this big icky feeling. I can&#39;t believe that i used to parent that <br/>
way all the time! I guess i just lived with the icky feeling! So i <br/>
immediately apologized and told him i&#39;d go dig out another sheet in <br/>
the closet, and i remade the bed. No big deal. He apologized for not <br/>
being clearer, he said he really thought i knew, esp since i had <br/>
been in the room several times that evening. (He had a point there.)<br/>
The rest of our night was fine. Thats the extent of my yelling now, <br/>
and happens rarely. <br/>
<br/>
Usually life is just one big lovefest. My son (who was so angry when <br/>
he was younger that he could be physically violent, hurt me, damage <br/>
property)is such a peaceful, loving, empathetic,open kid. He must <br/>
say &quot;I love you!!!&quot; 20 times a day, at least. And i&#39;m not longer The <br/>
Mom that Yells. Indeed, he sometimes thanks me for being a great mom!<br/>
<br/>
Whats that line? &quot;You&#39;ve come a long way baby!&quot;<br/>

apologizing for yelling at my 3.5 yr. old son for spilling juice <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dont know if you have heard of &quot;The Secret&quot;...its kind of a big <br/>
fad right now, but alot of whats presented makes sense to me. They <br/>
say the exact same thing...to ask/expect what you WANT not what you <br/>
DONT want, because the universe will give you what you ask for, and <br/>
won&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; the &quot;dont&quot; part. It makes so much sense to me, because <br/>
its kind of like when we say &quot;Say yes to your kids&quot;...if you can&#39;t <br/>
read to your child until after you finish your phone call, you could <br/>
say &quot;No, not until i&#39;m off the phone&quot; or you could say &quot;Yes, as soon <br/>
as i&#39;m off the phone&quot;...one is negative, the other is positive. One <br/>
positive moment leads to another until before you know it your life <br/>
is so freakin&#39; positive you can hardly believe it. <br/>
<br/>
One of the people featured in &quot;The Secret&quot; was on Oprah, and he said <br/>
something like, &quot;Trying is failing with honor.&quot; He said something <br/>
like &quot;If you ask someone to dinner, and they say &quot;I&#39;ll try to make <br/>
it&quot; they arent going to be there. Don&#39;t try. Do it.&quot; What was it <br/>
that Yoda said? &quot;Do or do not, there is no try.&quot; I think this <br/>
relates directly to unschooling. Don&#39;t try to be a better (more <br/>
patient, more fun, more positive)mother...just do it. Right now. <br/>
This moment. I think it really can be that easy, once you make the <br/>
shift in mind set. I am no longer a parent who yells. I am no longer <br/>
a parent who spanks. That doesnt mean i don&#39;t ever slip up or make a <br/>
mistake, but yelling is so far down the list of reactions, and <br/>
spanking even further (like, not even on the list anymore!), i&#39;m not <br/>
sure how i got here other than just choosing to stop. Making a <br/>
choice to be a better parent. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344952604">I think that when I was trying to meet everyone&#39;s needs before those of our family I was always yelling, always frustrated, always late, always cranky.  Now that we are on OUR schedule, I have the patience to say yes, the patience to always answer a question, the patience always to look something up.  Always focus on the positive.  I tell my kids we always have a choice.  Choose positive.  It&#39;s easier.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758481973">I&#39;ve always said to my girls, &quot;what you put out you get back&quot;.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
used myself as examples when I yelled or was irritable with them.   <br/>
We&#39;d all get in a fuddle and I&#39;d say, &quot;see?  I put out anger and I  <br/>
got it right back&quot;.  The point is choosing sunshine over clouds, of  <br/>
choosing to feed the white wolves instead of the black ones (for  <br/>
those familiar with the Cherokee?? story of the grandfather and  <br/>
boy).  I have the audiobook of The Secret and it all made sense to me  <br/>
as well.  I also like What the Bleep do We Know.<br/>
<br/>
Today my little one told me she wants to go to the village to get  <br/>
balloons.  I don&#39;t want to go.  I am feeling irritable and angry.   <br/>
But rather than putting that anger on her I knelt down to eye level  <br/>
and just told her that I want to say yes right now, but my black  <br/>
wolves are growling inside and making me want to fight and be angry.   <br/>
I need a bit of time to be alone so I can make my white wolves  <br/>
stronger.  I can&#39;t promise to take you down today, but we will get  <br/>
you balloons.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is not a &quot;sure honey, let&#39;s go!&quot; answer, but there is  <br/>
progress here in that I didn&#39;t just blindly lash out at her, or make  <br/>
that horrid face as if they were ruining my life.  She listened and  <br/>
said &quot;OK, I&#39;ll go up to grandmas for a while so you can drink your  <br/>
tea&quot; and she left smiling and my other dreamlet came and gave me a  <br/>
spontaneous hug with a wonderful &quot;i love you mommy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not always at that &quot;Do now&quot; space, but I&#39;m very close.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561553424">I thought you might know of the Secret based on your post.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
studying the law of attraction for several years now ... I&#39;m just so <br/>
jazzed that my children get to grow up knowing that  they are powerful <br/>
creators and have any life they choose ...  it&#39;s very interesting <br/>
explaining the law of attraction and deliberate creation to children ....<br/>
<br/>
Another fascinating and wonderful feeling perspective is knowing that <br/>
our children attract what they are a vibrational match for.  So they <br/>
have attracted me as their mother who wants to give them freedom and a <br/>
spiritual view on life AND they have attracted their father who wants to <br/>
give them the practical view on life.<br/>
<br/>
This view completely shifts how I see different perspectives.  When my <br/>
father comes in concerned about my son not having enough routine in his <br/>
life, my son has attracted that energy.  He is seeking that ....  So <br/>
rather than seeing my father as interfering, I see that that energy has <br/>
been called forth and I can welcome it with love.  After connecting with <br/>
my own inner power, then I can decide if and what I want to shift.<br/>
<br/>
It really is a freeing thought and recognizes that our children are <br/>
equal beings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That may be for some families, but we have never had a problem with  <br/>
it.  At a very early age we started this metaphor as sunshine and  <br/>
clouds.   We talked about how we could choose, for the most part, to  <br/>
have sunshine on our flower or clouds.  When the clouds came we could  <br/>
make the decision to blow them away.  They &quot;got it&quot; right away and  <br/>
until they were 5 or so that&#39;s what we used.  With this metaphor they  <br/>
were able, at a very young age, to recognize what was happening and  <br/>
they would come to me and say &quot;i have clouds&quot; and together, all three  <br/>
of us would put our hands up to our mouths, take a deep breath, and  <br/>
blow the clouds away.  In doing this, they made the decision to be  <br/>
happier.  When I read the Native American story it really was just  <br/>
another way of saying the sunshine/cloud thing.  They &quot;got it&quot;  <br/>
immediately again and even try and show others how to use it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that analogies and metaphors are fine for people who can  <br/>
understand them, big or small.  Penelope, at 3 once said to me while  <br/>
cuddling down to sleep, that people&#39;s minds were like this room (it  <br/>
was dark except for the light shining through the open door and we  <br/>
were talking about people throwing garbage on the earth), that all  <br/>
they need to do (to learn to stop polluting) was open the door.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps metaphors and analogies can be handled just fine by little  <br/>
people BECAUSE of their clarity of mind.   Perhaps it is just another  <br/>
part of the home in which you grow up in.  If metaphors work at 3,  <br/>
like walking may work at 7 months for some and reading at 12 for  <br/>
others, then why not?  Sounds like your saying I should deprive them  <br/>
of the opportunity to learn about and ponder vague concepts when I  <br/>
can clearly see that they enjoy it.<br/>

It is great that you apologised, and great that you are yelling less. But <br/>
your progress might be even faster if you get to the root of what sounds <br/>
like an expectation about your ds&#39;s development. Older kids often feel the <br/>
need to regress when there is a new(ish) baby in the house. If that behavior <br/>
angers you, it might be worth getting to the bottom of that and finding the <br/>
hidden assumptions or fears feeding it.<br/>

wolves, white ones and black ones in particular. What is the truth about<br/>
wolves? Are the white ones always calm and centered and the black ones<br/>
always angry?<br/>

When I was little, my Dad really believed that black cats were bad luck. He<br/>
would stop the car and turn around in order to avoid crossing one&#39;s path. It<br/>
was years into my adulthood before I saw that black cats were black cats and<br/>
not symbols of something evil. We own one now, as he adopted us, and we have<br/>
had wonderful experiences with him...experiences that we wouldn&#39;t have if I<br/>
still thought he was a bad omen.<br/>

I&#39;m sure animal conservationists would have some great things to say about<br/>
black wolves.<br/>

I&#39;ve also put lids on drinks, lots of times.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has a sippy cup of sorts (the handle is a straw) that he still  <br/>
uses to drink by his computer, and he&#39;s twenty years old.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids are sick they get two tupperware cups with the sipper  <br/>
seals, but with a straw in the hole--one of water, one of juice.   <br/>
When theyw ere littler (like five, six) they would get a baby bottle  <br/>

Sometimes kids, even very analytical kids, will believe things we  <br/>
didn&#39;t know they believed, like that there&#39;s a giant in the sky.   <br/>
Jack and the Beanstalk giant.  But all of Christianity is based in  <br/>
part on the idea of a giant in the sky, so is it a bad belief?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Again I think much of this has to do with context.  Looking at the  <br/>
&quot;white wolf/ black wolf&quot; separately I could agree with this.  I can  <br/>
only speak from within the context of my family, which is what I know  <br/>
best.  We are all animal lovers here, especially of wolves.  Wolves  <br/>
are highly respected as well as the worm here.  In Greece the owl is  <br/>
considered bad luck.  My girls are growing up here and have heard  <br/>
others talk about the owls hooting outside their house (which, to  <br/>
them means somebody is going to die), but in their immediate  <br/>
environment, our home, we have no such thoughts and so we all love  <br/>
owls as much as wolves and worms.<br/>
<br/>
If I saw that they had suspicious thoughts about looking at a black  <br/>
wolf, or dark grey one, then I&#39;d probably be here asking about it and  <br/>
we&#39;d be discussing this Native American story in a completely  <br/>
different context.  If in our family I pushed the idea of good and  <br/>
evil means black and white, then I think we&#39;d be in a lot of trouble,  <br/>
and if my thinking was so limited then I doubt I would even consider  <br/>
unschooling, or even homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking feelings here.  It is pretty clear between my girls and  <br/>
I that our black, white, purple wolves are just ways to recognize  <br/>
feelings.  They haven&#39;t been very receptive yet to low frequency vs  <br/>
high frequency feelings.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll graduate to that later on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or not. From my own, adult, perspective, I can understand what you are <br/>
saying with the wolf metaphor pretty easily, but high/low frequency <br/>
feelings doesn&#39;t....um, resonate ;) with me. The one idea doesn&#39;t <br/>
really lead to the other - as would be implied by &quot;graduate&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 I think its more important to explore ways to communicate with your <br/>
dds about feelings than it is to expect them to adopt your personal <br/>
nomenclature. The metaphor you use right now is meaningful *because* <br/>
its a bridge to understanding - other metaphors may or may not be. The <br/>
understanding and communication are the important parts. <br/>
