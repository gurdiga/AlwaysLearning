&lt;&lt; Are there people who do believe that God&#39;s existence can be proved?  <br/>

to go do something that doesn&#39;t involve words for a while.  Laundry.  Yard. <br/>
<br/>
Much of theology in the Middle Ages involved attempts to prove God.<br/>
<br/>
The whole entirety of &quot;creation science&quot; is an attempt to prove the Bible <br/>
true, and if the Bible is true, God exists.   <br/>
<br/>
So yeah, Millions believe it&#39;s true and just needs the one simple proof.  <br/>
<br/>
And there are Christians who say they just know God is real because they feel <br/>
him in their heart.  There&#39;s a song about it.<br/>
