This is the seat we love.  It is really light, easy to move, comfortable<br/>
and reclines with the seat.  Good luck.  Anna<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975158910">When we needed to move our daughter out of her car set and into a booster <br/>
seat, we did a lot of research.  I felt best about the Britax line--was able <br/>
to find them locally (SLC), but I know they also have a web site.  The model <br/>
we bought works for children up to 100 pounds.  It&#39;s basically a <br/>
belt-positioning booster, and it&#39;s really easy to use (moving in and out of <br/>
the car, etc.)  Good luck, and I hope everyone&#39;s fine after the accident.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709396848">Mark is fine.  He and our brand new car and all of his musical equipment <br/>
was hit a few weeks ago as he was coming home from San Diago.  The car <br/>
and music equipment and Janene&#39;s booster were/are a total loss, so we <br/>
are, just two months after the last car buying adventure, again buying a <br/>
car.  Janene&#39;s booster seat cannot even be removed from the vehicle.  <br/>
However, was told that because Janene was not in it (thank the <br/>
goddesses) the car seat is not covered by insurance.  After much fuss by <br/>
me, they are covering it.  Can&#39;t think of worse logic.<br/>
