<div id="ygrps-yiv-146052631">So, Roxanna (and any others who want to contribute)--<br/>
<br/>
Keith my husband has agreed to go to a Harry Potter birthday party for a 13 <br/>
year old, and to go as Hagrid.  <br/>
<br/>
Problem is, he hasn&#39;t read the books.  Only seen the movie.  So I went <br/>
through with sticky notes and marked all the passages with or about Hagrid in <br/>
book one and half of two.  I can finish two and three today, and he can read <br/>
them tomorrow, and Sunday night is showtime.<br/>
<br/>
He has a long coat, but it&#39;s not really huge, but for $100 we can&#39;t spend <br/>
much on props and costumes.<br/>
<br/>
We can find a pink umbrella, I figure, but do any of you have suggestions for <br/>
aging it?  I was thinking generally scuffing it with sandpaper and maybe <br/>
spraying mud on it and then rinsing it off.  It can&#39;t look new and WalMartish.<br/>
<br/>
There will be 30 kids, it&#39;s in a banquet hall at a restaurant, the kids are <br/>
asked to dress student-like (shirts and ties) and entertainment and adults <br/>
are doing robes and hats.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably going in a long black dress and hat, to play recorder with, and <br/>
coach, &quot;Hagrid&quot; (I&#39;m writing him a couple of short bits--like he&#39;s going to <br/>
say that Professor Dumbledore was busy at a meeting of the Ministry of <br/>
Magic--oh, I shouldn&#39;t have said that--and had asked that Peter (the birthday <br/>
boy) preside over this meal, please, if he didn&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
We have a big plastic egg that a model dinosaur skeleton came in, and that <br/>
can be a dragon egg.<br/>
<br/>
We need other ideas that will be easy, prop-like, and might cover over <br/>
Keith&#39;s not knowing the whole book.<br/>
<br/>
I figure an escape speech should be pretty easy--trouble in the forest or <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to get The Tynkers, a phenomenal family of homeschooled kids (now <br/>
mostly not kids, young adults) who do magic, fire breathings close to time is <br/>
madness, but here&#39;s the deal:  The kid has a famous grandfather who&#39;s rarely <br/>
in town, who&#39;s going hunting this weekend, and will be back for the birthday <br/>
and then leave town again the next day for his job.  It&#39;s Senator Pete <br/>
Domenici.    So that&#39;s the window, and we need to get Hagrid ready.<br/>
<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know Keith and can&#39;t get to the pictures, he has a big <br/>
beard, and the picture doesn&#39;t show his waist-length hair.  It&#39;s not very <br/>
dark, but he was a theatre major in the days before he switched to math, and <br/>
he played a giant in Jack and the Beanstalk, so he can draw on that.   (Once <br/>
he went to a horse show, when he was 19 or so, and was sitting way up in the <br/>
top of the bleachers, and he said a little boy kept looking at him with huge <br/>
eyes and then looking away, and then he heard him whisper to the woman he was <br/>
with, &quot;Grandma--it&#39;s the *Giant.*&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
And...<br/>
Keith&#39;s not the greatest with accents.  <br/>
<br/>
What Monty Python sketches are specifically Yorkshire besides &quot;Every Sperm is <br/>
Sacred&quot;?  If we had our friend Helena here who&#39;s lived in and around York for <br/>
the past two years, she could coach him, but she&#39;s in London,  probably <br/>
losing her edge.<br/>

hold of some of the foil wrapped stuff I saw around town this Christmas, and<br/>
have him pass some out to each of the kids?  Or just to the birthday kid.<br/>
He also was known for carrying sausages and bits of cake.  Little Debbies to<br/>
the rescue?  <br/>
<br/>
If his coat doesn&#39;t have lots of pockets, I think it would be totally OK for<br/>
Hagrid to have sort of a hunting pouch type of thing (a big leather purse of<br/>
yours or from the thrift store), worn cross-wise across his chest.<br/>
<br/>
I think he wears a scarf around his neck too, in the movie.<br/>
<br/>
He also carried mice for the owls, so you could use those ugly little fur<br/>
mice that I saw at Walmark last night.<br/>
<br/>
When I saw Keith in person for the first time last April, I thought he was<br/>
Hagrid, in the flesh.  I&#39;m going to look through photos we took at our<br/>
Hogwarts day, and maybe post some to the group area, just for fun.<br/>

has a few, take some scrap fabric and sew<br/>
some pockets in the inside, lots of pockets.<br/>

times, and take out all sorts of things from<br/>
his pocket and put it in front of the person<br/>
that looks like he/she would be the most<br/>
annoyed at having different things placed in<br/>

money, wizzard money (chocolate coins in<br/>
different colors?), rocks and things like<br/>
that.<br/>

&lt;&lt;If his coat doesn&#39;t have lots of pockets, &gt;&gt;<br/>

We&#39;re adding more pockets, it has two big ones.  It&#39;s an overcoat he made for <br/>
a costuming class when he was in theatre long, long ago.  I wanted to dye it <br/>
black but he won&#39;t let me.  It&#39;s blue.<br/>
<br/>
He has a _perfect_ big leather bag (which he wears to SCA events, and he <br/>
carries a recorder, a light cloth hood, a little tray and a spoon and a <br/>
drinking horn, so he&#39;s used to getting in and out of it gracefully, in a <br/>
relative manner of speaking).  Yes, leather pouches we have in abundance, and <br/>
thanks for the suggestion.<br/>
