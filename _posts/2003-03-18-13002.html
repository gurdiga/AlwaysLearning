Manga Sales Just Keep Rising by Heidi MacDonald -- 3/17/2003<br/>
News &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Manga publishers scramble to meet a steady rise in demand<br/>
<br/>
Manga continues to be one of the hottest categories in bookstores, and <br/>
publishers are responding to the demand with both new product<br/>
and new marketing tools. Manga, like Japanese anime before it, is <br/>
gradually evolving from a hard-core cult obsession to the kind of<br/>
mainstream phenomenon that teens and young adults adopt as their own.<br/>
<br/>
The strength of manga&#39;s appeal becomes apparent when you consider that <br/>
most of the top-selling books are printed in the original<br/>
Japanese right-to-left format. Not only do readers have to relearn how <br/>
to read comics, they have to relearn how to read a book. But<br/>
the audience has not been intimidated, and more publishers are going to <br/>
what is being called the &quot;authentic Japanese&quot; format, which<br/>
has been aggressively championed by Tokyopop.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Horse, a longtime American publisher of manga, has traditionally <br/>
reversed film in order to offer Western-style left-to-right<br/>
editions. Dark Horse v-p of sales and marketing Michael Martens confirms <br/>
the company&#39;s change to the right-to-left format, although<br/>
series already started in the left-to-right format will stay that way.<br/>
<br/>
Although relatively new, Tokyopop manga titles are dominating the weekly <br/>
Bookscan charts. Steve Kleckner, v-p of sales and marketing<br/>
at Tokyopop, reports that sales doubled last year, and he expect them to <br/>
double again this year as title output increases from 300<br/>
to 500. Dark Horse enjoys steady sales from a line of proven classics, <br/>
such as Astro Boy, Akira, Ghost in the Shell and Lone Wolf<br/>
and Cub, which has over half a million copies of its 20 volumes in print.<br/>
<br/>
Viz, which pioneered manga in the American market, recently underwent a <br/>
reorganization after being acquired by Shueisha, publisher<br/>
of Shonen Jump, the biggest manga magazine in Japan. The American <br/>
version of Shonen Jump was launched ambitiously last year, and has<br/>
sold well on newsstands.<br/>
<br/>
Viz v-p of marketing Liza Coppola points out that the audience is often <br/>
highly educated about products that haven&#39;t even made it to<br/>
America yet. She noted, &quot;These are fans that know exactly what they <br/>
want. As soon as the property is announced, they know when it&#39;s<br/>
coming.&quot; Viz&#39;s plan for the coming year include a line of Shonen Jump <br/>
graphic novels, spun off from the magazine and featuring such<br/>
franchise characters as Yu-Gi-Oh and Dragonball Z. This summer, Viz will <br/>
launch the cult favorite Excel Saga. Overall, Viz is<br/>
de-emphasizing monthly periodical comics in favor of graphic novels and <br/>
the house has reduced the prices on its graphic novels to<br/>
$7.95, to be more competitive with Tokyopop. (Dark Horse is also <br/>
bringing down prices, although not much below $13.95.)<br/>
<br/>
Raijin launched last year with a weekly comics magazine featuring more <br/>
boy-oriented fare. While sales to specialty stores for Raijin<br/>
magazine remain modest, the revamped graphic novel treatment of Fist of <br/>
the Northstar , which is serialized in the magazine, has<br/>
found success in bookstores and more graphic novels are planned. Success <br/>
breeds imitation. Marvel, Image and DC have also jumped<br/>
into the fray with projects ranging from Marvel&#39;s recently announced <br/>
Tsunami line (News, Feb. 3) to DC&#39;s American manga edition of<br/>
Kia Asamiya&#39;s Batman: Child of Dreams.<br/>
<br/>
This year, manga publishers are moving in all sorts of directions. Dark <br/>
Horse just launched Man-Machine Interface, the eagerly<br/>
awaited sequel to the bestselling 1995 Ghost in the Shell. DH is <br/>
introducing Metropolis, Lost World and Future World by Osamu<br/>
Tezuka, the legendary manga artist known as the &quot;Walt Disney of Japan.&quot; <br/>
Beyond that, DH has several new licenses about to be signed,<br/>
many of them already well known in the United States from either video <br/>
anime releases or live-action films. DH is also developing<br/>
manga versions of American comics, according to Martens.<br/>
<br/>
Kleckner ascribes the success of Tokyopop&#39;s manga line to strong <br/>
licenses, which include top sellers Chobits and Love Hina. &quot;I am<br/>
still amazed every week at how well the books are performing across the <br/>
board, not just with women but with males as well, and a lot<br/>
of that is the CLAMP stuff,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
CLAMP is a collective of women artists and writers who are responsible <br/>
for such hits on both sides of the Pacific as Chobits and<br/>
Cardcaptor Sakura. Later this year, Tokyo Pop will release CLAMP School <br/>
Detectives, Duklyon: CLAMP School Defenders and The Man of<br/>
Many Faces, all with various school settings. Tokyopop is also <br/>
publishing Battle Royale, a Lord of the Flies–like tale about<br/>
students competing to survive on an island; it&#39;s already created a <br/>
sensation in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Tokyopop&#39;s young-reader-friendly Cine-manga line of storyboard-style <br/>
(books made from images from the animated films) licensed books<br/>
recently added Disney&#39;s Kim Possible and Lizzie McGuire, and <br/>
Nickelodeon&#39;s Sponge Bob Square Pants and Jimmy Neutron to the lineup.<br/>
Kim Possible is already doing very well in bookstores, &quot;without any <br/>
display and without any promotions. It&#39;s just on the shelves,&quot;<br/>
Kleckner points out.<br/>
<br/>
The Cine-manga books are also being launched into Target and Wal-Mart <br/>
(one manga title, the epic fantasy Rave Master , is also being<br/>
introduced into Target); Kleckner views the move as experimental. And <br/>
Tokyopop is looking at other nontraditional outlets, said<br/>
Kleckner, &quot;retail places that never carried books before, but that <br/>
appeal to young customers, like video game dealers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although manga is a hot category, it still hasn&#39;t reached mass market <br/>
numbers. &quot;We&#39;re not going to scare John Grisham, but the<br/>
numbers are really solid,&quot; said one marketing executive. But returns <br/>
continue to be phenomenally low. &quot;Our sell-through has been<br/>
really good,&quot; said Martens at Dark Horse. Tokyopop&#39;s returns are about <br/>
8%, which suggests there may not be enough product on the<br/>
shelves. &quot;My goal,&quot; said Kleckner, &quot;is double-digits in returns.&quot; &quot;We <br/>
need to demystify the category,&quot; said Martens. &quot;It&#39;s a format,<br/>
not a genre.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And while librarians have been very receptive, Martens noted, he and <br/>
Kleckner emphasized that are still some doubters. &quot;I still run<br/>
into a lot of people in the book business who are convinced this is just <br/>
a fad and it&#39;s gong to go away in a year or so. How wrong<br/>
they are,&quot; said Kleckner, whose background includes many years in <br/>
electronics retail and the video game industry. He points to such<br/>
kids&#39; properties as Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh and noted that when one fad <br/>
fades, another takes its place. &quot;It&#39;s like video games—do you<br/>
think there isn&#39;t going to be a another hot racing game in a year? This <br/>
is not going away.&quot;</div>
