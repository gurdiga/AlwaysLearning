<div id="ygrps-yiv-288603886">I&#39;ve put up several new pages on my website, and have added a speaking <br/>
engagement, but I&#39;ve been increasingly self-conscious about saying even on a list <br/>
like this &quot;I have a new page, go look!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve made a list for updates and announcements.  It will just be an <br/>
occasional e-mail with &quot;what&#39;s new&quot; for those who have sometimes gone to my site and <br/>
seen what a rabbit-warren maze it is.<br/>
<br/>
You can send an e-mail to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sandradodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">sandradodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Or go to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/</a><br/>
<br/>
Not all the new pages are things by me.  Lots of times they&#39;re great &quot;typical <br/>
days&quot; of other families, or something profoundly insightful someone has <br/>
posted at the unschooling.com forum, or this list or unschoolingdiscussion.   Lots <br/>
of good stuff, but I don&#39;t want to jam this list with stuff that&#39;s only of <br/>
interest to a few.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
