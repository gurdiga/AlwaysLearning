<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855067810">&lt;&lt;My kids&#39; lives are So far from that it&#39;s hard to imagine how it must feel <br/>
(compared to me as a younger kid).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yea.  When Sorscha and I go to Starbucks or whatever, she&#39;ll say, &quot;Get me my <br/>
usual.&quot;   We also hang out with mostly radically unschooled kids.  If they <br/>
are with us, they&#39;ll just chime up with their choices also.  It&#39;s <br/>
cool~~~It&#39;s normal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had guest over a few weeks ago - A traditional, religious, school family. <br/>
It was weird because I forgot how many rules some kiddos have.  Here are a <br/>
few:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No you can&#39;t go on the trampoline because there is no net - NO not even if <br/>
only one goes at a time OR I stand and watch.<br/>
<br/>
No you can&#39;t have soda or ice cream (we have a kid cabana where ice creams, <br/>
soda&#39;s, and waters are there for the kids&#39; takings).<br/>
<br/>
No you can&#39;t run in the water on the lawn while it&#39;s being irrigating.<br/>
<br/>
No you can&#39;t have another piece of cake.<br/>
<br/>
No you can&#39;t throw a soda bomb (the kids are each allowed to throw one soda <br/>
bomb when they&#39;re here).<br/>
<br/>
No you can&#39;t ride the scooter or the bike because you don&#39;t have your helmet <br/>
(we have a long driveway and the yard is completely fenced.  No downhill or <br/>
anything).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
During the BBQ I had asked the kids to next time try and go in one of the <br/>
back doors because there were old rugs to catch the mud and dirt there <br/>
(instead of it going directly onto the wood floor at the front door). <br/>
Sorscha was already in the front door and said, &quot;Okay.&quot;  The other two kids <br/>
stopped and then walked completely around the house to go in the other door. <br/>
The mom said, &quot;Well at least MY kids listen.&quot;  I remember thinking to myself <br/>
that it so odd to see someone go completely around the house when they were <br/>
already walking in a door.  Just odd, kind of like a programmed robot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So later I was cleaning up and I found something interesting.  We just had <br/>
our home restuccod so it&#39;s all bright and happy cream.  I found mud balls <br/>
thrown at the house and all our little plant plaques dug up from the garden. <br/>
I smiled to myself thinking, &quot;Hmmm, those little robots are not as <br/>
programmed as one thinks they are. It&#39;s kind of like one of those movies <br/>
where the robots find out they have power & choices and eventually, well, <br/>
you know.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-860404005">This is long and starts with a quote and it won&#39;t hurt my feelings if  <br/>
people skip it all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-No you can&#39;t go on the trampoline because there is no net - NO not  <br/>
even if<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

helmet<br/>
(we have a long driveway and the yard is completely fenced. No  <br/>
downhill or<br/>
anything).-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That whole list made me sad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had religious homeschoolers staying with us for several days one  <br/>
winter a dozen and some years ago.  The mom and I were both in the  <br/>
SCA (well both whole families were) and she was my student (Laurel  <br/>
apprentice, for those who know the structure and the lingo), though  <br/>
they lived in another kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
I kept hoping she would understand that the same way she was learning  <br/>
all kinds of arts, and doing all kinds of research for fun, that her  <br/>
kids could learn in that same way.  But she had a full-on double  <br/>
standard, and was very (very) controlling.<br/>
<br/>
I could write a long list of stunning things as evidence of the  <br/>
problems with what they were doing, but I will tell this one story,  <br/>
which was triggered by the report of the mom having said &quot;Well at  <br/>
least MY kids listen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The kids had crayons and our box of coloring books, which included  <br/>
books of mazes and puzzles, and little-kid workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Holly came and asked me to read the directions to her, on some  <br/>
matching page.   I said something like &quot;Draw a red line from  <br/>
[whatever to whatever],&quot; or whatever it was---red X, or circle with  <br/>
red.  She asked me if it needed to be red, and I said no, it didn&#39;t  <br/>
even need to be a circle (I wish I could remember the quote; sorry).   <br/>
She and one of the other family&#39;s little girls ran off happily to  <br/>
work that page.<br/>
<br/>
When they were a little ways away (at least it wasn&#39;t right in front  <br/>
of Holly), the mom said snootily something like &quot;We expect our  <br/>
children to learn to follow the directions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So for me, if Holly wanted to do the counting or sound-matching or  <br/>
WHATever was the theme of that workbook page, that was fine, and if  <br/>
she did it wrong, that was fine.  For the other family, if a workbook  <br/>
said to use red, THAT was the important thing.  To follow the  <br/>
directions.<br/>
<br/>
This was not a good SCA match for my beliefs about learning and doing  <br/>
and being.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That couple ended up divorced, the kids dividing their time, the  <br/>
parents bitter and mean, the mom living with a man, posing  <br/>
suggestively on a motorcycle on a webpage...      It&#39;s been a long  <br/>
time.  I&#39;ve lost touch with them.  Their certain knowledge that they  <br/>
were doing things the only right way, God&#39;s way, and that it would  <br/>
guarantee a good outcome for their daughters was shot to hell.   <br/>
Meanwhile, our kids grew up in an intact family, more concerned about  <br/>
being thoughtful and resourceful than in using the right color in a  <br/>
cartoony workbook.<br/>
<br/>
Today is Keith&#39;s birthday.  He is &quot;thirty and a Kirby.&quot;  Kirby will  <br/>
be 22 on the 29th, so Keith is 52.  Keith was 20 when I met him, 21  <br/>
when we were first involved.  We have been told Kirby would grow up  <br/>
wild and awful.  He did not.  We&#39;ve been told our kids would never  <br/>
get jobs.  They&#39;ve all had jobs and their employers gush about them.<br/>
<br/>
Holly will be housesitting next weekend, for friends who have in the  <br/>
past hired Kirby or Marty to housesit, but neither of them is going  <br/>
to be in town, so Holly inherits the job.  Probably her boyfriend  <br/>
Brett will be over there with her.  Many parents would criticize us  <br/>
for that, but screw &#39;em.  She&#39;ll be safer with Brett there, and less  <br/>
bored, and if there are any problems with the three dogs, or the  <br/>
neighbors, or the guy who has come to steal guns there twice (the  <br/>
guns are all very locked up now, but still...), I&#39;d really rather  <br/>
Holly not be there alone.<br/>
<br/>
Holly will leave the house cleaner than she found it, the dogs will  <br/>
have fun, she&#39;ll have her computer there, and will watch their DVDs  <br/>
on the big TV and water their bushes and probably call me two or  <br/>
three times a day.  She can come home in the daytime, as long as  <br/>
she&#39;s there from 6:00 to feed dogs and keep lights and noise in the  <br/>
house at night.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course, not many sixteen year olds could be trusted with a  <br/>
situation like that, but my kids have nothing to be sneaky about, and  <br/>
are not destructive and they are thoughtful and careful and  <br/>
responsible.  That&#39;s not accident or coincidence.  It&#39;s because each  <br/>
of them (at 16) had had sixteen years of exploration of the world  <br/>
without a bunch of rules and punishments and restrictions and limits  <br/>
and shame.  They&#39;ve heard yes a lot more than they&#39;ve heard no, and  <br/>
so they are full of &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;Yes, I can do that.&quot;  They are  <br/>
confident and generous.<br/>

   <br/>
  Ok sorry these comments are kinda off topic of the original subject but a ton of trampoline injuries are from hitting the net wrong. I cringe when my kids get on a tramp with a net.<br/>
   <br/>
  and ...I find it soo kewl to run into another Sorsha .....my youngest godchild is Sorcha.:)<br/>
