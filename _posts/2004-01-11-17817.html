&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me<br/>
bows to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones,<br/>
our tired feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a<br/>
dimension that is more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the<br/>
&#39;trappings and the suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where<br/>
there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39; and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all<br/>
that, a space for the eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>
