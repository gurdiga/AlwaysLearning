Michelle and some other therapists, counsellors and coaches are listed here.  They&#39;re all very familiar with unschooling, so you won&#39;t need to spend any time explaining THAT part of your life. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873670130">I&#39;ll second the recommendation to this book. I know moms who have used this book to work out issues with their kids, among other things. A couple of years ago, I went to a women&#39;s retreat designed around the principles and exercises in this book and found working in small groups very useful, so you might try setting up a book group with some friends to discuss it together.<br/>
