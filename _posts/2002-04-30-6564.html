If a black guy living in a black neighborhood were beaten up by that bunch<br/>
of black teens, he&#39;d be in the same position as the first example. He&#39;d have<br/>
had lots of prior experience with a variety of black teens so his experience<br/>
with one bad bunch wouldn&#39;t be extended to them all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If my sister were raped by a marine in uniform, I might or might not hold it <br/>
against all marines, depending in part how many other marines I knew.  I <br/>
would expect my sister to twinge when she saw uniformed marines for a while <br/>
afterward.<br/>
<br/>
She was raped, but not by a marine.  I&#39;m declining to say by what manner of a <br/>
person.  Some people might have a prejudice fanned by it, for not having been <br/>
around those kinds of people much.  <br/>
<br/>
People here who are, have been, have dads who were Marines might be offended <br/>
by my non-true example.<br/>
<br/>
My brother in law was in prison once, for a very short while, for a drug <br/>
charge for which he was put out of the SEALS, when they had been in Cambodia <br/>
and VietNam when they should not really have been there.  His whole <br/>
squad/group/company/whatever packs navy seals come in was scattered hither <br/>
and yon suddenly, and he was in a prison in Florida where he met and had <br/>
certain relationships with Black men which he had never had before.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t much like Black men at all now.  Unfair?  Perhaps so.  Unfair that he <br/>
was sent to prison for smoking dope (victimless crime) after what the <br/>
military had been having him do in the same time frame?  Am I prejudiced <br/>
against covert military operations?  Unfair?<br/>

was that only other people&#39;s heads?<br/>
<br/>
There are emotional prejudices as opposed to<br/>
intellectual ones and then there actual physical<br/>
memories that have responses unrelated to any<br/>
conscious thinking. Such a flinching away from a<br/>
remembered pain source.  A new response can be<br/>
learned, such a  curtailing the flinch, but it will<br/>
still be there. That is not a prejudice. And<br/>
curtailing the flinch is merely polite (depending).<br/>
