[Now, I won&#39;t call you LAZY for not looking them up yourself, sometimes<br/>
people need to get a handle on learning on their own. ;) ]<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmmmmmm, first time, I think was reading historical fiction. _The<br/>
Crystal Cave_ by Mary Stewart, one of my favorite retellings of the<br/>
Merlin myth. I&#39;ve always been fascinated with the idea of sophisticated<br/>
Roman Villas replaced by crude, cold, damp, uncomfortable castles. I<br/>
should be fair, there was quite a climate change in that period...<br/>
