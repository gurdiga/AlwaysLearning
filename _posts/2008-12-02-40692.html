<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295729095">3. Bring the world to your children and your children to the world.  <br/>
Revel in what brings you together as a family. Watch tv and movies  <br/>
and listen to music and the radio. Laugh together, cry together, be  <br/>
shocked together. Analyze and critique and think together about what  <br/>
you experience. Notice what your child loves and offer more of it,  <br/>
not less. What IS it about particular shows that engage your childï¿½ <br/>
build on that. Don&#39;t operate out of fear. Think for yourself and  <br/>
about your own real child. Don&#39;t be swayed by pseudostudies done on  <br/>
school children.<br/>
