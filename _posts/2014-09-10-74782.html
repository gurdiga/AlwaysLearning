<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, we have continued to have problems with food and Alexander has slowly gained weight all year.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think one problem is that you think it&#39;s a problem with food. <br/>
<br/>
I think the 2nd problem is that instead of seeing your son as a symptom of what&#39;s going on, you&#39;re seeing him as the problem that needs fixed. You&#39;re asking -- even if not directly -- for ways to fix him. <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s coming through in your writing is stress. If you&#39;re stressed, your child will be stressed. Stress is a factor in asthma. Stress can cause eating. Not just because food is soothing but because stress cranks up the body&#39;s craving for calories. I once spent a very stressful day getting into Boston traffic court to fight a speeding ticket. Normally I can eat 2 pieces of a large pizza and regret a 3rd ;-) That night I ate 4 and wasn&#39;t stuffed! Your body craves fuel when it&#39;s stressed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible -- and I&#39;m guessing at this from various clues -- that the body isn&#39;t just craving calories to burn but to store. It&#39;s gearing the body up for whatever big event that has the body so worked up with stress.<br/>
<br/>
Focusing on his weight will cause more stress. It will feel like he&#39;s the cause of your stress when he isn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Breathing. Meditation. Yoga. Tai Chi. If you can find programs (on DVD) that are fun for kids, invite him along. Don&#39;t make him. Just approach the practices with joy and invite him to join you.<br/>
<br/>
I would say focus on getting the bulk of your meals and snacks more healthy. Don&#39;t bring sweets into the house unless he asks specifically. And you can make sweet things with him like whole grain banana muffins, fruit smoothies. Having some fat in with the sweet will slow the digestion down so he won&#39;t feel hungry so quickly. Explore with him to find foods he will find satisfying. If you have the ability to grow even a container garden, kids are often drawn to food they can pick and eat that they wouldn&#39;t normally eat from the store.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The steady build up of asthma and allergy symptoms (tomatoes and dust as well as egg) have made him less and less active.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kind of active things are you and your wife doing with him?<br/>
<br/>
Walks in the woods. Climbing over rocks. Playing ball on the beach. Most parents can take their kid to the park and let him go! :-) Right now while he&#39;s finding it difficult to be active, doing more active things *with* you will help.<br/>
<br/>
A dog might help. As long as you get some good advice on one that has the right personality for your child :-) Dogs can help with stress. They can help with exercise. As long as you can find ways *not* to stress over walking and other care. Make it a joyful time to be together. The more you make it a pleasant time, the less he&#39;ll say no.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re saying about the banana and wait 10 minutes and chewing on ice sound like good ideas. Steering kids towards other options is good as long as they still do have their original choice available. Just like anyone, kids can get stuck on one thing that&#39;s partially soothing. So it&#39;s hard to not reach for that soothing thing when you&#39;re stressed. Helping him to explore other options that might work better while not forbidding what he finds soothing is useful.<br/>

Make lots of yummy foods that fill up and are not super high calories. <br>Make sure he is getting some protein and fat ( not just sugar /carbohydrates ) to balance his blood sugar and hunger.<br>When I was a little girl ( and not overweight ) I was hungry&nbsp; and ate A LOT!.<br>Feeling guilty about eating one more banana and focusing on weight would have me thinking of food 24 hours a day and feeling guilty most of those hours. Plus I am sure I would sneak food because I really did feel hungry.<br></span></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495" clear="none"></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Here
 are my best guesses on why he has gained weight. &nbsp;The asthma has been 
creeping up on him for a year, the same length of time his weight has 
been increasing. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think that is a coincidence. &nbsp;The steady build
 up of asthma and allergy symptoms (tomatoes and dust as well as egg) 
have made him less and less active.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Could be. Less active more weight gain but I don;t think more weight gain more asthma.&nbsp; <br>The relationship between being active and less asthma is that people who have a better cardiovascular system and a more develop lungs can oxygenate their blood better. So even if you still have asthma your body is able to use and get more oxygen. I hope I am explaining that right!<br><br>That is why kids with asthma were told to do swimming!<br><br><br></span></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495" clear="none"></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495"><span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-579118495">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;He
 often struggles to manage and cope with sensory stimulation levels, 
which is not generally a problem because we can adjust things to meet 
his needs but he seeks oral stimulation a lot.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Gums? xylitol gums( good for teeth and low calorie and still sweet)?<br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp; He is also rather 
emotionally sensitive and eats to buffer transitions and to manage 
anxiety. &nbsp;I offer cups of ice chips, sensory chews and frozen teething 
rings preemptively to try to satisfy his need for icy things and things 
to chew. &nbsp;Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. &nbsp;He can&#39;t, for 
instance, &nbsp;cope with getting on a train without eating. &nbsp;I carry a 
banana and nobody makes a big deal of it.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Frozen bananas would be great! Frozen grapes! Carrots ( very chewy ! ).&nbsp; Less stress.

 have spoken to my son about the need for him to lose weight and 
explained that to lose weight he needs to eat fewer high energy foods. 
&nbsp;He very badly wants his asthma to be better. &nbsp;But he is four and very 
often chooses to eat sweets. &nbsp;We are, reluctantly, saying no sometimes 
when he wants sweets. &nbsp;This does not feel good or right and it is 
causing distress. &nbsp;But it also feels irresponsible to allow him to eat 
sweets several times a day when the consequences of him not losing 
weight would be so serious. &nbsp;Please help me see more choices.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>It is a HUGE burden to a 4 year old child to think about weight and their illness/condition.<br>He should not be&nbsp; even thinking about&nbsp; weight gain at all!. <br>Go ahead and cook healthy meals. model. offer great low cal and fulfilling snacks but I am going to tell you that eating and feeling guilty about it is the worse thing&nbsp; ever. I know because I felt it.<br><br>I remember the first time my mom talked about eating and getting fat and how you always have to be on a diet or you will be fat.

 are my best guesses on why he has gained weight. &nbsp;The asthma has been 
creeping up on him for a year, the same length of time his weight has 
been increasing. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think that is a coincidence. &nbsp;The steady build
 up of asthma and allergy symptoms (tomatoes and dust as well as egg) 
have made him less and less active.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br clear="none"><br clear="none">Could be. Less active more weight gain but I don;t think more weight gain more asthma.&nbsp; <br clear="none">The relationship between being active and less asthma is that people who have a better cardiovascular system and a more develop lungs can oxygenate their blood better. So even if you still have asthma your body is able to use and get more oxygen. I hope I am explaining that right!<br clear="none"><br clear="none">That is why kids with asthma were told to do swimming!<br clear="none"><br clear="none"><br clear="none"></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-291922740yiv2038064909" style=""><span class="ygrps-yiv-291922740yiv2038064909" style=""><br class="ygrps-yiv-291922740yiv2038064909" style="" clear="none"></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-291922740yiv2038064909" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span class="ygrps-yiv-291922740yiv2038064909" style="">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;He

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077565965"><div dir="ltr"><br><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra">Both of my daughters have asthma and their dad has asthma (which means I have been supporting people I love with their asthma for over twenty years). My youngest (now 7) was hospitalized twice (once right before she turned two and again a few months afterwards). They are both on daily maintenance inhalers (which means they need to use them every day to keep their asthma under control). <br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra">Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned:<br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra">If your child requires daily maintenance, then it is extremely important, BUT there are different medications and some work better for others. My oldest tried two different daily medications before finding one that worked well enough to control her asthma (to her doctors, &quot;control&quot; means using her rescue inhaler less than once a week). <br><br>It wasn&#39;t until she saw an allergist that I even knew there were different kinds of daily medication. As soon as she switched to the one that worked for her, her asthma was immediately better. But the medication that didn&#39;t work for oldest works fine for my youngest.<br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra">There are different things that can trigger asthma issues. When my kids&#39; dad lived with us, he had to leave the house before I could vacuum. My kids&#39; asthma can be triggered by pollen, weather changes, seasons, pets, and colds.<br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra">Finding a way to help your son manage his asthma (and at this age, it is really you managing it, not him) in a peaceful, relaxed way is really important. My kids use a spacer, which I&#39;m told is very important. Some models just have a mouthpiece, but theirs covers their nose and mouth, which helps ensure the medicine is getting into their lungs. I also have them take five deeps breaths every time they use it. And we decorated it with stickers.<br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra"><br><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra">Gwen<br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_extra"><div class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_quote"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-2077565965gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div><div style="color:white;clear:both;"><span></span><br><div><span></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Now

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419327370">Paul Lam got a lot of good reviews on Amazon. He has his first instructional DVD for free on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/hIOHGrYCEJ4">http://youtu.be/hIOHGrYCEJ4</a><br/>
<br/>
It was sometimes hard to tell what the feet were doing or when to breathe but he has a clear voice and goes slowly.<br/>
<br/>
The one I like better is Scott Cole Discover Tai Chi Am-Pm Workouts. (Which is easier than his Beginning Tai Chi video.) All the moves are traditional -- at least they have traditional names ;-) -- but the 2 routines are easier than Paul Lam&#39;s. It&#39;s more focused on relaxation rather than traditional forms.<br/>
<br/>
The Tai Chi is nice and slow. There&#39;s an instructional part but the moves are pretty simple.<br/>
<br/>
The 2 meditations are nice too. It&#39;s sort of yoga and meditation.<br/>
<br/>
I know you said your budget is tight but there are some 3rd party sellers selling it pretty cheaply.<br/>

    my son was 29 kilos a year ago, when he was 4.5 years old. he is
    taller than the average 4 or 5 year old but on the weight chart his
    weight was not even written. so he was overweight considering all
    standards. and he always was, since birth. <br>
    <br>
    he was very active - physically, beautiful and extremly healthy. <br>
    <br>
    now he is 5.5, lost several kilos and is suddenly just the right
    weight for his height. he is still very active, beautiful and
    healthy. <br>
    <br>
    try to keep &quot;the weight issue&quot; out of the &quot;issue-box&quot;. he has
    asthma, that is an illness. being considered something by someone is
    not. <br>

              regularly, insisted that his recent weight gain was not
              because of steroids and tried to tell me that activity
              levels have nothing to do with weight. Â She was not

              Â Putting an encasement on the mattress made a dramatic
              difference overnight. Â And the preventer meds seem to be
              working now. Â We are getting the help we need to unpick
              Alexander&#39;s triggers and understand how his asthma effects
              him. Â I don&#39;t think his weight is the biggest exacerbating

              chasing, swimming and play fighting. Â Huge nurf gun
              fights!. Â His trampoline and space hopper are very popular
              and we love to sing and dance together. Â Even gaming isn&#39;t

              and big strong vigorous movement is an area of joy, not
              anxiety. Â The drop in his activity levels was quite
              gradual and with hindsight it makes more sense in the

            <div>I am going to keep losing weight and managing asthma

            <div><br>

            <div>No, he does not always overeat. Â And the stomach pain

              overeating. I was being unfair. That&#39;s fear and muddy
              thinking talking. Â He overeats when he senses stress and
              anxiety from us. Â He overeats when I offer him food
              because I am feeling anxious, when I confuse love and
              sugar, and always when there is disapproval and attempts
              to control and limit food. Â Also when he is bored or
              understimulated. Â None of that is good and none of it is

            <div><br>
            </div>
            <div>His issues with texture and strong flavours is real, as
              are his sensory cravings, but I suspect even that will
              improve as the anxiety ebbs. Â Hard to be adventurous with
              food when it feels so stressful to us all. Â I will stick
              to offering smaller portions but not tense up when he
              wants more. Â I think smaller portions are good because
              that supports him in eating mindfully. Â I think offering
              ice and chew stix and low calory bulky grazing foods are
              good. Â </div>
            <div><br>
            </div>
            <div>When my wife struggled to let go of control over tooth
              brushing and hair washing, I helped her. Â When I got
              stressed about Alexander not wanting to socialize with
              other kids, she talked me through it and settled me down.
              Â Food is the hang up we share, and so we aren&#39;t helpful to
              each other. Â Thank you for helping us both and giving us
              so many fresh good ideas. Â I am grateful to this list
              every day, but never more than today.</div>

 was not helpful and it has ramped up my stress levels quite a lot to have that medical voice in my head. &nbsp;Your calm words are helping me turn away from that. &nbsp;</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">Dust is the biggest trigger, &#39;though food allergies, pollen and pet dander are probably playing a part. &nbsp;Putting an encasement on the mattress made a dramatic difference overnight. &nbsp;And the preventer meds seem to be working now. &nbsp;We are getting the help we need to unpick Alexander&#39;s triggers and understand how his asthma effects him. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think his weight is the biggest exacerbating factor and I also think fitness if far more important than weight to health generally and asthma particularly, but there is a great deal of hysteria in the medical profession about overweight and obesity and we are going to keep hearing about his weight. It was wrong of us to let our fears
 about medical intervention be our focus and to let that lead us back in the wrong direction. &nbsp;</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">His weight is very much a symptom of our anxiety. &nbsp;Our focus needs to be on shedding the anxiety and moving in a better direction again. &nbsp;We will find tai chi videos on youtube and I do not doubt that Alexander will want to join us. &nbsp;That sounds like a lot of fun. &nbsp;Mindfulness speaks very strongly to Alexander and he enthusiastically employs calm deep breathing and being fully in the present moment to help him with all sorts of daily situations like crossing the road, getting to sleep and going to the toilet. &nbsp;It really works for him.</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">We aren&#39;t as much of a mess as this tangle makes us sound. &nbsp;Or maybe we are, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.
 Food is where we fall down. &nbsp;It&#39;s where we put our anxiety and stress. &nbsp;You are quite right to point out that we have not moved past our fears. &nbsp;We had come a long way but this has put us right back where we were a year ago. &nbsp;The change wasn&#39;t deep enough. &nbsp;If it had been true and solid and rooted in us we wouldn&#39;t have sprung back into this pit of food stress so quickly. &nbsp;</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">Now that his chest is not tight all the time he is becoming more active again and his fitness levels are increasing. &nbsp;We have always loved active games. &nbsp;Racing, chasing, swimming and play fighting. &nbsp;Huge nurf gun fights!. &nbsp;His trampoline and space hopper are very popular and we love to sing and dance together. &nbsp;Even gaming isn&#39;t sedentary. &nbsp;Nothing like trolling each other in minecraft or disney infinity and laughing hysterically to
 raise our heart rates and leave us proper breathless! &nbsp;Being active and big strong vigorous movement is an area of joy, not anxiety. &nbsp;The drop in his activity levels was quite gradual and with hindsight it makes more sense in the light of slowly building asthma symptoms. &nbsp;</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">I am going to keep losing weight and managing asthma off his radar. &nbsp;We need to go back to saying yes and offering lots of good things. &nbsp;</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">No, he does not always overeat. &nbsp;And the stomach pain may well have been because of allergy rather than overeating. I was being unfair. That&#39;s fear and muddy thinking talking. &nbsp;He overeats when he senses stress and anxiety from us. &nbsp;He overeats when I offer him food because I am feeling anxious, when I confuse love and sugar, and
 always when there is disapproval and attempts to control and limit food. &nbsp;Also when he is bored or understimulated. &nbsp;None of that is good and none of it is helped by trying to fix him. &nbsp;</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">His issues with texture and strong flavours is real, as are his sensory cravings, but I suspect even that will improve as the anxiety ebbs. &nbsp;Hard to be adventurous with food when it feels so stressful to us all. &nbsp;I will stick to offering smaller portions but not tense up when he wants more. &nbsp;I think smaller portions are good because that supports him in eating mindfully. &nbsp;I think offering ice and chew stix and low calory bulky grazing foods are good. &nbsp;</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">When my wife struggled to let go of control over tooth brushing and hair washing, I helped her.
 &nbsp;When I got stressed about Alexander not wanting to socialize with other kids, she talked me through it and settled me down. &nbsp;Food is the hang up we share, and so we aren&#39;t helpful to each other. &nbsp;Thank you for helping us both and giving us so many fresh good ideas. &nbsp;I am grateful to this list every day, but never more than today.</div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268"><br style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268" clear="none"></div><div style="" class="ygrps-yiv-1811838268">&nbsp;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634143678"><div dir="ltr">This is a trigger topic for me personally. My first response was less than gentle, but it was intended with kindness. :-)Â <div><br></div><div>I was raised in a mostly peaceful and very loving home, where (now, looking back, I see that) some people used food and alcohol compulsively. Someone was always trying to fix someone else, and that mentality persists in that home today. There was also a culture (I see now) of &quot;us&quot; vs them, of &quot;belonging&quot; in the family unit, of approval. We were encouraged to be independent and creative compared to our peers or society, but not disruptive to the family.Â </div><div><br></div><div>This made for a lovely, safe, happy childhood and it simultaneously created (in me, at least; I can&#39;t speak for my siblings) a struggle to succeed independently in young adulthood and a crippling need for approval from my parents. It was a major contributor to my early marriage and subsequent divorce in my twenties.Â </div><div><br></div><div>My mom asked me at age 8 if I would like to accompany her to Weight Watchers. I believe her intention was to &quot;teach&quot; me to be healthy and to &quot;be a good role model&quot;. It was presented as my choice. Of course I said yes! My parents made it clear that it was their job to guide me in my decisions, to keep me safe. If they saw something &quot;wrong&quot; with me, I intended to fix it, because I trusted that if it was important to them, it must be important. Most exciting events in my preteen years forward were preceded by a daydream of what size I would be when the event took place and full of calculations counting down the days and weeks divided by the number of pounds I needed to lose in order to be the &quot;real&quot; me by that time. And if I didn&#39;t achieve that &quot;goal&quot;, then I was a failure and the event didn&#39;t meet my high expectations.Â </div><div><br></div><div>My niece just turned 6 and weighs about 75 lbs. She has been off the charts in height, weight, and head circumference since birth. Her parents are both petite, but her maternal grandmother and great aunts are over 6ft tall and her great uncle is about 6&#39;6&quot;. She had a serious dairy/soy allergy until age 2, often woke every 45mins until she 3, vomits when emotionally upset, and has had a few seizures. Her parents are both schoolteachers by trade and constantly monitor in order to (IMO) diagnose her, create an action plan, and develop customized coping mechanisms. They swaddled her until she was 15mos old because they were so terrified of having a &quot;bad night&quot;. Then they wondered why she didn&#39;t walk until 21mos. They asked doctors at every appointment until she was 5, if they should be worried about her weight. The doctor said, &quot;not yet, not yet, not yet.&quot; Then, magically, at 5, it became an issue to keep tabs on, and they began trying to control the compulsive eating habit that they created! At family gatherings, she has at least 2 parents and 2 grandparents monitoring what she eats and reporting back to each other on what and how much she has had and whether she should be stopped from eating more. This is a girl who loves to run, jump on her trampoline, dance and socialize. She doesn&#39;t care nearly as much about what she&#39;s eating as to be included in the social act of eating because she recognizes that people connect with each other when they eat. It breaks my heart to watch anyone think they need to teach her anything about being a human - if they would only step back and *look at her*, there is so much *they* could learn *from her*.Â </div><div><br></div><div>Until recently, I was heavily involved in my family&#39;s business. I fought with my dad constantly, wondering why he didn&#39;t understand my perspective. And finally, I realized - he was reacting defensively, because every time I made a mistake (or succeeded in something he didn&#39;t agree with) he took it personally. He was so upset with himself for all those things he&#39;d been trying to fix about me for years and had failed. I cannot impart upon you how damaging this was to our relationship, how it inhibited my ability to grow professionally. I was not his project to fix - not when I was 8, or 18, or 36. My learning was my own business.Â </div><div><br></div><div>Deschooling is so much more than moving away from curriculum or grades or tests. It is about recognizing that you have a choice in every moment, and that you learn something *no matter which choice you make*. Unschooling works by removing the idea that learning happens in one choice but not the other, that learning can be caused by teaching. Becoming an expert *on one&#39;s self* and finding the power in healing one&#39;s self is the key to moving out of the way of another person&#39;s learning.Â </div><div><br></div><div>~Tara</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1634143678gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1634143678gmail_quote">On Wed, Sep 10, 2014 at 12:21 PM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...
