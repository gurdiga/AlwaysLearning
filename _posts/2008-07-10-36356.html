<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265220709">My 10 year old, Allison, told me she wished she was old enough to <br/>
drink wine.  I told her she was more than welcome to try the wine.  <br/>
She sipped it, didn&#39;t like it, and sighed.  After another minute or <br/>
so, she said she was bummed she couldn&#39;t use of those &quot;fancy <br/>
glasses&quot;.  It wasn&#39;t wine she wanted.  It was the fancy glass!  LOL  <br/>
The look on her face was priceless when I told her she could put any <br/>
liquid in that fancy glass.  She assumed they were for wine only <br/>
because that is the only thing my DH and I use them for.  I got them <br/>
during a promotion for Harlequin Romance novels many years ago.  <br/>
*ROFL*  Now even I&#39;m using them more often.  Water is easier to drink <br/>
when it comes in a fancy glass!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757491239">We did this recently with my dd and a sleepover she had with 5 other  <br/>
girls. I &quot;served&quot; them a fancy, for 8 yr olds anyhow, dinner complete  <br/>
with candles and juices of their choice in wine glasses. The were  <br/>
extatic!  I had as much fun as they did at our &quot; restaurant&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, well I always end up breaking our wine glasses on the kitchen<br/>
faucet!  So we drink wine out of mason jars, much hardier...<br/>
<br/>
I did notice, however, that wine glasses were very cheap at the thrift<br/>
store.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998850304">Depending on how sturdy they are you can serve pudding in them too!<br/>
<br/>
I know that you can make layered drinks and she might really like that <br/>
because they&#39;re pretty!<br/>
Here&#39;s one I found (Google non alcoholic drinks or mocktails and you&#39;ll <br/>
find lots of recipes for fancy drinks) It calls for a tall glass <br/>
because of the crushed ice but you could probably get it to layer in <br/>
the wine glasses.  The trick is in the pouring and having liquids of <br/>
different density:<br/>
<br/>
Azteca Sunburst<br/>
<br/>
1/2 oz. Maraschino cherry juice<br/>
1/2 oz. lime juice<br/>
6 oz. Pineapple juice<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fill tall glass with crushed ice.<br/>
Add cherry and lime juices. <br/>
Carefully pour pineapple juice into glass<br/>
making sure drink is<br/>
reddish on bottom and golden on top. <br/>
Garnish with<br/>
lime wheel or wedge and cherry.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a red, white and blue one..it uses diet soda which I think <br/>
tastes yucky but that&#39;s me.<br/>

You also might look on craigslist for teasets and find something pretty <br/>
and inexpensive for her.  My dds love using pretty tea cup/saucer sets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231295036">They&#39;re not as pretty - well I take that back some are just as pretty with &quot;bubbles in the plastic, swirls, and bright colors - but we had a set of plastic wine glasses for a while.  This is the perfect time of year for finding them in the patio / picnic / outdoor section <br/>
of stores.<br/>
<br/>
Zac had a special &quot;wine&quot; type glass that his grandmother sent him one year in his Halloween package - it was a skull and he loved loved loved that glass -<br/>
