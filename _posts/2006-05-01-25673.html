 </span></blockquote>this thread has had me thinking (remember beauty and<br/>
the beast? &quot;lefou I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve been thinking,&quot;<br/>
sings gaston; lefou replies, &quot;a dangerous pastime!&quot; <br/>
&quot;I know!&quot; sings gaston :D). sometimes it seems so<br/>
HARD, and I just can&#39;t think of what to strew... it&#39;s<br/>
a creativity thing, I think... as I was reading this<br/>
post, I thought, aha! it&#39;s Strewer&#39;s Block! once you<br/>
get unstuck it flows, at least for a while. probably<br/>
yet another reason I should stay on task with my<br/>
writing...<br/>
