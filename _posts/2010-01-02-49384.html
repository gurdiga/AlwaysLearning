<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282753904">It&#39;s been a busy morning.  I&#39;ve approved posts that were left in the  <br/>
queue by other moderators because they were questionable.  If you  <br/>
think some of today&#39;s posts maybe shouldn&#39;t have been let through, so  <br/>
do others.  Let that slide.<br/>
<br/>
One was returned for saying &quot;Thanks/good idea&quot; (basically) and  <br/>
appending a VERY long post.  Not good.<br/>
<br/>
One was returned for being a long unbroken piece of writing punctuated  <br/>
by streams of all caps.  Not good.<br/>
<br/>
Edit your own posts carefully before you send them.  Think about  <br/>
whether it&#39;s good for this list or not.   If you&#39;re not sure, you can  <br/>
read more about the list here and at the links from that page:<br/>
