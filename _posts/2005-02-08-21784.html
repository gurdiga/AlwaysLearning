<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783332073"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Or just make a plate of fruit and cheese and put it<br/>
&gt;in front of him - stop asking him so many questions.<br/>
&gt;If he doesn&#39;t WANT the fruit and <br/>
&gt;cheese, he can say so (I guess that means he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&#39;knows.&#39;)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Pam<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  My oldest (8 yrs) is high functioning<br/>
autistic, and when presented with too many choices, or<br/>
pressured to make a choice, he simply shuts down like<br/>
this too.  Even if he really does want something, he<br/>
says no (which I think is really a &quot;no&quot; directed at<br/>
feeling pressured) and then is upset because we didn&#39;t<br/>
give him the thing he really did want after all.  It<br/>
drives him as crazy as us, and it&#39;s not intentional at<br/>
all.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ask if he&#39;s hungry.  I just know him well<br/>
enough to know about what times to put his favorite<br/>
foods in front of him, as Pam said, with no pressure<br/>
or guilt if he doesn&#39;t want it, but he almost always<br/>
eats it.  Similarly, I don&#39;t ask if he wants a sweater<br/>
or coat before we go out, I simply take one of his<br/>
with us if he didn&#39;t put one on, and I put it near him<br/>
in the car.  If he gets cold, he puts it on.  It takes<br/>
a hyper awareness of their needs in order to<br/>
communicate and raise a special needs child, but<br/>
unschooling is a perfect fit for knowing them as<br/>
people in the way that facilitates this communication.<br/>
<br/>
With our non-autistic child this is decidedly less<br/>
pronounced or frequent, but he still occassionally<br/>
shuts down when pressured to make a decision or<br/>
presented with too many choices too.  It&#39;s just way<br/>
more obvious with our eldest.  But then I tend to find<br/>
that nearly all our son&#39;s &quot;typically autistic&quot;<br/>
behaviors are just extremely pronounced versions of<br/>
things that most kids do sometimes.<br/>

While this may be true, I think a careful and continuing awareness of ANY child is what it takes to be a mindful parent.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Kirby is old enough to get himself up and to work.  He&#39;s old enough he could live on his own if he wanted and needed to.  But I still try to have personal notice of his moods, the state of his clothes, his schedule, his social life, etc.  And for little kids, it was way closer.  Sleeping enough? Eating?  Happy? Calm?<br/>

***************** I feel the same with Tom. Exactly the same...<br/>
<br/>

****************** We do the same, but Tom is like someone who can read in our thinking. And maybe inside, we are waiting him to eat and he feels it. He&#39;s so thin...So, we don&#39;t put pressure anymore, but maybe he feels the pressure inside, anyway...<br/>
