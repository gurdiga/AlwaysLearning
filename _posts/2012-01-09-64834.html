<div id="ygrps-yiv-700735165">I think I need some new ideas for my oldest who is 10.<br/>
He is the kid who takes everything apart to see how it works. And is pretty good at putting it back together too. Loves Nerf guns and bb guns, guns in general, things that shoot, building with K&#39;nex, we have snap circuts, legos.  I am really not a computer person or gamer and I have a hard time really understanding that area.  I would like some creative computer games for him to create on the computer (anyone know of one where you would create guns?)  We have Age of Empires and Zoombinis but he wasn&#39;t really drawn to either of those. We don&#39;t have a gaming system.  He is not interested in building with wood but does weld with my husband.  He is very visual, but has no interest in reading yet so I would love something that might spark alittle of that for him. <br/>
Loves Kip Kay on Utube and things with special effects.  He tells me all the time that he loves to blow things up.  Forth of July is big for him.  Not sure how to foster that safely?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340580122">Not a video game suggestion, but has he taken apart old appliances, computers or other electronics? Sometimes you can find things cheaply at thrifts stores or you can ask relatives if they have anything like that (or to save broken things for him). <br/>
<br/>
He might enjoy building and launching rockets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060661038">I bet he&#39;d enjoy Minecraft - that&#39;s a downloadable game for the computer. Players build constructions out of textured cubes. Sounds simple (and it actually is!) but it&#39;s VERY engaging and enjoyable. There are servers run by unschoolers, you can find more info on the unschooling gamers list. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling_gamers/">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/unschooling_gamers/</a><br/>
<br/>
Of course, he might not like computer games; it sounds like he is more hands-on. (not that he can&#39;t enjoy both!)<br/>
<br/>
He might like Backyard Ballistics, a very cool book detailing steps for anyone to create ballistic devices like potato guns, missiles, catapults, cannon, etc. out of household items, or stuff you can pick up at a hardware store: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.backyard-ballistics.com/">http://www.backyard-ballistics.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
A friend holds a Backyard Ballistics day annually; maybe you could host something like that?<br/>

one of the computer games she enjoyed during that time period. You can<br/>
build rube goldberg machines that involved dynamite and rockets. Pretty<br/>
fun. I liked playing it too &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614973072">Not a video game, but an idea for the love of guns.  I recently found out<br/>
that my local gun club has a youth shooting program.  Not only does my 11<br/>
y/o get to use guns in a very safe and supportive environment, but at the<br/>
first meeting we went to, we got there a little early and they were taking<br/>
apart and putting back together an old WW2 gun and explained a lot about<br/>
the mechanics of guns while they were doing it.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to search out your local gun club and see what they have for<br/>
kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539108619">minecraft minecraft minecraft!  I love that people have already suggested it.  It&#39;s such a great game.  My 8 year old has been playing it for about a year now.  No other game has ever kept his interest like this.<br/>
<br/>
Another one similar to minecraft is Terraria - it&#39;s just 2D instead of 3D.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859462581">People have already mentioned minecraft which is an excellent game. The creator of minecraft Notch likes terraria which someone mentioned already.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard 101 is a nice mmo type video game that&#39;s targeted to 6-14 years old. Not necessarily for the builder type, but my 5 year old loves it.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few toys/items not games that might interest your son with some more expensive than others. This first one is my favorite and its made for 8+ I believe I have not yet gotten it for my son by I plan on it this coming Christmas even though he won&#39;t be quite old enough for it I plan on doing it with him. This product is Lego Mindstorms NXT. It is a Lego product as such you can build your own stuff, but it also includes many pieces of programmable hardware including logic chips, motors to control, and many other things. Universities and such use it to their students about robotics. Its lego&#39;s to build robots basically and you must program them to do the things you want. So not only does your child use his imagination building and programming things, but he much learn programming, and electronics. As a 10 year old I think this would be perfect for your son. It is expensive and you are looking at $225 or so just to get started. You can buy additional parts as needed. You basically get a fun way for your child to learn electrical/computer engineering concepts.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child radio shack had electronic hobby &quot;learning lab&quot; where you could make your own  electronic type items. They still make stuff similar<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3814337#">http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3814337#</a><br/>
<br/>
this is the type of thing I am talking about and there are many different kinds.<br/>
<br/>
Another item would be an Arduino board. Its an electric hobby board the purpose would be close to the same as the lego mindstorms except you aren&#39;t building robots although you can. the arduino has a huge following. Someone mentioned instructables.com I know they have many different arduino ideas there.<br/>
<br/>
There are actually quite a few different types of electronic boards that are very similar to arduino, but are cheaper, or serve a slightly different purpose. One imparticularly isn&#39;t out yet, but its called the raspberry pi. Its a $25 &quot;pc&quot; computer board with everything needed to be a very basic computer. Its got video output, input device support, ram and a cpu. It&#39;s great for tinkering and the like.<br/>
<br/>
One more idea. Ebay. I have done an ebay lot of legos, but there are many other things that are just as fun, but different than legos.<br/>
<br/>
Tinker Toys<br/>
Construx (I used these as a child love them)<br/>
K&#39;nex<br/>
Lincoln Logs<br/>
<br/>
These used are generally decently cheap on ebay and you can find people that package them in big lots which make them way cheaper than going to the store. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway that&#39;s a quick brainstorm of ideas I have for my Deuce when he gets older. Hopefully they help you out too!</div>

 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s interested in TV shows where things get blown up, there&#39;s Mythbusters.  My son and I also used to watch a British TV show called Brainiac: Science Abuse, which featured different ways of blowing up a caravan, and that was great fun.  Here&#39;s a short sample I found on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnl4bK_veg0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnl4bK_veg0</a><br/>
<br/>
Future Weapons?  That was another show my son liked that featured guns and explosions.  The only computer game that comes to mind is Lemmings, which was one of my wife&#39;s favourites at one time.  Possibly that&#39;s a bit tame if your son like balls of flame and flying debris.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the responses but I see you have quite a few of them.<br/>
<br/>
There is a market for toy guns fitted out in steampunk style.  Even if he just made a single nerf gun look like a 19th century science fiction gun and put the photo online, he would be rewarded with attention. :-)    He might be too young for the detailing, but I saw one done up with the springs from inside ballpoint pens and some other things, bent and fastened with glue (maybe hot glue, but I don&#39;t remember) and then painted.  So it&#39;s more like making miniatures, only they&#39;re life size.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he&#39;s not able to do it yet, he might be interested in looking up steam punk guns at google image.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089162887">Thank-you for all of the suggestions, a lot of them the steampunk guns, ballistics book (spent the evening making matchstick rockets)and suggestion of the gun club really resinated.  We already go shooting but that might put him in contact with kids who shoot too.  <br/>
He is more hands on and I wish I came across more class like environments for builders.  I am not sure how to foster a relationship with a mentor of some type.  He also loves, and can work on himself, RC cars.  I suppose just hanging out and asking lots of questions at the hobby shop more often would be an option to learning even more.  <br/>
Love the lego mindstorms, they are just so expensive!  Saving.<br/>
I remember looking on utube at something like the Chaos Tower that you built yourself on a wall.  Don&#39;t remember what they are called though. Anyone know? <br/>
Brainiacs is great, have How things work, will have to check out the computer games, have tried some.  He mostly likes ones that involve shooting.<br/>
Here is Kip Kay.  Someone he loves watching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789700062">Go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.minecraft.net/">http://www.minecraft.net/</a> and purchase the download that is appropriate for your operating system.  I think it costs about $20, although the amount, if I remember correctly, is given in Euros.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the game installed and running you can choose various modes of play: single or multi player and survival or creative mode.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d suggest starting with single-player under the creative mode so he can play around and build with a full inventory without having to worry about looking for materials or creatures destroying his work at first.<br/>
