I don&#39;t usually let things like this through, but Marty confirms it&#39;s  <br/>
for real, and says they&#39;ve been doing it about ten years, to get more  <br/>
people interested in comic books.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This might be a good thing for deschooling purposes, too, and it&#39;s  <br/>
possible some people here don&#39;t even know where the nearest comic book  <br/>
store is.   Probably some of the freebies aren&#39;t the most desirable  <br/>
comics ever made, but I could be wrong.  Probably there are extras of  <br/>
some stuff printed as samples by companies promoting their series.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
The site talked about stores&#39; possible restrictions, so I&#39;m guessing  <br/>
maybe there&#39;s a way to try to keep people in bigger towns from going  <br/>
store to store (a rubber stamp?).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here have experience or stories about free comic book days of  <br/>
days of yore?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197425408">We do not have any experience with it but I just called our local store that is participating, the restrictions are on specific collector comics. If you want an original Spiderman, Pokemon, etc they aren&#39;t going to be a part of the give away. Basically anything of high value, they will be newer comics. He did not mention if there was a limit to the number of comics that can be obtained. I would suggest calling your local stores to find out their specific restrictions if any. It does sound like it is going to be a party though he said they have big plans for that day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband has gone to a local comic shop for the last couple years for the free day and he says they&#39;re comics printed specifically for the day, with &quot;Free Comic Book Day&quot; or something similar on the front.  They also had little collector figures one year.  He says they don&#39;t have a complete story, you&#39;d have to buy the next issue to find out what happens.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have enjoyed it, too, because they like free things. : )<br/>
