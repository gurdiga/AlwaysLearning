<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051680627"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I know a guy here in our town who desperately wanted<br/>
 </span></blockquote>his own business so he bought an old truck and a half<br/>
dozen garbage cans and now operates a thriving<br/>
poop-scooping business, where people pay a monthly fee<br/>
and he comes and cleans up after their dogs. In our<br/>
commute town, such a service is in high demand. He<br/>
said he works about three or four hours a day,<br/>
including driving, five days a week, and supports his<br/>
family doing it.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, whoever wrote this, tell me this guy is in<br/>
Seattle!!  My husband is waiting until a big freeze so<br/>
it will be easier to clean up the dog poop and while<br/>
it pours down rain here it&#39;s becoming really tricky to<br/>
find a place in the back corner portion of the yard<br/>
for our boxer to go.  I&#39;d love to hire someone to do<br/>
it!!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I, too, revert to &quot;THE GENERAL&quot; when under stress...especially when we are <br/>
&gt;running late.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m several digests behind, so forgive me for responding late.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I got out of all those TCP/non-coercive parenting debates <br/>
on AOL back in the day was the concept of time coercion and money <br/>
coercion.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of time when I&#39;m stressed and not treating myself and others well, <br/>
it&#39;s because I feel the pressure of time or money closing in on me.  I <br/>
can usually short circuit the stress and my bad behavior by identifiying <br/>
exactly what the pressure is.  I am chronically, pathologically early--I <br/>
hate to be late for anything.  This causes a lot of time-coercion in my <br/>
life, as you can imagine.  (My husband is chronically late, but he just <br/>
thinks it&#39;s because he&#39;s an optimist.  i.e., he thinks he can get more <br/>
done than he actually can. :)  So when I feel the time crunch and start <br/>
hurrying Will, I try to remind myself that it&#39;s OKAY to be on time.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
(Interestingly, when it comes to a project or job, I work better under <br/>
deadline pressure, and often save the largest and most creative tasks <br/>
for the last minute.)<br/>
<br/>
The money-coercion thing I handle best by planning ahead for everything, <br/>
and using Quicken.  :)  I put money-to-blow right there in the budget <br/>
(luckily we generally have some to blow).  It usually goes for the Big <br/>
Kid meal on the way home from the skating rink, when Will is <br/>
demonstrating the hungry-uglies because he should have eaten something <br/>
besides cookies for breakfast, or stuff like that.  <br/>
<br/>
So, if you can remember that it&#39;s not the kids, it&#39;s the time or money <br/>
that&#39;s making you stress out, you&#39;re one step closer to happy childhood.<br/>

Yeah, you&#39;re right.  I am a terminal worrier about lateness.  Although, I <br/>
don&#39;t seem to require it of folks coming to my house : )  I do try to think <br/>
ahead about where we need to go and how much needs to get into the car before <br/>
we leave, etc.  I find that the times that are the worst are when I&#39;ve let <br/>
the girls to &quot;just one more thing, Mom.&quot;  Of course, we move at different <br/>
speeds and I get more and more volcano-ish.  Not a pretty sight.  <br/>
<br/>
And money... that is a whole new stress area.  I go through weeks where I can <br/>
just think philosophically about the fact that we are just making the <br/>
payments.  And then some horrid bill comes in that I had not <br/>
anticipated...like dh&#39;s car breaks down (again) or his yearly professional <br/>
membership renewal ($187 and required for him to keep his OT license in the <br/>
state)  is due.  Then I go from bitchin&#39; and moanin&#39; to nearly crying at the <br/>
continual stress level regarding money.  Boy, that sounds pathetic!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help with perspective.  <br/>
