<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091593421">Hey Janet!  Wow, congratulations!  And I get winded just running up the <br/>
stairs!  Isn&#39;t San Diego awesome?  I stayed at the Hotel Del Coronado <br/>
with my parents about 12 years ago.  It was so beautiful.  <br/>
<br/>
My novel-in-progress is a (or hopefully someday will be) a mixed media <br/>
piece with music by Loreena McKennitt and photos by Joyce Tenneson.  It <br/>
is a quest story about four individuals who personify the past, present, <br/>
and future who must overcome religion and science to bring true faith <br/>
back into the world.  It&#39;s called &quot;Icon.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
This is my first attempt at a novel and it&#39;s so exciting and <br/>
challenging.  Unfortunately, with four little girls, I just can&#39;t find <br/>
the time or  the energy to work on it much.  I keep telling myself that <br/>
I could leave it until they are bigger and I have more time, but I <br/>
really don&#39;t want to.  So it doesn&#39;t get much work done on it, but a <br/>
little bit here and there.  It&#39;s one of my life goals to be a published <br/>
writer.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve also written a children&#39;s book.  My husband&#39;s cousin is an <br/>
children&#39;s book editor for HarperCollins in NYC.  One of these days, I&#39;m <br/>
going to get up the courage to send it to her.  I&#39;d be an idiot not to!    <br/>
<br/>
Would you mind telling what you&#39;re working on?  I know some writers <br/>
don&#39;t like to discuss it while they&#39;re working, but I&#39;d love to know. <br/>
 I&#39;d also love to know how you fit writing in.   One of my best friends <br/>
here in Wayland just sold her poetry to a publishing house for her own <br/>
chap book.  HeidiC.<br/>

there&#39;s a coming of age angle as well).  That&#39;s the nutshell.<br/>

I fit my writing in at night after everyone&#39;s asleep.  Sometimes I get up<br/>

Good for you.  I have started writing books in the past but never <br/>
finished, decided I did not like where it was going or not enough <br/>
research.  I recently got an idea for a new one so I am just starting <br/>
the research for that one.  IT seems like I never can get in the flow <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152332569">Thank you, Olga, for the encouragement.  I don&#39;t really work on it a <br/>
whole lot now.  I used to stay up until 2 or 3 every other night and <br/>
drink tons of coffee to work on it, but I got really burnt out...(wasn&#39;t <br/>
 being a great mommy).  So now I do a lot more reading and researching <br/>
and note making and  put it together when I get the time and/or energy. <br/>
 It&#39;s hard, like Janet said, because I try to &quot;become&quot; my characters in <br/>
my head and it&#39;s impossible to do if you&#39;re not alone and now I&#39;ve got <br/>
two kids who get up early and two who stay up late.  So when I do get <br/>
time away from them, then dh is right there looking for his TLC ;).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, go for it to whatever degree you can manage.  It&#39;s esspecially <br/>
nice WHEN things get crazy because then there&#39;s at least one place, <br/>
albeit a fictional one, where you are in complete control of EVERYONE. <br/>
 It&#39;s a pretty good feeling.<br/>
<br/>
And check out Joyce Tenneson&#39;s web page <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tenneson.com/">http://www.tenneson.com/</a>  Her <br/>
photography is so amazing.  <br/>

My youngest dd (9 almost 10) really enjoys her pen pals. (pony pen pals, of<br/>
course)  She has four of them right now and just sent for 2 more.  She<br/>
always looks forward to their letters and she is pretty prompt about writing<br/>
back.  She has almost always written her letters on the computer and printed<br/>
them out because she didn&#39;t feel like her hand writing was neat enough to be<br/>
legible.  (and sometimes it wasn&#39;t)   Quite often her pen pals write back to<br/>
her in long hand and she has noticed how neat some of them write.  I think<br/>
it inspired her to try harder to write neatly.  This last batch of pen pal<br/>
letters that she sent out were all written in long hand and they were not<br/>
only neat, but she actually used capital and lowercase letters<br/>
appropriately.  Since she began writing, she&#39;s used almost exclusively<br/>
capital letters when writing in long hand.  She just found it easier than<br/>
printing lower case letters.  When writing on the computer she has always<br/>
used both lower case and upper case letters.  I was pleasantly surprised at<br/>
just how lovely her letters were.  The punctuation was right on too, except<br/>
in one or two places.  It never ceases to amaze me to see how things all<br/>
come together when the kids have a purpose for something and they are ready<br/>
for it.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We get Young Rider Magazine and in it there is a form you can fill out to<br/>
get a pony pen pal.  It&#39;s for children who are interested in horses or<br/>
ponies.  I had a pen pal as a child but it wasn&#39;t based on having a similar<br/>
interest and it was often hard to think of things to write.   I think the<br/>
pony pen pals have a lot more to share with each other because they have the<br/>
same interest.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664192970">I think writing DOES fall into place....My husband teaches a simple 4 month, once a week online writing class  older unschooling kiddos..the bases is a 5 paragraph paper that many students are forced to learn by brow beating...the 5 paragraph paper is the backbone for the new SATs and most college papers... why schools don&#39;t simplify something so basic is beyond me!<br/>

Pretty sure you need to get the magazine.  You cut out the ad form and mail<br/>
it in with a letter about yourself along with a stamped self addressed<br/>
envelope.  They have a website if you want to check out what the magazine is<br/>
about.  www.youngrider.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youngrider.com/">http://www.youngrider.com/</a>&gt; <br/>
