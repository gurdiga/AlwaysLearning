<div id="ygrps-yiv-651423800">Just as I was about to send this to friends of mine, one a lawyer, one a big <br/>
history buff, and all three of whom have been involved in writing <br/>
medievalish/Renaissancish ceremonies with me, I realized it was an unschooling story and <br/>
so decided to offload it on you folks as well!<br/>
<br/>
That other e-mail, from here down:<br/>
========================================<br/>
<br/>
-=-. . . in order to own property under the Spanish and Mexican land grant <br/>
system, you had to physically step on the land, run your fingers through the <br/>
soil, and make a public commitment to live on it, cultivate it, and, if <br/>
necessary, defend it with your life.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jeff (and to Jon by copy), this is from an article on the ceremony for <br/>
accepting a land grant:<br/>

It&#39;s in an article by a historian named Robert Torrez.   Marty and I heard <br/>
him yesterday, at El Rancho de las Golandrinas, talking about the history of <br/>
justice in New Mexico.  It  was fun.  He told stories of crime involving women <br/>
(as perpetrators or catalysts), one good one from each century from 18th, and a <br/>
great story about a botched hanging in Las Vegas, and I was wishing you and <br/>
Balthazar had been there.  You&#39;d&#39;ve enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
But just putzing around today to see what he might have published, I found <br/>
this.  This stuff could be worked into a ceremony for a landed baron or <br/>
something, maybe, sometime.  It&#39;s not the same, I know, but still...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m copying Wendy too.<br/>
How disorganized of me to add people as I go along. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m glad Marty&#39;s so interested in New Mexico history.   Good excuse for me to <br/>
help him trivia, and darned if some of it doesn&#39;t stick to me.<br/>
