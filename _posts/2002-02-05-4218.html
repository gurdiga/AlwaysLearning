&lt;&lt; The point is that REAL engineers don&#39;t say things like<br/>
your !*&$^&^!!! neighbor did.  Real engineers<br/>
encourage in subtle ways. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not all engineers have good social skills.<br/>
<br/>
You know some who are also nice people.  <br/>
<br/>
Engineering doesn&#39;t guarantee social and interpersonal skill.  (In my <br/>
experience, and to hear my husband talk about the guys at work, I think it <br/>
precludes it in many cases.)<br/>
<br/>
For the imagination you&#39;d think engineers should have, some of the parties <br/>
we&#39;ve gone to with themes have been lame.  At a hat party, most of them were <br/>
wearing baseball caps.  One guy wore a helicopter test pilot helmet, which <br/>
would have been really impressive except that he was a helicopter test pilot.<br/>
<br/>
Keith wore a medieval-style helmet with ram&#39;s horns on it (a friend of ours <br/>
had made it).  He was QUITE overdressed.  I had a baby-bonnet on my <br/>
9-month-pregnant belly, and a leather biker cap on me.  That was like going <br/>
nekkid by our regular standards, but I wasn&#39;t feeling at all well or <br/>
energetic.  I was overdressed too.  Most of the women didn&#39;t wear a hat at <br/>
all.  And we took a cake, made like a hat.  Like a big &quot;Billy Jack&quot; black <br/>
felt hat, with a concho hatband and a feather!   Other people brought doritos <br/>
and bought-dip.<br/>
<br/>
Engineers...<br/>

<br/>
I told dd I mentioned the incident to my list friends and that someone had said how awful it was.  Dd said whenever the neighbor says stuff like that she just thinks less of her.  I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t think less of herself.  The fact that dd mentioned it to me means it did have some impact but she turned it around.  I told her about how amazing I think her problem solving skills are since she looks at all the possibilities.  She said &quot;yea that is why I don&#39;t always get the right answer&quot;.  Of course I set her straight on that one.  Thank you very much ps!<br/>

<br/>
Holly has come back with comments from lots of people.  We laugh, and she <br/>
says &quot;I would never say anything like that to someone!&quot;   For a child with <br/>
less confidence, or one who was not in the habit of sharing such things with <br/>
parents, it could erode joy, though, for sure.  <br/>
<br/>
When neighbors told Marty and Holly, years ago at the old neighborhood, that <br/>
if they didn&#39;t go to school they could never get a job, I just started naming <br/>
off people they knew who had jobs who were still teens, or who were working <br/>
in fields for which they weren&#39;t trained, or for which there WAS not <br/>
training, and pointed out (with guilty joy, which I tried to keep out of my <br/>
voice and posture) that the dad of those kids was unemployed and he DID go to <br/>
school, he just wasn&#39;t good at keeping a job.<br/>
<br/>
A month or so ago I did talk to the dad of another little girl.  The little <br/>
girl had told Holly if she didn&#39;t go to school she could never go to college. <br/>
 Holly knows it&#39;s not true, but this little girl was totally convinced of it, <br/>
and was worried for Holly.  I told the dad, because I knew it was his doing.  <br/>
His ex-wife was homeschooling and he wanted the girl in school, so it was <br/>
part of his package of soothing persuasion.  &quot;I want you to be able to go to <br/>
college, and get a good job.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In her case it&#39;s legitimate.  The mom was maximally neglectful and ignorant, <br/>
and has series of live-in short term boyfriends, and is mean and violent.  <br/>
(Currently in jail.)  That wasn&#39;t a good homeschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t make ours a bad homeschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
That was easily fixable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132354">So I&#39;ll admit that there is a greater percentage of party impaired people in<br/>
just about any group of engineers than in the population as a whole, but<br/>
I&#39;ve been to too many parties where actors or singers go on and on and on,<br/>
mostly about themselves, to ever willing go to a party with a crowd of them.<br/>
<br/>
I also see a reverse proportion of interest between the arts and sciences:<br/>
Far more scientists and engineers, have a solid understanding of the arts<br/>
than artists have of science and engineering.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather spend my party time with the engineers...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This does remind me of one of my favorite engineer jokes though-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013407185">Oh dear, some of those engineers were awful.  The<br/>
uncle geological engineer had rocks in his head.  I<br/>
spent a summer (8) with his family.  I saw him bounce<br/>
my  cousin, Sonny&#39;s head off the wall becuase he was a<br/>
few minutes late to  Sunday dinner. He was<br/>
unreasonable in other ways, too. Patricia, and Joey,<br/>
the next youngest after Sonny, killed themselves. The<br/>
step-father civil engineer held me by one foot in the<br/>
air while he &quot;spanked&quot; me....in front of a room of<br/>
other children as I had continued to sing softly when<br/>
we were all told to be quiet. I was too embarrassed to<br/>
cry. My clothing fell over my head exposing my<br/>
panties. He was much worse to my brothers. Of course,<br/>
that was not an isolated incident. BUT he taught me to<br/>
use a slide rule when I was 4....because I wanted to<br/>
know how it worked. The grandfather( he was already in<br/>
his 60s when mother was born) beat my (Canasta<br/>
playing) grandmother and molested my mother (she used<br/>
him as a model for adult behaviour) who became the<br/>
suicidal alcoholic, who set me up for similar<br/>
experiences, except she did a good portion of the<br/>
beating herself. Except for a few visits with (those<br/>
damned Clavinists, as my mother called them) my father<br/>
and his parents before age 6, and court paternity<br/>
hearings about one of my little brothers, I didn&#39;t see<br/>
the father, electrical engineer, until I was 17.  When<br/>
I was 18 he came to my apartment and my roommate<br/>
almost called the police (we didn&#39;t have a phone) as<br/>
he claimed to be my father.  The common denomitaor<br/>
is/was my mother. They all had rotten interpersonal<br/>
skills.  That is one reason that they were attracted<br/>
to the discernable order of engineering. And not one<br/>
of them ever discouraged anybody from the field....any<br/>
interest evidenced was considered flattery. The only<br/>
really nice one, is G&#39;Ma Louise. She redeemed my<br/>
father. I met her when I met him. But she once<br/>
(?)slugged (knocked him down with a fist directed to<br/>
his face) my half-brother (I met him when I was in my<br/>
twenties) and he committed an armed robbery when he<br/>
was in high-school. He committed some other vandalisms<br/>
on the school, too. He is now a historian who does<br/>
roofing for money. G&#39;Ma blames it on the &quot;wrong&quot;<br/>
crowd. Dunno. <br/>
<br/>
When I took custody of my sister, denying it to her<br/>
father (the civil engineer step-father) I found that<br/>
it was necessary to create a civil :) working<br/>
relationship with her Daddy, for her.  She loves him. <br/>
It has all worked out, relatively :) speaking since. <br/>
<br/>
When my littlest brother got back from Vietnam he was<br/>
a wreck, but needed somewhere to live.  Our father,<br/>
G&#39;Pa Bill, the electrical engineer, and G&#39;Ma Louise<br/>
had just showed me their slides from Tibet and Nepal<br/>
so I approached them from the standpoint of Karma. <br/>
They didn&#39;t know what I was talking about, but they<br/>
had 4 or so empty bedrooms and lots of other space :)<br/>
so they invited him (thank you thank you)to<br/>
Huntsville, and he&#39;s been there since. <br/>
<br/>
I was previously talking about the good part of them.<br/>
They are human beings.  There is much more good and<br/>
much more bad than I can possibly recount.<br/>
.............<br/>
Sandra, it sounds like YOU generate the good energy <br/>
everywhere! Even a hat cake! And bonnet on your tummy.<br/>
Awwwww. You are a good sport! And Keith, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been to a theme party, well, except once,<br/>
BETWEEN marriages (note BETWEEN, Dar and Mhagin,<br/>
Maghin...where does that h go?).  It was a mystery<br/>
&quot;who-done-it&quot; party. Kind of like sort of grown-ups<br/>
playing detectives.  The interesting part was that<br/>
they actually took the time out of their lives to do<br/>
it...just for fun, for themselves.  It wasn&#39;t FOR<br/>
anything.  Not a benefit, or holiday, or child&#39;s<br/>
birthday.  The hostess and the guests were European,<br/>
except for me. Are Americans fuddy-duddies compared to<br/>
others?  Or just the folks I now know? <br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm.  Maybe a pow-wow could be called a theme party?<br/>
I&#39;ve participated in some of couple of those...<br/>
