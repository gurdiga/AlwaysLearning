<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416385913">Hey folks, <br/>
<br/>
My daughter had cradle cap as a baby and it never really went away, I think. There are spots of darker crud you can scrape away all over her scalp. If you try hard and don&#39;t mind pissing her off. :) She&#39;s just 5 this month, and my husband remembers being 6 and having his mom compulsively pick at his scalp. He HATED it. Once he became a beach kid around then with his hair wet for hours a day it went away. She definitely takes way more after him genetically. We never have bathed her much (usually 1-2 times a week unless she seemed to need it) since she had very dry sensitive skin, and doesn&#39;t want a bath often, and it didn&#39;t seem necessary. She gets a lot of art supplies and sometimes sand on her but not dirt. We regularly go a month or so without doing anything other than getting her hair wet. She HATES having her hair washed. The crud isn&#39;t itchy, and it doesn&#39;t bother her, so it&#39;s fine by me. I personally only wash my hair with baking soda once a week and you can&#39;t tell now that my scalp adjusted, so washing every day seems excessive.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re about to change insurance, though, and I&#39;m a little concerned about looking to a new pediatrician like I am neglecting my kid. So my question is, has anyone else had experience with anything like this? I wish I knew whether this is just what happens with some kids when you don&#39;t wash their hair, but I don&#39;t want to force her into frequent hairwashing to find out. We don&#39;t have good pool access anymore or I&#39;d try daily swimming. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838912963">We just finally addressed my 7-year old son&#39;s cradle cap the other day.   I<br/>
asked him casually whether he wanted me to get rid of it, and he said,<br/>
&quot;sure!&quot;  That was not the response I&#39;d gotten when I&#39;d asked previously<br/>
over the years (though I never put any pressure on him).  He&#39;s also an<br/>
infrequent bather and doesn&#39;t like having his hair washed, though these<br/>
days he doesn&#39;t seem to mind as much.<br/>
<br/>
If/when she DOES decide she&#39;s ready to get rid of it, olive oil works<br/>
amazingly well--just coat the scalp with it, let it sit for 10-15 minutes,<br/>
and comb it out with a fine tooth comb.  It&#39;s really pretty easy, if your<br/>
child is agreeable to it.  Sam actually really enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
As for doctors, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it--we have changed doctors<br/>
frequently, and nobody has ever said a thing about it.      If they do,<br/>
just smile and confidently let them know you&#39;ll address it when your<br/>
daughter is ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385155445">I&#39;d gotten advice that some vaseline or baby oil rubbed in would help loosen it, so it would brush out easily. It didn&#39;t work perfectly, but it helped. Made my son&#39;s hair greasy, though. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435336336">It could be an allergy, and I would definitely recommend olive oil.  A good<br/>
pure virgin olive oil.  Just massage her scalp with it and a very small<br/>
amount is all you need.  Just wet your finger tips and do so.  She may even<br/>
enjoy doing this herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052696899">***My daughter had cradle cap as a baby and it never really went away, I think.***<br/>
<br/>
Margaux had that for many years. Â She never ever wanted her hair brushed and she hated (still does) having it touched and really avoided washing it. Â She&#39;s 10 now and bathes at least once a week and sometimes brushes her hair. Â The cradle cap went away on its own about 2 yrs ago. Â There was no way she would let me do anything to remove it. Â She knew it was there and didn&#39;t care. Â We&#39;ve done nothing different, it just went away. Â Some kids have really sensitive scalps. Â The cradle cap sticks to the base of the hair and will actually pull out hair if you try to remove it. Â My daughter found that to be way too painful to experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When she was a baby I&#39;d rub oil into her scalp while she nursed and that would remove it, but it comes right back. Â By the time she had enough hair to somewhat hide it, she didn&#39;t want her head touched. Â One of her cousins had the same issue but his mom put all kinds of stuff in his hair to get rid of it because it really bothered her. Â His went away when he was about 8 too.<br/>

my eleven year old&#39;s pubescent cradle cap by treating it internally.<br/>
Vitamin D from the sun, liver support like dandelion and nettles, and<br/>
cod/flax/coconut oils.  If your daughter has a hard time with supplements<br/>
you may be able to mix them in to other foods?  My daughter&#39;s scalp was so<br/>
sensitive she wouldn&#39;t let me brush it let alone rub the flakes off.  By<br/>
treating it internally we were able to avoid that! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850842447">I&#39;ve spent the past few years struggling with crud on my own scalp. Apparently, I&#39;ve got the adult version of cradle cap.  In my case, it&#39;s related to my eczema. It&#39;s not a hair washing or not washing thing. It&#39;s stress, and genetics, the weather...and probably other things I can&#39;t put my finger on. <br/>
<br/>
I just Googled and found a ton of articles about cradle cap in older children.  This article &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cradlecaptreatment.org/cradle-cap-in-older-children/">http://www.cradlecaptreatment.org/cradle-cap-in-older-children/</a>&gt; states that it&#39;s *not* caused by poor hygenie and reccomends that you contact your pediatrician if it&#39;s spreading to other parts of the body, irritating, or bleeding. Similar information is here &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_cap">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_cap</a>&gt; <br/>
<br/>
What if you approached the new pediatrician with the attitude that it&#39;s just this mildly annoying skin problem and you&#39;ve been working to find the best way to manage it? The doctor may offer some suggestions, but you don&#39;t have to follow any that you disagree with. <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to try the olive oil on my own scalp -- thanks to those who suggested it! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915622804">Morgan had cradle cap for a long time - and when she was younger she was in the tub a lot and got her hair wet/washed frequently. So in my experience, it&#39;s not a &quot;no washing&quot; thing. She does have a very sensitive scalp, though, so anything involving combing her hair was right out. I think it went away around age 7ish - that time when kids grow out of that sort of generic &quot;little kid&quot; look. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141580975">Thank you SO MUCH. I love you guys. The cradle cap articles confused me a little, and we have more of a brown scum actually than a yellow flake & I&#39;m not seeing that anywhere. But the approach at this point will be pretty much the same anyway. I&#39;ve been reassured that I can let it be a bit longer. <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who were curious, Katya has been off cow dairy since she was a baby and it made her poop blood. Awesome! We&#39;ve reintroduced a tiny tiny bit in goldfish crackers etc but no scalp change. She had one huge ezcema episode as a toddler after eating a whole box of peanut butter crackers and a whole tin of Altoids, so I wonder if it could be peanut butter related...but I&#39;m sure that, if it bumps way further up my priority list, is a better query for the foodlab group. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074600324">Cradle cap is a fungus that can be an indication there is fungus/yeast in the body too. You can certainly treat it topically with an anti-fungal like coconut oil and/or tea tree oil but it may not completely resolve without addressing the internal environment too. A probiotic and a low to no sugar diet is a great place to start. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608510507">I young babies it can be overactive oil glands or a release of mom&#39;s hormones, but if it persists or comes back at an older age, it is always wise to treat it as a yeast conditions. It doesn&#39;t hurt to treat it this way in babies either just in case. If it wasn&#39;t yeast, no harm done. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471573234">Could it just be vernix stuck to the head (in a newborn)? Our son was born with that waxy stuff on his head. I always assumed it was vernix which hadn&#39;t washed off because of his thick hair. It stuck about for a few years (he didn&#39;t like hair washing or combing) but has gone now (he&#39;s five). With my daughter it was the same, only she seems to like a hair wash, so I massaged in olive oil, and then after a shampooing, combed it out. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608471033">My now 10 year old had cradle cap until he was around 6 (I think, can&#39;t remember when it disappeared exactly).  We tried different things when he was a baby (shampoo, oil, ect..), but nothing really seemed to work.  I didn&#39;t worry too much, because he never complained about it and it didn&#39;t seem to bother him.   Washing his hair more did seem to help some (he did go through a phase of not wanting to wash his hair very often) but not entirely.  He seemed to grow out of it at some point and hasn&#39;t had it for at least a few years.  Our younger son (age 6 now) never had it.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting to hear that it might be related to a dairy allergy.  The son that had it is personally averse to most dairy (not allergic).  He does eat yogurt, but that&#39;s about the only dairy he has ever eaten on a regular basis.  Doesn&#39;t drink milk and the only thing he likes a bit of cheese on is a bean burrito.  <br/>
