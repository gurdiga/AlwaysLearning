<div id="ygrps-yiv-952780975">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My name is Michelle and I&#39;m new to this list.  I&#39;ve been (mostly)<br/>
unschooling for 15 years (I have  15 y.o and 10 y.o daughters).  I&#39;m needing<br/>
support right now in finding research on learning and outcomes of<br/>
unschoolers for my husband.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He recently decided to become a teacher (gasp!) and is taking on all the<br/>
reading and &quot;how&quot; learning takes place best from his texts.  He is freaking<br/>
out about how we&#39;ve &quot;taught&quot; our kids and worried about their success in the<br/>
bigger world (despite the fact they test at and above age level and always<br/>
have).  I want to be able to counter some of his points about learning and<br/>
how it &quot;best&quot; takes place.  He is a very analytical guy and if I can come<br/>
back to him with some concrete facts and figures, then I feel I have a<br/>
fighting chance.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you know of research out there that shows outcomes of unschoolers,<br/>
or at least homeschoolers?  Research about alternative learning - not the<br/>
standard mainstream curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Any information would be exceedingly helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448912889">-=- I&#39;ve been (mostly)<br/>
unschooling for 15 years (I have 15 y.o and 10 y.o daughters). I&#39;m  <br/>
needing<br/>
support right now in finding research on learning and outcomes of<br/>
unschoolers for my husband.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This part is important to me:<br/>
<br/>
If your oldest is 15, you have been doing something since she was old  <br/>
enough to be required by law to go to school, at 5 or 6 or 7.  So  <br/>
let&#39;s say you&#39;ve been doing something for 10 years.  What is &quot;mostly  <br/>
unschooling&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
The reason I&#39;ve stopped you at the door this way is that there are  <br/>
hundreds of readers and I don&#39;t want a single one of them to get the  <br/>
wrong impression about how easy it is to unschool or what &quot;mostly  <br/>
unschooling&quot; might look like up against dedicated unquestioned  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean you used to not unschool but then you changed and so for  <br/>
some part of those ten years you&#39;ve been absolutely unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you mean that for ten or fifteen years you&#39;ve never quite wholly  <br/>
unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
I can vouch for the alchemy that comes about once a family truly lives  <br/>
an unschooling life.   The arguments won&#39;t hold, though, if in your  <br/>
family you&#39;ve been testing your kids, and still your husband doesn&#39;t  <br/>
understand it well enough not to be a critical judge of what he&#39;s  <br/>
reading in the college of education.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You said:<br/>
Do any of you know of research out there that shows outcomes of unschoolers, or at least homeschoolers? Research about alternative learning - not the standard mainstream curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
The research I am referring you to is noit about outcomes but reveals a gap in research that might get your parthner thinking.<br/>
<br/>
The research done by Alan Thomas and Harriet Pattison - see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.howchildrenlearnathome.co.uk/">http://www.howchildrenlearnathome.co.uk/</a> to get you on the track.<br/>
<br/>
To quote briefly from the site &quot;Our aim is not to criticise schools or to advocate home education to families.  Our interest lies purely in how children learn for themselves: what things they are interested in and why, and how they then go about exploring them.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552224029">Paula Rothermel at the University of Durham has done research into home education that includes autonomous education approaches (the UK&#39;s closest equivalent to unschooling) in the analyses <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.rothermel/.">http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.rothermel/.</a> She home-educates her children, or at least she has in the past so her research begins with that bias. There is an article here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.infed.org/biblio/home-education.htm">http://www.infed.org/biblio/home-education.htm</a> that has lots of citations that might help you to do further research. I got that article from a blogpost at Dare to Know: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://daretoknowblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/autonomous-education-works.html.">http://daretoknowblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/autonomous-education-works.html.</a> She has some ideas about why someone looking to research to justify an autonomous approach (again, the UK&#39;s closest equivalent to unschooling) might have a hard time doing so. <br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a lot of research directly on alternative approaches to home-education. There isn&#39;t any real reason to examine such a small subset of the population. It isn&#39;t something for which funding is readily available so anyone approaching it would have to be doing it for personal reasons as much as for any other reason. That means for you that you will never have more research behind an unschooling approach than he will have behind a more traditional education approach.  It means that you can&#39;t win if you see it as a fight. <br/>
<br/>
The way a list like this works is by amassing a lot of personal experience and sharing it. It is anecdotal evidence, but in huge numbers. The way unschooling often works to comfort the partner who is less confident about it as a means to educate his or her children is by being this amazing relationship builder. It helps a lot if you have helped your partner to feel involved in his children&#39;s lives. Talking about things that they&#39;ve done, keeping a journal or a blog, those kinds of daily stories that talk about a rich and engaging life make a huge difference in the way someone who is less integrally involved in the day-to-day can see it all unfolding. <br/>
<br/>
I am guessing that your husband is really excited by all that he is reading and doing. He is so excited at the different pedagogical approaches to knowledge transfer (I love that piece of jargon that is used in universities in the UK, they don&#39;t call it teaching they call it knowledge transfer) and he wants so very much to enrich his children&#39;s lives. And to protect them from failure as adults. He wants them to do well and believes that the evidence he is finding argues that the best outcome will come from a more traditional approach to knowledge transfer. One thing that might make a huge difference in how he sees unschooling is going to an unschooling conference. Seeing families interacting with their children and children interacting within their families, it is so amazing. Listening to people talk about unschooling and talk about how it works in their households, seeing it as a working, applied approach to education, it is a powerful thing. There are<br/>
 a lot about these days, there might be one around the corner from you. And if you are like us, you can travel. We&#39;re flying from the UK to Sea-Tac this year to go to Life is Good in Vancouver, Washington. As well as taking the train to a conference in London. <br/>

We don&#39;t have/need a whole lot of arbitrary structure, though our lives have<br/>
a nice rhythm to the days.  Only as much chaos as we can take ;)<br/>
There are many many examples of vastly different typical days at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
and there are many of us who keep blogs, usually adding the address in our<br/>
signatures.  Blogs are a great way to peek into unschooling life, to quell<br/>
some of those fears.<br/>

Unschooling starts to work several months AFTER people stop  <br/>
vascillating.   If you were travelling the world but you didn&#39;t know  <br/>
where you wanted to go, you wouldn&#39;t ever get there.   So if you want  <br/>
unschooling (and it&#39;s definitely a thing worth wanting), what helps is  <br/>
looking at your own decisions each time you make one.  And start  <br/>
learning to make decisions.  People think they know that, but it turns  <br/>
out they can put themselves in an automatic &quot;have to&quot; mode and go for  <br/>
days without deciding ANYthing.<br/>
<br/>
So start to see your life as a series of decisions, and then give  <br/>
yourself options.  Think of two things before you move or speak or  <br/>
do.  Then do the one that will take you closer to good relationships  <br/>
and natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
While this is happening, let your children do what they want to.   <br/>
Focus on your own actions and reactions, and move toward more  <br/>
conscious thought and conscious living.<br/>

I know this is normal for boys -- especially little ones  - but it seems that if I don&#39;t have something for them to do every minute of the day, they drive everyone else crazy with their wild behavior.  This isn&#39;t an obedience issue, meaning it&#39;s not rebelliousness -- just a lack of self-government, I believe would be the best way to describe it.  <br/>

This may not be realistic, but opposite of chaos would also mean, to me, no yelling, shouting, stomping or screaming (the boys&#39; favorite activities, it seems).  I realize they&#39;re boys and this is natural -- I just grew up with ALL girls, no boys, not even a father in the house, and two of my boys&#39; temperaments run counter to everything in me.  It&#39;s especially difficult when it&#39;s been raining outside, on and off, for nearly two weeks.  Thanks for listening.  :)  And thanks for the website about the days of unschoolers; I&#39;m sure that will help.<br/>

&gt; We don&#39;t have/need a whole lot of arbitrary structure, though our lives<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; a nice rhythm to the days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rhythm is the word I think of, too, that gives some form to our lives<br/>
without being binding or limiting. With a combination of big kids and little<br/>
kids/babies in our family, our days fall into a natural rhythm involving<br/>
meals, naps, and out-of-the-house activities, but there isn&#39;t a fixed or<br/>
rigid routine that must be followed at all costs. We can change the beat as<br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
For example, my kids like to eat breakfast before my husband leaves for<br/>
work, because he&#39;s busy in the kitchen for a while making his coffee and<br/>
such, and they like to spend that chunk of time with him before he&#39;s gone<br/>
for the day. You could look at us from the outside and say, &quot;Wow, your<br/>
family eats breakfast at 8am every day, that&#39;s really structured!&quot;--but it<br/>
isn&#39;t a *required* structure, and it&#39;s no big deal if someone feels like<br/>
sleeping later, or is lying in bed reading a book instead of eating<br/>
breakfast at that time of day. (Well, it might be a big deal if *I* did<br/>
that, because it would be hard for my hubby to get ready for work AND meet<br/>
all the needs of the 5yo, the 2yo, and the baby while I was snoozing!) The<br/>
kids are free to start the day off as they wish, and it happens that they<br/>
usually all wish to be in the kitchen with daddy at that time of day.<br/>
<br/>
I think rhythm can be organic, a pattern that grows out of what suits your<br/>
family&#39;s needs and preferences, but it need not be inflexible or binding.<br/>
Rhythm can be nice and comfortable, and comforting (especially, I think, for<br/>
very young children). But even though our days have a general rhythm, I<br/>
don&#39;t think any one day is exactly like any other, and the cadences can<br/>
always change.<br/>

It&#39;s a hard idea to get, but getting away from &quot;control&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;government&quot; and &quot;regulation&quot; altogether can put you in a place where  <br/>
there&#39;s nothing lift but choices, and that&#39;s the place to be for  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Easy&quot; isn&#39;t always best for unschooling.    As you move more into  <br/>
seeing what learning can look like in a really busy life, you might  <br/>
see things like &quot;constructive&quot; and &quot;productive&quot; in new ways!    <br/>
Something can be learned during a busy &quot;chaotic&quot; moment that lasts for  <br/>
a lifetime, and a solid hour of what might be called constructive and  <br/>
productive might not yield any learning.   That&#39;s fine, because  <br/>
there&#39;s more to life than learning all the time, but if you can change  <br/>
the angle from which you see all these little things, you&#39;ll see more  <br/>
and more learning all the time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like a really cool classroom.   Up to the &quot;while I could move  <br/>
around freely&quot; it sounded like a cool unschooling day!<br/>
<br/>
Finding things to do with one or more of the kids will work better  <br/>
than hoping they&#39;ll each find a separate thing to do that you can  <br/>
check on and encourage.<br/>
<br/>
Meaningful conversations can happen in and around all that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543520808">Thanks for your encouragement.  It was prob. at least 8 or 9 years ago when I read one of John Holt&#39;s book, and I dont&#39; really remember much of it.  I just checked at our local library and they have 3 copies -- looks like we&#39;re going today!<br/>
<br/>
I feel like on the beginning of our homeschool journey, we did lean more toward unschooling.  I don&#39;t know what happened.  I think I got fearful of the government checking up on us, etc.  My homeschooling neighbor had Social Services come to her door questioning, and that made me want to be more formal with schooling in case that happened to us.  <br/>
<br/>
The control issue is a big one, too, like you mentioned Sandra.  It&#39;s so difficult to let go and trust that they&#39;ll learn in spite of me!  But, compared to the average homeschooler, we would be seen as too relaxed, as I&#39;ve been told by well-meaning people.  We just didn&#39;t finish going in the right direction far enough!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the tips -- I&#39;m going to reread them all, and am checking on the websites you all mentioned, as well as re-reading John Holt&#39;s book.  My week is planned!  lol.  I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.  :)   Jimi Ann</div>

&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I had a girl who is like you describe your boys - very <br/>
rambunctious and high energy. VERY!!! When she was two years old, we <br/>
were at an outdoor picnic/barbeque and a father of many ( I&#39;ve <br/>
forgotten, but I think they had 12 kids) said to ME, &quot;Boy, you have your <br/>
hands full with her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - it might be more common for boys to be physically active and high <br/>
energy like that, but it isn&#39;t only boys.<br/>
<br/>
I think the self-government (and unruly) phrasing gives something away <br/>
here, that the op might not be aware of. I think you&#39;re thinking of the <br/>
daughter as BEING self-government and &quot;ruly&quot; - but, no, it is just her <br/>
own nature to be quieter, less physical, more project-oriented, and <br/>
therefore &quot;easier.&quot; She isn&#39;t having to &quot;govern&quot; herself - she IS the <br/>
way she is.<br/>
<br/>
So - you&#39;re really expecting something from the other kids that you are <br/>
NOT expecting or seeing in her. You&#39;re expecting kids with tons of <br/>
energy, very physical kids, to act like one who isn&#39;t like that by nature.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids need a whole lot more physical activity than others - they <br/>
need parents to provide a lot more things for them to do. They need you <br/>
to even get out there and play those physical things with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could take them to a nearby playground for several hours every <br/>
day.<br/>
A Wii and a balance board could be very very fun for them. Rock band?<br/>
A trampoline in the back yard? Big playset with swings and a slide, etc? <br/>
A ping pong table?<br/>
<br/>
Skateboards and ramps? Building materials? A pool? A soccer goal and <br/>
ball? Basketball hoop in the driveway?<br/>
tetherball pole/rope/ball? A dog? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690805985">Thank you so much, Pam, for that very much needed perspective.  The part about her not having to govern herself, that she IS the way she is, rings so true to my ears.  And yes, expectations.  That&#39;s a biggie for me.  I need to re-read a book I got several years ago called &quot;Slowing Down to the Speed of Life.&quot;  I had forgotten about that.<br/>
<br/>
With my family&#39;s background, and the paths we&#39;ve pursued in the past, we need a lot undoing. My childhood was pretty much in the unschooling way of things, as far as lots of freedom, no expectations, etc.  But along with that came neglect and very little to no parental direction, as there were usually no adults in the home.<br/>
<br/>
Because of that, and my bad choices in my 20&#39;s (By the way, Sandra, I also attended Al-Anon meetings and learned a lot.  We added S to the end of HALT, for Sick -- meaning physically sick)... Anyway, I was drawn to very structured environments, because of the lack of any kind of structure whatsoever in my childhood.  I had felt very lonely and isolated.  From that, I believe, is where I developed a great desire for structure and control.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve just come out from what I call &quot;our mennonite adventure,&quot; and we joined and lived among a strict group of mennonites (like the Amish but still drive cars).  Mine and my husband&#39;s deep Christian beliefs (not mainstream, and it prob. doesn&#39;t look much like Christianity as the average American Christian sees it -- although that&#39;s ok however one chooses to believe, I just say this to give you perspective on us), my stance on non-resistance, among many other things led us that way.  Also the simpler lifestyle, getting rid of a lot of needless things, and moving away from the world of affluence voluntarily -- also led us to the mennonites.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we were very stifled and came to realize we can still have these beliefs, practice these principles in our own way, without being with the mennonites.  Sounds like a no-brainer now, but we didn&#39;t see it then.  We were where we were.  <br/>
<br/>
The children being in the one-room schoolhouse (just like the Amish) seemed so carefree and a such a beautiful alternative.  They had 3 recesses a day, never assigned homework, and were not so heavy on the academics.  But despite all these seemingly wonderful things, it was a real eye-opener.   It was the first time they had ever been in school, and the last.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much any of you know about the conservative branches of mennonites, but they are very controlling.  We&#39;ve been out of that setting coming up on a year now, and my shoulders are starting to relax a bit.  This is prob. more than you wanted to know, but I feel by sharing it, it would help people here see where I&#39;m coming from.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing, I think I&#39;m having a great unschooling day today!  ALthough it is a little by default.  I developed a fever lastnight over 102, and my throat was &quot;closing up&quot; and I had a hard time swallowing.  I feel a little better today, but this has truly been a blessing in disguise, in that the children are leading themselves today.  I did have a chance to pick up 2 books from the library yesterday before I felt too ill -- one on unschooling by Mary Griffith, and one by John Holt, which I am devouring and already putting some of it into practice.  The fact that I can barely talk above a whisper is a real blessing in that it&#39;s difficult to control things without a voice!  LOL.  So I&#39;m grateful that I got sick.  :)  Maybe I will chronicle our day after the day is done, if anyone is interested.  You can tell me if you think we&#39;re making progress or not and give me helpful hints and insights if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all of your great insights.  Pam, you hit the nail right on the head, I believe.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, you&#39;re definitely searching, Jimi Ann, for a way to live that <br/>
feels right to you! I&#39;m always impressed with people who are willing <br/>
carry their beliefs to their logical conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
Do not think of your own childhood as having anything at all to do with <br/>
unschooling. Sounds like the opposite. Unschooling requires tremendous <br/>
amounts of parental involvement. Without that, it really is not <br/>
unschooling. Thinking of your own childhood as having any kind of <br/>
unschooling nature will hold you back in getting to a strong <br/>
understanding of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re craving structure and control, I have a couple of suggestions <br/>
for you, to help you get over that &lt;G&gt;.  First, keep a journal or <br/>
private blog in which you write your own observations about your <br/>
children. Make it only for your own eyes, so that you don&#39;t have to put <br/>
any kind of public face on it. Observe what lights up your child&#39;s eyes. <br/>
Observe what seemed to frustrate him/her. Take note of how he goes about <br/>
getting what he wants. Look at how they interact with each other. Etc. <br/>
Think of this as being a scientist, out in the field, observing these <br/>
young creatures in their natural environment.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, try to support them in living as natural a life as <br/>
possible, for them. If you are observing that running and jumping seems <br/>
to be what they want - find ways to support running and jumping. When <br/>
you&#39;re writing in your journal on blog, jot down ideas of how you could <br/>
support their natural inclinations.<br/>
<br/>
You might also need to consider whether or not your own religious <br/>
beliefs might interfere with this whole concept of supporting a child&#39;s <br/>
natural inclinations, though. I&#39;m not asking you to tell us about them, <br/>
just suggesting that you might consider that one of the most basic <br/>
beliefs of unschoolers is that human beings are inherently &quot;good&quot; in <br/>
many ways. For some devout Christians, that flies in the face of their <br/>
belief that humans are born with a &quot;sin nature.&quot;<br/>

in children turn out to be spectacularly valuable in adults. <br/>
&quot;Self-Appointed Captains&quot; are often like that. Another word for it is <br/>
leadership ability - and, think about it, do you really want to squash that?<br/>
<br/>
I had what people would call a bossy child. Yes, I needed to put a LOT <br/>
of attention and energy into helping her know how to channel that into <br/>
productive directions, how not to sort of bully other people (not <br/>
physically, but persuasively). Some of the ways this attribute has <br/>
helped her though - being &quot;out there&quot; - standing out - willing to step <br/>
forward and say, &quot;I&quot;ll do that.&quot; She&#39;s gotten jobs, she&#39;s gotten <br/>
unexpected honors - including college scholarships for leadership that <br/>
she didn&#39;t apply for and didn&#39;t even know existed. She was president of <br/>
her college student association - which was &quot;Recreation and Leisure <br/>
Studies&quot; a group made up almost entire of leader types! She was hired by <br/>
Grace Llewelyn a couple of times to work at Not Back to School Camp - <br/>
that was a great experience for her to really examine and develop her <br/>
leadership skills. She now directs a program that provides activities <br/>
and excursions for adults with developmental disabilities and that <br/>
involves being in charge of MANY other people - clients, employees, <br/>
interns, and volunteers.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - when she was 5 and ordering her younger and older cousins <br/>
around, she was bossy and sometimes annoying to them, but they STILL <br/>
turned to her as their leader because she was full of good ideas and her <br/>
ideas worked.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a good idea to change the way we see these characteristics <br/>
- at least recognize the value in them. I&#39;m not saying it is a reason to <br/>
let one kid run roughshod over another, but by allowing and supporting <br/>
natural relationships that develop that do involve some kids taking on <br/>
leadership roles. Just - help them do it more nicely and help them think <br/>
about the interests of those they are leading.<br/>
<br/>
Help your son, for example, feel like part of his &quot;captain&quot; job is to <br/>
consider the safety of his troops.<br/>

It can help to make the noisiest one in charge of keeping the noise  <br/>
down sometimes (party situations or whatever).  Longterm  <br/>
responsibility isn&#39;t good or fair, but temporary &quot;please make sure  <br/>
everyone gets a napkin and a drink&quot; or something can put  <br/>
organizational skills to work.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby could tend to hog a party when he was little so I would ask him  <br/>
to do what he could to make sure the birthday kid was getting enough  <br/>
attention and that everyone was being include.  He could do that!<br/>

at once when I was younger (21-23) and I was trying to figure it out  <br/>
all of a sudden.   I didn&#39;t lie, and I didn&#39;t ground, but I&#39;ve yelled  <br/>
and shamed and hit.   Even my own kids, I&#39;ve hit, when they were  <br/>
little, and I couldn&#39;t figure out a better thing to do in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily I found the company of people who knew more and had thought  <br/>
more about it than I did and I used them as models for ways to be  <br/>
better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077721348"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That sort of thinking is the excuse many use to punish, control, spank,<br/>
&gt; and manipulate children.  I don&#39;t know why it still surprises me that<br/>
&gt; this is so, I&#39;ve heard the arguments and seen people behave like this so<br/>
&gt; many times, you&#39;d think I&#39;d stop being surprised by the meanness of<br/>
&gt; parents.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even when people stop going to church, or having religious beliefs, they<br/>
&gt; still hold onto those patterns of behavior, with this misguided notion<br/>
&gt; that they must create children that are responsible. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear what you&#39;re saying.  I didn&#39;t have a religious upbringing at all, never went to church or started seeking spiritually until my late 20&#39;s (over 15 years ago). So my spiritual beliefs were sought out on my own as an adult.  I didn&#39;t really have a basis or pre-conceived religious ideas, for where to start -- so I searched through many, many different paths over the years.  <br/>
<br/>
I was rarely, if at all, punished growing up and never received a spanking.  My sisters, on the other hand, did receive punishment in anger (as opposed to loving direction when needed -- which, by the way, I didn&#39;t receive either), and I can see the fear behind the heavy walls.  I have fears too, of course, to a varying degree, but it&#39;s getting much better.  I do believe that anger is one of the worst enemies, especially when directed toward a child.  It can wear many masks. I have struggled with that, wearing the mask of frustration and impatience, and am working on this character defect.  I believe that a lack of love and humility (selfishness) also breeds anger or frustration, to the person being selfish, I mean, in that his expected desires are not satisfied.  We know how that spills over onto the children.  (I read a saying in a fiction book once that said, &quot;We teach best what we most need to learn!&quot;)  :)<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would respectfully question, though, is do you not think children should be responsible?  Can we/should we raise responsible children, through example, and other avenues besides manipulation, punishment and control?  (Any tips on this would be greatly appreciated!) A relevant question might be what is our definition of responsible.   I&#39;m sorry to be so long in my posts -- maybe I&#39;ll try to pare them down a bit. Jimi Ann</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023624226">Yes, Pam, I agree.  I often tell him he will be a great leader and God has something very great and wonderful in store for him, even now.  Thanks for reminding me of that -- sometimes we forget and get off track.  I need to think on that more often.<br/>
<br/>
What a great perspective you shared about having him consider that as a captain for him to consider the safety of his troops.  I&#39;ll do that.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366104344">-=-One thing I would respectfully question, though, is do you not  <br/>
think children should be responsible?...  A relevant question might be  <br/>
what is our definition of responsible. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s only use dictionary definitions here!    The root of  <br/>
&quot;responsible&quot; is &quot;respond.&quot;  Answer.  Answerable to.   When someone is  <br/>
responsible, it means he&#39;s answerable to someone else for whatever it  <br/>
is the &quot;responsibility&quot; is.  If I&#39;m responsible for the key to a  <br/>
building, or the safety of my children, or responsible for taking care  <br/>
of the money at the gate of an event, it means those are not MY keys/ <br/>
building/lives/money, and I need to answer to others for the way I  <br/>
took care of them.<br/>
<br/>
So what should children be responsible for?  (Not asking the question,  <br/>
just saying that&#39;s what &quot;responsible&quot; means.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Responsible&quot; as a personal attribute is like &quot;respectable&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;honorable.&quot;   It involves the potential for trust.<br/>
<br/>
All of my kids have been house sitters.   All of my kids, all of those  <br/>
home owners and dog owners, and probably all of you here know some  <br/>
people you would trust with your house, and some you would *not* trust  <br/>
with your house.  It&#39;s not a simple set of traits that make or break  <br/>
&quot;responsibility,&quot; though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As responsible as they can be, yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Can we/should we raise responsible children, through example, and other avenues besides manipulation, punishment and control?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. I have done it - so I can say that it is very definitely <br/>
possible. I have three &quot;kids&quot; - 18, 21, and 24. They are VERY <br/>
responsible young adults - incredibly so. Never punished or controlled <br/>
or manipulated through threats or bribes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your posts are great, Jimi Ann. I&#39;m enjoying them a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on my way out the door and &quot;What does responsible mean?&quot; is too big <br/>
a question to answer in the 30 seconds I have available. But - good <br/>
question!<br/>
