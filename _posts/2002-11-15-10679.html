<div id="ygrps-yiv-60286262">I have a favor to ask of everyone here, and anyone else you might know that <br/>
is unschooling.<br/>
I realize a lot of you are alone in your area, but if you do have an <br/>
alternative learning group anywhere in your state that is inclusive, could <br/>
you please email me the information or a link?<br/>
I am trying very hard to help Kent with the Atlearn map (that will link ALL <br/>
natural learning/inclusive groups over the world) but am having trouble.<br/>
It seems many of the groups listed at NHEN are now defunct or not responding. <br/>
I&#39;ve tried several and not gotten a response.<br/>
So if anyone is willing to help me out with information that I could add to <br/>
the site, I&#39;d deeply appreciate it!!!  SOS in SC is listed already, but I <br/>
sure could use help with the other states.<br/>

I sent California groups to the address you gave when you first posted <br/>
about this -- tried to send them directly to you, privately, but the email <br/>
bounced.<br/>
<br/>
The groups currently listed are pretty clearly not natural <br/>
learning/unschooling only, you know that right?<br/>

Hi, Ren --<br/>
<br/>
When I looked at the map recently I noticed only one of the three<br/>
statewide groups for California was listed.<br/>
<br/>
I belong to HSC, which sponsored the Sacramento conference that Sandra<br/>
spoke at.<br/>
<br/>
Their website&#39;s homepage is   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a><br/>

<br/>
Well, I don&#39;t know for sure about these groups, except I am not getting <br/>
responses from some of them. One bounced the email and the phone number was <br/>
disconnected.<br/>
<br/>
The email you sent Kent about the Cali groups also got to me, so I&#39;m not sure <br/>
why you got a bounce notice? Weird.<br/>
<br/>
I am only writing to the groups that have an inclusive/alternative statement <br/>
describing their group. Then I&#39;m writing to make sure it&#39;s still that way and <br/>
see if they want to be listed. After they write back I forward them on to <br/>
Kent.<br/>
It&#39;s not easy finding groups with this criteria. I REALLY appreciate everyone <br/>
that has written to tell me of groups in your area.<br/>
It helps immensely!<br/>
