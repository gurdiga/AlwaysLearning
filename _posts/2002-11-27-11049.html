&lt;&lt; Mary said they might only be in the front row.  Any updates now that it&#39;s <br/>
 been taped? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw her!<br/>
They ran the two minute segment of Mary in her home with her three dd&#39;s (ds <br/>
didn&#39;t want to be on tv, so he avoided the cameras). They called her a &quot;stay <br/>
at home mother of four&quot; but didn&#39;t mention homeschooling at all.<br/>
A very beautiful family!  I was surprised that Tara had image hang ups, being <br/>
so pretty and all...but then it&#39;s never about how one really looks. It&#39;s <br/>
those dang messages in our heads eh?<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Darn it.<br/>
<br/>
Marty wheeled me over to Hollywood Video about 3:00, and then everyone else <br/>
left (Keith to take Kirby to karate and Holly to a birthday party in another <br/>
town, and In the quiet that ensued I just threw in a movie and worked on <br/>
Thinking Sticks I&#39;ve owed for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like a dope!  It was at 4:00, and I had total peace and could&#39;ve <br/>
watched it, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
I need a secretary.<br/>

Darin was shocked to come home to see me on the couch watching! (a commercial <br/>
was on and he asked me if a special ER or Law and Order was on. &lt;g&gt;) I <br/>
thought Mary and her girls were beautiful! What pretty hair they all have. A <br/>
lovely family and home!<br/>
