<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630855794">So, how do you handle family get togethers where words such as<br/>

 From what little you told us, it sounded as though you got fed up  <br/>
with adults being judgmental and critical of the kids.<br/>

Well if you&#39;re still angry, and you were brave (or angry) enough to  <br/>
say something in defense of children, don&#39;t worry so much about your  <br/>
sister in law right now, and let her think about what you said.  I  <br/>
hope your apologies weren&#39;t in the form of taking back your opinion,  <br/>
but were just for the presentation.  If you defended children&#39;s  <br/>
rights and needs and goodness and she objects to those ideas, that&#39;s  <br/>
nothing to apologize about (at least in the scenario I&#39;ve imagined,  <br/>
which isn&#39;t likely to be exactly what happened at all &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948269190">thank you sandra.<br/>
<br/>
I was only apologizing for my voice tone, not what I said.  I truly<br/>
believe she wasn&#39;t hurt by my words, only uncomfortable by my<br/>
confronting those hard held &quot;teaching&quot; attitudes and &quot;parental&quot; ideas<br/>
she has held for so long.<br/>
She wasn&#39;t attacking my kids--complaining about her job and &quot;her&quot; kids<br/>
in her classroom.<br/>
An example was: she expects her kids to hold their urine until the<br/>
next bathroom break.  I asked her why it was ok and not demeaning to<br/>
those kids to have peed their pants in class.<br/>
<br/>
Such as the above.  I&#39;ve been hs for 14 years.  My kids are considered<br/>
well educated, kind, etc.  And they are.  But only because of<br/>
unschooling and good family dynamics.  If my sil only knew the real<br/>
reason :) She wouldn&#39;t understand unschooling, barely gets &quot;hs&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473499854">Hi Tina, <br/>
Good for you for standing up to family members! So hard to do, for me<br/>
anyway. And although I admire your 14 y.o.&#39;s level head (&quot;not judge&quot;),<br/>
there is always a judgement if we believe that some things hurt<br/>
children and that hurting children is immoral. It is where relativism<br/>
fails us (i.e. all choices are valid). <br/>
<br/>
The closest I have come to handling these situations well is by<br/>
sticking with simple but strong statements about my family&#39;s values.<br/>
Some family members are only looking for a quick dig, a chance to<br/>
express their disaproval. If they were genuinely curious you&#39;d know<br/>
it, and that would be different. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a recent interaction I had with the most negative critic in my<br/>
family. My visiting sister commented on the local school as we drove<br/>
past and said in a scoffing tone: <br/>
<br/>
-&quot;So that&#39;s where she&#39;d go if you were going to let her have a normal<br/>
life.&quot;  <br/>
-Me: &quot;No, that&#39;s where she&#39;d go if we were interested in sending her<br/>
to Obedience Camp.&quot;  <br/>
-Sister: &quot;Well, maybe she could *use* a little more obedience.&quot;  (Red<br/>
herring and unwarranted insult all rolled into one.)  <br/>
-Me: &quot;Obedience is NOT a virtue.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
That was the end of it, and we rode along in uncomfortable silence. <br/>
<br/>
To be sure, invoking Morality costs us some closeness, but for me the<br/>
kind of family members who provoke it are not as close as I want to<br/>
believe.  Especially with people who have been in your life for so<br/>
long -- you know who is open to discussion and who is just trying to<br/>
hurt.     <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long post, but in summary, I don&#39;t like to dignify the<br/>
hit-and-run insults with heated debate. Stick with short replies that<br/>
are morality-based, like &quot;children deserve the same respect as you<br/>
do,&quot; and &quot;conformity is not education,&quot; and &quot;I will never choose the<br/>
mainstream if I feel it harms my child.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my long post. Since I struggle with this too, your<br/>
story invoked strong emotions for me. Good luck. <br/>

<br/>
This is important to repeat, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I let some friendships go because the other adults hadn&#39;t done much  <br/>
or any thinking about children, or teens, and seemed unable to  <br/>
converse without saying things that made me think they were idiots  <br/>
(or saying things that I didn&#39;t want my kids to hear, or that just  <br/>
offended me).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need to re-train my friends, nor do I need to put up with  <br/>
anti-child noise.<br/>
There are lots of people in the world.  They can find other anti- <br/>
child friends (unfortunately), or friends who aren&#39;t really listening  <br/>
to them when they make their snarky comments anyway, and I can find  <br/>
more thoughtful and respectful friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943475443">i have found when you live passionately (no matter the subject) you will always encounter those &quot;relatives&quot;. the key is simply holding your &quot;stew&quot; and answering simply and confidently. of course that is very very hard to do but it IS possible. usually there isn&#39;t much productivity in arguing. when you argue, you bring yourself to a level of those of a closed mind. you can&#39;t open anyones mind until they are willing and if they are willing then you are able to communicate respectively even upon disagreeing. you&#39;ve handled yourself well by apologizing, its done on your end. move on.<br/>
