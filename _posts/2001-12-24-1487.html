All in all, I find this thread and this board a little stale as of late. <br/>
Where is everyone? Where are the interesting conversations we&#39;ve come to <br/>
expect? Is unschooling falling out of favor? <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m a diehard unschooler because I intend to hold firm to the opinion <br/>
that unschooling really is the best way to go. Perhaps others are secure in <br/>
their beliefs as well and do not feel the need to check in regularly. <br/>
Whatever the case may be, let&#39;s do what we can to make sure unschooling is <br/>
presented to new-comers in a fair and accurate way so that this valuable <br/>
learning philosophy can endure. <br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone here posted this, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
But I do hope that some of the great writers here who haven&#39;t been on <br/>
www.unschooling.com for whatever reason will consider going there from time <br/>
to time to help new people understand it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fine for us to have this list, or other list, where we can word-wrestle <br/>
and tell stories with people who are already convinced and comfortable <br/>
unschoolers.  I like it.  But for any of you who remember how it felt to be a <br/>
new unschooler or who realize that something you say could make the <br/>
difference between a family putting kids back in school or keeping on making <br/>
them &quot;do their work&quot; or changing their relationship entirely, please check in <br/>
once in a while to help us help newcomers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175030722">I hope that&#39;s not the case. I&#39;m guesing that it&#39;s just the holidays and that <br/>
everyone is too busy to be on the boards. It HAS been rather quiet this week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-401563230">I noticed the &quot;kiss of life&quot; post this morning and thought of you and your <br/>
Christmas wish, Sandra. Not that I consider myself one of the great writers <br/>
here, but I did manage to fufill your wish in a small way yesterday. My name <br/>
is all over the &quot;last day&#39;s posts&quot; for today. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s definitely an indulgence to be on this list, having these <br/>
conversations, though. With some fancy typing skills, maybe I can keep up <br/>
with both. :-D<br/>
<br/>
Wishing a magical Christmas to all! See you at unschooling.com.<br/>
