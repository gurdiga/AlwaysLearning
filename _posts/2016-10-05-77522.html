<div id="ygrps-yiv-220109390">A tweet by Holly, who is 24.  I’m inspired to bring it because many of those here have heard me speak in the past two months+ (HSC conference, four and a half meet-ups in England, Free to Be) and I’ve mentioned Holly in various ways.   So here are her thoughts eight hours ago:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Time now to face my rage, break the cage, turn the page, burn some sage, learn what pays, make a wage, hop on stage, or act my age.”<br/>
<br/>
She has had some frustrations and disappointments this summer, and has been very helpful to me lately, so I’m going to go and make her some food and do some things to make her comfortable today.<br/>
<br/>
I want to acknowledge and thank those who have shared stories back, in public settings, that let me know that my years of reporting on my family’s doings has been helpful to some people.  Seeing lives unfold without school isn’t always readily available, but through groups like this one, and due to the willingness of some of the participants to write up some thoughts and progress, there are people who get help who might never write a word.  I’ve met some of them.  <br/>
