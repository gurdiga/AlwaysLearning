I got this from an SCA list I&#39;m on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Darth Vader, having been posted (in his younger days) as a guard  <br/>
on Endor, where he meets King Arthur, and...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of other situations in which one needs to know two  <br/>
things in fair detail before the juxtaposition of them can be useful  <br/>
(funny, profound, whatever).<br/>
<br/>
One current example is that Prince has recorded a Joni Mitchell  <br/>
song.  For those who know Joni Mitchell&#39;s music and history well, and  <br/>
who are very familiar with Prince and his own musical styles and  <br/>
abilities, it&#39;s WONDERFUL.  Someone hearing it without knowing either  <br/>
as a songwriter or as a singer would probably just shrug and be  <br/>
confused.  You can get it from iTunes for 99cents.  &quot;A Case of You,&quot;  <br/>
written by Joni Mithcell and performed by Prince, from a Joni  <br/>
Mitchell tribute album which hasn&#39;t gotten very good reviews outside  <br/>
of this one track and another couple are sometimes mentioned.<br/>
