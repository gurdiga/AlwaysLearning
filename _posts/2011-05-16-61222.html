<div id="ygrps-yiv-532866413">I have a 3 and a 4 year old (boys). Popular in our house:<br/>
<br/>
Peppa Pig (really very good app)<br/>
Dora the Explorer (rainbow ride- good for colour I think)<br/>
Monkey Lunch Box<br/>
When I Grow Up (dressing up game)<br/>
Fairy Trails- very clever- uses the camera so you can hunt fairies and butterflies in your own living room<br/>
Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, World of Goo etc are popular and good for playing together.<br/>
<br/>
He may like the Big Green Rabbit songs on youTube: search for &#39;Green Anaconda Song&#39;, &#39;Spider Monkey Song&#39; and you&#39;ll be led to others. Mine also love the dinosaur song, one thousand steps, umbrella bird and the iguana song.<br/>
