You could go there to see it with the flower, but here&#39;s the text of  <br/>
something written today:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s the first flower in MY yard. It&#39;s still working on opening  <br/>
up all the way. The color started to show on the last day of  <br/>
February. On the first day of March, the news said we had set a  <br/>
record for the driest winter in recorded history. The next day it  <br/>
rained�not much, but late afternoon when we were picking Marty up  <br/>
from the airport.<br/>
<br/>
Marty went to Legoland. He paid for his own airfare, and he bought  <br/>
viking Lego with his own debit card. The group outing was organized  <br/>
by Live and Learn Conference attendees and friends of theirs, who  <br/>
formed a mailing list for the western U.S., so there were others  <br/>
there he knew from the conference, and some unschoolers he hadn&#39;t met  <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was at Legoland, it rained. It rained the next day too. It  <br/>
was hot and dry in Albuquerque. By the time Marty&#39;s plane arrived  <br/>
here, it was raining, lightly. He brought photos of Legoland, full of  <br/>
flowers. He said Carlsbad, California, is full of flower-market  <br/>
flowers. We just got the first flower of the season.<br/>
<br/>
When Pam Sorooshian visited in January, I bought some not-quite- <br/>
opened bulbs from Raley&#39;s where Marty works and brought them home so  <br/>
they could open, and later I could plant the bulbs in the yard for  <br/>
next year. Pam didn&#39;t know about forced bulbs, because she has always  <br/>
lived where flowers can bloom all year.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired but content. The past couple of weeks were busy and  <br/>
productive and exhausting. Last night the house had just our family,  <br/>
and all of our family, though Marty and Kirby didn&#39;t see each other,  <br/>
and I went to bed early (for me, 10:00). Holly took care of making  <br/>
sure Marty&#39;s apron for work went into and came out of the dryer. I  <br/>
will thank her profusely, when she wakes up, this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
OH! That reminds me. ElleGirl Magazine will have a half-page article  <br/>
(fullpage, but large stock art of a girl none of us knows) on  <br/>
unschooling in its April issue. The writer spent lots of time on the  <br/>
phone with three families, at least, but it doesn&#39;t much show. Her  <br/>
editor insisted she talk to college admissions officers. She asked me  <br/>
for contacts. I said that Roxana Sorooshian had just spoken with an  <br/>
advisor at St. John&#39;s College in Santa Fe that week, and she might  <br/>
call him. I warned her she was likely to talk to people who knew  <br/>
nothing about unschooling. She did. So along with several wan quotes  <br/>
from the unschoolers she interviewed, she had two more solid (but  <br/>
easily refutable) quotes from a school psychologist and a Harvard  <br/>
admissions person. The unschoolers quoted were Holly, Brenna and  <br/>
Roya. Others named were Kirby, Marty, Sandra and Gail, alll people we  <br/>
know. The other two were add-ons for &quot;balance,&quot; but it wasn&#39;t balance  <br/>
so much as refutation by the unqualified-to-comment. Bummer. It could  <br/>
have been so much better, so easily.<br/>
<br/>
So how do I feel about Holly being used to help sell advertising for  <br/>
glittery eye make-up and studded handbags? If they hadn&#39;t talked to  <br/>
us they would have found other unschoolers. If they hadn&#39;t wasted our  <br/>
time it would&#39;ve been someone else&#39;s. If I&#39;d had a fancier camera,  <br/>
they&#39;d&#39;ve used photos of Holly instead of a stranger lying in a field  <br/>
of flowers. But their magazine is about appearances, and unschooling  <br/>
isn&#39;t much about appearances at all. Probably it just wasn&#39;t a very  <br/>
good match. Those interested in wearing those clothes and that makeup  <br/>
probably need to &quot;stay on track&quot; so they can get jobs writing fluffy  <br/>
articles for New York fashion magazines. The reporter was nice  <br/>
enough, but in the end she got paid real money, while unschooling was  <br/>
shortchanged.<br/>
<br/>
Still, Holly&#39;s life IS peaceful, even though we have only one  <br/>
daffodil and not a field of flowers. Her brothers like her. She sat  <br/>
in the hot tub with both her parents last night (&quot;if it&#39;s okay with  <br/>
you,&quot; she said, when she said she&#39;d like to go in too). She finished  <br/>
her brother&#39;s laundry so he and I could sleep. You can&#39;t photograph  <br/>
that with any camera.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640185167">I have little green tips coming up, but we are weeks away from flowers. And<br/>
today it&#39;s raining ice. I don&#39;t like the cold and ice....but opening the<br/>
door this morning to get my newspaper I was greeting with the sound of ice<br/>
drops falling, in the quiet it sounded very cool......then someone begins to<br/>
attempt to chip the ice off their car and  I was glad I could go back in<br/>
where it&#39;s warm.  The boys and I are in a new 4-H club, our county moved an<br/>
historic barn to the county fairgrounds. It&#39;s 130 years old and absolutely<br/>
beautiful. The club is going to plant heirloom gardens around it. We&#39;ve had<br/>
fun looking up heirloom plants for our area. Karl wants to do herbs, Ben<br/>
wants to find out vegetables. I prefer the flowers. Once we find a few of<br/>
each, we&#39;ll be getting some seeds and tyring to start them inside....just<br/>
like they did 130 years ago. Except that I know a lot of trading of cuttings<br/>
and roots took place for many of the plants....so we&#39;re having fun not just<br/>
learning about the plants, but how did they propagate and how did people<br/>
acquire the plants for their gardens. I&#39;m looking longingly at my little<br/>
plots of land and waiting for spring.....but in the meantime, I&#39;ll grab my<br/>
hot coffee and look at sunny plots of land on-line....and enjoy Sandra&#39;s<br/>
flower!<br/>

of autumn on my nashi tree, just a couple of weeks after picking the <br/>
fruit. The days are still hot enough that I got sunburnt on Tuesday <br/>
while Jeff (15) and I spent the afternoon at the Waitakaruru Arboretum <br/>
and Sculpture Park, but the nights and mornings are chill. I&#39;m hoping <br/>
for an Indian summer though - March is usually our hottest month.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204495281">Very different from my past CA lifestyle (Pam&#39;s neighbor of sorts ;))<br/>

I have lately seen signs of spring, the daffodils (sp?) are coming up<br/>
and the frogs sang me a nighttime melody last night :).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847440231">Not many signs of spring at this altitude yet!  Although it was 61 on <br/>
the bank time/temp yesterday.  When it gets to 60 at this time of year <br/>
it is just teasing us . . . we are the reverse of New Zealand, March <br/>
tends to be our coldest, snowiest month!<br/>
<br/>
So, I am still looking forward to and hoping for some really good snow <br/>
days before the first flowers pop up here.  (And all of you who live <br/>
south of us better to put some energy into this too -- since snow fall <br/>
has been light and water levels are low, it will effect the whole <br/>
Colorado River system. &lt;g&gt; KWIM?)<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I am jealous of the wonderful weather and the flowers that so <br/>
many of you are enjoying!  <br/>
<br/>
All I can tell you about are gail force winds and huge herds mangey <br/>
looking elk grazing under the absolutely pristine, snow topped <br/>
Continental Divide, and flawless blue skies!  <br/>

blossoming under the front bushes.  Aaron was so excited, and proud that <br/>
this year he had spotted it first.  We celebrated with ice cream!<br/>

The trees are starting to bud, the flower bulbs are pushing up greens, and <br/>
my allergies are beginning to really bug me, so yes, spring is on the way.<br/>

&quot;Real, natural learning is in the living. It&#39;s in the observing, the <br/>
questioning, the examining, the pondering, the analyzing, the watching, the <br/>
reading, the DO-ing, the living, the breathing, the loving, the Joy. It&#39;s <br/>
in the Joy.&quot; ~Anne Ohman<br/>
