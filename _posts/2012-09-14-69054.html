<div id="ygrps-yiv-113948720">NOTICE:<br/>
This is about pornography, so anyone who thinks all porn is sin or should all be a crime should just read no more.    The question was brought to me  with a request for anonymity.  I know it will offend some readers.  I don&#39;t think the original poster needs to hear what grandmothers would say.  That&#39;s surely already in her head.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s not discuss it idly.  Anyone who might be offended shouldn&#39;t read it. Anyone without any ideas should just not post.  We can&#39;t change the world into a fantasy world, and there was porn before there was the internet.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I need help with the issue of pornography and my 11 year old son.  A few months ago I came across the fact that my eleven year old had been watching hardcore porn on the internet.   Anime porn, hardcore XXX porn, live webcams, gay, lesbian, gang bang…..etc.  When I spoke with him about the fact that I found porn sites on the computer he became very shy and quiet.  After a while he said that links came up when he played games on the internet and that he clicked them to see what they were.  He then said that he browsed them because he was curious.  I shared with him that there are many ways to satisfy ones curiosity about sex, one of which is hardcore porn, others being books, magazines, articles, soft core porn….  I offered to order resources for him to explore sex.  I explained that hardcore porn objectifies women and is not always a realistic demonstration of what happens in an intimate sexual relationship.  I also explained that sometimes it is what happens, that it just depended on the couple, but that I preferred that he learns about sex using other resources and not hardcore videos. I explained that I preferred he watch other more &quot;gentle&quot;, &quot;humanistic&quot;, &quot;intimate&quot; expressions / videos of sex. I strewed additional resources around the house, I bought Kama Sutra books with very explicit pictures and explanations, I also purchased Jaiya New World Sex Educator&#39;s video on sex, where besides video footage of couples having explicit sex, she also discusses intimacy, touch, arousal, erogenous zones…..etc.  I downloaded her video to his computer so he could feel free to watch it privately.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I browsed his history on the internet and noticed he had been watching hardcore porn again and going into live sex webcam rooms.  I looked at the history a bit more and noticed that he usually watches an hour to two every two or three days; that seems to be the pattern.  I am having a reaction about having hardcore porn be his introduction into the world of sex.  I feel that the visuals in hardcore porn are not appropriate for a child.  My husband and I spoke about it and we are almost at the point where we would like to ask him directly not to watch hardcore porn anymore (not state it as our preference this time, but a direct request to stop watching hardcore porn).  We would like to keep supplying him with internet links that show sex, and videos of sex, but not hardcore XXX stuff.  Can I make this non-negotiable request of him and not cause a &quot;behind your back&quot; phenomenon to start in our household?  Do I have the right as a parent to just stop him from something that causes no harm to anyone around him but that I don&#39;t like because I don&#39;t believe it is ok for an 11 year old?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps one of the draws of the pornography on the internet is that he found it. It feels like &quot;his.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would do is see if any United Church of Christ or Unitarian Universalist churches near you are offering the Our Whole Lives sexuality program for his age. (It&#39;s divided up usually by 2 year spans.) Check this ASAP. The programs should be starting soon.<br/>
<br/>
There was an interesting article in the New York Times about a (regular!) business woman who realized her younger lovers had learned a lot of their moves from pornography. She was inspired to create a website where people could upload videos of actual lovemaking.<br/>
<br/>
Spreading the Word (and Pictures) on ‘Real’ Sex<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/fashion/cindy-gallops-online-effort-to-promote-real-not-porn-fed-sex.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/fashion/cindy-gallops-online-effort-to-promote-real-not-porn-fed-sex.html</a><br/>
<br/>
You might want to read him the beginning of it to let him know that women can tell the difference between lovemaking and pornography and aren&#39;t too pleased with the results. ;-) It will be useful information for him.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I suspect right now at 11 the sensual side of it doesn&#39;t interest him. It&#39;s the physical side. ( But it&#39;s not good, as in the article, if their understanding of the mechanics of sex comes strictly from porn.) When he&#39;s older, and ready for a relationship he will care so it&#39;s good he has access to both.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, again, men actually seem to be wired to need the physical side in their porn. The emotional side is not part of it. At least not in the porn. Generally.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a -- clean! -- story behind that observation ;-) I&#39;ve been drawing a comic for a while and one panel needed a couple locked in a sensual kiss. And I discovered it&#39;s *astonishingly* hard to find clear pictures of that.<br/>
<br/>
During the extensive search I realized two things:<br/>
<br/>
1) Heterosexual men&#39;s porn has no kissing. Men, in fact, hardly even appear in the porn. The only part of the man that&#39;s important is his equipment. ;-) And for the woman, her part is to appear to be deriving physical pleasure from whatever the male equipment is doing to her.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s the biochemistry your son is dealing with. Obviously heterosexual men do kiss in real life! :-) It&#39;s just they don&#39;t need it in their porn. So porn isn&#39;t about lovemaking.<br/>
<br/>
And 2) Gay men&#39;s porn has kissing! (It&#39;s where I finally found my clear pictures ;-) There&#39;s other kinds of sensual touching depicted, not just the pleasuring of equipment ;-) Which I thought was very interesting! It suggests different biochemistry.<br/>
<br/>
3) I have no idea if there&#39;s actual lesbian porn. What&#39;s readily available of women together is probably for heterosexual men since it&#39;s all focused on physical pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
And 4) -- which is separate from the kissing picture research -- many women enjoy reading stories, reading graphic novels of men falling in love with each other and having very graphic sex. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s existed forever, but it &quot;came out of the closet&quot; in the late 70&#39;s when women were able to share their fantasies on line beginning with Star Trek slash fiction between Kirk and Spock ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Sexually speaking, why would women want to read and look at men falling in love and having sex? Biologically speaking it&#39;s a dead end ;-) But the market for &quot;boy&#39;s love&quot; graphic novels (yaoi) is huge. (Google it :-) What&#39;s interesting is generally the men aren&#39;t gay. Partly because it would make the relationships too easy! ;-) But -- and I&#39;ve pondered this for quite a while  ;-) -- I think it has to do with the fact that for the men to fall in love with each other it requires a massive drop of any emotional barriers. I&#39;m guessing women get turned on by emotional vulnerability in men.<br/>
<br/>
What it all comes down to is that sexuality is way more complex than it seems it needs to be ;-) What people like for arousal purposes doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with what they enjoy doing in real life. How many women who enjoyed the early bodice busters where the women were generally raped initially by their eventual husbands, wanted to be raped themselves? If their moms had known exactly what they were reading, would they have been worried about their future ability to have loving sex?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823623026">I do not have a lot of experience with it . My son is 10 and just the other day I shared with him the Scarleteen website.He has seen  Anime porn and told me about some that were disturbing to him.<br/>
<br/>
He gets shy and quiet if one mentions sex sometimes. Sometimes he does not.<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up I remember very well when my younger brother and his friends ( all about that age or a couple years older) would rent out some hardcore or weird porn videos. My parents never made a big deal out of it.<br/>
<br/>
We had many sex books in our library and my parents were pretty open to talking about sex.<br/>
The point is that the boys saw some weird hard core stuff. They were young and curious.<br/>
The good thing was that my brother had my parents to ask questions if he needed and my parents were open to it.<br/>
Today my brother has been married to his wife for 18 yeas and together for 20. He is a healthy man that likes sex but is not into weird stuff. I know because when he was younger he used to ask me and my sister about what women liked and how to be a better partner to them. He came to us to ask advice about his girlfriends when he needed. <br/>
That was pretty cool that my brother could ask his older sisters , me and our other sister, advice about sex when he was in a relationship. It was also because he cared about his partner.<br/>
<br/>
MY point is that watching some hardcore porn did not turn my brother in to a sex addict , porn addict or a man with an unhealthy sex life.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your son has you guys to ask questions and help him find good sources. He maybe just curious about all of it. I do not think making hard core sex a prohibited thing will help him and it could even backfire. <br/>
<br/>
Better to let him know that you are there for him to ask questions. I would also say that porn movie ideas, a lot of times,  comes from fantasies people have and not real life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522517032">I know the original author had seen the link below before, but others reading might not have.  This was the days before my kids had their own computers, as they were older teens, so I have no idea what my boys (now grown men) have on their computers, but I have heard that the oldest is quite gentlemanly, and the younger one has had a girlfriend for nearly four years.<br/>
<br/>
I told him the reason I was asking how long they had been together was that someone had an 11 year old boy looking at porn, and was freaked out, and I wanted to share the link with the story about him when he was younger, and let them know he didn&#39;t grow up to be a pervert.<br/>
<br/>
He said. &quot;Oh, sure.&quot;  (In a cheery supportive way, not in a sarcastic way, at all.)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/sex">http://sandradodd.com/sex</a><br/>
<br/>
I know there are parents who treat pornography like Satan incarnate with his pants off.  (I started to say with his peter out, but that mixes church characters too much; it was a Freudian thought, I guess... but Satan doesn&#39;t wear pants anyways, so it all falls apart.)<br/>
<br/>
I think the reaction of parents who are harsh and punishing toward young boys who are curious about sex is more likely to harm their sex lives than pornography will.  There are boys spanked/whipped, for looking at dirty pictures (by good Christian dads... not healthy).  There are boys who lose all computer privileges, are grounded, forbidden to see the friends they saw porn with/from, for months or a year.  HUGE over-reactions, in my opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
But here is something that can and probably should be said to any unschooled boy who seems too interested in internet porn:  If someone outside the family got wind of it and knew the parents weren&#39;t trying to prevent it, or that the parents had condoned or contributed, that could be trouble with social workers or laws.  There are laws in the U.S. (I don&#39;t know about other places) about adults viewing porn with a child, even a young adult with an older teen.  Sex-offender laws, I mean, which can have (in New Mexico, anyway) repercussions for life.<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, when there were things that were UNACCEPTABLE in mainstream life, I would point out that I didn&#39;t think it was worth getting in trouble with the state about, and we weren&#39;t registered homeschoolers for most of those years, and I wanted to stay fairly quiet.   I know I didn&#39;t seem quiet, writing all the time and speaking at conferences, but the noise I wanted to avoid had to do with what social services and juvenile probation folks care about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428567106">My husband described the feeling he had at about age 10 when the magazines his older brothers had suddenly became very interesting to him, and he couldn&#39;t exactly say why they were interesting yet, but he also couldn&#39;t stop sneaking them from wherever they were hidden.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that&#39;s a pretty powerful concept for a curious child. It may be that that particular biological urge has never been felt so strongly before. I wonder if the repeated viewing is partly a matter of trying to understand why watching body parts do these things together has such a profound effect upon him. <br/>
<br/>
If that were the case, your strewing of other types of materials wouldn&#39;t quite get at what he needed to know (maybe explaining why he&#39;s still watching the videos), though it sounds like you are offering lots of options for exploration once he is ready to move on to something different.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been a facilitator for the middle adolescents class twice, and I can tell you that questions about porn--many styles of porn--come up pretty frequently in the anonymous question box. I always got the impression that the kids were seeking to understand porn&#39;s effect on people and its place in society. It seemed as if they saw it as bizarre, fascinating, silly, and *very compelling* all at once. <br/>

also both soft and hard core porn directed toward lesbian (or questioning)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294075640">When my adult sons were 11  we did not yet have much internet access.   I<br/>
did provide them with the typical stroke mags but also advised them that<br/>
some parents would be VERY upset to know that their sons had such things.<br/>
So to be discreet in how they were shared.<br/>
<br/>
By the time the younger was 13 or 14  we had multiple computers and private<br/>
areas.    I had talked about which images upset me and that while I would<br/>
not restrict what he accessed (as if I could!) I told him it was polite (we<br/>
are Southerners, rudeness is a sin!) to not assault visitors or me with<br/>
images that might be considered shocking if we happened to see the screen.<br/>
That especially applied to screensavers.   And again, that if he planned<br/>
late night porn surfing during overnights he needed to (1) consider the<br/>
parents of his friends and (2) not involve anyone 17 or older in order to<br/>
protect his friends.<br/>
<br/>
I did express that while I expected him to check out various types I did<br/>
hope he would view as a critic and seek high quality stuff.   Also, that<br/>
while he might watch the sex slasher crap now and even enjoy it that I have<br/>
faith he would grow past that.  I think of some of the movies I enjoyed as<br/>
a teen (not sexual porn but what I consider violence porn)  and just<br/>
cringe.<br/>
<br/>
2 hours at a time is not very much for someone in the throes of puberty<br/>
even if it is 2-3 times a week.   I would hope that as the need was<br/>
satisfied the viewing might diminish.   I would make sure my son at 11 knew<br/>
that I was available to answer questions but I would not watch WITH him.<br/>
Don&#39;t think he would have wanted that anyway.   I did tell him that most<br/>
people&#39;s bodies (and performances) don&#39;t look like what you see.    And<br/>
that masturbating is very normal and, actually, a good way to learn about<br/>
your own body.<br/>
<br/>
I am not as averse to porn as some feminists and I don&#39;t think that it is<br/>
like Reefer Madness if anyone remembers that movie.   However I would have<br/>
no problem with saying that I thought too much of anything for a long<br/>
period could be a negative.  But I would not be the enforcer.<br/>
<br/>
Even 20 years ago in my neighborhood, public school kids were becoming<br/>
sexually active in their early teens.   Yes, some girls as young as 11.<br/>
I prefer satisfying curiosity with images instead of dating!   By 11 it is<br/>
time to  talk about respecting girls as well as respecting your own body.<br/>
  And STDs.<br/>

Yeah.... I thought when I wrote that of which grandmothers I was mostly thinking about.  MY grandmothers, born between 1900 and 1910. :-)  And not just born over 100 years ago (one died in the 1970&#39;s and the other in the 1980&#39;s), but Baptist and Nazarene.  Sin sinnedy sin sin SIN.  I do happen to know that my dad and his two brothers were horndogs, as (reportedly) was their dad, my paternal papaw.   My dad would not have sex with a woman before marriage, so he was married four times.  My mom was the only long one, and she was the second one.  Both my uncles discussed their sex lives with me on car trips (because people do talk to me; it happens all the time).  I heard some about my dad&#39;s from various sources, and him.  <br/>
<br/>
Those men ALL could have used some earlier release and calm information!!<br/>
<br/>
Boys used to be punished for touching themselves.  There were bedcovers and such designed to keep them from touching themselves at night.  Some families made their boys sleep with their hands outside the covers, before I was born (and probably after, though I don&#39;t like to think about those poor boys being treated that way).<br/>

In our state (CO) it is a hot issue, and if they found certain types of pornography on your computer, or knew a child was viewing pornography with an adult involved it could be devastating on many levels.<br/>

If there were different ways to meet your sons questions/curiosity, then I&#39;d definitely go those routes over Internet.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306641571"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But here is something that can and probably should be said to any <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;unschooled boy who seems too interested in internet porn:  If someone <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;outside the family got wind of it and knew the parents weren&#39;t trying <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to prevent it, or that the parents had condoned or contributed, that <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;could be trouble with social workers or laws.  There are laws in the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;U.S. (I don&#39;t know about other places) about adults viewing porn with <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a child, even a young adult with an older teen.  Sex-offender laws, I <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mean, which can have (in New Mexico, anyway) repercussions for <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;life.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of some other issues that should be considered. Child <br/>
pornography is illegal even if it is an 11 year old looking at an 11 year <br/>
old. Steer clear of that at all costs because it is a legal issue rather <br/>
than an issue of sin or morality. If somebody were to find that somebody had <br/>
viewed child pornography on our computers or our network, that could lead to <br/>
a whole host of trouble that could ruin a person&#39;s/family&#39;s life. (At least <br/>
in the US.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Computer integrity is something else that should be mentioned. Pornographic <br/>
websites are known for harboring computer viruses and trojan horses. Any <br/>
computer that is used to view pornography should have a really good <br/>
antivirus program. I don&#39;t know if it is as big of an issue on a Mac but I <br/>
know that PC&#39;s are especially prone to getting corrupted and/or compromised <br/>
as a result of some of the questionable porn sites. Google chrome has a <br/>
feature that allows you to view things incognito so that it doesn&#39;t track <br/>
anything or keep any cookies. The less of a footprint that can be left on <br/>
the computer, the better. Some of the porn sites leave really big footprints <br/>
and interfere with normal use.<br/>

have done is make sure that all of our computers are in a common area. If a <br/>

easy to forget that the Internet is not private. It also makes me more <br/>

to share or ask questions, then that is going to impede the flow of <br/>
information. If the child is in another room, then it becomes to easy for me <br/>

I don’t feel a need to check the Internet history because we are all in the <br/>
same room and I have a general idea of what it is going on. I think the <br/>
history checking could potentially set up a situation where there is more <br/>
hiding and more sneaking. The hiding and sneaking and demonizing of porn is <br/>
often what leads to obsessions or addictions.<br/>

<br/>
Coming out is a huge factor in gay sexuality - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to overstate how big a factor it is. Not just coming out to other people, but discovering one has an &quot;atypical&quot; sexuality and learning to deal with that involves actively looking for other examples of other people who are similar. For gay men, in particular, the sight of men kissing other men has a gigantic personal impact - don&#39;t forget that straight men sometimes engage in male-on-male sexual behavior, and that&#39;s part of the mix. A truism of the gay community is that straight men will put out, but they won&#39;t kiss you. So kissing and sensual behavior is part of what defines &quot;gay sex&quot;. In pornography, it&#39;s a way of implying the sex is &quot;real&quot;. It validates the &quot;money shot&quot;. <br/>

&gt; Perhaps one of the draws of the pornography on the internet is that he found it. It feels like &quot;his.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing I would do is see if any United Church of Christ or Unitarian Universalist churches near you are offering the Our Whole Lives sexuality program for his age. (It&#39;s divided up usually by 2 year spans.) Check this ASAP. The programs should be starting soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was an interesting article in the New York Times about a (regular!) business woman who realized her younger lovers had learned a lot of their moves from pornography. She was inspired to create a website where people could upload videos of actual lovemaking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Spreading the Word (and Pictures) on `Real&#39; Sex<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/fashion/cindy-gallops-online-effort-to-promote-real-not-porn-fed-sex.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/fashion/cindy-gallops-online-effort-to-promote-real-not-porn-fed-sex.html</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You might want to read him the beginning of it to let him know that women can tell the difference between lovemaking and pornography and aren&#39;t too pleased with the results. ;-) It will be useful information for him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUT, I suspect right now at 11 the sensual side of it doesn&#39;t interest him. It&#39;s the physical side. ( But it&#39;s not good, as in the article, if their understanding of the mechanics of sex comes strictly from porn.) When he&#39;s older, and ready for a relationship he will care so it&#39;s good he has access to both.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUT, again, men actually seem to be wired to need the physical side in their porn. The emotional side is not part of it. At least not in the porn. Generally.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a -- clean! -- story behind that observation ;-) I&#39;ve been drawing a comic for a while and one panel needed a couple locked in a sensual kiss. And I discovered it&#39;s *astonishingly* hard to find clear pictures of that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; During the extensive search I realized two things:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Heterosexual men&#39;s porn has no kissing. Men, in fact, hardly even appear in the porn. The only part of the man that&#39;s important is his equipment. ;-) And for the woman, her part is to appear to be deriving physical pleasure from whatever the male equipment is doing to her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So that&#39;s the biochemistry your son is dealing with. Obviously heterosexual men do kiss in real life! :-) It&#39;s just they don&#39;t need it in their porn. So porn isn&#39;t about lovemaking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And 2) Gay men&#39;s porn has kissing! (It&#39;s where I finally found my clear pictures ;-) There&#39;s other kinds of sensual touching depicted, not just the pleasuring of equipment ;-) Which I thought was very interesting! It suggests different biochemistry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) I have no idea if there&#39;s actual lesbian porn. What&#39;s readily available of women together is probably for heterosexual men since it&#39;s all focused on physical pleasure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And 4) -- which is separate from the kissing picture research -- many women enjoy reading stories, reading graphic novels of men falling in love with each other and having very graphic sex. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s existed forever, but it &quot;came out of the closet&quot; in the late 70&#39;s when women were able to share their fantasies on line beginning with Star Trek slash fiction between Kirk and Spock ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sexually speaking, why would women want to read and look at men falling in love and having sex? Biologically speaking it&#39;s a dead end ;-) But the market for &quot;boy&#39;s love&quot; graphic novels (yaoi) is huge. (Google it :-) What&#39;s interesting is generally the men aren&#39;t gay. Partly because it would make the relationships too easy! ;-) But -- and I&#39;ve pondered this for quite a while  ;-) -- I think it has to do with the fact that for the men to fall in love with each other it requires a massive drop of any emotional barriers. I&#39;m guessing women get turned on by emotional vulnerability in men.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What it all comes down to is that sexuality is way more complex than it seems it needs to be ;-) What people like for arousal purposes doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with what they enjoy doing in real life. How many women who enjoyed the early bodice busters where the women were generally raped initially by their eventual husbands, wanted to be raped themselves? If their moms had known exactly what they were reading, would they have been worried about their future ability to have loving sex?<br/>
