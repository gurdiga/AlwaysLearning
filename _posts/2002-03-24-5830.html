&lt;&lt; No, I never watch Charlie Rose.  FYI, Ron Howard is nominated for his<br/>
 direction of &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  Peter Jackson directed &quot;The Lord of the<br/>
 Rings.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mistake!! They had interviews with both of them......oops. I wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
one from the other...I heard the part about Lord of the Rings, but just <br/>
before that they were talking to a guy about &quot;Beautiful Mind&quot; that must have <br/>
been Ron Howard?<br/>
Or maybe someone else connected to the film!! Oh well....<br/>
