I wrote that yesterday.  I leave in two hours.<br/>
<br/>
The Texas event is not an Always Learning Live event, but Kirby and I will be there and it&#39;s at a cool-looking site, and I think it will be a good one.  The rest are me and guests. :-)   <br/>
<br/>
Some are small, just a dozen families, but the one in Melbourne is kinda getting out of hand. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota this year has a pizza party and a hotel with lots of good things right outside in public placesâ€”not an isolated hotel at all.  And there&#39;s a shuttle from that hotel (for money, but still...) to the Mall of America or the Minneapolis/St.Paul airport (or the Rochester airport).  Pam Laricchia and Alex Polikowsky will speak.<br/>
<br/>
If you follow that link there will be lots more info.<br/>
<br/>
Think about attending one of these.  They won&#39;t go on forever.  I&#39;m getting old,  y&#39;know.<br/>
