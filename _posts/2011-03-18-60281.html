<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113174151">&quot;Defending families and the partnership of parents&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m constantly stepping in against the reward-and-punishment stuff and <br/>
general disdain [the wife/mom] treats them with -=-<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I have been there too! It was unfortunate as my partner felt as <br/>
though he was always wrong and couldn&#39;t do it &#39;right&#39; to the point where he <br/>
would abandon the situation and nothing would be resolved, let alone in a <br/>
&#39;joyful&#39; manner! In trying to respect the kids, I definitely wasn&#39;t respecting <br/>
him. I had to slow down enough to really see what it washe needed and begin to <br/>
respect his needs just as much as the kids. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;I need to clarify on what Dayna has said. I don&#39;t think she was suggesting <br/>
go &#39;against&#39; your wife, and even less so &#39;constantly&#39; . She just meant that <br/>
we&#39;re better off than most in that one of us has taken up these ideas in <br/>
alternative learning, perceptions of children on board, but as you say, she was <br/>
clear you go for a better, loving relationship between the parents first. &quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
This brings me to the following note. At a conference of Dayna&#39;s I attended last <br/>
year, this statement came up, it was followed with discussions about respecting <br/>
that the children will have different relationships with different people, <br/>
including their parents (as with any family). I had to really remind myself of <br/>
this, and while trying to find solutions for &#39;everybody&#39; in a respectful way I <br/>
also had to accept that their relationship was going to be what it was and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t control that. I had to learn to let go of this twice, the first time <br/>
with my ex-husband and his relationship with our daughter and more recently <br/>
again with my partner and his relationship with my now daughter&#39;s&#39;. =)Also the <br/>
&#39;united front&#39; issue of parenting: that it isn&#39;t natural &#39;in the real <br/>
world&#39; that everyone agrees all of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I posted a few months ago as I was having difficulties with my <br/>
ex-husband accepting &#39;unschooling&#39;. We discussed things and all seemed to be OK, <br/>
then the cracks started appearing again. Long story short, his discomfort with <br/>
unschooling is starting to effect his time with our daughter. After many months <br/>
of providing him information and hoping he will feel OK, this did not happen and <br/>
left me with the only option I could see presently: I let him know I would <br/>
&#39;teach her math&#39; (Math-U-See units) and &#39;do reading lessons&#39; daily (she is 8 and <br/>
he is worried as she isn&#39;t at the same level as other children her age). He is <br/>
not in a place yet (if ever at all) that he can feel comfortable about our <br/>
non-lesson schooling, regardless of all other things she is learning. Out of <br/>
respect for his relationship with our daughter, I am about to start lessons in <br/>
these two &#39;subjects&#39; so that their relationship survives. Knowing (as best I <br/>
can) that this will take the pressure off their relationship (hopefully) I have <br/>
accepted that I will not be a total unschooler, for now. I have discussed these <br/>
lessons with Pema, letting her know that her father is concerned and that he is <br/>
having trouble understanding our unschooling life. She just says &#39;OK, I&#39;ll do <br/>
the lessons.&#39; In a very nonchalant manner (her tone may change when our <br/>
curriculum arrives).  =) All I can do in that case is try and carve out some <br/>
&#39;progress&#39; to &#39;report&#39; in the most sparkly way possible or get extra creative on <br/>
accomplishing daily lessons!<br/>
<br/>
So, yes. With a different slant, families are not worth being torn apart in the <br/>
name of &#39;unschooling&#39;. I sincerely hope that our changes will have a positive <br/>
affect on my ex-husband as it would sincerely break my heart to have to live our <br/>
lives separated by school 35 hours a week + the rest that goes with it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s more important for the children that their parents love and respect each <br/>
other than where and how they learn to read.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I always feel sad when I hear this. Perhaps because it would mean I would have <br/>
to let go of more than I really truly want to, more than I would want to endure. <br/>
A voice in me cries out that I would want my partner to respect what being with <br/>
my kids really means to me, I feel that their love for me and my <br/>
happiness should be enough to trust me in unschooling. (Unfortunately though <br/>
having an ex-husband, I am no longer in such standing with him!). But with my <br/>
partner this is how I feel. If you were to compromise something that was such a <br/>
huge part of you, something that resonated with your being on such a truthful <br/>
and profound level, I wonder if I would be able to withstand any resentment that <br/>
most likely would arise... I certainly hope that I never have to find out. <br/>
<br/>
Kindest Regards<br/>
Natarsha<br/>
Thank you all so very, very much for all of your time, patience and blunt <br/>
honesty!<br/>
