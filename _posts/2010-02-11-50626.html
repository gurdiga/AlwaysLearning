<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427172750">My daughter is 3 years old and until we all got colds a month or so ago, she and I used to go to the YMCA every day so that I could work out and she could play in the childwatch.  She loved going and every day asked if it was &quot;a Y day&quot;.  We got off our routine as it took a full month for the cold to pass through the family and all of us get well enough to return to the Y.  The problem I&#39;m having is that my daughter says she doesn&#39;t want to go to the Y now.  I haven&#39;t forced her to go back since she says she doesn&#39;t want to, but I wonder if this is a choice she should be making for the both of us or if I should take her and let her experience it again so that she remembers that she really did like it there.<br/>
<br/>
Is this her choice to make?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417767357">I started letting my kids make choices at birth.  Self-directed feeding,<br/>
self-directed toileting and we chose outings we both went on together<br/>
together.  As the adult I was perfectly able to stay longer, or leave<br/>
earlier when we went out.  My compassion or passion for my kids allowed me<br/>
to revel in their fun.  Dinner can wait or dinner can be peanut butter on<br/>
toast, with fruit and yogurt.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids ideas were in conflict with those of a sibling, then I<br/>
negotiated compromise.  I did learn to phone my husband if outings took too<br/>
long;)  One night Rowan and Martin and I came home from a campfire with some<br/>
other moms at a park after eleven pm.  My husband was expecting us by 9pm,<br/>
so he was frantic.  Who comes home from a day at the park at eleven pm, not<br/>
a woman with a baby in a sling and a four year old, surely?  I came home<br/>
glowing and Rowan was quite pleased with himself!  Life is an adventure and<br/>
at age four Rowan was learning how many fun experiences there were out<br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
There were times I wanted an activity that didn&#39;t work for the kids.  My<br/>
husband always offered to give me time, but I found my time away was not<br/>
enjoyable when they were little.  I could go out for brunch or a movie, or a<br/>
walk or a grocery trip, but I didn&#39;t crave days off or away.  I would rather<br/>
someone do my laundry than baby sit my kids!  My best days were on the floor<br/>
playing or reading or curled up with a movie and drink! If you want to<br/>
socialize with adults there must be another time or place.  If you miss the<br/>
Y for the workout put on some music and dance with your child.  If you need<br/>
the workout arrange it for a time when your child is with their other<br/>
parent, or a grandparent or a special aunt/uncle or on a playdate with<br/>
another child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371170834">-=-When do you start allowing children to make choices?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I started when they were born, because I breastfed them when they  <br/>
wanted to, and quit when they were done.  That led naturally to other  <br/>
such choices, and where to sit, and what to wear, and whether to eat  <br/>
real food, whether to ride in a stroller or be carried in a backpack  <br/>
or arms, whether to play or not, watch a movie or not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is this her choice to make?-=-<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t answer that for you.  It&#39;s your choice to make (whether to  <br/>
let her share in or make such a choice).<br/>
<br/>
-=-The problem I&#39;m having is that my daughter says she doesn&#39;t want to  <br/>
go to the Y now. I haven&#39;t forced her to go back since she says she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to, but I wonder if this is a choice she should be making  <br/>
for the both of us or if I should take her and let her experience it  <br/>
again so that she remembers that she really did like it there.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have an idea.  It&#39;s not the only idea in the world.  One time, maybe  <br/>
you could flip a coin, with heads being go and tails being stay home.   <br/>
Not just before time to leave, but a couple of hours before, maybe, or  <br/>
an hour before.  And if she seems disappointed with the flip then you  <br/>
know she wanted the other thing.  And if you yourself are overly  <br/>
thrilled or disappointed with the flip, you might know that it&#39;s not a  <br/>
choice you want to give away at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Flipping coins works great, not as a decision making tool directly,  <br/>
but as an emotion-indicating tool.  Sometimes I really truly do not  <br/>
know what I want, but if I flip a coin, my emotions register one way  <br/>
or the other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877374325"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Maybe you can work out why she doesn&#39;t want to go back. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A thought that occurs to me is that maybe your daughter was in the routine of going before.  Children think that the way things are is the way things are.  Then you stayed home and maybe that changed &quot;the way things are&quot; to something she likes better.  It might be that she&#39;s really making this choice and expressing her opinion for the first time, and choosing home, rather than &quot;not choosing&quot; the Y.  It&#39;s going to be up to you how you handle her expression of opinion.<br/>
<br/>
My kids went through various times of wanting to go to the health club and not wanting to.  One thought it was more fun than the other, and then it turned out that my older one was encountering a bully in the older area, and his parent was very weathly, so none of the staff would deal with him.  When he stole a special lego piece of my son&#39;s, the story finally came out.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that this is not so likely to be your daughter&#39;s issue, but the thought behind it--that there are things in her experience there that you are unaware of, and some might not be positive--is true for all kids being separated from their parents.  It could even be the act of separation that seems scary to her now that didn&#39;t seem so scary before, because at your daughter&#39;s tender age, things like that shift around a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309176472">Ha - someone else with the same situation I had over and over and over, <br/>
with Roya. Roya is a very high energy and enthusiastic person (at 25 as <br/>
she was at 3 years old). She would be involved in an activity and just <br/>
love going - would be the one to get her stuff ready, be all excited, <br/>
couldn&#39;t wait to go. And then, if we missed two or more weeks in a row, <br/>
she didn&#39;t want to go back. It took me a while to recognize the pattern <br/>
- but it became unmistakable.  I did not make her go back. However, once <br/>
I&#39;d realized there was a pattern, here is what I did do... I would find <br/>
some excuse to have to go to the place, just to say goodbye, if nothing <br/>
else. Usually I could find some good reason that made some sense. For <br/>
example, Roya was on a swim team and she really really loved it. But <br/>
when she missed a couple of weeks because we were out of town, she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go back. So I gathered up her swim clothes and cap and <br/>
towel and put them in the car and said we needed to go just tell the <br/>
coach that she wasn&#39;t going to be there anymore. Once we got there, she <br/>
was SO happy to be back, was greeted by all her friends and was <br/>
instantly over the idea that she didn&#39;t want to go back. I said I had <br/>
her swim stuff if she wanted them and she did.<br/>
<br/>
Now - Roya was a lot older when I figured this out. More like 10 years old.<br/>
<br/>
You could worry that your daughter would just figure she was stuck going <br/>
back and she might just make the best of it, instead of letting you know <br/>
if she really didn&#39;t want to. I didn&#39;t have to worry about that - Roya <br/>
wasn&#39;t that compliant of a kid. She&#39;d have let me know loud and clear.<br/>
<br/>
So - your mileage may vary - but just getting Roya into the vicinity of <br/>
something was always all it took for her to decide to continue with <br/>
something that she&#39;d really enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, she is now 25 and knows this about herself and she does <br/>
the same thing to herself. If she knows she enjoyed something, but is <br/>
feeling like not going back, she just calls someone or stops by or <br/>
something - and then it sort of breaks the ice (not quite the right <br/>
expression, but sort of).<br/>
<br/>
ON the other hand, maybe this child never really liked it and was just <br/>
making the best of it all along and now that she&#39;s been free of it and <br/>
experienced not having to go, she is resisting. Could be. In that case, <br/>
I would not want to pressure her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725503258">My oldest is exactly the same way, whether it is gymnastics or choir or anything else that she totally loves. I think it is that feeling of &quot;the way things are is the way things are,&quot; and a change in routine has always reset her comfort level button.  <br/>
<br/>
We also do the Y Childwatch thing on occasion, and yesterday we went for the first time after months of not going. Both my daughters were excited to stay and asked if we can go again next week. But we&#39;ll see how next week goes!<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I honor their decision about whether or not they want to stay. Because *I&#39;M* the one with an expectation (a workout), I have found it important to prepare myself for leaving, that way there is no negative outcome for them if I&#39;m disappointed about missing my class. If we leave, we can go to the park, or get hot chocolate, or whatever, since we&#39;re already out. If we stay, I&#39;m thrilled, but I don&#39;t place the burden of my happiness on their choice, I can just secretly smile as I sweat.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, when my little ones know it&#39;s a choice they can make, and that I will honor their feelings about the situation, their comfort level seems higher overall.  Yes, there will be times when they want to skidaddle right away, but other times they are happy to to stay.<br/>
<br/>
The harder part for me is when one wants to leave and the other wants to stay...that is possibly another topic. :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139523222">***The harder part for me is when one wants to leave and the other wants to stay...that is possibly another topic. :)***<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;ve run into this, we&#39;ve tried really hard to &quot;sweeten&quot; the deal for the one that doesn&#39;t want to stay or go.  We&#39;ve also done time compromises, like when one would stay for many hours more and one wants to leave right NOW.  I&#39;ll suggest 1/2 hour longer, really sticking to that time frame.  The person wanting to leave KNOWS that there is an end in sight and the one that wants to stay KNOWS that they have time to finish doing what they are doing or play on all their favorite park toys one last time.<br/>
<br/>
For our family, eventually we couldn&#39;t do outings with both kids at the same time.  My girls are 7 yrs apart and they have very little in common right now, one is 8 and the other is 15.  Instead of fighting that, we went with it.  There is way more peace for all outings, each girl gets undivided attention from a parent, or time alone, or time with a good friend.  If I&#39;d forced it they would surely despise each other right now, I could see that it would&#39;ve gone in that direction quickly because being together with their needs at odds brought out the worst in each of them.  That wasn&#39;t something we wanted at all!  When we changed directions and started doing outings separate from each other, they were kinder and gentler with each other, and while they still don&#39;t have much in common, they are way more forgiving of each other&#39;s less than stellar attributes than they were a year ago when it all came to a head.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an extreme example, but I know that most kids love one on one time with a parent.  If the kids aren&#39;t meshing with their outings, perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be such a bad idea to leave one with another parent or a friend for an afternoon.  My sister and I were very close in age and sometimes it was really nice when she was away somewhere where I wasn&#39;t, where she wasn&#39;t sharing friends and games.  That rarely happened for me, usually we were forced to share.<br/>

Sandra - DH and I have used the coin-flipping method for helping us root out our real feelings about things, but I&#39;d never thought of using it with DD.  Thanks for the idea!  I know that getting back to the gym is very important to me.  Hopefully, the coin-flip method will reveal that she really does want to go too.<br/>

And, what&#39;s wrong with pursuing my own interests for an hour or so?  I spend the other 23 hours a day at the beck and call of two kids (and a husband!).  Working out really helps me clear my mind and releases a lot of tension for me, which *I* think is in the best interest of the entire family.<br/>

I spend the other 23 hours a day at the beck and call of two kids (and  <br/>
a husband!). Working out really helps me clear my mind and releases a  <br/>
lot of tension for me, which *I* think is in the best interest of the  <br/>
entire family.-=-<br/>

What you get from working out is probably deep breathing and the  <br/>
clearing of your mind (among other things), and those two things can  <br/>
be found while in the presence of your children.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951780179">&quot;Right now&quot; is what comes to mind.<br/>
<br/>
I am not an experienced unschooler, but I find that even with an infant,<br/>
there are moments when I can clearly see him making a &#39;choice&#39;. I do all I<br/>
can to respect it. Right now, it means that his oil massage has overshot its<br/>
&#39;usual time&#39; by half an hour, because he wanted to play in the middle of it.<br/>
Then he promptly fell asleep (as I KNEW he would) before we could head for<br/>
the bath. So I have an oily baby sleeping in very old bedsheets, while I do<br/>
other stuff and we have a bath when he wakes up. I could easily have said he<br/>
doesn&#39;t know what he is doing, and wrapped up the massage and got him bathed<br/>
and sorted before he fell asleep. Perhaps it wasn&#39;t a big deal. I do it,<br/>
because I want to keep it alive in my mind that there is nothing about his<br/>
life he doesn&#39;t have a say in. I want him to experience that he can do<br/>
things out of routines if he feels like it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it is his choice to make, or even if it really was a choice,<br/>
or the exuberance that naturally comes to a 5 month old. I did it, because<br/>
that is how I want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps when he gets older, his choices will get more complex. There may be<br/>
greater difficulty accommodating them. In a way, I see this as &#39;training&#39;<br/>
for me to be alive to what he wants so that I become okay with this way of<br/>
being. I look at this overall as respecting his every choice to the best of<br/>
my capacity when I become aware of him making it. Whether it is a choice is<br/>
not as important as it is that he is interested in a different direction<br/>
than things are headed otherwise and I can go with his flow.<br/>

My husband is VERY involved in our kids&#39; lives; we are true partners in the household.  When I work 24 hours, he has the kids.  And he needs adult time as well.  Our kids are 10, 7 & 6 and we have also allowed them to make choices since birth.  But we have taught that their choices also affect other people and try to teach them to be considerate of another person&#39;s feelings/desires. <br/>
<br/>
Telling them that the work-out time is important to Mommy may allow that child to make a choice to make Mommy happy for an hour.  Then we reciprocate with an activity that the kids enjoy.  Then we are both satisfied. This may not work with a 3 y/o, but there were many other suggestions that sounded useful as well, (coin-flipping, time compromises, etc.)</div>

This comes very naturally for some people and so the idea of choices can be<br/>
a total non-issue for them. I could do this in some areas of mothering and<br/>
in other areas, because of whatever it was I didn&#39;t know or whatever didn&#39;t<br/>
come naturally to me, the abstract notion of offering choices, though a bit<br/>
artificial, was like a stepping stone to doing it naturally in more and more<br/>
areas of mothering Karl.<br/>

<br/>
One hour in 23 may not really be near enough for a person. It wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
for me. I used to do yoga a lot when I was single and I do it sometimes now.<br/>
It&#39;s really helpful and starts my day off very nicely when I do it. I walked<br/>
tons when Karl was 3 and under. I used a Hugabub carrier and away we went<br/>
around and around the field next to our house. And when Karl was that young<br/>
I didn&#39;t miss adult interaction. I went straight into the baby cocoon and<br/>
stayed there for a good long while and loved it. Nice memories I&#39;ll always<br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, I&#39;ve been without adult interaction (except online or<br/>
occasional phone calls) for long periods. And I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s really<br/>
not unusual. A lot of stay at home parents are in the same boat.<br/>
<br/>
I think our culture does a lot to misinform parents about the true nature of<br/>
caring for children, and so many have this idea that children can (or even<br/>
that they *should*) be added without much change in lifestyle. What a rude<br/>
awakening to find out that children aren&#39;t welcome in most social circles.<br/>
I&#39;ve looked high and low with some success. Not to mention that things don&#39;t<br/>
tend to stay the same very long. It isn&#39;t very easy for many parents to find<br/>
a warm circle of friends that welcomes children, and if they do find it,<br/>
well then other things can easily break up that circle: one friend loses a<br/>
job and their partner goes to work or they both move away or maybe they go<br/>
back to school or move to an intentional community. If we had an agrarian<br/>
society, change would probably not be a constant in our lives. Adjusting to<br/>
the reality can be a challenge at times.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it helps a lot to add other routines to that workout hour so that<br/>
perhaps the seeming grind of 24 hours can lighten up and stop dragging you<br/>
down. Adding things like focus on breathing for short periods throughout the<br/>
day can have the real effect of actually changing one&#39;s perspective so that<br/>
what seems a grind or a drag can instead be a joy. (I know... hard to<br/>
imagine a state of joy in the state of mind that says 24 hours on duty but<br/>
it can be done at least to some degree.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying that I never enjoyed time hanging out with other adults, but that mostly happened while hanging out with our kids, too. Of course, the kids would often be playing in another room or running around on a playground while we adults spent some time together. <br/>
<br/>
But - I wanted to comment on how the above sentence struck me as not consistent with my reality.<br/>
<br/>
I just didn&#39;t think of my days as being spent &quot;caring for my kids.&quot;  I didn&#39;t feel like that and I don&#39;t remember it that way, looking back.<br/>
<br/>
I spent my days and nights WITH my kids - hanging out, being together.  <br/>
<br/>
That sentence struck me with a sense of responsibility or even burden, and maybe the solution is to focus on lightening up and having more fun together, rather than on getting away from the kids more.<br/>
<br/>
Could be way off base, but from the little information given and the tone of it, that&#39;s my reaction.<br/>

DO find social outlets. So what if things change a lot? lol The way I wrote<br/>

And I&#39;m not saying the non-agrarian culture is bad or good. It is what it is<br/>

Another thought, that kind of piggy backs on what Pam said about being with her kids and hanging out with them, rather than away from them, is that all kinds of exercise can happen with kids around.  Playing tag or setting up obstacle courses or going on walks or hikes or bike rids or even vacuuming.  <br/>
<br/>
Over the years, what I&#39;ve found, is that if I look at the problem without thinking I already know the solution, I can be creative in solving it.  Sometimes I get up earlier than my kids or stay up later, to have that moment of solitude.  Once they are awake and running, I NEED to be there for them in the capacity that they need me.  Unschooling takes MORE hands on, being there, than other ways of parenting and homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I play DDR to get some exercise, sometimes I jump on a trampoline, sometimes I stretch while waiting for a kid.  It&#39;s a part of life.  It need not be a separate activity.  Once I could get over that hurdle in my thinking, that a thing needed to be a certain way to work, the choices were seemingly infinite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440885802">I have a son that will often opt out of things to stay home when he can, but when he goes to activities he will often have fun. He isnt one that can be made to do things either. If he doesnt want to do it he just doesnt want to, but with 4 kids we all all learning to work together.  So when these situations arise and the rest of us really want to go, we make it appealing to him as well.  Picking up cookies from Subway on the way home often helps, stoping by Target, bringing something for him to do, going by the library etc... make the trip interesting for him and more often than not, when we get to the place we origionally were going, he enjoys himself there too, because he wasnt forced.  <br/>
Perhaps with going back to a day care kind of situation at the Y, you might assure her that you wont leave until she says you can.  Perhaps, shs is nervous about being left after getting out of the habit.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180790901"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I spent my days and nights WITH my kids - hanging out, being together.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That sentence struck me with a sense of responsibility or even burden, and maybe the solution is to focus on lightening up and having more fun together, rather than on getting away from the kids more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could be way off base, but from the little information given and the tone of it, that&#39;s my reaction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -pam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of how I used to feel when my kids were really little and I was very responsible for every aspect of their lives, particularly behavior.  After many time-outs and attempts to push them around all day I was exhausted.  (I&#39;m not saying that I think the op is at all in the same place--just that it reminds me of when I was.)  When I started learning about unschooling, and realizing how much FUN I could have, and that life wasn&#39;t all serious and prepping them for college &lt;g&gt; the days got soooooo much easier and just more fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759856450">I wonder if some of this comes from parent&#39;s not pursuing their own passions just as they help their children pursue theirs?  When I&#39;m pursuing my passions alongside my children pursuing theirs I feel complete.  I get pockets of time throughout the day to do what interests me, therefore I never feel the need to get away.  We do get together with a few families on occasion where we&#39;re able to have adult conversation while the children are playing close by.  We&#39;re also involved in an urban homesteader group (one of our interests) and children are always welcome at these get togethers.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have taken genuine interests in the interests of our children and are learning right along with them, and vice versa, our children have become interested in certain things that my husband and I like to do and have joined us on occasion or just asked questions and have become inspired themselves just by observing us. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a great article by Ren Allen on mom&#39;s pursuing their own interests:<br/>

&gt; &quot;&quot;What you get from working out is probably deep breathing and the<br/>
&gt; clearing of your mind (among other things), and those two things can<br/>
&gt; be found while in the presence of your children.&quot;&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe the mind-clearing is more effective in a group of adults than in the presence of your chldren.  I know after caring for my kids all day/night it would be nice to have an hour of adult interaction, without children present.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband is VERY involved in our kids&#39; lives; we are true partners in the household.  When I work 24 hours, he has the kids.  And he needs adult time as well.  Our kids are 10, 7 & 6 and we have also allowed them to make choices since birth.  But we have taught that their choices also affect other people and try to teach them to be considerate of another person&#39;s feelings/desires. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Telling them that the work-out time is important to Mommy may allow that child to make a choice to make Mommy happy for an hour.  Then we reciprocate with an activity that the kids enjoy.  Then we are both satisfied. This may not work with a 3 y/o, but there were many other suggestions that sounded useful as well, (coin-flipping, time compromises, etc.)<br/>

YES!  Exactly what we experience in our house too.  Each of us pursue the things we love, sometimes the same things together and sometimes separate things simultaneously!<br/>

In addition to that link, what helped &quot;me&quot; get to that place, was learning how to &quot;be&quot; with my kids!<br/>

<br/>
I do feel the same way but there there are many things I love to do that I have, joyfully, put on hold because my kids are young and I chose to be with them.<br/>
I too love to work out and bike and when my oldest was younger he would not go with anyone, not even dad.<br/>
So I did not go work out  and for a while could not even put him down to do anything at home.<br/>
But we have a treadmill and a bike trainer and as soon as he was mobile and wanted to stay down I was able to do it more.<br/>
I tried going to the dog shows and showing our dog. I was able to do it when MD was 3 and I was pregnant.<br/>
It was Ok, not great but doable.<br/>
The next time I tried Gigi was about 8 months old and it was a nightmare.<br/>
She was with my mom at the show ( just 10 minutes from home so I thought perfect) but as soon as we went into the ring <br/>
she started wanting me and fussing and the dog just did not show well because the dog could hear her and Vicky ( the dog) loves her.<br/>
So now I have this dog that I bought for a lot of money and never even finish her championship.<br/>
I could her send her to a dog handler to do it but Gigi just would not be happy if we sent the dog away so she stayed and is a loved pet.<br/>
But all is well.<br/>
I don&#39;t resent my kids for it.<br/>
I gladly chose to put them first. They are growing and its much easier now.<br/>
We go and show the cows and calves at the Dairy Shows and the kids like that.<br/>
I think its all how you see it. I f you see it as sacrificing something you want to do for your kids than I am sure there will be resentment.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
I try to remember that I had 25 years before I had kids and hopefully longer than that when they don&#39;t need me so much.  It also helps me to remember that I did not always do things when I had the chance.  For example, I would love to hike more, but the kids don&#39;t want to as often as the adults do.  When I get frustrated it helps to remember that I have for various reasons chosen not to hike on days that I could have.  It helps to remember that kids are not the only thing that have ever held me back from doing something I love.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes, like tonight, they make something fun so much more fun.  We played wii sports for at least two hours as a family.  It was infinitely more fun than playing alone!<br/>

<br/>
Wow. Flashbulb.<br/>
<br/>
Its totally like this for me. Being able to be excited about my own passions<br/>
freely enables me to understand and respect his desires too. Its like<br/>
because I like eating chocolate, I&#39;m excited about him discovering a taste?<br/>
When I get bogged down and &#39;coping&#39;, it is more difficult to find his<br/>
freedom precious too.<br/>
<br/>
Eureka!!!<br/>
<br/>
This changes everything. I now see so many possibilities for supporting both<br/>
our passions more. I was living it, but I never really saw it before.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
