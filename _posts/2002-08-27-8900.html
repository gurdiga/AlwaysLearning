&lt;&lt;&lt;Dear Member of the Home-Education Community:<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of the Quaqua Society, Inc., http://www.quaqua.org, I am writing<br/>
to extend our greetings to you.<br/>
<br/>
Quaqua is a tax-exempt, non-profit, pro-bono, charitable foundation that<br/>
offers recognition, financial assistance, and career resources to home<br/>
educators of all backgrounds from around the world. We are committed to<br/>
working with existing organizations, publications, institutions, and<br/>
cultures in the global home-education community of this 21st century.<br/>
<br/>
Those in your local home-education community are welcome to participate in<br/>
Quaqua at all levels of volunteer leadership, and to make use of the<br/>
services we provide. We are open to ideas for continued cooperation with<br/>
your local home-education community. We hope that you will let other local<br/>
home educators know about Quaqua, through conversation, e-mail, and linking.<br/>
We also welcome information and feedback from you and others that will help<br/>
us to improve the quality of our service. Our effort to improve our<br/>
organization and its website is ongoing.<br/>
<br/>
We want you to know that we view helping home educators across the world as<br/>
central to our mission. We believe we have developed an exciting new concept<br/>
for doing this, and hope you will stay in touch with us.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Elissa, I received this a few months ago. It is apparently a scholorship <br/>
foundation set up by a former homeschooler, for homeschoolers going to <br/>
college. There are a few different scholarships for different things, but <br/>
mainly the participant has to submit examples of the schoolwork, portfolios, <br/>
an essay topic (chosen by the committee) etc.. to be able to apply. There are <br/>
a ton (!!) of rules and regulations, including this excerpt from the <br/>
qualifications list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A commitment to one’s family, and respect for one or more of the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>traditional forms &gt;of the heterosexual family institution as found in <br/>
civilizations based (according to &gt;self-assertion) upon Judeo-Christian <br/>
scripture or Jewish scripture, the Koran, the &gt;Confucian Code, Buddhist <br/>
tradition, Hindu tradition, Sikh tradition, Shinto tradition, &lt;Taoist <br/>
tradition, traditional aboriginal and tribal structures, and/or other&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.quaqua.org/#_edn8&quot;&gt; [2] &lt;/A&gt;<br/>
traditions<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A commitment to respecting and preserving the legal rights and liberties of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>all &gt;people with regard to their rights as adults to the following: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;direct the upbringing of their own natural child<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;engage in the free exercise of religion<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;enjoy free expression, meaningful petitioning of the government, free <br/>
 </span></blockquote>association, &gt;and a meaningfully opportunity to vote for sovereign <br/>
governmental representation <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;be free of unreasonable government searches or seizures of property or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>people <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;enjoy family autonomy in their own homes and in their efforts to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>meaningfully and &gt;reasonably defend their own custodial children from <br/>
physical and non-physical &gt;dangers <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;obtain fair procedural processes for legal proceedings against them <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;be free from core legal and economic badges and incidents of involuntary <br/>
 </span></blockquote>servitude&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.quaqua.org/#_edn9&quot;&gt; &gt;[3] &lt;/A&gt;and/or the terrorism of unprincipled, arbitrary and capricious <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I found it an interesting site, but doubt I would participate :::shrug::: It <br/>
seemed (to me) to be a tad over the top. Although it was interesting to know <br/>
there are scholarships specifically for the homeschooled student. I just <br/>
seems to be tailored for the traditional school-at-homer and specifically the <br/>
religious school-at-homer. But then, I could have read the site in the wrong <br/>
light. <br/>

what I can tell.  That would be enough to keep this live-and-let-live <br/>

up! At first I was kind of excited (not that Moly or Jack are ready for <br/>
college &lt;g&gt;) that there was a scholarship program for homeschoolers.... THEN <br/>
I spent some time reading through their site and @@ any way... Not my cupa, <br/>
but I know a family who are school-at-homers who have a 16yo and I forwarded <br/>
it to them. Maybe she won&#39;t mind the blatant homophobic references. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470046958">Hello everyone,<br/>
We&#39;re considering an eventual move to the Big Sur-or-thereabouts area but <br/>
the remote-ness of the space and the terrain (terrifically different from <br/>
where we are now!) is bringing up some questions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d greatly appreciate it if homeschoolers (or homeschool-friendly people) <br/>
who live in mountainous-coastal areas could email me off-list so I could <br/>
ask questions and get some opinions.  Especially if you&#39;ve built a home <br/>
from scratch in a mountainous area - up twisty roads where no semi-truck <br/>
will ever be able to go!<br/>
<br/>
Please email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:heidi@...">heidi@...</a><br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well they are wrong, anyway. Not all of the listed<br/>
cultures have entirely heterosexual traditional family<br/>
insitutions.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OH HUH!<br/>
<br/>
They have entirely heterosexual families and then some socially and eternally <br/>
doomed perverts.<br/>
