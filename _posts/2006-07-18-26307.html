<br/>
Matt is a 29-year-old deadbeat from Connecticut who used to think  <br/>
that all he ever wanted to do in life was make and play videogames.  <br/>
He achieved this goal pretty early and enjoyed it for a while, but  <br/>
eventually realized there might be other stuff he was missing out on.  <br/>
In February of 2003, he quit his job in Brisbane, Australia and used  <br/>
the money he&#39;d saved to wander around the planet until it ran out. He  <br/>
made this site so he could keep his family and friends updated about  <br/>
where he is.<br/>
<br/>
A few months into his trip, a travel buddy gave Matt the idea of  <br/>
dancing everywhere he went and recording it on his camera. This  <br/>
turned out to be a very good idea. Now Matt is quasi-famous as &quot;That  <br/>
guy who dances on the internet. No, not that guy. The other one. No,  <br/>
not him either. I&#39;ll send you the link. It&#39;s funny.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The response to the first video brought Matt to the attention of the  <br/>
nice people at Stride long-lasting gum. They asked Matt if he&#39;d be  <br/>
interested in taking another trip around the world to make a new  <br/>
video. Matt asked if they&#39;d be paying for it. They said yes. Matt  <br/>
thought this sounded like another very good idea.<br/>
<br/>
At the start of 2006, Matt left on a 6 month trip through 39  <br/>
countries on all 7 continents. In that time, he danced a great deal.<br/>
<br/>
Matt dances very badly, but most people don&#39;t seem to mind.<br/>
<br/>
Matt is not independently wealthy. Matt also doesn&#39;t have some  <br/>
magical secret for traveling cheaply. He does it pretty much the same  <br/>
way everybody else does.<br/>
<br/>
Matt thinks Americans need to travel abroad more.<br/>
<br/>
Matt was a very poor student and never went to college. When he got  <br/>
older, he was pleased to discover that no one actually cares. Matt  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to imply that college is bad or anything. He&#39;s just  <br/>
saying is all. There&#39;s other ways to fill your head.<br/>
<br/>
Matt currently lives in Seattle, Washington, where he still works in  <br/>
videogames from time to time as a writer and designer. Matt  <br/>
recognizes that this is not the worst job in the world, but he  <br/>
prefers traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Matt is left-handed.<br/>
<br/>
When Matt was younger, he could hang seven spoons on his face at  <br/>
once. Sadly, puberty made Matt&#39;s face less conducive to spoon-hanging.<br/>
<br/>
Matt has a little piece of extra cartilage sticking out on the rim of  <br/>
one ear and a little hole in the same place on the other ear. Matt  <br/>
has no idea why this is the case.<br/>
<br/>
Matt is very good with figures and wishes people asked him to  <br/>
multiply things more often.<br/>
<br/>
Matt has never lost a staring contest.<br/>

  That was really cool! I loved the kids in Rwanda! And dang..he went to Antarctica?! I SO want to go there someday ..I even ASKED to be assigned to one of the Polars (Polar Sea and Polar Star) when I was in the Coast Guard but there weren&#39;t any openings the week I graduated boot camp (the company two weeks behind me sent three people to the Polars). <br/>
   <br/>
  But just ...wow...and I really enjoyed the song that was playing! I have the video going again just to hear the song. Not a clue what&#39;s being sung, but it sounds nice!<br/>

What are the lyrics to the song?<br/>
I�m glad you asked. From what I can gather, the song is a lullaby  <br/>
sung by an older sister to her younger brother. Here are the  <br/>
approximate lyrics:<br/>
<br/>
Young brother, young brother, be quiet<br/>
You are crying, but our father has left us<br/>
He has gone to the place of the dead<br/>
To protect the living, to protect the orphan child<br/>

I sure did.  I think, for me anyway, it was because the  combination of the <br/>
music, Matt doing the same dance in every part of the  world, and all of the <br/>
native people and animals just made me feel such a sense  of connection to <br/>
everything.  It was like bridging some sort of enormous  gap between us all.  <br/>
Especially with all the things we&#39;ve been seeing on  the news about how separate <br/>
people seem to be everywhere these days.  It  was just so moving.  My 14 yo ds <br/>
enjoyed it immensely.  He did  not, however, enjoy me crying.  He thinks that <br/>
was rather foolish.   :)  Oh well!<br/>

When I sung it to Richard I changed it to &quot;and mommy will catch you, cradle and all.&quot;  <br/>
My other version was <br/>
&quot;Rock -a-bye Richard,<br/>
In mommy&#39;s arms,<br/>
When I kiss you, you smile so sweet,<br/>
As I rock you, you drift off to sleep,<br/>
And mommy will rock you, <br/>
All through the night.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t rhyme, but it felt better to sing that and Richard would always smile when I kissed him after the &quot;when I kiss you&quot; line.  Very sweet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809081638">Okay, this is one those &quot;seeing unschooling working&quot; moments.  Hold on....still smiling too much from watching that happy video..okay. <br/>
<br/>
For several months Sorscha has been into the country singer Gretchen Wilson.  The new Dixie Chicks CD came out and since I know that she likes that twangy country sounding music I went and purchased it for her yesterday.  One of the songs says, &quot;and I&#39;m mad as hell...&quot;   This line is one of the climax points of the song so we both have been walking around singing it in high pitched voices.   About 1/2 hour ago Sorscha asked me what &quot;hell&quot; meant and I gave her several definitions.  She was satisfied and I went on to check my emails where Joyce posted the &quot;Where the Hell is Matt?&quot; video.  I pressed the link and there it was.<br/>
<br/>
Upon seeing it I was very excited.  Sorscha and I had seen this gentleman on a morning show several weeks ago and I had meant to pull up the video at that time...but obviously never did.  I called Sorscha over, she looked at the screen and said, &quot;HELL!  Mom there it is.  Does it mean the same thing?&quot; I answered her and then we played the video. <br/>
<br/>
As the video rolled on, all the sudden Sorscha yelled out, &quot;Venice, Italy!!!  That&#39;s where Sly Cooper goes.&quot;  For those of you who do not know, Sly Cooper is a video game.  Sorscha then left and began to play one of her Sly Cooper games. <br/>
<br/>
I just thought this was great and wanted to share.  It seems my daughters world is a giant puzzle and she keeps adding little pieces along her journey.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be seeing ya&#39;ll at the conference in NM, <br/>
Crystal and Sorscha<br/>
