<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397055891">This is from a member of my local yahoo list.  I asked if she&#39;d like the<br/>
input of 150-odd &lt;g&gt; self-identified unschoolers, and she said yes, giving<br/>
me permission to post to this list.  She&#39;s a way-cool old-time unschooler<br/>
:-)  Note that she requests replies sent privately, although I did give her<br/>
the url for this list, as she was very interested.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am working on the cover design for my book Homeschooling<br/>
&gt; Reflections.  This is my question -- who would you suggest that I ask<br/>
&gt; to read and give me a testimonial or endorsement?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In other words, if you were reading the cover - who would impress you<br/>
&gt; in the un/homeschooling world??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please e-mail me privately with your response-<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; or<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hsreflections@...">hsreflections@...</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help!  ;-)<br/>
