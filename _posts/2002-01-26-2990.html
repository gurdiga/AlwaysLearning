photo that actually has me in it to put up, and hubby if he wants it up <br/>
there. He may prefer to &quot;remain anonymous&quot;. But he also has a beard and long <br/>
hair. Well at least the hair he has left is long.<br/>

It sounds like the school district in your area is using the AEP carrot as a <br/>
way to keep more control over homeschoolers than the laws may allow. They&#39;re <br/>
probably getting funding for the students they can get in it too. Doesn&#39;t <br/>
sit well with me either. But only from the sneaky &quot;let&#39;s keep track of those <br/>

That is exactly what is going on; I am sorry Tia, if I came across any other way..I think situations change with the laws in each state, since the laws here give the school district zero accountability (no reporting too, no turning in plans, nothing of that sort is what I mean with accountability) I think the situation is much different here verses where you are =).<br/>
<br/>
I hope this came across correctly at times my fingers and my brain are two completely separate entities...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, where I am (British Columbia) the school districts also have no <br/>
accountability control over homeschoolers.  We have to register with the <br/>
province (giving name, age, sex, and postal code) and we have to provide an <br/>
education program.  The law specifically states that it&#39;s the parents who <br/>
decide if the program meets the provincial mission statement.  So the <br/>
people who go with the programs have more accountability, though almost <br/>
none compared to some of the programs I&#39;ve heard about in the U.S.   And <br/>
we&#39;re able to pick and choose somewhat between districts (those that offer <br/>
them anyway).  The one we&#39;re with, which was actually the first, is located <br/>
about 800 miles away from us.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644126757"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;That is why I would rather say to the individual, please refer to yourself <br/>
&gt;&gt;as eclectic rather than unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just had a conversation like this with a friend the other day. Her kids <br/>
are older than mine and &quot;choosing&quot; ps these days. She swears she did <br/>
unschooling for the grade school years but then they wouldn&#39;t &quot;do anything&quot; <br/>
once they became teens. Well, yeah, they chose school. The only other option <br/>
was to do something that looked academic enough for mom, including a push <br/>
toward the American School program.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than telling her how to refer to herself, though, I just pointed out <br/>
that it sounds like she was more of a &quot;delayed academics&quot; advocate. Since I <br/>
have no timetable or expectations of the kids ever starting a curriculum or <br/>
graduating high school, our methods are different. I&#39;m an unschooler. She&#39;s <br/>
more of an eclectic homeschooler. She agreed. (Much to my surprise.)<br/>
