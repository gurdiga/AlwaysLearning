<div id="ygrps-yiv-376987235">I haven&#39;t given much thought to the morality of cloning, although I think it <br/>
will open a can of worms we aren&#39;t prepared to deal with.  I STRONGLY feel <br/>
that we know way too little to be thinking about cloning humans.<br/>
<br/>
When the issue came up I remembered having heard and/or read some articles <br/>
which reported early deaths, high rates of miscarriage and early disease in <br/>
cloned animals.<br/>
<br/>
I did a very short google on the subject and came up with a web site <br/>
containing some articles on the issue.<br/>
