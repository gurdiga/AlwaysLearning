<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273223541">I felt the need to educate some of ya!! :)<br/>
Another Brick in the Wall (not the Wall) has two parts actually. Here&#39;s some <br/>
lyrics:<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need no education<br/>
We don&#39;t need no thought control<br/>
No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br/>
Teachers leave the kids alone<br/>
hey teacher leave us kids alone<br/>
All in all it&#39;s just another brick in the wall<br/>
All in all you&#39;re just another brick in the wall<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39; part One... Part two is this:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need no walls around me.<br/>
And I don&#39;t need no drugs to calm me.<br/>
I have seen the writing on the wall.<br/>
Don&#39;t think I need any thing at all.<br/>
No. Don&#39;t think I need anything at all.<br/>
All in all it was all just the bricks in the wall.<br/>
All in all it was all just the bricks in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
And I think this is from Part One too...I need to go get my CD, I can&#39;t <br/>
remember how these all fit together....<br/>
<br/>
Daddy&#39;s gone across the ocean,<br/>
Leaving just a memory,<br/>
A snapshot in the family album.<br/>
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?<br/>
Daddy, whatcha leave behind for me?<br/>
All in all it was just a brick in the wall.<br/>
All in all it was just the bricks in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....I LOVE Pink FLoyd, what an awesome group.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010398627">I remember when I first heard that song, when I was about 9 yo <br/>
(1978).  I thought it was awesome...the kids in the background <br/>
chanting &quot;we don&#39;t need no education&quot; just blew me away.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
imagine that their parents let them sing that song...it was almost <br/>
like blasphemy to my young ears...I loved it!  It was one of those <br/>
hauntingly cool songs that I never forgot.  Flash forward 9 <br/>
years...I&#39;m sitting in a midnight movie on acid wathcing &quot;the wall&quot;, <br/>
which by then was a staple of my musical diet...I hated high school, <br/>
hated EVERYTHING at that point, and &quot;we don&#39;t need no education was, <br/>
again, a favorite saying of mine...Now Flash forward another 16 years <br/>
or so, and this newbie unschooler still finds relevance in it after <br/>
all these years, especially when my own DD starts to sing it! <br/>
<br/>
Angie * Who has The Wall (album AND CD!) but likes the album better, <br/>
cuz album covers are so much cooler than little CD labels...<br/>

&gt; Well, when we grew up and went to school,<br/>
&gt; There were certain teachers,<br/>
&gt; Who would hurt the children in any way they could,<br/>
&gt; By pouring their derision,<br/>
&gt; Upon anything we did,<br/>
&gt; Exposing every weakness,<br/>
&gt; However carefully hidden by the kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But in (but in) the town it was well known,<br/>
&gt; When they got home at night,<br/>
&gt; Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them,<br/>

&gt; The Wall was among my first album purchased &quot;with my own money&quot; <br/>
when I was<br/>
&gt; around 17 and newly working.<br/>
&gt; I remember sitting and listening to it over and over in my room - <br/>
in my car.<br/>
&gt; The movie is really bizarre, too!<br/>
&gt; We saw a special on VH1 a few months ago about Syd Barret - the <br/>
original<br/>
&gt; lead singer.<br/>
&gt; I thought he died long ago but he&#39;s still alive (living in <br/>
Englandd) and his<br/>
&gt; personality has been permanently altered by the mis-use of drugs.<br/>
&gt; A lot of Pink Floyd&#39;s songs are about or dedicated to Syd Barret - <br/>
I think I<br/>
&gt; remember hearing that The Wall is loosely based on his life -  a <br/>
sad story.<br/>
