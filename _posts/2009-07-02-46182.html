<div id="ygrps-yiv-944751791">So, here I am, deschooling.<br/>
Here are some choices I&#39;ve<br/>
made lately that I think are<br/>
better than ones I used to make:<br/>
<br/>
1) Samantha (9 y.o., adopted<br/>
5.5 years ago from China) just<br/>
had a birthday.  She got everything<br/>
that she asked for, namely, a laptop<br/>
and &quot;Guitar Hero:  World Tour&quot; for<br/>
PS3.  When she opened them, though,<br/>
she showed no emotion whatsoever<br/>
about the game and actually complained<br/>
about the laptop, b/c she wasn&#39;t thrilled<br/>
about the color.<br/>
<br/>
Old reaction might have been to think,<br/>
&quot;What a spoiled child.  How ungrateful<br/>
can she be?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
New response:  I remembered that Sam<br/>
has a hard time with abundance.  Her<br/>
early experiences were of extreme deprivation,<br/>
and she is still recovering from those <br/>
experiences.  I felt disappointed, not<br/>
in Sam, but in myself, that I hadn&#39;t <br/>
prepared her better for her birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I know, but had forgotten, that Samantha<br/>
finds it helpful to role play giving and<br/>
receiving gifts in the days immediately<br/>
leading up to a gift receiving occasion.<br/>
It helps her remember what others expect<br/>
her to say when receiving a gift to role<br/>
play it beforehand.  I had assumed--you know <br/>
what they say about &quot;assume&quot;--that Samantha no <br/>
longer needed this practice.  My assumption<br/>
was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was annoyed that Sam didn&#39;t show<br/>
gratitude for the gift.  The sad truth is,<br/>
there was a time I probably would have agreed<br/>
with, and sided with, my mother.  I probably<br/>
would have scolded and shamed my daughter, and<br/>
on her birthday, no less.<br/>
<br/>
Now, though, I had a different response.  I knew<br/>
Samantha was picking up on my parents&#39; disappointed<br/>
vibes, and I took responsibility.  Better late than<br/>
never.  It was a bad moment, but that didn&#39;t mean<br/>
that we all had to go on to have a bad day.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I gave Sam a reassuring hug.  I gave voice<br/>
to her feelings.  (I knew what she was feeling, b/c<br/>
she&#39;s explained it to me, in private, in the past,<br/>
after receiving lots of gifts, or expensive gifts.)<br/>
So I hugged her, and smiled at her, and let my love <br/>
for her flow.  I felt my total acceptance of her, just <br/>
as she is.  <br/>
<br/>
I also decided, then and there, not to let myself get <br/>
stuck in blaming myself for not preparing Sam better for <br/>
receiving presents.  Instead, I looked at what I could do <br/>
to make things better for her in that moment.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Even though you wanted this game, it&#39;s still pretty surprising that you actually got it, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  She nodded.  <br/>
I saw my parents eyes light up with understanding, saw their<br/>
disappointment and harsh judgements melt away.  We all know<br/>
that it is still really hard for her to accept abundance.<br/>
Then, I whispered in her ear; I told her that her grandma and <br/>
grandpa would like to hear a &quot;thank you&quot; for the present they<br/>
gave her.<br/>
<br/>
She ran up to them, hugged each of them, and said, very <br/>
sincerely, &quot;Thank you sooooo much!  I really wanted this<br/>
game.  I hope you will play it with me.&quot;  What could have<br/>
been a very bad moment became a very sweet one.  And there<br/>
were more sweet moments later as three generations played<br/>
the game together.<br/>
<br/>
I also told her we could look into exchanging the laptop<br/>
for a different color.  She thought about that, and <br/>
decided that she does like red, after all.<br/>
<br/>
2) I read the wonderful essay, in sonnet form, posted<br/>
here.  It gave me goosebumps.  And I knew that there<br/>
was a time when I would have reacted with jealousy and<br/>
fear.  You see, my 12 y.o. son, Caleb, struggles to put <br/>
his ideas into writing.  It comes up sometimes... <br/>
For example, he has a very large repertoire of songs he <br/>
can play on violin. His violin teacher asked him to write <br/>
down the first few measures of each of the tunes on index <br/>
cards. That way, he can bring the index cards to gigs, and <br/>
have a reminder of how his songs start.  (Once he&#39;s started <br/>
playing, he can continue on from memory.)  Or, he goes to <br/>
religious school, b/c he wants to participate in a Bar <br/>
Mitzvah ceremony next year.  Writing assignments come up <br/>
there, and he struggles.<br/>
<br/>
He is very bright.  He can read well, and he is very <br/>
articulate and thoughtful.  He&#39;s also a talented musician<br/>
and a fairly good athlete.  He has amazing inter- and intra-<br/>
personal skills.  He has a knack for mathematics and a <br/>
natural facility for strategic thinking.  He is incredibly<br/>
kind, and generous.  But when he tries to write... oh!  He <br/>
can&#39;t remember which way 9s go versus Ps.  He can&#39;t spell <br/>
very well.  He struggles with the grammar and punctuation.  <br/>
If he were in school, he would be labeled &quot;dysgraphic&quot; and <br/>
he&#39;d be constantly challenged to write better.  It could get discouraging.  Anybody judging him by his writing, and <br/>
only his writing, would get a very inaccurate idea of <br/>
who he is. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I read that amazing sonnet, and I didn&#39;t feel <br/>
jealous.  I felt happy that this young woman could<br/>
write something so wonderful, and also happy for my<br/>
son, for all the things he can do well, and for the<br/>
fact that he doesn&#39;t have to struggle with language<br/>
arts classes for 12 or more years.  I&#39;m not worried.<br/>
He will find his way in life.  He will even learn to<br/>
write well, if he wants to, when he wants to.  And<br/>
if not, that will be fine.<br/>
<br/>
3) We went to a cave yesterday.  Samantha, who loves<br/>
gaming, said she wanted to stay home to play video <br/>
games.  Old response would have been along the lines of:  <br/>
&quot;Video games are a waste of time, and you play them all <br/>
the time.  YOu can play on the computer any old time, but<br/>
you can&#39;t go to a cave every day.  You are coming with us,<br/>
and that is that.&quot;  New response:  &quot;Okay.&quot;  (And it really<br/>
*was* okay with me.)  &quot;I know how it feels to want to<br/>
keep playing.  We will miss you, but I know you will<br/>
have fun.&quot;  (All said sincerely; I am a video game convert.)  <br/>
And then...<br/>
<br/>
...Samantha logged off, saying, &quot;This 2D cave will be<br/>
here when we get home; I wanna see a 3D cave.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
MOREOVER, while I was delighted to have her company,<br/>
I truly would have been happy if she stayed home to<br/>
continue gaming.  I&#39;m glad she really has choices.<br/>
<br/>
4) At the caves, my 9 y.o. son, Mark, adopted last<br/>
July from China, asked me how the stalagmites<br/>
and stalagtites had formed.  I admitted that I<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to explain it to him, but I would<br/>
figure it out.  On the ride home, I realized that<br/>
we could make a supersaturated sugar solution,<br/>
then grow sugar crystals and make rock candy.<br/>
That&#39;s not exactly the same as how stalagmites<br/>
are formed, but I think the general idea is close<br/>
enough... for now.  The four younger kids all<br/>
wanted to make rock candy, so we started on that.<br/>
Once upon a time, I would have been frustrated<br/>
about how to explain such a concept.  Opening<br/>
up and being more playful helped me to see a<br/>
solution... no pun intended.<br/>
<br/>
5) My 10 y.o. daughter, Amelia, has a lot of<br/>
neat ideas for video games she wants to write.<br/>
But so far, the only programming she can do<br/>
is with Alice software, and she is bumping up<br/>
against the limits of that software.  If she<br/>
really wants to write these games, that will<br/>
involve choosing to learn to program in a more<br/>
powerful computer language.  I would like to<br/>
learn to program, and I told Amelia so, and<br/>
said that if she&#39;d like, we could learn together.<br/>
<br/>
She said that sounded cool, but hasn&#39;t come back<br/>
to me yet about doing it.  She continues to<br/>
refine her ideas about the games, though.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a time when I would have pushed her<br/>
to get into the programming part of it.  Now I can<br/>
see that would have crushed her enthusiasm.  She<br/>
might have abandoned the whole project, even though<br/>
it means a lot to her.  So now, I focus my interest<br/>
where her interest is focused:  on the storylines and <br/>
characters.  She loves to talk about the games, so I <br/>
ask her about them and really listen to what she has<br/>
to say, and only offer suggestions when she asks for them.  <br/>
I may decide to learn a programming language just for my <br/>
own pleasure, and if I do, maybe I can program the games <br/>
for her, if she wants me to.  <br/>
<br/>
6) My 17 y.o. son, Yuyu, adopted 3.5 years ago <br/>
from China, is visiting us at our summer home.  He<br/>
will soon be returning to our year-round home<br/>
to take a summer class (English for Speakers of<br/>
Other Languages) and to take a summer job.  He<br/>
got a position in the kitchen of a local nursing<br/>
home.  It&#39;s a good foot in the door for him; he<br/>
wants to work in food service.  Anyway... he&#39;s<br/>
been acting like he feels blue.  Once upon a time,<br/>
I would have left him alone in his unhappiness,<br/>
figuring, &quot;teens are just like that sometimes.&quot;<br/>
But now, I realize that his boredom is my<br/>
responsibility.  He came to visit us; we could<br/>
do more to make his stay pleasant.  I asked him<br/>
to come along to the cave, and he did, and he had<br/>
a great time.  I asked my husband to take him grocery<br/>
shopping and to cook with him--two things he loves--<br/>
and my husband did, and Yuyu was happy.  I asked my<br/>
parents if they would invite Yuyu to come along<br/>
with them when they go out to walk the dogs, and <br/>
they agreed, and Yuyu was happy, and so were my parents.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;ve had a lot of parenting moments that I&#39;m<br/>
not proud of, but being present and aware and positive<br/>
and focused on now is helping... I think.  I&#39;m still<br/>
making mistakes, I&#39;m sure, and will continue to, but<br/>
hopefully they will be fewer and farther between, and<br/>
hopefully I am making amends with each good choice I<br/>
make now, and in each moment from here on out.<br/>
<br/>
No names have been changed, and everybody involved<br/>
is fine with the sharing of our family experiences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942839887">Kelly has your daughter Amelia tried Roblox.com?<br/>
Lots of kids making their own games and learning Lua language (scripting)<br/>
It is free and very cool.<br/>
