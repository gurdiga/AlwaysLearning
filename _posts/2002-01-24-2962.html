<div id="ygrps-yiv-229589799">Ok.  Just when I was ready to give up I received an e-mail from my<br/>
brother.  This is part of what he said..<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yep, I spanked him twice when I was there.  The first time to see if he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could make &gt;a connection, the next time because I didn&#39;t believe he<br/>
didn&#39;t get it.  Two mistakes, &gt;the second worse than the first, but a<br/>
third, thanks to you, will be forever <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;delayed, or at least not expected to arrive until well after I&#39;m dead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So thanks everyone for the encouraging words.  <br/>
Once again Sandra was right.  Praise Dodd. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
