<br/>
By Ronald E. Johnson, C.Ph.D.<br/>
<br/>
Lt. Colonel Bushue (SAC) taught me a valuable life lesson: identify what <br/>
you want to do, assess options, make a plan, outline your steps to get <br/>
there, obtain needed resources, and focus on daily priorities that lead <br/>
to goal achievement.  That is the strategy for most successful military <br/>
operations.  An effective home school program follows a similar <br/>
prescription.  Without a clearly defined home school plan, life can <br/>
quickly &quot;turn south&quot;, especially with teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
  Here are some practical strategies my wife and I applied with our <br/>
seven children.  Had these procedures not been in operation, my family <br/>
would have experienced unnecessary stress and disappointment in our home <br/>
school efforts.especially during the extended times when I was required <br/>
to be away from home.<br/>
<br/>
1.       First, decide how you want to conduct your home school.  You <br/>
have  five basic options:<br/>
<br/>
a.       Virtual schools  These are via the internet and can be <br/>
expensive and frustrating if you have multiple age-grade levels among <br/>
your children who need access to the internet and computer.  Some <br/>
virtual school providers offer turn-key packages.  Others offer <br/>
basically on-line guidance and assistance for standard textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
b.      Packaged programs  These are school-in-a-box products: <br/>
everything you need to complete specified courses, some of which require <br/>
a great deal of academic expertise from Mom.  The range of &quot;Mom <br/>
friendliness&quot; varies dramatically!<br/>
<br/>
c.       Eclectic   This simply means that the parents pick and chose <br/>
curriculum from a wide range of resources, including encyclopedias, <br/>
literature books, magazines, CDs, unit studies, field trips, <br/>
conferences, and hardback textbooks.  The advantage is that students <br/>
experience a great deal of emotional and academic stimulation.  The <br/>
disadvantage is that students are often victims of lack of parental <br/>
organization and scheduling.<br/>
<br/>
d.      Lock-step  This means that children are taught in grade level <br/>
textbooks and/or computer software as in public schools.  Mom prepares <br/>
lesson plans for each course for each child (usually very late at <br/>
night), and &quot;teaches&quot; lessons during the day.  The advantage is <br/>
availability of a planned scope and sequence.  The disadvantage is that <br/>
Mom has to give constant, step-by-step, hands-on, undivided attention to <br/>
each child.<br/>
<br/>
e.      Guided individualized learning   This approach allows the <br/>
parents to plan the academic prescription for each child.  Then, place <br/>
them in curriculum that is designed to be completed with minimum <br/>
parental, hands-on oversight.  The advantages are that the mother is <br/>
free to supervise multiple grade levels and subjects simultaneously, <br/>
students experience accelerated learning, and Mom is relieved from the <br/>
requirement to be an academic expert in subjects that are challenging to <br/>
her knowledge, skills and confidence.  The disadvantage is that the <br/>
students must exercise a great deal of self-discipline to stay focused <br/>
on print or computer software that requires the students to &quot;figure it out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.      The second decision concerns values you want to incorporate in <br/>
the instructional materials for each child.  Your options are basically <br/>
these:<br/>
<br/>
a.       Secular textbooks/software, as used in public schools<br/>
<br/>
b.      Religious textbooks/software, as used in church schools<br/>
<br/>
c.       Virtue-based books/software, as used in both religious and <br/>
secular schools.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.      The third area concerns the system you will implement in your <br/>
home.  Your options are these:<br/>
<br/>
a.       Hire a service organization to order your preferred materials <br/>
and keep all student records for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
b.      Work with a home school support group regarding book procurement <br/>
and records.<br/>
<br/>
c.       Set up your own program in which you order materials, keep <br/>
records, provide guidance, and maintain transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4.      The fourth concern is to asses your strengths and skills to <br/>
implement an effective home school program that fits your home (rather <br/>
than the homes of friends).  You should consider the following questions:<br/>
<br/>
a.       Do you feel confident and capable of preparing and teaching <br/>
daily lessons in all subjects for all the grade levels of your children? <br/>
  If not, select individualized materials.<br/>
<br/>
b.      Do you want to use the internet?  If so, each child will need <br/>
access to a computer.<br/>
<br/>
c.       Do you want to use programmed curriculum that does not require <br/>
you to plan or teach each lesson to each child?  If so, you may use the <br/>
computer and/or individualized books.<br/>
<br/>
d.      Do you plan to provide hands-on instruction for each child every <br/>
morning and/or afternoon?  If so, be sure you are a person with great <br/>
organizational skills and can multi-task without stress!<br/>
<br/>
e.      Do you want/need guidelines for a daily system that provides <br/>
academic oversight of your children?  If so, you must be prepared to pay <br/>
for outside services that are either on a one-time or on-going basis.<br/>
<br/>
f.        Do you want/need to belong to a local home-school support <br/>
group that provides assistance with book procurement, tutorials, field <br/>
trips, graduation ceremonies, report cards and transcripts?   (highly <br/>
recommended!)  Check the internet for &quot;home school support groups&quot; in <br/>
your geographic area. These are usually listed under city, county or <br/>
state classifications.<br/>
<br/>
g.      Do you want an eclectic approach in which you provide oversight <br/>
while your children read specific books, participate in field trips, <br/>
engage in tutorials, take lessons from other teachers (music, art, <br/>
chemistry lab, archery, etc)?  If so, be prepared to make adjustments <br/>
for inefficiency, lack of self-discipline, and boredom.  The eclectic <br/>
approach is sometimes beneficial for specific periods of a child&#39;s <br/>
development, but if it is the primary system, it often results in <br/>
students not being prepared for the rigors of college studies.  Nor does <br/>
it allow the student to transfer course credits to regular schools in <br/>
the event the home school experience is no longer an option.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5.      The fifth concern (and perhaps the most important one) is <br/>
selection of curriculum.  Be sure you select curriculum appropriate for <br/>
each student in the home.  One size and format usually does not fit all <br/>
children!  One will need almost constant hands-on attention.  Others <br/>
need only to be pointed in the right direction and turned lose to <br/>
complete academic prescriptions. Children are usually predominately <br/>
choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic, or melancholy, and either right or left <br/>
brain-dominant. Thus, they will perform more effectively when allowed to <br/>
learn from the curriculum and a system that &quot;caters to&quot; their <br/>
temperament and brain dominance.  Right brain students tend to do better <br/>
in hands-on systems that allow a variety, mobility, and freedom to set <br/>
some priorities.  Caution: sanguine and right-brain children tend to get <br/>
side-tracked easily and often, therefore need/require parental oversight <br/>
that ascertains completion of specific daily lessons.  Phlegmatic <br/>
children tend to be laid back and easy going.never getting too concerned <br/>
about completing daily school assignments. Left-brain dominant students <br/>
(often choleric and melancholy) usually do well with structured <br/>
curriculum that allows the student freedom to set specific daily pages, <br/>
projects, lessons and assignments with minimum parental oversight. <br/>
Thus, one particular type of curriculum may not be adequate for all the <br/>
children in the family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6.      Another concern is that of keeping students focused.  Most <br/>
children need at least four hours per day of focused learning.  Stretch <br/>
and/or &quot;chore breaks&quot; of ten to fifteen minutes every hour help break up <br/>
the day, and avoid the tendency for boredom and fatigue.  Soothing <br/>
instrumental music played softly in the room reduces anxiety and impact <br/>
of distractive noises (vacuum cleaner, highway traffic, crying baby). <br/>
Loud talking or media noise should be avoided.  Using an academic <br/>
contract and daily goal chart helps the student learn to set his/her <br/>
daily pace to ascertain that course work is completed by pre-determined <br/>
times and dates.  Parents should be available to monitor student <br/>
behavior and progress, and to teach or tutor specific lessons or <br/>
subjects as needed or scheduled.  A good reminder is &quot;A child left to <br/>
himself will bring his mother shame.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My boot camp sergeant taught me a valuable sequence that has kept me <br/>
focused throughout life.  Here are his requirements which I recommend <br/>
that parents establish in their home-school program:<br/>
<br/>
a.      Get up at a set time each morning,<br/>
<br/>
b.      Make your bed immediately after the feet hit the floor,<br/>
<br/>
c.       Put away sleeping attire and then dress appropriately for the day,<br/>
<br/>
d.      Line up shoes under the bed and hang excess garments on the <br/>
clothes rack,<br/>
<br/>
e.      Report to breakfast at a set time, participate in appropriate <br/>
discussions, eat quietly, put away dirty dishes, and write down orders <br/>
for the day,<br/>
<br/>
f.        Report for duty promptly, fulfill responsibilities and address <br/>
needs that develop.<br/>
<br/>
These concerns are legitimate.  However, they are not to be viewed as <br/>
barriers to parents who are timed about attempting to home educate their <br/>
children.  My wife and I home-schooled our seven children at various <br/>
times during their lives.  We have not regretted that decision to be in <br/>
control of their education.  Every day was not necessarily easy or even <br/>
pleasant.  But the final result was worth the effort.<br/>

<br/>
I couldn&#39;t get that Shouting in a Monotone Voice of a Drill Sergeant out of my head while I was reading this.  This is incredible and a real reminder and wake up call(via bugle)that we unschoolers are certainly forging a different, and better, path.<br/>
<br/>
Favorite part: &quot;Make your bed immediately after the feet hit the floor. Put away sleeping attire and then dress appropriately for the day.&quot;  (Sleeping attire??  As Bill Murray said in Stripes, &quot;Don&#39;t you think this guy&#39;s overdoing it a bit?&quot;)<br/>
