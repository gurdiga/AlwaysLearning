<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554509929">I am having problems with my son&#39;s behaviour and i was talking to my<br/>
friend who is a LLL and she said to me that she has been telling me<br/>
for years to see a counselor. I had a long phone talk with her about<br/>
my son&#39;s actions and she said if she was me she would be crazy!<br/>
 I told her i was on the unschooling lists and some moms mention that<br/>
they too have high needs,very emotional kids and i got reassured when<br/>
they said the kids were better with age. However, she said: yes,but<br/>
your not living in peace now, your whole household is stressed!<br/>
 I have read The Explosive child book, done the things it said.<br/>
 Let me now explain by examples how and when these constant outbursts<br/>
occur. My 6 yo. son asks for a toy yesterday. I answer that I have no<br/>
money but daddy gets paid tomorrow and we can get it for him. Son:<br/>
screaming, knocking over the garbage can, shouting I hate you!<br/>
 I always try to validate his feelings (NO BABY TALK) A few moments<br/>
later son wants to sit on the couch but wants me off,demands i get off<br/>
the couch! I tell him i just sat down and he can sit next to me. Again<br/>
an instant fit! A hour hour later son is playing with a toy and having<br/>
some trouble, i offer to help but he screams no! I hate you! I quit!<br/>
 I&#39;m leaving this house!! This happens all day. Most times i don&#39;t get<br/>
a chance to say a word before he rages. I told my friend that i<br/>
thought by nursing him until 4yo,sleeping with him, respecting<br/>
him,unschooling,etc. that he would be nice to us. My friend said i<br/>
shouldn&#39;t blame myself, That i am doing everything right. Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
food, allergy or something else. Should i get him evaluated? He does<br/>
do better when i put a daily cap. of fish oil in his juice. Have other<br/>
Unschoolers had their kids evaluated? Is this a good idea? My husband<br/>
said he acts this way because he&#39;s with me all the time. That he needs<br/>
to go somewhere with someone else or other kids for awhile. My husband<br/>
said it&#39;s so bad he doesn&#39;t want to take him anywhere...anymore. Son<br/>
had his friend over today and he is not to kind to his friend.  my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814316771">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;I am having problems with my son&#39;s behaviour and i was talking to my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; friend who is a LLL and she said to me that she has been telling me<br/>
&gt; for years to see a counselor. I had a long phone talk with her about<br/>
&gt; my son&#39;s actions and she said if she was me she would be crazy!....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you say &quot;evaluated&quot; are you talking about taking him to a psychiatrist?<br/>
<br/>
What will any evaluation give you? Maybe you would like more &quot;it&#39;s not your <br/>
fault&quot; validation. Will it make you more able to love, accept and help your <br/>
son in his day to day struggle to mature, or will you start seeing him as <br/>
broken and be looking for a treatment of some kind.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  However, she said: yes,but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your not living in peace now, your whole household is stressed! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You told us about your son, yourself and dh - is this the whole household? <br/>
(I&#39;m just trying to get the full picture.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I have read The Explosive child book, done the things it said.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you think it was going to effect a &quot;cure&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; Let me now explain by examples how and when these constant outbursts<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; occur. My 6 yo. son &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah.<br/>
<br/>
When people talk about &quot;better with age&quot; they are usually talking about how <br/>
pleasant and calm and controlled and helpful and self aware their pre-teen <br/>
and teenaged children are.<br/>
<br/>
If you read &quot;Your Six Year Old&quot; (Louise Ames) you will see that Six is just <br/>
about the most volatile year there is in a huge number of cases. The <br/>
extremes of any particular temperament will be more extreme at six.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; A few moments<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; later son wants to sit on the couch but wants me off,demands i get off<br/>
&gt; the couch! I tell him i just sat down and he can sit next to me. Again<br/>
&gt; an instant fit! &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He was still trying to empty his stress cup. What ways does he have to <br/>
express stress other than just screaming at you? (Don&#39;t take it personally.)<br/>
<br/>
Was your sitting on the couch really worth putting in the &quot;non-negotiable <br/>
basket&quot;, to use some of the lingo from The Explosive Child?<br/>
<br/>
Jayn likes to be held or stroked a lot of the time when she is raging. <br/>
However I notice that many, many mothers report the opposite of their <br/>
children. Maybe being next to you would be sensory overload at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  My friend said i<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shouldn&#39;t blame myself, That i am doing everything right. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Forget about doing everything right, and forget about this adversarial <br/>
mindset. I think what is happening with this is that you are following a <br/>
formula and expecting a specific result - staying &quot;results focused&quot;. I <br/>
suspect that you had a mental time frame that was pretty darn short. <br/>
Unschooling has shown me to make the next moment better, and eventually all <br/>
the moments add up.<br/>
<br/>
I never got the idea that The Explosive Child was a &quot;recipe book&quot;. It was a <br/>
way of changing thinking and then behavior by the parents so that living <br/>
with the inevitable rages of these volatile young personalities became <br/>
easier with time - so that they develop and learn without being overly <br/>
damaged by being treated in ways that caused them to become defensive and <br/>
feel worse about themselves.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; she said if she was me she would be crazy &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t set your personal bar at this other person&#39;s low place. I would <br/>
probably stop confiding in someone who so consistently gave me such negative <br/>
feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Instead read about Unschoolers with spirited children who have had successes <br/>
over time and NOT been driven crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Danielle Conger has a boy who raged, less now than when he was younger. Her <br/>
energy in helping him and keeping her other two girls safe genuinely <br/>
inspires awe. She has lots of things written at her website.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Go to this place - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/peace/robyn">http://sandradodd.com/peace/robyn</a>  Don&#39;t worry about <br/>
reading what I wrote if you don&#39;t want to, but scroll to the end where you <br/>
will find Treegoddess&#39;s list of really helpful physical activities to <br/>
facilitate emotional reorganization. Sandra has very helpfully colored it <br/>
green, so it is easy to see.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My husband said he acts this way because he&#39;s with me all the time. <br/>
That he needs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to go somewhere with someone else or other kids for awhile.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> A veiled &quot;he should be in school&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Your son may need more outside time or less or more climbing or more protein <br/>
or more friend time or less enforced social time or more fun with Dad or <br/>
Grandpa or any number of things being done differently.<br/>
<br/>
However not being with Mom won&#39;t change his temperament. It might make him <br/>
feel he has to &quot;hold it in&quot; and then it explodes out, or he might find he is <br/>
able to rage and release safely with others also if they love him.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to be your son&#39;s &quot;safe place&quot;? I know I want to be so for Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My husband<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; said it&#39;s so bad he doesn&#39;t want to take him anywhere...anymore. Son<br/>
&gt; had his friend over today and he is not to kind to his friend.  my<br/>
&gt; husband does take him where he asks to go. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe more playdates on neutral territory like the park?<br/>
<br/>
How does you dh interact with him on these outings? Does he take ds where he <br/>
asks to go with joy and let him lead/set the pace during the outing, or is <br/>
dh taking him out, but staying in charge and setting out expectations and <br/>
trying to mediate ds&#39;s experience? Are they staying too long and ds is <br/>
getting stressed? Are they leaving too quickly?<br/>
<br/>
Has dh read or discussed The Explosive Child?<br/>
<br/>
Jayn used to be a very calm baby. She had gotten more volatile/explosive <br/>
over time, peaking I would say at about 6.5. She is only now starting to <br/>
retreat some from raging, and often doesn&#39;t treat us nicely. She nursed <br/>
until three days ago (so age 8). Nursing doesn&#39;t change temperament, even if <br/>
it heightens attachment and enhances health, as we all hope it does.<br/>
<br/>
I have faith that we are on the right path, even if we have moments of <br/>
wobbling. The alternative paths have no better guarantee.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957309646">The friend is a John Holt fan and the best i have right now to talk<br/>
too. My mother is toxic,grandpa is good but he comes here. I will not<br/>
drop Lukas off at their house because my parents are too old to run<br/>
after him if he runs out the door and my mom has done some dangerous<br/>
stuff around Lukas. My friend says have him evaluated my a counsuler I<br/>
think. She said his behaviour is not apropriate(sp) that it&#39;s verbal<br/>
abuse and when you go out people don&#39;t treat each other like that.She<br/>
did say that she does think a child that can&#39;t sit still for awhile<br/>
should be rugged...natural herbal medicine. Lukas does sit still.<br/>
That&#39;s not a problem. I am still reading your good post but wanted to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185417294">Robyn did a much beter job at writing that I could have ever done.<br/>
  I wanted to add that  limiting his play on his NIntendo DS like you told us you did a while ago are probably just going to add to his rages.<br/>
   <br/>
  If I was a child I would have gotten really mad if my mom had limited my play with something I love ( luckly she never did).<br/>
   <br/>
  My ds gets very frustrated and mad when he is having a hard time playing his video games.<br/>
  I have not limit his time. Once he can get whatever he was trying to do done he is so happy with himself and moves on (until next challenge!)<br/>
   <br/>
  I try to be proactive and offer breaks, feed him, and give him drinks , sit with him and share some playing(connection).  I even spoon feed him if he needs. He still rages but that is OK.<br/>
  I am glad he feels comfortable enough to be able to fully express his feelings in front of me.<br/>
  I love when he gets mad and comes to tell me about  the &quot;dumb ashes&quot;.<br/>
  <br/>
Heather you have a choice to see your son, and his personality traits as <br/>
  a good thing, a wonfderful, energetic, passionate, boisterous, child or someone to be fixed.<br/>
  We know what his father thinks already and that is sad. I am sure he can pick up on that.<br/>
   <br/>
  It must be hard to grow up feeling you have something wrong with you, that you are not good enough for your parents, that you need to be fixed. Don&#39;t let that happen to you son. Like Robyn said he is only 6 years old. He is a small child that needs more of his mom and dad not less.<br/>

It might take a year.  Each decision will move you closer to a better  <br/>
relationship, or further away.  Each day, your son will get older,  <br/>
too.  Tomorrow won&#39;t be just like today.  It will be better or worse,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345068133">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Maybe a counsulor<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; could give me tools to work with? Help me understand what going on and<br/>
&gt; why? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
More likely if the counsellor understands unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe tools to change who your son is meant to be if they are a <br/>
mainstream person invested in school think. Risk assessment needed. You <br/>
don&#39;t need our permission, you know. People have stories of positive <br/>
experiences, and negative ones. Try searching archives.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers *definitely* can give you tools to work with that can help you <br/>
be an Unschooling mindful parent.<br/>
<br/>
What is most likely going on is that your son is six, spirited, free and <br/>
loved.<br/>
<br/>
Our free little children don&#39;t look like controlled, molded, shamed, <br/>
rewarded/punished, directed little children. They often look wild, fearless, <br/>
determined, raw. Sometimes they look too big for a controlled, disciplined, <br/>
&quot;proper&quot; society. They experiment. They feel and express themselves, <br/>
including their negative emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Then suddenly, like a miracle that we don&#39;t notice until after it is <br/>
accomplished - like the peach tree suddenly being covered in blooms - our <br/>
wild, difficult, outspoken little children, are creative, open, thoughtful, <br/>
outspoken yet courteous, loving, acceptant and tolerant, self-aware and <br/>
optimistic teenagers and young adults. They aren&#39;t secretly self <br/>
destructive, or strangers to their parents.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She said his behaviour is not apropriate(sp) that it&#39;s verbal<br/>
abuse and when you go out people don&#39;t treat each other like that.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See I think this is a *very* mainstream judgmental attitude, and is probably <br/>
not helping your serenity. If you choose to label your son as an &quot;abuser&quot; it <br/>
is so much harder to be compassionate to him. We can choose the descriptors <br/>
we use. Your son is 6 and struggling and probably feels powerless. He is not <br/>
an adult with power abusing you. Perhaps he needs more help than a child to <br/>
whom social niceties come easily. Maybe he needs not to be taken to places <br/>
that trigger his behavior or spark fears. Sometimes it is something as <br/>
simple as flickering neon lights. (In Jayn&#39;s case, big echoey places, big <br/>
dark places.)<br/>
<br/>
Certainly there is a time to explain that people shouldn&#39;t treat each other <br/>
badly. That time is not in the middle of a meltdown. But it is also <br/>
important to consider what is possible and achievable for any individual <br/>
child&#39;s development level. Constantly expecting more from him than he can <br/>
truly give will only make him feel worse about himself.<br/>

&gt; screaming, knocking over the garbage can, shouting I hate you!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>make sure you are planning for a fit when you say no- be prepared <br/>
for an outburst--- lots of times I would say- no we can not get that <br/>
but lets go find a candy bar instead. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I always try to validate his feelings (NO BABY TALK)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my daughter did not really want talking-the more I talked the worse <br/>
she got- she would say- I have it in my head now you do not need to <br/>
tell me- she was 3 and 4<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 A few moments<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; later son wants to sit on the couch but wants me off,demands i get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>off<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the couch! I tell him i just sat down and he can sit next to me. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; an instant fit!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would try hey sit next to me and then a tickle and playful- hey I <br/>
would love to get of your couch and sit in this nice chair. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 A hour hour later son is playing with a toy and having<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; some trouble, i offer to help but he screams no! I hate you! I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>quit!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I&#39;m leaving this house!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my daughter did this too- we started a game called &quot;your out of the <br/>
family&quot; so I would laugh and say well your out of the family so good <br/>
bye andthen she would laugh-- if she walked out the door I would not <br/>
chase her because she would then realize I was behind her and be <br/>
able to save her but by not going after her she realized wuickly she <br/>
was on her own- this may work only for some kids who would realize <br/>
that they were on their own. She has not done this in a long time<br/>
<br/>
 I told my friend that i<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thought by nursing him until 4yo,sleeping with him, respecting<br/>
&gt; him,unschooling,etc. that he would be nice to us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just because you are nice to someone does not make it all click- <br/>
This was the biggest problem with attachment parenting it was just <br/>
about being nice<br/>
<br/>
he needs something eles- sometimes I would tell my daughter- when <br/>
you yell at me it makes me feel like not getting that for you but <br/>
since I love you I will. The other day she started yelling when a <br/>
friend was here who conventionally parents and I saw her hold her <br/>
breath to see what punishment my daughter got- I raised my voice to <br/>
her level and said- why are you yelling- then she said something and <br/>
I said you are yelling because you are fursterrated. Then it was over<br/>
<br/>
My daughters are now 5 and 3 and they have changed so much in the <br/>
last year of unschooling and I would not change it- does not mean <br/>
they never rage or meltdown but it is few and far between now and <br/>
usually when they are tired. So yes they CAN change but sometimes <br/>
they do not and if you have been doing this for a while instead of <br/>
thinking he will change try thinking that you will find ways to cope <br/>
and deal with it and not expect him to be different<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 My friend said i<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shouldn&#39;t blame myself, That i am doing everything right. Maybe <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; food, allergy or something else. Should i get him evaluated?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>what do you want to find out? If there is a magical reason he is <br/>
acting this way and a magical fix? Stop thinking about fixing him <br/>
and just love him and live with him.<br/>
<br/>
evaluated for what? at best you will get some form ADD or ADHA or <br/>
sensory issues, maybe aspie scale- they will probably want to put <br/>
him on meds even though it will not fix or end the behavior and you <br/>
will spend the next forever years going from med to med from dose to <br/>
dose and it will NEVER get better. You know he is high energy, <br/>
spirtited, what more do you want to know. <br/>
<br/>
 My husband<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; said he acts this way because he&#39;s with me all the time. That he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>needs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to go somewhere with someone else or other kids for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not true- though my mom thought this a little bit too. Putting him <br/>
around other kids will not help and probably hurt them or him<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 My husband<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; said it&#39;s so bad he doesn&#39;t want to take him anywhere...anymore. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Son<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; had his friend over today and he is not to kind to his friend.  my<br/>
&gt; husband does take him where he asks to go. please give me advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you think he needs from you? From dad? does he need more say <br/>
so- more &quot;if--- then&quot; stuff- this works good with my two &quot;if you go <br/>
potty I will fix your drink&quot;-- If you pick up toys with me then we <br/>
can read books- most the time they do it but sometimes I get a no <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182330890">why would reading a book all day be &quot;good&quot; but playing video games <br/>
be &quot;bad&quot; -- I would let him play as long as he wants and if he is upset <br/>
talk about being upset when you do not know how to do something and <br/>
ways you can learn about the game in order to master it.<br/>
<br/>
when he learned how to walk or crawl did you limit him to an hour of <br/>
practice a day because it was too much stress?<br/>

It&#39;s the second one, about making video games easier.  You would do  <br/>
it if he were trying to learn to write or ride a bike; you would help  <br/>
him.  (And if you just took the pencils and paper away, or took the  <br/>
bike away, he&#39;d probably get angry, and who could blame him?)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe hire an older kid to come play video games with him sometimes.   <br/>
Don&#39;t say &quot;can&#39;t afford it,&quot; because you&#39;re talking about considering  <br/>
&quot;evaluation&quot; which would lead to drugs and maybe government  <br/>
intervention.    A mother&#39;s helper to play with him while you&#39;re  <br/>
there might make a world of difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769709223">great responses! also i&#39;m wondering if he may also be overstimulated visually or another form of sensory issues. not to label or define him but to better understand him (beyond the age factor). i have this and never understood it until recently and it makes my life so much easier to understand that my senses are just overstimulated!  i didn&#39;t know how to relate to it verbally so when i hit MAX it often &quot;came&quot;  so agressively i couldn&#39;t deal with the overload so *explosion*.<br/>

didn&#39;t you say you lived around brevard county? i live in titusville maybe we can get together!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621866371">There is so much good advice on this thread I just wanted to give an <br/>
opinion about this one point - it is something that took me a long <br/>
time to come to understand.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I agree with that but it is really good for him to play all day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I let him play for months thinking he would take an interest in other<br/>
things but he didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have come to believe that our children can sense when we <br/>
are &quot;letting&quot; them do &quot;xyz&quot; (in this case games) while secretly <br/>
hoping they will do something we feel is more worthwile.  They know <br/>
there is no true acceptance of their choice - parent is tolerating <br/>
but displeased with their choice.  Perhaps this could be damaging <br/>
sons trust in you, undermining his sense of security and further <br/>
complicating the rage and frustration issues.<br/>

able to find peace. There is so much to learn here, keep reading.<br/>

<h4>ENSEMBLE S-WAYNFORTH</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649612651">For me one of the hardest things when Linnaea gets frustrated and unhappy is making room for her. Often I feel pressed by other things, other commitments. So, last night, for example. I came up to bed and Linnaea was sitting on the foot of Simon&#39;s bed and David and Simon were irritated with her. And suddenly I felt burdened by everybody elses need for sleep and calm and rational as well as a need to help Linnaea negotiate through whatever she need negotiating through. The hard thing for me is being able to shunt aside those feelings and take care of her in that moment. It is important that you figure out a way to put Lukas before your friend&#39;s needs and your husband&#39;s nneeds in those moments where he needs you to be there for him, even if he is telling you to go away (you can always give him space, but try and do it generously and try not to say &quot;fine, I&#39;ll just go then&quot; in the angry, hurt voice of someone who is taking it personally). Just like Linnaea<br/>
 needs me to be there for her in those moments which often come when something else is pressing. Same for Simon, except he is usually likely to get tense when we are leaving to go and do something. Again a moment when I feel pressed by other people&#39;s needs, even when I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend wants to fix it for you, she wants to help you feel better, she feels that by giving to your son he will learn that he can get his way when he behaves meanly or badly. The problem with that assessment is that it believes that  Lukas enjoys, or at least doesn&#39;t mind, being angry and tense and stressed and yelling. I don&#39;t like that feeling that way. It hurts, my stomach hurts, my head hurts, I get thirsty, it isn&#39;t any fun. I don&#39;t imagine that Lukas enjoys that feeling either. If instead of looking at it from your friend&#39;s perspective, look at it from his, if he can see his mom reaching out to help him when he is angry and upset, when his stress cup is full (as Robyn put it) he will feel supported. Just that support will help to empty some of his stress. It won&#39;t empty it. It isn&#39;t a cure-all. But it will help. Figuring out how to negotiate with big emotions, with intense feelings is a hard job. If  you can help him to have the space and the<br/>
 time to move from rage to calm, and it can take hours particularly at first, he will be better equipped to deal with those feelings as he ages. I didn&#39;t have help and I have big anger issues still. Linnaea and I try and coach each other, she will tell me to breathe when I start to get angry. Helping Linnaea is helping me as well. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Once I started responding to Liam the way I could see *he* apparently <br/>
wanted me to respond to him (rather than the way I thought he wanted <br/>
me to respond to him) things gradually began to get easier and easier <br/>
and easier.  Initially, my instincts told me that when he was <br/>
frustrated to be there for him and be soothing and try to help.  But, <br/>
though that all seems nice, that was obviously not what he needed or <br/>
wanted!  (And, in retrospect, it was, ahem, rather grandiose of me to <br/>
want to be the solution to his every problem.)  He needed space to <br/>
feel and express his frustration, only he did not know how to tell me <br/>
that&#39;s what he wanted.  Once I finally got it, everything was able to <br/>
get better.  And, the sooner I was able to get myself out of his way, <br/>
the less need he had to rage.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, three things sustained me:<br/>
<br/>
1.  I *decided* to feel honored to be Liam&#39;s safe place where he <br/>
could express the ugliest thoughts and yet know he was incredibly and <br/>
thoroughly loved and adored,<br/>
<br/>
2.  Where possible, I would offer constructive help (like &quot;Do you <br/>
want me to look that up and see if there&#39;s a way to beat that <br/>
boss?&quot;), and if he said OK, good, but if not, I&#39;d back off, and<br/>
<br/>
3.  I decided not to take his rages personally.<br/>
<br/>
Liam at age 13 is the same person as Liam at age 6 and younger.  But, <br/>
he is so intensely considerate and sweet and kind and loving now.  I <br/>
am not saying that what I did *worked*.  Again, in retrospect, I see <br/>
that we were on a path of adversity, though that was not my conscious <br/>
choice.  I think that by being willing to abandon my grandiose <br/>
notions of how I should parent, we were able to get on a better path <br/>
that had less to do with my ego and more to do with allowing Liam the <br/>
space to discover himself and who he really is on his own terms.<br/>
<br/>
~Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  LLLs are great, but having been one myself, I learned early on <br/>
that being a LLL is not necessarily a guarantee that that person&#39;s <br/>
parenting skills will be worthy of emulation, and parenting advice <br/>
from all sources is to be taken with at least a grain of salt.<br/>

helping him do, and if you really do that for a long time,  <br/>
consistently, and sweetly and generously, he won&#39;t want to sit on a  <br/>
couch in anger without you.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t happen in a few days.   It won&#39;t happen in a week.<br/>

  Would it make the same sense if his &#39;inside/non-active&#39; time was spent reading or playing with Legos?  Or is this more about her bias against video games?  The whole &#39;delay TV/video games, and exclude &#39;bad&#39; food&#39; is a very common ideal in LLL (speaking as a former leader myself).   It&#39;s always bothered me that, when babies are small, LLL and AP folks are all about &#39;following the child&#39;s cues&#39; but somewhere around 2 or 3yo (when kids are very self-determined) it becomes all about parents controlling and preventing &#39;bad influences.&#39;  Why is it they can trust the cues of a newborn, but not a 2yo?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448673265">What would your son rather be doing with his time? How can you help <br/>
him accomplish what he really wants to be doing? Maybe since you <br/>
started controlling him more he is acting out more. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I am tired and in a controlling parent mood I think <br/>
how nice it would be to give out orders and have the children follow <br/>
them- I mean so much less work on MY part- but then I remember what <br/>
they were like before and decide I do not want those kids back. <br/>
<br/>
Stop talking to a friend who wants you to conventionally parent- in <br/>
fact whatever she tells you you do the opposite- that way you will <br/>
know you are un the unschooly path. Stop talking to her about your <br/>
issues with your son-- talk about anything except the child.<br/>
<br/>
Really listen to him and ask him what he wants or needs you to do <br/>
and then do it. Tell people who think you are indulging him that the <br/>
more you are taken care of the more you can in turn take care of. <br/>
The more you are listened to the more you can listen, the more you <br/>
are heard and respected the more you can respect someone else. <br/>

are small, LLL and AP folks are all about &#39;following the child&#39;s <br/>
cues&#39; but somewhere around 2 or 3yo (when kids are very self-<br/>

preventing &#39;bad influences.&#39;  Why is it they can trust the cues of a <br/>
newborn, but not a 2yo?  <br/>
