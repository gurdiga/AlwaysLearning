<div id="ygrps-yiv-757430192">Back in February Darin quit his job and went to school to learn how to drive <br/>
semi trucks. He got hired by a great company out of Springfield, Missouri and <br/>
is now on the road with a trainer and will get his own truck at the end of his <br/>
training period. (90 days) Since he left for school and then started with <br/>
this company we haven&#39;t seen him for more than two or three days every few weeks. <br/>
We did expect this and the kids are adjusting to it, better than Darin and I <br/>
are at this point.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now we are at a big decision point. None of us like it here in our town <br/>
and have been wanting to move for some time. We have a few options. One, we <br/>
(the kids and I) can move to Springfield and we would be able to see Darin a <br/>
little more and we would be in a town that has lots more to offer than the one <br/>
we live in now. And we can take turns going with Darin on runs as the company <br/>
allows one rider at a time in company trucks. Or two, Darin can get his own <br/>
truck (expensive, but the company offers a great program to get your own truck <br/>
and work for them making even more money than as a company driver) and we can <br/>
all go with him. <br/>
<br/>
We have met two different families that do this. One family has a small child <br/>
that isn&#39;t &quot;school age&quot; and they all go together with the plan that when <br/>
their son reaches school age she and the son will find a home in Springfield so he <br/>
can go to school. The other family has kids our kids ages and they sold <br/>
everything, have a mail box at the company store, (to establish residency in <br/>
Missouri because of lenient hsing laws there) and they do school at home on the road <br/>
and their kids love it. Although the mother of that family did express the <br/>
concern about us being unschoolers, but we get that from school at home folks <br/>
anyway. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We are split on this decision. Darin and I both realize that living in a <br/>
truck is unconventional, the trucks are big, but not that big, the kids would have <br/>
to give up lots of things and we would too. But we would all be together and <br/>
that is really what we all want the most. OTOH, Springfield has lots to offer <br/>
and I would love to live in that area. We have looked into the cost <br/>
differences, between a house payment, utilities, etc... and living in the truck (truck <br/>
payments, food on the road, we would have a small fridge in the truck) and the <br/>
costs are about the same, living on the road being slightly (read not much) <br/>
cheaper. Darin would make almost three times as much as an owner than as a <br/>
company driver. But the costs aren&#39;t what is making the decision difficult because <br/>
even now in his training period Darin is making twice what he made before. I <br/>
guess the difficulty in the decision boils down to logistics, comfort, living <br/>
that close to each other ... and things like would we be depriving the kids of <br/>
things that they would have living in one place vs. the opportunity to see all <br/>
sorts of places in the US and Canada, the ability to drop a load off and say <br/>
we like it here, lets hang out for a few days before we call and say we are <br/>
ready to take the next load. Like Darin said, if the kids and I didn&#39;t like it, <br/>
it&#39;s not like we couldn&#39;t get a place to live. <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering what some of you would think, presented with an idea like this?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to drive a truck.  I figure if something catastrophic <br/>
happened to my family, I&#39;d just go off and drive a truck for the rest of my life, <br/>
drive my grief away.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I don&#39;t think any of my kids could tolerate long hours on the road <br/>
day after day as a lifestyle.  For a week or two or a month or a summer, <br/>
maybe?  My kids would be asking, &quot;what about baseball?&quot; and &quot;what about my <br/>
friends?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like you&#39;d get to stop at Dinosaur World every time you came across <br/>
it, is it?  I need lots of alone time, too.  I don&#39;t think it would be for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318424740">Wow! What a big decision. I can see how you can &quot;try&quot; the one traveler <br/>
at a time option and see how that works for a while, but it sounds like <br/>
if you do the buy a truck option you are going to be locked in to it, <br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
I personally couldn&#39;t imagine choosing the option of all traveling <br/>
together if there were no &quot;home base&quot; to come to. As much as I love to <br/>
travel, I spent a month basically with no home to go to, and it was a <br/>
horrible thing, and something I never want to repeat. If that option <br/>
could be combined with a home base where people could stay, say, during <br/>
baseball weeks, or when they&#39;re sick I think it could be manageable.<br/>
<br/>
If it were my family I think I&#39;d plan on working with the company&#39;s <br/>
truck for a few months, then trying to spring for a small house or <br/>
apartment combined with the extra income of owning the truck. But not <br/>
burn any bridges unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
But your family may be different--it&#39;s hard to know for someone else.<br/>

#########<br/>
<br/>
Exactly some of the things we have been debating. Alone time, not being able <br/>
to stop just any old time, friends... It&#39;s not like we would be in a mobile <br/>
home! Here in our current town, the kids just don&#39;t have that may friends. Sad <br/>
but true. Although we realize that going out on the road would prevent making <br/>
friends in a new town. We have been discussing going out with Darin six to nine <br/>
months out of the year. Darin doesn&#39;t want us with him during the winter <br/>
months as he will be doing most of his runs through the West over the Rocky and <br/>
Sierra Nevada Mountains, and into Canada, although he will do some East Coast <br/>
runs too. Then the kids and I would either rent a place or stay with my folks, <br/>
or visit other family. He gets two to three days off every ten to fourteen days <br/>
and he can save his days up by working through four or five weeks and then <br/>
taking a week off. That way we could do extra things like stopping at Dinosaur <br/>
World. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
That is what I am thinking, I doubt the kids would want to do something like <br/>
this here in three or four years. I also want to have another baby and I <br/>
really doubt I would want to lug an infant around in a truck, especially since <br/>
there isn&#39;t anywhere to put a car seat! And what baby would want to sit in one day <br/>
after day? <br/>
<br/>
I guess the one thing is that so many times in the past we have never been <br/>
able to afford to do some of the things the kids and I want to do. I have always <br/>
wanted to go to the conferences and could never afford it. I traveled all <br/>
over as a child and really miss that, I still have that itchy foot! Now I see the <br/>
way for us to do things like conferences, and traveling. I could tell Darin <br/>
to schedule a run to what ever city the conference was being held in and he <br/>
could drop us off! And we would have the money to do it!!! <br/>
<br/>
The biggest thing is I&#39;m still madly in love with my husband. I think I love <br/>
him more now than I did when we got married! I miss him so much it hurts. The <br/>
kids are so attached to him too, probably more to him than me even! I just <br/>
don&#39;t want our missing Darin so much clouding our judgment. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330060525">Hello Nancy and all -<br/>
Nancy, thank you so much for sharing of yourself while you consider your <br/>
options!<br/>
<br/>
You said that your kids just don&#39;t have that many friends in your current <br/>
town - what a plus!  I&#39;m always telling my kids that anything that is a perceived <br/>
negative can be a perceived positive, too!   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think what you wrote here is especially beautiful!  Your family has a lot <br/>
of love and wants to be together!  Perhaps &#39;trying to have judgment&#39; is <br/>
clouding your Judgment!   I&#39;m listening to Indigo Girls and one of their songs ends <br/>
with &quot;.....And the greatest gift of all is to know love....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Being on the road can be hard.  Being home without him can be hard.  So the <br/>
potential difficulties are similar perhaps - which scenario allows for the <br/>
potential joy?  <br/>
<br/>
Only you and your family can look at all the bits, but the pieces you&#39;ve <br/>
shared lead me to think, perhaps, that things could be pointing to this <br/>
opportunity as being real for your family right now.   No attachment to where you are <br/>
now?  A strong desire to be together as a family?  An awareness of the temporary <br/>
nature of this opportunity (in terms of children&#39;s willingness and your <br/>
desire to have another child)?  The existence of family/friends who can host you <br/>
for extended stays?  <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Nancy - imo - sounds scary and exciting!  <br/>
<br/>
Jane<br/>
