<div id="ygrps-yiv-611767469">&quot;Television is a chewing gum for the eyes,&quot; says Frank Lloyd Wright.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s quoted on the TV turnoff site.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright.&quot;  That&#39;s a famous name.  He must be right.<br/>
<br/>
When Frank Lloyd Wright died, TV was less than ten years old,  <br/>
really.  He was in Arizona.  They hadn&#39;t had TV until early 50&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Lloyd Wright was an architect.  He was an engineer and an  <br/>
artist.  He wasn&#39;t a good husband or a good father.  He probably  <br/>
didn&#39;t spend much time watching TV, in his late 80&#39;s, when TV  <br/>
broadcast was first broad.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, right.  He was born in 1867.  Horse and buggy days, totally.   <br/>
Trains.  Pre-radio, pre-automobile, way pre-airplane.<br/>
<br/>
So these anti-TV people are making a supremely odd move by quoting  <br/>
him about TV.<br/>
<br/>
And this reminds me, too, to mention that John Holt wasn&#39;t keen on  <br/>
TV.  He was also fairly old when TV came along, and he was  <br/>
childless.  He wasn&#39;t a bad father, because he wasn&#39;t a father at  <br/>
all, which is fine.<br/>
<br/>
When John Holt visited families, they had company and so probably  <br/>
didn&#39;t have the TV on.  When he was  home, he did a ton of reading  <br/>
and writing.  I don&#39;t criticize that, because it&#39;s most of what I do  <br/>
with my own days.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt easily retracted his statement and belief that cursive was  <br/>
faster than printing when some kids raced him and beat him.  He quit  <br/>
justifying cursive writing as being necessarily faster after that.<br/>
<br/>
If John Holt were here now, he&#39;d have changed his mind about TV,  <br/>
because what he cared about was learning.   Many of us have children  <br/>
who have clearly and repeatedly demonstrated a TON of learning from  <br/>
TV, video at home, video online, etc. He would see that and be  <br/>
changed, because he was learning all the time.<br/>
