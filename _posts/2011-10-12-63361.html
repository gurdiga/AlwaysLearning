<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013291269">Pam Sorooshian explained the problem with the idea of &quot;child-led learning&quot; as a phrase, as a description of unschooling, or as a definition here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/">http://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/</a><br/>
<br/>
I went to link it to my site a couple of places, and thought about pointing out what I think its origins are, so we don&#39;t throw the nursing babies out with the bathwater.<br/>
<br/>
La Leche League has long used the phrase &quot;child-led weaning,&quot; to discourage moms from &quot;leading&quot; the weaning, or from looking at the calendar or the birthdays instead of at the child.  When the child is done, then it&#39;s done or, for the more conservative, when the child is slowing down, that&#39;s the only time to consider beginning to discourage it.<br/>
<br/>
Because so many unschoolers came out of La Leche League, I think (can&#39;t prove this but it seems right) that&#39;s why the phrase &quot;child-led learning&quot; cropped up independently in various places.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that it&#39;s not a good parallel.  LLL doesn&#39;t talk about &quot;child-led breastfeeding&quot; or &quot;child-led nursing.&quot;   That, they&#39;re clear about, is the mom&#39;s job to facilitate and to embrace and understand and Get Right.  If the mom doesn&#39;t figure out how to do it (the baby already knows, pretty much, but moms can be awkward and screw it up), it might not happen.<br/>
<br/>
So with unschooling.  If the mom doesn&#39;t figure out how to facilitate learning (the children already know how to learn, if they haven&#39;t been to school so long they have scars on their learning), unschooling might not happen.<br/>
<br/>
So for weaning, I think &quot;child-led&quot; is great.<br/>
For nursing and learning, moms need to be at their best, on a team, but leading and managing, especially at first.<br/>
