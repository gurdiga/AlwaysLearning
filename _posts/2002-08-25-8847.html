&gt; of only people who had been herded through the public school system, and<br/>
&gt; not at all of free and inspired young unschoolers.  Dang.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And worse. Not only do many of us need to be nudged to do things we REALLY <br/>
want to do, sometimes we even LIKE someone else to organize our material for <br/>
us - for learning something WE want to learn. I figured out how to make <br/>
candles of all kinds, on my own and by reading books and asking friends and <br/>
experimenting. But I signed up for a ceramics class and learned about it from <br/>
someone I really respected and trusted and who organized the steps and gave <br/>
me assignments to help me learn.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about the scene in Karate Kid where his future sensei notices <br/>
the kid trying to learn Karate on his own, from a book. How much better for <br/>
the kid to have  a brilliant teacher to figure out what he needed to do to <br/>
learn what he wanted to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing for some of the things my kids want to learn (more so as they get <br/>
older)...sometimes they just want to investigate and talk and fool around and <br/>
pick up knowledge and information and skills as they happen, serendipitously <br/>
-- but sometimes they want to learn from someone who gets the material <br/>
organized for them in advance and gives it to them in a useful way.<br/>
<br/>
Picking it up as it occurs in daily life is the BEST way to learn algebraic <br/>
concepts, but not the best way to learn all the rules and manipulations, <br/>
etc., that are algebraic methods. That&#39;s easier to learn (once the basic <br/>
concepts are internalized) by using material organized in a systematic way <br/>
that works for the individual - might mean using manipulatives, might be in a <br/>
story form, might be learned through &quot;investigations,&quot; etc. Just like it is <br/>
NICE to have access to good materials that are well-organized, <br/>
well-thought-out, well-written, etc., it is also a great blessing to have <br/>
people in our lives like that, too.<br/>
<br/>
I know &quot;not-unschooling&quot; when I see it &lt;G&gt; - it is not a parent or teacher <br/>
deciding what a kid should learn, when they should learn it, how they should <br/>
learn it, and IF they&#39;ve learned it (through testing or evaluating). But our <br/>
unschooling lives change and grow and what seemed obvious when my kids were <br/>
little is definitely not so obvious now. The lines seem harder to draw.<br/>

&gt; nice reminders we all give each other, it sounded like something else.  <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t make anyone do anything around here, except maybe myself.&lt;g&gt;   I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t make my husband take out the trash and I wouldn&#39;t make my son<br/>
&gt; practice piano.    <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t &quot;make them&quot; either - in the strongest sense of the words. But they <br/>
might SAY that --- &quot;Mom - please make me practice my piano everyday!!&quot;   I&#39;d <br/>
take it like how the other Pam described waking Britt up in the morning --- <br/>
more as give me a strong nudge and make sure I&#39;m really paying attention and <br/>
that if I refuse that I really mean it. If a kid asked me, &quot;Please make <br/>
me.....&quot; -- I&#39;d take it as them asking me to REALLY help them make it happen. <br/>
Clearly it is something they want.<br/>
