<div id="ygrps-yiv-138395398">My 10 year old son, Xander,  asked me why some people say that TV rots your brain. He was thinking literally of &#39;rot&#39; and knew that wasn&#39;t true.  I didn&#39;t know the origin of the saying  so I asked if I could post the question here on Always Learning and then I googled it and found this study:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dcmp.org/caai/nadh174.pdf">http://www.dcmp.org/caai/nadh174.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
We only read the abstract and a bit of the intro. The study found no evidence of negative effect from television viewing and an actual increase test scores.  <br/>
<br/>
But we are still wondering where the idea that TV will rot a persons brain out originated.  Any thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
TV is one stop on a long trail of &quot;will rot your brain&quot; demons.  <br/>
<br/>
I might leave some out, but first it was secular books.<br/>
Then paperbacks.<br/>
Then comic books.<br/>
TV<br/>
Video games<br/>
<br/>
Parallel to that, <br/>
swing music<br/>
rock and roll<br/>
hip hop<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a tradition of adults demonizing kids&#39; interests.  It&#39;s part of trying to control them through shame, I think.<br/>

Also, I wonder if ideas like &quot;an idle brain is the devil&#39;s workshop&quot; come into play for some folks.  If people think of TV watching as passive, it&#39;d seem to follow that there would be all sorts of opportunity for the devil to be up to mischief while a child is watching the screen.  Well, if you believe that sort of thing of course ;-)</div>

<br/>
Definitely all the puritan subtexts of our unconscious.   <br/>
There&#39;s a phrase used in Baptist sermons warning people to be vigilant for the second coming of Christ.  They say &quot;Will Jesus find us watching?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has long amused me to picture a bumper sticker that says &quot;Will Jesus find us watching?  PBS.&quot;   Or some advertisement for public television.<br/>
<br/>
But certainly, the idea that we should be ready to look busy when Jesus comes is likely in the top ten of priorities in some families, consciously and overtly.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I was told tales of the benefits or horrors of children (just children, never adults) and eating (or not eating) bread crusts, drinking coffee, eating chocolate, or biting  fingernails.  Those things were told as truths.  Bad things would happen (or good, in the case of doing what the parents wanted you to do with those things).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882748177">I have a somewhat funny story to share here.  <br/>
<br/>
Friends of ours practice a more traditional way of living.  Their children go to school, and tv time is somewhat limited.  One day the mom said to her son that he shouldn&#39;t be watching so much tv because his brain would shrink.  The next day, the boy was outside with us and he told his mom he had a headache.  When his mom expressed concern, he stated that he thought his brain was growing too big for his head, so he better get inside and watch some tv to shrink it.  <br/>
<br/>
He really didn&#39;t have a headache.  She looked at me and asked me what to do in an exasperated kind of way.  I said she should go in and watch some tv with him.  It sounded like there was something he really wanted to see.  I laughed, and said I thought her son was great.  Honestly, I thought it was an inspired attempt to get his needs met and the transparency of it made mom think, I think.  It did me :)</div>

for a long time. I recall that one of the great ancient philosophers  <br/>
disdained books because then people wouldn&#39;t need to memorize anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to know if Roald Dahl was the first to connect rotting brains and  <br/>
TV though he is certainly popular enough for a lot of people to have  <br/>
read him.<br/>
<br/>
There was a good discussion of Roald Dahl and TV and his rather  <br/>
horrific upbringing.<br/>

In 1964, TV was about ten years old.  It wasn&#39;t in color yet, really. <br/>

I&#39;m going to respond to some of that separately, but as to the anti-TV links, here are many others.   They&#39;re as ugly and negative as the worst things I&#39;ve ever seen on TV, but they have no redeeming value outside their dark negative fearmongering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406538597">-=- I have read that the brain is almost sleeping when watching TV but just awake enough to allow you to remember-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe everything you read?<br/>
Does that seem true to you, from your own experience with TV?<br/>
Have you watched your children watch movies or videos?  Do their brains seem to be almost sleeping?<br/>
Have you seen them listen to storytellers, or to music, or to you telling them something?  Did they seem attentive, or almost sleeping?  Did it depend on how interesting the story was?<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you were to watch a documentary it is engaged.-=-<br/>
<br/>
So documentaries are &quot;engaging&quot; and wake a person up, but a comedy or drama or an instructional video put their brains to sleep?<br/>
&quot;If you were to watch a documentary&quot; is an odd way to phrase that.  Have you ever watched documentaries?<br/>
I have.  It&#39;s not an &quot;if.&quot;  Some are wonderful.  Some (mostly depending on me and my interest) are as boring as a bad day in a classroom.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It is a major tool to build a consumer society(repetition) and while there are bits of good, documentaries etc, I don´t think it is enough.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough what for what?<br/>
How old are your children, and how long have you been unschooling?  Those questions are important to gauging how much thought you might have put into how learning happens, and about the value of choices and openness to input.<br/>
<br/>
If you wrote a book about the evils of TV, would you hope people would buy it?  Would that be a tool in the creation of a consumer society?   Is repetition what builds a consumer society?  Who is building this consumer society?  Is there a governing body?  Who&#39;s in charge of that?   You bought a computer.  Is that because the consumer society made you do that, or did you actually want a computer?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve owned a Mac of one sort or another since 1989 when I got a IIsi.  I LOVED that computer.  It had sound, and music.  I had a keyboard, and a piano program called Miracle Piano that was wonderful.  I wish it would work on other machines (and if it&#39;s out there again, someone please let me know, because I loved it).  I didn&#39;t buy a Mac because of advertising. I bought it because I had worked with one doing word processing, and when my husband offered to buy me a new computer (I had a Kaypro II before that, with a daisy wheel printer), he asked whether I&#39;d rather have a Mac or PC.  He recommended a Mac, and I had liked the Mac 2 I had used, so....      Am I a cog in the machinery of the computer society?<br/>
<br/>
But back to TV.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I know, I am a product of the 70&#347; TV gen but I hate that I still have in my head ¨Plop, Plop, Fizz,Fizz....¨ and I want to remember the last books I read!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching TV since the 1950&#39;s.  I saw the first alkaseltzer commercial, and I&#39;ve known that song for over 50 years.  So?  I still remember a Channel 11 commercial &quot;Hey bud--whatcha lookin&#39; at?&quot;  &quot;Channel 11.  GOOD lookin&#39;.&quot;  I remember hundreds of songs and jokes and kids&#39; rhymes for games and jumprope and clapping that I learned from people, not from TV.  I have a memory for tunes, and if something comes with a song, I can remember it.  That&#39;s an ancient tool for putting memories in people, from psalms and proverbs to epic poems, ballads and sagas.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a few people who can remember narrative without repetition, rhyme, alliteration, rhythm or music, but not many.  So don&#39;t blame TV or Alka-Seltzer if you can&#39;t remember the last books you read.  It has nothing to do with it.  It&#39;s not like your brain&#39;s all full up.  There&#39;s plenty of room to make more connections.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My kids are amazed that the day is gone when movies are on, almost sad. But the draw to the screen is strong.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The screen&quot;?  It draws you even when there&#39;s nobody talking or singing or dancing?  I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
The day isn&#39;t gone when movies are on.  In each moment, people make a choice.  I doubt you have forced your children to watch a movie.  They had a choice.  I&#39;m suspecting that your prejudice against &quot;screens&quot; is so strong that you&#39;ve prompted them to feel bad (almost sad) or amazed that &quot;the day is gone.&quot;  But if you did that, you injected negativity into a situation that didn&#39;t need to be so.  <br/>
<br/>
Choose joy.  Choose happiness.  Choose to be with your children, and to see with your children.<br/>

<br/>
What do you observe of unschooled children? What do you know of  <br/>
personal experience?<br/>
<br/>
I remember huge, vast amounts from shows on TV, documentaries and  <br/>
fiction, commercials and talk shows. Images, facts, story lines. I  <br/>
know lots and lots about the 20&#39;s to 50&#39;s before I was born beginning  <br/>
with jokes in Bugs Bunny cartoons that were reinforced by watching  <br/>
movies from that era, watching documentaries.<br/>
<br/>
If someone takes their nose out of books about other people&#39;s  <br/>
(supposed) observations and actually looks objectively at what&#39;s going  <br/>
on, the statements about TV don&#39;t connect with reality! Book worship  <br/>
seems to create more thoughtlessness than TV.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is a major tool to build a consumer society(repetition)<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enough for what?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about what parents like. It&#39;s about helping kids  <br/>
explore what *they* like. On this list parents can find a lot of help  <br/>
letting go of their biases so they can either get out of the way or  <br/>
embrace something their kids enjoy to help their kids explore.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; and I want to remember the last books I read!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you hate that? It&#39;s cute. It&#39;s part of why you remember it.  <br/>
Another part is that it was repeated often.<br/>
<br/>
As Sandra says, try not to hate. You can have that jingle in your head  <br/>
with pleasant feelings or with negative feelings. You get to choose.<br/>
<br/>
When kids enjoy something, they read it or watch it again. If you want  <br/>
to remember the book you read, read it again. And again. Get it on  <br/>
audio to engage another sense. If it&#39;s also a movie, watch the movie  <br/>
version to add another sense in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But the draw to the screen is strong.<br/>

The stories and information happen to be available on screens.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Like Timothy Leary said ¨Control your eyes, control your reality.¨<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect Timothy Leary lost more brain cells to drugs than anyone has  <br/>
to TV!<br/>
<br/>
He also popularized &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out.&quot; He was a big  <br/>
advocate of LSD as a beneficial drug.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825193696">I have six kids, we have educated at home since birth.They are  4-15 yrs.. Un schooling is in the process more now that ever before. At points thru the years we have read and used some points for un schooling.<br/>
Thanks for the thoughts.<br/>
We have been farmer/country people ,complete with animals , until the last year when we have moved to a small city. This is why the ¨day gone¨<br/>
comment. For us things happened during the daylight. Now, not always.The day light is time in our garden, canoeing and our bees. <br/>
<br/>
No , I read everything then think for myself. I do feel that ,like Homer Simpson, somethings are pushed out of my full head. When I read here I think&quot;I knew that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When they watch, a show , they sometimes do not eat,do not see things around them. When they are reading they do these things. When they listen to stories or music they also can do these things. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree not all documentaries are interesting . The type or method of engaging the watcher is different, so it is suggested.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to stop here because as you said <br/>
¨Choose joy. Choose happiness. Choose to be with your children, and to see with your children.¨<br/>
I do and I will. Dr. Who is on the menu today.</div>

<br/>
-=-He also popularized &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out.&quot; He was a big <br/>
advocate of LSD as a beneficial drug.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  <br/>
<br/>
But to the original poster, in what context was that Timothy Leary quote?  Was he talking about TV?   Wouldn&#39;t closing your eyes control your reality, then, too?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a zen story about a master who&#39;s sitting in a house near the ocean, and they&#39;re looking out the window.  The teacher says &quot;Make that boat disappear.&quot;  The student thinks a bit, and then reaches over and slides the screen to cover the window.    The teacher says, &quot;Ah, but you had to use your hand,&quot; and closed his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The boat didn&#39;t really disappear, though. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If the discussion at Always Learning is too irritating and someone wants to make it disappear, they can click the little box in the upper corner that will make this writing &quot;disappear,&quot; or they can leave the list, or look away or close their eyes.  But we&#39;ll still be discussing what we have observed in our own families, and it won&#39;t match much of the &quot;research&quot; done by education-degree candidates to support school.<br/>
<br/>
If one&#39;s goal is to make school the most interesting thing on a child&#39;s horizon, then by all means--turn off the TV, don&#39;t give them any great picture books, avoid popular music, and close all the windows.   If one&#39;s goal is to make learning a constant condition of a child&#39;s life, then turn ON the TV, give them all the books and magazines and music they want, open the windows, explore!  Explore when you&#39;re out of the house, and explore when you&#39;re in the house.<br/>
<br/>
So what was Timothy Leary on about then, with &quot;control your eyes&quot;?   <br/>
He wasn&#39;t a very nice man, by the way.   If he was an unschooling dad who had been a responsible, good father, I&#39;d be more inclined to want to know what he thought about how to create an environment in which children could learn in peace and joy.<br/>

<br/>
When they&#39;re listening to a story, if they get up and eat, that means they weren&#39;t very interested and they&#39;re hoping the storyteller will get it over with. :-)<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m reading an e-mail, sometimes I don&#39;t hear something someone tells me.  They need to get my attention first.  Sometimes I assume Holly was taking to Keith or Marty, if the e-mail is really good (like something from Joyce, or Deb Lewis, or Schuyler, or Pam Sorooshian).   That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m barely awake.  It means I&#39;m fully engaged.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when one of my kids is playing a video game, he forgets to eat.   Eating is pretty important.  I would put food near them.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter">http://sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter</a><br/>
Maybe having food near them while they&#39;re watching Dr. Who will help.<br/>
<br/>
Often I can become so engrossed in doing something that I forget to eat.  Yesterday I had breakfast at 2:20.  I had gotten up and decided to work on the mosaic tile I&#39;m doing in a shower, and just kept doing one more thing, one more thing, and had no idea how much time was passing.  I hadn&#39;t even had tea in the morning, because I wanted to work on the tile.  <br/>
<br/>
I had choices.   Something was more interesting to me than food, for hours.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done that with sewing, and yardwork, and talking to friends, and playing cards, too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not good to wish for activities that are so shallow or irritating that distractions are welcome.<br/>

<br/>
I wonder what context this was said it?  It&#39;s kind of a silly quote.  My reality <br/>
is made up of so much more than just my eyes.  Right now, I&#39;m smelling food <br/>
cooking and feeling warm sunshine and talking with people.  My reality at this <br/>
moment encompasses all of my senses.<br/>
<br/>
***My kids are amazed that the day is gone when movies are on, almost sad. But <br/>

<br/>
This is not my reality at all.  The days that go by in which my kids watch <br/>
movies all day are rare, but never sad.  They are usually down days that involve <br/>
more snuggling.  The draw of the &quot;screen&quot; isn&#39;t strong, it&#39;s there, just like <br/>
all the other options.  Going and doing stuff is almost always preferable to <br/>
watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, several of our house members watched TV together and we laughed and <br/>
laughed and had a marvelous time, while snuggled up all in our places of sleep. <br/>
 It was calm and peaceful and pleasant.  We watched several hours of TV and then <br/>
turned it off when nobody could keep their eyes open.  There was zero sadness <br/>
involved.  The draw was to fall asleep and be entertained while in that process.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are your kids sad because you told them other things were more  <br/>
important than movies and that they missed those other things by  <br/>
watching?<br/>
<br/>
Joyce gave you a couple of links to her excellent unschooling pages  <br/>
about TV. Here&#39;s another from Sandra&#39;s site with many stories and  <br/>
studies to read:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
<br/>
TV (movies, series, cartoons) are part of our days full of learning.  <br/>
My daughter&#39;s passions (playing Pokemon DS games, cosplaying as  <br/>
Pokemon characters, sculpting characters in clay, drawing characters  <br/>
on paper and on the computer) come originally from the Pokemon 2000  <br/>
movie. If I&#39;d shamed her for wanting to see it or tried to get her to  <br/>
do something else instead of watching it, she wouldn&#39;t be as happy as  <br/>
she is now: reveling in her connections with other Pokemon fans,   <br/>
honing her drawing skills, working through difficulties in games,  <br/>
learning Japanese, being a part of a community of artists online.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t particularly intend for those things to happen. But her world  <br/>
was big. It wasn&#39;t restrictive. She knows I support her interests.  <br/>
That&#39;s huge.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Like Timothy Leary said ¨Control your eyes, control your reality.¨<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not fond of quotations or messages about control. They&#39;re often  <br/>
used to control *other* people, not oneself ie. &quot;Timothy Leary says  <br/>
control is good, so I&#39;ll control my kids&#39; eyes.&quot; Frankly, I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
follow much of Leary&#39;s advice. He wasn&#39;t a happy guy and his family  <br/>
wasn&#39;t especially happy either.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The links are just some of what is out there.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One can pretty much find links to support any negative stance about  <br/>
anything! It&#39;s a mindset.<br/>
<br/>
Read Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s links about positive outcomes from TV  <br/>
watching. And remember that what unschoolers really talk about is not  <br/>
the TV or the computer or books or gardens, specifically. We talk  <br/>
about attitude toward learning and relationships. That&#39;s what&#39;s  <br/>
important.<br/>

Are you saying your kids did not have a choice to stop watching the movie/show/TV?<br/>
My kids have a choice. Because their TV is unlimited and they even have a DVR that records their favorite shows they do not feel they &quot;have to&quot;sit and watch something.<br/>
They can watch later. at night , whenever. We too live in a farm and my kids love to go help dad. They can turn the TV off anytime and do. They can leave a favorite show to go with dad feed the calves and they know they can watch it another time. I have to say that of all the recorded shows they have on their DVR they maybe watch 20% if that much.<br/>
If your kids chose to wathc something and they feel bad about it  that sounds that it can be more damaging than just enjoying their choice. If the choice was made base on feeling  lack of option than they should have more options about TV not less.<br/>

No they were not. People here have read all those kind of ideas about TV roting  people&#39;s brains. People here have gone further and they have observed and evaluated and the conclusion many came up (cannot say everyone or most) is that TV does not rot a brain or my family is a buch of zombies in front of the screen with shrinked brains!<br/>

Ah.  Slogans.  I suppose you have said that to your children, things about being the explorers rather than watching the explorers.

A knife is a tool that can cut a person and land them in the emergency room if <br/>

the ER that I know of.  I&#39;ve heard people call TV a tool and if that&#39;s the case <br/>

cutting things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
Really think about that for a minute. How does the brain know the difference between a documentary and a sitcom? Does it really make sense that falling asleep watching a documentary is more engaging than laughing at the jokes in a sitcom or marvelling at the literary and cultural references in a cartoon? Not that all documentaries are dull enough to sleep through - but those that Aren&#39;t pull elements of structure and presentation from other kinds of television and movies. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure someone could design an experiment that would prove that tv is stultifying. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to select tired old reruns or low-grade educational programming and tape electrodes to the heads of college students only interested in the $25 they&#39;d get for sitting through the experiement, daydreaming. Given the same setup, you could prove that all great literature causes the brain to go into sleep mode.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve only ever watched movies or shows to relax, I bet that data would seem convincing, but people watch tv for reasons other than that. People regularly use television programs - fictional programs - for informational purposes. It&#39;s not *just* that they&#39;re remembering the programs wholesale, people pull out facts and information (real or not) that interest them. That&#39;s learning. People do the same thing when they read books or websites or newspapers. Learning is not less-than if you disapprove of the medium. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I want to remember the last books I read!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you tried audio books? Watching a dramatization of the book? If you remember song lyrics better than print, why confine yourself to print? Why put up a wall between yourself and the way you learn best?<br/>
<br/>
If you went to school or were homeschooled, you were told many times that reading books is important. You&#39;ve been told that reading books is better, more significant than watching tv. You&#39;ve been told, over and over until you believed it, that reading books stimulates the imagination. Those messages lurk in the back of your mind - part of the &quot;school in your head&quot;. It&#39;s valuable to question those messages even if you adore books because your children aren&#39;t you. They may find other formats, other media, work better for them as tools to explore the world. <br/>

<br/>
It helps to notice when shows change (or commercials if you&#39;re watching broadcast) and use those moments to get snacks. We watch Dr Who on netflix as a family and use the transition from one episode to another to get up and move a bit, go pee, get food. If you&#39;re watching Dr. Who, that&#39;s a good show to ask yourself if it really makes sense for the brain to go into some kind of sleep or zombie mode.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll remind Mo to eat and pee when screens are loading, playing a video game. I bring her food, but if the game is intense it helps if I remind her to eat - its hard to eat and play a game at the same time. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents who have issues with tv will make themselves scarce when the kids want to watch - that&#39;s something to watch out for. Don&#39;t &quot;just&quot; leave the kids with the tv, spend some time watching with them, seeing what lights them up. It gives you another chance to spend time with them, to connect with them over their interests and joys, and that&#39;s infinitely valuable. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everything in life can be learned from, commercials included.<br/>
<br/>
But influential how?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you mean commercials will make people want what they see?<br/>
<br/>
Commercials are a source of information. They let people know what&#39;s  <br/>
out there. They can suggest the product is really great. But once it&#39;s  <br/>
in the home, people make a decision whether to buy it again.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are the same. If they&#39;re given the opportunity to make decisions,  <br/>
try things out, decide from there, they learn more about themselves  <br/>
and about the world.<br/>
<br/>
If Mom tells them the commercials are powerful and they need to  <br/>
beware, or worse, tells them they aren&#39;t capable of deciding from what  <br/>
they try and Mom needs to do it for them, they can become less sure of  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has seen 1000s of commercials. She&#39;s rarely wanted  <br/>
anything she&#39;s seen on TV. Other kids are different. But what  <br/>
unschoolers actually experience is that when the kids are trusted to  <br/>
be competent and have the opportunity to try things out, they learn  <br/>
discrimination.  They learn from experience, by drawing their own  <br/>
conclusions, that what they see on commercials is to be treated with  <br/>
skepticism. (They&#39;ll learn this from what Mom buys too.)<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out that companies are trying to  <br/>
figure out ways to convince you their product is worth your money!  <br/>
Kids *want* to be competent in the world. They want to be smarter than  <br/>
companies. They&#39;re driven to figure out how to get what they want from  <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The perceived ´reality´ in programs can shade how we view our reality.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like you&#39;re repeating what you&#39;ve read and heard others say.<br/>
<br/>
What people read, what we hear from others, what we see in real life  <br/>
and on TV, what we figure out, adds to our vision of how the world  <br/>
works. That&#39;s how we learn. It will help you see more clearly if you  <br/>
don&#39;t put TV in a special category and don&#39;t call it shading.  <br/>
Everything contributes to how we believe the world works.<br/>
<br/>
Not everything we read, hear, see will be true. Not even in reality!  <br/>
But we&#39;re constantly checking and testing what we know against  <br/>
anything new that comes in.<br/>
<br/>
I recently watched an old movie with Carl and Kathryn: The Vikings  <br/>
with Kirk Douglas. I would say most of my knowledge of early western  <br/>
European history comes from movies and novels (many of which were  <br/>
bodice busters!). But it was surprisingly easy to pick up on what felt  <br/>
off for the time period. When I read through the trivia and so forth  <br/>
at IMDb and articles on Wikipedia, I had pretty much spotted what was  <br/>
accurate and what wasn&#39;t.  I had *even* been able to pick out that the  <br/>
supposedly Saxon castle they went to was French. (Though I was wrong  <br/>
about how old the castle was.)  (They had actually done a lot of  <br/>
research on the Viking part of the story, more than usual for late 50s  <br/>
movies (when spectacle was more important than truth).)<br/>
<br/>
How is that possible? How could I have absorbed so much that&#39;s wrong  <br/>
and yet built up a fairly accurate picture? How could I have done it  <br/>
from TV when I was supposedly barely awake? Thought! Questioning! Yes,  <br/>
from what I was picking up from TV. :-) That&#39;s because when creators  <br/>
of fiction use what&#39;s accurate, it matches something else you&#39;ve  <br/>
picked up and reinforces it as being more and more and more likely  <br/>
true. When creators make stuff up, it doesn&#39;t match so you&#39;re more  <br/>
likely to question it.<br/>
<br/>
*That&#39;s* how we naturally  learn. We don&#39;t need to be fed the right  <br/>
information. We turn over what comes in and think about it, create  <br/>
theories, test it against what else we know and against reality, and  <br/>
let it sit sometimes and when something stirs it up again, think about  <br/>
it some more to see how it meshes with what else we know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  You see things that you may not realize.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like what specifically? What have you actually observed in your own  <br/>
kids? Is it a problem? Is it a big problem? How specifically? How is  <br/>
what they take in from TV without paying attention different from what  <br/>
they take in from other areas of their lives without paying attention?<br/>
<br/>
These statements sound true and scary and that&#39;s why people repeat  <br/>
them. But what&#39;s the reality with your kids when they have choice and  <br/>
support in meeting their needs? What actually happens? And is it  <br/>
really a problem?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The kids were sad the day(light) hours had past. This was their  <br/>
&gt; option and they realized only later that it was maybe not the choice  <br/>
&gt; they really wanted. Hindsight. Life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And they may very likely make that choice to watch TV all day again.  <br/>
And may be disappointed again. It&#39;s how humans figure out themselves  <br/>
and the world. And especially with kids, their needs and limits are  <br/>
changing day by day. Something they liked last week they may not like  <br/>
this week. Something they couldn&#39;t do last month, maybe they can do  <br/>
fine now. They need to keep testing to find out who they are :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We watch movies,plays and shows ,Bewitched to Dirt!,but our life has  <br/>
&gt; always been more about being the explorers than watching the  <br/>
&gt; explorers.Now we are trying more yes, more choices and so the  <br/>
&gt; options .<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If TV was more limited in the past -- and if TV is something they  <br/>
like! -- it&#39;s natural that they&#39;d want to explore it a huge amount.  <br/>
It&#39;s different nearly every day! Help them find ways to do what they  <br/>
want. Don&#39;t assume! Don&#39;t assume they want to not watch TV during the  <br/>
day even if they complain when night comes. Dig a bit to get more  <br/>
specific answers about what they like and don&#39;t like. Find out what  <br/>
they want, and help them figure out how to make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that it (TV)is a tool that like a knife , must be used  <br/>
&gt; carefully.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like what? Like how? My daughter managed to watch loads of TV --  <br/>
mostly during the preteen years -- and never cut herself! Nor did she  <br/>
turn into a consumer junkie. Nor did she arrive at 19 with a warped  <br/>
view of the world that doesn&#39;t match reality.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots of scary words out there about TV, but what&#39;s the reality  <br/>
with unschooled kids?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Leary not so nice.<br/>
&gt; If I had to like everyone that I have learned from,or read I  <br/>
&gt; probably would have a very short list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But what did you learn from him? You quoted him but you haven&#39;t  <br/>
explained what it meant. It was the words of an authority (on LSD ;-)  <br/>
used to shore up what you believe. But how does it match what you  <br/>
observe in your unschooling kids?<br/>

<br/>
I know Kathryn felt at the mercy of the programmers of what episodes  <br/>
they might put on. With the DVR she never had to worry about missing a  <br/>
new episode or a favorite one. The amount of TV she watched went down  <br/>
because she was more in control of what and when.<br/>

Didn&#39;t you say you&#39;re watching on the computer, though? Why are commercials even an issue? They don&#39;t pertain to your family.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help to discuss theoretical &quot;what ifs&quot; with unschooling because everything is situational. What are Your kids experiencing, not children-as-a-demographic but the real lives of real people. <br/>
<br/>
If y&#39;all have the chance to watch commercials, how do your kids respond? Are they curious and want to talk about what they see? Plenty to talk about with most commercials... don&#39;t make it a lecture, though, that&#39;s a good way to get them to tune you out. If they want to buy, buy something. Really, the best way to learn about truth in advertising is to explore the reality of it a little. Be kind - don&#39;t set them up to be disappointed when you can point out things like &quot;some parts sold separately&quot; and &quot;does not include pony&quot; - but let them become discriminating in the most direct way possible. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The perceived ´reality´ in programs can shade how we view our reality. You see things that you may not realize.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*******************<br/>
<br/>
Do your kids think Daleks are real? Do they think sea sponges work in fast food restaurants? I bet their reality is pretty intact. Do you talk about shows and movies at all? I don&#39;t mean quiz them about what&#39;s real and what&#39;s imaginary, I mean talk like you would with a buddy. Connect with them and get a sense of what they know and think, what they wish and imagine. That will go further toward calming your fears about their brains than advice from strangers over a screen ;) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are commercials at the beginning of many YouTube videos.<br/>
<br/>
There are also commercial breaks on TV shows on Hulu. Very short  <br/>
breaks, often 30 seconds. They&#39;re too short to get up and do something  <br/>
and you can&#39;t fast forward! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not grousing. Commercials are what makes it all free! Though  <br/>
commercials at the beginning of music videos seem a bit overkill since  <br/>
the videos themselves are like ads for the groups.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-896650169">I have this by e-mail with a request to post it without the name.  There&#39;s a note from me below.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
****our life has always been more about being the explorers than watching the explorers****<br/>
 <br/>
When I was growing up, I always preferred reading about the explorers over being one of the explorers.  I missed many a meal, bedtime, sunny day, or outing � lost in a book.  I read at home � at the beach � in the woods in a tree � most everywhere I went, I read.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was 13, my stepfather decided that he was tired of watching me waste my life away (his words) in front of, yep you guessed it � not a TV screen - but my books.  He banned me from reading anywhere but in school.  Said if he caught me reading, there�d be serious consequences.  Got rid of all of my books and my library card. <br/>
 <br/>
To him, books were keeping me from �experiencing life� and were making me dream big dreams and want big things � and to him that was bad.  Books were evil things in his world � the things that were preventing me from being �well rounded� � the things that were going to keep me from having a productive life.  All things he said.<br/>
 <br/>
When I tell people I was banned from reading, they are invariably shocked.  Horrified even.  But BOOKS are so wonderful, they say.  Who could stop someone from reading BOOKS.<br/>
 <br/>
And the things is � all the arguments he made about books and how terrible they are � it�s the same thing people say about TV, computers, video games. <br/>
 <br/>
Books didn�t keep me from life.  They were part of my life.  They taught me about life.  They are part of what made me who I am today.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, my experience being banned from reading also is part of what made me who I am today.  I would never take something away from my child that he enjoyed.  I would never try to make him feel guilty for �wasting away� his days, when in fact he�s spending his days being happy and that�s all any of us I think can ask � that we get to spend the days we have alive being happy.<br/>
 <br/>
... if it�s appropriate to share, I would appreciate if it could be shared anonymously ...<br/>
 If it�s not appropriate to share, I understand.  I just thought you might enjoy hearing the perspective of someone who�s been on the other side of some of the things that are in current discussion, and in whose life it wasn�t the Screen that so many people seem to fear that was the �bad guy� � it was print, which so many people seem to revere.  Two sides to every coin, indeed there are :-)<br/>
_____________________________________<br/>
end of anonymous quote, beginning of Sandra comment:<br/>
_____________________________________<br/>
<br/>
My mom said to me several times in the same words &quot;Get your nose out of that book and go outside and play.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t said in a kind or loving way.  It was clearly conveying that books were stupid, and I was stupid, and she didn&#39;t want me to be in the house when she could have the house to herself.    I bet if anyone had questioned her about it, though, she would have found some motherly justification about the health benefits of play and sunshine.   She never mentioned that in way of explanation to me, though.  Sometimes it was behind my back, but loud enough for me to hear, &quot;Sandra&#39;s in there with her nose in a book&quot; (witheringly spoken).<br/>
<br/>
I liked books more than I liked my mom.  I liked school more than I liked my mom.   She wasn&#39;t very nice.<br/>

<br/>
But yes, if it weren&#39;t for commercials, broadcast TV wouldn&#39;t be free.  (The justification for commercials on cable TV is another matter; at first, in the 1970&#39;s, people were told paying for cable would cut down on commercials.)<br/>
