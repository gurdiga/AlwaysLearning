&lt;&lt; I&#39;m so grateful for that guitar teacher, Erin didn&#39;t even worry about the <br/>
piano experience because she was so musically inspired. She stood up for <br/>
herself too, and politely told the piano teacher that it wasn&#39;t working out <br/>
for her. She didn&#39;t ask me to sort it out for her.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great story Kerrin!<br/>
Your dd obviously is better off self teaching than with a lame teacher like <br/>
that. Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor has a guitar teacher much like the one you described.<br/>
The first place we called told us he couldn&#39;t play the music he liked until <br/>
he had &quot;the basics&quot; down. We didn&#39;t sign up.<br/>
The guy he is with teaches him the songs Trevor wants to learn and he&#39;s <br/>
getting the basics through doing what he loves. He practices every day <br/>
without me ever saying a thing. He loves it.<br/>
Funny thing is, the first guitar place we called made snooty remarks about <br/>
the place we ended up at. And Jerry (his teacher) has toured with many <br/>
notable musicians, Shania Twain among them!!! Guess they&#39;re a bit intimidated <br/>
by a teacher that lets the kids learn what they want and is obviously a <br/>
really great player himself.  sheesh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952874795">It&#39;s taken me a while to respond to this post; I had to stop screaming at<br/>
the computer.  I realize it&#39;s not my computer&#39;s fault about the piano<br/>
teacher, but it took it well.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t see how this kind of music teacher is going to pass on any love of<br/>
&gt; music to her students.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d have to agree with that. I always tell people that I&#39;m not teaching the<br/>
next generation of violin virtuosos, I&#39;m teaching the next generation of<br/>
music lovers, concert goers, and parents who share the joy of music-making.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think she <br/>
&gt; is so used to students who are forced to be there, who are not enjoying the<br/>
&gt; music that she has just become jaded.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Also discouraged.  It&#39;s very tiring to teach kids who don&#39;t want to be<br/>
there.  I tend to just drop those sort of kids after while, but it&#39;s not my<br/>
family&#39;s sole livelihood.  I don&#39;t have to teach to live.  Not everyone has<br/>
that option, so they continue to deal with the problems of students whose<br/>
parents pay the bills and don&#39;t ask why their child isn&#39;t getting any<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She charges an inflated price and<br/>
&gt; assumes that students won&#39;t practice and that she&#39;s going to have trouble<br/>
&gt; getting her money.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know her situation, but I charge what the market will bear.  I have<br/>
a lot of experience and think I&#39;m worth a decent amount.  You can get<br/>
cheaper lessons from a college student perhaps, but you miss out on all that<br/>
I&#39;ve learned in the last 16 years.  I do make exceptions, but you have to<br/>
ask.  <br/>
<br/>
And the brutal, sad truth is that yes, students cancel at the last minute<br/>
all the time and it&#39;s hard to collect the money for those lessons.  I&#39;m<br/>
paying a babysitter, room rent sometimes, and have set aside a time, so I<br/>
charge for missed lessons, too.  But I do try hard to be flexible about<br/>
them.  That&#39;s not to defend her being inappropriate, which I think she was<br/>
in many ways, but wanting to be paid for missed lessons is like making an<br/>
appointment with your plummer and then not being home.  He still had to<br/>
drive out there, and reserved that time which could have been used for other<br/>
people who wanted him, so he expects to be paid anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that your daughter continues to enjoy her really cool guitar teacher,<br/>
and that she eventually finds a piano teacher that&#39;s a lot easier to deal<br/>
with!  And finally, congratulations to your daughter for standing up for her<br/>
rights!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269325982">Holly and Marty are upstairs listening to the whole of Purple Rain after I <br/>
showed them two or three bits to illustrate things we&#39;d been discussing.  We <br/>
had connections to Cyndi Lauper, to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, to <br/>
Minneapolis, to the 80&#39;s in general, and to voices.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said Prince has a funny voice.  I hadn&#39;t thought so, and asked &quot;like <br/>
what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not strong, funny quality.  She couldn&#39;t describe it.<br/>
<br/>
I said I thought he was a better guitarist and songwriter than singer, but <br/>
that as he was a really great performer, the quality of his voice wasn&#39;t the <br/>
main feature.  She understood that.  <br/>
<br/>
We talked about drums and bass some, about creating a mood--jittery, or <br/>
unbalanced, or sexy.<br/>
That album has great and intentional examples of all those.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly asked if the story was true, of the movie.  She hasn&#39;t seen it, but I <br/>
told her his dad in the movie is violent and then attempts suicide and that&#39;s <br/>
why the title song is sad.   I told her I didn&#39;t think it was biographical, <br/>
totally.  Just kind vaguely similar, maybe.  That his dad was a musician, and <br/>
the dad in the movie had written lots of music but never became a successful <br/>
musician.  (Sometime I&#39;ll check and let her know.)<br/>
<br/>
And then she asked if it was a true story that a guy was able to write music <br/>
totally down without using a piano or instrument.   I stopped and ran through <br/>
stories she might be thinking of.  I said lots of people can learn to do <br/>
that, once they&#39;re experienced at writing it down.  I told her about <br/>
Beethoven writing orchestral stuff after he was deaf.  She was impressed.  <br/>
But I told her lots of people can write music down. <br/>
<br/>
Before that we had been listening to Donovan, because Holly was singing <br/>
&quot;First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is&quot; when <br/>
heavy clouds were covering the Sandias, then they would peek through, then <br/>
more clouds.  She asked who did that song and asked if it was Herman&#39;s <br/>
Hermits.  <br/>
<br/>
I said no, Donovan, the same guy I had mentioned the day before...<br/>
<br/>
And THAT story had been told in reference to how much input a person can <br/>
handle at once--different people different amounts and different kinds.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to describe and impossible to guarantee how Cyndi Lauper and Silent <br/>
Bob can lead to a discussion of Beethoven, but it happened here today.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly wanted me to tell her the story of Hamlet.  I gave her a 20 <br/>
minute version and had it all in order (surprised myself) except I got a <br/>
little confused about when Claudius<br/>
is in the chapel and Hamlet decides it&#39;s not a good time to kill him.  So <br/>
that was &#39;and at some point,&#39; but the rest I think I got in one shot!<br/>
<br/>
When I was eleven, I don&#39;t think I had even heard of Hamlet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty happy with our situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614925433">Hi Ren. You reminded me of something else Erin&#39;s piano teacher said: She had made a point of finding out about Erin&#39;s first piano teacher. She told us that he was not a registered teacher (she is, of course) and made it clear that she didn&#39;t think much of him, or the music he had taught Erin (she had brought the book he worked in with her). Absolutely ludicrous IMO when he was the one who inspired her in the first place, and helped her reach a stage that teacher no.2 considered to be impossible! He is still mourned by the community 3 years after retirement!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251993335">Hi Brenda.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a teachers view. I do agree that it is reasonable to charge for missed lessons, when the student simply doesn&#39;t turn up. I would expect some flexibilty (like you mentioned) in the case of a flood making impossible for us to get there. We did ring, and she knew we couldn&#39;t get there. She did actually offer a make-up lesson, but she was such an inappropriate teacher for Erin that she didn&#39;t want another lesson. An important point, I think, in considering this, is that she did not keep up her end of the agreement, which was to treat Erin as an adult student and to move at her pace. If she had, Erin would probably still be with her and have had the make-up lesson, there wouldn&#39;t be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you&#39;re saying about pricing. I have good skills and provide really good service so I charge accordingly too. When I said the piano teachers prices were inflated, she is charging more than any other teachers, and yet she is not IMO providing a good service. She was simply following a beginners book with Erin, with no individual tuition.<br/>
<br/>
There are other piano teachers available. who seem to be much more enthusiastic. The problem is they&#39;re all booked out!<br/>

because she&#39;s soooo talented (I hate that kind of pushy parent) but because<br/>
she really, really is soooo interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824553140">The shop where the guitar lessons are is so hard case. It&#39;s called music mayhem and it&#39;s full of guitars, many of them old and funky. The guy who helps you when you come in looks like an old rocker who used a lot of drugs in his youth &lt;bg&gt; He&#39;s vague and funny. He&#39;s a musician, but he can only play left handed guitars, so I haven&#39;t heard him play. There&#39;s another, equally unusual guy, with very strange hair who demonstrates the guitars. He&#39;s a great muso. It&#39;s a really pleasant place to visit. I haven&#39;t met the one who teaches Erin. I will ask if they know a good pianist though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  Back years ago, I quit teaching for a year or so because I was so<br/>
burned out.  I figured there had to be an easier way to make a living than<br/>
dealing with these awful kids.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I figured out it wasn&#39;t the kids that were awful, it was me and<br/>
my attitude.  I was doing it the way I had been taught, even though I could<br/>
have easily written you a list a mile long of things I didn&#39;t like about the<br/>
way I was taught.  So it&#39;s taken ongoing, thoughtful effort to find a better<br/>
way, and I appreciate the compliment a lot.<br/>

A parent called yesterday to reschedule a lesson time and told me her<br/>
teenage daughter (a new-ish student) thinks I&#39;m cool and loves playing<br/>
violin.  I was flying high all afternoon!<br/>
