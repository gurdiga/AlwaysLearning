<div id="ygrps-yiv-744002987">Dear Jane, et al,<br/>
<br/>
This is such a Great example of why school sucks.  The<br/>
often successful attempts to turn the written word<br/>
into drudgery just burn me up.<br/>
<br/>
I am with you Jane.<br/>
<br/>
I was the proverbial Teacher&#39;s Pet until Middle<br/>
School, when I realized the whole scraping and bowing<br/>
down deal wasn&#39;t for me.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the grade depended on whether or not I enjoyed<br/>
the subject matter.  I could always manage A&#39;s with<br/>
little study time,(public school), and seemed to be<br/>
able to get a C just by showing up and doing the<br/>
in-class stuff.  I was Lucky, it was always easy for<br/>
me.  Though it wasn&#39;t very nurturing, at least I<br/>
wasn&#39;t Tortured by the &quot;failure&quot; label as so many are.<br/>
<br/>
I managed to get the &quot;3.5&quot; formula down well enough to<br/>
CLEP out of the first year of college English.  But, <br/>
the lasting impact of having my high school work<br/>
meaninglessly criticized lead me to actually alter my<br/>
exact course of study as to avoid having to write<br/>
Research papers.<br/>
<br/>
My senior year high school English teacher was an<br/>
ex-nun. We had to write on Hamlet and I chose to come<br/>
at it from a Feminist point of view.   How did their<br/>
view of their own power/lack thereof effect the<br/>
outcomes, etc...........<br/>
<br/>
That idiot teacher could do no better than mark up my<br/>
paper for &quot;incorrect sentence structure&quot;.  Makes you<br/>
wonder if any of these teachers actually consider the<br/>
merits of REAL Literature, with all it&#39;s rule breaking<br/>
and original perspective.  Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>
the crap examples in grammar text books?<br/>
<br/>
It has taken me many years to see it for the<br/>
inconsequential pursuit that it is.  Making grades and<br/>
appeasing the nonsensical standards of the modern day<br/>
classroom is beyond useless.  It&#39;s character damaging.<br/>
 It&#39;s soul shrinking. If addressed specifically, much<br/>
of it ought to be found Criminal as it certainly<br/>
illustrates cruel and unusual punishment for so many.<br/>
<br/>
Most of what infuriates me is what it steals form us<br/>
all: Joyful Readers,  Curious Thinkers, Inspired<br/>
Writers.<br/>
<br/>
I am now 11 years away from formal education.  I have<br/>
just begun writing for pleasure.  It is a talent that<br/>
I am only now beginning to explore developing.  I am<br/>
37 years old.  How far behind has all that coerced<br/>
composition put me?  I will never be able to answer<br/>
that.  But I am certain that the passion I have for<br/>
the written word was long delayed due to those years<br/>
of forced writing.<br/>
<br/>
Shame on them.<br/>
<br/>
How can the goal of institutionalized coercive<br/>
education be seen as anything short of diminishing<br/>
humanity.  Controlling thought.  Creating a submissive<br/>
populace. <br/>
<br/>
The results are Undeniable.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Interesting essay - vent<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HI all -<br/>
&gt; Thanks Pam for passing along that essay....it<br/>
&gt; stirred up a long ago <br/>
&gt; hurt....In 5th grade we had to write an essay about<br/>
&gt; a voyage across the <br/>
&gt; ocean....like a 13 yo boy who signed on to work on a<br/>
&gt; ship for his passage to <br/>
&gt; the new country or something....I started the essay<br/>
&gt; like this:  (can you <br/>
&gt; believe I can still remember it!!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot; I don&#39; t know why I did it, but I did.  I signed<br/>
&gt; up to work on the xxxx <br/>
&gt; ship so that I can get to America.&quot;  (something in<br/>
&gt; there about being afraid <br/>
&gt; too)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I felt very creative starting it out like a journal<br/>
&gt; entry.....I was pretty <br/>
&gt; thrilled with my idea.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My favorite teacher of all time SQUASHED it!  Told<br/>
&gt; me that it was not <br/>
&gt; appropriate.....totally shocked me with her red pen<br/>
&gt; editing and criticizing <br/>
&gt; my creativity!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later that year, she used one of my writing samples<br/>
&gt; on an overhead to point <br/>
&gt; out errors.....she didn&#39;t show my name but I was<br/>
&gt; horrified.....here I was <br/>
&gt; walking around thinking I knew something about<br/>
&gt; writing!   I read A LOT and I <br/>
&gt; remember specifically that I was playing with a<br/>
&gt; style that I had noticed in a <br/>
&gt; book....ugh!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Into college, I felt unsure of my writing<br/>
&gt; ability.....taking risks with my <br/>
&gt; writing became very difficult and I mostly stayed on<br/>
&gt; the safe side in high <br/>
&gt; school.....my parents use a different language so I<br/>
&gt; felt that I was <br/>
&gt; rightfully unsure since I was using a &#39;second<br/>
&gt; language&#39; so if others thought <br/>
&gt; my writing wasn&#39;t good, it probably isn&#39;t....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; even now, I feel that I should edit what I post.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ugh.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and then there are all those formulas for poetry,<br/>
&gt; too....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; okay, nuff venting!  thanks for listening!<br/>
&gt; Jane<br/>
&gt; <br/>

delayed. Perhaps it has only matured.<br/>
Good Luck!!<br/>
