<div id="ygrps-yiv-594935336">Ok--so I just read this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; playing a game is not<br/>
violent. Playing a game is sitting on a couch with a remote control.<br/>
<br/>
Shaming a kid who wants to sit on the couch with a remote control, or somehow<br/>
preventing him from playing, is closer to violence than a kid causing the<br/>
character he&#39;s controlling to shoot an imaginary weapon at some pixels.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This makes sense to me.  SO I&#39;m not sure why I haven&#39;t completely made the shift to knowing it in my bones.  Maybe I just need to simmer a bit.  deschool my societal message.  ?  <br/>
