<div id="ygrps-yiv-945560523">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
A year ago I moved out of my rented home when it was foreclosed.? Luckily my youngest son and I were able to find a little house to live in.? Now we will be moving again since Trevor is ready to head out on his own, and the freeway is being constructed right over my back fence.? As we all probably know moving books is HEAVY.? I have boxes of the book I wrote on the unschooling of my five kids.? I would like to lighten the load for the next move.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like a book - and perhaps one to give your local library you can just send me $5/book with your address and I&#39;ll happily send you a book or two.? You can see more about the book at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolingreflections.com/">http://www.homeschoolingreflections.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
My mailing address is:? Connie Colten~8710 Buena Valley~Santee CA 92071.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Connie<br/>
<br/>

Just curious... I really dislike spam and this feels like spam.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t check the link, since I&#39;m not at all interested in homeschooling<br/>
books, even ones that are supposedly about unschooling.  Well, if it&#39;s<br/>
about unschooling then why isn&#39;t that part of the title?<br/>
<br/>
If this person really doesn&#39;t want to move books, then she should donate<br/>
them to the library herself.  Just my thoughts this morning, as I&#39;m<br/>
happily reading wonderful things about unschooling, then get this thrown<br/>
my way!</div>

of San Diego area homeschooling when I started out in the early 90&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s real, but I understand the annoyed feeling.<br/>
<br/>
There are people in all directions from here creating sites and  <br/>
writing books and making organizations to make money or to make a  <br/>
name, and it bothers me most when the person isn&#39;t clearly an  <br/>
unschooler, or when their split from &quot;the mainstream&quot; of unschooling  <br/>
(if there could be considered to be one) is because their ideas don&#39;t  <br/>
hold up in discussions such as this one.   But when someone who has  <br/>
truly spent lots of time helping other unschoolers openly and freely  <br/>
then makes a book or whatever, I&#39;m willing to encourage people to buy  <br/>
it, because it ends up making up for some of the time they gave away.<br/>
<br/>
Rue Kream&#39;s book, for instance is great for people to have, but Rue  <br/>
wasn&#39;t withholding information to make money (and she had good  <br/>
information; not saying the book of the topic has).<br/>
<br/>
I saw something out on blogs the other day like 101 reasons why I  <br/>
unschool--I ordered a copy but can&#39;t speak to it yet.   It seemed like  <br/>
a potentially good idea.    Has anyone seen that?<br/>
<br/>
I think those who don&#39;t help freely and then want money are deeply  <br/>
suspect, myself.   People have helped me lately by donating money to  <br/>
help pay for the chatroom and my website, and unschooling.info (which  <br/>
is being phased out) and I really appreciate the assistance, but it  <br/>
didn&#39;t go to me to spend for fun.  It&#39;s not like I bought a burger  <br/>
with it.  It&#39;s straight from PayPal back to paying for sites and  <br/>
services.<br/>

never come across that name and I have a pretty good grasp on who is<br/>

I know of everyone by any stretch!  Nor am I an authority on all things<br/>
unschooling ;)  Really!  I&#39;m here like everyone else, learning everyday.<br/>
<br/>
I guess part of my learning is hearing about new names and books...<br/>

about her book many times over the years and have read bits and pieces<br/>
of it.<br/>

writing about 9-10 yrs ago.  I&#39;ve seen people drop off lists and then<br/>
never hear of them again.  I remember so many people like that, but I<br/>
don&#39;t ever remember hearing of this person.  I feel better knowing that<br/>
it wasn&#39;t a spammer out spamming their homeschooling wares to<br/>
unschoolers.  That really bugs me!</div>
