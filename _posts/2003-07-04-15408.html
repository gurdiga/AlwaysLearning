I&#39;m sure there are e-mail lists for which it might have seemed appropriate, <br/>
but I&#39;m certain, as listowner, that this isn&#39;t one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want this list used for people to tell me who to vote for to preserve <br/>
homeschooling freedoms when election time comes, either.  That&#39;s another <br/>
irritation about homeschoolers.  We have people here from at least three different <br/>
countries,  and natural learning works the same way in all of them, so <br/>
political discussions are not useful or fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-623375921">I apologize for forwarding the article, but if the only things we should <br/>
be sharing must directly involve unschooling then I think about 75% of <br/>
my alwayslearning e-mail doesn&#39;t fit the bill...but I enjoy reading them <br/>
anyway as I learn new things about all of you and what you&#39;re interested <br/>
in.  I was pretty sure that unschooling = life-learning, (well, just <br/>
plain living) and pretty much included all topics even pregnancy, <br/>

children, why shouldn&#39;t we be able to with each other?  I know I&#39;ve <br/>
learned a lot from reading what all of you have to say...things like <br/>
braiding and coloring hair, lots of travel stories, etc.  It&#39;s all <br/>
interesting and fun to read.<br/>
<br/>
But I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s that big of a deal and again, I apologize. <br/>

Hi Folks.  I have not posted in ages and ages, but I<br/>
am still here.  I just wanted to say that I agree with<br/>
Sandra that politics and propaganda, (and the schisms<br/>
which therein lie) get really tiresome in the<br/>
homeschooling community.  I realize that was not the<br/>
intent of the poster here, who inadveretantly<br/>
championed a political message, so don&#39;t anybody get<br/>
your panties in a bunch or think I am pointing<br/>
fingers.<br/>
<br/>
There are some things we can take beneficially from<br/>
this conversation, and some homeschooling/unschooling<br/>
points to consider, as I see it.  &quot;Don&#39;t believe<br/>
everything the media feeds you&quot; is a very good rule of<br/>
thumb, even with major news services (especially with<br/>
major news services?)  Most news is presented with a<br/>
&quot;spin&quot; or an &quot;angle&quot;, or given a human interest facet.<br/>
 Most news services must answer to higher political<br/>
and financial powers through the corporations which<br/>
own them, and through the government itself.  What&#39;s<br/>
the filtering process?  How reliable is the source,<br/>
given the incumbent pressures upon it?  <br/>
<br/>
As far as our own families go, how do we talk to our<br/>
kids about political propaganda in general?  Does<br/>
anyone have any personal stories to tell about how<br/>
politics or urban legends impacted your kids or your<br/>
family in their use of the internet or elsewhere?  My<br/>
kids are not really old enough to understand more than<br/>
playground politics, but I would be interested in<br/>
hearing how some of you brilliant folks have tackled<br/>
these issues.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The irrational fear of the internet is known to us because people have many <br/>
times said &quot;You let your kids have E-MAIL?&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
You let your kids go on the internet?<br/>
or<br/>
You publish your children&#39;s NAMES?<br/>
<br/>
The paranoia that has people hiding in their homes using anonymous names and <br/>
picking their mail up at the post office instead of at their house has pretty <br/>
good reason behind it for some people.  Drug dealers.  Schizophrenics.    <br/>
People wanted for terrorist acts involving filing cabinets in the 1960&#39;s (or <br/>
worse).   Illegal aliens.<br/>
<br/>
If we hide, the world is smaller.<br/>
If I treat my children like little children who should be afraid, THEY are <br/>
smaller.<br/>
<br/>
Why make children small in a small world when I&#39;m right there with them?  <br/>
They can be big in a bigger world.<br/>

<br/>
But as to the above, we talk about that just like we talk talk talk about<br/>
everything else. Both my kids, 9 and 13, are really interested in politics,<br/>
especially the 9 yr old who is into reading and creating political cartoons.<br/>
I think it&#39;s imperative for us to help our kids with their decoding skills<br/>
about propaganda, just like product advertising (and aren&#39;t they one and the<br/>
same now these days anyway?).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooo, this just happened today and I was wanting to share it without<br/>
someone. Rain was emailing a friend and called me to ask what I thought<br/>
of what she had written. The friend had forwarded an email that said<br/>
something along the lines of &quot;forward this to all your friends to help<br/>
this child who is dying of cancer&quot;, and Rain was supicious. <br/>
<br/>
I was especially impressed because she&#39;s pretty new at email (and to<br/>
writing in general), so most of the info she has about urban legends she<br/>
has apparently got from listening to my rantings for 7 or 8 years...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she gave me permission to forward this on. It&#39;s more readable if<br/>
you mentally put a question mark after wife and change &quot;there&quot; to<br/>
&quot;they&#39;re&quot;. OTOH, I&#39;ve never seen her write anything using parentheses or<br/>
quotation marks before, so that was cool. And, of course, she clearly<br/>
knows her spam....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh boy I have a ton of mail since last Thursday!!! I am responding to this <br/>
because I accidentally opened it while trying to sort email.<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago, after another weekend of my DH power washing our street, he <br/>
asked that I call the city and find out why we never see a street sweeper. Our <br/>
house is a year old. I called and was told that our street had not been <br/>
&quot;bonded&quot; yet, so I would have to contact the builder and find out when they would <br/>
sweep the street. So I did. Builder states, &quot;No the street was bonded about a <br/>
year ago, the city is responsible, call the city.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m getting frustrated. I start to wonder what is included in my $6K a <br/>
year property taxes. I was sure I saw public services on the bill. So I call the <br/>
city back. I&#39;m put on hold while the representative &quot;checks&quot; the street <br/>
sweeping maps. She comes back to say, we are not on it, call the builder. <br/>
<br/>
Now DH is pissed. He says, &quot;Didn&#39;t you, Kass & Kree work on the mayors <br/>
campaign?&quot; Lightbulb moment...&quot;hey, yeah we did...&quot; DH says, email him. So I did. <br/>
During election time the girls and I worked on his campaign, because he is a <br/>
supporter of homeschooling (or so he says) and although we have different <br/>
political views, he was kind and my kids had a great time learning about elections. <br/>
<br/>
So I went there...email from an HS mom, who&#39;s children worked to have him <br/>
elected and had been in his home on several occasions, and that being one of the <br/>
highest tax brackets for this city, without which all the new crap we are <br/>
getting would not be possible, yada, yada, yada. Then I hit the nail on the head <br/>
when I brought up that at the end of our street is the new elementary school. <br/>
So for the health and well being of the city&#39;s children, some thing must be <br/>
done. (The streets were attracting mosquitoes and algae was building.) And that I <br/>
no longer felt my DH and my water should be the ones mantaining the streets <br/>
of our city.<br/>
<br/>
That all started at about 9:30 am. 2:00 pm here comes a street sweeper. I <br/>
don&#39;t know who sent it, I only know it came. I was happy and sad at the same <br/>
time. Glad I was heard, sad I had to bitch to be heard. But the girls learned that <br/>
when you jump through the hoops people throw out, when you get tired of doing <br/>
so, just go above them. It may not always turn out the way you want, but at <br/>
least you will have given your best shot, especially when you want to see <br/>
change.<br/>
