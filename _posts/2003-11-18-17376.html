NOT online!  Any bright student who takes the time to prepare for and <br/>
take three GRE exams, passes them with a high enough score, could get <br/>
up to 90 undergraduate credit hours.  You will pay 3 x $130 (cost per <br/>
test), or $390. That&#39;s only $4.33 per college credit hour!!! What <br/>
scholarship could ever give you that kind of bargain? Without paying <br/>
for room and board. <br/>
<br/>
And if that student then prepared for and passed an assortment of the <br/>
other testing options available [CLEP, Excelsior College <br/>
Examinations, DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSSTs), the Thomas <br/>
Edison College Examination Program (TECEP), Ohio University Credit By <br/>
Examination Program, the New York University Foreign Language Testing <br/>
Program, AP Exams], as well as the Graduate Record Exams (GRE), s/he <br/>
could easily have completed what is required for a fully accredited <br/>
four-year college degree for as little as $700.  By combining any of <br/>
these with some college classes, in person or by correspondence, one <br/>
can earn a fully accredited valid 4-year college degree.  <br/>
<br/>
For more details on this read Brad Voeller&#39;s book, Accelerated <br/>
Distance Learning: The New Way To Earn Your College Degree In The <br/>
Twenty-First Century.  Well worth the small investment in this book.  <br/>

Oh, I forgot.  You can also do internships, portfolio assessments, <br/>
and independent study courses to credit at most regular colleges.  <br/>

I was thinking of taking 3 GRE&#39;s but found that most of the colleges who take crdit for examination cost quite a bit just to evaluate those credits. Excelsior is something like $1500. Can you shed any light on this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Again, I guess it would depend on what you want.  If that piece of <br/>
paper called a diploma is important to you, then you will ultimately <br/>
have to pay someone to evaluate whatever credits you have <br/>
accumulated, from all sources, for them to issue you that diploma.  <br/>
Colleges are in the diploma business.  They expect you to pay for <br/>
that piece of paper that they issue.  Hence I would sure do some <br/>
shopping around to see who is willing to do this for the least amount <br/>
of money.  But even if you had to spend $1500 + the $700 to earn the <br/>
credits from passing various tests, you would still be lightyears <br/>
ahead of any other 4-year accredited college expenses.  And you get <br/>
to do it on your own time, on your own terms.<br/>
<br/>
But if the diploma isn&#39;t so important, like if you are going on to <br/>
grad school, for example, then you just submit your credits, <br/>
especially those GRE exams, and keep going until you have completed <br/>
whatever degree satisfies your personal goals.  <br/>
<br/>
Or, if the job you want doesn&#39;t necessarily require the diploma, just <br/>
the college credits, a transcript, that you can put together <br/>
yourself, just like the high school one I put together for my <br/>
daugther, listing what you have done to complete whatever you have <br/>
completed that is college level work, could suffice.  Same goes for <br/>
the portfolio assessments, the internships, and the independent study <br/>
courses.  Then your employer might be willing to foot the bill to do <br/>
whatever is necessary to get you that diploma.  Especially if you do <br/>
your job well.<br/>
<br/>
For more details and all the possible options do get Brad Voeller&#39;s <br/>
book, Accelerated Distance Learning.  It spells out everything in <br/>
detail.  <br/>
<br/>
Life:  just a long series of choices!<br/>

Here&#39;s a site that is all about credit-by-examination that says that <br/>
four states &quot;grant valid, recognized, external degrees that can be <br/>
obtained ENTIRELY through credit by examination.&quot; <br/>

<br/>
A Minor Bird <br/>
<br/>
I have wished a bird would fly away, <br/>
And not sing by my house all day;<br/>
<br/>
Have clapped my hands at him from the door<br/>
When it seemed as if I could bear no more.<br/>
<br/>
The fault must partly have been in me, <br/>
The bird was not to blame for his key.<br/>
<br/>
And of course there must be something wrong<br/>
in wanting to silence any song.<br/>
