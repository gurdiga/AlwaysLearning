<div id="ygrps-yiv-927467923">I have been thinking about something Pam mentioned in a post last week,<br/>
about how it&#39;s difficult for some to get past the &quot;Christian&quot; teaching that<br/>
children all are born with a &quot;sin nature.&quot;  (I know you didn&#39;t word it like<br/>
that, but I can&#39;t seem to locate that post -- correct me if I&#39;m wrong.)  I<br/>
personally do not believe that children are born bad -- how we could we<br/>
think that of such a sweet, cuddly baby??  But I felt I still needed to<br/>
clarify this more in my own thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve witnessed a family we know so distrust their children that the children<br/>
now do seem very dishonest, I believe partly because the parents never would<br/>
trust them to make wise choices on their own.  They&#39;re always looking to<br/>
&quot;catch&quot; them misbehaving, and sure enough, as soon as the parents&#39; eyes look<br/>
the other way, here&#39;s their chance.  &quot;FINALLY Mom and Dad aren&#39;t looking!<br/>
Let&#39;s give them what they expect!&quot;  They hover over those children like<br/>
eagles -- the Mom even admitted she&#39;d been watching MY daughter for two<br/>
months!!  &quot;HEY!!  Get away, you!&quot; I felt like saying.  I did say something<br/>
similar, but a little nicer.  :)  It made me feel really weird.  She went on<br/>
to point out some ways she thought my daughter needed to pay more attention<br/>
to her daughter, and the like.  I replied that I didn&#39;t think she needed to<br/>
be watched that closely -- she&#39;s almost 11 -- and we like to let her make<br/>
her own decisions about who to play with, etc., as long as she&#39;s not<br/>
purposely trying to exclude others at times when they&#39;re all together.  Very<br/>
touchy situation.  The children complain about this particular friend of my<br/>
daughter&#39;s, about her being so controlling and forceful.  Just like the<br/>
mother.  I am seeing how destructive it can be, and how self-defeating the<br/>
behavior is.  The father said to us last night, &quot;If you let the children<br/>
alone, they WILL misbehave.  I&#39;ve seen it myself.  We&#39;ve got to keep an eye<br/>
on the children at all times.&quot;  I just sat there with my mouth hanging open,<br/>
thinking, &quot;Oohhh,  now I get it.  THAT&#39;S why your having such problems with<br/>
your children and they&#39;re so controlling of others.&quot;  (The father wanted to<br/>
meet with my family and another family to discuss why his daughter feels<br/>
left out of things when they get together.  The Mom sat there close to tears<br/>
wondering why the other children avoid her daughter at times and why<br/>
everyone doesn&#39;t embrace her).   Well, I kind of got off on that -- let me<br/>
share a quote from a John Holt book that about sums it up for me, before I<br/>
confuse myself!<br/>
<br/>
I found a quote from John Holt&#39;s book (I believe it&#39;s Patrick Farenga<br/>
writing), that sums it up so beautifully and helped me to understand it more<br/>
fully.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For instance, the observation that children are &quot;born kind&quot; is not the same<br/>
as they&#39;re being born without need of any moral upbringing as they are<br/>
innately good.  In our office I heard John talk angrily about people who he<br/>
felt belonged in jail, who were just &quot;bad cats&quot; (John&#39;s phrase for such<br/>
people), and children who were willfully bad in some pretty awful ways.  He<br/>
didn&#39;t view all people as innately good; he didn&#39;t view all people as<br/>
innately bad, either.  He simply wanted us to recognize that there is a<br/>
tendency toward kindness present in children to which they respond, and that<br/>
working with that tendency, rather than ignoring it, quashing it, or<br/>
distorting it, can make living and learning with children easier for us<br/>
all.  The chances that good behavior, character, and morals will take root<br/>
in an atmosphere of kindness are much better than if we assume the worst in<br/>
children and use kindness only as a reward for good behavior, rather than<br/>
the norm for our relationships.&quot;  (Teach Your Own, p. 85)<br/>
<br/>
What a great insight.  Jimi Ann<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435100548">-=-The father said to us last night, &quot;If you let the children<br/>
alone, they WILL misbehave. I&#39;ve seen it myself. We&#39;ve got to keep an  <br/>
eye<br/>
on the children at all times.&quot; I just sat there with my mouth hanging  <br/>
open,<br/>
thinking, &quot;Oohhh, now I get it. THAT&#39;S why your having such problems  <br/>
with<br/>
your children and they&#39;re so controlling of others.&quot; =-<br/>
<br/>
Years ago when my kids were about 2, 4, 7, thereabouts, there was a  <br/>
campout, a medium-sized SCA event WAY far from any town.  Nobody  <br/>
besides us would be anywhere near.<br/>
<br/>
We found a little canyon of sorts and declared it the &quot;kid area&quot; and  <br/>
invited other families with kids to camp there.  Keith set up a  <br/>
platform we had, kind of a 2&#39; high stage, for the kids to play on (so  <br/>
they could stay out of rocks and cactus that that).   We made a kids&#39;  <br/>
cooler, with all foods they could eat easily, and drinks.  We had a  <br/>
kids&#39; first aid kit.  We had toys that could pass for medieval toys.   <br/>
We had ribbons on wands and toy swords and other fun things.    <br/>
Sometimes the adults would be gone from camp for half an hour or an  <br/>
hour, but the kids were set up to be fairly self-sufficient, and we  <br/>
had planned not to micromanage them.<br/>
<br/>
One family also had three kids; military family (same mom who wanted  <br/>
to &quot;discuss our relationship&quot; a couple of years before that; they  <br/>
eventually moved back to Alabama).  Another family was more like my  <br/>
kids, quieter, a little sullen, but not sneaky.<br/>
<br/>
A childless woman in our camp, friends of everyone there, girlfriend  <br/>
of one of my husband&#39;s squires, took me for a walk Saturday night,  <br/>
after we&#39;d been there a day and a half.  We were on a dirt road in the  <br/>
darkest dark, in west central New Mexico, not a light for 30 miles  <br/>
except the fires from the camps behind us.  That makes it easy to  <br/>
remember that walk.<br/>
<br/>
She apologized to me for having thought my kids were awful, because  <br/>
she said she had thought the other family&#39;s kids were great, but when  <br/>
she arrived in camp and went into her tent and could hear the kids  <br/>
interacting, she said our kids were just the same as they would have  <br/>
been if Keith and I had been there, and the other family&#39;s kids were  <br/>
trying to persuade Kirby to do things they shouldn&#39;t and Kirby (one of  <br/>
the oldest) was saying no, we&#39;re not doing that, and managing the  <br/>
whole group and making sure the youngest kids were happy.<br/>
<br/>
She said if she ever had kids she was definitely going to come and  <br/>
talk to me about what we had done and how.<br/>
<br/>
I used to babysit those other kids sometimes, and they were truly,  <br/>
deeply over-controlled.  And the dad would say &quot;I better not ever see  <br/>
you do that,&quot; and that&#39;s what he meant.  He was telling them in plain  <br/>
English that they could do it, as long as he didn&#39;t see it.<br/>
<br/>
I sympathized with them, and would let them go a little crazy at our  <br/>
house, but they were girl/boy/girl and the boy was quick and strong  <br/>
and desperate to make ANY decisions, to have ANY moment of personhood,  <br/>
of respect, of the smile of an adult even when he wasn&#39;t kowtowing to  <br/>
every crazy &quot;because I said so&quot; demand.<br/>
<br/>
He had NO reasons on earth to &quot;be good,&quot; except to avoid his parents&#39;  <br/>
punishments.<br/>
<br/>
My kids had no reasons on earth to &quot;be bad.&quot;  It made no sense to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609136096">When Lanora was about 7 we were friends with a family who was controlling<br/>
and distrustful of their children.  One day we were outside calling for<br/>
Lanora and the friend&#39;s daughter who were quite a ways away from us, when<br/>
they didn&#39;t respond I just began to chat a bit and wait patiently for them<br/>
to move into ear shot (the grass was wet, I didn&#39;t want wet shoes and I was<br/>
in no hurry).  I knew, without a doubt, that Lanora hadn&#39;t heard me or she<br/>
would have come.<br/>
<br/>
We chatted and when Lanora wandered a bit closer I called again, she<br/>
immediately came (running even) with Becca following.  The friend<br/>
immediately launched into accusations that they purposely ignored us, knew<br/>
we wanted to leave and pretended to not hear.  Lanora looked at her like she<br/>
had just told her she was actually a hippopotamus and could speak martian.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this was our final time socializing, since the friend was not<br/>
sorry even after I pointed out how inappropriate she had been.  I tried, for<br/>
the last time, to illustrate that this attitude was telling Becca that she<br/>
could not be trusted.  The sad part was that this woman&#39;s children WERE<br/>
sneaky; controlling too.<br/>
<br/>
We each had what we expected; Lanora was honest and I would have trusted her<br/>
with anything.  Part of this is how she was born but even with a second<br/>
child who wasn&#39;t as reliably honest, trusting him lead to more reliability<br/>
not less.<br/>
<br/>
A child can always apologize for lying (especially if the parents have open<br/>
arms) but a parent can&#39;t take back an accusation; the can apologize but it&#39;s<br/>
still out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894199627">I see this a lot on Facebook. Yes on Facebook.<br/>
I have local homeschooling moms, friends from school, friends from LaLeche, family members and unschooling friends.<br/>
One one side there is all this posting from the unschooling families about how wonderful their kids are and about spending time with them and how they love it.<br/>
On the other side ate the postings from the other group complaining about their kids, happy to be away from them and have their own time.<br/>
The other day one local homeschool mom posted:<br/>
&quot; five year-old says it&#39;s Push Your Buttons Day today&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or stuff like<br/>
<br/>
&quot;wonders what it is about boys, sunshine, and a magnifying glass that makes such a powerful -- or is it irritating? -- combination&quot;<br/>

The most mean-spirited, hateful children I ever saw were the children of strict Christian families.

My older boys were baffled by it and this was back before we went full-on unschooling. We quit hanging out with that group of course, in spite of some pretty nice families that also attended. <br/>

<br/>
I grew up surrounded by all that.  And vowed to get out.  Biding my time.<br/>
Yes of course I was sneaky though I wasn&#39;t intentionally mean.  My parents<br/>
have apologized for many things, and I agree with Kris that once the<br/>
accusation goes out, it hangs in the air... in my case I felt that<br/>
accusation for years after I had grown and left home.  I am not bashing<br/>
Christians.  It&#39;s too bad that the culture of Christianity often encourages<br/>
the very things spoken against by creating self-fulfilling prophecies.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can easily fall into the trap of distrusting their children and<br/>
equating every person and every thing as full-blown evil, when the<br/>
scriptures only go so far as to say &quot;there was none good.&quot;  Not being good<br/>
is a long long way from all-out evil.  I never have quite bought all the<br/>
haranguing about original sin as reflected in daily life.  Sure there&#39;s such<br/>
a thing as full-blown evil and a huge reason for that is the lack of love<br/>
and integrity in the revolving door of generations of adults as they pass<br/>
through with the jaded baton of distrust to give the next generation.  Oh<br/>
adults who are also very sneaky, with all those double standards that tend<br/>
to catch up in the least expected moments.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so much easier and happier and freer to be honest with ourselves and<br/>
see straight.  To avoid exaggerations and maligning.  To let our yes be yes<br/>
and our no be no rather than dancing around and be titillated by all the<br/>
temptations to use knowledge and power to our advantage against our own<br/>
children no less.  It&#39;s much more sane and virtuous and sweet to share<br/>
power, to encourage interdependence and celebrate the wonder of each new<br/>
person each new day.  To cultivate gratitude for it all.  Gosh my life is<br/>
much happier now that I&#39;m a parent who decided to do those things, and drop<br/>
the baton that I received at a very young and tender age.  I&#39;m not in the<br/>
same race anymore anyway, right?<br/>

<br/>
I remember being in a class in school where the teacher entered the  <br/>
first day with a whole bunch of rules to prevent us from taking  <br/>
advantage of her because we weren&#39;t to be trusted. (Obviously a  <br/>
reaction to trust broken in the past by a few kids.)<br/>
<br/>
To add data to the theory, I wish I could say how badly the class  <br/>
behaved because of that, but I don&#39;t remember ;-) But I do remember  <br/>
yanking away my benefit-of-the-doubt respect at that moment. And  <br/>
there wasn&#39;t a motivation to maintain her respect in me by being  <br/>
trustworthy since she obviously had none to begin with.<br/>

I think parents and adults look at their own lives to convince themselves that they, themselves aren&#39;t trustworthy because of their own mistakes.  But really, that&#39;s how we learn - if we don&#39;t let the fear in after the lesson.</div>

often strict, BUT, they were simultaneously very supportive and showed<br/>
they loved us kids daily.<br/>
<br/>
Being a nice parent that truly cared for my kids, came somewhat<br/>
naturally because of this.  Bucking the school system came relatively<br/>
easy for me too.  Changing the dynamic of parenting, not seeking to<br/>
control my kids, but to live harmoniously with them, that was harder for<br/>
me!  I still learn things everyday, how to do things better.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t share with my parents, like my own teen does with me.  That is<br/>
directly related to being my child&#39;s partner.  I intentionally created a<br/>
relationship that wasn&#39;t based on a parent vs. child sort of dynamic,<br/>
and worked toward one that was an &quot;US&quot; dynamic that was often centered<br/>
on my child&#39;s needs first, and before my own.</div>
