<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164507079">Hi There,<br/>
<br/>
I happily jumped into de/unschooling sooner than planned with my two daughters, Ella, aged 6 and Jane, aged 4.  <br/>
<br/>
This past week has been very fun for all of us but I&#39;m not getting as much office work done as I ought.<br/>
<br/>
On our first day, Monday, I used a timer to divide my work time from our together time - about an hour at a time in the morning and about 30 to 45 minutes at a time in the afternoon.  It seemed pretty successful.  They knew what to expect and I had better focus, knowing I only had a certain amount of time to work.<br/>
<br/>
By yesterday, however, we didn&#39;t bother with a timer and I found myself a little less calm and my youngest a little more needy.  It made me think I should stick with using a timer at least until we all get used this new life.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of letting each day proceed more organically but am not sure if it&#39;s something I should jump into or stick with a timer for now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like opinions on the timer thing and to see what other approaches have worked for others.  <br/>
<br/>
A little more info just in case it&#39;s pertinent: We live and work on our farm.  I&#39;m the office personnel and am in the habit of doing my office work on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays (Saturdays are also possible but the remaining days are not).  The children are not required to do things related to farming but are thanked and paid when they do.   They are very good at playing by themselves and with each other but, like most of us, flag in the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any insights and experience.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha,<br/>
Miliana</div>

<br/>
Instead of using a timer, then, play with them and then when they&#39;re tired, put on a great video and do your work nearby while they&#39;re watching that.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re not ever leaving the six year old to watch the four year old.<br/>

Perhaps you could hire an older kid as a mother&#39;s helper so you can divide your work time from your together time.  <br/>

Something that helped me when I worked from home was to divide my work into parts I could multi-task and parts where I needed to focus - or were dangerous around small children. The multi-task jobs I&#39;d bring with me to where my daughter was and pick up and put down work as needed. Things I needed to focus on I did in the evenings when my partner was available to spend time with my daughter. Now we&#39;ve flipped rolls and he does something similar, but since she&#39;s older he can also plan to do some focused work during the times of the day when she&#39;s deeply involved in a project of her own. <br/>

<br/>
I will review my budget for affording a helper once a week. That would be useful on the day my bookkeeper comes. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your advice. :-)<br/>
