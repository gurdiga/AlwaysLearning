<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065270063">What&#39;s below is from Kathryn (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:KathrynJB@...">KathrynJB@...</a>).  It was posted to the <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion list, but I thought there might be people here with great <br/>
ideas.  There could be a free book and temporary immortality in it for you! (And <br/>
you&#39;d help other people.)<br/>
<br/>
Either mail them to Kathryn or just respond here.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Barbara Sher, the author of Wishcraft and other books, is willing to speak at <br/>
the Live & Learn Unschooling Conference in August in Massachusetts if we can <br/>
help her by sending her tips, stories, and anecdotes about how we empower and <br/>
nurture our children (or were nurtured ourselves, as children) so that they <br/>
don&#39;t forget who they are and what their dreams are.<br/>
<br/>
She has agreed that if we can send her at least one hundred useable stories <br/>
or tips in the next month, she&#39;ll come. <br/>
<br/>
More details: She says,  &quot;I need to know what parents learned, what they wish <br/>
they had known earlier, what they wish someone had done for them. <br/>
<br/>
Even parts of stories and questions would be great. But certainly and good <br/>
(or bad) experiences you&#39;ve had, and things you do that seem to work, or <br/>
don&#39;t, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I have a number of my own stories and tips of course, but in a &quot;tips&quot; books, <br/>
the wider the experiences -- that is the more people contribute -- the more <br/>
people it can help. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone whose contribution I use will certainly get a book (it might be an <br/>
e-book at first).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some examples: Julie&#39;s story about her grandfather, maybe something about <br/>
what you learned about chores...<br/>
<br/>
TIP: Remind your children to pay attention to what their interests and dreams <br/>
are. Let them know that these are of great importance to them and to the <br/>
world. Teach them that when they love doing something, they&#39;re sure to be <br/>
very <br/>
good at it. Tell them to be themselves, not try to be like someone else, <br/>
because <br/>
there are great and unique gifts inside them, and every human is an original, <br/>
and one of a kind. <br/>
<br/>
TIP: remind children that college is only one way to achieve success or even <br/>
to earn a living. If they enjoy college, they should go. If not, it&#39;s not <br/>
essential. (They can always start their own business and hire college <br/>
graduates if <br/>
they like.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I need everything I can get, and SOON!<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please ask me. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all!<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
