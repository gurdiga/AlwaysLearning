That link leads to two pages with nice additional writing from yesterday (not mine; look there to see whose), and Pam Sorooshian let me know just this morning that two (of the four) talks I gave at the HSC conference in Sacramento are available to download for $7.<br/>
<br/>
The link above has links to my notes on those talks.<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard them yet myself, so I hope they&#39;re good ones and not the kind of embarrassing ones where I want to make a list of notes about what I said and what I wish I had said instead. :-)<br/>
