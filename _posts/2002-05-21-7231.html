 </span></blockquote>A colleague of mine here hs her son last year out of necessity (he couldn&#39;t<br/>
pass the nasty exams and move into the next grade and was already old for<br/>
his grade level). They are Kenyan and her whole family was horrified that<br/>
she was hs because for them public schooling is the only way out. We&#39;ve<br/>
talked about it quite a bit and it&#39;s made me realize what a luxury it is to<br/>
be able to say no to factory education for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Kate -- off to a hs meeting. We actually have 7 families now:))) Two from<br/>
South Africa, one Kenyan, one Australian, one Brit, one US, and me (mutt).</div>
