<div dir='ltr'>Interestingly, my daughter just started spontaneously saying to me that her online friend goes to a school for home schoolers where she gets to choose what classes she wants to take and when. &nbsp;The friend likes it. &nbsp;We don&#39;t have any co-ops or anything like that around us but there are probably a much wider variety of choices for people living in larger cities that would provide an opportunity for a child to be in a setting with other kids, doing stuff that feels important, that might fill that desire in their lives.&nbsp;<div>-Cass<br><br><br><div><div dir="ltr"><div><div style="color:#fff;height:0;"></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823132771"><span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;">Hi,</span><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;">We are in the UK and at 11 young people start ‘secondary school’ and it’s a big deal. &nbsp;My daughter saw all her schooled friends starting and attending school (they are a bit older than her) and she felt she was missing out. &nbsp;So i treated it like any other unschooling idea, desire, interest, and we researched it, discussed it, &nbsp;and i supported her with it as best I could. I found her a school place locally (unfortunately we couldn’t afford or weren’t in the right catchment to attend the same schools as her friends!) which she could start at the same time that her cohort were starting. &nbsp;She got excited about having local friends and attending lessons, learned to get the bus and lots of other big steps.</div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;">While she was there I made a point of telling her teachers that she was there BY CHOICE. &nbsp;This seemed quite exciting to some and irrelevant and strange to others. &nbsp;I was aware that I was communicating with the teachers much more than most parents (the school made the email of each teacher available) but they were usually responsive and helpful. I supported her when she was misunderstood and put in the ‘wrong’ class just because she had no grades from previous schooling to show them. If she was humiliated by a teacher (it happened) I took them up on it if she wanted me to. &nbsp;So I took an interest and supported her in this ‘project’ just as I would in any other. &nbsp;I didn’t just hand it all over. &nbsp;I helped her with homework, but didn’t make her do things she thought were stupid or irrelevant. &nbsp;We had quite a good time picking apart some of the homework actually! &nbsp;She wasn’t significantly behind in any topic at all, and found it quite easy, and my daughter is not (so far) naturally studious. &nbsp;(what had they all been doing for 7 years???!!!).</div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;">After a term, the novelty totally wore off! The friendships and the lessons were diasappointing, the social media pressures started to encroach on home time and the pressure on attendance was RELENTLESS. &nbsp;(In the UK, even a 95% attendance record is seen as less than good, you will get letters home and threats. &nbsp;I tried to hide this from my daughter but she knew about the letters and hated to feel like she was ‘in trouble’. &nbsp;Sometimes the pressure of going in every day, even when you feel a bit poorly, or tired, was too much.)&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;">I had stayed at home with my older boy (13, no interest in school at all), and she made the decision at christmas to leave the school and rejoin us at home. &nbsp;I think, looking back, that&nbsp;<i>going to school was one of the best bits of unschooling we have ever done! &nbsp;</i></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><div>If she had attended a different school, things MIGHT have been different, as there was quite a lot of disruptive behaviour at this school that she found really exasperating, and the quality of teaching was pretty patchy, but we had no other choice without moving house. &nbsp;But she has really relaxed into being at home now, appreciates the good friends she has (quality not quantity!) and has thrown herself into a hobby that she probably wouldn’t have time for if she was at school (she now has a pony - another big journey for us together - I have started from zero knowledge but recognised her dream as a big learning opportunity…for both of us!..).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>She understands the mainstream schooling/parenting world better now and has a deeper level of self awareness and where she fits into a larger concept of society other than school. &nbsp;She knows being at home is a CHOICE that SHE made, not something imposed upon her because of her parents’ ‘’hippy ideas’’ (her words).</div></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;">Hope this very personal perspective helps! &nbsp;Throughout this time i was avidly reading Always Learning and applying the&nbsp;<i>principles</i>&nbsp;as far as I so far understand them, always asking what was the better choice at that time. &nbsp;Not feeling like I needed to have some big masterplan, but that this was a learning adventure with no real idea where it would lead. &nbsp;As long quitting was an option it seemed (mostly!) fun.</div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;">Belinda</div><div style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:12px;line-height:normal;"><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069159917">Belinda, when I read your account, I thought all the way through that it was in the “Unschooling Success” topic! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I love these stories of kids choosing something so profound as going to school (as 99+% of the kids in school are powerlessly in “no choice” mode), and then choosing to come home.  Children with real power in their own lives.  Thank you for sharing in so much detail.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any more energy to do so, maybe you could tell us about her hobby (here or in the unschooling success thread).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415810112">I suppose this topic is no longer about trying school, so feel free to move it to new thread or elsewhere, I&#39;m not sure how to from my email program (I&#39;m afraid I find Yahoo Groups confusing!).<div><br></div><div>You asked about my daughter&#39;s hobby, that she wouldn&#39;t have time for if she was at school. &nbsp;It&#39;s interesting that I&#39;m feeling quite conflicted about this at the moment and so this might be a good opportunity to get to a more peaceful place with it. &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid this might be a long post....</div><div><br></div><div>My daughter has a long history of loving horses and ponies, she was sniffing them and lying on them from a toddler, and her dad was wonderful in supporting her passion, taking her for rides at the local stables and really enjoying doing that with her. &nbsp;I have never been &#39;horsey&#39;, not the type to have ponies on my bedroom wall, and was frankly a bit dismissive, thought it was a girly thing. We lived in a small terrace in a city and I felt like ponies were just not on the radar, physically and financially. &nbsp;But I loved that Rob was so supportive and soon saw the joy they both got.</div><div><br></div><div>10 years and a house move to the &#39;burbs (with our own small<span style="word-spacing:normal;">&nbsp;field) later, I am homeschooling&nbsp;my children by their choice (boy 14, girl 12 - I want to say &quot;unschooling&quot; but I know that&#39;s more of an ideology that supports me rather than an objective reality but that&#39;s another post...) &nbsp;and Olivia&#39;s pony love is as strong as ever. I have thus far supported her by taking her to the various ponies that she rides, organising and paying for hacks, lessons, and more recently loaning a pony she takes charge of for 3 days a week at the horse yard next door. &nbsp;Up until the loan it was something I supported her in by paying other people to &#39;do pony things&#39; &nbsp;with her, declaring myself fully supportive but still &#39;not into horses myself&#39;. &nbsp;(She has become a good rider but has not much experience in training and the details of &#39;horse care&#39;)</span></div><div><br></div><div>The loan is different, because looking after the pony 3 days a week is HER responsibility, not a paid activity.

I have thus far supported her by taking her to the various ponies that she rides, organising and paying for hacks, lessons, and more recently loaning a pony she takes charge of for 3 days a week at the horse yard next door. &nbsp;Up until the loan it was something I supported her in by paying other people to &#39;do pony things&#39; &nbsp;with her, declaring myself fully supportive but still &#39;not into horses myself&#39;. &nbsp;(She has become a good rider but has not much experience in training and the details of &#39;horse care&#39;)</span></div><div><br></div><div>The loan is different, because looking after the pony 3 days a week is HER responsibility, not a paid activity.

&gt; When I mention the possibility of loaning a more compatible pony instead of buying one, she goes rigid and her eyes well up.  She puts her hands over her ears and says &#39;you just don&#39;t understand mum!&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to ride &#39;difficult&#39; horses for a living.  I also had ponies on loan when I was around your daughter&#39;s age.   I loved those loan ponies :)   The ponies I had on loan were all my responsibility, full time.  If I didn&#39;t go and feed them then they wouldn&#39;t get fed.   No-one else in my family was in the slightest bit horsey.  My mum or my brother would drive me to the stables if it was raining, and would then sit in the car and wait.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I quite understand the situation with the field.  The current loan pony is not at home, but kept at a stables next door?   Would an owned pony be kept in the home field?  If so, this might be easier for all of you.   Personally, I always found other people (like at the riding stables) got in the way of the relationship between me and the horses.  And also knowing that someone else rides &#39;my&#39; pony on other days of the week would have put me off, too ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It might be possible to find the right pony to buy, but agree with the seller to have it on loan for a few weeks before finalising the sale.  That way your daughter would know that this could be her &#39;forever&#39; pony if all goes well, but there would be a trial period where she can make sure that she and the pony are compatible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520681409"><div id="ygrps-yiv-520681409ygrps-yiv-1840526218"><div dir="ltr"><p>This is what I had written in December of 2013, when my older daughter was 3.5 years old and had decided to experience school. This experiment lasted a few months and the best part about it was the school is right across our house!<br></p><p>**********************************<br></p><p> We live in a house surrounded by schools. Disha has, 
over the months, been peeking out of our living room window watching the
 day-to-day proceeding of the school in front of our house. Sometimes, 
she would spend long minutes looking outside, sometimes she would run 
outside, sit on the stone by the side of the school playground and 
observe.</p>
<p>She has friends who attend the school. Over time, she has been seeing
 them going everyday, in uniform to sit in classrooms with teachers. She
 has been pretending to be a teacher or a student and playing with 
friends using the black board and chalk. One morning, about a month 
back, Disha, announced that she is going to the school. So she packed 
her bag, went to the classroom where her friend was and sat next to him.
 She spent two hours on the first day and came back home. Soon, it 
became an every day thing. Each day she went on her own, stayed for 
longer. After 4-5 days, she took a break to hang around at home and 
spent sometime with me reading, drawing and playing. But was back at 
school the next day.</p>
<p>Every morning she wakes up asking if it is time to go to school and 
she is off. Breakfast is just something to be had in as minimal time as 
possible. She helps packing her lunch and school bag.</p>
<p>I used to take Disha along for any errands, meetings or field work. 
But she has been consistently refusing to come with me, so I have had to
 leave her at school to get all my work done. Yesterday was the first 
time I left her at school for 6 hours. We have friends staying over at 
our place, so I knew that in case she came home, she would find someone 
who would offer her food or anything else she needs. I also informed our
 neighbors and the teacher that I will not be available. Most importantly Disha was totally ok with me taking time off! <br></p>
<p>Disha, did come home and went to use the bathroom. After that she 
told our friend that she wanted to go back to school and went right 
back. She did not even look for me!</p>
<p>It was an organic progression for Disha to end up at school. She is 
there as long as she wants. If she gets bored or overwhelmed, she comes 
back home. At times she goes back, other times, she is content just 
staying with me and doing something together. On some other days, she is
 tired so she comes home, has her lunch and naps. Sometimes, she spends 
the entire day at school. She comes home singing some song, her teacher 
sang in school. Yesterday she came back home in 20 mins, saying that her
 teacher did not come today so she did not want her to go to school. One
 of the days, she came home and told me how a teacher yelled at her. I 
went, spoke to the teacher and explained how Disha expects to be treated
 with respect. Maybe the teacher is not used to a parent coming and 
telling her something like this or she understood, she was willing to 
change her tone to be less intimidating.</p>
<p>When I filled out her school admission form, I spoke to the principal
 and told her that Disha would go to the school on her own terms. For 
which the principal heartily agreed and so did the nursery teacher. I 
was initially apprehensive and disappointed, thinking- so much for 
homeschooling! But did not stop her from doing what she wanted. She 
clearly enjoys being at school and since our home is right across, she 
freely comes and goes.</p><p>********************************************</p><p>This lasted for a few months- from November of 2013 to April of 2014 after which the school closed down for vacation. The next school year she told me in no uncertain terms that she did not want to go to school anymore as her nursery teacher had quit and also her friend had moved to the next class. She did not like the teacher (nor did I, I thought she was quite scary!). But for the longest of time she spoke about her nursery teacher and still remembers her  quite fondly at times.<br></p><div class="ygrps-yiv-520681409ygrps-yiv-1840526218gmail_extra"><br clear="all"><div><div class="ygrps-yiv-520681409ygrps-yiv-1840526218gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div>Cheers,</div><div>Chetana</div></div></div></div>

I’m guessing you’re in India or somewhere, then.<br/>
<br/>
This can’t happen in an American public school.  Maybe in a private schoo, but probably not then, either.  :-)<br/>
A visitor to a school these days (here) needs paperwork, waivers, permissions….  OR more likely, just wouldn’t be allowed.<br/>
<br/>
I think it’s cool that your daughter was able to infiltrate, and visit. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid in the 1960’s, we could take visitors with us to school just for asking and getting permission from the teacher, and they said yes to visiting cousins or travelling-family friends.  Many years have passed since then, and the fear of lawsuits is bigger, and the responsibilities of teachers (and teacher union safeguards) change things, too.  <br/>
<br/>
So in the U.S., at least, and maybe in other places, a child needs to fully enroll, to try school out.<br/>

Holly visited a classroom with her friend twice in a small town in England when we visited in 2000.  Holly was eight, and they used her as an interesting show-and-tell element.
