<div id="ygrps-yiv-522598341">This might not be needed by you yourself (whoever&#39;s reading this) but  <br/>
you might have a friend who could use it!<br/>
<br/>
I was writing about the healing that can come of unschooling (for the  <br/>
book I&#39;m working on and should still be working on) and the last line  <br/>
I wrote in that section was<br/>
&quot;When I soothe my child, I soothe myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I figured you guys shouldn&#39;t need to wait until September for  <br/>
something that useful, so there.  Happy Keith-Dodd&#39;s birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot Keith&#39;s birthday for the first time ever.  Luckily, Holly  <br/>
didn&#39;t.  She called Keith and made a dinner plan and so now he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
need ot know I forgot, except I didn&#39;t say anything when we woke up,  <br/>
and he probably knows I would&#39;ve if I had remembered it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few times, years back, thought July 5 was his birthday and  <br/>
said something early, but I&#39;ve never gotten halfway through the 6th  <br/>
and had to be told by someone else.  eeep!<br/>
<br/>
When I soothe myself, I soothe myself. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, that wasn&#39;t the quote...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I soothe my child, I soothe myself.<br/>
<br/>
(And it might work for anyone in your life, and not just a child.)<br/>
