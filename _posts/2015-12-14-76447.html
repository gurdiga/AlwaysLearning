The reason they give is not the genuine reason. Living in fear is helpful for no one. Live joyfully, pay attention to the people doing good in the world, not the people doing bad. For your kids to have a clear, rational, hope-filled picture of the current global situation, you need to have one too. <br><br>&quot;</span><span style="font-size:12.8px;">We are leaving for a flight followed by a cruise next week and I would like to prep everyone in case something did happen. Is that a bad idea?&quot;<br><br>Yes, it&#39;s a very bad idea! What on earth would you say to prep children for the possibility of a terror attack that wouldn&#39;t completely terrify them? And what would be the point? What would you hope to achieve? No one can be prepared for a terror attack - that&#39;s the point of them. But, I would like to ask you, do you prepare your children for the possibility of death every time you get in a car? Because that has a far, far higher risk than terrorism does. Maybe don&#39;t take them to Syria right now, but there are a million things that are more likely to cause them harm in any other country than a terrorist attack, and I assume you don&#39;t fill their heads up with all the awful things that might happen to them in any other situation, so why the one thing that is least likely to happen and the randomness of which is likely to cause the most fear?<br><br>&quot;</span><span style="font-size:12.8px;">I am not sure whether or not we should talk about the attacks.&quot;<br><br>We&#39;ve talked about them because my children asked. We talked about not living in fear. We talked about what must happen to a person to make them capable of such violence. We talked about the use of religion as an excuse for violence and how damaging that is to those who are genuinely religious. We talked about ideas about God and Allah and the Buddha. We talked about peace and joy and love and all the wonderful people who help when bad things happen. We talked about the doctor in the attacks who did CPR on one of the terrorists. We talked about gratitude for our lives and our relative safety. We talked about refugees and how they manage to maintain hope against all odds. We *only* talked about what they wanted to talk about but, most importantly, we did it with an energy of peace and love and hope, not one of fear and &#39;what if&#39;s. <br><br>Clare</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-386028106gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-386028106gmail_quote">On 14 December 2015 at 20:54, Megan Valnes <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:meganvalnes@...">meganvalnes@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-386028106gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

That sounds kind of nuts to me. The possibility of that happening is minuscule.

That’s too harsh.<br/>
It’s too personal, and it’s not fair.<br/>
<br/>
Mothers DO worry and imagine how they would deal with difficulties.  <br/>
<br/>
The question was asked because she knew she was thinking about it, so let’s discuss the moon, not the finger.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You could, maybe, have a general chat about staying close to parents when travelling, and maybe give them each a label with phone numbers as was discussed on another travelling thread here recently - but that&#39;s more about safe travel generally.

<br/>
These ideas are good, and work in lots of situations.  Helping children be prepared for what might happen is wonderfully good.  There are places they need to be quieter (hospitals, libraries, funerals) and places they can run, and things they need to dress up for and things they need to wear clothes that can get paint or clay on them.   Preparing them for frightening and unlikely situations should (I think) be handled in very general terms.  Putting fright into every child because one in many miillions might be hurt is too much fear and damage to peace and good sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this, and I would wait until they asked, or it came up otherwise.<br/>

<br/>
I was looking at a cruise page recently—I don’t even remember why, but I ended up there.  One cruise warned about the danger of pirates, and discussed how to safely store and protect valuables to limit losses.  THAT was spooky, but I wasn’t going, so it didn’t advance to “scary.”<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136472059"><span style="">My</span><span style="font-size:small;"> children don&#39;t ever see news because we use DVDs or Amazon. I have purposely not discussed terrorism or mass shootings with them because I have not wanted them to have to think about it at their age. </span><div><br></div><div>However I was just visiting the Statue of Liberty with my children ages 3, 5, and 7 and their 10 year old friend. While we were there the topic of terrorism came up. This experience made me think I should have had a discussion with my 7 year old about terrorism prior to it coming up unexpectedly. <div><br></div><div>My seven year old didn&#39;t understand why there were signs about no explosives being allowed on the ferry and he had a lot of questions about security. (We went to the Statue of Liberty last year and none of my children asked about anything.) At first he was making jokes and even said, &quot;Do they think someone might blow up the Statue of Liberty!&quot; He thought this sounded so ridiculous and absurd. His 10 year old friend started talking to him about terrorism. At that point he asked, &quot;What is a terrorist?&quot; I pulled him aside at that point and had a quick talk.  We had a longer talk later at home without my younger children. </div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m not sure exactly when the right time is to tell children about horrible things that are going on in the world. I was not prepared for the questions when they came up. I think you should try to gauge your children&#39;s possible concern or interest. Maybe it is just best to think about and prepare yourself for a conversation about terrorism if your children ask or experience things that bring up the topic. </div><div><br></div><div>I think it is important to make sure children are aware of their surroundings. My kids always ask me questions when they see something that appears unusual. I always tell them when we are in large crowds to stay close so I won&#39;t lose them. It has gotten to be a joke at this point. I also tell them that most people in the world are nice, but some people are not so they should never go away with a person they don&#39;t know. These are very general and if you are just generally concerned about safety they might work. </div><div><br></div><div>Hope</div><br><div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> On Tuesday, December 15, 2015, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85548417">we just got back from a trip around Europe (we live in the US) and we left shortly after the attack in Paris.  <br/>
I said absolutely nothing to my 4 year old about terrorist attacks.  We talked about finding a person in a uniform if she ever gets lost, and now that she&#39;s old enough to talk to people and tell them my full name, I don&#39;t bother to pin my contact information to her shirt, which I did when traveling with her when she was younger.  Her dad and I talked (without her) about where we might not go in case other events happened, but it was smooth sailing and totally enjoyable.<br/>
the whole point of terrorism is to catch indefensible people off-guard.  it&#39;s meant to be terrifying so I can&#39;t think of any way to &quot;prepare&quot; a child without causing undue stress.  General emergency and travel safety would suffice. <br/>
in my opinion, worry is only useful if it leads you to a plan that relieves stress.  worry about terrorism is wasted energy.  let go of what&#39;s out of your control and enjoy your trip!<br/>

That didn’t happen, but the thought scared me. As I looked around I couldn’t find one police officer (or any other person of uniform), but I could easily find moms or nannys with children; they were everywhere.

We took a trip to NYC when my children were 5 and 3 and while riding on the subway I had one of those worst possible scenarios run through my mind and imagined what would I do if my 3 year old stepped off the subway and the doors closed and I was whooshed off to the next stop without him. That didn’t happen, but the thought scared me. As I looked around I couldn’t find one police officer (or any other person of uniform), but I could easily find moms or nannys with children; they were everywhere. That observation comforted me to no end that day. I kept seeing children and caretakers everywhere I looked, but not police officers. I also imagined that my children would be more comfortable asking another mother for help than approaching an officer. From then, that’s what we’ve talked to our kids about doing if we are somewhere with lots of other people and they get lost.</div><p></p>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
But rather than TELL them to be nervous about uniformed personnel, it would be better to say “If you can’t find a mom with children, find someone who works there.”<br/>
<br/>
Here the scary place to be lost is the state fair.  But there are uniformed personnel, with guards’ unforms or with bright-colored safety vests, and kids can find them easily.  <br/>
<br/>
Practicing with kids to say the parent’s names instead of “mom and dad” is helpful and it can be done in fun, funny ways.  We used to play “what’s my name” with toddlers for that purpose, and for fun.  The first time Kirby said his dad’s name he said “Teef Doonvald.”   It was for “Keith / Gunwaldt.”  We were somewhere with friends from the SCA and in a normal (not-medieval-event) setting, it’s fairly common for people to refer to the others as “Jeff/Artan” or such so that if the hearers know them by only one name or the other they’re still identifiable.<br/>
<br/>
So “Doonvald” wouldn’t have been very helpful and it was good for him to say “Keith Dodd” and “Sandra Dodd” well enough that others could understand him, but the one time he did get lost, they announced that a little boy was lost and his name was….  Tirby?”  So I thought having their names and ours, and phone numbers, on cloth, was a good idea after that. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015250486">I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever sat down and discussed terrorism with the kids, but they&#39;re aware that bad people sometimes do bad things. Our family has driven over Hoover dam several times on vacation and had to stop to get the contents of the SUV&#39;s roof rack inspected. We briefly explained why (&quot;to show them that we&#39;re not lunatics with a bomb&quot;), but since we&#39;d spent the whole morning talking about the bomb testing in other parts of the desert we were more focused on asking the kids to please not talk about bombs in front of the nice men who were about to look in our car. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seven or eight years ago, there was a local incident where pipe bombs were being found under cars.  If I remember right, no one was seriously injured but there were also some big unrelated fires at local businesses and and it was a scary time. I remember taking my daughter to karate and hearing that there had been an explosion a couple of hours earlier (detonated by the police, but we didn&#39;t know that at the time) and a fire that people assumed was caused by one of the bombs. It turned out that the man planting the bombs lived -very- close to us and worked with my husband. (The guy wanted to kill his wife and decided to throw off suspicion by blowing up some random strangers, too. Luckily, he didn&#39;t yet know how to actually make a bomb that would work.)  The kids heard a lot about it at church and at the knitting guild and grocery store and once we found out the real details, they heard more at home. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, my daughter&#39;s karate instructor has addressed a couple of mall shootings in a matter of fact way -- take cover, move away from the violence if you can and worry about finding your parents later.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s never been a big discussion about terrorism, it&#39;s just come up a bit at a time. We talk about where to meet up if we get separated, write phone numbers on wrist bands at events, have a backup plan of who to call if I&#39;m not responding on my phone.  But none of that is because of terrorism. It&#39;s because things happen and little boys can zig when Mommy zags or phones can break when a kid is supposed to call with a pickup location.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I Lost my littlest one at the zoo a few years back and went into an absolute panic. He noticed that we weren&#39;t there and found some guys doing construction work on one of the buildings and told them he was lost. By the time I&#39;d found a zoo employee to report him missing, he was trotting down the path holding hands with a security guard and had given them his full name and my full name and had solved the problem himself. I wouldn&#39;t have suggested looking for the busy guys with power tools, but they had radios and it worked. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the kids are developing problem solving skills by being there when we solve problems and those will be good whatever weird thing happens along the way. <br/>
