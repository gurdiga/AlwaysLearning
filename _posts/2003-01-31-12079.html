&lt;&lt; Ok I don&#39;t have a good answer. But in my house the unschooler would not <br/>
 even ask me for help. They would take care of it themselves and only <br/>
 draw me in if they hit a major problem---like an explosion or major <br/>
 breakage of something. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was my first thought too.<br/>
They&#39;d get up and change it of course...duh!! But that doesn&#39;t make a very <br/>
good joke....sigh<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
