this may be something my sons would enjoy but don&#39;t really want to take the <br/>

My 12 year old son just started designing his own website.  In fact, he is at <br/>
the library with his dad getting more books right now.  He read HTML for <br/>
Dummies and has decided he is not a dummy any more!<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to email you about the server we chose -very cheap- and how <br/>
to start a site.  Or better yet, the kids could email each other :-)<br/>
<br/>
You often get some web space with your Internet provider, so I would check if <br/>
you have some space already with your name on it.<br/>
<br/>
I would give you facts now, but I have 2 homeschool families who decided last <br/>
night to drive into town for visit and are on their way.  They are also old <br/>
friends of another homeschooling family we decided we must invite over as a <br/>
surprise.  So there are 16 people do to arrive and my mother-in-law called <br/>
and is on her way a few days early! My MIL is a retired public school teacher <br/>
who is not a fan of homeschooling, and cannot understand &quot;unschooling&quot; at <br/>
all!  This should fun &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son is so excited about doing his own web page-and it&#39;s about books!  He <br/>
would love to share web sites he found that guide you through the process too.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if we can help.  <br/>
I am new to the list.  <br/>
Hi!  My name is Susan, in CA, mom to 9yog, 11yog, 12yob<br/>

You&#39;re having a homeschooling convention at your house!!!  Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list.<br/>
<br/>
About webpages and me: <br/>
I&#39;ve had free pages before on Angelfire and Expage (the expage pages are <br/>
still there, because they can&#39;t be deleted), but I moved the information to a <br/>
paid-for space I think I&#39;m paying $12 a month for, on GeoCities.   My <br/>
personal maze starts at sandradodd.com and when I see other people&#39;s <br/>
super-organized websites I think maybe I should redesign mine! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084287702">I&#39;ve made a number of Websites - i.e., somewhere around fifty - although I <br/>
don&#39;t keep most of them up anymore. I have yet to pay for a single one.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very easy to make a site, you can just go to a site like AngelFire or <br/>
GeoCities (Geocities is my personal fave, but AngelFire&#39;s lately gotten <br/>
better and more usable). They have templates set up if you have NO idea how <br/>
to do anything with HTML - or you can just put the HTML directly into pages. <br/>
Geocities, at least, is very easy to understand and navigate.<br/>
<br/>
I used to use AOLpress, a what-you-see-is-what-you-get style HTML editor, but <br/>
since taking an Introduction to HTML class, I now just type HTML in by hand. <br/>
But AOLpress is very good, and free to download from the Internet (although <br/>
I&#39;m not sure where - I can&#39;t remember the URL) if you don&#39;t want to bother <br/>
with raw code.<br/>
<br/>
A website does not have to cost money, although if you want a domain name, <br/>
then that does. I don&#39;t have one, though I think it&#39;d be cool to get one - <br/>
but I don&#39;t want to put all my sites together, as they&#39;re all very seperate <br/>
(sites on Harry Potter, on the musical Cats, the musical RENT, on dragons, on <br/>
my HTML class even - lots and lots of different subjects!) and I don&#39;t want <br/>
them hooked together into one mass site.<br/>
<br/>
I hope something out of this slightly incoherent ramble helps. :)<br/>

it save often. (It has a very good recovery feature as long as you open your<br/>
files from AOLPress and not by double clicking on the file itself which<br/>
leaves you with nothing :-/)<br/>

I was able to learn HTML just by revising the code it writes. You know what<br/>
the code is doing since you can see it right on the screen so it isn&#39;t that<br/>
hard to pick up the language from there.<br/>

I paid money to avoid the pop-up ads that expage had.  They were to the point <br/>
where you got two separate windows, and an obnoxious flashing banner TOO.  So <br/>
I could get a domain name for the same price as the avoidance of ads for <br/>
shocking the monkey and dating services.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, expage doesn&#39;t let you delete your pages.  They say if a page <br/>
isn&#39;t accessed for a month it will be deleted.   That&#39;s not true. I had some <br/>
I had totally forgotten about and they&#39;re still there.  But those google <br/>
finds might never dissolve.  So I changed all the internal links to the <br/>
geocities/sandradodd pages, and eventually, perhaps, google will show the new <br/>
pages first.<br/>
