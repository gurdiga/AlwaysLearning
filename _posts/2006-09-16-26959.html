<br/>
Dear Sandra<br/>
Thank you for your inspiring website. My eldest child is 4 and I  <br/>
don&#39;t want<br/>
to put him in school. I too was also a teacher and read The Lives of<br/>
Children, How Children Learn, Summerhill and so on. So no dilemmas  <br/>
there...<br/>
but I do have one problem I wondered if you had thoughts on.<br/>
My background is French-speaking, and I&#39;ve instinctively always spoken<br/>
French to my son. Now, however, he&#39;s rejecting it in favour of English,<br/>
understandably, since we live in [large city where people speak  <br/>
English] and all his friends speak English.<br/>
It&#39;s getting to a point where he talks to his dad (in English) and stays<br/>
pretty silent with me. At best, I speak to him in French, he replies in<br/>
English... but he&#39;s getting less and less able to understand what I say.<br/>
Holidaying in France made no difference.<br/>
Would your instinct be to persist with the French or forget it and  <br/>
put our<br/>
relationship first so we have good chats in the language he prefers  <br/>
right<br/>
now?<br/>
My sister says she gave up on the bilingual thing for similar reasons  <br/>
with<br/>
her children, but she regrets it because now her children only know one<br/>
language.<br/>
I&#39;d be interested to have your reaction to this problem.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Relationship first, no question.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of language is communication, and if your communication  <br/>
is failing...<br/>
<br/>
-=-My sister says she gave up on the bilingual thing for similar  <br/>

<br/>
If her goal was to produce bilingual children without consideration  <br/>
for their happiness or their personal relationship, then it would  <br/>
have made sense.<br/>
<br/>
If you know what you want, then decisionmaking becomes easy.<br/>
<br/>
If your child is more important than your vision of your child, life  <br/>
becomes easier. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to take your question the the response to the  <br/>
AlwaysLearning list but I won&#39;t identify you.  I much prefer group  <br/>
exposure to one-on-one.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Those might help.  Maybe you&#39;re feeling you &quot;have to&quot; speak French  <br/>
because you can, or that he &quot;has to&quot; be bilingual because the  <br/>
opportunity is there.  It might help for you to cast the thinking  <br/>
more in terms of &quot;choose to,&quot; and I hope you won&#39;t choose to maintain  <br/>
a separation for the sake of an ideal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My SIL is fluent in Spanish but English is her native language.  When  <br/>
my son was<br/>
born 15.5 yrs ago I asked her to consider speaking only Spanish to  <br/>
him so that he could be<br/>
exposed and maybe learn some Spanish via his relationship with her.   <br/>
She agreed<br/>
to my request but that plan quickly went by the wayside.  She  <br/>
explained to me that<br/>
she thinks and feels in English and her strong emotions for her  <br/>
nephew could not<br/>
be expressed easily in Spanish.  I understood.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-forward 15 yrs.  She has two children of her own now and I asked  <br/>
her awhile<br/>
back if she speaks Spanish with her babies much.  She said they play  <br/>
with<br/>
speaking Spanish but she can&#39;t relate well as their mother using  <br/>
Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the boy, who is immersed in English, thinks and feels in  <br/>
English and<br/>
this is why he has difficulty relating to his French-speaking-only  <br/>
mother?  I agree<br/>
with your advice.  How sad it would be to have a barrier in the  <br/>
relationship that<br/>
could be avoided if the mother is able to relate to her son in his  <br/>
native language.<br/>

compromising advice like, try reading to him in French or putting<br/>

that I would be sad to give up the French as I put effort and goodwill<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Give up the French&quot; seems too strong a statement.<br/>
<br/>
Another too-strong way to look at it might be the you would be  <br/>
requiring him to speak French in order to speak to you, which makes  <br/>
French more important to you than he is.  Also maybe a little like  <br/>
withholding food from an animal being trained to do tricks, so he&#39;ll  <br/>
be hungry enough for the rewards.  Some parents do that with their  <br/>
kids and food.  &quot;It will spoil your appetite&quot; mostly means &quot;You won&#39;t  <br/>
be hungry enough to eat all the food I tell you to eat, the way I  <br/>
want you to eat it...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if instead of thinking of it as &quot;just let go,&quot; it can be to  <br/>
tone down.  Maybe after he trusts you lots, and likes you lots, you  <br/>
can go spend more time in France, or some other French-speaking  <br/>
place.  Maybe he will love it because you love it, because the  <br/>
relationship between you will be so good.<br/>
<br/>
There are unschooling families in France with small children.   <br/>
There&#39;s a new group forming up in Paris.  There are a couple of more  <br/>
established families near Switzerland.  Maybe you could go for an  <br/>
overnight or weekend visit and hanging around those kids he might  <br/>
speak French.<br/>

books, movies, for instance, then by all means listen, read, watch. <br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with persuing your own passions, as long as <br/>
you aren&#39;t foisting them off on your family. If they want to be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595716248">Sylvie Martin, who has translated several of my articles into French,  <br/>
wrote to say that I overstated the existence of unschooling in France  <br/>
or Switzerland.  There are families working on attachment parenting,  <br/>
but one unschooling family is having legal trouble, and others are  <br/>
compromising one way or another, the children are pre-school-age, or  <br/>
they&#39;re controlling of TV, computer, food, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So I should rephrase.<br/>
There are families in France corresponding in French about these  <br/>
kinds of issues but there aren&#39;t yet any experienced, successful  <br/>
unschooling families to visit or look to there.<br/>
<br/>
Sylvie is very focussed on respect for children and choices, but has  <br/>
contact with people who are unwilling to allow children choices about  <br/>
everyday things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have the same kinds of people in the U.S.  who are unschooling  <br/>
BUT... no plastic toys, no TV, no internet, no character t-shirts or  <br/>
cartoon sheets, no commercial anything, no sugar, no violent toys, no  <br/>
competitive or contact  sports (I don&#39;t now anyone who forbids ALL of  <br/>
those, but know some who avoid some or several)...<br/>
<br/>
TV seems to be the biggest point of disagreement.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have painted a rosier picture than I should have.<br/>
Still, I think some will get there before long.  Lots are reading  <br/>
about this, and as more unschoolers grow to adulthood, the objections  <br/>
will be fewer.<br/>

He&#39;s usually doing something else at the same time and, of course, he  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe tell him that while he&#39;s waiting to feel comfortable about  <br/>
being written about, many other children are UNcomfortable because  <br/>
they haven&#39;t read the right turn of phrase, the right testimonial,  <br/>
that will let them loosen up about how they treat their children.<br/>
<br/>
If everyone waited until their kids were grown to share what&#39;s going  <br/>
on in their own houses, there would be many fewer unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
Probably my kids were used to their lives being shared because of La  <br/>
Leche League.  When you&#39;re nursing one and dealing with an older one  <br/>
in front of everyone who came to learn, it can&#39;t HELP but be talked  <br/>
about and seen, and the gradual day-by-day change from that to  <br/>
unschooling, which still involved several of the same kids, never  <br/>
presented a time to discuss whether it was okay for me to share.   <br/>
That was the result and cost of being where all those other kids  <br/>
were--the other parents DID know details of everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
For me, saying &quot;Holly watches the Simpsons&quot; isn&#39;t like discussing  <br/>
biological functions between consenting adults, or that involve  <br/>
flushing afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty had his Big Porn Adventure, I talked to him about whether  <br/>
I could share that because it could be something people would razz  <br/>
him about, but he knew there were other kids who might have gotten  <br/>
in  huge trouble, and that it could help them for me to describe how  <br/>
it had been handled here.  He agreed without hesitation, because  <br/>
other sharings in the past had never hurt him but had definitely  <br/>
helped other people.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, there are personalities and prior agreements or  <br/>
conditioning.  Someone having lived a private life might not want to  <br/>
share all of a sudden, but my kids never lived privately from the  <br/>
beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Still, when two people share an experience that&#39;s not illegal,  <br/>
immoral or of a personal sexual nature, where it will not risk a  <br/>
marriage and everyone has been honest (maybe that&#39;s qualified  <br/>
enough)... then it doesn&#39;t belong to just one of them.<br/>
<br/>
My experiences with my children are MY experiences as much as theirs.<br/>

<br/>
Quoting and replying to myself...  Sorry.  After I hit send, though,  <br/>
I remembered years back when someone from a little philosophy/ <br/>
movement called  TCS, Taking Children Seriously, came to  <br/>
unschooling.com to discuss it but told us all we were disrespectful  <br/>
to our children because we were telling stories about them.<br/>
<br/>
So she was more respectful to her children, because she totally  <br/>
refused to even say whether she had any, but only to discuss the  <br/>
philosophies ideals and rules (or however they wanted to describe the  <br/>
beliefs).<br/>
<br/>
So lots of us were telling stories of how situations turned out when  <br/>
children&#39;s needs and ideas and wishes were treated respectfully, and  <br/>
she declared it &quot;not respect.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We couldn&#39;t being to say &quot;Oh, cool, then let&#39;s do what YOU do because  <br/>
your children are so much more... wait... how old are your children?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t say. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I just take my children and leave them at a hotel where there  <br/>
are a few hundred other unschoolers and then I go home and sleep in  <br/>
my own bed.  Or at least I did a few nights last week.  Other people  <br/>
can share experiences about my kids without asking them in advance too.<br/>

******************************* Thank you Sandra. I&#39;m not very optimist this time... :-( Sometimes, I feel like it will never happen.. The french mentality is special with the children.. And the government declared war to homeschoolers.. So, you can imagine if they know about unschooling... :-(<br/>

<br/>
At first it was a few hippie-commune families, or isolated families.<br/>
<br/>
There was always one homeschooling curriculum advertised, Calvert,  <br/>
since I can remember, in the 1950&#39;s and always after.   Americans  <br/>
living abroad used it, or kids who were bedridden I guess.  Sick kids.<br/>
<br/>
In the 1970&#39;s John Holt started a newsletter for home schooling  <br/>
families who were fans of his writing, so they could communicate and  <br/>
he could share his new ideas, and that was Growing Without  <br/>
Schooling.  It became more like a magazine, but it was never fancy  <br/>
with advertisements, though John Holt started selling things through  <br/>
that, so if it was an ad, it was an ad for the office where it was  <br/>
produced, and they were selling John Holt&#39;s books, and a few other  <br/>
books, games?, pamphlets, a beginning piano course (different from  <br/>
traditional piano books).   Some of those things are sold here now:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/authors/John_Holt.htm">http://www.fun-books.com/authors/John_Holt.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
So for the liberal/intellectual side of it, John Holt and his  <br/>
writings were the source and inspiration for lots of unschoolers.    <br/>
His ideas were reinforced and expanded by contact with  people he  <br/>
knew and worked with in New Mexico and Colorado, though, who were  <br/>
doing alternative school stuff in the late 60&#39;s and maybe early 70&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So separately, politically, lots of Christian churches started  <br/>
becoming more and more angry that public schools weren&#39;t pushing a  <br/>
Christian agenda, and their split with public schools was about the  <br/>
schools teaching too much--too much about equality of races and  <br/>
sexes, too much sex education, too much history of evolution, too  <br/>
many reading assignments in which the characters weren&#39;t behaving as  <br/>
they wanted their children, as Christians, to behave.  If they  <br/>
couldn&#39;t control the schools, they would pull their children out.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t know the details of why they started using a curriculum at home  <br/>
instead of making private schools, but they did.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a whole church would pressure their people to homeschool,  <br/>
with the same curriculum. Someone three houses up from me when my  <br/>
kids were little went to just such a church in Albuquerque.  The men  <br/>
were pressed to declare that their wive would homeschool, with one  <br/>
certain curriculum.   Undoubtedly, someone was getting a free  <br/>
curriculum for his own family by putting that pressure.  Then the  <br/>
other moms would help each other out with homeschooling, sometimes  <br/>
like a co-op, and they would have science fairs and geography  <br/>
competitions and spelling bees.  I say &quot;would have&quot; because I&#39;m still  <br/>
thinking about Cindy&#39;s family, in the early 1990&#39;s.    It&#39;s still  <br/>
happening.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom didn&#39;t want to homeschool her kids, she was told she needed  <br/>
to be obedient to her husband and to God.<br/>
<br/>
Those folks were also told that Christians had invented homeschooling  <br/>
because God wanted them to, so there was odd hostility and curiosity  <br/>
about &quot;secular homeschoolers.&quot;  I was asked more than once why I  <br/>
would homeschool if I didn&#39;t have to, and why a non-Christian would  <br/>
homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
There were LOTS of them, and that kept the government from picking on  <br/>
the much lesser number of secular homeschoolers and unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The split remains, with lots of families in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
The sin of the unschoolers is no structure, no tests, no competitive  <br/>
spirit, no help to add to statistics that &quot;prove homeschoolers do  <br/>
better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The sin of the other extreme is that their science is Bible-based,  <br/>
watered down not-really science.  Their history is re-written the way  <br/>
they wish it had happened, they don&#39;t teach &quot;multi-culturalism&quot; in  <br/>
states where it&#39;s a required part of the curriculum.  They  <br/>
concentrate on math facts, reading and writing. They teach to the  <br/>
test hoping that high scores will keep government agencies from  <br/>
looking any more closely at their overall program.<br/>
<br/>
If John Holt was the rallying point for liberal secular types, the  <br/>
HSLDA is the rallying point for the Christians and conservatives.   <br/>
It&#39;s a group of lawyers making a LOT of money off of putting fear  <br/>
into homeschooling families and then taking protection money from them.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re 35 years or so into it here.  It&#39;s not smooth.  This list is  <br/>
smooth. &lt;g&gt;  The overall world of homeschooling in the U.S. is pretty  <br/>
crazy!<br/>
<br/>
I try to ignore all that back story and keep my own children&#39;s lives  <br/>
busy and happy and safe.  It doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know all that and  <br/>
appreciate it.  Growing Without Schooling Magazine used to be the  <br/>
biggest support in my world when Kirby was five and six and seven  <br/>
years old, when one of my support families moved a thousand miles  <br/>
away and another moved thirty miles away and our babysitting co-op  <br/>
broke up partly over that and partly over a sexual misconduct  <br/>
incident among the kids.   About that time, e-mail came along and  <br/>
there were user groups (vaguely like message boards today), and  <br/>
homeschoolers could contact other homeschoolers any day of the week  <br/>
to discuss things and help each other.  Soon there were proper  <br/>
message boards and within a few years, web pages.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone reading this could get more information about homeschooling   <br/>
in the next hour from your computer than anyone could have gotten in  <br/>
a year when I started.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-440583573">We gave up the Farsi for this reason. My kids were not talking to  <br/>
their dad, talking to me, instead. We thought it was interfering with  <br/>
their relationship and he decided to go ahead and speak English to  <br/>
them in order to have better conversations. I don&#39;t know why the  <br/>
bilingual household didn&#39;t work well for us, don&#39;t know if we gave up  <br/>
too soon. The kids do regret it, now, but they take their  <br/>
relationship with their dad for granted and can&#39;t imagine the  <br/>
concerns we had, back then. My husband&#39;s cousin&#39;s kids speak three  <br/>
languages fluently - Farsi, English, and Chinese (actually two  <br/>
Chinese languages). They didn&#39;t ever seem to have a problem switching  <br/>
around, they never resisted, they knew when to speak each language.  <br/>
They are not as articulate or expressive in any language as my kids  <br/>
are in English, though. Also, my oldest is not particular talented at  <br/>
learning languages - seems not to be one of her particular  <br/>
intelligence strengths. If Roxana had been the first, probably she&#39;d  <br/>
have learned both languages effortlessly - she loves learning  <br/>
languages, now, and learns easily.<br/>
<br/>
So - not much advice, some commiseration with your dilemma, and  <br/>
offering the possibility that &quot;it depends on the child,&quot; is the only  <br/>
answer the rest of us might be able to offer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Somewhere along the line Sandra said that &#39;french or no french&#39; are <br/>
not the only choices. Those are the extremes.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely the relationship with your son is most important. If he <br/>
barely communicates with you, then developing closer communication <br/>
with him by speaking English, is the priority. Letting go of wanting <br/>
him to grow up perfectly bilingual -- or even speaking French &quot;fluently&quot;, yes.<br/>
<br/>
But is he negative about French, or is it just that he finds it too <br/>
difficult to talk to you in French? If he&#39;s negative about French <br/>
language and all things French, then a break from such things may <br/>
help you to develop your relationship with him so that he trusts you <br/>
to keep his needs at the forefront.<br/>
<br/>
Surely you would not be *letting go* of all things French? If it is <br/>
your native language, then surely there is some &quot;frenchness&quot; in your <br/>
life. Do you use French in any situations, other than interacting <br/>
with your son? Speak to your family in French? Sing in French? listen <br/>
to French radio or watch French films because *you* want to, not to <br/>
set an example for your son, or because you think you &#39;should&#39; for his sake.<br/>
<br/>
When my children were small, I wanted them to speak Dutch. It&#39;s my <br/>
second language, the only one  I speak fluently, and there are all <br/>
these &quot;advantages&quot; to children growing up bilingual.. I enjoyed it <br/>
for the first 2 years or so. My daughter Nicola spoke more Dutch than <br/>
English. She knew who to speak Dutch to (me) and who to speak English <br/>
to, and I so loved watching the development of the two languages.<br/>
<br/>
Then I got to the point where I realised *I* was avoiding speaking to <br/>
*her*, because of the effort involved in formulating what I wanted to <br/>
say. Not good. We moved to using some Dutch and some English. Dutch <br/>
in the car, very often.<br/>
<br/>
Until my son Felix was about 3, and started reacting very negatively <br/>
to me speaking in a language other than English, presumably because <br/>
he did not understand it well.<br/>
<br/>
Dutch as a means of communication between me and my children went by <br/>
the wayside. My interest in Dutch did not. I still read Dutch books, <br/>
sing to myself in Dutch, talk about what I find fascinating about <br/>
Dutch, stream Dutch radio when I am on the computer, cook Dutch <br/>
speculaas and boterkoek, celebrate Sinterklaas on December 5th etc.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Nicola is now 9. Recently she has started asking me to <br/>
talk to her in Dutch, to tell her how to say something in Dutch, <br/>
wanting to learn it well enough for it to be our &quot;secret language&quot;. <br/>
She *doesn&#39;t* speak it anywhere near fluently, or understand me when <br/>
I speak to her in normal conversational Dutch. But she is interested, <br/>
knows Dutch expresses some ideas differently to English, can <br/>
pronounce it well, and wants to know more. Where it ends up, who <br/>
knows. We&#39;ll follow her interest as far as it goes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all or nothing. It seems to me that as a native speaker you <br/>
would have more &quot;Frenchness&quot; in your life, than I have &quot;dutchness&quot; in <br/>
mine. And unless the very idea of anything French is negative for <br/>
your son, there is no need to give that up, or to assume that your <br/>
son will never want to know more French than he does now. But pursue <br/>
French if *you* want to, for your own sake, not for your son&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>

You had John Holt, in England they had Neill.. We have no one.. No one in France. All our french society is organised against children. <br/>
<br/>
The freedom is only a word, a concept, in fashion. Lots of people here like to say they are unschooling, because de freedom is so beautiful, bla, bla.. Lots of people read Neill &quot;oh, he was wonderful !&quot; bla bla.. But that&#39;s all.. Nothing more than words. <br/>
<br/>
When I speak about TV, it&#39;s a general outcry ! <br/>
<br/>
Some of the people I know say they are unschooling, but no TV, no free food, sometimes they restrict the reading time.. If they have tv, they decide what the children will watch.. And I feel a little depressed sometimes :-(<br/>
<br/>
When you discovered unschooling, this life, did it take a long time before you meet other people with the same feelings, the same understanding of unschooling ? It seems you&#39;re lot of people now, all around the country, and when I read those unschooling lists, it seems to me like there are unschoolers everywhere, even if it&#39;s few in some places, there are unschoolers everywhere. <br/>

I have a second thought about why.<br/>
<br/>
Some people unschool because they wanted to use structure and found  <br/>
that it was causing unhappiness in their families.   Being convinced  <br/>
that school was not an  option, they look for family-enriching  <br/>
options first.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is enriching.<br/>
<br/>
So if, in France, Christian start homeschooling and earn people the  <br/>
right to do that, maybe unschooling can follow on that.  Maybe not,  <br/>
depending how laws are written and interpreted, but it&#39;s possible.<br/>

<br/>
My understanding (which is limited) of the French problem with homeschooling is that if the Christians started doing it homeschooling would be doomed to failure. There is a real sense that homeschooling is a cult issue in France. The law states (from what I can quickly find) that parents can homeschool if they do so for religious reasons. But because of some law (I can&#39;t find the specific one, it came at the same time as the About-Picard Law) homeschooling has to be very clearly not done for &quot;cultish&quot; religious reasons. And cults tend to include evangelical groups within the French definition. It seems to me that it is the evangelicals that have moved homeschooling into the mainstream in the U.S.(it is less so in the UK, where it seems to have been less about religious freedom than about personal choice). Or at least pushed the numbers up enough to form HSLDA and Patrick Henry (unaccredited, no hand holding, certainly no kissing) college. And it may help to have public awareness be such that people see it as a viable alternative even if they aren&#39;t Christians for them to choose not only to homeschool but to also unschool. <br/>

<br/>
My BIG problem with people who want to say &quot;We don&#39;t homeschool, we  <br/>
UNschool&quot; is that contrary to some comment in People Magazine,  <br/>
unschooling is NOT &quot;legal in all 50 states.&quot;  Homeschooling is legal  <br/>
in all 50 states, with different definitions in each state.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a way to homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody does anyone a favor by trying to twist it otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a way to apply the kinds of open-classroom research  <br/>
and practice of the 60&#39;s, which was already described by Holt, and  <br/>
Neill, and if a family understands that well enough to describe it in  <br/>
their paperwork, and SAY &quot;we&#39;re using alternative &#39;open classroom&#39;  <br/>
methods&quot; then that&#39;s one thing.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to say &quot;I don&#39;t make them do anything,&quot; or &quot;No,  <br/>
we&#39;re not homeschooling,&quot; then they are asking for trouble, and  <br/>
trouble can range all the way to a court order saying &quot;Put your  <br/>
children in school&quot; or to removal of the children from the home.<br/>
<br/>
There was some case (homeschooling, not unschooling I think) years  <br/>
back where a family didn&#39;t want to what... report?  Test?   <br/>
Something.  So the went along with jail and separation from their  <br/>
children over THAT.<br/>
<br/>
For me, being with my children is first.  If I had to put them in  <br/>
school to continue to live with them, I&#39;d do it.  But I don&#39;t have  <br/>
to.  I can go along with laws where I live (or choose judiciously not  <br/>
to [oooh... freudian use of &quot;judicious]), but to flaunt my beliefs in  <br/>
the face of a social worker or state official would be irresponsible  <br/>
and CRUEL to my children.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to make a big political play, wait until your own  <br/>
children are too old to be removed from the home, or get your  <br/>
childless school-wounded activist friends to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t want to do the work to really READ things Holt  <br/>
actually wrote, and to totally and fully and internally understand  <br/>
WHY learning works.  They want to just kind of ride the coattails of  <br/>
people they see in peripheral vision and say, &quot;Well they&#39;re not in  <br/>
trouble, so I&#39;ll do some vague watered down version of it and we  <br/>
won&#39;t be in trouble either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I were to be brought into court, I could talk a lot about natural  <br/>
learning.<br/>
If someone whose participation in discussions consists of things  <br/>
like  &quot;I think bringing up science is manipulative so I won&#39;t do it.&quot;  <br/>
or  &quot;I think strewing is stupid, and you can&#39;t make me&quot; is brought to  <br/>
court, what will SHE say?  &quot;Well Sandra&#39;s doing it.&quot;???<br/>
<br/>
Maybe part of the oddity (this might should be on the unschooling as  <br/>
process topic; I&#39;m assuming everyone on this list is reading every  <br/>
word  of every topic &lt;g&gt;) is that in much of everyday life, one  <br/>
becomes a thing by signing up for a group and attending a meeting.   <br/>
In is in.  It does not work that way with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One can become a girl scout or a member of the ladies&#39; auxiliary of  <br/>
some church or club or start going to AA, and say &quot;I am a girl scout,  <br/>
a member of the altar society, and I go to AA meetings.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, one isn&#39;t an unschooler until unschooling is  <br/>
happening.  Some have written on a forum or a list for over a year  <br/>
and still hasn&#39;t taken the kids out of school.  There&#39;s no membership  <br/>
card, or dues, and joining a list doesn&#39;t make one an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Wanting to unschool doesn&#39;t make one an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve seen three or four arguments (e-mail today, not on the  <br/>
list, and some on unschooling.info) that it&#39;s possible for the mom to  <br/>
be unschooling even if the dad doesn&#39;t agree.  It&#39;s not possible for  <br/>
that to last very long or be healthy or not lead to divorce.  If the  <br/>
mom can&#39;t even convince the dad, she&#39;ll lose like a dog in  court.   <br/>
And speaking of court, if the dad isn&#39;t convinced and the mom  <br/>
continues anyway, that can lead to divorce which can lead to court- <br/>
ordered school.<br/>
<br/>
Priorities.<br/>
People need to know what their priorities are.<br/>
<br/>
If staying with kids at home is a priority, an intact marriage is  <br/>
important (or whatever supports a non-married mom).<br/>
<br/>
With divorce you get court orders or signed compromise agreements,  <br/>
and custody problems.<br/>
With divorce you also might eventually get the new girlfriend or the  <br/>
step mom.  You might get the new boyfriend or the step dad.  If TWO  <br/>
people can&#39;t agree on how your kids should be treated, how will three  <br/>
or four agree?   They will not.<br/>
<br/>
I could say more.  Probably will.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
