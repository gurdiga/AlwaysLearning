 </span></blockquote>Thank you. I know of just the three of us, Brenda, Leslie, and me, who are <br/>
quite uncomfortable with the situation--because it&#39;s a family issue that hits <br/>
VERY close to home. I can assure you that Brenda, Leslie, and I would be the <br/>
three MOST opposed to war, but because our situations (husbands in the <br/>
military), the subject is difficult to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for avoiding the topic (we get enough of it at home!).<br/>
