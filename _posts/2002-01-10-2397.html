<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513063065">I  have about decided that we are the lone unschoolers anywhere inside of 10<br/>
counties.  We joined a support group that is highly structured.  Everything<br/>
the kids did was completely organized by an adult with lots of rules, age<br/>
segregation, etc..  I was less than thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody is very aware that we are unschoolers and I have made several<br/>
friends with the more eclectic, semi-structured families.  Last week, I had<br/>
a brainstorm.  The newsletter is always advertising classes.  I advertised<br/>
&quot;recess&quot;.  I described it as a free-form, free-play, multi-age activity so<br/>
the kids could just spend time with their friends.  The newsletter doesn&#39;t<br/>
come out for a couple of weeks, so we will see if I get any response.<br/>

HOW PERFECT!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to let that percolate tonight while I&#39;m sleeping.  I hope I have <br/>
great recess dreams!<br/>

Great idea! A friend just e-mailed me a couple of days ago about her idea of posting an invitation to an &quot;Unschooler&#39;s Day of Chaos&quot; in our area. We&#39;re brainstorming ways to make it absolutely clear that no one is going to be running anything, or edgycatin&#39; anyone at our fun days. (So folks aren&#39;t disappointed that we just like to have fun.)<br/>

Thank you for this excellent idea. Even if the local newsletter is too<br/>
uptight to consider this, it&#39;s still good for posting in libraries and<br/>
supermarkets and such.<br/>

Some kids might take it as an invitation to be irritating.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;Day of Frolic&quot; would be better.  The connotations of &quot;chaos&quot; are too <br/>
dark and vandalistic for most people (even me, I think).<br/>
<br/>
And one of the titles (damn it) of Satan is &quot;Lord of Chaos,&quot; so it might be <br/>
good to veer off in advance and go with another term.<br/>

That&#39;s a lovely name, thanks. Although chaos I like too. <br/>
