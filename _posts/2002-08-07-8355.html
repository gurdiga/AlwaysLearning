<div id="ygrps-yiv-830182533">We had a fun week with a visiting kid.  <br/>
Last Thursday we drove to Florence, about a hundred miles from us, to<br/>
pick up Dylan&#39;s friend Jared.  Jared&#39;s mom and I have known each other<br/>
since fifth grade and Jared and Dylan have known each other since they<br/>
were four and six.  <br/>
They are ten and twelve now, and still share a passion for Godzilla.   I<br/>
never knew two people who could talk so long and so much about Japanese<br/>
monsters.<br/>
<br/>
On Friday we went to Butte to the Japanese museum there.  It&#39;s just a<br/>
small historical account of a Japanese settlement in Montana in the<br/>
1800&#39;s.  No Godzilla, but still interesting.  We went to the World Museum<br/>
of Mining, and looked into the Berkley Pit, a huge open pit copper mine,<br/>
which was compared to the size of a Godzilla foot print,  the volcano<br/>
Godzilla fell into, the impact crater of a space ship that came to kidnap<br/>
Godzilla, etc. We went to the Mineral Museum and ate lunch and had fun.<br/>
  <br/>
Saturday there was a remote controlled Jet air show here and the boys<br/>
were hugely enthralled.  The planes were amazing, expensive too, and the<br/>
guys who were flying them were seriously goofy.  I had no idea remote<br/>
controlled planes were so big, the largest had a wing span of ten feet. <br/>
You could strap a squirrel in that sucker and swoosh!  ( I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
really, I&#39;m vegan... or does that just mean I wouldn&#39;t eat him after his<br/>
little heart gave out?)<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we went on a picnic.  Jared hadn&#39;t been on one all summer and they<br/>
found a big log across the river and zipped over and back all day like<br/>
mountain goats.  They swam, played, cut willows sticks to roast tofu dogs<br/>
(yes, there really are such things)  ate ALL of the chocolate cake!! <br/>
They looked for fish and frogs, fed chipmunks, played Godzilla games,<br/>
built a big fire and poked it, a lot.  We went in the morning and came<br/>
home in the dark and they were so tired and dirty and smelled of<br/>
campfire. <br/>
 <br/>
We all lazed around Monday and watched movies and played games and walked<br/>
to the store for popsicles.  <br/>
Jared left yesterday and it seems so quiet here.   We&#39;re going swimming<br/>
to take our mind off the missing boy, and there&#39;s a karate class later<br/>
today. <br/>

going to sleep out in the yard and watch the meteor shower, have a party<br/>
for the karate kid on Wednesday, and join a small mammal ecology class<br/>
Saturday for a field trip to Moulton Reservoir.  In between we&#39;re going<br/>
to make more cake, and eat it too!<br/>
Come on over!  It&#39;s nice an cool in Montana right now...<br/>

I feel like we do nothing at all. For the last week its been well over <br/>
100F in Virginia with high humidity so we&#39;ve been staying in with <br/>
the a/c. The boys spend ALL day on the Playstation.<br/>
Everytime I suggest something its either too hot or they don&#39;t feel <br/>
like it or they don&#39;t want to leave the playstation :-(<br/>
I have managed to persuade them to camp with me on  Delaware <br/>
beach for the meteor shower next week. You can&#39;t really see it this <br/>
close to DC cos the sky is always hazy.<br/>
<br/>
I have managaed to book the Live n Learn conf in SC so while we&#39;re <br/>
there we&#39;ll see Fort Sumter. Mind you, they know nothing about the <br/>
civil war. Perhaps this will trigger an interest :-)<br/>
<br/>
I want more unschoolers close by.Come on, there must be <br/>
someone within 30 miles of DC!<br/>

Try &quot;Smart Dogs&quot; they&#39;re better.  And if you cook them over a campfire<br/>
and burn the whale snot out of them well, heck, they could be anything<br/>
after that.  Folks will eat most things cooked outside, have you<br/>
noticed??<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
