<div id="ygrps-yiv-523915997">Please help me with ideas that might help this mom.  I&#39;m quoting from  <br/>
e-mail, and I&#39;m really hoping for ideas to soothe, repair, brainstorm...<br/>
The mom isn&#39;t on this list but I&#39;ve invited her own.   If she wants  <br/>
to quietly read that&#39;s fine, and if she wants to say &quot;Hi, that&#39;s me!&quot;  <br/>
that&#39;s okay too; either way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- I�m so stressed I can�t think!  I have a 14 year old daughter,  <br/>
and I could really use some advice!!  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Her daughter is an only child and they live in the southeastern U.S.<br/>
We can call her &quot;Rachel&#39;s mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***************************<br/>
I guess basically it&#39;s just seeing my daughter, Rachel, spend so much  <br/>
time pining for her boyfriend and not much else.  I love her  <br/>
boyfriend a lot.  He and Rachel have a great time together.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
think the relationship between the two of them is bad at all.  But  <br/>
he&#39;s from one of those military-like, southern Bible belt, slave  <br/>
driving, &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; families.  His mom barks  <br/>
her orders and expects my daughter to obey them.  She literally  <br/>
screams at Rachel and her boyfriend.  She puts them both down all the  <br/>
time.  She wields Rachel like a weapon against her boyfriend  <br/>
threatening to force him to break up with her if they don&#39;t do what  <br/>
she says, and they have to do it to perfection.  Rachel has walked  <br/>
their dogs, painted rooms in their house, cleaned up their yard, fed  <br/>
their horses, cleaned their horses stalls, done their laundry, taken  <br/>
care of their 2 year old twins, and probably a lot more that I don&#39;t  <br/>
know about.  She never pays Rachel for anything or offers anything in  <br/>
return for all the work.  She doesn&#39;t even feed Rachel when she&#39;s at  <br/>
their house.  If they get hungry at his house, Rachel&#39;s boyfriend has  <br/>
to order a pizza or take Rachel out somewhere to eat.  Rachel has  <br/>
even called me from a restaurant asking me for my credit card number  <br/>
when her boyfriend&#39;s mom failed to show up to take them out to eat as  <br/>
a thank you for something extra they did.  I see Rachel wilting  <br/>
before my eyes.  Our family is not like that at all.  My own mom was  <br/>
a hippie unschool mom, and Rachel is a second generation unschooler.   <br/>
I&#39;m so surprised that she will respond to such disrespect when she  <br/>
has no obligation whatsoever to do anything this lady says.  But she  <br/>
knows that her boyfriend will not be allowed to see her if his mom  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like her, so she does it all.  Also, I&#39;m finding myself doing  <br/>
things according to his mom too, because I know how much Rachel and  <br/>
her boyfriend mean to each other.  I know that if his mom feels like  <br/>
we&#39;re &quot;heathens&quot; she will never let him see Rachel.  I&#39;ve never been  <br/>
made to feel so low before.  It&#39;s not like me to even worry about  <br/>
that.  This lady is reaching into my home and wreaking havoc.  I feel  <br/>
like we&#39;re being terrorized.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to handle it at all.  We&#39;ve always lived so  <br/>
naturally and peacefully together.  I don&#39;t have &quot;requirements&quot; that  <br/>
she has to fulfill in order to be allowed to live in her own house.   <br/>
For the first time in Rachel&#39;s life I&#39;m tempted to force something.   <br/>
I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;d be forcing, and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;d even  <br/>
respond to such a thing coming from me, but Rachel hasn&#39;t done  <br/>
anything at all in the past 3 months unless she&#39;s with her  <br/>
boyfriend.  She&#39;s one of those musician, dancer, artist, poet types.   <br/>
I think she&#39;s so talented in so many things.  It looks to me like  <br/>
she&#39;s just wasting away.  I don&#39;t want her to be involved with this  <br/>
abusive family, but I do want her to be able to stay with her  <br/>
boyfriend.  I&#39;m not going to tell her she has to break up with him  <br/>
like his mom threatens all the time.  I want her to connect with  <br/>
other unschoolers, but I don&#39;t really know any.  We have lots of  <br/>
homeschooling families around us, but they all think unschooling is  <br/>
evil.<br/>
   He he.  (seriously, they really do).  They&#39;re not exactly my  <br/>
biggest fans.<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it.<br/>
I would be glad to share any of this with anybody.  Any counsel would  <br/>
be great!  The more the merrier!<br/>
*****************************<br/>
<br/>
My response to her was this:<br/>
<br/>
++++++++++<br/>
I have ideas about the larger problem, but I&#39;d rather take this to  <br/>
the AlwaysLearning list, I think.   I&#39;m thinking of some specific  <br/>
people who might be able to help you there.<br/>
<br/>
I think this might possibly help you to think about her mental state  <br/>
in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com">http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Read the intro post and then poke around there.  It&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve  <br/>
written or quoted.<br/>
+++++++++++<br/>
<br/>
The reason I recommended that until I got a chance to put this here  <br/>
is that if a girl is in love, that would explain the appearance that  <br/>
she does nothing when she&#39;s not with the boy and that she seems to be  <br/>
wasting away.<br/>
<br/>
But what practical advice might help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788513551">I don&#39;t have any fun- or success-filled advice ... just the irresponsible<br/>
idea to run like hell away from the woman.  However I live in the<br/>
southeastern US and the culture gives almost airtight support to the<br/>
boyfriend&#39;s militaristic mom not the daughter&#39;s unschooly mom.  Even if you<br/>
can run and hide, you still need a way to eat and survive.<br/>
<br/>
Obey is a word that engulfs love and makes its power almost nil, or<br/>
destructive, depending on which side of it you&#39;re on.  And since we&#39;re<br/>
talking about love which is, like Sandra points out, biochemical, all you<br/>
add is fear of disobedience, fear of reprisal, fear for each other&#39;s safety,<br/>
to get emprisonment of spirits all around.  Iron wings is what a friend of<br/>
mine calls it.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t say, but I&#39;m assuming the boyfriend is about 14 too.<br/>
<br/>
There have been stories of quiet pacts to wait until reaching majority age<br/>
to have a life you want to live rather than depending on someone&#39;s favor or<br/>
even dependability.  That&#39;s an age old idea.  Depends on the situation.  The<br/>
bad thing about that is it would stink.  The good thing about it is it would<br/>
be a choice the sweethearts could make together, rather than having their<br/>
love used against them.  Well and there&#39;s another good thing about that...<br/>
their love could not only become their own but also remain sweet and<br/>
uncorrupted by the boyfriend&#39;s mom.<br/>

The<br/>
bad thing about that is it would stink. -=-<br/>
<br/>
(Anonymom, Rachel&#39;s Mom, if you choose not to out yourself, maybe  <br/>
answer these questions on the side in e-mail.)<br/>
<br/>
Do they have internet contact?  Phone?  Text?  Can they have romance  <br/>
without physical proximity part of the time?<br/>
<br/>
How does she get to the boy&#39;s house?   (Partly I&#39;m curious, partly  <br/>
wondering about logistics.)<br/>
<br/>
Where did they meet?  (Ditto; logistics, principles.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My strongest thought was &quot;detachment.&quot;   If the daughter can handle  <br/>
it, let that be her choice.   Holly has hung out with some families  <br/>
with a bunch of rules and nonsense and she chose to be around it  <br/>
because the reward was worth it.  Also, honestly, she was kinda  <br/>
curious about such families, and she learned a LOT.  If Rachel knows  <br/>
the ins and outs of the boyfriend&#39;s family, that gives her power for  <br/>
the future.  If she stays with him, they can&#39;t claim the relationship  <br/>
between mother and son, mother and whoever-all, was other than it  <br/>
was.  If she doesn&#39;t, she&#39;ll know what kind of mother she does not  <br/>
want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I assume my children will be alarmed or upset by a  <br/>
situation and they&#39;re not.  It&#39;s my own history that causes alarms to  <br/>
go off in me.  They&#39;re calmer than I ever was at their ages.  They&#39;re  <br/>
more realistic.  They have a strong sense of self.   They&#39;re not very  <br/>
vulnerable, at all.  Perhaps Rachel has that advantage too, and maybe  <br/>
she&#39;s actually kinda having fun in the situation to some extent.   <br/>
Like a difficult game or puzzle.  Depending how she is at  <br/>
interpersonal business, she might be having a LOT of fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018741503">I want to know why they are spending so much time at his house? Why  <br/>
doesn&#39;t he do his work and take off - go to her house to spend their  <br/>
free time? It seems odd for her to be choosing to be over there  <br/>
working like that - there must be something I&#39;m not understanding.  <br/>
Does the mother not let the kid out of the house so that the girl has  <br/>
to go work with him in order to spend time with him at all? How did  <br/>
they meet and get to know each other?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090315382">Maybe one of the biggest things Rachel needs is a listening ear until such a<br/>
time comes when she can have more control over the situation without the<br/>
fear of losing her boyfriend?  The email doesn&#39;t mention much about how much<br/>
Rachel talks about her feelings around the situation, but maybe finding<br/>
someone (who isn&#39;t her mum - sometimes difficult talking to the most<br/>
approachable mums about your feelings about boyfriends I think!) who will<br/>
just sit and listen and not try to find solutions or make platitudes etc. -<br/>
maybe even someone trained in listening skills.  Not necessarily a<br/>
counsellor, just someone with enough training to give Rachel the space to<br/>
let off steam and work out a solution for herself that would be helpful (if<br/>
there is a solution at all...).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358260106">My oldest child is 5, so I guess I&#39;m thinking of this more from<br/>
remembering being that age than parental experience, so with that<br/>
caveat...<br/>
<br/>
I would talk to the daughter about strategy.  It seems as though the<br/>
mother is asking a lot of her, more than she seems comfortable with...<br/>
is there anything I can do to help?  The other mom does things totally<br/>
differently, but I think she would respect the things that she does.<br/>
Rules.  Authority.  The other mom would probably respect my parental<br/>
dictates, so are there any that would be helpful?  Would it be helpful<br/>
if there were some rules we came up with (how late to stay out, how<br/>
much time she can spend there, etc.) that would help her deal with the<br/>
mom without negatively affecting things with her boyfriend?  Can she<br/>
send me a text message when things are getting a little hairy to let<br/>
me know that a call from mom insisting that she come home now is<br/>
desired?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am imagining the situation as just trying to tolerate her<br/>
for now until the boyfriend is no longer under her control.  This<br/>
solution isn&#39;t the most open and honest one, but it didn&#39;t sound as<br/>
though an open honest relationship with his mom was something that was<br/>
going to work terribly well.<br/>

&gt; that.  This lady is reaching into my home and wreaking havoc.  I feel<br/>
&gt; like we&#39;re being terrorized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to handle it at all.  We&#39;ve always lived so<br/>
&gt; naturally and peacefully together.  I don&#39;t have &quot;requirements&quot; that<br/>
&gt; she has to fulfill in order to be allowed to live in her own house.<br/>
&gt; For the first time in Rachel&#39;s life I&#39;m tempted to force something.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;d be forcing, and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;d even<br/>
&gt; respond to such a thing coming from me, but Rachel hasn&#39;t done<br/>
&gt; anything at all in the past 3 months unless she&#39;s with her<br/>
&gt; boyfriend.  She&#39;s one of those musician, dancer, artist, poet types.<br/>
&gt; I think she&#39;s so talented in so many things.  It looks to me like<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s just wasting away.  I don&#39;t want her to be involved with this<br/>
&gt; abusive family, but I do want her to be able to stay with her<br/>
&gt; boyfriend.  I&#39;m not going to tell her she has to break up with him<br/>
&gt; like his mom threatens all the time.  I want her to connect with<br/>
&gt; other unschoolers, but I don&#39;t really know any.  We have lots of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling families around us, but they all think unschooling is<br/>
&gt; evil.<br/>
&gt;   He he.  (seriously, they really do).  They&#39;re not exactly my<br/>
&gt; biggest fans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So there you have it.<br/>
&gt; I would be glad to share any of this with anybody.  Any counsel would<br/>
&gt; be great!  The more the merrier!<br/>
&gt; *****************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My response to her was this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ++++++++++<br/>
&gt; I have ideas about the larger problem, but I&#39;d rather take this to<br/>
&gt; the AlwaysLearning list, I think.   I&#39;m thinking of some specific<br/>
&gt; people who might be able to help you there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think this might possibly help you to think about her mental state<br/>
&gt; in the meantime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com">http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Read the intro post and then poke around there.  It&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; written or quoted.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason I recommended that until I got a chance to put this here<br/>
&gt; is that if a girl is in love, that would explain the appearance that<br/>
&gt; she does nothing when she&#39;s not with the boy and that she seems to be<br/>
&gt; wasting away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But what practical advice might help?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

more important to stand firmly in what you believe, because what you<br/>
believe is respectful and your daughter will have a place to go for<br/>
comfort and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t make the other mother behave differently, but you can send a<br/>
clear message that says that you are not the one who is making these<br/>
destructive decisions.  If the other mother decides to try to eliminate<br/>
the relationship, you can make it clear that it had nothing to do with<br/>
you.  It could be a catalyst for change as well.  Some kids will fold<br/>
under that kind of pressure and some will rebel.  You won&#39;t be the one<br/>
ending the relationship, kids aren&#39;t stupid, they WILL know who supports<br/>
them and who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When the father of Chamille&#39;s best friend decided that Chamille was<br/>
&quot;bad&quot; and started routinely grounding his daughter from her, both girls<br/>
knew that it wasn&#39;t Chamille or me that was doing it or causing it. <br/>
They both know it was and is him.  He hasn&#39;t made a good impression on<br/>
either of his kids through his decisions.  His children hate him. <br/>
Chamille doesn&#39;t like him either.  While it&#39;s not really a popularity<br/>
contest, it does feel good to be the nice parent, the patient and kind<br/>
parent, the one that my daughter and her friend can talk to, not the one<br/>
they run from.</div>

What a terrible and difficult situation. I am so sorry for all involved. I will try and brainstorm some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
Can the mom offer to let the boyfriend move in with them? <br/>
<br/>
Can Rachel&#39;s mom get involved and help out with the boyfriend&#39;s family (maybe watch the two year old twins) to support Rachel?<br/>
<br/>
Can she talk to Rachel about her concerns and about how abusive she sees the mother as being and let Rachel problem solve?<br/>

Can she join our list and vent and then feel supported? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244217450">I&#39;m Rachel&#39;s mom, Chrisi Lewis.  Thank you so much for helping me! <br/>
<br/>
I drive Rachel to her boyfriend, Trai&#39;s house and pick her up when <br/>
she calls.  I try to take him to our house as much as I can too <br/>
though.  They met at a homeschool co-op type thing that meets for <br/>
classes once a week.  Rachel wanted to take an art class she saw they <br/>
were offering and he was taking a full load of academics.  <br/>
<br/>
They do have cell phones and texting.  He calls her as much as he <br/>
can.  She&#39;s not allowed to call him, because his mom thinks it&#39;s <br/>
innapropriate for a girl to call a boy.  His mom keeps his cell phone <br/>
in her pocket, and he has to ask permission to make a call.  She does <br/>
make him take it with him when he&#39;s working outside, so he will sneak <br/>
calls during those times.  He has to erase the call records so she <br/>
won&#39;t know.  Internet communication is easier, because he does this <br/>
online high school which requires him to be logged on for at least 4 <br/>
hours a day.  They set up a blog called &quot;Have a Little Lamb&quot; (Rachel <br/>
means lamb), and they communicate through that.  They also made a <br/>
myspace page under the name &quot;Traichel&quot; that they use.  But his mom <br/>
looks over his shoulder, so it can be a little tricky.  And, like the <br/>
phone calls, he has to remember to delete the record of those <br/>
websites from the history so she won&#39;t find them.  <br/>
<br/>
Could you explain a little more of what you mean by detachment?  That <br/>
sounded interesting, but I&#39;m not sure I understood what you were <br/>
getting at. <br/>
<br/>
As far as this being a puzzle, I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way.  That <br/>
could be.  But she&#39;s very upset a lot of the time.  I think the <br/>
twilight zone feeling she gets from being at his house is getting to <br/>
her and making her forget who she is.  She seems disoriented a lot, <br/>
and she doesn&#39;t leave my side.  She is even sleeping in my room again <br/>
like she did when she was little.  She&#39;s always been very strong, but <br/>
she seems to have become a shadow of herself.  I also hadn&#39;t thought <br/>
about my own history contributing to how stressed I am about the <br/>
whole thing.  I&#39;m glad you mentioned that.<br/>

Who she is is changing and will keep changing.  Don&#39;t hold her to  <br/>
what she was.  If she&#39;s changing, let her.  If she tries on some  <br/>
other behaviors and thoughts and doesn&#39;t like them, they won&#39;t have  <br/>
changed her.<br/>

Don&#39;t experience her emotions.  Keep yourself whole and centered and  <br/>
strong so when she comes home she has someone strong and who&#39;s not  <br/>
also being swayed and buffetted by the situation with the other family.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t let the other mom&#39;s actions affect you YOU are.   You can be  <br/>
your own happy self and be a haven of peace for her and the  <br/>
boyfriend, or you can fall into the emotional roller coaster and make  <br/>
a tense situation worse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440309851">The fact that she is hanging close to you is great.  I&#39;m glad you can be<br/>
there for her.  Home base is a great thing to have.  :)  So when she&#39;s<br/>
getting a little off-kilter from being at Trai&#39;s, she can get reoriented at<br/>
home with you.<br/>
<br/>
I had written something yesterday and got sidetracked then lost what I&#39;d<br/>
written.  It was about how Karl at 5 is so much more centered than I was at<br/>
any age in my parent&#39;s home.  He gets way more opportunity to make his own<br/>
choices in a day than I had in a year (not kidding).  All this has a<br/>
tremendous stabilizing influence on him all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in my 40s still struggling with baggage and the same relationship<br/>
quandaries you&#39;re concerned about for your daughter.  So is my sister (in<br/>
her mid 50s).  Immediately when I read Rachel&#39;s story, I came up with one<br/>
idea.... which is all that my mind leaped to.  I keep sticking with this<br/>
list and some others, and it&#39;s always amazing how many more ideas there are<br/>
than just one little thing.  It&#39;s great that there&#39;s so much more choice<br/>
than I at first think there is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232439282">I had thought they were 17 but someone else said 14. How old are they? If he is almost 18, offering to rescue him might help. It sounds like such a dreadful, toxic situation. Does the mother drink or physically abuse the kids? Anything that could get her in trouble with child protective services? This sounds like a really difficult situation.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in high school, a friend was being molested by her father. None of our families would even acknowledge that it could be real, except the family of a male friend. She moved in with his family and then was able to track down her older sister (who had left home at 16 for the same reason) and her sister, who was over 18, got custody. It was a happy ending. A female friend and I were upset that our parents wouldn&#39;t let us help because it would have been easier. The family of the male friend really stuck their necks out because we were all 14. Nothing was ever officially done about the father, but the girl was rescued. <br/>
<br/>
I would trust your judgment about keeping your daughter safe. It sounds like she is either more sensitive than most kids, or that this is a really toxic situation, or both. Either way, protecting her needs to come first. Being honest with her about your concerns is probably a good place to start. It would be nice if you could rescue the boy, but you may not be able to. <br/>
<br/>
I may be totally overreacting because of my friend&#39;s situation, so take this in context but I keep thinking of the expression &quot;there&#39;s no smoke without fire.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I have been letting Rachel know my concerns, and we&#39;ve also talked <br/>
about rescuing Trai.  He&#39;s only 14, though, so I would have to report <br/>
his mom to the authorities and let them investigate her while he went <br/>
to a foster home.  I don&#39;t know if that would be better for him or <br/>
not.  I do know that Trai&#39;s mom was investigated about 3 years ago.  <br/>
I have heard that she pushes him down their stairs if he&#39;s not moving <br/>
fast enough for her, and that she throws things at him.  Also, he <br/>
hurt his hip a year ago and has had a lot of pain and trouble moving <br/>
it since then.  His friend&#39;s family took him to a chiropractor who <br/>
took x-rays of it and found that it had been way out of place so long <br/>
that muscle had actually grown around it.  It&#39;s stuck in the wrong <br/>
position now.  In order to fix it he would have to have surgery to <br/>
cut the muscle and put the hip back where it belongs.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure that not ever getting his hip looked at would be neglect. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a combination of this being a very toxic situation and <br/>
Rachel being sensitive.  Rachel is one of those musician, artist, <br/>
dancer, poet types, and I think she is more sensitive than other <br/>
people. <br/>

As for tacitly supporting this by not telling on the kids... why on<br/>

her (she knows about all this because her daughter told her) to<br/>
support the other parent&#39;s controlling behavior which she disagrees<br/>
with.  If she thought it was wrong to communicate secretly, I guess<br/>
she could tell her daughter that she thinks they shouldn&#39;t lie to the<br/>

<br/>
Which is why a lot of words are spent on this and similar unschooling lists on how to build <br/>
relationships with your kids. Control of kids is an illusion. If kids feel we&#39;re standing <br/>
between them and what they want, do parents really think kids will give up? What we, in <br/>
effect do by trying to control them, is create a reason for them to become defiant and lie <br/>
and sneak behind our backs.<br/>
<br/>
And, really, should kids (people) give up when there&#39;s an obstacle between them and what <br/>
they want? We cheer the heros in stories for sticking by their values and goals despite the <br/>
odds. We ground kids and call them rotten for doing the same.<br/>
<br/>
Just because we believe we&#39;re right, doesn&#39;t give us the right to impose that on others. <br/>
*Every* dictator has believed he&#39;s right. As unschoolers we have the opportunity to model <br/>
better methods than dictatorship.<br/>
<br/>
We have the opportunity to build relationships with our kids so when they have something <br/>
they want they know they can come to us and we can help them find ways to get it in safe <br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** I made a mistake of allowing my daughter on you-tube. Phone calls started, from boys <br/>
way older than her, and she&#39;s not even close to be allowed to date. **<br/>
<br/>
My 17 yo daughter has been &quot;on&quot; YouTube for a while (watching lots, uploading a few <br/>
things). She isn&#39;t receiving calls from boys, younger or older.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something more going on. Where are they getting her number? Why does she want <br/>
to give her phone number out? It&#39;s not YouTube that&#39;s dangerous. It&#39;s unmet needs and no <br/>
safe, supportive way to meet those needs.<br/>
<br/>
** She started spending all her time on the phone or on the computer. Then the <br/>
rebelliousness began. **<br/>
<br/>
My daughter spends lots of time on the phone and on the computer IMing and keeping in <br/>
touch with through message boards with kids she&#39;s met on the internet without rebelling.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a need to rebel when needs are met.<br/>
<br/>
** She knows about the difficulties both of her parents had to go through, never having as <br/>
many great things as she and her brother have-material things, freedom, 2 parent <br/>
household. **<br/>
<br/>
*Lots* of kids of people who grew up in the depression were told how grateful they should <br/>
feel for all they have. It&#39;s a really great way to tear relationships down and build <br/>
resentment.<br/>
<br/>
** But all of a sudden, when asked to do her chores, she&#39;d respond with hate and &quot;I feel <br/>
like a slave&quot; (for cleaning her room, doing dishes or feeding the pets). **<br/>
<br/>
If we respond to kids from their point of view rather than the point of view we think they <br/>
should have, we have a much better chance of communicating with them. There&#39;s a reason <br/>
she feels like a slave whether you agree or not. If you approach her from a point of <br/>
understanding, it&#39;s more likely she&#39;ll open up. If you don&#39;t get defensive and tell her she&#39;s <br/>
wrong, if you accept that what you feel is right feels wrong to her, you&#39;ll be able to help <br/>
rather than continuing on the path you&#39;re on.<br/>
<br/>
A really great book is Parent/Teen Breakthrough:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/6e4oge">http://tinyurl.com/6e4oge</a><br/>
<br/>
** Then she stole $60 from us, not even thinking we&#39;d know??? So she lost all her <br/>
privileges-phone, computer, friends. I thinks there&#39;s something inherently wrong with a <br/>
child doing such activities behind a parent&#39;s back, no matter what the parent&#39;s reasoning, <br/>
and having another parent support this! **<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t end up at the point of stealing and lying and rebelliousness because they&#39;re <br/>
teens or because they&#39;re bad. It&#39;s because they have needs that are going unmet. And <br/>
they&#39;re desperately trying to find ways to meet them.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, people do get to the point where they&#39;re &quot;acting out&quot; doing things they don&#39;t <br/>
really want to in order to show their contempt for those who are controlling them.<br/>
<br/>
You do have the chance to repair the relationship. The book will help loads. You&#39;ve gotten <br/>
to the point where you are adversaries. If you are her partner, she doesn&#39;t need to sneak <br/>
and lie.<br/>
<br/>
Being her partner doesn&#39;t mean driving her to meet men she&#39;s met on YouTube. It does <br/>
mean helping her find safe ways to make the connections she&#39;s trying to make.<br/>
<br/>
Control is an illusion. She *can* run away. There&#39;s nothing stopping her. She can run to <br/>
one of the guys she had talked to on the phone because he might give her the illusions <br/>
he&#39;s there to help her. Don&#39;t make her run away to find people who want to help her <br/>
explore what she needs to explore. Be there to help her find safe ways to do it.<br/>

She had to give out her phone number to get phone calls.  The  <br/>
important part of your story needs to start before the idea that you  <br/>
made a mistake and let her on you-tube.<br/>
<br/>
How old is she?<br/>

<br/>
No she didn&#39;t.  She had heard stories, but she has  no real basis for  <br/>
comparison.  She&#39;s not in your head.  Nor should you try to insert  <br/>
your history into her head as a guilt mechanism.<br/>

-=-  Then she stole $60 from us, not even thinking we&#39;d know???  So  <br/>
she lost all her privileges-phone, computer, friends.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What did she need the money for.  If she asked you for money would  <br/>
you have given her any?  Does she get an allowance or have a way to  <br/>
get a job?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Is that helping with your relationship?  Do you think you can really  <br/>
take her friends away from her?  I think you will only  make her long  <br/>
for them more.<br/>
<br/>
How can she feel whole and real and successful at this point without  <br/>
lying to you?  If you win, she loses.<br/>

<br/>
What if a Church of Christ child wanted to learn to play hymns on the  <br/>
piano?  (I&#39;m fishing for examples, but if a principle is going to be  <br/>
considered valid, it needs to cover most-to-all bases.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if a child is being emotionally abused and wants to tell an aunt  <br/>
or uncle?<br/>
<br/>
What if a child is being sexually abused, and no matter what the  <br/>
parent&#39;s reasoning, wants to get help?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if a parent is causing a child to break the law, and the child  <br/>
wants the help of the police?  If the police officer is another  <br/>
parent, should loyalty to other parents prevent  him or her from  <br/>
doing her duty?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine ran away this summer.   He ran from his dad&#39;s house  <br/>
(which he should have done years ago) and was afraid to contact his  <br/>
mom because his dad had assured him that if the mom helped him she  <br/>
would be arrested for violating the court orders.  (They&#39;re separated  <br/>
but not divorced and the dad is tyrannical to all of them.)<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I did was ask Holly to let me leave him a note  <br/>
through MySpace offering my cellphone number and to help.  He didn&#39;t  <br/>
call, but we knew he had read it after a few days and I felt MUCH  <br/>
better, as did his mom.  And we passed a message from his mom saying  <br/>
it had been arranged that he could stay with her, and so he called  <br/>
her and went to her house.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
According to &quot;I thinks there&#39;s something inherently wrong with a  <br/>
child doing such activities behind a parent&#39;s back, no matter what  <br/>
the parent&#39;s reasoning, and having another parent support this!&quot; then  <br/>
both his mom and I were wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Vincent is a good person, but young.  His dad is a mean person, but  <br/>
grown.<br/>

really hard not to be bitter towards him.  It was making all of us<br/>
miserable, it infected our house like a disease.  I had to stop that<br/>
from happening.<br/>
<br/>
I stepped out of the drama.  I don&#39;t talk to that man at all, ever,<br/>
period!  All communication goes through the kids, or sometimes the mom<br/>
or step mom.  I cut him out of the picture.  Yes, he still does yucky<br/>
things, but once I stepped out of all of it, I was able to breathe and<br/>
relax and focus on what was good and happy, which was most definitely<br/>
not him!  Now watching on the sidelines a bit, I can see him spiraling<br/>
out of control, he&#39;s lost the game.  Once your kids hate you, you&#39;ve<br/>
lost, at least that&#39;s how I feel about  it.<br/>
<br/>
One time he accused me of disrespecting his parenting, and I told him he<br/>
was right, that I really had no respect at all for the way he parents,<br/>
and it&#39;s absolutely true.  It felt good to say it!  I love my daughter,<br/>
I respect her choices, I love my daughter&#39;s friend and I feel really<br/>
badly that she has such a horrible father.  If I could, I would change<br/>
it, but I can&#39;t, so I don&#39;t try.  I&#39;m just here, for listening and<br/>
talking and offering advice.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would much rather support a child trying to get what they want than a<br/>
parent who is being mean and controlling.  It is completely natural for<br/>
a child to go behind a parent&#39;s back when the parent has set up rules<br/>
and guidelines in an effort to control that child&#39;s behavior.  It&#39;s<br/>
better to help a child find ways to get what they want in safe and happy<br/>
ways, then strictly forbid it.  Parents set their kids up to defy them<br/>
just to get what they want and need in life.<br/>
<br/>
Kids grow up and meet potential mates, forbidding and controlling a<br/>
natural process seems like a really bad idea.  It has always seemed a<br/>
better idea to help a young person through that process with talking and<br/>
guidance.  All people have reactionary behavior to control and<br/>
manipulation.  A parent simple can&#39;t know how that kind of reaction will<br/>
go, except that it creates division between parent and child when there<br/>
need not be.  Some kids run away or kill themselves or escape through<br/>
drugs and other self destructive behavior, some simply grow up and move<br/>
away and make forced calls on mother&#39;s day or father&#39;s day, some don&#39;t<br/>
even do that.<br/>
<br/>
Kids grow up and do what they want to do regardless of wether the parent<br/>
wants them to or not.  It just seems so much better to go through that<br/>
process in a manner that ends with parent and child still talking and<br/>
friendly.  So all the choices a parent makes in a child&#39;s life should go<br/>
that direction, with the end result being a happy friendly relationship.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a bumper sticker on my van that I ordered through The Natural <br/>
Child Project.  It reads &quot;Children learn respect by example.&quot;  I <br/>
believe this was not a family that modeled respect appropriately for <br/>
their children.  <br/>
<br/>
I know a 16 year old girl who is moving this week to another state to <br/>
live with her dad.  Her mom has driven her away by trying to control <br/>
everything this child does.  This parent belittles this teenager with <br/>
words that make me cringe.  I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s put with being <br/>
treated that way for as long as she has.  This poor girl has been in <br/>
my home sobbing in despair on many occasions.  I have no respect for <br/>
this woman.  I am not suprised that her daughter has absolutely no <br/>
respect for this woman at this time.  Maybe things will change in the <br/>
future, but I doubt it.  Her mom puts all kinds of conditions on her <br/>
love.  <br/>
<br/>
This teenager has hidden many things from her mom and I&#39;ve known <br/>
about some of them.  Had her mother known, she would have used those <br/>
things as more ammunition to hurt this child again and again.  And <br/>
I&#39;m talking about this child&#39;s hopes and dreams.  That just breaks my <br/>
heart that she can&#39;t share her hopes and dreams with her mother.  Her <br/>
mother has her entire life planned out including the type of man (and <br/>
race) her daughter must marry or risk losing her mother&#39;s love.  My <br/>
teenage friend has decided that love isn&#39;t real and isn&#39;t worth <br/>
trying to attain anymore.  <br/>

we are with our kids. We can&#39;t go back in time with new knowledge and change the way we did <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
But for parents with 3 yos who are running off in the stores, or 6 yos who want to ride their <br/>
bikes father than you&#39;re comfortable with, the problems don&#39;t get easier as they get older! <br/>
*Now* is the time to build trust between you. Be their partner in finding safe and respectful ways <br/>
to meet the needs they have. (Post here if you&#39;re having problems seeing ways.)<br/>
<br/>
Be the person they know they can come to when they want help doing something. If you&#39;re being <br/>
mama bear keeping them safe from the big scary world, they *will* get older and big enough to <br/>
push you aside and find ways to get what they want. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *much* easier to build the trust now than to wait until they&#39;ve already decided your reaching <br/>
out to help is just a new tactic to control them. Much easier to help them trust you when it&#39;s <br/>
about finding safe ways to run than when the choices are about sex and drugs.<br/>

&gt; and I could really use some advice!!  -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Her daughter is an only child and they live in the southeastern U.S.<br/>
&gt; We can call her &quot;Rachel&#39;s mom.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***************************<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been away from my computer for a week or so.  Wow!  A lot goes <br/>
 </span></blockquote>on in here just a week!  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank everybody so much for helping me with ideas <br/>
and support.  I am overwhelmed that anyone would take the time to <br/>
talk to me about our situation.  I have been so encouraged and <br/>
empowered by all your advice.  I haven&#39;t felt so supported since, <br/>
well, ever.  Here in the southeast the general attitude toward <br/>
children is that they belong to their parents in a way similar to <br/>
owning pets or property and are supposed to blindly obey their <br/>
parents to the letter.  Period.  No questions asked.  And if they <br/>
delay for a moment, that is considered disobedience, because it makes <br/>
the parents have to repeat themselves, which means the child didn&#39;t <br/>
do what &quot;it&quot; was told in the first place.  Just hearing your replies <br/>
to me and to the mom who thought I was wrong to support my daughter <br/>
and her boyfriend has helped me more than I can even say.  You <br/>
reminded me that I count too and so does Rachel.  I&#39;m morphing back <br/>
into myself slowly but surely.    <br/>
<br/>
To update you on Rachel and Trai&#39;s situation:  <br/>
Not much has changed for Trai, but Rachel has decided to start being <br/>
less available to Trai&#39;s mom.  Yea, Rachel!!  It means seeing Trai <br/>
less, but I&#39;m proud of her for seeing that she doesn&#39;t deserve to be <br/>
treated like that.  Rachel can&#39;t call him, but Trai is very faithful <br/>
about keeping in touch through secret phone calls and the computer on <br/>
the days they don&#39;t get together, and they&#39;re still doing fine.  <br/>
Unfortunately, it has also made Trai&#39;s mom dislike Rachel.  And, of <br/>
course, she&#39;s taking it out on Trai with long lists of jobs for him <br/>
to do on top of the normal chores she makes him do, which are very <br/>
excessive even for a family who believes in chores.  Also, I talked <br/>
to Trai&#39;s mom and asked her if we could come up with a schedule of <br/>
regular times that Trai and Rachel can get together.  She loved that <br/>
because of the almighty s word (schedule), and we came up with 3 days <br/>
a week that they can count on for sure being able to get together.  <br/>
That took some of the desperation out of the relationship for Trai <br/>
and Rachel because they know that they will see each other at least 3 <br/>
times a week.  And maybe more if Trai is very obedient and works hard <br/>
enough for some free time.  His mom actually said that.  Wow, huh?  <br/>
Rachel&#39;s cousin told her that this is a really good way to be able to <br/>
tell that Trai really cares about her.  Look how hard he works just <br/>
to be able to see her.  His life would be a lot easier without her.  <br/>
<br/>
I still haven&#39;t heard of any unschooling conferences.  Does anybody <br/>
know of any?  I have heard of Not Back to School Camp, though.  Does <br/>
anybody know anything about that?  It looks really cool to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for all your support!  You all rock!<br/>

<br/>
Is it (was it ever) really a matter of like or dislike.  Does Trai&#39;s mom<br/>
talk like that about Rachael?  If so, that seems to confuse the issue<br/>
considerably.  Rachael and Trai&#39;s mom are philosophically opposed in some<br/>
important areas.  It may look like, walk like and act like dislike, but<br/>
like/dislike is a moot point to consider because if the philosophy were to<br/>
change to agreement on either side, then the tone of the relationships would<br/>
also change.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For a child with a parent who is that controling, chores don&#39;t really<br/>
matter.  You could pile Mount Everest on his shoulders and if he thought it<br/>
meant he would gain more appreciation or more freedoms or something, it<br/>
could be worth it to him.  It seems to me that Trai&#39;s mom is an uber<br/>
proponent of the carrot/stick approach.  Trai is being &quot;trained&quot; every<br/>
moment he&#39;s in his mom&#39;s home.  He may not have any idea what he thinks<br/>
about Rachael or what he wants, really.  Trai can&#39;t be himself as long as he<br/>
is under his mom&#39;s control.<br/>

next year - September 2009. Another offshoot of Live and Learn!<br/>
<br/>
There are other conferences that include radical unschoolers - Sandra  <br/>
Dodd and I and our families will all be at the Arizona conference in  <br/>
March 2009.<br/>
<br/>
Also some of the other inclusive state conferences have very strong  <br/>
unschooling components - the HSC conference in August every year in  <br/>
Sacramento, for example.<br/>
