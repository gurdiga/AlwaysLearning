Beautiful. :o) Just think of yourself as the Johnny Appleseed of your own <br/>
little piece of the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>_The Botany of Desire_ has a chapter on Johnny and how his story was<br/>
too sanitized by Disney.  Apples in that era weren&#39;t all that good<br/>
for eating - they were used for cider (hard cider at that).<br/>
He also talks about how the Red Delicious apple was started - it<br/>
was a fluke of nature.  A tree started growing that produced good<br/>
apples to eat raw - it hybridized itself from nearby apple trees.  <br/>
There are a number of interesting chapters in that book!<br/>

No Way! You mean Disney actually changed a story to suit their own needs? <br/>
Never! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, doesn&#39;t Johnny Appleseed fall under the heading of Folklore or <br/>
Tall Tales? Knowingly exagerrated over time and generations of telling. I&#39;d <br/>
love to read the real stories, though. Thanks.<br/>
