<div id="ygrps-yiv-234275770">We tried to catch leaves with our butterfly net as the gusty wind blew them<br/>
around us. Try this, the wind is tricky. The kids found mud and made a mud<br/>
target, then painted with mud for awhile. We raked lots of wet colorful fallen<br/>
leaves. Riley and I made bread. Tessa kneaded alot. I made chicken soup. We<br/>
all have runny noses and coughs. We found out it&#39;s difficult to hear cars on<br/>
the road when the wind blows, so we didn&#39;t ride bikes around. Riley mastered<br/>
the pogo stick. He is up in the 100&#39;s now. <br/>
<br/>
I went to my first parent-teacher conference ever. My daughter now has<br/>
official grades on record. I&#39;m still OK with her school experience. She is<br/>
making very good friends with her teacher. She gave a book she bought and read<br/>
as a present to her teacher&#39;s daughter, Somehow Ashley knows she likes pandas.<br/>
I love spontaneous giving and felt proud seeing her send off something she<br/>
bought a day earlier. She doesn&#39;t plan on going to 4th grade next year. She<br/>
will finish this year.. She is liking school mostly and is enjoying the work<br/>
she is responsible for.<br/>
<br/>
 The house is mostly a mess, too small, and piled with our life. It&#39;s warm, 2<br/>
kids are asleep and one reads. She picked up Harry Potter 4 again and is<br/>
hooked. I&#39;ve yet to read it, but will as soon as she drifts off to sleep.<br/>
Technically, we are all home sick and I loved not having to go anywhere today.<br/>
