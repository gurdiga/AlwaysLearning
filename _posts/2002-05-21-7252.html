<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632041826">Someone suggested Aveeno.  You can also use just plain old oatmeal.  When we<br/>
have a rash, we put oatmeal in a cloth and secure it with a rubber band.<br/>
Then hold the bundle under the water and get it good and soaked.  Squeeze<br/>
the oatmeal water out over the itchy areas.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, the oatmeal is dumped in the compost pile and the cloth into the<br/>
laundry.<br/>
