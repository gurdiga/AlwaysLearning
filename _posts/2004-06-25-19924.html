<div id="ygrps-yiv-993432663">Hi Allyson and all -<br/>
I see that you&#39;ve gotten several responses to your post... I&#39;ve read a few of <br/>
them.....I&#39;d like to respond to something in your 1st msg....<br/>
I&#39;m Jane ....<br/>
<br/>
I know that it is very very difficult to watch someone struggle with <br/>
depression.  It can be consuming.  The other person&#39;s happiness becomes a priority.  <br/>
Sometimes there is a tendency to be &#39;overhappy&#39; in hopes that it will spread to <br/>
the depressed person.   It then can be frustrating if the other person <br/>
doesn&#39;t respond.  There can be a whole dynamic around a family member&#39;s depression <br/>
and everyone else&#39;s responses.    Your family has a history of depression and <br/>
probably co-depression or co-dependency - (that&#39;s an assumption based on your <br/>
and your mother&#39;s experiences with depression.)<br/>
<br/>
Re: your message, I want to point out that choosing to &quot;let her live here&quot; <br/>
and &quot;helping her become whole again&quot; are very separate and independent notions.  <br/>
You can do one without the other.  (Actually, I don&#39;t know if you can do the <br/>
latter one) You can also have requirements for her living with you.  You can <br/>
have boundaries for your own involvement in her emotional wellbeing...  <br/>
<br/>
Here are some possibilities that come to my mind....<br/>
# &quot;Mom, I love you so much and I truly am glad for the opportunity for you to <br/>
live with us and be around your grandchild.  However, I have struggled with <br/>
depression in the way you are now and I need to keep my distance from that in <br/>
order not to be sucked down that road again.  I want to be supportive but <br/>
ultimately you are responsible for your own healing.  What ideas do you have for <br/>
moving in that direction?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
# You can talk to your daughter about depression and about possible responses <br/>
when grandma (or anyone!) &#39;overhelps&#39;.... <br/>
<br/>
# Because her depression is having an impact on your family, you can make <br/>
other choices.  You can continue hosting her in the house.  You can require her <br/>
see a doctor/therapist/massage therapist/etc.  You can help her move out so <br/>
that you can be supportive without sacrificing your own sanity.  You can see a <br/>
therapist to help you.<br/>
<br/>
#&quot;Mom, I know life has been hard for you and that you&#39;re so sad.  I&#39;m so <br/>
sorry for that.  I love you so very much and want you to be well.  I&#39;m glad for <br/>
you to live here so that I know that you&#39;re getting healthy food and that you&#39;re <br/>
around people who love you.  You need more than I can give, though, <br/>
emotionally and physically.  Please don&#39;t be afraid of trying something new.  Look <br/>
where the familiar has gotten us!   This is really an opportunity to create new <br/>
things in your life with the help of good medical care and spiritual/emotional <br/>
help.  Let&#39;s let go of the past and look forward to new things.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it, you are NOT responsible for &#39;helping&#39; or &#39;healing&#39; your <br/>
mother.  You cannot make her whole (she already is whole, btw!).  You can offer <br/>
acceptance and information and express your own love and limitations. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Allyson.... Thank you for writing to the group.....<br/>
Jane<br/>
