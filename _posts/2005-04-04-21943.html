<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014706259">Kathryn Baptista presented the sermon at her church today, and used  Thinking <br/>
Sticks to help make her point and to make it more interactive, and to  help <br/>
it last into the coffee-after session.   Cool idea, and  she found a great <br/>
quote which led to the idea too:<br/>
 <br/>
The Greek philosopher Heraclitus wrote, &quot;A wonderful harmony arises from  <br/>
joining together the seemingly unconnected.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
The intro is here:<br/>

 <br/>
and that has a link to the sermon itself<br/>

 <br/>
If it goes onto the church&#39;s website, I&#39;ll probably just change the link to  <br/>
that, but this is quite &#39;get it while it&#39;s hot&#39; for sermon  presentation.   <br/>
 <br/>
I got up this morning, looked at the clock in the kitchen and said my  <br/>
thinking sticks were being discussed in a church near Boston &quot;right about now,&quot;  and <br/>
here on the very same day I can send the text of the sermon.    Cool!!<br/>
 <br/>
(apologies to those who might get this twice, and thanks to Kathryn for  <br/>
thinking of me and sharing this)<br/>

This is so cool!!!  We just recently started going to a UU church and  I <br/>
can&#39;t wait to share this with some of the people we have met.  I printed  it out <br/>
and then found our thinking sticks.<br/>
Kathryn, you rock.  :-)<br/>
