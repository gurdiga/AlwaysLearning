 </span></blockquote>Last year we had lots of games and books and a few handmade items: felted <br/>
hats (Marji & Ren each  got one---they were beautiful!) and one one Anne&#39;s felted <br/>
pouches. Christian Thee donated one of his signed posters from Spoleto. A <br/>
$200 gift certificate from a local photogragher. Sandra donated the original <br/>
puzzle for &quot;Learning on a Truck&quot; and a copy of her David Bowie letter.  We had <br/>
make-up kits and puppets and bags and t-shirts and jewelry and workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Anything goes! The way we do it is to put a bag for each item, so you win <br/>
only what you want. $1/ticket, $3/5, $10/20 or $20/armslength <br/>
(wingspan)---anybody&#39;s arms (Look for a really tall, long-armed, big chested man! &lt;g&gt; Tuck&#39;s <br/>
husband was popular last year! ).<br/>
<br/>
This year---so far---in my hot little hands, we have the lovely quilts & bags <br/>
from Pam G, a silver bracelet from Rue, a backpack, some Usborne workbooks <br/>
(thanks, Amy!), a John Holt book, another silver bracelet from Sante Fe, a tea <br/>
pot, and a puzzle. Some folks have told me they&#39;re bringing other things---but <br/>
that&#39;s what I have now in my dining room/conference office.<br/>
<br/>
Really, almost anything goes. The most popular things last year---among the <br/>
adults--- were the books and handmade items. The kids liked the games and magic <br/>
cards & figures (I put in $40 in for one of the magic card sets---which we <br/>
won, but I could have *bought* it for $20!)<br/>
<br/>
Things don&#39;t have to be expensive or elaborate---just fun and *desirable*!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone that donates an item!<br/>

money to buy his drumset, when he was 7. Three of them did not sell at the <br/>
venues he chose to sell them, and we just ran across them in storage today.  If <br/>
you want one, I&#39;ll ask him if he&#39;s willing to donate it.<br/>
