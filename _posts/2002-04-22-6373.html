<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767999533"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;My dd used to say she wanted to be a vet, until she mentioned that to the<br/>

were her exact words&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I worked as a vet tech at one time.. (my last job, before having kids).. and<br/>
I loved it.  Maybe it was because the practice was a small one..just me and<br/>
the vet and we made a great team. I lived in Denver at that time. I worked<br/>
the desk, developed the x-rays, cleaned the equipment, walked and bathed the<br/>
critters, gave injections, cleaned teeth, assisted with surgury too..   We<br/>
fixed a lot of hips..saw our share of car accidents.. but mostly spays/<br/>
neuters and shots were the mainstay. It was the best job I ever had.. I<br/>
wanted to be a vet when I was a kid..so that&#39;s the closest I ever came. I<br/>
would love to do it again once my kids are older. Of course I live on a<br/>
small farm now and have many critters of my own, so I do play vet a lot<br/>
anyway..LOL!<br/>
