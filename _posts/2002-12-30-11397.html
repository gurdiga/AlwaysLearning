<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775698524">Hello!   I am inspired by Kime to finally introduce myself!  My name is <br/>
Leslie and I met some of you at the conference in SC, except Sandra, of <br/>
course.  (Hope you are feeling better, Sandra!)  I have two children, 6 and 2 <br/>
and have been unschooling since May.  <br/>
<br/>
I love this life.  My family has never been happier.  I am meeting the <br/>
coolest people, the first time since college that I&#39;ve made real friends that <br/>
have similar interests.  I have to quote Elyssa, &quot;I have found my tribe!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is there a secret handshake?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647203573">Hi Ladies,<br/>
Happy New Year!<br/>
New Year, new intro.  I just joined this interesting and friendly group. <br/>
 My name is Lucie (yes  French spelling).  I met Sandra at our HBLN <br/>
conference in Ottawa, Canada.  Hope you are feeling better.  I broke my <br/>
leg a few years back.  I ended up with screws in the ankle (later <br/>
removed) and a plate with 7 screws on my fibula ( there forever). <br/>
 Physiotherapy were most helpful for me.  Also, because I end up <br/>
favoring the good leg, I  developed lower back problem.  Chiropractic <br/>
treatments were most helpful with that.<br/>
I have three sons ages 15,15, and 10. I&#39;m a mother of twins.  My sons <br/>
have never been to school.  I have never really &quot;school&quot;  them either. <br/>
 I prefer the philosophy of educating by providing opportunities, books, <br/>
computers, and other medium access...  After visiting family this <br/>
holiday, I realized even more how different we have become.  For one <br/>
thing , we are happier.  I too have met friends of like mind within the <br/>
home educating community.   It&#39;s a great life!<br/>
Friendship<br/>
Lucie in Canada  <br/>

Was there another Sandra there?<br/>
Because I haven&#39;t been to Ottawa.<br/>
<br/>
Did you go to a conference in Ohio I went to?  That&#39;s the closest I&#39;ve been.  <br/>
I spoke to a small group in Minneapolis once.<br/>
<br/>
I might speak in Saskatchewan at the end of February if they get it together <br/>
to get me a ticket!!<br/>
<br/>
I was at the Toronto airport a couple of times, en route to Bonfield, <br/>
Ontario.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell them to invite me up to Ottawa for a conference!!!<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Lucie --<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to meet you!  I agree with your sentiments.  I&#39;m finding<br/>
unschooling to be a very happy lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s uncomfortable to be around people who believe that taking<br/>
a hard and unhappy path is a morally superior choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish unschooling was contagious.  I&#39;m sure there are kids<br/>
who would like to &quot;catch&quot; it.<br/>

Maybe another speaker quoted you a lot, so you were there in spirit?<br/>
<br/>
If not, &lt;g&gt;, then I&#39;ve got to figure some kind of movie comedy plot<br/>
where a groovy British (but really Canadian) secret agent stole your<br/>
&quot;mojo&quot; and installed it in some kind of Sandra-bot.<br/>

That&#39;s possible.  I was quoted in someone&#39;s talk once, because the text was <br/>
on the internet and I came across it looking for something else, but I don&#39;t <br/>
remember where the talk had been.  And maybe they were passing out <br/>
Certificates of Empowerment and that made me seem kinda there!<br/>

OK, I can rephrase to &quot;almost all the time&quot; or &quot;mostly&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But, I can occasionally feign being thick-skinned or do a &quot;la-la-la, I&#39;m<br/>

Virginia, NC for North Carolina, NY for New York, etc.  The tricky ones are<br/>
AL, AK, AR and AZ (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas and Arizona).  In some cases,<br/>
it&#39;s the first and second letter, in others the first and an unusual<br/>
identifying letter (like in AZ), and some seem designed just to confuse (MO<br/>
for Missouri, MT for Montana?).  I think the only rule the Post Office had<br/>
was to use two letters close to the older standard abbreviations.  And I<br/>
guess Hawaii would rather say &quot;HI&quot; than &quot;HA&quot; &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783402575">Couldn&#39;t use the first and last (MI) because Michigan had it. Michigan could<br/>
have MN because Minnesota had it. Minnesota couldn&#39;t have MA because<br/>
Massachusetts had it.<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t use first and second for the same reason.<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t even use first and third (MS) because Mississippi had it.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, the initial problem was allowing so many states beginning with the<br/>
letter &quot;M&quot; -- if we&#39;d had a few states instead named with Q or X or Z, this<br/>
would never have been a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, unwilling postal freak. ;)<br/>
