Dana prefers to watch Dragon Tales with the SAP mode on, so that she can<br/>
learn spanish.  I would reckon that she ain&#39;t in coma mode trying to<br/>
translate.  Same thing when she watches Baby Story, Zoom, the dessert show<br/>
on FoodTV, or Trading Spaces.<br/>
<br/>
Dana has her own tv in her room, her bestest friend Betsy has all tv access<br/>
as well.  When the two of them are together, tv is an afterthought.  They<br/>
may turn it on because they both love Dragon Tales, but they will be in the<br/>
midst of their fantasy world(it&#39;s a whole elaborate<br/>
Barbie/lego/dolly/lincoln log thingie).<br/>
<br/>
I have been watching an enormous amount of tv lately.  Partly because I am<br/>
dealing with some serious issues I would rather not have to, and because our<br/>
cable box was replaced and until they log in the new box we get all the paid<br/>
movie channels.  TV is a thing, not a end all be all.<br/>

Who is having some wonderful AOhell P/CP flashbacks - where I learned not to<br/>
post something unless I was willing to defend to the death every statement.<br/>
Folks may not like what is happening, but there is some serious active<br/>
learning going on here.  I luv it =)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586779854">Well, I did worry about my son and TV when he was a baby. I always laughed<br/>
so hard when I nursed while watching Absolutely Fabulous that he would pop<br/>
off. But he did thrive. And he still does, even though he watches whatever<br/>
he wants now (at 12). :-)<br/>
