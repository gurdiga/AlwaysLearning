<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594895617">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on an article for California HomeSchooler Newsletter/Magazine <br/>
about my kids beginning their college career through Community College.  While <br/>
digging through my paperwork I found a copy of a letter I submitted to &quot;Growing <br/>
Without Schooling&quot;, the John Holt newsletter back in 1983.<br/>
<br/>
My son Shawn (then age 9) and I were talking.  He asked when he would go back <br/>
to school.  I asked him when he thought he&#39;d want to go back.  After a while <br/>
he replied that he didn&#39;t think you could homeschool college.  I then asked <br/>
him if he wanted to go to college.  He stated that since he was skipping all <br/>
these grades, and not learning anything, he wouldn&#39;t be able to get in anyway!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I assured him he was learning.  It seems a peer had told Shawn since he <br/>
wasn&#39;t taking spelling tests, he couldn&#39;t spell.  That made sense to Shawn.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy to report that Shawn did actually learn something.  He graduated <br/>
from college last December and has been accepted for graduate school to begin <br/>
this fall (he&#39;s now age 29).<br/>
<br/>
Thought you might enjoy this little story!  It made me chuckle.<br/>
