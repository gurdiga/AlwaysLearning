<div id="ygrps-yiv-299782935">I&#39;ll just mention that I work in the film business in Hollywood and so does <br/>
my dh.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to Amazon.com and search &quot;movie making&quot; in the Books tab you will <br/>
get 11,506 results. I would consider it a fairly crowded field. Many of <br/>
these are books about the making of individual movies, so if your son has a <br/>
couple of favorite films, you could look for those in the list.<br/>
<br/>
For the &quot;How To&#39;&quot; try to look at the publishing date and choose a more <br/>
recent one, because that will include the most up to date technology and <br/>
reflect the newest trends. Honestly I would avoid the &quot;How to do this for <br/>
tiny money&quot; books, at least at first, because although there are occasional <br/>
success stories, most people&#39;s micro budget film is never seen by anyone. <br/>
Doing things on the micro cheap is always a long tale of compromise and will <br/>
be telling you how to get around the conventions and proper protocols, <br/>
instead of explaining why they are in place. There is not one single <br/>
producer who, if given the real choice, would not choose a bigger budget - <br/>
and this is at any budget level!<br/>
<br/>
Many of the books are biographies or memoirs of noted film makers - <br/>
producers, directors - if you see a name you like or recognize those would <br/>
be good.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &quot;how to&quot; books, actually I was looking for the title of a <br/>
reallygood basic little book that detailed the different jobs I found useful <br/>
some years ago, but in doing so I found a newer one aimed at kids in comic <br/>
format, that I rather like the look of: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5yn4y3">http://tinyurl.com/5yn4y3</a>  &quot;Lights, <br/>
Camera, Action&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Other really useful insiders&#39; sources are the journals from the unions. If <br/>
you google IATSE you will get a link to the main alliance, but also scroll <br/>
down to the locals. Moving past the politcal articles, there are often <br/>
articles dealing with specific issues written by people working in the <br/>
business. The Location Managers journal is a good one. If you have a Local <br/>
in your town you might be able to visit it and talk to some people. If you <br/>
have a movie shooting locally you might try to visit - call the production <br/>
office first - or find out if they are casting local extras. People were <br/>
flocking to the Ren Faire that James&#39; movie is using as a location. It <br/>
stayed open an extra week.<br/>
<br/>
The letters that appear after the names of crew members in the credits are <br/>
professional societies. For instance, James is a member of the Cinema Audio <br/>
Society. They all publish journals. Cinefex, the FX folks journal is a <br/>
gorgeous publication, and is usually on the magazine rack in the big chain <br/>
bookstores.<br/>
<br/>
Turner Classic Movies has guests that come and talk about their lives and <br/>
processes. FOX Movie Channel has a series called &quot;Life After Film School&quot; <br/>
where currently working directors and producers are interviewed by a panel <br/>
of current film school students about their process.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few home movie editing software suites around. I will leave it <br/>
to someone experienced with them to make recommendations. We have a regular <br/>
old video cam, and a tiny hand held video cam that holds 30 minutes before <br/>
you have to upload the film to the computer. Jayn has used both with a lot <br/>
of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you are ever in Los Angeles. There are places to see.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions about terminology, you can email me and I&#39;ll <br/>
answer them as best as I can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127493254">When my son was about 9 he got really into clay animation with very simple tools.  He <br/>
made a little set on the dining room table, set up the digital camera on a tripod and <br/>
downloaded the pics to the computer that came with software to make the pics into a <br/>
movie.  He could edit the pics, add sound effects, titles, etc.  The movies are simple and <br/>
incredibly charming and funny.<br/>
<br/>
He was able to play with character, story, timing, etc. with no investment except for clay.  <br/>
It may not be quite what your son wants to do, but I thought I&#39;d mention it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-967534859">I think there&#39;s commentary on the DVD of The Wizard of Oz, about how  <br/>
they did the tornado.  We loaned our copy out a year ago and they  <br/>
haven&#39;t found it yet.<br/>
<br/>
More and more DVDs have extras.   Aladdin, Disney--lots of extras  <br/>
about the voices and cartoons and art.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a camera or phone that will take just a short video?   <br/>
Doing some of those will give him ideas for what to look for with  <br/>
framing and backgrounds and sound.  Just looking and thinking isn&#39;t  <br/>
as good for some people as trying it out, seeing what goes well and  <br/>
what doesn&#39;t and then knowing more when they look and think about other<br/>

today made her first 5-frame clip. She chose the sound effects, I<br/>
helped make the frames which she altered on her own, and I used the<br/>
software to put it together. She&#39;s been interested in cartoons for<br/>
over a year and how they move and talk. After seeing a funny elephant<br/>
cartoon on YouTube, she wanted to make her own. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-284662455">I&#39;m not one of &quot;the two of you&quot;, but if you have a mac there is a <br/>
program called &quot;istopmotion&quot; that is really great.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://boinx.com/istopmotion/overview/home/">http://boinx.com/istopmotion/overview/home/</a><br/>
<br/>
The Home version is $49 but it&#39;s well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very intuitive and easy to use, and works with both digital movie <br/>
cameras and (some) still cameras. It exports directly into imovie for <br/>
editing and adding soundtracks.<br/>
<br/>
My son has been making movies with it since he was 7.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We bought Easy Media Creator to make home movies and such, and that is<br/>
expensive, but works well. Today I also found my computer has Windows<br/>
Movie Maker, which may have come with my computer, I&#39;m not sure. But<br/>
we used it to make her cartoon, and it was fairly simple and easy to use.<br/>
Then there&#39;s this free animator:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clayanimator.com/english/stop_motion_animator.html,">http://www.clayanimator.com/english/stop_motion_animator.html,</a> but I<br/>
don&#39;t know how it works. It seems to need the camera hooked up to the<br/>
computer and will download the pics straight from there, but won&#39;t let<br/>
me put in images from my desktop, which I&#39;d prefer.<br/>
<br/>
That website lists commercial programs, as well.<br/>
