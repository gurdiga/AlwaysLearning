I keep meaning to ask you...is ork ball a game that the kids learned to play or is it something that Marty and Co. created?  Are there rules somewhere?  I remember doing a google search on it one time, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the same game your kids play.<br/>

&lt;&lt; is ork ball a game that the kids learned to play or is it something that <br/>
Marty and Co. created? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty made it up.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out there had been a similar game made up by my husband and a couple of <br/>
his friends when we were in our early 20&#39;s and kids were far in the future, <br/>
but they only played it a couple of times, and in SCA armor, with SCA swords.<br/>
<br/>
Marty might&#39;ve heard Keith talk about it and forgotten or something, I don&#39;t <br/>
know.  But he didn&#39;t name it, I told him what the name of the game Keith had <br/>
played years before had been.  <br/>
<br/>
What Marty had said was &quot;I&#39;m thinking we could play a game with boffers, and <br/>
a ball with hair, like a head, and...&quot; and he went off on details and I zoned <br/>
out thinking how very weird that Keith (whom Marty is SO much like) had been <br/>
so excited about the very same game like 25 years before that.<br/>
<br/>
The rules evolved after several sessions and have settled, I think.<br/>
<br/>
The boffer swords are built with pvc water pipe (I don&#39;t know measurements, <br/>
but I&#39;m guesing 3/4&quot;) covered with foam insulation (made for that pipe) and <br/>
then covered with duct tape, and the end padded with more foam and more duct <br/>
tape.   The end of the hilt is taped over so the PVC isn&#39;t dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
The balls were birthday gifts last year.  When he said he wanted to play it, <br/>
Keith and I secretly made him three orc balls (Marty chooses to spell it &quot;ork <br/>
ball&quot; who knows why) with smallish playground balls, like four-square balls, <br/>
but in different colors.<br/>
<br/>
One of those is still around, but its original clown wig is worn to a nub, <br/>
and Marty put another wig on it, only on the side of its face.   I&#39;ll try to <br/>
upload a picture I took of it today, and some other orkball pictures in a bit.  I <br/>
 borrowed a camera and need to learn how to use it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So there are two shields on the ground (wooden shield blanks my husband had; <br/>
I know not everyone will have such things, but you could use two anythings, <br/>
like bases).<br/>
<br/>
Teams are five people, usually.  Six today, four in a pinch, but ideally <br/>
five, with alternates if there are extra people.<br/>
<br/>
They play to seven points.  When there are seven total points, that&#39;s <br/>
halftime.  When one team has seven points, that&#39;s game.  The seven comes from SCA <br/>
business of 25 years ago, involving the seven dwarves.   (I was Snow White TWICE, <br/>
and was in the newspaper once for it.)<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
Any kind of passing is fair.  They can throw it, kick it, carry it, or bat it <br/>
with the boffer.<br/>
Any kind of catching is fair.  Tapping it with the boffer and catching it as <br/>
it falls, picking it up off the ground, catching it whole or by the hair, <br/>
taking it away from someone else American football-style.<br/>
<br/>
You can hit another player with a boffer.  They started off only hitting the <br/>
carrier, but that rule changed.   If you&#39;re the carrier and you&#39;re hit, you <br/>
have to drop the ball.   Someone else can pick it up.  If you&#39;re hit and you&#39;re <br/>
not carrying, you can hit back, but nobody &quot;has to die&quot; (in boffer-fighting <br/>
terms, there&#39;s no accepting a blow as a wound or a death, because you weren&#39;t a <br/>
legal target).  If you were carrying and you&#39;re hit, you let the ball go back <br/>
into play, and you can&#39;t play again until you resurrect yourself by touching <br/>
both shoulders to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
I was there today and saw some kids somersault, and some just kind of throw <br/>
themselves on their backs and roll over to the other side, get up and go again.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a goalie.   They switch around who&#39;s going to be goalie.  Poor Arik, <br/>
who&#39;s 14 or 15, already a big guy and a good and experienced player, today <br/>
made four goals--two for his team, and two for the opponents, when he was goalie. <br/>
 He let a ball through, and he bounced the ball off another player, back into <br/>
the goal..  It happens.<br/>
<br/>
And...    Some kids have gotten really angry because they got hit too hard.  <br/>
Kirby twisted his ankle a few weeks ago and had to miss a day of karate <br/>
(missed his own class, missed a class he teaches).   Occasionally frustration breaks <br/>
out, but they&#39;ve so far always found ways to make peace and stay friends.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly, our walking calendar, noted that they had had their anniversary a <br/>
couple of weeks ago.  They had played first with a wigless ball, and then on <br/>
Marty&#39;s birthday last year we gifted him with the bewigged assortment.   (Our <br/>
bedroom was very stinky from contact cement.  I slept woozy one night a year ago!)<br/>
<br/>
So what Marty wanted for his birthday this year was a big ork ball game.  <br/>
Twenty people were there at the height of it.  We fed pizza and cake to 18 <br/>
afterward.  Some of them are in the library now playing something in the dark.  I <br/>
went to double check on the points and halftime, and slid open the door and <br/>
asked the darkness my questions, and three different voices gave answers.  I <br/>
thanked them and shut the door.  They didn&#39;t ask why I wanted to know.<br/>
<br/>
I love these kids!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410151506">Wow, Sandra...<br/>
  Thanks for all of that!  What an amazing game they have created....it was all really interesting.  Do you mind if I forward all this to my local group?  Maybe it will inspire some of the kids here.  Has Marty ever thought of trying to market the game in some way?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
As long as he&#39;s just playing with friends, there&#39;s no legal liability.  If he <br/>
were to start a league or something, that would be a legal danger.  If <br/>
someone got hurt...<br/>
<br/>
So it just needs to be a friendly game among friends.  <br/>
<br/>
What keeps them safe, for one thing, is that most of these kids have been in <br/>
the SCA, and the boffer rules are based on what they&#39;re used to there.   There <br/>
are places on the body where you just don&#39;t aim.  Below the knee, hand, face, <br/>
head.   And when they&#39;ve played with kids who aren&#39;t used to SCA combat <br/>
conventions, they have to explain that, and sometimes they have to say &quot;WE MEAN IT, <br/>
don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are probably other things I&#39;m not mentioning that kids who just read <br/>
about it wouldn&#39;t know but kids who see it as an add-on game to &quot;playing <br/>
boffers&quot; their whole lives would just understand.<br/>
<br/>
So it might not export well at all.<br/>
