.&quot; In 1967 she ran, unsuccessfully, as a Republican candidate for the<br/>
Congress of the United States. Temple was a member of the U.S. delegation to<br/>
the United Nations (1969-1970), was U.S. ambassador to Ghana (1974-1976),<br/>
and became the first woman in U.S. history to serve as chief of protocol<br/>
(1976-1977), during the administration of President Gerald R. Ford. She<br/>
served as ambassador to Czechoslovakia (1989-1992), during the<br/>
administration of President George Bush.<br/>
