<div id="ygrps-yiv-1233371648">Sorry about recent spam.  It’s not the fault of the seeming mailer.  Her provider sent a long blah blah blah mailing including this very true factoid:<br/>
-=- Unfortunately there are numerous ways in which spammers can match your address with somebody from your contacts without gaining access to your account.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This can happen to anyone, and it’s a horrible truth of internet vandalism. <br/>
<br/>
Clare’s writing is wonderful and I had taken her off moderation, but I’ve put her back on to protect the group from possible future eruption (no fault of Clare’s).<br/>
<br/>
So to feel better about Clare (and unschooling, and yourself), read here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/clare">http://sandradodd.com/clare</a><br/>
<br/>
Post here!  I wish this group would have more activity.  If you want to tell a recent success story, this would be a good place for it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading, and I’m sorry for recent irritations created by vandalizing bots in the ether.<br/>
<br/>
