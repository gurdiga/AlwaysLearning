<div id="ygrps-yiv-541530818">I really didn&#39;t mean to begin this very interesting<br/>
discussion and then skip out and not participate in<br/>
it.  Unfortunately yesterday afternoon, while<br/>
splitting wood, my husband Tom put his splitting axe<br/>
into his knee.  So I am very involved with caring for<br/>
him just now.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever it was that was explaining about the<br/>
controlling parents hit head on what I was referring<br/>
to in terms of some of the folks I have run into<br/>
personally.  One woman I knew used to physically<br/>
wrestle and force her kicking and screaming 6 year old<br/>
daughter outside away from the tv whenever it was<br/>
sunny, saying she was not allowed to watch tv or be<br/>
indoors when the weather was nice but had to be<br/>
outside, and this was a very active outdoors playing<br/>
little girl who usually had just come in to take a<br/>
break from hours outside.  The same &quot;unschooling&quot; mom<br/>
used to spring surprise food limitations on her kids<br/>
just as they were going to bite into something (True<br/>
example - once said to one of her teens:  You ate that<br/>
watermelon earlier during dinner, so you can&#39;t have<br/>
any ice cream with everyone else because I consider<br/>
watermelon dessert.)  It was just really bizarre<br/>
control issues, lots and lots of other instances like<br/>
those.<br/>
<br/>
I have never challenged anyone online or elsewhere<br/>
about whether they were really unschoolers.  The<br/>
original question I posed was in response to the<br/>
&quot;bitching&quot; I have heard recently in various groups<br/>
about people who know &quot;unschoolers&quot; and who find them<br/>
pushy, sanctimonious, rude, etc.  So I was just<br/>
wondering what others had experienced regarding this<br/>
seeming cross section of controlling and self<br/>
righteous &quot;unschoolers&quot; that these folks seem to be<br/>
running into.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t participate more just now, but I am glad<br/>
that others seem to be enjoying this exchange.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thankfully, I don&#39;t see too much of that in my circles. Course my circles<br/>
tend to be this and a couple other lists, and an occasional interaction with<br/>
unschoolers irl.<br/>
<br/>
Could this be a cross-section of personalities that would proportionately be<br/>
similar to any other cross-section of a group? It seems this is a<br/>
personality type in most groups.<br/>
<br/>
It does bring to mind all the &quot;liberal&quot; friends I have had over the years<br/>
that pound their realities into their children. They respect the hell out of<br/>
a tree, but their kids are going to eat every organic pea on the plate or<br/>
they are in their rooms for the night.<br/>

<br/>
Ooh Nancy, it makes me all shivery just to think of it. I hope he is well<br/>
again soon. Doing physical therapy (or even just wading back and forth) in a<br/>
pool is really good for knees - once the cut is healed of course. James is a<br/>
veteran of two knee surgeries including a total knee replacement.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I have never challenged anyone online or elsewhere<br/>
about whether they were really unschoolers.  The<br/>
original question I posed was in response to the<br/>
&quot;bitching&quot; I have heard recently in various groups<br/>
about people who know &quot;unschoolers&quot; and who find them<br/>
pushy, sanctimonious, rude, etc.  So I was just<br/>
wondering what others had experienced regarding this<br/>
seeming cross section of controlling and self<br/>
righteous &quot;unschoolers&quot; that these folks seem to be<br/>
running into. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only h/s parents I have met IRL that I don&#39;t like much, or don&#39;t connect<br/>
with emotionally, aren&#39;t Unschoolers - even pretend unschoolers. All the<br/>
genuine Unschoolers I have met IRL are wonderful people - generous of heart,<br/>
open, humorous, enthusiastic about life - and usually really wise. <br/>
<br/>
The people that tend to seem most sanctimonious to me are the ones (few) who<br/>
have &quot;tried unschooling and it didn&#39;t work&quot;, so they returned to directing<br/>
their children&#39;s education and imposing their educational goals. When they<br/>
elaborate on their experiences it is clear that they tried it in the way<br/>
Sandra has written about in her essay - they were expecting a two week<br/>
&quot;hands off&quot; to result in a spontaneous generation of a six subject daily<br/>
work schedule or school-commensurate skills acquisition. <br/>
<br/>
One person I know poo-poos unschooling every time she can, because<br/>
essentially she became too impatient with her son&#39;s (then 5.5) progress<br/>
towards penmanship with an &quot;unschooling approach&quot;. I gather that entailed<br/>
her standing over his shoulder while he tried to write the assigned words<br/>
being increasingly horrified at how he was forming his letters. She said he<br/>
was worried about it, but personally I think he just felt judged. <br/>
<br/>
She bought a How to Write book that she now recommends - it&#39;s difference<br/>
seems to be that it is more centered on starting with easy letters rather<br/>
than following the alphabet. Jayn writes words and letters because she<br/>
enjoys doing so, choosing them for their importance to her message or<br/>
meaning. But it&#39;s easy for me to be sanguine on the matter - she has been<br/>
holding her implement the &quot;proper&quot; way since the first time she picked up a<br/>
spoon in infancy.<br/>
