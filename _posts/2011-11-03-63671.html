This view is so deeply entrenched in our culture (certainly here in the UK) that I believe it can be one of the biggest barriers to unschooling. I was often (still am) told that unless I made things hard for my children they wouldn&#39;t learn anything. A teacher I knew told me that I should face their school-desks (school-desks?!?) against a wall because otherwise they would be able to see all the fun things they could be doing instead.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097810940">I think there may be truth to the idea that if you want someone to strive to <br/>
change making them miserable where they are can help. The problem is that you <br/>
can&#39;t predict how they will change, what they will change. The protests going on <br/>
in the UK, Spain, the U.S., Greece, and everywhere else in the world are a <br/>
product of some folks being miserable. I imagine that isn&#39;t the kind of striving <br/>
for change the Chief Inspector of Schools would call a good outcome of <br/>
unhappiness. And, given that the finding about summer born children doing less <br/>
well throughout their school career is the catalyst for the article, however <br/>
they are changing it isn&#39;t in the way that he is arguing would happen. And what <br/>
is exactly the right amount of misery to nudge someone in the right direction of <br/>
learning? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve felt envy. Not masses, but occasional moments of, when I look at how good <br/>
Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s life is, how much I wish that I had the connection they <br/>
have with their family. How much I wish I&#39;d had the power they have. And I can <br/>
understand how a grown up child can believe that the suffering they experienced <br/>
must have been valuable. It must have given them the edge they have now. I&#39;ve <br/>
had young children argue with me about the necessity of school because otherwise <br/>
what the hell where they doing going to this place they hated every weekday?!! <br/>
It meant that their parents were making choices that weren&#39;t necessarily the <br/>
choices that had their interests at heart. And that&#39;s too hard to swallow. So <br/>
you pass on the notion that being unhappy is what makes you learn even while <br/>
trying to be happy in your own life and helping your own children to be happy. <br/>
Such fabulous cognitive dissonance. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Simon and Linnaea have been listening to a lot of Tim Minchin lately and when I <br/>
read your post I thought of this song: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xQmJ_vxHB4&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xQmJ_vxHB4&feature=related</a> and how much I <br/>
believed that being miserable was the same as being deep and thoughtful. I <br/>
haven&#39;t felt that way for a long time. But it was an important part of my <br/>
worldview when I was 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and then it started to <br/>
taper off. I like being happy. I strive to be happy. And I stay where I am <br/>
happiest. And I learn all the time!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The kids in English boarding schools on TV always seem very unhappy.  <br/>
So quality is perhaps seen as proportional to suffering and  <br/>
unhappiness. :-/<br/>
<br/>
And it makes sense that we&#39;d be learning the most when we&#39;re tackling  <br/>
something challenging and difficult. But its the desire for that  <br/>
knowledge that&#39;s driving someone to learn not the challenge. And  <br/>
really big desire will drive us through something challenging and  <br/>
difficult which will result in a big chunk of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Without the drive, the learning isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
*Some* kids like external motivators (grades and scores) that give  <br/>
them goals to shoot for. Some kids like school style learning and are  <br/>
generally interested in the knowledge. If someone has those factors,  <br/>
the desire for the external motivator can give them extra drive to get  <br/>
through more challenging material that they wouldn&#39;t tackle on their  <br/>
own, from which they&#39;ll come out the other side with more knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
But, again, it&#39;s still the internal drive -- for the information or  <br/>
grades -- that&#39;s the cause of learning a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is educators have their eyes on a big chunk of knowledge  <br/>
(sculpted by centuries of tradition in England) they want to get into  <br/>
kids. There are wo truths that educators see: If kids are left to  <br/>
choose, they may dabble a bit but mostly avoid the knowledge and will  <br/>
choose fun instead. When kids are made to learn, they&#39;ll choose to do  <br/>
as little as possible to get by. When kids drop out of school or are  <br/>
forced out, for the most part they continue that pattern.<br/>
<br/>
What educators conclude is that kids are naturally lazy pleasure  <br/>
seekers. In order to make something of themselves, kids need adult  <br/>
intervention to force the knowledge into them.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the understanding of kids and learning that unschoolers are up  <br/>
against.<br/>
<br/>
What is actually true -- that educators have no clue about -- is that  <br/>
kids aren&#39;t avoiding the learning so much as they&#39;re avoiding the  <br/>
pressure to learn what doesn&#39;t (yet) intrigue them, and avoiding the  <br/>
increasingly negative association they&#39;re picking up about the  <br/>
knowledge. What is also true is that even when allowed to follow their  <br/>
interests, most kids will only take in a small portion of that chunk  <br/>
of learning. (And what they do take in instead is very hard to test.  <br/>
They might have a big chunk of knowledge and good feelings about  <br/>
Shakespeare but it won&#39;t necessarily be the particular factoids that  <br/>
are on the test. So it will appear that they don&#39;t know much at all.)<br/>
<br/>
But because of the focus on the knowledge, because of the focus on the  <br/>
amount a child takes in, unschooling will look like some knee jerk  <br/>
blind rejection of what&#39;s important because Mom wants something pie in  <br/>
the sky, can&#39;t-get-a-job-with-it ideal like happiness. And, just as  <br/>
people can&#39;t learn without drive, educators  can&#39;t be pressured to  <br/>
learn a new way of seeing education unless they have reasons that fire  <br/>
up the internal drive to do so. And if unhappiness is accepted as part  <br/>
of the process, that&#39;s one less path to a new way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have an advantage in the US in that people here see  <br/>
happiness as an unalienable right. (It&#39;s in our Declaration of  <br/>
Independence from you guys :-) &quot;Life, liberty and the pursuit of  <br/>
happiness.&quot; Which, culturally, only fully applies to adults but  <br/>
there&#39;s a trickle down effect on children that won&#39;t allow society as  <br/>
a whole to adopt children&#39;s unhappiness as a necessary thing.) Lots of  <br/>
people come to homeschooling and then unschooling *because* their kids  <br/>
are very unhappy in school. And when parents accept their kids  <br/>
unhappiness in school, I think they&#39;re more likely to see it as tragic  <br/>
and something that needs fixed (even if they have no idea how to fix  <br/>
it.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is true. If someone&#39;s happy, why would they change anything?  How  <br/>
many people are unschooling because they and their kids were happy  <br/>
with school?<br/>
<br/>
(I think the fear that kids will never want to leave home because  <br/>
they&#39;re too happy sounds reasonable in that light ;-) But biology  <br/>
drives kids to want to be independent, to do it themselves. They might  <br/>
not label what they feel as unhappiness or misery but discontent, the  <br/>
need for something different will grow.)<br/>
<br/>
Being unhappy or dissatisfied is definitely a good motivator. It&#39;s why  <br/>
I&#39;ve often said that support is not helpful for adopting an  <br/>
unschooling way of life. Support for the struggle as someone is  <br/>
changing is good. Support for how hard this is, how difficult it is to  <br/>
change, how this state of discomfort is common to all parents, can  <br/>
make people feel more comfortable about where they are and makes it  <br/>
easier not to change.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s solidarity in suffering through the misery, it can help  <br/>
people put up with the bad conditions and not seek change.<br/>
<br/>
But making people miserable? Yeah, there&#39;s no predicting what change  <br/>
they&#39;d decide to make. In America there are AK-47s and other high  <br/>
powered weaponry available as choices :-/<br/>

Part of what shocks me is the casual and frequent use of the term &quot;stupid&quot; in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, the idea that the youngest children were probably not more unhappy than older children is stunning.<br/>

<br/>
My mother-in-law said years ago, of my pre-school-aged boys, &quot;You need to frustrate them.&quot;  She was serious.  She wanted to see them baffled and uncomfortable so they could learn to endure bafflement and discomfort.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can make a meal I&#39;m happy with, and at the same time be thinking of ideas of what I could do a bit differently next time.  It&#39;s the excitement about possibilities, rather than misery with how things are, that drives the exploring and the learning.  It&#39;s at the heart of strewing, it&#39;s at the heart of people making progress with all sorts of things they learn about.  They don&#39;t need to be unhappy with how things are.  Being interested in or excited about how things could be is a wonderful and natural starting point for learning and growth.<br/>
<br/>
In the school context, instead of keeping a certain level of unhappiness in school children&#39;s lives to get them to &quot;make progress&quot;, schools could be strewing teasers of all sorts, keeping interesting possibilities within reach, visible, imaginable.  Keeping interest, and the natural desire to understand and be competent, alive.  <br/>
<br/>
Parents don&#39;t need to ensure that their children are somewhat unhappy for them to efficiently learn to walk or talk.  They learn to walk, talk (and can be happy too!) if parents keep the possibilities for change open - keeping their worlds interesting, holding their hands as they begin to toddle, talking to them about interesting things, listening with love, being ready to help etc. <br/>
<br/>
Unhappy can sometimes lead to inertia, whereas happy is often energizing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And what most educators don&#39;t get to see where learning is concerned is that people naturally Like to learn and are naturally motivated - arguably even driven - to learn and discover, so much so that we have a word for times when there&#39;s an uncomfortable lack of learning and discovery: tedium. Educators sometimes seek to induce tedium for that reason, but it falls flat for the same reason inducing other kinds of suffering does - there&#39;s no way to control what kids will choose to learn to relieve the tedium. My partner can fold fifteen different varieties of paper airplane and aim them with mind-boggling accuracy as a result of classroom tedium - definitely not what the teacher had in mind!<br/>
