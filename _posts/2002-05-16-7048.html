~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Claim:   The daddy longlegs is the &quot;world&#39;s most poisonous animal.&quot; <br/>
Status:   False. <br/>
Example:   [Collected on the Internet, 2000] <br/>
The most poisonous animal, believe it or not, is the daddy long legs,<br/>
however, it&#39;s mouth is so small, it cannot bite us. <br/>
Origins:   A popular &quot;fact&quot; these days, especially among youngsters, is<br/>
the notion that the North American arachnid commonly called a daddy<br/>
longlegs (and also known as a harvestman) is &quot;the world&#39;s most poisonous&quot;<br/>
animal. <br/>
This one is pretty easy to dispose of. First of all, the daddy longlegs<br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;poisonous&quot; at all. Poisonous animals give off toxins which are<br/>
absorbed when they are touched or eaten by attackers; spiders are an<br/>
example of venomous creatures, which transmit toxins by injecting them<br/>
into their victims. And the honor of the world&#39;s most poisonous animal is<br/>
generally awarded to the South American poison dart frog or the box<br/>
jellyfish. <br/>
The daddy longlegs isn&#39;t technically a spider, but even if it were, it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be the world&#39;s most venomous one of those, either -- that prize<br/>
is claimed by the funnel web spider or the brown recluse spider. The<br/>
daddy longlegs isn&#39;t &quot;poisonous&quot; (or venomous) at all. In fact, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t even bite and poses absolutely no threat to human beings (other<br/>
than sometimes emitting a foul smell). <br/>
Some of the confusion undoubtedly stems from a North American<br/>
perspective, since more than one critter in the world is referred to as<br/>
&quot;daddy longlegs.&quot; The crane fly, an unrelated winged insect which looks<br/>
like a large mosquito, is also called daddy longlegs in some parts of the<br/>
world (such as England), but it too is a non-venomous, non-biting<br/>
creature. Pholcus phalangioides, also known as the long-legged cellar<br/>
spider, is another example of a &quot;daddy longlegs,&quot; probably the one<br/>
referred to here as being the world&#39;s &quot;most poisonous animal&quot;: <br/>
Although Pholcus phalangioides is indeed a spider and is venomous to<br/>
boot, it is (as suggested) far too small to pose any threat to human<br/>
beings, so the strength of its venom is moot. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155671804">I love snopes, too. This site gave even a better explanation, though, since<br/>
the snopes article referred to a daddy longlegs as an arachnid that wasn&#39;t a<br/>
true spider, and this explains it:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html">http://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DADDY-LONGLEGS ARE ONE OF THE MOST POISONOUS SPIDERS BUT THEIR FANGS ARE TOO<br/>
SHORT TO BITE HUMANS<br/>
This tale has been lurking around for years. I have heard it repeatedly in<br/>
the United States and even heard a schoolteacher misinforming her class at a<br/>
museum in Brisbane, Australia. This is incorrect, but to clarify it, several<br/>
points need to be explained first.<br/>
<br/>
The animals<br/>
Most folks who retell this tale have no idea that they are referring to two<br/>
completely separate groups of animals: &quot;daddy-longlegs&quot; and &quot;daddy-longlegs<br/>
spiders&quot;. In the animal class Arachnida, there are several lower level<br/>
divisions called Orders. Scorpions are in the Order Scorpiones, spiders are<br/>
in the Order Araneae, ticks and mites are in the Order Acari.<br/>
<br/>
The creatures most correctly called daddy-longlegs are in their own separate<br/>
Order which is Opiliones. Common names for this Order are 1) daddy-longlegs,<br/>
2) harvestmen and 3) opilionids. They are characterized by having one basic<br/>
body segment which shows segmentation on the posterior portion, at most 2<br/>
eyes and all 8 legs attach to the pill-like body segment. They are usually<br/>
found under logs and rocks, prefer moist habitat although they can be found<br/>
in the desert, often have long flexible legs (in the temperate Northern<br/>
hemisphere but there are also short-legged daddy-longlegs) and they do not<br/>
produce silk so therefore they are never found in webs unless they are being<br/>
eaten by spiders. Because they are found under logs and other stuff which<br/>
people most often are not turning over, most folks don&#39;t run into<br/>
daddy-longlegs very often.<br/>
<br/>
Another creature often called daddy-longlegs are actually spiders. These<br/>
long-legged spiders are in the family Pholcidae. Previously the common name<br/>
of this family was the cellar spiders but arachnologists have also given<br/>
them the moniker of &quot;daddy-longlegs spiders&quot; because of the confusion<br/>
generated by the general public. Because these arachnids are spiders, they<br/>
have 2 body basic body parts (cephalothorax and abdomen), have 8 eyes most<br/>
often clumped together in the front of the body, the abdomen shows no<br/>
evidence of segmentation, have 8 legs all attached to the front most body<br/>
part (the cephalothorax) and make webs out of silk. This is most probably<br/>
the animal to which people refer when they tell the tale because these<br/>
spiders are plentiful especially in cellars (hence their common name) and<br/>
are commonly seen by the general public. The most common pholcid spiders<br/>
found in U.S. homes are both European immigrants. Pholcus phalangioides is a<br/>
uniformly grey spider with rectangular, elongate abdomen and is found<br/>
throughout the U.S. Holocnemus pluchei also has a rectangular, elongate<br/>
abdomen but has a brown stripe on the ventral side (the belly side - which<br/>
is typically directed upwards since the spider hangs upside down in its web)<br/>
which covers its sternum and is a stripe on the abdomen. These spiders are<br/>
very common along the Pacific Coast. and into the southwest deserts.<br/>
<br/>
Possible envenomation<br/>
Is there any truth to this oft-repeated tale?<br/>
<br/>
Daddy-longlegs (Opiliones) - these arachnids make their living by eating<br/>
decomposing vegetative and animal matter although are opportunist predators<br/>
if they can get away with it. They do not have venom glands, fangs or any<br/>
other mechanism for chemically subduing their food. Therefore, they do not<br/>
have poison and, by the powers of logic, cannot be poisonous from venom.<br/>
Some have defensive secretions that might be poisonous to small animals if<br/>
ingested. So, for these daddy-long-legs, the tale is clearly false.<br/>
<br/>
Daddy-longlegs spiders (Pholcidae) - Here, the myth is incorrect at least in<br/>
making claims that have no basis in known facts. There is no reference to<br/>
any pholcid spider biting a human and causing any detrimental reaction. If<br/>
these spiders were indeed deadly poisonous but couldn&#39;t bite humans, then<br/>
the only way we would know that they are poisonous is by milking them and<br/>
injecting the venom into humans. For a variety of reasons including Amnesty<br/>
International and a humanitarian code of ethics, this research has never<br/>
been done. Furthermore, there are no toxicological studies testing the<br/>
lethality of pholcid venom on any mammalian system (this is usually done<br/>
with mice). Therefore, no information is available on the likely toxic<br/>
effects of their venom in humans, so the part of the myth about their being<br/>
especially poisonous is just that: a myth. There is no scientific basis for<br/>
the supposition that they are deadly poisonous and there is no reason to<br/>
assume that it is true.<br/>
<br/>
What about their fangs being too short to penetrate human skin? Pholcids do<br/>
indeed have short fangs, which in arachnological terms is called &quot;uncate&quot;<br/>
because they have a secondary tooth which meets the fang like the way the<br/>
two grabbing parts of a pair of tongs come together. Brown recluse spiders<br/>
similarly have uncate fang structure and they obviously are able to bite<br/>
humans. There may be a difference in the musculature that houses the fang<br/>
such that recluses have stronger muscles for penetration because they are<br/>
hunting spiders needing to subdue prey whereas pholcid spiders are able to<br/>
wrap their prey and don&#39;t need as strong a musculature. So, again, the myth<br/>
states as fact something about which there is no scientific basis.<br/>
<br/>
In summary<br/>
For true daddy-long-legs, the opilionids, the myth is certainly false, and<br/>
for the daddy-long-legs spiders it is certainly not based on known facts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318056798">I&#39;ve just spent 20 mins shouting at my kids and I feel terrible. I&#39;m <br/>
finding homeschooling, let along unschooling difficult and <br/>
sometimes wish I could just send them to school.<br/>
This week we got our CAT tests to do, to fulfill Virginia <br/>
requirtements and the children don&#39;t want to do them. My husband <br/>
seems to think that they should get 90%+ in order to prove that <br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; works (he&#39;s amathematician, you&#39;d think he would <br/>
know that average is 50% but he&#39;s always scored top marks in <br/>
every test or exam he looked at and he was top of his year for the <br/>
whole country in his maths degree). I tried pointing out to him that <br/>
if they were in school, years of boredom would have resulted in not <br/>
only low marks but disaffectation with learning itself but because <br/>
he enjoyed school he doesn&#39;t believe me. accused me of making <br/>
up psychobabble. He cited all the homeschoolers we know who&#39;s <br/>
kids can&#39;t read by 8 or so, said I was ruining my children&#39;s life <br/>
through sticking to a philosophy that was &#39;unproven&#39; (he&#39;s a <br/>
scientist, can you tell?)<br/>
Then he cited all the other homeschoolers who score in national <br/>
tests, who are building rockets by the time they are 6, who spend <br/>
ages reading books, who are maths geniuses (are these the same <br/>
ones who can&#39;t read?), who spend all day excited by microscopes <br/>
etc etc.<br/>
When my daughter was in school (from age 4 to 8) she was at <br/>
least 6 years head of her peers in maths. Now that she is 10 and <br/>
has been homeschooled for 2 years, she is not. She&#39;s maybe 2 <br/>
years ahead in some areas and average in others. He ranted on <br/>
about that too.<br/>
I feel fed up with the lack of support. I feel guilty that everyone else <br/>
is buying curricula and spending all day conducting science <br/>
experiements. I am tired from fighting with my children all day <br/>
about everything. This morning they are refusing to eat because the <br/>
bread is american.<br/>
They&#39;ve been de-schooling for 2 years. Why are they not interested <br/>
in anything? How can I prove to the state that learning is taking <br/>
place if they wont do the tests?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123935314">Poor Shyrley, poor kids.........blame that damned MS. <br/>
It wrecks your stamina.<br/>
<br/>
Have you thought about an umbrella school....in FL we<br/>
have two that are unschooling more than friendly. <br/>
Clonlara (did I spell it right?), to which Sandra once<br/>
sent me a link is national....perhaps that, or<br/>
something similar might be an option.  Are you and the<br/>
children still UK citizens?  You may be exempt. As US<br/>
citizens in Urawa, Japan we were exempt from Japanese<br/>
requirements.  And too far away for US (we were<br/>
non-military).  :-) <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a few phone calls and your visa could solve<br/>
the delima?  maybe?<br/>
<br/>
I hear some of the same stuff from my DH. Whenever DH<br/>
doesn&#39;t like how Roy approaches a problem (how to get<br/>
out of doing what DH thinks he should) DH says he is<br/>
&quot;Like he is becuase of how you (me) treat him.&quot;  He<br/>
also says he has learned to argue from me, that it is<br/>
useless to try tell either of us anything. BWG.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t see the humour in that:-( But I DEBATE .  This<br/>
is very frustrating to him.  I use facts, samples,<br/>
quotes, figures, and state clearly when and if it is<br/>
somehting that I care about. Usually the ussues are<br/>
things of which he is ignorant, except for info I have<br/>
provided, so oh well. Perhaps you and the kids could<br/>
make up some graphs or other visuals? Just for fun, on<br/>
a flip chart...like a coorporate sales presentation. <br/>
How could he help but to be impressed?<br/>
<br/>
The kids will be OK to not eat one breakfast at<br/>
breakfast time.  Unschooling....remember....<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I still have (feel compelled) to put the<br/>
bites in Roy&#39;s mouth  (he isn&#39;t really concerned if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to stop what he is doing)....he gets so<br/>
interested in other things, he forgets to eat....this<br/>
drives his Daddy bonkers...he feels it is too babyish<br/>
and that I molly-coddle him too much. If I really want<br/>
to pull his chain I can refer to Beethoven and his<br/>
toilet/piano bench (dunno if that is really real or<br/>
myth)....<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you to feel a little better.<br/>
<br/>
How are your aches and pains? Can you sleep? Perhaps<br/>
you are trying to do TOO much, and DH&#39;s lack of<br/>
physical help and sympathy and understanding for MS as<br/>
well as unschooling is part your frustration.  Are the<br/>
children sympathetic to your pain?  Or do you try to<br/>
conceal it?<br/>
<br/>
What are the penalties for omitting the tests?<br/>

It sounds like he really believes a high test score really makes a<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s problem #1 and the biggest. If your husband doesn&#39;t understand and<br/>
endorse unschooling, or at the very LEAST understand and endorse that you<br/>
will not intentionally screw up your kids and that you&#39;ve done a lot of work<br/>
and research on this and can be trusted, I don&#39;t know how you do it, either.<br/>
This is a marriage problem, not a homeschooling problem, and his undermining<br/>
it has got to stop if you&#39;re going to be able to go on with anything<br/>
resembling peace and prosperity.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s going to go around ranting about a child who is &quot;not ahead enough&quot;<br/>

----------<br/>
<br/>
Is there some reason you&#39;re fighting with them about things like not wanting<br/>
to eat a particular thing? Is there some reason not to say, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go<br/>
to the grocery store&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
They&#39;ve been de-schooling for 2 years. Why are they not interested<br/>

----------<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re interested in not eating american bread (er, what IS american bread?<br/>
Bread made in America, or a brand?) If you mean that they are not interested<br/>
in anything academic, such interest is not and cannot be the measure of<br/>
success in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe they are not interested in &quot;anything&quot;. What do they and you<br/>
do all day every day? What are their hobbies? Where do you go?<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
 How can I prove to the state that learning is taking<br/>
place if they wont do the tests?<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I would be focusing my energy not on proving anything to the state, but in<br/>
making any absolutely necessary hoop-jumping as problem-free for my children<br/>
as possible. There may be other alternatives: what happens if they don&#39;t<br/>
take the test? What happens if they take the test but do poorly on it? What<br/>
are the loopholes? Post a note on the Virginia board at www.unschooling.com<br/>
and ask.<br/>
<br/>
If they DO have to take the test and there ARE real and nasty penalties for<br/>
poor performance, I would have no moral problem with taking the test for<br/>
them and turning it in, or making it an open-book<br/>
let&#39;s-all-get-this-blasted-thing-done-together scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Loopholes. Find them, love them.<br/>

from both you and the kids. It&#39;s very cyclical and amazing how it crops up<br/>
even when you think you are settled and used to a place. It can make<br/>
everyone really cranky. <br/>
When it hits us we try and do something from &quot;home&quot; and talking about what<br/>
we miss. Then we talk about all the things we are now enjoying and what we<br/>
DON&#39;T miss about home. It helps us just to acknowledge our feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m finding homeschooling, let along unschooling difficult and  <br/>
sometimes wish I could just send them to school.  This week we <br/>
got our CAT tests to do, to fulfill Virginia requirtements and the <br/>
children don&#39;t want to do them. My husband seems to think that <br/>
they should get 90%+ in order to prove that &#39;unschooling&#39; works <br/>
(he&#39;s amathematician, you&#39;d think he would know that average is <br/>
50% but he&#39;s always scored top marks in every test or exam he <br/>
looked at and he was top of his year for the whole country in his <br/>
maths degree). I tried pointing out to him that if they were in <br/>
school, years of boredom would have resulted in not only low <br/>
marks but disaffectation with learning itself but because he <br/>
enjoyed school he doesn&#39;t believe me. accused me of making <br/>
up psychobabble. He cited all the homeschoolers we know <br/>
who&#39;s kids can&#39;t read by 8 or so, said I was ruining my children&#39;s <br/>
life through sticking to a philosophy that was &#39;unproven&#39; (he&#39;s a <br/>
scientist, can you tell?) <br/>
Then he cited all the other homeschoolers who score in national  <br/>
tests, who are building rockets by the time they are 6, who spend  <br/>
ages reading books, who are maths geniuses (are these the <br/>
same ones who can&#39;t read?), who spend all day excited by <br/>
microscopes etc etc.<br/>
When my daughter was in school (from age 4 to 8) she was at <br/>
least 6 years head of her peers in maths. Now that she is 10 and  <br/>
has been homeschooled for 2 years, she is not. She&#39;s maybe 2 <br/>
years ahead in some areas and average in others. He ranted on  <br/>
about that too.<br/>
I feel fed up with the lack of support. I feel guilty that everyone <br/>
else is buying curricula and spending all day conducting science  <br/>
experiements. I am tired from fighting with my children all day  <br/>
about everything.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having a hard time Shyrley.  It sounds like you&#39;re <br/>
under a lot of stress right now.  I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re husband is <br/>
being so unsupportive of you.  I don&#39;t mean to offend you, but it <br/>
sounds to me as if he doesn&#39;t have faith in you, to do what is <br/>
right for your kids.  Doesn&#39;t he believe that you&#39;ve researched <br/>
unschooling and have faith in what you&#39;re doing?  What does he <br/>
consider to be important for his children to be successful, and <br/>
why does he measure their success against his (as in they have <br/>
to get top marks)?  Is a love of life and learning successful? Or is <br/>
it just how much money they earn, or how much notoriety they <br/>
have in their field?  What if one of them chooses to be a <br/>
housecleaner or a handyperson?  Is that going to be totally <br/>
unacceptable to him and, if so, why?  Has he done any reading <br/>
or research on unschooling himself?  If he hasn&#39;t, then I would <br/>
point him in the direction of books and websites and tell him to <br/>
start reading before he criticizes any more.  If he is undermining <br/>
you and doesn&#39;t seem to trust you then your kids are probably <br/>
picking up on it and feeling unsettled and insecure, which in turn <br/>
leads to more strife between you and your kids.<br/>
There are millions of people in this world who hated or had a <br/>
hard time in school.  That&#39;s not &quot;psychobabble&quot;.  I&#39;m sure there <br/>
are books and websites where this could be researched and <br/>
documented as well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This morning they are refusing to eat because the bread is <br/>
american.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This may be because you&#39;ve all seemed to have a hard time <br/>
assimilating into the area you&#39;re in, and so have negative <br/>
images of the USA.  Also you&#39;ve all been homesick.  When you <br/>
do some travelling (and/or when you move), you may find that <br/>
your impressions and/or feelings about the USA change.  In the <br/>
meantime you could make scones or bread.  It&#39;ll be English <br/>
because YOU made it &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They&#39;ve been de-schooling for 2 years. Why are they not <br/>
interested in anything? How can I prove to the state that learning <br/>
is taking place if they wont do the tests?<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry for the rant.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley the desperate<br/>
&quot;Common sense is what tells you that the world is flat&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet they&#39;re interested in a lot of stuff.  It may just be at this point <br/>
in your life it&#39;s hard to see what.  Do you mean specifically <br/>
academic stuff?  If so, open your mind to other things and look <br/>
for the worth in ALL activities.  You&#39;ll be surprised at how much <br/>
&#39;academic&#39; stuff is done in the everyday doings and interests in <br/>
life.<br/>
You may be exempt from the tests if you&#39;re a UK citizen and not <br/>
an American one.  Check with the British Consulate on that one.  <br/>
Does it matter if you &#39;help&#39; with the test a bit or if they don&#39;t score <br/>
off the charts?  Use any and all loopholes.<br/>

Nobel Prize winners who hated school and thought it was terrible and<br/>
harmful.  I remember quotes from Einstein, Churchill and G. B. Shaw in<br/>
particular.<br/>

Doesn&#39;t someone here use an Einstein anti-school quote as a sig line?<br/>
