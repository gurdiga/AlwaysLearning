I knew about one of these pages, and today I was out checking my bookmarks <br/>
and goofing around while files were loading elsewhere, and SOMEHOW ( I can&#39;t <br/>
figure out how now--tried to retrace steps which were all gone) I found this <br/>
other page.  And I think there was a third too, but I can&#39;t find it now.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
These are pages of links to unschooling articles made by Mae Shell.   Reading <br/>
her website, I find she was to have married Peter Kowalke, who&#39;s the Home <br/>
Education Magazine columnist for grown unschoolers and suchlike, in late <br/>
July.  I don&#39;t know if that happened, but maybe and probably it did.  (If <br/>
anyone can confirm, please do!)<br/>
<br/>
So the two of them are grown unschoolers, and she has a pretty nice website, <br/>
but it&#39;s not all linked to the index/scrollbar/directory stuff at the left, <br/>
obviously, because these aren&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone figures out how to find more of the unschooling pages, please let <br/>
me know!<br/>

told us about:<br/>

<br/>
(Google didn&#39;t turn up the two that you found though!)<br/>
<br/>
Ironically (to those on Unschooling-dotcom) she has a link to a Liberterian<br/>
Unschooling site ;-)<br/>

THANK YOU!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
One of those I had seen the first day and could not at all figure out how to <br/>
find it again.  None are linked from her first page, but the main page of <br/>
them was linked from one of her letters as something she was working on and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it again.<br/>
<br/>
With apologies to any who will roll their eyes at my slacking, please tell <br/>
us, Joyce, again, what Dan told us about the google search, because I must <br/>
not have gotten it (in the &quot;got it, understand&quot; way) the first time.<br/>
<br/>
How did you find those two?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The long version is at the article he posted about:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yil.com/features/feature.asp?Frame=false&Volume=08&Issue=06&Keywo">http://www.yil.com/features/feature.asp?Frame=false&Volume=08&Issue=06&Keywo</a><br/>
rd=googler<br/>
<br/>
The short version is click on Advanced Search at Google. You can fill in a<br/>
search word and down there in a box you can fill in a domain name,<br/>
maeshell.com, and it will search all the pages with that domain name.<br/>
<br/>
It *should* have turned up the pages you found since it searches for the<br/>
words in the text of the pages and the URL. (One of the pull down boxes is<br/>
to have it search just the URL.)<br/>
<br/>
Also sometimes it shows on the results page that it searched for the URL as<br/>
a text string. (It should just have the site after &quot;site:&quot;) So I just went<br/>
back and tried again and fussed a bit to make it stop doing that.<br/>
<br/>
ACK!<br/>
<br/>
I just did it again so I could click on the &quot;Didn&#39;t find the resulst you<br/>
wanted? Tell us how to get better&quot; link at Google and either Google is<br/>
messing with my mind or she just put up a whole slew of unschooling pages<br/>
between the time I started this email and the end of it! (And I can&#39;t find<br/>
the &quot;Tell us how to get better link&quot; either. Is this the Twilight Zone or<br/>
something?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960133866">OH MY GOSH!!!<br/>
<br/>
All that and without links between them or a directory page!!?!<br/>
<br/>
This appeared on the sidebar on one of the pages:<br/>
Unschooling pages are <br/>
under construction. <br/>
Visit the old pages here. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess she&#39;s gearing up to putting a list-directory-what&#39;s*it there!<br/>
