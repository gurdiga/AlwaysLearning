<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661737772">I have heard alot of games mentioned here. I was wondering if anyone <br/>
had any other favorites that they could share. My girls love playing <br/>
on the computer but we don&#39;t have alot of games. We do have a few <br/>
websites we like but I would like to find some games we can buy for <br/>
more variety. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on letting go of the reigns, too. I was raised in a home <br/>
where I couldn&#39;t go to the bathroom without informing someone of <br/>
where I would be.(This is not an exaggeration.) So control is <br/>
something that I find myself unwillingly attached to. I know that I&#39;m <br/>
getting there though because my family doesn&#39;t understand how I <br/>
interact with my children. LOL! <br/>
<br/>
I have only recently learned about Whole Life Unschooling. I have <br/>
tried to control my children and I&#39;m so glad that they have never <br/>
been as submissive as I was at their age. My husband thinks I&#39;m going <br/>
to far but I think that time will show him other wise. I can already <br/>
see a change in my relationship with my girls. We talk not fuss. And <br/>
when they try to fuss at me I stay so calm and unaffected that they <br/>
quickly follow suit. You can&#39;t fight with someone that&#39;s not fighting <br/>
and you don&#39;t want to fight once you know that you can be heard <br/>
without it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I went from one thing to another here. Thanks for listening. <br/>
I&#39;m going to go play now.<br/>

<br/>
My dd is 9, almost 10.<br/>
Here are some of her favorite computer games:<br/>
<br/>
The Sims2 & all its variations.<br/>
Viva Pinata<br/>
Zoo Tycoon<br/>
Roller Coaster Tycoon<br/>
Zoombinis - all 3 of them (Island Odyssey, Logical Journey, Mountain Rescue)<br/>
<br/>
Spore Creature Creator<br/>

She also plays these online games -<br/>
imvu.com<br/>
toontown.com<br/>
webkinz.com<br/>

There are probably more I&#39;m not thinking of.<br/>
I&#39;ll ask her when she wakes up...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105588099">We do www.WildGames.com right now.  They have lots and lots and lots <br/>
of games, and each game has a free 1-hour demo period.  Then you pay <br/>
like $13/mo for I think 75 &quot;wild coins&quot; to play the games with (and <br/>
you can download an unlimited # of demos without paying <br/>
anything)--games are from 1-6 coins each play after the demo <br/>
period.  That way you can try a bunch of different games and see what <br/>
each of you like, and anything you like, you can buy (most cost, <br/>
$19.99, and there are usually coupons for $5 off, and they discount a <br/>
certain amount (25 cents?) for each &quot;coin&quot; you&#39;ve spent playing that <br/>
game online--my dd has recently decided that Fate is the coolest game <br/>
around, and I think I paid $9 for it ($19.99-$5 coupon-$6 discount <br/>
for online plays)--meanwhile, if she&#39;s not in the mood for that, if <br/>
she or anyone else in the family wants to find a new game, we can get <br/>
them at the website and try them out. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381578830">I use a similar site, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/">http://www.bigfishgames.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I paid for a 6 month subscription and then cancelled it.  You can<br/>
still use the game club credits after you cancel the subscription.<br/>
They only let you install the game 3 times (I thought it was 5, but a<br/>
customer service rep told me it was 3).  I think the games were 8<br/>
dollars each with that subscription.  They also have free trials where<br/>
you can play any game for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
I have been playing smaller games that you can play for shorter<br/>
perionds of time as that is works best for me now.  Recently I&#39;ve been<br/>
playing Fairway Solitaire.  My 5 yo daughter really likes it as well.<br/>
The other video games she plays are on www.uptoten.com and also some<br/>
slightly dated kids games that we bought online.  I&#39;ve heard good<br/>
things about freddie the fish, pajama sam and other games by that<br/>
studio (Humongous Entertainment, I think) but she was a little too<br/>
young for them last time we tried.  She might like them now.<br/>
<br/>
PC games I like:<br/>
<br/>
Fairway Solitaire<br/>
Sudoku Latin Squares (has normal sudoku and a really nice, and much<br/>
harder, variation)<br/>
Cradle of Rome (Cradle of Persia is fine too)<br/>
Super collapse 3<br/>
The Scruffs (play it w/DD - hidden object game.  They usually annoy me<br/>
but this one doesn&#39;t for some odd reason)<br/>
Professor Fizzwizzle<br/>
<br/>
When I had more time to play in a stretch, I really liked the Sims and<br/>
RPGs.  My daughter and I had fun playing Paper Mario (virtual console<br/>
game) on the Wii  and hanging out.  It&#39;s a turn based RPG so it was ok<br/>
if she was really slow.  I played it first and after I beat the game<br/>
she wanted to try it.<br/>

My belief about unschooling is that other than the hour it takes to create a <br/>
report for the State, if you live somewhere that mandates reporting, you <br/>
never have to worry about what your child is learning while living their <br/>
passions. They are learning.<br/>
<br/>
If they want to engage in the activity, then it is fulfilling their desire <br/>
to learn and experience for that time.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t &quot;give in and let her&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Actively facilitate and encourage her. Make sure her chair is comfortable. <br/>
Bring food and drinks. Ask her questions. Check if there are updates for the <br/>
software. Look for strategy guides or magazines about the games.<br/>
<br/>
If there are essential errands in which she must participate, give her <br/>
plenty of warning and let her get to a good save point (if applicable).<br/>
<br/>
Strewing will never &quot;work&quot; while you have an ulterior motive. Try strewing <br/>
more games that are similar to those she already enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
You make a joke in your sig line about Fibromyalgia - the anger at people <br/>
who don&#39;t believe that it is real, what you are feeling and know to be true. <br/>
You want people to trust and acknowledge that you are feeling what you are <br/>
feeling, right?<br/>
<br/>
Well trust and acknowledge that she is enjoying and learning, learnng what <br/>
is important to her, which *is* all inside her own head.<br/>
<br/>
And if you do have to translate it all into educationese for reporting <br/>
purposes - oh we can help with that. But not yet, at the start of the <br/>
&quot;school year&quot;. Later, when it matters for a minute.<br/>

about Wall-E.  He makes videos... about Wall-E.  He write vocabulary<br/>

learning and if you do what Robyn suggested then perhaps she might branch<br/>
out and do some other things like starting a blog or running an online or<br/>
real life group for people who play these games.  if she feels like you are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566763016">My 5yo daughter spent many hours this summer watching &quot;Little Toot&quot;.  the rest of us were beyond sick of her movie, but she kept on, learning about weather, oceans, geography, dolphins, whales, tugboats, and many other things...then she began to memorize the music, then sing, then dance - and one day, to help her brother dance with her, she choreographed her dance in chart form!<br/>
<br/>
After that, it was Little Toot books...the original, Through the Golden Gate, On the Mississippi, and On the Thames.  a few readings into each, she&#39;s figuring out double-digit numbers, asking meanings of words most people don&#39;t learn until much later in life, and learning about bayous, England, explosives, maritime etiquette, and watercolor art....and this is just a fraction of what she&#39;s asked....which I am sure is, in turn, just a fraction of what she&#39;s learned...<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo son has just recently become deeply passionate about Pokemon.  He is gradually upgrading and adding to his gaming collection.  When we could not provide the DS he wanted when he wanted, he used his savings to buy one on Ebay.  He set his own budget,and dictated the bids.  I helped, but it was his project.<br/>
<br/>
A new game or system will often send him to his room for hours each day, as he works his way through the game.  When he emerges with tales of his progress, it&#39;s often accompanied by questions like, &#39;if you could control the world, what would you do first? second? Third? fourth?&quot;  It&#39;s clear to see that the gaming is opening him up to bigger concepts and philosophies.   <br/>
<br/>
My guess is that the learning at your house is no less breathtaking - you just aren&#39;t used to looking at it without &quot;there needs to be some learning happening here, and I need to see it and think it&#39;s important for it to count.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s passionate about gaming, she&#39;s learning plenty about her world! <br/>

&gt; Yes she is learning, yes it is your hang up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My belief about unschooling is that other than the hour it takes to create a <br/>
&gt; report for the State, if you live somewhere that mandates reporting, you <br/>
&gt; never have to worry about what your child is learning while living their <br/>
&gt; passions. They are learning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If they want to engage in the activity, then it is fulfilling their desire <br/>
&gt; to learn and experience for that time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t &quot;give in and let her&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actively facilitate and encourage her. Make sure her chair is comfortable. <br/>
&gt; Bring food and drinks. Ask her questions. Check if there are updates for the <br/>
&gt; software. Look for strategy guides or magazines about the games.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If there are essential errands in which she must participate, give her <br/>
&gt; plenty of warning and let her get to a good save point (if applicable).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Strewing will never &quot;work&quot; while you have an ulterior motive. Try strewing <br/>
&gt; more games that are similar to those she already enjoys.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You make a joke in your sig line about Fibromyalgia - the anger at people <br/>
&gt; who don&#39;t believe that it is real, what you are feeling and know to be true. <br/>
&gt; You want people to trust and acknowledge that you are feeling what you are <br/>
&gt; feeling, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well trust and acknowledge that she is enjoying and learning, learnng what <br/>
&gt; is important to her, which *is* all inside her own head.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if you do have to translate it all into educationese for reporting <br/>
&gt; purposes - oh we can help with that. But not yet, at the start of the <br/>
&gt; &quot;school year&quot;. Later, when it matters for a minute.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to look past this and just keep getting stuck. My daughter wants <br/>
&gt; to spend all her time playing fusionfall.com and wizard101.com I know that <br/>
&gt; as an unschooling Mom I should just give in and let her but what is she <br/>
&gt; learning. She&#39;s been stuck on these games for months and can&#39;t get past <br/>
&gt; them. I wish she&#39;d do other things with her time and I&#39;ve done extensive <br/>
&gt; strewing and it doesn&#39;t work. She&#39;s only 8 and I feel she needs to be <br/>
&gt; learning but isn&#39;t with these games. I know it&#39;s my hang up but please help <br/>
&gt; LOL<br/>
&gt; =^..^= BrendaMarie<br/>
&gt; God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.<br/>
&gt; The courage to change the things I can.<br/>
&gt; And the wisdom to know where to hide the bodies<br/>
&gt; of anyone who says &quot;You&#39;re perfectly healthy, Fibromyalgia is all in your <br/>
&gt; head.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This is antagonistic.   &quot;As an unschooling Mom&quot; there&#39;s not a &quot;should  <br/>
give in.&quot;  Is it you vs. her?  One wins and one loses?<br/>
<br/>
First be her partner.    She loves those games for some reason.  Have  <br/>
you played them?  Have you watched her play them?  You probably know  <br/>
what she&#39;s learning or liking about it.  If you don&#39;t, that&#39;s where  <br/>
the problem is.<br/>
<br/>
Be with her, not just physically, but emotionally and at the edge of  <br/>
her curiosity and her learning.  Help her make connections.  Make her  <br/>
comfortable and put drinks and food  near her while she&#39;s playing.<br/>
