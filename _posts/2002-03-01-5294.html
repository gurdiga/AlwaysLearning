well. She was very concerned for him. When I emailed that he had indeed <br/>
died, she sent Casey a note that broght *me* to tears. She told her how <br/>
happy and content he was at her house and how she believed he was waiting to <br/>
be with Casey before he died. I&#39;m telling you, the respect and tenderness <br/>
being shown my daughter is overwhelming.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535915761">Sorry to hear about Casey&#39;s hamster dying.<br/>
My son Jonathan has a hamster (since this past summer) named Twinkles and she is the cutest and sweetest little thing. He really loves her and so do I.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure Tiny will be sorely missed.<br/>
My condolences. ;&#39;-&#92;<br/>

Well, we&#39;ve been dealing with a death in the family here today. :o( Casey&#39;s <br/>
beloved hamster, Tiny, died yesterday. He lived a good life and appeared to <br/>
die of old age. Casey is still very distraught.<br/>
<br/>
We prepared a traditional Egyptian sarcophagus for him out of an old <br/>
checkbook box. We have interred him with bedding and food for his trip to <br/>
the otherside, and Casey placed jewels (beads) and treasures for him as <br/>
well. We had an open casket viewing last night and hope to be able to break <br/>
through the frozen Utah soil to bury him soon.<br/>
<br/>
Today was spent finding old pictures of Tiny, marvelling at how much he <br/>
really did age in the past two years, and creating a lovely photo montage in <br/>
his honor.<br/>
<br/>
He will be missed.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073691120">Emimly&#39;s hamster went missing this morning. The Wheel that attaches to the<br/>
cave came off somehow and Princess got out. We&#39;ve search everywhere adn<br/>
can&#39;t find her. There&#39;s no body parts anywhere so it appears that the cats<br/>
didn&#39;t get her but there&#39;s no evidence of her hiding either. (poop) We put<br/>
the cage back on teh floor withone hole open adn Emily will put some veggies<br/>
around to entice but I&#39;m not too hopeful. The cats are in teh bedroom.<br/>
Can hamsters climb stairs? My assumption is that she&#39;ll go DOWN but not up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Uh Oh! Hope the little critter turns up healthy and happy. :-/ I read your <br/>
note to Casey and she sends all her good Karma for the hamster&#39;s safe <br/>
return. She would also like to know where you live. I have no clue why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831812401">We had a gerbil go missing once.  They seem to behave<br/>
in similar patterns to mice and hamsters.  Thet is<br/>
they perambulate the outside edge of the environment. <br/>
They make a corridor all around the edge of the house.<br/>
 Through the wall, if they can, if they can&#39;t the come<br/>
in, go around the obstacle and then back.  They stash<br/>
stuff to eat near the source (cearal box, rice bag,<br/>
acorns) and the droppings are anywhere along the<br/>
route.  Nesting materials will accumulate along the<br/>
route, too, with a pile in a chosen spot, or two.  DS2<br/>
popped a cake pan lid over his, when I showed were it<br/>
would appear....sometime.<br/>
<br/>
An old fashioned box trap with the stick and string<br/>
might work, once you find Princess&#39; habitual haunts.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943810546">Have those of you with small mammals in your homes (besides the children, I<br/>
mean) read &quot;I, Houdini&quot;?  It&#39;s by Lynn Reid Banks and we have the audio<br/>
version which is read by her.  It&#39;s great!  Told from the hamsters POV, all<br/>
about the great adventures he has while escaped from his cage.<br/>
