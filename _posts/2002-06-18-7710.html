 </span></blockquote>Diatomaceous Earth is the hard shells of sea creatures. The shells have<br/>
sharp edges and tend to tear an insect up from the inside out. Diatomaceous<br/>
Earth is not harmful to humans or other large animals because they can not<br/>
do enough damage in our mostly liquid bodies to harm us. I use it a lot<br/>
here.. I put it on my goats for control of mites and lice.. I use it in the<br/>
chicken nest boxes and on the birds themselves. I just take care not to<br/>
breath it or get it in my eyes or my animals eyes. I also use it in the<br/>
garden when I must. I think its a pretty good alternative to chemicals. It<br/>
would kill butterflies, bees and ladybugs too tho..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742387972">&lt;&lt;How does it affect the good guys?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My guess would be that it would kill good and bad alike.  I plan on using it<br/>
just in the front and back yards to get rid of the fleas and fire ants.<br/>
<br/>
The guy at the pool supply place said you don&#39;t need to use very much but<br/>
that you don&#39;t want to go around breathing the stuff in that it can damage<br/>
your lungs.<br/>
<br/>
However, I know of goat people who dust their animals with it ever so often<br/>
as well as spreading it under bedding material in pens.<br/>
