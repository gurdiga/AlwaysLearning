  &gt;&gt;Yesterday Marty showed me his pubic hair.   Yes, I twinged too.<br/>
  It was on his upper lip.  He said, &quot;Look, mom; pubic hair&quot; and indicated<br/>
  moustache stuff.   Holly and I acted appropriately shocked and averted our<br/>
  eyes and squealed and said &quot;Don&#39;t Show Us!  It&#39;s not right&quot; and such.  But<br/>
  he<br/>
  said he figures leg hairiness, underarm hair and moustache are all pubic<br/>
  hair<br/>
  because he got them from puberty.<br/>
<br/>
  eeek!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  A fine opportunity to drop in a little historical trivia.  Remember the<br/>
  Clarence Thomas conformation hearings?  Anita Hill testified that he<br/>
  made a tasteless joke about pubic hair, saying he had found one on his<br/>
  can of soda?  The media went kind of crazy saying &quot;pubic hair&quot; over and<br/>
  over, like they were little kids having fun grossing out their friends. <br/>
  But I&#39;m pretty sure the underlying story was that he had just used a<br/>
  hair from his head for an opportunity for some obnoxious adolescent humor.<br/>
<br/>
  Confirmation hearings for presidential appointments can be such a circus!<br/>
<br/>
  Everything is educational!<br/>
<br/>
  Do I even WANT to know if pubic hair has any other entries in the great<br/>
  encyclopedia of history?  Maybe not!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368968145">Actually, if you look into Girl Scouts, the girls are *supposed* to <br/>
pretty much decide what activities they do, what badges they earn, <br/>
and how they spend the money they make on cookies.  Of course the <br/>
older they get, the more freedom they&#39;re supposed to get.  For <br/>
example, Brownie meetings (grades 1-3) are usually pre-planned by the <br/>
leader but the juniors (grades 4-6)are supposed to start planning a <br/>
lot of what they do on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
It is very easy to become a girl scout leader. If you tell them you <br/>
want a troop, they&#39;ll give it to you and you&#39;ll have girls signed up <br/>
almost immediately.  At least that&#39;s how it is in my area--they seem <br/>
to be very short on leaders. If you want a girl scout troop that is <br/>
not authoritarian, you could have that kind of troop.  <br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t like about it is that it is only for girls, not their <br/>
families.  I have a daughter who wants to have fun meeting girls her <br/>
age but of course I always have to have my boys tag along with me and <br/>
I don&#39;t want them only hanging out with girls.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could create our own unschool-family friendly-non <br/>
authoritarian scout group!<br/>

why do Girl Scouts? Why not do Campfire Boys and Girls or 4-H? Girl Scouts <br/>
really IS for girls only - intentionally.<br/>

You do have to take training, but it&#39;s not horrid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have campfire boys and girls around here.  A 4-H group just <br/>
started but it&#39;s not a group of kids getting together to hang out and <br/>
decide on fun activities to do together.  They are doing nature <br/>
journals and each child is trying to recreate a bird&#39;s nest.  That&#39;s <br/>
fine if you want to do that kind of activity, but dd didn&#39;t find <br/>
nature journals and bird nest making to be activities that she wanted <br/>
to devote time to.  <br/>
<br/>
What would be ideal would be to get a group of homeschooled kids <br/>
together to do that kind of thing.  It seems hard to get <br/>
homeschoolers together for that sort of thing sometimes, but I would <br/>
like to see  us get together and ask the kids what kind of activities <br/>
they want to do together.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of the already-organized groups, the advantage is lots of pretty nice <br/>
informational resources -- but you could use those anyway, of course. Boy <br/>
Scouts has these great little booklets on every subject in the world, for <br/>
example. Girl Scout badge books have a lot of ideas of things to do.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise -- the best way I&#39;ve found to get hsed kids together for any kind <br/>
of activities is to make some offers to a few kids and see if they bite. <br/>
Sometimes you have to do the activity once or twice just to give them the <br/>
idea of what they&#39;re getting into.Think about the kids and think about what <br/>
you think they might enjoy. I run a Destination Imagination group here  --  <br/>
it is a combination of improvisational theater and structure building <br/>
challenges. I thought that there were kids that would like those two <br/>
different aspects - some liking improv more than the structure stuff and vice <br/>
versa, and I was right. They loved it last year and we&#39;re doing it again this <br/>
year. Lots of times just asking what activities they want to do isn&#39;t enough- <br/>
they don&#39;t really know what they COULD do. I like &quot;demo&quot; days -- everybody <br/>
knows it is a one-shot deal and they&#39;re aren&#39;t committing to anything by <br/>
trying it out one time.<br/>
