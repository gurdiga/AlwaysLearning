I looked hard for Japanese clipart. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
That was fun all by itself!!<br/>
<br/>
This one is about all my kids being analytical at an age earlier than I think <br/>
I was.  I remember thinking things when I was little, but I don&#39;t remember <br/>
being very encouraged about it.  <br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a confession of a really bad mom-moment on my part.<br/>

particularly love, &quot;Instead of being my mother&#39;s child, I am my children&#39;s<br/>

so similar to mine - and so unfortunately unusual.  I&#39;ll save this one :0).<br/>

<br/>
Thanks. <br/>
<br/>
I kinda like the swirliness of  it, things going backward and forward in <br/>
time, and my mom being there in texture but not in person.  &quot;How did your mom <br/>
explain it to you&quot; just gave me the chills when  Holly asked me.  It SO <br/>
indicated that she didn&#39;t and will probably never know how different my life <br/>
was.  And that being tired late at night and swatting a BABY, a two year old, <br/>
for playing happily was the evil ghost of my mom on a bad day.<br/>
<br/>
I was apprehensive about ever having sent that out in the first place, but if <br/>
people hide their sins, if I hide my failures, then it&#39;s probably won&#39;t be as <br/>
helpful as if I edit my life to seem better than it is. I&#39;m out of words for <br/>
this, and Holly and I need to leave to see Peter Pan in just a minute.  <br/>
Musical Theatre of the Southwest is putting it on at Popejoy Hall (for those <br/>
familiar with UNM  or Albuquerque).<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s really cool is Holly had quit fiddle lessons.  When she wanted to go <br/>
back the teacher was all booked up (AND his bluegrass band has lots of work <br/>
now, plus he&#39;s already a fully employed homeschooling dad).   But he <br/>
recommended another teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The other teacher, he said, would do fiddle or classical, whichever.<br/>
<br/>
I told her Holly had been doing bluegrass/old-timey because Jeff liked that, <br/>
but what Holly&#39;s real interest was was musical theatre.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;WHAT?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She asked it strangely, and I said, &quot;Well, she likes musicals, but the tunes <br/>
are really too hard for her as a beginner, and..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I LOVE musicals.  I&#39;m concert master for Musical Theatre of the Southwest!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH.  COOL!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So today was Holly&#39;s first lesson with Linda Vik, and now we&#39;re leaving to <br/>
see Peter Pan, and will peek over and see the first-chair violinist, Linda <br/>
Vik!  <br/>
<br/>
Totally cool.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement and compliment, Rue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435700209">Thank you, yet again, Sandra. Have you always kept a<br/>
diary? When I was young I kept a poetry and sketch<br/>
sort of diary. But I was never able to articulate<br/>
wanting to provide a different childhood for my<br/>
children (than my own) without wallowing. Or is that<br/>
foundering? Except in the emotional shorthand of<br/>
poetry.<br/>
<br/>
Are the fires too close?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Are the fires too close? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not this year.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I was never able to articulate<br/>
wanting to provide a different childhood for my<br/>
children (than my own) without wallowing. Or is that<br/>
foundering? Except in the emotional shorthand of<br/>
poetry..&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do poetry.  Not a talent of mine.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times I kept personal diaries for a while, but they embarrass <br/>
me a ton! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But writing what my kids have done seemed less self-indulgent (or something) <br/>
and so I could do that without feeling like I was studying myself <br/>
contemplating my own navel.<br/>
<br/>
I have a journal I kept for a human sexuality course in college.  I re-read a <br/>
big chunk of it the other day. Yikes.  I was not at that time yet aware of <br/>
the cause of my mom&#39;s sexual uptightness (raped by her brother when she was <br/>
9, he was 14/15 I think).  I hadn&#39;t yet realized that some of her <br/>
child-rearing practices were ignorant crap, so there are a couple of places <br/>
where I kind of brag her up for something I wouldn&#39;t do to a dog today.<br/>
<br/>
So I suppose it was good, even though embarrassing, for me to see where I <br/>
COULD have ended up if I hadn&#39;t pursued truth&#39;n&#39;light (lite) which, for me, <br/>
took the form of Adult Children of Alcoholics and La Leche League all in the <br/>
space of a year and a half.   <br/>
<br/>
Lights were flooding on all over.<br/>
