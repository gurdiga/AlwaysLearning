Pat, my son got a Smithsonian chemistry set for<br/>
Christmas and I thought, cool, because it says<br/>
Smithsonian, right? Wrong. The instructions weren&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009355759">Karen, that is a really cool site.  I ordered some placemats, a Civil War game, a bird feeder kit, and a poster.  The prices are very reasonable.  <br/>
<br/>
We live near Gettysburg and Antietam and I feel like getting into some Civil War stuff and visiting those places this spring.  We&#39;ve never taken the kids there.<br/>

A while back I subbed onto some other lists that<br/>
called themselves unschooling lists, in order to lurk<br/>
awhile, see what was going on.  Well, I&#39;m going nuts<br/>
with not butting in.  I&#39;ve unsubbed from several, but<br/>
there may be hope for others.....though I&#39;m not a good<br/>
evangalist. I&#39;m more of the &quot;Don&#39;t Tread On Me&quot; type<br/>
of Rebel. May I post a link to your website on some of<br/>
these lists, before I unsub from them? Or is it more<br/>
inline with online ettiquette to just let them be?<br/>

WHY didn&#39;t the stuff work?  There is chemistry<br/>
everywhere.  Hey!  You could blow up eggs in the<br/>
microwave! I once blew up some in a regular pot on the<br/>
stove top.  Left them to hardboil and forgot.  When I<br/>
came home, the pot was welded to the burner and the<br/>
eggs were eveywhere.  On the textured ceiling, behind<br/>
the refrigerator, underneath the uphigh cupboards, one<br/>
all of the exterior surfaces of everything.  Wish I<br/>
had observed this!  <br/>
<br/>
There is the baking soda and vinigar comination, that<br/>
goes a long way for &quot;food for thought&quot;.  Actually all<br/>
cooking is chemistry.  Dyes and mordants are<br/>
chemistry.<br/>
Medicine is chemistry.  Compost and fertilizer is<br/>
chemistry, the weather is chemistry.....you really<br/>
can&#39;t avoid chemistry.  It is sort of like art and<br/>
craft materials.  Everywhere.<br/>

We had been camping, and came home and unloaded everything, cleaned up and <br/>
went to dinner in a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
When we got back, there was stinky raw egg on LOTS of stuff.  We had broken <br/>
eggs into a tupperware container so we didn&#39;t have to take care of fresh <br/>
whole eggs.  The container had been in the cooler, and we hadn&#39;t used all the <br/>
eggs.  So when the cooler was unloaded and it was left on the table, it <br/>
warmed up in the house and KABLOOIE!<br/>
<br/>
Missed it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323745552">The discussion about chemistry has led me to begin thinking about what people like about different things.  My 10 yo dd likes working with numbers in a structured way.  She likes making lists and graphs and she even likes *playing* flashcards with her ps friends.  My 12 yo dd does not like working with numbers in the same way as 10 yo dd but loves patterns and all kinds of games.  I could either say both of my kids like math or both of my kids don&#39;t like math and I would be correct in each statement.  This is because there are different things about math to like and dislike.  One might enjoy being an auditor the other an engineer, both are math related.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to helping my children figure out what they like about things and why.  I love gardening and cooking but I&#39;m not at all interested in the nuts and bolts of either.  I&#39;m more interested in the sensory experience and the creativity.  I&#39;m assuming the key will be in the questions they ask and how other interests they have relate to each other.   Anyone else have observations about their kids that I could add to my mental database?<br/>

up upon opening. Things like shampoo, lotion, conditioner, even toothpaste <br/>
start oozing out at an alarming rate once you reopen them at altitude. We&#39;re <br/>
at 6500 feet currently, but it happened at 5,000 feet too. That&#39;s one <br/>
experiment that never fails. :-D And my kids are becoming experts on air <br/>
pressure.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Chemistry sets go, we also had the Smithsonian one. Too schooly <br/>
for us. We never used it much. The Totally Gross Chemisrty set gets used a <br/>
lot and the reactions actually work. It uses lots of household stuff so that <br/>
the kids understand that chemical reactions are happening all around them.<br/>

Krampf does shows around the country at museums and schools.  We saw one<br/>

Robert Krampf&#39;s Experiment of the Week<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   <br/>
This Week&#39;s Experiment - #252 Bubble Colors<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday season.  I came across the<br/>
idea for this week&#39;s while searching for the website of Tom Noddy.  Tom is<br/>
the original bubble man (and in my opinion, still the best.)  He planted the<br/>
seed for my decision to go into business for myself.  I met him while I was<br/>
working at the Memphis Pink Palace Museum.  He was doing a weekend of shows<br/>
at the museum and got to see me doing an electricity show.  He told me that<br/>
I should take the show on the road.  That was back in 1987.  It has been a<br/>
long and wonderful road so far, and hopefully it is far from over. <br/>
<br/>
While looking over Tom&#39;s website (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomnoddy.com/index.html)">http://www.tomnoddy.com/index.html)</a>, I<br/>
thought another bubble experiment would be fun.  This one is very simple,<br/>
but if you start to dig into it, it can become as complex as you want.  You<br/>
might be surprised to hear how much time mathematics professors spend<br/>
talking about bubbles.  For today, we will keep it simple.  You will need:<br/>
<br/>
a clear drinking glass water soap (I used Dawn dishwashing soap) a drinking<br/>
straw<br/>
<br/>
Fill the glass about 1/4 of the way with water.  Add a few drops of soap. <br/>
Stir this with the straw to spread the soap around and then blow through the<br/>
straw to make some bubbles.  Examine the bubbles and notice their shapes. <br/>
Stand with the glass of bubbles in your hand and with a strong light behind<br/>
you.  As you turn the glass, you should begin to see bright colors.  Where<br/>
two bubbles touch, they form a flat surface and these flat surfaces are<br/>
where you will see the bright yellows, blues, reds and greens.  What causes<br/>
these colors?<br/>
<br/>
To find out, move the straw around to pop most of the bubbles and start<br/>
again.  This time, as soon as you blow the bubbles, hold up the glass and<br/>
look for the colors.  Where are they?  Watch for a few seconds and you will<br/>
see them begin to appear.  As you watch, the colors will become brighter and<br/>
brighter.  Why is that?  What is changing as time passes?<br/>
<br/>
The change is the thickness of the bubble.  When you first blow the bubbles,<br/>
the film of water and soap is fairly thick.  As you watch, the water begins<br/>
to drain out of the bubbles, flowing downwards into the glass.  As the film<br/>
of the bubble gets thinner and thinner, something wonderful begins to<br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
This is where things get a little more complex.  Don&#39;t let this scare you<br/>
into stopping, because it truly is amazing.  If you have ever seen a<br/>
rainbow, you know that white light is made up of many different colors.  The<br/>
rainbow separates the colors by bending each one at a different angle.  With<br/>
the bubble, bending the colors to separate them, we remove some colors, so<br/>
that we see the others. <br/>
<br/>
To understand how the colors are removed, we need to think of light as<br/>
waves. One of the weird things about light is that sometimes it acts as if<br/>
it is made up of tiny particles and sometimes it acts as it if is made up of<br/>
waves. For now, we will think of it as acting like waves.  If you have ever<br/>
watched waves, this will be much easier.  If you have not, then go take a<br/>
bath.  While you are getting clean, make waves in the tub and watch<br/>
carefully what they do.  You will notice that when a wave hits the side of<br/>
the tub, it bounces back.  Light does the same thing, and we call it<br/>
reflecting.  Part of the light hitting the surface of the bubble goes on<br/>
through and part of it bounces back or reflects back towards you.  Of the<br/>
light that goes on into the bubble, more of it is reflected back when it<br/>
hits the inside surface. <br/>
<br/>
When the light that reflects from the outer surface mixes with the light<br/>
reflecting from the inner surface, something so strange happens that it<br/>
might seem like magic.  The light that continued on to reflect from the<br/>
inner surface had to travel a tiny bit farther (the thickness of the bubble<br/>
film) than the light reflected from the outer surface.  This means that the<br/>
two sets of waves are slightly out of step.  If this difference is just<br/>
right, some of the waves will cancel each other out and that color will seem<br/>
to be missing.  Starting with white light, if the difference in the two sets<br/>
of waves is enough to cancel out the red light, then you would see a<br/>
blue-green color.  If the color yellow is canceled, you would see blue, and<br/>
so on. <br/>
<br/>
The difference in the two sets of waves is controlled by the thickness of<br/>
the bubble.  As the water drains from the bubble, the film gets thinner. <br/>
When it is thin enough, the two sets of reflected light reach the right<br/>
level and you begin to see the colors.  Different thicknesses give you<br/>
different colors.  With a round bubble, the colors seem to swirl, because<br/>
the curved surface means you are looking through different thicknesses,<br/>
depending on the angle.  When two bubbles are connected they form the flat<br/>
surface that we have been looking at.  Since it is a flat surface, the<br/>
thicknesses are more even and easier to see.  The film is thicker at the<br/>
bottom and thinner at the top, forming bands of color.  You can even see<br/>
difference in this thickness as water flows through the bubble, producing<br/>
swirls of color.<br/>
<br/>
This same process, called destructive interference, happens other places<br/>
besides bubbles.  It is what produces the iridescence seen in insect wings,<br/>
the rainbows seen from a film of oil on wet asphalt, and the beautiful<br/>
colors of the New Zealand paua shells that I had so much fun collecting last<br/>
year. <br/>
<br/>
Well, this is getting far too long, so I will stop here, but you don&#39;t have<br/>
to.  With a little research, you can find all sorts of wonders hiding in a<br/>
soap bubble.  I hope you all have a safe and happy holiday season. <br/>

I realize this is a prejudice but one I have come to through observation.  I prefer to describe the unschooling that is proposed on this list as &quot;ultimate unschooling&quot;.

&lt;&lt;  I could either say both of my kids like math or both of my kids don&#39;t <br/>
like math and I would be correct in each statement.  This is because there <br/>
are different things about math to like and dislike.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I purposely did NOT teach my kids the concepts of &quot;disciplines&quot; (like &quot;math&quot; <br/>
and &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science&quot;) because I knew that kids in school will decide <br/>
that because they care zip about Columbus sailing the ocean blue in fourteen <br/>
hundred ninety two that they HATE history.  Or that because they don&#39;t care <br/>
about worms and bugs that they HATE science.<br/>
<br/>
So we had in our lives explorers, and bugs, and Romans and cowboys and <br/>
samurai and waterflow and snow and rocks and trees, but never, ever, history <br/>
or science or geography or anything by names like that.  Just the world, as <br/>
one big subject.  Or individual parts of it, for their own merit and <br/>
enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
I kept that secret.  They discovered the terms on their own later, from other <br/>
kids or TV or whatever, but by that time they were totally unable to say they <br/>
didn&#39;t like one or the other of those large concepts.<br/>
<br/>
No aversions to affect their perceptions of other things related only by <br/>
school terminology.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Actually all<br/>

&gt; &gt;cooking is chemistry. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And one of my favorite kinds of cooking chemistry is<br/>
&gt; candymaking. I work as<br/>
&gt; a candymaker sometimes. When I started learning how,<br/>
&gt; I really got &quot;cooking<br/>
&gt; is chemistry,&quot; because it&#39;s so easy to see how one<br/>
&gt; small error in measuring<br/>
&gt; can cause big changes or even disasters. Changes in<br/>
&gt; humidity and air<br/>
&gt; temperature make big differences in your end product<br/>
&gt; too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But if you make brittle you can see the<br/>
&gt; vinegar/baking soda deal and eat it<br/>
&gt; too. If you mess around with chocolate (real<br/>
&gt; chocolate, not the melting<br/>
&gt; stuff) you can learn about melting it, dipping,<br/>
&gt; drying it, tempering it,<br/>
&gt; why it grays, and horrors, what happens if you get a<br/>
&gt; drop of water in it.<br/>
&gt; If you make fudge by making a sugar syrup you can<br/>
&gt; learn about why it grains<br/>
&gt; and why it comes out really smooth. If you make<br/>
&gt; marshamallow and divinty<br/>
&gt; you can learn how to take sugar, water, egg whites,<br/>
&gt; and vanilla and make<br/>
&gt; two really different things. Marshamallow and<br/>
&gt; divinty are essentially the<br/>
&gt; same, you just use different proportions, cook the<br/>
&gt; syrups to different<br/>
&gt; temps, plus  marshmallow has gelatin in it. The<br/>
&gt; whole deal of how you can<br/>
&gt; cook sugar and water to different temperatures and<br/>
&gt; have really different<br/>
&gt; things happen is interesting. And how adding air to<br/>
&gt; mixtures changes them<br/>
&gt; is interesting too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lot of this stuff you can do at home.  And it<br/>
&gt; usually tastes really good,<br/>
&gt; even the things that aren&#39;t perfect. The very best<br/>
&gt; candy really is made<br/>
&gt; with the simplest ingredients, I think.<br/>

My normal way of doing a project with the girls would be to direct them in the &quot;proper&quot; way to do the thing but I&#39;m getting the sense that might not be the best way.  If I say let&#39;s put oatmeal in this soap because it will make it scratchy and tell them why we would want scratchy soap, I&#39;ve taken all the discovery out of everything.  If I buy all the soap making stuff and say you decide how you want to use this, we usually will not have a finished product.  What is the best way to help them discover and yet minimize frustration?<br/>

Hmm. The ru I&#39;m on has no wrangling. It&#39;s very, very quiet, maybe 10<br/>
posts a month It&#39;s mostly the TCS crowd, hosted on interversity now but<br/>
that&#39;s a recent change.<br/>

I was briefly on various other Unschooling and Radical Unschooling lists,<br/>
but I was unimpressed and left quickly...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545182686">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Pat, my son got a Smithsonian chemistry set for<br/>
Christmas and I thought, cool, because it says<br/>
Smithsonian, right? Wrong. The instructions weren&#39;t<br/>
clear, the experiments didn&#39;t work, and nothing smoked<br/>
or blew up, which really disappointed ds. Have you<br/>
tried Tobin Scientific? www.tobinlab.com<br/>
<br/>
Mattie&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tamzin got a Smithsonian Pet Vet kit and it was<br/>
rubbish. It cost $20 and all it had in it was a<br/>
disposable stethoscope, gauze bandages, a toothbrush,<br/>
a mini plastic magnifying lens, and a thin paper<br/>
booklet about how to give your pet a check up. She was<br/>
really disappointed.<br/>

when a woman who lived in Sonoma county, CA and someone on the east<br/>

day and 80% was from those two.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760044545">I highly recommend a book called &quot;Super Science Concoctions&quot;.  It tells how <br/>
to make many of the chemistry cooking experiments talked about recently.  My <br/>
family&#39;s favorite is very simple.  1 cup water and about 2 and a half cups <br/>
of cornstarch.  Mix together.  Try rolling some in your hands and then stop, <br/>
watch what happens.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually all<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;cooking is chemistry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And one of my favorite kinds of cooking chemistry is candymaking. I work as<br/>
&gt;a candymaker sometimes. When I started learning how, I really got &quot;cooking<br/>
&gt;is chemistry,&quot; because it&#39;s so easy to see how one small error in measuring<br/>
&gt;can cause big changes or even disasters. Changes in humidity and air<br/>
&gt;temperature make big differences in your end product too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But if you make brittle you can see the vinegar/baking soda deal and eat it<br/>
&gt;too. If you mess around with chocolate (real chocolate, not the melting<br/>
&gt;stuff) you can learn about melting it, dipping, drying it, tempering it,<br/>
&gt;why it grays, and horrors, what happens if you get a drop of water in it.<br/>
&gt;If you make fudge by making a sugar syrup you can learn about why it grains<br/>
&gt;and why it comes out really smooth. If you make marshamallow and divinty<br/>
&gt;you can learn how to take sugar, water, egg whites, and vanilla and make<br/>
&gt;two really different things. Marshamallow and divinty are essentially the<br/>
&gt;same, you just use different proportions, cook the syrups to different<br/>
&gt;temps, plus  marshmallow has gelatin in it. The whole deal of how you can<br/>
&gt;cook sugar and water to different temperatures and have really different<br/>
&gt;things happen is interesting. And how adding air to mixtures changes them<br/>
&gt;is interesting too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A lot of this stuff you can do at home.  And it usually tastes really good,<br/>
&gt;even the things that aren&#39;t perfect. The very best candy really is made<br/>
&gt;with the simplest ingredients, I think.<br/>
