<div id="ygrps-yiv-798663642">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I am having fun looking at the multitude of unschooling blogs out there and would love to hear what you are finding to be your favorities?  I trying to put together a list of the best blogs out there.  My criteria is unschooling blogs that have been around for a while and post often and are up to date.  There are some fun reads out there.  Any thoughts?<br/>

This is mine... I have a few of my favorites listed however I haven&#39;t updated my favorite list in a while so some vital one are missing!  Blog of the Zombie Princess is a great blog with a cool blog roll.  Sandra&#39;s blog is neat because her blog roll lists recently updated blogs. (wish I knew how to do that!)  <br/>

I&#39;m doing a &quot;unschooling is...&quot; continuation post.  If others want to join in, you could comment with a link to your own &quot;unschooling is...&quot; post on any relevant ones that I&#39;ve posted thus far, or something new that strikes your fancy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can find the list of blogs I follow on my profile. Most of them are unschooling, but I have a some friends who range between eclectic and &quot;classical&quot; home learners and I&#39;ve included them, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also got a sidebar on my blog with some of my favourite unschooling blogs listed. These are my current favourites. I do tend to add to and delete from this list in a very unfaithful way... it just depends on my current mood (and who&#39;s keeping up on their blogging).<br/>
<br/>
My own blog is all over the place and is really for my mother (heh) and friends/family, so I&#39;m not sure it qualifies as an &quot;unschooling&quot; blog. You can find the link on my profile if you are interested in taking a peek.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, Jenny, you can do that through your blogger dashboard. Go to &quot;Layout&quot; and then choose &quot;Add a Gadget&quot;. Choose &quot;Blog List&quot; and then add your favourite blogs. You can choose how much info shows up on your sidebar. On my blog, I choose just the blog&#39;s title and the title of the latest post. And I choose to list them according to recently updated instead of alphabetical order. Have fun. :) :)<br/>
