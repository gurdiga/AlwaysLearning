<br/>
How can one understand something one hasn&#39;t practiced? <br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
In the case of something like that (family bed or unschooling) <br/>
I have a hard time &quot;understanding&quot; how someone could understand it yet fail <br/>
to do it.  But I understand Southern Baptists, and I understand why people <br/>
would be structured homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
If someone &quot;understands&quot; that smoking is bad for them, would they keep <br/>
smoking?<br/>
<br/>
I guess so.  I guess lots do.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that daily meditation is hugely beneficial to people and that <br/>
walking would make my ankle stronger, but here I sit.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s possible.  People have priorities and personal realities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It might be fun to look at what &quot;I know that&quot; means in various contexts in <br/>
and out of school situations.  At one time I must have known and understood <br/>
things about Jonathan Swift.  I have a letter on an old transcript that says I <br/>
proved I understood British satirists.  It didn&#39;t change my life. Shakespeare <br/>
did.  <br/>
<br/>
Language is really limited.<br/>
IfI say &quot;I understand you&#39;ve started shooting heroin&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;I <br/>
completely understand why you would choose to do so&quot; (though in the case of the <br/>
person I&#39;m thinking of, I do understand).   And I won&#39;t see her in person so <br/>
it won&#39;t come up.<br/>
