Now that I am convinced that I am dull and concerned about the well<br/>
being of my children, is there any real harm in *structuring* time to<br/>
play games from the &quot;Family Math&quot; book, do science experiments, watch<br/>
movies for &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science&quot;, do vocabulary cartoon books and<br/>
word puzzle books.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it is not unschooling but the hope is that I will<br/>
eventually get there.<br/>
<br/>
Is this harmful in anyway?<br/>

It&#39;s harmful to unschooling. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get there (there being<br/>
unschooling) by doing sorta-schooling and hoping the kids will become<br/>
noticeably-scholarly on their own time so you can give up the sorta.<br/>
<br/>
Is it harmful to your children? Probably not ferociously, if you take &quot;no&quot;<br/>
for an answer. If you insist that they do this pseudo-school stuff, IMHO<br/>
it&#39;s plenty harmful, as is any attempt at forcing learning. &quot;Games&quot;, like<br/>
any tool, can be used or mis-used. Motive matters. Who gets to decide<br/>
matters.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re dull, but &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;concerned about the well being<br/>
of my children&quot; aren&#39;t synonymous (if you really did mean to infer that<br/>
&quot;real unschoolers&quot; don&#39;t care about the well being of their children and<br/>
hence &quot;aren&#39;t dull&quot;, well, we&#39;ve heard that song before. It&#39;s an old tune.)<br/>

I feel almost as though the question is a trap, or that you&#39;re fishing for <br/>
reassurance.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I realize it is not unschooling but the hope is that I will <br/>

Why wait?<br/>
Why ask us to bless your waiting?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;is there any real harm in *structuring* time to <br/>
play games from the &quot;Family Math&quot; book, do science experiments, watch <br/>
movies for &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science&quot;, do vocabulary cartoon books and <br/>
word puzzle books.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you have scheduled educational activities and you know it isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling, and if you believe unschooling is good, why don&#39;t you unschool?<br/>
<br/>
There are people who don&#39;t believe it is harmful to force kids to &quot;finish <br/>
schoolwork&quot; on a schedule, so there is of course a continuum of thoughts <br/>
about what is best/good/harmful.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you want to do vocabulary cartoon books when you can just talk about <br/>
the things you see in the movies you watch which were NOT necessarily chosen f<br/>
or the historical or science content but which WILL, if you watch enough of <br/>
them, inevitably touch on science and history?<br/>
<br/>
If you play games with kids after lunch as a habit, that&#39;s not the same as <br/>
&quot;scheduling time,&quot; exactly, but why should they have to be math games all the <br/>
time?  And what if a child isn&#39;t in the mood to play? Or what if a child <br/>
wants to play games for three hours straight and it&#39;s not your scheduled time?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re thinking more about the schedule or about the subject areas than <br/>
about your child&#39;s happiness in the moment, you&#39;re just looking in the wrong <br/>
place, in my opinion.<br/>

(opening dictionary at random) &quot;smectic&quot; means &lt;g&gt;  If they were still<br/>
interested, we&#39;d look up &quot;tuba,&quot; and maybe look at the encyclopedia for John<br/>
Phillip Sousa, and maybe -- if their eyes haven&#39;t glazed over yet -- found a<br/>
piece of his music from our CD collection or on the Internet.  You can<br/>
sample tracks of CD&#39;s on bookselling websites like Barnes and Nobel.  Note,<br/>
I would stop before the glaze-eyes :-)  I try to answer the questions<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Neither would I.  I was discouraged from any but the most basic required<br/>
science classes, because I was so very bad at math.  I knew the word from<br/>
&quot;Star Trek,&quot; and from a family joke about &quot;inertia taking hold&quot; when we veg<br/>
on the couch.  You may not mention inertia, but you experience it any time<br/>
you slam on the brakes in your car.  I have a great book called &quot;How Science<br/>
Works&quot; that shows demonstrations of inertia, among many other things.  I<br/>
understood it much better after doing the fun kid experiment where you put a<br/>
ball in a wagon, pull the wagon and then stop it suddenly.<br/>
<br/>
Are you under the impression unschoolers don&#39;t do these kinds of things, or<br/>
that we don&#39;t have mountains of books, including texts, workbooks, history<br/>
books, etc.?  <br/>

dioxide on it?  I didn&#39;t know that until I had kids and cool books and stuff<br/>
we wanted to learn.  I&#39;ve gone through gallons of vinegar and pounds of<br/>
baking soda &lt;g&gt;  What&#39;s demonstrated by the experiment is that gases are<br/>
fluids.  I probably got that right on a test once, but I *learned* it doing<br/>
the fun experiment with my kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You understand unschooling already: it is living life without school.<br/>
Living without waiting for the class to start.  Skipping ahead in the<br/>
curriculum if what you want to know is at the end, rather than having to<br/>
wait for the day its scheduled.  It&#39;s Learning All the Time (and forever, no<br/>
matter how old you get).  YOU can show them the world.  And, if what they<br/>
most want to learn in the world is something that TOTALLY BORES YOU, you can<br/>
find &#39;em a tutor &lt;g&gt;  My kids will never learn to play video games from ME,<br/>
that&#39;s for sure -- and they know I&#39;m a hopeless pupil.<br/>

<br/>
Read &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot; by Frank Smith.<br/>
<br/>
Relearn joy.  Catch it from your kids.  Find a cocoon and watch it til the<br/>
moth emerges.  Or get a caterpillar, confine it with the right food, and<br/>
watch the whole process!  Get a book about butterflies and moths.  Discover<br/>
the world around you through your children&#39;s eyes.<br/>

The difference between what I am doing now and unschooling is *I* am <br/>
looking for things to learn about and then *I* show the kids what I <br/>
have found.  I am setting time aside each day to do these things.  <br/>
That is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
An unschooled child would feel inertia and ask why or an unschooling <br/>
mom would see those heads snap back and realize there is an <br/>
opportunity to wonder.  I&#39;m not there yet.<br/>

planned it for &quot;school&quot;.  To me it is like learning a foreign <br/>
language.  First you hear the word and translate it to English then <br/>
eventually you hear the word and just know what it means.<br/>
<br/>
At this point in my learning process I am translating learning <br/>
opportunities into &quot;school&quot; because that is all I know, eventually, I <br/>
hope to drop the &quot;school&quot; and let life takes over.<br/>

Your answer is above Pat. Just change the negatives to positives. IMHO, This<br/>
is all you need to do to start unschooling:<br/>
&quot;I will question why things happen the way they do.  I can learn<br/>
about them along with my children and I can begin to ask questions.<br/>
*I* can show them the<br/>

Just keep asking why? It sounds like you are doing great now, you just need<br/>
to keep telling yourself that things are going well, the kids are learning<br/>
(which they will do anyway as long as you are not hindering them (by<br/>
teaching)) Put your revised statement on your mirror where you&#39;ll see it<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not a bad thing.  I&#39;ve been involved in music my whole life, and I <br/>
knew what sousaphone was, and knew we would have color photos.   We have <br/>
recordings of John Phillips Sousa marches too, but I refrained from throwing <br/>
ALL my resources at a simple question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Because until we did a science experiment on inertia, I did not know <br/>
what it was.  I would never have pointed it out in day to day <br/>
living.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s vocabulary.  You know the realities of inertia, you just didn&#39;t have <br/>
the lingo.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Because when my daughter put one hole in a large can of ketchup I <br/>
told her she needed to put a second hole in the can to let some air <br/>

<br/>
I knew that when I was a kid from canned milk and from chocolate syrup in a <br/>
can.  My kids now learn it from plastic two-gallon water dispensers that need <br/>
to be stabbed to flow.  People learn it when they need it!  Neither formal <br/>
school nor unschooling has a moment to create an artificial situation in <br/>
which that is presented in the absence of something in a can or bottle or <br/>
whatever when it matters.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t question why things happen the way they do.  I can learn <br/>
about them along with my children and I can begin to ask questions, <br/>
but what happens to them in the mean time?  Who can show them the <br/>
world?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let them see it themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
My question to you is why there should be a &quot;meantime&quot; between now and that <br/>
time when you begin to learn along with your children and you begin to ask <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Because I&#39;m &quot;dull&quot; in the unschooling sense.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rent some movies, make some popcorn, and relax with your kids.  When <br/>
discussions arise, go with them.  If you can&#39;t do it today, do it tomorrow.  <br/>
Or something as good or better.  That&#39;s how you start.   <br/>
<br/>
Defining yourself or your children in negative ways is a step back each time. <br/>
  Look at the sweet, right, good moments, and step away from the scarier, <br/>
darker, duller moments.  Half an inch toward the light is toward the light.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s like priming a hand-pump (another air pressure/water <br/>
situation)--the first pump gets nothing.  The second usually gets nothing.  <br/>
Once the water&#39;s in the pipe, though, every touch on the pump handle brings <br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
Or like sourdough bread.  Once you have the starter and you keep paying <br/>
attention enough to make more bread every once in a while, &quot;It&#39;s easy.&quot;  But <br/>
for those with no starter, it&#39;s not just not easy, it&#39;s not possible.  <br/>
(That&#39;s theory.  There&#39;s sourdough breadmix now that has the sourdough in <br/>
some kind of powdered and encapsulated form.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story of scheduling:<br/>
<br/>
Monday night, here, May 6, some people were asleep, the house was quiet, <br/>
Marty was on crutches for the second day from a play-wrestling injury on <br/>
Saturday.  10:35, Holly had watched the Simpsons and came and said &quot;I want to <br/>
go to bed.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
She often stays up later. Sometimes I do too, but I said, &quot;Me too, I&#39;m tired.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We went out front to put a rented DVD in the mailbox, so we can get a <br/>
Twilight Zone episode we have in the Netflix cue that we&#39;re wanting to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty boring so far, and very routine, and moments from me reading her to <br/>
sleep.<br/>
I&#39;m at the mailbox, she&#39;s swinging from a rope in the tree, and we hear huge <br/>
screech of tires, and look over toward the main road.  We have only about a <br/>
10 degree view of Juan Tabo from our front yard (through our sideyard and <br/>
over the back wall--we were at the top of the highest point of our property), <br/>
but right there was the wreck, and we saw it.   Holly wanted to go closer, so <br/>
we passed through the house, I dialed 911 and handed the phone to Marty and <br/>
said to tell them there was just a wreck at Juan Tabo and Lexington, and <br/>
Holly and I walked through the house, out the backgate, across a field and <br/>
sat on the bus bench by Hollywood Video, while the drivers exchanged <br/>
information and the passengers in the cars negotiated who was how, who should <br/>
sit and be where, and, in one case, what they were going to tell the police.  <br/>
(We didn&#39;t hear details, just heard &quot;Just don&#39;t mention that.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
There were three cars, all driven by males in at least their 20&#39;s, all with <br/>
passengers, one with several passengers, and one from just a couple of blocks <br/>
away, because people were walking back and forth from the house, and others <br/>
from their house came out.  There were no injuries involving blood or breaks, <br/>
just fright and getting jerked around.<br/>
<br/>
We finally heard sirens from both directions, but the four police cars which <br/>
arrived all came from the south.  And they pulled up strategically, and then <br/>
three left.<br/>
<br/>
There was another wreck at Comanche and Juan Tabo, barely over half a mile <br/>
away.  We could see the lights there.<br/>
<br/>
Our conversation involved what the people needed to have and know who were in <br/>
the accident (licenses, insurance cards), and what the police are looking for <br/>
and at when they first arrive, and what the duty of the police officers is <br/>
regarding other traffic, safety of those involved, and other non-obvious <br/>
matters.  We discussed the paramedics--same deal.  What is their duty?  Just <br/>
because someone says &quot;I&#39;m fine&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they can say &quot;Okay&quot; and leave <br/>
without at least getting names and vital signs and a little feedback.  Are <br/>
the people disoriented?  How are their eyes?  Possible concussion?<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted to go and see the other accident, so we went home for the van.  <br/>
Marty said the 911 dispatcher had been tacky with him and said he had to tell <br/>
her whether there were injuries and he said he did not know, that he wasn&#39;t <br/>
at the scene and his mom had told him to call.  She insisted he had to find <br/>
out.  He didn&#39;t tell her &quot;I&#39;m a kid on crutches and I don&#39;t either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So we drove by the other accident.  Two cars, a harder hit, but no blood (for <br/>
which I was relieved).  They had just gotten someone into an ambulance and <br/>
were taking them away when we passed by.  <br/>
<br/>
We drove back to the other one and parked in the Hollywood video parking lot. <br/>
 No news, no change.  We cruised the other to see if the tow trucks were <br/>
coming.  Not yet.  The road, although a main 4 and 6-lane (variously) <br/>
thoroughfare, was not at all busy at that time of a Monday night.   We were <br/>
careful not to be in anyone&#39;s way.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to go and watch tow trucks at the site nearest our house and then <br/>
go home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was an unscheduled hour.  I could have said, &quot;No, Holly, you don&#39;t need to <br/>
see that.  I thought you wanted to go to sleep.&quot;   But I took advantage of <br/>
her interest and an unusual situation to have a long discussion on how <br/>
liability insurance works, how police gauge by the tire marks and the glass <br/>
on the road how fast cars were probably going, and whose fault it might have <br/>
been.  If the drivers&#39; accounts don&#39;t match they have to go to secondary <br/>
evidence for sure.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no sense going looking for a wreck, but I saw no sense in letting an <br/>
opportunity pass by.  I wouldn&#39;t have tried to take a child against his or <br/>
her will to see something like that.  So it wasn&#39;t my decision, or hers, it <br/>
was mutually agreed upon, but I stayed with it as long as there was something <br/>
new for her to see and discuss, and as long as she was fascinated.<br/>

<br/>
I never really got on board with the idea that some people &quot;can&#39;t&quot; unschool. <br/>
I like to believe that if someone cares enough to ask about unschooling, <br/>
they have the ability to learn and grow and develop the awareness to do it. <br/>
The idea of judging someone else as &quot;dull&#39; because they don&#39;t have the same <br/>
interests or passions as I do, doesn&#39;t sit well with me. I probably would <br/>
have been judged as breathtakingly dull a few years back. Maybe even now. <br/>

you give yourself credit for. And you are willing to look things up, ask <br/>
some questions and say &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s find out&quot;. It&#39;s all good.<br/>

Good! Nothing wrong with that. And the next time one of you sees a <br/>
sousaphone, you might mention it. Or point out a similar instrument. Or go <br/>
out of your way to find some music with a sousaphone in it. It&#39;s all about <br/>

&gt; hope to drop the &quot;school&quot; and let life takes over.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honey, I started out using Calvert School -- the full first grade<br/>
curriculum, complete with day-by-day teacher&#39;s instructions and a<br/>
correspondence program so an *expert* could grade my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned a lot :-)  I learned it from Sandra and Joyce and PamS and PamH<br/>
and Carol and a host of others.  I learned it from -- books!  What motivated<br/>
me to change was seeing the light of learning go out in my daughter&#39;s eyes<br/>
when I&#39;d say &quot;time for school!&quot;  When my son, 3 years younger, would sigh<br/>
and ask &quot;Aren&#39;t you done with school YET? Can&#39;t we play?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was a homeschool tyrant.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not as bad as I was.  I was so<br/>
unsure of myself, so thoroughly &quot;schooled,&quot; I couldn&#39;t function in response<br/>
to my children.  I had Calvert&#39;s Teacher Guide to tell me what to do.  I<br/>
thought if I did everything on each page, just as I was told, my children<br/>
would be educated.  I would be GOOD; I would do what I was told.  What my<br/>
daughter experienced was unimportant; she had to do her work.  I actually<br/>
locked her in the schoolroom for 2 hours until she finished a worksheet.<br/>
She still hates Calvert school based on that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been DEschooling myself for 8 years.<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem with my totally unschooled son now.  He wants me to teach<br/>
him.  I don&#39;t know how.  I don&#39;t have a teacher&#39;s manual, and I don&#39;t know<br/>
how to teach him -- when he was 5, and I tried to explain subtraction, he<br/>
screwed up his little face and said &quot;Don&#39;t ever teach me anything again,<br/>
Mommy!  You make it too confusing!&quot;  That was the day I became an unschooler<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  (He&#39;d already taught himself to read.)  He has a schooled friend who<br/>
criticizes him for not doing anything all day long, so I think ds wants a<br/>
more normal life; he seems to be jealous of the park day kids who &quot;do<br/>
school&quot; at home (they&#39;re all in charters, though, and I get to hear their<br/>
moms bitch about getting them to do their work!).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s OK to structure your day; I wish I had better control of MY time.  I<br/>
tend to hit the computer as soon as the coffee is made, while my kids play<br/>
Game Cube or watch e.r. reruns.  I tell myself we&#39;re not morning people ;-)<br/>
The problem, though, is I work two afternoons a week and we have park day on<br/>
one of the other days; the two remaining days I spend doing housework and<br/>
laundry, then I work Saturdays as well.  I realize, though, that I could<br/>
squeeze all the sit-down schooltime with my son into each morning, and he&#39;d<br/>
be happy.  Even when I did Calvert, it only took 2 hours.  (I have to resist<br/>
the temptation to make it so awful, he&#39;ll ask me to stop, and I can go back<br/>
to the email! &lt;g&gt; )<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because if my daughter came to me and asked me what a sousaphone was<br/>
&gt; I would look it up in the dictionary and read the definition.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In addition to what a sousaphone is she&#39;s learning how to find out answers<br/>
to questions. That&#39;s way more important than the answers. And even more<br/>
important than that is being aware and pondering enough to ask the questions<br/>
in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because until we did a science experiment on inertia, I did not know<br/>
&gt; what it was.  I would never have pointed it out in day to day<br/>
&gt; living.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s okay. There are undoubtedly oodles of things that pass us by that<br/>
someone else would have pointed out to their child.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the answers that are important. It&#39;s the questions.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said that the reason boys have a big advantage in physics<br/>
(mechanics) in college is that they&#39;ve had experience with this stuff all<br/>
their lives. *Not* because some has pointed inertia out to them. But just<br/>
from experiencing it. They&#39;ve bounced, hit and kicked balls, rammed toy cars<br/>
into each other, jumped off spinning merry go rounds. They&#39;ve *been* the<br/>
ball in the physics book ;-) So when they see the formal explanations they<br/>
say &quot;Oh, I know that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had a tricky time in physics initially because I had no real images to<br/>
build from, just my false theoretical ideas of how things probably worked.<br/>
<br/>
What the kids need are experiences and awareness to ask questions. And<br/>
someone to help them learn how to find the answers and encourage their<br/>
questioning and exploring.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because when my daughter put one hole in a large can of ketchup I<br/>
&gt; told her she needed to put a second hole in the can to let some air<br/>
&gt; in.  I did not know what air pressure had to do with any of that<br/>
&gt; until we poked holes in a 2 liter bottle filled with water and<br/>
&gt; followed the directions for a science experiment (and the book<br/>
&gt; explained it).  We both looked at each other and said &quot;the ketchup<br/>
&gt; can&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s the noticing that&#39;s important. If she hadn&#39;t had a need to put the<br/>
hole in the ketchup can in a real life situation, then doing the experiment<br/>
would have meant very little to her. She wouldn&#39;t have seen how air pressure<br/>
relates to real life. It&#39;s likely it would have just been &quot;Oh&quot; and filed<br/>
away and perhaps forgotten. Were there other experiments you did? Did she<br/>
have the same &quot;aha&quot; moments with all of them? Or were they treated like,<br/>
okay that&#39;s cool, what&#39;s the next one?<br/>
<br/>
And as someone said, if your family enjoys experiments, it&#39;s okay to *mess<br/>
around* with them. Just don&#39;t think of the experiments as the learning and<br/>
everything else as just living. It&#39;s the experiences that they can then<br/>
relate something more formal to (now or in the distant future) that are<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t question why things happen the way they do.  I can learn<br/>
&gt; about them along with my children and I can begin to ask questions,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe make it your goal to everyday look at something you&#39;ve seen so often<br/>
you don&#39;t see it any more and wonder about it. Where did the materials come<br/>
from? How did they get from where they were to where it was made? Why was it<br/>
made this way and not some other way? How did people do what the object is<br/>
for before this object was invented? What skills used to be involved? What<br/>
skills are involved in the new one?<br/>
<br/>
What advantage is it for some trees to develop leaves early in the spring?<br/>
And why do some wait until later in the spring? Who used to live on the land<br/>
before you did? (You could go *way* back to Native Americans and prehistoric<br/>
creatures or a little back by going to the court house to search through the<br/>
records of who has bought and sold the house over the years.)<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t even worry about the answers at first. Just get in the habit of<br/>
asking the questions, pondering *possible* answers and developing a sense of<br/>
wonder.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but what happens to them in the mean time?  Who can show them the<br/>
&gt; world?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what you&#39;re really worried about isn&#39;t showing them, it&#39;s explaining<br/>
the world to them. Don&#39;t worry about the explanations. Encourage the<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
I think Richard Feynman said that his grandfather told him something to the<br/>
effect that you could learn all the names of all the birds and still know<br/>
nothing about the birds. The real learning is in watching one bird, even if<br/>
you don&#39;t know it&#39;s name, and *seeing* what it does. How it behaves, how it<br/>
interacts with birds and other creatures, how it feeds itself. Someone could<br/>
decide to rename all the birds and the name memorizer who had looked so<br/>
smart before would know nothing. But the one who had studied the behavior is<br/>
the one with the true knowledge of the birds.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make a difference if your daughter knows inertia. It&#39;s important<br/>
that she experience it. The beauty is you don&#39;t even need to know it exists.<br/>
You just need to slow down and experience and say hey, that&#39;s really neat.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my daughter was blowing dandelions and, though, of course, jaded<br/>
as I am I was certain there was nothing for me to learn from something so<br/>
common, she encouraged me to blow and I actually *saw* them for the first<br/>
time. How the feathery tufts form a nearly perfect transluscent globe, how<br/>
the seeds attach to the middle, how they look like little tiny parachutes.<br/>
Someone could probably name all the parts or the physics involved, but that<br/>
wasn&#39;t important. It was *observing*, actually *seeing* what was going on<br/>
and both of us sharing it that was important.<br/>
<br/>
(And *don&#39;t* think this is all obvious and easy! I explain things to others<br/>
so *I* can understand them. ;-) I&#39;m the one who values memorizing bird<br/>
names. It&#39;s a tough mode of thinking to break out of.)<br/>

What we found out is that it was originally the former name of<br/>
Tombouctou, which is in central Mali, although it&#39;s now used to describe<br/>
any farway place.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any insights on goose-stepping now? It is &quot;the marching step<br/>
on some infantries in which the legs are swung high and kept straight and<br/>
stiff&quot;, which does not sound to me like the way a goose steps, and it&#39;s<br/>
about 200 years old. It was also a Nazi thing, and &quot;After WWII, the<br/>
goose-step was outlawed in West Germany, making it the only human gesture<br/>
to be officially banned by a state.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reminds me.  Once dh, kids and I were in Gatlinburg, doing the tourist <br/>
stuff, strolling down the quaint streets.  Will was about 3, I guess, <br/>
making Jake and Jon about 14 and 12.  We happened upon a front-end <br/>
loader and a bulldozer doing some dirt work in an empty lot, which was <br/>
right next to a taffy shop.  There were little ice cream tables out <br/>
front and the boys were all struck silent as they admired the powerful <br/>
machines.  They were all happy to sit there and watch for a long time, <br/>
and they needed a rest, so they did.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t let that opportunity pass me by!  I went into the taffy-making <br/>
shop and spent a whole thirty minutes learning about all the different <br/>
kinds of candy they made right before my eyes....and none of the kids <br/>
even asked me to buy any candy because they weren&#39;t there!<br/>
<br/>
The other day Will and I parked for an hour and watched a crane lift a <br/>
steeple up to the top of Ellendale Baptist Church&#39;s new sanctuary.  Lots <br/>
of people watched, but we stopped first and attracted the non-workmen crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Not letting those opportunities pass by.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any reason why you wouldn&#39;t want to learn alongside your<br/>
children.  Not asking why things happen the way they do just seems foreign<br/>
to me.  <br/>
<br/>
So Pat, if it makes it easier to have one, here&#39;s your ASSIGNMENT.  Start<br/>
learning for yourself! Every time you feel dull in the &quot;unschooling&quot; way,<br/>
ask yourself why things happen the way they do.  Find out about it for<br/>
yourself.  Make sure your kids see you doing this for yourself.  And I&#39;ll<br/>
bet you&#39;ll have the children along side you in no time.  Pretty soon all of<br/>
you will be seeing the world together.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with all the talk about not having a scheduled pre-decided course<br/>
outline for Science or anything else.  Have a good time just living and<br/>
discovering. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to share any advanced knowledge you have<br/>
about a subject though.  I love sharing in-depth knowledge *if* there is an<br/>
interest shown.  I try never to set it up in a curricular sort of way. I<br/>
make it clear that *I* find the particular subject interesting or<br/>
fascinating or in some way worth knowing about because... and I share those<br/>
interesting tidbits or in-depth knowledge.  It might be in words or<br/>
illustrations or with physical things that illustrates my fascination with<br/>
it.  If that sparks an interest in them, we run with it.  If not, then at<br/>
least they know something more about *my* interests.  For me, it is never<br/>
something I think or present that they &quot;should&quot; know about.<br/>
