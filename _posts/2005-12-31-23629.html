<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335460929">Well, we sat down and had a long talk with Nicole on<br/>
the same night when I first posted here about the<br/>
problems we were having with her.  It was a very<br/>
emotional but overall productive discussion, which<br/>
went on long into the night.<br/>
<br/>
I do think depression played a part, and I also think<br/>
some inability on her part to see how she was<br/>
affecting those around her played a part.  There were<br/>
also some misinterpretations on our part of her<br/>
behaviors, where her motivations and thoughts/feelings<br/>
were not as selfish or negative as her actions<br/>
appeared in some things, but her total lack of<br/>
communication left us in the dark about what was<br/>
really going on with her. <br/>
<br/>
Throughout the discussion there were many tears from<br/>
her and she expressed a great deal of remorse and<br/>
anger with herself for having caused us pain, stress,<br/>
and unhappiness.  During different points where we<br/>
asked her to visualize/role play herself in our<br/>
position, with a friend, relative, roomate or<br/>
whatever, and how she would handle things, as well as<br/>
asking what she needed herself, she repeatedly<br/>
expressed a desire to be pushed, encouraged, prodded,<br/>
directed or how she would do the same in our position.<br/>
 She asked for more specific instructions and requests<br/>
on how/when/what to do to help out, more prodding and<br/>
pushing to get her driving and working, more help and<br/>
encouragement to get more independent.  She needs more<br/>
structure.  So we&#39;re working with her to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
We asked her also to work on being more communicative<br/>
and forthcoming, sharing her thoughts, spending more<br/>
family time with us and volunteer information without<br/>
needing to be quizzed and have things pried out of<br/>
her.  We pointed out that, as she&#39;s well aware and<br/>
we&#39;ve heard her say, relationships take work, and<br/>
family relationships are no different, particularly<br/>
family that you live with.  We talked about ways to<br/>
help her have quiet time to herself when she needed<br/>
it, as she gets overstimulated easily.<br/>
<br/>
She also shared with us some of the difficulties she&#39;s<br/>
having with learning to live with our special needs<br/>
kids.  One thing she said was &quot;I don&#39;t think most<br/>
people have any idea how hard this is, just to live in<br/>
the same house with them, let alone be their parents. <br/>
I&#39;m learning how, and I love to be with them, but it&#39;s<br/>
hard.&quot;  As she has many of the same difficulties that<br/>
the boys have, she&#39;s also learning a lot about herself<br/>
and her own needs by living with them.<br/>
<br/>
She expressed an overall lethargy and trouble sleeping<br/>
and we pointed out how these and other things she was<br/>
doing are symptoms of depression.  We also suggested<br/>
she get more physical excercise during the day as a<br/>
possible mental/physical/chemical lift and to help her<br/>
sleep better.  Living far North, we also pointed out<br/>
that lack of daylight exposure is bad for the body and<br/>
can lead to depression (Seasonal Affected Disorder is<br/>
common here) and that staying locked a lightless room<br/>
until 2PM when it get&#39;s dark at 4pm was not good for<br/>
her in that area either.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about how we thought it was unfair that so<br/>
much of her energy was going into online and long<br/>
distance relationships and almost none was going to<br/>
her family here that she lived with.  She thought that<br/>
was a fair point and has made a so far total reversal<br/>
of that dynamic!  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra: in answer to your question, when I mentioned<br/>
that she was making long distance calls it didn&#39;t have<br/>
anything to do with expense or being irritated about<br/>
it, I was just pointing out that she had no local<br/>
friends or social exchanges at all, they were all far<br/>
away.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
Since we talked the other day she&#39;s asked for and been<br/>
taken out job hunting, made a resume, asked for and<br/>
recieved help filling out applications, made plans<br/>
with us for further job hunting forays, studied her<br/>
driver&#39;s test booklet and made plans to go out for<br/>
driving practice with us.  She&#39;s talked with us a lot<br/>
about good places to apply for work and has visited a<br/>
local state work assistance office to get help with<br/>
her resume, tips on interviews and job leads.  <br/>
<br/>
The difference in her participation in family<br/>
activites and chores has also been dramatic.  She not<br/>
only attended Thomas&#39; birthday party, but was present<br/>
the entire time, conversed and socialized with the<br/>
adults present, helped cook and clean up cheerfully. <br/>
We thanked her for being there and for helping out so<br/>
much.  We have always thanked her for helping out but<br/>
now there&#39;s more to thank her for, more often.  We<br/>
were always open about telling her we loved her and<br/>
being physically affectionate but now she&#39;s openly<br/>
reciprocating and initiating those exchanges too!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re planning at least a couple nights a week to play<br/>
games or do other social things together as a family<br/>
with her.  She&#39;s spending more time chatting with us. <br/>
She leaves the door open more at night after 8pm into<br/>
the study as an unspoken invitation to be more social<br/>
with her when she&#39;s in there.  She&#39;s getting up<br/>
dramatically earlier too (by 9-10 AM so far) and<br/>
taking care of daily chores like dishes and the<br/>
litterbox right away in the morning.  She&#39;s smiling<br/>
and laughing more now and we&#39;re all noticing how much<br/>
that was absent.  Last night she comfortably joined us<br/>
as we all piled onto the loft to watch the movie<br/>
Thomas got from us for his birthday (Fantastic 4 =<br/>
fun/funny confection of a superhero action movie.)<br/>
<br/>
Now I have felt the need to mention to her not to burn<br/>
herself out by overdoing it, which is an ironic and<br/>
dramatic change!  I don&#39;t want her to start feeling<br/>
like the cinderella of the house, but to find a happy<br/>
medium where everyone is feeling their needs are met. <br/>
Things proceed well as she works to discover her place<br/>
in the home and family and world.  Thank you to<br/>
everyone for your thoughts and advice!<br/>
<br/>
