&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;And the tall grass prairie... &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s some in Kansas, because my friend Ted, who&#39;s an artist and <br/>
&gt;archeologist (way into pottery new and old), was involved in prairie <br/>
&gt;preservation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A long and somewhat tedious yet interesting book about the tall grass <br/>
prairie is _PrairyErth_ by William Least Heat Moon.  All about Chase <br/>
County, Kansas.  It amazed me that one person could say so much about <br/>
one county, but that was exactly his point I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
I really liked his book _River-Horse_ in which he took a boat from the <br/>
Atlantic to the Pacific, all via river.<br/>
