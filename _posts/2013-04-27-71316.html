<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619882853">This is from an article in the New Yorker about deciding whether or not to<br/>
go to graduate school. But this part reminds me a lot of deciding to<br/>
unschool. I especially love the part about you being changed, too.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Sometimes, you can�t know what something is like until you try it. You<br/>
can�t know what Vegemite tastes like, for example, until you try Vegemite;<br/>
you can�t know what having children will be like until you have children.<br/>
You can guess what these things will be like; you can ask people; you can<br/>
draw up lists of pros and cons; but, at the end of the day, �without having<br/>
the experience itself� you �cannot even have an approximate idea as to what<br/>
it is like to have that experience.� That�s because you won�t just be<br/>
having the experience; the experience will be changing you. On the other<br/>
side, you will be a different kind of person. Making such a decision, you<br/>
will always be uninformed.&quot;<br/>
