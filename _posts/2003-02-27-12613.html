<h4>Penny Holder at 2003-02-27 18:50:51 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179008136">Hello!  My name is Penny Holder.  I have been married to my wonderful husband Phillip for almost 15 years.  We have 3 children(Nick 12, Emilee 9, Ashley 6).  We live in MS.  I am also a wahm.  I am a Tupperware Sr. Exec Mgr. and an Usborne Educational Consultant.<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling them for 2 years.  Nick is gifted with LD in reading and ADHD and  Emilee is dyslexic, dysgraphic, dyspraxic, add, and has auditory processing problems.  Emilee gets OT and ST at our local rehab center.  Both Emilee & Nick have a tutor for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Since we have so many appointments for this, that, and the other it is very hard to stick to a schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
I would love to know more about how everyone does unschooling and what a typical day is like at your home?<br/>
<br/>
Also, do you add in curriculum for some subjects such as Math and Spelling??<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your input!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728834547">Hi Penny,<br/>
<br/>
I saw your intro on the unschooling.com email list as well. You&#39;re welcome<br/>
to this list, please just be aware that it&#39;s primarily set up for those who<br/>
are unschooling already and have been for some time, so if you have a lot of<br/>
beginning-unschooling (or interested-in-unschooling) questions as below you<br/>
might find the unschooling.com email list (as well as the message boards at<br/>
www.unschooling.com, where you can read many archived messages laid out in<br/>
sensible order on what unschooling is, etc.) a more useful resource for you<br/>
for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would love to know more about how everyone does unschooling and what a<br/>
&gt; typical day is like at your home?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Typical days don&#39;t occur much here. &lt;g&gt; At some point in the morning to<br/>
early afternoon all four of us will be found out of bed (or off the floor,<br/>
as my daughters sometimes prefer to &quot;go camping&quot; in their rooms). We might<br/>
go somewhere that one or all of us wants to, more likely we&#39;ll be home<br/>
pursuing our interests together or separately. My husband and I own a home<br/>
business so each spend some time every day on that; my daughters interests<br/>
at the moment include bike riding, drawing and many other forms of arts and<br/>
crafts, dancing (at home, they&#39;re not currently in a formal class), video<br/>
games, working with their rabbit and cavy (guinea pig) breeding and show<br/>
stock, and generally playing. They&#39;re 8 and 5.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, do you add in curriculum for some subjects such as Math and Spelling??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is Un Schooling, so not only do we not add in curriculum for<br/>
some subjects such as Math and Spelling, we don&#39;t generally label things as<br/>
&quot;Math&quot; or &quot;Spelling&quot; or &quot;subjects&quot;. :) Many activities that could be labeled<br/>
&quot;math&quot; or &quot;spelling&quot; do occur in our daily lives, but they are considered no<br/>
more or less important than any other interest or pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>
Pam, a moderator here</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Penny! Sounds like you&#39;re really busy! That&#39;s quite a load you&#39;re <br/>
carrying with two businesses and finding time to carve out for your <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You may find that unschoolers find very little value in labels for <br/>
people. Sure, the label expresses that a person learns differently from <br/>
&quot;most,&quot; but in truth everyone learns differently and sometimes the label <br/>
overemphasizes the differences in such a way as to make the child hard <br/>
to see.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds very scheduled to me! How do you find to fit in a life? With all <br/>
that and two businesses, how do you find time to fit in real experiences <br/>
that your kids may be interested in, things that *they* choose?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, do you add in curriculum for some subjects such as Math and Spelling??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our spelling curriculum consists of the kids writing notes and captions. <br/>
Our math curriculum embraces numbers, amounts, and parts of everything <br/>
we encounter, especially trains.  ;-)<br/>
