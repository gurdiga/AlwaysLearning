<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977952941">My dogs will eventually chew up plastic stuff.  The tupperware thing looks<br/>
great, if the lid is easy enough to get off without spilling stuff inside<br/>
(for young kids).  But one day we&#39;ll leave it out and leave the house, or<br/>
just go in the basement and my dogs will chew it up to get at whatever&#39;s<br/>
inside -- including celery and stupid not yummy for dogs food like that.  :)<br/>
<br/>
A glass cake stand would be good, except the dome would be too heavy and<br/>
unwieldy for a young kid.  And I have really stupid ceramic tile floors that<br/>
are death to lots of glass stuff too.  We moved in about 1.5 years ago and<br/>
have broken SO many dishes it&#39;s not even funny.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve figured out to get the glass Pyrex dishes with plastic lids because I<br/>
can order them separately, so when we break a dish or the dogs get the lids,<br/>
I can order them individually -- annoying, but better than having lots of<br/>
mismatched food storage stuff.  Been there, done that.  :)  Plus I like the<br/>
glass in that situation because I often microwave them and prefer to<br/>
microwave in glass rather than plastic.  My kids can NOT easily get the lids<br/>
off these containers though, so they don&#39;t work either.<br/>
<br/>
We are fine -- we have found workarounds that involves the kids eating in<br/>
the kitchen more often than not.  They can get water for themselves, and can<br/>
open the fridge/freezer too.  At least that limits what the dogs get to what<br/>
the kids leave after eating and I don&#39;t see quickly enough to put away.  If<br/>
my kids want to take food elsewhere, I try to close them in a room or close<br/>
the dogs in another room.<br/>
<br/>
We have really nice, friendly, sometimes rambunctious dogs that we clicker<br/>
trained (sort of...)  and were a HUGE part of what brought me towards AP and<br/>
unschooling!  I owe those dogs a lot, and my kids owe them even more because<br/>
my husband and I practiced on them before we ever had kids!  :)  What I&#39;d<br/>
REALLY like is a less open house with a kitchen I could close off completely<br/>
so our pets could be kept out of there altogether.  And a different floor...<br/>
Maybe someday!  At least the way it is now we can sit at a counter in the<br/>
kitchen and look straight at our big TV.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323690775">At first I was thinking, well, we don&#39;t leave food out either (we<br/>
don&#39;t have dogs) but in reality we do, it just doesn&#39;t look like an<br/>
intentional &quot;put out a platter-full of choices to work from all day&quot;.<br/>
For instance, I&#39;ll cut up an apple and the kids don&#39;t have to sit<br/>
there to specifically to eat the apple and then decide when they are<br/>
done and put it away. It&#39;s occurred to me after reading this thread<br/>
that because they can take it over a period of time based on their<br/>
appetite -- graze -- it&#39;s supporting their sense of appetite and what<br/>
they really need. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if these ideas have been mentioned yet: first, you said<br/>
something about your dogs eating plastic. There are all-glass storage<br/>
containers you can buy, made by anchor hocking. I&#39;m thinking the<br/>
little ones (which are about 4 1/2 inches square) would be easy enough<br/>
for little hands to handle the lids.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kaboodle.com/reviews/glass-storage-dishes-small">http://www.kaboodle.com/reviews/glass-storage-dishes-small</a> They&#39;re<br/>
expensive but well made (so they last,) I&#39;ve broken glassware of all<br/>
kinds (I wash dishes by hand, so they tend to clank around against<br/>
each other and the porcelain sink while soaking, slip out of my hands<br/>
when soaped up, etc.) but not these. (Sorry about those tile floors --<br/>
we used to have them, what a pain. What about putting a washable rug<br/>
in the eating area?)<br/>
<br/>
Second, what about just leaving food in a cupboard? Unless you<br/>
refrigerate everything, it wouldn&#39;t be any different than, say, buying<br/>
a package of cookies and putting them in the cabinet. I suppose a<br/>
clever dog could figure out how to open the door of certain types of<br/>
cabinets... But if you put magnetic closures on maybe the resistance<br/>
would be enough to prevent that.  <br/>

Is this a quote from someone?  I&#39;ve had so much e-mail lately I  <br/>
haven&#39;t been reading it all in order.<br/>
If someone wrote that, I missed it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All day&quot; is a long time to leave some kinds of foods out, in some  <br/>
kinds of climates.  In New Mexico, bread can&#39;t be left out or it dries  <br/>
up.  In very humid places, crackers or chips can&#39;t be left out because  <br/>
they&#39;ll get stale.  (And in England crackers and chips are whole  <br/>
different things, so I&#39;ve failed to make an international statement.  <br/>
And I don&#39;t know what might be left out in Australia.  Vegemite on a  <br/>
saltine?  I guess it depends what part of Australia, how long that can  <br/>
sit. &lt;g&gt;)  I usually have a bowl of nuts out and refill it, but a  <br/>
monkey platter is not going to be out for over an hour or so.  If  <br/>
they&#39;re through eating from it, I&#39;ll put the leftovers in a plastic  <br/>
container in the fridge, or give it to the dog, if it&#39;s something  <br/>
she&#39;d want.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I suppose a<br/>

<br/>
If dogs are not only getting food off tables and counters, and out of  <br/>
the hands of young children, but they&#39;re going to go into the cabinets  <br/>
too, those dogs are not being communicated with sufficiently and the  <br/>
children aren&#39;t being protected very well, in my opinion.<br/>

We live in the pacific northwest. Some things that could work here:<br/>
blueberries, strawberries, peach slices, broccoli florets, carrots,<br/>
peas, corn, cookies, sweet breads, pasta with ghee and salt and<br/>
pepper, nuts, chocolate chips... <br/>
<br/>
I have safety issues with leaving food out, which I think are not<br/>
always entirely rational. One day my father-in-law came over and<br/>
picked a fried egg out of a frying pan that had been sitting in my<br/>
kitchen for probably several hours, I just hadn&#39;t gotten around to<br/>
cleaning up, and popped it right in his mouth. I was horrified. On the<br/>
other hand I regularly will make a batch of cookies and leave them in<br/>
the cupboard overnight and think nothing of it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745191289">A kind of variation on the monkey platter theme is something we do in <br/>
the summer at the park or pool.  I throw a bag of frozen fruit in our <br/>
cooler to help keep thing cold and bring it out when it seems like a <br/>
good time.  It can be kind of messy but the kids love eating the cold, <br/>
slighty thawed fruit.  I have brought cups before to put it in or we <br/>
just all reach over and grab from the opened, layed out bag.</div>
