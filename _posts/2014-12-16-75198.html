<div id="ygrps-yiv-217152572"><div id="ygrps-yiv-217152572ygrps-yiv-1729408854"><p><span>I don&#39;t even know where to start. My 12 year old daughter, McKenzie, and I had a disagreement tonight. It ended with me saying that I just wanted her to be happy to which she replied &quot;what if I don&#39;t want to be happy?&quot;. I said &quot;fine, I&#39;m done trying to figure out how to make you happy&quot;. This is very unlike me to say something like this but I&#39;m so frustrated. I walked into the living room leaving her in the kitchen. I was in the living room for about half an hour wrapping Christmas presents. I walked back into the kitchen expecting my daughter to be at her computer at the kitchen table where I left her. She was not. I noticed that the door to the garage was unlocked when I had remembered locking it. I went into the garage and noticed that the main door was unlocked as well. I ran around the house searching for her but couldn&#39;t find her. I left in my car to look for her. She has done this two other times...just left when she&#39;s upset but it&#39;s always been earlier in the day and I&#39;ve found her both times. This time, it was after 11pm. After driving around looking for her for a few minutes, I came back home and did one more look around the house before I was going to call the police. I didn&#39;t want to get the police involved but I didn&#39;t know what else to do. I was worried sick about her. Right as I was walking back upstairs from the basement, she came walking in the door. I don&#39;t have many, if any, rules that I ask her to follow but I told her tonight that I have to make one rule that she can not just leave when she&#39;s upset. She can go on the porch or the patio or in her room or the basement but she can&#39;t just leave our yard without telling me, especially at almost midnight at night. I don&#39;t know if she will listen to that rule but she needs to know that she just can&#39;t go walking around town at midnight.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>I&#39;ve wanted to write to this group for a long time but I keep putting it off because I&#39;m worried about being judged. But after tonight, I just need to hear some advice from people who unschool also because I just want my daughter to be happy and I don&#39;t know what to do to help her be happy. Some back information, we started unschooling 6 years ago. My daughter went to kindergarten, first grade, and the first day of second grade at a public school. My son was already homeschooling. My oldest daughter wanted to continue going to public school. I read a lot about unschooling before my son and youngest daughter started. The first couple of years were rough because we had a lot of deschooling to do. But the next couple of years were wonderful, everything fell into place and it was amazing how much unschooling changed our lives. However, the past couple of years, my youngest daughter, who has always been very shy, just seems to be withdrawing more and more. It&#39;s been harder and harder to find things that she likes doing as she gets older. She&#39;s not as interested in much, other than drawing. She only has two friends. They are both boys and they both go to public school so she only gets to see them once in a while. She is with me or alone almost every day. I work 3 days per week. She is able to come to work with me 2 of the 3 days if she wants to. </p><p><br></p><p>Even though I am constantly telling her how proud I am of her, she has such low self-esteem. She is very critical of herself. I don&#39;t understand why because she is very talented and I tell her that all the time. I&#39;ve never belittled her or mistreated her so I have a hard time understanding why she thinks so little of herself. She also can never make a decision even though I never force her to do something that she doesn&#39;t want to do. Her favorite responses to anything that I may ask her is &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;, or &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter&quot;. She just seems sad and upset 90% of the time. The other 10%, she is talkative and silly and funny, but then just like that, she&#39;s sad and depressed again. I know that this group doesn&#39;t like labels and neither do I but I am just so worried about her. I&#39;m concerned that something more serious is going on, like depression, or bipolar disorder. I&#39;ve told her that I will do anything for her. If she wants to go back to public school, I will enroll her again. If she wants to join a homeschool or unschool group or class or whatever she wants to do, I will help her. I try so hard to let her know how much I love her and just want the best for her. It just seems like nothing I do makes her happy. I&#39;ve even asked her if she wanted to go to counseling. She said she doesn&#39;t. I told her that I wouldn&#39;t make her if she didn&#39;t want to but I&#39;m worried that if I don&#39;t get her help that this unhappy feeling is going to get worse. I don&#39;t want her to do anything to hurt herself. She has never threatened to hurt herself but my ex-husband completed suicide in 2008 so whenever someone is unhappy, my mind always worries about the worst happening. (My ex-husband is not McKenzie&#39;s father. He was my older two children&#39;s father.) <br></p><p><br></p><p>Does anyone have any recommendations of what I should say or do to help my daughter? I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s just having hormonal changes since she&#39;s around that age. She has not started her period yet. I&#39;m feeling very helpless, and I&#39;m sure that she&#39;s feeling very helpless as well. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. This was a condensed version of what&#39;s been going on, as there is just too much, it would take pages to type it all. I&#39;ve only written to this group once or twice over the years. I read a lot. However, I have not read about anyone else having a similar situation as I have with McKenzie. I love her so much. I just want her to know that and to be happy. Thank you!</p></div></div>

&gt; &quot;what if I don&#39;t want to be happy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would give some serious thought to what your daughter asked. Because what I picked up from your post was PRESSURE.<br/>
<br/>
This may sound off, but think about it. It&#39;s sounding like you feel successful as an unschooling mother if she&#39;s happy. If she&#39;s not happy, you&#39;re failing. So all your focus is on making her happy. It&#39;s like her emotions are about you not about her.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
It seems like she&#39;s picked up that her emotions aren&#39;t hers to feel. They&#39;re a reflection of your success or failure.<br/>
<br/>
13 yos get moody. Let her feel what she feels. She doesn&#39;t need you to take on her feelings or fix them. She needs someone she can lean on. Someone who can be understanding of her feelings but also just *be* there for her.<br/>
<br/>
Create a soft nest for her to feel sad or confused. Bring her cocoa. Snuggle up and watch a movie together. <br/>
<br/>
While what she did understandably worried you, my feeling is that what led up to her running off 3 times would provide more insight into what issues she&#39;s dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid smacks his sister, that&#39;s wrong. But why did he smack his sister? It&#39;s the beginning that&#39;s the important part, not how it ended.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your response to her makes total sense! From the point of view of a mom.<br/>
<br/>
But from her point of view it&#39;s dismissive. She&#39;s feeling down on herself. You don&#39;t need to agree, but you&#39;re telling her she&#39;s wrong to have the feelings she does. She needs understanding that sometimes -- especially at 13 -- we question whether we&#39;re okay.<br/>
<br/>
If you were crying over something that someone else didn&#39;t understand, would it help you to be told your feelings were wrong? <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s going through a transition period. Her old self doesn&#39;t feel right any more. Her new self is unformed and awkward. Listen to her. Don&#39;t correct her. Don&#39;t ty to take hr feelings from her.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Parent/Teen Breakthrough? It&#39;s like an instruction manual for having a great relationship with a teen :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945159804">a few thoughts from the perspective of someone who had quite the rough patch ages 12-15:<div>I was someone who was continually told how sweet I was, and while there was so much more to me than being sweet, I felt if I expressed the totality of my complex self I would disappoint people, especially my parents. &nbsp;I distinctly remember feeling like I was living a lie, being sensitive to others&#39; expectations, not wanting to hurt them or embarrass them while stifling myself. &nbsp;Life, emotions, my changing body, everyone else were all so confusing to me and as a shy introvert I really would have preferred minimal contact with the outside world (unfortunately I was in school, which definitely did not help). &nbsp;I had one, maybe 2 real friends, and had no need for more (I&#39;m still that way, quite happily) though I extended myself to try to fit a social mold, which also did not help my sense of self or self esteem. &nbsp;I would have given anything to be allowed to stay home drawing, reading, watching movies, whatever quiet and sometimes morose (to outsiders) activities my deep and sensitive heart was drawn to. &nbsp;my mother was often worried about me and was emotional and had a hard time seeing me for me and not a product/reflection of her and her life&#39;s issues, so I kept many of my thoughts and feelings to myself. &nbsp;</div><div>with time and space, I grew into a confident person with good self esteem, not because my parents praised me, but because I made my way and set my own goals and achieved success on my own terms.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>does your daughter want to draw all day? &nbsp;if she&#39;s happy doing that, I think that&#39;s wonderful. &nbsp;if she wants more, I imagine this is where wordless strewing could come in.&nbsp;</div><div>does she want more friends? &nbsp;I had a terrible time with girl friends at that age, and my closest friends were boys through most of my teen years - boys were easier, less competitive with me, less emotional, less complicated, more fun. &nbsp;if she feels her 2 boy friends are enough companionship, is that ok for you? &nbsp;if it&#39;s not, that&#39;s your problem. &nbsp; if she wants more friends, there&#39;s not a lot you can do directly to help (my mom tried - it was awful); maybe mention - casually, only once - a group or event that fits her interests.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I hear very clearly how much you care for her and want her to be happy. &nbsp;but that&#39;s not your job, it&#39;s hers. &nbsp;she has her own path to follow, her own lessons and purpose this life, and her challenges are hers to navigate. &nbsp;creating and maintaining a safe nest for her and giving her the time and space she needs is better than telling her you want her to be happy. &nbsp;keep your emotional stuff out of her way. &nbsp;before saying anything to her, search your heart for whether she needs to hear it, or you do. &nbsp;most likely you&#39;ll stop yourself, and maybe instead ask if you can give her a hug, and leave it at that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>cheers-</div><div>cheri</div></div>

My 10 year old daughter tried school this year (the school year has just finished in Australia) - she went part time, and was able to satisfy her desire to see what school was like, and to see if she was missing out on anything by not going to school. I was worried about how she might be negatively impacted by being in the school system, but I was able to keep those thoughts to myself and talk about it positively with her and with others. She loved being there and was so happy to have the experience, and then decided herself that she wouldn&#39;t return next year - she found it wasn&#39;t any better than not being at school, and that unschooling was less tiring.
