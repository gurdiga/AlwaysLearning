<div id="ygrps-yiv-145870465">I have not read the whole research paper yet but the summary in this blog raises some interesting issues. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gaither.wordpress.com:80/2008/07/23/stroobant-on-homeschooling-school-resistant-children/">http://gaither.wordpress.com:80/2008/07/23/stroobant-on-homeschooling-school-resistant-children/</a><br/>
<br/>
I was particularly interested to explore further the comment in the blog ; &quot; Stroobant is particularly forceful in her critique of &quot;unschooling&quot; for its blindness to this coercive tendency.  Her point is not that we need some sort of even freer alternative to homeschooling, but that there is simply no escaping the dynamics of power and coercion. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
I enjoyed reading the very well-written summary of Stroobant&#39;s thesis on homeschooling school-resisting children. However, in defence of unschooling, I would say that most unschoolers are acutely aware of the constantly shifting power dynamics operating in their families. This is because most unschoolers have gone through a conscious and deliberate process of self-examination, looking honestly at how they interact with their child and how they can make these interactions more democratic, respectful and loving. While it is naive to think that any relationship operates in the absence of power, unschoolers strive for a `power-sharing&#39; arrangement, in which each family member&#39;s voice is heard and weighed equally. The subtleties of coersion present a daily challenge for unschoolers as much as for any parent, however unschoolers consciously strive for co-operation rather than coersion, and encourage their children to be respectful, interesting and joyful by being respectful, interesting and joyful. Of course every parent consciously and unconsciously shapes their child; unschoolers try to always remain alert to how this process is unfolding, and deliberately choose a way of life in which the values of love, peace, and respect are paramount.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-647435281">Nice comment.  I think that the researcher has a misunderstanding of unschooling, or an understanding that isn&#39;t based on what is going on on this list, at any rate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to &quot;share power equally&quot; with my children, as an unschooler, but I did do that at the beginning as a way to shift my whole mindset.  I no longer see that as the goal of unschooling--we&#39;ve moved past issues of power struggle because we are operating more from a model of partnership where that isn&#39;t really a main concern.   <br/>
<br/>
But if a person is unschooling from that point of view, then they might be defensive about the suggestion that there is any &quot;coersion&quot; or &quot;influence&quot; going on in the relationship.  Perhaps this is the researcher&#39;s understanding of unschoolers in general.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m responding to my own post here because it got me thinking about a<br/>
conversation that I had with Chamille last night.<br/>
<br/>
She was incredibly frustrated while texting the above mentioned friend<br/>
because this friend was stuck in a mindset of inevitable outcome and no<br/>
matter how Chamille tried to share with her how it could be different,<br/>
this girl couldn&#39;t see it.  We talked a lot about that last night, how<br/>
she was recreating her own family drama of inevitable &quot;bad&quot; outcomes and<br/>
that she was totally unaware that she was doing it, and because of that,<br/>
there really was very little Chamille could say to her that would help<br/>
her see it.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille could see it plain as day, and to her the solution the<br/>
&quot;problem&quot; was very simple, it wasn&#39;t convoluted with extra drama and<br/>
side stepping of other issues and navigating this, that, or the other<br/>
thing, to get from point A to point B.  She finally gave up and threw<br/>
the phone and said her friend just wasn&#39;t thinking clearly, which she<br/>
wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Then she went online and ended up talking to a newish online friend who<br/>
couldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the fact that she didn&#39;t go to school because she was<br/>
homeschooling.  She said something like, &quot;school doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
serving kids well... in the way they think&quot;.  She kept rephrasing what<br/>
she was saying but this person kept asking her if she was a teacher. <br/>
They are both about the same age and he lives in CA, so it wasn&#39;t like<br/>
he was from another country that didn&#39;t have homeschooling.  She read me<br/>
what was being said, and Chamille was very clear, but the message just<br/>
wasn&#39;t getting across.  She said that not only does the school not serve<br/>
him well, his parents lie to him about everything.<br/>
<br/>
One could say Chamille influences kids like that, and that makes sense<br/>
since kids influence each other a lot, especially when they are in<br/>
school.  In many ways, Chamille&#39;s dad and I are still the biggest<br/>
influence in her life, where many of her friends try to avoid parental<br/>
influence.  Perhaps that is the difference?  The influence is accecpted<br/>
and in fact appreciated and reciprocal.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131707864">I commented too though it&#39;s in moderation so we&#39;ll see when it shows up.<br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Well that�s interesting about power dynamics. This is something which<br/>
 </span></blockquote>many unschoolers purposely admit and plan around. They do that in at least a<br/>
couple of ways: by providing their children with as many options as possible<br/>
for making decisions and exploring the world; and by dredging out cultural<br/>
strongholds within their own psyche that prevent them from allowing options<br/>
usually thought to be inappropriate for children.<br/>
<br/>
So that: while children are learning about how to use power, many<br/>
unschooling parents are unlearning a great deal about how to use it. If a<br/>
balance isn�t in play, people who understand more about influence and<br/>
personal power may take charge of situations better left to others. They<br/>
(the parents and other adults in a child�s life, in other words) may end up<br/>
doing too much while others (children) don�t know how important their input<br/>
is or feel at a loss about where and when they can act. Conventional<br/>
parenting often takes advantage of this built-in inequality between adults<br/>
and children, while unschoolers actively seek not to do so � all while<br/>
protecting and advocating for the safety and freedom that may be lacking in<br/>
the wider world for their children.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers may fail in their endeavors, but that may not be for lack of<br/>
effort. It�s a lot of personal work really. [image: :)] Speaking as an<br/>
unschooler myself.<br/>
Thanks for reviewing Stroobant�s dissertation, Milton Gaither, and the<br/>
opportunity to post a comment. Pretty cool idea that she has touched on just<br/>
some of the points about schooling and schooling at home that so many<br/>
unschoolers talk about! Very exciting. &lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
While I agree with much of that, I don&#39;t like &quot;democratic&quot; in  <br/>
reference to how a family operates, and I bristled at the statements  <br/>
about &quot;unschoolers&quot; as a group, because there ARE unschoolers who  <br/>
think &quot;non-coercive&quot; and &quot;democratic,&quot; but I&#39;m not one of them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good, when speaking for a group, not to speak for the group. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s good when speaking about anything, to qualify the statements to  <br/>
&quot;in my experience,&quot; or &quot;from what I&#39;ve seen and read&quot; or &quot;Many  <br/>
unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The most famous example for this is the three-legged dog.   &quot;Dogs have  <br/>
four legs&quot; is not a true statement.  &quot;Most dogs have four legs&quot; is true.<br/>

I&#39;m thrilled about the positive outcomes of unschooling.  I LOVE the  <br/>
fact that it made me a better wife and a better dog owner.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also deeply aware of the stance of the huge number of people who  <br/>
think &quot;happy&quot; is to be saved as a reward for having suffered, and  <br/>
&quot;fun&quot; is a sin.<br/>

And, thinking about the non-coersion piece, there are times every so often when my husband &quot;coerces&quot; me about something or other.  It doesn&#39;t feel good in the moment, but if he&#39;s actually done that, he&#39;s almost always right.  And later I realize it.  And vice-versa.  Sometimes I need a pretty hard nudge!<br/>
