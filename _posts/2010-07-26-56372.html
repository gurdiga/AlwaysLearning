<div id="ygrps-yiv-256420154">After I put up the new phrases; old phrases post, the next e-mail I  <br/>
saw was from Any Garg at Wordsmith.org:<br/>
<br/>
--------------<br/>
Illustrating the importance of using the right word, Mark Twain once  <br/>
said, &quot;The difference between the almost-right word & the right word  <br/>
is really a large matter -- it&#39;s the difference between the lightning- <br/>
bug & the lightning.&quot;<br/>
--------------<br/>
<br/>
I like that a great deal today.  I suppose I would like it any day,  <br/>
but I&#39;ve been thinking of how to bring up the continuing problem of  <br/>
people complaining about their words being pointed at and questioned  <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Someone I threw off the list (it&#39;s rare, but it happens) wrote several  <br/>
snarky, sarcastic things to me on the side, or in posts I didn&#39;t let  <br/>
through. One was this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So take the word teaching out and replace it with showing. You are  <br/>
right Sandra. Semantics are more important than meeting the needs of  <br/>
the child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Neither lightning nor lightning-bugs (fireflies, in case that&#39;s not a  <br/>
universal-in-English term) are necessary to meet the needs of a child,  <br/>
but that doesn&#39;t make them equally safe or available or desirable.<br/>
<br/>
Someone (don&#39;t volunteer who; doesn&#39;t matter) recommended maybe  <br/>
finding a place where more holistic writing was welcome. God save us  <br/>
all from &quot;holistic writing,&quot; whatever that would be.  Seriously.    <br/>
That enough words would eventually make sense even if the little parts  <br/>
didn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to hear &quot;holistic music,&quot; or look at &quot;holistic art.&quot;  I  <br/>
want to experience the best, well-though-out, edited, deliberate  <br/>
communication that others have to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Holistic medicine is well and good, but that doesn&#39;t mean holistic  <br/>
rabbits are better than normal rabbits, or holistic combustion engines  <br/>
are better than something that just had a tune-up.  I don&#39;t want  <br/>
people trying to dis- and con-tort words so that they&#39;re thinking  <br/>
about holistic rocks, holistic clouds, holistic computer programming.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s going to write something like a post for this list, that  <br/>
piece of writing can be as important as any poem or novel IF IT  <br/>
CHANGES A LIFE.   There&#39;s a mountain of writing in the world that has  <br/>
never changed a single person&#39;s mind or actions in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Words matter.  Words are chosen, they don&#39;t just hop off of people  <br/>
like fleas.  They come from thought, and fingers on keyboards.   Think  <br/>
carefully and clearly.  If your thoughts are a jumble, don&#39;t post the  <br/>
jumble in public. If you don&#39;t think words are important, writing  <br/>
might not be a good hobby for you.  Someone who doesn&#39;t think  <br/>
different shades of blue are very important probably shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
advising painters.  Someone who can&#39;t figure out how to tune a guitar  <br/>
probably shouldn&#39;t be coaching anyone about stringed instruments of  <br/>
any sort.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay for someone to think people to think words are not  <br/>
important.  They shouldn&#39;t be writing about the principles of  <br/>
unschooling, though, if they think principles and rules are just two  <br/>
different words for the same thing, or that &quot;helping someone learn&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;teaching&quot; are exactly the same.    (Thinking it isn&#39;t as bad as  <br/>
writing and saying so.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450506849">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
when talking about words. I would like to ask if a group is called<br/>
Homeschoolers group or unschoolers group, what is one expecting to look for<br/>
in that group. The two are radically different I agree. But here in India<br/>
since the whole movement is new, both are yet to get clearly separated.<br/>
<br/>
Why I ask this is because I thought since words are important, then when we<br/>
say homeschoolers or unschoolers group, is the group also required to let<br/>
issues other than those directly related to these two words, go through. I<br/>
am not the owner or the moderator of any such group, but I still need to<br/>
know how broad can this be. We constantly get requests from moms who have<br/>
one year olds, two year olds even infants wanting to homeschool or unschool.<br/>
They want to be listed because they want the active homeschoolers or<br/>
unschoolers to inspire  them and help them make up their minds. Till their<br/>
kids are ready for that school-going age.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have issues with this. Because I feel that many start using the group<br/>
as agony aunt column. and surprisingly some members are very happy about<br/>
this kind of inclusion. I am not. Am I being paranoid about this. I know<br/>
that in India the group is really small and some feel this is our only<br/>
chance of expanding. But I feel better to be small and cohesive than having<br/>
to deal with issues from all over and here and there.<br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong in feeling this or should I just let it be.<br/>
<br/>
Dola<br/>

<br/>
Generalizing from other places, Dola, I doubt they will ever be  <br/>
clearly separated, so don&#39;t worry about that.<br/>
<br/>
Even lists clearly indicated as &quot;radical unschooling&quot; have  different  <br/>
tone, flavor and slants.<br/>
<br/>
When a group is about homeschooling, I expect them to be talking about  <br/>
laws more, and about how to teach.  There&#39;s no benefit to arguing with  <br/>
them about that; let them do it.<br/>
<br/>
When a group is about unschooling if people are talking about how to  <br/>
teach then I DO say something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why I ask this is because I thought since words are important, then  <br/>
when we<br/>

let<br/>

<br/>
There are no requirements of groups in general.<br/>
The person who founded the list, or who inherits a list--whoever has  <br/>
the &quot;tools&quot; to close the list down, or to edit posts, or to approve  <br/>
new members, or to change the description of the list--is the person  <br/>
who can make requirements or not.  If a list is totally slack and  <br/>
accepts any old topics, some people seem happy and others wander off  <br/>
to find a different list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I am not the owner or the moderator of any such group, but I  <br/>
still need to<br/>
know how broad can this be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It can be as broad as the owner or moderator wants it to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430604686">Bering in this list has totally changed how I write and talk about things.<br/>
I am much  more aware of the words I use or don&#39;t.<br/>
Its amazing how words are important. It helps me think clear.<br/>
I now stop and think before I speak or write. <br/>
I am still working on it and the more I pay attention to words the<br/>
clearer my thoughts are.<br/>
Nothing like reading and listening to people talk/discuss when <br/>
they are clear. <br/>
Thanks for keeping the list  on subject too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405036212">I&#39;ve learned a lot about simple, single, plain-old words since I joined this list not that long ago.<br/>
<br/>
A day ago I said about my 8-month old puppy, after a 5 days of camping and 4 days in Denver hotels, &quot;she&#39;s learned a lot of lessons on this trip.&quot; To which I instantly had to correct myself... &quot;She&#39;s learned a lot on this trip.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The puppy didn&#39;t learn lessons, she was living. My girls were living too! Each and every one of us was. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what separates this list from all the rest. Semantics matters. It is helpful to be aware of the words we use when describing our relationships with our children, our spouses, our family. Words can mean the difference between a day/week/month/year full of overwhelming stress or not! Remarkably so! I think that this list is especially helpful for reminding us of that importance, and I have to say thanks to Sandra, Joyce, and Pam for continuing to emphasize that.</div>
