<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464975856">Wow!  Great topics today.<br/>
I totally agree with Sandra on both the breastfeeding and the child that was <br/>
acting out issues!!<br/>
My first thought when I read about the child&#39;s aggressive behavior towards <br/>
her brother is that she hates his guts for being born and stealing Mom and <br/>
Dad&#39;s attention.<br/>
It may be irrational....but I hated my sis for being born for a long time <br/>
too. It doesn&#39;t mean they always hate them, but there is a level of <br/>
resentment.<br/>
I am best friends with both my birth siblings now, so it will turn out ok. <br/>
She is definitely crying out for one on one attention.<br/>
I really need to do more of this at my house right now too.<br/>
It&#39;s hard to do sometimes, but kids really need that.<br/>
<br/>
I totally do not understand what is so hard about nursing discreetly. I can <br/>
nurse my little guy without a blanket or any kind of cover...just lifting my <br/>
shirt and not show anything. Ok, maybe a little flash of skin, but it&#39;s so <br/>
easy to latch him on and not flash my boob.<br/>
I think some people TRY to &quot;let it hang out&quot; to make a point.<br/>
I do think our society needs to get over it sometimes. But to purposely <br/>
aggravate or upset people only causes people to resist further.<br/>
It isn&#39;t going against beliefs to just respect other people&#39;s discomfort. I <br/>
can still nurse my baby whenever he needs it, where ever we <br/>
are....sensitivity to other people&#39;s feelings is not a bad idea.<br/>
I think your wording was just fine on the first blurb.<br/>
You could hem and haw over it forever and you&#39;ll never have the &quot;perfect&quot; <br/>
statement that won&#39;t offend anybody.<br/>
You could say nothing and offend people at the hotel and cause them to <br/>
further distance themselves from understanding.<br/>
You could re-word it to try and not offend a single LLL person and someone in <br/>
that group is still going to not like the insinuation that she cover up a <br/>
little.<br/>
Oh well.<br/>
Just do what is necessary and it will work out.<br/>
I thought the wording was perfect.<br/>
Simple and to the point.<br/>
<br/>
Lemon Curd?<br/>
It&#39;s this sweet, delicious spread that has a gel like consistency. That&#39;s the <br/>
best way I can describe it.<br/>
It&#39;s bright yellow, has a lot of egg in it and lemon of course and tastes <br/>
soooo excellent on a hot buttered crumpet!!<br/>
Crumpets are the little round (english muffin size) bread with lotsa holes in <br/>
it....all the better for the lemon curd and butter to sink down into. Yummmmy!<br/>
I will look for my sis&#39;s lemon curd recipe if you want. I&#39;ve also bought it <br/>
at Albertsons for close to four bucks for a LITTLE jar. Not cheap. But oh so <br/>
worth it.<br/>
They also sell raspberry and other flavored curds but lemon is the best.<br/>
The only one worth the money in my opinion.<br/>

<br/>
Me too.  I wasn&#39;t too happy with my mom, either, for making me live on the <br/>
outskirts of their new relationship.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think some people TRY to &quot;let it hang out&quot; to make a point.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know they do.  Some are very exhibitionist about it, and it&#39;s embarrassing <br/>
for those who would like for the stigma to go away.  Those folks are the <br/>
two-steps-back in the steady progression toward acceptance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988147745">&lt;&lt;And when alone they are not the same as when we are all together&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is so true.  I have 5 children and when they were young we also had<br/>
young foster kids.  Now, I&#39;m not sure whether it was a good idea or not.<br/>
The kids learned about helping others and they continue to feel the desire<br/>
to help the less fortunate; but, they didn&#39;t get a lot of alone time.<br/>
<br/>
When we are all together, it can get overwhelming.  Any time your fanny hits<br/>
a chair, the four youngest want to sit close enough to you so you can<br/>
cuddle.  The three middle ones want to assist in every, single task you<br/>
undertake.  All 5 are extremely talkative and the two boys respond with<br/>
&quot;what?&quot; to almost anything that is said to them, requiring that it be<br/>
repeated.<br/>
<br/>
But alone, life is wonderful and good.  We actually have conversations and<br/>
laugh and are silly together.  As dh and I have been working to have more<br/>
and more alone time with each child, things are much improved even when we<br/>
are all together.<br/>
<br/>
The way we work it is each person in the family has their &quot;day&quot;.  7 of us, 7<br/>
days in a week, it works out.  On your day, you are the winner of any<br/>
&quot;squabble&quot;, like picking a blessing, riding in the front seat, picking a<br/>
television show.  But the big one is helping fix dinner.  Used to be a big<br/>
problem because if one came to help, they all came.  Several are young<br/>
enough that I need a sharp eye....and I don&#39;t have that many eyes.  We also<br/>
read together privately.  The child and I cuddle on my bed and I rub their<br/>
backs as I read to them.<br/>
-------------<br/>
Just wanted to say that I got lots of positive response from our support<br/>
group about my &quot;recess&quot; idea.  And that I will be gone for a few days....off<br/>
to a goat show with only my oldest.  I&#39;m very excited.  Of course, had to<br/>
spend the morning shaving a goat&#39;s butt but it was definitely worth it.<br/>
