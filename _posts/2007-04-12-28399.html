<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597631789">My 10 yro dd is going to be in a play in a couple weeks.  I gave her the script yesterday to go over.  The script is in regular print straight from the computer.  She has decided to copy it onto another piece of paper and is writing in all capital letters, much bigger print.  She can read, but doesn&#39;t have the desire to read books yet, which is fine by me, because I know she&#39;ll do it when she is ready.  Should I worry because she wants the letters bigger and in all caps or is that just something natural in her brain development?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you,<br/>

At her same age, I would write things to memorize them.  We had to memorize<br/>
a poem every week-- I just waited til Thursday then would write it over and<br/>
over and over before bed and I could recite it on Friday.  The classes I<br/>
took the best notes for are the classes I didn&#39;t have to study for, it was<br/>
already up there.<br/>
There&#39;s some strange connection between my hand writing and my brain<br/>
remembering.  I still do it!<br/>
-or-<br/>
Maybe she wants it big and clear so as she learns it she can have it further<br/>
away from her, like on the floor, for backup when she forgets a line.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not a strange connection at all - its an aspect of kinesthetic <br/>
learning/intelligence. Some people process information in more <br/>
physical ways. Many kinesthetic folks (like me!) not only like to <br/>
write things out but write Large. I got through my first semester of <br/>
organic chemistry (memorizing a gazillion formulas) by going into <br/>
empty classrooms and writing them out on the chalkboard in big whole-<br/>
arm movements. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another link to multiple intelligences that has a few ideas I <br/>
hadn&#39;t seen elsewhere, btw:<br/>
