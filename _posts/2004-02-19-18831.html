<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525897495">Thanks for sharing this Dar.   Coming from a Mom with two budding actresses.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  My dds are ages 9 and 6.  I&#39;m going to share Rain&#39;s story with them.<br/>
<br/>
I also appreciate hearing the story because I&#39;m now relating it to our<br/>
situation.  We&#39;re moving.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving an area that I love,  Bemidji, MN.  Northern Minnesota-- pine trees,<br/>
lakes, rivers.  Lots of woods.  We live on a 2 1/2 acre wooded lot close to<br/>
a lake, miles and miles of trails for either hiking, biking or cross country<br/>
skiing.  All of which I love to do.  :(<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so you get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re moving to Moorhead, MN,  right across the river from Fargo, ND.  Yes,<br/>
Fargo.  Not quite like the movie,  but close.  That area of MN/ND is very<br/>
different from Bemidji.  Its on the prairie and has lots of open spaces.<br/>
We&#39;ll probably be moving into town,  hardly no yard,  but pretty good sized<br/>
house.  Another interesting detail will be that both sets of grandparents<br/>
live there and my 2 sister in-laws and 1 brother in-law.  Which could be<br/>
good and bad.  2 of the 3 in-laws are teachers and don&#39;t get unschooling at<br/>
all.  Two grandparents really get unschooling pretty well,  the other 2<br/>
don&#39;t but are at least trying.  So that won&#39;t be too bad.<br/>
<br/>
So,,,  when I first hear that my husband has been offered this job I&#39;m<br/>
wondering,, what are thinking??<br/>
<br/>
But then I start thinking,  bigger city.   Maybe there can be more<br/>
opportunities for the kids.    Through all of this we have been talking with<br/>
the kids about it all.  At first they aren&#39;t very happy, leaving their<br/>
friends and all.  But we&#39;re doing this because my dh is really unhappy in<br/>
his job now and its an opportunity for him.  They are excited to see their<br/>
grandparents and counsins more.   I&#39;m also hoping that with more people<br/>
there might be some unschoolers there!<br/>
<br/>
Back to Dar&#39;s story,  well,  with Fargo/Moorhead being a bigger community<br/>
the girls will have more opportunities for acting, singing, dancing.<br/>
Bemidji only has about 15,000, F-M has about 150,000.   There&#39;s more people,<br/>
hence, more shows and things like that!    So,  there is becoming this<br/>
silver lining.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I also have a son (10)  who is a big gamer and trading card player.  I<br/>
believe a bigger city will have lots more going on for him too.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m trying to see this as maybe a transitional time where the kids are<br/>
going to have more opportunities and maybe I can get my bits of woods and<br/>
such on weekends or on vacations.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are now getting pretty excited,  they don&#39;t like the woods and<br/>
outdoors quite as much as me.  I&#39;m remembering back, my husband and I both<br/>
grew up in Moorhead, that there are some trails by the Red River.  Its<br/>
amidst city,  but there are some trees there.  Also, we are moving farther<br/>
west, so we can get to Montana/ Yellowstone and all of that quicker!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to be OK,  I&#39;ll try and find my peace in pockets of nature and<br/>
in the fact that the kids and my dh will be  happy.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli~  trying to be optimistic about it all<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] First job<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rain will be working as an actress, playing one of the stepsisters in a<br/>
&gt; dinner theatre production of Cinderella. She had so much fun at the<br/>
&gt; audition that she was still walking on clouds an hour later, and the<br/>
&gt; stepsister is just a dream role for her. She would have done it for<br/>
&gt; free... but they&#39;re paying her for all rehearsals and shows, starting<br/>
&gt; from call time. The show rehearses for 4 weeks and then runs for 12<br/>
&gt; weeks, with two shows for school groups on Wednesdays and a show open to<br/>
&gt; the public on Saturdays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I may be biased, as her mother, but I thought she really stood out at the<br/>
&gt; audition. She was thinking, she was innovating, she was creating. She<br/>
&gt; remembered the basics - project, speak slowly and enunciate, stay in<br/>
&gt; character,don&#39;t block other actors  - while adding appropriate and funny<br/>
&gt; physical movements and hilarious expressions, interacting with the other<br/>
&gt; characters on stage, and saying her lines so they sounded fresh even<br/>
&gt; after 5 groups had run the same scene. I was and am very, very proud.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
