<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086150651">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sometimes people say &quot;Children&#39;s tastebuds are immature,&quot; implying <br/>
adults are the good and right stage of human life, but children <br/>
aren&#39;t quite real yet. Maybe children are the right way, and adults <br/>
are living more by rules and charts than their own instincts. But <br/>
it&#39;s clearly true that there are things children like a lot that <br/>
adults don&#39;t love as much. It&#39;s very likely that there are instincts <br/>
at play, and that children&#39;s nutritional needs are different than <br/>
adults.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Actually, it&#39;s the reverse. Children have more tastebuds than adults do.<br/>
Here&#39;s a bit of an article by Michael Berry on The Physiology of Taste...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just as many folks start out with 20-20 vision in their youth and wind up wearing tri-focals come retirement, your senses of taste and smell changes over time. The average adult reportedly has approximately 10,000 taste buds, but children have more, including some dotted along the inside of their cheeks. Infants seem to arrive hard-wired to react to bitterness and sweetness, though the ability to detect saltiness takes six months or so to develop. The childish craving for sweets typically declines during adolescence, probably as a way of limiting caloric intake.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The actual number of tastbuds vary from source to source, but they are all in agreement about the fact that children have more tastebuds than adults, and therefore are more sensitive to &#39;strong&#39; tastes.<br/>

And, if I&#39;m not mistaken, we *keep* losing taste buds.<br/>
<br/>
The elderly tend to hang on to the remaining &quot;sweet buds&quot; the longest, <br/>
so we enjoy sweet foods the (much) older we get.<br/>

treatment killed off many of my taste buds.  They come back,  <br/>
fortunately, after about 8 weeks.  It was weird how things tasted;  <br/>
water tasted really bad, sweetened tea was tolerable.  The only thing  <br/>
I could do to make food palatable was spice it up; I&#39;d never been a  <br/>
tabasco user before, but I found myself making meals I could add it to  <br/>
so I could taste *something.*<br/>
