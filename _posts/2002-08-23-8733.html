&gt;understood it, I might be able to find a way to help it along or something.<br/>

I put fibromyalgia and Krebs cycle into google.  (Yes, it IS habit<br/>
forming!)  Since I know almost nothing about medicine I can&#39;t tell you<br/>
how good the hits I got were.  I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s solid and what&#39;s just<br/>
a come-on to get your money. <br/>
<br/>
This one has a nice picture (simple) of the Krebs cycle.  (scroll down)  <br/>

This one is a vitamin selling place, but they attempt to give some<br/>
scientific (?) rationale for what they are selling.  (And there are some<br/>
footnotes to some medical research about fibro.)<br/>

You&#39;ve probably seen a zillion fibro webpages already, though.<br/>
