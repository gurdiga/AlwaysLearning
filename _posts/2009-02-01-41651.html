Two  notes are there, and both lead to more stuff about the project,  <br/>
but if you want to help with a research project, there&#39;s a link in  <br/>
the upper right hand of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354109025">I did the survey and it didn&#39;t take too long at all. It is fun to sort<br/>
the cards -- I am thinking of keeping them and having my husband look<br/>
through them/sort them. Thought they might be a good conversation<br/>
starter about parenting and future decisions we have to make for our<br/>
children. He still pretty much rolls his eyes and thinks I&#39;m crazy if<br/>
he sees or hears the word &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I am being patient and<br/>
biding my time. The funny part is how many things we do that are in<br/>
line with unschooling -- he just doesn&#39;t know it! I understand now<br/>
what people mean when they say that it just made sense to them to have<br/>
their kids at home, that it seemed like the natural progression to how<br/>
they were parenting...<br/>
