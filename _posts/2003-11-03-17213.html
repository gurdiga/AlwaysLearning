&gt; Sandra, it might be better to let Holly see the looks on their faces as<br/>
&gt; they go into the school in the morning..<br/>
<br/>
Exactly!!<br/>
<br/>
I remember when mine were still in school and I&#39;d watch all the buses go by,<br/>
after mine had gotten on.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my,,,,, such sad, long faces.   My kids were out of the school system<br/>
shortly after that.<br/>
<br/>
I bet it will pass,  for Holly,  I mean.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I do like about the unschoolers who are here and and at a few<br/>
other places---  Is that you would allow her to go if she really wanted to.<br/>
I&#39;ve met too many homeschoolers who wouldn&#39;t,, and it makes me sick.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have met some unschoolers who say they wouldn&#39;t allow their<br/>
children to go also,  but I really find that contradictory to an unschooling<br/>
parenting style.   I guess I would question what kind-of &#39;unschooling&#39; they<br/>
do.    Forced unschooling??   Hmmmmm......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh,  and Sandra, tell Marty that I think his costume sounded hilarious!<br/>
Very creative thinking!  I would have gotten a kick out of seeing it.<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t know me, but you could tell him I waved him down while he was<br/>
swimming at the conference, to tell him I was stuffing a DVD into your bag.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll remember that,  maybe not.   &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
