 </span></blockquote>I did that with Lars when he was 12 and wanted to try school. He *was* way <br/>
behind the other kids in the basics, and I didn&#39;t want that to bite him at <br/>
school. I also didn&#39;t want to give the teacher&#39;s union any ammunition to <br/>
use against homeschoolers. (They&#39;re all behind. I had this one kid in my <br/>
grade 8 class who could barely read, etc., blah, blah.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he took all the comments about being &quot;behind&quot; to heart. It&#39;s really <br/>
affected him badly. He still has a goal of &quot;catching up&quot;.<br/>

Jack went to school. Kindergarten, his choice, and after my initial shock it <br/>
was fine. (Until the end of the year when they realized I was serious about <br/>
the fact that he wouldn&#39;t be coming back, again his choice. &lt;g&gt;) At the <br/>
beginning of the year, I made sure they (the principal and teacher) knew that Jack was <br/>
there because HE wanted to be not because of some state mandated law and that <br/>
honestly I did not care a *fig* if he went or not. His teacher got it, the <br/>
principal didn&#39;t hence the small problem at the end of the year, easily resolved <br/>
with a smart letter. We are still very good friends with his teacher and see <br/>
her often, and both kids have adopted her parents who live a few blocks away, <br/>
as surrogate grandparents. Better than Darin&#39;s mom who lives less than an hour <br/>
away and almost as good as mine who can&#39;t be closer, but wish they could. So <br/>
everyone won in this situation except for the principal. &lt;g&gt; His teacher and I <br/>
talk at least once a week and she even uses some of my ideas in her <br/>
classroom. One small step at a time! ;o)<br/>
