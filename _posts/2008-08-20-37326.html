<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378736760">&quot;This is a video of Danny Osmond and Weird Al dancing to the ENTIRE<br/>
song in front of a green screen. Much more than the snippets that are<br/>
shown in the video. I always thought it was a blue screen, not green.<br/>
Donny Osmond is a very good sport, in my opinion.&quot;<br/>

This was hilarious.  I have seen Weird Al more times than I can count at the<br/>
Orange County Fair.  He really is amazing.  I will show this video to Drew<br/>
when he wakes up.<br/>
<br/>
I saw Donny Osmond in concert when I was about 10 at the Southern California<br/>
Girl Scout Diamond Jubilee Roundup at Glen Helen.  Thousands of tween girls<br/>
swooning... :)<br/>
