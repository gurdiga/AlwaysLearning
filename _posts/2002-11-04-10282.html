One thing I did and still do is make sure there is other food ready all<br/>
the time.  Little kids don&#39;t like to wait for food,  and even at ten,<br/>
when he knows how to make so many things, my son still sometimes prefers<br/>
fast.<br/>
<br/>
I make a sandwich or two in the morning and cut it and wrap it separately<br/>
and have it in the fridge, ready to grab.   I wash fruit and leave it on<br/>
the counter.   I wash grapes and carrots and put them into little zip loc<br/>
bags.  I always have bananas and nuts and seeds.     <br/>
<br/>
Kids will balance their food consumption naturally as long as they have<br/>
choices.  If the only choice for quick and handy food is chips, etc. then<br/>
that&#39;s what they&#39;ll eat.  If  other choices are just as quick and handy<br/>
they get equal consideration.  <br/>
<br/>
It works!  You&#39;ll survive.  = )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784952136">Thanks for all the encouragement about the food thing. I do truly believe that no limits<br/>
will work. It just has been really painful watching them gorge. There were a couple of days<br/>
when they only ate candy, soda and chips. BUT I have seen some glimmers of hope. Yesterday<br/>
I asked Jason if he was only eating candy because I had not let him for so long. He said<br/>
yes. I also asked him if he was afraid that I would change my mind, he said yes. I reassured<br/>
him that I was not going to change my mind. Today he asked for 4 grilled cheese sandwiches<br/>
for lunch (he ate 3) and ate much less junk then he has for the past 2 weeks. He seems more<br/>
open to listening to me also. A couple of weeks ago, I made the mistake of cringing when<br/>
he asked for mountain dew when we were out with my grandmother and aunt and cousins. I<br/>
explained to him that it had more caffeine then most sodas and I was worried that he<br/>
would start getting hyper. Of course this made him want it more. He ended up drinking <br/>
2 cans and bouncing off the walls, getting all over his brother etc. Not exactly<br/>
the behavior I wanted around my grandmother! The next day, I talked to him about it.<br/>
He said that he liked feeling that way ;o) thought that it was kind of neat. I told<br/>
him that it was hard on me when we were out with people because it took more energy<br/>
to parent him. I asked him if he would mind only drinking it when we were not out with<br/>
people (stressing that it was his decision). He said yes. So he has been drinking it<br/>
at home and seeing how it affects him. If he wants to drink it next time we are out<br/>
I will let him, but hopefully this compromise will work. I think that he is just interested<br/>
in how things he eats make him feel. So in the short run, it is more work because I have<br/>
to be more &quot;on&quot; as a parent when he is bouncing off the walls, but in the long run<br/>
I think that he will be more aware of how he feels when he eats different things.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to leave more healthy stuff easily available, but it can be hard as Jason<br/>
is a *very* picky eater (so was/am I). I have never made him eat anything he did not<br/>
want to (my parents were very controlling about making me eat things I did not like).<br/>
We have lots of conversations about how mommy did not like many things when she was<br/>
little, but tastes change as you get older. He is pretty open to trying new things, but <br/>
I do not force him. The funny thing, I started out, when he was little, planning on letting<br/>
him eat what he wanted. I remember when he was 2, being vindicated in front of my mother<br/>
when I let him have some birthday cake *before*  lunch and he still ate all of his <br/>
lunch. However as he got older, I panicked about the junk food thing and started <br/>
restricting it. sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again...I may come back for support before he finds his balance. Why is my opinion of myself as a mother so tied up in what my children eat?<br/>
