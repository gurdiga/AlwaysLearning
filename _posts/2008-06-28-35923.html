<div id="ygrps-yiv-990207886">I agree, Sandra, that your way is more accurate/better...but when I say, <br/>
&quot;he taught himself&quot; says a whole lot in a few words.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to be perfectly frank- I don&#39;t think I did help my son to read <br/>
(apart from obvious and important ways, like owning books, and reading <br/>
to him every now and again).  When I tried to teach him the alphabet- he <br/>
didn&#39;t want a bar of it...likewise, when I noticed he had begun to read <br/>
without me even knowing he knew his letters- I tried to teach him some <br/>
other things I didn&#39;t think he would glean on his own.  That was a <br/>
disaster too.  I only helped him when I stopped trying to help, if you <br/>
know what I mean.<br/>

*** -=-I know that &quot;She taught herself&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;appropriate&quot; if<br/>
you ask Sandra (lol), but with others outside the unschooling world, it<br/>
seems like the best answer I can come up with. -=-<br/>
<br/>
What about &quot;She learned it gradually on her own, with just a little<br/>
bit of help&quot; or We helped her when she asked, and she figured it out<br/>
on her own!&quot;***</div>

It does.<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t help move you and your audience (or your son) away  <br/>
from the idea of &quot;teaching&quot; toward solid faith in and understanding  <br/>
of natural learning.<br/>

<br/>
Well then, leave that part out.  Some kids did accept help.<br/>
<br/>
But how did he &quot;teach&quot; himself something he didn&#39;t know?  What he did  <br/>
was figure it out in his own way.  He learned it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I do, but that kind of talk can make some parents think they don&#39;t  <br/>
need to do ANYTHING but put out food and water for their kids and the  <br/>
kids will learn as much as Pam&#39;s kids or Joyce&#39;s or mine (or  <br/>
whoever&#39;s kids you might be thinking are proof or example of  <br/>
unschooling).  The richer the life, the easier the learning.<br/>
<br/>
Getting away from talk of teaching does help people understand what  <br/>
unschooling can be.<br/>

What I&#39;ve found is that I don&#39;t need to worry about my children&#39;s<br/>
ideas of learning vs.teaching. That helped ME early on, but they have<br/>
no hang ups or baggage surrounding the idea of &quot;teach&quot; and they use it<br/>
without any of that baggage being present.<br/>
<br/>
They say things like &quot;I taught myself&quot; and there is complete<br/>
confidence in their ability to LEARN. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an issue for<br/>
them. They come at the world with such a different view than all of<br/>
our schooled minds do.<br/>

That&#39;s probably true of a lot of kids, but not of all.  The more a  <br/>
mom (who DOES have baggage and uncertainty) uses the word  <br/>
&quot;teach&quot; (and all the assumptions that come with it for her) the less  <br/>
she&#39;ll relax into &quot;learn.&quot;<br/>
