<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798873170">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I once saw a list somewhere of great movies and books that portrayed  <br/>
unschoolers, and now I can&#39;t find it!  Anyone know what I&#39;m talking  <br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE this source for videos/DVDs...<br/>

and this is one of our favorite online stores, and we bought some  <br/>
great films here too:<br/>

Sara Kate (5) has been totally into watching Little House on The  <br/>
Prairie, we&#39;re only on Season 2, and there&#39;s like 24 episodes on each  <br/>
DVD, and a gazillion seasons, right?  I remember watching it as a  <br/>
little girl in the 70&#39;s, and it totally holds up today!  FINE  <br/>
entertainment!  Sara went to a hula-hooping dance playshop the other  <br/>
day wearing her pioneer bonnet!<br/>
<br/>
Also she LOVES all 4 Pippi Longstocking movies, I didn&#39;t realize it  <br/>
before, but Pippi is the classic unschooler!  I LOVE Pippi!<br/>
