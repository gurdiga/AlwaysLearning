<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Subject: Tapes from HSC conference for sale!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope this comes out legibly!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve listened to the four I was in on and they all came out clearly and <br/>
&gt; seem <br/>
&gt; good and  useful!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will have some tapes with me in Texas and South Carolina when I go there <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; October, but for other people or those in a hurry, here&#39;s this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t be speaking from the same notes (I try not to) for either of those, <br/>
&gt; so it won&#39;t be a direct repeat, although I&#39;m always on that unschooling <br/>
&gt; topic...<br/>

nos.?<br/>
Can anyone tell me a little more about what&#39;s covered on each one? I think I <br/>
could persuade dh to listen to one easier than I could get him to read about <br/>
it! <br/>
thanks  <br/>

You could look on the website for descriptions of the workshops, and it&#39;s <br/>
still linked from SandraDodd.com/speaking (under recent conferences).<br/>
