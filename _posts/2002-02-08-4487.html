<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807568820">OK, our latest challange.  I have a couple of nudists<br/>
here apparently.  I don&#39;t have a problem with them<br/>
running around the house nude sometimes, but lately it<br/>
has been ALL the time.  The complain of being cold,<br/>
but won&#39;t get dressed, or they get dressed for a<br/>
little bit and then shed the clothes again.  I can&#39;t<br/>
have anyone over, and I feel like a mole with the<br/>
shades drawn all the time.  I can&#39;t go anywhere,<br/>
because they won&#39;t get dressed.  Even trips to the<br/>
park and bike rides are not enticing enough to get my<br/>
oldest, Thomas, into clothes.  He says &quot;Naah...no<br/>
thanks.  I just want to be naked.&quot;  So I can&#39;t take<br/>
his brother out and we are stuck here.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of this has to do with Thomas&#39; Sensory<br/>
Intgration Dysfuntion.  This is where the scratching<br/>
thing comes from too, it helps him process when he is<br/>
having stress of too much sensory input to have his<br/>
back, head or arms scratched.  This is the child that<br/>
has to put his socks on inside out, have all the tags<br/>
cut out of his clothes, and wears only certain kinds<br/>
of fabrics and cuts of clothes (nothing too baggy,<br/>
scratchy, stiff or thick, etc.)  Alex does it more<br/>
often just because he wants to do what Thomas is<br/>
doing.  <br/>
<br/>
I really want them to have healthy attitudes about<br/>
their bodies, but I am wondering if I have to move to<br/>
a nudist colony to avoid being a hermit.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873288607">I have a nudest too.  They out grow it.  How<br/>
old are your kids?  Lexie will rarely be<br/>
naked and I find it sad.  ONe day Janene was<br/>
dancing with great joy and abandon to Joseph<br/>
and the brightly colored rain pants, naked<br/>
and free.  It was beautiful to watch. Then I<br/>
watched Lexie.  She was watchign Janene and<br/>
slowly taking her sleep shirt off.  She<br/>
looked at me to see if I noticed and I<br/>
smiled.  She took it off and joined her<br/>
sister and they enjoyed the freedom of their<br/>
bodies.  Too bad society has influenced me so<br/>
much that I couldn&#39;t join them.  How sad.<br/>
<br/>
And about going places.  we used to fight<br/>
with Janene about that too. For a while we<br/>
made every trip include one to the park.  Now<br/>
it&#39;s not an issue.  The other day she was<br/>
naked and Lexie went outside to play with<br/>
neighbor girls.  A bit later Janene<br/>
disappeared and returned a few minutes later<br/>
fully clothed.  Later I realized she had no<br/>
underwear on but hey, who needs those!<br/>
<br/>
My girls also rarely wear shoes.  It drives<br/>
all of our Asian neighbors batty (we live in<br/>
a predominately Korean neighborhood, for they<br/>
wear shoes outside and socks or house<br/>
slippers inside.  but guess which house the<br/>
kids are always playing in?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998974298">My friend has three boys who all decided to get naked.  Their poor older<br/>
sister was just grossed out by the whole thing and the last straw was<br/>
when she found them jumping, in all their naked glory on her bed.  Their<br/>
mom found a Tarzan movie and made them all loin cloths with the<br/>
stipulation that underwear must be worn to protect their sisters<br/>
sensibilities.  They were ( mostly ) naked for a few months but<br/>
eventually put clothes back on.  <br/>
<br/>
Have they discovered body painting yet?  That might be messy.  = )<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d explain that they had to be dressed to go places because cute as they<br/>
are not everyone wants to see their little behinders hanging out.  Then<br/>
I&#39;d go to the fun places without them once or twice.  If that doesn&#39;t<br/>
work Sandra had some info about places it was ok to be naked...<br/>
<br/>
Fake fur from the fabric store to make cave man clothes out of?  Would<br/>
you be embarrassed taking little cave men to the store with you?   We<br/>
went everywhere for weeks with a cloth string grocery bag on my sons<br/>
head.  He was Mrs. Quarks and he suffered from  the dreaded kirksigurkis.<br/>
 We got a lot of strange looks but thankfully it wasn&#39;t contagious. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463490163">Yep you are right, Sandra.  I understand their reasons, just don&#39;t share<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
This family has two very bright children. The mom has a Masters or Dr in<br/>
Music, she teaches Lexie Piano, and Lexie has to bring clean socks when<br/>
she goes.  Lexie NEVER wears socks (except for snow play last week, I<br/>
don&#39;t think her feet have seen socks in a year!) except for piano<br/>
lessons. Anyway, both kids, the boy is 9 and the girl is 7, are<br/>
beautiful, gifted, sweet kids, but they rarely have a chance to be<br/>
kids.  They are allowed mud play, but only on certain days and under<br/>
certain conditions.  Their house is spot less, and I do mean totally<br/>
spot less. There are no clues that children live there, except the small<br/>
shoes in the entry way.  But the kids spend time over here, where they<br/>
can play play station and computer games, or go play in the mud, or<br/>
write all over our sidewalk with chalk.  They are in the gifted classes<br/>
at school and I know that the mom doesn&#39;t really agree with the way we<br/>
raise our children but she is far to polite to say anything, and also,<br/>
it&#39;s really hard to dispute Lexie and Janene&#39;s skills, so that helps.  I<br/>
think it would be harder if Lexie were a late reader or if she wasn&#39;t so<br/>
verbal.  Even though the 7 year old is almost a year older than Lexie,<br/>
Lexie&#39;s skills are far above her and both kids are in gifted classes, at<br/>
a magnet school.  So while I understand their reasons and respect their<br/>
culture, I am often saddened by the, well, I;m not sure what to call it,<br/>
it just seems those kids never are kids.  They both play piano and<br/>
violin and something else, and are gifted musically, but man, it&#39;s so<br/>
nice to see them come to my house and relax and play crash bandicoot.<br/>

spending 2 1/2 years living with my in-laws.  We<br/>
moved out in September.  I can TOTALLY relate to<br/>
the shoes issue.  They were constantly on my kids<br/>
to wear shoes, so much so, that they would lecture<br/>
Laura behind my back about the importance of shoes<br/>
and wearing clothes.  They would say, &quot;You are a <br/>
young lady, young ladies wear CLOTHES!!&quot;  Etc,,,<br/>
I had many battles with them about childrearing<br/>
issues.  (note: they don&#39;t like me much at all as<br/>
I refuse to be the submissive DIL that they expect<br/>
from Korean women).  Anyway, I told all my in-laws<br/>
that I DON&#39;T CARE if my kids don&#39;t like shoes, that<br/>
I don&#39;t like them either and to make my point, I <br/>
started going barefoot WAY more than usual outside<br/>
so when they started in on my daughter about how<br/>
she should be wearing shoes and then look at me<br/>
for reinforcement, I would say, &quot;Why does she need<br/>
shoes?  I&#39;m not wearing any.&quot;  Then I would smile<br/>
sweetly and they would grump and go away.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sooooo glad to be out of there finally as it <br/>
was very hard living with them (lots of cultural<br/>
clashes), but at the same time, I will be forever <br/>
grateful they allowed us to be there for those <br/>
2 1/2 years.  It allowed us to get out of debt<br/>
while letting me remain a full time SAHM.<br/>

around the house sometimes....so I guess we are partly<br/>

am the only girl, I get to be a walking gender<br/>
differences instructor and also have to explain about<br/>
personal space and asking permissing before touching<br/>
other people and what parts of the body are private. <br/>
They are getting the idea when it comes to me, but<br/>
they don&#39;t get it yet when it comes to themselves and<br/>
still tell people in public places (usually pretty<br/>
young women)  &quot;I have a boy peepee!&quot;  At least they<br/>
don&#39;t then SHOW these people the aforementioned<br/>
peepee....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-289545517">Hookworm larvae (ground itch) are from animal feces<br/>
(cat mostly) that is infected.  Not so common on<br/>
sidewalks or concrete.  But tuberculosis is endemic in<br/>
Asia. And getting worse, here. Gobbing (spitting)is a<br/>
common practice in some areas (to get rid of &quot;bad<br/>
throat devils&quot;). Urinating in public is also common in<br/>
Asia so that all sort of things can be contracted on<br/>
or through skin, from hepatitis (endemic in Asia) to<br/>
weird fungi.  Shoes, and not touching anything, are<br/>
necessary for personal hygiene in some areas....such<br/>
as hospitals (everywhere).<br/>
<br/>
In Asia the yucky shoes are left in an entrance hall<br/>
and indoor &quot;slippers&quot; are donned.  Guest were the<br/>
guest &quot;slippers&quot;.  I couldn&#39;t bear to do this in<br/>
Japan....lots of people had fungi or various sorts, so<br/>
I carried my own indoor shoes (thick socks), and the<br/>
boys, with me in a bag. What a bother.  It was good to<br/>
get back home where common people don&#39;t pee all over<br/>
everything, and spitting is rude. <br/>
<br/>
In FL sandspurs, prickly pear, and other prickly stuff<br/>
as well as biting critters makes shoes desirable in<br/>
rural areas. Hot sidewalks, tar, GLASS, bits of wire<br/>
and other trash make shoes desirable in urban areas.<br/>
Glass is even a problem at the beaches. <br/>
<br/>
But when I was a child I met a friend of my<br/>
mother&#39;s...an old Cracker who never wore shoes. <br/>
Sandspurs didn&#39;t stick in his feet, snakes couldn&#39;t<br/>
bite through the thick tanned leather he had for skin.<br/>
 This old man wore skins and a coon-skin hat.  He made<br/>
coon-skin hats for my brothers and me, too. he did<br/>
chew and spit, but didn&#39;t care if the slimy stuff<br/>
oozed up between his toes.<br/>
<br/>
Your neighbor can&#39;t cook out toxins.  Veggies have to<br/>
be cleaned everywhere, anyway.  Regardless of<br/>
parasites....clean sand has an unpleasant texture, and<br/>
insects are an unpleasant surprise, too. Of course<br/>
grasshoppers and such are eaten (with relish) in lots<br/>
of places, too.  To me, a fried grasshopper shop<br/>
stinks up the whole street. <br/>

were talking about that a bit the other day, when I came across the pretty <br/>
little matchbox he had from there.  He remembers being really sick for about <br/>
a week.  He was nearly dying for about a month.  (Maybe it&#39;s a little like I <br/>
remember being in hard labor for eight hours or so, when it was 36 hours.  A <br/>
kindness of memory.)<br/>
