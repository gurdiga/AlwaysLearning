<div id="ygrps-yiv-803967413">I want to go back to what my question was, it seems the conversation <br/>
is taking a different route then what I am needing information <br/>
regarding.  <br/>
<br/>
As for questions,Â…the families involved are wonderful RUing families <br/>
and the children have lots of support and great relationships with <br/>
their families.  My question is not in regards to the particular <br/>
situation or children involved.  My question is about my feelings as <br/>
a RUing parent and Sorscha that arose from the situation.  In the <br/>
particular situation, the parents openly discussed it and have moved <br/>
on.  The situation that the families are absolutely fine with has <br/>
sparked questions for me and my relationship with Sorscha.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is my question:<br/>
If a non-sexual 9-year-old Sorscha were in a situation with a child <br/>
who was 13 or 14 who was sexual (again, the sexual is not a concern <br/>
of mine, it is the difference in the age range and then being sexual) <br/>
should as a RUing parent I be concerned / upset, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
If I truly trust Sorscha to make decisions for her self then should I <br/>
be okay if she were to make a decision to kiss this older child?  I <br/>
am feeling like I would have a problem with it and I am truly trying <br/>
to figure out if my feelings are appropriate.  My first reaction <br/>
would be to feel like Sorscha was being taken advantage of, however, <br/>
I am feeling like by feeling that way that I am possibly placing <br/>
my `junk&#39; onto the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope I am making sense.  The sexuality part is not my concern it is <br/>
the age.  If Sorscha were a sexual person and in a situation with <br/>
another child around her age I would not be feeling this way.  It is <br/>
the difference of years and experience and how this plays a part in <br/>
our Radical Unschooling lifestyle.  <br/>

<br/>
Well your &quot;junk&quot; (your experiences and your feelings) ARE part of her  <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The sexuality part is not my concern it is<br/>
the age. If Sorscha were a sexual person and in a situation with<br/>
another child around her age I would not be feeling this way. It is<br/>
the difference of years and experience and how this plays a part in<br/>
our Radical Unschooling lifestyle. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Well that seems unfair.  If she were likely to initiate sexual  <br/>
behaviors with another child, would it really matter to you if that  <br/>
child were younger, her age or older?  If it&#39;s inappropriate, it&#39;s  <br/>
inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago in an incident my children don&#39;t remember, a six year  <br/>
old boy did something inappropriate.  It involved touch and language,  <br/>
and I could have thrown a gigantic fit but I didn&#39;t.  And the other  <br/>
family offered to pay for counselling, but that wasn&#39;t even the  <br/>
point.  They needed themSELVES in counselling.  The mother said, when  <br/>
we discussed it very calmly for a long time, that she was sorry  <br/>
because he was five years older than the girl, that if it had been  <br/>
[named a six year old girl who was also in our playgroup] it would&#39;ve  <br/>
been different, but...<br/>
<br/>
It would NOT have been different.<br/>
<br/>
Little boys shouldn&#39;t sticking ANY parts of themselves (finger or  <br/>
anything else) inside any parts of little girls, , whether those  <br/>
girls are younger, same aged or older.<br/>
<br/>
Little girls shouldn&#39;t be inviting  that play, either.<br/>
<br/>
So if the only question is age, I don&#39;t think that should matter.<br/>
<br/>
After both kids are in or through puberty, they should have enough  <br/>
clues to know what the real dangers are, and parents can&#39;t protect  <br/>
them from everything forever (nor should they even want to).  Once  <br/>
they&#39;re out on their own away from adults, they&#39;ll have the tools  <br/>
their parents have helped them develop and whatever else they&#39;ve  <br/>
gleaned from other sources.<br/>
<br/>
The development of the tools should start early, I think.  Knowledge  <br/>
is power.  Too much knowledge can be abusive.  Telling children  <br/>
EVERYTHING robs them of some of the peace of childhood.  Telling them  <br/>
nothing is also wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Balance and compassion and mindfulness are the only way to figure it  <br/>
out for the particular child. Watch your child, listen to your child,  <br/>
don&#39;t be too paranoid or too naive either one.<br/>

<br/>
Well put, but I am very careful to keep my &#39;junk&#39; out of her life and <br/>
that is why I am asking this question here. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Well that seems unfair.  If she were likely to initiate sexual <br/>
behaviors with another child, would it really matter to you if that <br/>
child were younger, her age or older?  If it&#39;s inappropriate, it&#39;s <br/>
inappropriate.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If two teens around the same age are sexual and decide to explore...I <br/>
do not have a problem with that or see it as inappropriate. They are <br/>
equals, equal sexuality, equal age, etc.  There might be some <br/>
inequalities but they are mostly equal.  What I am asking is if my <br/>
feelings of difference in age and experience are valid.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Little boys shouldn&#39;t sticking ANY parts of themselves (finger or <br/>
anything else) inside any parts of little girls, , whether those  <br/>
girls are younger, same aged or older. Little girls shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
inviting  that play, either. So if the only question is age, I don&#39;t <br/>
think that should matter.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Straight talk that I appreciate.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;After both kids are in or through puberty, they should have enough <br/>
clues to know what the real dangers are, and parents can&#39;t protect  <br/>
them from everything forever (nor should they even want to).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES, that is why Sorscha and I talk a lot.  That is why I want to get <br/>
my feelings straight.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Once  they&#39;re out on their own away from adults, they&#39;ll have the <br/>
tools their parents have helped them develop and whatever else <br/>
they&#39;ve gleaned from other sources.  The development of the tools <br/>
should start early, I think.  Knowledge is power.  Too much knowledge <br/>
can be abusive.  Telling children  EVERYTHING robs them of some of <br/>
the peace of childhood.  Telling them  nothing is also wrong. Balance <br/>
and compassion and mindfulness are the only way to figure it  out for <br/>
the particular child. Watch your child, listen to your child,  don&#39;t <br/>
be too paranoid or too naive either one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I like that.  I am finding that Sorscha&#39;s conversation with me <br/>
about a week ago about not wanting me to kiss her without her <br/>
permission sparked a wonderful conversation about her personal <br/>
rights, her body, and her choices.  I think we are on the right track <br/>
in our communication.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Much as I don&#39;t necessarily like to use words like developmental and<br/>
average, four years is quite a big gap that can make for substantial<br/>
differences in experience (including knowledge and awareness of self<br/>
and others and capabilities in all sorts of ways) throughout<br/>
childhood, through all the years of growth and development. Which is<br/>
why I took a questioning approach to the hypothetical, because in some<br/>
ways my level of discomfort might depend on the children involved and<br/>
what they knew and recognised about themselves and each other. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I truly trust Sorscha to make decisions for her self then should<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the truth and dare situation, or just playing, there&#39;s a big<br/>
difference between a more platonic kind of lip-smacking kiss and what<br/>
we here downunder sometimes call pashing, where kissing gets to be<br/>
about tongues, maybe, and arousal and can carry people of all ages<br/>
into deeper water - though chances are the average 9-10yr wont be<br/>
*there* yet and neither should an older child be going there with one<br/>
so much younger, same as a 7yr old who can swim probably shouldn&#39;t<br/>
assume a 3yr can swim and push or even just take them in the deep end<br/>
of a swimming pool. That would be beyond disrespectful, to silly,<br/>
potentially frightening and dangerous, I think. Which is, again, where<br/>
I want to know that each child has some awareness of what might be the<br/>
other child&#39;s experience. And I mean child and children generally<br/>
there, not only your child and other specific children your own<br/>
particular child knows. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything junky about knowing your child, being<br/>
aware of where they&#39;re at, as you clearly are and taking the broader<br/>
culture into consideration, including your own experience within that<br/>
context. To be quite direct, I do think your feelings are appropriate,<br/>
they&#39;re valid not only because you felt them but for reasons that<br/>
apply to human development, even without cultural influences. 9-10 yr<br/>
old bodies and minds aren&#39;t ready for reproduction, which is one of<br/>
the places sexual activity goes, nor, I suggest, is the average 13-14<br/>
yr old ready for all the feelings and consequences that can result<br/>
from sexual activity, particularly within the culture, though these<br/>
things can and do happen to many young people, even though they might<br/>
be avoided with good info., awareness... education. And maybe because<br/>
of what you&#39;ve learned through RUing you&#39;re exploring those feelings<br/>
and thoughts rather than reacting, which is all good.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than imagining Sorscha being taken advantage of, perhaps there<br/>
are some other words that might work better... Disrespected, maybe.<br/>
I&#39;m deliberately not leaping to a more imflammatory word like<br/>
violated, because that has not happened, and may not be the case, even<br/>
in the hypothetical. You&#39;re concerned, and appropriately so, that<br/>
Sorscha might be disrespected, same as you might feel if someone who<br/>
was into calculus right now decided she needed to do calculus with<br/>
them, right now, even though she was neither that interested nor ready. <br/>
<br/>
Is any of that more helpful, odd analogies and all? I kind of hope in<br/>
using far less charged analogies, to take some of the repressiveness<br/>
and fear around sex as a topic away from it. Not that I think you&#39;re<br/>
being repressive and fearful, Crystal. I get that you&#39;ve been doing<br/>
what you could to make that clear. <br/>
<br/>
There are, of course, legalities which I haven&#39;t touched because I<br/>
don&#39;t feel they&#39;re relevant to the feelings and thoughts we have<br/>
around sex and burgeoning, or not, sexuality and young people in this<br/>
conversation. <br/>

<br/>
Unless there&#39;s some immediate question relating to a slightly older<br/>
boy who is angling to spend time alone with your daughter, then I<br/>
suggest stepping back and shaking it off a bit. There&#39;s the potential<br/>
for you to start sounding like one of those &quot;so, heroin&#39;s okay with<br/>
you then?!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that doesn&#39;t feel like a slap in the face. If it does, deep<br/>
breathing would probably be useful right now. Or, harder for me to<br/>
say, I wonder if you do have some &#39;junk&#39; that&#39;s making it hard for you<br/>
to get clear, that&#39;s causing you to push at this a bit... if it&#39;s more<br/>
about you than your daughter. Please know I say that with the warmest<br/>
heart, that you needn&#39;t reply with specificity, and that if you do I<br/>
hope you wont yell at me...<br/>
