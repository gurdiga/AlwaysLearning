<div id="ygrps-yiv-874213461">There&#39;s more.  My husband asked at the local furniture store when their<br/>
shipment of new stuff comes in.  He made arrangements for Dylan to be<br/>
there and they watched and helped assemble some of the pieces.  There<br/>
were bookshelves and bunk beds and coffee tables.  They had a good time. <br/>
<br/>
We also watched while a house was lifted off it&#39;s foundation in<br/>
preparation to be moved.  If you hang around with a cooler full of soda,<br/>
you&#39;d be surprised at how many of the crew will come over and talk to you<br/>
about what&#39;s going on.  <br/>
<br/>
We butted in on the city crew when they were cutting down dead cottonwood<br/>
trees two weeks ago on our street.   Dylan got to climb on the front end<br/>
loader.  They wouldn&#39;t let him be on it when it was running, but when<br/>
they shut down, he got to check out the dump truck, too.  <br/>
<br/>
The ranchers Arga supply gets a load of corn every other day and we can<br/>
go watch it be unloaded from the trains any time we like.  They&#39;ll take<br/>
kids around on tours if they&#39;re not busy and this year one of the guys<br/>
called Dylan when the baby ducks and chicks were hatching so we got to<br/>
watch that. <br/>
<br/>
We are lucky in this way to be in a small town because not too many<br/>
people here think about or worry about insurance liability.   I still<br/>
think it&#39;s possible in other places, if you just go and ask, on the spot,<br/>
not giving them time to think of the other stuff.  It&#39;s more fun that way<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
There are folks with rock shops and jewelry making businesses that love<br/>
to talk to kids.<br/>
<br/>
There are usually people in any town who have small engine repair shops<br/>
or small appliance repair shops, sometimes in their home or garage and<br/>
they are usually not so busy that they can&#39;t stop and talk.  Dig out some<br/>
old broken radio and go.  Ask if your kids can watch them take it apart. <br/>
 Or just let the kids have it and do whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan has taken apart all kinds of things. ( some things we didn&#39;t<br/>
actually want him to!  )  One homeshooling boy here learned about<br/>
computers this way, collecting old dead ones from people he knew and<br/>
dissecting them.  <br/>
<br/>
We were looking for a piece of brass to use as a kick plate on an old<br/>
door.  No one had brass that size but the adventure of checking out all<br/>
the recycling places and metal working shops was wonderful.   We finally<br/>
thought about a trophy shop and found a piece just the right size.  We<br/>
also got to watch while they cut different pieces of brass and while<br/>
things were being engraved and the guy gave Dylan an old book about how<br/>
trophy&#39;s are made, and some little scraps of copper and brass and some<br/>
blocks of wood.  I don&#39;t know what he&#39;ll do with them but I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll<br/>
think of something.  <br/>
