I am, a little. Not because *I* would look bad, but because unschooling<br/>
would. It&#39;s hard enough to deal with the, &quot;but what about math!&quot; parts<br/>
already, without having someone who just can&#39;t get it tell everyone, &quot;we<br/>
tried unschooling for two years and the children never learned any math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, maybe that&#39;s cowardly of me. Maybe we should just tell everyone to<br/>
bring it on, with the understanding that sometimes it&#39;ll work and sometimes<br/>
it won&#39;t and there are going to be people running around claiming to be<br/>
unschoolers who just aren&#39;t even close.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s happening anyway. :P<br/>
