<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039659872">Oh I agree with all of that.  What bothers me is when people tell me or<br/>
Lexie that Lexie is too young to do something simply because she is not<br/>
8 or 10 or 13.  Example--serving food at a Thanksgiving dinner for<br/>
homeless families.  This is something Lexie wanted to do.  I had the<br/>
idea that she could help hand out cups of juice, or put rolls on<br/>
people&#39;s plates, etc.  But no, she is not old enough to do this, she<br/>
must be 13.  Today we went to a place where the serve meals to homeless,<br/>
etc. but also one day a year they give out presents to kids.  They have<br/>
a line (and I do mean a line, last year they gave out over 800 gifts,<br/>
but this year they were expecting twice that many--there were a lot of<br/>
kids!) and they have an &quot;escort&quot; take the child (no adults, parents<br/>
meet their chidlren at the exit, the whole process takes about 5<br/>
minutes, but if there were toddlers or babies that didn&#39;t want to leave<br/>
mom, that was ok, mom could come), pick up a stuffed animal, a video<br/>
tape, and a wrapped present.  The escort was required to find out the<br/>
child&#39;s name and age, and then tell a &quot;runner&quot; what type of wrapped<br/>
present to get.  The escort would then take the child to santa, who<br/>
would give the wrapped present to the child and &quot;Mrs Claus&quot; would give<br/>
the child a candy cane or other candy.   The child and escort woudl then<br/>
precede to the exit where someone would stamp their hand (so they<br/>
couldn&#39;t return) and the mother (or father, grandfather, etc.) would<br/>
pick up the child.  Anyway... Lexie was told she was too young to be an<br/>
escort and that I would have to go with her.  This is what she was told<br/>
on the phone she woudl do (and I told them her age on the phone) so she<br/>
was disappointed but told me privately she was going to do such a good<br/>
job they would see how well she coudl do it without help.  So she did.<br/>
She learned how to ask in Spanish what the child&#39;s age was (she already<br/>
knew how to say &quot;what is your name?&quot; I just followed her and her child<br/>
through the line as she escorted about 6 children.  Then she wanted to<br/>
try to be a runner, so she did that for a good half an hour, all by<br/>
herself.  She was very cute, remembering the escort and child, so she&#39;d<br/>
give her gift to the correct team, and running quick, and then waiting<br/>
in line patiently behind the other runners, all adults and teens.  After<br/>
a bit of that, she wanted to be an escort again.  I set Lexie up to work<br/>
with a teen but after a few times around, I noticed she was going by<br/>
herself.  I watched her in the line, I just wasn&#39;t following her any<br/>
more, and she did fine.  I asked the teen and she said &quot;she does need me<br/>
and they noticed that!&quot;  I watched Lexie very carefully, there were a<br/>
lot of people there, but she had already made friends with all the other<br/>
volunteers and she was pretty much in my sight or close to it 100% of<br/>
the time, and she did so good, and was so happy and pleased with herself<br/>
for being able to do this herself.  A few of the volunteers in charge<br/>
came up to me and told me how wonderful she was, and how capable she<br/>
was, how sure of herself, and confident, etc. The person that said she<br/>
couldn&#39;t do it by herself admitted, sorta, that Lexie could be an<br/>
escort.  The only snag in it was until all the volunteers got used to<br/>
the fact that she was HELPING,they kept trying to give her gifts,<br/>
including santa!  Anyway, this is the long way of saying that in this<br/>
case, in MOST cases, people need to trust the parents to know their<br/>
child&#39;s abilities.  Of course, I know most parents aren&#39;t like we are,<br/>
and most kids aren&#39;t like Lexie, but you know, I often think that they<br/>
could be.  I think so many kids don&#39;t meet their potental, ever, because<br/>
of low expectation by everyone involved--parents, teachers, society.<br/>
Lexie did what she did today (and it was more than the physical action,<br/>
she knew she wasn&#39;t going to get a present, she knew this was for the<br/>
other kids, even Janene, who went as well, never once asked for a<br/>
present.  We did talk about it before hand, and we also stopped and got<br/>
a treat on the way home, but my expectation was that my children could<br/>
deal with this, and behold--they did!  (ok, sometimes this doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen, but most of the time it does).)  I think it comes down to<br/>
this--trusting ourselves and trusting our children, to learn, to grow,<br/>
to be what they can be.  But sometimes, like the above, the world steps<br/>
in and tells us and our children that we are not trustworthy.<br/>
<br/>
Dar told a story a long long time ago about being in a bead store and<br/>
how her daughter was told she couldn&#39;t touch the beads, and how Dar and<br/>
her child left.  Her child was the customer and had a right, just as an<br/>
adult, to examine what she was going to purchase before she did so.  I<br/>
remember reading this story and thinking--I know her daughter, between<br/>
that child and myself, I&#39;d put the money on the child not spilling the<br/>
beads!  I&#39;m a clutz and tend to knock things down.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, ramble over.  I agree that it&#39;s nice to know that there are<br/>
children, who, with their parent&#39;s permission, are reading this list.<br/>
It may help us to think twice about what we say, or don&#39;t say, and how<br/>
can that be a bad thing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828305131">I have tried several times to volunteer with the children,  starting when<br/>
the oldest was 6.  We&#39;ve had that happen every time....that is, they don&#39;t<br/>
want children around - even with parents.  One agency &quot;allowed&quot; her to draw<br/>
a Christmas picture for the lobby of their Christmas store....I found it<br/>
demeaning of her.  Especially since the &#39;lobby&#39; was so cluttered and<br/>
overcrowded with bulletin board &quot;junk&#39;.  That agency recently developed a<br/>
policy saying volunteers must be at least**15** yrs old AND be supervised by<br/>
parents!  (Until when I wonder ?  21, 35, 45 ????)<br/>
    In my more self righteous unschooling moments I think it&#39;s because they<br/>
believe as schools do,  that children must be *managed* and that this<br/>
requires too much on their part.....a toatl lack of trust in children as<br/>
persons.<br/>

&gt;     In my more self righteous unschooling<br/>
&gt; moments I think it&#39;s because they<br/>
&gt; believe as schools do,  that children must<br/>
&gt; be *managed* and that this<br/>
&gt; requires too much on their part.....a toatl<br/>
&gt; lack of trust in children as<br/>

think that children must be managed,<br/>
controlled, etc.  We MUST tell them when to<br/>
eat, sleep, eliminate wastes, etc.  And not<br/>
only when to eat, but what, and how much, for<br/>
children must never be trusted to make their<br/>
own decisions.  No wonder our teens make<br/>
horrible decisions, they have never had the<br/>
opportunity to do so before this point.<br/>
<br/>
People who cannot accept the idea that<br/>
children (yes, even small children, toddlers)<br/>
can choose for themselves when and how much<br/>
they eat, and what, when they go to the<br/>
bathroom, when (and where) they sleep, when<br/>
they wean, etc. can never, in my opinion,<br/>
accept it that children can also choose when<br/>
and how and what they learn.<br/>
