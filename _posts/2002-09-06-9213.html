<div id="ygrps-yiv-392271581">I&#39;m giving just a bit more info on the exhibitionists in my house. I love them<br/>
to be comfy with their bodies. I get annoyed when the kids start interacting<br/>
with eachother and the exposed body parts. 2.5 knows only that 5.5 makes her<br/>
laugh. She thinks it fun to copy him, so they run around sticking bottoms up<br/>
in the air at eachother laughing hystically. I do ask that they  take private<br/>
matters to a private spot. I have yet to talk about masterbation. I do say<br/>
it&#39;s ok to explore your body, in your own space, like your room or bathroom. I<br/>
tell them to keep their privates private, which they get in public. It&#39;s at<br/>
home they go cookoo. I do try to make it a non issue, I just don&#39;t react well<br/>
when I walk into a room and 5.5 is sniffing 2.5, or 5.5 is pulling back his<br/>
forskin to show 2.5. Or 5.5 strutts down the hall with said body part out<br/>
chasing dd8. Like I said, it&#39;s the interaction of the two that gets to me.<br/>
Thanks to all you moms for sharing your boy stories. Anyone out ther dealt<br/>
with this particular issue?</div>
