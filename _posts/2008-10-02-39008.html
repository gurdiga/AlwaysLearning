Maybe you could write a letter explaining calmly that perhaps she  <br/>
should be aware of the phrase, because she might hear it again  <br/>
someday.  If she has a supervisor there, maybe copy the supervisor.   <br/>
If she has a native-English-speaking nurse or assistant you could  <br/>
appeal to, that might be another way to go.<br/>

meant.  She told me she never heard of such use of that word, and <br/>
that I was wrong to think it was okay.  Her receptionist was right <br/>
there, and I looked to her a few times to chime in, but she didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to think it was her place.  I&#39;m hoping that perhaps they <br/>
discussed it after my departure.  The recpetionist has kids ranging <br/>

<br/>
I think general usage of a word can blur from culture to culture.  And it<br/>
sounds like that may be the case with the doctor.  Freak out, according to<br/>
some, is the same as f*ck.  I don&#39;t use it so literally.  And Karl uses it<br/>
like I do, more loosely in the same vein that your son uses it.  In the<br/>
context of some cultures, what your doctor says makes sense.  In your own<br/>
life, it makes none.<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;fortunate?&quot;  Not offensive swear or cuss words but<br/>
within special religious context they can be controversial.  Most people<br/>
would know what I mean when I say that someone is fortunate and thank God<br/>
that so and so is ok.  Some Christians think you&#39;re forfeiting your<br/>
influence on nonChristians or revealing to Christians that you&#39;re not one if<br/>
you don&#39;t erase the word &quot;luck&quot; and &quot;fortune&quot; from your vocabulary.  My<br/>
interpretation is not the same as theirs.  I think the force behind my luck<br/>
is God.  Within the context of Christianity, what my folks are saying makes<br/>
sense.  In my personal faith, it makes none.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe she&#39;s familiar with &quot;freak&quot; as a noun, but not as a verb, and  <br/>
finds *that* offensive?  Or thinks of &quot;freak&quot; in the slang context of  <br/>
a sex addict (re. Rick James&#39;s song, &quot;Super Freak&quot;)?<br/>
<br/>
 From Wikipedia:<br/>
The term super freak (and the term freak from which it descended) are  <br/>
African American ghetto slang (see both Slang and Ebonics). Freak and  <br/>
super freak are both references to : a woman who enjoys sex; perhaps  <br/>
but not necessarily a woman who is promiscuous, is willing to  <br/>
experiment sexually or is hyper-sexualized. In common use either term  <br/>
can simply refer to a woman. The slang term get freaky (to act  <br/>
sexually) derives from the same root as well.<br/>
Given that the standard dictionary meaning of the word freak is a  <br/>
reference to a &quot;freak of nature&quot;, one could easily make a case that  <br/>
the use (and origin) of these slang terms indicating a basic belief  <br/>
that &#39;any woman who has a healthy sex life must be a freak of  <br/>
nature&#39; (or at least an oddity). This lies is in stark contrast to the  <br/>
well researched and contradictory realities of female sexuality and  <br/>
the fact that women possess a much larger capacity for sexual pleasure  <br/>
than men do. The slang term freak and its relatives say a great deal  <br/>
about the views of that segment of society in which they arose (in  <br/>
regards to preconceived ideas regarding female sexuality and socially  <br/>
appropriate female sex roles).<br/>
There is a very obvious link between this terminology (and it meaning)  <br/>
and the Madonna Whore complex in which all women must be virginal  <br/>
(sexually untouched) or are automatically unworthy of any respect (see  <br/>
also references to the veneration of virginity and the practice of  <br/>
&#39;cherry picking&#39; in western society). For an example of this in film,  <br/>
seeSaturday Night Fever in which a casual sexual conquest by the  <br/>
character of Tony (played by John Travolta) turns into male only  <br/>
gratification when he discovers that the woman he desires is not a  <br/>
virgin. The Madonna Whore complex is well documented in both  <br/>
psychology and Feminist literature. It lies at the very roots of the  <br/>
sexual morays of middle America and the mythology of the American  <br/>
Golden Age (common in conservative American politics). The pervasive  <br/>
and repressive nature of the Madonna Whore complex and the way in  <br/>
which it creates an unhealthy view of female sexuality were at the  <br/>
heart of crossover between the sexual revolution in America and the  <br/>
20th century womens rights movement in America.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847271348">Were you in the room?  Does he speak low/quietly??  What was the rest <br/>

out&quot; or something like that?<br/>
<br/>
As a teenager I used &quot;freaking&quot; or &quot;fricking&quot; in mixed company fairly <br/>
often, and I vaguely remember once being told that I might as well <br/>
say &quot;f**king&quot; because that&#39;s what it meant and it was just as <br/>
offensive, but that was by a rather high-strung older female, and the <br/>
sentence was something like &quot;what are we fricking doing here?&quot; rather <br/>
than using the phrase &quot;freaking out&quot; which is NOT a &quot;polite form&quot; of <br/>
&quot;f**king but has its own meaning.<br/>
<br/>
I would speak to her office manager (in person or on the phone, <br/>
rather than by letter, and today or tomorrow, while the incident is <br/>
well-remembered), and try to gently clarify by giving her the <br/>
situation and asking her to explain to the doctor that he said <br/>
&quot;freaking out&quot; and did she hear something different? etc.  I would <br/>
tread gently (unfortunately, perhaps) and kiss some a**es, as she <br/>
could call Child Services on you if she were angry/upset enough.<br/>

Perhaps you could print out some online definitions that support the  <br/>
non-drug-related use, and admit that you realized later that  <br/>
sometimes lately kids use &quot;freakin&#39;&quot; as a substitute word (euphemism)  <br/>
for a bad word, but that&#39;s fairly recent compared to the phrase  <br/>
&quot;freaked out&quot; which goes back to the late 60&#39;s or early 70&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to doctors having the business of advising on child development,  <br/>
they do, by law.  This has been discussed here before, so anyone  <br/>
who&#39;d never heard of it could search the archives for &quot;mandatory  <br/>

networks. They replace the extremely numerous f**ks in the dialogue with <br/>
&quot;freak&quot; - to the point that it&#39;s just ridiculous. &quot;I&#39;ll freak anything that <br/>
moves&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s concious censorship because of public policy, not real common <br/>
usage. I think often people are trying to avoid offending others by using <br/>
&quot;freak&quot; or &quot;fudge&quot;, so it&#39;s really a kind and thoughtful action.<br/>

Then a quick story about my son who was 5 at the time was playing <br/>
with his schooled cousin.  Finnegan was in the habit of throwing out <br/>
a &quot;What the Heck?!?&quot; every now and again just as something he said.  <br/>
His cousin told him that he shouldn&#39;t say that.  Finn asked why and <br/>
she explained that heck meant hell, and that hell was a bad word.  <br/>
Finn&#39;s reposone was &quot;I don&#39;t even know what hell is.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My point is they are only words and by forbiding them I think we give <br/>
them power they do not inherently have.<br/>
<br/>
I would even consider switching providers as it sounds like your <br/>
doctor is not on board with the choices you and your family have made <br/>
regarding schooling.   Anyway thanks for listening.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; I disagree with you about &quot;freak out,&quot; though. Saying something is<br/>

Nobody&#39;s &quot;going off&quot; about anything.  That&#39;s stronger than &quot;freaking  <br/>

Some of my grandfather&#39;s euphemism in Texas, mid-20th century were  <br/>
&quot;Shoot&quot; for &quot;shit&quot; but the common usage was &quot;Shoot fire.&quot;   And in  <br/>
his accent it sounded kinda like &quot;Sheeyoot far.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My granny would say &quot;Land o&#39;Goshen&quot; the way some people will say &quot;son  <br/>
of a bitch&quot;--not to call someone that, but just to say it when  <br/>
something is very frustrating.  My boyfriend from India was visiting  <br/>
my granny and papaw with me (these were my mom&#39;s parents, not even  <br/>
the religious side of the family, but the taboo ran deep), and said  <br/>
&quot;Why is your grandmother saying &quot;Atlantic Ocean&quot;?<br/>

When I was a kid if I said &quot;geez...&quot; my mom would get really angry  <br/>
because it&#39;s too much like &quot;Jesus.&quot;  I wasn&#39;t even thinking about  <br/>
Jesus when I said it.  I only saw my mom go to church twice in my  <br/>
life and she was a heck of an alcoholic and a bully, and there had  <br/>
been some retalliatory adultery before my parents had kids, but maybe  <br/>
she though MAYBE if nobody in her vicinity took the lord&#39;s name in  <br/>
vain, she&#39;d be overlooked.<br/>

said <br/>

I very much disagree with this.   It&#39;s &quot;supportive,&quot; but it&#39;s not  <br/>
productive.  It won&#39;t make situations better.<br/>
<br/>
Many people aren&#39;t happy-go-lucky.<br/>
<br/>
One important life skill among thousands is to know when and where to  <br/>
use what level of language.  Both Marty and Kirby have been in metro  <br/>
court for traffic violations.  Neither of them said &quot;Chuh&quot; or &quot;Dude&quot;  <br/>
to the judge.  There were others there who might not have gone that  <br/>
far, but whose clothing and posture were neither respectful nor  <br/>
humble.  My boys got off very easily, and some of those others didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Parents should help their children figure out that there are  <br/>
different ways to act and dress and eat and everything, depending on  <br/>
whether it&#39;s a wedding or a funeral.  You don&#39;t act the same way at  <br/>
your brothers 21st birthday as you do at your grandmother&#39;s 80th.<br/>
