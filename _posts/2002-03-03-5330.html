<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535658241">In case anyone&#39;s interested, it is absolutely impossible to break through <br/>
frozen Utah soil in February. At least it is in the mountains where I live. <br/>
We tried many different methods with no success. :-/ Trust me when I tell <br/>
you that it is cold here and has been for what seems like forever.<br/>
<br/>
So...our dear little Tiny was cremated last night in a peaceful funeral pyre <br/>
by the waterfall. We are all looking forward to seeing how his ashes have <br/>
nourished the bulbs and wildflowers.<br/>
<br/>
As part of her grieving process (apparently) Casey purchased a Teddy Bear <br/>
Hamster yesterday whom she has named Cookie. The King is dead, long live the <br/>
Queen. ;-)<br/>
