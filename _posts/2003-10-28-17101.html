I&#39;m on a generic state homeschooling list and every once in a while I throw<br/>
in my unschooling 2 cents.  :)  Or should I say Unschooling Sense.<br/>
<br/>
Last week we had someone asking about kids going back and forth between<br/>
school and home and wondered if anyone had gone through that.  Their<br/>
previous attempt at homeeducation hadn&#39;t flown.   I shared my story,  our<br/>
kids went back and forth a bit, and then suggested she check out different<br/>
methods of homeeducation.   Gave her some links--to unschooling.com and<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
That same day I got a couple off list e-mails asking me about unschooling<br/>
and also had 3 people join my unschooling list!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are days though that I do feel like its an uphill battle,  like when I<br/>
read posts(on the homeschooling list)  from people who are on my unschooling<br/>
list,  and they are doing their &#39;schooling&#39;.   Ugh!  That&#39;s why noone is<br/>
sharing with me what they&#39;re up to!<br/>
