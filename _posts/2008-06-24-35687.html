but if I did, the way I&#39;d handle it is with distance.  That person <br/>
would lose the privilege of our company.  I would not allow such a <br/>
damaging person, no matter who they are, any access to my child (or <br/>
to me, for that matter).  I would tell them why they aren&#39;t seeing us <br/>
anymore, and I would be absolutely rigid about the conditions under <br/>
which they were to see us again.  By my lights, nobody is worth that <br/>
kind of abuse for any reason.<br/>
<br/>
You have my sympathy.<br/>

Have you talked to her about this?  That&#39;s the first step.  Secondly, if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t &#39;hear&#39; it, then I&#39;d limit the time your child (and you) spend there.<br/>
<br/>
The age of your child is important, too.  If she is old enough to<br/>
understand, maybe make a joke about it on the way there and talk about the<br/>
happenings and how that can make anyone feel.<br/>
<br/>
My thought is, we come into contact with people who are not respectful all<br/>
the time.  It&#39;s life.  Figuring out how to deal with it and not take it<br/>
personally is key.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510506716">I guess I&#39;m confused somehow.  It has been suggested that we are supposed to<br/>
stay in a marriage where we are disrespected but are able to drop someone in<br/>
our personal family of origin without fully trying to make ourselves<br/>
available for conversation and boundary setting.  I find this disconcerting.<br/>
<br/>
I know in my personal life I have parents who are disrespectful to me and my<br/>
kids and I did have to separate ourselves from that relationship because it<br/>
is still too damaging to all.  Due to my past, I see this as more I need to<br/>
heal from and grow from...not avoid completely or sweep that under the rug.<br/>
It&#39;s still part of my &#39;baggage&#39; that I don&#39;t want to give to my kids.  This<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I have to subject them to abuse, either.  No abuse is ok.<br/>
<br/>
I have also lived through a marriage that was completely one sided (not<br/>
mine)...I ended up separating and that ended up with me being a widow (his<br/>
personal choice).  After a long time of conditioning a small child how to be<br/>
co-dependent.  I have since then helped that same sweet girl through some of<br/>
the trauma and many therapy sessions later ($$$$$) she is a very level<br/>
headed young adult about to start life on her own.  Now I have a partner<br/>
that respects me and loves me.  This meant that I did a lot of journeying to<br/>
get here.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what my main point is - there needs to be a safe place for our kids<br/>
to be emotionally and physically healthy.  There also needs to be<br/>
conversations with the adults in our lives to see if we can&#39;t find a way to<br/>
have a more healthy relationship.  If that isn&#39;t possible and all efforts<br/>
made, then yes, dump them.  It shouldn&#39;t matter whether they have a piece of<br/>
paper with your signature on it (marriage cert.) or a piece of paper with<br/>
their signature on it (birth cert.).<br/>
<br/>
Just further clarification of another point of view...<br/>

dropping in? Are you going to visit her? Does she live with you?**<br/>
<br/>
I feel &#39;obligated&#39; to go see my mother at least every 2 weeks or so. Her other <br/>
children have already abandoned her because of her mental and emotional abuse. <br/>
I have stood by her hoping she would &#39;see the light&#39; and stop acting like her <br/>
mother did, whom everyone hated. My mother has never stepped foot in my house. <br/>
She passes my house at least a couple of times a month and has never offered <br/>
to stop by. She lives about a 35 minute drive from me and my 8 yo daughter and <br/>
myself go to visit her. If we don&#39;t, then she thinks we&#39;re mad at her. If I <br/>
don&#39;t call her at least once a week she thinks I&#39;m mad at her too - even <br/>
though she very rarely finds the time to call me. Only when she needs <br/>
something. I know, it doesn&#39;t sound like a very healthy relationship, but she <br/>
IS my mother! I don&#39;t want my daughter hurt anymore by my mother&#39;s mouth <br/>
though, so I&#39;ve been thinking about writing her a letter and explaining how I <br/>
feel to her but I don&#39;t want her to get angry. I just want her to understand <br/>
that she&#39;s turned into HER mother, who was evil.  Any suggestions on what to <br/>
put in this letter?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300823100">It&#39;s not only the homeschooling that she insults her with. She also criticises <br/>
her weight, and she tends to stutter when she&#39;s upset so my mother criticises <br/>
that too. She constantly calls her a &quot;Titty Baby&quot; because my daughter doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to leave my side around her (for good reason, eh?) and doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
spend the night with her like her other granddaughter does (I wonder why???) <br/>
My sister-in-law also has a problem with the way she talks around her <br/>
daughter, and we&#39;ve talked about getting together and talking to Mom about her <br/>
abuse, but we don&#39;t really think it will do any good. As long as my sister-in-<br/>

join together and talk to her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825419061">Yes. She does it at least once per visit. I try telling her that my SIL and I <br/>
have different lifestyles. My SIL works two jobs to put her kids in Private <br/>
School and rarely spends any time with them. I, on the other hand, homeschool <br/>
mine and spend ALL my time with her. So my mother compares my daughter to my <br/>
niece. I keep trying to point out to her that my daughter knows sign language, <br/>
and other things that my niece isn&#39;t being taught, but that makes no <br/>
difference to her. My daughter even underwent an SAT this past year and is on <br/>
a 7th grade reading and vocabulary level and my Mom things the test was rigged <br/>
some way! BTW, my daughter is 8 years old.<br/>

<br/>
If you feel some emotional guilt and want to call her then go ahead. <br/>
But don&#39;t let that guilt continue to allow you to visit your mother<br/>
face to face with your daughter there.  You have an obligation to<br/>
protect your daughter before you have an obligation to visit a grown<br/>
woman, even if that is your mother.   <br/>
<br/>
If you feel like you need to explain anything to your mom, just tell<br/>
her you won&#39;t subject your daughter to that kind of emotional abuse. <br/>
You really don&#39;t need to say anything else.  If your sister in law<br/>
wants to let her daughter be with an abuser that&#39;s her choice.  But<br/>
you don&#39;t need her approval to protect your daughter either!<br/>
<br/>
Or if you both (you and your SIL) feel the same way and want to visit<br/>
your mom.  Than one of you should stay with the girls while the other<br/>
one goes to visit.  Take turns, then you&#39;ll only have to see your mom<br/>
once a month and your daughter won&#39;t have to be called names.:)<br/>

If you and your sister want to write a joint letter, maybe you could  <br/>
make a list of the things she&#39;s said that were horrible and insulting  <br/>

and heard (even though they shouldn&#39;t have been), and repeating them  <br/>
could cause her not to see the girls anymore at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say you&#39;re sorry that she probably heard such things  <br/>
when she was growing up, but that abuse needs to stop, not be passed on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, as long as your mother *chooses* to be abusive, she&#39;s not going  <br/>
to get any better.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you&#39;re asking for a way to get her to stop doing abusing.  <br/>
You can&#39;t. To change, a person needs to choose to be different. You  <br/>
can&#39;t make her choose. (Though you can provide reasons why changing  <br/>
is better than not changing.)<br/>
<br/>
I suspect also you intend to model for your daughter how to put up  <br/>
with obligations. But what you&#39;re *really* modeling is how to put up  <br/>
with abuse out of a sense of duty. You&#39;re modeling that she should  <br/>
allow other&#39;s emotions to manipulate her into doing what she feels is  <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
So if your daughter ends up in an abusive marriage, it will be okay  <br/>
if she puts up with it? It&#39;s what you&#39;re modeling for her.<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to apologize to your daughter. Tell her you thought  <br/>
you were being a good daughter but you were being a really bad mommy.  <br/>
That your first obligation is to keep her safe even if it means  <br/>
keeping her safe from your own mom.<br/>
<br/>
You have an opportunity to show your daughter how to stand firm in  <br/>
her beliefs. Set boundaries with your mother. Tell your mother calmly  <br/>
that as long as she continues the abuse, she won&#39;t see her  <br/>
granddaughter. (And won&#39;t see you if you&#39;re strong enough to go that  <br/>
far.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t hold in your mind that you&#39;re trying to make your mother  <br/>
change. You&#39;re allowing her to choose. Your visit is not a reward for  <br/>
changing. Your not visiting is not a punishment for not changing.<br/>
<br/>
If she agrees to change and you do visit (with or without your  <br/>
daughter) and she starts in on the abuse, leave.<br/>
<br/>
Again, not punishment. It&#39;s a boundary. You&#39;re saying &quot;If you cross  <br/>
this boundary I need to leave to protect myself and my daughter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If we don&#39;t, then she thinks we&#39;re mad at her. If I<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is called emotional manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
People&#39;s reactions are good feedback to help us interact better.  <br/>
People can also *use* reactions to manipulate someone&#39;s behavior.  <br/>
You&#39;re not obligated to appease emotions she&#39;s using to manipulate  <br/>
you with.<br/>

At some point in her life she learned she could get people to do what  <br/>
she wanted by making them feel guilty. But, really, she can&#39;t make  <br/>
you feel guilty. You allow yourself to feel guilty and allow her to  <br/>
manipulate you into doing what she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to give your daughter the &quot;gift&quot; of feeling powerless to  <br/>
others?<br/>
<br/>
Model for her a *healthy* respect for others and for herself. Model  <br/>
for her *healthy* relationships with others *and with herself*.<br/>

the discussion sounded like &quot;do whatever the husband wants because  <br/>
without a husband unschooling isn&#39;t possible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are *loads* of choices between good communication and do what  <br/>
he wants. (Kelly Lovejoy can&#39;t say enough good things about  <br/>
Retrouvaille ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.retrouvaille.org/)">http://www.retrouvaille.org/)</a> *But* -- barring abuse  <br/>
-- it&#39;s unrealistic to believe that dumping a difficult husband with  <br/>
will make life easier. If he can&#39;t get unschooling while in a  <br/>
marriage, it&#39;s highly unlikely he&#39;ll allow it after divorce! While  <br/>
amicable divorces are possible, a woman should enter into a divorce  <br/>
assuming she&#39;ll take on a whole new set of problems. A disagreeable  <br/>
husband is highly unlikely to respond to divorce with &quot;I&#39;m out of  <br/>
here. Do whatever you want with the kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not something to fear, but something to look at realistically.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion veered off into appeasing the husband&#39;s fears because  <br/>
the original poster sounded as though she was giving her husband  <br/>
information about unschooling but it really didn&#39;t address his fears.  <br/>
And after a while the fears came screaming out in the form of:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, he told me last night that he firmly doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think we can continue this way, and something<br/>
&gt; different needs to be done. He just doesn&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; that people can learn skills like reading, writing,<br/>
&gt; math without daily structured practice. He thinks we<br/>
&gt; are doing our kids a real disservice, and he insists<br/>
&gt; that either I start incorporating that kind of thing,<br/>
&gt; or he will enroll our oldest in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s afraid. He&#39;s not going to get unafraid by a wife getting angry  <br/>
or defensive or saying &quot;Suck it up!&quot; (Well, it worked for Ren, ;-)  <br/>
but it&#39;s going to depend hugely on personalities! But as a general  <br/>
rule, it will just devolve into a power struggle.)<br/>
<br/>
But the wife shouldn&#39;t cringe and bow down to his fears.<br/>
<br/>
There are other choices! Once choice can be to find ways for the days  <br/>
to provide more feedback that learning is taking place until he grows  <br/>
more comfortable with it. Baby steps.<br/>
<br/>
Another can be discussion to get to the heart of his fears and take  <br/>
them seriously. Again, that doesn&#39;t mean responding as though his  <br/>
fears were truth, but do take them seriously and find ways to help  <br/>
him get past them.<br/>

How does your mother respond to your hubby - does she lay off a bit?   When my dad was not so nice (he was dying and could be a bit strong at times - but never insulted Zac - just that we&#39;d try to do fun stuff with him and all he could do was complain because we did not take him home to live at our house or complain and bad mouth his other children) He was nicer to Ed - responded better to Ed - if Ed said &quot;hush let&#39;s enjoy our time together&quot; ;)  Once Zac was trying to play some music on a lap harp for my dad - he had practiced a lot beforehand - picked out songs he thought my dad would enjoy, etc.  My dad basically would not listen so we told him to hush - that his grandson was doing something special for him, had practiced for him, put a lot of effort into it, etc.  When I tried to say something I got nasty feedback but then Ed spoke up and my dad got quiet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174955352">There also needs to be conversations with the adults in our lives to <br/>
see if we can&#39;t find a way to have a more healthy relationship. If <br/>
that isn&#39;t possible and all efforts made, then yes, dump them. It <br/>
shouldn&#39;t matter whether they have a piece of paper with your <br/>
signature on it (marriage cert.) or a piece of paper with their <br/>
signature on it (birth cert.).<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
I&#39;ve broken off with most of my childhood family -- many I&#39;ve just <br/>
lost touch with, but don&#39;t feel any need to re-connect with, others <br/>
are just toxic (my Mom and her sisters for example) and I&#39;m happy to <br/>
be rid of. <br/>
<br/>
The difference for me is that I can cut off grandparents with no risk <br/>
to our lifestyle at home. My parents have no legal right to tell me <br/>
how to raise or educate our kids.  An ex-spouse, presumably the other <br/>
parent to any children involved, has the legal right to insist the <br/>
kids be sent to school, raised in a particular way and is guaranteed <br/>
unsupervised access to his/her own children.  That&#39;s quite a big risk <br/>
to kids&#39; well-being, IMO.  <br/>
<br/>
I left my first husband after years of abuse and moved 2,000 miles <br/>
away -- specifically to cut off my ex from our infant son.  When I <br/>
went to court to get legal custody, I knew there was every risk I&#39;d <br/>
have to share visitation with my ex, but I needed to establish <br/>
custody before I could get a divorce.  Thankfully -- and lucky for <br/>
us -- my ex had no interest in seeing our son at that time, so I was <br/>
granted full custody.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve long believed and said that it would have been better if my <br/>
parents had divorced sooner, because their marriage was always a <br/>
mess.  Recently, I&#39;ve come to see that I can&#39;t really know that -- my <br/>
sibs who were still home wish Mom had waited a few more years to <br/>
leave, because even tho we all admit our parents should never have <br/>
married, the divorce only made things worse for them.  It was a bad <br/>
marriage, but would it have killed her to wait a few more years to <br/>
leave?  The divorce was much uglier than the marriage had ever been - <br/>
we kids heard things about our own parents that we never needed to <br/>
know.  Sadly, those tactics have continued on one side, even 25 yrs <br/>
later. <br/>
<br/>
I know of one divorce where unschooling survives still -- only 2 yrs <br/>
later, so who knows -- but that&#39;s something. I know of another family <br/>
who had been unschoolers of several years, the divorce was a mess and <br/>
last I heard the husband was denouncing unschooling and trying to <br/>
force the kids into school, or at least school-at-home.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve observed over the years is that in a divorce things <br/>
get ugly fast.  Even in a bad marriage, people behave themselves to <br/>
some extent - but once all hope is lost, all bets are off.  That <br/>
apsect of it is never good for kids. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582357977">Yes. She does it at least once per visit. I try telling her that my <br/>
SIL and I have different lifestyles. My SIL works two jobs to put her <br/>
kids in Private School and rarely spends any time with them. I, on <br/>
the other hand, homeschool mine and spend ALL my time with her. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
IMO, you are giving your mom way too much access to your own child.  <br/>
That woman is toxic.<br/>
<br/>
My own mother (or as dh and I now call her, &quot;the woman formerly known <br/>
as my Mom&quot;) had become increasingly toxic and verbally abusive to us <br/>
all in the last several months of 2006.  I had always had what I <br/>
considered a good relationship with her.  Looking back, I realize it <br/>
was not good.  She is controlling and very bitter, she has a very <br/>
skewed ideal of love, especially motherly love. She&#39;s completely <br/>
conditional in her love for her children.  I kept up my end of <br/>
things, without my kids along, for some time, going by alone to help <br/>
out with things she needed.  I stopped having her visit our home, <br/>
because she stopped any pretense at being kind to my kids.  Not just <br/>
my kids, she really doesn&#39;t like kids at all I suspect.  Xmas of <br/>
2006, she called to say she &#39;needed a break&#39; from her kids&#39; lives.  <br/>
We gave it to her.  This past Feb, we all received a 12-page missive <br/>
from her detailing the myriad ways in which we&#39;ve been &#39;her greatest <br/>
traumas&#39; and that we&#39;re failure as both parents and people -- I guess <br/>
it was designed to prompt us to run back to her and make amends and <br/>
become her idea of &#39;good responsible parents and people.&#39;  My sis and <br/>
I immediately wrote her off.  Sis didn&#39;t even reply -- I sent a <br/>
sincere, kind note (only because she lives in my town and isn&#39;t above <br/>
calling child services on me, so I figured I could be nice). Our <br/>
brother refused to read the letter and called her to make amends. <br/>
Yes, he&#39;s the crown price of the Kingdom of Denial. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My Dad is the one I never really liked as a kid. He&#39;s still not a <br/>
friend, but we do have a relationship.  He&#39;s a better grandfather <br/>
than he was a Dad.  In some ways, he&#39;s an object lesson for my kids --<br/>
 kinda of &#39;this is why we live such a different life.&#39;  My Mom could <br/>
be an object lesson I guess, but she&#39;s malignant where my Dad is <br/>
pretty benign, if strange.  He&#39;s easier to manage, and much more <br/>
respectful of my boundaries than she is.  <br/>
<br/>
My point in all this is that I spent many years trying to win my <br/>
Mom&#39;s approval, to convince her I was right and worthy and a good <br/>
mother, a good person; to find some way to be myself and still be <br/>
loved by her for who I am.  Yeah, not gonna happen.  It sounds to me <br/>
like that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re hoping that if you can just <br/>
explain why you do what you, show her how smart and wondeful your <br/>
daugher is, that she&#39;ll finally get you.  She seems equally <br/>
determined to show you that you&#39;re wrong, and in the process, she&#39;s <br/>
willing to harm your daughter to show you who&#39;s right.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a contest you can&#39;t win, because you&#39;re an honorable person who <br/>
wants to be loved and respected. She&#39;s a controller who will only be <br/>
happy once things are done her way.  And she doesn&#39;t care who gets <br/>
hurt.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a contest you don&#39;t need to win.  The time and energy you <br/>
put into your Mom would be much better spent with your daughter.  <br/>
Your daughter doesn&#39;t need to see you being a long-suffering martyr <br/>
to know you are a good person. <br/>

<br/>
I winced and took in my breath.  That&#39;s strong, and scary, and true.   <br/>
I flashed back to a few things my mom said and did, in crazed lash- <br/>
out mode.  And my mom wasn&#39;t at all bad about interfering with my  <br/>
life or my sister&#39;s as far as marriage and family went, because she  <br/>
knew we could easily do better than she did (and that either of us  <br/>

debt).<br/>
<br/>
-=-The time and energy you put into your Mom would be much better  <br/>

<br/>
Definitely.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes moms want all credit and no blame.  &quot;I gave you birth.&quot;   <br/>
Well... if it was all downhill from there, it&#39;s not a favor.<br/>
<br/>
In another context altogether, talking about how some people in the  <br/>
SCA want credit for every good thing they&#39;ve done without counting  <br/>
damage they might&#39;ve caused--they&#39;re surprised if anyone brings up  <br/>
something five or ten years old when they caused problems that had to  <br/>
be cleaned up by others.  But they&#39;re bringing up things fifteen and  <br/>
twenty years old to remind people how hard they&#39;ve worked.<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to liken it to a bank account where someone might only  <br/>
want to look at the deposits he made without consideration of all the  <br/>
withdrawals.  The friend I was communicating with said they have a  <br/>
saying to cover that where she lives:<br/>
<br/>
Service rendered vs. chaos engendered.<br/>
<br/>
Same with parents, neighbors, friends.  In any relationship, people  <br/>
need to make deposits (not in a bird-in-the-tree-above kind of way-- <br/>
that&#39;s DEFINITELY a debit, as human dyads go).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; feel to her but I don&#39;t want her to get angry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My initial reaction based on those things above, is that YOU need to get<br/>
healing and closure to that yucky co-dependent cycle.  You are<br/>
preforming exactly like someone who enables an abuser.  It seems you are<br/>
aware of the abuse and the games, but that you don&#39;t know how to put<br/>
down your cards and walk away.<br/>
<br/>
Just because someone is your mother or brother or grandpa doesn&#39;t make<br/>
you obligated at all.  If you were still a kid, it would suck and you&#39;d<br/>
feel helpless and powerless to get away, but the beauty of turning 18 is<br/>
that you can legally walk away from it.  It sounds like the rest of your<br/>
family has done so.  Are you on good terms with them?  Have any of them<br/>
moved on and started healthy lives?  If so, perhaps one of them would be<br/>
good to talk to.<br/>
<br/>
Writing a letter might be a good idea.  Write it and sit on it for a<br/>
week, then re-write it to make sure that there isn&#39;t anything mean and<br/>
hurtful said that is coming from the heat of the moment.  Don&#39;t worry<br/>
about wether or not she gets angry.  You have absolutely no control over<br/>
another&#39;s emotional response.  It is the other person&#39;s choice as to<br/>
wether or not they become angry.  Keep in mind that your intent is a<br/>
positive one, one of protecting your child, and preventing future ill<br/>
feelings for yourself, your intent shouldn&#39;t be one of preventing<br/>
someone else&#39;s anger.  It&#39;s been my experience that viewing the positive<br/>
choice and holding it close helps guide my actions in regards to<br/>
intercommunication in less than ideal circumstances.  It really does<br/>
help keep things positive and happy, wether or not the other person ever<br/>
turns around or not.</div>

<br/>
That sounds good (the second part,) but it&#39;s not true.  If you know  <br/>
something will crush a person&#39;s soul and you do it anyway, saying &quot;I  <br/>
have no control over another&#39;s emotional response&quot; is a lame patch on  <br/>
a gaping wound.  And apparent from years of conditioning, this mom  <br/>
has control over her daughter&#39;s emotional response.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the daughter goes full-on into recovery from co-dependency  <br/>
and whatever all elements of  bad parenting there might&#39;ve been, and  <br/>
if she comes to understand the idea that she can control her own  <br/>
emotional responses, that won&#39;t mean that she might not retain the  <br/>
ability to crush her mom like a bug by knowing what to say.<br/>

Just in case, I wanted to say, do NOT take her out to eat or anywhere <br/>
else if you are having this sort of problem. <br/>
<br/>
When my mildly senile grandfather was grieving my grandmother, he <br/>
sometimes felt strongly that I had ruined his life (by taking the car <br/>
keys away after he lost his license, etc.) and would really set into <br/>
me. I stopped eating out with him for a while so I wouldn&#39;t get stuck <br/>
somewhere being berated. I told my husband, who was really mad about <br/>
this, that he didn&#39;t have to come visiting with me any more. I also had <br/>
to turn around and walk back out of the house once when grandpa started <br/>
yelling at me when I was supposed to be driving him to a doctor&#39;s <br/>
appointment. It&#39;s so hard to know where to draw the line, especially in <br/>
a situation like mine with someone bereft who is literally losing his <br/>
mind. But like an OP said, my DH pointed out that grandpa never talked <br/>
to HIM like that, so I stopped just putting up with it, and that did <br/>
make a huge difference. He was nicer to me to start with, so I don&#39;t <br/>
mean to say you have the same situation, but I wish you luck. <br/>

Yes, we go to her, she won&#39;t come to us. We haven&#39;t been there in about two <br/>

don&#39;t go then she talks bad about us to the ones that do go! It&#39;s difficult <br/>

angry about it.  When my older daughter is confronted with mean<br/>
behavior, she chooses wether or not to let it affect her and wether or<br/>
not she will put up with it happening again.  I&#39;ve learned a lot from<br/>
her in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, name calling is thoughtless and mean.  Still, a person can<br/>
choose wether or not to let it affect them.   I don&#39;t  let others be<br/>
mean to my kids without saying anything in their defense, and if that<br/>
hurts the other person&#39;s feelings then too bad, they shouldn&#39;t be mean<br/>
to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I tend to be more blunt than not.  I&#39;m tactful but blunt about<br/>
how I feel.  I tend to attract others that are similarly blunt yet<br/>
honest and tactful.  I like honesty, and I&#39;d rather have others be<br/>
honest with me than be talking behind my back.  I have a hard time<br/>
reading people that tend to be overly sensitive.  My husband tends to be<br/>
more on the sensitive side and it really has caused me to temper my own<br/>
blunt honesty.<br/>
<br/>
I do know what you mean about knowingly causing someone else pain.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475894447">~~&quot;The best thing you could do for yourself is to<br/>
work through to a life without your mom.&quot;~~<br/>
<br/>
What about the Bible? I don&#39;t know what anyone&#39;s religion is on here, and <br/>
don&#39;t really want to get into that, but most people believe the Bible.<br/>
In Proverbs 23:22, Solomon exhorts his son to &quot;harken to your Father who begot <br/>
you and do not despise your mother when she is old.&quot; In the story of Job, we <br/>
find that Elihu the younger of Job&#39;s friends waited until the older men had <br/>
spoken to Job. He also treated his communication to Job with admiration and <br/>
respect, since Job was his elder. In Exodus 20:12 we find the commandment - to <br/>
honor your -father and mother, that your days may be long in the land which <br/>
the Lord your God gives you. In Mark 7:10-12, we find Jesus saying, &quot;He who <br/>
speaks evil of his father and mother, let him surely die.&quot; He goes on to say <br/>
that the Pharisees had made void the law of God by their disgraceful treatment <br/>
of the elderly.<br/>
  I know it doesn&#39;t say anywhere in there that we are to accept abuse. My <br/>
mother HATED her own mother, and for good reason. Yet, when she got old and <br/>
needed help my mother was there for her and took care of her for about 15 <br/>
years until she died this April. She did it out of duty, not out of love. She <br/>
hated doing it, but refused to put her in a nursing home. I never quite <br/>
understood that. I wouldn&#39;t take my mother into my own home with her being <br/>
abusive, but she did. Now she&#39;s turned into her own mother with her hateful <br/>
ways. I hope I never get like her. Maybe I can stop the cycle with me and my <br/>
daughters!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I lost a friend whose mother was hateful and abusive, and I&#39;m very familiar<br/>
&gt; with the vacillation I see here... the anger on the one hand and the undue<br/>
&gt; sympathy and feeling of duty toward the mother.  Somehow or other, get a<br/>
&gt; strong sense of yourself (which will be easier without *any* contact with<br/>
&gt; the venom you&#39;re getting).  The best thing you could do for yourself is to<br/>
&gt; work through to a life without your mom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could relate a little to what my friend was going through because I cut my<br/>
&gt; parents out for a while (more than a decade) due to religious differences so<br/>
&gt; bad that I felt stifled and anxious all the time.  Any contact with them in<br/>
&gt; those years would set me back very quickly.  After close to 15 years apart,<br/>
&gt; I had gained enough on my own feet that I was finally able to meet family<br/>
&gt; without reverting to old patterns of thought and behavior.  I&#39;m actually<br/>
&gt; pretty strong in my own beliefs now and don&#39;t feel that I amount to nothing,<br/>
&gt; like I used to.  But it took a long time and lots of supportive people<br/>
&gt; around me who seemed to believe in me, for reasons I didn&#39;t understand at<br/>
&gt; the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People really close to you can have a huge effect.  Take care of yourself<br/>
&gt; and your daughter will do the same with you.  Your life will be much<br/>
&gt; better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My friend wouldn&#39;t quit calling her mother or taking her mother&#39;s calls.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s no longer with us.  Don&#39;t let that happen to you.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   It&#39;s not only the homeschooling that she insults her with. She also<br/>
&gt; &gt; criticises<br/>
&gt; &gt; her weight, and she tends to stutter when she&#39;s upset so my mother<br/>
&gt; &gt; criticises<br/>
&gt; &gt; that too. She constantly calls her a &quot;Titty Baby&quot; because my daughter<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to leave my side around her (for good reason, eh?) and doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend the night with her like her other granddaughter does (I wonder<br/>
&gt; &gt; why???)<br/>
&gt; &gt; My sister-in-law also has a problem with the way she talks around her<br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter, and we&#39;ve talked about getting together and talking to Mom about<br/>
&gt; &gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; abuse, but we don&#39;t really think it will do any good. As long as my<br/>
&gt; &gt; sister-in-<br/>
&gt; &gt; law is taking my niece to see her it&#39;s not going to get any better. We need<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; join together and talk to her.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; upon reading this was...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please stop taking your child to see her grandmother (maybe until she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stops belittling her.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415916121">-=-. If we<br/>
don&#39;t go then she talks bad about us to the ones that do go! It&#39;s  <br/>
difficult<br/>
for me to go see her without my 8 yo, but I will make an effort to do so<br/>
within the next 2 weeks so that I can talk to her by myself (and see  <br/>
if that<br/>
does any good).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Putting it in writing would be better.<br/>
<br/>
You could pull quotes from things you&#39;ve told us here already.   <br/>
You&#39;ve pretty much already written it.<br/>
<br/>
You could post your draft here and we could help you, if you want.   <br/>
I&#39;m sure there are some lurkers who might need to write such a letter  <br/>
themselves someday (or now).<br/>
<br/>
-=- Thanks for all of the advice. I&#39;m not very good with words,<br/>
and I get flustered very easily and lose my track, so this is going  <br/>
to be hard.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even more reason to do it in writing.  You could write FIRST, before  <br/>
you ever go back, mail it and tell her in the letter that if she&#39;s  <br/>
unwilling to change, you&#39;re unwilling to spend $4 a gallon gas money  <br/>
to deliver yourself to be abused again.<br/>

Thanks. I think I&#39;ll do that. And then what? Wait for her to call me, or just <br/>
drop in and see how she acts? I&#39;ll get this draft within the week hopefully. <br/>
My 8 yo dd is in a theater production this Thursday, Friday, Saturday and <br/>
Sunday and that&#39;s taking up a lot of our time right now, but I&#39;ll get it done <br/>
as soon as I can!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088176817">I&#39;m sorry about my heavy handed post.  I think it was more confiding of me<br/>
than necessary and probably not appropriate for me to say about your<br/>
situation because maybe it doesn&#39;t apply to you.  And I think it makes me<br/>
look weird.  I grew up with a lot of silly stuff that went on and was said.<br/>
My post is somewhat a product of the kind of behavior I grew up with and<br/>
have &quot;normalized&quot; ... behavior I don&#39;t want in my life.  I feel that knowing<br/>
my personal crap is not particularly helpful to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Have you noticed that was a father telling his son to listen to him?  Just<br/>
because a story appears in the Bible doesn&#39;t mean every quote in it falls<br/>
from above.  What about the story when Job&#39;s wife tells him to curse God and<br/>
die.  That&#39;s not a suggestion to agree to, is it?  Unschooling is not a<br/>
familiar way of life for many people who come into contact with it and since<br/>
the Bible is a controversial book even among believers, as a means of<br/>
discourse it can serve to confuse matters more than ever.  I don&#39;t refer to<br/>
for unschooling because the Bible was not about unschooling.  Its purpose is<br/>
something else entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Also you can respect people and still not be obliged to invite them over or<br/>
go see them or call them.  Those things are optional.<br/>
<br/>
In order to change, a break with the tradition of family &quot;norms&quot; must occur<br/>
if some of them aren&#39;t what you want to carry forward into the next<br/>
generations.  Otherwise, it&#39;s easy to end up being all muddy in your head<br/>
about yourself, &quot;respecting&quot; the whole lot, and becoming like the very ones<br/>
who have given you pain and discomfort so needlessly.  Out of respect.  If a<br/>
behavior is wrong or maybe even evil, don&#39;t respect it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most helpful books to me is The Book of Learning and Forgetting<br/>
by Frank Smith.  Its basic message is to join groups of people you want to<br/>
emulate so that you can learn from them the skills you want to have.  If you<br/>
have a need to speak in public well... you might join a toastmasters group.<br/>
If you want to learn to play guitar, you might find players who will let you<br/>
in on their jamming sessions.  Same with parenting or living differently.<br/>
