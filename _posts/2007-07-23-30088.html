<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787813396">This follows just perfectly on a discussion from the drive back from  <br/>
Colorado yesterday, and it was just sent to me by Carelia.  THANK  <br/>
YOU!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the recording of a Alan Watts talking about &quot;Music and  <br/>
Life&quot;  (kind of--it&#39;s more about school and jobs and expectations,  <br/>
but it&#39;s short and beautiful an dillustrated by simple animation by  <br/>
Matt Stone and Trey Parker)<br/>
<br/>
The note I got is below, but I looked and there are others!!!:    <br/>

The animation is very, very cute and useful to the concept (for me,  <br/>
anyway, and maybe for some others who like to do two things at once)<br/>
