<br/>
I started an online unschooling support group here in SC because I figured my <br/>
friend, Melinda, and I just COULDN&#39;T be the only two in SC. I was right. So <br/>
far in a year we have 38 members and are growing monthly.<br/>
<br/>
I had the brainstorm to host a conference because  1) I want the unschoolers <br/>
around here to know there are others out here like them, 2) I want potential <br/>
unschoolers to realize they CAN do it, 3) I like the torture;-), 4) I love a <br/>
good party! and 5) I&#39;m DYING to meet these people in real life!  &lt;BWG&gt;   {{ <br/>
for #5, it probably would&#39;ve been cheaper and easier to get in my car and <br/>
drive!}}<br/>
<br/>
Mississippi really isn&#39;t THAT far! A good day&#39;s drive. Think about it. And if <br/>
your husband isn&#39;t a social butterfly, there&#39;ll be plenty of just sitting <br/>
around listening he can do---plus lots of fun activities he&#39;d enjoy. If he <br/>
warms up enough to talk, there will be several dads willing to chat.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you start an online unschoolers group in MS? And if you want to <br/>
host a conference, I&#39;ll  walk you through it and hold your hand! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, good luck!<br/>

I can&#39;t even imagine him &quot;openly discussing his fears with other dads who&#39;ve<br/>

him out of his shell when they first meet (I managed to:-).<br/>

As unschooling conferences go, that&#39;s as close as it has ever been to <br/>
Mississippi,and might be as close as it ever gets.  You should seriously <br/>
consider going, with or without your husband.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where in Mississippi Columbus is.. guess i should pull out my<br/>
map!  I&#39;m in Gulfport and so far have had NO luck getting anyone together<br/>
down here. I KNOW there are other homeschoolers but they arent very<br/>
sociable. :(  I&#39;m in the planning stages of a Gulf Coast area support group<br/>
so we&#39;ll have to wait and see if I can pull anyone out of the woods :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, there will. I have a 14 year old son; he&#39;s helping plan. I&#39;m hoping to <br/>
have the &quot;funshops&quot; posted on the website by the end of May. (People are slow <br/>
to get their contracts in. Plus we&#39;re looking at more and more.) Funshops and <br/>
activities will not be restricted by age, but there will be things that may <br/>
be more appropriate for some ages than others.<br/>
<br/>
Keep checking the website. Funshops and activities will be posted as they <br/>
come in. If you have any great ideas, please holler!<br/>

have a 12 y.o. ds that is very into gaming also. On another list we <br/>
