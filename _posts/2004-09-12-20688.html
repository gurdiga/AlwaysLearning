PS   If my child wanted to go to public school, I wouldn&#39;t be thrilled, <br/>
but if  I couldn&#39;t meet his perceived needs at home, I am committed to <br/>
letting him  try it.  Because I feel no child should be unschooled <br/>
against his  will.  That would be an oxymoron.  Do some of you disagree <br/>
with  that approach?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Nope. But I would also do everything in my power to make home look MUCH  more <br/>
interesting (not a difficult proposition! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re in the midst of this discussion at our house right now-----NOT that  <br/>
either of my boys are interested in school. It&#39;s the girlfriend.<br/>
 <br/>
Carly (Cameron&#39;s girlfriend) believes that I&#39;m brainwashing Duncan, 8.  (I <br/>
joke about that all the time. But at the same time, I would allow him to go  to <br/>
school if that&#39;s what he really wanted.) <br/>
 <br/>
Carly and Cameron have these long discussions about children and  <br/>
child-rearing (NOT that anything&#39;s in the oven! &lt;g&gt;), not mention  unschooling vs <br/>
school.She thinks that Cameron, having had eight years of  schooling, can make an <br/>
informed decision about school---*even though* he hasn&#39;t  been in high school. <br/>
(He HAS sat in on a college class, though.) But  that Duncan, always unschooled, <br/>
cannot.<br/>
 <br/>
I contend that *I* have been on both sides of the fence and have chosen  <br/>
wisely. *She* has only seen the schooled side---*she* has not been exposed  enough <br/>
to unschooling to make an informed decision. Cameron&#39;s seen both and  chooses <br/>
to remain at home. Duncan is only eight---he has plenty of time to form  <br/>
opinions---while watching the tv shows that encourage schools! How lame! He also  <br/>
has a schooled friend who comes over with all the school baggage---and I&#39;m NOT <br/>
 talking homework! &lt;g&gt; Duncan sees that already---comparing CJ to his  <br/>
unschooled buds.<br/>
 <br/>
I joke with the boys that I&#39;m brainwashing them. But I&#39;ve told stories  about <br/>
school. Good stories. I had exceptional teachers. Lots of them! Of course,  <br/>
there was no option back then. It was school for me or jail-time for my <br/>
parents.  I chose school! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I think the big difference here is that the schooled kids are being  <br/>
brainwashed by school, their parents, AND society----but no one thinks of THAT  as <br/>
brainwashing! That&#39;s just the way it is. But whatever you do----watch out for  <br/>
those Holties! That brainwashing cult!<br/>
 <br/>
Puleeze!<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s planning on college. Cameron asked her why. &quot;Because.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Right.....who&#39;s brainwashed?<br/>

Try &quot;counter programming&quot; with Buffy the Vampire Slayer (on DVD).  The underlying metaphor of that show is &quot;school is hell&quot;.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also think Simpsons and Recess and other sassy shows have a realistic depictions of some of the ickiness of school.<br/>
<br/>
Would the girlfriend (Carly) actually not want to leave school if she had a choice?  Can you draw her out about what she thinks is wonderful about school.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve had a similar conversation with my brother. He says homeschoolers are brainwashed and cult-like.  I say, &quot;No, school is the big brainwashing machine.  You just don&#39;t realize you were brainwashed.&quot;)<br/>

 <br/>
Even shows that PROMOTE school---like Barney and Arthur and some teen  <br/>
shows----I know there are a bunch----make it look bad. There&#39;s just no way to  make <br/>
school look attractive when you&#39;re a *free* eight year old! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve offered for Duncan to go camp----but that, too, looks lame copared to  <br/>
what we can put together here. AND we don&#39;t have all those rules!  &lt;G&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Mein brainwashing is vorking, Igor! BWAHAHAHA!<br/>
