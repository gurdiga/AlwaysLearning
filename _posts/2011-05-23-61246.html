<div id="ygrps-yiv-121520195">I recently wrote a review on Amazon.com for Sandra Dodd&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling. I was surprised to see that mine was only the third review posted. <br/>
<br/>
The book has a specialty title but at its core it is one of the best parenting books around. I read it as my baby turned two; just as I was considering &quot;screen time&quot;, food choices and sleep schedules. Sandra&#39;s book brilliantly described how attachment parenting can evolve past infancy. Thanks to her writing I have not &quot;done&quot; anything to my child that I will wish to undo. What a gift. <br/>
<br/>
I love the &quot;idea ball&quot; concept that governs this board. Stretching that concept a bit, if the Big Book of Unschooling was a physical ball of ideas it would be best for parents, children, families if it were the size of a blimp with flashing lights. Unmissable. At least as visible as all of the &quot;popular&quot; child rearing advice that bombards parents. <br/>
<br/>
If readers were to post hundreds of reviews in places like Amazon.com would this title be more visible to parents seeking alternate philosophies? Would publishers take note and publish more material like this? Maybe. I hope so. That possibility was well worth my time to post a review. I hope many others will consider doing the same.</div>

 </span></blockquote>An excellent idea, Jessica! I forgot that the Big Book was sold  <br/>
through Amazon - I got my copy direct from Sandra&#39;s hands &lt;g&gt;. I&#39;ll  <br/>
get on writing a review as soon as the Life is Good Conference is done.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the conference, I&#39;ll be selling Sandra&#39;s books there.  I  <br/>
will mention to anyone who buys a copy to go to Amazon and write a  <br/>
review. I&#39;ll also ask them to write, as you did, to Sandra or the list  <br/>
to tell how the book has made an impact on their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder!<br/>
