<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854459230">(Oh, what a tangled web we cross when we get to it...)<br/>
<br/>
Analogies and Metaphors Found in High School Essays:<br/>
<br/>
His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and<br/>
breaking alliances like<br/>
underpants in a dryer without Cling Free.<br/>
<br/>
She grew on him like she was a colony of E. coli and<br/>
he was room-temperature Canadian beef.<br/>
<br/>
She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that<br/>
sound a dog makes just before it throws up.<br/>
<br/>
Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
He was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree.<br/>
<br/>
The revelation that his marriage of 30 years had<br/>
disintegrated because of<br/>
his wife&#39;s infidelity came as a rude shock, like a<br/>
surcharge to a formerly surcharge-free ATM.<br/>
<br/>
The little boat gently drifted across the pond<br/>
exactly the way a bowling ball wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
McBride fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a<br/>
Hefty bag filled with vegetable soup.<br/>
<br/>
From the attic came an unearthly howl. The whole<br/>
scene had an eerie, surreal<br/>
quality, like when you&#39;re on vacation in another<br/>
city and Jeopardy comes on at 7:00 p.m. instead of<br/>
7:30.<br/>
<br/>
Her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after<br/>
a sneeze.<br/>
<br/>
The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like<br/>
maggots when you fry them in hot grease.<br/>
<br/>
Long separated by cruel fate, the star-crossed<br/>
lovers raced across the<br/>
grassy field toward each other like two freight<br/>
trains, one having left<br/>
Cleveland at 6:36 p.m. traveling at 55 mph, the<br/>
other from Topeka at 4:19 p.m. at a speed of 35 mph.<br/>
<br/>
John and Mary had never met. They were like two<br/>
hummingbirds who had also never met.<br/>
<br/>
He fell for her like his heart was a mob informant<br/>
and she was the East River.<br/>
<br/>
Even in his last years, Grandpappy had a mind like a<br/>
steel trap, only one that had been left out so long,<br/>
it had rusted shut.<br/>
<br/>
Shots rang out, as shots are wont to do.<br/>
<br/>
The plan was simple, like my brother-in-law Phil.<br/>
But unlike Phil, this plan just might work.<br/>
<br/>
The young fighter had a hungry look, the kind you<br/>
get from not eating for a while.<br/>
<br/>
He was as lame as a duck. Not the metaphorical lame<br/>
duck, either, but a real<br/>
duck that was actually lame. Maybe from stepping on<br/>
a land mine or something.<br/>
<br/>
The knife was as sharp as the tone used by Rep.<br/>
Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.)<br/>
in her first several points of parliamentary<br/>
procedure made to Rep. Henry<br/>
Hyde (R-Ill.) in the House Judiciary Committee<br/>
hearings on the impeachment<br/>
of President William Jefferson Clinton.<br/>
<br/>
The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended<br/>
one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.<br/>
<br/>
It was an American tradition, like fathers chasing<br/>
kids around with power tools.<br/>
<br/>
He was deeply in love. When she spoke, he thought he<br/>
heard bells, as if she were a garbage truck backing up.<br/>
<br/>
Her eyes were like limpid pools, only they had<br/>
forgotten to put in any pH cleanser.<br/>
<br/>
She walked into my office like a centipede with 98<br/>
missing legs. Her voice had that tense, grating quality,<br/>
like a generation thermal paper FAX machine that needed a band<br/>
tightened.<br/>
<br/>
It hurt the way your tongue hurts after you<br/>
accidentally staple it to the wall.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010888315">I&#39;ve seen these before, Kelly.  These two are my absolute favorites; they <br/>
made laugh out loud in the middle of the night when I first saw them. ~Marji<br/>
