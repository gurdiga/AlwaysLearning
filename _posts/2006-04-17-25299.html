<div id="ygrps-yiv-608738700">A couple of weeks ago I went to the electronic&#39;s store with my <br/>
husband.  I choose to go but really had no interest in what was in the <br/>
store.  It was BOREING!  and it really made me think about how my kids <br/>
feel when they come say shoe shopping with me.  If you have NOTHING to <br/>
do in the store and the person who is doing the shopping is jsut busy <br/>
shopping you are left.  So if your are having a hard time remembering <br/>
what it&#39;s like to be in that situation (and that is pretty much the <br/>
situation most kids are in when you see them out shopping)  Try it you <br/>
will be more interactive with your kids next time and when you see <br/>
other kids out &quot;shopping&quot; give them a smile and try with them too!<br/>
<br/>
learning all the time!<br/>
