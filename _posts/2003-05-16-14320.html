<div id="ygrps-yiv-258894598">Hi folks!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t post very often, but I thought I would tap into the wonderful minds on this list to help <br/>
inform the homeschoolers (mostly religious and mostly school-at-homers) in my area (easter NC) about <br/>
the OTHER side of hslda. :-) Today they posted an article regarding Scott Somerville&#39;s appearance on <br/>
a fox news show:<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
HSLDA Staff Attorney Scott Somerville, accompanied by his eldest<br/>
daughter, Christy, will be appearing tomorrow, Friday, May 16, on<br/>
DaySide with Linda Vester. This new show from the Fox News Channel<br/>
discusses issues in a talk-show format and airs at 1:00 p.m. ET.<br/>
----------------------<br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t bother me too much, but ---<br/>
Afterward this was added:<br/>
(due to certain content those with weak stomachs - be forewarned)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357593436">Ten reasons not to join HSLDA<br/>
<br/>
The first pop-up ad on their website was for a book by Michael Farris :::shudder::::<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA supports a House Bill in Texas that protects a parent�s right to corporal punishment of their kids.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA opposes a law in Louisiana requiring all adults to report suspected child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA� s overall support for right-wing politics.<br/>
<br/>
Michael Farris� affiliation with HSLDA.<br/>
<br/>
They seem intent on defining homeschooling as something parents do to protect their children from any liberal influences. As a liberal, I just don�t agree with limiting my kids� contact with the world around them. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I couldn�t come up with 10 reasons. I don�t need 10 reasons, because one is enough for me. <br/>
<br/>
I disagree with their very conservative, right-wing political stance, and with the leadership of Michael Farris, a fundamentalist Christian intent on creating a Christian America. I think what HSLDA is most interested in is not providing a way for children to learn and grow as they need to, but rather in protecting the right of parents to control their children�s lives. I can�t affiliate myself with people who support laws protecting the abuse of children by their parents.<br/>

Ah!  Then a reason could be<br/>
<br/>
Belief in the separation of church and state.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
Belief that children are intelligent humans with rights and feelings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay I know better than to start a religious thread but I have to say this:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather be a sinner than a worm. I&#39;m sure I may have been a worm in some <br/>
life, but I must not have liked it much, because worms really bug me (along <br/>
with Ventriliquist puppets, clowns and mimes, but that&#39;s another story and my <br/>
friends who lurk here are smiling now). No pun intended. <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who doesn&#39;t compost because she hates worms, but thinks its great <br/>
that other people do.<br/>

<br/>
My SIL called to let me know there was going to be a workshop at her <br/>
school for kids.  It was learning to mime.  Two weeks ago that <br/>
probably would have interested my dd, but she got Sims House Party <br/>
and in it, if a mime comes to your party you know you are giving a <br/>
dud of a party.  If Drew Carey shows up, it&#39;s the bomb!<br/>
Now mimes are SO not cool.<br/>

<br/>
Ahhhh!!! I have to say that while Kelly&#39;s post made me nausious, this one <br/>
made my leg hairs grow. I hate mimes so much, If one showed up at my party, <br/>
he&#39;d be dead not a dud.LMAO I would love to have Drew at a party, but he is <br/>
actually somewhat shy, from what I&#39;ve heard from some friends. But he seems <br/>
like he has such a great heart. I&#39;m sure my DH, who thinks of himself as <br/>
quite the comedian, could give Drew quite a bit of subject matter to work <br/>
with.<br/>
