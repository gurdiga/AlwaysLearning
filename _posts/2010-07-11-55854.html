<div id="ygrps-yiv-896124464">We&#39;ve discussed judgment and judgmentalism and critical thinking and  <br/>
clarity and honesty on this list before.  Regularly.  I was thinking  <br/>
of doing another round, and found this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you think everyone around you is judging you, than maybe you  <br/>
should look at how you judge everyone around you and stop doing it.  <br/>
It&#39;s that simple.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was on the facebook page of the dad of an unschooling family I&#39;ve  <br/>
known since before we were unschooling.  He has no idea that in the  <br/>
past day on this list two people have said &quot;not judging, but...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I *Know* people are judging me all the time.  It&#39;s part of thought.    <br/>
People are deciding whether I&#39;m for real, one way or another.  Whether  <br/>
I should be invited to play board games with them.  Whether I&#39;m a good  <br/>
person to confide in about something burning and current.  Whether I  <br/>
could go to Walgreen&#39;s and get shampoo for them (friend has a broken  <br/>
leg; I&#39;ve had two broken legs, so she knew I&#39;d be sympathetic!!).   <br/>
Whether I suck.  Whether I&#39;m wonderful.  Whether I made their marriage  <br/>
better, or whether they&#39;ve decided to e-mail me and say that I&#39;ve  <br/>
probably done more damage to new unschooling families than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to accept the positive things, or the fun things, and reject  <br/>
the negative parts with &quot;I&#39;m feeling judged,&quot; how would that make the  <br/>
positive things more sensible?   And that&#39;s not to say that I  <br/>
indiscriminately consider them all equally thoughtful and valid.   <br/>
Someone might ask my advice more for a photo op or because mine&#39;s the  <br/>
first e-mail address she found, than that she has thought carefully  <br/>
and thinks I would be the best for her in her situation.   Some of  <br/>
those who have insulted me as hard as they could later came around and  <br/>
apologized.   So many have done that, in fact, that now when someone  <br/>
goes ape shit early on I tend to file them under &quot;Might come around  <br/>
and apologize later&quot; in my head rather than writing them off as never  <br/>
going to get it.<br/>
<br/>
I could call those who said nice things &quot;right; smart; good&quot; and those  <br/>
who didn&#39;t like me &quot;wrong and bad.&quot;  There&#39;s the evidence for the  <br/>
original quote up top that feeling judged involves making a judgment.<br/>
