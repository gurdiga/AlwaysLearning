<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706812638">My partner recently started watching the series Spartacus on Netflix.<br/>
Lots of fighting with strange blood effects, lots of stuff about<br/>
slavery, lots of intricate love triangles (and squares and polyamory),<br/>
and plenty of nudity and sex.  I personally can&#39;t directly watch it<br/>
because the fighting scenes bother me.  I listen to it in the<br/>
background while I&#39;m doing other things on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
Draven (our 10 y/o son) popped in tonight and started watching.<br/>
Nudity he kind of laughs at or closes his eyes, and during sex scenes<br/>
he&#39;ll leave and ask us to let him know when they&#39;re over.  He asked if<br/>
he could watch the episodes he&#39;s missed and Parker (my partner) told<br/>
him he could pull it up on his Xbox.  A few minutes later (during a<br/>
sex scene that was particularly graphic) I said I&#39;d rather him only<br/>
watch it with us and not alone, so that if he saw something and had<br/>
questions we were available.  He said, &quot;uh, yeah, no, not asking you<br/>
questions about sex.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He does ask questions about sex and we discuss it just like everything<br/>
else.  He&#39;s almost 11 and talks a lot about girlfriends, but at the<br/>
same time turns his head when a breast is shown for too long on TV.<br/>
So he&#39;s at the stage where he&#39;s starting to see girls as different<br/>
from boys, but he&#39;s not quite ready to know just how different.  Him<br/>
and I have had lots of conversations about sex, starting somewhere<br/>
around &quot;where do babies come from&quot; and including &quot;if two women can&#39;t<br/>
have babies, do they have sex.&quot;  Now that Parker is fully settled into<br/>
the role of 2nd mom he tends to ask her most of the questions, since<br/>
his father&#39;s reaction is &quot;you&#39;re too young to know about that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if asking him to only watch it with us was the wrong<br/>
thing to do.  I&#39;m not sure why I think it was the wrong thing, but for<br/>
some reason I have that nagging &quot;wrong reaction&quot; feeling in the back<br/>
of my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any advice!<br/>

much as suggesting. Suggestions are a good way of throwing out another  <br/>
point of view for consideration.<br/>
<br/>
But in your mind was your suggestion more of a polite way of asking  <br/>
which is more of a (falsely) &quot;polite&quot; way of telling kids what to do?  <br/>
Were you expecting him to only choose to watch with you or not watch  <br/>
at all? And when he chose option C that&#39;s what&#39;s thrown you off?<br/>

of how important the topic is and how personally invested you feel  <br/>
that he get the right information and understand the right things in  <br/>
the right way?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible your partner feels more free to hand him the facts and  <br/>
trust him to take what he needs from what she says and trust that  <br/>
he&#39;ll ask for more when he needs it. More like a trusted adult friend  <br/>
than another mom.<br/>

<br/>
Because he had already seen some and was interested, it&#39;s hard to say, at that point, &quot;no.&quot;  It will probably make him very curious as to why the &quot;no.&quot;  And he might NOT want to be in the room with you during sex scenes because you&#39;ll be uncomfortable and fighting scenes, because you&#39;re uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asks whether the kid was upset by the &quot;no,&quot; and that would make a difference.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly says if he has to watch it with his mom there, he won&#39;t be able to ignore it and play Lego, or wind forward.  Her friend Gilbert says that he won&#39;t be paying as much attention to the story as he will be thinking about what his mom thinks about what they&#39;re watching.<br/>
<br/>
Holly also points out that if he&#39;s learning about sex from Spartacus, it&#39;s a lot better (IF he&#39;s curious) than a random google image search.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some advice from teenagers who happen to be here eating oatmeal with a mom on a Saturday morning.<br/>

option, it&#39;s that I couldn&#39;t really come up with an answer to &quot;why?&quot; even<br/>
though it was never asked.  Why can&#39;t he ask questions later, why can&#39;t he<br/>
choose to not ask questions but still be interested.  Of course wondering<br/>
about the why didn&#39;t really hit me until later.  In the end, Parker and I<br/>
were ready for bed and he wanted to watch more.  Parker knew I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
how to handle it so she took over and I left the room to give them some time<br/>
to talk.  When I came back she told me it would be fine and that he was in<br/>
his room watching it.  I was okay with that.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My partner is more like &quot;one of the guys&quot; and I think he&#39;s more comfortable<br/>
with a more guy type answer.  He used to ask his father this stuff, until he<br/>
got &quot;you&#39;re too young&quot; one too many times.  From that point, until Parker<br/>
was part of our family, he asked me.  I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because of some<br/>
emotional vibe I&#39;m giving off.  I&#39;m not sure how I would remove that emotion<br/>
from the equation.  Whenever there&#39;s a question she&#39;s not sure how to<br/>
answer, we all discuss it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think being uncomfortable during the fight scenes effects it.<br/>
 Parker and Draven both watch way more TV than I do, and they both like some<br/>
pretty gory/graphic/violent stuff.  I don&#39;t mind being in the room with it,<br/>
as long as I can distract myself when needed.  It doesn&#39;t make me<br/>
uncomfortable that he&#39;s watching it, I just don&#39;t like seeing it myself.<br/>
 Horror movies that have creepy music coupled with screaming make me leave<br/>
the room, but typically they&#39;ll find a time to watch that when I&#39;m not<br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
This was the first time we&#39;ve watched something with lots of sex scenes that<br/>
are somewhat central to the plot, there&#39;s a lot of dialog during some of the<br/>
scenes that if missed, would leave out part of the plot line.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
I&#39;ve had time to process my feelings on him seeing it.  I did notice that<br/>
when he came in at first and wanted to watch I had no problem with it, a<br/>
major change from a few years ago.  I&#39;m saying yes way more often and being<br/>
comfortable with it, but occasionally I hit a stumbling block where I have<br/>
to work through something in my own head.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He wasn&#39;t upset by it when I said it, but later he did mention that he<br/>
wasn&#39;t ready to stop watching, and we were.  At that point we told him to go<br/>
ahead, I know Parker had some sort of conversation with him right before he<br/>
turned it on in his room, but I&#39;m not sure what that conversation was.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think my only fear about sex ed through Spartacus is the way sex is<br/>
handled.  Slaves are told who to sleep with and they have no choice.  The<br/>
open relationship aspect doesn&#39;t bother me when it&#39;s open and honest, the<br/>
cheating does bother me.  The more I think about it the more I wonder if I&#39;m<br/>
having a sort of &quot;you&#39;re too young to handle this on your own&quot; reaction to<br/>
this.  I don&#39;t feel that way on the surface, but my inner nagging voice is<br/>
saying it.  That&#39;s what I think prompted my initial no, then my unschooling<br/>
inner voice piped up.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re way way way more open with him about sex and sexuality than our<br/>
parents ever were.  I remember my own Google searches and that was a lot<br/>
stranger than sex ed through Spartacus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704538208">Once Gourika (9) and I were watching this amazing film Holiday, and there<br/>
are some moderate love scenes between Cameroon Diaz and Jude Law. She too<br/>
closes her eyes while watching those scenes, but overall she liked the film.<br/>
So next time she watched it again she simply used the remote to skip the bed<br/>
scenes (i just happened to pass by and saw it from the corner of my eyes),<br/>
and she still watched the full film, and I guess she figured out that, those<br/>
scenes were not the CRUX of the film.<br/>
<br/>
She has asked me how babies come and about sex. So when she met a couple at<br/>
our place who do not have children by choice. She asked &quot;don&#39;t they have<br/>
sex?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I told her about how having babies can be prevented if people use birth<br/>
control measures.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of all this is how one thing leads to another amazing moment<br/>
where questions come and can be answered easily.<br/>

such a personal thing that I don&#39;t want to let my concerns about<br/>
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; interfere for Karl because it&#39;s reassuring to know<br/>
