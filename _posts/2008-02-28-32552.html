 </span></blockquote>The press has barely noticed that we exist let alone science.  <br/>
Unschoolers are not up to the level of scientific surveys yet ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And unschoolers are people. They react as people do to control which  <br/>
depends on personality (naturally fearful? skeptical?) and depends on  <br/>
the atmosphere (fear? waste of time?) around TV. Probably the only  <br/>
significant factor different with unschooled kids is they don&#39;t need  <br/>
the stress relief that schooled kids often use TV and games for.  <br/>
Unschoolers just want to use them because they&#39;re fun.<br/>
<br/>
They also react as people do to what they like and what they don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
So for a child who wasn&#39;t going to be drawn to TV and games, the  <br/>
control probably won&#39;t have much impact. My beet intake was limited  <br/>
as a child just because they weren&#39;t around our house much but I  <br/>
didn&#39;t go on a beet eating frenzy once I saw jars and jars of them in  <br/>
the store ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For kids who did want it: Some will try to cram in as much as they  <br/>
can when they have the freedom to do so. Some will be fearful and  <br/>
impose those fears on their own kids. Some will have no use for TV  <br/>
because they&#39;ve internalized it&#39;s a waste of time. Both will probably  <br/>
feel some discomfort around people who watch TV and play games --  <br/>
especially if the let their kids! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Are there studies done on adults who were controlled as kids? I can&#39;t  <br/>
see unschooling effecting the results.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know Pam Sorooshian&#39;s husband (she&#39;s off to a conference this  <br/>
weekend I think) didn&#39;t even see a TV as a child. He&#39;s had a love  <br/>
affair with it ever since he moved to this country. :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are several factors that determine how a particular person will  <br/>
react which is what makes humans so fascinating :-)<br/>

  I have neighbors that homeschool and they have done it since the kids were school age. They have 5 kids and are very wealthy. The mother stays at home but has a math degree from an Ivy League School ( can&#39;t remember which now) and the father is a famous MD at Mayo Clinic. They don&#39;t have a TV.They have this way of thinking that TV is a waste of time and that the kids would do nothing but fight and watch TV and never pick up a book.<br/>
  Once the youngest was here playing with my then 3 year old ds , she was 11 years old, and I had the TV on some show on Discovery or Animal Planet. She sat down for a moment and got sucked in . It was a great show and she watched till the end with me. She then turned and said  how it was a great show and how it was not a waste of time like she had heard all shows where.These kids do have computer and watch movies on it, with the parents approval.<br/>

When they were young they did not miss TV. Once they turned like 16-17 years old they would go spend the night at my cousins( kids were best friends) and they would do nothing but watch TV even spending the whole night awake to do so. They binged as much as they could.<br/>

<br/>
We were recently at an event that included all kinds of homeschoolers, and the biggest <br/>
controversy of the week came from a family who shuns technology as a waste of time.  The <br/>
problem was that she couldn&#39;t convince her (about) 10 year old son to stay off of the <br/>
computers, which at times was the biggest activity going on.  By the end of the week she was <br/>
fuming, and he was bingeing  when he got the chance.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite photos that came out of the week was her son at a computer, <br/>
concentrating very hard on something he was doing, with a halo of friends all around him, <br/>
watching with rapt attention.  It&#39;s a hard sell to try to convince me that there wasn&#39;t <br/>
something important going on in that group for someone, if not everyone, but the drama <br/>
that ensued would certainly have invalidated that for her son.<br/>

Yep....years of eating nothing but junk food, watching tv and playing  <br/>

<br/>
Experiences create maturity, I think, and choices help with choices,  <br/>
and limiting children (treating them like children, in the put-down,  <br/>
limiting ways) seems so clearly damaging that I can&#39;t stop thinking  <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
That boy had to frantically live some of his childhood after he left  <br/>
home.  There are young people driving cars, drinking, staying out  <br/>
late, living in ways that were forbidden, and the side effect is (in  <br/>
some cases, thankfully not most or all) alcoholism, death, pregnancy,  <br/>
loss of jobs and relationships, loss of money and opportunity, loss  <br/>
of self esteem, sex with strangers (and all those dangers:  see above  <br/>
with that in mind).<br/>
<br/>
There are other bad ways to &quot;treat children like children,&quot; and I  <br/>
need to get my thoughts together and write that up.<br/>

Unfortunately for the relationship with the parents, she now knows  <br/>
that what they told her about TV wasn&#39;t true.<br/>
That could affect her reaction to what they&#39;ve told her about saving  <br/>
money, and dating, and about how she will feel about being honest  <br/>
with her parents.<br/>

It&#39;s to be avoided, this loss of faith.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is an interesting point actually.  If tv video games are <br/>
accessible, meaning that it is sitting there, but is artificially <br/>
restricted, it becomes a point of control and an artificially <br/>
restricted thing that suddenly has a lot of power.  If you don&#39;t have <br/>
tv or video games at all, its not sitting there looking accessible or <br/>
a point of control.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up without a tv for much of my childhood.  When I was a young <br/>
adult, I didn&#39;t have a tv until I met my husband and moved in with <br/>
him.  We don&#39;t control tv or video games.  Currently the tv is off <br/>
and one daughter is reading manga and the other one is playing with <br/>
fashion polly&#39;s snuggled up on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
I can go for days and not even think of the tv.  I really could live <br/>
without it, although I love movies.  My older daughter who has never <br/>
been restricted and has watched tv all day, for days on end, hardly <br/>
ever watches tv these days.  My younger daughter could turn the tv on <br/>
right this very moment and I wouldn&#39;t care at all.  She could <br/>
continue to watch it all day, but she&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think it&#39;s far worse to own a tv and have video games <br/>
and control it, than to not have them at all, unless of course a <br/>
child is really wanting it and the parent is refusing that child&#39;s <br/>
needs.  It&#39;s really about the control isn&#39;t it?</div>
