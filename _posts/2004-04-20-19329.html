<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724170084">My son is 10, he is very cerebral, reads 24/7, plays no sports. We <br/>
do encourage him to get his body moving, we hike together, he <br/>
has a dancing video game...But he is overweight, always has <br/>
been big. This seems to be a factor in the way that other kids <br/>
see and interact with him. It seems that most kids have a <br/>
reluctance to be friendly to him because of his appearance. I&#39;ve <br/>
been binging him to parks and pools  &quot;looking for friends&quot; for a <br/>
long time now and I&#39;ve seen the reaction on the other children&#39;s <br/>
faces, this is not a mistaken impression of mine, so please, no <br/>
lectures on my &quot;misperception&quot; of this problem. My question is, <br/>
do any of you have a similar story? More to the point, how do you <br/>
&quot;find&quot; friends for your child, when this is a factor? We are <br/>
presently doing independent study through a Waldorf  charter <br/>
school, in which he has 1 friend, sort of...We are wanting to <br/>
homeschool/unschool but the fear of total isolation and my son <br/>
being friendless is rather daunting. Please, send only helpful <br/>
suggestions. Also, I am new to this group and to the concept of <br/>
unschooling, I did post a previous question and intro, but it just <br/>
disappeared...So, I&#39;ll do it again; I&#39;m a SAHM with a 10 yr old boy <br/>
and an almost 4 yr old girl. Unschooling sounds like the perfect  <br/>
solution to some of the difficulties I&#39;ve been having, honestly, I <br/>
wept when I read some of the information and parent <br/>
&quot;testimonials&quot;.  Thank you for any advice you can throw my way...</div>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have that kind of kid so have no answers in that area, but think <br/>
about the fact that he&#39;s only got one sort of friend now, in a school-like <br/>
situation if I&#39;m reading you right.<br/>
<br/>
In general, the way for homeschooled kids to find friends is to be involved <br/>
in activities they enjoy and meet them there. Taking him to the park or <br/>
pool wouldn&#39;t have that shared interest factor to help the other kids get <br/>
past his appearance. I think I would look for other kinds of activities <br/>
that he might enjoy. Is there a homeschooling group nearby? There might be <br/>
activities available through them that would appeal to a boy like yours <br/>
(the opposite of my physically active boy - grin). Maybe there&#39;s a chess <br/>
club or a science club or reading discussion group, that kind of thing. <br/>
He&#39;s more likely to meet a &quot;kindred spirit&quot; at something like that. Or your <br/>
community recreation facility might have some activities that he&#39;d like.<br/>

<br/>
Hi -<br/>
<br/>
My son just turned 10 and tends to be sedentary and a bit overweight.  My brother bought him an &quot;eye toy&quot; for our Playstation 2 and that has encouraged getting his body moving.  I moved last year, and I sometimes think that *I* have a hard time making friends because I make a bad impression on people being very very overweight myself.  So I sympathize.<br/>
<br/>
I think homeschooling park days are a pretty good place to make friends.  And sometimes it takes awhile for people to make friends.  I think my son was more at ease socially when he was younger.  Now he tends to be slow to approach people.<br/>
<br/>
What would your son like to do with other kids?  What kind of play does he like when he&#39;s not reading?  Or does he just want kids to talk about books with?  (Not trying to sound rude, just looking for ideas.  You could host activities related to what he likes to do.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380291266">&quot;Please, send only helpful <br/>
suggestions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you think folks are going to purposely send UN-helpful suggestions? Assume that everyone is going to automatically give you the best advice they can personally give, and it&#39;s up to you to decide what is useful for your own life.<br/>
<br/>
As to the friends issue....we truly don&#39;t have a problem with that,ever. And it&#39;s got nothing to do with weight or looks or other issues, it&#39;s because my children meet people based on their interests and commonalities. We don&#39;t go looking for friends, they happen as a natural side effect of pursuing lives we love.<br/>
<br/>
Some of our favorite folks are in our unschooling support group, but we&#39;ve met great people through church, Yu-gi-oh trading and even through the bookstore.  I have been around several unschooling families the last few years, and seen some kids with challenges, including being heavy or autistic or physically challenged, but none have been treated any differently. What my kids use for judgement is how nice the person acts, whether or not they have some common interests and have fun together. That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
So I would recommend other unschoolers if that&#39;s the direction you&#39;re planning on going. Or even other relaxed homeschoolers if that isn&#39;t possible. I also recommend helping your child pursue his interests and find friends that way. <br/>
Seems like the gaming groups we&#39;ve hung out with gather a very diverse group of kids, some of them not so physically gifted, but they all have fun and I haven&#39;t heard teasing.<br/>
School kids have that chicken pecking mentality, so it&#39;s more common for them to single out anyone a little bit different. Not so with children raised away from that toxic environment...or at least not as common. That&#39;s been my experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176969290">Gosh, I had no idea how very careful with my words I needed to be to <br/>
post a question on this site. When I posted it I was feeling very hurt, <br/>
vulnerable and fairly depressed. I really tried to do my best to choose <br/>
words that would not draw unnecessary meanness from strangers. Well, <br/>
the very plea for only &quot;helpful suggestions&quot; prompted a few strangers <br/>
to send exactly what I didn&#39;t need. Ren, were you purposely shouting <br/>
&quot;UN&quot; at me when you wrote &quot;UN-helpful&quot;? That&#39;s what I meant by <br/>
unhelpful...It didn&#39;t help me at all, neither did the blow by blow <br/>
correcting of my letter from Sandra. I made that unfortunate plea <br/>
(helpful suggestions only...) because I am used to people trying to <br/>
tell me that it&#39;s not about my son&#39;s weight, or it&#39;s all in my <br/>
head...That kind of unhelpful thing. I also didn&#39;t want thinly veiled <br/>
attacks on my character flaws or the way I worded my letter. Haven&#39;t <br/>
any of you ever been so depressed and so vulnerable that you felt the <br/>
need to say &quot;please don&#39;t be mean to me, I&#39;m just asking for help...&quot;? <br/>
Well, that&#39;s how I was feeling when I wrote my letter. I am sorry it <br/>
offended any of you enough to make you feel you needed to write hurtful <br/>
things to me.  I&#39;m feeling pretty awful and more depressed that my <br/>
letter drew such a response from anyone, let alone Sandra. Wow, just <br/>
looking at your letter makes me just feel like a piece of poop. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know that there was this much wrong with me. Thank you to all of <br/>
the folks who sent helpful suggestions and for choosing not to point <br/>
out all of the wrong things I said or the wrong things I think. I am <br/>
just a mom, at her wit&#39;s end, hoping that someone out there has an <br/>
&quot;answer&quot; that I haven&#39;t already heard. I definitely wasn&#39;t looking for <br/>
mean-spirited replies that would make me cry and leave me feeling even <br/>
more alone. I know I am a sensitive person and that being depressed <br/>
makes me more sensitive, but please don&#39;t inundate me with &quot;you&#39;re too <br/>
sensitive!!&quot; e-mails, I know I just couldn&#39;t handle it. Maybe you guys <br/>
could stand to take it easy on some of us newcomers especially those of <br/>
us who are struggling. Honestly, I was just looking for some help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291663150">Sandra, I have to reply to some of the specific things you wrote back <br/>
at me. First, I was trying to get help and chose to write as short and <br/>
sweet a letter as I could. I wasn&#39;t able to include every detail about <br/>
my son. The details would fill volumes. He&#39;s a big guy, but he swims <br/>
like a fish, so for us, the pool was a place where he felt confident <br/>
and joyous. Are you angry that I used the phrase &quot;find friends&quot; ? I <br/>
wrote &quot;find&quot; because that&#39;s how it feels to me sometimes. My son has a <br/>
lot of unique qualities that others may find unpleasant or undesirable <br/>
or too intense, so sometimes (and I&#39;m probably wrong to do it, but I do <br/>
get desperate) I will try to help &quot;win over&quot; a child who seems like a <br/>
compatible friend for him who may not give him the time of day if I was <br/>
not there to smooth things over. Sometimes the first impression my son <br/>
gives is not easy for some kids to warmly embrace.  The things my son <br/>
loves to do are not offered in a neat package in this very tiny town of <br/>
ours, but someone did suggest that we create our own group or club, and <br/>
that was a helpful suggestion. Did you really think it would be helpful <br/>
to me to shout at me with boldface type? (&quot;And how will WE really know <br/>
what is useful, not knowing your son?&quot;)  Did you feel you were truly <br/>
being helpful when you wrote that sentence? Or did you feel that I <br/>
needed a cyber-kick in the teeth? If this is the type of response I <br/>
should expect from the un-schooling community when I ask for help, then <br/>
this is not a good community for my family and I to join. Please try to <br/>
keep in mind that when someone asks a bunch of strangers for help, that <br/>
most likely  she (or he) is really desperate and struggling, because <br/>
most people don&#39;t go around asking strangers for help. To open yourself <br/>
up to the world like that, to admit you need help and then to work up <br/>
the courage to ask for it, that is a very vulnerable place to be. Can <br/>
you open your heart and try to understand how easily hurt one&#39;s <br/>
feelings would be in that situation?  I can handle being told that what <br/>
I think I need is entirely incorrect. Just please believe me when I say <br/>
that I don&#39;t need mean-spirited e-mails when I am genuinely and <br/>
desperately asking for help. Was my letter really that offensive? I <br/>
would really like to thank all of the people who gave me answers from <br/>
their hearts and I am sorry and embarrassed to be this hurt by the <br/>
mean-spirited responses. It just hurts that much more when you&#39;re <br/>
already pretty low.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like to try to be helpful for you here, but I feel like I&#39;m sort of in<br/>
a box with respect to what I can say...  you are asking for help, but it<br/>
feels like you are also asking for it to look a certain way.  I think this<br/>
is what others are trying to say to you.  I know that when I first read<br/>
your message and read the &quot;only helpful suggestions please&quot; my whole body<br/>
halted... like I was following along and then all of a sudden I hit a wall.<br/>
That&#39;s what I mean when I say I feel like I&#39;m in a box with what I can say.<br/>
<br/>
When you say that you are used to people saying it&#39;s not about your son&#39;s<br/>
weight, is it possible that you can find something useful and helpful in<br/>
this?  I&#39;m not suggesting that your intuitions are incorrect... you have<br/>
seen the looks of other kids, you have been there and felt and seen the<br/>
interchange.  So, in those moments it has been about your son&#39;s weight with<br/>
those particular kids.  But in my mind the issue isn&#39;t your son&#39;s weight,<br/>
it&#39;s those moments and those kids, and perhaps your expectations (and maybe<br/>
his too) that it will be about his weight in future circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
A thought comes to me that what might be the most helpful thing for your<br/>
situation right now might be to focus on what you can do for you.  You say<br/>
you are depressed, alone, lacking confidence.  So what will help pick you<br/>
up and give you the zing that you need for your life?  This might be<br/>
exactly what your son needs too.  I&#39;d be glad to help you brainstorm about<br/>
this, and to give you boosts every now and then (I&#39;m not online all that<br/>
often, but I usually do end up reading all of the posts and get caught up<br/>
every few days.)<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799489951">Nadine, I agree with Barbara.  You should be actively setting an example <br/>
for him with yourself because where you can make your own friends, only <br/>
he can make his.  Best friendships are founded on common interests <br/>
and/or backgrounds.  Look in those places for yourself to have friends <br/>
and gently encourage him to do the same.  If you feel depressed and <br/>
defensive about his weight, how can he not feel the same.  It&#39;s true <br/>
that a first impression is a lot when meeting new people...so help him <br/>
learn to make that first impression great, by exuding peaceful joy in <br/>
life and open acceptance of other people.  People, when meeting others <br/>
for the first time read body signals much more easily than they do with <br/>
people they know, because  it&#39;s someone new.   So IF your son really <br/>
wants friends (I said if because some people, like intellectuals who <br/>
love to read a lot don&#39;t really need many social outlets) and isn&#39;t just <br/>
responding to your need for more social activities, don&#39;t force <br/>
relationships on him.  Just work on your own situation and help guide <br/>
him to help his own.  Good Luck!    Heidi<br/>

&gt;Nadine,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d like to try to be helpful for you here, but I feel like I&#39;m sort of in<br/>
&gt;a box with respect to what I can say...  you are asking for help, but it<br/>
&gt;feels like you are also asking for it to look a certain way.  I think this<br/>
&gt;is what others are trying to say to you.  I know that when I first read<br/>
&gt;your message and read the &quot;only helpful suggestions please&quot; my whole body<br/>
&gt;halted... like I was following along and then all of a sudden I hit a wall.<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s what I mean when I say I feel like I&#39;m in a box with what I can say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When you say that you are used to people saying it&#39;s not about your son&#39;s<br/>
&gt;weight, is it possible that you can find something useful and helpful in<br/>
&gt;this?  I&#39;m not suggesting that your intuitions are incorrect... you have<br/>
&gt;seen the looks of other kids, you have been there and felt and seen the<br/>
&gt;interchange.  So, in those moments it has been about your son&#39;s weight with<br/>
&gt;those particular kids.  But in my mind the issue isn&#39;t your son&#39;s weight,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s those moments and those kids, and perhaps your expectations (and maybe<br/>
&gt;his too) that it will be about his weight in future circumstances.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A thought comes to me that what might be the most helpful thing for your<br/>
&gt;situation right now might be to focus on what you can do for you.  You say<br/>
&gt;you are depressed, alone, lacking confidence.  So what will help pick you<br/>
&gt;up and give you the zing that you need for your life?  This might be<br/>
&gt;exactly what your son needs too.  I&#39;d be glad to help you brainstorm about<br/>
&gt;this, and to give you boosts every now and then (I&#39;m not online all that<br/>
&gt;often, but I usually do end up reading all of the posts and get caught up<br/>
&gt;every few days.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All the best,<br/>
&gt;--bc--<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178552042">Thanks for the heartfelt reply. I&#39;m not always like this (depressed, <br/>
desperate etc). I recently had a fairly life threatening bout with <br/>
amoebic dysentery and am presently in one of those needing to &quot;fix&quot; <br/>
everything that feels wrong in my life type of modes. And the <br/>
depression is part of the healing process.  I was also hearing a lot <br/>
from my son (during Spring Break) that he needed more friends and that <br/>
he was feeling lonely. That is hard to hear and not try to do something <br/>
about it. The thing about my request for only helpful suggestions <br/>
really just stems from the feeling of almost having died and needing to <br/>
protect myself from barbs that I can&#39;t possibly deflect right now. It <br/>
was not meant to offend but I guess it was a sort of wall, as someone <br/>
described it in a reply. But it was a wall I felt I needed to erect <br/>
because of this raw state I am in at the moment.  Does this make sense? <br/>
I am still pretty shocked that that request offended as much as it did. <br/>
This has been a very educational experience for me as far as my word <br/>
choice is concerned. My son had a nice time at school with his friend <br/>
and his friend came over for a few hours after, so that feels good. I <br/>
am currently thinking up some kind of card-gaming type club or group <br/>
and will post it at his school (the charter school that we do <br/>
independent study through). All of this friendship stuff aside, the <br/>
unschooling vs.schooling stuff came up yesterday for him in art class. <br/>
The kids were being taught a lesson involving black paper and chalky <br/>
pastels and shadow etc. My son balked at the idea of being told exactly <br/>
how to express himself artistically and the teacher was able to coerce <br/>
him to try...long story short, he did the lesson, drew the picture. All <br/>
of the kids were required to draw the exact same picture, of trees and <br/>
the sun creating shadows. When the teacher relayed the story to me of <br/>
my son&#39;s difficulties in art class, her words were &quot;he wanted to do <br/>
what he wanted to do&quot; but of course he bent to what she wanted him to <br/>
do in the end. I am really new to all of this unschooling stuff, and I <br/>
don&#39;t for a minute profess to know anything other than the fact that <br/>
forcing just feels wrong. For this issue to come up on our first day <br/>
back at school just feels like a sign from the universe. I at first was <br/>
torn, feeling like I should have introduced that type of art to him so <br/>
that he would feel more confident in his skills when doing it in front <br/>
of his peers. On he other hand, his artistic interests are more geared <br/>
to Manga cartooning(it&#39;s a type of Japanese graphic novel), so why <br/>
should I force him to do art that he isn&#39;t into? As I worried and <br/>
thought about my failings as a homeschooliing mom last night (&quot;I should <br/>
have taught him how to draw trees, and how to shadow etc&quot;), I went in <br/>
to say goodnight to him and asked him about that art lesson and whether <br/>
he liked it. He said &quot;yes, but isn&#39;t art supposed to be about my <br/>
artistic expression and not about drawing what someone else tells me to <br/>
draw?&quot; I am wondering if all of the trouble and the endless meetings <br/>
and the awful labels that we have endured in our school experience <br/>
could have been avoided if I had heard of unschooling when he was 4. He <br/>
seems like the poster child for unschooling. But how do I sell this to <br/>
my husband who is all about structure and schedules and all of that <br/>
jazz? How do I stop thinking the &quot;old way&quot; myself? This concept seems <br/>
so natural and loving but I can&#39;t stop thinking (or is it worrying) <br/>
about making sure he masters this concept or that concept or whatever <br/>
it is that the schools say he needs to know how to do and when...I am <br/>
grateful for any advice or help any of you can send my way, and I&#39;l do <br/>
my best to not let my feelings get hurt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937221483">Wow, Sandra you are one tough lady. Don&#39;t quite understand where your <br/>
antagonism is coming from as far as I&#39;m concerned. I did read all of <br/>
the posts to me, and I did appreciate the help I was given. I chose not <br/>
to write anything (until your post to me) but I did appreciate the <br/>
help. I felt the need to defend myself after your post and Ren&#39;s <br/>
because I felt my request was being taken the wrong way. Maybe you <br/>
could read the reply I just sent in today, to get a different <br/>
impression of me and or my first post. I think you are bright enough to <br/>
see the negativity in your reply to me, and surely you can&#39;t deny the <br/>
antagonism of today&#39;s reply (even swearing). So, if being a sharp <br/>
tongued woman who says it like it is, even to the point of being a bit <br/>
harsh, is what you are all about, okay. But don&#39;t deny that you are <br/>
sometimes a bit too harsh, and don&#39;t get so upset when someone who has <br/>
been at the receiving end of your words gets a little upset. I agree <br/>
about advice working well through e-mail, and advice (free of nastiness <br/>
and verbal barbs) is what I&#39;m looking for. I was getting past last <br/>
nights hurt feelings until today&#39;s new, even meaner e-mail from you. I <br/>
f you don&#39;t like being called mean, then stop acting mean. Nadine<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402499041">Hi Nadine,<br/>
I just wanted to say I hear you and I respect your vulnerability.  I felt<br/>
the same way reading those posts and was surprised they were taken in the<br/>
context they were to insight such a level of defensiveness.  One thing I<br/>
always tell myself if someone is being a jerk and targeting their stuff at<br/>
me is &quot;It is not about you, it is about them&quot;  I wish I had replied sooner.<br/>
I have had weight issues on and off although not in childhood.  I know how<br/>
vicious American society is toward the overweight.  I also know how<br/>
heartless some people can be when you show them your underbelly.  I am new<br/>
to the board and it is true that I sense some people hear &quot;barking&quot;.  I have<br/>
also picked up some great advice just lurking.  I commend you for reaching<br/>
out and sharing your vulnerability and seeking help and guidance and answers<br/>
to help your son.  I also want to thank you for being a champion to yourself<br/>
by posting this letter and calling attention to the lack of compassion some<br/>
have.  I had a feeling when you were qualifying the feedback be helpful you<br/>
were just asking others to not waste their breath on sesneless drivel.  Most<br/>
people have not a clue about the pain involved in being overweight.  Most<br/>
people have never been called names for simply being a different size and<br/>
most people do not know what it is to be judged for being different.  Some<br/>
people have sticks up their butts and feel offended if you ask for direct<br/>
feedback.  Psychologists especially.  Every one here is just a human being.<br/>
I hope you find a place of forgiveness for fools and continue being the<br/>
special mom and person you are.  Give your son a hug for me.  He is lucky to<br/>
have you.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Finding an existing club might be less pressure on you and him both.  If you <br/>
want to start something, maybe having a one-shot deal (a card playing party, <br/>
four hour session with snacks and cards) would let you know if it seems worth <br/>
continuing.   <br/>
<br/>
And limiting to the kids at the charter school will be a subgroup of kids he <br/>
has already had a chance to be with.  Finding clubs outside that would be more <br/>
expansive.<br/>
<br/>
You could try both.<br/>

<br/>
unschooling vs.schooling stuff came up yesterday for him in art class. -=-<br/>

Having a child in classes and in a charter school prevents a lot of the <br/>

<br/>
The worry needs to start to go the other way if you want to get to <br/>
unschooling.  The less you taught him the better, and the less you deliver him to others <br/>
to be coerced and forced, the better.<br/>
<br/>

Hoping the post gets to being about the child, or unschooling, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
continue to be about the poster and her delicate feelings.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am still pretty shocked that that request offended as much as it did. <br/>
<br/>
This has been a very educational experience for me as far as my word <br/>
<br/>
choice is concerned.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unlike school&#39;s practice writing, this is REAL writing.  You have a choice <br/>
whether to write; nobody&#39;s making you.  You have a choice whether to revise your <br/>
writing; there&#39;s no deadline to &quot;turn it in.&quot;  You have a choice whether to <br/>
post; nobody required it.  You have a choice whether to read the responses; <br/>
nobody tests you later.<br/>
<br/>
Choice is the important element here.  It WAS your word choice.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody was trying to antagonize you by answering your questions.  <br/>
The antagonism comes in the implied insult that people here have it in them <br/>
to have grudges against you, or to try to hurt your feelings, or that they  <br/>
might knowingly give you advice that wouldn&#39;t help you a bit.<br/>
<br/>
If you KNOW you&#39;re overly sensitive to the point that you tell people not to <br/>
tell you you are, then be careful what you choose to share in public.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522261690">Sandra you were a child of an alcoholic.  Try to remember what it felt like when you were small and scared and did not know what to do.  You could not control the situation in the way you are able to now.  You could not control the emotions.  Telling someone to buck up and snap out of it and justify everything you have said or believed rather than simply accept the fact that you have your way and they have theirs is self centered to say the least.  Let it go.  Stop justifying and attacking someone else for standing up for themselves.  You do have a harsh way of putting things some time.  Some people do.  Does not mean you do not have something valuable to add and share.  You have shared your vulnerability here and I have not heard anyone mention to you to get over it or snap out it or so what?  This is a place people come to for support.  You are right now reminding me very much of both of my out of control alcoholic parents and the endless rationalizing they did to continue their abusive behavior.  If someone has asked you to stop a behavior what is the attachment to continuing it?<br/>
Just my 2 cents,<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I am <br/>
<br/>
  just a mom, at her wit&#39;s end, hoping that someone out there has an <br/>

  &quot;answer&quot; that I haven&#39;t already heard. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Had you read everything that people had sent?  Maybe read it again.<br/>
<br/>
  Taking your son to the pool and the park seems not to have been a good idea.  <br/>
  Several people said that independently.  But they DID recommend other places <br/>
  he might like better.<br/>
<br/>
  -=- please don&#39;t inundate me with &quot;you&#39;re too <br/>
<br/>
  sensitive!!&quot; e-mails, I know I just couldn&#39;t handle it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Did you want ideas or did you want massage?<br/>
<br/>
  Massage doesn&#39;t work at ALL well by email, but advice works pretty well if <br/>
  you&#39;re able to accept it.<br/>
<br/>
  Do you really want to help your son or not?<br/>
<br/>
  You got LOTS of good ideas, free.  A counsellor wouldn&#39;t have known those <br/>
  things we sent.  We&#39;re mothers of boys, and we know.<br/>
<br/>
  -=- I really tried to do my best to choose <br/>
<br/>
  words that would not draw unnecessary meanness from strangers.-=-<br/>
<br/>
  The negativity in your post isn&#39;t helpful to this list at all.  If you came <br/>
  here and created a situation in which those who were willing to donate their <br/>
  time and energy to give you ideas you could have begun to use right away, <br/>
  yesterday, could only fail to meet your criteria, you&#39;re not using this list for the <br/>
  purpose it&#39;s intended.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-neither did the blow by blow <br/>
<br/>
  correcting of my letter from Sandra-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
  I wasn&#39;t correcting your letter, I was telling you that if you don&#39;t KNOW <br/>
  what you need, so you can&#39;t judge what&#39;s helpful or not.  If you DO know what you <br/>
  need, you don&#39;t need to ask us.<br/>
<br/>
  Read the suggestions we made if you want to help your son.<br/>
  If you want your son to change to make your life easier. go to a counsellor <br/>
  and get help for your own insecurities.  I&#39;m dead serious.  Your second post <br/>
  sacter flaws or the way I worded my letter.-=-<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think anyone knew or thought anything about your character.<br/>
  The only wording of your letter anyone commented on was where you suggested <br/>
  in advance we wouldn&#39;t be helpful.  Then you came back and made sure we would <br/>
  think we were not only not helpful but that we had been MEAN to you.<br/>
<br/>
  Take some deep breaths, think about your child&#39;s happy future, and maybe you <br/>
  can cheer yourself up by working on cheering him up.  You could both be <br/>
  happier.<br/>
<br/>
  Or you could spend a lot of energy being mad at all of us for our free <br/>
  advice, and make your life unhappier, and meanwhile what is he doing?  Wondering <br/>
  whether his mom is there for him?<br/>
<br/>
  Buck up.  Snap out of it.  Breathe deeply and smile.<br/>

concerned, I just won&#39;t go to you for advice when I&#39;m depressed or <br/>
extra sensitive. I am sorry I offended you. I am going to try not to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734737647">Hi Nadine,<br/>
It sounds to me your son is a natural artist.  I have been a big fan of<br/>
cartooning and I still love animation.  I agree wholeheartedly that art is<br/>
about expression.  How can anyone possibly express what someone else is<br/>
feeling.  We can only express what comes from within.  I have heard other<br/>
artists say the exact same thing and eventually leave art school to pursue<br/>
careers as artists.  I laughed over the comment about teaching how to draw<br/>
trees.  I know that feeling.  Am I doing enough?  Did I do it, say it right?<br/>
Yes, it probably comes from the yardstick mentality of being raised in a<br/>
public school system.  The more I read John Holt the better off I am.  You<br/>
are doing fine.  You (or nature) seems to have taught your son, still young,<br/>
what many artists do not learn until their college years.  In regard to the<br/>
other question about convincing your dear husband.  The best cure for us was<br/>
a year in private school and the results of it being nil and lots of money<br/>
spent.  Now hubby is 100% behind us.  Happy you are a part of always<br/>
learning.  May we continue this journey, happy, joyous and free!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775405303">**Please, send only helpful suggestions. **<br/>
<br/>
To the original poster:  You may be surprised that the sentence above<br/>
created some friction and some firm language about what this list can<br/>
and cannot do.  I&#39;ll share my insight with you and you can consider<br/>
whether it makes sense to you.<br/>
<br/>
My thought is that &quot;please, send only helpful suggestions&quot; is somewhat<br/>
equivalent to saying &quot;please, send only meaningful presents&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
People contribute their time to this list specifically to *help* other<br/>
people.  No one would bother to type in useless or unhelpful<br/>
information.  That is what Ren and Sandra were clarifying in their<br/>
first responses to you.  (Yes, I re-read back to the beginning of the<br/>
thread.)  <br/>
<br/>
People tend to offer advice based on their own experience with their<br/>
own children.  We have very limited knowledge of your life and your<br/>
children, so it is natural and unsurprising if we offer some/many<br/>
ideas that don&#39;t fit your life.  There really is no good way to<br/>
prevent that.  So asking for that, for advice that is appropriate for<br/>
you isn&#39;t realistic.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe you weren&#39;t intending to be insulting.  Nevertheless, even<br/>
with the word &quot;please&quot; included your phrasing leaned more towards<br/>
&quot;demanding&quot; than &quot;asking&quot;, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel that I have misinterpreted the &quot;tone&quot; of your post, then I<br/>
would like you to notice that it is very easy to read the wrong tone<br/>
into someone&#39;s plain text here.  And I would like you to acknowledge<br/>
the possibility that you are misinterpreting Sandra&#39;s tone.  It&#39;s very<br/>
easy to read the wrong emotions into typed text.  Normal clues like<br/>
inflection and facial expression are missing in this medium. <br/>
<br/>
In the first responses that you got, people (including me) asked you<br/>
questions to help them be more helpful in their responses to you. <br/>
Instead of answering these questions, you went after Sandra.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think that was the most constructive path.<br/>

letter and my plea, I felt the need to defend/explain myself. When <br/>
people use all capitals on line or thru e-mails, it is meant as a <br/>
literal shout, so yes, I took offense to that.  If someone can only <br/>
help another by hurting her or him first, is that actually *helping*? <br/>
My plea for only helpful suggestions,  *meaning no mean-spirited <br/>
e-mails* may have been poorly worded and thus easily misconstrued, but <br/>
it was no reason to shout at me.  A simple, &quot;What did you mean by this, <br/>
because it&#39;s offending me&quot; would have sufficed and I would have <br/>
apologized and I would have explained what I meant. I just don&#39;t get <br/>
why, after I have explained the *actual* meaning of that plea how it <br/>
still can be seen as offensive. If someone walked up to me on the <br/>
street and asked for directions, and then said &quot;Please don&#39;t be mean to <br/>
me I&#39;m having a rough day, I just need to know where to go...&quot; I would <br/>
immediately understand that she or he had most likely had a few painful <br/>
run ins with other people that day and I would feel badly for her/his <br/>
pain, because I&#39;ve been there too.  I would not automatically assume <br/>
that she/he saw me as a mean person and take offense to that plea. I <br/>
really would just figure that sometimes this world can be so cruel and <br/>
hurtful, and that this particular stranger was feeling pretty raw from <br/>
all of that senseless meanness to which we have all grown accustomed.   <br/>
I would give her/him the directions as gently and warmly as I could, <br/>
and I&#39;d wish that the world could be a nicer place, that we could all <br/>
just be nicer to each other.  Does this make sense? Does it help to <br/>
somehow remove the offense of my poorly worded plea? Never once did I <br/>
say useless. But I can see how it can be interpreted that way. Since I <br/>
have explained what I actually meant, can we please stop feeling <br/>
offended by it?  ( I&#39;m not being sarcastic)<br/>

&gt;  with the word &quot;please&quot; included your phrasing leaned more towards<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  If you feel that I have misinterpreted the &quot;tone&quot; of your post, then I<br/>
&gt;  would like you to notice that it is very easy to read the wrong tone<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  In the first responses that you got, people (including me) asked you<br/>
&gt;  questions to help them be more helpful in their responses to you.<br/>
&gt;  Instead of answering these questions, you went after Sandra.� I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  think that was the most constructive path.<br/>

few months ago, I had the privilege of watching GaWaNi Pony Boy, a Native<br/>

was available for questions.  Very often, he began his response with &quot;I<br/>
can&#39;t answer that question without seeing the horse.&quot;  He would refuse to<br/>
try to answer specific questions about specific horses, because he simply<br/>
couldn&#39;t.  He wouldn&#39;t try to guess; he&#39;d simply repeat, &quot;I can&#39;t answer<br/>
that.&quot;  Not &quot;won&#39;t.&quot;  Just &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

I appreciated his honesty, and the fact that, by refusing to answer specific<br/>
questions, I had to go back to the horse, think it through myself, and find<br/>
a way to solve the problems.  It&#39;s the most helpful thing he could possibly<br/>
do, and the most truthful.<br/>

Consider this possibility... no one on this list has posted anything to you<br/>
or about you that has been mean, or mean spirited.  Consider instead that<br/>
each and every post has been from each person&#39;s heart, with compassion and<br/>
grace, trying to help you as best they can.  This is a very valid<br/>
possibility.  At the same time, you also had some strong emotional feelings<br/>
come up when you read these emails, and your feelings are valid.  But I<br/>
don&#39;t believe that anyone tried to make you have these feelings.  I really<br/>
do believe that everyone here offers their best from their heart, even if<br/>
they use a lot of words to do so ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would not automatically assume that she/he saw me as a mean person<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like the idea of taking what you wrote in your most recent email (quoted<br/>
above) and turning it around just a little bit.... I don&#39;t automatically<br/>
assume that the person writing the email is being mean, so I won&#39;t take<br/>
offense.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When I felt people were sending stuff that really missed the point of my<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some folks have suggested that what works really well is to take what fits<br/>
and feels right, and then just leave the rest.  I have found the &quot;leave the<br/>
rest&quot; advice to be really helpful.  But even so, over time on this list I<br/>
have found that what once didn&#39;t feel right to me slowly starts to feel<br/>
very right.  Strange how things can change like that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you felt that some emails missed your point or didn&#39;t really offer<br/>
you the advice you were seeking but other emails did give you some ideas...<br/>
then perhaps (IMHO) you don&#39;t need to defend/explain yourself.  If you<br/>
didn&#39;t get one iota from anyone, then maybe a second email w/ different<br/>
wording would help.  It&#39;s nearly impossible to defend/explain w/ email,<br/>
hard enough in real life!!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know what kind of qualities you are talking about here.  But could <br/>
some of them just be behaviors instead, which could be muted or stopped, when <br/>
the possibility of meeting new friends is there?  <br/>
<br/>
I have 3 sons, two of which are grown.  Over the years, at different times of <br/>
each of their lives, I have helped them *not* to do one thing or another that <br/>
most folks might find annoying or off-putting.  I&#39;m thinking of something <br/>
like repeating phrases over and over, or being silly on first meeting.  Two of my <br/>
sons went through a phase where they would plant (usually unwanted) kisses on <br/>
their friend&#39;s cheeks.  Not little kids...they were about 8 or 9 at the time. <br/>
 After a while that can be annoying to the friend.  There are a million <br/>
little things like that which kids pick up or decide to do and these kinds of <br/>
BEHAVIORS can be noticed and helped to go on their merry way.<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons has Tourette Syndrome, and even he controls some of his more <br/>
off-putting tics when he finds it necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Not all of our kids&#39; quirks and actions can be explained away by &quot;that&#39;s just <br/>
who he *is*&quot; with a sigh and a shrug of the shoulders.  If a kid needs to get <br/>
along in the world, it&#39;s right to help him find a way to be more friend-like.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this is a helpful suggestion.<br/>

  I quietly and happily took in all of the &quot;helpful&quot; advice that I<br/>
received, and by helpful, I&#39;ll say it again, I meant not mean. When I<br/>
felt people were sending stuff that really missed the point of my<br/>
letter and my plea, I felt the need to defend/explain myself. ...<br/>
Hi Nadine,<br/>
I&#39;ve been away a lot and busy this month so I&#39;m just catching up now with<br/>
the list.  I read your original post and the last couple of days&#39; but I<br/>
missed most of what came between the two (except, of course what&#39;s been<br/>
quoted).  I&#39;m not sure this will help but your first post tugged at my heart<br/>
and I wanted to share my son&#39;s experience.<br/>
My ds10 is a great kid with lots of interesting and wonderful qualities.  He<br/>
is also intense and has often needed some calming down and negotiating the<br/>
trials of everyday life.<br/>
My son is fortunate to have a whole group of friends whom he loves.<br/>
Although he did attend Sunday school, played on baseball and soccer teams,<br/>
and went to karate for a while, close friendships didn&#39;t develop for him in<br/>
these places.  The place he found people patient enough to get to know him<br/>
and appreciate his many fine qualities was at park day.  I am not suggesting<br/>
there is anything magical about the park but I do think there are a few<br/>
things, which made it possible for him to blossom there.<br/>
First, the unschooling nature of our group ensured that many (not all)<br/>
parents are patient and sympathetic towards children who are experiencing<br/>
intense emotions.  This left me free to try and help him get his needs met<br/>
without feeling self conscious or having the need to explain to everyone why<br/>
I let this big guy cry on my lap if he wanted to.  The kids, maybe b/c they<br/>
were raised in respectful homes themselves, are also, by and large, patient<br/>
and sympathetic.  Kids are expected to let everyone play at our group.  I<br/>
remember at one point thinking our loud that the other kids didn&#39;t want to<br/>
let my son play with them and wondering what I could do to help him fit in.<br/>
That same day, without embarrassing or demeaning anyone, another mom got the<br/>
kids together and gave them a pep talk about the kind of group we all wanted<br/>
to be a part of.  The kids &quot;got it&quot; and encouraged the few who were<br/>
uncomfortable with Trayton to give him another try.  This came up<br/>
beautifully one day when, on the way home from park day, Tray explained to<br/>
me how a new kid was trying to convince the others to ditch him and his<br/>
friends stood up to the boy and said &quot;We like Trayton.  He has good ideas. &quot;<br/>
They explained to the new boy that they wouldn&#39;t be mean to Trayton and<br/>
though they wanted the boy to play, he would have to be nice to everyone.<br/>
These kids were ages 8 to 13 at the time.  I was way impressed.<br/>
The second thing that I think has contributed to our success is time.  Park<br/>
day lasts a good 6 - 8 hours.  Longer in summer when we stay past dark and<br/>
have a camp fire. We hardly ever miss it.   As time has passed, we have also<br/>
gotten together with these same families outside the park.  DD and I attend<br/>
karate together with other homeschooling families and, while he doesn&#39;t wish<br/>
to attend the class, Trayton loves to come along to have uninterrupted time<br/>
with the other homeschoolers who hang out at the studio.  Several families<br/>
go to &quot;dollar taco night &quot; together almost every week and recently we<br/>
convinced several of our gang to join a paks&rec chess class with us so the<br/>
boys could do that together (they came even though most don&#39;t live in our<br/>
town and have to drive a ways.)   Your opportunities, and your sons<br/>
interests will look different from ours but finding a way to allow loads of<br/>
unstructured low key time for them to just &#39;be&#39; seems key.<br/>
Last is something I&#39;ve struggled with, and that is the balance between not<br/>
enough and too much involvement from me.  At first, I was on guard, worrying<br/>
that someone would be mean to him or that he would offend them somehow.  But<br/>
I tried to resist over involvement.  I advised him on matters when he came<br/>
to me, but tried to let him go work out himself how to fit in.  Giving too<br/>
much advice sometimes undermines confidence and of course the ways he came<br/>
up with to relate were much more genuine than if I had helped.  That is not<br/>
to say that I don&#39;t quietly let him know if I sense he is doing something<br/>
that makes people uncomfortable.  Mostly, my involvement has been in<br/>
genuinely liking and getting to know his terrific friends myself, getting<br/>
together with their parents who (surprise!) I also enjoy, and trying to<br/>
engineer opportunities for them to be together.<br/>
Some of you might remember I recently wrote this list for advice on helping<br/>
Trayton out of a case of the blahs.  Partly through responses here, I was<br/>
able to figure out that he had been missing some of this time with his<br/>
friends and craved more.  We focused on that for a while and he&#39;s soooo much<br/>
better.  Anyway, I know this is long but I cannot express to you the<br/>
gratitude I feel towards Trayton&#39;s friends and their awesome parents and I<br/>
wanted you to know, Nadine, that three years ago I would not have expected<br/>
this.  He was such a loner (and not by choice).  I hope you find some of<br/>
this helpful or hopeful on your own and your son&#39;s journey.<br/>
God bless,<br/>
