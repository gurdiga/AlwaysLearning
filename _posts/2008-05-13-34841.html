<div id="ygrps-yiv-998333265">My daughter, 5, has a friend who is about a year younger.  We really <br/>
love to have her over to play.  The problem is that she hates to go <br/>
home.  I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to help her <br/>
get home without a huge meltdown, because it could affect our getting <br/>
to hang out with her.  <br/>
I suggested a treat or a toy or something fun, but her Mom said she <br/>
didn&#39;t want her child to expect something every time they picked her <br/>
up, that when they go to the bank she expects a treat and will have a <br/>
tantrum if she doesn&#39;t get one.  I didn&#39;t have a reply, but I really <br/>
wanted to have one.   I don&#39;t feel like I could say anything like &quot;be <br/>
more fun&quot; without really offending them, and thereby losing our <br/>
friend.  <br/>
This is not an unschooling family, but I wish there were things I could <br/>
say that would help them not be so hard on this little girl.  <br/>
Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936717094">i found that at 4-5 both my kids benefited from &quot;borrowing&quot; something from a friend - it always eased their transition out the door.  would that be a possibility? maybe a shared item between your daughter and this girl?  a stuffed animal or something that each takes turns &quot;caring for&quot; at home when they leave the other&#39;s house?<br/>
<br/>
it sounds like this mother is suffering from the &quot;she needs to learn&quot; syndrome that is so common.  i suffered from it myself for quite a while when my first was that age. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
my daughter at that age was known to hide in closets at her friends houses - as well as hide her friends in HER closet!<br/>

I have a couple of practical suggestions, as we&#39;ve had this problem,  <br/>
too.  Give warnings, like 20 minutes, 15, 10...  don&#39;t make the last  <br/>
fifteen minutes as fun as possible.  Make them clean-up and promise- <br/>
of-next-time times.   Wind it down instead of letting his mom pop in  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my dd was 3 or so, and ds was a baby, we&#39;d walk to the park quite  <br/>
often.  One day, she had a meltdown when it was time to go home.  I  <br/>
told her that, if we couldn&#39;t leave the park, we couldn&#39;t go to the  <br/>
park.  The next day, when she thought we should go, I reminded her  <br/>
that we would need to be able to leave and come home; could she do  <br/>
that?  She said she could, and I, as usual, gave her fair warning when  <br/>
the time to go approached.  She stuck to her word.  I think I had to  <br/>
make the same statement one more time a few days later.  I never did  <br/>
have to punitively tell her we couldn&#39;t go because she&#39;d melted down  <br/>
the last time; I just calmly reminded her of the simple fact that we  <br/>
would have to leave the park to come home eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the ds was another story... &lt;g&gt;  He decided once that it was  <br/>
funny to not get in the car to leave our homeschool park day; he had  <br/>
his schooled (and very strictly parented!) friend with him, too.  He  <br/>
stayed up on the top of the swingset instead of coming with us.  I  <br/>
loaded everyone in the car, started the engine and backed out of the  <br/>
space.  He scrambled down in a hurry.  Mind you, he must have been 12  <br/>
at the time!  His friend was horrified by his behavior.  I just told  <br/>
him the same thing: if we can&#39;t leave the park, we can&#39;t go to the  <br/>
park...<br/>
<br/>
I must have learned from my mom...  She had a technique for getting  <br/>
rowdy kids to settle down in the car.  She&#39;d pull over and stop, turn  <br/>
off the engine, get out her book or her knitting, and wait.  This  <br/>
worked best when we were going somewhere *we* wanted to be, often with  <br/>
friends along, like the beach.  It only took once or twice for us to  <br/>
get it: the car wouldn&#39;t move until we stopped whatever it was.  She  <br/>
was one of those moms who could get us in line with a raised  <br/>
eyebrow ;-)  If we started getting noisy again, the eyebrow and a turn  <br/>
signal was all it took...<br/>
<br/>
Too bad she isn&#39;t as effective with her Pekingnese!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509849942">Thank you for the ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-it sounds like this mother is suffering from the &quot;she needs to <br/>
learn&quot; syndrome-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, that, and maybe thinking her daughter should have the maturity <br/>
of a 30 year old.  I&#39;ve been thinking about that line &quot;We don&#39;t want <br/>
her to expect something every time we pick her up.&quot;  But, she already <br/>
does expect something, doesn&#39;t she?  I&#39;m guessing she expects that <br/>
she&#39;ll be unhappy.  It&#39;s really not so bad when her Mom picks her up, <br/>
much worse when her Dad comes.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=- Give warnings, like 20 minutes, 15, 10... don&#39;t make the last<br/>
fifteen minutes as fun as possible. Make them clean-up and promise-<br/>
of-next-time times. Wind it down instead of letting his mom pop in<br/>
on a fun moment.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I give her the run down of the day a couple of times throughout the <br/>
day, and then as it gets closer I give the time warnings.  We try to <br/>
be outside and waiting and not doing anything in particular.  I like <br/>
the &quot;clean-up and promise-of-next-time times&quot; as it feels like a <br/>
clear signal that this is the end of our day.  <br/>
 <br/>
It actually goes smoothly until she sees her Dad.  So today I thought <br/>
it would work better to pick her up and drop her off.  It worked a <br/>
lot better this way, so we will try to always do that, along with <br/>
some of the other suggestions.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have tried talking to her about what would help, but if I address <br/>
her directly she acts like she is in trouble.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-on tantrums and how we can foster<br/>
them by acting like tantrums and their attendant feelings must be <br/>
avoided-=-<br/>
 <br/>
She doesn&#39;t have the tantrums when she&#39;s around me, it all comes out <br/>
when she sees her Dad.  I think this is part of the problem, I think <br/>
she gets in trouble for being sad that she has to leave her friend.  <br/>
 <br/>
I did tell the Mom that I thought it was more a problem for the <br/>
adults to figure out, rather than the child getting in trouble for <br/>
having strong feelings.  But I feel that I have to be very careful <br/>
what I say so that I don&#39;t offend anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
