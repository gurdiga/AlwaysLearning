&lt;&lt; Sure, you can be an unschooler and Christian...in that order. Just <br/>
kidding. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can be a Holtie and a Christian too.  <br/>
You can be a Christian and a Buddhist, but most Christians don&#39;t know that.<br/>
You can be a Christian and a Democrat, but some would like to tell you you <br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I read in People Magazine, that font of trivia and serious... trivia, that <br/>
when whoever he was (I&#39;m not hiking to the other end of the house to get it), <br/>
the senator who left the Republican party to become an independent, when he <br/>
switched he got many death threats.<br/>
<br/>
DEATH threats.  Over upsetting the balance of the U.S. Congress.  <br/>
Death.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just guessing that they probably came from Republican fundamentalist <br/>
Christians who don&#39;t send their kids to school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a better guess?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d add (or had started with) probably those death threats to a grown man <br/>
exercising his freedoms as an American came from people who are &quot;pro-life&quot; <br/>
(meaning anti-abortion) to the point that they would kill a grown man <br/>
(doctor, senator) to make sure grown women (half the country) don&#39;t have more <br/>
rights to their own bodies.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my guess.  But maybe I&#39;m just prejudiced.<br/>

<br/>
Would you mind elaborating on this or pointing me to info? I was eavesdropping on a couple of people talking about combining Christianity and Buddhism recently and I wondered about it because I thought that Buddhists didn&#39;t have a god, so how could you combine the two? I mean, I know people do whatever they want, but just curious about how it would work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570634729">I have been given refuge in Buddha.  I have a Tibetian<br/>
name.  I was &quot;raised&quot; Episcopalian, I &quot;joined&quot; the<br/>
Methodist church as a youngster.  I have a Tsalagi<br/>
(Cherokee)spiritual lineage.  There is no conflict.<br/>
BUT there is with some others.  A Methodist minister<br/>
refused to Christin Roy....he was an ignorant dork. My<br/>
MIL thought the world of the poor man (why we asked<br/>
his to do it) but I rubbed his fur the wrong way ( I<br/>
told him, when his fiance&#39; laughed and he thought she<br/>
should be subdued, that she &quot;coud mnake a joyfull<br/>
noise&quot; if she wanted). Anyways.... he rufused to do<br/>
the Christening...was a saddness for MIL, but other<br/>
clergy OFFERED.  Only problem I&#39;ve encountered. <br/>
