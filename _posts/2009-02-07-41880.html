<div id="ygrps-yiv-713742374">A big annual event we attend has always had a raffle that was a lot of <br/>
trouble to administer and took way too long to call out prizes etc.  <br/>
This year they introduced a new kind of raffle.  Everyone who bought a <br/>
$10 raffle ticket got a red envelope which contained a prize number, <br/>
which they took to claim their prize.  Everyone was guaranteed to win <br/>
something.  Our kids loved it.<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
