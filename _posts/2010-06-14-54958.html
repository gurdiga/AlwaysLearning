<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611179715">My girls and I communicate through email about once a day. My older two are probably better at spelling and grammar than I, however my youngest is still young yet. Do you all correct your children when you see spelling mistakes, etc.? For example, here&#39;s an email I sent her recently when I saw her use the wrong homophones in her email:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did you know that there are two spellings for here/hear just like there are 3 spellings for their/there/they&#39;re?<br/>
<br/>
H-e-r-e is used like:<br/>
<br/>
Here you go. Here they are.<br/>
<br/>
H-e-a-r has to do what listening. An easy way to remember is that H-E-A-R has the word EAR in it. So if you mean something that has to do with listening, use hear, otherwise, use here :D<br/>
<br/>
Love you!<br/>
Mom&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She responded with &quot;sorry&quot;, which made me feel bad. I responded to her with, &quot;There&#39;s no reason to be sorry! I see adults make the same mistake all the time. Just letting you know :D&quot;... but now I&#39;m questioning if I should have even mentioned it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you all help your children with things like this or do you just let them figure it out for themselves?<br/>

you want your husband responding to your emails with grammar  <br/>
correction? It would feel like -- regardless of whether it&#39;s true or  <br/>
not -- he&#39;s scrutinizing the presentation and not caring about the  <br/>
content.<br/>
<br/>
Trust that she will see lots of correct spelling. Trust that when it&#39;s  <br/>
important to her she will pay attention to spelling. Right now, if you  <br/>
correct her, she&#39;s more likely to write less to you for fear of being  <br/>
corrected.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t usually correct them.<br/>
When they&#39;re working on something for publication, or a letter or  <br/>
resume, they&#39;ll usually run  it by me to proofread, and then I help  <br/>
them.  Or they&#39;ll ask me how to spell something.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is the worst speller of the three, and he&#39;s the one who  <br/>
communicates in written English the most.  My husband didn&#39;t spell  <br/>
well when I met him.  It&#39;s gotten gradually better, and he hardly  <br/>
makes mistakes anymore.  So I figure school or no school, Kirby will  <br/>
be spelling better every year and get good by the time he&#39;s in his  <br/>
40&#39;s. :-)<br/>

again. If she&#39;d responded with, &quot;Oh - that&#39;s cool, thanks for telling <br/>
me,&quot; then that would be your cue to give her more information like that.<br/>
