If there&#39;s a certain topic being studied, such as shading or perspective,  <br/>
they can grade that.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s ridiculous literally, meaning you can ridicule it, but if you took a  <br/>
position teaching art for money, you would be expected to show that people had  <br/>
improved or gained knowledge, and when there&#39;s an instructor who&#39;s expected to <br/>
 gauge others&#39; progress, then that gauge is feedback in the judgment of the  <br/>
instructor.  <br/>

&quot;whatever&quot; all the time or &quot;cool!&quot; whether it&#39;s crap or golden.<br/>
 <br/>

important (and so why are you learning it).   I haven&#39;t seen any  reason to <br/>
change my opinion on that. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
One opinion can&#39;t fit all, in such cases, though.  What&#39;s important to  one <br/>
person might be exactly everything school teaches (because the person&#39;s  <br/>
intelligences are mathematical and verbal, and the person&#39;s personality is  <br/>
conservative and conforming).   Someone whose talents are all musical  and artsy can <br/>
go crazy at school, but the opinion that art and music are vitally  important <br/>
will make no sense to a fullblown athlete without many other  &quot;intelligences&quot; <br/>
(Gardner-style).<br/>
 <br/>
There are still reasons to change your opinion.  You might end up with  grown <br/>
child who becomes a professor or teacher and who will then be required to  <br/>
compare students and rank them.  Or an orchestra conductor who has to  decide <br/>
who&#39;s first chair.  Or a lead engineer who has to decide who&#39;s in  charge of a <br/>
project.  Or the manager of a restaurant who has to decide who  to hire as a <br/>
waiter.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I remain mystified as to why thinks that it is sensible to set up a  <br/>
system where children can get a C or D in a subject and then move right on to  the <br/>
next one subject. <br/>
=-<br/>
 <br/>
The divisions are arbitrary, and it seems the most unfair to the A  students, <br/>
that D students move right on.   But even in the absence of  grades, the <br/>
frustration and unfairness remain.  Every year that teachers  get raises, the <br/>
dimwitted ones make as much more just for having survived  another year as the <br/>
most creative and concerned teachers do.  And the best  teachers will spend some <br/>
of that salary on stuff for the classroom, or on their  own professional <br/>
improvement, making their net personal pay smaller than the  teachers who wouldn&#39;t <br/>
buy a poster for the classroom or a book on how children  learn to save their <br/>
lives.<br/>

&gt;&gt;instructor.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is true, and I mostly don&#39;t agree with its efficacy. A teacher<br/>
should be able to give an experience, to share their expertise, and leave it<br/>
at that. Their supervisor&#39;s judgment of the teacher should come from the<br/>
students&#39; feedback. After all, they are the &quot;customers&quot;. If one is seeking<br/>
to learn a subject and they take a course, they will know what they learned,<br/>
and how effective it was for them.<br/>
<br/>
It certainly is EASIER to reduce a person&#39;s work to a single letter, but I<br/>
think it is much more effective to communicate in more detail about what<br/>
works, what needs work, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m talking about a children&#39;s school situation here, not a specialized<br/>
adult course (though as an adult I would prefer the honest, intelligent<br/>
communication over the grade too :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;People don&#39;t get paid (and students don&#39;t pay) for a person to say<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;whatever&quot; all the time or &quot;cool!&quot; whether it&#39;s crap or golden.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is completely possible to communicate intelligently about a<br/>
person&#39;s work without grading and have it be much more effective than<br/>
&quot;whatever&quot; or &quot;cool&quot;. I agree that a teacher is being employed with the goal<br/>
of the student to learn something, and that can happen through good<br/>
communication.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Or an orchestra conductor who has to  decide<br/>

 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;waiter.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, in real life occupations, people are judged on their abilities and will<br/>
be compared to others in order to make the cut or not. Doing this in the<br/>
false reality of school makes no sense to me (i.e. comparing one child&#39;s<br/>
work with another&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
I also was a teacher from 1986 to 2000 in different capacities and never<br/>
marked a single grade for a student. I find the whole grading system a<br/>
hugely damaging element of public education. Communicating honestly, sharing<br/>
openly, having a sense of community and support, all of these things could<br/>
replace the grading system in a heartbeat, imho.<br/>

The public school system ny daughter was in didn&#39;t give grades at all <br/>
until 6th grade, just narrative, paragraph long assessments on each <br/>
subject.  It is considered one of the best school systems in the <br/>
state by those who care about such things.  Interestingly, they <br/>
switched assessments last year to a more &quot;objective reporting <br/>
system&quot;. The ranking in state assessments has been going down.  I <br/>
wonder if anyone in the school dept. will make the connection?<br/>
<br/>
I took the same college course (an art course) every semester I could <br/>
and loved that the teacher always gave A&#39;s because art was <br/>
subjective.  I turned in a pair of pants that I had drawn on once.  <br/>
It was sculpture to him, as well as to me, and it was so great to <br/>
have my innovation approved of.  I hope my kids won&#39;t need that <br/>
approval for their &quot;innovations&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Having been a teacher, and having been a person who has sometimes resented  <br/>
less thoughtful and less involved projects/co-workers getting the same &quot;reward&quot; <br/>
 as me (pay, approval, whatever), if you drew on your pants at school out of  <br/>
boredom, that wouldn&#39;t be the same as if you chose to spend time decorating <br/>
your  pants.  (&quot;The same&quot; in what way?&quot;  That&#39;s the hard question.  &lt;g&gt;)  Is <br/>
prison art as valuable as similar art made by someone who  had the freedom to <br/>
jump up and go do something else?   Is the carving  kids did on desks as &quot;real&quot; <br/>
as the carving my husband does on wood?<br/>
 <br/>
Holly used to draw on her pants, and did some really cool stuff, so I&#39;m not  <br/>
suggesting all pants-drawing is school-prison art, just discussing what <br/>
&quot;value&quot;  is in the value of grades.<br/>
 <br/>
One reason I didn&#39;t want to teach anymore (there were several) was that the  <br/>
pay scale was such that it didn&#39;t matter how one worked, just so one showed  <br/>
up.  So in effect, all the teachers were &quot;making A&#39;s&quot; (or probably making  C&#39;s) <br/>
regardless of how or whether they taught or inspired.  So motivation  was <br/>
zilch.  More than that, it was to the lazy and burned  out teachers&#39; advantage to <br/>
discourage spark and creativity in other newer  or more energetic teachers.  <br/>
In the same way kids are like to say to kids  at school &quot;That&#39; stupid, why are <br/>
you doing that?&quot; rather than &quot;how cool!&quot;   it&#39;s pretty often the same with <br/>
teachers to other teachers.     The lowest common denominator thinking can ooze <br/>
into all the cracks.  <br/>
 <br/>
So nowadays (past my teaching days) it does seem that test scores are the  <br/>
only goal for the school as a whole (they still need some star students to point <br/>
 at to give parents hope and shame the other kids, but they only need a  <br/>
few).  I&#39;m guessing that there are instances in which creativity has been  <br/>
outright banned and shunned, because it doesn&#39;t produce points on tests within  nine <br/>
months.  <br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s wonderful about unschooling is that in the absence of semesters and  <br/>
schoolyears, it&#39;s just fine if our &quot;results&quot; are fifteen years out, or thirty  <br/>
years out.   There will be moments when my kids are no kids, when  they&#39;re 35 <br/>
and 42 and 50, that something they did, heard or saw in these days  kicks in.  <br/>
And it will be &quot;Cool!&quot; not &quot;DOH! It&#39;s too late now!   Why didn&#39;t I think of <br/>
this when it mattered, so I could earn school-points with  it?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
There were tests done by school reform researchers in the 60&#39;s that showed  <br/>
that in the total absence of grades, kids knew which of the other kids were <br/>
best  and worst at which subject areas. They could rank themselves and each other <br/>
as  well as or probably better than any standardized tests.    In  another <br/>
study (reproducible, but how cruel), teachers were given new classes of  kids <br/>
and false test scores.  Believing these numbers really showed the  kids&#39; <br/>
potential, the teachers paid more attention to the higher-scored kids  (though the <br/>
scores were false) than to the lower scores.  But was it just  purely that, or <br/>
was it that they knew they were being observed as teachers and  were doing what <br/>
they thought the researchers wanted them to do?  And, it  turns out, that WAS <br/>
what the researchers wanted.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s way more complex than it would seem if we talked about it for a  year.<br/>
 <br/>
I was doing show and tell one year with 7th graders (12 years old, give or  <br/>
take, for the benefit of Brits and Holly).  My intent was to give them  chances <br/>
to speak aloud, and to share personal stories or hobbies or  skills.  Some <br/>
did bring something cool, and it was fine if they were really  creative with <br/>
something casual or mundane, like &quot;This chapstick has been in my  coat pocket <br/>
since last year, and I didn&#39;t know where it was...&quot;  but  one incident  <br/>
frustrated lots of people.  A kid who hadn&#39;t  prepared pulled out his ballpoint pen and <br/>
showed us.  Lame.  But two  OTHER kids then did the same thing, and didn&#39;t <br/>
say anything more interesting  than &quot;this is my pen.&quot;  The whole game was over.  <br/>
 How, in such a  situation, can the really sparkly ones be rewarded if the <br/>
only scrip we have for  payment is literally scrip: letters on paper that they <br/>
can cash in elsewhere or  use to get more scrip.<br/>
 <br/>
This doesn&#39;t affect unschoolers except in the further thinking of the  <br/>
parents.  When you think back on your own schooling, try to think of it  from <br/>
others&#39; point of view who were involved too.  When you look at your  kids it&#39;s fine <br/>
to think &quot;They won&#39;t have to mess with grades,&quot; but when they&#39;re  older they <br/>
will mess with SOME form of reward and comparison.  Kirby was  frustrated when <br/>
temporary hires made as much as he made at special events the  store put on.  <br/>
I was crushed when he got a D on a test in the first English  class he took.  <br/>
(He seemed not to be.)<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not just a matter of being competitive.  Even a non-competitive  person <br/>
can being to feel discomfort from the &quot;life&#39;s not fair&quot; factor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree that some systems and situations are set up to equally reward people<br/>
of very different quality of output, and that does suck. Information to our<br/>
kids about this is important as they get older and more involved in society.<br/>
My teens have dealt with this as well.<br/>
<br/>
I liked your example Sandra of the show and tell situation. This is where I<br/>
see honest communication coming in. I think it is effective to tell the kid<br/>
who showed his pen out of his pocket at show and tell, &quot;Looks like you don&#39;t<br/>
have something prepared&quot; and really, nothing else probably needs to be said.<br/>
Everyone in the situation knows the deal, and has a much more positive<br/>
experience with the kid who brought his scrap book from his trip to Turkey.<br/>
He&#39;ll get all kinds of rewarding feedback naturally because he is sharing<br/>
something from his passion or interest.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the natural response of humans to humans is to positively<br/>
respond to things that are genuine and interesting and not respond to the<br/>
mundane so much.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s when we get into systems that continue in the schooling fashion of<br/>
monotony and narrow thinking that we lose out on that enrichment.<br/>
<br/>
Just some more thoughts on the subject,<br/>

<br/>
Yes, that is why I used this example of the college professor.  <br/>
Grades, the pressure of them, the agenda of grades, all <br/>
the &quot;mainstream&quot; attitudes that go with grades mold what students do <br/>
in such a negative way.  To clarify, I felt so free (for teh first <br/>

<br/>
I completely agree with your comparison to teaching, as a former <br/>
teacher myself.  To further clarify why I choose my art course as an <br/>
example, this teacher&#39;s course was openly pooh-poohed by other <br/>
professors as a course kids took to get an &quot;easy A&quot;.  While I am sure <br/>
that happened occasionally, more often it wasn&#39;t the case. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra :<br/>
&quot;When you look at your  kids it&#39;s fine to think &quot;They won&#39;t have to <br/>

-------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
But you were still in school.<br/>
 <br/>
Did you need a college professor to give you an A (and not &quot;a real A,&quot; and  <br/>
you knew that) to feel good about what you drew on your pants?  <br/>
 <br/>
What if you could have felt that thrill of freedom OUTSIDE of your  <br/>
&quot;educational career&quot; to do what you wanted where grades never *were* an  issue?<br/>
 <br/>
Would you have drawn on your pants and still really loved them if you had  <br/>
never shown them as an art project in a class at a university?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-  I think that unschooling gives them real world examples <br/>
of  how comparisons and rewards can be authentic, if not always &quot;fair&quot; <br/>
and  sometimes frustrating.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It also gives them years and miles of freedom instead of memories of a  <br/>
series of 30x40&#39; rooms in which they won or lost, passed or failed, but were to  <br/>
report every day to be judged.  They pretty much choose their own judges,  and <br/>
when the judgment is inevitable, they choose which judges to regard highly  or <br/>
not.<br/>
 <br/>
Another kind of example:<br/>
If everyone here made an apple pie (yes, from scratch, preferably from  <br/>
apples you grew yourself) and we entered them in a fair (something that happens  in <br/>
many parts of the world, and certainly around here all the time, county  and <br/>
state fairs)...   what if someone decided that apple pie was  subjective and <br/>
so every pie entered should get a blue ribbon?<br/>
 <br/>
Each entrant would have some idea which pies were better than hers,  <br/>
prettier, nicer tasting, more &quot;legitimate&quot; (more labor intensive, or more  personally <br/>
raised or more organic or better apples), and an idea about the  relative <br/>
merits and value of a pie made by someone who&#39;s been expert for 20  years, vs. one <br/>
who only made her first pies THIS year, but they are stunningly  remarkable.  <br/>
 So the entrants have already, in their minds, ranked  those pies and are <br/>
probably pretty close to right.  If each has a blue  ribbon, those ribbons aren&#39;t <br/>
worth the cheap acetate on which they&#39;re  printed.<br/>
 <br/>
Judgments and comparisons can be avoided, but they shouldn&#39;t be  negated.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of my ds&#39;s (14) experience with his 4H fair exhibit  <br/>
last year.  We were nearing the end of our first year as a  <br/>
&quot;homeschool 4H club&quot;; he as an officer in the club, and I as a co- <br/>
leader.  We weren&#39;t RU&#39;ing yet and so there was a bit of mild  <br/>
pressure on him to find something, anything to enter in the county  <br/>
fair.  He settled on a delicious black raspberry pie made from the  <br/>
fruit that my great-aunt picked from her property.  This dear older  <br/>
woman, spends countless hours each June, swatting mosquitoes, picking  <br/>
and COUNTING tens of thousands of black raspberries.  She drops a  <br/>
leaf into her receptacle after each 100 raspberries and when she  <br/>
takes them indoors to spread out on newspaper and let the bugs  <br/>
escape, she counts the leaves so that she can report to each lucky  <br/>
recipient, exactly how many raspberries she is gifting to them!   <br/>
Anyway, I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Ds made this delicious black raspberry pie, created a notebook with  <br/>
it&#39;s recipe, nutritional content and tied it in with the nutrition  <br/>
activities we&#39;d done as a club.  On judging day, he received a blue  <br/>
ribbon.  The judge told him that she would&#39;ve recommended that his  <br/>
entry go on to the State Fair if not for the fact that he&#39;d erred in  <br/>
the amount of tapioca he put in and the pie was a bit runny.  &quot;oooh  <br/>
but I like it runny!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, as we looked around, we began to notice that there were  <br/>
countless blue ribbons!  It didn&#39;t take long to figure out that a  <br/>
blue ribbon was easily attained.  All one had to do to get a blue  <br/>
ribbon was follow the few directions for exhibiting in the fair.  It  <br/>
didn&#39;t matter how much effort one put into their exhibit, or the  <br/>
quality of their project , as long as they labeled it properly,  <br/>
answered the three questions everyone had to answer and faced the judge.<br/>
<br/>
Ds, who has never been subjected to grading, quickly soured on the  <br/>
whole experience.  It was a fruitless exercise in his eyes and he has  <br/>
no interest in entering anything in the fair ever again.  Frankly, I  <br/>
don&#39;t blame him. We&#39;re enjoying 4H for the friendships and community  <br/>
service opportunities but competitions are not our goal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to lead our 4H club away from being leader-directed and  <br/>
more towards being an &quot;unschooling&quot; club.  It hasn&#39;t been easy  <br/>
because my co-Leader, who homeschools her 4 children, has been moving  <br/>
towards &quot;schooling&quot; as I&#39;ve been moved towards RU and she insists  <br/>
that her three 4H children take club jobs they&#39;re not interested in,  <br/>
complete projects they have no desire to work on and enter multiple  <br/>
fair exhibits they&#39;d just as soon steer clear of all in the interest  <br/>
of padding their resumes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I could go on for days about the frustrations and  <br/>
complexities of living and playing amongst non-unschoolers but I&#39;ll  <br/>
save that for future posts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is not an accurate representation of &quot;The Danish System,&quot; of <br/>
judging using by 4H, though.<br/>
<br/>
I mean - your particular judges might have been doing that, but it <br/>
isn&#39;t how it should work.<br/>
<br/>
The entries are being judged against a &quot;standard&quot; - not against each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Excellent or Blue: A blue is given to those entries or members who most <br/>
nearly meet the standards established for the particular class or level <br/>
of performance. Excellent does not indicate perfection, but is a wide <br/>
grouping indicating a high degree of achievement toward the elements in <br/>
the standards for the exhibit.<br/>
<br/>
Good or Red: The second or red grouping indicates those exhibits or <br/>
individuals who rank good in relation to the particular standards or <br/>
expected achievement of the class or contest. Either the general level <br/>
of the accomplishment is less than excellent or enough specific <br/>
shortcomings are found to cause the placing to drop from excellent to <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
Fair or White: The white grouping contains those exhibits or <br/>
contestants who upon evaluation are found lacking and rate only <br/>
average, acceptable, or satisfactory rating for the standards <br/>
established.<br/>
<br/>
In the Danish System exhibits are assigned an award based on a <br/>
numerical score for blue, red, and white ribbons. The score blue ribbon <br/>
would be 90-100, red ribbon would be 80-89, white ribbon would be <br/>
70-79, and no award or a participation ribbon for a score of 69 or <br/>
below. When the Modified Danish System is employed individual entries <br/>
or contestants within each group are further ranked in relation to <br/>
their relative standing within each group giving strict adherence to a <br/>
standard of characteristics for a blue, red, or white ribbon that is <br/>
used by the judge.<br/>
<br/>
This system allows for the fact that there are often relatively minor <br/>
differences between entries - so ALL entries of a certain caliber are <br/>
honored.<br/>
<br/>
However, it is possible (and I&#39;ve seen it) that no blue ribbons will be <br/>
awarded in a category in which the judges do not score any entry above <br/>
90 percent. There are specific things judges are looking for - they <br/>
have scoring sheets to work from.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, very often, a gold medal is also given - this is the first <br/>
place winner. There may be a 2nd place, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve judged 4H entries, and it is a HUGE labor-intensive task in which <br/>
each and every entry is carefully examined and scored and we most <br/>
definitely didn&#39;t just give blue ribbons to all entries.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383335970">I&#39;m not writing this to argue with anyone.  I believe you Pam but  <br/>
I&#39;ll be a little more specific about what I found out.  Under the &quot;4H  <br/>
Exhibit Building Division&quot; instructions in our County Fair booklet  <br/>
the 4th item says,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;GOALS: Exhibitor must answer the following questions about the exhibit:<br/>
1) What was your exhibit goal(s)?<br/>
2) How did you go about working toward your goal(s)?<br/>
3) What were the most important things you learned as you worked  <br/>
toward your goal(s)?<br/>
4) What would you like to do in this project area next year?<br/>
<br/>
Failure to attach the responses to these statements will result in a  <br/>
lower ribbon rating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the exhibitor did the above and properly labeled their exhibit  <br/>
they were awarded a blue ribbon regardless of the effort put into   <br/>
the exhibit or answering the questions. Needless to say, my son did  <br/>
not feel that the effort, or lack thereof, that was put into the  <br/>
exhibit nor the quality of the end product was even considered in the  <br/>
ribbon award he received.  Maybe he had a goofy judge but as we sat  <br/>
their waiting for his turn to conference with the judge we saw so  <br/>
many blue ribbons floating about that it seemed meaningless. Every  <br/>
one of our club members that exhibited received at least a blue ribbon.<br/>
<br/>
We did have two club members&#39; exhibits selected for higher awards.   <br/>
One of our youngest members had a  notebook about his dog, for which  <br/>
he received a LOT of assistance from his parents in putting  <br/>
together.  He was awarded a gold ribbon but his age prevented him  <br/>
from being able to enter it in the State Fair.  Another older member  <br/>
had a very well designed and put together notebook about the history  <br/>
and cultural significance of a Sari and illustrated how to wear one.   <br/>
She received a Purple ribbon and got to exhibit in the State Fair.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just don&#39;t get the value in the whole process of grading  <br/>
and ribbon awarding for 4H projects.<br/>

This has been our experience with 4-h as well.  But I do have to say that <br/>
our first contest it SEEMED as though everyone got a blue ribbon.  We were <br/>
expecting to see only one and there were many.  It kind of took us back.<br/>

&gt; used by the judge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This system allows for the fact that there are often relatively minor<br/>
&gt; differences between entries - so ALL entries of a certain caliber are<br/>
&gt; honored.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, it is possible (and I&#39;ve seen it) that no blue ribbons will be<br/>
&gt; awarded in a category in which the judges do not score any entry above<br/>
&gt; 90 percent. There are specific things judges are looking for - they<br/>
&gt; have scoring sheets to work from.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In addition, very often, a gold medal is also given - this is the first<br/>
&gt; place winner. There may be a 2nd place, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve judged 4H entries, and it is a HUGE labor-intensive task in which<br/>
&gt; each and every entry is carefully examined and scored and we most<br/>
&gt; definitely didn&#39;t just give blue ribbons to all entries.<br/>

This has  been our experience with 4-h as well.  But I do have to say that <br/>
our  first contest it SEEMED as though everyone got a blue ribbon.  We were  <br/>
expecting to see only one and there were many.  It kind of took us  back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Boy, I&#39;m glad I read this, and Pam&#39;s explanation.  I really love the  <br/>
exhibits at the state/county fair, but I never understood how there could be so  many <br/>
blue ribbons in the 4H tent!  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

It appears to me that the competition is not against the other entries--but  <br/>
against the standard set.  Perhaps some of the projects are designed just  to <br/>
reap the benefits of going through the *process* and not the end  result.  <br/>
 <br/>
When you think about it, it&#39;s really a great way to judge things.   Every kid <br/>
gets to experience the same project in their own way, and every result  will <br/>
be different, though with common milestones along the way.  (I  understand <br/>
they get lots of choices of projects, too).  Judging  against a standard of <br/>
objectives allows for lots of leeway in the subjective,  and that&#39;s where everyone <br/>
differs anyway.  <br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with EVERYONE getting a blue ribbon.  There are  plenty <br/>
to go around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765079972">Oh, that&#39;s not at all how it&#39;s done in our county.  We have three &quot;layers&quot;<br/>
of judging.<br/>
<br/>
The first is for the Premium ribbons. They get an A (blue), B (red), or C<br/>
(yellow) ribbon based on how they followed the rules, use of creativity,<br/>
etc. Our judges have a criteria sheet with a minimum of 8 areas to evaluate.<br/>
On the form is a place for the judge to make comments and suggestions. The<br/>
goal at this level is to give positive feedback and constructive criticism.<br/>
<br/>
The next level is for Strip Ribbons. This is to place 1st-6th in each class.<br/>
(usually class is determined by age, for example: Creative writing is the<br/>
section, single poem would be the class and each class divided into 3 age<br/>
groups. So all the single poems submitted by 8-11 year olds would be judged<br/>
against each other.<br/>
<br/>
The last level is the placing of Rosettes. Here, we take the strip winners<br/>
from each class, so all the single poems that received strip ribbons will<br/>
now be judged together regardless of age. Then we award 1st-6th rosettes<br/>
with first being Best of Show.<br/>
<br/>
This is a lot of work for our judges and as the superintendent of a couple<br/>
of different areas, I can tell you that we carefully choose judges who will<br/>
put the time into this.<br/>
<br/>
The goal with all of this is that each child for each entry will get some<br/>
feedback.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the midst of getting judges and organizing my department, my kids are<br/>
working on projects and soon our world will revolve around 4-H Fair for a<br/>
few weeks. It is a fantastic experience. My kids try new things each year as<br/>
they look through the Fair book for idea and they work on old stand-bys.<br/>

  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: giving grades<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not writing this to argue with anyone.  I believe you Pam but<br/>
  I&#39;ll be a little more specific about what I found out.  Under the &quot;4H<br/>
  Exhibit Building Division&quot; instructions in our County Fair booklet<br/>
  the 4th item says,<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;GOALS: Exhibitor must answer the following questions about the exhibit:<br/>
  1) What was your exhibit goal(s)?<br/>
  2) How did you go about working toward your goal(s)?<br/>
  3) What were the most important things you learned as you worked<br/>
  toward your goal(s)?<br/>
  4) What would you like to do in this project area next year?<br/>
<br/>
  Failure to attach the responses to these statements will result in a<br/>
  lower ribbon rating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  If the exhibitor did the above and properly labeled their exhibit<br/>
  they were awarded a blue ribbon regardless of the effort put into<br/>
  the exhibit or answering the questions. Needless to say, my son did<br/>
  not feel that the effort, or lack thereof, that was put into the<br/>
  exhibit nor the quality of the end product was even considered in the<br/>
  ribbon award he received.  Maybe he had a goofy judge but as we sat<br/>
  their waiting for his turn to conference with the judge we saw so<br/>
  many blue ribbons floating about that it seemed meaningless. Every<br/>
  one of our club members that exhibited received at least a blue ribbon.<br/>
<br/>
  We did have two club members&#39; exhibits selected for higher awards.<br/>
  One of our youngest members had a  notebook about his dog, for which<br/>
  he received a LOT of assistance from his parents in putting<br/>
  together.  He was awarded a gold ribbon but his age prevented him<br/>
  from being able to enter it in the State Fair.  Another older member<br/>
  had a very well designed and put together notebook about the history<br/>
  and cultural significance of a Sari and illustrated how to wear one.<br/>
  She received a Purple ribbon and got to exhibit in the State Fair.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I just don&#39;t get the value in the whole process of grading<br/>
  and ribbon awarding for 4H projects.<br/>

===========<br/>
 <br/>
So what would have made it &quot;meaningful&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
Would a blue ribbon have made the pie tastier or more nutritious?<br/>
Would a white ribbon have made it turn ashlike?<br/>
 <br/>
When a kid is in in a class and doesn&#39;t learn anything new but gets an  A,<br/>
and another kid in that class was having a good year, really fascinated  with <br/>
the subject matter, heard 30 things he&#39;d never heard and looked up related  <br/>
issues, and learned a TON, and gets a B, what is &quot;meaningful&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I guess I just don&#39;t get the value in the whole process of grading   <br/>
and ribbon awarding for 4H projects.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If you did really get the value in it, then school might not be so bad an  <br/>
option for your child. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The problems grades cause can be (are) duplicated in other arenas in  <br/>
people&#39;s lives.  The main difference is their choice to be there or  not.  But <br/>
philosophically, they still need to be prepared to deal with the  subjective reality <br/>
of ANY judging no matter HOW &quot;fair&quot; the rules have been  tweaked to be.<br/>
 <br/>
I have years and years of experience trying to help people make rules for  <br/>
arts and sciences competitions fairer (local, principality, kingdom level in the <br/>
 SCA), and more years trying to talk them out of having the competitions at  <br/>
all.    It seems there are always people at all stages of desire  and <br/>
understanding for competitions.  In a fixed-size group (or anywhere  where the people <br/>
know who&#39;s also NOT in the competition) you get a larger level  of comparison <br/>
and &quot;value&quot; to prizes and honors and &quot;winner&quot; titles.  I  think we tried every <br/>
possible way on earth.  And some people were happy  each time and others were <br/>
in tears.  <br/>
 <br/>
An aside for those who are in the SCA, in the more specific parlance of  that <br/>
group:  I&#39;ve been a Laurel for over 20 years and Mistress of the  Pelican for <br/>
two or  three years longer than that.  I was a chronicler  and seneschal.  I <br/>
was involved in these rules changes at the publication,  approval, writing, <br/>
critiquing and implementation level.  Then at the  debrief and social-clean-up <br/>
edge again.  It never was worth it to choose an  &quot;arts champion,&quot; and as a <br/>
Laurel I was looking for artists who were doing things  for real uses, not for <br/>
competitions and displays.  And the competitions and  displays themselves are the <br/>
antithesis of what club members should&#39;ve been doing  with time, energy, <br/>
sites and events.<br/>
 <br/>
What helped more than anything--in, during and after all that--was to help  <br/>
people understand that all judging is subjective, nobody (not even them) could  <br/>
BE objective, and that they don&#39;t have to enter.  <br/>
 <br/>
I also designed and saved what seemed to be the fairest judging method I&#39;d  <br/>
ever seen.  It&#39;s here:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There ARE a lot of blue ribbons - most kids who submit something to the <br/>
4H building of a county fair have worked hard on their project and meet <br/>
the standards of a blue ribbon.<br/>
<br/>
(And, yes, they WILL lower your score for not following display <br/>
directions - that&#39;s a big deal - getting the labeling right and all <br/>
that - but that doesn&#39;t mean you GET a blue ribbon for getting it <br/>
right, it means you do NOT get one if you don&#39;t do it right.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not heard of &quot;conferencing with the judge,&quot; either.  About a pie?? <br/>
It sounds like a very small fair - there is no way ours would have time <br/>
to &quot;conference&quot; with anybody - they&#39;d have 50 or 100 or more kids to <br/>
conference with for each of maybe a hundred or more entry categories at <br/>
each age level. Wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Two of my kids have things to enter into the fair this year - both are <br/>
submitting short stories. They really LIKE to have chances to have <br/>
things they&#39;ve produced be on display to the public. Show-offs, I guess <br/>
&lt;g&gt; -- but, when you write something, you want people to read it - I <br/>
mean, that IS the purpose. And the same thing with other projects <br/>
they&#39;ve had in the fair, in the past. It is great fun to go into the <br/>
youth exhibit hall and see their own display there and all the people <br/>
walking around looking.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve gotten blue, red, and white ribbons, in the past, and they <br/>
pretty much all seemed like reasonable results - blue for the projects <br/>
that they did the most work on, red for the ones that they&#39;d worked <br/>
less on, and white for the ones they threw together and didn&#39;t care as <br/>
much about. You have to sign up and say what you&#39;re going to submit, <br/>
months ahead - and sometimes they didn&#39;t have nearly as much interest <br/>
when the time came as they thought they would.<br/>
<br/>
The judges sheets are returned to the kids later - and mine have <br/>
learned from those. They really like the feedback.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;d submit their stuff even if it wasn&#39;t being judged, though. It is <br/>
the FUN of participating in that huge big splendid cornucopia of <br/>
interesting displays that motivates them, not getting a ribbon.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad about a kid never wanting to do it again because OTHER kids got <br/>
blue ribbons, though. That&#39;s a misunderstanding of the point of the <br/>
whole thing, I think. It is putting far too much focus on the judging <br/>
and ribbons and not on the joy and learning itself.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of kids I know do a lot of sewing. They sew because they&#39;re <br/>
loving to learn how - to make their own clothes - to WEAR the things <br/>
they&#39;ve made for themselves or see others wear things they&#39;ve made for <br/>
them. When fair time comes and they choose a couple of things to submit <br/>
for display, I&#39;m sure they hope to score well, but really it is such a <br/>
tiny part of their participation in the whole program, it isn&#39;t a big <br/>
deal at all.<br/>
<br/>
Same for those who grow vegetables and pick some to display. Same for <br/>
those who raise animals. Same for those who learn cake decorating. Same <br/>
for the photography project. The focus of their year is not on winning <br/>
something at the fair - it is on the learning and fun and comradeship <br/>
with others who have similar interests.<br/>
<br/>
The 4H building at the fair is really such a wonderful thing - I LOVE <br/>
seeing all those blue ribbons! It is a sort of big joint celebration of <br/>
all the hard work the kids did all year - and proof that &#39;hard work&#39; <br/>
can be pleasurable and learning IS pleasurable even when it is hard and <br/>
that kids are drawn to learn, they don&#39;t have to be coerced into it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how our county fair compares in size with the rest of  <br/>
the country but I can tell you we&#39;re in Polk County, Iowa -- the  <br/>
largest county in the state.  Something tells me that it&#39;s not a  <br/>
small fair.  Each child spends approximately 3-5 mins. with the judge  <br/>
(there are multiple judges in each department) talking about their  <br/>
project.  We don&#39;t have different age-levels that I&#39;m aware of,  <br/>
except Clover Kids and 4H kids. Clover Kids get just a &quot;participation  <br/>
ribbon&quot; no matter what they do. I think this is dandy.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They&#39;ve gotten blue, red, and white ribbons, in the past, and they<br/>
&gt; pretty much all seemed like reasonable results - blue for the projects<br/>
&gt; that they did the most work on, red for the ones that they&#39;d worked<br/>

&gt; months ahead - and sometimes they didn&#39;t have nearly as much interest<br/>
&gt; when the time came as they thought they would.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m no fair expert but our first experience with our club in which  <br/>
all of our members were first-timers, was very different.  In our  <br/>
county, you have to sign up by July 1 and the fair takes place the  <br/>
third week in July.  Most of our kids put their exhibits together in- <br/>
between those dates.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The judges sheets are returned to the kids later - and mine have<br/>
&gt; learned from those. They really like the feedback.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Ds doesn&#39;t take criticism well, constructive or not.  He really has  <br/>
no interest in a stranger&#39;s opinions of his thoughts, efforts or  <br/>
products and often has very little interest in my criticism.  He  <br/>
realized before he met with the judge that he&#39;d made an error in the  <br/>
amount of tapioca he&#39;d put in and he told the judge.  When she cut  <br/>
into the pie, she commented on it&#39;s runniness as it&#39;s only problem.  <br/>
She gave him strokes for what little effort he did put into it but  <br/>
remember, he was there under pressure from me so whatever she had to  <br/>
say about his project was not important to him.  He thought it was  <br/>
all pretty lame. He was almost ashamed that he got the blue ribbon.   <br/>
He knew that the pie could&#39;ve been better if not for the simple  <br/>
tapioca error. He didn&#39;t think it deserved a blue ribbon. The fact  <br/>
that she gave him a blue ribbon just made him think that it was given  <br/>
freely and without serious consideration of the quality of the product.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They&#39;d submit their stuff even if it wasn&#39;t being judged, though.  <br/>
&gt; It is<br/>
&gt; the FUN of participating in that huge big splendid cornucopia of<br/>
&gt; interesting displays that motivates them, not getting a ribbon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Too bad about a kid never wanting to do it again because OTHER kids  <br/>

&gt; whole thing, I think. It is putting far too much focus on the judging<br/>
&gt; and ribbons and not on the joy and learning itself.<br/>
<br/>
I really did not mean to say that he didn&#39;t want to do it again  <br/>
because OTHER kids got blue ribbons!  He, in fact, was quite proud of  <br/>
the accomplishments of his clubmates. He is probably their biggest  <br/>
cheerleader but he has no interest in participating in that aspect of  <br/>
the fair for himself.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll bake a pie again, mostly because he loves to eat it! &lt;g&gt; He&#39;ll  <br/>
bake a pie again because his family thinks that he bakes really yummy  <br/>
pies and he enjoys our enjoyment of his pies. He won&#39;t ever bake a  <br/>
pie to find out what some &quot;expert&quot; thinks of it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Same for those who grow vegetables and pick some to display. Same for<br/>
&gt; those who raise animals. Same for those who learn cake decorating.  <br/>
&gt; Same<br/>
&gt; for the photography project. The focus of their year is not on winning<br/>
&gt; something at the fair - it is on the learning and fun and comradeship<br/>
&gt; with others who have similar interests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Ds is a pretty strong introvert.  He prefers to spend the majority of  <br/>
his time in quiet solitude reading books, playing RPG video games and  <br/>
designing  new RPG games to play with his few close friends.  He gets  <br/>
great satisfaction from working in the 4H garden raising produce to  <br/>
donate to the local soup kitchens and food pantries. He takes his  <br/>
role as vice-president fairly seriously and gently keeps a couple of  <br/>
the younger members on task during our business meetings. He works  <br/>
hard to contribute &quot;miles&quot; for our club fitness team that is  <br/>
competing in a statewide physical fitness program. He also encourages  <br/>
club members to contribute ideas for recreation activities and give  <br/>
presentations. During the fair he will help &quot;host&quot; the 4H building  <br/>
with his club mates.  He&#39;ll help decorate the club booth.  He&#39;ll even  <br/>
enjoy browsing all of the exhibits.  BUT, he has absolutely no  <br/>
interest in doing 4H &quot;projects&quot; or submitting anything in the fair.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The 4H building at the fair is really such a wonderful thing - I LOVE<br/>
&gt; seeing all those blue ribbons! It is a sort of big joint  <br/>
&gt; celebration of<br/>
&gt; all the hard work the kids did all year - and proof that &#39;hard work&#39;<br/>
&gt; can be pleasurable and learning IS pleasurable even when it is hard  <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; that kids are drawn to learn, they don&#39;t have to be coerced into it.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how it could be rewarding to many people.  It just isn&#39;t  <br/>
for my ds.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not very good at writing clear posts and appreciate this  <br/>
opportunity to clarify my points.<br/>

but,  when you write something, you want people to read it - I <br/>
mean, that IS the  purpose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
 <br/>
When judges read something for the purposes of judging, that&#39;s not the kind  <br/>
of reading I think most writers want.  They&#39;re not reading it because it  <br/>
appealed to them.  They&#39;re reading it because they agreed to be judges and  they <br/>
have to read what&#39;s entered.<br/>
 <br/>
And the statement disregards all the journal writing in the world, much of  <br/>
which is not intended to be read.  When my mom knew she was dying, she  <br/>
destroyed her journals, all but one she wanted my brother to have, so she sealed  it <br/>
up and it&#39;s still sealed up, at my sister&#39;s.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-They&#39;ve gotten blue, red, and white ribbons, in the past, and they  <br/>
pretty much all seemed like reasonable results - blue for the projects  <br/>
that they did the most work on, red for the ones that they&#39;d worked <br/>
less  on, and white for the ones they threw together and didn&#39;t care as <br/>
much  about.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes something thrown together is remarkable.<br/>
Sometimes something someone worked for a long time on is just evidence that  <br/>
they shouldn&#39;t have wasted so much time.  Another of the dozens of  attempted <br/>
and rejected factors for the arts and sciences competitions was a  palceto <br/>
show how many hours a person spent on it.  That was added  specifically because <br/>
someone was hurt/offended because something that took her  120 hours or <br/>
something (blackwork embroidery) didn&#39;t get as high a score as  something she <br/>
considered to be quickie, just a few hours.  <br/>
 <br/>
At some point, though, the time spent goes negative, if the project doesn&#39;t  <br/>
meet other criteria or totally misses the point (which is less likely to <br/>
happen  in 4-H situations than with a supposed-to-be-pre-1600 fair).   <br/>
 <br/>

That&#39;s way healthy.  It&#39;s the kid who ONLY grew corn to enter one  ear, never <br/>
grew corn before, never intends to grown corn again...   <br/>

Ds  doesn&#39;t take criticism well, constructive or not.  He really has   <br/>
no interest in a stranger&#39;s opinions of his thoughts, efforts or   <br/>
products and often has very little interest in my criticism.   He  <br/>
realized before he met with the judge that he&#39;d made an error in  the  <br/>
amount of tapioca he&#39;d put in and he told the  judge. <br/>

===============================<br/>
 <br/>
When I read this, I thought really it was going to change direction after  <br/>
this point:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Ds doesn&#39;t take criticism well, constructive or not.  He really  has  <br/>

 <br/>
Tapioca was nothing at that point.  The real error was a kid who  doesn&#39;t <br/>
like criticism have any REASON to meet with a judge (outside a court of  law).  <br/>
If he had no interest in strangers&#39; opinions, why WHY why on earth  was he <br/>
entering a contest?<br/>
 <br/>
This time it is a real question. <br/>
If you already explained it, please explain this part again as briefly as  <br/>
possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752531936">Yeah, I did explain it but I&#39;ll happily do it again.<br/>
<br/>
Last summer we weren&#39;t RU&#39;ing.  I pressured him to enter SOMETHING in  <br/>
the fair.  It was our club&#39;s first year.  Nobody, not even the other  <br/>
leader nor myself, had any experience in 4H let alone 4H judging for  <br/>
the county fair.  I was a leader and he was an officer. I wanted him  <br/>
to be an example for the other kids (along with the other leader&#39;s  <br/>
officer kids) and give it a try.  I pushed him to do it and he did.   <br/>
I&#39;m sorry I pushed him and he made sure I knew that he gained nothing  <br/>
from the experience except knowing FOR SURE that he&#39;d never want to  <br/>
bother with it again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>By brief I meant distilled.  Distilled into the smallest possible  <br/>
explanation, to the level of principle and priority.<br/>
 <br/>
Telling the whole story (general statement about anyone and anyone&#39;s  general <br/>
stories) isn&#39;t the same as looking at it as objectively as possible and  <br/>
trimming it down to its barest core.  The germ of it.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it was putting the mother&#39;s needs ahead of the child&#39;s.<br/>
If that&#39;s not right, maybe it was belief that learning is external.<br/>
Maybe both. <br/>
But until it&#39;s put that barely, there&#39;s danger of recurrence.<br/>
 <br/>
This isn&#39;t about 4-H or about the original teller of that story, this is  <br/>
about changing beliefs and practices.  And it&#39;s about discussions on lists  like <br/>
this, too, where we&#39;re after analysis in an unschooling light for the  benefit <br/>
of anyone who reads it.<br/>
