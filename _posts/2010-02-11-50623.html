&quot;The Report Card&quot; is a fiction book by Andrew Clements.  It is about a girl named Nora who is in middle school and is exceptionally brilliant.  Nora does not want to let others know because she does not want to be treated or thought of as any different from anyone else.   In fifth grade, her friend Stephen becomes very anxious about grades as do most of the kids.  To help show her friend that grades don&#39;t really reflect what one knows, she purposely gets all D&#39;s on her report card (and one C by accident).  I won&#39;t give away the rest of the story, but it is a good read!  <br/>
<br/>
My 12 yr old daughter asked me to read it and thought I&#39;d like it.  She was right!  I was excited to read it when I noticed that the author thanked Alfie Kohn (in note from author on copyright page)!  Also, the librarian in the book advises Nora that there are always at least two choices to make and to pick the better one.  Reminds me of one of Sandra Dodd&#39;s suggestions on her site!  <br/>

Below is a video link in which Andrew Clements talks about his son in Kindergarten who pretended not to be able to read because of the way his classmate treated him.   <br/>

Well!  Cool!  I&#39;ve been promulgating that idea since 1987, first in  <br/>
the SCA and then in unschooling-world, and I&#39;m surely not the only one  <br/>
who ever &quot;figured it out,&quot; but there is a certain way I&#39;ve been  <br/>
wording it since it started it out as &quot;make the more medieval choice.&quot;  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My nephew Elijah was homeschooled a while, unschooled after being  <br/>
frustrated with the gifted program when he was little. When he went  <br/>
back in 8th or 9th grade, he carefully calculated his class  <br/>
performance to get C&#39;s.  Not B, not D.  C.  It was more work than  <br/>
getting an A. &lt;g&gt;  He wanted to be average.<br/>
<br/>
Just before this, I answered an ancient e-mail or two.  I had mail  <br/>
problems a couple of weeks ago and first all my old mail was gone, and  <br/>
eventually it came back, and then some.  Sorry about that.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to confuse anyone any more than they were already confused. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
