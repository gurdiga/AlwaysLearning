<div id="ygrps-yiv-619841207">Holly would say just before each birthday, for years, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
eight.  I like being seven.&quot;  And so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty sweet, I think, to be content where they are.<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;I wish you could have stayed little forever because your little <br/>
clothes were so cute, and I loved carrying you around, and I loved nursing you <br/>
to sleep.&quot;  Or whatever fantasy stage/age she was pining for.<br/>
<br/>
I never pressed her to grow up, but I sympathized with her wish to stay <br/>
young, and would tell her good things I remembered about being that age too.<br/>
<br/>
Through all, I&#39;ve said, &quot;You might feel different when you&#39;re older,&quot; and <br/>
&quot;You can stay with us as long as you want to,&quot; and &quot;You don&#39;t have to act any <br/>
differently just because you&#39;re ten&quot; (eleven, twelve).<br/>
<br/>
They Do feel the urge to leave, later. <br/>
Having been gone for eight days, when Kirby came back from wherever he had <br/>
been last night, I said &quot;Did you do okay without having a mom for a whole week?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His response was quick and sincere: &quot;It was GREAT!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could&#39;ve expressed hurt feelings, but it didn&#39;t hurt my feelings.  It&#39;s <br/>
good that he got to have a week without me and he didn&#39;t have to move away to get <br/>
it.  He&#39;s eighteen.  Lots of kids his age are away at college, having months <br/>
without mom.  Some are already themselves parents.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s eighteen and getting ready to consider living as an adult, but he&#39;s not <br/>
quite ready yet.  And that&#39;s okay with us.  We&#39;re neither rushing him out the <br/>
door nor holding him down.   Growth is inevitable, and we shouldn&#39;t try to <br/>
manage it because we really can&#39;t.<br/>
