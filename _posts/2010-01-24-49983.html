<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317878174">Hi all you wonderful parents xx<br/>
i&#39;m after some advice on &#39;family&#39; issues . <br/>
<br/>
i come from a very distant family we were all shipped off to boarding school. then as adults if i didn&#39;t drive to visit my folks, i wouldn&#39;t see them ! in 11yrs of living in London my mum came once ! <br/>
<br/>
now i have a son who is 2.3/4 my mum has visited ONCE on my sons 1st b&#39;day. <br/>
i went down to visit for a week (came back after 5 days due to -) my brother (21 yrs  turning 22 in march) calling Teddie (2.3/4yrs) a fu*king twat - because he turned the t.v off. <br/>
he then went on in a very aggressive way that I&#39;m letting him get away with things, and i should have made him turn the t.v back on. . (when my son turned the tv off, we were sitting having birthday cake / tea for my sister) other than my bro who was watching t.v .. as he got more angry, at my lack of &#39;making him turn the tv back on&#39; he said he had also gone into his room and turned a game off - (cant comment, as to if he did or didn&#39;t - if he did it would have been when my mum or sister were keeping an eye on him and i was baking ) and how he cant go in his room as quote &#39;Teddie isnt family&#39; my mum didnt step in .. i went to bed at this point upset nwxt morning i came back home - my mum had gone to work early and hadnt left a note safe trip or thanks for comming to see us - i was on the road at 8.30am .. she had ledft for work befor 7am - doesnt normally get to the office until 9am ! <br/>
<br/>
now im obviously very upset by this and don&#39;t know how to get passed it .. its a long line of negative things im also feeling raw that my family left me for the 3rd year running alone for Xmas - no space for us at my mums house unless we slept under the table, literally. but they wont travel up to me - i have the space. <br/>
on that note as mentioned my mum has never travelled - even when we were kids never took us to see our grandparents and so on , so her not traveling is not new - just i cant get my head around the fact she doesnt want to see her grandson .. (or me) from one year to the next.<br/>
<br/>
im sure this is why i have chosen this parenting path - unschooling yes but also i used a sling , had and have my son in bed with me havnt used a cot - im waiting for him to want to use his own room. every night (after stories and a bedtime kiss/cuddle)he says mama sleep with Teddie - i say yes i come and snuggle in when ive tidied up. he has his own .. <br/>
wandering if anyone can give me some prospective on this family behaviour .. im at the point of cutting all ties with my family - <br/>
many thanks Nicola xx</div>

<br/>
Although I usually recommend people go gradually and not antagonize  <br/>
families, in this case it sounds that your mother&#39;s little boy acted  <br/>
worse than your own did! :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think if you want people to be the way you imagine they should be,  <br/>
rather than accepting them the way they are, it&#39;s your fault and not  <br/>
theirs.  If you&#39;ve known since you were little that your mom didn&#39;t  <br/>
travel and wasn&#39;t very warm, that&#39;s really sad, and isn&#39;t likely to  <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
-=-im sure this is why i have chosen this parenting path - unschooling  <br/>
yes but also i used a sling , had and have my son in bed with me havnt  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve chosen it because you lacked closeness and can recover  <br/>
some of your own special childhood by mothering your child in ways you  <br/>
would like to have been parented.<br/>
<br/>
= every night (after stories and a bedtime kiss/cuddle)he says mama  <br/>
sleep with Teddie - i say yes i come and snuggle in when ive tidied up=<br/>
<br/>
Why not lie down with him instead of tidying up?  Or maybe tidy before  <br/>
you read to him so you can stay there?  He will never be this age  <br/>
again.  You could be cleaning a kitchen fifty years from now, but your  <br/>
baby boy will only be little now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-wandering if anyone can give me some prospective on this family  <br/>
behaviour .. im at the point of cutting all ties with my family - -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t rush into anything.  It&#39;s January.  Spend five or eight months  <br/>
finding ways to be calm and whole without regard to your family.  You  <br/>
and your son are a unit, a team, a partnership, and that&#39;s true  <br/>
regardless of other factors.  Find strength there, and think of other  <br/>
people as more peripheral.<br/>
<br/>
If you put more energy toward being sweet and gentle with your son,  <br/>
thinking of wishing your mother could have been sweeter and gentler,  <br/>
it might heal the little girl memories you have.<br/>
<br/>
Anger won&#39;t help.  It only fills you with anger.<br/>

Also there was a talk Ren Allen and I did about recovering from  <br/>
childhood hurts.  There are notes and a sound file:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think your emotions are saying it&#39;s personal. That if they&#39;d open  <br/>
their eyes long enough to see what they&#39;re missing they&#39;d embrace all  <br/>
of you.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s healthier to accept people for who they are and not take  <br/>
their opinions and actions personally. Something got broken in your  <br/>
parents, probably long before they had kids. Or maybe it&#39;s genetic.  <br/>
Who knows. There are probably 50+ years of building walls to protect  <br/>
them from whatever hurt them (maybe their own parents who sent them  <br/>
away?) No matter how wonderful the tap dancing you do outside their  <br/>
walls, the walls will only come down if they decide they don&#39;t need  <br/>
them any more. (Which is unlikely after all this time.) It&#39;s not  <br/>
about you. You can&#39;t tap dance away what they&#39;re protecting  <br/>
themselves from.<br/>
<br/>
You may have some image you want your family to fill in your life.  <br/>
But is that any more right than parents who picture their children as  <br/>
doctors and are disappointed when they become artists or guitar  <br/>
teachers? Let your family be who they are. If you&#39;re looking for  <br/>
someone to fill a role in your life, explore interests and meet new  <br/>
people. Visit retirement homes and adopt some grandparents who are  <br/>
extroverts and love kids. Your child could have a whole community of  <br/>
grandparents ;-)<br/>

 <br/>
maybe like some people evaluate again each summer if they will home educate<br/>
again come Sept, every so often look at if you&#39;re ready to deal with the<br/>
parent issues again.<br/>
Then if feeling ready and able at that point take baby steps.  That way if<br/>
things start to become to negative for you to feel comfortable with it&#39;s<br/>
easier to take that step back <br/>
and wait until ready again.  <br/>
