<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832493670">I am &quot;Cottonwood Farm&quot;.  A couple weeks ago we contacted a BAD virus that circulated through our address book.  Our computer has been flushed out and no longer has the virus and now we have one heck of a virus protector.  I would never send an attachment so delete the message if it comes with an attachment.  I hope that&#39;s helpful.<br/>

  There is an email from Cottonwood Farm in my inbox waiting to be <br/>
  opened.  How does this virus work?<br/>

their mailbox and copied the subject lines, too.  It didn&#39;t go through <br/>
the list.  It was sent directly from their mailbox.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t open the email.  Simply delete it.  And then run your virus checker.<br/>
