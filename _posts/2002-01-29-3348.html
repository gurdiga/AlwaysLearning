&gt; I noticed that too. Lots of hirsute hubbys. :o) I&#39;m still looking for a <br/>
&gt; photo that actually has me in it to put up, and hubby if he wants it up <br/>
&gt; there. He may prefer to &quot;remain anonymous&quot;. But he also has a beard and <br/>
&gt; long <br/>
&gt; hair. Well at least the hair he has left is long.<br/>

but it just won&#39;t grow.  :-)<br/>
