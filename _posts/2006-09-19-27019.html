<div id="ygrps-yiv-535962418">This is from an e-mail exchange and is brought here not to discuss  <br/>
France; let&#39;s don&#39;t do that.<br/>
This is not about France.  It&#39;s about Iowa or Massachusetts or New  <br/>
York or France or California, or anyplace where reports or  <br/>
inspections might conceivably be required.<br/>
<br/>
First, I want to say that it&#39;s important to be in contact with people  <br/>
from your own area.  Don&#39;t depend on a list like this, that&#39;s  <br/>
intended to discuss how learning works in pure forms, to give you  <br/>
local legal information.  It&#39;s not the purpose of this list.<br/>
<br/>
And as to local laws, those who have unschooled IN YOUR AREA are the  <br/>
ones to ask about how they&#39;ve worded letters of intent (if necessary)  <br/>
and summary reports.  Ask them.<br/>
<br/>
But below is something I wrote this morning that I think might be  <br/>
helpful to someone.  Partly I know this from thinking about it for  <br/>
years.  Partly I know it because of having been a teacher, and  <br/>
knowing that in a creative situation, sometimes the most important  <br/>
lesson doesnt look like a lesson at all.  Partly I know this because  <br/>
of reading and studying the methods called &quot;The Open Classroom,&quot; and  <br/>
having been around through several waves of &quot;teach them the basics&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;teach them to think.&quot;   Unschooling is a &quot;teach them to think&quot;  <br/>
method.  People like to say &quot;It&#39;s not a method,&quot; but in a  <br/>
sophisicated way, it most definitely is.<br/>
<br/>
=========================================================<br/>
So the first part is &quot;anonymous&quot; for this purpose.  Leave it that way.<br/>
The second part is me/Sandra.<br/>
=========================================================<br/>
<br/>
-=-The radical unschooling in France isn&#39;t positive at all. It&#39;s  <br/>
illegal. And<br/>
even if some people would like to let their children free for the  <br/>
learning,<br/>
I don&#39;t know any who don&#39;t limit a thing or another. I talk about this<br/>
unschooling, not only the scholar things.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s illegal here too, in many states *IF* one were to describe it to  <br/>
the state as it&#39;s described on lists, the most ideally free life.   <br/>
The reason a family can do it is because the mom needs to understand  <br/>
the learning that is happening. Sometimes the mom records things that  <br/>
were learned but doesn&#39;t show those charts to the children.   <br/>
Sometimes the mom gets math games or videos or they play with money,  <br/>
or she gets computer games about math if she&#39;s worried that the child  <br/>
hasn&#39;t &quot;done any  math.&quot;    But there ARE ways to enrich a child&#39;s  <br/>
life and call it lessons on a report to the government without  <br/>
letting the child know, and without pressuring him to finish, and  <br/>
without testing him.   Each family needs to figure out how to make it  <br/>
work for that family in that jurisdiction, and sometimes the answer  <br/>
is that it cannot be made to work in its ideal form.<br/>
