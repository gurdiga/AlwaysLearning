<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333574635">&lt;&lt; Yup. And I think they are better for short-term goals. We used a reward <br/>
thingie when the kids were trying to stop sucking their fingers. They wanted <br/>
to use the chart AND they wanted to stop sucking, the latter being essential <br/>
because otherwise no system would work. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is off the topic mostly.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching ninth grade, not long after I had taken a ton of <br/>
psychology classes in the operant conditioning, Skinner days, one of the <br/>
coolest and most popular girls in the school was in my class (she had been <br/>
when she was in 7th grade too, which is part of why she went with this...).<br/>
<br/>
She had an irritating habit which caused teachers and kids alike to bristle.  <br/>
She would click her tongue against the back of her front teeth before she <br/>
said something. <br/>
<br/>
In the full-body dialect of Northern New Mexico, and she being Hispanic, this <br/>
was a kind of insult.  So she basically started each statement with &quot;Oh, SI&quot; <br/>
(only not that verbally), a kind of disdainful &quot;you won&#39;t understand this, <br/>
but...&quot; before each statement.  She did it when she meant to, with feeling, <br/>
but it had stuck itself in her mouth and she didn&#39;t know how to get it out.  <br/>
She would do it just to herself, too, when she was writing or thinking, and <br/>
those probably WERE judgmental--self criticism expressed.<br/>
<br/>
Those who knew her and liked her (and there were lots) knew she didn&#39;t mean <br/>
it to be antagonistic, but those who didn&#39;t like her responded bristly.<br/>
<br/>
So one day when one of the kids was razzing her to stop it, she nearly cried, <br/>
and I said &quot;If you want us to help you stop, I have a way.  We&#39;ll only do it <br/>
if you want to.  We&#39;ll quit if it&#39;s bugging you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bless those other 28 or so kids, they were sweet and helpful.  Every time she <br/>
(I don&#39;t remember her name right now, which is fine; I remember her face and <br/>
voice and hair and sweetness) clicked, each kid and I would click softly <br/>
right after.  No giggling, no even looking at her.  I don&#39;t know whether the <br/>
kids in that English class were doing the reinforcement elsewhere or not, but <br/>
in class, for a week, we clicked when she clicked.  Only by Friday she wasn&#39;t <br/>
clicking.<br/>
<br/>
And no big deal was made by anybody about it.  We didn&#39;t discuss it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
It had never involved either punishment or reward.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still amazed at that many 14 and 15 year olds being that mature and <br/>
matter-of-fact in a school setting.  It could have gone badly, but it was a <br/>
good group and they trusted me and there was good will all around.  <br/>
<br/>
MAYBE if a child has a habit she wants to break (Holly bites her nails and <br/>
when she runs out of nails starts on cuticles), finding a little signal which <br/>
is inobtrusive just to indicate that you see her and she&#39;s doing it, which <br/>
isn&#39;t judgmental, but just &quot;ping&quot; for her benefit might help.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to see conditioning TOTALLY put in the garbage just because some <br/>
people use it roughly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was thinking about Jennifer&#39;s original post. This story Sandra tells <br/>
reminds me of the old stop-smoking teqhnique. Every time you would want a <br/>
cigarette, you were supposed to snap a rubber band that&#39;s around your wrist. <br/>
This associates the urge with a tiny, stingy feeling. Negative association? <br/>
Maybe we should all wear rubberbands. When we&#39;re tempted to yell or be <br/>
grumpy Moms we could give ourselves a little snap. Just a quick reminder <br/>
that the words we are thining of saying could be painful to our others.<br/>
