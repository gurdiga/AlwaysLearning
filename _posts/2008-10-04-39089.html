<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137546227">I know this is old hat to so many of you, but Dave and are  were surprised <br/>
today to realize that it has been a week since we&#39;ve used a  diaper.<br/>
 <br/>
Wyl (9) was not so much potty &quot;trained&quot; as potty &quot;encouraged&quot;.  We brought <br/>
the idea to him, made positive comments when he used the toilet, and  really <br/>
focussed a lot on it right around when he was 4. My mother &quot;annoyingly&quot;  made a <br/>
huge to do about reward stickers at her house and used The Poodle Voice  of <br/>
Parental Approval. Dave and I rolled our eyes at this, but just let it slide.  We <br/>
figured he&#39;d get it and we didn&#39;t want to push it and cause problems. We  <br/>
didn&#39;t realize at the time that we were pushing our agenda-even ever so  <br/>
slightly, but we do now. Wyl still had slip-ups now and then after he was  &quot;mostly <br/>
potty trained&quot; but ended up getting a bladder infection that came to a  head when <br/>
he was at my mother&#39;s house without his parents and had an accident on  her <br/>
(relatively) new couch. She berated him and yelled at him. Yeah, a  <br/>
potty-training 4 year old. He never had an accident after that and I still  wonder how <br/>
much he&#39;s internalized about that incident.<br/>
 <br/>
Storm is 5 1/2 years younger than Wyl (he&#39;ll be turning 4 this  month) and <br/>
we&#39;ve had 5 1/2 years more experience on our unschooling path, so  Storm has <br/>
gotten pretty much the full unschool experience. Except for a  slip here and <br/>
there where Dave or I would mention what he could do if he wasn&#39;t  wearing a <br/>
diaper, we did no &quot;training&quot;. When he started showing an interest in  the toilet <br/>
and other family member&#39;s &quot;goings on&quot;, we answered his questions and  let him <br/>
look. We showed him the &quot;kid potty&quot; we had bought when Wyl was 3 and  left it <br/>
out on the floor where he could look if he wanted, sit on it with the  lid <br/>
closed or open, use it as a table, or ignore it. There was a lot of  ignoring. It <br/>
gathered dust. He enjoyed tearing off toilet paper and dropping it  in the <br/>
toilet and watching it a moment, then flushing. Flushing is pretty fun,  <br/>
apparently! Every once in a while, I&#39;d start getting edgy about &quot;wasting water&quot;  and <br/>
I&#39;d catch myself, *breathe* and relax. He got really interested in putting  the <br/>
end of the roll of toilet paper into the bowl and flushing and watching the  <br/>
ribbon unfurl from the 1000 sheet roll of T.P. and swirl down into that  <br/>
mysterious place where water goes when you flush. I attempted once or twice to  <br/>
explain about frugal paper usage, but ended up saving the last bits of the roll  <br/>
for our dispenser, while the rest of us who used &quot;just what we needed&quot; used the <br/>
 plain roll out of the drawer. That worked really well, and as time has <br/>
passed  and he had the opportunity to use T.P. out in public where there are  <br/>
serrated-edged T.P. cutters, he was very good about taking what he needed, so I  <br/>
increased the amount of what I left on the roll for the dispenser. We really  <br/>
need to find a cutter for ours... it is just too hard to tear it from where its  <br/>
at, all open with no cover. Especially for someone that needs one or two <br/>
hands  to hold himself up on the seat to keep from falling in! He started with a  <br/>
smaller seat that fits on the big seat and used that for a while, but he wants <br/>
 to be like everyone else, so he won&#39;t use it any more.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;d go through phases where he got really interested in going  or being near <br/>
the toilet, then nothing to do with it for a while. Dave and I  knew it would <br/>
come, eventually. We weren&#39;t concerned in the least. He used  toilets a *lot* <br/>
at the Live and Learn conference. Shortly before we left, he got  interested <br/>
in the small potty again-which was fortuitus, since that was our  &quot;bathroom on <br/>
the go&quot; for the trip. He&#39;d get very upset if I hadn&#39;t emptied the  potty in <br/>
what he perceived as the right amount of time. <br/>
 <br/>
When we got back from the conference, and while we healed  from being sick, <br/>
he did a lot of diapers, but once he felt better, he peed  almost exclusively <br/>
in the toilet, though he still used diapers for more solid  matters. This past <br/>
week, we&#39;ve been either requested for &quot;company&quot; in the  bathroom when he&#39;s had <br/>
to go, been &quot;paged&quot; that he needed wiped, or (I have no  idea how he does <br/>
this, but we definitely try to avoid it!) he&#39;ll come downstairs  with his pants <br/>
around his ankles and request help wiping!<br/>
 <br/>
A few times in the learning process, he&#39;s gotten his  pants wet. We&#39;ve not <br/>
made a big deal out of it other than to get him into dry  clothes so he doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to have urine against his skin-just like we would for  a diaper leak. He <br/>
went upstairs by himself the other day and came down with his  shorts and <br/>
underwear in his hand and said very calmly and unconcerned, &quot;These  are wet, Mama. <br/>
I peed on them.&quot; As I set aside the wet ones and got him dry  clothes to put <br/>
on, it occurred to me to ask Dave, &quot;How long has it been since  *you* changed <br/>
a diaper?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, what do you know? It&#39;s been at least a week! It happened  so naturally <br/>
and so much in the rhythm of our daily lives, it wasn&#39;t some  much-heralded <br/>
milestone. I mean it *is*, in a way, but so different from Wyl&#39;s  journey. No <br/>
calling anyone to spread the word for all to know, no Grandmas or  Aunts <br/>
claiming &quot;You&#39;re a BIG boy, NOW.&quot; Just a side note to the day; Wyl found a  new area <br/>
in his video game, Storm isn&#39;t using diapers any more, I got those  too-small <br/>
clothes organized and put away. Just another little nuance in our  lives that <br/>
makes today a bit different from yesterday. The event is that we&#39;re  astounded <br/>
the end of diapers isn&#39;t an event!<br/>
 <br/>
So, I thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
That just bears repeating.   The Poodle Voice of  Parental Approval.   <br/>
I love the capitalization.  It makes it so big and sonorous.  Like  <br/>
the big voice of a dead-serious narrator introducing some  baby- <br/>
talking sing-song communication that expresses much more than the  <br/>
words themselves.<br/>
<br/>
For talking to babies, sweet sing-song mom voices are fine.  It&#39;s sad  <br/>
to hear someone &quot;training&quot; a child not to be a baby by speaking to  <br/>
him as though he were in a graduate seminar.<br/>
<br/>
Balance.  Mindfulness.  Treat them like people, like friends, like  <br/>
guests.<br/>
<br/>
This is very interesting:<br/>

<br/>
How sweet for Storm and your family.<br/>
<br/>
Because it made me think of hand pumps and siphons, but that quite  <br/>
changes the subject, I&#39;m going to post something separately, but it&#39;s  <br/>
inspired by Storm&#39;s transition.<br/>

Yay for your family!  <br/>

Another potty-related success story, more my own parenting success <br/>
than anything:<br/>
<br/>
Will just turned 3 and we&#39;ve been talking a lot about the potty.  He <br/>
does not want to wear diapers, but he doesn&#39;t really like using the <br/>
potty either.  Most of the time, he will run away from me while I am <br/>
changing his diaper and I will feel too tired to chase him and just <br/>
let him run naked.  Next thing I know there&#39;s a puddle on the <br/>
carpet.  This morning I had an AHA! moment.  When I stripped off the <br/>
night diaper, I almost said, &quot;You have two choices:  diaper or <br/>
potty.&quot;  Then I remembered that there are always more choices.  I <br/>
asked him hesitantly if he&#39;d like to pee in the bathtub.  &quot;Yeah!&quot; he <br/>
said excitedly.  I helped him stand on the edge of the tub and aim. I <br/>
let him know he is welcome to pee in the bathtub, the bathroom sink, <br/>
outside in the backyard, in the potty, in a diaper, or someplace else <br/>
if he approves it with me first, just definitely not on the carpet, <br/>
the bed, or the furniture.  For now, I think it will work.  If not, <br/>
I&#39;ll think of more choices.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723027826">I&#39;ll never forget the time, that I had to pick my daughter up at high<br/>
school.  I pulled up in front of the school, and my 3 year old was standing<br/>
on the lawn facing the long row of classroom windows.  We could see the<br/>
curious faces of children looking out. I turned around to get the baby out<br/>
of the carseat.  <br/>
<br/>
I turned back to see the 3 year old peeing in a 4 foot arc perfectly<br/>
parallel to the windows so that the now laughing high school students could<br/>
appreciate the majesty of it all. There was nothing I could do - he peed and<br/>
peed and peed.  I was mortified.<br/>
<br/>
Later my daughter, who has been waiting for us in the office said that her<br/>
classmates told her all about her little brother.<br/>

<br/>
You might mention that it&#39;s a limited-time offer because he&#39;s little,  <br/>
and it&#39;s limited to your house.<br/>
<br/>
Although my husband still occasionally pees in the yard, and if it  <br/>
were legal I&#39;d be interested in putting people-poo in dirt to make  <br/>
garden soil better, there are laws and cultural taboos and he needs  <br/>
to not pee in grandma&#39;s back yard or in someone else&#39;s bathtub.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours really wanted to get her young daughter trained to  <br/>
&quot;go&quot; somewhere besides just the potty, because they were going  <br/>
camping.  So the practiced in the back yard, and it was a go.   Then  <br/>
they visted grandma, and daughter took a dump on the patio.  Ooopsy.<br/>
<br/>
Holly could NOT go in a porta potty when she was little, nor in an  <br/>
outhouse.  We didn&#39;t know.  We were camping in the mountains and she  <br/>
was too little to squat and too afraid to sit on a non-standard non- <br/>
flush toilet.  We had to let her sit on the edge of a salad bowl and  <br/>
then dump it later.  Luckily, we had already eaten the salad.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right!  We have friends who built a straw bale house in the  <br/>
1970s near Glorieta, New Mexico, and they had an indoor composting  <br/>
toilet (it went down to a collection place behind and outside).  And  <br/>
there are some rest areas off the interstate (I don&#39;t remember if  <br/>
they were in New Mexico or where, but somewhere in the SW) with  <br/>
composting toilets.   Neither of those were in cities, though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking more the direct-deposit along the rows that has been  <br/>
traditional in some other parts of the world.  I&#39;m pretty sure if  <br/>
Albuquerque wants dog poop picked up, they&#39;d want people poop picked  <br/>
up too.  Then again, with trees so few and far between along the  <br/>
highways, there are some, uh.... toilets of a sort where when you go  <br/>
behind that one little set of bushes to do your bizness, you see  <br/>
toilet paper and other evidence that you&#39;re not the first who noticed  <br/>
there might not be another place to hide for another 20 miles.    <br/>
Again, not in a city, those spots.<br/>
