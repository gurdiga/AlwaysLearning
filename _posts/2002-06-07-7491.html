<div id="ygrps-yiv-286771775">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve changed my email address, and have been trying to change it on <br/>
my email preferences for this group.  For some reason it isn&#39;t <br/>
working.  As a result, I&#39;m not able to get the emails from the group <br/>
and I&#39;m bouncing mail as well.  Anyone have any suggestions, or any <br/>
idea what&#39;s wrong with yahoogroups?  I tried creating a new yahoo ID, <br/>
thinking that would be simpler than trying to change my email <br/>
preferences, and I got an error message over and over again.  I&#39;ve <br/>
tried emailing yahoo, but haven&#39;t gotten a response.  Can anyone give <br/>
me a clue?  Thanks!<br/>
pax.<br/>

<br/>
Subscribe under the new address and delete the old one (or just unsubscribe <br/>
the old one).  If that doesn&#39;t work, let me know what the new and old ones <br/>
are and what settings you want and I&#39;ll change it.<br/>
