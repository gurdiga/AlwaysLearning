<div id="ygrps-yiv-25170273">I&#39;m still interested, though, in what people have thought needed to be <br/>
&quot;taught&quot; - not necessarily just in school, but homeschoolers, too.<br/>
<br/>
It is really a list of what doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;taught,&quot; of course.  I <br/>
think it is very very useful to take some time to consider all that <br/>
stuff that most people think has to be taught is either learned <br/>
naturally by our unschooled kids or not learned because they never need it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of my bestest buds is a private school principal. We&#39;ve had long discussions about a LOT of things that are taught/not taught and learned/not learned in school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pam, you&#39;ve clarified one of the reasons for teaching algebra (separating the college-worthy from the rest). Now, I disagree that we don&#39;t use algebra on a daily basis: I think we DO, but we just have very little use for algebraic *notation*. I think understanding variables is an important thing we learn in day to day living. Notation? Not so much---it&#39;s importance in our adult lives is highly questionable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But how many of us have a dog? How many of us know much about caring for a dog? How many adults get their first dog ever when they have three kids and a mortgage? Oh, lord, let&#39;s not get into the importance of understanding mortgages and insurance and escrow and points and rates and, and, and---because, really...how many of us will ever own a house? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think school misses the boat on really20serious life concerns---like buying a dog or a car or a house. Chances are good that *most* of us will do ONE of these three things. &lt;G&gt; Maybe all three. &lt;G&gt; One or two of us may even buy that yacht Sandra keeps bringing up! &lt;g&gt; But how well does school prepare us for any of them? Not that I think they *can*---I think buying your first house prepares you to buy your second house. &lt;G&gt; But it seems to me that school would cover a few of those things it they thought them valuable enough!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I dare say that I think they would botch that too, but.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If school&#39;s *goal* is to prepare children for life &quot;in the real world,&quot; why are algebraic notation, capitals of Africa, and the complete works of Shakespeare so damned important?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I once read a quote from a liberal arts college valedictorian who said that his four expensive years in college prepared him *quite* well for a life of a gentleman farmer in the 18th century. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But to Pam&#39;s original question: I think schools (and *society*!) think that *everything* must be TAUGHT. The problem is that they simply don&#39;t understand that LEARNING can&#39;t be taught. <br/>

<br/>
Education goes through waves and fads, and there have been a couple of  <br/>
waves in my lifetime of &quot;teach them to learn,&quot; or &quot;prepare them to  <br/>
learn&quot; or &quot;give them learning tools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The way to teach people to learn is to coach them to use libraries and  <br/>
searches and resources and to read critically and to interpret studies  <br/>
and all that.    To find answers and then to sort good answers from  <br/>
outdated or unfounded answers.<br/>
<br/>
I have helped my children to learn the same way I helped them do other  <br/>
things.   It&#39;s not a big deal for me, but I don&#39;t think &quot;simply don&#39;t  <br/>
understand that learning can&#39;t be taught.&quot;  There are things about  <br/>
learning that people don&#39;t know before they come to unschooling  <br/>
discussions or sites or books.<br/>

OH NO DOUBT!<br/>
<br/>
If they &quot;taught&quot; people how to buy houses, how many adults would then  <br/>
absolutely REFUSE to even consider buying a house, ever, because it  <br/>
reminded them of school and they hated school?  Or would sadly  <br/>
resolve themselves to renting because they didn&#39;t get a good grade in  <br/>
the house-buying course?<br/>
<br/>
And schools do sometimes teach kids to use checkbooks, but in peeking  <br/>
up and out at real young adults, they&#39;re using debit cards and  <br/>
websites, things kids could teach teachers about.<br/>
