<div id="ygrps-yiv-212823603">In response to whether there is hope to help someone<br/>
learn and grow in new directions, I certainly hope so!<br/>
 Ignorance always leaves room for change, because<br/>
ignorance can be cured.  Malformed, misinformed or<br/>
otherwise misbegotten opinions that are based on life<br/>
experience or one sided supporting &quot;research&quot; a person<br/>
has done are harder to change than ignorance.  It can<br/>
be done, but there has to be a willingness on their<br/>
part to enter into dialogue on the subject.  If they<br/>
refuse to really hear you, then you waste your breath.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218227287">Thanks to all of you for your thoughts on the spanking issue.<br/>
<br/>
My brother is the one who asked me for my opinion. (he should have known<br/>
better) I answered and he wrote back.<br/>
He&#39;s been e-mailing me with these kind of &quot;oh yeah, well what about<br/>
this...&quot;  statements and I answer.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like he just doesn&#39;t get it.  He keeps writing and I don&#39;t know<br/>
if it&#39;s because on some level he&#39;s really trying to understand or if, as<br/>
I suspect, he&#39;s just trying to &quot;win&quot; an argument.  That is not to say<br/>
that things have gotten nasty.  Every discussion is quite rational and<br/>
calm.  (mine at least, &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I might have let it go before now but there is a possibility he will be<br/>
getting custody of these children.  I have a picture of them here, and<br/>
when I look at it I think whatever it takes I have to try to make him<br/>
understand.  <br/>
<br/>
So, thanks for your thoughts and if you hear a loud, continuous banging<br/>
sound you&#39;ll know it&#39;s my head on the key board.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in spanking. I  have done it too. But as soon as I knew <br/>
better, I DID better. And never  did it again.<br/>
<br/>
I really think the spanking thing is EASY to  stop.<br/>
<br/>
It may be my first reaction to things (ingrained since  childhood), but <br/>
it takes more than one step/one thought/one motion to GET  there, so I <br/>
can stop myself from actually DOing it.<br/>
<br/>
To spank, you  have to have a hold of the child, raise your hand, and <br/>
swat---and that&#39;s  if everything is *right* there. So somewhere in <br/>
between, I can get a grip  on myself and s-t-o-p. It&#39;s gotten so easy <br/>
over the years, I don&#39;t even  have to think about it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***I spanked very occassionally over the years.  I didn&#39;t believe in  it - <br/>
but-<br/>
 <br/>
The time that comes to mind was when I picked up Trevor ( a screaming  <br/>
toddler at the time) he bit into my shoulder with a huge force --- I  automatically <br/>
swatted his bottom - he let go-<br/>
 <br/>
It truly was a one step step/thought/motion. Years after we discussed it,  <br/>
and I explained to him how it felt to me, and how I thought it was an automatic  <br/>
response.  He understood that.<br/>
 <br/>
My point was that we can recognize what we believe in, and then work to  make <br/>
changes in our behavior to make it agree with the beliefs.<br/>
