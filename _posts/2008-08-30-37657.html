<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270676616"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; A secret supplement I wasn&#39;t to know about, though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This assumption is incorrect regarding my plans and expectations.  As you<br/>
can see in my emails, there was no mention of confidentiality.  It would be<br/>
unreasonable even to expect confidentiality.  Most of the members, including<br/>
you, had not yet been contacted.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The statement...was &quot;As you know...&quot; not &quot;in my opinion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The &quot;As you know...&quot; was referring to active moderation and not to the<br/>
number of rejections.  I can see, though, that I did not make this<br/>
distinction clear in my phrasing.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no problem rephrasing my thoughts to read that some posts which have<br/>
been rejected may be of value to many members.  It is also understood that<br/>
there may be value to many members in *not* allowing such posts, as<br/>
different members value different things.  Therefore, the rejecting of<br/>
certain posts does not result in judgment of this list.  Rather, it is a<br/>
motivation to provide a group where members who do value such posts may see<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then I think you should keep it absolutely separate from existing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>lists and not in reference to them.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do agree that this is a good idea.  The group is now named<br/>
&quot;Unschoolers OK With Labels and Such&quot; (UnschoolersOKWithLabels), and the<br/>
description has been changed to not reference any particular list.<br/>
