Found this in an article under &quot;24/7&quot;  -- I think it has some good ideas.<br/>
<br/>
What is a Strong-Willed Child? Kendra Smiley defines strong-willed children as those who know how they want the world to be run and have no tolerance for anyone who disagrees with their viewpoint. The strong-willed child is very persistent and is willing to take punishment in order to win on any given issue. Because they are gifted in manipulation, strong-willed children are not always overtly defiant. They can be quite subtle, and even charming, in their attempts to control. They are willing to and capable of causing emotional upset in order to gain the upper hand. Strong-willed children don&#39;t necessarily want to control everyone around them. They just don&#39;t want to be controlled by anyone else. Discipline: Calm is Better! Discipline is a key issue when it comes to molding a strong-willed child. Smiley advises setting clear expectations and consequences. When expectations are violated, be sure to be consistent in discipline. According to Smiley, parents who cancel punishments midstream are &quot;short-sighted.&quot; Further, when disciplining strong-willed kids, control your emotions. Don&#39;t discipline in anger. Kendra says, &quot;An out-of-control adult is not effective and is usually counterproductive. When we (as parents) go out of control, the strong-willed child wins the battle.&quot; In fact, Kendra&#39;s son, Aaron, a strong-willed child when growing up, claims that discipline worked best when it was unemotional. Anger in discipline was a sure sign to him that he needed to dig in his own heels. Our goal is to raise our kids to become responsible adults. It&#39;s hard. Parents need to take time to focus, to remind themselves that they are, in fact, the parents. It&#39;s not your calling to be your child&#39;s &quot;friend.&quot; It&#39;s your high calling and privilege to be your child&#39;s parent. With a strong-willed child, choosing battles wisely is important - but so is the corollary: Be sure to win battles you&#39;ve chosen to fight. Smiley believes that moms and dads need to provide a unified front when it comes to parenting strong-willed kids. Some conflict and disagreement when it comes to parenting is normal between parents, but Smiley advises that moms and dads not disagree on parenting issues in front of the strong-willed child. The strong-willed child is very attentive to differences in how Mom and Dad handle parenting issues. As a result, parents who don&#39;t &quot;sing from the same sheet of music&quot; can open themselves up to instances where their child will play one parent off the other in his or her efforts to gain control. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790714036">Oh, and your blog had such lovely pictures from her visit.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh, family can be such assholes.<br/>
<br/>
If my dad or my mom sent such a thing I suppose I&#39;d walk away for a while. <br/>
Maybe I&#39;d write something angry back, but I&#39;d probably never send it. Hmm, <br/>
how often do you see your MIL? Does she think she&#39;s being helpful or is she <br/>
being mean on purpose?<br/>
<br/>
You could pull out the things you agree with like &quot;It&#39;s your high calling <br/>
and privilege to be your child&#39;s parent.&quot; and talk about how wonderful it is <br/>
that you and Dave do &quot;sing from the same sheet.&quot; And then maybe you could <br/>
follow up with the things that are wonderful about being Sorscha&#39;s mom. You <br/>
could say I don&#39;t know what it is you saw that made you feel that Sorscha <br/>
needed her spirit broken (well maybe that is harsh) but that they aren&#39;t <br/>
things that make you feel in the least bit unhappy. You could thank her for <br/>
her concern, but say that it seems the meek child is so much more likely to <br/>
be the raped and abused child that the idea of even shrinking Sorscha that <br/>
little bit is too much. You could respond with lots of stuff from Sandra&#39;s <br/>
and Joyce&#39;s site, reams and reams of webpages, so that she can see how much <br/>
you aren&#39;t struggling in darkness.<br/>
<br/>
My dad once sent an e-mail that I took as very negative. I wrote a really <br/>
point on point response to him which I never sent. In the end I commented on <br/>
some small thing he&#39;d said in the whole thing and ignored his negative <br/>
comments. And it didn&#39;t come up again. He was easily distracted. My mom once <br/>
wrote me about how she&#39;d happily told her hairdresser to kick his son out of <br/>
the house, and I told her, very angrily, to be careful of the advice she <br/>
gives. I told her of how when she and my dad kicked me out of the house I <br/>
had been nearly raped and how many nights I spent sleeping in the back of <br/>
friends cars or sneaking in their windows at night so their parents wouldn&#39;t <br/>
know. She said she never knew it had been so rough for me, I don&#39;t know what <br/>
she told her hairdresser. I suppose you have to figure out how sensitive <br/>
your MIL would be to a negative response. Maybe you could just ignore it? I <br/>
always find that the hardest thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Hope something there helps,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you should either ignore it, or respond &quot;Hmmm...that was <br/>
interesting.&quot; It will drive her crazy. <br/>
<br/>
My ex-MIL and I got into a huge email battle/argument a couple of <br/>
years ago about her undermining my parenting choices when my son <br/>
would go visit his father (she would tell him how he wouldnt learn <br/>
anything by unschooling, he needed to be in school, he was behind, <br/>
etc etc)...i addressed each of her emails point by point. I didnt <br/>
think i was being rude or mean, but it didnt matter, because that is <br/>
how she took my emails. She decided we werent speaking (yay for me! <br/>
solved all my problems right there!)and we don&#39;t. She did email me a <br/>
fairly delusional email before Thanksgiving because my son did not <br/>
want to go down there to visit his father, and i supported his <br/>
choice. I didnt respond, because i knew no matter *what* i said, it <br/>
wouldnt change her view of the situation. I knew it would drive her <br/>
nuts not knowing if i read it.<br/>
<br/>
So, if i were you, unless you really think your MIL is open to <br/>
learning new things, i would not invest too much emotional energy in <br/>
trying to convince her of anything.<br/>

<br/>
I know!  I really thought that maybe she was coming around just a <br/>
little bit.  I felt like she was slightly embracing the moments by <br/>
playing video games and then even soccer in the house no less.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hmm, how often do you see your MIL? Does she think she&#39;s being <br/>
helpful or is she being mean on purpose?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is becomming less & less since we moved.  She comes about 3 times <br/>
per year for 5 days at a time.  The last visit did not go well and <br/>
Sorscha refused to speak to her for a few months.  I don&#39;t know if <br/>
she is being mean on purpose or not.  I know that she knows we feel <br/>
very strong about RUing so when I received &#39;strong willed&#39; it really <br/>
took me by surprise.  She has become very negative over the last <br/>
year.  Dave and I think that she is upset because she was looking <br/>
forward to retiring but her husband cannot.  She seems to be getting <br/>
very bitter and judgemental.  She has also embraced a new religion in <br/>
which now her perspective has become very different then ours.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe all of that is popping over to us?  I really don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You could respond with lots of stuff from Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s <br/>
site, reams and reams of webpages, so that she can see how much <br/>
you aren&#39;t struggling in darkness.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I sent & sent links via email when she requested info one time. Dave <br/>
and I also made her a book where we printed out a ton of info about <br/>
RUing in hopes that by having it in a book format it would be easier <br/>
for her to get to.  I&#39;m really do not think that she has read any of <br/>
it.  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I told her of how when she and my dad kicked me out of the house I <br/>
had been nearly raped and how many nights I spent sleeping in the <br/>
back of friends cars or sneaking in their windows at night so their <br/>
parents wouldn&#39;t know. She said she never knew it had been so rough <br/>
for me&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that you were not raped.  I too spent many nights sleeping <br/>
in my car behind grocery stores, etc. when I was a teen.  It was not <br/>
a good thing.  Well, it was better than being in the home I was in. I <br/>
never want that for Sorscha. <br/>

Thanks,<br/>

Yes, that is why I have not responded to her.  I also knew that I <br/>

Hmmm, I don&#39;t think that she will bager us about the same &#39;strong <br/>
willed&#39; email but I do notice that we are receiving more and more <br/>
comments.  I know that we have years to go with this lifestyle so we <br/>
are thinking that maybe responding once and for all that we would <br/>
only appreciate positive comments might be the way to go.  However, <br/>
then we are trying to control her and I am sure that is not going to <br/>
get us anywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does she have the link to your blog? Maybe reading about your <br/>
daughters day to day life will help her understand?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes she has the link but told Dave that she does not read it because <br/>
she feels that it is impersonable.  WOW, when I am putting this in <br/>
writing it is coming across really bad.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What does your husband think? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s about done. He has been &#39;handling&#39; her for over a year now.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I will actually ask him right now. He says, &quot;I think that it is <br/>
too bad my mom just doesn&#39;t get it. To me it is not worth the effort <br/>
to get her on board because she&#39;ll never get it.  Look at the whole <br/>
relationship with my sister.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, maybe I&#39;m (Crystal) trying to salvage a relationship with a <br/>
mother figure because I don&#39;t have one.  Maybe I need to &#39;get it&#39; and <br/>
stop trying to work on it if he does not want to. <br/>
<br/>
Oh and the sister comment is because Dave&#39;s sister was molested by <br/>
the step dad and MIL still refuses to believe it ever happened even <br/>
though there was proof. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, what did she mean with the &quot;mutual respect&quot; comment? That <br/>
your daughter has no respect for you?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
MIL feels that Sorscha tries to manipulate us and does not respect <br/>
us. <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, great info coming across that is making us (Dave is here with <br/>
me reading these)think about everything. <br/>

You know you might be right.  Yes, I truly know that we can not <br/>
convince her about RUing. <br/>
<br/>
Dave is sitting here and asked if I remembered that she said to us <br/>
during her last visit a month ago...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It all sounds good in theory but it is not practical.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I guess that just might say it all.  Dave just said, &quot;You can lead <br/>
a horse to water but you can&#39;t make him (MIL) drink.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How come he gets it????<br/>

raised Dave?  Is she taking it personally that *she* was never accepted for who<br/>
she is and thereby was unable to do that for her own children?? (and possibly<br/>
she sees your difference as a rejection of her mothering thereby a rejection of<br/>
herself)<br/>
I know that my MIL&#39;s issues with me stem from raising my own *spirited* (in a<br/>
positive sense) son who is VERY much like *her* spirited son in a totally<br/>
different manner.  <br/>
She spanked Mitch and he was an angry kid who grew up to be an angry adult, who<br/>
eventually came around and decided that was exactly what he didn&#39;t want for his<br/>
own kids.  I&#39;m not going down that path.  I refuse.  If Mitch turned out okay in<br/>
the end anyway, I&#39;m expecting her to have the exact same faith in Hayden --<br/>
he&#39;ll turn out okay in the end (whatever the heck that means anyway).  <br/>
It somehow becomes a competition where it doesn&#39;t have to.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218631843">Keith&#39;s mom used to make snarky comments when Kirby was six and seven  <br/>
and eight.  He and Marty have cousins about the same age, being  <br/>
raised dress-up-and-go-to-church-against-your-will in South  <br/>
Carolina.  The parents separated but didn&#39;t divorce.  Keith and I  <br/>
stayed together and got along.  Their kids (sadly, I&#39;m not glad of it  <br/>
except for the comparison) stopped having much chance of happiness,  <br/>
and were pretty much criticized and tormented by both their parents,  <br/>
in turn.   Meanwhile, our kids were sweet and interesting and helpful  <br/>
and would go and visit the grandparents cheerfully.<br/>

<br/>
Because he feels the goodness of it in everyday ways.<br/>
Because it&#39;s not a threat to him.<br/>
<br/>
If what you do works, it will mean that what his mom did was  <br/>
unnecessary (and maybe harmful) and it&#39;s got to be difficult for her  <br/>
to consider that, so try not to rub her nose in it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the nicest thing you could do would be to say &quot;If it starts to  <br/>
seem this isn&#39;t working, we&#39;ll adjust what we&#39;re doing.&quot;  That will  <br/>
give her hope without being dishonest, won&#39;t it?  Isn&#39;t that fair?<br/>

send but it felt good to get it out...then delete.  It is hard, at <br/>

Hi.  <br/>
<br/>
Interesting article, thanks for sending.  You know that we are always <br/>
seeking knowledge.  We read the article and also looked into the <br/>
author and her book.  In doing so we found that her beliefs regarding <br/>
parenting are completely different than ours. However, we do <br/>
appreciate your concern for Sorscha&#39;s well-being.  <br/>
<br/>
Talk to you soon.<br/>

&gt; What is a Strong-Willed Child? Kendra Smiley defines strong-willed <br/>
 </span></blockquote>children as those who know how they want the world to be run and have <br/>
no tolerance for anyone who disagrees with their viewpoint. The <br/>
strong-willed child is very persistent and is willing to take <br/>
punishment in order to win on any given issue. Because they are <br/>
gifted in manipulation, strong-willed children are not always overtly <br/>
defiant. They can be quite subtle, and even charming, in their <br/>
attempts to control. They are willing to and capable of causing <br/>
emotional upset in order to gain the upper hand. Strong-willed <br/>
children don&#39;t necessarily want to control everyone around them. They <br/>
just don&#39;t want to be controlled by anyone else. Discipline: Calm is <br/>
Better! Discipline is a key issue when it comes to molding a strong-<br/>
willed child. Smiley advises setting clear expectations and <br/>
consequences. When expectations are violated, be sure to be <br/>
consistent in discipline. According to Smiley, parents who cancel <br/>
punishments midstream are &quot;short-sighted.&quot; Further, when disciplining <br/>
strong-willed kids, control your emotions. Don&#39;t discipline in anger. <br/>
Kendra says, &quot;An out-of-control adult is not effective and is usually <br/>
counterproductive. When we (as parents) go out of control, the strong-<br/>
willed child wins the battle.&quot; In fact, Kendra&#39;s son, Aaron, a strong-<br/>
willed child when growing up, claims that discipline worked best when <br/>
it was unemotional. Anger in discipline was a sure sign to him that <br/>
he needed to dig in his own heels. Our goal is to raise our kids to <br/>
become responsible adults. It&#39;s hard. Parents need to take time to <br/>
focus, to remind themselves that they are, in fact, the parents. It&#39;s <br/>
not your calling to be your child&#39;s &quot;friend.&quot; It&#39;s your high calling <br/>
and privilege to be your child&#39;s parent. With a strong-willed child, <br/>
choosing battles wisely is important - but so is the corollary: Be <br/>
sure to win battles you&#39;ve chosen to fight. Smiley believes that moms <br/>
and dads need to provide a unified front when it comes to parenting <br/>
strong-willed kids. Some conflict and disagreement when it comes to <br/>
parenting is normal between parents, but Smiley advises that moms and <br/>
dads not disagree on parenting issues in front of the strong-willed <br/>
child. The strong-willed child is very attentive to differences in <br/>
how Mom and Dad handle parenting issues. As a result, parents who <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;sing from the same sheet of music&quot; can open themselves up to <br/>
instances where their child will play one parent off the other in his <br/>
or her efforts to gain control. <br/>
