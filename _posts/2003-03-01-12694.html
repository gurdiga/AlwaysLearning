<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And the woman posting it was basically saying that none of &quot;our&quot; children<br/>
&gt; would dare try to express themselves, or even think they have rights.  And<br/>
&gt; the thought of a mother squashing those rights is cool.  Remember I live in<br/>
&gt; the Bible Belt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So against my grain Maybe I should just sit on it for a day and see if I<br/>
&gt; still have the same gut reaction tomorrow.  I know what I would say just<br/>
&gt; wondering if I should say it or let it pass?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it possible that you write back and ask if this is just a joke?  Tell<br/>
them you don&#39;t find it particuly funny, and it bothers you that the author<br/>
would write such a thing that is so disrespectful to both child and parent.<br/>
That way, you question the motive, blame the author not the person who sent<br/>
it, and note that you suspected it was a joke, if a somewhat sick one.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to avoid the discussion entirely, maybe you could just send<br/>
something that notes that since everyone has different tastes in humor,<br/>
perhaps this list should stick to its purpose of information dissemination.<br/>

that play group the reason being is that there are kids of all ages there <br/>
from 2 up to 17.  The other play group we are in the children are younger <br/>
from 4 to 8.  My 8 year old being one of 2 that are older than 6.<br/>
I do think I will respond though, will post what I respond with.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Just like a garden left to grow weeds, children , if left to themselves will<br/>
&gt; produce evil&quot; I still haven&#39;t decided what to say to that! I was amazed, as he<br/>
&gt; has always seemed so sensible! Is it even worth talking to these people? And<br/>
&gt; is this attitude a general christian thing or what?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, &quot;general Christian&quot; doesn&#39;t exist, so far as I&#39;ve ever been able to<br/>
find.  We all (all Christians, I mean) believe in God and follow Christ.<br/>
And the road forks about two millimenters later.  Christianity has so many<br/>
denominations because of this problem -- we all believe different things.<br/>
<br/>
However, while I don&#39;t share the writer&#39;s opinion, I can probably give you<br/>
at least a basic insight about its source.  There is a long-standing idea in<br/>
Christianity called &quot;original sin&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is that Adam and Eve were created perfect, but fell into sin with<br/>
that whole mess in the garden.  (Genesis 3, if you really feel like reading<br/>
the story.)  Because of their sin, everyone since has been born sinful, is<br/>
how the idea goes.  So the writer is quoting Proverbs (I think), which<br/>
builds on the idea that we&#39;re all sinful until it&#39;s trained out of us,<br/>
therefore children are evil if left to their own devices.<br/>
<br/>
An awful lot of Christians truly believe that as part of their personal<br/>
theology, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth trying to talk them out of it.  To<br/>
them, it&#39;s perfectly sensible.  If it&#39;s any reassurance, there are plenty of<br/>
Christians out there that think original sin is a pretty lame idea!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not too Christian for this heathen.  &lt;g&gt;  I tend to refer to capital c<br/>
Christians and small c Christians.  The ones I call capital c Christians are<br/>
the ones who are in your face with it all the time, the ones who<br/>
deliberately drop little clues for the other Christians to pick up and know<br/>
them by.  The small c Christians are the ones who simply live their faith,<br/>
without being in your face about it.  &quot;By their fruits ye shall know them.&quot;<br/>

My son came home from school one day,<br/>

that&#39;s taught by Mr. Wright?<br/>
It&#39;s all about the laws today<br/>
The &quot;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It says I can choose to clean my room,<br/>
or even cut my hair.<br/>
No one can tell me what to learn,<br/>
or speak or think or wear.<br/>
<br/>
I have freedom of religion,<br/>
and regardless what some say,<br/>
I don&#39;t have to bow my head,<br/>
or even have to pray.<br/>
<br/>
I can wear earrings if I choose,<br/>
and pierce my tongue and nose.<br/>
I can read and watch just what I like,<br/>
and get tattoos from head to toes.<br/>
<br/>
No one can ever touch me,<br/>
my body&#39;s for my use,<br/>
but maybe hugs and kisses,<br/>
if that is what I choose.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t preach about your morals,<br/>
like your Mama did to you.<br/>
For I can see your morals<br/>
in what you say and do.<br/>
<br/>
Mom, I have these children&#39;s rights,<br/>
and you have rights too.<br/>
So treat me with respect and love,<br/>
I&#39;ll do the same to you.<br/>
<br/>
Of course my first instinct was<br/>
to toss him out the door.<br/>
But the chance to see him live his life<br/>
made me think a little more.<br/>
<br/>
I mulled it over carefully,<br/>
I couldn&#39;t let it go.<br/>
I&#39;ll take him out of school I thought.<br/>
We&#39;ll see what else will flow.<br/>
<br/>
The first week was a shocker<br/>
for all he wanted was TV.<br/>
But I waited patiently<br/>
for curiosity to spring free.<br/>
<br/>
We went shopping for some books <br/>
at the local Goodwill store.<br/>
We read those books together.<br/>
There were tears and laughs galore.<br/>
<br/>
And back we went to that Goodwill.<br/>
We found a few books more.<br/>
Scraped together all out change <br/>
and talked about help for the poor.<br/>
<br/>
I have my religion, <br/>
but I know not all believe<br/>
in my one God and Jesus,<br/>
as the One to set you free.<br/>
<br/>
So I can help my son along,<br/>
in exploring his spiritual self.<br/>
Help him find what&#39;s right for him,<br/>
maybe more than a book on a shelf.<br/>
<br/>
He still loves TV and videos.<br/>
I watch too so we can talk.<br/>
The best way for me to influence my son,<br/>
is for him to watch the path I walk.<br/>
<br/>
There are many paths this life may offer,<br/>
I can&#39;t pick the one he takes.<br/>
I have to trust my son&#39;s decisions.<br/>
That&#39;s the best choice I can make.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take a walk today my son,<br/>
the world is big and wide.<br/>
I know that learning is everywhere<br/>
and we&#39;ll do it side by side.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; My son came home from school one day,<br/>
&gt; with a smile upon his face.<br/>
&gt; He decided he had learned enough,<br/>
&gt; and presented me his case.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Guess what I learned in Civics Two,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s taught by Mr. Wright?<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s all about the laws today<br/>
&gt; The &quot;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It says I can choose to clean my room,<br/>
&gt; or even cut my hair.<br/>
&gt; No one can tell me what to learn,<br/>
&gt; or speak or think or wear.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have freedom of religion,<br/>
&gt; and regardless what some say,<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have to bow my head,<br/>
&gt; or even have to pray.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can wear earrings if I choose,<br/>
&gt; and pierce my tongue and nose.<br/>
&gt; I can read and watch just what I like,<br/>
&gt; and get tattoos from head to toes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No one can ever touch me,<br/>
&gt; my body&#39;s for my use,<br/>
&gt; but maybe hugs and kisses,<br/>
&gt; if that is what I choose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t preach about your morals,<br/>
&gt; like your Mama did to you.<br/>
&gt; For I can see your morals<br/>
&gt; in what you say and do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mom, I have these children&#39;s rights,<br/>
&gt; and you have rights too.<br/>
&gt; So treat me with respect and love,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll do the same to you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course my first instinct was<br/>
&gt; to toss him out the door.<br/>
&gt; But the chance to see him live his life<br/>
&gt; made me think a little more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mulled it over carefully,<br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t let it go.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll take him out of school I thought.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ll see what else will flow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first week was a shocker<br/>
&gt; for all he wanted was TV.<br/>
&gt; But I waited patiently<br/>
&gt; for curiosity to spring free.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went shopping for some books<br/>
&gt; at the local Goodwill store.<br/>
&gt; We read those books together.<br/>
&gt; There were tears and laughs galore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And back we went to that Goodwill.<br/>
&gt; We found a few books more.<br/>
&gt; Scraped together all out change<br/>
&gt; and talked about help for the poor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have my religion,<br/>
&gt; but I know not all believe<br/>
&gt; in my one God and Jesus,<br/>
&gt; as the One to set you free.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I can help my son along,<br/>
&gt; in exploring his spiritual self.<br/>
&gt; Help him find what&#39;s right for him,<br/>
&gt; maybe more than a book on a shelf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He still loves TV and videos.<br/>
&gt; I watch too so we can talk.<br/>
&gt; The best way for me to influence my son,<br/>
&gt; is for him to watch the path I walk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are many paths this life may offer,<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t pick the one he takes.<br/>
&gt; I have to trust my son&#39;s decisions.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s the best choice I can make.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s take a walk today my son,<br/>
&gt; the world is big and wide.<br/>
&gt; I know that learning is everywhere<br/>
&gt; and we&#39;ll do it side by side. </span></blockquote></div>

That was a very clever response, Pam G.<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering - what kind of feedback you&#39;re getting about your new and<br/>
improved version?<br/>
It seems that the person who sent it and everyone who laughed along with it,<br/>
should be ashamed of themselves!<br/>
You put them in their place - I hope it makes them think twice about<br/>
trivializing the relationship between parents and children.<br/>
Good for you!<br/>

quiet unless someone is organizing an activity or something, or the <br/>
occasional Bible verse (delete-delete).  Why do people send those?  I guess I <br/>
figure I can read and I have several Bibles my homeschool support group isn&#39;t <br/>
where I turn for spiritual needs.  Anyway.  We&#39;ll see how it goes.  There is <br/>
a play group next Friday.  LOL<br/>
