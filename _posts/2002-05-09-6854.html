<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102279080">&lt;&lt;So why do I unschool?  Why are my kids so important to<br/>
me?  I think these are things that I came to<br/>
unconsciously as a child and I could never concieve of<br/>
being any other way.  Certainly I could never be what<br/>
my parents were to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there is so much to be learned about people, genetics and why we<br/>
are the way we are.  My father and his brother were severely beaten<br/>
throughout their childhood by an alcoholic father.  My uncle followed in<br/>
his dad&#39;s footsteps while my dad drank very little and swore off spanking<br/>
after doing it only once.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that nurture can have a huge impact on one&#39;s nature but the<br/>
evidence on genetics seems pretty compelling.  Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we<br/>
could back up time and REraise a person in a loving unschool home to see<br/>
what difference it made?<br/>
