<div id="ygrps-yiv-62034206">Relations between my nephew and his parents has gone way down hill to  <br/>
the point where he&#39;s blowing up at home, tells them he hates them,  <br/>
can&#39;t wait to move out. He&#39;s been smoking marijuana for 3 years (he&#39;s  <br/>
17), smokes cigarettes, tried cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
It all sounds like the product of a disconnected family with a lot of  <br/>
issues, but they aren&#39;t. He&#39;s a good kid. Their parenting, while  <br/>
conventional, has never made me cringe. Twitch a few times ;-) but  <br/>
minor stuff.<br/>
<br/>
But obviously there&#39;s a major breakdown in communication. I suspect  <br/>
he&#39;s been under a lot of pressure for a while since he&#39;s been  <br/>
swimming competitively for years and gets very good grades and all  <br/>
their reactions that seem like the right thing to do in response to  <br/>
what he&#39;s doing is just making things worse.<br/>
<br/>
She loved the Siblings Without Rivalry book so I don&#39;t think they  <br/>
would be close minded to trying something different. (They&#39;re going  <br/>
for family counseling next week so they are trying something.)<br/>
<br/>
So if you could give one book to help someone heal their broken  <br/>
relationship with their teen, what would it be?<br/>
<br/>
Parent/Teen Breakthrough is my first thought. My memory is that it  <br/>
felt kind of radical so maybe something that *feels* more conventional.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read Unconditional Parenting by Alfie Kohn? Would it work  <br/>
for a relationship that&#39;s already damaged or is that better for  <br/>
preventing it?<br/>
<br/>
Any others?<br/>

i was going to suggest parent teen breakthrough too!  but unconditional parenting, while great on theory and reasons to NOT be conditional / not use punishments and rewards - lacks practical advice on what to do INSTEAD  and is geared more toward younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d suggest  hold onto your kids: why parents matter, by gordon neufeld and gabor mate, for a slightly more mainstream book, which assumes school (so does alfie), but is ALL about connection and attachment, and repairing bonds, and &quot;collecting our kids&quot;.   there is a dvd too, if a 2 hour audiovisual would go over better....<br/>
<br/>
patty wipfler has a nice 40 page booklet on connecting/reaching for your angry teen - supporting adolescents -  as well....<br/>

<br/>
I read this book right before my first child was born, and it was enormously<br/>
healing and helpful.  It helped me understand many of the &quot;why&#39;s&quot; around my<br/>
own parents&#39; choices.  The author wrote it after losing touch with a couple<br/>
of his own teenagers and figuring out how to reconnect with them.  -=b.</div>

I would agree with Pam on this one. It is by far the best book I&#39;ve read on parenting teens. It also assumes the kid&#39;s going to school so there are a lot of &#39;in school&#39; references. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But being aware, and being empowered to do something about it, are<br/>
different things. The book I mentioned is specifically aimed at<br/>
empowering teenagers to take steps to free themselves from school. <br/>
<br/>
I discovered unschooling at about the same age, 17 - through an<br/>
alternative education group (in the UK, The Potential Trust) and<br/>
through reading Ivan Illich and A.S.Neill. These books espouse the<br/>
principles, but they don&#39;t offer guidance to the individual. Maybe if<br/>
I had had a guide, I wouldn&#39;t have had to go through a further 8 years<br/>
of formal education before finding my own path...<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me the right course in this situation is to support the<br/>
teenager, rather than try to win the parents over - which isn&#39;t going<br/>
to happen, since their philosophy is clearly not in line with<br/>
unschooling. However, I grant you that this would not be likely to<br/>
produce family harmony in the short run. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, I don&#39;t have teenagers so I can&#39;t speak from that point of view,<br/>
but I have been that 17yo who smoked marijuana, ciggies, drank and<br/>
tried my share of drugs.  Is that where the fight between him and his<br/>
family is?  Do they not want him NOT doing those things?  Do they<br/>
think doing those things make him seem like less?  Is he blowing up at<br/>
them because he does these things or because of the power struggle<br/>
over them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing this won&#39;t be a popular view but not everyone who tries<br/>
or does these things for a phase means the outcome will be that they<br/>
are an addict or uncapable of being productive people?  Granted<br/>
statistically your chances are much greater.  <br/>
<br/>
But if that&#39;s the big issue (the drugs), what if they just let it go?<br/>
 I personally am not a big fan of pot, I&#39;m already pretty laid back so<br/>
I don&#39;t need something to bring me down.  But some people are wired<br/>
more tightly and it&#39;s their way of self medicating.  Cocaine and other<br/>
drugs while I would totally recommend staying away from them, I do<br/>
understand the desire to experiment and see what the hype is about.  I<br/>
know quite a few people who have tried this and never became addicts<br/>
or even frequent users. <br/>
<br/>
Caffeine, I used it for years.  I can&#39;t stand it now, but it took me<br/>
years to figure out that my body doesn&#39;t handle caffeine very well. <br/>
If my parents would have told me not to use it, that would have made<br/>
me want to use it even more. <br/>
<br/>
Ciggies, we&#39;re in a big anti smoking world right now.  I used to smoke<br/>
frequently.  But now I still smoke occasionally...like if I go out<br/>
with friends.  I don&#39;t smoke daily.  Not everyone who smokes is<br/>
addicted to nicotine...again your chances go way up.  But many people<br/>
who are addicted to nicotine, do quit.  Isn&#39;t this his decision??<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re asking for book advice and I&#39;m not sure if there is a book<br/>
out there that would say let your kids experiment.  Let them possibly<br/>
risk their health and their lives.  But IMO, if they can continue to<br/>
be supportive of him and maybe let some of the control go, they&#39;ll<br/>
improve their relationship.  He&#39;s going off to college soon and he&#39;ll<br/>
be free to do whatever he wants.  Instead of his parents being the<br/>
antagonist that he can&#39;t or won&#39;t come to, they can be the loving<br/>
supportive people they&#39;ve always been???  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;ll help but it helped me to write it in case I do<br/>
have kids that chose to do things I wouldn&#39;t probably recommend they do!  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But if that&#39;s the big issue (the drugs), what if they just let it go?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the approach of the Parent/Teen Breakthrough book. The basic  <br/>
premise is not to do anything that doesn&#39;t improve  your relationship  <br/>
with your child. There are anecdotes of kids who are using drugs in  <br/>
the book. Those made an impression on me since Kat was young at the  <br/>
time I read it and it was hard imagining a parent not locking the kid  <br/>
up ;-) I understood the whole point of letting go but it was still  <br/>
hard to imagine!<br/>
<br/>
But now it&#39;s easier to imagine now that Kat&#39;s more independent.  <br/>
Control is an illusion. But I can imagine it&#39;s harder to accept that  <br/>
for parents whose kids are including dangerous activities in their  <br/>
forays into independence. And I understand the kids too. A lot of the  <br/>
dangerous stuff is a way of saying &quot;Ha, you can&#39;t control me and I&#39;ll  <br/>
show you how little control you have.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which is what makes the book good because she gets that we can&#39;t  <br/>
control them. All we have is the opportunity to influence them. And  <br/>
we can&#39;t influence them if they don&#39;t trust us.<br/>

<br/>
What is NLP? This is Keith Gilbert&#39;s explanation:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.neurolinguisticparents.com/WhatisNLP.htm">http://www.neurolinguisticparents.com/WhatisNLP.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Brief and not very clear, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
I first encountered NLP way back in 1990 when I bought a book out of<br/>
curiosity called Introducing Neuro-Linguistic Programming by Joseph<br/>
O&#39;Connor and John Seymour, which described NLP as &quot;The New Psychology<br/>
of Personal Excellence&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
From the back cover of the book:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some people appear more gifted than others. NLP describes in simple<br/>
terms what they do differently, and enables you to learn these<br/>
patterns of excellence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about the &quot;in simple terms&quot;. The book has a glossary of<br/>
words I&#39;d never heard of at the time that I needed to learn to make<br/>
sense of the book. I like things to be explained to me in plain<br/>
English, so that totally put me off NLP, until I started to see it<br/>
being promoted all around the internet maybe five or six years ago,<br/>
and I became interested in it again.<br/>
<br/>
NLP is the creation of John Grinder, when he was an assistant<br/>
professor of linguistics at the University in California, Santa Cruz,<br/>
and Richard Bandler, who was then a psychology student at the<br/>
university. They began collaborating in 1972 to analyse the patterns<br/>
of speech and behaviour of three famous therapists of the day - Fritz<br/>
Perls, Viginia Satir and Milton Erickson - so they could discover<br/>
exactly what they said and did and thus be able to pass that on to<br/>
other people so they could learn to say and do it too. In 1976,<br/>
Grinder and Bandler decided to call what they were doing<br/>
Neuro-Linguistic Programming - &quot;... a cumbersome phrase that covers<br/>
three simple ideas. The &#39;Neuro&#39; part of NLP acknowledges the<br/>
fundamental idea that all behaviour stems from our neurological<br/>
processes of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and feeling. We<br/>
experience the world through our five senses; we make &#39;sense&#39; of the<br/>
information and then act on it. ... The &#39;Linguistic&#39; part of the title<br/>
indicates that we use language to order our thoughts and behaviour and<br/>
to communicate with others. The &#39;Programming&#39; part refers to ways we<br/>
can choose to organize our ideas and actions to produce results. NLP<br/>
deals with the structure of human subjective experience; how we<br/>
organize what we see, hear and feel, and how we edit and filter the<br/>
outside world through our senses. It also explores how we describe it<br/>
in language and how we act, both intentionally and unintentionally, to<br/>
produce results.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because Grinder and Bandler&#39;s original work was with therapists, many<br/>
people seem to think NLP is a form of therapy, and it&#39;s often sold on<br/>
the internet as such, but it isn&#39;t intended to be. It&#39;s basically<br/>
about modelling excellence in a structured, methodical way, although<br/>
that can sometimes, in itself, have therapeutic benefits.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen on the internet some extraordinary and outrageous claims<br/>
made for NLP, usually related to reading people&#39;s minds and making<br/>
others obey our every whim and that kind of thing, and there&#39;s some<br/>
controversy over how &#39;scientific&#39; it is, but I don&#39;t know that its<br/>
originators ever claimed that it was &#39;scientific&#39;. I personally don&#39;t<br/>
regard anything related to human psychology as &#39;scientific&#39; - in fact,<br/>
quite the opposite - but, for me, it doesn&#39;t need to be scientific to<br/>
be useful.<br/>
<br/>
I think NLP is very useful. I don&#39;t actually &#39;do NLP&#39; myself, but I<br/>
recognise in it many of the &#39;tools and techniques&#39; that have been part<br/>
of my daily life for many years, only presented in a more<br/>
sophisticated context. Indeed, I now have a fine collection of NLP<br/>
books, mp3s and even playing cards that I often refer to. My<br/>
understanding, such as it is, of how I think and what I perceive and<br/>
how that affects my behaviour and experiences has been conglomerated<br/>
over the years from a variety of sources. If I had to do it all over<br/>
again, I&#39;d simply &#39;learn NLP&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Keith Gilbert&#39;s book &quot;Teenagers ...&quot; applies all the established NLP<br/>
tools and techniques specifically to relationships between teenagers<br/>
and their parents. There&#39;s a particular emphasis on showing teenagers<br/>
how grown ups use language to manipulate behaviour and how to deal<br/>
with that.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what it says in the Introduction:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teenagers<br/>
<br/>
What are you going to find in this book?<br/>
<br/>
Some FUN!<br/>
Language - how people use it and what it tells you about how they think.<br/>
Ways you can protect yourself from other people&#39;s attempts at making<br/>
you do things you might not want to...and don&#39;t have to do.<br/>
Ways to discover what you really want to do.<br/>
Ways to do what you really want to do.<br/>
Mental exercises that will help you free yourself from limiting ideas<br/>
about what you think you can and cannot do.<br/>
How to rebel against limiting adult thinking in safe, clever and<br/>
stylish ways.<br/>
How to determine your own physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.<br/>
How to determine, for you, the most appropriate way to live in the<br/>
world with other people and the environment.<br/>
Ways to create and maintain healthy relationships.<br/>
An excellent adventure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a $5 ebook version available at Lulu.com, btw.<br/>
<br/>
I will be attending Keith Gilbert&#39;s The Technology of Choice workshop<br/>
in Sydney over the weekend of February 21-22, so that I have a better<br/>
grasp of the practicalities of NLP myself and can absorb more of its<br/>
tools and techniques directly into my daily life. The Technology of<br/>
Choice workshop was formerly his Neuro-Linguistic Parents workshop. A<br/>
report on my experiences will appear in probably the March issue of my<br/>
newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll ditto that!  I&#39;m curious now.  Is it a book that an unschooled teen<br/>

&gt; especially interested in it at this moment in her life , but she may be<br/>
&gt; when she&#39;s a bit older.  I&#39;m going to see if my library has it, so I can<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Could you tell us a little more about it, Bob? What is NLP<br/>
&gt; &gt; (neurolinguistic programming)? I&#39;m curious, but not quite curious to<br/>
&gt; &gt; spend money on it without knowing more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Jenny<br/>
<br/>
Please see my reply to Pam. <br/>
<br/>
Keith Gilbert&#39;s book unequivocally sides with the teenager rather than<br/>
parents and adults generally, so I&#39;d say it&#39;s well outside the<br/>
mainstream. <br/>
<br/>
I think parents of unschooled teenagers would, however, already<br/>
understand much of what the book advocates in terms of respecting our<br/>
children&#39;s feelings, choices, etc., but how I see it with my son Pat<br/>
is that, while he doesn&#39;t need the &#39;tools and techniques&#39; of NLP so<br/>
much for his relationship with his parents, he may well appreciate<br/>
having them available to him when dealing with the less enlightened in<br/>
the world at large.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;In any work, you are going to use words to influence the<br/>
psychological life of an individual today; you are going to use words<br/>
to influence his organic life today; you are going to also influence<br/>
his psychological and organic life twenty years from now. So you had<br/>
better know what you are saying. You had better be willing to reflect<br/>
upon the words you use, to wonder what their meanings are, and to seek<br/>
out and understand their many associations.&quot; <br/>
