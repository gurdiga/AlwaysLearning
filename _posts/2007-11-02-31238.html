<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472611276">For a long time if some of you remember my son was so very scared of<br/>
other kids at the park. He wouldn&#39;t want to stay at all if there was<br/>
any kid he didn&#39;t know there. The same happened when we went to a<br/>
store,he would freak out if someone looked at him. My husband was very<br/>
concerned,he said it really bothered him,Lukas might need preschool or<br/>
something...blah blah. I reassured him that it will change. We didn&#39;t<br/>
do anything except honor Lukas&#39; feelings. We did not force or talk him<br/>
into any social situations he didn&#39;t want to be in. He did change. He<br/>
is so social now that my husband said one day that he is starved for<br/>
social scenes. Speaking of trick or treating last night....it was<br/>
Lukas&#39; first time(he wasn&#39;t into costumes before) He rang the<br/>
bells,talked to people and had a great time. My sciatica didn&#39;t bother<br/>
me. It was nice. So for all you parents worrying...don&#39;t :)<br/>

sorry for the cross post.</div>
