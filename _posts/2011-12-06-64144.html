<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704094790">Wanted to let all of you know that my always-unschooled 17-year-old daughter will be taking 12 credits at the local community college next semester.  All registered.  She enrolled as a high school student and was exempt from taking the SAT to enroll.  All students take an assessment test for class placement purposes, and she scored college level in all areas except math, so she is taking pre-algebra. That is only the second test she has ever taken; her first being her learner&#39;s permit test at the DMV.<br/>
<br/>
She is very excited.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works.  <br/>

Jon, proud papa</div>

Jon, that&#39;s cool.  I hope she has fun!<br/>
<br/>
Except for karate tests (physical, not written), all my kids tested first in driver&#39;s ed and then community college placement. :-)<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was 17, I wonder how many tests I had taken--casual, &quot;pop quiz,&quot; standardized, &quot;midterm,&quot; &quot;final...&quot;  and then I went to college and was tested much, much more.  Sheeeesh!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling certainly works to keep people from being tested day in and day out!!<br/>
