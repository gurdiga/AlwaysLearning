 Actually, she likes to hide my shoes.  ..she may be trying to teach me to <br/>
 levitate, but it ain&#39;t gonna work.  One of my greatest joys is playing <br/>
 &#39;Where&#39;d She Put It?&#39; after she&#39;s gone for the day.  She has the most <br/>
 unique sense of where things should go - but to have a super-clean bathroom <br/>
 floor/shower/tub/kitchen is worth almost any price.<br/>
 <br/>
 ...for whomever said they couldn&#39;t quite bring themselves to having someone <br/>
 help with their little sty, a good house-helper will NOT mind!  They like <br/>
 seeing the clear path they leave and the look on your face when you see it <br/>
 clean for the first time in forever, is priceless to them (but yes, you&#39;ll <br/>
 still have to fork over some green.)  When Imelda first came to me, she <br/>
 quoted me a price over the phone, but after she walked around and checked <br/>
 the house out, that price raised itself considerably.  All raise their <br/>
 voices in praise!  Imelda Be Praised! &gt;&gt;<br/>

Our Cleaning Goddess is Rose. She comes every two weeks,  When we do home <br/>
repairs (like when we put in the new kitchen floor), we excitedly think about <br/>
what Rose&#39;s response will be. We know at least every two weeks the house will <br/>
be clean and smell great. <br/>
<br/>
We also have things go to mysterious places. One of the most amusing things <br/>
she does is artfully cover our piles of crap (We call them Crap Mountains) <br/>
with throws. Makes them look much better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Crap Mountains?!  Yeah!  This got a big laugh out of me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying this thread in a vicarious sort of way, being amongst those <br/>
who have not enough green to appease the Cleaning Goddess nor enough <br/>
organization/motivation/time to enjoy a clutter-free abode.  Oh well, I <br/>
wonder if I have what it takes to artfully cover the Crap Mountains in my <br/>
own home.<br/>
