  Well, I know I&#39;m really going to sound weird, but I haven&#39;t read ANY parenting books.  I love to read, I read a lot and own a lot of books.  I think this whole issue really has more to do with WHY a person reads than it has to do with one&#39;s committment to unschooling or to a philosophy of a given list.  I was directed to the list by a friend on another list.:0)<br/>
  I love my RU lifestlye.  We have been uschoolers for about 6 years and I just want to assure those of you who may not want to read parenting books that you can joyfully, radically unschool without ever having read a single book about it.  The lists were enough for me.  I think it&#39;s great the books are there for those who like to read that sort of thing.  As for me, I like to read when I know I&#39;m talking to real live people, the lists are interactive and that makes a big difference to me.  I like to read fun stuff like mysteries, romances, fantasy fiction.  When I think of a parenting book, my eyes kind of glaze over.  I guess I could no more make myself read something, than I would make my kid read something.  I live in this country and I vote, but i&#39;ve never read the whole constituion either.  You don&#39;t have to to be a citizen.  John Holt was probably brilliant, but I&#39;m on this list because I think the moms are cool and fun to &#39;chat&#39; with.<br/>

Different people learn different ways, and have different talents.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I were watching Rent with the commentary track  <br/>
on.  In the subway scene, where they&#39;re singing &quot;Santa Fe,&quot; the  <br/>
comments were (and I don&#39;t know the voices apart so I don&#39;t know who  <br/>
was saying what, but I think the director was asking a couple of the  <br/>
actors, so it&#39;s one of their responses).  I&#39;ll transcribe the part  <br/>
this all reminded me of.  It&#39;s about Jesse Martin, who plays Collins.<br/>
<br/>
Jesse is a true artistic Renaissance man.<br/>
<br/>
Has he studied dance?<br/>
<br/>
I can honestly say... He doesn&#39;t have to study anything.  The guy..   <br/>
I have never met a more talented person in my whole  life.  He&#39;s  <br/>
incredible. Anything he wants to do, not only does he do it, but he  <br/>
does it like better than anyone you&#39;ve ever seen.  He&#39;s just... he&#39;s  <br/>
unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a really good sketch artist, too.<br/>
<br/>
Not just a sketch artist.  I&#39;m sure most of the people watching this  <br/>
movie have used an Etch a Sketch and can barely draw a straight line  <br/>
on an Etch-a-Sketch.  Jesse can do portraits of people, dead on, on  <br/>
an Etch-a-Sketch.  I mean that&#39;s like genius.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
While they were saying all that, he was dancing and twirling on poles  <br/>
and flipping from handrails and singing and smiling and acting.   <br/>
There are people who have studied dance for years and will never show  <br/>
that exuberance.<br/>
<br/>
Reading parenting books can help a lot, when people are stuck.  When  <br/>
people aren&#39;t stuck, when their relationship with their children is  <br/>
smooth and peaceful and lively, would the books help?  And when  <br/>
someone isn&#39;t into working on the real relationship but thinks books  <br/>
might magically keep them from really needing to DO IT, will reading  <br/>
three books help them?  Ten books?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m that way with books on organization.  I read them like fantasy  <br/>
books.   OOh that would be SO COOL!  But I&#39;m not putting all that  <br/>
effort into physically reorganizing my stuff or throwing things out  <br/>
by the truckload.  I don&#39;t want to do that.  I&#39;m living with my  <br/>
clutter.  But the books are good fantasy reading.    I think some  <br/>
people (though it&#39;s sad to say) read lots of parenting books, lots of  <br/>
unschooling sites and lists, but they don&#39;t change their attitudes or  <br/>
their actions, really.  They might imagine what it would be like, but  <br/>
they can&#39;t or don&#39;t make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
Someone left another list in a big snit the other day, cursing me and  <br/>
my family on the way out (kind of amusing, honestly) assuring me that  <br/>
if she wanted to read more about unschooling, she would buy a book.   <br/>
She didn&#39;t want to read webpages, she wanted to read the list.<br/>
<br/>
ALL of it is reading. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(And if you think art on an Etch-a-Sketch is no big deal, maybe look  <br/>
