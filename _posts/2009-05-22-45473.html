<div id="ygrps-yiv-742293313">This is the 3rd time she has said this in two weeks. I asked her why and she said it was because i was mean. Then she told me that she was the new nice mommy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure what to make of it. I know it hurts my feelings and makes me want to cry.<br/>
I&#39;ve come a very long way from the mother/parent I was 2 years ago. <br/>
It&#39;s still hard for me not to yell and snap at her. she&#39;s 4.5 and I&#39;m still working on bonding with her.<br/>
<br/>
There is something in the way I don&#39;t know what it is. I get so upset with myself for not being able to figure this out.<br/>
I think it all started after the birth of our 2nd daughter. Our first was 2.5 at the time. She was very attached to me and called everyone mommy. I was the only one she wanted to go to sleep with at night.<br/>
After her sister was born things changed, but I started wearing her sister so I could still interact with Nakiah the way i was before.<br/>
Sometimes it feels like Nakiah belongs to my husband and Ava belongs to me. I don&#39;t like that at all. My husband blows me off and says I&#39;m being silly.<br/>
<br/>
I long for my oldest to want and need me the way she used to. I know it won&#39;t be exactly the same because she&#39;s much older now, but I feel like she&#39;s rejecting me.<br/>
The only thing I can think of is that she feels rejected by me.<br/>
I thought we were doing so well, but now I feel like there is a wall there and I don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
We don&#39;t spank, stopped using timeouts a long time ago. <br/>
I&#39;m jealous of the relationship my husband and daughter have. I want that with her! It&#39;s really breaking my heart. The other night my husband was stuck in traffic so I was getiing the girls ready for bed by myself, Nakiah looks at me and says &quot;I don&#39;t wanna go to sleep with you. I want daddy&quot;<br/>
She did end up going to sleep with me, but she didn&#39;t really want to.<br/>
I&#39;m tired of feeling like I&#39;m being punched in the gut. What else can I do to change and better our relationship? Or am I over reacting and I need to let her be?<br/>

<br/>
Try role playing.  Let her be the mommy and you be the daughter.  Be  <br/>
neutral and see what she&#39;ll do.  It might be fun.  You might learn  <br/>
some things she would like moms to do.  Play along without making it  <br/>
about you, but about letting her express herself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It does sound that you&#39;re having a bout of immaturity.  How can she  <br/>
feel confident in the love of a strong parent if you&#39;re so fragile?<br/>

<br/>
Is this baby responsible for your emotional wellbeing?<br/>
<br/>
Do a thousand little things to change and better your relationship.   <br/>
Smile.  Be patient.  Be fun and sweet and interested in her.   Ask her  <br/>
advice sometimes.  Let her have her way about something you usually  <br/>
just decide for her--could be something really minor.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are overreacting, but I don&#39;t think you need to &quot;let her  <br/>
be.&quot;   Be WITH her.   Be the newer nicer mommy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Might be over-reacting. My two boys, now 8 and 5, both developed big- <br/>
time Daddy love around the age of three. Eric used to say things to me  <br/>
when he was little like, &quot;You see how you have that little spot beside  <br/>
your nose? Daddy doesn&#39;t have a spot like that. That&#39;s why I like  <br/>
Daddy better.&quot; Me: &quot;Hmmm.&quot; [Inwardly: &quot;Your Daddy has plenty of  <br/>
spots!&quot; LOL.]<br/>
<br/>
About two years ago, I overheard them plotting my death. It was just  <br/>
after Carl had weaned, and he was like, &quot;Yeah, and I&#39;m not nursing  <br/>
anymore so I don&#39;t need her!&quot; (This is a funny story, but weirdly,  <br/>
some people freak out when I tell it,  as if my 3yo and my 6yo were  <br/>
actually planning to off me!)<br/>
<br/>
I think part of it might be developmental, as they shift away from  <br/>
that early super-dependence on Mom. David and I also theorize that it  <br/>
has to do with me being the stay-at-home Mom: I&#39;m like the air they  <br/>
breathe, hardly worth commenting on. But David is gone all day 5 days  <br/>
a week and his homecoming is a celebration every afternoon, and time  <br/>
with him is extra-precious because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Carl is just now being willing to let me put him to bed sometimes  <br/>
instead of David. Eric will accept me if David isn&#39;t home but  <br/>
otherwise it&#39;s got to be David. Doesn&#39;t seem like that big a deal to  <br/>
me. I&#39;m with them all the time and we have a great time, they climb on  <br/>
me and hug me, they&#39;re affectionate, they obviously love me. It&#39;s good  <br/>
that they love their dad too.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of times when they say things like, &quot;I wish Daddy were here  <br/>
instead of you,&quot; I&#39;ll just say, &quot;Sounds like you miss your dad,&quot; or,  <br/>
&quot;I like it when David is here with us, too,&quot; or &quot;I miss him when he&#39;s  <br/>
at work, too.&quot; Or I&#39;ll ask if they want to call him, or write him a  <br/>
note, or IM with him. Supporting that Daddy-love, because, really  <br/>
think about how great it is that my partner is so involved with them  <br/>
that they have developed those kinds of ties and feelings for him. I  <br/>
can see just in my circle of acquaintances that it&#39;s not true for a  <br/>
lot of men.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the mom. Of course they love me. They can&#39;t help it. What they say  <br/>
in a cranky moment, or the awkward ways they express their feelings  <br/>
for their dad doesn&#39;t change that.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it&#39;s easy for me to say this since they never carried  <br/>
actually through with their death-plot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58699328">I take what kids seriously but not personally, it&#39;s not their job to guard<br/>
their words for my feelings.  Their bonds with people can change often based<br/>
on growth in maturity.  One big way you could improve your relationship is<br/>
to empathize with her when she says she wants her dad.  Listen to her when<br/>
she says you are mean, find out what is bothering her. If you are centered<br/>
on how it makes you feel she may not think you take her seriously about how<br/>
SHE feels.<br/>

Hi Su I was laughing so had at this story.<br/>
I had images of Stewie plotting to murder Lois<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, last year when my daughter Gigi was 2 and a half and still now at almost 3 and a half<br/>
she goes into &quot;liking dad over mom&quot; big time.<br/>
Specially because she loves being outside around the cows.<br/>
She loves to go with him run errands a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052634682">Now that I have cleaned the Mountain Dew from my keyboard after reading about plotting to kill mommy I can respond. <br/>
<br/>
My 4 year old and I recently had a pretty long conversation about listening to words. He was tired and frustrated one afternoon and when this happens he actually speaks so quickly that I cannot understand what he is saying. I also know that there plenty of feelings and emotions he tries to express but isn&#39;t quite sure how. Add all this together and you get a meltdown, with him at least. I hugged him and just whispered to him while he cried, once he calmed down and had a sippy cup of chocolate milk (I knew he was also hungry but too upset to eat so a quick fix until he was ready to eat as well) we were able to talk. He looked at me and said calmly that I wasn&#39;t listening to his words. We were sitting on the floor still though I leaned over a little bit so we were on the same level. I asked him to repeat slowly what he had said so that I could hear his words. He looked at me and said, &quot;No, mommy LISTEN not hear.&quot; He was trying to explain what he had been<br/>
 doing with his friend and I didn&#39;t catch a few key words. He got frustrated because I was missing a key element of his story. So we talked about how to listen to each others words. Once he got frustrated he couldn&#39;t put his thoughts together, something I totally relate to. So we decided that when this happens we will both sit down and take a deep breath. I have also started asking him to slow down so that I can listen to his words or if I need to tell him something I remind him that he needs to listen to mommy&#39;s words too. But when I hear him say you are not listening to my words I know he is getting frustrated with me or someone else. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your daughter saying she wants a new mommy is a similar message. Something is going on and she doesn&#39;t feel you are listening to what she is saying. I know with my son there are times when he doesn&#39;t know the right word to express what he is thinking so we have to sit and figure it out. We have also had bouts of &quot;I hate you!&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t want you!&quot; And other such expressions. It is frustration, tired, and or hungry with my son. 4 years old seems to be one of those transitions in development. Still very much a baby/toddler but becoming a &quot;big kid&quot; too. Both of my kids wanted to hold on to being babies and at the same time wanted to be big kids. <br/>
<br/>
Take what your daughter is saying seriously but not to heart. She loves her mommy but maybe she needs something different from mommy now than when she did even 2 weeks ago, 2 months ago, etc. Roleplaying would be a good way to find out what she needs or help her figure out what she needs. As for wanting to be with daddy and having a strong relationship with him support that. It is an awesome thing for kids to have happy, healthy relationships with both parents. They don&#39;t belong to either one of you but to themselves. They will just express it in different ways. Your daughter is confident enough in your love of her to try to tell you she needs something else. It isn&#39;t her responsibility to make sure you are self confident but it is yours to help her build her confidence in herself. <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, my daughter used to tell me I was fired when she got frustrate with me. Thank you Donald Trump.<br/>

Listen So Kids Will Talk. The first chapter is actually about how to  <br/>
listen :-) Very easy read and practical information.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than reading an adult meaning into her words, see them as  <br/>
feedback. Something is off and she&#39;s trying to let you know that in  <br/>
the only way she can. Listen :-) Don&#39;t take it personally.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll help both of you to see the positive in that rather than the  <br/>
negative. Rather than seeing it as a rejection, see it as a very cool  <br/>
thing that she is bonding with her father. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to imply that you should give up trying to find a common  <br/>
ground to connect on, but some personalities mesh better than others.  <br/>
It could be they &quot;get&quot; each other. That&#39;s a GOOD thing :-) Embrace  <br/>
the things you do have in common but celebrate the fact that she has  <br/>
someone who has even more in common with her.<br/>
<br/>
If you had two friends and one had the same taste in movies and  <br/>
clothes and rhythm to their life as you do, and the other was a fun  <br/>
person for a weekly cup of coffee, how would you feel if the coffee  <br/>
friend got jealous of your other friend and started getting emotional  <br/>
that you weren&#39;t spending as much time with her as with your other  <br/>
friend. Wouldn&#39;t that negativity undermine what connection you did have?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be the grasping coffee friend! You&#39;ll drive her away. Embrace  <br/>
that she will come to you for what you connect on. Embrace that she  <br/>
has others she can connect to. Anything that fosters more and better  <br/>
relationships is great :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934760101">Thank you all for you responses. I never thought of it as making her responsible for my emotional well being. I don&#39;t want to put that responsibility on her at all. <br/>
<br/>
When she told me she didn&#39;t want to go to sleep with me, I called my husband back and they talked for a few minutes.<br/>
I did tell her she didn&#39;t have to go to sleep with me and we sat and read books and watched TV. She ended up laying across my lap and falling sleep. I carried her upstairs and when my husband came home he went upstairs to kiss the girls.<br/>
<br/>
I will try the role playing with her and really listen to what it is she&#39;s telling me.<br/>
After I typed my initial message to the group I went to Sandra&#39;s site and read about changing the next interaction instead of trying to change everything all at once. That I can do. After this I am going to read the link on breathing :)<br/>
<br/>
They have the same daddy/daughter relationship that I have with my father. I think thats great!<br/>
They definitely get each other in a way that I don&#39;t get her.<br/>
I know my problem is I see my mom and myself when I see the relationship I have with Nakiah and it scares me. I&#39;ve said before I didn&#39;t have the best role model in my mom. <br/>
She did everything she could to break my spirit and destroy my relationship with my dad.<br/>
We are not on speaking terms right now. I don&#39;t want that to happen with us.<br/>
I&#39;m trying really hard not to focus on not being like my mom and really focus on being with my girls and enjoying them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I honestly feel very fragile and I know I&#39;m still working through my childhood hurts and scars. I don&#39;t want to project that on to my kids. <br/>
Sometimes I do feel immature and needy and I wonder what in the world have I gotten myself into and what I am going to do!<br/>
I want to be the mother I never had while staying true to myself. I want to help them through transitions and their soft place to fall. I&#39;m having some trouble getting there.<br/>

<br/>
Is there something about &quot;staying true to yourself&quot; that would involve  <br/>
not being a good mother?   Did you just write that without really  <br/>
thinking?  Sometimes people use phrases or idioms without thought.    <br/>
Doing ANYthing without thought is a danger to your mental (and  <br/>
sometimes physical) health and safety.<br/>
<br/>
If what you want is to be the mother you didn&#39;t have, then every  <br/>
single thing you do in that vein should be healing for you,  <br/>
strenghtening for your confidence and maturity, and also wonderful for  <br/>
your family.<br/>
