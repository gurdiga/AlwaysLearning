<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964538778">My son is currently 18 months old, and my husband and I plan to unschool
 him once he is school age. Now that he is a toddler, I find I have to 
be much more conscious of my parenting behavior because it seems easier 
to slip into conventional parenting than it was when he was an infant...
 for example, saying &quot;no, coffee tables are not for climbing!&quot; rather 
than to stop and ponder why that must be a rule and if it&#39;s 
necessary--he&#39;s quite careful when he climbs. My husband and I are 
working hard to be more respectful and stop controlling/coercing 
behavior out of our son, and he&#39;s responding to this by being an 
all-around happier child.&nbsp; <br><br>My dilemma, however, is that I run a 
home daycare... and I wonder now if it is incompatible with unschooling--and I mean unschooling as a parenting philosophy because I realize that he&#39;s not school age yet.
 I chose to open the daycare after my son was born so that we could 
afford for me to stay home with him. I really enjoy doing it. I have a 
small group (between 3-5 kids each day, including my son). They all are 
between 1.5 and 3 years old. <br><br>I follow the unschooling philosophy as 
much as possible with my daycare group. For example, I&#39;ll put art 
supplies on the table and invite them to use them (not required), and 
the art projects are always open-ended, rather than &quot;everyone must now 
make snowmen.&quot; We read books and talk, but I&#39;m not having them recite 
the alphabet or drilling them on numbers and letters. We have a great, 
huge playroom with lots of toys and lots of time to explore. So I&#39;m not 
worried that I&#39;m teaching; I believe I am being a good guide and 
resource. <br><br>My concern is more about behavior management, so to 
speak. The freedom my son is experiencing is not going to be possible to
 give to the daycare children.&nbsp; <br><br>For licensing and liability 
reasons, I just cannot let them climb on the coffee table.&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone 
got hurt doing an activity like this, even if it was an accident, I 
could be sued, lose my daycare license, and even get a criminal record 
if the state determines the accident was due to negligence or failing to
 provide a safe environment. The thought of &quot;what if&quot; is very worrisome 
to me. <br><br>That is an extreme example, but even on a smaller 
level... I can&#39;t let a daycare child eat only watermelon for lunch (if 
he asks for it) because I have to take his parents&#39; wishes into 
consideration. <br><br>I wonder what it will do to my son to see that 
he--and only he--can climb the coffee table. He--and only he--can have 
unlimited watermelon (because the other kids have to finish their peas).
 This doesn&#39;t seem healthy to me. <br><br>I&#39;d also love to hear about 
unschooling done in a family with many children. Because I have 3-5 kids
 here at a time (and they are all young), I feel like I have to limit 
and control when the daycare kids are here in ways that I don&#39;t 
limit/control when they are gone... for example, I&#39;d be much more likely
 to give my son free reign with the finger paints when I know I can just
 take him to the tub after... but with 4 other kids to watch (and 
potentially bathe, if everyone gets that messy!), I can&#39;t make choices 
that would lessen my ability to supervise the group. <br><br>I am 
curious to hear what others think about our situation. In the summer, I 
plan to go down to doing daycare only 3 days per week. By the time my 
son is of school age, my goal is to be finished with the daycare and to 
able to be home 100%. However, that is at least four years away.</div>

<br>Kids shouldn&#39;t be encouraged to climb on coffee tables, though, unless it is one that is there FOR them to climb on.

<br>So - bottom line, set up the environment so that you don&#39;t have to control their behavior. <br><br>-pam</span></blockquote></div></div>

Look for ways to divide up your home so that you have designated shared space and private space - that will also let your son have a place to keep special toys of his own so he doesn&#39;t feel pressured to share, and someplace he can go if he needs a break from other kids (later, when he&#39;s okay off by himself).&nbsp;<br><br>You could also consider having a special shelf or storage area for day-care food where you also keep food for your kid. During day-care hours, only that food is available. Depending on the other kids&#39; needs, you might have separate food for each kid, or a kind of communal snack area supplemented by prepared meals. When I used to babysit we had separate food storage for each child because different parents had very different ideas of what their kids should eat.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
