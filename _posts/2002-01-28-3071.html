Didn&#39;t that make you nuts?  I had a cow when an airport security guy<br/>
wouldn&#39;t let my 4yo take his toy guns on the plane.  They made him check the<br/>
guns (it had never crossed my mind) and Zach cried.  I was so mad and said<br/>
something to the effect of &quot;Are you crazy?  Its a toy.  I don&#39;t think a 4yo<br/>
is going to steal an airplane&quot; at which time Dh gently ushered me along.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d probably snap if somebody decided to interrogate my children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370185080">**Is that a newer-to-older trend or a smaller-to-larger (population) trend? <br/>
Because California is trussed up like a Christmas goose with legal hoo-ha<br/>
(if my terminology gets too technical, someone let me know &lt;g&gt;).**<br/>
<br/>
:-D Cute Pam<br/>
<br/>
Still, darlin, California isn&#39;t trussed up at all compared to places like <br/>
Massachussetts, where homeschooling is specifically NOT private education and <br/>
conducted at the whim of local school boards, or Pennsylvania, or or or...<br/>
<br/>
Looking closely at the laws and not laws, I tend to agree with Sandra, it&#39;s <br/>
about where lawmakers have been settled the longest. In general. :)  Some of <br/>
those states have positively evil laws that give state educrats power over <br/>
all schools in the state, public or private. How can real private education <br/>
exist under the thumb of the state?<br/>
<br/>
A sort of related rant... today I learned that students at the local high <br/>
school face suspension for speaking Spanish in school. I assume it&#39;s only <br/>
aimed at the bilingual mexican-american kids, and that the kids in Spanish <br/>
class fracturing the language are exempt. I told the mom who told me this I <br/>
thought she should contact the ACLU a take the idiots to court. Somebody&#39;s <br/>
lame brain stupid nastly idea of a gang busting measure. Sheesh.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m right, I just don&#39;t know that I&#39;m wrong yet. ;) Oh, and<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean just homeschooling laws with California, I meant law-laws in<br/>
general -- we have regulations to cover our regulations here. I&#39;m pretty<br/>
sure it&#39;s still legal to breathe, but who can keep up enough to be sure?<br/>

Pam, wonderer<br/>

<br/>
Breathing is SO protected that people can&#39;t drive old funky cars in <br/>
California.  It seems, driving around there, that all cars are new (compared <br/>
to N.Mex.) but it&#39;s the emissions standards being so high.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But Maryland has good homeschooling laws (so I hear) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought they had a bunch of testing.<br/>
Maryland and Delaware seem to be the places worst about pressing pregnant <br/>
women to apply for spot in a preparatory daycare center.  So maybe they don&#39;t <br/>
have many homeschooling laws because just waiting until kindergarten is so <br/>
scandalous that the folks there haven&#39;t gotten to homeschooling much yet.<br/>

<br/>
Well - in Kentucky, the only requirement is to notify one&#39;s school district <br/>
at the beginning of each year, homeschool for 275 days of the year and keep a <br/>
record of having done so.  There are no requirements concerning content or <br/>
intent, yet.  And I don&#39;t bother to comply with the notification, so that if <br/>
requirements decide to appear, we&#39;re not in the system and thereby affected.<br/>

state would do if they had to school another 100 days a year!<br/>
