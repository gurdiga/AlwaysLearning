<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi again, Stephanie,<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
I think we&#39;ve figured it out for the most part.  We&#39;ve got the dual LNB ( <br/>
the oval3 dish) and after a lot of bumbling about with the remote, figured <br/>
out how to switch between the two tuners.  I think I also figured out how <br/>
to tape the shows (not just do the 30 minute delay thing), but we&#39;ll know <br/>
for sure later today.  I found out yesterday that we&#39;d pay the same monthly <br/>
rate for what we have (a tivo and a separate receiver) as we would for two <br/>
tivo receivers!  Argh!  I wish I&#39;d known earlier!  I could have had them <br/>
run lines for two tivos&#39;!  Ah well.  Live and learn and she seems very <br/>
happy with her plain old receiver.<br/>
<br/>
The boy&#39;s been on the TV all day with his new gamecube and Zelda, so I <br/>
haven&#39;t really had much chance to play with the Tivo.  He&#39;s been gracious <br/>
enough to give me an hour or two now and then during the day!  (big <br/>
grin)  He&#39;s so excited, but I think we&#39;re going to have to find a decent <br/>
used TV so we can free up the TV in the front room.<br/>
Thanks for the advice!<br/>
