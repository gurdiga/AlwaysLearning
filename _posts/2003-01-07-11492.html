<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731350083"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&quot;And, besides, I&#39;ll insruct you like me to entwine<br/>
&gt;&quot;The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus&#39;s Vine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh my...Too much drinking might prevent the vigorous<br/>
entwining of Bacchus&#39; vine with anything.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;The YELLOW-HAIRED GOD and his nine lusty Maids<br/>
&gt;&quot;From Helicon&#39;s Banks will incontinent flee,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are the lusty maids and their god fleeing from their<br/>
own incontinence (a : failure to restrain sexual<br/>
appetite : UNCHASTITY b : inability of the body to<br/>
control the evacuative functions)  Or are the maids<br/>
fleeing from their god&#39;s incontinence, or are they<br/>
fleeing in search of balm for their passions? <br/>
hmmmm...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;I&#39;ll trim the young Dogs, for thus daring to twine<br/>
&gt;&quot;The Myrtle of VENUS with BACCUS&#39;S Vine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope the trimming is not of the Bobbit variety...<br/>
