<div id="ygrps-yiv-868001214">&quot;How to help boys like SCHOOL&quot; is the subject line of the current e-mail from the TED conferences.  <br/>
I&#39;m not going to watch the video myself; I have a ton of things I&#39;ve promised to do, and am running to catch up, but I did want to say that it sounds more like a way to get boys to hate video games.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone does feel like watching and commenting, though, perhaps I&#39;m wrong.  And as kids are going to be in school anyway, school reform and creativity are good.  And it&#39;s been known a long time that school was designed for girls to succeed, not for boys, in the long term.<br/>

		... Games are not the only solution to the problem, just where I started. And games are interesting precisely because they push on the culture, to the extent that when we reject game culture, we reject some part of boy culture as well, so it&#39;s a logical place to begin that dialogue.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was curious and so I watched it.  She basically had a good message.  Stop treating boys like girls.  There is a total lack of respect for boys and their culture in schools.  They are told they can not write about things they like, play games they like or be themselves.  She calls for people to make better educational games for kids, games that are actually more than glorified flash cards to help get boys interested in curriculum and she also said that most teachers talk about the things that boys like, like video games with distain. Which is just rude.</div>
