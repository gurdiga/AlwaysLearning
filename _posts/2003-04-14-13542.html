<br/>
&gt; So to those of you who ARE medically inclined and courageous and<br/>
&gt; knowledgeable, I&#39;m more impressed than before and grateful there are some<br/>
&gt; people who can and will do those things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keith was glad and sympathetic to my discomfort, and we washed,<br/>
&gt; anti-bioticked and band-aided it, and though it&#39;s a little infected right at<br/>
&gt; the opening, just barely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keith never even winced.  He is so strong and so brave and I&#39;m such a total<br/>
&gt; crybaby wimp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too. I can &quot;do what needs to be done&quot; but if the girls are hurt or<br/>
there&#39;s a terrible thorn (or a baby splinter) and Wally is there, he does<br/>
it. It&#39;s better for the girls, MUCH, because while I try to pretend to be<br/>
calm and matter-of-fact he really IS calm and matter-of-fact. And if I have<br/>
to do something myself and haul my way through it, I do, and then I feel<br/>
queasy and fluttery for hours-to-days afterward.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also had a lot more medical training than I have<br/>
(really-advanced-first-aid from his search and rescue days) and knows how to<br/>
tell if things are broken or sprained and all that.<br/>
<br/>
Make some room on the wimp couch, wouldja? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
