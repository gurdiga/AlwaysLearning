<br/>
Good thoughts to you.  I know this is a very emotional and tense time.<br/>
While I have not had a lump found, I have had a couple of life threatening<br/>
medical issues and my 2yo son has a life threatening illness.  The first<br/>
time around, nothing much helped me.  I was a mess.  I came very close to<br/>
bleeding to death and was aware of it at the time.  I expected to be<br/>
terrified but I was very calm, almost analytical (probably shock).  But I<br/>
found that to be very comforting the second time around.  I new that if<br/>
worse came to worse, I wouldn&#39;t be scared and I know that my son wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to be scared either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a fairly spiritual person and I found that to be a help.<br/>
<br/>
