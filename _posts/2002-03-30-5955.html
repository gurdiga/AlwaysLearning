<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A long and somewhat tedious yet interesting book about the tall  grass <br/>
&gt; prairie is _PrairyErth_ by William Least Heat Moon.  All about Chase  <br/>
&gt; County, Kansas.  It amazed me that one person could say so much  about <br/>
&gt; one county, but that was exactly his point I suppose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really liked his book _River-Horse_ in which he took a boat from <br/>
&gt; the  Atlantic to the Pacific, all via river.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t he the same guy who wrote Blue Highways, about traveling<br/>
cross-country on the smaller roads (blue on most maps) and the people he<br/>
meets and the things he sees? I read that 15 or 20 years ago and still<br/>
remember it, and I&#39;ve always wanted to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m now reading David Quammen&#39;s The Flight of the Iguana, which is also<br/>
fascinating. It&#39;s basically about how he learns about various animals and<br/>
nature-related topics, but it&#39;s very easy reading, conversational and<br/>
interesting. I like books that basically tell the story of how someone<br/>
learns about something, if that makes sense. Last night I read Cacie the<br/>
part about Environmental Sex Determination, or how some animals develop<br/>
into males or females depending on environment, not genetics... it was<br/>
just too amazing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you read &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; by Gerald Durrell?  It&#39;s<br/>
*wonderful* writing, about an English boy spending the war years in Greece<br/>
with his mother and older siblings.  I&#39;ve been reading it slowly for months,<br/>
savoring it.  He is a naturalist from birth, spending all the time he can<br/>
observing and learning from the animals around the islands.  His mother<br/>
hires various tutors to try to keep up his education, but none are as good a<br/>
teacher as nature. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839661280">Durrell wrote two more books about growing up on Corfu, all three are <br/>
equally marvelous. My Family and Other Animals is first, then Birds, Beasts<br/>
and Relatives, and finally Fauna and Family. He wrote lots of other books,<br/>
too, but the Corfu ones are my favorites, and they&#39;re very encouraging to<br/>
unschoolers. :)<br/>
<br/>
I must admit that my favorite scenes in the book are those involving his<br/>
family, which is NOT appreciative of his &quot;genius&quot; with nature (or the<br/>
animals he fills the house with!)<br/>
<br/>
The books are easy enough to come by at www.bookfinder.com<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508895992">Marrying off mother is really funny (from what I remember -- it&#39;s been a<br/>
few years).<br/>
The zoo and Corfu ones are good for kids as well. My oldest son read them<br/>
when he was about 11 and loved them.<br/>
