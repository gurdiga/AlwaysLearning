<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555440788">I wanna share a positive moment in our unschooling life. We are <br/>
learning tons these days. There&#39;s so many chatting and discussing <br/>
things going on. <br/>
<br/>
My kid&#39;s got himself a new best friend, someone we both like and enjoy <br/>
being with, and new best friend (BF) who likes us equally as much.    <br/>
<br/>
This 11 year old boy is an answer to my prayer (seriously, I do think <br/>
someone heard did my tearful plea and sent me an angel.) He is kind <br/>
and gentle friend. He&#39;s not only being a fantastic friend to my son, <br/>
but he is also showing me what it would have been like homeschooling 2 <br/>
kids. Despite my floor is complete covered with everytoy there is, <br/>
from Lego to 3 different train sets to ps2 discs, and is actually un-<br/>
walkable, I am actually enjoying myself and happily tiptoing around <br/>
the toys.  <br/>
<br/>
The past 3 weeks has been wonderful and blissful, and today is no <br/>
exception.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, the boys woke up, plodded downstairs and switched the tv <br/>
on. Got themselves some yogurts for breakfast, while waiting for Her <br/>
Majesty (me lol!!) to come downstairs to cook breakfast. <br/>
<br/>
They decided pancake for brekkie. So me and BF cooked pancakes (it&#39;s <br/>
such a pleasure showing BF how to cook because he loves cooking) while <br/>
DS played with his train set. They both ate thier pancakes, got <br/>
changed and brushed thier teeth without being prompt. <br/>
<br/>
They then went out to the garden to do thier fire experiment. DS came <br/>
in saying it&#39;s too cold and he had enough after half hour, and <br/>
continued his ps2 game.  BF came in half and hour later and joined in <br/>
ps2 game. The boys had a discussion how toplay the game. BF asked DS <br/>
how did he know what to do in the game, DS shared his understanding of <br/>
surfing the internet for games FAQ and walk thrus. <br/>
<br/>
Talking of internet, the boys then decided to go on Roblox.com and <br/>
played for an hour or so and had thier lunch alongside the laptops. <br/>
<br/>
They then moved on back to the train track, and is now, while I type, <br/>
still playing on with the train but is sounding really hilarious!<br/>
<br/>
They are sounding very italian LOL!! They are pretending to be Mario <br/>
and Luigi LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
And they have just asked to bake a cake. So I got to go now. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this little piece cheered someone up today and gives hope to any <br/>
newbie lurking around. <br/>

Margaux is starting to find friends.  She met a girl who likes bathroom<br/>
humor just as much as she does and it&#39;s wonderful to hear them laugh an<br/>
giggle and whisper silly things in each other&#39;s ears!<br/>
<br/>
In fact we met her at a little get-to-gether and there were quite a few<br/>
girls there and Margaux got along fabulously with each one of them.  A<br/>
year ago, this wouldn&#39;t have happened.  It seems 7 is the magic number<br/>
for Margaux, she&#39;s peeling off a layer and there&#39;s a whole new kiddo<br/>
there!  She surprises and amazes me each and every day with just being<br/>
herself!</div>
