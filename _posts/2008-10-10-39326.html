<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812579869">It seems like it&#39;s always friends. The only time I have strain or pain with Jayn, it is some issue to do with friends. It is hard to live in apartments with common areas that everyone has rights to. It&#39;s hard to have neighbors that are inescapable. <br/>
<br/>
Today Jayn had two lovely sisters come over to swim and play. As it turns out, they had spent the morning in a class with our neighbors. We live in a big city, but with a small homeschooling community, so it is reasonable to think that there will be many common acquaintances. <br/>
<br/>
After a while our neighbor&#39;s little girl decided to join Jayn and her friends in their game uninvited, and Jayn didn&#39;t want her to. Now I know that the pool and courtyard is a common area. They have the right to use that area, and I said so to Jayn. But Jayn asked for her space. She didn&#39;t want them muscling in on her playdate and changing the dynamic. Of course the little girl was sad and disappointed and her brother was angry on her behalf.<br/>
<br/>
A little while later the other two did come and swim and they all played together for a while. And it did change the dynamic, and Jayn coped with it, using some of her coping mechanisms like getting loud and clowning around, until they went inside. But not before I saw the boy making nasty visual jokes at Jayn&#39;s expense with her friends - like &quot;she&#39;s crazy&quot; hand circles when she wasn&#39;t looking. <br/>
<br/>
So it seemed like it had all sorted out, then I got an email from my neighbor saying that Jayn had been &quot;inconsiderate and disrespectful&quot; by saying she did not want K. joining their game. She tried to say it in a pleading way, and K. didn&#39;t ask if she could play, she just showed up with an expectation because her mom had told her she could join them.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think this is inconsiderate and dis-respectful to ask my children to not interact with kids that we happened to have spent the entire morning with at a nature class simply because Jayn wishes so.  I hope that you can help make this clear to Jayn that these kinds of requests are simply not an option.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now these were kids that Jayn and I had invited for the purpose of playing with Jayn. Simply because Jayn wishes so should be enough, and how they spent their morning is nothing to do with me. I don&#39;t invite children to play at our house, give them lots of snacks and food, help them with all kinds of toys and costumes, and watch their plays, for any other purpose than for Jayn to play with them. These girls love coming here, and this is the first time I realized that they even knew our neighbors at all. Here&#39;s an analogy: It&#39;s like a lady went to lunch with a colleague yesterday, so she should feel free to join him and his date when she notices him by chance at the same neighborhood eatery.<br/>
<br/>
The history of that family is one of self first, last and always. I&#39;ve seen their behavior in museums. If I started saying that her children couldn&#39;t make requests of Jayn, (and they are often brusque and demanding IMO), if I used that &quot;not an option&quot; language the other woman would be outraged. Her children&#39;s feelings are all that matters in public situations or private ones.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a couple of times in the past when James and Jayn have been playing in the pool (which is not a real big one btw) and they have come home from somewhere and immediately announced that they are going swimming - as is their right. Jayn has really sweetly asked if they would mind waiting just a little while so that she can finish swimming alone with her dad (which is never long because James get cold and earachey pretty fast) but they have said no, and refused, and been totally backed up by their parents - with a lot of jargon thrown around. Yes it was their right to use the pool, but it isn&#39;t kind, or neighborly, or considerate. <br/>
<br/>
And I find it really annoying that she can appear to be so reasonable and open to negotiate, but I have come to the conclusion that she is using the language of mindful parenting, the jargon of it, as a means of exerting control. There is a hypocrisy there, a two facedness - and her kids are sneakier, and more aggressive than she ever likes to admit. I have the emails to prove that last point. <br/>
<br/>
When Jayn plays with them she always comes back changed for while, more beligerent, more demanding, more cranky, not relaxed or joyful, as she recovers from being in a very rule bound home - but always expressed *as if* the children had a choice even though they really don&#39;t. However having been through the difference (in Jayn&#39;s response and recovery) between merely not-very-nice kids and a truly toxic personality, I have been trying to help Jayn keep the relationship alive. Jayn likes these kids, although less than she used to as she gradually sees more kindly people. This is the same mom who I posted about recently who wasn&#39;t willing to be a visual presence. I feel like I am sliding into one of those nasty situations, again like I posted about recently - the temptation to let the relationship implode. <br/>
<br/>
These kids have a lot of suppressed anger I think. They come to our house to use Jayn&#39;s things. Their mom regularly purges their toys to the Goodwill, so that even 6 months after giving a carefully thought out gift for a birthday, it&#39;s gone. Yes I feel a bit resentful. And then they are coming to our house to use Jayn&#39;s similar toys. I think Jayn is beginning to see that a lot of it is a one way street.<br/>
<br/>
I hate confrontation. I hate it,hate it, hate it.I hate feeling afraid and embarrassed. I feel like moving out tomorrow but we can&#39;t afford to do so. The reason I would want to remain cordial is because Jayn still considers these two to be her friends. I have fantasies about screaming &quot;keep your horrible children away from my daughter&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor&#39;s wish is that I lay down some rules to Jayn about suppressing her own desires. I think the whole sadness could have been avoided if the mom had been a bit more circumspect, as I am with Jayn when they have guests, and said something like what I have said, &quot;It looks like A & K are busy with some visitors.Let&#39;s wait and play later.&quot; Or just said &quot;Hi&quot; in passing. Or come out herself and checked with Jayn before encouraging K to come out. Or maybe, possibly spent a single minute talking about being kind to our neighbors, instead of insisting on &quot;rights&quot;. It is true that sometimes I have had a battle to bring Jayn in from the balcony, when she is not welcome to play (and I guess it&#39;s ok for *her* kids to tell Jayn &quot;you can&#39;t play with me and my friend&quot; but not ok for mine to feel the same way.) But I do it, and sometimes I even take her out rather than have her suffer from watching, or let her be intrusive.  <br/>
<br/>
Jayn *needs* these one- or two-on-one playdates. Groups and park days are only part of the picture. Should she be required to share her friends when they come over? <br/>
<br/>
I have suggested that I arrange future playdates for times when they will be out anyway, if it is possible, but I have not heard back yet. Here is part of my response, directly in response to the above quote (feeling outraged at the hyporcrisy of that is hard to get past):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I agree that the pool is a communal space, and I have expressed that to Jayn. Indeed I was saying so again from the balcony at the time, but I don&#39;t think you heard me.<br/>
<br/>
However muscling in on Jayn&#39;s playdate and changing the dynamic, just because you happen to know the visitors from another place is another matter. From Jayn&#39;s point of view Karine and Alan were being very disrespectful of her and her time to play with these special friends. I do not think accepting such behavior is a reasonable requirement to make of Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT at all willing to tell her that &quot;asking for her space&quot; (her expression tonight that she tells me she learnt from you) to play alone with her guests is &quot;not an option&quot;. I WILL coach her to be less reactive and kinder in her expression, BUT she has every right to play with only her visitors regardless of whether your kids know them or have spent time with them earlier (as do A... and K.... when they have guests). &quot;<br/>
  <br/>
Help! I need some perspective, or better words or something. I&#39;m really struggling with trying to see her point of view. I think I believe that I should do so, that I should be reasonable, that I should give her my assumption of good intentions. I also feel like I have done this so often, so greatly and let so much slide that I am close to fed up with the whole relationship. I do know that I will want to be extra vigilant during any imminent interactions between Jayn and our neighbors, especially the boy, because historically there has often been a little bit of underhanded revenge nastiness, usually verbal, sometimes physical (like the mean spirited hand circling) - and I have seen Jayn just look baffled since this kind of thing goes right past her. <br/>
<br/>
Pam, one of the reasons I am so willing to drive all the way to Dragontree, aside from the delight of seeing you and the soul&#39;s joy of just being around other lovely unschoolers, is that I am almost entirely unlikely to meet up with these neighbors there. That is not the case with any of the other park days that are more local to me.<br/>
<br/>
Every time it&#39;s a problem with neighbors...it must be me. Is it me? Does it count that James can&#39;t stand &#39;em? Solving the social stuff with unschoolers never seems to be this hard or fear inducing. Makes me want to move to a cave somewhere....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021668427">Some things stood out to me in the descriptions of the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who the &quot;friends&quot; are in your opening sentence, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem like it&#39;s the neighbors.  I wasn&#39;t clear what you meant.<br/>
<br/>
Just because people are obnoxious and icky with the &quot;mindful&quot; speak, that<br/>
doesn&#39;t negate the fact that they may be suffering from a lack of social<br/>
interaction which to *them* is inexplicable.  It reminds me of school.<br/>
Those who weren&#39;t popular copied those who were popular and generally made<br/>
themselves a pain to be around.  Sounds like the relationship the neighbor<br/>
mom has with her kids is crappy and adversarial.  Maybe she thinks Jayn&#39;s<br/>
peaceful relationship with her parents is a fluke.<br/>
<br/>
I think your point that the neighbor throws out the children&#39;s toys, for<br/>
whatever reason, and they then want to play with Jayn&#39;s toys is sad.<br/>
Anyway, as annoying as they must be, it looks unhappy for them no matter<br/>
what.  I hope it changes at some point in the future for the better.<br/>
<br/>
Now what you can do about the discomfort and the &quot;neighborly&quot; antics, I<br/>
don&#39;t know.  Not much help here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-928916175">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sounds like the relationship the neighbor<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mom has with her kids is crappy and adversarial&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe only in comparison to the glowing true peace that emanates from the <br/>
unschooling parents I admire. I&#39;ve made her sound worse than she is.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she sees herself as adversarial. She *is* good at helping her <br/>
children negotiate and goes to great lengths to do the &quot;repeat and validate&quot; <br/>
thing with them. (To the point that it seems ridiculous and the conversation <br/>
about who was going to have the blue cup could have ended already, but <br/>
that&#39;s the judgment of a grumpy, tired, anxious woman who feels trapped - <br/>
ie me - so it may be leaning a bit). Her children only - that&#39;s the point.<br/>
<br/>
I do have an example of the jargon use from yesterday though. And I think it <br/>
brings up an interesting unschooling idea.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday K. & A. were playing and their mom called out, &quot;K...do you want to <br/>
go to gymnastics today?&quot; She had mentioned earlier that they intended to go <br/>
at 5pm. K was in the middle of a game and said, &quot;No. I don&#39;t want to.&quot; Mom <br/>
immediately called her to come down and talk to her, and after a few minutes <br/>
listing all the important reasons why she should &quot;choose&quot; to go, K called <br/>
out to Jayn, &quot;Bye Jayn, I&#39;m going to gymnastics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now I understand that there may have been important reasons for K. to get to <br/>
her class. However in that situation the honest and straightforward thing to <br/>
do is say, &quot;It&#39;s time to go to gymnastics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the answer can&#39;t be &quot;no&quot;, don&#39;t phrase it as a question.<br/>
<br/>
If you are giving no choice, don&#39;t pretend that there is choice.<br/>
<br/>
If you offer a choice, accept the answer.<br/>
<br/>
If it were Jayn, I would say, &quot;It&#39;s time to leave for gymnastics&quot; and she <br/>
would feel free to say &quot;I don&#39;t want to go today&quot;. And then I might say, <br/>
&quot;Well you&#39;ll miss out on thus and such but if you&#39;re sure..&quot; Usually I know <br/>
that Jayn will, knowing she is making a true choice, a few minutes later <br/>
say, &quot;can we go now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I think your point that the neighbor throws out the children&#39;s toys, <br/>
for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whatever reason, and they then want to play with Jayn&#39;s toys is sad. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>James just made an interesting point. These two kids are always losing toys <br/>
and stuff, even brand new stuff, even gifts. Part of it is that evidently <br/>
no-one is helping them find all their gear when they leave parks or events. <br/>
But James noticed that they never seem to be upset about losing their things <br/>
and suggested to me that maybe they refuse to get attached to anything and <br/>
let the items go because they know they will have to give them up to charity <br/>
before long. I wonder.<br/>
<br/>
These kids don&#39;t seem sad. They seem a little angry and just a little <br/>
sneaky/watchful some of the time.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen kids be that way, for what seems to be those reasons.    <br/>
Maybe just as some people are genetically packrats (it seems) some  <br/>
really aren&#39;t attached to stuff.<br/>
<br/>

About the problem with the neighbors, my strongest thought was not to  <br/>
take guests back to your place, but to go somewhere else where the  <br/>
neighbors can&#39;t see you at all.  A public pool or another park or  <br/>
somewhere they can run around and play but not be seeming (to the  <br/>
neighbors) to flaunt their &quot;you can&#39;t play&quot; time.<br/>

material things were (in the religious sense) not to become attached to.<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if perhaps the cavalier attitude toward throwing some of<br/>
things was related to this.  I bet it was to some degree.<br/>
<br/>
Tears in general were shushed quickly and usually with anger, force or some<br/>
other aggressive tactic.  Displays of sadness weren&#39;t tolerated.  But<br/>
*anger* was seen as set apart and uncontrollable and therefore somehow<br/>
allowable to some degree (at least covertly) even if it wasn&#39;t any fun for<br/>
others.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard for me to hear that Jayn was flaunting her playdates, but I <br/>
suppose that is the kind of thought they would have. I have no way of <br/>
knowing (yet) when they will be here or not when I make the date a week in <br/>
advance. We have had four wonderful playdates with the same girls when my <br/>
neighbors were out for the day, which I am still hoping will be the best <br/>
solution.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not at all simple to go to a public pool, although not impossible. Most <br/>
of the nearish municipal ones are already closed for the winter, and the <br/>
YMCA costs money and has very limited time family swims during the week - <br/>
like an hour and a half. Luckily in a few weeks using the pool won&#39;t be part <br/>
of the equation, and I am certainly willing to say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jayn has <br/>
guests right now&quot; at my own front door, and encourage them to stay inside. I <br/>
am going to see if they would be willing to not swim at all, and to play <br/>
inside.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not as simple as meeting at a park, and they do meet up at a park once <br/>
a week after dance class. At our house, in addition to swimming, they watch <br/>
dvd&#39;s, make up plays, do dress up, play dolls, do coloring, eat - and by the <br/>
way these are the first drop off playdates that I have been emotionally able <br/>
to do  - and they haven&#39;t been disasters. I can&#39;t, just can&#39;t (hear my <br/>
panic), supervise all three at a public pool or park without the other mom <br/>
(who also has a four year old son, and seems to be really loving the <br/>
arrangement).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m crying now because to please someone who wouldn&#39;t have a moments pause <br/>
telling Jayn she can&#39;t join them if they have visitors, and has repeatedly <br/>
spoken to her harshly when she has knocked at their door, used mean words to <br/>
Jayn that she would never think of using to her own kids, whose kids have <br/>
been cruel enough to make her cry, I would have to totally destroy something <br/>
really special that my daughter and her two girl friends have started to <br/>
treasure. They hate to leave, they can&#39;t wait to come back, they want to do <br/>
a slumber party without the sleepover. I was so happy that finally Jayn was <br/>
reaching out to some newer, nicer friends, and so delighted with how much <br/>
fun they were having in the water and out, how many interests they seem to <br/>
share. I&#39;ve loved listening to how they plan their next game, how they <br/>
listen to each other and negotiate and are willing to be generous with each <br/>
other. They&#39;ve been happy yet quiet even in the pool - when the neighbor <br/>
kids are in the water, other neighbors complain about the level of ruckus. <br/>
There haven&#39;t been any pushing &quot;games&quot; (thinly veneered aggression outlets), <br/>
or roughhousing, or falling over incidents which are all too common with the <br/>
A & K around the pool. All of these wonders have happened because it has <br/>
been just them without the distractions and demands of a larger group or the <br/>
lengthy onerous rules of public pools.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen these neighbor kids in our house ignore Jayn in order to play <br/>
her x-box and her nintendo, and tell her she can&#39;t use a particular doll <br/>
because they want it, and carry toys to under the table and arrange the <br/>
pillows so that she can&#39;t fit in the fort. And she is so extremely generous <br/>
and usually says OK to their requests and gives them her candies and offers <br/>
them cupcakes and tells me to save some cookies for them and constantly is <br/>
on the lookout for stuffed toys or other things they might like and wants me <br/>
to get them as gifts. I made a rule, as distasteful as it was, that Jayn <br/>
didn&#39;t leave any toys down there overnight, because if she did they would <br/>
declare that they owned them when she came to collect them. Instead of just <br/>
saying, &quot;No that&#39;s Jayn&#39;s&quot; (and you know they have few toys so it&#39;s not like <br/>
the doll is disappearing in a crowd of similar items) their mom would lead <br/>
them in a long sing-songy &quot;what do you remember...&quot; which tended to be <br/>
filled with, let&#39;s just say fantasies of wishful thinking. Everyone&#39;s <br/>
&quot;opinion&quot; is to be given equal weight, even when it is plainly in contrast <br/>
to the observed facts or her certain knowledge. While Jayn stands there <br/>
crying because K. won&#39;t hand the doll back. I also learnt to put Jayn&#39;s <br/>
initials on everything.<br/>
<br/>
And when it&#39;s the next playdate with some other child?<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor goes to all the local park days, even the unschooling one. She <br/>
and her kids are likely to know or recognize almost everyone we know. That <br/>
can&#39;t be a good enough reason why Jayn should be forced to share something, <br/>
sharing that amounts to giving it up completely.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s constant. Remember we spend over one third of our <br/>
time on nights, when we are not using the pool at all, and not having any <br/>
visitors. The other kids have free reign over the pool and courtyard then, <br/>
and we don&#39;t even know about it. They can&#39;t let us have it three or maybe <br/>
four afternoons over the course five weeks?<br/>
<br/>
I know I can&#39;t control this, but I just wish the mom would act to help her <br/>
kids feel better and maybe distract or explain, and not tell me that Jayn <br/>
has to be ordered to let them &quot;spoil&quot; (in Jayn&#39;s words) her playdate.<br/>

Oh, I hate moms like that.  Just yesterday I was thinking about a box  <br/>
my mom had had since she was little.  A wooden box, painted black.   <br/>
Plain pine, about a 14&quot; cube with a hinged lid.<br/>
<br/>
I left it in the orchard one day and the neighbors stole it.   A  <br/>
little girl said her brother had it under his bed.  My cousin and I  <br/>
got brave enough to go and knock on their door.<br/>
<br/>
I did feel sorry for that family.  Three or four kids in a two or  <br/>
three room adobe house with their parents, no toys that I ever knew  <br/>
of.  I asked the mom to check and see if he had a black wooden box  <br/>
under his bed.  She came back and said &quot;Yes, but he says it&#39;s   <br/>
his.&quot;   Huh.  I was nine years old or so, and probably argued a bit  <br/>
and then gave up.  My parents should have gone and gotten it, but I  <br/>
guess my  mom was afraid of confrontation with neighbors (afraid they  <br/>
might do worse than steal a box) or something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Robyn, as you and the other mom have mutual friends, maybe you could  <br/>
ask one or two of them to be witness and assistants,  maybe, in a  <br/>
discussion of the problem.  If you state your concerns to her in  <br/>
person with a witness of your choosing and one of hers, it&#39;s possible  <br/>
that good and sensible things will be said and boundaries  <br/>
established.  I&#39;d be glad to offer to be one of the people if I were  <br/>
nearer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762252334">Linnaea has a friend who has an older sister, well a couple of older sisters, but one in particular who often wants to come over. I regularly say no. Largely because Linnaea doesn&#39;t like this girl very much. She doesn&#39;t dislike her, and they can play well together, but Linnaea can get frustrated playing with her fairly quickly and a 6 hour playdate is much longer than she can sustain. Anyhow, when she does come over I tend to be the backup companion. I make sure I am there to be the friend and playmate to this older sister when I can see that Linnaea is ready to move away from playing with her. I have to be prepared to do that when I commit to having Linnaea&#39;s friend and her sister over. It may be that part of your commitment to having friends over for Jayn is to run distraction for these neighbors. Particularly as Jayn wants to remain friends with the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
Are there ways that you could circumvent their approach so that they didn&#39;t make it into the circle of activity? Are there things you can have as a &quot;just in case&quot; that would be interesting and engaging that you could do with the neighbor kids so that Jayn could get on and play with her guests? Could you time indoor activities for the moment when you see the neighbors approaching so that you could call Jayn and her guests in before any potentially negative interaction occurs? Y&#39;know things like calling them in for a snack or a movie or something, and talk it over with Jayn beforehand so that she might be more willing to exchange the pool for coming indoors when her play with these friends is going to be infringed upon by her neighbors. <br/>

It seems like it&#39;s always friends. The only time I have strain or pain with Jayn, it is some issue to do with friends. It is hard to live in apartments with common areas that everyone has rights to. It&#39;s hard to have neighbors that are inescapable. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843948887">I don&#39;t have any one particular thing to quote and write about directly,<br/>
so here goes...<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly the kind of family dynamic you are refering to.  We have<br/>
one of those in our neighborhood right now.  The girls are Margaux&#39;s<br/>
age, but Margaux won&#39;t have anything to do with them.<br/>
<br/>
We have a LOT of kids in our cul-de-sac right now that are all around<br/>
Margaux&#39;s age and they all seem to play with these two girls.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux&#39;s reason for not playing with them is because they don&#39;t play<br/>
nice, they have that typical school playground behavior, taunting,<br/>
bullying, and such.  On one occasion Margaux and another neighbor girl<br/>
were out trying to join their play and were mercilessly taunted and when<br/>
they tried to stand up for themselves in their child ways, the kids<br/>
tattled on them to their mother who, without having been involved at<br/>
all, yelled at Margaux and her friend and gave them that whole &quot;nobody<br/>
treats my kids that way&quot; kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux&#39;s friend lives right across the way from us and knows these<br/>
girls from school.  She doesn&#39;t play with them in school either because<br/>
she thinks they are mean.  There is an older lady that lives to doors<br/>
down from us (we have a very large cul-de-sac sort of thing with three<br/>
offshoots off the main one) that watches her grandson on a regular<br/>
basis.  She&#39;s outside a lot doing yardwork and sees and hears everything<br/>
in the neighborhood.  She absolutely will not let her grandson play with<br/>
these girls either because they threatened to kill him when they were<br/>
playing.  She lets him come play with Margaux though, actually he&#39;s a<br/>
cute kid who has a little kid crush on her, so I doubt she could keep<br/>
him away... but it goes to say that I&#39;m not the only one who observes<br/>
this behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t know why all the other kids put up with it and all the<br/>
other parents seem to be fine with this sort of behavior.  Most of them<br/>
are no where to be seen though, so I guess they don&#39;t know anything<br/>
about it.  I&#39;m not one of those kind of parents, I like to be present,<br/>
at least within earshot of neighborhood outdoor play when my daughter is<br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
While we were gone last week, we had new neighbors move in that live<br/>
right across the way from us that have kids Margaux&#39;s age.  She was<br/>
really excited to come home and meet them, but found out that those<br/>
neighbor girls walk them home from school each and every day, so Margaux<br/>
won&#39;t go out there to meet them.  When I tried to encourage her to go<br/>
out anyway, just to introduce herself, she said to me, &quot;mom, it&#39;s not<br/>
worth it, I have one nice friend and I&#39;m fine with only having one!&quot;. <br/>
So, point taken, but I gave her some things to say to the mean mom, if<br/>
she ever did decide to go out and play and got yelled at by her again. <br/>
I told her to put her hands on her hips and say loudly and firmly &quot;Do<br/>
not talk to me in that manner.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We live in a strange neighborhood.  The kids all run around completely<br/>
unsupervised and behave badly towards one another and all the other<br/>
parents seem fine with this until one of their own kids get hurt and<br/>
then they come out of their house all full of fire looking to blame<br/>
someone and yell at whatever child &quot;hurt&quot; their kid.  I&#39;ve seen it<br/>
happen over and over again, even though some have moved out and others<br/>
have moved in, this seems to be the standard mode of operation around<br/>
here.  I find it disgusting, so I&#39;m glad that Margaux has more self<br/>
respect than to put up with it!<br/>
<br/>
The one friend that she has, has an awesome mom, pretty young and<br/>
single, so her daughter is a daycare kid who has some of those kind of<br/>
obvious traights, but I love the mom anyway, she&#39;s by far the most<br/>
normal other person in our neighbor in regards to how she wathces and<br/>
monitors her daughter and her daughter&#39;s friends and actually seems to<br/>
care wether or not she&#39;s safe and getting along.  The kids spend equal<br/>
amount of time at each of our houses, which to me is a good sign that<br/>
things are cool, because we&#39;ve had other kids who only want to spend<br/>
time at our house because theirs sucks and my kid (I&#39;m more thinking of<br/>
Chamille here) thought so too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all for avoidance of kids and parents like the ones you describe. <br/>
Confrontation with that sort of parent never seems to go anywhere. <br/>
However, I did like Sandra&#39;s idea of having witnesses and a discussion,<br/>
although, in reality I wouldn&#39;t even begin to know how that would look<br/>
since I&#39;ve never gotten that far with a parent like that.<br/>
<br/>
Here, it is most definitely fall, the air is cold and wet and kids are<br/>
staying indoors.  Next summer will be more telling!  This cul-de-sac has<br/>
the most amount of kids than I&#39;ve ever seen in the 5 yrs that we&#39;ve<br/>
lived here, something like almost every single house has a kid or 2,<br/>
most of them elementary school age.  There are about 30 houses in this<br/>
little weird cul-de-sac.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770972203">I knew it the right thing to do, to come here with my emotionally charged <br/>
issue. I never cease to be amazed at the wisdom of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Here again is yet another instance of the extra mile unschooling parents <br/>
willingly walk.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Could you time indoor activities for the moment when you see the <br/>
neighbors approaching so that you could call Jayn and her guests in before <br/>
any potentially negative interaction occurs? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Schuyler, that sounds like several good ideas. It has been really hard to <br/>
get the other girls out of the pool - I suspect they don&#39;t get much <br/>
swimming. But I will work on that and get their mom on my side too.<br/>
<br/>
The running interference with the other kids - well first I have to get over <br/>
my own dislike of them. My brain has seized up with sleeplessness and relief <br/>
(I have heard back from the mom in response to my epistle - more below - <br/>
oooooh gossip - well not entirely) and right now I can&#39;t think of anything <br/>
that I could engage with them that would not be equally attractive to Jayn&#39;s <br/>
friends. Jayn is already frustrated when James gets out his nintendo or <br/>
other gadget and the moths fly to his flame. But it is worth some thought.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I am quite touched by your offer. I&#39;m not sure who I could ask about <br/>
mediating. I have a feeling there would already be a strong anti-Jayn <br/>
contingent primed. She fits in with the home schoolers. I so don&#39;t. I just <br/>
want to have as little connection as humanly possible while maintaining <br/>
reasonable politeness. I may have put the kibosh on it.<br/>
<br/>
Nor is it likely to be necessary to seek a mediator, since I have received a <br/>
rather backtracking email. Rather like some of the ones we see here when <br/>
people try to say, &quot;I didn&#39;t say that&quot;, but lo there it is in black and <br/>
white in the archives....unlike in the past, I am not going to stand by and <br/>
let her lie to me about what she intended. After calling Jayn names, I am <br/>
not allowing her to deny that she said it, by the simple expedient of <br/>
quoting her back to herself. She is also being entirely disingenous about <br/>
her dd&#39;s intention (not that I used those accusatory words to her), not <br/>
realizing that by quoting a conversation she had with K she has revealed her <br/>
full knowledge of K&#39;s plan to join in, not just exercise her right to swim.<br/>
<br/>
Amongst other stuff I sent this - I think all the BS of the recent past has <br/>
caught up with me. This is really approaching the end of the limb stuff for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
     &quot;Your description of your prepping conversation with Karine show that <br/>
you probably suspected there might be some kind of issue. Wouldn&#39;t it have <br/>
been         kinder to Karine, let alone Jayn,  for *you* to take the <br/>
initiative to check with Jayn and I first? We could been the ones talking it <br/>
over, shielding Karine from     Jayn&#39;s first fear, and then you could have <br/>
prepped Karine not to expect to be able to join Jayn, and I could have <br/>
reassured Jayn that Karine would not spoil     her playdate by going <br/>
swimming, so she would have been more welcoming.<br/>
<br/>
     When you have visitors these days I make it clear that Jayn must not <br/>
try to join in, even though she often has wanted to. I keep Jayn with me and <br/>
find stuff to     do. Beyond a quick word of hello, I discourage her from <br/>
watching. I sometimes even take her out if she seems to want to persist in <br/>
lurking on the balcony, in     order to protect your kids&#39; playtime from her <br/>
intensity. As I said, we are certain to have many common acquaintances, but <br/>
that is no reason for anyone to         believe they are entitled to an <br/>
invitation to play with the other&#39;s visitors. I should think that there are <br/>
enough disparate ages and interests that the friendships         need not <br/>
overlap so very much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I just got fed up, and recalling a hundred other slights, which truly I <br/>
though I had taken the high road on....and still some interesting <br/>
unschooling principles...<br/>
<br/>
    &quot;Just to touch on a slightly wider issue, you accuse us of being <br/>
inconsiderate. Yes it is true that everyone here has the *Right* to use the <br/>
pool at any time, and     it is a common area, just like the table and the <br/>
barbeque - but there is such a thing as kindness and generosity. We don&#39;t <br/>
always have to insist upon our             rights  every time, do we? We can <br/>
choose to step aside out of thoughtfulness for others and others&#39; rights, <br/>
and say to ourselves, &quot;Well there are some visitors     using the pool, and <br/>
since it is a relatively rare occurence, I can choose to take the higher <br/>
path and allow them to use it undisturbed.&quot; I have done that many <br/>
times over the years, even before you moved here, and guided Jayn in that <br/>
direction, and I know that others of our neighbors have also just refrained <br/>
from         intruding on someone&#39;s private swim, solitary or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
    I am reminded of the time when [her dh] came home quite early in the day <br/>
as the sun was high with A... & K..., and Jayn was swimming with her father. <br/>
These rare swims are always relatively brief since James gets cold quickly. <br/>
A... and K... immediately declared their intention of swimming. Jayn, in <br/>
soft,             gentle and kind words, as I stood near her, begged, begged <br/>
your kids to just let her finish her swim alone with her dad, just for <br/>
another 10 minutes until he         got out. They refused. [Her dh] backed <br/>
them up citing their &quot;right&quot; to swim.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I moved on to repeating my request for her to tell me when she is going <br/>
to be out, so that maybe I can get in one more swimming playdate before we <br/>
go onto nights and the pool goes off at Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
So in the spirit of Mea Culpa... I&#39;m not sure that I have done the right <br/>
thing.  But gosh I feel better for not taking the appeasement route just <br/>
this once.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Linnaea has a friend who has an older sister, well a couple of older <br/>
sisters, but one in particular who often wants to come over. I regularly say <br/>
no. Largely because Linnaea doesn&#39;t like this girl very much. She doesn&#39;t <br/>
dislike her, and they can play well together, but Linnaea can get frustrated <br/>
playing with her fairly quickly and a 6 hour playdate is much longer than <br/>
she can sustain. Anyhow, when she does come over I tend to be the backup <br/>
companion. I make sure I am there to be the friend and playmate to this <br/>
older sister when I can see that Linnaea is ready to move away from playing <br/>
with her. I have to be prepared to do that when I commit to having Linnaea&#39;s <br/>
friend and her sister over. It may be that part of your commitment to having <br/>
friends over for Jayn is to run distraction for these neighbors. <br/>
Particularly as Jayn wants to remain friends with the neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
Are there ways that you could circumvent their approach so that they didn&#39;t <br/>
make it into the circle of activity? Are there things you can have as a <br/>
&quot;just in case&quot; that would be interesting and engaging that you could do with <br/>
the neighbor kids so that Jayn could get on and play with her guests? Y&#39;know <br/>
things like calling them in for a snack or a movie or something, and talk it <br/>
over with Jayn beforehand so that she might be more willing to exchange the <br/>
pool for coming indoors when her play with these friends is going to be <br/>
infringed upon by her neighbors.<br/>

It seems like it&#39;s always friends. The only time I have strain or pain with <br/>
Jayn, it is some issue to do with friends. It is hard to live in apartments <br/>
with common areas that everyone has rights to. It&#39;s hard to have neighbors <br/>
that are inescapable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That makes complete sense!  I haven&#39;t experienced that within a<br/>
homeschool group, however, I tend to avoid those for the most part<br/>
because Margaux has only wanted to play with me and Chamille hasn&#39;t made<br/>
any connections with school at home kids, except for when she was in<br/>
GS&#39;s but there are very specific ways to handle social stuff within that<br/>
context!<br/>
<br/>
Next week we&#39;ve decided to go to a local unschool meet-up.  Our very<br/>
first ever for Margaux and only because it is something that Margaux<br/>
wanted to do when I proposed it to her.  There is one person on this<br/>
yahoo group that is going too, and so that&#39;s  cool.  Maybe it will be a<br/>
whole new cool thing for us!  ...and it&#39;s unschoolers, not school at<br/>
homers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the eternal optimist!  While things do get me down sometimes, I am<br/>
always hopefully optimistic about every new thing!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
I might try to talk to her face to face as well.  Even if you do not<br/>
have other moms to help mediate, emails so often lend themselves to be<br/>
misinterpreted.  If you/she are expecting conflict, disagreement,<br/>
discord (not sure what word I am looking for), sometimes it is easy to<br/>
find in an email.  Then the reader will sit and stew on it rather than<br/>
be able to ask for the more immediate feedback or clarification of a<br/>
face to face conversation.<br/>
<br/>
If your intention is not to cut off all contact with the neighbor kids<br/>
- you have to live near them after all - perhaps you could plan a<br/>
special playdate as some sort of peace offering for all 5 of the<br/>
children to play and swim together.  Perhaps that could ease the hurt<br/>
feelings of the neighbor children or perception of them on the part of<br/>
your neighbor-mom.  That offered at the same time as a request for<br/>
some private time on another day may be more well received than a<br/>
&quot;when will you not be home so the three girls can play together<br/>
without your two bothering them&quot; email - (only meant as one possible<br/>
misinterpretation of email correspondence).<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find a peaceful and all around acceptable resolution!! <br/>
Donna</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Donna. I hadn&#39;t envisaged that particular interpretation, but I <br/>
can see that it is very plausible.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh I wish I had posted initially before I made any contact at all!<br/>
<br/>
The kids did all swim together for a while a bit later, btw. Jayn was very <br/>
unhappy and struggling to hide it and be funny and lively - but later she <br/>
was crying a lot.<br/>
