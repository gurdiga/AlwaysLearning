<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425228547">I think a lot of the time when we are talking about unschooling lives to<br/>
family that just don&#39;t get it, the words we use makes a great impact.  We<br/>
can either play up the learning processes involved or simply describe a task<br/>
and still be truthfully talking about the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I have mentioned that my little guys chose to go to Kindergarten this year.<br/>
They were supposed to bring apples to school.  They took turns weighing the<br/>
apples and seeing which type was heavier or lighter, etc..  This is<br/>
obviously learning and we describe it as such talking to grandparents,<br/>
family, etc..<br/>
<br/>
When we go to the grocery store, the kids have weighed produce in the scales<br/>
since they were old enough to put it in.  We talked about whether carrots or<br/>
grapes weighed more, etc..  But when talking to family about what we did, I<br/>
would more likely say &quot;Oh, we just did some grocery shopping.&quot;  It is still<br/>
obviously learning but we don&#39;t tend to describe it that way when talking to<br/>
people.  The only difference is that at home, Danny didn&#39;t have to wait four<br/>
days for all the kids at his table to remember their apples before he could<br/>
weigh his &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>

&gt; Suggest he read &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting,&quot; by Frank Smith.**<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree with Nancy that this is a great book.  It&#39;s the scientific basis<br/>
of a lot of my anti-school opinions.  And it&#39;s pretty short, 102 pages,<br/>
which is an advantage if you try to get a spouse or other relative to read<br/>
it.<br/>
