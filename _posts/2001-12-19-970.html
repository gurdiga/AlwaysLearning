higher power, a<br/>
universal force (Luke, Luke...)  for good or evil as<br/>
we choose to use it.<br/>

<br/>
May The Force be with you. ROTFL!! Okay, this is sort<br/>
of what I believe. I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a &#39;higher<br/>
power&#39; but I do believe there&#39;s energy (a force?) out<br/>
in the universe that we can tap into if we choose to.<br/>
I believe in re-incarnation, spirit guides and the<br/>
like. I also believe that we are in no way superior to<br/>
any other life form on this earth (or on another<br/>
planet - but that&#39;s another subject altogether!). I<br/>
think we all have a different function, no matter how<br/>
small. We are all connected in the &#39;web&#39; (as in<br/>
spider&#39;s, not internet &lt;g&gt;). It&#39;s terribly sad to see<br/>
the &#39;web&#39; being ripped apart by thoughtless and greedy<br/>
actions. <br/>

Why are you asking us?  You need to watch the Star Wars trilogy again and pay <br/>
special attention to Darth Vader! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know people who think prayer can. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, yes.  &quot;Smite them!&quot;<br/>
The Holy Hand-Grenade of Antioch scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail <br/>
comes to mind.<br/>
<br/>
LAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade. <br/>
ARTHUR: Yes, of course! The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch! &#39;Tis one of the <br/>
sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him! Brother Maynard! Bring up the <br/>
Holy Hand Grenade! <br/>
[singing]<br/>
How does it, uh... how does it work? <br/>
???: I know not, my liege. <br/>
???: Consult the Book of Armaments! <br/>
MAYNARD: Armaments, Chapter Two, Verses Nine to Twenty-One. <br/>
BROTHER: &quot;And Saint Atila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, &#39;Oh, <br/>
Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thy enemies <br/>
to tiny bits, in thy mercy.&#39; And the Lord did grin, and people did feast upon <br/>
the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast <br/>
cereals, and fruit bats, and large --&quot; <br/>
MAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother. <br/>
BROTHER: &quot;And the Lord spake, saying, &#39;First shalt thou take out the Holy <br/>
Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shalt be the <br/>
number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shalt be three. Four <br/>
shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then <br/>
proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third <br/>
number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch <br/>
towards thou foe, who being naughtir! <br/>
ARTHUR: Three! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is. Read up on the LDS church (Mormons). Their hidden way down deep in <br/>
the dogma belief is not that we&#39;re prisoners, but it does involve a faraway <br/>
planet called Kolob where spirit-gods (all good Mormons) reside before <br/>
taking human form.<br/>
<br/>
Scientology is also based on Earth as a colony of beings from another place. <br/>
I don&#39;t think you get to learn this until you&#39;ve paid a lot of money and <br/>
gotten into the highest levels of their &quot;education&quot;, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re likening the force to the Tao it&#39;s not the same as the idea of <br/>
prayer or a god. You don&#39;t use it per se, you are a part of it. It is a part <br/>
of you. Here&#39;s a link to Zen and the Ocean which describes it nicely. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see my link didn&#39;t work the way I wanted it to. You&#39;ll have to click on <br/>
Tao Stories and then Zen and the Ocean. Better yet, here it is:<br/>
<br/>
Zen and the Ocean:<br/>
Once upon a time, a young fish asked an old fish: &quot;Everyone talks about this <br/>
thing they call &#39;ocean.&#39; What the heck is it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The older and wiser fish answered: &quot;The ocean is this thing that surrounds <br/>
you on all sides.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The younger fish didn&#39;t understand: &quot;There&#39;s nothing around me! Why can I <br/>
not see this &#39;ocean?&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Of course you cannot,&quot; the old fish was patient. &quot;The ocean is both inside <br/>
and outside of you. You were born in the ocean and chances are you will die <br/>
in it. The ocean flows around you, just as your own skin does.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
     Confucius once said, &quot;Fish forget they live in water; people<br/>
     forget they live in the Tao.&quot; We all live in the ocean of Zen.<br/>
     It flows over us; it is within us and all around us. It enfolds<br/>
     us like our own skin, and yet we cannot perceive it... indeed,<br/>
     most of us have no idea what it is. Let us think of Zen as the<br/>
     universal flow of reality. This will take us another step<br/>
     toward true understanding of Zen.<br/>
