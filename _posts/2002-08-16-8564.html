<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some new experimental research has shown some interesting stuff with babies<br/>
&gt; in utero. Apparantly we learn about tastes while still in the womb.<br/>
&gt; Researchers fed mothers lots of carrot juice during the last half of<br/>
&gt; pregnancy and those babies whose moms had had the juice responded<br/>
&gt; positively to cereal flavored with carrot when they were 4 months old as<br/>
&gt; opposed to the babies whose mothers had a regular diet. There are other<br/>
&gt; studies as well. But it does help explain why Indian kids happily munch<br/>
&gt; their way thru spicy curries from infancy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love food and eat a wider variety (no pickiness here unfortunately for my<br/>
&gt; bum:) and my kids are all open to eating all kinds of things. I think taste<br/>
&gt; is something that develops from an early age but does change regularly over<br/>
&gt; the years.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow Kate, that sounds really interesting. Do you have a reference for that <br/>
research? I&#39;m currently working on a weaning information leaflet for our <br/>
breastfeeding group & it would be great if I could quote some of that <br/>
research.<br/>
One thing that puzzles me though is why my 9 month old dd can tolerate & even <br/>
enjoy hotter (spicier) dishes than I can. But then I&#39;m pretty timid when it <br/>
comes to hot curries! lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604935080">I have the one article I primarily referred to at work and will look for<br/>
it. Right now we are still on holiday so if you can give me a few more days<br/>
please:)<br/>
Perhaps a search in Igenta or Medline might turn it up though if you are in<br/>
a hurry.<br/>
