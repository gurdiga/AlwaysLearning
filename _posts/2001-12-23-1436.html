I think so. Except as something pretty, like calligraphy. <br/>
<br/>
Zoe learned to read cursive just the same as reading everything else - took <br/>
her a little longer. She likes to write her name in cursive though.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Is a person considered illiterate if they can&#39;t read cursive? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
I gave a gift with a mushy card to a friend of mine (public schooled) when he <br/>
was 22, just a few years back.  He couldn&#39;t read the card.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How would an unschooler ever get the desire to learn it if they never run<br/>
across it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first time my boys brought me cursive to read it was a letter in a puzzle <br/>
book--one of those &quot;find the key&quot; adventure books with way more art than <br/>
text.  But one of the puzzles was a cursive note.  They were fine on the <br/>
logic and math, but the cursive was a big puzzle. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly thinks cursive is interesting and so she&#39;ll practice words or ask how <br/>
to connect one particular letter.  She wanted some practice paper to show her <br/>
how far up different lines went.  I found some on sale at the university <br/>
bookstore.  She hasn&#39;t really used it yet.<br/>
<br/>
The little electronic spell-checker we got her for her birthday in November <br/>
will write a word out in cursive, slowly, so you can watch, after it gives <br/>
you the spelling and the definition.<br/>
<br/>
When I leave notes for the kids I print if it&#39;s for Marty or Holly, and Kirby <br/>
seems to have picked up reading cursive, or at least my version of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. Or at least it&#39;s fast becoming obsolete as a well-used written form of <br/>
communication. I write in a sort of half print/half cursive hybrid. My <br/>
husband can&#39;t write in cursive at all. Conor has no desire to learn and I <br/>
think his energies would be better spent in learning how to type faster. <br/>
Casey has been practicing cursive since she was 4. She thinks it&#39;s cool.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was reading a Christmas card to my son the other day.  I was reading it to<br/>
&gt; him because it was written in long hand, cursive, and my son doesn&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; how to read it or write it. Later when we were talking about the makeup of<br/>
&gt; his 1750 point Warhammer 40k army and I was looking at his draftsman like<br/>
&gt; printing of his list, I panicked. Those ugly fears that --I know how to do<br/>
&gt; something that he doesn&#39;t --grabbed me and I asked him if he was interested<br/>
&gt; in learning how to read or write cursive.  He said &quot;yeah that would be<br/>
&gt; interesting, but not now.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I started thinking...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is cursive obsolete?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t use it. My written communication with him [and everyone else] is<br/>
&gt; either typed on the computer or handwritten printing, the way I prefer to<br/>
&gt; write. The only place my son runs across cursive is in letters from his aunt<br/>
&gt; and uncle.  His reading is almost exclusively printed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is a person considered illiterate if they can&#39;t read cursive?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How would an unschooler ever get the desire to learn it if they never run<br/>
&gt; across it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We didn&#39;t have much to do with his learning handwritten printing.  I now<br/>
&gt; marvel at how he forms letters, mostly starting at their bottoms. Nothing<br/>
&gt; like the uniform way the public school taught me. He prefers unlined paper.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know what he would use as a model if he did have a desire.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone here have experience with this?   It seems like something a<br/>
&gt; person could easily pick up if there was a need.  But what if that need<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t arrive until some vitally urgent bit of information needs to be<br/>
&gt; understood with no time for the learning?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So is cursive obsolete?  Did any of your kids learn cursive?  How?  Why?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Dan Vilter<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I write notes in cursive for my son about half of the time, figuring he&#39;ll <br/>
practice reading it.  Ultimately it helps to know how to read cursive.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s one of my pet peeves. Both my ex-husband, Julian&#39;s dad, and my <br/>
partner have illegible signatures that involve writing part of their names <br/>
and making a messy line for the rest. If we try to cash a child support check <br/>
at the bank they ALWAYS have to have the signature card faxed.  I hate it. <br/>
<br/>
So I told Julian that it was MY stuff, but that I really wanted him to learn <br/>
to write a legible signature in cursive. I don&#39;t care if he ever writes <br/>
anything else in cursive. Since it was my agenda (although he agreed how <br/>
inconvenient it can be dealing with the bank), I bribed him. We agreed on a <br/>
certain number of pages of practice signatures and I offered him something he <br/>
wanted. (I don&#39;t remember what it was now, but he thought it was worth it.)  <br/>
He did it, he got his prize, and he can now legibly sign his name.  I never <br/>
felt strongly enough about another piece of knowledge or skill, figuring it <br/>
wasn&#39;t important. But the kid can write his name. <br/>

P.S. His printing is also messy, but I can deal with that. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My grandmother could ONLY write in cursive. She said she could read the <br/>
printed word but had no idea where to start to form the letters. Her school <br/>
said that it was easier and better to learn the fluid moves of cursive rather <br/>
than picking up the pen on each stroke in print.<br/>
<br/>
One of my friends, a used-to-be teacher, said that she was forced to teach <br/>
cursive to 3rd or 4th graders. She told the kids that it was ridiculous. If <br/>
they all learned how to sign their names in cursive, they would be fine. So <br/>
they sat writing their signatures during &quot;cursive period&quot;. She said that all <br/>
the children had really interesting and fun signatures.<br/>
<br/>
The Germans have a writing in-between print and cursive. Kind of like the <br/>
printed words are connected.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After I read this cursive stuff here today, I went and wrote some things for <br/>
Holly and Marty.  Holly, who is just a beginning reader, was interpreting the <br/>
cursive better than Marty was.  But later Marty was reading aloud to me from <br/>
a Dork Tower comic (a hard passage, truly) and was having some difficulties <br/>
pronouncing long words he hadn&#39;t heard aloud before (naturally), so it&#39;s not <br/>
clear what was what.  <br/>
<br/>
The main problem they (Marty/Holly) had was telling an &quot;o&quot; from an &quot;a&quot; (not <br/>
caring that an o always comes off the top) and thinking that there were w&#39;s <br/>
everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I remember very sweetly the day a few years ago that Holly tested to see <br/>
whether cursive was real writing and not just scribbling.  She whispered <br/>
something in my ear for me to write down, and told me to stay there and be <br/>
quiet.  She took it in the other room for her dad to read aloud.  We passed <br/>
the test, as did cursive.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So is cursive obsolete?  Did any of your kids learn cursive?  How?  <br/>
&gt; Why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cacie started coming across cursive in books every so often, usually when<br/>
the book is trying to make a word or note look handwritten. I believe she<br/>
found it in both Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter books, among others.<br/>
Sometimes she&#39;d want to read a card or letter from someone who wrote in<br/>
cursive, too. For a while I read stuff to her, then she started reading<br/>
it to herself. I&#39;m not sure how well she reads it now, I think well<br/>
enough to figure most things out.<br/>
<br/>
She learned to write her name in cursive a couple of years ago, it was<br/>
All The Rage among her little clique of friends. She got kind of into it,<br/>
sort of letter by letter, then her dad came to visit, saw what she was<br/>
doing, and apprently tried to teach her more than she wanted to know and<br/>
that was it - I found the paper she had been writing on with &quot;Dad&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Butterfly&quot; on it in his handwriting, and scribbles through all of it. <br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, a few weeks ago she was writing on the whiet baord and asked<br/>
me how to make a couple of letters in cursive, and she messed with it a<br/>
bit and then asked it I&#39;d write one new letter on the board every day for<br/>
her to copy, which worked until the F crisis earlier this month (since I<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to make capital F&#39;s in cursive, although thanks to the<br/>
webpage someone sent I do now :-). By then she apparently had a critical<br/>
mass, since she&#39;d been asking for other letters too, so now she wrotes a<br/>
new message on the board every couple days in cursive (&quot;i love grandpa&quot;<br/>
is there now, along with &quot;mint tea&quot; on the grocery list), and mostly<br/>
she&#39;ll ask me how to do one or two letters first. She probably has about<br/>
85% of the lower case ones down now, and she knows how to connect them...<br/>
I don&#39;t think she knows many capitals.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t write much at all, I think cursive is more art to her than<br/>
writing... <br/>
<br/>
I think it sometimes makes life easier to be able to read it, sort of<br/>
like it sometimes makes life easier to be able to tell time on an analog<br/>
clock, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s essential, except perhaps for a<br/>
signature... but I knew a guy whose legal signature was a line with one<br/>
loop in it, and he didn&#39;t need cursive for that... anyway, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have worried if she hadn&#39;t learned it.<br/>

writing letters.  <br/>
He asked about it.  I told him some people write this way and banks like<br/>
you to sign checks this way.  He asked what his name would look like in<br/>
cursive and I showed him.  He practiced it and now signs his name on<br/>
cards, etc, in cursive but doesn&#39;t write that way.  I don&#39;t think he ever<br/>
tried anything beyond his name.  <br/>
His printing is very stylized and beautiful so I thought he&#39;d like<br/>
cursive, but he&#39;s nine now, and doesn&#39;t seem at all interested in it.  He<br/>
can&#39;t read it, as far as I know and  doesn&#39;t seem to care.<br/>
I just work on the theory he&#39;ll learn it when he wants to, or needs to. <br/>
