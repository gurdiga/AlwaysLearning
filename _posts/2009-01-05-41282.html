<div id="ygrps-yiv-927092030">This is one of the coolest projects I&#39;ve ever seen.  It&#39;s analysis of  <br/>
various superheroes and some other comic book characters, with  <br/>
evidence about their religious affiliation or beliefs.    If you&#39;re  <br/>
not interested yourself, I bet you could think of someone who is-- <br/>
some comic-book-collecting friend of yours somewhere in your life.<br/>

Now I have something else to add to my new religion page, but I&#39;m not  <br/>
going to do it tonight.  I&#39;m tired.<br/>
