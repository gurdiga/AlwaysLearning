<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093981389">Hi everyone,<br/>
Don&#39;t forget that registration for the October Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference in St. Louis, MO is open.  Just go to <br/>

 <br/>
It is a wonderful conference full of Unschoolers from all over. Now is  your <br/>
chance to hear unschooling speakers, be with unschooling families and  just <br/>
immerse yourself in unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
ALSO we are looking for unique vendors/exhibitors.  If you have a  product of <br/>
service you would like to put out there for other Unschoolers there  are <br/>
several ways you can participate:<br/>
1) Exhibit Booth at the Conference<br/>
2) Exhibitor  Facetime<br/>
3) Conference Handbook  Advertising<br/>
4) Brochure Bag<br/>
 <br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html)">http://www.liveandlearnconference.org/exhibitors.html)</a>  for  all the details.<br/>
 <br/>
Think outside the box, think like Unschoolers...<br/>
If you have an idea or thought please e mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:_genant2@...">_genant2@...</a>_ <br/>
(mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:genant2@...">genant2@...</a>)  and we will see if we can make  it happen.  If you have an <br/>
idea but are unsure if it will be profitable, e  mail me and we will talk and <br/>
see what we can come up with. <br/>
 <br/>
This conference is NOT like all other homeschooling conferences.   We DO NOT <br/>
want the usual curriculum vendors we want Unschoolers.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
And now back to your normal programming.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837943775">I was just at your website looking around seeing if we could<br/>
make the conference this year (that all depends upon air fares!!)<br/>
when I saw you were looking for a So CA location for 2007 and<br/>
I just had to share our families recent hotel/resort experience!<br/>
<br/>
This week we were down in San Diego (about 1 1/2 hrs from us)<br/>
where we stayed overnight at the coolest resort ever (for us<br/>
anyhow LOL). It is called the Paradise Point Hotel and all my<br/>
daughter I and could think that this would make a great place<br/>
to hold a conference!  Its an all inclusive kind of place<br/>
with lush vegetation, five pools, ponds everywhere throughout,<br/>
sand volleyball court, basketball, right on the beach in<br/>
Mission Bay, bike and skate rentals, putting range and free<br/>
croquet, mini market, boat rentals etc.  It was just so<br/>
neat. But what I thought was incredible was how many<br/>
families I saw there! I have four kids, one is a toddler<br/>
who is very mobile and never content to sit for long.<br/>
It was very cool to me that these families had all these<br/>
young kids and mine wasn&#39;t the only one getting into stuff<br/>
(ok so mine was the only one wandering around ) but other<br/>
kids were spilling there water etc!  They do have a<br/>
conference center and I don&#39;t know what the rates are.<br/>
The regular rates are $159 but the conference rate<br/>
might be much better. This by the way puts you right on<br/>
the beach for that price. The suites are much more<br/>
epensive.  Anyhow I just had to mention this place and<br/>
to share with anyone who might visit San Diego to check<br/>
this place out!  www.paradisepoint.com<br/>
