Anyone watching the convention?<br/>

Anyone have a kid watching, without coercing them to do so?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429278089">We watched a bit including Clinton&#39;s speech.  Brenna (14) is a huge Kerry <br/>
supporter and just got a bumper sticker she ordered which she put  on our van.  <br/>
She was online but kept walking in and out of the room with a smile on her face <br/>
as Clinton made several of his points.  Logan (11) asked alot of questions <br/>
and it all led to a conversation about how you get to go to the convention.<br/>
<br/>
Logan mostly noticed things like....&quot;all the people up front have signs but <br/>
fewer of the people in the back have signs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Brenna has asked if we can go to a local restaurant on Thursday night that is <br/>
having an event to celebrate Kerry accepting the nomination.  Sounds like fun <br/>
and I wrote it down so I wouldn&#39;t forget.<br/>
