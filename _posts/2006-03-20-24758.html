<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146904096">Living in an expat enclave in conservative Hong Kong, I am surrounded by <br/>
boring, staid,  overly &quot;nice&quot;, closed minded &quot;successful&quot; professionals and <br/>
their wives/husbands and I&#39;m desperate for more craziness in my life.  I <br/>
miss my sister terribly after reading your posts as she&#39;s the kind of person <br/>
who do all those mad sorts of things including dying her hair pink!  She <br/>
always helped me to let go and be silly!  But she lives in New Zealand, ho <br/>
hum.<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to think of something crazy I&#39;d done with my kids recently <br/>
(apart from wearing some pretty funny dress-ups...) and I have to say I <br/>
can&#39;t really think of anything, and that&#39;s been an eye opener for me - I <br/>
need to get more silly (and work less, trying to do that...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going to like being part of this list since it&#39;s <br/>
exactly what I&#39;m looking for as I embark on the wonderful, scary, exciting <br/>
and yes, crazy, adventure of unschooling my little girls (4 1/2 and 16 <br/>
months).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &quot; I have to say I am glad I was picked as<br/>
&gt; the normal mom.  :)  sometimes you are not sure which one you are. LOL&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HA! MY kids decided *I* was the crazy Mom and they wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
&gt; handle a &quot;normal&quot; Mom so I am forbidden to ever participate in that<br/>
&gt; show. :)<br/>
&gt; It probably didn&#39;t help diffuse my &quot;crazy&quot; image when I jumped in the<br/>
&gt; bathtub with Jalen and Sierra last week...fully clothed.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; LOL... Now I know why I love  this list... other people that are fun crazy <br/>
&gt; and don&#39;t follow rules... some recent silly stuff we have done include:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  a bath tub full of jello<br/>
&gt;  a snow ball fight inside the car<br/>
&gt;  a muddy puddle war in WalMarts parking lot<br/>
&gt;  Letting my 4yr old put make up on me while we waited for our meal at a <br/>
&gt; local &quot;upscale&quot; Mexican restaurant ( she also spoke only Spanish the whole <br/>
&gt; time which would not be that weird except she only knows words she learned <br/>
&gt; from Dora the Explorer and she used none of them correctly just strung <br/>
&gt; them all together :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  anyone else want to share some wacky adventures?  to show my kids I am <br/>
&gt; not alone in my wackyness!!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Please Read This Before You Go Back To Your Local Supermarket!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You wouldn&#39;t go into a car dealer and pay the sticker price so why in<br/>
&gt; the world would you pay full price for your groceries and other<br/>
&gt; expenses? This was the sentence that I overheard that really caught<br/>
&gt; my attention. At the end of our school&#39;s PTA meeting, several of us<br/>
&gt; began talking about the soaring costs of everything, one of the<br/>
&gt; members told us how she is saving a tremendous amount of money on<br/>
&gt; groceries, eating out, pictures and just about everything else you<br/>
&gt; could imagine. To make a long story short, she said she joined a<br/>
&gt; program at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://couponsforlife.com">http://couponsforlife.com</a> She told us that the sampler<br/>
&gt; package includes savings on just about everything you could imagine.<br/>
&gt; I was shocked she joined since I have known this woman a very long<br/>
&gt; time and she has always been a huge skeptic. I asked her what made<br/>
&gt; her decide to join this. She told me she checked the company out with<br/>
&gt; the better business bureau who verified that they have been in<br/>
&gt; business since Oct. 1983 and they have an outstanding record with<br/>
&gt; them. She said she also checked them out with Paypal who processes<br/>
&gt; their payments and Paypal informed her that the company has provided<br/>
&gt; all business paperwork, and has had several thousand customers<br/>
&gt; through their payment process. They went on to say that they offer a<br/>
&gt; guarantee for this company&#39;s products. In her words, that was enough<br/>
&gt; for her to try them out and she &quot;has never been happier with a<br/>
&gt; company&#39;s products&quot; in her life. The rest of us couldn&#39;t wait to sign<br/>
&gt; up. She showed us some receipts in her bag and savings were eye<br/>
&gt; popping!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
