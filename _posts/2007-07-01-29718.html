Keith and I sing with a madrigal group sometimes, and this last year  <br/>
we performed $250 worth.  I hate that.  I only want to do things for  <br/>
free, and not for obligation.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, we called it &quot;singing.&quot;  And we called it &quot;rehearsing&quot;  <br/>
the last two times, because we were timing the performance and  <br/>
deciding who needed to stand where when and who would start which  <br/>
song how.<br/>
<br/>
We talk in terms of learning a new song, or working on a song, or  <br/>
running through a song (when it&#39;s one we know well but haven&#39;t done  <br/>
for a while).<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine who&#39;s taking voice lessons told me today she&#39;s  <br/>
working on a new aria for a competition in Greeley.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Practice&quot; seems to be something adults inflict on kids.  I think  <br/>
it&#39;s a bad idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517093453">I don&#39;t really have that association of practice as something unpleasant that is forced by someone else on an unwilling participant.  I tend to use the word &quot;practice&quot; to differentiate a specific mindset and approach to my time with the guitar, as opposed to playing through pieces, or performing (sidenote: sometimes I practice performing...to work specifically on the skills associated with performing).  When I practice guitar, I am usually looking really closely at some element of my playing, and trying to think analytically about how I am working to improve it.  When I&#39;m playing, I&#39;m trying not to be analytical, but to allow the analytical skill set/framework that I built while practicing to give me a foundation for expression.  Ahem--all that to say that I think the word &quot;practicing,&quot; when applied to a willing participant who (like me) really enjoys the analytical thinking and the technical work, isn&#39;t a negative term.  However I can definitely see how all the years of<br/>
 people being told to practice has given it a negative connotation.  The fact is, if you don&#39;t absolutely love doing it (working in that analytical manner at technique, or on a specific section of a piece of music, or whatever), it&#39;ll be awful.  If you do, though, it&#39;s another tool in the bag to improve musicianship.  <br/>
  I hope that&#39;s another helpful viewpoint.  Oh, an add-on thought:  I teach guitar at a music store, and I would always much rather a kid have fun with the instrument then trudge unhappily through required practice time.  I would rather someone say their kid wants to take a few months break, rather than send the kid in feeling like they&#39;ve failed because they didn&#39;t want to play guitar this week.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918585272">We all know that &quot;practice&quot; can mean doing an activity over and over  <br/>
in order to build skills that are then used in the &quot;real&quot; thing.  <br/>
Soccer practice is not a game, it is working on developing skills and  <br/>
building endurance in order to better play the game.<br/>
<br/>
But, like the word &quot;teach,&quot; it is a very useful practice (sorry,  <br/>
couldn&#39;t resist &lt;g&gt;), for parents to omit the word from their  <br/>
vocabulary. It kind of forces us to think along different lines -  <br/>
pushes out of a rut in our thinking.<br/>

When we started unschooling 5 years ago, this is actually the first thing  <br/>
that I changed that helped me with understanding some of paradigm  shifts that <br/>
would helpful for me to make.  My children were then 9 and  13 and we were all <br/>
taking piano lessons and we all &quot;practiced&quot; several times a  week to be ready <br/>
for our weekly lessons which involved walking next door to my  sister&#39;s house. <br/>
 It was quickly evident to me that when we each just at  down and played <br/>
around at the piano we were having much more fun than when we  practiced for the <br/>
lessons.  <br/>
 <br/>
I just stopped using the word &quot;practice&quot; and replaced it with&quot; playing&quot; and  <br/>
stopped reminding anyone (including myself) that I needed to play to get ready <br/>
 for the next lesson.  The piano playing evolved.  We all eventually  stopped <br/>
taking lessons but both kids have continued with music in a gradual fun  way. <br/>
 My daughter sings and plays the guitar and my son plays the drums and  <br/>
guitar.  Both have taken some other lessons but truly play for the  enjoyment of it <br/>
when they feel like it.  I think if they had continued  to &quot;practice&quot; with my <br/>
reminders on any instrument, they would have long ago  stopped playing.<br/>
 <br/>
Both children (now 14 and almost 18)  have this deep understanding and  love <br/>
of music from just experimenting and playing together that completely  eludes <br/>
me.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because my &quot;older&quot; age &lt;g&gt; or  just my years of <br/>
schooling that I have yet to conquer.  <br/>
