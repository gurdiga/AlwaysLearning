<div id="ygrps-yiv-748350536">Today&#39;s Just Add Light and Stir went out with a quote from Jenny Cyphers:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Emotional health and emotional well-being are as important, if not more so, as physical health.  —Jenny Cyphers-=-<br/>
<br/>
I got the whole e-mail back (as happens sometimes, by accident) with this forwarding note:  -=-Thoughts? Do you agree or disagree -=-<br/>
But the person accidentally replied instead of forwarding.  It happens fairly often, and it&#39;s interesting for me to see what people have written to a spouse, or sibling, or friend.  Usually it&#39;s positive (this is great, or you&#39;ll like this).<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;m sifting through a huge collection of writing, I wouldn&#39;t put anything up that&#39;s not already twice good—written, collected, saved, found again, chosen and shared.  I guess that&#39;s way more than &quot;twice good.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Emotional well-being, as many people know, can&#39;t be separated from physical well-being.  Worshipers of the King James Bible sometimes think the soul/spirit is separate from the body and that instincts.  Worshipers of &quot;nutrition&quot; think that bodies are built of molecules and unaffected by fear, shame or control, but anyone who&#39;s studied the least bit of child development knows that&#39;s not true.<br/>
<br/>
When something is solid truth,  it just keeps getting truer, though. :-)  This month, a new discovery about the nervous system/brain and the lymph system is in the news.<br/>

<br/>
So I suppose the thing about Jenny&#39;s statement that could be questioned is whether emotional health can be separated from physical health. :-)   It can, because the language and measurements are created by people, and they&#39;re measuring what they can see, and want to see, and have defined as important. <br/>
