Someone quoted Joyce this morning, and I responded, partly out of fear.<br/>
<br/>
The quote:<br/>
<br/>
‎&quot;The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be  <br/>
who she is and blossom into who she will become. Learning happens as a  <br/>
side effect.&quot; ---Joyce Fetteroll.<br/>
<br/>
My response:<br/>
<br/>
********<br/>
God, I love Joyce, but I don&#39;t love this quote taken in isolation.   <br/>
Too many unschooling families are neglecting to create/find/encourage  <br/>
learning oportunities.  (Not Joyce&#39;s.)  Too many unschooling families  <br/>
seem to outright REJECT things that remind the parents in any way of  <br/>
school.  Museums.  Books.  Documentary films.  Games that have  <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; anywhere on the box.<br/>
<br/>
If the very first goal of unschooling is to create a learning  <br/>
environment, all the other good things WILL happen.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is seen as all-but learning, everything except  <br/>
learning, it&#39;s carts before horses.  The cart won&#39;t get far without  <br/>
learning as a goal.<br/>
<br/>
I agree about &quot;education.&quot;  I don&#39;t like the term.  It&#39;s seen as a set  <br/>
of knowledge separate from other things in the world.  But this quote  <br/>
laid out for anyone to find will &quot;support&quot; and encourage the &quot;woohoo!&quot;  <br/>
unschoolers and could cause more problems for the support lists on  <br/>
which Joyce so generously volunteers to help people understand it.<br/>
<br/>
I think when unschooling works well, learning is a side effect of  <br/>
everything.  Unfortunately, it is possible for learning not to work  <br/>
well.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m undecided whether I mean for that last phrase to say &quot;...for  <br/>
unschooling not to work well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Both are possible.<br/>
<br/>
Unless and until the parents deschool, they will see &quot;learning&quot; as  <br/>
&quot;school-stuff.&quot;<br/>
And natural learning doesn&#39;t work well until the parents see real,  <br/>
natural learning in real, natural situations.<br/>
And unschooling doesn&#39;t work until natural learning is flowing and  <br/>
being appreciated and encouraged.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wherever you saw the quote posted on Facebook it came from me. I posted it first. I&#39;d read it somewhere shortly after an online exchange of views in which I&#39;d explained why my son&#39;s removal from school was a parenting decision not an educational one and that his happiness was the primary objective. I thought Joyce&#39;s words summarised my thoughts about that very well, but of course that was in the context of my thoughts about that. Given that only I knew the details of that exchange of views elsewhere I can see Joyce&#39;s words were indeed out of context.<br/>
