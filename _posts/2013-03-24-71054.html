<div id="ygrps-yiv-122172101">Just wanted to share this here:<br/>
<br/>
Today my daughter mentioned to me in passing that she&#39;s thinking about trying some new foods.  I said &quot;Okay&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s our first non-emotionally charged conversation about food that I can remember.   It&#39;s certainly the first time that she&#39;s started a conversation about food.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been &quot;deschooling&quot; about food for approx 9 months now.   My daughter is 9, very nearly 10 years old.   She started on solids at around a year old.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often read that deschooling takes approx 1 month for each year of school â€¦ so that made me smile to myself.<br/>
