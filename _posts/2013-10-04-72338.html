------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I have a question I want to ask for a friend and although it&#39;s not exactly unschooling, I would like to ask on the Always Learning group because it is the best place I have ever gotten thoughtful input from. But I thought I&#39;d run it by you first. I just re-read the guidelines for posting over there (I haven&#39;t posted in a long time!) and I think it falls under helping people live more peacefully together.<br/>
<br/>
Background: my friend and her husband are divorced. It was/is ugly. I am close with her and I think I&#39;ve inspired her to try and live more peacefully with her kids. She asked me today how to handle situations where kids are pushing boundaries without punishing - especially when the two parents are handling things differently. (Her examples were her daughter wanting LOTS of chocolate and when they have to leave and daughter doesn&#39;t want to).<br/>
<br/>
They are not unschoolers. My question - how have families dealt with two very different parenting philosophies? It has to be difficult for the children. Would it be better if my friend would do time-outs for &quot;consistency&quot;? (of course my gut feeling is no, but she is getting flak that she let&#39;s them &quot;do whatever they want&quot;. Does anyone know of resources specifically for families with divorced parents?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209865789">For unschoolers who are not divorced, I want to say:  Find ways to strenghten and maintain your marriage.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who is divorced, unfortunately:  You will never have the luxury of simple agreement of two parents.  Trust is gone.  Antagonism is likely.<br/>
<br/>
It can be nearly cruel to encourage someone to lean toward unschooling or peaceful parenting if she/he doesn&#39;t have full custody, and can&#39;t really decide unilaterally how the children will be &quot;raised.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
To add more antagonism to an already strained system might be worse for the children than traditional punishments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453896264">Hi,  I have a few friends in similar situations.  Sometimes the court steps in and forces parents to agree on a method. <br/>
<br/>
  My advice would be for your friend to focus on her relationship with her daughter and not on how specifically to handle each situation.  The closer she feels to her daughter, the better things will go in general.  If their relationship is solid, she can explain how things are because of the divorce and they can come up with a solution together.  Even if the solution is that she can choose her foods with mom, but with dad it&#39;s better to just go with his preferences and not say &quot;but mom lets me&quot; because it could end up being decided by a mediator.  It&#39;s a sad situation.  And perhaps her daughter is too young to understand or too stressed to agree to disagree.  <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874700914">More kindness, even if it&#39;s only from one parent, is a good thing.  But in the chocolate example, the kinder thing may be to restrict the chocolate for now, if she considers that her daughter will have trouble making sense of abundant chocolate, in the context of the other parent&#39;s views and their family&#39;s history.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important that the mother focus on where her children are at and what is likely to help them at this point in time.  Taking care to make any changes slowly and mindfully.  The kids have probably had a lot of upheaval already.  They need their mother not to be hastily taking on new parenting ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
They need her to be as calm as she can in the face of the turmoil.  I would focus on thinking of what will help her children best in these circumstances, rather than thinking of changing parenting practices.<br/>

There&#39;s going to be anger, resentment, feelings of betrayal, distrust. That&#39;s going to be reflected in kids&#39; behavior. They&#39;re going to react more to the parent than the parenting. The reaction will be amplified by parenting choices that feel to them like, &quot;What I want for you is more important than what you want.&quot; It&#39;s just a big echoey reminder of what was done to them in the divorce.</div><div><br></div></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>

If your daughter is similar, don&#39;t plan to go someplace for a short amount of time - plan for her to have enough time to settle in and enjoy herself and not feel like the rug gets pulled out from under her feet just when she&#39;s having fun. If you plan ahead in that way, you&#39;re not stuck negotiating &quot;five more minutes...okay ten more minutes&quot; - there&#39;s no limit to push and she&#39;s not &quot;getting away with something&quot; - it&#39;s all part of the plan.&nbsp;<br><br><br></span></p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-668961211ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-668961211ygrps-yiv-1594579652">This is once removed, but I thought it was worth bringing here anyway.

I have a question I want to ask for a friend and although it&#39;s not exactly unschooling, I would like to ask on the Always Learning group because it is the best place I have ever gotten thoughtful input from. But I thought I&#39;d run it by you first. I just re-read the guidelines for posting over there (I haven&#39;t posted in a long time!) and I think it falls under helping people live more peacefully together.<br>
<br>
Background: my friend and her husband are divorced. It was/is ugly. I am close with her and I think I&#39;ve inspired her to try and live more peacefully with her kids. She asked me today how to handle situations where kids are pushing boundaries without punishing - especially when the two parents are handling things differently. (Her examples were her daughter wanting LOTS of chocolate and when they have to leave and daughter doesn&#39;t want to).<br>
<br>
They are not unschoolers. My question - how have families dealt with two very different parenting philosophies? It has to be difficult for the children. Would it be better if my friend would do time-outs for &quot;consistency&quot;? (of course my gut feeling is no, but she is getting flak that she let&#39;s them &quot;do whatever they want&quot;. Does anyone know of resources specifically for families with divorced parents?<br>
