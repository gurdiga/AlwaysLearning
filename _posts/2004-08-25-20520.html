London (or rather about a century and some before that), one thing that <br/>
improved the gene pool in London was that the worst were transported to Georgia, <br/>

embarrassments of Dickensian life to this day.  <br/>
<br/>
American-Studies embarrassment.  Why is the South so... so...   <br/>
feudal/slummy/prejudiced/ignorant?    It relates partly to where the people came from, and <br/>
why.  (And before anyone has a stroke, my own ancestors are heavily English, <br/>
NOT high class, and primarily southern.)<br/>

Having stirred an ant bed, this is my last prep day before leaving for a <br/>

My Dad&#39;s family are from the South, of mostly English stock.  Tho the majority of his generation and mine are college-educated, there&#39;s still a very high hick-factor, socially anyway.  Even with a college degree, you can still tell they come from dust-bowl Oklahoma roots. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve always attributed it to the fact that they&#39;re Baptists, the standard God-fearing, in the box, ignorant-of-other-kinds-of-people thing. Also, they really don&#39;t get much exposure to the world outside their own bubble of college, white-collar work, and Christian tradition. I know they just don&#39;t get me at all, but I only flit thru occasionally, so they don&#39;t have any real reason to get to know me. <br/>

<br/>
The Sep/Oct HEM has a letter to the editor in response to Ann Larson Fisher&#39;s column about &quot;The Rod&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The letter writer suggested that the HEM issue contradicted itself by publishing Fisher&#39;s article along with the Kaseman&#39;s article against regulation of families.<br/>
<br/>
I think he may have meant &quot;magazine&quot; rather than &quot;article&quot;.  From the letter, &quot;But I&#39;m concerned that your article is starting to take a leftward drift.  There are many liberals out there who would like to have a law passed against spanking kids.  This is being done in England right now.  Why they can&#39;t see that as schools eliminated corporal punishment, the incidents of violence and bulling went up, is beyond me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He (the letter is signed Steve Charles, New River, AZ) does not cite his source for the connection between eliminating corporal punishment and increasing &quot;bulling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The letter is followed by a reply from Fisher.<br/>
