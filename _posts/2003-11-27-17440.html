<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758684756">I just started to unschool my daughter.  Although she was doing very <br/>
well academically, she hated the structure of school.  I want her to <br/>
have a love for learning so I decided to change the way we do things. <br/>
What I am wondering is what do you tell the school board you are <br/>
doing.  I am from New Brunswick, Canada and we have a form to fill <br/>
out every year in which we have to state what subjects are going to <br/>
be covered, and a list of everything being taught in each subject, as <br/>
well as how long do we plan to spend on each subject everyday.  How <br/>
can you put unschooling into words that the school board will accept?<br/>
Anyone have any answers for me????<br/>

You can do the same thing that many teachers do: fill out your daily <br/>
lesson plans way in advance, then do whatever you want.  Life is a <br/>
series of adaptations, and adapting your activities to the day is <br/>
your right, your prerogative.  A good source of what kind of info <br/>
they are looking for can be found in the World Book at this site:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.worldbook.com/students/course_study_index.asp">http://www2.worldbook.com/students/course_study_index.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
Select the information that is appropriate for your family, with your <br/>
own additions, and give them a copy of that.  What you have to do <br/>
depends on your laws and regulations.  Be sure to read them <br/>
carefully.  Sometimes they really require very little, though myths <br/>
may build up about these requirements.  And sometimes, even when they <br/>
appear to require a lot, there are no teeth behind the regs, no way <br/>
to make you stick to whatever you give them.  In other words, you are <br/>
just giving them an outline, a guideline, and you are then free to do <br/>
whatever you want.  In most cases no one can hold your feet to the <br/>
fire to ascertain whether or not you followed that guideline.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as how much time we spend goes, I have no problem giving them <br/>
the max required, since we have learned that almost every living <br/>
moment of every day is a learning moment, a learning experience, so <br/>
we are quite comfortable with the amount of time we spend on learning.<br/>
<br/>
You will have to comb your regs thoroughly and read them like a <br/>
debate team member would.  Then you can argue for your interpretation <br/>
of the regs, since all law is subject to interpretation anyway.  <br/>
Consider reading and evaluating your regs as your primary learning <br/>
experience!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are there any support groups near you? You can get info from <br/>
www.flora.org/homeschool-ca. Click on New Brunswick. I know there are a <br/>
couple of New Brunswick residents on hs-ca. If you don&#39;t get the info you <br/>
want from the Flora site, you might want to join hs-ca and ask there. What <br/>
you usually need is the exact law, which should be on the Flora site, and <br/>
advice from people who are actually living with that law. To join hs-ca, <br/>
send a message to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hs-ca-subscribe@...">hs-ca-subscribe@...</a><br/>
