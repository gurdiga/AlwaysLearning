<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715972845">I could have put this under the question about whether to buy a Leap Pad or a tablet, or under single-parent unschooling, but it&#39;s applicable to anyone thinking about unschooling, or who is in the process of  making a decision involving money.<br/>

Unschooling is priceless. It cannot be bought. And &quot;cost&quot; is a difficult concept, so if you have an easy answer floating to mind, try to scatter it and look from many different angles.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is in a private school, unschooling won&#39;t &quot;cost that much,&quot; meaning no one will send you a tuition bill and a steady stream of fundraising requests and tell you what clothes and shoes you have to buy.<br/>
<br/>
If both parents are working and decide one should quit work and stay at home with the children, will it &quot;cost&quot; a full-time income? In one way of looking at it, perhaps. But counting potential is a trap.<br/>
<br/>
If a family values love and relationships, unschooling can pay off in a jackpot of closeness and joy that could hardly be possible with school in the equation, and could never be bought back with a thousand hours of expensive therapy down the road. (Maybe factor in the time savings of not spending a thousand hours sitting and talking about what you could&#39;ve done differently, in addition to the cost of it.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t need to be expensive, but anyone choosing unschooling simply to save money is making a mistake. If parents don&#39;t want to spend any money on games, toys, museums, out-of-town trips, books, or whatever it is the kids might be interested in, then unschooling will not work at their house.<br/>
<br/>
One doesn&#39;t need to be rich to unschool, but it takes dedication and focus, creativity and resourcefulness.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307328509">And just the other day we took our kids kart racing and I thought I was spending too much money. I felt bad for a few minutes for this money because we are so short on it right now.<br/>
<br/>
Then I thought about it as an educational expense and my uneasiness was gone.<br/>
<br/>
And learning was not the only result. The biggest result of going kart racing as a family was happiness, closeness and joy together. Our son, especially, was happy !<br/>
<br/>
Well worth the $50 dollars we spent!<br/>
<br/>
Being happy together and the smiles are priceless!<br/>
