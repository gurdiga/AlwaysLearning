<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329168939">I&#39;m leaving town soon to go to Tempe, Arizona for the HENA conference.<br/>
If you post something and it doesn&#39;t go through, wait.  Don&#39;t post it  <br/>
again.  It might take a day or two or three.  I don&#39;t know if the  <br/>
other moderators might also be really busy this weekend.  Joyce only  <br/>
checks in the early morning some days.<br/>
<br/>
Please be patient, don&#39;t get grumpy, I&#39;ll be back late Sunday night.<br/>
<br/>
New members are on moderation, and some of the members who&#39;ve never  <br/>
or very rarely posted are too.<br/>
