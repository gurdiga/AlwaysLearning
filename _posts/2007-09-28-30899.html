<div id="ygrps-yiv-947936157">Totally offtopic (other than that Rowan and I got to talk to both an almond<br/>
grower and a chemist in our quest for answers!), but the almond thing is<br/>
pretty complex; if anyone is interested, feel free to mail me offlist. I did<br/>
a bunch of research into this, and into both the steam and chemical<br/>
pasteurization process, and would be happy to share what I have.<br/>

&gt; So far, by the way, it is still possible to buy unpasteurized raw<br/>
&gt; almonds, they will be less and less available as the new mandate<br/>
&gt; started just this month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There isn&#39;t good evidence that pasteurization eliminates nutritional<br/>
&gt; value, much less absolutely all nutrition. If nothing else it leaves<br/>
&gt; dietary fiber, which, itself, is something valuable.<br/>
