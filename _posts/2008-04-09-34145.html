<div id="ygrps-yiv-608346729">One of the best examples I have from my parents is that they trusted<br/>
us to make good decisions.  We were always told that if we were honest<br/>
when we screwed up, they could help us &quot;fix it&quot; rather than have to<br/>
lie or hide the problem to make it worse.  I made pretty good<br/>
decisions (in my opinion &lt;BWG&gt;) as a teen.  Some bad fashion choices<br/>
were made and multiple ear piercings - but since none of it really got<br/>
a reaction from my parents, I felt no need to push any limits.  We had<br/>
no curfews because my parents knew our friends - our friends had<br/>
curfews and we would be home at a reasonable hour as a result.  <br/>
<br/>
My parents have seen the tremendous grief we went through with the<br/>
public schools and the difficulties of parenting a child with Tourette<br/>
Syndrome and OCD.  They have seen the &quot;miracles&quot; wrought by a<br/>
transition to homeschooling and then unschooling.  They have learned<br/>
to accept their grandchildren exactly as they are and trusted us to<br/>
parent them well.  I have learned to accept my parents for how they<br/>
*do* love us rather than how I *expect* them to.  My father spent<br/>
hours helping my husband rewire our barn and run an outlet to our<br/>
pool.  He comes to the rescue when our van breaks down or our pool<br/>
filter stops.  He may never sit and read a story to my kids or wrestle<br/>
with them on the floor.  But he did help my British husband (never<br/>
played baseball in his life) coach little league baseball with his (my<br/>
dad&#39;s) arm in a sling from shoulder surgery. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I could go on - life was not always perfect growing up.  My<br/>
mom and I have not always been the best of friends - far from it at<br/>
times.  BUT I do have some good examples to bring forward into<br/>
parenting....<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share,<br/>
