Purdue Researchers Determine Age Of Fossilized Human Ancestor<br/>
<br/>
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - In a finding that could shed light on the <br/>
earliest origins of mankind, fossil remains found in South Africa of an <br/>
ancestral human species have proven far older than expected when <br/>
evaluated by a Purdue University research team.<br/>
<br/>
Purdue&#39;s Darryl Granger and Marc Caffee have determined the age of a <br/>
fossilized skeleton thought to be an Australopithecus - a genus of <br/>
African hominids from which humanity is thought to have developed - by <br/>
measuring the radioactivity of the cave sediments in which the skeleton <br/>
was buried millions of years ago. Their measurement technique, generally <br/>
used to estimate the age of geological formations such as glaciated <br/>
valleys and river terraces, has never before been used to date <br/>
biological fossils.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;By dating the sediments surrounding the fossil skeleton, we have <br/>
determined that this species reached southern Africa approximately 4 <br/>
million years ago,&quot; said Granger, associate professor of earth and <br/>
atmospheric sciences in Purdue&#39;s School of Science. &quot;If the skeleton is <br/>
indeed an Australopithecus, as we believe, the findings could mean that <br/>
these hominids were present in the area far earlier than is generally <br/>
accepted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The research appears in Friday&#39;s (4/25) issue of Science.<br/>
<br/>
Tracing the development and spread of the hominid species that may have <br/>
been mankind&#39;s ancestor is an arduous process, and it is difficult to <br/>
determine what happened because precisely dated fossil records are hard <br/>
to come by. Many such fossils have been found in eastern Africa&#39;s Rift <br/>
Valley, a region that was geologically active when Australopithecus <br/>
walked the Earth. The abundance of lake sediments and volcanic ash that <br/>
often surrounds Rift Valley hominid fossils provide good clues as to <br/>
their age. But there is no such luck with similar fossils from South <br/>
Africa, a region that also is rich in hominid remains but lacks the <br/>
definitive geological clues that are present in the Rift Valley.<br/>
<br/>
T.C. Partridge and R.J. Clarke, researchers from the University of the <br/>
Witwatersrand in South Africa, were thus confronted with a mixed <br/>
blessing when, in 1997, they discovered a nearly complete skeleton of <br/>
what appeared to be an Australopithecus buried in the sediments on the <br/>
floor of the Sterkfontein cave in central South Africa. The fossil was <br/>
well preserved, but its age was uncertain. It was more than 2 million <br/>
years old, but how much more? The answer to that question would affect <br/>
theories of how and when Australopithecus spread through Africa.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Their initial estimate of 3.3 million years provoked a lot of <br/>
controversy,&quot; Granger said. &quot;Few thought that Australopithecus had <br/>
traveled so far so long ago, and scientists wanted more proof. If the <br/>
estimate was accurate, it might require a rethinking of human prehistory.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A firmer answer would require the innovative use of a particle <br/>
accelerator half a world away at Purdue in Indiana, where Granger was <br/>
using radioactive isotopes in sediment to determine the age of rivers <br/>
and caves.<br/>
<br/>
Dating fossils by examining the minute quantities of radioactive <br/>
elements they contain is not a new technique in archaeology. Carbon-14, <br/>
a radioactive isotope that slowly decays as centuries pass, has been a <br/>
common benchmark for dating many human fossils; the more carbon-14 has <br/>
decayed in a sample, the older it must be. The speed at which carbon-14 <br/>
decays, called its half-life, is only 5,730 years. This means that after <br/>
a few millennia, the isotope is no longer useful to mark a fossil&#39;s age.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Once your fossil is older than 50,000 years, its carbon-14 is nearly <br/>
gone,&quot; Granger said. &quot;We knew the South African fossils were at least 2 <br/>
million years old, so it was clear we needed another way to establish <br/>
their age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Granger, a physics major as an undergraduate, eventually became an earth <br/>
scientist when he developed an interest in studying the age and changes <br/>
in mountains and river beds, geological formations that are often many <br/>
millions of years old. Rather than use carbon-14 to date his landscapes, <br/>
he looked for isotopes with far longer half-lives - and found them in <br/>
aluminum-26 and beryllium-10. These elements often form in common quartz <br/>
when it is on the Earth&#39;s surface and exposed to cosmic rays.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When radiation from outer space strikes silicon and oxygen atoms in a <br/>
quartz crystal, they split into aluminum-26 and beryllium-10, both of <br/>
which have half-lives of around a million years,&quot; Granger said. &quot;Because <br/>
they decay so slowly, they allow you to reach back much further in <br/>
history than you can using carbon-14.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The use of aluminum and beryllium for radiometric dating had only been <br/>
around for a few years when Granger began to use it on cave sediments. <br/>
The technique was not widely known outside geological circles, so when <br/>
he heard about the Australopithecus discovery, he contacted the South <br/>
African scientists who found the skeleton and asked if he could be of <br/>
assistance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was the first time this method had been used to determine the age of <br/>
something that had been alive,&quot; Granger said. &quot;But based on the <br/>
evidence, we found that the fossil was even older than the initial <br/>
estimate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Granger and Caffee, of Purdue&#39;s physics department, analyzed samples of <br/>
the skeleton in Purdue&#39;s accelerator mass spectrometer, a device capable <br/>
of detecting the infinitesimal quantities of radioactive aluminum and <br/>
beryllium in the samples.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We found that the skeleton was between 3.5 and 4.5 million years old,&quot; <br/>
Granger said. &quot;That&#39;s admittedly quite a large window of possibility, <br/>
but even if it&#39;s on the young side, it still puts Australopithecus in <br/>
southern Africa far earlier than expected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The significance for anthropologists would be the possibility that <br/>
mankind&#39;s earliest ancestors were a different species than scientists <br/>
generally believe.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Early hominid finds in eastern Africa have traditionally been regarded <br/>
as the base populations from which all later hominids sprung,&quot; said <br/>
Melissa Remis, associate professor of anthropology in Purdue&#39;s School of <br/>
Liberal Arts. &quot;An earlier hominid find in southern Africa, whatever the <br/>
species might be, could force a rethinking of what that base population <br/>
might have been.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Granger said he hesitated to speculate on the broader significance of <br/>
the findings, but he hopes the technique will prove useful in other <br/>
investigations into prehuman history.<br/>
