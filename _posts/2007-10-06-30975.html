<div id="ygrps-yiv-509543193">&quot;It takes years of schooling to<br/>
knock the intelligence out of a child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was someone&#39;s sigline in a wholly unrelated forum.  I was thinking when I saw it that it didn&#39;t take all that many years.  But then I thought it&#39;s not &quot;intelligence&quot; that children lose, it&#39;s curiosity and joy and hope and willingness.   And in there, the relationship with the parents goes quickly, because in most cases the parents told the kids that school would be fun, and they would learn a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The parents didn&#39;t mean to lie (usually, I&#39;m sure).  They too were hopeful and willing.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it takes many years.<br/>
And I think parents can do the same damage to &quot;intelligence&quot; (whatever different components that might have) at home, if they &quot;do school&quot; or parent in ways that create and ever deepen a chasm between them and their children.<br/>
