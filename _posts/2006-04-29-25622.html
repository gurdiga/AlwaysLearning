<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627088641">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if you could offer any thoughts/ideas/experiences about a situation we have in our homeschooling (hate that term!) group. <br/>
<br/>
We have a natural learning based type discussion group that meets once per month to discuss things about natural learning/unschooling etc. Not everyone is at the same level with it but we do have some good discussions most times. The problem I have (and a couple of others in the group have) with the set up of the group, is that we (the adults) sit in the lounge room and discuss stuff while the kids go off and play. The kids may be inside, they may be out. Mostly we can&#39;t see them (unless they are directly out the front window). I have issues with this as, although, it mostly &#39;appears&#39; to be working well, there have been (obviously) little incidences arise where the children need help in coping etc. I&#39;ve always been such a hands on parent and have found myself just going along with the group set up as is for the sake of the others in the group. We have now raised the issue and others in the group don&#39;t see it as a problem and believe that the kids will come in and tell their parents if there&#39;s a problem. This simply isn&#39;t the case though (the parents are just not aware of it). The children involved are usually: a 6 yr old boy, 7 yr old girl, 2, 4 yr old girls and a 12 yr old girl. Sometimes more than this comes and the dynamics are usually more heightened, naturally.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I would love you guys to help me with is - 1) am I being over the top with my protectiveness etc (my heart says no I&#39;m not) and 2) we are thinking of starting up another similar group for people who can&#39;t travel the distance to the present group, so I&#39;d really love some ideas as to how we could still have abit of a discussion group while the chilren are being better helped/supervised. Normally, discussion type groups I go to are at night when my husband is home with Lewi, but there&#39;s no option for this at the moment due to distances at night that would have to be travelled by many members of the group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>
Kim<br/>

not just have a playtime at a park and stand or sit, together, on or  <br/>

possible, because of weather, we&#39;ve done well with fast food play  <br/>
places as an alternative. Sometimes malls have little kid play areas  <br/>
and parents can sit or stand nearby.<br/>

<br/>
my experience with this is that trying to meet both<br/>
these needs at one meeting doesn&#39;t work. if it&#39;s a<br/>
playdate, it&#39;s a playdate. if it&#39;s a discussion group,<br/>
the kids can&#39;t be there or have to be attended by moms<br/>
not participating in the discussion. other moms might<br/>
not mind letting the kids fend for themselves, or<br/>
their kids might have the personalities that work well<br/>
that way, but in my specific situation, ds has not yet<br/>
wanted to go off without me for more than a few<br/>
minutes, and still wants my help in negotiating most<br/>
things, so I would always be left out of all the<br/>
discussing! it took me a while (and some panic<br/>
attacks) to acknowledge that I needed some adult<br/>
socialization where I could participate in discussions<br/>
and to figure out ideas for meeting that need. I still<br/>
haven&#39;t gotten to any but now I know that I need to go<br/>
without ds at least once in a while so that I can talk<br/>
too!<br/>

At one of our homeschool groups in the past, this was the situation, where  <br/>
we were in a building at the park, with just a door open, and we couldn&#39;t <br/>
really  see all that was going on with the kids.  What ended up happening which was <br/>
 really unfair to the older kids, is the supervision of their younger <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548395576">Our homeschool group meets in a library basement during the colder <br/>
months. The room is small enough that the moms can sit at a table <br/>
talking but still hear and see the kids play. Of course, being inside <br/>
and in a library, there  were some restrictions as to what the kids <br/>
could play (therefore if there were more than about six kids there it <br/>
got stressful, because the noise level really increased)...mostly we <br/>
encouraged card playing (like pokemon), board games, <br/>
blocks/lego/lincoln logs etc....I havent found it difficult <br/>
to &quot;discuss&quot; with the other moms in this atmosphere. I think the key <br/>
is that the room is small enough that you don&#39;t have to keep getting <br/>
up and following your child around (like in a park)...is there any <br/>
kind of community center or library around that might lend you a room <br/>
for a couple of hours a week? <br/>

<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s what&#39;s been happening a little bit, I think, for the 12 yr old girl- perhaps being unconsciously used as a supervisor. In my opinion, that&#39;s not on and has been an issue. Unless, like Sandra suggested, it was an arranged thing - that would be great.<br/>

Yes, we&#39;ve been thinking of that as the get together times we have (outside the discussion group) work well. Over here the winter&#39;s pretty lovely during the day time so mostly outdoors could still be a possibility.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, thanks Pam. We do get together at the park, beach etc and it works so well. Not as big on the discussion but the kids much more focussed on (which is what it is all about!). I totally agree too that it&#39;s much more &#39;natural&#39; to be looking out for the kids attentively.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been so great airing this stuff here as I knew in my heart (as did another member of the group) that the group situation wasn&#39;t right but I get confused etc when others disagree - I often think something must be wrong with me when parents think so differently. Am getting much stronger though. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much to you all I so appreciate your voices.<br/>

  Our homeschool group meets in a library basement during the colder <br/>
  months. The room is small enough that the moms can sit at a table <br/>
  talking but still hear and see the kids play. Of course, being inside <br/>
  and in a library, there  were some restrictions as to what the kids <br/>
  could play (therefore if there were more than about six kids there it <br/>
  got stressful, because the noise level really increased)...mostly we <br/>
  encouraged card playing (like pokemon), board games, <br/>
  blocks/lego/lincoln logs etc....I havent found it difficult <br/>
  to &quot;discuss&quot; with the other moms in this atmosphere. I think the key <br/>
  is that the room is small enough that you don&#39;t have to keep getting <br/>
  up and following your child around (like in a park)...is there any <br/>
  kind of community center or library around that might lend you a room <br/>
  for a couple of hours a week? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855240545">Kim, the solution that worked for me was a good set of walkie-talkies. My dd <br/>
was velcro-girl til about 4ish and still has those tendencies AND I am <br/>
labeled as an &#39;over-protective&#39; mother. We rarely use the walkie-talkies <br/>
thse days, but we used them heavily for a while and I try to have them <br/>
charged and available always.<br/>
<br/>
In once situation, where the kids were on the property we weekly gathered <br/>
at, &#39;they&#39; were too close to the road, playing with the dog and I used the <br/>
walkie-talkie to speak to Emma and another parent used it to speak to his <br/>
child that we could see was close enough to mine to hear (we had a visual on <br/>
the kids, but the property is 5 acres).<br/>
<br/>
Using the walkie-talkie was the condition for being with the others - <br/>
otherwise I always have something for dd to focus on while being with me <br/>
while I&#39;m in a meeting.<br/>

Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering if you could offer any thoughts/ideas/experiences about a <br/>
situation we have in our homeschooling (hate that term!) group.<br/>
<br/>
We have a natural learning based type discussion group that meets once per <br/>
month to discuss things about natural learning/unschooling etc. Not everyone <br/>
is at the same level with it but we do have some good discussions most <br/>
times. The problem I have (and a couple of others in the group have) with <br/>
the set up of the group, is that we (the adults) sit in the lounge room and <br/>
discuss stuff while the kids go off and play. The kids may be inside, they <br/>
may be out. Mostly we can&#39;t see them (unless they are directly out the front <br/>
window). I have issues with this as, although, it mostly &#39;appears&#39; to be <br/>
working well, there have been (obviously) little incidences arise where the <br/>
children need help in coping etc. I&#39;ve always been such a hands on parent <br/>
and have found myself just going along with the group set up as is for the <br/>
sake of the others in the group. We have now raised the issue and others in <br/>
the group don&#39;t see it as a problem and believe that the kids will come in <br/>
and tell their parents if there&#39;s a problem. This simply isn&#39;t the case <br/>
though (the parents are just not aware of it). The children involved are <br/>
usually: a 6 yr old boy, 7 yr old girl, 2, 4 yr old girls and a 12 yr old <br/>
girl. Sometimes more than this comes and the dynamics are usually more <br/>
heightened, naturally.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I would love you guys to help me with is - 1) am I being over <br/>
the top with my protectiveness etc (my heart says no I&#39;m not) and 2) we are <br/>
thinking of starting up another similar group for people who can&#39;t travel <br/>
the distance to the present group, so I&#39;d really love some ideas as to how <br/>
we could still have abit of a discussion group while the chilren are being <br/>
better helped/supervised. Normally, discussion type groups I go to are at <br/>
night when my husband is home with Lewi, but there&#39;s no option for this at <br/>
the moment due to distances at night that would have to be travelled by many <br/>
members of the group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>
Kim<br/>
