<div id="ygrps-yiv-411056200">Well, it&#39;s not TOO spooky, but I was revising my lists-links page,  <br/>
and while checking links it seems that both of the Christian  <br/>
discussions listed have 233 members today.  Can that BE?  I thought I  <br/>
was opening the same page over and over.<br/>
<br/>
Well numbers scare me anyway.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a few moments today and wants to help me out some,  <br/>
please check a few links (randomly is fine) and let me know if you  <br/>
find bad ones or can think of better or additional ones.<br/>

Sandra - I feel the same way about numbers, they spook me, but for another  <br/>
reason. <br/>
 <br/>
When I worked at the Police department, each crime had a different  number.  <br/>
484 is a petty theft, 261 is a rape, 187 is a murder, 5150 is an  unstable <br/>
psychopath (which is funny, because that&#39;s part of our bank&#39;s routing  number...) <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just because I NOTICE certain numbers, or that it&#39;s  <br/>
just a coincidence, but the number 187 is always popping up.  It&#39;s just a  <br/>
number!  But because of working years where a number coincided with an  incident or <br/>
crime, I have a bad habit of putting them together.  I wish I  could forget <br/>
them!  <br/>

every number from 1 to 9999.  And there are links to what the heck  <br/>
he&#39;s talking about within the list too.  And it&#39;s colorful. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
