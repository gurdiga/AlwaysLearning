<div id="ygrps-yiv-861805866">Live Free Learn Free is seeking submissions from unschoolers!  Who<br/>
are we?<br/>
 <br/>
Live Free Learn Free is a magazine for unschoolers and relaxed<br/>
homeschoolers in which to share ideas, stories, and experiences. All<br/>
material is written by those who home educate Â– both parents and<br/>
children. It is an inclusive magazine, not only for and by experienced<br/>
unschoolers, but also for and by those just starting down the path. It<br/>
embraces those who are radical in their unschooling methods and those<br/>
who are less so.<br/>
 <br/>
But mostly, it&#39;s a magazine about children living life - really living<br/>
life - unhindered by curriculums, by lunch bells and standardized<br/>
tests, by schoolyard bullies and tedious homework.  It&#39;s about<br/>
freedom.  It&#39;s about families growing closer than they ever dreamed<br/>
possible.  <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re looking for contributions on later readers, real work for kids,<br/>
and camp experiences, as well as various other unschooling subjects. <br/>
You can view our submissions page for details of the themes and<br/>
submission guidelines (several guidelines have been changed recently):<br/>
