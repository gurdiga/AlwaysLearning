<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731665071">Well, the helicopters are buzzing overhead, Olympic athletes are jogging <br/>
down my block, Greenpeace has a huge hot-air balloon floating in the field <br/>
behind my house, crowds have swarmed in today to witness the torch on its&#39; <br/>
way down to Salt Lake, the shuttle busses are up and running in all their <br/>
toxic-fumed glory and the FBI has taken over my library for the rest of the <br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
As fun as it all sounds, we figure it&#39;ll be easier to just watch it all on <br/>
TV like the rest of you, so we&#39;re escaping to Florida for the next two <br/>
weeks. ;-) I even get to meet up with some of the Florida unschoolers while <br/>
I&#39;m there. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be setting my list preferences to &quot;no mail&quot; while I&#39;m away, so don&#39;t <br/>
talk about anything too cool till I get back. K? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Back in two weeks.<br/>
