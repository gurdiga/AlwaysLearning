<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956431446">I posted this at unschoolingdiscussion in an attempt to respond to Sandra&#39;s<br/>
post and see if other members were out there waiting for someone to start a<br/>
topic.  It seems the conversation over there is currently about list<br/>
location and logistics.  In any case, I thought some here might enjoy this;<br/>
sorry for the crosspost.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some more pictures of bridges:<br/>

Recently, I found an article in a copy of the periodical, Readers Digest<br/>
(August 2008) for those who are curious.  It was titled &quot;4 Ways of Looking<br/>
at a Bridge.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/4-ways-of-looking-at-a-bridge/article82093.html">http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/4-ways-of-looking-at-a-bridge/article82093.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I though it was a good visual representation or snapshot of how everything<br/>
can lead to anything and nothing can really be divided into distinct<br/>
subjects.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of bridges I have seen pictures of or been on, uses of bridges,<br/>
materials for making bridges, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There were also slideshows on bicycles and gardens:<br/>

&gt; Two weeks, no posts.  This list is very quiet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m one of the listowners, and  know where the other regular posters<br/>
&gt; are (or some of them).<br/>
&gt; For those new members who have lately joined, I&#39;m sorry for the<br/>
&gt; mysterious quiet here, but if you want unschooling discussion and<br/>
&gt; community, here are some recently-busy places:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Radical Unschoolers Network<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/">http://familyrun.ning.com/</a><br/>

&gt; Always Learning<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there is a little less, but still good activity here:<br/>
