<div id="ygrps-yiv-826526336">***I&#39;m going to play a little fun trivia game with my college students - <br/>
<br/>
find out what they know about Harriet Tubman and Amelia Earhart. And  <br/>
Mohammad Ali, too.***<br/>
<br/>
Dylan knows about Amelia Earhart, not because she was &quot;studied<br/>
thoroughly&quot; but because of the sick and twisted humor of his family. <br/>
We watched a documentary a few years ago about Coconut crabs.  They&#39;re<br/>
fascinating, big crabs with claws so strong they can crack coconuts.  <br/>
Two of the coconut crab habitats mentioned were Gardner Island and <br/>
Howland Island.   The area of Gardner and Howland Islands was speculated<br/>
to be where Earhart and Noonan crashed.   (You can see where this is<br/>
going, right?)   Some hopeful Amelia Earhart fans have suggested she<br/>
somehow made it to one of the islands and survived for some time,<br/>
somehow.  We speculated that if she&#39;d had reached the sandy shores of the<br/>
island, exhausted, and had fallen into a coma like state... (remember,<br/>
she&#39;d been ill in the days leading up to her disappearance and probably<br/>
injured when the Electra crashed) Coconut crabs, mistaking her head for<br/>
(what else?) a coconut may have snipped her open. (CRUNCH)  Then, upon<br/>
discovering yucky brains inside instead of lovely coconut milk, realized<br/>
their mistake and buried her on the beach.   This would explain why her<br/>
body was never found.   <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how Dylan knows about Amelia Earhart. And the Electra.  And<br/>
Coconut crabs.  And Fred Noonan.  And Howland and Gardner Islands. And<br/>
the Phoenix group of Islands.  And the coast guard cutter &quot;Itasca.&quot;  And<br/>
the mild and (we still insist) harmless form of insanity that runs in his<br/>
family. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And here, bizarre as it may be, is a web site about female human remains<br/>
found on Gardner Island:<br/>

<br/>
If you Google &quot;Phoenix Scheme&quot; or maybe &quot;Phoenix Theories&quot; you will find<br/>
more stuff you&#39;ll wish you hadn&#39;t. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

about the Donner Party.)<br/>
<br/>
What I remember about Amelia Earhart, at least from childhood (not <br/>
school), is a book I had about her, particularly an incident in her own <br/>
childhood in which she tried to recreate the recipe for manna from the <br/>
Bible.  Being from a non-biblish church, that may have been where I <br/>
first learned about manna from heaven.<br/>
<br/>
I think my public school education may have preceded studying women in <br/>
history, other than First Ladies and Betsy Ross, since Women&#39;s Lib was <br/>
just taking hold of the country and hadn&#39;t made an impact on the <br/>
curriculum.  African Americans were Frederick Douglass.  I read a book <br/>
about George Washington Carver on my own, though.  Think how abysmally <br/>
ignorant I&#39;d be if it hadn&#39;t been for those Scholastic Book Sales they <br/>
held each year. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

would be hard to FIX such a traditional slippage,) but we have that  <br/>
it was &quot;the second of July.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;With her partner captain newman<br/>
on the 2nd of July<br/>
her plane fell in the ocean far away&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The song was most likely composed by someone in the 1950&#39;s or 60&#39;s or  <br/>
something and I could look it up, but I learned it from frequent  <br/>
repetition at regular folksinging get-togethers, and it still comes  <br/>
around once in a while, but my favorite singing partner is old now,  <br/>
and has cancer, and I might not sing it many more times with someone  <br/>
who knows it so well.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it wasn&#39;t even the 2nd of July, but what they say (&quot;they&quot; being  <br/>
folklorists) is that what survives in verse can last a long time.<br/>
<br/>
The Greenland Whale Fisheries survives because it has a really great  <br/>
tune, but it preserves a date very badly. &lt;g&gt;  &quot;It was in eighteen  <br/>
hundred and fifty five (or three or something) and on June the  <br/>
fourteenth day (or someteenth day)...&quot;   All that needs to rhyme is  <br/>
&quot;day&quot; with &quot;sailed away.&quot;<br/>

Hey, I think this is the way my son would learn best on this topic!<br/>
<br/>
So, here I am this afternoon, reading this thread, and trying to rack <br/>
my brains for an inkling of memory of what history I *did* learn in <br/>
gradeschool.  I&#39;m drawing a big fat blank.  Being almost 46, I wonder <br/>
what the curriculum really consisted of back then (dark ages to me).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, somewhere along the line I did even learn about these two <br/>
women.  Not the Titanic ballad, though.  But living up here along the <br/>
shores of Lake Superior, I know the Edmund Fitzgerald ballad probably <br/>
by heart, as Gordon Lightfoot can be heard every November on just about <br/>
every radio station in town.....<br/>

students -  find out what they know about Harriet Tubman and Amelia <br/>
Earhart. And  <br/>

<br/>
When I search my brain about all 3 of them, it&#39;s surprising how <br/>
little I know.  I remember &quot;float like a butterfly, and sting like a <br/>
bee&quot; and &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Thriller in Manilla&quot; about <br/>
Ali.  That tells me that repetition and rhyme encourage learning.<br/>
<br/>
Songs stay in my brain when everything else has leached away.<br/>
<br/>
I want to seize this opportunity and drop in some song lyrics by Al <br/>
Stewart referring to Amy Johnson, who was the British Amelia <br/>
Earhart  (or Amelia was the American Amy Johnson, depends on your <br/>
POV).<br/>
<br/>
From the song Flying Sorcery, which has a whisper of an unschooling <br/>
flavor.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;With your photographs of Kitty Hawk<br/>
And the biplanes on your wall<br/>
You were always Amy Johnson<br/>
From the time that you were small.<br/>
No schoolroom kept you grounded<br/>
While your thoughts could get away<br/>
You were taking off in Tiger Moths<br/>
Your wings against the brush-strokes of the day&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I like the imagery of the mind flying free of school.)  The song is <br/>
hauntingly beautiful, but sad.<br/>
