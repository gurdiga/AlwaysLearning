<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077610105">I&#39;m looking for other people&#39;s thoughts on this issue.  I&#39;ve got a lad with <br/>
raging hormones, and he&#39;s been frequenting porn sites on the internet.  I&#39;m <br/>
not sure how to deal with it.  His older brother didn&#39;t have the internet <br/>
and contented himself with pictures of women in underwear in advertising <br/>
flyers.  (At least that&#39;s what his girlfriend at one time was upset about.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem with him getting his jollies from looking at <br/>
pictures.  At least I don&#39;t think so.  But I have to admit that some of <br/>
what he&#39;s been looking at really grosses me out.  (He doesn&#39;t realize that <br/>
the pictures he&#39;s been looking at go into a temp file.)  The knowledge that <br/>
the women in those pictures likely weren&#39;t entirely willing participants <br/>
bothers me as well.  Sometimes I feel like asking him what it would take to <br/>
bare his privates on the internet for everyone who wants to to look at.  I <br/>
may well do that.  He&#39;s very modest.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t know that I&#39;m aware of his recent excursions.  We talked about <br/>
it when I discovered it a few months ago.  At the time, he was using the <br/>
computer that&#39;s provided by the school program we use, and they&#39;re supposed <br/>
to be quite strict about no porn or hate sites.  (They say they can find <br/>
out, but I didn&#39;t really believe it before, and they haven&#39;t said anything <br/>
yet.)  Now he&#39;s using our own computer, so I don&#39;t have that reason to say <br/>
he isn&#39;t allowed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sort of inclined to offer him some kind of erotic materials, but I <br/>
don&#39;t really know what.  The only books that come to mind are The Joy of <br/>
Sex and The Kama Sutra, but I don&#39;t know how interesting or appropriate <br/>
they&#39;d be.  It&#39;s been a long time since I looked at either one.  There&#39;s <br/>
Playboy, which I&#39;m not crazy about, but it&#39;s a lot better than the porn <br/>
sites.  And they really do have some good articles.   At least they did 30 <br/>
years ago. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are certainly good novels that have some good sex scenes in them, <br/>
that might satisfy some curiosity and hormonal urges.  I can remember <br/>
marking certain pages in novels I read as a teen.  The problem is, he can&#39;t <br/>
read well enough, and I&#39;m not comfortable reading sex scenes aloud to my <br/>
teenaged son.<br/>
<br/>
How have some of you with older kids handled this?<br/>

It worked with my son -- I told him he could get the book, but I wasn&#39;t<br/>
interested in it and would not read it aloud.  Of course, my son was six,<br/>
and the book was a &quot;Goosebumps.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your son is under 18, isn&#39;t porn illegal?  You might want to find out<br/>
what the penalties are for providing it to him.  Then again, having your<br/>
*mom* sit and look at porn with you would probably put any kid off it<br/>
forever.  Make it part of the curriculum, test him on it, have him give an<br/>
oral report...  Give him stickers if he does well!  That would cure him.<br/>

<br/>
Women do words, guys do pictures (generally speaking).  There are exceptions. <br/>
 I doubt novels would do it for him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How have some of you with older kids handled this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My boys have both looked at some sites.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;don&#39;t&quot; seems to make it worse, not better, judging from the stories <br/>
of a couple of other families (not homeschoolers in the area), BUT, in one <br/>
case the kid had run up a big phonebill somehow or credit card bill or <br/>
something--$400.  The dad had huge fits, it resulted in the boy going and <br/>
living with his mom, and then with another family altogether.  There were <br/>
other issues there, but that&#39;s my most recent (three weeks ago) story of <br/>
disasterous response by a parent.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s just bored on the internet and can&#39;t think of other, better places.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could send him more links of cooler stuff to look at.  Things you <br/>
know he&#39;d be interested in.  Don&#39;t say &quot;Look at his instead of the smut you <br/>
usually look at,&quot; just give him options.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I come in and can&#39;t get to yahoogroups because &quot;cookies have <br/>
been disabled.&quot;  I assume (perhaps wrongly, but I don&#39;t want to ask) that one <br/>
of my boys went somewhere they didn&#39;t want me to know about.  I could be <br/>
wrong.  I&#39;ve found evidence of peeks at free sites a couple of times, <br/>
probably from both of them, but not often, at all.<br/>
<br/>
I sent Marty and Kirby a sex site once--a sex education and contraception <br/>
question and answer site.  Neither one said a word, but I bet they looked.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has, in his bathroom, one cosmopolitan and one printed out text story <br/>
from the internet--a fan story with sex.  I leave them where I found them and <br/>
don&#39;t make a deal about it.<br/>
<br/>
I let them have privacy on the computer.  They have passwords I don&#39;t know, <br/>
and I don&#39;t very often use the pull-down to see what sites the person before <br/>
me saw.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wasn&#39;t Catcher in the Rye a bit hit with teenaged boys at one time?  My son <br/>
outlaw says that it was Penthouse Forum that did it for him.  Reading the <br/>
fantasies let him make his own pictures in his head.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe he&#39;s just bored on the internet and can&#39;t think of other, better places.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He looks late at night, after we&#39;re in bed.  I&#39;m assuming that he uses them <br/>
to masturbate.  Though there&#39;s something about those *long* showers he <br/>
takes......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe you could send him more links of cooler stuff to look at.  Things you<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mostly he looks at mountain biking sites.  I think he can find them better <br/>
than I can.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I sent Marty and Kirby a sex site once--a sex education and contraception<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how I would handle books and magazines.  I found a sex education <br/>
question and answer book at the library and handed it to him.  It&#39;s moved <br/>
around his room a couple of times, so I assume he&#39;s reading it.  I thought <br/>
it would be easier for him to just look for questions he wanted answers to <br/>
and read them, rather than reading a whole book.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If your son is under 18, isn&#39;t porn illegal?  You might want to find out<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The whole point is that I&#39;d like to try to nudge away from porn and towards <br/>
erotica.  The only way I could be said to be providing it now is by not <br/>
using something like Net Nanny.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Then again, having your<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reminds me of when my daughter was in grade 7 and they had a parents open <br/>
house day.  I arrived with Lars in the backpack and stood dutifully at the <br/>
back of the class with the other parents.  What were they studying that <br/>
day?  Sex education.  Did any of the kids learn anything or have their <br/>
important questions answered while their parents were standing back <br/>
there?  Not very likely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178573178">I was forced into temporary employment for a while when my middle son <br/>
was 14.  He ended up being in charge of our littlest one for about a <br/>
week while dh and I both worked before I quit.  I was *really* ready to <br/>
quit and during that week I got this really strong urge to just get out <br/>
of that job and go home, and so I did.  <br/>
<br/>
When I got home, my son was in my office with the door shut.  I put my <br/>
hand on the knob and found it locked.  I said, knowing what he was <br/>
doing, &quot;Why is the door locked?&quot;  And he said in the weakest, most <br/>
guilty voice imaginable, &quot;The door&#39;s locked?  I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s <br/>
locked.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say he opened the door and I swept him aside and found that <br/>
crap on the screen.  He knew it was wrong, or he wouldn&#39;t have locked <br/>
the door.  <br/>
<br/>
I spoke about it with some dear friends of mine and one of them offered <br/>
me some reading for him about how pornography damages women, and I took <br/>
her up on it.  I made him read it and tell me what he learned, in <br/>
detail.  We talked about it and discussed it until I was blue in the <br/>
face.  I was angry and hurt and appalled, but not as appalled as the <br/>
time not long after that I heard him use the term &quot;doggy punch&quot;.  (It <br/>
makes me sick to type it.)  Then he saw the color drain from my face and <br/>
the nausea rise in my throat when I made him explain to me what it <br/>
means.  I think it was *THEN* that he finally realized that I was <br/>
**SERIOUS** about this issue, that I wouldn&#39;t allow it in my house and <br/>
that he had just better get over it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think pornography is a disgrace and subjugates women, and being blase <br/>
about it with my son is shirking my responsibility to my future <br/>
daughter-in-law and granddaughters.  I also think teenage boys can have <br/>
normal, healthy sexual impulses and desires without degrading other <br/>
people.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m no prude, but how can I look myself in the mirror if I raise a son <br/>
who thinks &quot;that&quot; term is humorous?<br/>

<br/>
Pornography celebrates the absence of connection with self in sexuality -- <br/>
it&#39;s lowest common denominator expression of sexuality.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>
invitations to view teens having sex with animals arriving in my email box.  <br/>
A lot of really low life stuff is out there, and I&#39;m not interested in <br/>
reviewing it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fine discussing sexuality and healthy expression with my children.  I <br/>
don&#39;t discuss it in purely physical terms -- I weave in emotional benefits <br/>
and costs, timing and responsibility.  Our family situation has required a <br/>
lot of outside the box discussion.  And yet, I think it&#39;s possible to <br/>
unschool, to value freedom of choice, without accepting everything as <br/>
relevant and appropriate and healthy.  Pornography has no place in this home. <br/>

I worked at a shelter for years, and met sex workers/prostitutes young and old, male and female, as well as lots of other really interesting people (kids too). In many places I&#39;d guess you could do some sort of work with your child/children or they could volunteer on their own, just depends. My children often came with me to work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478437262">Quality Paperback Books  (www.qpb.com) regularly offers erotica.  Not too <br/>
nasty at all, usually.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a site for women out of England, called Cliterati.  Very short <br/>
stories.  Donated by readers.<br/>
<br/>
There is apparently a genre of Japanese animation that has sexual themes.  <br/>
And then there are the manga (I remembered the word!) of those stories.   The <br/>
anime club Kirby&#39;s been in for over a year never watches those, as it was <br/>
formed by a fundamentalist Christian and that&#39;s written into the bylaws. <br/>
[==wait, cancel that recommendation.  I just asked Kirby.  He said &quot;The <br/>
hen-tai is much more vile than real porn. &quot;  He recommends against that--that <br/>
it&#39;s gross fantasy stuff with tentacle rape and stuff.  And you have to be <br/>
21.  And even then it&#39;s too gross, says Kirby.]<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and I think maybe if you live where there&#39;s a used magazine, used <br/>
bookstore where you can get Playboys from different decades that might be <br/>
good.  Or just used Playboys (garage sales, sometimes).  Or new mom-bought.   <br/>
There really is a fair amount of stuff to read, usually a really good <br/>
interview, and then pictures of women who wanted to be in there.  Sometimes <br/>
famous women (sometimes later-famous women).<br/>
<br/>
I agree that just saying no is like telling the ocean to be still.  And <br/>
saying &quot;Not in MY house&quot; is the beginning of dishonesty or moving out, or <br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my boys lying to me.  So far we can talk about things like this, <br/>
and if I draw the line in a place they don&#39;t accept, we&#39;re no longer sharing <br/>
common lives.<br/>
<br/>
Feminist arguments about pornography demeaning women aren&#39;t true across the <br/>
board.  They have a point, but it&#39;s too narrowly focussed, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
There are men who will never, ever have real-life sex.  They will grow, never <br/>
marry, never have a date, and die alone.  Lots of them.  Let them look at <br/>
pictures.  There are women in similar circumstances.  I have a Mormon friend <br/>
who never married, ever.  She wouldn&#39;t settle for imperfection.  I have a <br/>
close friend who has had two boyfriends.  Now she&#39;s nearly 40, very overweight<br/>
, doesn&#39;t much socialize, and doesn&#39;t intend to.  Let her read dirty books if <br/>
she wants to.   I own more erotic stories than I would have if Keith had not <br/>
lived in Minneapolis for three and a half years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598386478">I&#39;ve been debating whether or not to give my opinion on this one. We&#39;ve been <br/>
through something similar, but with a weird twist. You see, my &quot;I never <br/>
throw away any magazine&quot; hubby has every Playboy he ever received since he <br/>
was 18. And he&#39;s had a subscription. It&#39;s never bothered me, and yes the <br/>
articles are good. I have notice the pictures getting downright silly <br/>
lately, though.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my 12 year old son found the old boxes of mags last year. We would <br/>
find magazines, parts of magazines, cut-outs from magazines,etc. in various <br/>
places around his room. We weren&#39;t snooping, just cleaning and such. And he <br/>
wasn&#39;t making a big effort to hide them. My dh and I each had many <br/>
conversations with him about sexuality, respecting women, why a women would <br/>
pose, how it might be harmful, when it&#39;s not, etc. We also asked him not to <br/>
go into the old stashes or share them with his friends. I wasn&#39;t about to be <br/>
known as the Porn Momma. And my dh politely explained that a pristine copy <br/>
of an old Playboy is worth money, a cut up one is worth nothing. My son <br/>
understood that concept right away. :-D<br/>
<br/>
So we boxed up the old copies and they&#39;re stored away. My son hasn&#39;t been in <br/>
them since. Of course, that&#39;s not to say that he&#39;s not looking at the new <br/>
ones lying around. (Yes, the subscription is still current. Men *are* <br/>
visual.) But we treat it like the army. Don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell. I also <br/>
provided ds with books on puberty, sexuality and there are plenty of <br/>
gratuitous shots in most PG-13 movies to keep any 12/13 year old interested.<br/>
<br/>
He did find some internet porn a couple of times and I was very honest with <br/>
him about my feelings. From what I&#39;ve seen that stuff is pretty angry and <br/>
usually gross. Not just pictures of lovely ladies. I told him pretty much <br/>
what others here have been saying about the violence against women and such. <br/>
He agreed that the images disturbed him. I think he prefers what he can find <br/>
lying around the house. I probably wouldn&#39;t hesitate to install filtering <br/>
software if need be. But there seems to be no problem right now.<br/>
<br/>
Issues like pornagraphy are not always black and white for me. There&#39;s lots <br/>
of gray area concerning what bothers me and what doesn&#39;t. One thing I do <br/>
know for sure, though, there is no better male role model for my son than my <br/>
husband. Playboys and all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513069795">There is apparently a genre of Japanese animation<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that has sexual themes.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>20 yrs ago lots of people (of all ages) read what<br/>
appeared, to me, to be pornographic comics,<br/>
everywhere.  Busses, subway, walking along the street.<br/>
In Japan.  The television had lots of nudity. The only<br/>
taboo was pubic hair.  The comics had a blank spot<br/>
where that should be. Bondage, SM, and object or<br/>
animal sex seemed to be popular. It was sold (as well<br/>
as beer and some other alcohol beverages) in vending<br/>
machines on residential street corners. The TV had<br/>
drapes (scarves and such) or a leg lifted to just<br/>
barely (pun) conceal. The biggest taboo that was<br/>
eroticized was guns.  They were fondled, viewed from<br/>
all angles, examined and exclaimed over. Now there is <br/>
popular erotic animation, some of which is written to<br/>
the young GIRL audience.  I&#39;ve never seen it, but will<br/>
take Kirby&#39;s word for it. Sounds gross and tacky. <br/>
Jabba the Hut with the Princess Leah on a leash is bad<br/>
enough for me!! Dunno what the easy assess and<br/>
popularity of this stuff has done to Japanese private<br/>
lives.  Its been there a while. Must fill some sort of<br/>
gap or need. The women I asked about it seemed to<br/>
think it was sort of silly of me to have any concerns<br/>
or wonder at all. They were wives and mothers. Their<br/>
thought was that if I was offended, to look the other<br/>
way. <br/>
<br/>
They do have public baths in Japan, for those who<br/>
don&#39;t have bathing facilities at home...or for those<br/>
who prefer the social aspect of group bathing. XDH<br/>
used the baths, I, and sons, did not. He said there<br/>
was a low barrier between the men and women, but it<br/>
could be looked over, if anyone wanted to. <br/>
<br/>
When I was little, I used to look in National<br/>
Geographic, sometimes, to check out the nude folks in<br/>
other parts of the world.  They seem to mostly be<br/>
wearing clothes,now. Even in the hot places.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978252868">Guess I&#39;ll delurk and introduce myself since I can&#39;t resist this thread.<br/>
I&#39;m Peggy, I live in Tucson and have two daughters ages 7 and 10. We&#39;ve<br/>
been lucky enough to spend some time this past fall with Dar and Cacie<br/>
before they return to the left coast. :)<br/>
<br/>
Healthy sexuality starts from the very first moment of a child&#39;s life.<br/>
The perversion of that healthy sexuality isn&#39;t something that happens<br/>
overnight. Men that have grown up around women who were treated<br/>
respectfully don&#39;t want to degrade them and are not aroused by seeing<br/>
others do it. The problem is that we have so much dysfunction around us<br/>
that the &quot;normal&quot; range of sexual appetites in our culture reflects our<br/>
real inner landscapes, as scarred and desolate as they may be. For<br/>
example, children who are brought up in violence grow to find violence<br/>
arousing instead of deplorable. <br/>
<br/>
So, what a 14 yo finds arousing isn&#39;t really up to him or to what he<br/>
reads, it is keyed into a inner landscape that developed along with his<br/>
body. Exposure to pornography doesn&#39;t develop that inner landscape but I<br/>
believe it can channel it, in the same ways that poor friend choices in<br/>
those ages can lead kids down paths they might not have otherwise taken.<br/>

&quot;all demeans women&quot; he might start to wonder what &quot;demeans women&quot; means.<br/>
<br/>
I am personally more offended and see more danger in dishonesty and <br/>
overreaction than I do in pornography itself, so if kids are told no for <br/>
reasons that don&#39;t make sense to them that seems a problem all in its own.  <br/>
And most reasons I&#39;ve seen were about sin, the &quot;dangers&quot; of masturbation, or <br/>

<br/>
Okay -- I&#39;m opposed to pornography, &quot;vile erotica&quot;, as opposed to &quot;artful <br/>
erotica&quot; because  I find it dehumanizing; i.e. deprived of human qualities, <br/>
personality, or spirit. <br/>
<br/>
Sin is not a part of my lexicon.  I&#39;m not even sure what the dangers of <br/>
masturbation are.  Feminist arguments would be those made in the interests of <br/>
women?  Might have me there -- when sexuality is used to express dominance <br/>
(without consent) and anger, that bothers me -- and there&#39;s a lot of <br/>
pornography which uses rape and violence to arouse.  There&#39;s a lot of <br/>
pornography which uses images of young teens and children, which encourages <br/>
men to fantasize about teenage girls.  How many sites are there advertising <br/>
&quot;barely legal teens&quot;?  Many.  There are many countries where teenage girls <br/>
and children are sold into the sex trade -- a bit different than sex <br/>
&quot;workers&quot;.  I think it&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem with 40 year old women reading erotica, even dumb <br/>
erotica.  Nor a grown man who for whatever reason is unable to participate in <br/>
&quot;real&quot; sex and so uses pictures of women or men to aid masturbation <br/>
fantasies.  Not that one requires such a handicap to pleasure oneself.<br/>
<br/>
What I commented on, without being too specific, apologies, was the thought <br/>
that children....those humans under the age of 18...should be allowed privacy <br/>
on their computers.  The implication being, I&#39;m supposing, that if they&#39;re <br/>
interested in those sites offering pornography, they should indulge without <br/>
the burden of parental comment.<br/>
<br/>
Happens I disagree -- not because I&#39;m opposed to sex, sexuality, <br/>
masturbation, erotica, or freedom of religion, speech, choice, gender of <br/>
sexual partner or color of vibrator.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s possible to view pornography as a bad thing to which children <br/>
are better left unexposed, without relying on pseudoscience, religious <br/>
dictates, personal prudery, or strident feminazi as easily dismissed reasons.<br/>

I do know men who claim, at any rate, to find the presentation of teen girls <br/>
as sexual objects disturbing -- and not in terms of arousal.  I can&#39;t speak <br/>
for all of them.  But I do think the internet promotion encourages it.  <br/>

<br/>
And that has been true for a few thousand years that we know of.  <br/>
Will shaming a few American adolescents change it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why does assessment and decision against that sort of behavior equate to <br/>
shaming?  It is possible to calmly discuss something without overreacting, <br/>
without shaming -- it is possible to nod to an arousal without acting on it.  <br/>
It is possible to choose to turn to things which do not dehumanize, and still <br/>
enjoy sexual arousal.<br/>
<br/>
And -- I don&#39;t know if bringing it into the light of day and saying something <br/>
isn&#39;t healthy will change it.  But it&#39;s a start.  We are not at the mercy of <br/>
instinct or whatever it is that we say acknowledge as traditional in the <br/>
sexual pursuit of younger than adult people.  We can choose not to objectify <br/>
children and women -- but if we do not acknowledge that such a change would <br/>
be good -- how are we to get there?  <br/>
<br/>
Saying that something has been done for thousands of years is not <br/>
justification for its occurence.  Nor is it enough of a reason to say, oh <br/>
well -- go ahead as many have before you.  The child or young girl or boy who <br/>
is used in this manner has a life worth protecting.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if American adolescents are gently, not shamedly, given an alternate <br/>
viewpoint -- it&#39;s a start.  Not to say, forget you ever saw it, although it <br/>
would be nice if they didn&#39;t -- but why it&#39;s an unhealthy alternative.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Learning to view the representations of people as<br/>
having REAL people behind them does help.  To begin to<br/>
understand how the perpetrator/victim relationship<br/>
works helps, too.  <br/>
<br/>
When young men see youngster their own age, or<br/>
younger, they are of course curious, but when they<br/>
realize what the tragedies behind this image might<br/>
be...the hero in them is often aroused.  <br/>
<br/>
When my boys noticed (or didn&#39;t and I pointed them<br/>
out) street walkers I would speculate as to what made<br/>
them have to do this dangerous dangerous thing to<br/>
survive.  We talked about why they had to trick (not a<br/>
pun :)) themselves into thinking it was OK....the<br/>
boys, of course were curious....&quot;where, where?&quot; &quot;her?&quot;<br/>
&quot;him?&quot;. We talked about what if it was them? or me? or<br/>
Kyla (the niece we cared for as a toddler).....what<br/>
kinds of situations could trap someone it that kind of<br/>
slavery?  <br/>
<br/>
I tried not to share MY OWN experiences, as I am very<br/>
private, verging on prudish, due to....well that is<br/>
just me, now.  I can be very open in a cerebral sort<br/>
of way, and I am very open when it seems to me to be<br/>
to the benefit (from my point of view) of someone who<br/>
wants or needs benefiting (I try to say, always, &quot;have<br/>
you thought about?&quot; or &quot;This has been my experience&quot;<br/>
something that makes it non-advice, just information. <br/>
It is a counseling technique to prevent dependence and<br/>
attachment....used it with my clients, too). Still, it<br/>
only seems fair to use use myself instead of<br/>
someonelse.<br/>
<br/>
I am guilty of covertly monitoring the boys (and<br/>
Nancy, the sister of whom I had custody from age 11<br/>
and the care and support of off and own from her<br/>
birth) what they read, said, did, and who their<br/>
friends were.  Most of their friends called me Mama,<br/>
too.  I told them, that if they wanted their stuff<br/>
private, they had to do the cleaning.  If I was to do<br/>
the cleaning, then whatever I came across was not<br/>
private.  Huck had a Penthouse under his mattress, I<br/>
looked though it (well, I am curious, too....and i was<br/>
comparing the models to me....and to the girls I KNEW<br/>
he liked. Quite dissimilar) put it back. He also had <br/>
roach farm (REALLY) in his desk in and old aquarium.<br/>
This was a BIG desk with a safe sort of place<br/>
underneath.  I helped him, some, with this project. <br/>
He wanted to enter the Big Roach contest (Texas) and<br/>
win a bunch of money.  David had some Playboys at one<br/>
time.  Moses had some roaches of a different sort and<br/>
some seeds. These and the residue had to go! Jail is<br/>
too big a risk!! We talked about that and the other<br/>
kids and parents and ...... he wondered how I found<br/>
this evidence ..... I just went right to it, actually.<br/>
Mother&#39;s intuition. I told him not to count on it<br/>
(Mother&#39;s intuition) all the time though... he had to<br/>
take responsibility for his own actions...<br/>
<br/>
I once had to fetch Nancy from a juvinal detention<br/>
center.  She, and a gaggle of girls had decided to<br/>
hitch to the beach...on the other side of the state!<br/>
Some of the girl&#39;s mother&#39;s were so angry they wanted<br/>
to let their children spend the night there!...I<br/>
talked everyone into letting me bring them all home. <br/>
There were kids in CHAINS there! Another time, she was<br/>
well, anyway,.......<br/>
<br/>
I wanted them all to know that NO MATTER WHAT, I was<br/>
on their side.  Entirely. But if there was a problem,<br/>
I did need to know eveyrhting about what was going on,<br/>
in order for us to figure out what to do. Nancy was<br/>
the hardest. Not the boys. <br/>
<br/>
The most difficult thing about the boys was cars and<br/>
motorcycles.  Boy insurance costs more.  And they DO<br/>
like to drive fast!  <br/>
<br/>
ALL those years of listening....really listening....to<br/>
what they had to say about everything. I had to be<br/>
interested in all of their selves (including motors)<br/>
, not just one aspect of them, in order for them to be<br/>
able to share with me.... so I knew that David and Kim<br/>
where virgins and that David has never been kissed<br/>
another girl than his wife, Kim.  I know that the<br/>
dental hygienist was stalking Huck.....it was WAY more<br/>
than flirting....and we put together a strategy to<br/>
gently divert her...and when he had a flea bite on the<br/>
edge of his foreskin, he was able to ask me about it<br/>
(at age 14) He and his girlfriend just are a lovely<br/>
couple. And I just helped Moses get a double bed<br/>
instead of the single he had so that he and his<br/>
girlfriend could sleep more comfortably.  She just<br/>
moved in with him.  I even loaned &#39;em my truck to<br/>
move.  I take them frozen dinners to zap. <br/>
<br/>
To me, making a warm beautiful quilt for the young<br/>
couple....and children.....is a way of encouraging<br/>
HEALTHY sexual attitudes.  I write in the corner of<br/>
each quilt &quot;May you always sleep warm and loved.&quot;  Not<br/>
&quot;Sexually satisfied&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Tia, if you were able to wade through all of this, you<br/>
are probably doing just fine with your 14yo.  As long<br/>
as he knows you love him and  care for him and his<br/>
health. And that you have trust in him to make the<br/>
kindest desicions about how to treat others and<br/>
themselves.  I KNOW my kids do.....and always have.<br/>

&gt; Pornography celebrates the absence of<br/>

&gt; it&#39;s lowest common denominator expression<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m fine discussing sexuality and healthy<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t discuss it in purely physical terms<br/>
&gt; -- I weave in emotional benefits<br/>
&gt; and costs, timing and responsibility.  Our<br/>
&gt; family situation has required a<br/>
&gt; lot of outside the box discussion.  And<br/>
&gt; yet, I think it&#39;s possible to<br/>
&gt; unschool, to value freedom of choice,<br/>
&gt; without accepting everything as<br/>
&gt; relevant and appropriate and healthy.<br/>
&gt; Pornography has no place in this home.<br/>

about not limiting tv, computer time, I&#39;ve<br/>
always been a big fan of no food limits, no<br/>
bedtime, etc. but I&#39;m sorry, letting our<br/>
children get into porn is to me similar to<br/>
letting our children get into physically<br/>
hurting another person.  Porn does hurt<br/>
people every day.  I have a good friend who<br/>
lost her home, and went into debt big time<br/>
because her husband thought it was OK to look<br/>
at porn on the computer. It escalated into<br/>
going to strip joints and he had begun to<br/>
visit hookers when the problem came to light.<br/>
He has been &quot;sober&quot; from sex addiction for 4<br/>
years but they are still putting their lives<br/>
back together and still sufferering from the<br/>
financial devistation he caused with his<br/>
addiction.  Also, he still goes to meetings<br/>
(similar to AA) which takes hours away from<br/>
their lives together each week.  She went to<br/>
meetings as well (similar to alanon) for a<br/>
year or two. To me, there are limits to what<br/>
is acceptable, and porn goes way past that<br/>
limit.  The damage it does to people is<br/>
serious. It is simply not acceptable.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I got home, my son was in my office<br/>

&gt; said, knowing what he was<br/>
&gt; doing, &quot;Why is the door locked?&quot;  And he<br/>

&gt; her up on it.  I made him read it and tell<br/>
&gt; me what he learned, in<br/>
&gt; detail.  We talked about it and discussed<br/>
&gt; it until I was blue in the<br/>
&gt; face.  I was angry and hurt and appalled,<br/>
&gt; but not as appalled as the<br/>
&gt; time not long after that I heard him use<br/>
&gt; the term &quot;doggy punch&quot;.  (It<br/>
&gt; makes me sick to type it.)  Then he saw the<br/>
&gt; color drain from my face and<br/>
&gt; the nausea rise in my throat when I made<br/>
&gt; him explain to me what it<br/>
&gt; means.  I think it was *THEN* that he<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196575875">First I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;m very sorry for your friends porn related trouble with her husband. It really sounds like nightmare to have to live through. But when I was finished reading it, I couldn&#39;t help having some thoughts about it.<br/>
<br/>
Why did the husband have a need to look at porn on the computer in the first place? Why did he think it was okay? And was it really because of the computer porn that he had a *need* to go the the strip joints and hookers?<br/>
<br/>
My dh likes to look at porn sometimes, and I&#39;m sure it has come up on the computer from time to time, only because those sites come up out of nowhere sometimes and all of the sudden they&#39;re in your face. But he chooses not to go for internet porn because it seems to be more distasteful and just plain nastier than your average mag or movie. I don&#39;t get insulted or hurt or anything by his looking at porn sometimes. He treats me well, and is a good father and works hard for our family, etc... He is not any less of a good person because he looks at porn. I would definitely draw the line on what kind it is - if it involves children or really hurting other people - I think that&#39;s wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My thought is that in the situation you described with your friend, maybe his parents or religion shamed him or he was made to feel bad for looking at or liking porn when he was younger. He may have been forced to push aside his natural desire to look at it, because he was told those images are wrong, nasty, dirty, etc... So that when he grew up and had the access to it, he really went crazy and became irrational about it. I think there is a very fine line to draw with how you should handle porn with your kids, and I think it&#39;s always healthy to talk about it as much as possible, if you can do it without squirming too much! The issue has not really come up with our boys yet as they are still kind of young (8 and 10) and whatever we have around the house is well hidden. But I am reading this topic with great interest and taking notes for future reference.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Karin<br/>
