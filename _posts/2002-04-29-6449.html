 </span></blockquote>10<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;year-old son? What kind of future interaction which you have with this<br/>
&gt;person? Does it affect your relationship to the club?  ?  ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this is pretty ugly.  <br/>
If you don&#39;t feel like throwing up every time you look at this guy,  you<br/>
might still enjoy your club.  <br/>
<br/>
Is the club exclusive?  <br/>
<br/>
Do any of the dues you pay to the club go in this guys pocket?  That&#39;s an<br/>
AlwaysLearning issue, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something most of us like to think about but even our nice<br/>
neighbors, even our kid&#39;s doctor could have an &quot;interest&quot; like this.   <br/>
If you found another club, unless you&#39;re willing to do a background check<br/>
on every member, you&#39;d run the same risk of mixing with folks who think<br/>
like this.  There&#39;s just no way to know, if they&#39;re not beating you over<br/>
the head with it.<br/>
 <br/>
Can you separate the man from the job?   You might not know until you&#39;ve<br/>
been to the club a few more times, or until you stop puking. <br/>
It&#39;s such a shock to find out something like this about a person you<br/>
respect.  I&#39;m sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
My son will be ten soon and I&#39;d talk to him about it.  I&#39;d tell him how I<br/>
found out and how it made me feel and that I wasn&#39;t sure what to do.  <br/>
<br/>
So, that didn&#39;t help at all.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Even if you don&#39;t take this opportunity to talk about this kind of stuff, <br/>
you&#39;ll have other opportunities, unfortunately. Protecting innocence can <br/>
become protecting ignorance - that seems like one big aspect of what you were <br/>
asking about - when does protecting our children&#39;s innocence go so far as to <br/>
be keeping them ignorant. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We could tell every child what horrible dangers are lurking in the world.  <br/>
Some parents seem to revel in doing that, and then their childhoods are <br/>
ruined.<br/>
<br/>
How much detail do you give a six year old about what could happen to them if <br/>
they get lured into a car by a stranger?  <br/>
<br/>
Racism won&#39;t be created nor destroyed by Matthew&#39;s awareness.  Matthew&#39;s <br/>
youth will be made uglier, though.  <br/>
<br/>
IF, Dan, you really decide to tell him, I have an idea.  Maybe it&#39;s too much <br/>
joy-destruction, or maybe it&#39;s REALLY instructive.   Tell him ONE of the guys <br/>
at the group has a web link to a racist organization.  Don&#39;t tell him which <br/>
one, and see if he can tell by action or word, over the next several meetings.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s a good exercise for all of us.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of your friends and associates believe things you don&#39;t.  Will you <br/>
reduce your circle of contacts to just those who believe as you do?<br/>
<br/>
How many of your friends might have dumped you for some of your parenting <br/>
practices if they weren&#39;t being more open minded?  <br/>
<br/>
Many religions teach negative things about other groups of people.  Many <br/>
(most) Christians not only believe most people on the planet are going to <br/>
hell, they have to HOPE so, or else they have deprived themselves of normal <br/>
lives based on their own interests and desires for  no good reason.    <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would rather my neighbor just didn&#39;t want Kirby to marry his <br/>
daughter than that my neighbor wanted Kirby to burn in eternal torment.   <br/>
Kirby might eventually change his mind about the former.  <br/>

I had never really considered this whole angle. I guess for me,<br/>
sheltering my kid from a lot of the evil in life has never been an<br/>
option, it just wasn&#39;t possible... she&#39;s just been there, and we talked a<br/>
lot about things, but she knew. I was a single mom getting aid from the<br/>
state when she was born, and stayed that way until she was almost 5,<br/>
while I went to college. We paid for food with funky colored &quot;money&quot; and<br/>
got shit from the other people in line for buying things that were &quot;too<br/>
expensive&quot; or &quot;too junky&quot;, we went to too many appointments in big<br/>
crowded places where you get there at 6:30 to get a good place in line,<br/>
even though the door doesn&#39;t open until 7, and there&#39;s always a security<br/>
guard at the door and kids running around and being hit, and someonething<br/>
inevitably goes wrong, if not for us than for someone else, who then<br/>
screams and swears until she is escorted out by said security guard. And<br/>
WIC was another appointment, and then there&#39;s the Section 8 annual<br/>
inspection... and we visited her father in the jails and prisons until<br/>
she was almost 4, which involved waiting, and being searched, and going<br/>
through the metal detector, and waiting some more, and riding the bus<br/>
(she still remembers the bus at Perryville)...We lived right down the<br/>
street from the welfare office when she was born, and people would come<br/>
by and throw food to our dog and we&#39;d go out and ask them not to because<br/>
it made her sick, but gently... it was all there, and we saw a lot of<br/>
people and they all had stories...<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s the whole issue of letting her visit with her dad<br/>
unsupervised, which I started doing when she was 5 or so, because it<br/>
seemed to solve more problems than it created... but he does have that<br/>
&quot;checkered past&quot;, she needed to know that if he drinks or smokes pot,<br/>
call me, and I&#39;ll come get her, and if he hits her, call me, and tell<br/>
me... none of that has ever happened with the two of them (well, except I<br/>
suspect he&#39;s smoked), but it all happened with  him and me. Now her dad<br/>
is homeless, living in his car, and she knows that, although for the<br/>
first few weeks she didn&#39;t. It sucks, she&#39;s worried about him, she<br/>
offered her bedroom floor to him, but he wouldn&#39;t take it... so she got<br/>
him to take a wool blanket and a cake she baked, and felt better, and he<br/>
often sleeps at the highway rest stop nearest to our house, so we see him<br/>
driving home... but it makes you think differently about &quot;the homeless&quot;<br/>
when that means Dad...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a point here. We live differently than a lot of<br/>
people, I guess... it never would occur to me not to tell my kid if<br/>
someone we knew had that link on his webpage. It would never occur to me<br/>
to hide that. Maybe that comes from having been hated as the lazy<br/>
drain-on-the-system welfare mom with the bastard kid. I also spent 6<br/>
years in the psych hospital gulag before Cacie was born, being hated.<br/>
Maybe being hated makes you respond differently to hatred, in any form. <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know if this is better or worse, maybe she would be a happier<br/>
person if I&#39;d been married and middle-class and she didn&#39;t know about all<br/>
this stuff as a little kid. I haven&#39;t spent any time thinking about it,<br/>
really. I imagine she&#39;d be a different person.<br/>

I doubt that Cacie could be happier with any other<br/>
life.  She knows Trouble. And that is OK.  There is<br/>
Trouble and she is still safe, thanks to her Mama.<br/>
There is Trouble and she know what to do. Call Mama.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that her Dad is being so pitiful. But,<br/>
Casie is learning about who is responsible for who. WE<br/>
ARE EACH RESPOSIBLE FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN. <br/>
And that is all. It isn&#39;t wrong to help out someone,<br/>
but what they do with that sympathy and help is up to<br/>
them. You are so wise to let Casie learn this while<br/>
she has her Mama to hold her when it hurts.<br/>

Am sending big hugs to you.O O O O O O O.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, she would be, but then, I love you both just the way you are.<br/>
Sappy, I know, but the truth.  Your experiences have shaped you and I&#39;ll<br/>
never forget how when Anthony (my nephew) wanted to move the bed into<br/>
the other room when we stayed with you and you not only said OK but was<br/>
very much positive about him doing this--you felt this was a perfectly<br/>
acceptable and wonderful idea and by this ONE ACTION and ATTITUDE I<br/>
learned more then I learned from many parenting books.  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I agree with what you said.  It would have been nice to protect my<br/>
children from racism and all the other crap out there, but I couldn&#39;t.<br/>
Janene was only 9 months old and she has no memory of not being served<br/>
at denny&#39;s but Lexie does.  They pass a Denny&#39;s and stick their tongues<br/>
out and I almost want to teach them the finger so they can do that, but<br/>
for now their antics of flipping off Denny&#39;s with their tongues and body<br/>
language is enough.   I cried for a long time over Denny&#39;s, because it<br/>
did shatter Lexie&#39;s innocence. For months and months afterwards we&#39;d go<br/>
out to eat and as we would get out of the car Lexie would ask &quot;mommy are<br/>
you sure they serve black people here?&quot;  And while occassionally I would<br/>
laugh and say &quot;no they serve chicken and steak, not humans&quot; mostly I<br/>
just reassured her that I believed there wouldn&#39;t be a problem but I had<br/>
my doubt too.  Always before I woudl walk into a place to eat, knowing I<br/>
would be served, demanding not only simply food, but good service, that<br/>
my ice water be filled up promtly and that my food be cooked to my<br/>
liking but now, I had doubts that I would even be served ice water at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has a little white, beautifully red headed child named<br/>
meg.  Meg is a year younger than Lexie and the other day her mother was<br/>
telling me she bought a book and it wasn&#39;t until she was reading it to<br/>
Meg that she realized that the book was talking about how everyone has<br/>
different color skins and how they can still be friends.  She said she<br/>
distracted Meg and didn&#39;t finish the story--she said Meg doesn&#39;t realize<br/>
that Lexie and Meg have different colored skins and has never had the<br/>
idea that children of different colors might not get along and she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to plant that idea into her child&#39;s head. And while I<br/>
disagree with the first point (I&#39;m sure that Meg has noticed the<br/>
difference in skin color, she just doesn&#39;t care and hasn&#39;t commented on<br/>
it as yet), I don&#39;t know that it is always such a good idea to protect<br/>
our children from the bad stuff.  Although maybe if my children were<br/>
white and I lived in an area where I was able to fool myself better and<br/>
say that racism is less than it was 30 years ago, maybe I would want to<br/>
protect my children.  But I don&#39;t, and we don&#39;t, and I can&#39;t fool<br/>
myself.  Racism is alive and well, although more subtle--most of the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad but Mark and I have talked about an aspect of education that<br/>
most of you have never thought of--how do we prepare our children for<br/>
the first time they are called a nigger.  What will they say, how will<br/>
they respond.  I remember being called a nigger lover when I was about 7<br/>
and I had never heard the word and had no idea how to respond.  How does<br/>
one respond to that?  Lexie has watched Roots, she&#39;s read Amastad, not<br/>
just the kid&#39;s version but I read to her the adult version, and she<br/>
watched the movie. She is getting an education about her past so that<br/>
she can be better prepared to deal with the future.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t know the answer to the question.  I guess if this man is<br/>
not the teacher, and only is one of the other members, then I&#39;d leave<br/>
well enough alone. But I would let my son know, and I&#39;d let him know<br/>
which one.  Two years ago we lived near a white supremist. I would see<br/>
him driving and walking his dog, etc.  I knew he was--he had a bunch of<br/>
telling stickers on his white truck, shaved head, and stared at me every<br/>
time he saw me and the girls together.  Lexie was younger but now, I<br/>
think I would point out his car, point out the confederate flag and the<br/>
other stickers--she needs to know this person, and know that he is not<br/>
one to trust. See Lexie, this is why, this is the signs, see the flag,<br/>
see the shaved head, be aware, be careful.  Knowledge is power,<br/>
information is key to making good decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said last night at a LLL meeting--I only read books that say<br/>
what I want to hear, that say breastfeeding is good, to not circ, etc.<br/>
I was thinking--how narrow minded that is.  I read everything and then<br/>
make up my own mind.  It was only after reading Ferber&#39;s book that I<br/>
truly understood why someone might want to do that to a baby, and also<br/>
that everything the man said was not bad--he had some good ideas about<br/>
sleep, just not about teaching babies to sleep alone.  I read<br/>
bottlefeeding without a clue (Sorry, bottle feeding without guilt) cover<br/>
to cover, because it gave me insight into how women think and better<br/>
helps me support women in breastfeeding.   It&#39;s unpleasant to teach my<br/>
child about racism, about the holocaust, to help give her the<br/>
information she needs to protect her self against those that would take<br/>
advantage of her sex, her age, her race, her desire to please.  But I<br/>
want her to be a strong black woman (she doesn&#39;t have a choice about the<br/>
black part ;-) and so this information is necessary (and btw, we haven&#39;t<br/>
talked about the holocaust yet, but we will in a few years).<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;ve rambled enough and avoided doing the dishes.<br/>

&lt;&lt; .   I cried for a long time over Denny&#39;s, because it<br/>
 did shatter Lexie&#39;s innocence. For months and months afterwards we&#39;d go<br/>
 out to eat and as we would get out of the car Lexie would ask &quot;mommy are<br/>
 you sure they serve black people here?&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry Joylyn.<br/>
What an awful experience....I just can hardly believe that something like <br/>
this happened in todays world.<br/>
Of course that&#39;s coming from my caucasian looking self. <br/>
I&#39;m not naive about prejudice. I lived in Hawaii and got spit on, tormented <br/>
and treated pretty bad by many natives over there for the year we lived in <br/>
Kona. White people were not welcome, unless they had lived there from birth <br/>
and looked the part.<br/>
My family is racially mixed by adoption. Eskimo, Indian and Caucasian.<br/>
And living in the South has made me realize that the KKK is alive and <br/>
well....something I could hardly believe at first. I thought they were <br/>
scattered and few in number. Not so.<br/>
So I guess I am a little naive after all.<br/>
But I still just get a huge knot in my stomache thinking of your family being <br/>
treated this way!!<br/>
Denny&#39;s ought to be sued. That is inexcusable.<br/>
I didn&#39;t like them as it was, I guarantee I&#39;ll never eat there again after <br/>
hearing this.<br/>

<br/>
I agree it is unbelievable that this could happen today. But, sadly, it does. <br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a home where my father was a quiet racist. He grew up in a time when he (a white child) never went to school with black children. He used to apologize to my sister and I because we (as he would say) &quot;had to go to school with them&quot;. I really didn&#39;t understand what he was talking about. My grandmother, (his mother) would make racial slurs to my sister and I about black parts of town, of which I really never understood. I don&#39;t know what it was that made me not see what they were saying. I was always the kind of person who saw people, not color. It was when I became an adult that I saw racism, but to my surprise it was against me. The truth is, I will  never know what it feels like to be called a nigger... (that word is hard to type, yuk). What surprised me was how racist some black people were. At first I thought it was just simple racism, when they called me racist names, and referred to my children in the same way. But now, while it still hurts, I think it was more of a feeling that they wanted to retaliate for all the hurtful racist remarks made to them by other white folks. I think we all need to realize that racist remarks, or web sites or books or any form of racism is harmful. It doesn&#39;t matter if the racist remark is intended for white or black folks. We are all human beings, all with feelings, and it&#39;s harm is more outreaching than you might think. I am so sorry for what happened to you at Denny&#39;s. I can never know exactly how that felt, I am still very crushed by the way you were treated.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder will we, (people) ever grow? Will we ever stop hating? We all, black and white, need to find a place to start. I really don&#39;t think we have come very far in the past 30 years, I think in some ways we are right where we started.<br/>
<br/>
These are just some of my thoughts,<br/>

felt, finding that link and all it implies.  <br/>
In addition to the racist junk he got a smack in the face from someone he<br/>
admired and respected.  This has probably happened to everyone, sometime<br/>
or other, but when it&#39;s over a subject like racism it seems even worse. <br/>
We try so hard to be decent people and hope so much our children will.  <br/>
Then there&#39;s that whole guilty by association thing. Not to mention,  &quot;if<br/>
you&#39;re not part of the solution, you&#39;re part of the problem.&quot;   It&#39;s a<br/>
wonder we haven&#39;t all gone insane.   <br/>
I don&#39;t know how to answer Dan&#39;s question.   How far do you go?  If you<br/>
know Wal-mart pays Chinese workers less than Chinese minimum wage (that&#39;s<br/>
what  38 cents an hour? )  Do you stop shopping at Wal-mart?   If you<br/>
know the Department of Livestock is killing Yellowstone Bison every day,<br/>
do you stop paying your taxes?   If you don&#39;t, are you part of the<br/>
problem?  Is it just the same as going to a club every week with a nut<br/>
job?<br/>
<br/>
None of us believe in the public school system, but we all pay for it.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do, and what do you leave alone?<br/>
  <br/>
I&#39;m sorry for you Dan.  It&#39;s still bothering you after two years and I<br/>
guess that just means you&#39;re a nice guy.  <br/>

in california, both Northern. One is from Florida.  I did retain an<br/>
attorney but I had no witnesses, other than children, and Denny&#39;s was<br/>
not admitting to anything but shoddy service.  They have lost all three<br/>
lawsuits, but I know that about a year ago there was another one, I<br/>

Other than the victims...  That&#39;s a bummer that they say &quot;just children.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I was hit by a creep, who did $1800 worth of damage to my van.  I didn&#39;t know <br/>
he was a creep until he lied to the insurance company, saying I pulled into <br/>
his lane which I DID NOT.  I had Kirby and Holly as witnesses, but they were <br/>
related to the driver (never mind that Holly was sitting where his car hit, <br/>
in a carseat, and Kirby was 10 or 11 and should&#39;ve been listened to).  <br/>
<br/>
But still, I think if certain restaurants in northern California and Florida <br/>
did something dispicable, it doesn&#39;t follow that boycotting the Denny&#39;s in <br/>
Santa Fe will make the world a better place.  Or encouraging kids to stick <br/>
tongues out at it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate if a family stuck their tongue out at my house every time they <br/>
passed by, or my business, or my church, or my favorite record store, if it <br/>
was based on something that happened several states away.<br/>
<br/>
(Now you&#39;ll probably say &quot;Hey!  It happened in Santa Fe!!&quot; &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Marty, for a couple of years, said &quot;I HATE THAT PLACE&quot; every time we passed <br/>
the Methodist church on Constitution, east of Wyoming (I&#39;m naming this place <br/>
because Joylyn&#39;s from Albuquerque).  Why?  Because one day I left him and <br/>
Kirby at a Mom&#39;s Day Out so I could go Christmas shopping, and Marty had a <br/>
bad time.<br/>
<br/>
I finally convinced him it wasn&#39;t the fault of the building, nor of the <br/>
Methodists in general, nor of churches in general, and that the people who <br/>
were working there that day were probably long gone.  <br/>

really blame them.  Now, 11 or 12--there would be no excuse.<br/>

&gt; into<br/>
&gt; his lane which I DID NOT.  I had Kirby and Holly as witnesses, but<br/>
&gt; they were<br/>
&gt; related to the driver (never mind that Holly was sitting where his car<br/>
&gt; hit,<br/>
&gt; in a carseat, and Kirby was 10 or 11 and should&#39;ve been listened to).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; But still, I think if certain restaurants in northern California and<br/>
&gt; Florida<br/>
&gt; did something dispicable, it doesn&#39;t follow that boycotting the<br/>
&gt; Denny&#39;s in<br/>
&gt; Santa Fe will make the world a better place.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that is true, especially as many are owned by individuals, and<br/>
others are owned by the corp.  But to me, it makes me feel better to not<br/>
give any of my money to a company that has had such serious problems.<br/>
Sure, maybe they are doing better now... but.... The original complaints<br/>
came out in the late 80&#39;s, and Mark and I decided then not to eat<br/>
there.  The only reason we did so on that night is that I was alone,<br/>
traveling with two children who had slept through our usual stopping<br/>
place (barstow) and the kids woke up, hungry, right before this little<br/>
town with a huge thermometer in the middle of the desert.  I had a few<br/>
things to eat in the car but not a meal and we were still 2 hours<br/>
outside of Vegas, where Mark was playing for 9 weeks.  We would go every<br/>
other weekend.  I had been trying to get out of town, to beat traffic,<br/>
and was planning on stopping at the grocery store in barstow but when<br/>
the kids were asleep I changed my plan and pushed on, thinking I&#39;d stop<br/>
for food in vegas.  When we hit baker and the kids were awake, there<br/>
weren&#39;t a lot of choices. So I too thought--hmm, those cases happened in<br/>
Northern CA, and in Florida, and that was a few years ago, surely<br/>
they&#39;ve changed, and I have two hungry kids and I&#39;m white.... So I<br/>
stopped.  Wrong decision.  So for me, I just won&#39;t give my money to<br/>
Denny&#39;s, and I won&#39;t risk taking my children into a place where this has<br/>
happened to them, I won&#39;t even suggest it, even if they would allow it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or encouraging kids to stick<br/>
&gt; tongues out at it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have a very good point, but I think for Lexie and Janene, it&#39;s very<br/>
cathartic.  Lexie especially still struggles over this and I think it<br/>
makes them feel better. But I think you are right, I think I will<br/>
mention next time that maybe they need to put this behind them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d hate if a family stuck their tongue out at my house every time<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; passed by, or my business, or my church, or my favorite record store,<br/>
&gt; if it<br/>
&gt; was based on something that happened several states away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Now you&#39;ll probably say &quot;Hey!  It happened in Santa Fe!!&quot; &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Marty, for a couple of years, said &quot;I HATE THAT PLACE&quot; every time we<br/>
&gt; passed<br/>
&gt; the Methodist church on Constitution, east of Wyoming (I&#39;m naming this<br/>
&gt; place<br/>
&gt; because Joylyn&#39;s from Albuquerque).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, St. Pauls United Methodist Church.  I was married there, as was my<br/>
sister. I attended youth group there, taught sunday school and also<br/>
worked in the Mother&#39;s day Out program for about 6 months one year, when<br/>
I was in college.  My sister&#39;s in-laws go to church there still and I&#39;m<br/>
sure I&#39;m still a member on the books, at least.  I have fond memories of<br/>
that church, and I might visit once in a while but I doubt if I&#39;ll ever<br/>
attend again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why?  Because one day I left him and<br/>
&gt; Kirby at a Mom&#39;s Day Out so I could go Christmas shopping, and Marty<br/>
&gt; had a<br/>
&gt; bad time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hmm, that woudl be too funny if it were I that was watching the kids on<br/>
that particular day. What would be the odds.  I think I worked there in<br/>
1984 ish...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I finally convinced him it wasn&#39;t the fault of the building, nor of<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Methodists in general, nor of churches in general, and that the people<br/>
&gt; who<br/>
&gt; were working there that day were probably long gone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well, not necessarily. Millie Conrad (my sister&#39;s in laws) have been<br/>
going to that church for as long as we have known them. It was the<br/>
church of my youth, my parents ran the youth program when I was a<br/>
child.  Millie was my brother&#39;s preschool teacher in 1974 something, and<br/>
then Julie and her son were married, and then my grandmother lived with<br/>
her mother-in-law for a while, until the mil died and then Millie found<br/>
another old lady from the church for my grandmother to live with until<br/>
that old lady died... anyway, I guess that church and our family are<br/>
pretty interwined together.  Interesting Kirby has bad memories, well I<br/>
guess I do too. Bad and good.  OK ramble over.  just the mention of the<br/>
church brought backa lot of memories... interesting....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not you might not be on the&quot;books&quot; anymore.  They<br/>
purge the enrollment of not active &quot;members&quot; after a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I attended St Paul&#39;s Methodist Church in<br/>
Tallahassee was 1966 or 7.  When I asked, I was told<br/>
that Blacks &quot;would be politely shown to the basement<br/>
to listen to the sermon on the intercom&quot;. Ast. Pastor<br/>
Ewing, with his bald head, told me this. He did have<br/>
the grace :-) to blush. I argued some, and left, most<br/>
of the rest of the Methodist Youth Fellowship left<br/>
with me. The &quot;policy&quot; was changed a few years later,<br/>
but it took effort. Lots of organized efforts were<br/>
made in  desegregation during this time (66-71)and<br/>
some progress was made in lots of areas (work place,<br/>
housing, food service, places of worship, etc.)<br/>
. We went to lots of churches in small groups to see<br/>
what would happen. We didn&#39;t get glad handed, but then<br/>
again, nobody was &quot;politely shown to the basement&quot;<br/>
either. Actually I personally never did go back to<br/>
that particular institution. <br/>
<br/>
Oh yes,Independence for the Blind used their community<br/>
room and kitchen one year for banquette. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  St Paul&#39;s Methodist Church is worse than<br/>
Denny&#39;s.  They weren&#39;t honest bigots. They were<br/>
basement bigots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-935489563">I tend toramble on and on so I am just going to skip to my question this timewithout providing a bunch of background information. I&#39;m just wonderingwhat any of you would do if you think/know that one of your teenagerswas smoking marijuana and/or drinking? I know that a lot of teenagersexperiment and don&#39;t become drug addicts/alcoholics but I still havebig concerns about health and safety. I will provide more informationif necessary but I would just like to know if anyone else hasexperienced this and how you handled it or if you haven&#39;t experiencedit, how would you handle it? Any thoughts or comments on this would begreatly appreciated. Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278756336">-=- I&#39;m just wonderingwhat any of you would do if you think/know that  <br/>
one of your teenagerswas smoking marijuana and/or drinking? I know  <br/>
that a lot of teenagersexperiment and don&#39;t become drug addicts/ <br/>
alcoholics but I still havebig concerns about health and safety.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids knew before they were old enough to even want to drink that  <br/>
alcoholism can be genetic and that my mom was a life-ruining alcoholic  <br/>
(ruining more lives than her own).  They knew that their cousins (my  <br/>
sister&#39;s kids) had three alcoholic grandparents, where they only have  <br/>
one.  And sure enough, one of those cousins has had serious problems  <br/>
with alcohol and drugs.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, in the 1960&#39;s, I saw dozens of families broken apart  <br/>
because the parents over-reacted to children&#39;s experimentations with  <br/>
sex, drugs and rock&#39;n&#39;roll.   I saw suicides and I saw other horrors  <br/>
that weren&#39;t useful or necessary, and when the parents were drinkers,  <br/>
cigarette smokers or pill users, the hypocrisy only added to the tone  <br/>
of the responses of all their friends and relatives.<br/>
<br/>
What I have done is remind my kids about laws and safety, not  <br/>
naggingly (I&#39;d like to think), but just as I&#39;d remind them about being  <br/>
careful about the electric bill or turning their car lights on if it&#39;s  <br/>
raining.  But my kids never did go to school, and we&#39;ve been and  <br/>
stayed close all that time.  They&#39;ve talked to me when they were  <br/>
drinking.  Not all ran home and said &quot;I smoked marijuana!&quot; when they  <br/>
did, but I know at this point that each of them has.  Not all &quot;do&quot; in  <br/>
the do-it-all-the-time way.  Only one is legally old enough to drink,  <br/>
but all three have, at parties.<br/>
<br/>
I could have made a big deal about it.  I could have grounded them.  I  <br/>
could have punished them.  Then what?<br/>
<br/>
If the situation you&#39;re asking about involves a child who was in  <br/>
school for a long time, or parents who haven&#39;t been involved in  <br/>
alternative ways of parenting, then the situation will be entirely  <br/>
different.  If it&#39;s a step-child situation with other parents  <br/>
elsewhere, again it&#39;s completely different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658263560">first - take a deep breath, and *know* - really really know - that you can&#39;t control them.  ALL you have to rely on, with matters of potential risk is your relationship - your connection.  and overreaction, or restriction, will result in a fractured relationship and no more (and probably less) actual control over what they do in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
then, after you really really know that, more details about your relationship, the age, their history, etc., *would* be helpful, because it matters a lot in terms of how accessible they are to you.  <br/>
<br/>
i tend to talk more about the risks of the *environment* in which that stuff often happens - the people, the loss of impulse control, the legal concens, and the lack of protection.  reefer madness type messages are not very effective, because they are untrue and undermine your kids&#39; respect for you knowledge and wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
i have  been very honest with my kids, once they asked, about my own history and it lends validity to my suggestions and concerns, i think.  <br/>
<br/>
i just resurrected this article from my &quot;archives&quot; the other day, and it&#39;s somewhat applicable:<br/>
