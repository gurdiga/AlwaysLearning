I just said to my husband last night... you know ... it is just a matter of <br/>
time before we are going to get blasted with &quot;questions&quot;  Because it is the <br/>
fall ... my daughter would be in the first grade...  They really are wanting to <br/>
&quot;talk&quot; about everything... I believe  it is so they can give us the&quot;answers&quot; <br/>
and &quot;save our children&quot; after discussing their concerns.....<br/>
I would physically buy and deliver to her a book or two on homeschooling.<br/>
The Homeschool Book of Ansers is great bdcause the name is general, but it&#39;s <br/>
pretty unschoolish.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;How Children Fail&quot; or anotherschool-focussed John Holt book?<br/>
<br/>
Tell her that after she&#39;s finished reading them you&#39;ll be glad to discuss it <br/>
with her.  If she starts in at all you can just say &quot;Did you finish the <br/>
books?&quot;  If no, say (again, in review &lt;g&gt;), &quot;When you&#39;ve read those books, you&#39;ll <br/>
understand.&quot;  And remind her that until she&#39;s read about it, she&#39;s not really <br/>
qualified to discuss it with you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She urgently asked,,, WELL.. what DO you DO on a typical day?  She went on <br/>
and said...-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are typical days collected here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
If she dosn&#39;t have internet access, you can make &quot;tsk tsk&quot; noises about how <br/>
CRUCIALLY important it is to have that, and how all the information one could <br/>
want is right there.<br/>
<br/>
If she does have internet, you don&#39;t have to discuss it until she&#39;s read some.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I said... Kim... gotta go... before I could say anything else.. SHE said,, <br/>
GOOD        BYE and hung up on me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well GOOD!  From your subject line, I thought you were frustrated with your <br/>
OWN family, not your parents&#39; family.  Priorities!  They can be faily-like by <br/>
being supportive, or they can be hostile-stranger like and find themselves on <br/>
the outside.  You don&#39;t have to answer to your sister.<br/>
<br/>
-=-ahhhhhhhhhhhh   Do I come from a freakishly narrow minded family?  Has <br/>
anyone ever encountered this?-=-<br/>
<br/>
My sister used to tell me her problems just about every single day.   When <br/>
she&#39;d say &quot;Well kids have to...&quot; or &quot;they have no choice...&quot; I&#39;d say &quot;they don&#39;t <br/>
HAVE to&quot; or &quot;My kids don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that up.  It&#39;s been awhile.  Her oldest is grown now, and the boys <br/>
are 16 and 17.<br/>

-=-What in the heck do I say to my daughter???  I don;t want her to be nasty, <br/>
but I don;t want her to feel walked on either???!!=-<br/>
<br/>
Tell her the truth in small bits.  They&#39;re  mystified.  They&#39;re jealous.  <br/>
They don&#39;t know HOW to talk to people ift hey can&#39;t talk about school.<br/>
<br/>
Holly made up a hard addition question and memorized the answer. It was <br/>
something like 57 + 38 (i don&#39;t remember) so if they would say &quot;what&#39;s 5+5?&quot; she <br/>
would either give the answer or say I don&#39;t know, and then ask them HER <br/>
question.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371361484">Cynthia I feel for you! My bestfriend and I are at odds with the whole <br/>
homeschooling, attachment parenting life styles. We can talk about our extended <br/>
families; parents, grandparents, siblings, etc. We can talk about her work, and <br/>
our husbands, and other friends. But we absolutely cannot talk about my <br/>
homeschooling or anything that has to do with attachment parenting. She of the <br/>
bottle-feeding because she just can&#39;t bear to think about anyone at her breast. Let <br/>
the baby cry it out, because they will never learn to sleep or be independent <br/>
otherwise. They have to do homework, go to school, or they will never learn how <br/>
to socialize, do tests, or any other canned response you choose to insert <br/>
here. I just love her, she is like my sister. BUT we just can&#39;t talk about some <br/>
of the most important things in my life and as you know, that just plain hurts. <br/>
<br/>
The other day we were talking about her cousin (also a friend of mine), who <br/>
is about to have a baby. We were talking about how anal the cousin is about her <br/>
babies, and my friend told me that she doesn&#39;t understand why she is that way <br/>
because, (quoting here) &quot;babies have immunities from their mother that last <br/>
for months&quot; I said yes that is true if the baby is being breastfed...  insert <br/>
longgggg heated discussion here... we ended up getting off the phone angry with <br/>
each other. <br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t know how this helps you. But I do understand, as I am sure most <br/>
here do too. I wish there were easy answers. I would suggest giving your sister <br/>
some books on the subject and referring her to some of the articles on <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site and telling her you are happy to discuss any questions she may have <br/>
AFTER she reads some. Although, to me, that sounds like assigning her homework, <br/>
but if it works... I&#39;ve tried this tactic with my bestfriend, my MIL, and my <br/>
own sister, so far they all insist on knowing what they know and being closed <br/>
minded about the whole thing. My MIL said that for every book or article I could <br/>
produce on homeschooling, she could produce one that proved it would never <br/>
work. While I don&#39;t doubt she could go article to article with me, I wonder that <br/>
she could ever find as many anti-homeschooling books as homeschooling books. <br/>
I hate to be negative about it, and I hope it works for you. I did finally <br/>
tell my bestfriend that I just couldn&#39;t listen to her complaining about her kids <br/>
school, homework, teachers, and class mates because she knows how I feel about <br/>
all of that. And when she asks me what I would do in such and such situation, <br/>
I remind her that I am living example of what I think she should do. I guess <br/>
that would be my best advice, always be a living example. <br/>

You could challenge her to try.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902815433">Cynthia, I&#39;m sorry you had to fight with your sister.  So far, I have been <br/>
able to duck these confrontations, but I know they will be coming.<br/>
<br/>
I think your sister is mad that her precious school is assigning so much <br/>
homework and she is mad that you&#39;ve found a way out.  At this point, she has put <br/>
all her eggs in the school basket and can&#39;t admit that maybe you are right...or <br/>
at least make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that anytime I say that I homeschool, the person I am talking <br/>
too gives me unending complaints about school.  It&#39;s strange.  Mostly I just <br/>
sit and listen.  I did make a friend mad when she was going on and on about <br/>
something with her schooled child and I finally made the comment that I was glad <br/>
I would never have to deal with that crap.  People are so invested in school <br/>
and maybe they are afraid to try homeschooling themselves, so they take it out <br/>
on us.<br/>
<br/>
I would quit calling your sister.  I don&#39;t mean stop talking to her, I just <br/>
noticed that you said you called her.  I had to take that advice once myself, <br/>
everytime I called my family I got my feelings hurt.  A wise friend said &quot;then <br/>
why are you calling them?&quot;.  I greatly reduced my calls and I started feeling <br/>
better.<br/>

I think you did so well on trying to get off the school subject and also <br/>
remain calm. Give yourself a pat on the back for that. I have no advice.  We live <br/>
so far away from family that it is a non-issue.  They really have no concrete <br/>
idea what we do and we only see each other every couple of years and talk on <br/>
the phone about once a month.  But I do feel for ya.<br/>
