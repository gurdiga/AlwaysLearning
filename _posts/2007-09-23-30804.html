<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482639266">the history and cause of restrictions concerning servants and lower  <br/>
classes...<br/>
<br/>
Another aspect of social  history I want to touch on just a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
 From times and places where it was illegal to help a slave learn to  <br/>
read to schedules in English stately homes that required servants to  <br/>
be up very late AND up very early (no eight hours of sleep for them,  <br/>
ever), there are common themes.<br/>
<br/>
WHY should some people be limited to a place and to a subset of  <br/>
information?<br/>
So they won&#39;t get ideas.<br/>
<br/>
So if you don&#39;t want your kids to get ideas, keep them away from TV  <br/>
and books and movies and people you haven&#39;t hand picked.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have always wanted my kids to get ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care if they know more than I know, or if the things they  <br/>
learn cause them to reject things I believe.<br/>
<br/>
I want them to be rich with knowledge and images and thoughts and  <br/>
contact people and opportunities.  I want their world to be BIGGER,  <br/>
not smaller.<br/>
<br/>
Some people homeschool to protect their kids from ideas and people.   <br/>
Some people think school tells kids too much.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think those people can be (nor would want to be) successful  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I think school tells people way, WAY, too little and far, FAR too  <br/>
lamely.  I want my kids to know what the teachers missed knowing, and  <br/>
not limit themselves to a 180 day curriculum (okay, really more like  <br/>
160, honestly) based on what would fit easily into 45 minute sessions  <br/>
and break into units and test easily.  Things that teachers can use  <br/>
to &quot;prove&quot; kids are learning (so nothing too esoteric or open-ended).<br/>
<br/>
And I absolutely do NOT want a school categorizing my kids as servant- <br/>
class, blue-collar-class, teach-a-trade, forget literature and music...<br/>
<br/>
Because the prejudice that some people just don&#39;t need to know much  <br/>
exists still.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540389067">Not at all about the history and cause of restrictions, but<br/>
definitely about wanting Simon and Linnaea to have ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Linnaea and I are reading Ramona the Pest right now and we are spending at <br/>
least as much time discussing the problems we have with the book as we are <br/>
reading it. It is kind of interesting. Today, as we walkied through the <br/>
harvested and hayed barley field I was talking about how Ramona&#39;s <br/>
relationship with adults is all about her trying to be big and expansive and <br/>
loved and seen in positive light, and their response to her is all about <br/>
making her small and manageable and never really looking or listening for <br/>
long enough to see how much she wants to be loved. To which Linnaea replied <br/>
that she is huge and powerful in her life. And I talked about how important <br/>
that was to David and I. Realizing, once again, how easy it is to limit, to <br/>
control, but how much more fantastic it is to listen to her shout out about <br/>
her power.<br/>
<br/>
So, not about history, but about embiggening a life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had the same kind of discussions when reading most Beverly Cleary <br/>
books.  The main thing that kept us interested in the books was the <br/>
fact that we lived right next to the playground pictured here, for a <br/>
lot of years: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.beverlycleary.com/adventures/map.html">http://www.beverlycleary.com/adventures/map.html</a><br/>
<br/>
It put it into a picturesque context for Chamille, and historical as <br/>
well since the neighborhood was very different in many ways as how it&#39;s <br/>
described in the books.</div>

<br/>
Absolutely!  Then, what kids really miss, is that opportunity to <br/>
connect things in their own way that makes it meaningful and <br/>
relevant.  Connections happen, but it&#39;s limited and restricted.  <br/>
Unschooling lets those connections reach into farther and farther <br/>
places leading kids into extraordinary paths.  That&#39;s what I see my <br/>
own kids doing that schooled kids don&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember doing aptitude tests and skill tests that were supposed to <br/>
tell you what you were good at and what careers to consider.  I <br/>
believe that we did those tests in the beginning of middle school to <br/>
help guide you toward which sorts of extracurricular activities to <br/>
explore.  I remember thinking what a small set of career choices <br/>
there were and that I&#39;d like to have tried several of those career <br/>
choices rather than picking one or two.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille is just a little older than I was when I had to take those <br/>
tests.  I&#39;m so glad that she gets to let her life unfold in front of <br/>
her without someone telling her what she needs to know and that she <br/>
should know which direction to go to get there, and worse, following <br/>
the direction that someone else has set for her to follow to get her <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
School makes a very narrow path for kids to follow and tells those <br/>
kids that if they follow it, they will achieve their goals.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t see that to be true at all in what actually happens.  <br/>
<br/>
All I wanted to do was art.  That&#39;s it, well, maybe a few other <br/>
things, but mostly art.  I could&#39;ve spent my entire teen years doing <br/>
that in exclusion to almost everything else.  However, the actual <br/>
amount of time that I spent doing art was so minimal it&#39;s laughable.  <br/>
By the time I was done doing all the other required stuff, my time <br/>
was gone and art was rushed and hurried for some homework project or <br/>
another.  Even now, I find it hard to break those confines, like <br/>
eating dessert last in a way.<br/>
<br/>
In college, my degree program was eliminated a year before I was <br/>
supposed to graduate.  I got my degree, but under special <br/>
circumstances because some of my required courses ceased to exist.  I <br/>
was able to take anthropology as my science instead of biology and <br/>
human anatomy because I reworked my whole required classes.  I could <br/>
understand why those were core requirements for my degree, but after <br/>
taking all the anthropology classes, I could see the benefit of that <br/>
too and could apply it to my field of study.  Not a single person <br/>
with my degree that graduated at my university took those classes, <br/>
they all took the other ones.  I was the last person to graduate with <br/>
my degree from that university.<br/>
<br/>
The school had a set path to study, and after someone followed that <br/>
path, they were considered knowledgable enough to get a degree.  I <br/>
find the whole concept a bit arbitrary.  If DaVinci had tried to get <br/>
a degree in art, would he have come up with all of his inventions and <br/>
mathmatical concepts?  I&#39;ve thought about that a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
In life, what sets someone apart, is their unique abilities or <br/>
knowledge.  If everyone gets cut the same, or molded the same, how <br/>
does that help create a better world?</div>
