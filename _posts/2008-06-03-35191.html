<br/>
Hi Sandra or Always Learning list owner,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Blake and I&#39;m organizing a trip to Argentina this fall for  <br/>
teenage unschoolers.  The 6-week journey will guided by two  <br/>
experienced leaders (myself and Abbi Miller, both advisers at Not  <br/>
Back to School Camp), and its purpose is to create independent  <br/>
travelers.  Abbi and I are investing lots of time and money into  <br/>
successfully making this the first international expedition tailored  <br/>
for teen unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re currently seeking to get the word out to online unschooling  <br/>
groups.  ...<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
