<div id="ygrps-yiv-617621581">Good for awakening ideas about learning:<br/>
<br/>
Mary Poppins<br/>
The Sound of Music<br/>
Ferris Beuller&#39;s Day Off  (too rough for some little kids)<br/>
Heidi (Shirley Temple)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just plain rich with images, characters, history, ideas, STUFF:<br/>
<br/>
Spartacus<br/>
El Cid<br/>
Ben Hur<br/>
Monty Python and the Holy Grail<br/>
Star Wars (all)<br/>
Karate Kid (all three in marathon was cool once!)<br/>
Hamlet (I like the one with Mel Gibson)<br/>
Romeo and Juliet (I like the one from the late 60&#39;s the Zeferelli)<br/>
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat<br/>
O Brother, Where Art Thou?<br/>
The Music Man<br/>
The Last Starfighter<br/>
Last Action Hero<br/>
The Patriot<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think those would be easy to see the wealth in.  When you get better at it, <br/>
more comfortable with what your child likes, knows, and wants to know, you <br/>
could find lots of value in just about any movie.  We had plenty to talk <br/>
about the other day with The Litte Princess, with Shirley Temple.  We talked <br/>
LOTS about characterization and motivation and plot detail after the first <br/>
Ninja Turtle Movie, when the boys were little.  They have learned to milk a <br/>
movie for all it&#39;s worth, and I helped.  Marty came in halfway through Joe <br/>
vs. the Volcano (which I bought at the fleamarket after someone quoted it <br/>
here, or at unschooling.com), and though I offered to rewind it, he was happy <br/>
to just pick up where it was and fall into it.<br/>
<br/>
How NOT to watch movies:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be cynical and critical and dismissive.  Find the good acting, the good <br/>
sets, the good props.  Don&#39;t say &quot;OH BROTHER.&quot;  If there&#39;s a movie you really <br/>
don&#39;t like, don&#39;t watch it with your kids.  For me, that is Robin Hood, <br/>
Prince of Thieves, which I think is atrocious.  I walked out of it in the <br/>
theatre.  It was on TV the other night, and I watched some I had missed that <br/>
first night, and TRIED to watch it to the end, but the script and the acting <br/>
and the whole concept just irritated me beyond bearing, and I turned it off.  <br/>
If someone else had been watching too and been interested, I would have just <br/>
left the room instead and let them watch in peace.<br/>
<br/>
Can others add movies to this list?  I&#39;ll just gather up a list and put it on <br/>
the web and when this discussion comes up again we can send people there for <br/>
viewing ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871183594">Spitfire Grill<br/>
Mask<br/>
<br/>
These are both for older kids, I think.  My daughter&#39;s 11 and they<br/>
seemed to have quite an impact on her.<br/>
<br/>
Did I read about Spitfire Grill here?  I don&#39;t remember.  But it has an<br/>
awful lot to say for a &quot;small&quot; film.<br/>
<br/>
And Mask because it says so much about beauty and love.  My daughter<br/>
kept asking if he was going to have plastic surgery and be cute at the<br/>
end, hoping.  She couldn&#39;t wait to see what he really looked like.<br/>
<br/>
Below is the spoiler, so don&#39;t read it if you don&#39;t already know the end<br/>
of the movies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are the first movies my daughter remembers seeing where the main<br/>
character dies.  It blew her away.  She&#39;d believed it was practically a<br/>
law, that main characters  never die.  You could just watch her face and<br/>
see her mind opening up to possibility as we talked about it.<br/>

3. Click on Add Photo, its below the  Photos  header and above the<br/>
  1-16 of 25 list <br/>
3a.By now you will probably have to close one or more popup ad windows &lt;G&gt;<br/>
4. Where it says  locate and name your photos<br/>
    click the browse button  by photo 1:<br/>
5.  This should bring out your computer&#39;s standard find the file  dialog<br/>
box.  If you put the photo in an easy place to start with, like right on the<br/>
desktop, it should be easy to find it in this dialog box<br/>
6.  Choose the file name of photo you want to post<br/>
7.  this should take you back to the  locate and name your photos page<br/>
8.  scroll to the bottom of the page and click  Upload<br/>
9.  depending upon the size of the photo and your connection this should<br/>
take between a few seconds and a few minutes<br/>
10.  in the add photos confirmation page click  Back to Album.<br/>
11.  Feel the joy and fulfillment that your friends on the AlwaysLearning<br/>
newsgroup can enjoy your Photo<br/>
12.   do the same with a handwriting sample &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330097595">An interesting study<br/>
By Jean Houston<br/>
<br/>
A landmark UCLA study suggests that women respond to<br/>
stress with a<br/>
cascade of brain chemicals that cause us to make and<br/>
maintain<br/>
friendships with other women. It&#39;s a stunning finding<br/>
that has turned<br/>
five decades of stress research-most of it on<br/>
men-upside down.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Until this study was published, scientists generally<br/>
believed that when<br/>
people experience stress, they trigger a hormonal<br/>
cascade that revs the body<br/>
to either stand and fight or flee as fast as<br/>
possible,&quot; explains Laura<br/>
Cousino Klein, PhD, now an assistant professor of<br/>
biobehavioral health at<br/>
Pennsylvania State University in State College and one<br/>
of the study&#39;s<br/>
authors. It&#39;s an ancient survival mechanism left over<br/>
from the time we were<br/>
chased across the planet by saber-toothed tigers. Now<br/>
the researchers <br/>
suspect<br/>
that women have a larger behavioral repertoire than<br/>
just &quot;fight or flight.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In fact, says Dr. Klein, it seems that when the<br/>
hormone oxytocin is released<br/>
as part of the stress response in a woman, it buffers<br/>
the fight or flight<br/>
response and encourages her to tend children and<br/>
gather with other women<br/>
instead. When she actually engages in this tending or<br/>
befriending, studies<br/>
suggest that more oxytocin is released, which further<br/>
counters stress and<br/>
produces a calming effect. This calming response does<br/>
not occur in men, says<br/>
Dr. Klein, because testosterone-which men produce in<br/>
high levels when <br/>
they&#39;re<br/>
under stress - seems to reduce the effects of<br/>
oxytocin. Estrogen, she adds,<br/>
seems to enhance it.<br/>
<br/>
The discovery that women respond to stress differently<br/>
than men was made in <br/>
a<br/>
classic &quot;aha!&quot; moment shared by two women scientists<br/>
who<br/>
were talking one day in a lab at UCLA. &quot;There was this<br/>
joke that when the<br/>
women who worked in the lab were stressed, they came<br/>
in, cleaned<br/>
the lab, had coffee, and bonded,&quot; says Dr. Klein.<br/>
&quot;When the men were<br/>
stressed, they holed up somewhere on their own. &quot;I<br/>
commented one day to<br/>
fellow researcher Shelley Taylor that nearly 90% of<br/>
the stress research is <br/>
on<br/>
males. I showed her the data from my lab, and the two<br/>
of us knew instantly<br/>
that we were onto something.&quot; The women cleared their<br/>
schedules and started meeting with one scientist after<br/>
another from<br/>
various research specialties. Very quickly, Drs. Klein<br/>
and Taylor<br/>
discovered that by not including women in stress<br/>
research, scientists had<br/>
made a huge mistake: The fact that women respond to<br/>
stress differently than<br/>
men has significant implications for our health.<br/>
<br/>
It may take some time for new studies to reveal all<br/>
the ways that oxytocin<br/>
encourages us to care for children and hang out with<br/>
other women, but the<br/>
&quot;tend and befriend&quot; notion developed by Drs. Klein and<br/>
Taylor may explain <br/>
why<br/>
women consistently outlive men. Study after study has<br/>
found that social ties<br/>
reduce our risk of disease by lowering blood pressure,<br/>
heart rate, and<br/>
cholesterol. &quot;There&#39;s no doubt,&quot; says Dr. Klein, &quot;that<br/>
friends are helping <br/>
us<br/>
live longer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In one study, for example, researchers found that<br/>
people who had no friends<br/>
increased their risk of death over a 6-month period.<br/>
In another study, those<br/>
who had the most friends over a 9-year period cut<br/>
their risk of death by <br/>
more<br/>
than 60%. Friends are also helping us live better. The<br/>
famed Nurses&#39; Health<br/>
Study from Harvard Medical School found that the more<br/>
friends women had, the<br/>
less likely they were to develop physical impairments<br/>
as they aged, and the<br/>
more likely they were to be leading a joyful life. In<br/>
fact, the results were<br/>
so significant, the researchers concluded, that not<br/>
having a close friend or<br/>
confidante was as detrimental to your health as<br/>
smoking or carrying extra<br/>
weight! And that&#39;s not all: When the researchers<br/>
looked at how well the <br/>
women<br/>
functioned after the death of  their spouse, they<br/>
found that even in the <br/>
face<br/>
of this bigger stressor of all, those women who had a<br/>
close friend and<br/>
confidante were more likely to survive the experience<br/>
without any new<br/>
physical impairment or permanent<br/>
Yet if friends counter the stress that seems to<br/>
swallow up so much of our<br/>
life these days, if they keep us healthy and even add<br/>
years to our life, why<br/>
is it so hard to find time to be with them? That&#39;s a<br/>
question that has<br/>
troubled researcher Ruthellen Josselson, PhD, coauthor<br/>
of Best Friends: The<br/>
Pleasures and Perils of Girls&#39; and Women&#39;s Friendships<br/>
(Three River<br/>
Press,1998). &quot;Every time we get overly busy with work<br/>
and family, the first<br/>
thing we do is let go of friendships with other<br/>
women,&quot; explains Dr.<br/>
Josselson. &quot;We push them right to the back burner.<br/>
That&#39;s really a mistake,<br/>
because women are such a source of strength to each<br/>
other. We nurture one<br/>
another. And we need to have unpressured space in<br/>
which we can do the <br/>
special<br/>
kind of talk that women do when they&#39;re with other<br/>
women. It&#39;s a very <br/>
healing<br/>
experience.&quot;<br/>
