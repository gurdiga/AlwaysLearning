While that’s a great idea, I think deschooling would be more important for all of them and they should step away from any and everything that any of them associate with school or schoolishness for a few months or a year.<br/>

<br>

<font color="#212121" face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:15px;">History, art (covers, videos), art - music, rhythm, learning to read music, play an instrument, relaxation, technologies, rhythm is math, lyrics are english and language and poetry, pop culture,
 geography and other cultures..(there is no doubt loads more!)</span></font><br>
<br>
<font color="#212121" face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:15px;">Drama:</span></font><br>
<font color="#212121" face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:15px;">Social aspects, story telling, reading, memorisation,&nbsp;</span></font><font color="#212121" face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:15px;">self-confidence and self-expression</span></font><font color="#212121" face="Georgia"><span style="font-size:15px;">,
 art including wardrobes and costumes, sets, etc, various aspects of technology including lighting, sound, recording, etc., often includes aspects of history,&nbsp;geography and culture - especially in the story and wardrobe, and maybe set?</span></font><br>

<p dir="ltr">I have impressed on her the importance of deschooling. But, the situation is fragile and very complex with a dad and step-dad who are both very anti-home ed. I figured that, if my niece wants to play music and go to her drama club more than anything, then knowing things she&#39;s likely to be learning from it other than the obvious will give my sister some negotiating tools when the inevitable &#39;but she&#39;s not doing anything&#39; complaints come. </p></div>

Part of the mom’s deschooling should be NOT LOOKING FOR LEARNING for a while.  Looking at learning that does NOT look like what she thinks she’s looking for.<br/>

At least try to get her off formal music lessons and onto connections.<br/>

Maybe don’t press for unschooling, so much, then. <br/>
<br/>
It’s going to be very hard if the two dads are going to be preventing a cure for damage they have already contributed to.<br/>

<p dir="ltr">I&#39;m not in the slightest. I&#39;m trying to help my sister facilitate a period of deschooling from which they can reassess and make better decisions. In order to do that, she needs bargaining tools and who better to ask than a group of people who really deeply understand how children learn about how she and the dad/step-dad can value the learning inherent in music and drama? </p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555620869">Yes! I was going to say what helped was deschooling and not *needing* to find academically defined learning everywhere.<br/>
It takes time- and cannot be done by others- to develop confidence and to see connections are constantly being made. If we are clinging to schoolish definitions of success, then we miss many chances to see the incredible learning that just happens in life. That is a long process- getting there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your sister&#39;s home ed doesn&#39;t need to be unschooling, or at least for now. Maybe some form of relaxed homeschooling would be a better fit- for their family-  than unschooling? <br/>
