Protecting children from violence in the drug wars in Juarez, Mexico<br/>

<br/>
In the year before the Live and Learn Conference was in Albuquerque,  <br/>
someone said Mexico was only six hours away and people should drive  <br/>
their kids down there and I said no, not Juarez.  Not a good  <br/>
neighborhood for kids to see, and too dangerous.   I was accused of  <br/>
being racist (wt!?!) and ignorant of the glorious and varied culture  <br/>
and geography of Mexico.   Well no...  Just knowledgeable of the not- <br/>
so-varied realities of Ciudad Juarez.  I wanted people to protect  <br/>
their children from having visions of border beggars in their minds,  <br/>
and from possibly being separated from parents in a scary town like  <br/>
that.  There&#39;s money to be made from arresting foreigners.  It&#39;s not a  <br/>
nice city.   Why miss a day of an awesome, safe conference to risk  <br/>
life and peace &quot;to see a foreign country&quot;?  Get enough money to go to  <br/>
Cabo San Lucas or Acapulco someday, but don&#39;t drive through southern  <br/>
New Mexico to Juarez.  Eyew.   College boys get put in jail, where  <br/>
their boots are stolen, and let loose barefooted if someone will bail  <br/>
them out.<br/>
<br/>
There are surely more child protection thoughts in the internet world/ <br/>
parenting world.<br/>

&quot;argues potently that the age-old idea of protecting children from  <br/>
&quot;corrupting&quot; influences which can be traced at least as far back as  <br/>
Plato&#39;s Republic has reached dangerous proportions in the U.S.  <br/>

precedents (from the Supreme Court Butler and Roth decisions in the  <br/>
1950s to lawsuits brought by the ACLU and the American Library  <br/>
Association to remove state mandated Internet filters from public  <br/>
libraries in the 1990s), Heins charts evolving concepts of childhood,  <br/>
based on such diverse sources as Philippe Ari?s&#39;s Centuries of  <br/>
Childhood and SIECUS reports. She points to a new wave of social and  <br/>
sexual puritanism engendered by the political and Christian right,  <br/>
which takes a variety of forms, including Wendy Shalit&#39;s 1999 A Return  <br/>
to Modesty and groups such as MOMS (Mothers Organized for Moral  <br/>

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s about children.  The only reference I know of is  <br/>
Onan, who was told by God to go in and do his brother&#39;s wife (his dead  <br/>
brother&#39;s wife?  I forget) and he didn&#39;t really want to impregnate  <br/>
her, so he &quot;spilled his seed on the ground,&quot; and God got pissed off.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he masturbated it onto the ground.  Is there other?  (I  <br/>

------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard of any other specific references to masturbation... but <br/>
I do know that I&#39;ve never heard the Jewish tradition say that the Torah <br/>
is protecting children from masturbation.  First of all, children are <br/>
minors and not obligated in, or held responsible for, the laws.  Second, <br/>
the issue of spilling seed only applies to men, and its about wasting <br/>
and procreation, not about self-pleasuring.  So its pretty complicated.  <br/>
I guess the church has interpreted it differently as well.<br/>

Yeah. Strange isn&#39;t it? And the sad thing is that I get in lots of discussions like this. This was just one of the stranger examples.<br/>

One mother wrote on this subject (translated from Dutch): &quot;What do you want us to do with your parenting ideas versus the expertise of a physiotherapist?&quot;<br/>

I think it&#39;s not good when people stop thinking for themselves and only do what people who call themselves experts tell them to. But this happens a lot where I live, it&#39;s probably the same in the US.<br/>

<br/>
Yup, this was a big one at the pediatric group I used to use.  They gave me a lecture on the perils of letting my child sit in that position, and they suggested that I should spread the word among the parents I know.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot about it as soon as the lecture was over, but about a year later my sister-in-law brought it up to me (she used the same pediatricians and she had just gotten the lecture, so it was fresh in her mind.)  She followed their advice and never let her kids sit like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Thinking about it now, I can&#39;t remember if my daughter ever sat like that or not.  I do remember being annoyed at the pediatrician because I had so many questions about other things and she was taking up the alloted visit time with her lecture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922823400">My younger cousin used to sit like that, and now her son too (same mother<br/>
and child I spoke about on the potty thread). When she was a toddler, no one<br/>
knew it was bad. She just used to sit like that, and we used to called it<br/>
M-mandi (mandi is the name for the cross-legged sitting in Marathi). It was<br/>
her style of sitting. She grew up just fine, is outrageously brilliant<br/>
academically (came second all over India in the accounting exams!), has a<br/>
fancy high powered job (could buy my entire year&#39;s earning worth on a whim,<br/>
makes decisions that shape the whole organization) and is also biologically<br/>
sound (has a kid and no known illness). Obviously no lasting damage<br/>
intellectually, functionally or physically.<br/>
<br/>
Now her son sits like that and apparently it is a bad thing because it<br/>
indicates weak back muscles. So all the immediate family is obsessed with<br/>
encouraging him to sit correctly. With my penchant for foot in mouth, I<br/>
asked why was it important to make him sit differently if he sits like that<br/>
to be more stable because his back muscles make sitting tiring otherwise? I<br/>
got a whole bunch of dirty looks but no answer other than it is better for<br/>
him to build strength than have a weak back.<br/>
<br/>
Am I stupid or what? The cousin&#39;s back obviously caused her no problems in<br/>
life. She sits cross-legged just fine now. Why in the world is it necessary<br/>
to make a tiny kid&#39;s life more difficult than it needs to be?<br/>

<br/>
&quot;/How to prevent W-sitting./ The most effective (and easiest) way to <br/>
prevent a problem with W-sitting is to prevent it from becoming a habit <br/>
it the first place. Anticipate and catch it before the child even learns <br/>
to W-sit. Children should be placed and taught to assume alternative <br/>
sitting positions. If a child discovers W-sitting anyway, help him to <br/>
move to another sitting position, or say, &quot;Fix your legs.&quot; It&#39;s very <br/>
important to be as consistent as possible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And goes on to tell parents how to teach their kids to sit correctly by <br/>
holding their feet together when they are playing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402046179">To protect children from topics and other people&#39;s sin nature.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One of the other reasons why we decided to homeschool, was to  <br/>
protect our children from influences we deemed harmful. Our particular  <br/>
concern was curriculum materials we disapproved of. In homeschooling,  <br/>
we have indeed been able to protect our children in this way, but we  <br/>
have been able to protect our children in other ways too. Over the  <br/>
years, I�ve met any number of children, who from an increasingly early  <br/>
age, display attitudes of rebellion, deceit and anti-social behaviour.  <br/>
Many parents are unwilling or unable to deal with this. Frankly, I  <br/>
don�t want my children exposed to these sorts of influences. My  <br/>
children may end up having their own struggles in these areas, but if  <br/>
so, let it be because of their own sin nature, and not because they  <br/>
have been influenced by someone else�s sin nature.-=-<br/>

I just keep learning!  Imagine that!<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;W sitting&quot;, my 13 month old tends to sit like that.  Looks to me<br/>
like he&#39;s sitting that way because it is easier to get up on his knees and<br/>
then his feet.  It appears practical and time saving.  He&#39;s the most busy<br/>
and active of my three children and he is always on the go.  I find his<br/>
sitting like that (when the other two never did) to be fascinating and a<br/>
sign of great problem solving!<br/>

<br/>
The oddest quote:  &quot;People are like tofu. We take on or absorb the  <br/>
things we are surrounded by. Read this passage from Galatians and ask  <br/>
yourself what fruit is produced by playing WoW? Gal 5:19-6&quot;  (if you  <br/>
go to the link the bible verses are all quoted and highlighted, and  <br/>
there are red-flag points of all the evils of WoW).<br/>
<br/>
People are like tofu!?  And then use &quot;fruit&quot; in the same sentence?  I  <br/>
think she was hungry when she wrote that.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some quotes after she gets ALL fired up, near the end....<br/>

The Real Spiritual Battle<br/>

We are in a battle daily–not a virtual battle–a real battle!<br/>

<br/>
How do we set the captives free?<br/>
Twenty years ago Christians would be livid about this game, but after  <br/>
years of thisdesensitization WOW slips under our spiritual radar.  <br/>
World of Warcraft is one of the many tools used to captivate and  <br/>
desensitize many concerning the Occult and divination (They appear to  <br/>
be sheep, but they are wolves in sheep’s clothing. Beware, as Christ  <br/>
warned, for they are everywhere.)<br/>

I was at an introduction to homeschooling meeting a few years ago.  The biggest concern by a couple of parents was if all the Christians took their kids out of school, who would be left to &quot;witness to&quot; (convert) the ones left behind.  The children were ages 5 and under!<br/>
