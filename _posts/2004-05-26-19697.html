<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072071961">Yeah, thanks for the clock idea Tuck!<br/>
<br/>
I printed out your post and read it to my daughter and youngest son.  They<br/>
thought it sounded neat so we trucked off to Wal-Mart to pick up some cheap<br/>
clocks.  We came out with 6 of them and spent a really fun couple of hours<br/>
around the kitchen table when we got home!<br/>
<br/>
I made the hours, minutes, seconds clocks you described (I got plain black<br/>
frame clocks and wrote the labels on the face with black marker).  Actually<br/>
all I was allowed to do was write the words .. .my daughter wanted to do all<br/>
the rest.  They are in our computer room (former dining room) - she<br/>
describes them as great art!<br/>
<br/>
Michael made a Nightmare Before Christmas clock (his current fave movie - he<br/>
loves the songs!)  We found some black letter stickers around the house to<br/>
say Halloween and we printed a pic of Jack Skellington off the internet<br/>
which he glued to the face.  He also removed the second hand and left the<br/>
others at midnight ... forever.  No battery for him!<br/>
<br/>
Alyssa took all my leftover hands and started making a &quot;Weasley&quot; clock (from<br/>
Harry Potter - a clock with hands for each family member that points to<br/>
where they are).  She hasn&#39;t quite figured out yet how she&#39;s going to make<br/>
all the hands stay in place (she doesn&#39;t want to glue them since she wants<br/>
to be able to move them around herself).  She&#39;s made lots of attempts with<br/>
paperclips, wire etc.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll figure something out eventually!<br/>
<br/>
So thanks again, we had a great time sparked by your idea!<br/>

<br/>
LOL!  You&#39;re right, definitely no batteries in this clock!  It&#39;s attaching<br/>
the 9 hands (one for each member of the Weasley family) and not having them<br/>
all fall to 6 that&#39;s her challenge.  And gluing them won&#39;t allow her to move<br/>
them around occasionally between &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Hogwarts&quot;, &quot;Ministry of Magic&quot;,<br/>
and &quot;Mortal Danger&quot; etc. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858175134">rubber washers between the hands at the middle where they attach, so they have enough tension to stay when placed? <br/>

tapped into place?<br/>
