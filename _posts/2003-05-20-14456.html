&lt;&lt; AlwaysLearning, the no-whack-a-mole-list, is owned and was started by <br/>
Sandra <br/>
Dodd and moderated by Pam Hartley.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are other moderators.  I don&#39;t remember if they were secret moderators <br/>
(like secret Santas) or not, but Pam Hartley is just the most agressive and <br/>
merriest.    Someone sends spam, she boots them into next week and brags <br/>
about it!!<br/>
<br/>
Twice I&#39;ve TRIED to remove people and couldn&#39;t find them.  Other lists I&#39;ve <br/>
run, I&#39;ve used all the tools and done fine, but this one somehow baffles me.  <br/>
It&#39;s camouflaged.  It&#39;s a stealth-list.<br/>
