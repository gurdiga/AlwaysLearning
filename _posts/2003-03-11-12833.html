<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069052753">Wes Beach posted this on our state list and I just thought you all <br/>
would appreciate it. THIS is the most concise statement I&#39;ve seen for <br/>
why kids should NOT be learning math outside of any real-need context.<br/>
<br/>
********<br/>
I ran across the following a few days ago, in _The Culturanl Nature of<br/>
Human Development_, quoted from another work by A. D Schliemann et al.:<br/>
&quot;The rule-bound solutions traditionally taught in schools seem to<br/>
provide [people] with procedures that are not always understood and<br/>
become useless in generating appropriate solutions to problems out of<br/>
school contexts.  In contrast, the strategies developed by individuals<br/>
as tools to solve problems out of school are characterized by their<br/>
flexibility and by constant monitoring of the meaning of the situation,<br/>
the problem questions, and the quantities involved.&quot;<br/>
