&gt; In my case, third grade was also my downfall.  What is it about third grade<br/>

&gt; with the system; I&#39;m not sure they ever knew the teacher had pulled my desk<br/>
&gt; up against hers, so she could hit my hand with her ruler if I looked out <br/>
&gt; the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julian went into the third grade believing he was smart, especially at math. <br/>
He came out believing he was stupid and sucked at math...mostly because even <br/>
though he excelled at memorizing scripts for plays, etc...he couldn&#39;t get the <br/>
f**&^%ing times tables. And guess whose mother had the EXACT experience. He <br/>
got humiliated in class for it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It took a stupid online IQ test for Julian to understand that he was very <br/>
smart. I guess he needed someone or something who didn&#39;t love him to tell him <br/>
in a way he could believe. Periodically we still get stories we didn&#39;t know <br/>
about school, and I&#39;m so sad. He never told us until recently that they <br/>
dissected a work in the second grade. This is my early ethical vegetarian son <br/>
who wouldn&#39;t eat Skittles.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...anyone here ever read Math: Facing an American Phobia, by Marilyn <br/>
Burns? Incredible book about the way math is taught.<br/>
