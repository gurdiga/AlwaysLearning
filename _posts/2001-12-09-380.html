<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078445963">I&#39;m writing to tell you about an upcoming grassroots conference<br/>
(www.homeschoolingtogether.org/conf) that some local homeschoolers are<br/>
planning.<br/>
<br/>
In past years this same group has organized information nights that have<br/>
been well attended and very lively.  This year we decided to do something<br/>
for ourselves, for the active homeschoolers in the trenches.  We<br/>
brainstormed about what topics get our juices flowing, and this is what we<br/>
came up with:<br/>
<br/>
Whole Education Without Schooling:<br/>
Family, Community, Freedom<br/>
<br/>
Join us for an exploration and celebration of unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, April 13, 2002<br/>
at the First Parish of Watertown,<br/>
35 Church St., Watertown, MA<br/>
<br/>
Keynote speech &quot;On the Importance of Whole Soul Safety or &#39;Shields Up!&#39; will<br/>
be by Eli Gerzon, unschooling teen.  Eli will talk about his experiences in<br/>
and out of school, and some of the things he&#39;s learned from his freedom.<br/>
<br/>
The Panel will consist of active unschoolers, including grown up unschooler<br/>
Sarabeth Matilsky, who are open to answering your questions about how<br/>
unschooling works in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Registrants will choose one of the following participatory workshops:<br/>
<br/>
A. STRUCTURE, FLOW AND BALANCE: CREATING THE LIFE YOU WANT<br/>
Unschooling gives us a unique freedom to create the lives we want to live<br/>
each day, week and year.  This is a challenge to do with the many interests,<br/>
activities and needs of each family member.  We will use writing and art as<br/>
tools to envision how we want our lives to look and feel and to map out the<br/>
ideal week, month, year for ourselves and our families.  Linda Ugelow<br/>
<br/>
B. HOW LEARNING HAPPENS  Doubts about unschooling often stem from<br/>
misconceptions  about how learning happens. Cultural beliefs and our own<br/>
school experiences created these misconceptions, whereas our personal<br/>
experiences completely contradict them. Come explore how learning  really<br/>
happens. You will leave this workshop infused with renewed confidence to<br/>
follow your unschooling heart.  Andy Migner<br/>
<br/>
C. BUILDING COMMUNITY  The unschooling lifestyle provides fertile ground for<br/>
the seeds of community to sprout and flourish.  Using games and discussion,<br/>
we’ll explore techniques to nurture those seeds: leadership, communication,<br/>
rituals, socializing, mentoring.  Share practical experiences and<br/>
challenges, and get ideas you can take home and cultivate. Eileen Ryan &<br/>
Sophia Sayigh<br/>
<br/>
The afternoon is scheduled from 12:30 - 5:30 and the registration fee is<br/>
just $12.  For more info or to print out a registration form, visit<br/>

<br/>
Hope you can join us!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d appreciate any help you can give in getting the word out!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks--<br/>
Sophia Sayigh<br/>
<br/>

the word.<br/>

You might want to post on the unschooling.com message boards and the <br/>
HEM-UnschoolingDiscussion list as well as the conference site&#39;s forum. Sara from NC <br/>
got a roomie that way ( I think). As for a ride---same thing---and I know <br/>
several New Englanders who are coming---which state are you in?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20993085">I&#39;ve posted this everywhere!  I&#39;m in Massachusetts.  I can get <br/>
anywhere in New England, though.  I don&#39;t think my car would make it <br/>
all the way to South Carolina, and I wouldn&#39;t want to drive all that <br/>
way by myself anyway.  Money is really tight right now which is why <br/>
I didn&#39;t think I could go, but if I can cut the costs to the bare <br/>
bones, I really would love to go.<br/>
