<div id="ygrps-yiv-628728236">Christmas wish from Sandra:  I wish more of you would participate at <br/>
www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
For my own preferences, I like the forum (with its library and message <br/>
boards) ten times more than any list, so if any of you here are wondering <br/>
what to do with your excess unschooling-discussion energy, it would be <br/>
beneficial to the world at large for you to contribute ideas and experiences <br/>
at that forum.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I get there myself:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/cgi/discus/board-newmessages.cgi">http://www.unschooling.com/cgi/discus/board-newmessages.cgi</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s straight to the new messages screen; I saved it as a link.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in the forum through the front door, though, &quot;New Messages&quot; is a <br/>
button in a box of options at the bottom of each page of the message board.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just the opposite.  I prefer email lists because I can read it all off <br/>
line and then send off my answers all at once.  I suppose if we had <br/>
cable......but I don&#39;t really want cable.<br/>
