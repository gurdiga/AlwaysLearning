I wonder if I had worded the plea differently <br/>
(&quot;please, I&#39;m vulnerable, so if you can&#39;t give advice without first <br/>
being mean, just give me fair warning in the e-mail&#39;s subjsct so that I <br/>
can delete your message and not get my feelings hurt...&quot;). &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Ummmmm.....I don&#39;t think this would have gone over much better! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many of us *have* met each other IRL. The Live and Learn Unschooling <br/>
Conference is coming up quickly in August in Peabody, MA. Don&#39;t miss it! It would be a <br/>
great place for you and your son to meet a bunch of other unschoolers. I can <br/>
almost guarantee he would meet someone with shared interests!<br/>
<br/>
I also want to mention that AlwaysLearning is really a group for &quot;seasoned&quot; <br/>
unschoolers. Maybe you&#39;d be happier on -101? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-101@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>
