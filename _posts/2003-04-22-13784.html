<div id="ygrps-yiv-24769710">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Some of you have it rough, listening to family members who disagree with your parenting choices. Tim and I have non interested parents. They show up and don&#39;t interact with the kids or with us. They give superficial comments, like politeness is important and then proceed to be rude. It is interesting watching my 2 brothers, my sister and I raise our kids. 9 cousins who all really know eachother, who spend quality time with eachother throughout the year. All of us aunties and uncles can swap kids, mix them up, take one for a sleepover. We have deep relationships with eachother and all support how the others parent.<br/>
<br/>
My mom, a teacher, supported homeschooling when we started, but has since made numerous non supportive comments during intense moments to show she really thinks school will fix that. I no longer take what she has to say seriously, she seems to contradict herself.<br/>
<br/>
Longing for an older person to adopt our family and like what we do also, for different reasons,<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m sure there are alot of out there that feel like you!   I know I do!   Hang in there.   That&#39;s what I keep telling myself.   I keep thinking if I keep getting out there doing stuff that I like and my kids like,  I&#39;m bound to run into others that have similar beliefs!   That or leave the state!!      Just kidding about that,  but sometimes I think about that too.<br/>

One kinda snarky comment I used a couple of times on friends who were <br/>
expressing concern when my kids were little was (Happliy Stated:) &quot;Well, if <br/>
we screw them up, we&#39;ll just put them back in school and the special ed <br/>
teachers can fix them RIGHT up in no time!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The stunned looks on faces as they would process that idea was priceless.  <br/>
Even though they had just been praising school, they knew that special ed <br/>
wasn&#39;t in the business of fixing anybody up, and that sending a &quot;screwed up&quot; <br/>
kid to school was NOT a solution, and that our kids were unlikely to become <br/>
&quot;screwed up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was harsh but it was okay.  <br/>
<br/>
(I have mail from one of those childless friends in my box I haven&#39;t opened <br/>
yet today.)<br/>
<br/>
Then that line became one of the kind of joke advisements given on AOL when <br/>
we would brainstorm what people could say (mostly to amuse and console <br/>
ourselves, when unschooling was more rare than now and more attacked by other <br/>
homeschoolers).<br/>
