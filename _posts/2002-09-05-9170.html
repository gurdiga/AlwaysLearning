 Well get a Nintendo, because people SWEAR if you let them play all they want <br/>
 they will NEVER stop.  Oh!  And TV.  Get cable.  Satellite!  Because people <br/>
 SWEAR if you let them watch all they want they&#39;ll never do anything else.   <br/>

I have my older son who will seriously, for the most part spend his entire <br/>
life in his bedroom watching tv and playing Nintendo.<br/>
I have to PROD, to get him interested in anything else. I let it go for five <br/>
months and decided he needed a little pushing to get him going.<br/>
I don&#39;t control the tv, but I do remind him that, yes, Mom is working tonight <br/>
and if they want to do anything they might want to not wait until an hour <br/>
before I go to work.<br/>
HELP!!!  It is getting  a little bit better, but it pains me to see him in <br/>
that room ALL day long, day after day after day....<br/>
Is it partly the age?<br/>
Nothing in our house is worthy anymore. Not books, not art projects, it&#39;s all <br/>
boring.<br/>
The almost teen thing might be part of it, the fact that I was ultra anti-tv <br/>
for a long time is probably part of it. So I grit my teeth and try to shut up.<br/>
But it&#39;s hard. He&#39;s out of shape and very hard to interest in anything <br/>
outside his bedroom.<br/>
