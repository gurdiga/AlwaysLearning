<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098882109">I’m forwarding this request.  I know some people have fun with surveys. :-)<br/>
If you’re the owner of another unschooling forum and want to send it on, that’s fine.<br/>
The questions are about multiculturalism and diversity.  There are opportunities for long answers and follow-up, for those who are interested and in the mood. :-)<br/>

Hello!<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Kristan Morrison and I have been conducting research on unschooling in order to help more people understand what goes on in unschooling families. You were so kind as to forward a survey of mine a few years back. <br/>
 <br/>
My new research is looking at the intersections between unschooling and multicultural education.  Would you again be willing to share my survey with your unschooling friends and contacts?  If so, here is the link:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://radford.qualtrics.com//SE/?SID=SV_2lDQmBRekXRD5Q1">http://radford.qualtrics.com//SE/?SID=SV_2lDQmBRekXRD5Q1</a><br/>
 <br/>
Thank you so much!<br/>
 <br/>
Best,<br/>
