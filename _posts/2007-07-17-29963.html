<br/>
~I have lived in one house that had some old wavy glass window<br/>
panes... just now growing curious about the history of sheet glass, I<br/>
found some info that indicates window panes, even the &#39;old&#39; wavy glass<br/>
variety are really quite new, comparative to glass/glasswork in general.<br/>

~When it comes to &quot;R&quot; rated, savoury (or should that be unsavoury)<br/>
language, the f word is most often the one heard in our house, though<br/>
K, my 14yr old daughter, recently resolved to substitute Puck! She&#39;s<br/>
chosen this based on the knowledge that the f word, its connotations<br/>
in some forms of usage is highly offensive to many people. It remains<br/>
to be seen whether or not she&#39;ll catch herself every time a strong<br/>
feeling that might call for strong words is evoked in her. <br/>
<br/>
At times during my life I have sworn like a trooper, or sailor,<br/>
perhaps... and othertimes sworn off swearing in favour of exclamations<br/>
like Good Grief! which, lets face it, aren&#39;t half as satifying when<br/>
one has, for example, jammed one&#39;s finger in a cabinet, or cupboard<br/>
door.  <br/>
<br/>
I recall a time when K was small and just beginning to speak short<br/>
sentences/string of words, when on smashing my shin into the hard base<br/>
of a bed as I was making it, I let rip a stream of highly unsavoury<br/>
expletives. I was mortified when my tiny angel girl (gushy, I know,<br/>
but that&#39;s about what went on inside me) who was right there,<br/>
immediately repeated what I&#39;d said in her small, sweet child voice. I<br/>
swore off of swearing for a while then. Hearing those words from her<br/>
mouth shocked me and made me question whether, or why, it was less<br/>
shocking for me to speak so. <br/>
<br/>
K seldom used &quot;bad&quot; words inappropriately as she grew - I do think<br/>
there are times when a shit! or something similar is quite warranted<br/>
in most every persons mind. There have been times, though, when other<br/>
children were visiting our home and K&#39;s use of the f word, within<br/>
earshot of me, was followed by a loaded silence into which it was<br/>
expected by the other children, I think, that I would interject some<br/>
admonishment. Sometimes I would say something like &quot;that&#39;s a strong<br/>
word... what&#39;s up?&quot; Often I would break the tension by saying<br/>
eff,effitty,eff,eff! (just like that, or the actual word(s), depending<br/>
on what I knew of the homes the children present lived in), also in a<br/>
stream, but really lightly, making everyone laugh. Occasionally, if I<br/>
could get away with it, I might pretend I hadn&#39;t heard if I could tell<br/>
that nothing needing my attention had prompted the use of the word. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~I&#39;ve found the threads about children leaving home, or being forced<br/>
out really interesting, and thought provoking. I know that when I was<br/>
not much older than my daughter I began to long for freedom from my<br/>
parents (and school). Not because my parents were/are awful, but<br/>
because I wanted to live as my own person. Hard for me to explain what<br/>
that meant to me then. From my current vantage point, the 42yrs old<br/>
one, and still feeling like I&#39;m struggling a bit sometimes to be seen<br/>
as a whole separate person from my parents, from my family of origin -<br/>
even while in an amicable relationship with my parents - I&#39;m still not<br/>
sure I can quantify that desire, explain what is/was meaningful to me<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
Because of my own experiences, I&#39;d imagined that K might have a<br/>
similar dream or feelings, and have asked her about what that might<br/>
be. (I confess, too, to beginning to plan, to envision the life I<br/>
would lead happily without her in it so much. I&#39;m thinking now, and<br/>
not unhappily, that that was pre-emptive folly of some kind.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, K was/is baffled by the idea that she might want to leave<br/>
home, can&#39;t imagine that she will want to, ever. So, I had something<br/>
of an epiphany while thinking on recent discussions here, though doh!<br/>
moment probably describes it better. Why would she want to leave an<br/>
environment where she is and always has been honoured and respected as<br/>
a whole, separate, sentient person. She has always had the power to<br/>
*be*. She has no need to stretch, to rebel, to fight for recognition<br/>
of her personhood, to seek to establish space to express that in. She<br/>
already has, in ways that are meaningful to her, an embiggened life.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she will leave one day, but if she doesn&#39;t, ever, as she says<br/>
now, or chooses to stay with me for years and years yet, we will, as<br/>
others have said, work that out as we go along, with the openess and<br/>
generosity that characterises our relationship. <br/>
