<div id="ygrps-yiv-968972976">There&#39;s this great folksinger named Hugh Blumenfeld who has a great song for <br/>
the Unschooling album: <br/>
<br/>
What If You Do Nothing<br/>
(words by Andrea Gaines, music by Hugh Blumenfeld)<br/>
<br/>
What if you do nothing with your life<br/>
Run no races, strive no strife<br/>
Just live on a farm have one dear wife<br/>
One good dog and that is that<br/>
<br/>
What if you launch into space on a rocket ship<br/>
And fall back to earth on a stardust ride<br/>
All you get is a tickertape parade<br/>
Better to spend the day in the shade<br/>
<br/>
What if you rise up to fame on the silver screen<br/>
And find yourself starring in all the girls&#39; dreams<br/>
All you get is a little bronze man<br/>
Better to make just one loyal fan<br/>
<br/>
Running the plow all day<br/>
the horses paw the hay<br/>
Apples up your sleeve<br/>
who says that you&#39;ve got to leave<br/>
<br/>
What if you do nothing with your life<br/>
Run no races, strive no strife<br/>
Just live on a farm have one dear wife<br/>
One good dog and that is that<br/>
One good dog and that is that<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
