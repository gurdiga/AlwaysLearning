<br/>
I shall try that.  I did find a way to get Java on my computer, but Microsoft <br/>
was no help whatsoever.  (doh!)<br/>
<br/>
In the way back when I used Netscape, but then IE got better and Netscape got <br/>
consumed or something...so I guess I&#39;ll take a look at Mozilla.  Although <br/>
with the Google toolbar you do get to avoid pop-ups.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264484893">There is an alternative if you want to use Internet Explorer but <br/>
don&#39;t want to or cannot use IE&#39;s version of Java.  You can download <br/>
a different and better version of Java from Sun.  Below is some <br/>
rather chatty but helpful information on the benefits (for all of <br/>
us) of Sun&#39;s version of Java and how to install it, from &quot;The <br/>
Internet Tourbus,&quot; an e-newsletter.  (If you like their information, <br/>
visit www.tourbus.com for past archives and/or to subscribe.)<br/>
<br/>
I would have posted a link to these articles if I could, but they <br/>
haven&#39;t archived the 2004 issues yet.  Sorry for their length, but I <br/>
found this information very helpful and hope you will, too.<br/>

<br/>
Update Your Java<br/>
<br/>
Java, as you already know, is a large island in the Malay archipelago<br/>
just south of Borneo.  :P<br/>
<br/>
Actually, in the context we&#39;re talking about today, Java is a<br/>
platform-independent, object-oriented, compiled programming language<br/>
created by Sun Microsystems.  Programmers write Java programs--called<br/>
&quot;applets&quot;--that automatically download from the web and run on your<br/>
computer.  In fact, if the Java applets are written well, they&#39;ll run<br/>
on almost EVERY computer: PCs, Macs, *nix boxes, cell phones,<br/>
refrigerators... chances are, your computer came with the ability to<br/>
load and run Java applets straight out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
What do these Java applets look like?  Well, for example, there&#39;s a<br/>
free Java applet on the web called &quot;AirportMonitor&quot; that lets you<br/>
track all inbound and outbound flights at LAX (and a few other<br/>
airports).  You can find the LAX AirportMonitor Java applet at<br/>
<br/>
     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www4.passur.com/lax.html">http://www4.passur.com/lax.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Like most Java applets, just visit the site and the applet <br/>
automatically loads in your web browser.  And be patient: The <br/>
AirportMonitor applet might take just short of forever to load.  <br/>
Your patience will be rewarded, though.<br/>
<br/>
You can find a list of other AiportMonitor-enabled sites at<br/>
<br/>
     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.passur.com/sites.htm">http://www.passur.com/sites.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you want to find out where my beloved hometown of Irvine,<br/>
California, is actually located, hop on over to<br/>
<br/>
     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www4.passur.com/sna.html">http://www4.passur.com/sna.html</a><br/>
<br/>
and play around with the map range.  Irvine is in the middle of the <br/>
map, just to the right of the John Wayne airport (SNA).<br/>
<br/>
Now, remember how I said that Java applets automatically download <br/>
from the web and run on your computer?  Think about that for a <br/>
minute. Considering the number of viruses and Trojan horses out <br/>
there, do we *REALLY* want downloaded Java programs auto-executing <br/>
on our computers?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it depends.<br/>
<br/>
Java applets run in something called a &quot;sandbox&quot; (actually it&#39;s <br/>
called the &quot;Java RunTime Environment&quot;).  The sandbox is just a <br/>
special zone on your computer fenced off from your operating system <br/>
and other applications.  In theory, Java applets can&#39;t get outside <br/>
of the sandbox and damage your computer.  In theory.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that there are two major &quot;flavors&quot; of Java:<br/>
<br/>
     1. Microsoft&#39;s (which you already have if you own a PC) and<br/>
     2. Sun&#39;s (which you don&#39;t have).<br/>
<br/>
In Microsoft&#39;s version of Java, the sandbox is better known <br/>
as &quot;Windows.&quot;  Okay, that&#39;s an exaggeration.  But, it is not an <br/>
exaggeration to say that in Microsoft&#39;s version of Java there are <br/>
some pretty significant security holes in the wall between the <br/>
sandbox and the OS.  And that&#39;s a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
Even worse, Microsoft&#39;s Java Virtual Machine (the software on PCs <br/>
that actually runs Java applets) is<br/>
<br/>
     - Buggy,<br/>
     - Proprietary, and<br/>
     - Not long for this world.<br/>
<br/>
By way of comparison, Sun&#39;s version of Java is<br/>
<br/>
     - Newer,<br/>
     - Safer (because it has a MUCH better sandbox), and<br/>
     - Official (because, after all, Sun invented Java.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and what did I mean when I said that Microsoft&#39;s Java Virtual <br/>
Machine is not long for this world?  Well, Microsoft will stop <br/>
supporting their JVM version on September 30th, 2004.  And, because <br/>
of Microsoft&#39;s recent court settlement with Sun, there will be no <br/>
replacement.  Microsoft recommends that, after 9/30, you lock down <br/>
Microsoft Internet Explorer security zones so that the MSJVM works <br/>
only with trusted sites.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft has even created a page that talks about transitioning <br/>
from the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine [you can find the page at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/%5d">http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/%5d</a> but a MUCH better solution <br/>
for folks like you and me is to hop on over to<br/>
<br/>
     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/index.jsp</a><br/>
<br/>
and get Sun&#39;s official Java software.  The process couldn&#39;t be <br/>
simpler: Just click on the &quot;Get It Now&quot; button and Sun automatically <br/>
downloads and installs the official Java software your computer.  <br/>
And Sun&#39;s free Java software is available for the PC, Mac, Linux, and<br/>
(obviously) Sun Solaris.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll [probably] be asked to reboot once the new Java software is <br/>
installed.  Once you reboot, though, you&#39;ll have the latest, <br/>
greatest version of Java.  And, if you are a PC user, you won&#39;t have <br/>
to worry about what&#39;s going to happen when Microsoft&#39;s JVM  <br/>
fficially dies in September.<br/>
<br/>
Neat, huh?  And once you&#39;ve updated your Java, you can find a BUNCH <br/>
of free Java applets to play with at<br/>

More Java<br/>
<br/>
I apologize!<br/>
<br/>
In my last post [which was actually a couple of weeks ago] I told <br/>
you how to download and install Sun&#39;s official version of Java but <br/>
forgot to tell you what you should do with your Microsoft Java <br/>
Virtual Machine AFTER the installation.  Whoops!<br/>
<br/>
This may sound kind of strange, but my gut feeling is that you <br/>
should *NOT* uninstall the MSJVM.  Rather, you should abandon it in <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why.  Uninstalling Windows components, even ones that are <br/>
going to die in September, is a fool&#39;s errand if only because you <br/>
have no idea if the uninstall is going work.  The worst case <br/>
scenario is that you could unintentionally break Windows in the <br/>
process.  And that&#39;s a risk I&#39;m just not willing to take.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, to make sure your Microsoft Java Virtual Machine is sent <br/>
off to its own private Siberia, download and install the Sun version <br/>
of Java and then<br/>
<br/>
     1. In Internet Explorer, go to Tools &gt; Internet Options.<br/>
     2. Click on the Advanced tab.<br/>
     3. Scroll down to the Java settings and make sure there is a<br/>
        checkmark next to Use Java 2 v1.42_03 for &lt;applet&gt;<br/>
     4. Scroll down Microsoft VM and uncheck everything.<br/>
     5. Click on OK.<br/>
<br/>
After that,<br/>
<br/>
     1. Open your PC&#39;s control panel.  (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control<br/>
        Panel; Start &gt; Control Panel in XP)<br/>
            1a. If you have XP and your Control Panel is a purple<br/>
                page asking you to Pick a Category, click on Switch<br/>
                to Classic View in the upper left corner of the page.<br/>
     2. Double-click on the Java Control Panel icon. (If you have two<br/>
        Java Control Panel icons, click on purple and red one not the<br/>
        black, white, and red one that looks like a ouija board<br/>
        pointer).<br/>
     3. It&#39;ll take a while for the control panel to open, but when it<br/>
        does click on the browser tab.<br/>
     4. Make sure there is a checkmark next to all of the browsers<br/>
        that you use.<br/>
     5. Click on apply and then close the control panel.<br/>
<br/>
Then, restart your computer.  That&#39;s it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>

(Now another word from Wendy.)<br/>
<br/>
I have heard recently from someone else who also recently got an XP <br/>
computer or upgraded to XP and could not use Java (and therefore <br/>
could not use much of Math Cats).  Maybe since Microsoft is ending <br/>
its support for Java soon, they are not including it in the latest <br/>
version of XP.  It is really ridiculous.  Much of the Web depends on <br/>
Java.  So I hope you&#39;ll all help spread the word that it makes sense <br/>
to turn to Sun for reliable Java.<br/>
