When I was nursing, and my other children were little (always wanting <br/>
a drink as soon as I sat down with the baby) I used syrup <br/>
bottles filled with juice, water, or whatever, so they could get <br/>
their own drink. A stack of near by paper cups was helpful too. Now <br/>
you can just buy a small bottle w/ one of those squirter tops. My <br/>
children drank more water that way because it was *cool* to get their <br/>
own drink that was cold.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453710616">I am new to the &quot;let them eat cake&quot; mentality so let me know if I am way off here.<br/>
This is what I have done with my girls.<br/>
<br/>
I told my girls what we eat plays a major role in our health.  It affects how we feel today, how well our bodies fight off germs and how our bodies protect themselves from diseases like cancer and heart disease.  I then asked the girls what they thought and whether they felt eating healthy food was important.  Of course they said yes.  Then I told them that their bodies can only fill up on so much food every day before being too full, so if they fill up on lots of sweets, their bodies would not have any room for healthy food.  Everyone likes sweets and it is ok to eat sweets but they need to be eaten in moderation.  I asked them how much room their bodies would have for dessert if they ate enough nutritious food to be healthy.  They gave some thought to that and decided on a balance.  <br/>
<br/>
On days they seem to be going overboard with sweets, I don&#39;t say anything to them at the time I see them eating the desserts.  Later on that day I might say something like &quot;how are you doing getting your healthy food today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Would that work for you Nancy?<br/>
<br/>
I also think a discussion about wasting food and wasting your time is in order.<br/>
<br/>
In the situation you mentioned, I might have said &quot;why don&#39;t you have the pancakes now since I made them for you and you can have the jelly beans a little later.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
We had kids here today--several, and a 23 yr old.  They did get Dr Peppers, <br/>
three of them, at one point.  Kirby was making a birthday cake for someone <br/>
not here.  He wanted to give away the beaters after making homemade chocolate <br/>
frosting.  The two people he offered them to first turned them down politely. <br/>
 One said he couldn&#39;t eat sweets anymore--last time he had sweets he didn&#39;t <br/>
feel good.<br/>
<br/>
They all did eat meatballs in sauce (which Kirby had made up) and noodles.  <br/>
Marty later made a turkey sandwich.  I saw several glasses of milk go by.  <br/>
Nobody added chocolate, but two Hershey&#39;s syrup bottles were in view.  Nobody <br/>
had cookies or candy (in view).  Nobody touched the corn chips.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby had forgotten a knife to cut the cake, when he left for the <br/>
meeting/party/anime thing.  I drove it up there, and saw fifteen teenaged <br/>
boys eating pizza, and eating meatballs.  Not the height of health food, but <br/>
not sweets either.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not explaining this well tonight.  I&#39;m tired.  Sorry.<br/>

I generally told her that broccoli was good for us and I liked it.  One day I told her that broccoli was one of the vegetables that was found to help prevent cancer.  Ever since then, she makes a point of eating some broccoli.  She asks for hers raw because she doesn&#39;t like it cooked.  Jelly beans have no redeeming nutritional value.  They help promote tooth decay.  Jelly beans are not good food although quite tasty.  We don&#39;t limit jelly beans but we discuss the benefits of more nutritious foods over jelly beans.<br/>

I have never rewarded the kids with sweets and have talked about how bad schools are in using sweets as a reward.  We don&#39;t say if you eat you &quot;fill in the blank&quot; you can have dessert.  That would make it a reward.  <br/>

Have your kids ever done what Nancy&#39;s kids are doing and eaten candy for breakfast, etc.  If so, how long does it generally take for them to begin balancing themselves out?<br/>

I have to regulate my own sweets intake in order to try to get enough healthy food and keep my weight down.  There is no question that people like sweet food.  Do you make a conscious effort of any kind with regard to eating.  I remember you had a food chart up in your house.  Would you say it would be better to just talk about good nutrition as explained on the food chart and then not offer any suggestions about eating less sweets?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466150805">Just have GOOD cake (lots of extra eggs, add extra<br/>
powdered milk...unless there are allergies)! <br/>
<br/>
Oatmeal cookies are as &quot;good for you&quot; as a bowl of<br/>
oatmeal, so why not?  <br/>
<br/>
If sodas and packages snacks are a problem, just don&#39;t<br/>
buy them!  <br/>
<br/>
Even with bigger kids, it is usually, the<br/>
just-before-everything-is-ready time that is a<br/>
problem.  The good smells say &quot;time to eat&quot; and they<br/>
don&#39;t want to wait. Just don&#39;t have anything else<br/>
available and whenever they come in the kitchen, put<br/>
something in their hands to do to help get good food<br/>
ready. Those little nibbles, then, won&#39;t hurt....that<br/>
is what you are gonna eat anyway. <br/>

<br/>
For people with blood clotting problems, broccoli is a very bad thing.  I <br/>
have a close friend who had a blood clot in her leg a year ago, and is not <br/>
ever to eat broccoli or spinach anymore.  Her dad died of a blood clot when <br/>
he was about the age she is now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Have your kids ever done what Nancy&#39;s kids are doing and eaten candy for <br/>
breakfast, etc.  If so, how long does it generally take for them to begin <br/>
balancing themselves out?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because I never limited them, they don&#39;t loves sweets more than they love <br/>
other foods.<br/>
<br/>
One of our notable moments was at a restaurant out of state with several <br/>
other adult friends when Kirby and Marty were two and five.  This was <br/>
pre-homeschooling.  It&#39;s probably something that made homeschooling easy for <br/>
me, or something in our understandings that made the whole package deal make <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
I knew it would be a while before food came.  All these childless folk would <br/>
be grumpy if my kids were distracting, because they hadn&#39;t seen us for a <br/>
couple of years.  And I wanted them to see my kids at their best.  So rather <br/>
than leave waiting, hungry, in a room full of food, I ordered apple pie for <br/>
them right away.<br/>
<br/>
One of the other childless folks said that meant they woudn&#39;t eat any dinner. <br/>
 I said &quot;No, they will.  They don&#39;t know what order food is &#39;supposed&#39; to be <br/>
eaten in because we don&#39;t do desserts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So they ate pie happily, and when food came they ate chicken and vegetables <br/>
and bread happily.<br/>
<br/>
The other folks were surprised.  I wasn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Because we never told them which movies or music or books or ideas were &quot;good <br/>
for them&quot; and which were &quot;of no value,&quot; they chose things which interested <br/>
them, and which caused them to think and know more.  People LIKE to know <br/>
more, unless others are making a big controlling deal about it, unless <br/>
they&#39;re saving some activities for dessert, not to be had, or to be commented <br/>
on (you watched cartoons two hours today--how did you do on educational <br/>
activities?).<br/>
<br/>
Given a level, non-emotional, non-shame-based and non-reward-based choice of <br/>
all things, people will choose good things more than bad, and will learn to <br/>
be discerning and make good choices on their own, for real reasons.  They <br/>
will choose a good friend over an irritating one.  They will choose something <br/>
satisfying to eat.  They will choose something new and thought-provoking to <br/>
discuss or watch or read.<br/>
<br/>
If they never actually have those choices, they can never actually make those <br/>
choices.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have to regulate my own sweets intake in order to try to get enough <br/>
healthy food and keep my weight down.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Were they limited when you were younger?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  There is no question that people like sweet food. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like dark chocolate.  I like GS Thin Mint cookies. &lt;g&gt;  Annually, I get <br/>
some.  If I hadn&#39;t been totally forbidden chocolate for a few years in my <br/>
youth, and had it measured out stingily thereafter, I wouldn&#39;t worship it.  <br/>
But over the years I came to trust that if I didn&#39;t eat it all it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
snatched away by others in my family.  There&#39;s no desperation for food in my <br/>
family now as there was when I was little.  It makes a difference.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you make a conscious effort of any kind with regard to eating.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We make sure there is always milk and bread, often a choice between wheat <br/>
bread or Roman Meal, and homemade bread the kids like.  There&#39;s always <br/>
cheese, lunch meat, tuna, fruit, lettuce, and juice easily available.  There <br/>
are freezer foods the teenagers like--frozen pizzas, chimichangas.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I remember you had a food chart up in your house.  Would you say it would <br/>
be better to just talk about good nutrition as explained on the food chart <br/>
and then not offer any suggestions about eating less sweets?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The food pyramid was in itself a diagram recommending eating more of other <br/>
foods than sweets.  I don&#39;t need to talk to them about eating fewer sweets <br/>
because they&#39;ve never had sweets made glorious.  They&#39;re just there.  <br/>
<br/>
At the moment, there&#39;s ice cream in the freezer, biscochitos in the cookie <br/>
jar (they&#39;ve been there since early January, one goes every day or two), <br/>
chocolate syrup which they sometimes add to milk (but they like milk and <br/>
don&#39;t have to be bribed or augmented to drink it), sweetened breakfast <br/>
cereals, and red vines (those are Kirby&#39;s but he&#39;s willing to share.  There <br/>
are jelly beans in two places, but hardly anyone here likes them.  They&#39;re <br/>
both bags from last year.  Holly had a box of Fruit Roll Ups two days ago.  <br/>
She finished the last one last night.  She offered them to other kids.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s part of a chocolate cake.  When Kirby made one to take away <br/>
yesterday, I made one with funky pans to keep here.  He made double frosting <br/>
when he made homemade frosting.  I showed him making different sized layers <br/>
with different pans and a rounded mixing bowl, and making a dome-shaped cake. <br/>
 That way he did the safe two-9&quot;-layers and I showed him the experimental <br/>
goofy option.  With my husband and several teenagers in the house, there&#39;s <br/>
still some of that cake there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not arguing, I&#39;m questioning because I may need to make some changes. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings if you were arguing.  I have my kids to look at <br/>
to see that it didn&#39;t mess them up to give them freedom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Why can&#39;t healthy food have a priority just like learning. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s your priority, then it IS your priority.   Choice and understanding <br/>
are mine.<br/>
<br/>
My priority about learning is that given two choices of things (physical, <br/>
aural, positional--visits, etc) I can provide for my kids, other things being <br/>
equal I will go with what presents them new information or ideas or exposure.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If it does, how should that be communicated without cause cravings? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you can label something that children like and want as &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
and them as bad for wanting it, and keep it from being &quot;forbidden fruit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Things treated casually are casual things.   Lots of rule can make for lots <br/>
of rule-breaking, and ultimately lots of satisfaction in obtaining the thing, <br/>
either with being sneaky or being away from the controlling house, or <br/>
thinking &quot;When I grow up, I can have all the candy I want.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; So rather <br/>
than leave waiting, hungry, in a room full of food, I ordered apple pie for <br/>
them right away.<br/>
<br/>
One of the other childless folks said that meant they woudn&#39;t eat any dinner. <br/>
 I said &quot;No, they will.  They don&#39;t know what order food is &#39;supposed&#39; to be <br/>
eaten in because we don&#39;t do desserts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So they ate pie happily, and when food came they ate chicken and vegetables <br/>
and bread happily. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found this to be true. Even for my sweets-craving son. He loves <br/>
sweet things, never seems to get sick in any way - except for chocolate, so <br/>
he watches himself on that. <br/>
<br/>
When we have cookies or whatever available, I just put them on the plate with <br/>
everything else. They usually get eaten first, but not to the exclusion of <br/>
anything else.<br/>

Yes, carrots could be dessert and cookies could be lunch but for my post I was using dessert to mean sweet food.  I looked it up in the dictionary when Sandra said dessert literally meant something earned.  I do know the saying &quot;get your just desserts&quot; but we don&#39;t use it that way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; In one of your other posts you mentioned you don&#39;t do desserts.  We do <br/>
desserts.  I love to bake and we have elaborate desserts.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like to bake, but we don&#39;t serve a sweet course at the end of a meal.<br/>
<br/>
Baking&#39;s for baking--birthdays, or just for fun, or a party, or because <br/>
someone&#39;s coming over to play cards.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s parents still do the &quot;get skinny and we&#39;ll love you&quot; stuff.  I <br/>
hate that.  His mom serves small portions, even at Thanksgiving.  She decides <br/>
in advance what will be leftover, and puts it in the freezer before the meal.<br/>
<br/>
Her priority is &quot;skinny.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen photos of my husband in childhood.  From birth, he was pudgy.  He <br/>
always needed more food than she was giving him, and so he went elsewhere for <br/>
food, and as often as possible, because from the minute she saw his pudgy <br/>
newborn face she said she would love him if he was skinnier.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she would.  <br/>
<br/>
So I came from lack of food from lack of money and the measuring (dividing by <br/>
six) of everything with no slack for size, age, desire, etc.  I was told <br/>
&quot;you&#39;re not hungry, you&#39;ve never been hungry a day in your life.&quot;  So I <br/>
decided when I was grown I would eat when I was hungry and NOT eat if I <br/>
wasn&#39;t hungry.   And so that&#39;s what I do.  <br/>
<br/>
And Keith finally got, after years, to the point that he will just eat some <br/>
and not all when food is there.  <br/>
<br/>
So we decided not to put either of those weird food things on our kids.  They <br/>
eat when they&#39;re hungry, and they haven&#39;t developed the desire to eat all of <br/>
anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I realize we&#39;re lucky in that we can afford to replace the bagels and cream <br/>
cheese if they&#39;re gone, or buy more milk.  And I appreciate it.  <br/>
<br/>
Occasionally a visiting kid goes food-crazy, but we let him do it.  It&#39;s <br/>
interesting to see, and for our kids to see, that someone who&#39;s restricted or <br/>
limited gets a big desire and need.  (One boy did half a carton of ice cream <br/>
one day, checking again to see if it was REALLY okay for him to have more.  <br/>
It was.)   They just see it and say &quot;huh.  weird.&quot; but they&#39;ll remember it <br/>
when they&#39;re parents, I think.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you think sweets should only be after, or a small percentage, or a reward, <br/>
you&#39;re using it that way in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
I really think words have power.  I think when men stopped calling 60 year <br/>
old women &quot;girls&quot; in the 1970&#39;s (or later, for some of them, and never for <br/>
some) it changed their thinking about women (since before that they were NOT <br/>
thinking about women, just girls).   It changes people&#39;s beliefs and <br/>
practices when their homeschooling moves from ideas about &quot;teaching&quot; to  just <br/>
ideas about &quot;learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think if you were to stop using the word &quot;dessert&quot; it would eventually <br/>
change your thinking.  It would no longer seem wrong, evil, or sneaky to <br/>
&quot;have dessert&quot; without having had a salad and a vegetable and a protein <br/>
course.  If vegetables can be eaten all by themselves for fun, that changes <br/>
everything too.<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes spinach.  We&#39;ll make spinach for a snack.  (There&#39;s a bag of <br/>
fresh spinach in the fridge, and this reminds me we really need to use it <br/>
today.)  She likes artichokes, and corn on the cob, and baked potatoes--for <br/>
snacks, for fun.  If they had to be served with salad, protein course, and <br/>
before sweets, they would no longer be fun, they would be business.  And <br/>
perhaps a dreaded business.<br/>

When try to eat when I&#39;m hungry and not eat when I&#39;m not, it feels like I am putting controls on myself and then I go overboard.  When ever I need to lose a few pounds I have to do it by stuffing myself with vegetables.  I can&#39;t tell myself to eat less.  My kids are very good about only eating when they are hungry and only until they are satisfied.  <br/>

also love to bake and make elaborate sweet treats. <br/>
Hmmm, how can I do both?  We don&#39;t have desserts after<br/>
dinner.  Sometimes we have them before dinner, or<br/>

we are now, and getting comfortable with giving the<br/>

already too much for my family to be comfortable not<br/>
telling me about.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;d be interested in Nancy&#39;s input into why she<br/>
&gt;thinks her kids are choosing so many sweets in<br/>
&gt;comparison to yours.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just FYI, it&#39;s Nanci, not Nancy.  Perhaps there is<br/>
something to the notion that refined sugars are more<br/>
addictive and affecting to some people or some<br/>
ethnicities than others.  I don&#39;t think psychology is<br/>
ALL of it.  I have seen too many dramatic effects of<br/>
the chemistry of food in different people.<br/>
<br/>
But if that IS the case, it is even more important let<br/>
my sons learn how to self regulate their diets for<br/>
their own health.  We decided it was important to<br/>
loosen up the strictures we had adopted for safety&#39;s<br/>
sake, now that Thomas is old enough to know and<br/>
recognize most of his allergens.  I still keep a close<br/>
eye on what he eats and have to veto certain things,<br/>
but try to let him make his own choices when the<br/>
allergen or sensativity is not a dangerous one.  If he<br/>
may get somewhat ill or have more minor reactions<br/>
(like upset stomache, headache, fatigue, emotional<br/>
uncontrollability, rashes, etc) due to intolerances, I<br/>
let him go ahead and eat it if he really wants to and<br/>
then help him through the aftermath, and talk about<br/>
why that is happening and why I recommended against<br/>
his eating that thing in the first place.  He<br/>
generally trusts me and also will often take one bite<br/>
and then not eat any more of something that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;taste right&quot; to him.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps they are going wile right now because we<br/>
have been strict in the past.  We had to keep a lot of<br/>
food away from him when he was little, while we were<br/>
still discovering his allergies and having emergency<br/>
trips to the hospital.  His little brother,<br/>
unfortunatly, got the fallout of all the food<br/>
stricture, even though he has very few and mild<br/>
sensativities.  Alex (my younger) is also much more<br/>
relaxed about what he eats, and doesn&#39;t eat all the<br/>
sweets his brother does.  Today they ate pretzels all<br/>
morning and then Alex had some eggs and Thomas had a<br/>
jelly sandwich (lots of carbos).  Last night at<br/>
dinner, we have stuffed, roasted turkey, candied yams<br/>
and homemade biscuits.  I had a big turkey to cook<br/>
that we got free, so I did the whole turkey thing. <br/>
Thomas ate a lot of turkey and a biscuit for dinner. <br/>
Things seem to be improving a  bit but I anticipate<br/>
this will be a bit like the deschooling struggle is<br/>
for others.  Is this Demenuing?<br/>

One thing we used to do is take a couple of ice cube trays and fill the<br/>
compartments with different little things: olives, cheese cubes, mini rice<br/>
cakes, mini muffins, pretzels, raisins, pickles, little bits of fruits and<br/>
vegies. Then the kids could grab stuff from there by themselves. They also<br/>
really liked frozen raw vegies. And they still love frozen grapes.<br/>
<br/>
Variety and presentation are important to my kids, so I cut vegies and<br/>
fruits in different ways, like carrots in sticks sometimes, in coins other<br/>
times, on the diagonal sometimes. It sounds weird, but it works for us and<br/>
I like doing it. And I tend to get in a food shopping rut, so I have to<br/>
remember to ask them when they want and to buy things we haven&#39;t eaten in a<br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
I also used really teeny cups, bowls, and plates when they were little.<br/>
That really cut down on wasting food.<br/>

When my kids were little I did restrict their sweets--I never thought about<br/>
it, just did it. So my kids weren&#39;t able to learn to choose for themselves<br/>
from the beginning, but I definitely see them choosing fewer sweets as they<br/>
grow older.<br/>

&lt;&lt; One thing we used to do is take a couple of ice cube trays and fill the<br/>
compartments with different little things: olives, cheese cubes, mini rice<br/>
cakes, mini muffins, pretzels, raisins, pickles, little bits of fruits and<br/>
vegies. Then the kids could grab stuff from there by themselves. They also<br/>
really liked frozen raw vegies. And they still love frozen grapes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the summer, still, with our youngest ten years old, we freeze juice in ice <br/>
cube trays and put one Discovery Toys &quot;Boom-a-ring&quot; in each one for a handle. <br/>
 It&#39;s a summer comfort thing for Holly.  Marty and Kirby still grab one once <br/>
in a while.  And neighbor and visiting little kids are VERY excited at the <br/>
idea that they can have two or three.  And it&#39;s just orange juice or <br/>
cranberry juice.  They can have the whole tray if they want!  And the handles <br/>
go in the dishwasher.<br/>
