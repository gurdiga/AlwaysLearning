<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872293291">That makes me laugh Nic... As I sit typing on my computer I hear the Lego<br/>
Racers tune coming from Zak&#39;s.  He&#39;s so happy that we&#39;ve decided to let him<br/>
play as much as he wants....Unfortunately or fortunately he knows about Lego<br/>
Racers II and that&#39;s why he&#39;s working on conquering this one so that he can<br/>
have the next one.... Yes I have tried it and I cannot master it.... I<br/>
always seem to end up with the &#39;WRONG WAY&#39; sign showing up when I play<br/>
it..... I just went and played a game with him and even with him using the<br/>
joystick (which we&#39;ve only just brought) he still beat me easily....<br/>

I usually do not respond but I had to let you know that we share a very<br/>
common experience. My son is also 6 and was pretty much just like your son<br/>
before and after he received Lego Racer. He would wake up at 4:00am with<br/>
that game on his mind and play for hours on end. It took him about 2 months<br/>
to completely master it and these days he has moved on and rarely do I hear<br/>
that little lego racer tune coming from the computer room. By the way, have<br/>
you ever tried to play it yourself? I have a very difficult time just<br/>
staying on the track. My opinion is do not interfere because he is being<br/>
challenged, that is what makes it so fun. Just let him get it out of his<br/>
system and then he will move on like my son has. After all once you win<br/>
first place every time it becomes a little boring. Oh-yeah, look out there<br/>
is also a Lego Racer ll.<br/>
