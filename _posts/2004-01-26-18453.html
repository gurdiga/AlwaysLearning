<div id="ygrps-yiv-930717325">The Happy Child by Harrison? I just finished it and found it very <br/>
thought provoking. The writer mentions Holt and Neill as some of his <br/>
inspiration so I was hopeing it is okey that I ask. I had a rather <br/>
hard day myself, icy here and we lost electricity 3 times, but the <br/>
worse is that I think my ds is coming down sick because he treated <br/>
me terribly all day today, perhaps I have the winter blues as well.. <br/>
I&#39;m on a new book now &quot;Making it up as we go along - the Albany Free <br/>
school story&quot; seems interesting but even in NY it appears that they <br/>
were getting state $ for meals and several volunteer teachers and <br/>
other resources that I&#39;m sure that here in Missouri we are not going <br/>
to get. It&#39;s important to me that everyone be able to have a good <br/>
quality education not just those who can afford to homeschool or <br/>
afford private school tuition, I saw a &quot;free school&quot; starting in AZ <br/>
that looked nice and was planning on going on &quot;donations&quot; alone, I <br/>
don&#39;t know how they expect to keep that up as well, the property <br/>
taxes alone are terrible! Let alone things like food and books!!!</div>
