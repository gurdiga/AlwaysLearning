<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815237129">I&#39;m having some issues with my husband not being fully on board with how I feel about homeschooling/unschooling and was hoping for some resources/advice/information on talking to him about the subject.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter Mary is turning 4 next week, and we&#39;ve already got some notices in the mail about how she is now eligible for 4K programs and inviting us to open houses and the like.  I&#39;ve been talking about homeschooling/unschooling with my husband for some time now, but it seems it&#39;s all about to become very real.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, I&#39;m afraid, is second-guessing our decision to keep our daughter home from school.  There have been several occasions during the past couple of weeks where she has wanted to do something (like watch a movie, or play on the computer) and he has told her that she should should do something to &quot;use your brain&quot; instead.  I don&#39;t like this phrase at all.  I mean, it&#39;s not like her brain shuts off when she&#39;s watching a movie or looking at the computer.  I know for certain that she learns tons of stuff doing those things.  I&#39;m fairly certain that playing on the computer has been a huge part of how she learned to read.  He has also made comments to me about how he thinks our daughter is &quot;regressing,&quot; meaning that she used to be smarter and now she isn&#39;t.  This blows my mind.  I mean, we have a 3 year old that can READ for crying out loud.  She&#39;s very bright, and interesting, and creative, and all sorts of great things.  Even if she couldn&#39;t read, she&#39;s still awesome.  I think that his feelings like this are fleeting (meaning he doesn&#39;t feel that way all the time) and stem from his own insecurities about not sending her to school the way everyone else is.<br/>
<br/>
It especially bothers me that sometimes he says things like this when she is in earshot.  The example I am thinking of happened earlier today when we were riding in the car.  Mary was in the back seat counting out loud just for the fun of it, and she got to 29 and asked me what number comes next.  I simply responded &quot;Thirty,&quot; but then my husband said something along the lines of I shouldn&#39;t keep hand-holding with her and that she knows better than that and that maybe she needs to go to school because she&#39;s &quot;regressing.&quot;  Now I *know* that Mary can count past 30 because I&#39;ve heard her do it lots of times.  Mary knows she can count past 30, and my husband knows it too.  So who cares if she asks what comes after 29 when we&#39;re riding in the car?  It&#39;s not like everything is a test and we need to keep quizzing her.  I distinctly remember being quizzed on counting out loud in kindergarten, and being so into it that I would draw out the nine and forget what set of tens I was on.  For example, &quot;twenty-eight, twenty-niiiiiiiiiiine, THIRTY!&quot;  Sometimes that &quot;niiiiiiiine&quot; would be so long I would forget if I was on the twenties or thirties or whatever and mess up.  I would get upset because I knew how to count up into the hundreds, but the teacher would make me stop because I had made a mistake.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what was going on with Mary, but it doesn&#39;t really matter.  I told him that Mary is definitely NOT regressing and that he definitely shouldn&#39;t ever say things like that in front of her.  <br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of his concern stems from worrying about what other people will think when they find out we are homeschooling.  Like, that we&#39;re a bunch of weirdos, or that we&#39;re lazy, or that we are socially awkward, or religious wackos, or any number of typical stereotypes.  To me, I don&#39;t really worry about what other people will think.  If they are people we don&#39;t know really well, then who cares?  If they are people we do know really well, then they will see that we aren&#39;t any of those things.<br/>
<br/>
So how can I help him to understand?  When I wanted to relax a lot of our rules about food with Mary, I printed off a few pages with excerpts from Sandra&#39;s site and left them for him to find.  (I&#39;m strewing for my husband!)  This seemed to work really well.  For some reason, I&#39;m having trouble knowing what to give him for this issue because it&#39;s not as narrow as &quot;food&quot; and I&#39;m not certain what would help him best.  I can&#39;t really just point him to Sandra&#39;s site because it&#39;s so huge that I think it would be overwhelming.  (Though I LOVE that it&#39;s huge and I&#39;m always finding new things on there!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

<br/>
Is it really good to think of it as &quot;our decision&quot; then?  If the two  <br/>
of you had agreed on a school and then you started thinking  <br/>
homeschooling would be better, would it be fair for him to say &quot;My  <br/>
wife, I&#39;m afraid, is second-guessing our decision to enroll our  <br/>
daughter in school&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-This blows my mind. I mean, we have a 3 year old that can READ for  <br/>
crying out loud. She&#39;s very bright, and interesting, and creative, and  <br/>
all sorts of great things. Even if she couldn&#39;t read, she&#39;s still  <br/>
awesome. I think that his feelings like this are fleeting (meaning he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel that way all the time) and stem from his own insecurities  <br/>
about not sending her to school the way everyone else is.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could point out gently, quietly, that because she can  <br/>
already read, she&#39;ll end up being bored in school, and possibly/likely  <br/>
resented by the other kids, and made to spend hundreds of hours  <br/>
reading things that are way too easy for her.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I simply responded &quot;Thirty,&quot; but then my husband said something  <br/>
along the lines of I shouldn&#39;t keep hand-holding with her -=-<br/>
<br/>
If he asked you a simple question and you responded, would you be  <br/>
&quot;hand-holding with him&quot;?   And he&#39;s not three years old. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think a lot of his concern stems from worrying about what other  <br/>
people will think when they find out we are homeschooling. Like, that  <br/>
we&#39;re a bunch of weirdos, or that we&#39;re lazy, or that we are socially  <br/>

<br/>
MANY parents do great harm to their children by being more concerned  <br/>
what a stranger three doors down will think than taking the small  <br/>
effort to change enough to care more about what their child is feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone here make a recommendation from Joyce&#39;s page?  Sometimes  <br/>
dads like her writing better than mine.  And maybe because it&#39;s not  <br/>
overwhelmingly big (or doesn&#39;t appear to be at first glance &lt;g&gt;), that  <br/>
would be a good place for him to look?  I don&#39;t mean just send him  <br/>
there, but maybe if Joyce or someone could think of one article you  <br/>
could print it out, or at least part of it, and tell him you&#39;d like to  <br/>
talk about it, maybe.  Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe talking about his own childhood would be helpful.  What does he  <br/>
remember from being three and four?  What would have been fun and  <br/>
helpful to him then?  Don&#39;t &quot;Freud&quot; out about it, just touch it and  <br/>
back away, unless he wants to talk about it and the ideas flow.    If  <br/>
you have memories of being that age, maybe tell a story, one or two,  <br/>
and then let it lie, give him a few days to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
If he seems intent on looking at school, ask him to wait a year.  A  <br/>
year is a lot of days, and it&#39;s probably better not to press  <br/>
unschooling *every* day, in his direction.   Let him think about the  <br/>
little things you do say or point out about your daughter&#39;s learning.<br/>
<br/>
Getting him around other kids her age would help.  Getting him around  <br/>
other unschoolers might help a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605357071"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There have been several occasions during the past couple of weeks  <br/>
&gt; where she has wanted to do something (like watch a movie, or play  <br/>
&gt; on the computer) and he has told her that she should should do  <br/>
&gt; something to &quot;use your brain&quot; instead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of seeing his response as wrong, see it as genuine concern  <br/>
and worry. You telling him he&#39;s wrong doesn&#39;t make the fear go away.  <br/>
 From his point of view he has real reasons to fear. Probably the  <br/>
more you counter his responses to his worry, the more worried he&#39;ll  <br/>
get since he isn&#39;t getting help dealing with it. It&#39;s like telling a  <br/>
6 yo there are no monsters under the bed. All the words and  <br/>
reassurances don&#39;t make the monsters go away. They just tell the  <br/>
child he&#39;s on his own to deal with them.<br/>
<br/>
At a time removed from one of these instances when you&#39;re both calm,  <br/>
acknowledge his concern. Bring up the incident and let him know that  <br/>
you understand he&#39;s concerned but that by telling her she should do  <br/>
something different, the effect might be opposite of what he wants.  <br/>
If he sits down with a bowl of ice cream he&#39;s been looking forward to  <br/>
and you tell him maybe he should have something healthy like fruit,  <br/>
does it make him want ice cream less and fruit more? Does it make him  <br/>
look forward to your presence and potential comments when he sits  <br/>
down with a bowl of ice cream? Does it make him want to sneak the ice  <br/>
cream so he can avoid your commentary and judgement?<br/>
<br/>
Instead of those moments when she&#39;s settling into something she  <br/>
enjoys, how about picking moments when she&#39;s less engaged or wrapping  <br/>
something up to draw her into something *with* him rather than  <br/>
directing her away alone to something else.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d ask him if he could talk to you about his concerns when Mary  <br/>
can&#39;t hear rather than talk about it in front of Mary. She&#39;s not  <br/>
going to be able to grasp what he says and what his concerns are  <br/>
really about. She&#39;ll pick up the negativity and feel bad or wrong for  <br/>
something she doesn&#39;t really understand. If she associates negativity  <br/>
with counting, for instance, she might just stop counting.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he thinks our daughter is &quot;regressing,&quot; meaning that she used to be  <br/>
&gt; smarter and now she isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Often it&#39;s good to acknowledge someone&#39;s observation. I would bet  <br/>
that it *does* look like she&#39;s regressing. If she was doing things  <br/>
that demonstrated what she knows and is learning but is now doing a  <br/>
lot of learning that&#39;s internal and quiet, it will *look* like she&#39;s  <br/>
not doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently Einstein looked like he was riding his bike to work at the  <br/>
patent office when he was working out his theory of relativity ;-)  <br/>
Unschooling *is* less satisfying that way. There are so many times we  <br/>
have to trust that learning&#39;s going on because mostly it&#39;s happening  <br/>
internally. The problem with schools is that teachers and parents get  <br/>
feedback that learning is *supposedly* happening, but the feedback  <br/>
really only means kids can spit something back on paper long enough  <br/>
to be tested. It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve actually learned it or  <br/>
understand it.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra suggested there might be a couple of pages of mine that might  <br/>
help him. I&#39;m thinking the two that are linked at her site:<br/>

Products of Education<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re both broad about the difference between school learning and  <br/>
natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Then maybe when a specific issue comes up you can find something at  <br/>
my site that&#39;s more focused:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414639941">Also, two things about the handschooling site itself:<br/>
<br/>
1) handschooling is not readily defined on the site without clicking<br/>
around some more, and many people might not get the point of the term<br/>
or care to without a definition right on the front page<br/>
<br/>
2) while the idea is fine for promoting greater accessibility to info<br/>
in visual format on internet pages, unschooling is likely to seem a<br/>
big leap from handschooling since unschooling itself is a much broader<br/>
idea encompassing way more of the senses in a child&#39;s life and<br/>
experiences than that found on pages, even internet pages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-845310085">I did check out the site about handschooling because my husband (and our families) are still unsure about unschooling.  Although we have homeschooled since 1987 (I am 2nd generation), we have &#39;unschooled&#39; our children for 10 years, from birth.  I have really not explained our methods to anyone because we do not have any!  We just live and learn.  <br/>
<br/>
This website was very confusing to me.  It seemed VERY political and was not geared toward homeschooling at all.  They seem to be advocating a mobile wireless device as the &quot;global knowledge commons network&quot;.  I unschool because I want to facilitate my chidren&#39;s education not have them learn everything from a portable internet device. <br/>
<br/>
I would most definitely not recommend this site to anyone who is confused/unsupportive of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
This quote alone was enough to make me stop reading the web page and write this note to the group:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, our children need a place to spend the day.<br/>
Yes, our kids need to learn to socialize with each other.<br/>
Yes, students need to articulate, discourse, and compete.<br/>
Yes, our youngsters need to have teachers guide them to knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
None of the above has to do with the fact that knowledge has moved online.<br/>
Nonetheless, billions are spent every year perpetuating a system of local schools where kids are required by law to spend their days, in a system that is based on the assumption that we send our kids to school to learn knowledge and be certified to their achievement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids DO NOT NEED any of the above that cannot be provided in a safe, loving home environment.  Has the author ever heard of homeschooling?  My children are not required by any law in this country to spend their days in a government system.  In fact, the laws are just the opposite; I have the freedom to choose what is best for my children.<br/>
<br/>
I have enjoyed this site, although I am new here!  I have also read several Dodd and Holt books as well as other authors.  We use our daily lives to educate our children.  We facilitate their education with activities and books and computers from home and away.  We do use the internet and I don&#39;t think our children are suffering from a lack of global knowledge.  <br/>
<br/>
I was very disappointed with the recommendation of this website.  Thank you, Sandra, for requesting that this site be used for unschooling issues.  I look forward to reading more posts to help my own current situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431559082">My oldest daughter also read at 3 1/2.  The library is still one of her favorite places as she has never been forced to read, read aloud, discuss what she doesn&#39;t want to, read specific bks on a timetable, or been classified as gifted/slow etc.  I think she felt supported in that I&#39;d just answer her questions (not say &quot;look it up&quot; in the dictionary, etc).  She is now 12.  Some of her schooled friends seem to lose a kind of spark/enthusiasm for certain things like joining book clubs, reading in general, etc.  Maybe because they have so much required of them in school?  I love that my daughter has a continued interest in reading and knows she can learn what she wants to when and if she wants to (and in many different ways, not just from reading).  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I simply responded &quot;Thirty,&quot; but then my husband said something  along the lines of I shouldn&#39;t keep hand-holding with her -<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the case of a math question, perhaps your daughter felt nervous counting in front of her dad as she might sense his anxiety.  Or maybe she is just asking because she forgot for a second and wanted a quick answer and assumed she could rely on you or her dad to provide it?  Either way, answering the simple question (assuming we know the answer) helps us build trust as our kids learn they can depend on us yet again.  <br/>
<br/>
Your husband already knows some of the many things your daughter has learned.  Can he trust her longer to notice her make more &quot;progress?&quot;  If it would help him, books are available that show what is generally taught in what grade (Nancy Plent has them -<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschoolersnetwork.bravehost.com/guides.html)">http://www.unschoolersnetwork.bravehost.com/guides.html)</a>  Maybe he&#39;d see that she knows much of it already and realize she&#39;d be bored.  <br/>
<br/>
To help think about how parents generally treat their children, might he be willing to watch &quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; by Alfie Kohn?  It is available as a book or DVD.  The dvd is a taping of one of his two hour lectures.  <br/>

I don&#39;t know if buying an &quot;unschooling guide&quot; ( which is NOT unschooling at all)will help a dad understand unschooling.<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of it at all.<br/>
Suggesting things to read, going to a Conference, maybe having him join the SSUDS group and honest conversations will be the way to go before you BUY a guide of what children are supposed to learn in school.<br/>
Actually you can find that information online for free if you google. I did and got a ton  of links.<br/>
Also it says:<br/>
&quot;Our guides are researched so that you can see what schools teach at<br/>
each level. They offer simple suggestions that help you go about<br/>
presenting subjects in non-school like ways. They list sources for<br/>
materials for each subject that are especially appropriate for home<br/>
teaching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How is that unschooling at all?<br/>
Will giving him more school stuff help a dad understand unschooling?<br/>
  <br/>
When my son was younger around 3 or 4 my husband once said that he thought  he needed to at least learn the baiscs ( which of course he meant I needed to teach him the basics) I asked him if he still remember what he was thought in school and reminded him how I learned to read and all the stuff he learned out of school)<br/>
He got it. He did not remember  much. He hated school and it was a waste of time for him. He felt stupid and slow in school and all he wanted to do is be home and farm and how much he learned just doing that.<br/>
He could not do math problems in school but can figure out complicated math stuff  in his head if it has to do with farming.<br/>
Another thing that really made a difference was meeting Ben Lovejoy  ( he came over to our home and they bonded over a bike ride) and David Waynforth ( repectively Kelly Lovejoy and Schuyler Waynforth&#39;s  husbands ).<br/>
He also loved the almost two days he spent at a Conference seeing the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741227063">***My husband, I&#39;m afraid, is second-guessing our decision to keep our daughter home from school. ***<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I made the decision to keep Chamille out of school when she was 5.  It felt like I&#39;d just turned the world upside down, I didn&#39;t, but that&#39;s how it felt.  Five yr olds are supposed to go to kindergarten, moms are supposed to have their heart felt, teary good byes to their little ones on their first day of school.  Right?  So, when I decided not to do that, it felt really big to me.  The weird thing, kindergarten didn&#39;t even exist here when I was 5, unless you put your child in a private school.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of husbands are really unfamiliar with child development in general.  A lot dads expect more from their little ones than they are developmentally able to give.  Just because a 4 yr old can read, doesn&#39;t mean she can wipe herself after going to the toilet, for example.  When my oldest didn&#39;t go to school for kindergarten, her best friend was being put in all the Talented and Gifted programs because she already knew how to read.  Same age, same general developmental abilities, same abilities to think, both girls played house and imagination games, but with the one significant difference of one  being able to read.<br/>
<br/>
Parents totally buy into this too, that a child is somehow extra special if they learn how to read early.  Today, both those girls are 15, both are still smart and able to think and reason, each of them have interesting talents, both of them can read, my daughter is still not in school and the other girl still is.  What this other girl has that my daughter doesn&#39;t, lots and lots and lots of homework for her upper level, talented classes.<br/>
<br/>
***I think a lot of his concern stems from worrying about what other people will think when they find out we are homeschooling. Like, that we&#39;re a bunch of weirdos, or that we&#39;re lazy, or that we are socially awkward, or religious wackos, or any number of typical stereotypes. ***<br/>
<br/>
All those folks exist in schools too, weirdo parents, lazy parents, socially awkward parents, religious wacko parents.  Homeschoolers represent a cross section of society, at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve found over the years.  It might help your husband a great deal to see your daughter playing with other homeschool kids, and even other school kids, so he can kind of see the differences in play and interaction and to get a feel for how kids in general ARE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766011444">Hi Melissa<br/>
<br/>
Just on the counting thing:<br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing the same thing happen with my sons and nephews... it took<br/>
a while for me to recognise that for them, asking someone else for the next<br/>
number was a new (level or phase or variation) in the play of their counting<br/>
game... much as one singer might cue another to pitch in with the next line<br/>
of a song - we both know the song, how about you  join in (maybe this is why<br/>
it took me so long to recognise the play because I don&#39;t know many songs and<br/>
don&#39;t sing).  I&#39;ve sometimes seem this phase of a child asking parent what<br/>
number comes next, using precisely the same words the parents had earlier<br/>
used to either test, or encourage the child to play the counting game.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could explore the idea with your husband that when Mary is<br/>
asking about something you know she knows, she is actually inviting you to<br/>
join in the game... and your challenge as parents is to see with how much<br/>
fun you can join in?  I&#39;ve seen some parents play with wrong answers, some<br/>
pretend to forget, some sing or use funny voices to join in, some use a<br/>
different language, some use cryptics (other ways to represent numbers such<br/>
as a dozen for 12 or bakers dozen for thirteen, two hands for ten, a glove<br/>
for five, a goal for six (in Australian rules football a goal is worth 6<br/>
points)).<br/>
<br/>
If playing is a challenge for your husband as it was for me there was a book<br/>
called Playful Parenting by Lawrence Cohen that I found inspiring.<br/>

&gt; responded &quot;Thirty,&quot; but then my husband said something along the lines of I<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t keep hand-holding with her and that she knows better than that and<br/>
&gt; that maybe she needs to go to school because she&#39;s &quot;regressing.&quot; Now I<br/>
&gt; *know* that Mary can count past 30 because I&#39;ve heard her do it lots of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898975776">I think in addition to all that has been said, that it might be worth gently<br/>
mentioning to your dh that your dd is only about to be 4. Despite all the<br/>
recent and new push for universal preschool - which is a really a way of<br/>
providing free childcare to working parents - your dd has already<br/>
accomplished more of the school readiness activity that a pre-K program will<br/>
do because she is already reading. Perhaps it is worth using the delaying<br/>
tactic of reminding him what the legal requirements are in your state.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some of the pedagogical writings against early academics by well<br/>
known experts would help your dh relax.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is 10. Sometimes she wants to pretend to be a baby and talks in high<br/>
pitched baby talk. It is hard to listen to at times. She does not forget how<br/>
to read or lose her vocabulary just because of these momentary games.<br/>
Sometimes she wants to double check what she knows and asks a relatively<br/>
simplistic question.<br/>
<br/>
I think your dh is using what can be a pretty serious diagnostic term -<br/>
&quot;regression&quot; - to describe playing around with words. Maybe asking him to<br/>
clarify what he really thinks is happening in her mind - I have a hunch it<br/>
will really be about his fears about how she might look to others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sometimes a bit of pessimist. With that in mind I would not talk *too*<br/>
much to him about her early reading, or he will likely start on the subject<br/>
of getting her into AP and Gifted programs, a whole other issue...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that in this one person&#39;s situation it might not be such a bad <br/>
idea. I mean - if you&#39;ve got a checklist of what they&#39;re supposed to be <br/>
learning in kindergarten and first grade and you actually can check it <br/>
all off, then you&#39;ve possibly gotten yourself a couple of years grace <br/>
period - a lot of time for him to learn more and come to better <br/>
understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You could get the world book course of study list or the state standards <br/>
for your state (the ones for California on available online).  The world <br/>
book course of study for kindergarten is here:<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?curriculum/kindergarten">http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?curriculum/kindergarten</a>&gt; I mean - <br/>
c&#39;mon - it includes things like: * Observation of everyday, familiar <br/>
things &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I used to look at lists like that - and let them inspire me to expose or <br/>
introduce my kids to new things or things I might not have thought of as <br/>
potentially interesting. When I look at that list and see, &quot;Simple <br/>
Measurement&quot; for example, I might think of picking up some plastic <br/>
measuring spoons and measuring cups to have as bath toys. I mean, maybe. <br/>
IF that seemed like something my kid might enjoy. (My kids liked all <br/>
kinds of things used as bath toys a lot when they were little and pool <br/>
toys, too, as they got older.)<br/>
<br/>
Also - sometimes these lists give hints about the developmental stages <br/>
of kids of about that age. Notice that counting from 1 to 20 is on the <br/>
kindergarten list --- that means that is something they hope kids will <br/>
learn that year - the year they turn 6 years old! I think it might <br/>
really help some people relax during those early years if they are more <br/>
aware of what the school is actually trying to teach. Many people <br/>
imagine it to be a lot more than it really is.<br/>

Even the chapter in Judy Breck&#39;s book &#39;Intertwingle&#39; (her vision of the world in 2030) that she calls &quot;Unschooling&quot; is not about unschooling as I understand it. It&#39;s more akin to an acknowledgement of the value of informal learning and that children are perfectly capable of learning informally by themselves. Even business leaders have been known to acknowledge that as much as 80% of what people know about their jobs is learned on the job not in the classroom and that&#39;s not unschooling either.<br/>
<br/>
In my view, the website is useful for getting through to people who are still fixed on the idea that children need to go to school to get an education and particularly it helps to make clear the fact that, in 2010, *nobody* actually needs to be physically present in a specific designated location (such as, for example, a school classroom) in order to get a &#39;good education&#39;, never mind those who prefer not to go there to begin with.<br/>

<br/>
I got the connection too!  But then I initially came to unschooling from a very anti-school stance, one that I&#39;ve softened over the years!  Some things help people connect the dots and some things don&#39;t.  It really depends on the person and how they think!  So, even though I got where you were going with it, it did help to have the explanation of how YOUR dots connected!  <br/>
<br/>
That is what I&#39;ve found really nice in unschooling discussions, is seeing the thoughts of lots of people and how they interpret things and take them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did check out the site about handschooling because my husband (and<br/>
&gt; our families) are still unsure about unschooling.  Although we have<br/>
&gt; homeschooled since 1987 (I am 2nd generation), we have &#39;unschooled&#39; our<br/>
&gt; children for 10 years, from birth.  I have really not explained our methods<br/>
&gt; to anyone because we do not have any!  We just live and learn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This website was very confusing to me.  It seemed VERY political and<br/>
&gt; was not geared toward homeschooling at all.  They seem to be advocating a<br/>
&gt; mobile wireless device as the &quot;global knowledge commons network&quot;.  I<br/>
&gt; unschool because I want to facilitate my chidren&#39;s education not have them<br/>
&gt; learn everything from a portable internet device.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would most definitely not recommend this site to anyone who is<br/>
&gt; confused/unsupportive of unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s fair enough. I guess not everybody sees the connection.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bob<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I should add that I agree the website isn&#39;t about unschooling. Even the<br/>
&gt; chapter in Judy Breck&#39;s book &#39;Intertwingle&#39; (her vision of the world in<br/>
&gt; 2030) that she calls &quot;Unschooling&quot; is not about unschooling as I understand<br/>
&gt; it. It&#39;s more akin to an acknowledgement of the value of informal learning<br/>
&gt; and that children are perfectly capable of learning informally by<br/>
&gt; themselves. Even business leaders have been known to acknowledge that as<br/>
&gt; much as 80% of what people know about their jobs is learned on the job not<br/>
&gt; in the classroom and that&#39;s not unschooling either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my view, the website is useful for getting through to people who are<br/>
&gt; still fixed on the idea that children need to go to school to get an<br/>
&gt; education and particularly it helps to make clear the fact that, in 2010,<br/>
&gt; *nobody* actually needs to be physically present in a specific designated<br/>
&gt; location (such as, for example, a school classroom) in order to get a &#39;good<br/>
&gt; education&#39;, never mind those who prefer not to go there to begin with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps that is only my view! Anyway, I&#39;m not going to talk about it any<br/>
&gt; more. LOL<br/>
