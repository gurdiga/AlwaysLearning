This article was sent to me by Linda Peden, on facebook.  <br/>
<br/>
The author programmed one of the most violent scenes ever, and has a little different defense/acceptance than some other commenters I&#39;ve seen.  If you have friends or relatives who think games cause violence they might feel better about this than they do from total dismissal.<br/>

At the ALL Unschooling event in Albuquerque, Luke Davidson, Jill Parmer&#39;s 14 year old son, said that if gamers tried to shoot someone it would look like this (and he acted out furious typing on a keyboard).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054620598">Thank you for sharing this!  It&#39;s a good article to start a discussion. <br/>
I particularly enjoyed reading through the comments and wanted to<br/>
suggest that as well.  Some really thoughtful, intelligent ideas and<br/>
opinions being shared.  Some may be hard to understand if you don&#39;t play<br/>
video games, but not all.   My son and I have these discussions (he<br/>
plays some of these games) and I always figure-out and learn something<br/>
new.  This article along with the comments did the same.<br/>
