<div id="ygrps-yiv-148842836"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My name is Bonnie and I have 3 kids, ages 10-12.&nbsp; I&#39;ve unschooled them all their life and am familiar with many of you as I&#39;m a long time lurker and have been on several lists.&nbsp; I usually just read and absorb.&nbsp; I went to a unschooling conference years ago in&nbsp;Peabody, Massachusetts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I posted this concern some time ago on AlwaysUnschooled and know that a few of them are on this list so I apologize for the repeat but&nbsp;I&#39;m still having this concern and I haven&#39;t found any posts&nbsp;that are similar to the issue I am having although I&#39;m sure they are out there.&nbsp; I thought since several of you have grown kids, you might be able to provide some insight into this issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This concerns my son who is 12 1/2.&nbsp; I relaxed when you all told me he would read which he did at age 10 1/2.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don&#39;t feel as confident about his writing skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempts to get him to write are met with resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he senses any anxiety coming from me or his father, he will visibly become upset and hang his head.&nbsp;I feel terrible when that happens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What prompted me to write to this list today is because when I was out, apparently my kids were fooling around and broke a decoration.&nbsp; My son wrote the following in all caps:&nbsp; YEE R SORRY&nbsp; HER&#39;S 1$ 1 c (two lines drawn through the c)&nbsp; This is suppose to say We are sorry.&nbsp; Here&#39;s $1 and 1 euro.&nbsp; The lines for the euro were vertical instead of horizontal. We live in Germany.&nbsp; My first thought was how nice that they offered to pay for the damage:)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The $ sign was backwards. He does this often.&nbsp;When spelling his name the other day, he wrote the N backwards.&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried a couple of suggestions from the other list such as Mad Libs and writing emails.&nbsp; He wasn&#39;t interested in the Mad Libs and if he even checks his email(rarely), he will reply with as few words as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One thing is that he likes to hang with the family so he is never in any position where he would be asked to write such as filling out a form or giving feedback.&nbsp; Truthfully, I&#39;m glad as he would probably be humiliated.&nbsp; One time a long time ago he went to the teen center and had to sign his name and the receptionist stared at him as he painstakingly wrote his name.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, he writes his name and that is about it.&nbsp; He won&#39;t even do that unless he has to.&nbsp; He got upset one day when I was going out and told him that a package would probably arrive while I was gone and asked if he could sign for it.&nbsp; He said do I have to?&nbsp; He spends his days on the computer playing PS3.&nbsp; He is happy doing that and does little else.&nbsp; He is also involved in basketball and bowling and we do many family activities on the weekends and during the week sometimes.</p><p><var id="ygrps-yiv-148842836yui-ie-cursor"></var>&nbsp;</p><p>He&nbsp;is unable to spell the simplest of words and has no concept regarding sentence structure or punctuation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#39;m at a loss.&nbsp; What do I do to help him without coming across like&nbsp;I am shaming him?&nbsp; When do I get concerned? Should I be concerned?&nbsp; I always try and encourage him to do new things and try what he wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;He still sleeps with me as well as his two siblings.&nbsp;He is very young compared to your typical 12 year old and he is sensitive to the fact that he is smaller than the majority of 12 year olds and could easily pass for a 9 or 10 year old.&nbsp; He cries very easily whenever the slightest frustration arises.&nbsp; He sucks his thumb at night.&nbsp; Could this possibly fall under some type of developmental delay?&nbsp; Am I trying to make some sort of bizarre correlation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would appreciate any feedback that can help me see this another way or help me to help him or just find peace.&nbsp; While I was concerned a little about his late reading, somehow I knew it would come about but I don&#39;t see writing as evolving the same way or am I wrong?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you, Bonnie</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

Telling stories, letting him tell you what a movie or video was about (so that he organizes his thoughts and chooses words without being rushed or corrected), playing with rhyming words, or song lyrics, or things casually about that involve words, might be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The first writing Marty did was keeping lists of things he was collecting.  He did it on his own, for his own private purposes.<br/>

In his ability to articulate a thought? &nbsp;Writing is one means of communication, and getting things and ideas on paper can happen in a variety of ways. Often when motivation and need is there, it will come. And if it doesn&#39;t, speech to text software is great, as are transcriptionists. &nbsp;You&#39;d be surprised how many authors and business leaders dictate their communications or use ghost writers.&nbsp;</div><div> What is most important is about how *he* feels about his ability to communicate. That he is able to write and what&#39;s hard now will be easier later, when it matters for him, to him.&nbsp;</div><div>My boys (ages 14 and almost 12) &nbsp;are amazing thinkers but both only write when it&#39;s important to them. &nbsp;My oldest son (14) &nbsp;is often told how good he is with language. &nbsp;He plays with it, loves to investigate meanings, where words come from, has an adult vocabulary and is completely comfortable and capable of having adult conversations. &nbsp;But he doesn&#39;t write by hand unless is absolutely has to. &nbsp;He text chats for gaming *all-the time*, but handwriting anything takes *much* longer than most. &nbsp; </div><div>Today on Facebook he shared his thoughts on an unschooling article because he wanted to share his very strong opinion on it. It was a short thing that took him 45 minutes to write, but it was important enough to him to take the time and energy to do so. &nbsp;He&#39;s written online &nbsp;about gaming and airsoft, because he likes to share his thoughts and contribute to those communities.</div><div>When he was 12 he walked out of a boy scout meeting completely frustrated, in tears, &nbsp;because they expected him to write by hand the answers, quickly. &nbsp;We supported his decision. There was nothing in the rules that required him to write it by hand. He could have typed it or dictated it, but the leader required by &nbsp;hand. That wasn&#39;t going to work. We supported that. We supported him. &nbsp;</div><div>Last summer he took a biology lab class that required handwritten answers on lab reports. I sat with him for hours, bringing him coffee and snacks, making him smile, while he painstakingly wrote out each answer in as few words as possible while still &nbsp;being accurate and in a complete sentence. It took him 8 hours to do 20 questions. &nbsp;But he did it and felt good about the result because it was important to him.&nbsp;</div><div>My younger son (almost 12) has difficulty with language. He&#39;s a visual-spatial thinker, language is hard. &nbsp;When he can dictate his thoughts, he&#39;ll &quot;write&quot; pages. When he has to write it himself by hand, it&#39;s barely a short sentence. &nbsp;But if it&#39;s important enough to him, he&#39;ll handwrite a message, much like your son did, or short labels for his designs. When he starts to get tired or isn&#39;t up to writing by hand himself, I&#39;ll take his dictation. &nbsp; It&#39;s more important to me that he communicates, that he shares his thoughts and ideas, than the method of communication he chooses to use. It&#39;s hard enough to translate his thoughts into words than to make a big deal over the delivery method. &nbsp;I just love to hear his thoughts and ideas and make sure he knows that and feels safe about sharing them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;&lt;The $ sign was backwards. He does this often.&nbsp;When spelling his name the other day, he wrote the N backwards.&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried a couple of suggestions from the other list such as Mad Libs and writing emails.&nbsp; He wasn&#39;t interested in the Mad Libs and if he even checks his email(rarely), he will reply with as few words as possible.&gt;&gt;</div><div>&nbsp;He took the time and energy to write something to you that was important. What a great thing!&nbsp;</div><div>On Mad Libs, do you do them orally or are you expecting him to do them in writing? Different skills and thought processes. Separate them. Doing them orally as a family activity is a lot of fun. Doing them by yourself when writing is incredibly &nbsp;hard is no fun at all.&nbsp;</div><div><span style="">Conciseness is good. In professional writing, conciseness is fantastic. &nbsp; For my older son I had to realize this as a wonderful thing. &nbsp;When he writes, he painstaking figures out exactly what words and phrasing he wants to use and uses as few words as possible. His writing is very concise, first draft. &nbsp;His older sister loves to write and will write thousands of words and then spends hours in the editing process to make her writing tighter, more concise, or to fit into a designated word count. He just does it on the front end of his process.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="">My younger son also periodically writes letters backwards, or more often words in mirror image. But so did Da Vinci. &nbsp;Some reports say that Da Vinci only wrote legibly for others when it was important to him that others read his work. &nbsp;Sometimes I share with my son &nbsp;stories of great thinkers and inventors to encourage him. &nbsp;We&#39;ve also had conversations about how everyone has their strengths, he has talents others don&#39;t have, and vice versa.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=""><br></span></div><div>&lt;&lt;One thing is that he likes to hang with the family so he is never in any position where he would be asked to write such as filling out a form or giving feedback.&nbsp; Truthfully, I&#39;m glad as he would probably be humiliated.&nbsp; One time a long time ago he went to the teen center and had to sign his name and the receptionist stared at him as he painstakingly wrote his name. &gt;&gt;</div><div>Eventually the time will come when he needs to fill out a form, but usually it&#39;s electronic. My 14 yo son just did his very first form (a job application) by hand. &nbsp;He knew that he needed time to do it, so he brought it home, took a photocopy of it, and wrote out all the info on the copy first. Then painstakingly copied it over to the original as neatly as he could. (a process my mom taught me when all forms were by hand or typewritten). &nbsp;He is now talking about buying a typewriter for those special occasions when he needs to fill out a form by hand. It&#39;s easier for him. And really it is preferred. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>My son (14) now has a job. All the communication is either in person or &nbsp;electronic, which he loves. He filled out all the government forms for payroll by hand, over coffee at Starbucks. &nbsp;Something enjoyable to go with a challenging task, with a little encouraging coaching support from me, explaining what each form was and meant. &nbsp;He commented, &quot;that was easier than I thought it was going to be.&quot; &nbsp; Getting a job was important to him, so he tackled the paperwork he needed to - because it was important.</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;&lt;He&nbsp;is unable to spell the simplest of words and has no concept regarding sentence structure or punctuation. &gt;&gt;</div><div>When he needs to write, when it matters to him, he&#39;ll ask. &nbsp;If he can speak coherently then he probably has a handle on sentence structure. Punctuation is easily explained when the need arises. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>In my son&#39;s job search he had to write a letter of introduction, a cover letter, &nbsp;a resume, &nbsp;and follow up emails. He asked me to proof his writing and we worked through all the punctuation at that time. It was important to him, so each time there was less and less for me to proof. &nbsp;Now he has a handle on it, better than some of the articles edited when I was a magazine editor.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;&lt;I&#39;m at a loss.&nbsp; What do I do to help him without coming across like&nbsp;I am shaming him?&nbsp; When do I get concerned? Should I be concerned?&nbsp; I always try and encourage him to do new things and try what he wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</div><div>While I was writing this, I asked my almost 12 yo whether he had any words of advice. He said, &quot;if its important to him, it&#39;ll come&quot; &nbsp; Having been there, I can say that my husband and I have had many behind the door conversations addressing concerns for both boys writing. Concerns that are based on our own schooled-expectations that when we examine them don&#39;t hold up to reality. &nbsp;In school they will only accommodate. &nbsp;The boys are much better off in situations where we can assist with the writing needs (like at activities) and where they can take the time and energy to write when it&#39;s truly important to them. &nbsp;This is opinion, but my feeling is that it&#39;s much better to encourage and support at where they are at, &nbsp;than to pressure them into something they aren&#39;t ready for and create writing blocks and/or phobias. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&lt;&lt;While I was concerned a little about his late reading, somehow I knew it would come about but I don&#39;t see writing as evolving the same way or am I wrong?&gt;&gt;</div><div>Our experience is that yes, given &nbsp;acceptance, time, and encouragement, writing does come - when it&#39;s important to them to communicate. &nbsp;</div><div>In our family, &nbsp;we have living proof to talk about, and say that &quot;not yet, but you will...&quot; &nbsp;My brother was one of these kids - late reader, writing very very difficult. &nbsp;At 16 he published his first article in a technical magazine. &nbsp;oh his editor had her work cut out for her. Now at 40 he&#39;s written and published an article every month since he was 18 years old. He now owns and is the publisher of the technical magazine that published his first article. &nbsp;His spelling to this day is horrid, but he&#39;s a well respected leader in his profession and industry. &nbsp;Very few people know that writing was and is difficult or that his spelling and grammar still need a great deal of editing.&nbsp;</div><div>My father sees words as pictures. Spelling is difficult, so he is always asking someone how to spell a word. &nbsp;I&#39;ve only seen him handwrite labels on plans, but he writes via typing all the time. &nbsp;He runs three businesses, two non-profits, and speaks nationally. &nbsp;He has others that work for him to fill in the gaps on things he&#39;s not as good at. He&#39;s commented that writing is a slow process for him, to translate thoughts to words on paper. &nbsp;He writes not because it&#39;s easy, but he&#39;s found it&#39;s the best form for him to share information, thoughts, and ideas with others. &nbsp;And that&#39;s important to his work, so he does it.&nbsp;</div><div>My grandfather also ran a successful international company, despite the fact that he too struggled with language and writing. &nbsp;I did not know that my father and grandfather struggled with language until I was seeking ideas and explaining our philosophy to my father, &nbsp;asking him to respect our wishes to encourage our sons and not make a big deal about writing. &nbsp;He completely understood, because of his own journey as a son, person, and parent with reflection on what worked and didn&#39;t work for the three of them, he&#39;s agreed that letting them be is much better than the punitive or forced methods that were tried on them. His perspective anyway.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div> </div>  <div style="color:#fff;height:0;"></div>     <style type="text/css">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133598942">Hi, my son is 12 in 5 days and sounds like your son. We had concern about his handwriting, but we needed to remember that most people type these days and our kids don&#39;t run in to handwriting situations very often. we bought him a journal. We explained journals are a place to write feelings and thoughts, doodles.  He enjoyed it for awhile. He visits it every now and then. He also found an online journal website which he likes also. I asked him to try and write in it regularly. Only to exercise that skill(handwriting), but we don&#39;t make him. I would not want to crush journaling for him. <br/>
Also thought of sight words written on index cards and then making silly sentences. Or magnetic poetry, there are a few different kits. <br/>

Pam Sorooshian wrote it.  It&#39;s CALLED &quot;Economics of Restricting TV Watching of Children.&quot;  But the examples give are about food.  And if someone comes and says she&#39;s limiting her child&#39;s video game play, and he seems to just want more, we sent that link.  If someone were to come and say that her child wanted to play outside all the time and never, ever wanted to come inside, so she limited his outside time to two hours a day, someone would send her that link.<br/>
<br/>
Metaphorically speaking, we&#39;re trying to show people how to fish, not giving them one fish or even running a fish market.  I guess it looks like a fish market sometimes.  :-)  But at some point, ideally, each person stops needing other unschoolers to hold the back of her bike and she rides off confidently... to fish.   :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son isn&#39;t that fond of writing by hand either, but I picked up a few things to do with him, and some of them he liked very much.  One of them is a question a day, three year journal.  Here&#39;s a link to it:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Day-Kids-Three-Year-Journal/dp/0307952967/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1387913746&sr=8-2&keywords=five+year+journal+for+kids">http://www.amazon.com/Day-Kids-Three-Year-Journal/dp/0307952967/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1387913746&sr=8-2&keywords=five+year+journal+for+kids</a><br/>
<br/>
He also really liked dot-to-dots and mazes.  Not writing per se, but they have an element of pen control to them.  I picked up a really beautiful chalkboard from a used furniture store, and we have done all kinds of writing on there.  I have a painted chalkboard on the kitchen door that I keep my dinner menu on (when I remember).  Ethan sometimes likes to add requests on there as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Scribblenaughts, which you can get for the phone, iPad or Nintendo, is a game that has a big writing component to it.  Great game in my opinion.  It uses words to bring almost anything you can imagine onto the screen to solve puzzles.  I loved it.  So did Ethan.  If a word is spelled incorrectly, it offers suggestions.  No shaming there.  Great for me.  I&#39;m not a steller speller.  <br/>
<br/>
Minecraft has books you can write in, and signs you can write on.  Ethan and his friends have had a lot of fun with those.  <br/>
  <br/>
My husband and Ethan enjoy playing video games together.  They&#39;re computers are in separate rooms, so they use the chat bar in game.  Never has Doug corrected Ethan&#39;s written attempts to communicate.  Doug has gotten such a thrill out of seeing Ethan&#39;s abilities grow from his own enthusiasm for communicating.  That&#39;s been really cool.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, at age 11, Ethan still gets a couple of his letters backwards when hand writing on paper.  Recently he needed to write something at a gathering we were at, and he ran over to me and whispered &quot;Which way does the j dip again?&quot;  I showed him in the air and told him to the left.  He also writes almost all in capital letters.  He says it&#39;s easier.  <br/>
<br/>
Ethan and I were in a bookstore a while ago and I looked at a novel for young people that was entirely written using text language.  I thought it was clever.  It was called ttyl.  Here&#39;s a link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ttyl-Lauren-Myracle/dp/0810987880/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1387914900&sr=8-2&keywords=ttyl">http://www.amazon.com/Ttyl-Lauren-Myracle/dp/0810987880/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1387914900&sr=8-2&keywords=ttyl</a><br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t buy the book, but when we went home Ethan started communicating all in acronyms.  I&#39;ll tell ya...that takes some skill and focus!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Look around you.  People are communicating today in a great variety of ways.  Play with some of them with your son if he welcomes that.  Keep it fun and light.  <br/>

But be ready to accept that he might not always want that kind of information.&nbsp;<br><br>Mo went through a long stage of writing with her own spellings for words, when she wrote at all, which wasn&#39;t terribly often. She sometimes broke up words in odd places, and went through a (fairly common) period of separating words with a dot and otherwise not using punctuation. Sometimes, seemingly at random, she&#39;d ask me how to spell a word. It always kind of surprised me because for the most part she didn&#39;t like that kind of feedback - she wanted to write, and spelling wasn&#39;t all that important. Over time, her spelling got better in tiny increments until she really started writing for her own purposes - writing game walkthroughs and reviews and fan fiction, where things like spelling and punctuation matter. But that was Years after she started reading - like six years, not one or two.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div>

They show that he understands the Principles of word formation very well, he just doesn&#39;t have the details yet. He knows that letters stand for sounds and he&#39;s using the names of the letters as a guide to the sounds. Think about that. Say &quot;y&quot; - it makes a &quot;w&quot; sound: &quot;why&quot;. So it&#39;s a logical choice. Say &quot;i&quot;. Do you see what I mean? He&#39;s making thoughtful choices! And for the most part they work - you can figure out what he&#39;s trying to say by &quot;sounding out&quot; what he has written.</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.333333015441895px;">Since he&#39;s reading he&#39;s not oblivious to the fact that words are spelled oddly - he can see that, but it&#39;s a huge amount of information to hold in his head all at once so he&#39;s relying on logic for now. It&#39;s&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">going to take him some time to discover when his logic works and when it doesn&#39;t.
