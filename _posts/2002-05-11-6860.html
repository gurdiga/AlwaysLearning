<div id="ygrps-yiv-32443265">... for the Confusion and mis-post.<br/>
<br/>
Re. SC diploma bill.<br/>
<br/>
I had 2 forwards from Kelly and confused the sites of<br/>
origin.<br/>
<br/>
She just sent me Sandra&#39;s response to my mis-post.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll leave messed-up-enough alone.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s interested can see the issue at<br/>
unschooling.com- or so I have been told.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t always have time to read every<br/>
post at the homeschooling sites I belong to.  They can<br/>
number in the hundreds on any given day and Life takes<br/>
precedence here.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly and I depend on each other to send on those we<br/>
think will be of particular interest to each other ...<br/>
 I just missed the correct site.<br/>
<br/>
Again, please forgive my mis-placed post.<br/>
<br/>
