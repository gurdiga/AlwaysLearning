 </span></blockquote>Well, for me, it&#39;s my daughter&#39;s experience in the public school<br/>
(Kindergarten) that prompted me to SERIOUSLY consider pulling <br/>
her out.  Except for spending time with her friends, she&#39;s BORED<br/>
all the time.  I guess it took from Sept until December for us both <br/>
to realize that public school was NOT the place to be.  And also, <br/>
I have several friends online who unschool and I was intrigued with<br/>
that and figured the best place to learn more about homeschooling<br/>
and unschooling was to join some lists.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
BTW,,,,Thursday is Laura&#39;s last day in public school.  My daughter <br/>
is excited to be starting unschooling, but kind of sad that she won&#39;t <br/>
be able to spend time every day with the friends she&#39;s made at the <br/>
public school.  There are two girls especially that she will miss a <br/>
lot.  I&#39;m going to be sending a couple of notes with her to school <br/>
tomorrow to give to their Moms in the hopes that we can set up <br/>
times for the girls to get together before or after school (they go <br/>
to PM Kinder).<br/>
<br/>
Also, we were supposed to be moving to Seattle this week to <br/>
the shared living house,,,but the underwriters messed things up<br/>
and so everything has been put on hold until my friends who are<br/>
buying the house can find a new bank and start the process all<br/>
over again.  Ugh!  We were sooo looking forward to moving into<br/>
the house and getting on with life instead of living in limbo.  The<br/>
girls can&#39;t even jump up and down or run around happily (during <br/>
the day) in our apartment without the downstairs neighbors <br/>
getting all upset and banging on their ceiling.  <br/>

I&#39;ve found myself deleting my unschooling.com digests<br/>
unread recently, but not any of the AlwaysLearning<br/>

I guess that says something right there and that&#39;s from <br/>
a newbie who has no clue.  :-)<br/>

stir up trouble over there anyway?  <br/>

&gt; I&#39;m glad there are a few other voices so I&#39;m not alone. I questioned <br/>
&gt; a person that said something about if her child &quot;got behind&quot; she <br/>
&gt; would do something about it.<br/>
&gt; Sheesh. <br/>
&gt; When I called that view into question, against the views of <br/>
&gt; unschooling, it started the whole mud slinging battle again.<br/>
&gt; What an idiot I am to think that someone over there could be <br/>
&gt; questioned and actually give some thoughtful answers without feeling <br/>
&gt; attacked.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t believe the fallout from my post.<br/>
&gt; I should know better. But like you I can not stomache the thought <br/>
&gt; of &quot;do whatever works for your family&quot;<br/>
&gt; Why even have Unschooling as a concept if we&#39;re just goint to tell <br/>
&gt; everyone that line of BS.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not right that they&#39;ve ousted the clearest voice on the planet <br/>
&gt; about unschooling (Yes, Sandra)<br/>
&gt; and the voices that have taken over are giving lousy advice to people.<br/>
&gt; Ren<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would any of you hardcore unschoolers who live in WA<br/>
want to join the WAUNSCHOOLERS list and tell me if<br/>
they are *really* unschoolers?  They are talking about <br/>
curriculum books and asking the kids to do a page or <br/>
two in a book every day and trying to figure out ways <br/>
to teach math,,,,&quot;so the kids don&#39;t fall behind&quot;, etc,,, <br/>
<br/>
I joined that list since I live in WA and wanted to learn all<br/>
I can about unschooling,,,,but the list seems more of a <br/>
place to plan and do field trips with other homeschoolers <br/>
than a place to learn about unschooling.  They have set <br/>
times to go to the children&#39;s museum, set times to go to<br/>
a thing in Renton called FLIGHT (FLIGHT means Families <br/>
Learning In God&#39;s Honor Together. It is a very large <br/>
homeschooling co-op comprising some 180+ families <br/>
representing more than 30 churches/faiths etc.  They <br/>
go there, separate the kids by age and then send them <br/>
off to classrooms to do age appropriate activities),,,etc <br/>
It all seems very scheduled and not very *unschool* like<br/>
to me.  One newbie to the group got slammed on the <br/>
list for questioning FLIGHT and saying it didn&#39;t sound <br/>
like unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The owner of the list even said that she thinks society <br/>
would crumble to pieces without public school!  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be questioning any of this if their name was <br/>
WAHomeschoolers or WAFieldTripsforHomeschoolers, <br/>
but their name is WAUNSCHOOLERS! (so it seems kind<br/>
of misleading).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;m still new to all this, so maybe<br/>
I&#39;m not informed enough about unschooling to make<br/>
comments about something not seeming very<br/>
unschooling-like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;ve got a lot, already figured out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering how someone like you,(or me 5 years ago) can read about <br/>
unschooling and pretty much figure out right from the get go, that <br/>
some things just don&#39;t fit into it&#39;s realm, yet there are entire <br/>
groups out there using the name, and still schooling their children.<br/>
It&#39;s a mystery!<br/>
I&#39;m also wondering how harmful it is, to unschooling, that there are <br/>
groups like these.  It&#39;s annoying , yes, but will people be mislead <br/>
to what unschooling really can be, by these groups or individuals who <br/>
call themselves unschoolers but are not.  Or are those people( who do <br/>
get &quot;mislead&quot;), just ones that would never have come to unschooling <br/>
anyway.  <br/>
Just pondering.<br/>
