I found this on ticks:<br/>
<br/>
Tick Repellant<br/>
by Annie Berthold-Bond<br/>
<br/>
I dug deep in my herbal formula books for this recipe out of desperation,<br/>
given that I live in the epicenter of the tick-generated Lyme disease<br/>
epidemic. I tested the essential oil that is recommended for ticks, Rose<br/>
Geranium, by putting a few drops-no more!- on our dogs&#39; collars, to see if<br/>
it would repel ticks. Lo and behold, we went from 20 ticks a day on each<br/>
dog, to none. The second best essential oil for repelling ticks is American<br/>
Pennyroyal (also called tickweed).<br/>
<br/>
Simple Solution:<br/>
<br/>
2 tablespoons vegetable or nut oil (almond oil contains sulfur, a repellent<br/>
in its own right)<br/>
10 to 25 drops Rose Geranium essential oil<br/>
Combine the ingredients in a glass jar; shake to blend.<br/>
Makes: 2 tablespoons<br/>
Shelf Life: 6 months<br/>
<br/>
Dab a few drops on your skin or clothing, making sure to avoid eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Caution<br/>
Skip the Pennyroyal if there is anyone pregnant (including pets) in the<br/>
home, as it can induce miscarriage. And as always, use essential oils with<br/>
caution as they can burn the skin and harm eyes. Don&#39;t use these essential<br/>
oils around cats.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A word of caution.  Pennyroyal oil (if you can even find it) should <br/>
never, ever be used on humans or animals.  It is an extremely <br/>
toxic oil.  You can, however, plant Pennyroyal all around the <br/>
edges of your garden to help repel ticks.<br/>

This works great.  For kids, I would stick to the 10 drops per 2 <br/>
tablespoons ratio though.  Also test on a small patch of skin first, <br/>
just to make sure that he doesn&#39;t have a reaction to it.<br/>
