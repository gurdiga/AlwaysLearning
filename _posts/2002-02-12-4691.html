<div id="ygrps-yiv-194145251">Good point about talking about what we don&#39;t do in unschooling a lot. So, I <br/>
propose a thread where we talk about the cool things we&#39;re DOING.<br/>
<br/>
This coming weekend I am taking my 12 year old son to the 24 hour Science <br/>
Fiction Film marathon in Boston. (Web site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mv.com/org/sf27/)">http://www.mv.com/org/sf27/)</a>  I <br/>
went once when I was in college.  We spent some time yesterday looking at the <br/>
web site, which has a great Discussion Board. We read the threads about what <br/>
to take, and started a list of our own. We decided we wanted to get there <br/>
early so we could get decent seats, but we didn&#39;t want to send the night <br/>
outside in the cold. We looked over the movies titles, and checked out <br/>
descriptions. He is SO excited!  (Me too.)<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, his father wouldn&#39;t consider this &quot;educational,&quot; even though he <br/>
thinks it&#39;s great we&#39;re doing it. We&#39;re having lots of conflicts about <br/>
unschooling, because he thinks Julian should be actively engaged in academics <br/>
6 hours or more a day. He won&#39;t read anything about unschooling.  Argh... <br/>
Sorry, this turned into a venting session.  Juls is doing SO well, and his <br/>
dad just doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>

That is cool.<br/>
My kids were watching  an old episodes of the Twilight Zone the other <br/>
day.  They are 11 and 8 and had never seen it before.  We had gone on <br/>
the Tower of Terror at Disney this fall, so they knew the name, and <br/>
the voice of Rod Sterling.<br/>
They loved it.  It was  about a guy on a wagon train with a dying son <br/>
who went to look for water and was transported to present day 1960&#39;s.<br/>
He ended up meeting people in a small desert town and learning about <br/>
modern medicine and getting some for his son and going back.  <br/>
Ofcoarse all the people in town thought he was crazy.<br/>
Anyway, that is stuff i consider &quot;educational&quot;.  I now get that same <br/>
feeling I use to get when they would work in a workbook a few years <br/>
ago, when they are doing things that are just *cool*.  I can&#39;t help <br/>
but think that some things are just really good to come across. (the <br/>
workbooks aren&#39;t on that list anymore).  <br/>
I have a friend that is in charge of the childrens theater(adult <br/>
college students, doing childrens theater) at our local university.  <br/>
We just went and saw her production of &quot;The Prince, the Pig and the <br/>
Peevish Princess&quot;  I believe the playbill said it was first played in <br/>
new Mexico and some Shakespeare theater.  It was hilarious!!<br/>
My kids are also in a childrens theater program and they are now <br/>
doing The Wizard of OZ.  I&#39;m in charge of costumes with another lady <br/>
and have been making the monkey costumes latley. My dd is a <br/>
munchkin.  She got the part of &#39;city father #1&#39;, but being the <br/>
feminist that she is, persuaded them to let her be a city mother.  <br/>
She has to say the &quot;morally, ethically, ....&quot;line.  My ds is a common <br/>
munchkin who has to sing and dance and he&#39;s a flying monkey.  It&#39;s <br/>
his first production, and my daughters 7th or 8th. (she loves <br/>
theater).  I also have a 5 and 2 yo.  They&#39;ve been getting some <br/>
pretty good daddy bonding time, with us being so busy with rehearsals <br/>
and costume making.<br/>
Anyway, that is some of the stuff we *do*.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right now *we* aren&#39;t doing anything.  My 14 yo is working full time with <br/>
his dad for a few weeks  (making more than I could *ever* make).  In his <br/>
free time, he&#39;s building mountain bike trails and jumps, building a new <br/>
bike from the frame up, playing soccer, getting ready for baseball season, <br/>
learning about photography and learning how to use Adobe Photoshop, <br/>
watching TV, surfing the mountain bike web sites, downloading music.  The <br/>
only one of those that I&#39;m interested in knowing more about is the <br/>
photography and Photoshop stuff.<br/>
<br/>
He did ask about making web sites the other day.  I told him I could show <br/>
him the basics, and how to learn from other people&#39;s sites, and that he <br/>
needed to think about what he might want to put on his site.  We&#39;ll see if <br/>
that goes any farther.  I hope it does.  I&#39;ve always had trouble finding <br/>
areas we were both interested in.  Oh, and he&#39;s started letting me read to <br/>
him again, over the last few months.  I really missed that.  We&#39;re doing <br/>
The Lord of the Rings again.  He doesn&#39;t remember any of it, because I read <br/>
it to him when he was 6 or 7.<br/>
