<div id="ygrps-yiv-385526680">So I was wondering Sandra when are you going to be in IL talking <br/>
about &quot;strewing&quot; and what exactly does that entail? I was going to <br/>
try and make it but my plans clashed with hubby&#39;s motorcycle run so <br/>
I gracefully decided to let him have this one. Also I would love <br/>
anyone&#39;s input on the Taking Children Seriously, I have been reading <br/>
some of the website and Jan Fortune-Wood&#39;s books and they&#39;re very <br/>
interesting. Thanks for your input - Moza</div>

&gt;I have been reading some of the website and Jan Fortune-Wood&#39;s books...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was intrigued with the website, haven&#39;t read any books about it, and a<br/>
few years ago participated in several email lists where TCS was discussed<br/>
quite often (one of which was the TCS list.)  When I&#39;m really present in my<br/>
life, I try to &quot;take seriously&quot; anyone that I relate to... so for me I like<br/>
the basic message.  But I do have some input about my own experience while<br/>
on these other lists.  Basically, the reason I didn&#39;t stick with the TCS<br/>
movement is because most of the discussions included too many &quot;what if&quot;<br/>
scenarios to make a point that things should be done this certain way.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this happen on the unschooling lists too, but usually folks who<br/>
have been doing the unschooling for awhile sit on the side of real life<br/>
examples.  That wasn&#39;t my experience with TCS - I found that some of the<br/>
long time and more vocal TCS proponents were the worst at bringing up<br/>
imaginary examples to support their cause.  With that said, I am not saying<br/>
that the TCS ideals promote this view, or that everyone subscribing to TCS<br/>
promotes it, or whatever..... it just came up too often on the lists for me<br/>
to stick with it.  Your mileage may vary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I remember not long ago Sandra mentioning something about TCS on this<br/>
(or another list)... so I expect she will also have some valuable input.<br/>
<br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
The reason they won&#39;t use real-life examples is because they think it&#39;s  <br/>
wrong to talk about their own children.  It IS part of the philosophy to  not use <br/>
real-life examples.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think Sandra is going to want to talk about TCS here, though.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, and probably Anna will speak up as well, I find the TCS site <br/>
confusing, actually more the web e list.  I understand the reasoning behind not <br/>
talking about people, not using their names etc.  But in talking about people <br/>
like examples I find it hard to follow and it really doesn&#39;t allow you to ask <br/>
questions to get a better understanding of what the person is talking about.  I <br/>
read most of the articles on the web site and found that I couldn&#39;t follow <br/>
them well either and couldn&#39;t get a good grip on what exactly the position or <br/>
point was.<br/>
<br/>
Now I think Jan Fortune Wood is great.  Love her site.  We work here with <br/>
common preference, mutually agreed on solutions and fostering the autonomy of the <br/>
individual.  I do believe that each individual knows best what is right for <br/>
him or her, even children.  I might know what I think is best for my boys but <br/>
only they know what IS right for them at this particular moment in time.  I <br/>
also believe that we all make mistakes and we can all change our minds as well.  <br/>
JFW spoke at the Rethinking Education conference, I couldn&#39;t go, but have <br/>
listened to the tapes of her sessions and they were great.  <br/>
<br/>
If you like JFW you might like the Nonviolent Communication stuff as well.  <br/>
There is an article on that web site that I love <br/>

I am reading through Rosenberg&#39;s books right now.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts on the subject.<br/>

<br/>
I LOVE JFW! I went half way across the country just to hear her speak at<br/>
the Rethinking Ed. Conf. and she was great!  Her approach to consensual<br/>
living is really important to me and my family.   Unschooling is really an<br/>
off shoot of that kind of larger philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a TCS fan, not because of the principles but its administration and<br/>
delivery.  JFW does not come across the same way.  She is easy to<br/>
understand and very approachable.  She has books on the subject too.<br/>

frankly, my dh and I thought she was boring.  I<br/>
probably would have gotten more out of it by just<br/>
buying the audio tape, but to watch her sit and listen<br/>
to her READ for two hours was a little much.  The<br/>
information she was sharing was GREAT, but it was her<br/>
presentation skills that I had difficulty with. At<br/>
least at her second session, she took a couple<br/>
questions.  That was the part I liked best. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s true, and there are people in the larger homeschooling community who <br/>
are cranky about that idea of living a different kind of life.  There are <br/>
people from time to time who try to shush those who say learning doesn&#39;t stop with <br/>
school subjects, and that there might really be something transforming in <br/>
giving children the freedom to choose how they live.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling as a lifestyle is hooted at by some who just want unschooling as <br/>
a homeschooling style, with no other change in attitude or parenting.<br/>

I sometimes dread Q&A sessions at conferences, because they take high energy <br/>
down sometimes.  Not always.  But I much prefer questions written down so they <br/>
can be grouped and addressed in sets and some can be bypassed for not being <br/>
interesting enough for the 40 or 100 people who would sit through the answer.<br/>

It seems like there&#39;s always some high-need person there, as well, who  can&#39;t <br/>
be satisfied with the original answer and needs to ask follow-ups and get  <br/>
into specifics while wasting the time of a large number of people.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s why I appreciated the way Marty Layne did a session once, writing  <br/>
down all the questions and having everyone vote on their top three.  Then  she <br/>
answered/discussed them in order of which got the most votes.  Wouldn&#39;t  work <br/>
for all topics or all speakers, but I liked it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883559607">I also saw/heard JFW at the RE conference in May.  I agree with what she had to say and enjoyed the discussion that followed, but I have to say I was a little disappointed that she read her talk.  It&#39;s one thing to work with notes, but to have someone read verbatim I&#39;m not really crazy about.  Just something to know if you go to see her speak. If that kind of thing bothers you, you may have to work to separate her ideas from her presentation.<br/>

I LOVE JFW! I went half way across the country just to hear her speak at the Rethinking Ed. Conf. and she was great!  Her approach to consensual living is really important to me and my family. <br/>
