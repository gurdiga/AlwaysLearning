&gt; still on the list.  Zena still talks about Japanese silky Bantam<br/>
&gt; chickens! LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Take care!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi there.. nice to find you again.. we had a major computer crash a few<br/>
months ago and I lost my email addresses and everything else I had<br/>
saved..bummer. Anyway, I still have a few Silkies, but I&#39;m actually thinking<br/>
of selling them all this year (or finding them a good home) I have a lot<br/>
more Standard size chickens now, starting a small egg business..I also<br/>
bought a a couple of White Peking Ducks this Spring... Still hoping you all<br/>
get a chance to take that road trip and come for a visit sometime!<br/>
