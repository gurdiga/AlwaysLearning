Most of that has quite another focus than unschooling has.   <br/>
Unschooling would fit in as a small part, but that doesn&#39;t make it  <br/>
&quot;an unschooling conference.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184279139">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I understand how it may appear on the surface to be a misleading statement<br/>
to call it an unschooling conference as well as an alternative education<br/>
conference, but I still view it as such...which should be explained.<br/>
<br/>
First, let me address your comment on &quot;most of the content having quite<br/>
another focus and unschooling having only a small part,&quot; because I disagree<br/>
with that statement.  The keynote panel discussion very much is on focus as<br/>
the discussion will be had between 10 panelists (one of which is<br/>
representing unschooling, while the 9 others are representing different<br/>
models of education) which will be having an open dialog with the audience<br/>
about the commonalities and differences between all the different types of<br/>
alternatives and what everyone can learn from each other.  Also 2 of<br/>
our featured keynoter speakers (Gatto and Farenga) are full on unschooling<br/>
advocates, while Mintz promotes unschooling quite heavily, but also promotes<br/>
democratic schools, which may carry the stigma of the word school,<br/>
but they&#39;re places where unschoolers are getting together under the umbrella<br/>
of a school (I was one who attended a democratic school and then spent a<br/>
number of years unschooling and I lived my life and directed my own<br/>
education in the same way whether I was technically enrolled in the<br/>
democratic school or technically unschooling). Our other keynote speaker<br/>
Sadofsky is speaking on democratic schools as well.  The communities<br/>
workshop series is sponsored by a 501(c)(3) decentralist education group<br/>
called the School of Living (not a school, just a name) which is running<br/>
workshops on drawing, songwriting, permaculture and fun things of that<br/>
nature.  Student (which is synonymous with youth for our purposes) Film<br/>
Festival and Speakers....well that certainly applies...Two of our student<br/>
essay contest winners who will be speaking are unschoolers in a addition to<br/>
a couple of our panelists, while the film festival will include student made<br/>
films from unschoolers and alternative schoolers alike.  It&#39;s also worth<br/>
mentioning that our student events coordinator is an unschooler too.  You&#39;re<br/>
right about the documentaries not applying directly to unschooling (only a<br/>
few short ones though).  Also, the &quot;school&quot; starters workshop series is a<br/>
workshop series for anyone trying to create any kind of school OR<br/>
learning/resource center...the latter def. applies...Overall, I think your<br/>
statement is factual in that the content of the majority of our sessions is<br/>
not 100% specific to unschooling.  However, I would add that the vast<br/>
majority of our sessions are very pertinent to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My main reason for feeling quite justified in calling this an unschooling<br/>
conference is because of the way in which it&#39;s run.  I started organizing<br/>
the event three years back while unschooling and wanted it to have the same<br/>
feel and process as my education.  I felt that the conference should allow<br/>
as close to as much freedom as I experience in my education as possible.<br/>
The workshops are run through open space technology where everyone young and<br/>
old has the right to host a workshop on whatever topic they want.  They have<br/>
the freedom to then run that workshop in the best way that they see fit.<br/>
Because of this, I feel the conference lives and breathes unschooling.<br/>
While not every workshop is specifically focused on unschooling, you&#39;d be<br/>
very hard pressed to find any that don&#39;t involve unschooling!  You also have<br/>
a minimum of 6 workshops that are held simultaneously, so even if one<br/>
doesn&#39;t involve unschooling, you&#39;ve got more than enough that do!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope this provides a little background into my reasoning for calling it an<br/>
unschooling conference.  My point in writing all that I wrote is not to<br/>
drive my opinion (which it is and I&#39;m sure others will still disagree) in<br/>
the ground, but to provide what I felt was the necessary amount of context<br/>
to understanding my thinking.  I&#39;d be interested to hear what you think now<br/>
having a little more information on it.   And hey, there&#39;s lots still plenty<br/>
of pre-conference presentation slots left to schedule, so if you have any<br/>
interest in coming out we&#39;d love to have you!  It&#39;s worth noting that we<br/>
don&#39;t turn anyone away from the event based solely on financial reasons.  We<br/>
always have room to work out scholarships and/or work exchanges for the<br/>
conference fees.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve been to unschooling conferences. &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;re not about creating  <br/>

It was a minor objection, honestly.  A clarification.  I have nothing  <br/>
whatsoever against school reform and alternative education.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
just the same, though, as the unschooling families do at home with  <br/>
their own kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372025956">Hi again,<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;I doubt that on Waldorf and Montessori lists you called it an unschooling<br/>
conference.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
Right.  I don&#39;t call it an unschooling conference on those lists.  I focus<br/>
on AWSNA&#39;s sponsorship when mentioning it to Waldorf folks and The<br/>
Montessori Foundation and Int&#39;l Mont. Council&#39;s when mentioning it to<br/>
Montessori folks.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Calling it an alternative education conference would&#39;ve been fine.<br/>
*<br/>
I hear you.  I think after hearing your concerns, I would refer to it in<br/>
different terms on this list next time (although I won&#39;t be sending out<br/>
another thing about it until about this time next year for the 4th annual<br/>
conf!<br/>
***<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been to unschooling conferences. &lt;g&gt;  They&#39;re not about creating<br/>
schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
* Creating schools and learning centers/communities is only an element of<br/>
our conference, not the focus.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;I know unschooling&#39;s a broad concept, and that there IS an unschooling<br/>
thread through the conference topics, but my objection was that it seemed to<br/>
be being billed as &quot;an unschooling conference&quot; for the purpose of this<br/>
unschooling list.&quot;<br/>
*<br/>
You&#39;re right.  I did put the subject as &quot;June Unschooling Conference&quot; for<br/>
the purpose of hoping to raise an extra eyebrow.  And I put it out in a<br/>
different way to each list I post it too.  However, I wouldn&#39;t claim it to<br/>
be a Montessori conference or Waldorf conference.  Unschooling,<br/>
Homeschooling, and Democratic Education were the only ones that I felt<br/>
applied out of all the alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;It was a minor objection, honestly.  A clarification.  I have nothing<br/>
whatsoever against school reform and alternative education. It&#39;s not just<br/>
the same, though, as the unschooling families do at home with their own<br/>
kids.&quot;<br/>
*<br/>
Certainly after hearing your concerns, I am more than happy to refer to it<br/>
in a different way as my goal was not to be misleading.  However your<br/>
comment about unschooling not being the same struck a cord with me.  While<br/>
unschooling is certainly not the same as school reform, it is a very real<br/>
and valued form alternative education.  Alternative education encompasses<br/>
alternatives (see the cover of our packet for a visual example of this:<br/>
www.edrev.org/packet.html ).  I also think it&#39;s worth making connections as<br/>
unschoolers to the freedom-based democratic schools.  The similarities in<br/>
not only philosophy, but daily approach to education is indecipherable most<br/>
of the time.  That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t differences, as that line of<br/>
thinking would be naive, but countless commonalities are worth paying<br/>
attention to and learning from each other.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
