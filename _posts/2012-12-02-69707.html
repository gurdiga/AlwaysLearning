<br/>
The count from yahoogroups is 4408.<br/>
It&#39;s okay not to leave our monthly reminder at &quot;over two thousand.&quot;  That&#39;s still true.  And probably 1,000 of those members got what they came for and don&#39;t read anymore, or have changed e-mail addresses and forgot how to get here.<br/>
<br/>
Even if we only had one thousand, though, it&#39;s better to think before posting whether it will be potentially beneficial to hundreds of people to read what you&#39;re writing.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-﻿Posts for the Always Learning list need to fulfill at least one of these criteria:<br/>
<br/>
-helps lots of people understand unschooling<br/>

<br/>
That means asking and answering questions is GOOD! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Bringing a link to an article or video or book might be good IF the item will help unschoolers, and IF the poster explains why she/he believes it will be helpful.  So don&#39;t drop an un-introduced link.  That&#39;s not cool.  Tell us the good parts and what got you excited about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being here!<br/>
