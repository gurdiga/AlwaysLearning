<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014667820">&quot;the history and cause of restrictions concerning women&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THERE is a monumental, international, topic.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to ignore most of it (and we have no choice but to ignore  <br/>
most of it, really, because it&#39;s just too big, but some definitely  <br/>
applies to learning), but for one small aspect, there is the question  <br/>
of &quot;gossip.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nancy Wooton wrote the other day on this list:<br/>
-=-I think email is, for us 21st century women, the chat with the  <br/>
neighbor<br/>
over the fence while you hung your laundry on the line, or the cup of<br/>
coffee my mom always poured in the afternoon for the neighbor from<br/>
across the street, or the gathering of women at the stream to beat<br/>
clothes on rocks. It&#39;s how we connect. We&#39;ve just expanded the<br/>
neighborhood ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There has for generations been a great badmouthing of women&#39;s  <br/>
communications, especially by men.  Some men have tried to forbid  <br/>
their wives from hanging out with other women.  Some have succeeded.   <br/>
Some still do.<br/>
<br/>
WHY?  Why the big prejudice against women&#39;s communications?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not valued.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make money.<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;industry&quot;; they&#39;re not &quot;being productive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Productivity&quot; can be a big sin.  Both my grandmothers crocheted me  <br/>
hideous long vests in the 60&#39;s because they saw in some magazine that  <br/>
teenaged girls somewhere liked them.  It wasn&#39;t in northern New  <br/>
Mexico.  I threw them away just a couple of months ago, because the  <br/>
box they had been stuck in for 30 years got mice.  And one had  <br/>
aluminum or light steel decorative hook fasteners (they weren&#39;t  <br/>
rusty, so...)... so it couldn&#39;t have been washed anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Women LEARN from other women, from talking about childbirth, cooking,  <br/>
yardwork, divorce (what to avoid, who&#39;s to be trusted), and they get  <br/>
news of changes in policies and politics, though it won&#39;t sound the  <br/>
way the men talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to go into all the gory stories we can all think of  <br/>
about women being repressed.  I want to make the point that unless we  <br/>
look at it at least a little, we&#39;re in danger of repressing our  <br/>
children the same way.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly gets off MySpace, she *knows* things.  She knows who&#39;s  <br/>
getting alone how with whom, in an extended network of friends.  She  <br/>
knows who&#39;s moving, coming home, depressed, has a new job, learned a  <br/>
new Photoshop trick, or some new html programming.  She knows who&#39;s  <br/>
got a haircut or new color.  I could brand that all worthless and non- <br/>
productive, but I&#39;m not going to.<br/>
<br/>
My husband could say that all the time I spend writing e-mails like  <br/>
this is non-productive and wasteful.  Maybe he&#39;d rather I fix those  <br/>
grey shorts that are in the den and put away the laundry.  (Probably!  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;)   But he knows it&#39;s not wasteful, and he knows philosophical  <br/>
discussions are good for people&#39;s mental health and growth and  <br/>
integrity.<br/>
