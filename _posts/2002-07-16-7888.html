<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567900035">Dear Pam,<br/>
<br/>
What a great way to make the points.<br/>
<br/>
THIS is the kind of poster I&#39;d love to know is<br/>
adorning the space between bordettes on Emglish class<br/>
room bulletin boards.<br/>
<br/>
As for the appreciation of study of rules of writing. <br/>
I am 100% in favor of everyone delighting in immersing<br/>
themselves in whatever subject matter stirs their<br/>
inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
What I  object to is the  mandatory, coerced and<br/>
pointless wholesaling of it to a captive audience.<br/>
<br/>
I spent 2 years in public school classrooms as a Full<br/>
time substitute teacher in a very large metropolitan<br/>
school system.  That experience allowed me the view<br/>
from the other side.  I got to sample what a day is<br/>
like in more than a dozen of the schools in the<br/>
system.  k-12.  All parts of town.   Subjects from Art<br/>
to Math and Vocational EMS.   <br/>
<br/>
I became a preferred sub in several schools.  Despite<br/>
my lack of an education degree, I was requested as a<br/>
long-term sub on many occasions.  A request that<br/>
required the principal signing off on it as my Masters<br/>
in Communications made me less desirable than those<br/>
with Bachelors that included training in classroom<br/>
management and other techniques mandatory for<br/>
certification.<br/>
<br/>
I have very mixed feelings re. my experiences over<br/>
those 2 years.  I know that part of what made me<br/>
in-demand  was the ability to &quot;control&quot;   the<br/>
classroom.  To &quot;produce&quot;.  To fulfill the requirements<br/>
in the teachers planning book for the day.  To keep<br/>
order.  To prevent fighting, etc....<br/>
<br/>
The comments from students who I&#39;d had previously as<br/>
they see me in their doorway, &quot;Oh man, it&#39;s Ms. Nolan<br/>
...  she&#39;s gonna make us work.&quot; .....  Gave me a sense<br/>
of satisfaction back then.  I knew it meant I had<br/>
established the kind of reputation that the teachers<br/>
and school administrators appreciated.  No nonsense.  <br/>
<br/>
Now..............   Blech!<br/>
<br/>
I was often nothing more than a crowd control officer.<br/>
 Force feeding them their daily rations of gruel.  (As<br/>
in grueling.)<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make it pleasant.  To make the day&#39;s<br/>
mandatory information as palatable and personally<br/>
relevant as possible.  But much of the material is<br/>
just not Interesting or meaningful.<br/>
<br/>
I also found that when I tried to show some respect<br/>
for students ....  give them the benefit of the doubt<br/>
....   offer some trust, that I was regularly put back<br/>
into my place and criticized by the &quot;real&quot; teachers.  <br/>
&quot; WE don&#39;t allow them to take a bathroom break before<br/>
10.  It&#39;s in your Sub notes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Blech and double blech.<br/>
<br/>
How much more humiliation can we put kids through? <br/>
Requiring that their bladders snap to it and stay on<br/>
schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Too close to &quot;keep the trains moving on time.&quot;   for<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
It was those experiences, and many more too numerous<br/>
to mention here, that cemented my homeschooling<br/>
tendency and turned me into a full blown Unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
And of course my own 12 years in the same system as a<br/>
student.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand the fulfillment in teaching what you<br/>
love.  I had what was for me a Great Assignment near<br/>
the end of that second year. A teacher took leave to<br/>
care for her dying mother.  She requested me as I had<br/>
been with the students a few times before.  It was at<br/>
a magnet high school; the best in the system by my<br/>
estimation and by those who measure such things by<br/>
National Merit Scholars, etc....<br/>
<br/>
Though it&#39;s public, application and admission is<br/>
required.  It also serves the school for the<br/>
performing arts.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I found myself teaching &quot;Our Town&quot;.  My<br/>
undergraduate is in Theatre.  Master&#39;s emphasis is<br/>
Theatre and Radio-Television.  I was in heaven.  (Oh<br/>
yeah, I played Emily in college too.)   Knew it<br/>
backward and forward.  We discussed Thornton Wilder,<br/>
what makes it a &quot;Great American play&quot;,  The time<br/>
period, etc.......   We watched the Robby<br/>
Benson/Glynnis O&#39;Connor version, which I also adore. <br/>
The teaching was thorough and, with very few<br/>
exceptions,  they all did well on the tests.  It left<br/>
me thinking that maybe I would do the year program<br/>
currently offered by U of L that allowed grads to<br/>
become accredited to teach in 15 months.<br/>
<br/>
When I came down from the experience, I realized what<br/>
I had always known; that all of the &quot;have-to&#39;s were<br/>
not OK with me.<br/>
<br/>
When I think back on it now, i am glad that I gave<br/>
them what was probably a Superior experience than what<br/>
their real teacher would have.  Because my Passion for<br/>
it came through.   But I also know that there were<br/>
kids in that class who were most likely bored and<br/>
resentful at having to learn about something they had<br/>
no real interest in.  And I doubt that that coerced<br/>
requirement, even with my glorying in it,  lead them<br/>
to Appreciate the American theater or Thornton Wilder<br/>
or theater in general.<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways to learn the basics of any<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
As far as that goes, the real excitement is in doing<br/>
it a way that no one ever has before.  Language is no<br/>
more concrete than most other subjects.  Even &quot;hard<br/>
science&quot; gets turned on its head on a fairly regular<br/>
basis.  And usually by someone who has tuned out to<br/>
the rules and discovered a new path.<br/>
<br/>
I am less and less appreciative of the step1, step, 2,<br/>
step 3... approach.  Interested learners will come to<br/>
the knowledge they  need to produce what they desire<br/>
when the time is right.<br/>
<br/>
That is Unschooling for me.  <br/>

&gt; This is from another list -- I thought it good<br/>
&gt; timing for our discussion <br/>
&gt; here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pam<br/>
&gt; ----------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Rules for Writing<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;1. Always avoid alliteration.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences<br/>
&gt; with.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3. Avoid cliches like the plague.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;4. Employ the vernacular.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are<br/>
&gt; unnecessary.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;8. Contractions aren&#39;t necessary.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;10. One should never generalize.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;11. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson<br/>
&gt; once said: &quot;I hate<br/>
&gt; &gt;quotations. Tell me what you know.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;13. Don&#39;t be redundant and don&#39;t use more words<br/>
&gt; than necessary because<br/>
&gt; &gt;it&#39;s highly superfluous.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;14. Profanity sucks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;15. Be more or less specific.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;16. Understatement is always best.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than<br/>
&gt; understatement.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a<br/>
&gt; snake.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;20. The passive voice is to be avoided.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid<br/>
&gt; colloquialisms.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be<br/>
&gt; derailed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;23. Who needs rhetorical questions?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;24. Sentences without verbs--bad idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;25. Avoid run-on sentences they are hard to read.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;26. Don&#39;t use no double negatives.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;27. Verbs has to agree with their subjects.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;28. Avoid commas, that are not necessary.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;29. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially<br/>
&gt; in long<br/>
&gt; &gt;sentences--such as those of ten or more words--to<br/>
&gt; their antecedents.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;30. Use parallel structure when you write and in<br/>
&gt; speaking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;31. Take the bull in hand and don&#39;t mix metaphors.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;32. Never use a long word when a diminutive one<br/>
&gt; will do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;33. Unless you are quoting other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; exclamations, kill all<br/>
&gt; &gt;exclamation points!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;34. Proofread carefully to see if you any words<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
