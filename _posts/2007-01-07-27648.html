 </span></blockquote>We go by the principle of safety.  All have a right to be and feel <br/>
safe in this place (our home), and if someone feels it&#39;s okay to hit <br/>
someone else, that simply violates the principle of safety.  I only <br/>
have one kid, but we frequently have kids over with their brothers or <br/>
sisters, and I&#39;m really clear with them about that principle of <br/>
safety.  I let them know in a loving way that I&#39;m available for <br/>
helping resolve disputes (and thanks to our little house, I&#39;m always <br/>
within earshot).  I have not had any trouble with this, because <br/>
everyone wants to be safe.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>

Good question! these are what came to my mind, the principle of <br/>
respecting each others person/body. the principle of using non-violence <br/>
to solve conflict...the principle of not hurting others...<br/>
<br/>
 I used to have no problem using the phrase &quot;I will not allow&quot; in some <br/>
situations...especially with situations that pertain to body boundaries. <br/>
My thought was that its good to teach/model saying &quot;I will not allow you <br/>
to hit me&quot; if conflict escalates to that point. I used that phrase often <br/>
when the kids were toddlers and learning to deal with their &quot;big <br/>
feelings&quot;  Maybe a better response would have been  simply &quot;ouch!that <br/>
hurts!  I don&#39;t like it when you hit me&quot; and then give them age <br/>
appropriate suggestions for different ways to handle their anger or <br/>
frustration.  I don&#39;t know...&quot;I won&#39;t allow&quot; could still have a place in <br/>
respectful parenting depending on how its use I guess.<br/>
Even now that my kids are older I&#39;ve found that its good to talk about <br/>
conflict resolution from time to time. Lately we&#39;ve been talking a lot <br/>
about creating some space between stimulus and response. This is a <br/>
biggie for me since I&#39;ve been dealing with irritability lately (killer <br/>
pms? perimenopause? ...I don&#39;t know but its been an issue for me <br/>
lately!) and if I&#39;m not careful my knee-jerk reaction can be to snap out <br/>
with a hurtful remark or attitude.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082402333">&quot;Do unto others as you would have (others) do unto you.&quot;  Rabbi Hillel, <br/>
one of the great Torah scholars of all time (he lived in the 1st <br/>
Century  C.E.) is quoted as saying that the sum of the entire Torah is <br/>
the above phrase, and the rest is commentary (on that phrase). It is the <br/>
basis of not only human moral behavior, but also of much chassidic <br/>
(esoteric Jewish) philosophy. The correct translation from the original <br/>
Hebrew is &quot;Love your fellow as yourself.&quot;  For our kids it could be <br/>
enough to say, &quot;You don&#39;t want to be hit, do you? So don&#39;t hit anyone else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, I think integrating this principle is a lifelong task for all <br/>
of us!<br/>

word the principle that would fill in for &quot;don&#39;t hit&quot;. Can anyone  <br/>

<br/>
When my kids were little I told them that there were people in jail  <br/>
for hitting, and they needed to learn early to control the urge to hit.<br/>
<br/>
I had a deal with my two boys, when they were little and would get  <br/>
into arguments about video games or toys.  There was a process to  <br/>
follow.<br/>
<br/>
First, talk about it.<br/>
Second, get a grownup to help.<br/>
Third, hit.<br/>
<br/>
So if they hit I would say &quot;Did you talk about it?&quot;  And a little  <br/>
over half the time they had.<br/>
&quot;Did you get a grownup&#39;s help?  I was right in the kitchen.&quot;  No.<br/>
Well then you shouldn&#39;t have hit him.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I was helping them see other options, and giving them time to  <br/>
calm down or walk away (even going for help is walking, and yelling  <br/>
for help will involve deep breaths), but partly I was leaving them  <br/>
the hope that if they followed the process they&#39;d still get to hit.<br/>
<br/>
As they got older and Holly was a factor, the third kid would often  <br/>
be the mediator without even anyone asking.  They&#39;ve all become  <br/>
pretty good at offering suggestions to settle other kids&#39;  <br/>
disagreements because of that too.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a short answer, but the principle is solving problems.<br/>

I used to have no problem using the phrase &quot;I will not allow&quot; in some<br/>
situations...especially with situations that pertain to body  <br/>
boundaries. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  We have another arrangement here, from years back.  I told Holly  <br/>
that she can&#39;t hit Marty in his own home, that he needs to be safe in  <br/>
his own home.  Also I told her she needed to wait until she&#39;s old  <br/>
enough to take responsibility for her own actions, because I won&#39;t  <br/>
let my little girl hit other people that way.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
When Holly is 18 and has her own apartment, she plans to invite Marty  <br/>
over and hit him.<br/>
Marty says he&#39;s not going to Holly&#39;s 18th birthday party.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby are still home, so maybe Holly won&#39;t actually have an  <br/>
apartment when she&#39;s 18 either, and Marty will be safe a while longer.<br/>
<br/>
For those who&#39;ve seen Marty and Holly, you might be thinking she  <br/>
couldn&#39;t do him much damage.  He&#39;s grown up a lot since the original  <br/>
deal was made. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
