<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777169565">I&#39;ve been unschooling with my 11 year old Katy since September.  I&#39;ve been trying my best to provide an environment in which she can recover from her 6 years of public schooling. I won&#39;t go into details, but I think we are on the right path for us and we have been enjoying a peaceful and fun few months. <br/>
<br/>
Now, however I&#39;m facing the dreaded Public School system homeschool evaluation for the first time. Looking at the form which tells me what they expect me to present to them when I come in for evaluation in January, I am getting rather nervous since I have very few samples of her writing and math to show them and no testing or written evaluations. It&#39;s pretty clear and no surprise to me that they expect me to produce evidence of &quot;school at home.&quot; But I have hardly anything that looks like school to show them. I knew this was coming -it&#39;s been on the back of my mind, but I&#39;ve been concentrating on allowing my child (and myself) to deschool and on thinking and reading about unschooling and what may be the best way to encourage her interests and abilities, not on producing a portfolio of busy work to show a school official.  <br/>
<br/>
I imagine this is a rather common concern with unschoolers - especially newbies.  Any suggestions, advice, links to go to for preparing for this evaluation and getting through it with &quot;a passing grade?&quot; I don&#39;t want to stop unschooling and start asking my daughter to do busy work just to pad a portfolio for them  . . . but I am tempted just out of the fear that they won&#39;t let me continue. How do I avoid that and yet give them what they want so they won&#39;t get in my way? I might be able to get through it this time with a slap on the wrist if I don&#39;t have enough stuff to show, but what about next time? Am I anticipating trouble that I probably won&#39;t encounter?</div>

Your best bet is to get information and advice from other unschoolers who <br/>
are local to you, or at least in your State. I have noticed that a lot of <br/>
the time people have the idea that they only have one choice in evaluations, <br/>
but then more research uncovers many further options.<br/>
<br/>
It seems mighty early for any kind of evaluation. Are you sure it&#39;s <br/>
absolutely mandated? Don&#39;t get your information from the DOE or school <br/>
district office - get it from your State home schooling organizations.<br/>
<br/>
Historically most people have ended up taking more along than is needed. <br/>
Most of the time you just have to show progress.<br/>

Where we live, we don&#39;t do any of that stuff, so I can&#39;t speak to that specifically, it might be better to look for a local list and ask how others do it. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>
<br/>
Other than that, here are some other links that you may find helpful.  Really seeing the learning in everything and being able to translate that into educational speak, helps.  Some people find that keeping blogs, like diary entries of what was done and learned, helps when it comes time to do some sort of evaluation.  That is probably what I&#39;d do if I were required to do a porfolio or evaluation.  I&#39;d forget all the cool daily learning otherwise.  I see it and take note of it in my mind, but if I had to go back and remember everything, I don&#39;t think I could... there is just way too much learning happening all the time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892175395">What do you have?  Crafts?<br/>
<br/>
Do you cook together?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the samples you DO have are enough.<br/>
<br/>
What do they expect you to show them?  Is it required?  Do you have a state<br/>
homeschool association that can help you with the details?  They will know<br/>
exactly what is REQUIRED of you.  Do you even have to meet with them, by<br/>
law?<br/>
