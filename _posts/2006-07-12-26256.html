<div id="ygrps-yiv-618217862">Weird Al&#39;s newest song is a parody of James Blunt&#39;s &quot;You&#39;re Beautiful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
James Blunt agreed to the parody.  His record company, though, nixed  <br/>
having on Weird Al&#39;s next album and so in response, it is available  <br/>
free to all comers either at<br/>

<br/>
Holly notes unhappily that you can&#39;t use it for your myspace song,  <br/>
but you can listen to it at his page (although it&#39;s very busy there)  <br/>
or you can download it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry for the double posting.  You can download the song twice, if  <br/>
you want to. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
