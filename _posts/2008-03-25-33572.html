<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112781776">My son was at practice the other day and my husband questioned me<br/>
about how much played video games.  I too, have noticed that he is<br/>
seeming less interested in the games, but for lack of anything better<br/>
to do he turns on the computer.  I told my husband that I thought it<br/>
was my fault and that I had become boring and not so spontaneous.  I&#39;m<br/>
not very good at making like &quot;sparkly&quot; these days.  I was GREAT at it<br/>
when we first started unschooling.  I don&#39;t know what happened.<br/>
<br/>
THEN, proving how in tune our family is, my son comes to me and says<br/>
&quot;Mom, you know why I play video games so much?  It&#39;s because I&#39;m<br/>
bored.  You&#39;re kind of boring.&quot;  *GASP*!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my questions are, is their anyone on here prone to<br/>
&quot;boringness&quot;?  and how do you keep moving?  I have traditionally had a<br/>
habit of becoming stagnant.  ESPECIALLY in the winter.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, like I said, when we were first started unschooling, things were<br/>
wonderful!  I had more things to do and we had more fun than ever<br/>
before.  When things settled down, and we became used to our new<br/>
lifestyles, well...  mommy got boring again.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
I have some of my own thoughts on how to fix my problem, and help my<br/>
kids have a more interesting life but, I was looking for some outside<br/>
advice as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Boringly yours,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876219266">Hi Heather--<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean.  In my case I am looking for new inspiration because my dd9 is at <br/>
a new place.  She&#39;s had lots of things she&#39;s into, but now she&#39;s looking for new <br/>
inspiration--and it looks like boredom.  The things I&#39;m doing right now are:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Rereading some John Holt books to help get me sparky again<br/>
<br/>
2. Combing Sandra&#39;s and Pam&#39;s websites--they have so many ideas out there.  I&#39;m making <br/>
a list as I come across things that might interest her to do--bigger projects, little dice <br/>
games, etc.  I&#39;ve also been following links that lead to interesting things.  So much <br/>
research can be done on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that&#39;s happening lately is that all of a sudden she&#39;s interested in going to <br/>
classes, and there are some really good attempts going on around here within our <br/>
unschooling community to get classes going that will meet the needs of the unschoolers <br/>
as far as having fairly open structure, lots of hands on, etc..  But in observing things, I&#39;m <br/>
realizing that we don&#39;t need a class for any of the stuff she wants to do right now and the <br/>
social component of the class is a larger factor than anything else that goes on.  I can <br/>
help her to do a lot of the stuff she&#39;s interested in.  She&#39;s not interested in anything <br/>
specialized like a martial art or ballet at this point.<br/>
<br/>
I have been motivated to write about that on our unschooling discussion board, and some <br/>
people really aren&#39;t getting what I mean--it&#39;s kind of funny that even the unschoolers <br/>
can&#39;t see past the shiny allure of all the classes that are offered for kids these days.  They <br/>
all sound great and so full of the promise to teach our kids everything they might be <br/>
missing.  And now they even use different language:  &quot;provide the opportunity.&quot;  Well, <br/>
what parent doesn&#39;t want to do that?!?  But they still mostly boil down to a lot of <br/>
management, one adult presenting some material in some way that may or may not be <br/>
interesting to any one child, a timetable, etc.  They may work just fine for some, but in <br/>
really watching my dd, I&#39;m just not finding that they justify the expense.<br/>
<br/>
She usually says, &quot;There was too much talking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I think the sudden interest indicates that she would like more stimulation and would <br/>
like me to be bringing more to her (she still actually wants to stay home a lot), but she <br/>
didn&#39;t know how to ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933825226">I like the way you put that soo much better!!! <br/>
<br/>
Mommy isn&#39;t boring!  Mommy needs a little inspiration!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, I&#39;ve always been someone who needed lists to get the<br/>
things done I wanted to do.  (read: scatterbrain!)  I dropped that<br/>
when we first started unschooling.  I&#39;m not sure why I thought I had<br/>
to.  It&#39;s not like I ever made anyone stick to the lists.  I just need<br/>
to organize thoughts and ideas outside of head.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I was feeling badly today.  I feel that I wasn&#39;t my best this winter.<br/>
 Pregnancy has left me tired and less than ambitious and I feel that<br/>
the  boys have suffered a bit.  Although, that&#39;s the worst I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
 That I&#39;m boring.  Aside from the eye rolling I KNOW is going on<br/>
behind my back.  I can&#39;t help being emotional!  &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go back to list making.  For reference sake.  <br/>
<br/>
...off to find some inspiration in the bottom of the ice cream tub!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825734307">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share one of the things we&#39;re doing along the lines of bringing more of the <br/>
outside world into kids that are really enjoying being at home.  We are putting interesting <br/>
daily holidays on our calendar.  I found this site:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dailyholidays.net/month.php?month=3">http://www.dailyholidays.net/month.php?month=3</a><br/>
<br/>
You know how every day has some goofy and not so goofy thing attached to it, like that <br/>
it&#39;s national egg day, or somesuch?  This site lists a whole bunch from our country and <br/>
other countries.  Today, along with other things, is Make Your Own Holiday Day, so last <br/>
night I asked the kids what holiday they would like to make.  One idea was Take Your Kids <br/>
to the Candy Store Day, another was Stay Up All Night and Sleep All Day Day, and they <br/>
settled on Treat Your Family Nice Day.  It was completely up to them--so that makes a <br/>
mommy smile!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I went through and chose a smattering of days that I thought would be <br/>
interesting to them (and me too), and put them on the family calendar.  April 3 is Pony <br/>
Express Day (in honor of my horse loving daughter), April 15 in National Pi day (in honor <br/>
of number loving son), etc.<br/>
<br/>
Washington State&#39;s Cherry Blossom Day stimulated discussion about asian art, ornamental <br/>
vs. producing fruit trees, photography and beauty along with some internet searching for <br/>
examples and it&#39;s not even on our calendar!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they seem to be loving this idea so far, so I thought I would share in case anyone <br/>
else is looking for some new inspiration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159596420">Hi,<br/>
Just seen this thread and thought I would ask my question along with<br/>
it as it kinda ties in.  My children have not yet said I am boring,<br/>
but I do feel boring.  I have no hobbies with which to inspire them,<br/>
you know like art or nature or photography or music or etc....<br/>
I just feel....well I have some friends whose children (homeschooled)<br/>
seem to be learning everything from tudors and stuarts, to algebra, to<br/>
writing mini books (at 7) and I love these friends dearly but i get a<br/>
bit agitated when my dd&#39;s (7) interests are:<br/>
Beatrix Potter, Bratz, Titanic, Rainbow Fairies and other things which<br/>
by comparison (there&#39;s the word I guess, stop comparing)seem less, I<br/>
don&#39;t know.....not academic just,...I don&#39;t know what word i want. <br/>
When I hear my freind&#39;s talk I feel my dd is way behind (I know you<br/>
will say there is no &quot;behind&quot; in unschooling).  I strew for her, buy<br/>
her books, dvd&#39;s and google stuff in line with her interests. We talk<br/>
constantly, about everything.  I&#39;m just feeling that becos I don&#39;t<br/>
have any particular thing I&#39;m into (which is tricky as I have  a ds<br/>
nearly 4 and a dd nearly 2)that they somehow miss out.  I have<br/>
&quot;attachment parented&quot; my children all of their lives and feel i know<br/>
them as well as i can but i just doubt that i am giving them enough OR<br/>
big question can i give them too much and then i lose something of<br/>
myself? <br/>
thanks<br/>

It sounds to  me like you&#39;re into your daughter right no! That&#39;s not  <br/>
a problem.  She&#39;s very little, and I think spending a ton of time  <br/>
with her and your son is perfect.<br/>
<br/>
This is slightly a joke, but mostly dead serious.  There&#39;s a chart:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/howto">http://sandradodd.com/howto</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
According to that chart, with my daughter sixteen, I should spend  <br/>
about five hours a day doing things for or with her, paying attention  <br/>
to her.  We&#39;re doing that.  I only spend an our or two with Marty,  <br/>
but that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter&#39;s two.  You should be spending 21 hours a day with her,  <br/>
by my very precise graph (you&#39;ll see it at the link).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713609934">I read Sandras link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/howto">http://sandradodd.com/howto</a><br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sandra says it is a bit of a joke but mostly serious. I saw it in exactly<br/>
this light. Like how can I really spend that many hours with my child?<br/>
Impossible J... Do you know how busy my life is? Etc Etc Etc..... BUT, how<br/>
many hours am I actually spending with my children (really spending, not<br/>
just sharing the same breathing space)? Where can I improve things? What am<br/>
I doing that seems important but that in reality takes away from this most<br/>
important time spent with my children? What can I change so that we do<br/>
necessary things together more? And a whole lot of other provoking<br/>
questions. First result is that I am off now to have a bubble bath with my 6<br/>
year old instead of my usual quick shower!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The page concludes: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If you want to measure, measure generously. If you want to give, give<br/>
 </span></blockquote>generously. If you want to unschool, or be a mindful parent, give, give,<br/>
give. You&#39;ll find after a few years that you still have everything you<br/>
thought you had given away, and more. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That pretty much sums it up, doesnt it? Unschooling becomes the ultimate<br/>
challenge against modern selfishness. And a call to battle, certainly for<br/>
me, because I am selfish. Which means that instead of blaming others, I look<br/>
at myself first when things havent gone so well  like me being grumpy with<br/>
my kids yesterday because they didnt listen to something I told them to do<br/>
while I finished off an email L. In retrospect, I should have chucked the<br/>
email and helped them do what they needed to do (get in the car as we were<br/>
going out and about to run late...) Instead I pursued my own ends and the<br/>
price was an uncomfortable ½ hour while we regained our group harmony...<br/>

Hi, <br/>
This allays me fears thanq.  That&#39;s what I feel I have been doing and<br/>
am still doing, give, give, give.  In my mind while my children are<br/>
awake I am there and I do whatever they want to do.  When they are<br/>
alseep I am there ready to respond if they wake, and we all share a<br/>
nice big bed (2 king sizes pushed together).  They pretty much are my<br/>
life but I see (with my 7 year old dd) how their needs change and it<br/>
becomes were they don&#39;t need you as much all of the time. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am not my nature selfish, but do find when I start thinking &quot;I need<br/>
some space just for me&quot;.  I then lose all my perspective and get<br/>
controlling and manipulative with the children and grumpy.  I realise<br/>
when I am feeling rational that I don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; my own space, I can be<br/>
with my children and still get done what I feel I &quot;must&quot; do like read<br/>
a book occasionally or just think.  I love the fact we answer to<br/>
no-one and nobody&#39;s timetable.  Some well paid top executives can&#39;t<br/>
claim that.  I love the fact that today we lingered at the farm and<br/>
fed and stroked the animals, and still had time to roll down the hills<br/>
at the park while dd 7 listened to High school musical.  Right now we<br/>
are all on the computers and i have managed to type this e-mail and<br/>
say thanq for your reassurance but I am going now becos ds 3 needs<br/>
some help typing in google, so i&#39;d better go but thanq.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163555751">If a friend or partner can do something with your kids while you do  <br/>
something with other friends, that can be wonderful too.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Babysitting&quot; isn&#39;t the thing to do, though.  The kids will be home  <br/>
and you&#39;re not home and they get antsy and nervous.  But if the other  <br/>
parent or another family or another adult friend will take them out  <br/>
to do something cool, that can be good for everyone involved!<br/>
