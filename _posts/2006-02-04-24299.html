<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982380447">My 13 year old daughter (only child) still holds my hand in public (gives hugs too), but she knows that holding her hand is my absolute favorite thing in the whole world to do, so I don&#39;t know if she really wants to do (although she almost always initiates it), or if she is just tolerating it &#39;cause it means so much to her old mama!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230644427">My 15yo Carly went to high school last year.<br/>
Last week I picked her up early and it happened to be during her lunch.<br/>
I walked into a crowded cafeteria, to look for her and when we spotted <br/>
each other, she ran up to me, gave me a big hug while saying <br/>
loudly, &quot;Mommy!&quot;   Then she introduced me to the kids at her lunch <br/>
table.  I thought that was pretty cool.<br/>
