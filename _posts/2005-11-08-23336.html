&gt; notion of &quot;school hours&quot;, I usually ask them to keep the TV off till after <br/>

&gt; game shows and soaps, since there isn&#39;t much else on. <br/>

<br/>
The best stuff is in the 9:00-11:00 time range, before the soaps come on.   <br/>
Interviews with musicians, live performances, sometimes stuff from Broadway <br/>
shows or something--I&#39;ve seen Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr both on something <br/>
(probably The Today Show), and I only turn it on once every two or three weeks.  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
By noon, nothing&#39;s left but the murder report (local news), the sensationist <br/>
talk shows, Judge-Someone with a lot of crazy yelling about some stupid family <br/>
problem or other, and more soap operas.<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t blame your kids for what they watch if you limit them to the <br/>
lamest part of the day.   <br/>
<br/>
Days pass where no one touches the TV, but that&#39;s because they CAN.   Choice <br/>
is very, very powerful.<br/>

<br/>
You absolutely do not have to get it.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do anything.   Everything you do is a choice.<br/>
