<div id="ygrps-yiv-487127991">FOX news is doing a follow-up story on the little article that was in  <br/>
Elle Girl Magazine, and wanted one of the mom/daughter dyads who were  <br/>
quoted.  Holly and I were asked first and opted out.  Pam and Roya  <br/>
Sorooshian had a house fire a few weeks ago and their lives are too  <br/>
hectic to even think about it.  Gail Higgins and Brenna McBroom  <br/>
agreed, or else there would have been no FOX news article.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
If any of you watch the news anyway and want to record it and maybe  <br/>
bring us some quotes and a review, that would be cool.  It might be  <br/>
on tonight, or maybe tomorrow night (according to what I was  <br/>
originally told) and Gail might know more later today.<br/>
<br/>
Get thisâ€”they&#39;re sending a limo:<br/>
Gail wrote: &quot;The interview is today.  They said 2:48 Eastern Time.  I  <br/>
imagine it will be taped but I forgot to ask.  We&#39;re hoping its fun.   <br/>
The Limo driver just called and said he&#39;d be here at 1:30.  I&#39;ll let  <br/>
you know how it goes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In case any of you want to read the article first to see how they  <br/>
deal with the information they already have, it&#39;s here:<br/>

<br/>
Maybe they&#39;ll arrest me for providing a copy while it&#39;s still on the  <br/>
newstand (or at all) and if so I hope they send a Limo!  Anyway,  <br/>
there are readers on other continents who couldn&#39;t possibly get hold  <br/>
of ElleGirl, and readers in North America who wouldn&#39;t be caught dead  <br/>
at the newsstand digging through teen fashion magazines.  Mine came  <br/>
free in the mail, so I was spared that bruising indignity.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage to Gail and Brenna of doing this is that Brenna has an  <br/>
interest in television journalism, so for them it&#39;s a limo ride and  <br/>
some experiences inside a news studio.  There&#39;s a risk that the piece  <br/>
will make unschooling look stupid.  They have procured an ignorant  <br/>
&quot;expert&quot; who thinks school is the real world and that unschoolers  <br/>
will be know-nothings.  By &quot;ignorant&quot; I mean someone who probably  <br/>
doesn&#39;t actually KNOW a real unschooler.  It&#39;s like hiring a  <br/>
biologist to talk about elephants, even though his field of expertise  <br/>
is microbiology and invertebrates, ignoring all the elephant wildlife  <br/>
experts without degrees.   &quot;Education&quot; might be one monolithic field  <br/>
(it&#39;s not, I know, but if...) but LEARNING is generally an entirely  <br/>
separate thing. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it shows above, but I wasn&#39;t very happy with that magazine  <br/>
article.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Here&#39;s another serious consideration.  Gail and Brenna are  <br/>
beautiful and photogenic.  Holly is photogenic but has a freakish  <br/>
haircut, and I&#39;m not photogenic at all.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been to a recent Live and Learn conference and are not sure  <br/>
if you remember which people Gail and Brenna are, they&#39;re in photos  <br/>
here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/jenner">http://sandradodd.com/jenner</a>  leaning against the car, on the  <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
And if you think Holly&#39;s haircut couldn&#39;t possibly be too weird, it&#39;s  <br/>
about 1/3 of an inch longer and quite a more earthly color than it  <br/>

on when I met her and she looked beautiful.  I had no clue that she had <br/>
a cool-crazy haircut!<br/>
