<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510136246">My DD, age 8, had religious ed. class this afternoon.  DD really <br/>
enjoys the class.  The teacher, who is also a friend, is a volunteer, <br/>
a school-at-home homeschooler.  I told my friend when the class <br/>
started that DD is not yet reading or writing.  She said that was <br/>
fine.  (I should have specified here--no worksheets, no reading out <br/>
loud.) The class has been without a textbook and my friend has been <br/>
coming up with very creative and fun lessons which DD enjoys.  <br/>
<br/>
Today they got the textbook and my friend made up a worksheet about <br/>
it--sort of a scavenger hunt through the book.  After class my DD was <br/>
in tears about not being able to do the worksheet.  I talked to my <br/>
friend later and mentioned again that DD is not yet reading or <br/>
writing.  This is what my friend replied:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And how are you intervening with that?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;I&#39;m not, I trust that she will read when she is ready and in <br/>
her own time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: (Quoting statistics and research on brain <br/>
development) &quot;dendrite connections peak at age 8 and if the child is <br/>
not reading by then the dendrites in the literacy area of the brain <br/>
just start being sheared off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;What about children who read later, say age 10 or beyond?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend: &quot;I&#39;m sure there are isolated cases of that happening but it <br/>
becomes much harder.  You really should have her tested to see what <br/>
the problem is.  It could be dyslexia, dysgraphia, sensory <br/>
integration disorder, letter tracking (?) . . .the wait and see what <br/>
happens approach is wasting precious time in which she could be <br/>
helped.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me:  (I am reeling in shock from her confrontation and feeling quite <br/>
defensive and just wanting to get away from her!) &quot;That is <br/>
interesting but could you just not ask her to do worksheets in class?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Friend:  &quot;Well, I have to teach at a 3rd grade level and use the <br/>
book.&quot; (This tells me that she is not willing to accommodate a not-<br/>
yet-reader.  Maybe she doesn&#39;t even know how!)<br/>
<br/>
Me:  &quot;Do you think I should withdraw her from the class?&quot;  (Until now <br/>
DD has loved the class and really enjoys the service projects--last <br/>
week they made blankets for the children in the homeless shelter.)<br/>
<br/>
Friend: (Who I am not so sure is really a friend!) &quot;No, no!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We left it at that.  This is the first and only time my DD has ever <br/>
been made to feel bad about not reading.  I feel terrible about it.  <br/>
I thought my friend was capable of dealing with this but she is <br/>
unwilling to help my child.  <br/>
<br/>
This same friend has had her child extensively tested for Sensory <br/>
Integration Disorder, learning disorders, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I felt defensive as it seemed to me she demanded of me to know what I <br/>
was doing to help my child read.  I wanted to ask her if she has read <br/>
any books by Frank Smith, especially &quot;Reading Without Nonsense.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am asking for advice.  I am feeling unsure of myself.  This <br/>
same DD is highly intelligent, curious about everything, is currently <br/>
in to Archie comics, Nancy Drew graphic novels, computer games, <br/>
gymnatics and sewing by hand.  Together we are reading our way <br/>
through several Judy Blume books, we joined a nature class in which <br/>
we are learning about trees at a local park, and we are making <br/>
Halloween costumes.  I also have a math course which she picks up <br/>
from time to time (it has a DVD).  DD will watch the DVD and work her <br/>
way through a portion of the book.  This same friend might be <br/>
horrified to know the math course is kindergarten level and DD&#39;s goal <br/>
is to learn to skip count and then to tell time--in that order. <br/>
<br/>
DD also understands concepts quite well and frequently wants to <br/>
discuss why the price of gas is higher at this one station we pass.  <br/>
(She knows because I comment on it.)  She is very interested in the <br/>
economics of supply and demand and frequently brings it up.  My <br/>
husband told me tonight he was trying to explain capitalism to her <br/>
this evening when they passed the station again.<br/>
<br/>
My friend might also be horrified to know that my DD spent most of <br/>
last year drawing books of stories.  She would draw them and bring <br/>
them to me to add the words.  I would write while she dictated. We <br/>
literally have boxes and boxes of these books.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else with a not-yet-reading 8 year old?  Or anyone who has <br/>
been pressured to have their child tested?  My heart still tells me <br/>
we are on the right path with DD.</div>

<br/>
If your friend thinks your daughter is disabled in some way, then how  <br/>
much MORE cruel it is of her to embarrass her.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter really wants to go, then I would tell your friend to  <br/>
be really really careful not to embarrass your daughter and point out  <br/>
that asking her to read or do worksheets is like asking someone  <br/>
without hands to write. No matter the reason, the reality is that she  <br/>
&quot;can&#39;t&quot; do it yet and she needs the teacher to accommodate that.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to persuade your friend to see it your way. You need  <br/>
her to treat your daughter nicely, no matter what she thinks about  <br/>
her not yet reading.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My youngest son started reading at 3 1/2 and was reading at a nearly adult<br/>
level by 5.<br/>
<br/>
If he hadn&#39;t been born at home, and if he didn&#39;t look just like his<br/>
brothers, I would have assumed he&#39;d been swapped at birth. I therefore have<br/>
to assume he is a mutant!<br/>
<br/>
The other three each took less than 6 months to go from starting to read, to<br/>
reading at adult level. Their starting ages? 8 1/2, 9 1/2, and 12 1/2. They<br/>
all read just fine now. (Aged 26, 24, 20, 17)<br/>
<br/>
The earliest reader is the best speller. The second earliest reader is the<br/>
second best speller. The latest reader is a close third. The other is pretty<br/>
dilexic - hmmmm maybe he gets his problems from his mother!! dislexic, I<br/>
mean dyslexic. But hey, that&#39;s what dictionaries and spell checkers are for,<br/>
yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Your teacher friend had her chance to express her opinion when you asked her<br/>
about the class and told her your daughter could not read or write. She had<br/>
her chance then to say if the class would not be suitable for your daughter.<br/>
To accept your daughter into the class and then humiliate her like this is<br/>
is not only wrong, it is cruel but doesn&#39;t fit at all with what I would<br/>
expect from &#39;religious ed.&#39;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, Pam, for your post. <br/>
<br/>
 I believe it was truly cruel of my friend to embarrass my daughter.  <br/>
She seemed to think that handing her the worksheet and book and then <br/>
telling her to do it at home was enough.  She then left her sitting <br/>
there with nothing to do so, of course, my daughter felt compelled to <br/>
do what the other children were doing.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to insist that the teacher be especially kind to my <br/>
daughter.  I teach a class of younger children at the same time.  <br/>
I&#39;ll tell her if she wants to do worksheets to send my daughter to <br/>
me!  There are so many things she could have done rather than <br/>
embarrass her.  I believe she did it to highlight a reading &quot;deficit&quot; <br/>
and to force me to get help for DD&#39;s &quot;problems&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I was at the St. Louis conference a few years ago and heard you <br/>
speak.  I really enjoyed your talk and I am so grateful for your <br/>
comments.</div>

<br/>
This is such a help to know the ages your children started to read <br/>
and that they read fine now.  It makes me think of something on <br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s website about how there are so many other ways to learn <br/>
besides reading.  This is our 4th year of unschooling and I guess we <br/>
just naturally do that now so that when I am confronted with someone <br/>
who doesn&#39;t know how I am amazed.<br/>
<br/>
I agree it was not expected from religious ed.  How can the teacher <br/>
teach my DD to be compassionate to others and yet not offer the same <br/>
to her?  It doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful for this list and the supportive people who read and <br/>
post! I don&#39;t post very often and I haven&#39;t even been reading it much <br/>
lately--our learning has been so seemless and smooth. I&#39;ve learned my <br/>
lesson and will stick closer to the list!<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s so good to know that your childrens&#39; dendrites weren&#39;t all <br/>
sheared off making them unable to ever learn to read!<br/>

There are trade-offs.<br/>
<br/>
There are schoolkids who avoid Sunday School and scouts because they  <br/>
can&#39;t read, but people don&#39;t talk about that much.<br/>

I agree.  I was talking with my husband about this this morning and <br/>
wondering if it is something like Munchausen&#39;s Syndrome--the parent <br/>
gets attention because the kid has so many problems.  My friend sees my <br/>
daughter as riddled with &quot;issues&quot; and I see her as perfectly normal.<br/>

I think so, but with a whole &#39;nother overlay, which is that the  <br/>
parents are such martyrs and must be *so much more informed* to deal  <br/>
with such a difficulty.  And if and when the child is not quite  <br/>
perfect, it&#39;s not at ALL the parents&#39; fault.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the side effect is that the child is assuredly  <br/>
imperfect--officially afflicted.  Something is *wrong* with that  <br/>
child.  Something is *abnormal* with that child, and the &quot;child&quot; will  <br/>
have that feeling for 60 years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764287070">My daughter really didn&#39;t start reading until she was close to 10 and we never made it an issue.  Now she&#39;s 13, is anal retentive about grammar, punctuation, and spelling, is online constantly playing RPGs, and reads a lot of fantasy novels (thick books with small print).  It crossed my mind once or twice that maybe there was an issue (dyslexia or something) because she&#39;s not a linear/logical thinker (like the rest of her geeky family).  But I got over it.  She was never tested.<br/>
   <br/>
  My son had a few bouts about feeling bad that he couldn&#39;t read at age 7, but somewhere after his 8th birthday it seemed to click.  He had just been lamenting how he couldn&#39;t read, and I&#39;d been reading Hoot to him, when he picked it up and started reading all of the captions under the pictures (we had the version that came out after the movie, so there were pics from the movie in the book) and read them, including a lot of big, long words.  I think he surprised himself, and his reading took off from there.<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m sure they would have been made to feel stupid and hate reading if they were in school.  But they love it. :)  My advice would be to wait. :)<br/>

out &quot;what&#39;s  <br/>
 wrong&quot; with their absolutely normal children.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I have some guilt over this because we did have our 3-year old tested <br/>
for Sensory Integration Disorder.  This was of course confirmed and <br/>
we had a few therapy sessions.  The whole testing and therapy really <br/>
set us back because DD knew what was going on and acted out on the <br/>
negative feelings she was having about being labeled and &quot;treated&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Turns out we were doing most of the therapy exercises ourselves at <br/>
home and were in tune to DD needs.  She has grown out of many of the <br/>
sensory issues, and the others continue to get better.<br/>
<br/>
Now a babysitter who is an Occupational Therapist in training wants <br/>
us to get DD tested for some form of autism (she thinks Aspergers).  <br/>
There is no way we will do this again.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, all DD&#39;s impulisive behaviors are evening out with age, <br/>
so there is no need for therapy.  Secondly, Aspergers seems to be a <br/>
catch all diagnosis for kids who don&#39;t follow the crowd and don&#39;t fit <br/>
into schooly behavior patterns.  It seems entirely made up to me.  <br/>
Third, there is nothing we would do differently because treatment is <br/>
behavior modification using rewards and punishments (we would <br/>
absolutely not do this).<br/>
<br/>
All that said, I did have a brief moment of thinking that a diagnosis <br/>
would be a handy excuse to shut people up when they bring up concerns <br/>
about DD.  I also had the fleeting thought that it would open up some <br/>
special education money that we could use in home because of the <br/>
recent Supreme Court case.  Then I thought, I like my daughter how <br/>
she is without any negative labels.</div>

<br/>
It seems to me that with unschooling, and giving children options and  <br/>
choices and really paying attention to what they want to do (or see,  <br/>
hear, touch, eat, smell, explore), each child can be comfortable and  <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of school, lots of problems fail to exist.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s being broadened or  used too generally, but from the  <br/>
Aspergers kids I&#39;ve known, unschooling helps!  More parental  <br/>
attention to interactions with other people and tips for getting  <br/>
along (which ALL kids should get) can help the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Of the three Asperger kids I know best, two local who were in our  <br/>
unschooling playgroup some  years back, they just took longer to  <br/>
develop interpersonal relationships.  They  might not be as good at  <br/>
it in their late teens (they&#39;re all boys) as their sisters or as  <br/>
other boys their age are, but they&#39;re all much better.<br/>
<br/>
They might need to work at jobs that don&#39;t involve too much human  <br/>
interaction.  One of the kids, who started off just standing facing a  <br/>
tree each time, went to work when he was 18 stocking shelves and  <br/>
storage in a store.<br/>

I need to not work in a bank.  I&#39;m not quick with numbers, and I get  <br/>
stressed.  It&#39;s not a life-ruining &quot;disorder&quot; for math not to be my  <br/>
primary mode of thought.<br/>
<br/>
Some people see the world as a mass of interpersonal relationships.   <br/>
Holly and Marty can see it that way.  Some people don&#39;t have that.<br/>
<br/>
It has helped me lots to consider the various intelligences  <br/>
identified by Howard Gardner,<br/>

<br/>
I think maybe  Asperger&#39;s is the name for someone being low on the  <br/>
interpersonal scale.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412483567">&quot;Of the three Asperger kids I know best, two local who were in our  <br/>
unschooling playgroup some  years back, they just took longer to  <br/>
develop interpersonal relationships.  They  might not be as good at  <br/>
it in their late teens (they&#39;re all boys) as their sisters or as <br/>
other boys their age are, but they&#39;re all much better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is what bothers me about the desire to label her with this <br/>
diagnosis.  My daughter is fine with intrapersonal skills, she has <br/>
always had empathy, she is sensitive to other&#39;s moods, she makes <br/>
friends easily (we usually end up playing with complete strangers in <br/>
the park because she goes and introduces herself).<br/>
<br/>
However, because she has problems with impulse control, everyone <br/>
wants to label her.  She can make other kids annoyed at her because <br/>
of this, but it usually does not hinder relationships.<br/>
<br/>
So to me it seems like the machine wants to put some label on every 3-<br/>
year old who won&#39;t sit still at circle time or play some stupid game <br/>
she is not interested in.  Asperger&#39;s is so broad a label that it <br/>
could be placed on almost anyone.<br/>

The unschooled kids i know that might have been labeled in their early <br/>
childhood (or even later) with a dx but were not, are all really <br/>
incredible terrific and *confident* people because their <br/>
parents/family/friends/community respond to them as the unique human <br/>
beings that they are.  <br/>
<br/>
As unschooling parents we are in tune with the needs of our kids, <br/>
whatever they may be, and we respond respectfully in their best <br/>
interest allowing them to unfold in their own way.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*** Our local homeschooling community has changed in recent years in <br/>
that there are many (too many) mandatory drop off programs now for the <br/>
younger kids where once every activity was a family situation with <br/>
multi-aged sibs and parental inclusion (of course)!!!  So we are very <br/>
selective in what we do because not being able to do it together is not <br/>
what we want.  So i met a mom recently who told me they did let her <br/>
attend with her child in a Bronx Zoo program (known as strictly kids <br/>
only no parents allowed) because she told the staff child had learning <br/>
disability or some such special need and needed her in attendance - if <br/>
they required proof she&#39;d be happy to get a note from her pediatrician.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, when my dd&#39;s ballet teacher came to me to talk about the <br/>
*problem* with dd leaving class frequently, i told teacher dd (then 8yo)<br/>
had a small bladder and that was why she would frequently leave the <br/>
class.   That was an acceptable answer.  The truth was she sometimes <br/>
just wanted to come and give me a hug (i was always sitting on the <br/>
other side of the big glass window during her class).  I thought it was <br/>
wonderful that she wanted to just come and give me hug but that answer <br/>
was not what the teacher was looking for - she was expecting me to cut <br/>
off my dd&#39;s freedom to come and go in the room.  The other truth was <br/>
that if she did need to go to the bathroom she still wanted me with <br/>
her - but of course that explanation would never have been acceptable <br/>
for an 8yo &lt;lol&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day, this years ballet teacher came to me to talk to me <br/>
about my dd&#39;s &quot;chatter.&quot;  She explained that when a question was asked <br/>
and the kids raised their hand to answer and that dd did that part just <br/>
fine (guess what folks - somewhere along the line she learned to raise <br/>
her hand and not just call out an answer in a teacher/class <br/>
situation).  The problem dance teacher wanted to discuss was that dd <br/>
didn&#39;t answer the question but responded with something that in <br/>
teachers mind was unrelated to the question, i responded by saying with <br/>
a joyful (and proud) smile, &quot;yes she&#39;s always thinking several steps <br/>
ahead.&quot;  Teacher did not expect this answer. So she turned to dd and <br/>
said directly to her, &quot;when i ask a question i need you to answer what <br/>
i ask.  If you have a story to share save it for the end of class.  I <br/>
will leave time for sharing at the end of class.&quot;  Dd kind of shrugged <br/>
and then when teacher left looked at me with a baffled expression not <br/>
quite understanding what the teacher was referring to. My response, &quot;i <br/>
love the way your mind works and all the connections you make.&quot;  She <br/>
swelled up with pride and we both left the studio feeling really <br/>
wonderful about who we both are in the world!!!  Talk about turning <br/>
what was intended as a *corrective instruction* into a reaffirming <br/>
situation. <br/>
