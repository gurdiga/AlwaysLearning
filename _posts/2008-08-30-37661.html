I have done much research about Quackwatch and the people behind it.  It<br/>
breaks my heart and infuriates me that they are misleading so many.  They<br/>
almost kept my mother from receiving the care that has turned around a<br/>
serious health issue where the mainstream had failed.  Below are excerpts<br/>

A website named quackwatch sounds pretty authoritative, doesnt it?  Im<br/>
sure you realize that anyone can buy a domain and name it quackwatch.  <br/>

Opinion by Consumer Advocate Tim Bolen<br/>
<br/>
April 23, 2003<br/>
<br/>
A California Appeals Court, yesterday, April 22, 2003, bludgeoned the<br/>
National Council Against Health Fraud (NCAHF), and their whole argument<br/>
about what constitutes good and bad health care. The quackbuster&#39;s operating<br/>
theme, the argument they use against alternative proponents, came under a<br/>
major American Court&#39;s scrutiny. The Court, basically, in their decision,<br/>
said the the quackbuster&#39;s arguments were hogwash, and they had no business<br/>
meddling in California&#39;s system.<br/>
<br/>
The Court also declared that top quackbusters Stephen Barrett<br/>
(quackwatch.com), and Wallace Sampson MD (Scientific Review of Alternative<br/>
and Aberrant Medicine) &quot;were found to be biased and unworthy of<br/>
credibility.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The quackbusters lost in a PUBLISHED case. The quackbuster premise failed.<br/>
Not some of it, not most of it - but ALL of it. The &quot;quackbuster&quot; measuring<br/>
stick for how to evaluate health care has been completely discredited.<br/>
Official quackbuster credibility is now ZERO.<br/>
<br/>
In a minute I&#39;m going to give you a link to the Appeals Court decision. But<br/>
first let me give you a road map.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what happened...<br/>
<br/>
The quackbuster&#39;s flagship, the self-proclaimed National Council Against<br/>
Health Fraud (NCAHF) decided, one day, to sue about 43 &quot;Alternative Medicine<br/>
proponents&quot; in California, basically claiming that all of them were engaging<br/>
in health fraud &quot;because what they were doing wasn&#39;t scientifically proven.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Their argument was that &quot;the defendant has to PROVE their products work, or<br/>
it&#39;s health fraud.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
California was the wrong place for them to try this stunt. Here, health<br/>
freedom bills tend to pass through the legislature UNANIMOUSLY. We like to<br/>
be healthy. It&#39;s our life style.<br/>
<br/>
The very first case that came to trial was called NCAHF vs, King Bio (a<br/>
manufacturer of about 50 homeopathic products). The NCAHF lost badly. Los<br/>
Angeles Superior Court Judge Haley Fromholz wrote a long decision, virtually<br/>
battering the quackbusters for wasting the court&#39;s time with their silly<br/>
case. The quackbusters had accused King Bio of false advertising. At issue<br/>
was the credibility of the NCAHF&#39;s witnesses, Stephen Barrett, and Wallace<br/>
Sampson MD. The Judge thrashed their arguments. You can read the Judge&#39;s<br/>
words in this original case decision by clicking<br/>

<br/>
You can find out who King Bio is by going to their website<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kingbio.com">http://www.kingbio.com</a><br/>
<br/>
The NCAHF appealed. And, boy did it cost them. You need to read the<br/>
decision. It is written in plain language, not legalese, and is clearly<br/>
understandable. Read the footnotes also. Pass this around to anyone under<br/>
attack by the quackbusters. Their attorneys will love this precedent setting<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
To me one of the more important statements is the last footnote in the<br/>
Appeal Court&#39;s decision, for it attacks the whole quackbuster operation It<br/>
says, &quot;The trial court concluded NCAHF failed to prove a false or misleading<br/>
statement. King Bioâ??s expert testified the products were safe and<br/>
effective. The products were included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia and<br/>
complied with FDA guidelines. NCAHF presented no evidence that King Bioâ??s<br/>
products were not safe and effective, relying instead on a general attack on<br/>
homeopathy, made by witnesses who had no knowledge of, or experience with,<br/>
King Bioâ??s products, and who were found to be biased and unworthy of<br/>
credibility.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But more occurred. &quot;At trial, NCAHF proceeded on the theory that there is no<br/>
scientific basis for the advertised efficacy of King Bioâ??s products. NCAHF<br/>
performed no tests to determine the efficacy of King Bioâ??s products and<br/>
presented no anecdotal evidence. NCAHF instead argued that King Bioâ??s<br/>
products were drugs, and the scientific community required representations<br/>
regarding the efficacy of drugs to be supported by acceptable scientific<br/>
evidence. NCAHF asserted that the burden of proof should be shifted to King<br/>
Bio to prove its productsâ?? efficacy.<br/>
On<br/>
appeal, NCAHF acknowledges that, under current California law, a false<br/>
advertising plaintiff bears the burden of proving the defendantâ??s<br/>
advertising claim is false or misleading. NCAHF contends, however, that we<br/>
should shift the burden of proof to the defendant to facilitate the campaign<br/>
against health fraud. NCAHF argues that federal law shifts the burden to the<br/>
defendant in false advertising actions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In response to the NCAHF&#39;s demands, the Court said: &quot;We conclude there is no<br/>
basis in California law to shift the burden of proof to a defendant in a<br/>
representative false advertising and unlawful competition action. We<br/>
conclude further that the Legislature has indicated an intent to place the<br/>
burden of proof on the plaintiff in such cases. Finally, we conclude federal<br/>
authority is not apposite.&quot; What this means to the North American Health<br/>
Freedom Movement...<br/>
<br/>
This is a PUBLISHED case. It is PRECEDENT setting. It can (and should) be<br/>
used in any case in the US where quackbusters are involved. The quackbusters<br/>
have been court tested - and they lost. Their whole argument against<br/>
alternative medicine has been thrown in the trash. Their credibility is<br/>
zero.<br/>
<br/>
The case was handled, on our side, by famous California litigator, Carlos<br/>
Negrete. You can read his comments on the case at<br/>

<br/>
What I want to know is &quot;Who funded the quackbuster&#39;s lawsuits?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My advice to you: If you are the subject of derogatory remarks on top<br/>
quackbuster Stephen Barrett&#39;s website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.quackwatch.com">http://www.quackwatch.com</a> or Robert<br/>
Baratz&#39;s website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nachf.org">http://www.nachf.org</a> you might want to consider showing<br/>
this newsletter, and the court decision papers, to your attorney. This might<br/>
be a good time for your attorney to send them a letter pointing out their<br/>
new legal problems - and demanding removal of the information from their<br/>
website within 24 hours... Your attorney might want to ask for<br/>
compensation...<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned...<br/>

Tim Bolen - Consumer Advocate<br/>
<br/>
This &quot;Millions of Health Freedom Fighters - Newsletter&quot; is about the battle<br/>
between &quot;Health and Medicine&quot; on Planet Earth. Tim Bolen is an op/ed writer<br/>
with extensive knowledge of the activities of a subversive organization<br/>
calling itself the &quot;quackbusters,&quot; and that organization&#39;s attempts to<br/>
suppress, and discredit, any, and all health modalities that compete with<br/>
the allopathic (MD) paradigm for consumer health dollars.<br/>
The<br/>
focus of the newsletter is on the ongoing activities, battles, politics, and<br/>
the victories won by members of the &quot;Health Freedom Movement&quot;<br/>
against<br/>
the &quot;quackbusters&quot; It details &quot;who the quackbusters are, what they are,<br/>
where they are operating, when they appear, and how they operate - and how<br/>
easy it is to beat them...&quot;<br/>

The most damning testimony before the jury, under the intense<br/>
cross-examination by Negrete, was that Barrett had filed similar defamation<br/>
lawsuits against almost 40 people across the country within the past few<br/>
years and had not won one single one at trial.  During the course of his<br/>
examination, Barrett also had to concede his ties to the AMA, Federal Trade<br/>
Commission (FTC) and Food & Drug Administration (FDA).<br/>

This NCAHF represents the kind of danger that Ron Paul is fighting against.<br/>
It is believed that Dr. Whittaker&#39;s letter, and the actions of the<br/>
California Health Freedom Movement team, were responsible for the REMOVAL of<br/>
the NCAHF from the Loma Linda University campus.For years the NCAHF had<br/>
used Loma Linda University&#39;s address in a manner designed to make it appear<br/>
that the University endorsed their bizarre health positions.<br/>

holds the view that Baratz is about to be massacred in the courtroom and<br/>
that NCAHF will go down in flames around him. All I can say is it&#39;s about<br/>
TIME!!!<br/>

Read the whole thing, but I have provided a quote below:<br/>

<br/>
Quackbusters run over 70 websites. Millions of people go to them every<br/>
year. Look up chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy or even vitamin C, as<br/>
well as almost every other natural health topic, on the Internet and you<br/>
(and the public) will be led to Quackbuster sites advising you of natural<br/>
health dangers. In all these forums Barrett and the Quackbusters<br/>
relentlessly attack the consumer right to informed choice. These activities<br/>
continue the AMAs anti-quackery committees activities that were struck<br/>
down by federal courts as an illegal restraint of trade in a landmark<br/>
lawsuit brought by Illinois chiropractor Chester Wilk. They also help<br/>
insurance companies deny consumer reimbursement claims.<br/>
At the same time, Barrett flacks for products like aspartame (NutraSweet),<br/>
which is the subject of tens of thousands of consumer complaints. Question<br/>
(asked on Barretts web site): An email message is being circulated with<br/>
many statements to the effect that aspartame is dangerous. How worried<br/>
should I be? Answer (from Barrett): Not at all. The message is pure<br/>
rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
Bush To Impose Psychiatric Drug Regime:<br/>
The petrochemical model is in a de facto monopoly position, maintained<br/>
through AMA and similar licensing schemes, persecution of alternatives by<br/>
so-called quackbusters, and now this monopoly is being reinforced through<br/>
restrictive legislation designed to relegate the biological sector to a<br/>
marginal existence. The increased cost in terms of injury and loss of life<br/>
as well as the financial expenditure is born by consumers all over the<br/>
world, because governments elect to spend our taxes on one and only one of<br/>
the two health systems. The petrochemical health model is a commercial<br/>
cartel, a monopoly that has become so pervasive as to compromise both our<br/>
health and our financial ability to pay for it. According to the State of<br/>
Nevada&#39;s attorneys it uses what amounts to racketeering practices in<br/>
securing its profits.<br/>
Vigorous action against this Great Medical Monopoly on all levels is<br/>
probably the only way left to protect our health.<br/>
In closing, let me give you here the postscript of the Allen Jones<br/>
whistleblower report, a document which I highly recommend for study. Jones<br/>
appeals to all of us when he says:<br/>
&quot;The pharmaceutical industry has methodically compromised our political<br/>
system at all levels and has systematically infiltrated the mental health<br/>
service delivery system of this nation. They are poised to consolidate their<br/>
grip via the New Freedom Commission and the Texas Medication Algorithm<br/>
Project. The pervasive manipulation of clinical trials, the nonreporting of<br/>
negative trials and the cover-up of debilitating and deadly side effects<br/>
render meaningful informed consent impossible by persons being treated with<br/>
these drugs. Doctors and patients alike have been betrayed by the<br/>
governmental entities and officials who are supposed to protect them. To the<br/>
millions of doctors, parents and patients who are affected: PLEASE: suspend<br/>
disbelief and realize you are on your own. Educate yourselves. The Internet<br/>
has many sites that will help you. The Alliance for Human Research<br/>
Protection, www.ahrp.org would be a good place to start.<br/>
