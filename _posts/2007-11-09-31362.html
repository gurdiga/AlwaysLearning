I  think the biggest problem is that people see children as broken and <br/>
evil.  That the only reason that we&#39;re all not running amok is because <br/>
someone  squashed the evil in us by making us go through the motions <br/>
of being good  (no candy, no guns, no TV) until it was so ingrained <br/>
and we were old  enough to tell ourselves to stop with the evil <br/>
thoughts that we wouldn&#39;t  slip back.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The people who are the *least* likely to  beat you up are the people <br/>
who could mash you to a pulp. Just ask anyone  with a black belt ;-) <br/>
When you have the confidence that you&#39;re powerful,  there&#39;s no reason <br/>
to go around proving it.<br/>
<br/>
Powerlessness is what  causes people to shoot others, not guns. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah-HA! (The little lightbulb goes on over my head) Thanks, Joyce. I have  <br/>
&quot;heard&quot; this repeatedly in unschooling discussions, but for some reason,  <br/>
something in the way you said it *clicked*.<br/>
 <br/>
So, when my kids don&#39;t listen to me and I want to yell, I feel powerless. I  <br/>
don&#39;t know what to *do* if I can&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; is my thought sometimes (not  <br/>
always). So, how do I not feel powerless? Or do I actually want to feel  powerful? <br/>
Is powerful different from *empowered*?<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry for the many posts today, folks-guess the unschooling thoughts are  <br/>
just flowing today.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
De<br/>
<br/>

I think Joyce was talking about the children feeling powerless, but  <br/>
it works for moms too.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is to make your kids do exactly as you imagine they  <br/>
should, you ARE powerless.<br/>
If your goal is to set a good example for them,  you&#39;re not powerless  <br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is to make their lives more pleasant in lots of little  <br/>
ways, this list can empower you.<br/>
<br/>
Empowerment comes from outside.<br/>
Being full of power has many aspects.  You might become powerfully  <br/>
good at unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
You have the power to screw your kids up (we all do).<br/>
<br/>
Another thing Joyce mentioned was that strong people need to learn to  <br/>
control their power.<br/>

When I posted, yesterday was fresh in my mind, where what seemed large to  <br/>
*me* was instances where I was concerned about safety and wanted a &quot;wait&quot;,  <br/>
&quot;stop&quot;, or pause so that I could express my concerns and see if we could  <br/>
accommodate activities where they could continue in a safer way or if we could  agree <br/>
on something similar that had less likelihood of major injury (mainly neck  <br/>
and head injury from falling the wrong way or having someone fall on someone  <br/>
else is my concern). I&#39;ve tried different choices of words, and physically  <br/>
interfering. Words get ignored and stopping the play myself (hug, stepping in,  <br/>
joining in and redirecting) bring major protests that are too constant and loud  <br/>
for anyone to hear anything I have to say. My boys are very rough and tumble, <br/>
 high energy and I&#39;m fine with most physical play, but there&#39;s sometimes when <br/>
 they get so energized and in-the-moment that I *do* get concerned. They are <br/>
5  1/2 years apart and Wyl is *very* good most of the time about checking his  <br/>
power, but sometimes he forgets. Storm (3) gets caught up in the &quot;free for <br/>
all&quot;  attitude and jumps full weight (40+ pounds) onto belly, back, legs with <br/>
his full  weight on his knees-if Wyl isn&#39;t complaining about that, I bite my <br/>
tongue, but  there are times when Wyl wants it to stop. I&#39;ve tried, &quot;Ow means <br/>
stop&quot; (and  similar) reminders, but they mostly get ignored. We&#39;re able to work <br/>
through to  win-win in other situations fairly easily and smoothly, such as: <br/>
concern over  how an important toy is being used/hurt, private time, both <br/>
wanting the same  thing, etc., but for some reason, it just doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
translate in the  physical play. Then my lack of &quot;being heard&quot; gets stirred in with my <br/>
concerns  for safety/health and then old tapes start running through my head <br/>
and sometimes  it gets to the point where I feel like its several &quot;either-or&quot; <br/>
choices-none of  which are win-win... <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Another thing Joyce mentioned was that strong people need to  learn to <br/>
control their power.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Control it as in stopping it or control it as in redirecting?<br/>

The answer was, &quot;.... yeah.........&quot; and when I asked for help in figuring  <br/>
out how I can express my concerns I got &quot;nevermind.&quot; and he walked off. I don&#39;t <br/>
 often get answers or help from Wyl :~) When I *do* get help in solving <br/>
stuff, he  comes up with great stuff! <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m asking about controlling my own, because I feel he does  <br/>
pretty good with his own, and that better control on his part will  come with <br/>
time and experience. He has much more freedom and experience doing  that than <br/>
I did as a child. And more support.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Is it possible that your kids might think of your own words as  too <br/>
constant?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Its entirely possible. *I* think my talking has shrunken to a very small  <br/>
amount and sometimes I do catch myself and know that I&#39;m talking too much.  <br/>
However, their perception is likely to be different than  mine. They both feel <br/>
comfortable speaking up and telling me when  they&#39;re done listening or to &quot;stop <br/>
talking&quot;... not often (IMO)... not  once a week... more than once a month...  <br/>
I&#39;ll ask and see if I get an  answer. Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you call a &quot;Time Out,&quot; like in sports?  Act more like a referee <br/>
than a mom; don&#39;t stop the play, just ask for a break in the action.  <br/>
Offer a snack or a drink, let them catch their breath, make sure both <br/>
are OK.  Be sure they know you&#39;re not just killing their fun.  A <br/>
whistle might be a fun addition to the game :-)<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little, the really rough play was Dad&#39;s gig.  As soon <br/>
as he got home, they&#39;d play &quot;Daddy in the dungeon,&quot; which meant <br/>
rassling him on the bed.  I just scrolled back in my mailbox to see if <br/>
your dh was available for this, and saw a post where you said he was <br/>
working in North Carolina; are you wrangling these boys alone right <br/>
now?  It could be their needs for roughhousing and your tolerance for <br/>
it aren&#39;t matching up.  Could you find more outlets for boy play, maybe <br/>
with other kids?<br/>

OH!  Good idea.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were young and my husband was working in Minneapolis, I  <br/>
used to take mine to parks two or three times a week, with the dog,  <br/>
with toys, and let them run and climb and swing and slide and roll  <br/>
around.  It did seem to help.<br/>

Yes, Monday through Friday, Dave is out of state working. He&#39;s not really  up <br/>
for rough play when he gets home... I&#39;m pretty good with rough play,  <br/>
myself-especially if I have a bra on ;~) We have tickle-fights and  <br/>
toss-me-in-the-bed type wrestling with myself and one boy... Occasionally I can  do both, but <br/>
they overwhelm me together, when it comes to wrestling. They seem  to get a LOT <br/>
out of wrestling with each other-even when there&#39;s other kids in a  setting <br/>
where wrestling is a go, they tend to seek each other out. Its the first  thing <br/>
they do every morning, before we get out of bed. :~) They&#39;d go on for an  <br/>
hour if I didn&#39;t mention breakfast LOL<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
