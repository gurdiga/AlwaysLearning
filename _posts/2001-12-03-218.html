&gt; Maybe not so many school-at-homers, but I certainly hear this kind of <br/>
&gt; understanding among unschoolers. And, of course, school-at-homers are just <br/>
&gt; buying into the whole school mentality.<br/>

can use words in ways that make you see (and talk to) squirrels coming off <br/>
his fuzzy head,  and knows exactly what to do whenever anyone around him is <br/>
sad (and is a fabulous friend to people who have literally never had one).<br/>
