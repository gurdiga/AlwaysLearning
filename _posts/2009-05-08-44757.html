<br/>
Also it quotes Ren Allen.<br/>
<br/>
What they say is &quot;one 2006 article said that the number of unschoolers  <br/>
in the U.S. could be anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000, and is  <br/>
growing by 10 to 15 percent each year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The article they link was quoting Pat Farenga, on the possible numbers.<br/>

<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
This was in my drafts folder and I don&#39;t remember whether I figured I  <br/>
had lost it and wrote another one, so if this is duplication I can  <br/>
cover that by asking the question where would a number like 100,000 or  <br/>
200,000 come from?   I think if I were on a TV game show with money at  <br/>
stake and someone could magically have known the real numbers, I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have guessed over 30,000 unschooling families in the U.S.,  <br/>
and if they&#39;re counting kids, I&#39;d go 2.5 and say 750,000.    But my  <br/>
way of coming to that number is pretty  much wild guess.   Is there  <br/>
anything better than wild guess on which to base the other number?  A  <br/>
percentage of total registered unschoolers?  But Texans don&#39;t  <br/>
register.  Just because someone buys a curriculum doesn&#39;t mean they  <br/>
didn&#39;t give up and put the kids in school a week later.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;m looking at my own numbers they seem too high, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There was an article about a government study done in 2007 that  <br/>
someone posted at familyrun.ning.com with the astonishing number of  <br/>
65% of the 1.5 million homeschoolers who were unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It was a bit much to believe ;-) So I poked around looking for the  <br/>
study and found the person overseeing it and wrote to her to get that  <br/>
cleared up.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is a study indicates 65% are interested in &quot;non- <br/>
traditional approach&quot; (as one of many reasons for homeschooling.) But  <br/>
7% (of the 65%) of homeschoolers follow a &quot;non-traditional approach&quot;  <br/>
to homeschooling. That doesn&#39;t mean unschooling! It means they define  <br/>
their approach as non-traditional (and the parameters of non- <br/>
traditional are a little clearer in the full questions). Contained in  <br/>
that 7% are people that could be identified as unschoolers (if they  <br/>
were given some unschooling test ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So, it doesn&#39;t give an exact figure but it gives an upper limit  <br/>
(68,250).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello Ms. Mulligan,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was looking over<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1.5 Million Homeschooled Students in the United States in 2007<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009030">http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009030</a><br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the chart shows that 65% of parents have an &quot;interest in a<br/>
&gt; nontraditional approach to child&#39;s education&quot; but the text below it<br/>
&gt; says &quot;interest in a nontraditional approach to education, 7 percent&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I assume one of them is incorrect unless I&#39;m misreading something.<br/>
&gt; (From personal experience with homeschooling for 13 years the 7%<br/>
&gt; figure seems to match what I&#39;ve seen even in more liberal<br/>
&gt; Massachusetts.) Is it possible to clarify that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you very much,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sixty-five percent of parents of homeschoolers said that was a<br/>
&gt; reason that they homeschooled, but they were asked about many<br/>
&gt; reasons; they could say yes, they homeschool for that reason or no,<br/>
&gt; they do not homeschool for that reason.  Seven percent said that,<br/>
&gt; of the reasons to which they said yes, a nontraditional approach to<br/>
&gt; education was their most important reason for homeschooling. Does<br/>
&gt; that make sense? If you would like, you can see the structure of<br/>
&gt; the questions yourself in the questionnaire, which is available<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you very much! Cleared it all up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still surprised that 65% included nontraditional approach as one<br/>
&gt; of their reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m interpreting &quot;nontraditional approach&quot; to mean unschooling<br/>
&gt; and probably not everyone did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bet there was a broad range of interpretations to &quot;nontraditional<br/>
&gt; approach&quot; among the 65%. To many of that 65% &quot;nontraditional<br/>
&gt; approach&quot; might have meant watching educational television and using<br/>
&gt; computer software instead of sitting at a table with a workbook.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the 7% who chose &quot;nontraditional approach&quot; as their primary<br/>
&gt; reason meant something more radical like unschooling.<br/>

&gt; Hi Joyce,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s exactly how I would interpret those findings.<br/>
