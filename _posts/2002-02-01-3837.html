&gt; sometime... How did you get comfortable with not racing around and<br/>
&gt; &quot;providing&quot; entertainment for your children.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - one way is to sign onto really super active email discussion lists. <br/>
That has kept me out of my kids&#39; hair! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we first started unschooling I kept a journal - I got advice from <br/>
long-term homeschoolers to make it my job to observe my kids for a few months <br/>
-- in detail. My job was to really come to a thorough, deep, profound <br/>
understanding of each child&#39;s nature/learning style/preferences/dislikes and <br/>
so on. <br/>
<br/>
So I started a notebook and I just watched them play and took copious notes. <br/>
And every so often I&#39;d read those notes over and over and try to see things <br/>
about the kids that I might not have thought about before.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, what happened was that I became much much more respectful  of <br/>
what they were doing on their own and I became very hesitant to interfere for <br/>
fear of short-circuiting something wonderful that they were leading up to. I <br/>
started seeing the limitations or closed-endedness of the things I was <br/>
tempted to offer them and seeing that what they would develop on their own <br/>
was EXACTLY at the right level and the right interest and the right challenge <br/>
for them. Eventually, everytime I had the idea to get them to do something <br/>
&quot;education&quot; I&#39;d look at what they were already doing and see the value in it <br/>
and not want to interrupt them.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking that any time we give in to fear and jump in and<br/>
forcibly try to teach our kids something in the tried-and-true,<br/>
drill-and-kill fashion, we destroy the opportunity that they had to<br/>
develop a more creative and more personally suitable way to learn that<br/>
stuff.   I love the way my son messes around and putters with ideas.<br/>
