<div id="ygrps-yiv-347976098">Thank-you to all for your inspirational answers. And I agree with Mary Ellen, one of the biggest issues was navigating people who have difficulty thinking outside of the conventional box. My son was very active in the community as an athlete, and volunteer. It sometimes felt like I was always doing constant damage control, trying to keep my son feeling good about his learning path, sometimes I failed. <br/>
 <br/>
Our journey mirrors many here. My son was never officially diagnosed with any dyslexia etc. But he is visually impaired and has been from birth. He has %10 more vision than required to be legally blind. He has no vision in his right eye and a reduced field of vision in his left, as well as a larger than normal blindspot. His eyes did not develop fully in utero. I could not get support from Blind support groups because they would denounce homeschooling (never mind unschooling!!!), and were very critical. But I had already been unschooling his older sister and I wanted the same wonderful opportunity for him. I also, shuddered at the idea of putting him into school with his unusual eyes (they have cat eye pupils and oval shaped irises) and having to be in &#39;special&#39; classes because of his vision.<br/>
 <br/>
So I unschooled him. But I must admit I was more nervous about it with him than I was with my daughters. And as the years went by and he wasn&#39;t reading, I worried. Wondering, was it because he was a boy, his vision impairement, a learning disability?<br/>
 <br/>
I did many of the things already mentioned above. Reading out loud, books on tape, documentaries, computor games etc. In addition he started music lessons (his choice) and played cello. He learned to read music right away(but didn&#39;t read books until he was 14). He was in scouts, St. John Ambulance cadets and became an athlete. I basically encouraged him to do anything he wanted to do, even when I worried. Watching him run cross country along side roads (yes he was hit once), terrified me. But saying no wasn&#39;t an option.<br/>
 <br/>
Fast forward now age 17.  He reads hours every day. Mostly Manga but also technical magazines and magazines about astronomy and herpetology.  Does computer programing and writes music. Writes techno music (think Dead Mau5) has his own youtube channel. And is planning to go to art/music school, to continue composing and to learn live sound and recording. And to compose for the video game industry and film.<br/>
 <br/>
He didn&#39;t read until he was 14.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, I still worry a bit. I feel I am in uncharted waters, but I have learned to trust him. <br/>
