<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174767163">In Montana lots of the farmers and ranchers talk like they&#39;re from Texas.<br/>
 Many of them have never been out of their counties let alone the state<br/>
so I really don&#39;t know where that draaawl comes from.  <br/>
<br/>
Folks around here are sometimes flabberMEgasted.   They cozy up with aff<br/>
uh gans, and they hope they never suffer from All Heimers.  <br/>
<br/>
In the historic copper mining town of Butte people say &quot;how are ya&#39;s<br/>
today?&quot; and &quot;can I get ya&#39;s some coffee&quot;  but I haven&#39;t run across this<br/>
any place else in MT. <br/>

My DH and I have this recurring debate over this very thing! I think of &quot;a<br/>
few&quot; and &quot;some&quot;<br/>
to mean basically the same thing. (as hte above definition &gt;1 but less than<br/>
10) He thinks &quot;a few&quot; is 2 and some is 3. I don&#39;t get how a vague word means<br/>
an exact number.<br/>
