<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774046593">Dear Elissa -<br/>
IMO, you are on the verge of something magical happening!  Don&#39;t despair!  <br/>
You have been working towards a vision....perhaps the universe has something <br/>
else in store for you!  You are now primed because you have already taken <br/>
steps to change and move and pursue different things for you and your family! <br/>
 You are in motion!  The house is gone....you&#39;re in limbo - ready for <br/>
something divine, I&#39;m sure!<br/>
<br/>
Step back.....take a trip.....&quot;stop thinking about it&quot;.....go to the <br/>
beach.....do anything but pursue - and something will come.....something <br/>
incredible that you couldn&#39;t have thought of......something that will only <br/>
feel right and true bec. you&#39;re tired and you&#39;ve exhausted your own energies <br/>
for what you believe to be your path....a big &quot;A HA!&quot;.....you won&#39;t be able <br/>
to say, &quot;well, let me try something else first&quot;.....you&#39;re done and now <br/>
you&#39;re OPEN!  Ta Da!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve put the vibes out there - now step back and wait for a response to <br/>
come - when you least expect it, perhaps.....relax into the beauty that is <br/>
your present being and your next step will make itself clear.....I REALLY <br/>
BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE!!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes!<br/>
Love, Jane<br/>

You can probably by-pass the septic problem (depending on the county <br/>
requirements) by installing composting toilets. That&#39;s our plan in NC. <br/>
Unfortunately, some areas require that the land perc anyway. I&#39;d certainly <br/>
look into it though! If there&#39;s a &quot;natural community&quot; nearby, they may have <br/>
already found a way to get around this requirement and you can follow their <br/>
lead.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

You can get a sand septic system.  It&#39;s more expensive than an <br/>
ordinary one but not hugely.   Don&#39;t give up hope.  If you really like <br/>
the land there are ways around having an ordinary septic <br/>
system.  Have you considered composting toilets and greywater <br/>
systems?  The newer composting toilets are easy to maintain, <br/>
not at all smelly and look nice too.  Someone mentioned Mother <br/>
Earth News, and I would highly recommend getting a copy, it&#39;s a <br/>
wealth of information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293470260">I want to thank all the people who have given me such great advice. We do<br/>
plan on recycling our greywater adn I didn&#39;t even make the connection with<br/>
composting toilets and not needing a septic field. Duh! I am going to call<br/>
our realtor about it. Apparently it passed two of the digs (they did 3) but<br/>
slowly and the tester-guy is doing anotehr so we will be able to choose our<br/>
type of system without restrictions.<br/>
Jane, I&#39;m reading a book called &quot;Behaving as if the god in everything<br/>
matters: A new age ecology&quot; and everything you said echoes what I have been<br/>
reading. It was eerie. Thank you for saying what I also know to be true. And<br/>
yes you can borrow the book when I&#39;m done! LOL!<br/>
I DO get M.E.News and am pretty aware of alternative building methods, I was<br/>
falling away from them and I think the spirits are telling me I am looking<br/>
in the wrong directions for what is necessary in life.<br/>
Thanks so much and any more advice, as you think of it, is welcome!<br/>
