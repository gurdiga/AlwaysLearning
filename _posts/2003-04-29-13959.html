I don&#39;t like the time out recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
But a friend of mine with two teen kids sent it.  She reads my website all <br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t paste it in because it has so much formatting, but if any of you have <br/>
a minute to look, I&#39;d appreciate a review.<br/>
<br/>
Should I link it with anti-spanking stuff on the page I&#39;m working on?<br/>

Partly it seems too obvious to me, but then my kids are bigger and I had the <br/>
early La Leche League advantage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132531379">I don&#39;t know.  Some of it is kind of manipulative, like challenging for <br/>
instance, and some things are missing, like providing a model of <br/>
behavior.  The basic premise of the page has an &#39;us against them&#39; feel that <br/>
I find irritating and disrespectful.  Like, use these tools &#39;cause they <br/>
work against misbehavior.  The website doesn&#39;t really do much in the way of <br/>
elevating a child&#39;s status. And, that time-out thing.  Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like it would be good to include, how about a wee like <br/>
something (a sort of disclaimer?) pointing out the good stuff on the site <br/>
and why the yucky stuff is a yucky?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested to see others&#39; thoughts on this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879285611">I agree with Marji. I didn&#39;t like the link, it felt wrong, if that makes sense. I have young kids, and I&#39;ll admit that I have, in the past, tried some of the suggestions, they don&#39;t really work, not in the long term. Kids aren&#39;t dumb, they know your tricking them into something- her cleaning suggestion-  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d use it, if you do, I think the disclaimer idea is a good one. Rebecca<br/>

&lt;&lt; The question is, are you likely to get people who are at risk of battering <br/>
their children looking for links. Probably not if they&#39;re coming from an <br/>
Unschooling page... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
And the other point about it being still quite &quot;us vs. them&quot; is true too.<br/>
<br/>
The mom who sent it was having a horrible time when she had two toddlers and <br/>
she called me in desperation one day.  She was from Albuquerque but had moved <br/>
to El Paso.  With her last bit of sanity, she called and asked me to find her <br/>
some HELP, counselling, intervention, something because she was feeling big <br/>
violence.  I only had Kirby then.  We had known each other for ten years at <br/>
that point, through the SCA and mutual friends.   <br/>
<br/>
I started calling around El Paso to find her a suicide hotline.<br/>
None.<br/>
Parenting group? <br/>
No.<br/>
County health with counseling?<br/>
Apparently none for parenting issues.<br/>
I ended up talking to someone in San Antonio and someone in Austin and <br/>
getting REALLY frustrated.  Every twenty minutes or half an hour, I&#39;d call <br/>
her back and say &quot;Still trying.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never felt the same way about El Paso since.<br/>
<br/>
I knew there was the midwifery school there, but they knew nothing about <br/>
issues with older kids (whoever I talked to didn&#39;t anyway).<br/>
<br/>
This was pre worldwide web.<br/>
<br/>
The best I came up with was a contact from Parents Anonymous from Arizona or <br/>
some where who could send her information.   So I got the national Parents <br/>
Anonymous people who said they had ONE single correspondent there (like a <br/>
national member who had no local group) and they would put him in contact <br/>
with my friend.  So the two of them started a chapter.  <br/>
<br/>
She had to start her own club to get help.<br/>
<br/>
So did I, with Ceasarean Prevention.  They found me the one person in town <br/>
who was involved but hadn&#39;t started a local group yet.  Same deal.  Sad.<br/>
<br/>
The friend moved to Tucson and has always worked full time, since she got out <br/>
of high school.  Pretty much wouldn&#39;t consider otherwise, and as she is on <br/>
her fourth very irresponsible male partner in that time (I&#39;ve known them <br/>
all), she NEEDS to work.   Seriously.  <br/>
<br/>
So for her, this was huge progress, and because she reads my websites <br/>
(ALWAYS) and tells me when a link doesn&#39;t work or whatever, I wanted to <br/>
consider using her contribution...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I could flag it as &quot;for beginners.&quot;<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think the advice we give newcomers is too high-level or esoteric <br/>
for them.  If a person is still doing a bunch of spanking/grounding/loss of <br/>
privelege or allowance, to say &quot;Just be with your child and respect his <br/>
needs&quot; will sound like &quot;poo peedity tiled on perect pooteeds&quot; or maybe &quot;WHAT, <br/>
I&#39;ll be in time out too?  I&#39;ll spank myself too?&quot;<br/>
