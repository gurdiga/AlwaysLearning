We are heading down the mountain on Thursday for the &quot;big city&quot; (HEEHAW!!) so I&#39;ll make a point of getting by one of the gaming shops there and let him hang for a while.  I had thought that the folks who work there could help guide us.  We surely need it.  Some of our local hs friends (obviously not unschoolers) won&#39;t let their kids have video games, etc.  So without your ideas I would be completely lost!!  Thanks and keep &#39;em coming!!<br/>
