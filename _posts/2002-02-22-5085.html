<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815643897">Sharon....I just read about your dh&#39;s  dishwasher experience!! Mine decided <br/>
that he was going to get a reduction on rent one time because his dishwasher <br/>
at the apartment didn&#39;t work.<br/>
He had loaded it with dishsoap and you know what happened next. Luckily I <br/>
informed him (while in hysterics on the floor) what a doofbean he&#39;d been <br/>
before he went and chewed out the apartment manager.<br/>
That was almost 15 years ago...my what we&#39;ve learned since then!!!<br/>
<br/>
Mary,  I can really relate to the kids fighting issue this week. We&#39;ve had a <br/>
really bad week that way....constant bickering and fighting. I&#39;m about to <br/>
tear my hair out. I have asked myself what the heck I thought I had gained in <br/>
family relations by keeping them home several times!!<br/>
I have to stop and remember that their are always reasons for increased <br/>
tension though. They recently lost a Grandma, I&#39;ve been working more than <br/>
normal this week and I&#39;m sure they are just processing their own stresses.<br/>
It&#39;s no fun though.<br/>
I really need to read that book someone mentioned.<br/>
You aren&#39;t alone in dealing with the different stresses of parenting. I <br/>
really believe the stress would be far greater if they were in school.<br/>
And it usually comes in spurts and goes away again. Difficult days or weeks <br/>
happen....<br/>
Something that has been suggested here many times really works well.<br/>
That is getting a change of scenery when things get tense.<br/>
Just going outside, or someplace interesting can end the bickering and put a <br/>
smile on our faces.<br/>

&gt;The only thing she can&#39;t<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I started buying milk in half-gallons a couple of years ago.  It costs <br/>
about 20 cents more a gallon that way, but I think it&#39;s worth it.  You <br/>
could also keep a very small container in the fridge just for her.<br/>
