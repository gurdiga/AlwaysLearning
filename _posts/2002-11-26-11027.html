&lt;&lt;  its <br/>
<br/>
pretty well blended here. To see two people of the same race together <br/>
<br/>
(as in  a couple) is more out of the ordinary!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we went to see Fiddler on the Roof earlier this month I got in early for <br/>
being in a wheelchair, and it being my Big Outing, and me being in the <br/>
wheelchair dock right by the entrance to the main floor, I was having fun <br/>
seeing all the people come by.   I saw a mixed couple in their 60&#39;s or maybe <br/>
even 70.  The man was black and the woman was anglo. I wondered if they were <br/>
married, because they weren&#39;t acting datish, but they were talking.  Then <br/>
maybe ten feet behind them, separated by six or seven various other people <br/>
was another couple, same age, other way--black woman/white man.<br/>
<br/>
They were dressed about the same level of formality, seemed of the same <br/>
economic class (richer than WE are--I was guessing professors or healthcare), <br/>
and the other couple was also chat, chat, chat.  So I thought it was two coup<br/>
les who had come together, and had split out to have conversations.  (By <br/>
&quot;thought&quot; I mean the zippy scenarios which never quit coming in my head ran <br/>
that one as &quot;likely.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Nope, I was wrong.  They weren&#39;t together.  Didn&#39;t sit together, didn&#39;t look <br/>
at each other.<br/>
<br/>
So then I thought if they&#39;d been couples since they were in their 20&#39;s, <br/>
maybe, or 30&#39;s (which isn&#39;t necessarily so either, I know), that means they <br/>
endured some serious pressure, because their parents would&#39;ve been born in <br/>
1910, give or take.  And if they had kids, that would  have been in the <br/>
1950&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe they all just lately hooked up.  I don&#39;t know.  But here, I&#39;m laying <br/>
out a recent experience and the speculation-dump to go with it.<br/>
