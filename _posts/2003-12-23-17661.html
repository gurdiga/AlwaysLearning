&quot;... I found myself late this afternoon with my 15 year old son<br/>
taking his learner&#39;s permit exam at the DMV. Imagine my<br/>
surprise to see that all the examiner&#39;s cubicles have a hastily<br/>
copied black and white sheet posted in them which reads: &#39;To<br/>

I don&#39;t even know why this is necessary, since if you don&#39;t register the IRS <br/>
gets you one way or another.  Are all the objectors to SS registration also <br/>
non-filers of tax returns?  I doubt many 19 or 20 yo men are going to give up <br/>
their tax refund they may be entitled to.  <br/>
<br/>
I suppose they have a system to verify if a 25 yo has already registered, <br/>
otherwise they will be duplicating registrations.  The notice doesn&#39;t make that <br/>
clear.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the point in not registering.  You can register as a conscientous <br/>
objector, or you can just not register and wait until the draft is instituted <br/>
(if it ever is, which I doubt unless there are dire circumstances) and see <br/>
what happens.  I doubt it will be easy to get to Canada if that happens.  Sadly, <br/>
I think they&#39;re going to get you one way or another, these days.<br/>

I could send Kirby to an SCA event with all his SCA gear, and he could stay <br/>
there to... help feed the horses.  Yeah.  We have SCA friends with a horse farm <br/>
in Ontario.<br/>

But he probably couldn&#39;t get a job while he was there and that would be a <br/>
drag.  <br/>

Personally, I&#39;d just have to hope they either gave him CO status, letting him serve non-combat or even better, 4-F him.  Wonder if he has any undiscovered birth defects.....<br/>

as I understand it, CO status can be pretty hard to achieve.  Even worse for Will, before his change of heart and schooling status, he spent 2 yrs in the high school Junior ROTC program, stating several times his intention to become a Marine.  Sometime after he turned 16, he did a complete 180, but we still get mail from recuiters in his name.  I worry he&#39;d have a hard time convincing the local draft board he&#39;s become a pacifist.  <br/>

He did buy a copy of the writings of Ghandi.  Maybe we could dig up his receipts and give him credit for reading that one, and for the books on Taoism and Confucianism he checked out from the library?  <br/>

Women who get pregnant while in the service are given the option to get out.  <br/>
Some women GET pregnant so they can get out.  I think if women were drafted, <br/>
there would be a whole lot more pregnancies for that reason, and I don&#39;t think <br/>
that&#39;s a very good reason to have children.  Therefore, I think drafting <br/>
women would be a bad thing for society, and for the children conceived as a <br/>
result.  <br/>

  &gt;Women who get pregnant while in the service are given the option to get out.<br/>
  &gt;Some women GET pregnant so they can get out.  I think if women were drafted,<br/>
  &gt;there would be a whole lot more pregnancies for that reason, and I don&#39;t <br/>
  &gt;think<br/>
  &gt;that&#39;s a very good reason to have children.  Therefore, I think drafting<br/>
  &gt;women would be a bad thing for society, and for the children conceived as a<br/>
  &gt;result.<br/>
<br/>
  Well like I said, I&#39;m completely opposed to the draft anyway. My feelings <br/>
  on that haven&#39;t changed since the 60&#39;s.<br/>
