Thanks Sandra. I enjoyed the article very much. It supports what we have<br/>
done so far and I definitely appreciate the reinforcement to detach myself<br/>
from the school beast. It is nauseating to be part of a system filled with<br/>
grades, homework, deadlines, tests, over controlling rules, etc, but<br/>
certainly less so when I remember this isn&#39;t my responsibility.<br/>

My 4 kids range from 10 to 15 and we have been in various alternative school<br/>
situations, in addition to unschooling. When they did go to school (not<br/>
public school, but school nonetheless), by their choice, when they were your<br/>
children&#39;s ages, they had the same meltdown at the end of the day. Upon<br/>
talking to other parents at the school, we all discovered that we ALL had<br/>
the meltdown hour(s) after school. This school was fairly radical...no<br/>
bells, kids choose what they want to do, mixed ages, etc., but the kids were<br/>
still in a building following someone else&#39;s schedule, they still had to be<br/>
with kids and adults all day. One of our theories was that when our children<br/>
are home all day, it is mostly on their terms, and when they are upset about<br/>
something, they are free to show it. At school, even at very young ages,<br/>
children figure out that they need to behave in certain ways to get along<br/>
and tend to &quot;keep it together&quot; even when they have little frustrations<br/>
building up (ie, they dropped their sandwich on the ground, the bathroom is<br/>
darker than they like, Sally said something unkind, etc.) until they are<br/>
safe to let it out...often in the car with mom or dad and/or at home. I<br/>
think you are showing your children great respect by continuing to let them<br/>
choose this course, and I don&#39;t think that their meltdowns necessarily mean<br/>
that your making a bad decision. It seems to me they need to express their<br/>
feelings at the end of the day (probably no fun for you), as a requirement<br/>
for them to go to school. And if they are still hopping up and wanting it,<br/>
then I guess they want it!<br/>
<br/>
And indeed this could just be a honeymoon period!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255617927">My 12 y/o daughter decided to go to jr. high this year.  Her main<br/>
motivation was to meet people her own age.  She has always been a VERY<br/>
quiet and introverted person, but with a strong personality and strong<br/>
opinions.  She told me that she needed to be somewhere where she was<br/>
forced to be with and talk to people if she were going to make friends. <br/>
We have belonged to homeschool groups and scout groups and she&#39;s really<br/>
only connected with one girl in the last five years.  <br/>
<br/>
I also believe that a second motivation was to convince herself that her<br/>
other public school friend was wrong when she told her that she couldn&#39;t<br/>
possibly know anything if she didn&#39;t go to school.  So now she&#39;s been<br/>
there for a semester, she&#39;s had no problem with the school work and<br/>
proven she&#39;s not stupid and would like to come back home.  BUT she has<br/>
enjoyed the social part and says that if she does stay home she will need<br/>
something that will get her out of the house and with people her own age.<br/>
So we have been trying to come up with ideas.  She&#39;s recently taken up<br/>
and is really into playing the guitar.  She doesn&#39;t want to take classes<br/>
in guitar playing (she and her dad are doing this together) but she might<br/>
take a class in music theory - but where and how with people her own age?<br/>
 She doesn&#39;t feel confident enough socially or in her playing ability to<br/>
play with others so no playing in a band.  She was into gymnastics for<br/>
years but now has little desire to do anything physical.  What about art?<br/>
 Maybe, but she&#39;s in a funny in between age group - classes seem to be<br/>
for younger or older ages.  What about a job?  She says maybe but it has<br/>
to be something fun.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m stumped.  Do I just leave her with all these options and let it go? <br/>
I don&#39;t really care which direction she goes but she&#39;s really struggling.<br/>
 We&#39;ve talked about how there never really is a perfect solution to<br/>
things.  That there will always be parts of anything you do that are<br/>
frustrating or irritating and that you need to weigh the benefits against<br/>
the negatives.  The semester ends next week and I know she is trying to<br/>
make a decision by then.  So I guess I&#39;m wondering what else I can or<br/>
should be doing to help her make this decision and does anyone have any<br/>
ideas about other activities that could help her be with her peers? <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461189339">Would she be interested in volunteering? My boys volunteered at many different places...a riding school for the handicapped, a zoo with a teen volunteer program (lots of peers there with the same interests), a science center with classes for children of all ages, the library (as a volunteer in the children/teen area and on the teen advisory board), at an animal clinic. <br/>
   <br/>
  There are sooo many opportunities out in the community and many places are looking for responsible volunteers. It is really good for preparing our children for future jobs, It also helps when she go to apply for her first job. Employers love to see that a teen has already been responsible as a volunteer.<br/>
   <br/>
  Good luck! :-) Krystal <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543946124">If she&#39;s looking for a social group - something where the social  <br/>
aspects are kind of &quot;built in&quot; so that it is easy for her to make  <br/>
friends, then a Girl Scout troop or a 4-H club might work. Girl  <br/>
Scouts is not all about outdoors activities - especially for that  <br/>
age, most troops are strongly focused on interpersonal stuff. 4-H is  <br/>
not at all only about animals - they sign up for projects that can be  <br/>
as varied as quilting to cooking to photography to rocketry to crafts  <br/>
to cake decorating. Another great way to develop a circle of friends  <br/>
is a theater group. Youth theater is great because even those who  <br/>
aren&#39;t super talented or skilled or experienced are often given roles  <br/>
in the ensemble and get to be part of the cast. Theater groups tend  <br/>
to become social groups - there is a lot of down time to chat and  <br/>
they often go out to eat and hang out together after rehearsals and  <br/>
shows. My 14 year old&#39;s social group has revolved around a karate  <br/>
studio for the past year - but it really is a game-playing group.  <br/>
They do karate and then spend hours in another room playing games and  <br/>
then go do karate again - twice a week. The same group often gets  <br/>
together once or twice in addition to that to go to a movie or some  <br/>
other activity.<br/>
<br/>
So - maybe those ideas won&#39;t work for her but will inspire other  <br/>
ideas that will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710960902">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Are you doing research because you&#39;re interested in possibly  <br/>
unschooling your own kids?<br/>
If so, I would start with reading on Sandra&#39;s website: &lt;sandradodd.com&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
We unschool because we caught a vision of how much more exciting and  <br/>
interesting and lovely real life could be if we live outside of the  <br/>
constraints and limits and artificial smallnesses that schooling  <br/>
imposes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve unschooled since we took our oldest daughter out of school in  <br/>
4th grade. She is 22 years old, now, so about 12 years. My youngest  <br/>
daughter, now 16, has always been unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Do we see our children &quot;actually&quot; taking interests in things and  <br/>
learning on their own?<br/>
This sounds disbelieving, like it is from someone who thinks kids  <br/>
have to be taught or they won&#39;t learn. Wrong. Very very very wrong.  <br/>
In fact, it is more true that the more &quot;teaching&quot; is done to a child,  <br/>
the less real learning the child does.<br/>
<br/>
My children are now 16, 19, and 22. They each have their own deep and  <br/>
intense interests along with constant curiosity about all kinds of  <br/>
things in the world. They live an always- learning lifestyle; they  <br/>

take an interest in things and learn on their own,&quot; would be an  <br/>

&quot;Do you actually breathe air and get oxygen out of it?&quot;<br/>

Pam worded that perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
Mine are 15, 18 and 20 and have never been to school.  They&#39;re  <br/>
interesting to and interested in people of all ages and all three  <br/>
have already &quot;been in the workplace&quot; and totally shot the dire  <br/>
predictions about people without schooling not being able to get jobs  <br/>
or to adjust to the requirements of schedules, etc.   (Holly&#39;s was  <br/>
&quot;only&quot; a babysitting job, but for a fifteen year old that&#39;s enough.   <br/>
She was responsible and punctual and never got confused about the  <br/>
complex and variable schedule.)<br/>
<br/>
The fears expressed to us over the years turned out to have been  <br/>
baseless.<br/>

Both of my children do whatever they like. In the case of my now 21 <br/>
year old daughter in the final year of her Law degree, she studies, <br/>
attends lectures and hands in assignments. In the case of my now 11 <br/>
year old son, he mostly plays videogames and watches TV, sometimes in <br/>
my company, sometimes not. They&#39;re both learning, they&#39;re both getting <br/>
the education they want. Everybody&#39;s happy.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744124568">I began my kids with regular homeschool. You know workbooks, some curriculum,etc.  That was ok for a bit with my oldest, but was pointless with my youngest.  So I just started letting them choose what they were interested in.  I did not know actually a whole lot about unschooling, probably still don&#39;t.  But something has worked.  My eldest daughter, 15-is running several sites for actors in Broadway Musicals, and has developed quite a following of people.  She aspires now to be a publicist, or director, or who knows as long as it has to do with Broadway acting.<br/>
  My youngest daughter 13-is interested in music, and writing.  She has a viviid imagination, and a very set idea as to how her life is going to go.<br/>
  Both of my girls taught themselves to read.  We have always read to them all of their lives. <br/>
  I have always kept phonics workbooks around, and tapes etc.  The eldest learned mostly by sight.  I got worried and tried to push phonics for her, but to no avail, and low and behold she can read beautifully, and has marvelous comprehension.  My youngest made use of the phonics tapes and books some, and learned as well with the same results.<br/>
  So to conclude, I just keep our house full of interesting materials, and they do the rest.<br/>
  Hope this helps, it is not as eloquent as some, but it is what we do.<br/>
