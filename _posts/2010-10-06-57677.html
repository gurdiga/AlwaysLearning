<div id="ygrps-yiv-879123664">Have a nice time Sandra, I spend the whole of yesterday with my son and<br/>
daughter in the National Rail Musuem. It has some amazing old steam engines<br/>
from the colonial era. awesome place DS loves it. The latter half we spent<br/>
in Delhi Craft Bazaar, which is all decked up and in festive spirit for the<br/>
ongoing Commonwealth Games, that New Delhi is hosting.<br/>
<br/>
DD got her hair beaded and got Henna put on her palms. We ate a lot of<br/>
traditional food and watched tribal artists perform folk music and dances.<br/>
