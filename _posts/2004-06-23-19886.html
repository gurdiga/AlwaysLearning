&lt;&lt; Lately, I&#39;ve been craving a nice big meal of pure unschooling -- so<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m back.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well let&#39;s stir it up some then!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just back from Las Vegas, Nevada, where I spoke at a conference (and <br/>
Holly helped the first day) and said one thing new, that I had saved to say.    I <br/>
said intro, middle and end, &quot;You don&#39;t have to do things my way, but the fact <br/>
that my way works means you don&#39;t *have* to do things your way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I think I might have hit my life&#39;s limit of people saying &quot;Well, some things <br/>
we HAVE to do,&quot; or &quot;We had no choice about...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
EEEEk!<br/>
<br/>
A couple of people lately (one in person at the conference) I&#39;ve said &quot;You DO <br/>
have a choice&quot; and gone on in some detail.  The mom I was talking to was <br/>
unhappy about things with her three youngish adopted kids, VERY close in age, and <br/>
she was feelng trapped and stuck.  I asked her if she had her car in the <br/>
parking lot.  Yes.  Charge card?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
So I told her she didn&#39;t have to go home.  She could go to the airport and <br/>
fly to Japan.  (Forgot to ask if she had a passport, but it could&#39;ve been <br/>
Honolulu, then, or Fairbanks, or the other end of Canada.)  I said she could be <br/>
having plastic surgery by Tuesday and never come home.<br/>
<br/>
Extreme?<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh.  If people have THAT much choice, surely they can choose to have <br/>
dinner later, or to move the TV to another room.   &quot;We had no choice&quot; is just <br/>
starting to get to me.<br/>
<br/>
People choose not to kill themselves.  That&#39;s usually a good choice.  But <br/>
choosing to stay with children means having the responsibility for that choice.  <br/>
We chose to babysit a batch of kids today, so four extras.  It will make our <br/>
whole day more exciting.   I could have chosen the less exciting, less helpful. <br/>
 I could choose to put them all in the van and drive them to their mom and <br/>
say &quot;Changed my mind.&quot;  At any moment, there are choices, and responsibilities, <br/>
and options.<br/>

*everything* is a choice - there is always choice.  Yes, even paying taxes,<br/>
and standing in line at the DMV.  You *choose* to do those things - maybe<br/>
because you want to follow the law, or maybe you agree principally but you<br/>
certainly have the choice to not do them.  In life, there are always<br/>
choices, once you see that, it is pretty darn empowering.   No longer are<br/>
you &quot;stuck&quot; or &quot;trapped&quot; you can actual say either I want to be here doing<br/>
this or I don&#39;t.  I could go on and on but I won&#39;t :) Just wanted to keep<br/>
stirring :) <br/>

<br/>
Ah.  We did that last week, to get Holly an ID.<br/>
<br/>
And over the weekend I lost my driver&#39;s license, debit card, credit card, and <br/>
medical card.  Most of that is easy to replace.  But I will go back to the <br/>
DMV.<br/>
<br/>
My choices:<br/>
When? <br/>
Where?<br/>
Do I take a book and a drink?<br/>
What do I wear for my lasts-eight-years (if you don&#39;t lose it) photo?<br/>
Do I do it cheerfully or toadlike?<br/>
If I do it toadlike, how do I justify that, KNOWING how DMV is, and having <br/>
been to many such offices over 35 years?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of choices, but I&#39;m hoping to choose tie-dye, a drink with ice, a <br/>
merrily distracting magazine, and to be happy the loss wasn&#39;t worse.  Nobody used my <br/>
debit or charge cards, so it&#39;s likely the whole set (they were in a little <br/>
envelope, not a wallet) is in some dumpster in Las Vegas.  A relatively good <br/>
place for them to be.  Not the best, but not the worst!<br/>

always choose our reaction, we can choose to be happy.   Things will happen<br/>
not in our control but we can choose to be miserable and feel powerless or<br/>
choose to be happy, grateful, empowered.  That philosophy has changed my<br/>
life.  <br/>

<br/>
Sandra, I agree, we DO have these choices. I could even choose more <br/>
hurtful and harmful ones for myself or others. I choose to accept the <br/>
consequences of my actions. My choosen moral belief is &quot;to try to do <br/>
no harm&quot;. This is merely MY choice, and I am willing to live without <br/>
regrets or guilt for my choices. Many people do not want to live with <br/>
the consequences of their choosen path. Sometimes one&#39;s CHOOSEN path <br/>
IS hard, but one CAN opt-out at any time. (young children in our <br/>
culture do not have this same option)<br/>
<br/>
I choose the joy of knowing: IT IS MY CHOICE TO BE IN THIS SITUATION, <br/>
whatever it is. There is no trap. I am not stuck. It is my life. <br/>
Neither do I choose to obstruct my child or anyone else in choosing <br/>
their own life path. It is not mine to choose. I want them to share <br/>
the same joy of freedom to choose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to see some people &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-182636120">Hi all, <br/>
I&#39;m a lurker in this group, but this thread is my life at this <br/>
moment, so I&#39;m hoping I can get some advice...<br/>
<br/>
My mom recently got divorced, and is now living with me and my <br/>
family. I think she is very depressed - and I know the symptoms well. <br/>
I also went through a major depression from mid teens through mid <br/>
twenties, that no drug or therapy seemed to help.  What finally did <br/>
help was - you guessed it - CHOOSING to be happy, and to take <br/>
responsibility for my life.  Since then, I use this technique all the <br/>
time, and I feel like there is very little I can&#39;t handle or deal <br/>
with.  It IS very empowering.<br/>
I have tried to explain this idea to my mom, to help her deal with <br/>
some of the anxiety and &quot;negative-thinking&quot; issues that she is going <br/>
through, but I don&#39;t think she is truly understanding what I mean.  <br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone have ideas on how to help her understand that she has <br/>
a choice?  That she can choose to be depressed and feel out of <br/>
control, or that she can *take back* control of her life!  I have <br/>
shared my story with her - which she didn&#39;t know, since my family was <br/>
very &quot;hands-off&quot; when it came to my depression - partially my fault, <br/>
I know. Anyway, I don&#39;t want her to feel like she is being a burden <br/>
to me, or that we don&#39;t want her here, because we do... so I feel <br/>
like its a fine line between trying to help and being critical.  I <br/>
mean, I CHOSE to let her live here, and I am choosing to make it <br/>
work, but that means helping her become whole again, because her <br/>
depression is having an impact on our family, particularly my 4yo <br/>
dd.  That&#39;s another thread though... and I think just a symptom of <br/>
this issue.<br/>
I feel like I give pep talks all the time, which is fine, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be helping.  She also doesn&#39;t want to see a <br/>
therapist; she says I&#39;m more helpful than they are - but it is <br/>
putting a lot of pressure on me to help her, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m <br/>
succeeding.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long.<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Allyson<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-970611151">Hi Allyson,<br/>
<br/>
Is your Mom getting something out of choosing to be depressed?  Some<br/>
unconscious need that has to be met... I wish I had an example, but that is<br/>
the thought that crossed my mind as I read your story.  If you knew what<br/>
need were creating the depression, then it would be easier for you and her<br/>
to find ways to help meet that need in a more healthy way for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
One good way to tap into what the unconscious negative thoughts (or core<br/>
beliefs, I call them) might be is to take a piece of paper divided into two<br/>
columns.  Then on the left write a positive statement to counter the<br/>
negative thoughts (for your Mom, something like &quot;My life is happy and<br/>
fulfilling now&quot;) and on the right side write whatever immediately comes to<br/>
the mind w/o any thought about it.  If nothing comes, then write the<br/>
positive statement again.  Do this about 20-30 times, and you&#39;ll be amazed<br/>
what can come up.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that I&#39;m making it sound really easy, and I know it&#39;s not.  I<br/>
think back on my own life, and know that when I have created a negative<br/>
pattern (like getting angry and using that to push others away from me)<br/>
it&#39;s really related to a fear (that I am not loveable) -- so I have a need<br/>
to create a situation where I can have an external obvious excuse as to why<br/>
the person may have rejected me (the anger and the pushing away) rather<br/>
than to leave open the possibility that they would reject the real me<br/>
because I&#39;m not loveable.  Once I saw the underlying need that I had, I was<br/>
able to choose to love myself - which then meant that I wanted to be loving<br/>
to myself and not push people away.  Mine is a different story, but perhaps<br/>
there is something similar going on for your Mom.<br/>
<br/>

Too bad you didn&#39;t have a therapist who could&#39;ve helped you do that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, does anyone have ideas on how to help her understand that she has <br/>
<br/>
a choice?  That she can choose to be depressed and feel out of <br/>
<br/>
control, or that she can *take back* control of her life! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s in the deep sludge of chemical imbalance, she can&#39;t &quot;just choose,&quot; <br/>
but if she gets back to the point where she has choices, THEN she can choose to <br/>
stay afloat up in the light or plunge back down where the choices don&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
Brain chemistry changes, when depression is advanced.  <br/>
<br/>
When people do know tricks for cheering up or keeping positive, they can <br/>
avoid future bouts as live goes on, but those tricks might not help at all, nor <br/>
even be perceivable, to those who are severely depressed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyway, I don&#39;t want her to feel like she is being a burden <br/>
<br/>

If she chooses not to try to get help for her depression, she might be a <br/>
negative influence on your children.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
depression is having an impact on our family, particularly my 4yo <br/>
<br/>
dd.  That&#39;s another thread though... and I think just a symptom of <br/>
<br/>
this issue.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Symptom&quot;?  It&#39;s a result, an affect.  Don&#39;t sacrifice your child&#39;s 4th year, <br/>
or 5th, if your mom won&#39;t accept help.  And don&#39;t think that positive <br/>
affirmations and cheery curtains can undo clinical depression.  (But when she IS out <br/>
of the depression, don&#39;t put up vampire curtains and the Music of Death, if <br/>
you know what I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-She also doesn&#39;t want to see a <br/>
<br/>
therapist; she says I&#39;m more helpful than they are --=-<br/>
<br/>
She probably enjoys your attention more than she would enjoy paying money and <br/>

and also, of course, the etiology and course of a depressive episode will<br/>
be different for everyone. It&#39;s great that you were able to chose to get<br/>
your life back on track and it worked for you - I did something like that<br/>
when I found out I was pregnant 12 years ago, and decided to pretty much<br/>
change everything and get my life on track so I could be a good parent.<br/>
At that point my life was pretty messed up, and although I think the<br/>
therapy I got helped, the real change was something I did.<br/>
<br/>
However... I also have had periodic episodes of depression going back 30<br/>
years. When I&#39;m depressed, in a clinical sense, no amount of &quot;pep talks&quot;<br/>
help. I cry about traffic, I cry about spilled milk, and I cry about<br/>
nothing at all. Everything takes an enormous amount of effort - in some<br/>
ways it&#39;s like having a bad flu and trying to drag myself throughthe day.<br/>
And what helps is getting myself onto an antidepressant that works for me<br/>
and taking it for a week or so, until it starts to kick in and lift the<br/>
fog. I suppose it is me choosing to take the pills, but if they weren&#39;t<br/>
available (and the ones that work for me weren&#39;t until I was in my early<br/>
twenties) I wouldn&#39;t be able to just &quot;choose&quot; to be happy, any more than<br/>
my diabetic grandpa could &quot;choose&quot; to make more insulin or my dad can<br/>
&quot;chose&quot; to breathe when having an asthma attack. <br/>
<br/>
You can, however, choose to stop taking on your mom&#39;s problems, while<br/>
still supporting her in finding help. I think a thorough medical check-up<br/>
would be a good first step, and then finding a support system besides<br/>
you, therapy or a group or whatever. You might also consider figuring out<br/>
where your boundaries are, and what you&#39;re willing to do for your mom and<br/>
what you&#39;re not... keeping in mind your own needs and the needs of your<br/>
family.<br/>

So, does  anyone have ideas on how to help her understand that she has <br/>
a  choice?  That she can choose to be depressed and feel out of <br/>
control,  or that she can *take back* control of her life!  I have <br/>
shared my  story with her - which she didn&#39;t know, since my family was <br/>
very  &quot;hands-off&quot; when it came to my depression - partially my fault, <br/>
I  know<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Since depression, even short term, is most likely a brain chemical thing,  <br/>
you won&#39;t be able to just talk her out of it.  Time heals some things, but  if <br/>
she&#39;s truly depressed, she&#39;d be better off with an anti-depressant to help  her <br/>
get through that time.  <br/>
 <br/>
Depressed people mostly lack the ability to make the kind of choice you  <br/>
describe.  It&#39;s not just a problem of right thinking.  It&#39;s  chemical.  And even <br/>
if it&#39;s not chemical in your mother&#39;s case (I bet it  is), it would be better <br/>
to get medication for it sooner rather than later.   Long term, undealth with <br/>
depression is one of the most destructive forces in the  world.  <br/>
 <br/>
I, too, believe in having a choice in how I choose to react or respond to  th<br/>
ings in my life.  I&#39;ve believed it all my life.  But when I was  clinically <br/>
and suicidally depressed, it was simply impossible to make  any choices.  It&#39;s <br/>
just not that easy for the person whose brain  chemistry is working against <br/>
them.<br/>
 <br/>
Her primary care doctor will be able to prescribe an anti-depressant.   <br/>
Sometimes you have to try different ones to find one that&#39;s tolerated.  I&#39;d  say <br/>
don&#39;t give up on it until she finds one that works.  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope she feels better soon.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**I do understand the effect it is having on my daughter, although <br/>
they do not spend time alone together (my mom is disabled and unable <br/>
to keep up with her physically), so I am usually there to iron out <br/>
the situation.  It mostly manifests itself (between mom and dd) as <br/>
impatience on my mother&#39;s part, and excessive worrying about <br/>
unimportant things.  For instance, dd wants to make her own chocolate <br/>
milk, and my mom wants to either stop her, or jump right in and do it <br/>
for her, so dd doesn&#39;t spill.  I feel its more important to let dd <br/>
express her growing independence, but mom is more worried about the <br/>
mess.  She intellectually understands what I am doing with dd, but <br/>
can&#39;t seem to let go of her old notions about what kids should and <br/>
shouldn&#39;t do.  Of course, the choice issue is central to unschooling, <br/>
since we have to trust our kids enough to let them choose too. <br/>
<br/>
My hope is that if we can get her out of this funk, that she will be <br/>
able to enjoy those types of moments for what they are - wonderful <br/>
steps in my daughter&#39;s life - instead of potential disasters.<br/>
I want her to see that she can choose to react differently to those <br/>
types of situations; that letting go of some of her anxiety will be <br/>
beneficial to us all.<br/>

I am trying hard to let her negative energy affect me, but some days <br/>
it does.  That&#39;s my biggest fear.  <br/>
Having choices, and retaining that ability, takes a lot of work - in <br/>
any situation, not just this one.  For me anyways.  I always fight <br/>
that urge to not make the choice, to let life wash over me - but I <br/>

Prozac without counselling isn&#39;t sufficient.  <br/>
<br/>
But as she IS on Prozac, maybe your suggestions (and some ofthe good stuff <br/>
suggested by others here) wouldn&#39;t be so far from useful as I had thought.<br/>

The Prozac dose ranges from one to four caps apiece. Did they up her to two?  <br/>
If so, maybe try that for a bit and work on cheering-up tricks for a bit.  <br/>

And since she&#39;s newly divorced, that&#39;s another current issue that will pass <br/>

Your mom helping her sometimes won&#39;t prevent your daughter from doing it <br/>

worry that your mom&#39;s reactions will gum up unschooling.  <br/>

Hi, Allyson<br/>
<br/>
When my mother moved to the USA and got married, for a while things were<br/>
very good. Then she and my stepfather had some issues, that caused her to<br/>
start feeling trapped and miserable. Her best friend then moved away, and<br/>
they also had a falling out, so then my Mum was also isolated. She felt that<br/>
I was the only person to whom she could talk about her private matters, and<br/>
was probably very depressed for a long time. It was also very repetitive. <br/>
<br/>
I finally had to tell her that *I* could not be her therapist any more. I<br/>
was not really helping her, other than to be a small valve to let off a tiny<br/>
amount of steam - the mains pressure was never being turned down. I begged<br/>
her to see a real therapist, or some kind of support group. Eventually she<br/>
did, and they both did some marriage counseling therapy also. However that<br/>
stopped on my stepfather&#39;s timetable.<br/>
<br/>
Then Mum wanted to tell me all about the horrible time she was having in<br/>
therapy! I remember her telling me with astonishment, &quot;Do you know that I am<br/>
depressed?&quot; Her history in our life has been that she has always sought to<br/>
make me and the other people around her responsible for her feelings. The<br/>
concept of owning your own feelings eluded her for most of my life, if not<br/>
her own. I felt burdened by the horror stories of her childhood that she<br/>
desired to tell me, in an effort to explain and excuse her own parenting. It<br/>
has taken a long time for me to forgive, but having Jayn and working for a<br/>
different way has helped.<br/>
<br/>
After 22 years of determined misery, it built up inside her so much that her<br/>
brain exploded. She had a brain aneurism rupture, fatefully on a Saturday<br/>
when her dh was home. He is also a doctor. She turned septic in the ICU,<br/>
then made a miracle recovery (8% chance of living at one time) and continues<br/>
in rehab and OT. It has been 2 years. She also goes regularly and frequently<br/>
to a psychiatrist, both to monitor the interaction of her many medications,<br/>
and to talk. For the first time in her life she has become grateful and<br/>
joyous most of the time, and loving towards my stepfather. But it took a<br/>
serious life threatening event to do it. They are looking forward to his<br/>
eventual retirement, so that they can spend more time together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079067855">In my earlier post, I neglected to mention that my mom is taking <br/>
Prozac, and has been for a long time.  <br/>
I also didn&#39;t mean to imply that she could just &quot;wish&quot; her depression <br/>
away, but that positive thinking does have its place.  I feel like <br/>
what I&#39;m doing is NOT enough, but she is choosing to not go to <br/>
therapy or talk to her friends, and relying on me.  Part of what I <br/>
want her to see is that by choosing to alienate herself from other <br/>
people that care for her will only serve to deepen her depression.  <br/>
She has friends who want to help, but after they get together, my mom <br/>
tells me that she felt she couldn&#39;t relate to their conversation.  <br/>
<br/>
She went to see her doctor, who upped her dosage of Prozac and told <br/>
her it was &quot;normal&quot; to be depressed after a divorce.<br/>
<br/>
My main issue, as it realtes to my family, is how her negative <br/>
thinking and feelings of insecurity manifest themselves with my dd. I <br/>
am having a hard time making her see the negative impact she often <br/>
has on my daughter, who is almost 4 and very sensitive to criticism.  <br/>
Often her reactions are needlessly harsh.  Everyone has bad days, <br/>
myself included, but I guess I can actively *think* about my reaction <br/>
to &quot;push button&quot; issues, and CHOOSE to let it go and act like the <br/>
adult.  When I try to broach the subject, she feels that I&#39;m being <br/>
critical, or &quot;overprotective&quot;, or that I&#39;m coddling dd.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there&#39;s no easy solution.  Thanks for your thoughts.<br/>

I don&#39;t see why anyone would leave a patient on an antidepressant longterm <br/>
myself.  With therapy/training, it seems six months or a year should be WAY <br/>
plenty.   But then lots of people might not have the intrapersonal <br/>
knowledge/desire/interest in examining how they can live more happily.  <br/>

Sunday morning I was sweeping our my tent and suddenly started crying,<br/>
and feeling incredibly sad. I started crying again on the drive down the<br/>
mountain, and the got home and started crying again. It was just the<br/>

I ended up calling a good friend and moving in with her for a few days,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87784534">Robyn,<br/>
My mom tries not to burden me by rehashing the same thing all the <br/>
time, so she holds it in, which makes it worse.  By the time she lets <br/>
it out, she is frantic - after worring about what I&#39;ll say or think <br/>
(or whatever &quot;it&quot; is) she is sure that the problem is the end of the <br/>
world.  She expects me to react by asking her to move out, or some <br/>
other drastic move.<br/>
I&#39;m sure if she was telling me about her problems all the time, it <br/>
would be very tiresome... but she&#39;s a &quot;stuffer&quot; and tries to pretend <br/>
everythings ok.  I think, for her, letting it out more would be good, <br/>
because it wouldn&#39;t have that chance to build and build.  That <br/>
inability to tell me (or anyone else)about what she&#39;s feeling is what <br/>
I see as being fear-based and tied into self esteem.<br/>
I&#39;m glad that your mom had her &quot;epiphany&quot; after her brush with <br/>
death.  My mom had a similar experience, (not an aneurism) 12 years <br/>
ago, and had to relearn all the basics as well.  Talk, walk, eat, etc <br/>
etc etc.  In her case though, I think it made her dependent and <br/>
unsure of herself, unable to handle or do things.  Part of that I <br/>
believe is the nature of the injury, and part of it has to do with <br/>
how she now sees herself.  Self worth is very dependent on all of us <br/>
being able to do things for ourselves.  Disability changes that.  For <br/>
some people, it definitely is life affirming.  They stop taking <br/>
things for granted, and realize what&#39;s important in life.  I just <br/>
wish I knew how to show that to her.  My own example is all I have.<br/>
Thanks, Allyson<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hi Allyson,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is your Mom getting something out of choosing to be depressed?  Some<br/>
&gt; unconscious need that has to be met... I wish I had an example, but that<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; the thought that crossed my mind as I read your story.  If you knew what<br/>
&gt; need were creating the depression, then it would be easier for you and her<br/>
&gt; to find ways to help meet that need in a more healthy way for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One good way to tap into what the unconscious negative thoughts (or core<br/>
&gt; beliefs, I call them) might be is to take a piece of paper divided into<br/>
two<br/>
&gt; columns.  Then on the left write a positive statement to counter the<br/>
&gt; negative thoughts (for your Mom, something like &quot;My life is happy and<br/>
&gt; fulfilling now&quot;) and on the right side write whatever immediately comes to<br/>
&gt; the mind w/o any thought about it.  If nothing comes, then write the<br/>
&gt; positive statement again.  Do this about 20-30 times, and you&#39;ll be amazed<br/>
&gt; what can come up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize that I&#39;m making it sound really easy, and I know it&#39;s not.  I<br/>
&gt; think back on my own life, and know that when I have created a negative<br/>
&gt; pattern (like getting angry and using that to push others away from me)<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s really related to a fear (that I am not loveable) -- so I have a need<br/>
&gt; to create a situation where I can have an external obvious excuse as to<br/>
why<br/>
&gt; the person may have rejected me (the anger and the pushing away) rather<br/>
&gt; than to leave open the possibility that they would reject the real me<br/>
&gt; because I&#39;m not loveable.  Once I saw the underlying need that I had, I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; able to choose to love myself - which then meant that I wanted to be<br/>
loving<br/>
&gt; to myself and not push people away.  Mine is a different story, but<br/>
perhaps<br/>
&gt; there is something similar going on for your Mom.<br/>

    I just want to add one nugget of info to the discussion on depression.  In several studies on depression, regular exercise out-performed SSRI antidepressants (like Prozac) in effectiveness.  Of course, I have no idea how to get your mother to take a walk every day and start lifting weights with Joyce Vedral, but it might actually help.  Speaking of that Vedral woman, she has a book titled, I Can&#39;t Take it Any More:  How to Get Up When You&#39;re Really Low.  I had heard that she was &quot;inspirational,&quot; but I didn&#39;t know she had written this book until I was looking for a copy of one of her books on weight-lifting.   By the way, she&#39;s at least 50, so maybe you can get your mother turned on to her.  Good luck!!  Deirdre<br/>

  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think she&#39;d be open to switching doctors - <br/>
  she&#39;s been going to him for a long time and likes and trusts him.<br/>
  I agree about switching meds, but maybe I&#39;ll see how the next couple <br/>
  of weeks go, and then I&#39;ll talk to her about it.  I know she wants to <br/>
  feel better, she&#39;s just not really seeing the way out on her own, and <br/>
  I feel like I have a lot on my plate right now... too much to go into <br/>

This is the point of not having someone externally tell you what to do<br/>
(i.e. when/what to eat, go to bed, etc.). One can only learn self-<br/>
reliance if one has the opportunity to depend on oneself to make <br/>
decisions. <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When my mother moved to the USA and got married, for a while <br/>
 </span></blockquote>things <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; very good. Then she and my stepfather had some issues, that <br/>

&gt; &gt; start feeling trapped and miserable. Her best friend then moved <br/>

&gt; &gt; they also had a falling out, so then my Mum was also isolated. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>She <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; felt that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was the only person to whom she could talk about her private <br/>
&gt; matters, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; was probably very depressed for a long time. It was also very <br/>
&gt; repetitive. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I finally had to tell her that *I* could not be her therapist any <br/>
&gt; more. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not really helping her, other than to be a small valve to let <br/>
&gt; off a tiny<br/>
&gt; &gt; amount of steam - the mains pressure was never being turned down. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; begged<br/>
&gt; &gt; her to see a real therapist, or some kind of support group. <br/>
&gt; Eventually she<br/>
&gt; &gt; did, and they both did some marriage counseling therapy also. <br/>
&gt; However that<br/>
&gt; &gt; stopped on my stepfather&#39;s timetable.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Then Mum wanted to tell me all about the horrible time she was <br/>
&gt; having in<br/>
&gt; &gt; therapy! I remember her telling me with astonishment, &quot;Do you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>know <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; depressed?&quot; Her history in our life has been that she has always <br/>
&gt; sought to<br/>
&gt; &gt; make me and the other people around her responsible for her <br/>
&gt; feelings. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; concept of owning your own feelings eluded her for most of my <br/>
 </span></blockquote>life, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if not<br/>
&gt; &gt; her own. I felt burdened by the horror stories of her childhood <br/>
&gt; that she<br/>
&gt; &gt; desired to tell me, in an effort to explain and excuse her own <br/>
&gt; parenting. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; has taken a long time for me to forgive, but having Jayn and <br/>
&gt; working for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; different way has helped.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After 22 years of determined misery, it built up inside her so <br/>
 </span></blockquote>much <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that her<br/>
&gt; &gt; brain exploded. She had a brain aneurism rupture, fatefully on a <br/>
&gt; Saturday<br/>
&gt; &gt; when her dh was home. He is also a doctor. She turned septic in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ICU,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; continues<br/>
&gt; &gt; in rehab and OT. It has been 2 years. She also goes regularly and <br/>
&gt; frequently<br/>
&gt; &gt; to a psychiatrist, both to monitor the interaction of her many <br/>
&gt; medications,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and to talk. For the first time in her life she has become <br/>

&gt; took a<br/>
&gt; &gt; serious life threatening event to do it. They are looking forward <br/>

somehow two of my three kids know it. But my 16 yo seems to not get it <br/>
at all -  her state of mind is really at the mercy of what other people <br/>
do - around her or to her.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s such a great person - she&#39;s so lovely and smart and talented and <br/>
funny and passionate and on and on. I think people here who have met <br/>
her will agree, she&#39;s a very very wonderful kid. But she spends a LOT <br/>
of time feeling sorry for herself, bitter at what life has handed her, <br/>
jealous of others when things go their way and not hers, thinking <br/>
people don&#39;t like her and being critical of other people.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t have friends - doesn&#39;t know how to make friends. I want to <br/>
say she&#39;s serious, she takes things so seriously, but then she also has <br/>
an awesome creative sense of humor. She is on the comedy improv team I <br/>
coach and she&#39;s great at it. But she doesn&#39;t have the skill of making <br/>
small talk, being friendly, getting to know another person, and slowly <br/>
developing an acquaintanceship into a friendship. Nobody ever calls and <br/>
invites her over - she has never been invited to a birthday party or an <br/>
overnighter or just to go to a movie with other kids. She seems not to <br/>
make the little needed gestures that would help move a casual <br/>
acquaintance into becoming a friend.<br/>
<br/>
I would not say she&#39;s really happy. She has times of BEING really happy <br/>
- she does things that seem to make her happy, but socially she&#39;s very <br/>
unhappy. She wants friends who care about her and understand her and <br/>
with whom she can share experiences and interests, but she just doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to click with anybody.<br/>
<br/>
Also, she has her heart so set on acting and musical theater. She loves <br/>
it. She&#39;s deeply passionately interested in it. She&#39;s a darn good <br/>
dramatic actress, a pretty good comedic actress, has a good voice, but <br/>
not an especially unusually good voice, is a so-so dancer. But, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have &quot;the look&quot; or &quot;the charisma&quot; for star quality, at least <br/>
not right now. She&#39;s good enough, she gets ensemble parts, and got into <br/>
a summer conservatory that didn&#39;t take everybody who auditioned. But <br/>
she&#39;s not happy with that - won&#39;t BE happy unless she gets lead parts.<br/>
<br/>
I just hate to see her happiness depend so much on other people and <br/>
things that are so arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
But, the above aside, I mostly wish I knew how to help her develop <br/>
friendships. I do think she&#39;ll be way better off in that arena once <br/>
she&#39;s a bit more grown up - part of her problem is that so many teenage <br/>
girls seem kind of ditzy to her, not serious about things like she is.  <br/>
She is such an &quot;intellectual&quot; - she is extremely well read and loves to <br/>
talk about everything from ancient history to word origins to recurring <br/>
themes in movies to interesting news from astronomers, and so on. She <br/>
sees connections everywhere - talking to her is like talking to Sandra <br/>
- one interesting thing leads quickly to another. She&#39;s fast thinking <br/>
and seems to have access in her brain to far more material at once than <br/>
most people - if that makes sense. But she doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the just <br/>
goof-around joking kind of small talk that kids her age do so much of. <br/>
She doesn&#39;t get giggling over nothing, making things into inside jokes, <br/>
and all that teenage girl kind of stuff. She feels like an outsider, <br/>
different, and left out.<br/>

you described seems like a recurring theme for many people who are<br/>
interested in the dramatic arts.  And as far as not having &quot;the<br/>
look&quot;.....even Better Midler got some awesome leading lady parts.<br/>
<br/>
Does she have much access to people of different ages who share her<br/>
interests?  My 13yo tends to not have friends her age, but is very good<br/>
friends with a girl a few years younger and with lots of young adults.  Just<br/>
a thought.<br/>

&gt; a summer conservatory that didn&#39;t take everybody who auditioned. But<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s not happy with that - won&#39;t BE happy unless she gets lead parts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just hate to see her happiness depend so much on other people and<br/>
&gt; things that are so arbitrary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, the above aside, I mostly wish I knew how to help her develop<br/>
&gt; friendships. I do think she&#39;ll be way better off in that arena once<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s a bit more grown up - part of her problem is that so many teenage<br/>
&gt; girls seem kind of ditzy to her, not serious about things like she is.<br/>
&gt; She is such an &quot;intellectual&quot; - she is extremely well read and loves to<br/>
&gt; talk about everything from ancient history to word origins to recurring<br/>
&gt; themes in movies to interesting news from astronomers, and so on. She<br/>
&gt; sees connections everywhere - talking to her is like talking to Sandra<br/>
&gt; - one interesting thing leads quickly to another. She&#39;s fast thinking<br/>
&gt; and seems to have access in her brain to far more material at once than<br/>
&gt; most people - if that makes sense. But she doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the just<br/>
&gt; goof-around joking kind of small talk that kids her age do so much of.<br/>
&gt; She doesn&#39;t get giggling over nothing, making things into inside jokes,<br/>
&gt; and all that teenage girl kind of stuff. She feels like an outsider,<br/>
&gt; different, and left out.<br/>
