<br/>
Seems to me I remember that McDonalds was able to stop a local  <br/>
hamburger place from using the name McDonalds even though they had  <br/>
been using it for a long time (and it was their family&#39;s name).<br/>
<br/>
According to Wikipedia, Xerox works hard to make it known that people  <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;xerox&quot; things so their trade marked name doesn&#39;t suffer  <br/>
&quot;genericide&quot;. They don&#39;t need to stop all uses, just make it known  <br/>
that they&#39;re trying.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s possible she could work at telling people not to use  <br/>
&quot;peaceful parenting&quot; (lower case) generically but hopefully she has  <br/>
better things to do ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But she can object to someone selling something that&#39;s titled  <br/>
&quot;Peaceful Parenting&quot; since it could be confused with her product and  <br/>
she&#39;s paid for a right to use the phrase.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630932378">She trademarked the phrase &quot;Peaceful Parenting&quot; in 2006 and it is the  <br/>
name of her corporation. Yes, she could do that. There was supposed  <br/>
to be a search to make sure that the phrase was not already being  <br/>
utilized by someone else - that could include unregistered trademark  <br/>
use. In other words, just because you hadn&#39;t actually registered the  <br/>
trademark, if you were using it, it could be considered that you had  <br/>
an unregistered trademark and that could have prevented her from  <br/>
registering it. But, they didn&#39;t find that in the search so they let  <br/>
her register it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not finding an &quot;article&quot; with that title, but you have a nice  <br/>
page on your site with that title and we&#39;ve listed that as one of  <br/>
your talks to be given at the HSC conference. IF her trademark  <br/>
registration was upheld then, yes, it would mean you were infringing  <br/>
that copyright by using &quot;Peaceful Parenting&quot; as the title of your talk.<br/>
<br/>
Noncommercial use of someone else&#39;s trademark is usually not  <br/>
considered infringement unless that use &quot;dilutes&quot; the value of their  <br/>
copyright by making it seem more like a generic term than one that  <br/>
specifically applies to their own product.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that you used the phrase, in a similar educational/parenting  <br/>
context, before she did, and it appeared in print as the title of  <br/>
your talk, tape, and webpage (and maybe article?), could very well  <br/>
mean that a judge would rule that she should not have registered, in  <br/>
the first place, because you had a prior unregistered trademark, and  <br/>
so her use of it was actually an infringement of your unregistered  <br/>
trademark.<br/>
<br/>
Your tape was made at the 2002 HSC conference - so you did use the  <br/>
phrase before she did, in public, as a title. And you continued to  <br/>
actively use that phrase over the years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not an expert in copyright law - just reporting on what  <br/>
I could figure out by reading about the topic, online.<br/>
<br/>
Food for thought. I&#39;d talk to an attorney, if you know one willing to  <br/>
do a little consulting for free.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705859104">i&#39;m a visual artist so i know a bit about this but note also copyright can be confusing!<br/>
<br/>
as far as when a work is created its automatically copyrighted whether registered or not (see end of email) ....it being literary (being your article body no one can copy, or her book) but as far as titles/phrases i&#39;m a little sketchy even though it says below what is NOT copyrighted.....  <br/>
<br/>
look here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#wnp">http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#wnp</a><br/>
<br/>
under what is NOT copyrighted....it says <br/>
<br/>
a.. Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents<br/>
<br/>
but she is registered as of 2000 for her book with that title as well as another author with the same book title in 2002<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.loc.gov/cgi-bin/formprocessor/copyright/locis.pl">http://www.loc.gov/cgi-bin/formprocessor/copyright/locis.pl</a><br/>
<br/>
so from the appearance of it she is just trying to get you to change your article name because when you google you are the number 2 site that pops up.......and your info is FREE so its probably making an impact on her site since hers is  &quot;paid access&quot;. my opinion legally/ethically i don&#39;t think she is correct, nor would i pay her much mind. if you did respond i would bring up the issue that another author has the same title...she may think you will bow gracefully if pursued about TM. honestly i doubt if she will pursue it as it wouldn&#39;t really be a case, nor truly worth her time/money!!! if your article is from a confrence that predated that-i would suggest siting  to her that whether you are registered or not per the website- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#hsc">http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#hsc</a> <br/>
it will show her you have some knowledge and can&#39;t be bullied!<br/>
How to Secure a Copyright<br/>
Copyright Secured Automatically upon Creation<br/>
The way in which copyright protection is secured is frequently misunderstood. No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure copyright. (See following note.) There are, however, certain definite advantages to registration. See &quot;Copyright Registration.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created, and a work is &quot;created&quot; when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time. &quot;Copies&quot; are material objects from which a work can be read or visually perceived either directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books, manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm. &quot;Phonorecords&quot; are material objects embodying fixations of sounds (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CDs, or LPs. Thus, for example, a song (the &quot;work&quot;) can be fixed in sheet music (&quot;copies&quot;) or in phonograph disks (&quot;phonorecords&quot;), or both. If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part of the work that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the created work as of that date.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269361567">I am a lawyer, but not a copyright/trademark lawyer.  I looked into the law and it seems like this is a very weak trademark.  This is a similar situation to the Fox News lawsuit where they claimed sole right to &quot;fair and balanced&quot; because they registered the trademark; the judge laughed them out of court.  Registering a trademark does not automatically make it valid.<br/>
   <br/>
  A quick Google search found multiple books and articles prior to her trademark and book that use the terms peaceful parenting.  You cannot have a valid trademark on common language.<br/>
   <br/>
  Based on my quick review, I do not think she could possibly win a trademark infringement action.<br/>
   <br/>
  Also, first in time does not automatically win the deal.  I live near the semi-famous music school Interlochen.  A camp out east sued them because it had been using the name Interlochen for almost 50-years longer.  The courts ruled for the music school, because the public generally associated the name Interlochen with the music school, not the camp that used the name first.<br/>
   <br/>
  With all that said, if you do not want a potential hassle change the title.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442798231">-=-You cannot have a valid trademark on common language.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
I went and read in trademark gazette intention and approval PDF stuff  <br/>
until my head started to hurt and couldn&#39;t find out how to find out  <br/>
(other than skimming through every month for the past few years).<br/>
<br/>
I think, but am not sure, that she added the trademark mark between  <br/>
the time she first wrote to me and I went back.  And I did read in  <br/>
the laws I found that it&#39;s not illegal to use the mark prior to  <br/>
actual registration.  If she paid her $175 to register, she&#39;ll want  <br/>
to run others away.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there was something about six months for other people to  <br/>
appeal the approval, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the six months prior  <br/>
to or right after the approval.<br/>
<br/>
What I wrote to her, though, before I looked, was this, and the quote  <br/>
was probably just something stock in her sigline and not actually  <br/>
written directly to me:<br/>

If you will send me a copy of your registration documents with the  <br/>

conference.  A similar talk has been given since, as well.<br/>

<br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
If I don&#39;t hear from her in a couple of days, I think I&#39;ll write back  <br/>
and say I assume she&#39;s in the process of registration, as she didn&#39;t  <br/>
send me anything, and that she should probably add another word to  <br/>
her course&#39;s title as it&#39;s already been used by others and it&#39;s too  <br/>
common for her to own, and that I&#39;ll send an appeal if the six months  <br/>
aren&#39;t up (and quote that part).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my vague plan of the moment and other suggestions are  <br/>
welcome!  Thanks, all of you for the brainstorming.<br/>

I checked at www.whois.net<br/>
<br/>
Her particular domain has been in existence since 1999.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about the registration of the name, other than domain <br/>
name.  So basically, you can&#39;t have that as a domain name unless you <br/>
get creative...<br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;s wrong.  I&#39;m not an expert or anything, but it would <br/>
seem that it wouldn&#39;t be infringement unless you were copying what <br/>
she is selling.  Which you are not.<br/>
<br/>
Her whole gig is choice theory.  Honestly, I&#39;d think she&#39;d like the <br/>
extra advertisement to her site by having people checking you out <br/>
and running across the term &quot;peaceful parenting&quot; and then happening <br/>
upon her site.  Is she going after LLL too?  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve been <br/>

Parenting&quot; and I&#39;ll send one more thing.<br/>

=================================<br/>
<br/>
Dear Sandra,<br/>
Our certificate of registration from the US office of Patent and  <br/>
Trademark Commission is dated December 16, 2003.  You can obtain a  <br/>
copy of the certificate as it is public record.<br/>
<br/>
As you may imagine, we spent a great deal of money and time to obtain  <br/>
this trademark.  I am certainly enthusiastic about anyone who is also  <br/>
trying to help parents develop and maintain a peaceful relationship  <br/>
with thier children.  At the same time I would appreciate your  <br/>
honoring our legal ownership of the title.<br/>
<br/>
Please visit our web site, www.peacefulparenting.com where you can  <br/>
learn more about our work.  You will also see the registered  <br/>
trademark clearly displayed there.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
In peace,<br/>
