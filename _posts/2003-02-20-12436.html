We&#39;ll definitely have to go to the Jemez, though.  Everyone we <br/>
know has nothing but wonderful things to say about it.<br/>

we start the 6 or 7 day week schedule.<br/>

Sometimes you can&#39;t drive over the Valle Grande (another geological <br/>
phenomenon--a HUGE caldera) in the winter, but I have no idea how much snow, <br/>
if any, is up there.  I guess the state police could tell you if that road&#39;s <br/>
open.<br/>

Nope, it&#39;s open as far as I know.  A couple people from work drove that<br/>
route this last weekend and raved about it.  There&#39;s a little snow up<br/>
there but not much to speak of.  It&#39;s been much warmer than usual (I&#39;m<br/>
told) this winter and there seems to be less snow.  A few weeks back when<br/>
I went to El Malpais they had a sign at the ranger&#39;s station saying how<br/>
much snowfall they normally have received by this point (47&quot;) and how much<br/>
they actually received (7&quot;).  So we&#39;re a little behind in that sense.  And<br/>
there isn&#39;t much winter left, either.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s not been the best for the aquifers (understatement!), this mild<br/>
nearly snow-free winter has been pretty good for us in terms of being able<br/>
to get out and visit lots of places without much in the way of snow gear.<br/>

<br/>
We have some sweet memories of a day in Santa Fe...including the children&#39;s <br/>
museum, which was a very nice one.<br/>
The kids held a corn snake and got to build sculptures out of dried up <br/>
cactus, wires, and various materials to be auctioned off as a fund raiser for <br/>
the animal shelter there.<br/>
Some lucky soul in NM has a sculpture by Trevor!! hehe<br/>
Dh really liked that seat on a pulley thingy....<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
