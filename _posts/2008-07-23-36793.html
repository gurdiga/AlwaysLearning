<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341959461">There was a thread not too long ago and I think the subject was &quot;duty to be<br/>
happy&quot; ... or something along those lines.  My recollection is that it<br/>
talked about whether or not a parent has the responsibility to be happy, and<br/>
how a parent&#39;s happiness and joyfulness affects the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure it was on this list, and I&#39;ve searched the archives but<br/>
can&#39;t find it.  Does this ring any bells with anyone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660982020">The duty to be happy thread was on the UnschoolingDiscussion list. I think<br/>
it started in early April.<br/>
