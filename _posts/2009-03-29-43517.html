<h4>DISSER420</h4>
<time>29 Mar 2009, at  9:33am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699223243">Hi all,  Just wanted to introduce myself.  My name is Mary and I have been, for 10 years a homeschooler to 3 boys (10, 5 1/2, 19 months) along with my husband Jeff.  I have felt for a few years now that something was just not quite working.  2 1/2 years ago we moved to Costa Rica (which has been fabulous) from CT and experienced an unschooling lifestyle for about 6 months.  Then I reverted back to what society says is important and started to force the actual lessons again.  Since then we have all been getting increasingly more angry and sad.  I recently had my son in a local school which did not work out at all but was a great learning experience of what we really wanted to prioritize.  We pulled him out and have been reading a great un schooling book and have realized that this is the answer we have been looking for.  The motivation that we needed to change is upon us and we have been working really hard to make the changes we feel are important.  We really need the support and guidance of a great group that has been through it.  I imagine it will take a little time and there will be many questions for us to get to where we are headed and that is to be the best parents we can be.  I know we haven&#39;t been lately and that has just broken our hearts.  I am confident that we can make the change we so deperately need.  I look forward to all of your insight and hope you will bear with me as I adjust and ask probably too many questions:)  Thanks for having us!</div>

<br/>
Which book have you been reading?  That might be interesting to know!<br/>
<br/>
The best resources are the online ones, in my opinion, but I did enjoy<br/>
many of the John Holt books, and Grace Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;Teenage liberation<br/>
handbook&quot;.  Those, for me were the most influetial books, I know others<br/>
have had other books they could relate to more and better.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652940737">To also answer the new post by Jen, a great book I just read is Parenting a Free Child: an Unschooled Life by Rue Kream.  It took me only 2 days to read it (with 3 kids that says a lot on how easy it was to read)  It opened my eyes to so many things that we have been doing and showed me that the parents need the change for the kids sake.  It is so hard to step away from the norm and stop comparing or worrying about what is &quot;suppoed&quot; to be.  This book helped so much.  It is honestly changing my entire family for GOOD!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318179853"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Rue learned those things on the Unschooling Discussion list and at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Live and Learn conferences. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
**Well, no. I joined UD at the end of 2000 and our first conference was<br/>
the second Live and Learn a couple of years later.  We were already<br/>
living what I describe in my book by 2000. Not that I haven&#39;t learned<br/>
from email lists and conferences - I have and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll continue to<br/>
- but the larger portion of my understanding of living an unschooled<br/>
life came from interacting with and learning from my children and from<br/>
my own just-about-lifelong fascination with how and why people learn and<br/>
how children are viewed and treated. What was great for us about finding<br/>
UD, RUL, unschooling.com, the conferences, and John Holt was that we<br/>
realized we were not alone in how we saw things, where before we had<br/>
been feeling so.<br/>
 <br/>
My mom is a special education &#39;expert&#39; who is well-known in her field.<br/>
We&#39;ve been talking about and (pleasantly) arguing about learning for<br/>
much of my life.  I like to tell her she has only herself to blame that<br/>
my kids don&#39;t go to school, since she&#39;s the one who first recommended<br/>
books for me to read about brain development and learning and childhood,<br/>
which led me to think about those things all the more.  We were just<br/>
talking on Sunday about how I remember feeling while I was in school<br/>
that life had to be bigger than that.  She didn&#39;t argue with that :o).<br/>
 <br/>
I can barely remember a time I wasn&#39;t questioning and thinking about<br/>
parenting practices. I came from a large family and became an aunt for<br/>
the first time when I was 9 years old. We all lived together on one<br/>
property for years. Something about being a kid myself but being given<br/>
&#39;adult&#39; power (I was often left &#39;in charge&#39; of the kids and was<br/>
instructed that I could slap their hands as punishment) really affected<br/>
me, as did seeing that my siblings were in essence making up the rules<br/>
as they went along.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then I met Jon.  We were teenagers, and we talked a lot about what sort<br/>
of family we would want - what sort of relationships between parents and<br/>
children? What accepted wisdom seemed like nonsense? What parts of our<br/>
childhoods did we like? What didn&#39;t we like?  Not too far from childhood<br/>
ourselves, we could easily remember what felt right for us and what<br/>
didn&#39;t - what felt respectful of us as whole humans and what didn&#39;t -<br/>
and we determined that we would not forget those things, but in the end<br/>
what has always mattered most to us is what feels respectful to Dagny<br/>
and Rowan. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It&#39;s a good book, but they&#39;re not Rue&#39;s own personal revelations.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>**For me it is very much a record of my own personal revelations.<br/>
Revelations about the relationships in my family, revelations about our<br/>
place in society as a family, as children, as adults, revelations about<br/>
learning from each other and from our lives how our relationships can<br/>
best grow and flourish, revelations about my kids and myself, and<br/>
revelations about how and why the way we choose to live as a family<br/>
works for us, what it means to us, and how I think it translates on a<br/>
larger scale to how other families can live happy lives together. <br/>
 <br/>
Others had revelations about natural learning and respectful parenting<br/>
before I even had kids, of course, and I&#39;m hopeful that in the history<br/>
of the world John Holt wasn&#39;t the first and none of us reading and<br/>
writing here will be the last. <br/>

mom. She was an expert on developmentally appropriate curriculum for <br/>
preschoolers and on the negative effects of pushing academics down into <br/>
kindergarten and preschool. A HUGE proponent of delaying reading <br/>
instruction.<br/>
<br/>
I remember asking her, &quot;So what makes you think all that pushing <br/>
academics that is so harmful for 5 year olds is perfectly all right for <br/>
6 year olds? And if not for 6 year olds, why for 7 year olds.?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I never got a chance to tell Rue about this, but I was at a conference <br/>
in California (some others on this list were there and can vouch for me <br/>
on this) and we had a big huge group discussion about unschooling - <br/>
maybe 50 to  75 people involved, maybe 8 of us radical unschoolers on <br/>
the panel. It was kind of awkward to get started and someone just said, <br/>
&quot;Does anybody have any questions?&quot; And one woman said, (paraphrasing a <br/>
little, but not much), &quot;A group of us have been reading this book, <br/>
Parenting a Free Child, and, well, we just don&#39;t buy it. We don&#39;t <br/>
believe they really live that way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There were at least 4 or 5 of us sitting in the center of the room who <br/>
knew Rue and Jon and their kids and we all kind of looked at each other <br/>
and our jaws dropped. It had never occurred to me that anybody would <br/>
read it and think it was just a pack of lies. But I guess they found it <br/>
SO unbelievable that people really would choose to live this kind of <br/>
life and that it would work for them, that that was the only conclusion <br/>
they could come to.<br/>

interested in unschooling - it appealed to her. She got on the old AOL <br/>
forums and asked questions in one of the unschooling chats and she was <br/>
very impressed.<br/>

The more I learn and embrace the unschooling lifestyle the more I think who wouldn&#39;t want to live this way?  It just seems like a more natural and happy way to live.  We have such a short time that our kids are young and want to be with us, sending them off to school and exposing them to that un natural and destructive learning environment just seems wrong.  I am so glad I joined this group and have such great people willing to share their experiences with me.  I am happily on the unschooling path!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
