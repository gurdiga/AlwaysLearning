<div id="ygrps-yiv-113615723">The neighbor boy is here today.  He&#39;s kind of starved for attention and<br/>
so sometimes does things he knows will get him attention,  only not the<br/>
positive kind.<br/>
Dylan has been having a hard time with him lately.  He&#39;s been a little<br/>
mean but Dylan starts off every day hopeful that it will be one of their<br/>
good days.  He&#39;s ten, and hopeful is easy to come by.<br/>
Today Tyson was being destructive to our cactus.  He was pulling spines<br/>
out of it and stabbing them into his tongue. (ok, destructive to his<br/>
tongue too.)  I won&#39;t speculate on how weird that is.  But Dylan asked<br/>
him not to harm the cactus and when he said &quot;why not?&quot; this was my son&#39;s<br/>
answer.<br/>
 <br/>
Because our cactus needs to be fully armed and ready for the pending war<br/>
with the French.  The French are angry that we are using the term &quot;French<br/>
fries&quot; for our potatoes.  They demanded compensation, all our bologna,<br/>
and we refused.  In retaliation they are stealing all our bicycles and<br/>
turning the yellow ones into a hideous cheese they intend to market to us<br/>
in order to exact their revenge. <br/>
At this point Tyson, who is twelve, says &quot;naw, you&#39;re just pullin&#39; my<br/>
leg&quot; and Dylan says, no, it was on the news.  World News at 12.  Tyson<br/>
says - no such thing -and Dylan asks if Tyson usually watches World New<br/>
at 11, because if so, THAT&#39;s not real and haven&#39;t you ever noticed how<br/>
that guy&#39;s hair never moves and he never changes expression?  He&#39;s really<br/>
just a puppet under the control of the angry French trying to lull us all<br/>
into a stupor so we&#39;re more likely to buy and eat the deadly new French<br/>
cheese, which is really just stolen, yellow American bicycles.  They are<br/>
going to market it first at McDonald&#39;s because they believe that would be<br/>
the most direct and fastest way to get it to the population.<br/>
The cheese, so evil and deadly will turn those it doesn&#39;t immediately<br/>
kill into zombies who will willingly give up the term &quot;French fries,&quot; AND<br/>
hand over all their bologna. <br/>
By this time Tyson has forgotten entirely about the cactus.  <br/>
But, there is a chance of failure.  So their contingency plan is to<br/>
invade.  We know a secret however, and that is the French love cactus and<br/>
eat it by the hordes.  It&#39;s a delicacy over there, only NOT American<br/>
cactus which is acutely toxic to anyone who has eaten French cactus.  And<br/>
so, of course, we need our cactus.<br/>
<br/>
Tyson says...&quot;Tell another one...&quot;<br/>

There&#39;s something about sharks on surf boards right now.<br/>

P.S. Deb, may I please put in a bid for an arranged marriage between Brit<br/>
and Dylan? They&#39;re made for each other. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

he&#39;s going to stay with me forever. <br/>
At ten this is just so sweet but if he&#39;s still saying it in a few years<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There was no way I could retell in and do it justice.  The bologna bit<br/>
came about because the other boy had said &quot;that&#39;s bologna&quot; and without<br/>
hesitation it was just incorporated into the story.  I can&#39;t tell you how<br/>
funny it was.<br/>
