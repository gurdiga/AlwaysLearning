Is there a reason why he needs to write a research<br/>
paper just because he wants to research something?  I<br/>
research something new ever day but nearly never write<br/>
a paper on it....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152702654">I don&#39;t know of any websites, but I refer to my &quot;The Little, Brown Handbook&quot; if I need to be technically correct about something I&#39;m writing.  It is a grammar/writing handbook.  Has things like how to write papers, paragraphs, essays, sentences, using punctuation, when to use who or whom, how to cite references,  and much more.  I believe this is the only college textbook that has been any use to me since leaving college 14 years ago!<br/>
<br/>
This time of year, many book stores have sales on reference books.  I just did a short search and found several at half.com and ebay.<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about having a book like this is that I can look something specific up when I need to know it.  Much more useful than sitting through a class that may or may not be interesting to me or writing a paper just to learn how to write a paper.<br/>
<br/>
As another poster mentioned, how important is it that his research be in any set format?  Why not just let him gather information and present it to you as he wishes?  Taking his interests into account, he could simply tell you what he finds out, or use the info to build a webpage or do a power point presentation.  If you feel that YOU need a guideline, how about making a list of questions that you would want answered before buying the item.  You could even sit down and do the research with him.<br/>
<br/>
At one point in my homeschooling journey, I may have seen a situation like this as a &quot;learning opportunity&quot;.  But consider this, how would you feel if you wanted something and your spouse said he would only consider it if you submitted a report, written in proper format?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653248583">Mary Ellen,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my post and taking the time to respond. The Little Brown<br/>
Handbook is just what I was thinking of, and I just happen to have one!<br/>
<br/>
As far as the &quot;research report&quot; being correct, it doesn&#39;t have to be. The<br/>
report is actually at the request of my son who wants to research different<br/>
types of scooters to determine for which one he&#39;d like to save. We did<br/>
research together, but we were looking for a quick, simple worksheet for him<br/>
to write his findings.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
But consider this, how would you feel if you wanted something and your<br/>
spouse said he would only consider it if you submitted a report, written in<br/>
proper format?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn&#39;t say it had to be in proper format, but just that he wanted to<br/>
have something written to which he could refer. He likes to keep track of<br/>
things like that. He has a little written chart with all of the coins in his<br/>
coin collection so he can pull it out to determine if a coin he sees is one<br/>
he needs for his collection.<br/>
<br/>
Neither did I say that I would only consider the scooter if he &quot;submitted&quot; a<br/>
report. We&#39;ve been talking about the scooter for weeks. This is yet another<br/>
tool in that discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo...I suppose if my partner who loves and respects me and whom I love and<br/>
respect made this suggestion to me with the intention of helping me research<br/>
something that meant a lot to me and took me seriously enough to look for<br/>
tools on my behalf, I&#39;d be grateful for his attention and dedication. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
I think most of the websites or references that you&#39;ll find about &quot;research reports&quot; really emphasize how write the report.  I haven&#39;t seen much good stuff on how to *actually do the research*.  In your case, it seemed like the purpose of the research was to make a decision, so the report sounded unnecessary.  But if people like writing reports or making charts, &quot;there&#39;s nothing wrong with that&quot; &lt;g&gt;, as they say on Seinfeld.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking at a copy of Consumer Reports, even on a completely different subject, just to see how they organize the information, might be interesting to your son.  This is potentially either a source of information, or a source of inspiration about how to organize consumer information.<br/>
<br/>
A spreadsheet, with each scooter having it&#39;s own column, and each line being a product feature is the &quot;traditional&quot; way to do this.  But maybe inventing something more creative would be fun.  (The current Money magazine has a decision-tree showing how to figure out the best bundle of internet, tv and phone services.  I thought it was memorable.  YMMV.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  How about &quot;cost-benefit analysis&quot;, if a more expensive scooter might be cheaper to operate?  One more concept that can be researched and used.</div>

would have thought about Consumer Reports...well, I would have, but it would<br/>
have taken me ages. ;-)<br/>

Isn&#39;t it funny how we lose the meaning and purpose of things? Weren&#39;t<br/>
research reports originally designed for doing...um...research on stuff? :-D<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;so the report sounded unnecessary.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is anything really necessary?? Ha!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<br/>
You are right that I made assumptions based on what you said.  I apologize.  But had you explained in your original post that your child likes writing things up in order to keep track of them, I would have had different information to respond to.  Because you wrote &quot;I&#39;d like to ...&quot; and &quot;on his own&quot; it gave me the impression that he was being assigned the report in a schoolish way.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dh sometimes responds to my ideas about buying or doing something with comments along the lines of &quot;you&#39;ll need to investigate...&quot;.  I find it annoying, but that is me.  We all respond uniquely.  I *know* I need to get more information, but part of my process is to discuss the item or issue with him to help clarify my thoughts and get his input.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All the reports I wrote while I worked weren&#39;t for organizing information<br/>
but to inform *someone else* about what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
So I think what you&#39;re looking for is a way to organize the data so that he<br/>
can draw some useful conclusions from it.<br/>
<br/>
Though Consumer Reports is a report, the charts and graphs can help him see<br/>
ways of organizing data.<br/>
<br/>
Spreadsheets are useful for this. And they can create different kinds of<br/>
charts.<br/>
<br/>
Databases are good if he wants to sort the information.<br/>
