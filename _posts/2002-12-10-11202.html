<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120072654">After two inquiries and two waits, I&#39;m confirmed as a featured speaker at the <br/>
end of February in Saskatoon.  I don&#39;t have a URL yet nor any more details, <br/>
but will pass them on when I do have.<br/>

(Saskatchewan Home Based Educators), Saskatoon, Saskatchewan <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been advised by a friend in Ontario that no coat or hat I might own will <br/>
begin to suffice and that I should ask the person who picks me up from the <br/>
airport to bring outerwear I can borrow to get to the hotel, and again at the <br/>
other end, same.    Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Any one else here have other Canadian information I can use?   I&#39;ll be in a <br/>
hotel most of the weekend, and probably travelling all day Friday and Sunday <br/>
(or Monday).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56500530">[This translated through SCA channels, going to a Canadian friend who&#39;s <br/>
living in Maryland, but grew up in Lethbridge, middle of nowhere, and was <br/>
homeschooled from Jr. High on (and has a PhD in math now... )  but anyway, <br/>
the &quot;AElflaed&quot; is their translation of &quot;Sandra&quot; and the Finnvarr comment was <br/>
the one that no hat or coat I had would suffice.]<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; AElflaed&#39;s going to speak at a homeschooling conference in Saskatchewan. I <br/>
&gt; liked Finnvarr&#39;s comment to her :^)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey &#39;Flaed!<br/>
<br/>
When is this homeschooling conference?<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Finnvarr&#39;s comment (that no coat you own will be sufficient to<br/>
get you from the airport to the hotel), did I ever tell you how my parents<br/>
picked up me and Nadine at Calgary Airport the first time she came up to<br/>
see Canada and meet them (in late December)?  My father met us, helped us<br/>
get our luggage, and then went to get the car.  With the car right outside<br/>
the sliding doors he brought in a mummy-style sleeping bag.  We put Nadine<br/>
in it and carried her outside and put her in the car, then made the 2-hour<br/>
drive down from Calgary to Lethbridge.  She was flabbergasted -- she had<br/>
never seen it so cold that it was necessary to scrape the inside of the<br/>
car windshield (as the wind on the glass keeps the glass sufficiently cold<br/>
that it frosts up from the moisture in your breath).  Since no car heater<br/>
in the universe is designed to provide enough heat to warm up a VW Van<br/>
going 60mph in a 35 degree below zero environment, the resulting<br/>
windshield scrapings fly around inside the car like snow.  She couldn&#39;t<br/>
believe it.<br/>

What have we done in the last week?  Spanking/abuse, vaccinations, menstrual<br/>

trouble remembering them all . . . sigh.  We&#39;ve got a new person who<br/>
recently got thrown off the Calgary list (and real-life support group) and<br/>
is working up to causing trouble on ours.  She tried to get us going on a<br/>

her experience in SC! The cold will be NOTHING compared to a broken leg <br/>
before the conference even started! THAT should have been enough to piss <br/>
anyone off---and she was just TOO nice to everyone!<br/>
