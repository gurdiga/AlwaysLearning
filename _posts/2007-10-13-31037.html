the home.  A case in point is a young man I know who refused to go to <br/>
high<br/>
school.  He stayed home with his electronic games and gadgets staying up<br/>
until early morning with them.  After 4 years of this he took the SATs. <br/>
  He got<br/>
700 on the math, and 700 on the verbal.  And is now continuing his <br/>
college<br/>
courses with not much trouble and limited attendance.<br/>

Just on case in point.<br/>

More talking than doing.<br/>
<br/>
Hanging out with unschoolers and agreeing and nodding and smiling.<br/>
<br/>
Not actually doing those things at home with the kids, but talking  <br/>
the talk to get approval from other moms.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;doing diddly&quot; is short for &quot;not doing diddly-squat.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836579918">***I do have something against people who make a lot of pretty noise<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t been making any pretty noises lately and while we&#39;ve been <br/>
busy I have felt I&#39;m not doing enough with Dylan in the way fun.<br/>
<br/>
We spent a week or so doing maintenance at my mom&#39;s house, winter <br/>
weatherizing and stuff.  We&#39;ve been getting firewood for winter since <br/>
July, (during those times we could get into the woods)and we were <br/>
busy for a few days painting our kitchen.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a good time together, we talk and joke.  While we were <br/>
painting we listened to cassette tapes Dylan made when he was four <br/>
and five.  He was a reporter covering Godzilla&#39;s attack on Tokyo.  We <br/>
laughed until we had tears squirting out our eyeballs.  <br/>
<br/>
But generally things have been lully.<br/>
<br/>
A coworker of David&#39;s was injured.  He&#39;ll recover but David knows him <br/>
well and knows the guy who squished him and saw the accident and was <br/>
traumatized by it some.  Then, on his way home from work after a <br/>
twelve hour night shift he got smacked on the highway when a passing <br/>
car spun into his lane.  He wasn&#39;t injured but was stiff and sore for <br/>
a few days.  He&#39;s bummed about his car.  It was a free car, and it&#39;s <br/>
old, but it was reliable and got thirty five miles to the gallon so, <br/>
was a good commuter for a guy who drives a hundred fifty miles to <br/>
work, one way.  David hasn&#39;t been especially exciting at home the <br/>
last two weeks. &lt;g&gt;  Then, our good friend, Mungus, my brothers dog, <br/>
had a big seizure and died.  Mungus was our Frisbee buddy this last <br/>
year since my brothers work schedule changed and we volunteered to <br/>
walk him.  He was a big goofy Lab.  The world seems duller without <br/>
him.  <br/>
<br/>
So, Dylan and I went out for a day of fun Wednesday.  We went to the <br/>
big city, (Missoula&lt;g&gt;)  browsed the book stores, visited the comic <br/>
book store, looked at new video cameras, had breakfast and lunch and <br/>
dinner out.  It was lovely. <br/>
 <br/>
And Friday Dylan&#39;s cousin called to invite him to her family cabin <br/>
for a last lake adventure.   I wasn&#39;t feeling brave enough to get <br/>
into a kayak in that cold water but the young folks did and they got <br/>
wet (but recovered quickly) and had a great time. <br/>
<br/>
I have two things planned this week with Dylan, an outing in another <br/>
town and a rock climbing day in Refrigerator Canyon, if the weather <br/>
doesn&#39;t turn ugly.  Then we get company next week for three days.  <br/>
I&#39;m back in the mode of looking for fun things to do now though - <br/>
instead of just trying to get stuff done. &lt;g&gt;   I think it would be <br/>
easy to let a busy life outpace the fun.  This last week I&#39;ve been <br/>
rewired for fun,and boy howdy I needed it. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437244113">This one kind of hit close to home for me.  I&#39;m brand new to unschooling, and am still at the stage where I spend a lot of time questioning if I&#39;m just taking the easy way out.  Last night I got a call from my best friend who was shaking--I could hear it in her voice--with frustration over her daughter&#39;s schoolwork.  The daughter &quot;wasn&#39;t trying,&quot; &quot;is just acting dumb so she doesn&#39;t have to do her homework,&quot; and other expressions of anger.<br/>
   <br/>
  And honestly, when my daughter was in school I&#39;d often feel the same way, even knowing how smart she is, and curious about the world!  I&#39;d have to leave the room at homework time because I&#39;d get so angry.  Especially around testing time, when my daughter had to do all this review of stuff that was just to satisfy the No Child Left Behind laws, I would dread the end of the school day because for me the stress was just starting, but for my daughter it was just a continuation of the stress she was always under.<br/>
   <br/>
  And listening to my friend&#39;s anger and frustration I felt so grateful that we don&#39;t have to go through that anymore.  But this is the same friend who--bless her heart, I love her but I disagree with her--thinks that unschooling is just a cop-out, because how am I going to know my daughter is learning anything if I don&#39;t have her tested, tested, tested.  And other well-meaning friends who act like they&#39;ve never heard of such a thing as organic learning, letting my daughter&#39;s fine, curious mind take her in its most natural course to embrace the whole world.  They might not say it, but I hear in their voices the doubt, that maybe I&#39;m just being lazy, &quot;dropping out&quot; myself by allowing my daughter to &quot;drop out.&quot;<br/>
   <br/>
  So it&#39;s kind of hard for me to hear that there really are parents who use homeschooling as an excuse to do nothing.  I want to naturally rebel against such a thought because I&#39;m afraid that maybe I&#39;m kidding myself.  It is easier to unschool, when you compare it to the constant stress and frustration of homework and testing and evaluations and parent/teacher conferences.  It is easier when you don&#39;t have to dress your kids in 20 layers of clothing on a frigid winter morning just so they can trudge outside before the sun&#39;s even fully up to catch the school bus.  It&#39;s easier being able to get up when your body&#39;s rested instead of when the alarm tells you.<br/>
   <br/>
  It&#39;s a lot easier to have a day that&#39;s structured around the body and the mind&#39;s natural rhythms than some arbitrary schedule.  So does being grateful for that mean that I&#39;m just naturally lazy, that I don&#39;t want to make the effort?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi all, I am new to this list and have been watching quietly for a<br/>
couple of weeks now. I hope this first post of mine makes sense,<br/>
but I wanted to say that what I think Sandra means by &quot;making a lot<br/>
of pretty noise........and doing diddly&quot; with their kids is when<br/>
parents talk the talk, without walking the walk.  In other words, <br/>
they appear to know all about unschooling, singing its praises and <br/>
appearing to be totally committed to living an unschooling life with <br/>
their kids when they are in the company of others;but,when it boils <br/>
down to it, they tend to be too busy to answer their childrens <br/>
questions, take their children out anywhere, get down on the floor <br/>
and play games with them, make a mess with them, explore with them,<br/>
or any of the other wonderful, normal, things that make up <br/>
unschooling.  To put it bluntly, they are hypocrites, and sadly, <br/>
there are a few around, who the unschooling way of life really <br/>
appeals to because it makes things easier for them, rather than <br/>
because it is better for their kids. I speak strongly about this<br/>
because I do know of such a parent who, when in a large group, tells<br/>
a totally different story about what she and her kids do all day,<br/>
than what actually goes on (I know her well!). I think that is what<br/>
Sandra meant.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
That&#39;s what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Of another thing:<br/>
<br/>
-=-And listening to my friend&#39;s anger and frustration I felt so  <br/>
grateful that we don&#39;t have to go through that anymore. But this is  <br/>
the same friend who--bless her heart, I love her but I disagree with  <br/>

going to know my daughter is learning anything if I don&#39;t have her  <br/>
tested, tested, tested. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You might ask her how she knew her child could sit up, roll over,  <br/>
ride a bike, eat with a spoon or read.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s a lot easier to have a day that&#39;s structured around the body  <br/>
and the mind&#39;s natural rhythms than some arbitrary schedule. So does  <br/>
being grateful for that mean that I&#39;m just naturally lazy, that I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to make the effort?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it means lazy at all!  Making an effort to go against  <br/>
the body against the mind&#39;s natural rhythms seems like a lot of  <br/>
effort for bad results. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the rhythm of the day turns to sludge, though, and the  <br/>
relationship between the parent and child isn&#39;t joyous, then that  <br/>
natural learning isn&#39;t going to blossom.<br/>
<br/>
If I put tomato seeds in the ground, in New Mexico, and I mark the  <br/>
row and I say &quot;I planted tomatoes,&quot; that&#39;s all well and good.   Am I  <br/>
going to harvest tomatoes?  There are lots of considerations between  <br/>
&quot;seeds in ground&quot; and the other end of summer.   They&#39;re going to  <br/>
need a LOT of water (where I am), and there are many ways the whole  <br/>
project could go to hell.<br/>
<br/>
Some people might have hydroponic tomatoes in a greenhouse, some  <br/>
might live where the ground and the sky are so accommodating they can  <br/>
just put the seeds in the ground and go away (except that the same  <br/>
accommodations will let other plants grow up with them, so they might  <br/>
need to weed way more than I would need to do).<br/>
<br/>
Not every family&#39;s the same, but each parents needs to attend to what  <br/>
their children&#39;s unschooling needs to be lively and good and happy  <br/>
and productive, if unschooling is going to meet its promise and its  <br/>
possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone a week with nothing special happening, but that happened  <br/>
after years of lots of special.  And days off are no big deal.    <br/>
Years off, that&#39;s a problem. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
