<br/>
I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s thinking of &quot;educational&quot; as being math, science,  <br/>
history or &quot;English.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve seen of the Blue Man group (I have a video) had to do with  <br/>
music (rhythm, mood, performance, humor, acoustics/physics), theatre,  <br/>
dance, special effects.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d prefer to say that the Blue Man Group speaks to those with  <br/>
musical, spatial in interpersonal intelligence.  It&#39;s a rhythmic and  <br/>
visual experience.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the person who asserted that it was not &quot;educational&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>
understand learning very well yet or doesn&#39;t have much intelligence  <br/>
in those areas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-292481349">Ok, not really about Blue Men, but, I find it really offensive when <br/>
people clearly shun the arts as somehow less than other things.  Fine <br/>
and performing arts are never considered &quot;educational&quot;, just extra <br/>
curricular.  There is something wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just one more reason why we unschool.  Life isn&#39;t about being <br/>
split up into subjects and placing them into a heirarchy of better than <br/>
or less than.  My kids can do all the art they want or none at all.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was in school, I wished that I could&#39;ve done only art and dance <br/>
stuff.  When I look back on my high school years especially, it feels <br/>
as if I wasted all those years in classrooms when I could&#39;ve been <br/>
working on the things that I was passionate about.  Truly a waste of <br/>
teen energy. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point!  I think people try to justify it because it gets put in a <br/>
place of little value so often in our culture.  So, to find what you do <br/>
as an artist valuable in a way that isn&#39;t just for your own personal <br/>
benifit, you find ways to fit it into the society at large.<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t care at all about art things.  If you tell people you <br/>
are a dancer, most will assume that you are a stripper, not an artist.  <br/>
Art is a marginalized part of our culture.  Unless you are a rock or <br/>
movie star doing your art in that venue.</div>

<br/>
Everything is educational. I&#39;m reminded of one time when my son was <br/>
at school and in his kindergarten year (he quit school at the end of <br/>
the following year). As the children were lining up to go into the <br/>
school at the start of the day, one of the girls in my son&#39;s class <br/>
refused to go in. Her mother&#39;s way of resolving that situation was to <br/>
to tell her &quot;you have to go to school or you won&#39;t learn anything.&quot; <br/>
Unbelievable, but, yes, that&#39;s the way some grown ups have been <br/>
trained to think.<br/>
<br/>
As it happens, I&#39;d never heard of the Blue Men before, so, thanks for <br/>
that, and now I&#39;ve done my googling, I&#39;m better educated, too.<br/>
<br/>
And, now I think of it, if this kind of thing isn&#39;t &#39;educational&#39;, <br/>
why was I forced to attend theatrical productions of Shakespeare&#39;s <br/>
plays when I was at school? I would definitely have preferred the BMG.<br/>

<br/>
Uh... yeah.<br/>
One makes you think and the other is Shakespeare.<br/>

Seriously, I really like Shakespeare, but Kelly Lovejoy doesn&#39;t and I  <br/>
still very much like Kelly Lovejoy.   There are things I don&#39;t much  <br/>
like, but I still know they have great value to a lot of people  <br/>

<br/>
Shakespeare isn&#39;t the least bit educational or useful to someone who  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, or who doesn&#39;t care.  It&#39;s not at all  <br/>
useful to people who can&#39;t understand the language.  I had a head  <br/>
start, for having grown up with the King James Bible and having a big  <br/>
interest in English ballads, many of which retain older phrasing.   <br/>
But those who read what I just wrote and thought (or said, or acted  <br/>
out) &quot;eeeyew&quot; would probably not want anything to do with  <br/>
Shakespeare, and more power to &#39;em!!  I majored in English because I  <br/>
WANTED to!  I&#39;ve spent lots of money on dictionaries over the years  <br/>
because I LIKE them!<br/>

Shakespeare should be for people who just really like Shakespeare, in  <br/>

at the HSC conference in Sacramento.  One thing he said which always <br/>
stuck with me was that Shakespeare, in his time, had to write plays <br/>
that would draw in an audience whose entertainment choices also <br/>
included bear baiting and dog fights in the neighboring theater.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-469899803">Yes. Rent videos. Shakespeare is definitely better watched than read. <br/>
The old fashioned language doesn&#39;t make the reading at all easy <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But, now I think back on it, it was Shakespeare&#39;s use of language <br/>
that was promoted at my school as the reason to study his work. Most <br/>
odd. Like studying Bernie Taupin&#39;s use of language without listening <br/>
to Elton John&#39;s songs.<br/>
<br/>
Too many teachers are left-brainers, that&#39;s what I reckon.<br/>
<br/>
Found this link at my website. It only really touches on Shakespeare, <br/>
but it&#39;s an interesting read anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I come upon a Beatles song my kids don&#39;t know.  They  <br/>
know some albums and some songs really well, but the other day in my  <br/>
van that only has a tape player I put in a homemade Beatles tape that  <br/>
said Sgt. Pepper&#39;s but it also had much of The White Album.  Holly  <br/>
had never heard &quot;Julia.&quot;   It&#39;s so pretty.   Depressing, but pretty.   <br/>
And Sexy Sadie came on.  I told her the lyrics weren&#39;t all that but  <br/>
the music... really good.  And the bass line justified Paul  <br/>
McCartney&#39;s badillionaire status (not just that one song, but...)    <br/>
And just basking in the surrounds of our analysis of what made a song  <br/>
bigger or better or memorable or obscure-yet-great...  Good moment.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks back we listened to two CDs of Elton John on a road  <br/>
trip.  &quot;Daniel&quot; is one of my favorites.  Sad, again; musically  <br/>
transporting.  The words on paper wouldn&#39;t be much.<br/>
<br/>
In the 18th century when people read poetry aloud and played parlor  <br/>
music on their pianofortes, then words on paper were the best they  <br/>
could get.  The Victrola wasn&#39;t invented yet and people had to make  <br/>
their own music and their own poetry.  I LOVE that we can hear 35  <br/>
year old Elton John stuff as clear as can be.  It&#39;s fantastic that I  <br/>
can have seen the Blue Man group on video on my computer in  <br/>
Albuquerque.  I can watch Hamlet or Othello or Henry V or A Midsummer  <br/>
Night&#39;s Dream right now this morning if I want to.<br/>
<br/>
I own The Riverside Shakespeare (and a shelf of other Shakespeare- <br/>
related books), but that&#39;s not where it lives.  That&#39;s reference,  <br/>
source, dictionary--and with searchable online versions, it&#39;s not  <br/>
even the best of that anymore at all.  Sometimes I want to read a  <br/>
passage that a movie left out.  Sometimes I want to get an act/scene/ <br/>
line reference for a quote.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I always thought that Bertrand Russell gave the cool answer here,  <br/>
when he said: &quot;Shakespeare did not write with a view to boring school- <br/>
children; he wrote to with a view to delighting his audiences. If he  <br/>
does not give you delight, you had better ignore him.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
VERY cool.<br/>
<br/>
[from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://edheretics.gn.apc.org/EHT004.htm">http://edheretics.gn.apc.org/EHT004.htm</a> ]<br/>
-=-The enthusiasts for imposing learning on children in school do not  <br/>
have a good track record. There were earlier superstitions. For a  <br/>
time they tried to make all left-handed children become right-handed,  <br/>
with a heavy punishment regime. Drill was imposed as a subject on all  <br/>
children for many years. Children in Welsh-speaking areas of Wales  <br/>
were punished if they did not speak in English in school. Later  <br/>
compulsory Welsh appeared in English-speaking parts of Wales and I  <br/>
have met adults who resented this being enforced on them as children.  <br/>
And so on.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My dad was forced to write right-handed (in Texas, in the 1930&#39;s) and  <br/>
I went to school at a school where children were punished for  <br/>
speaking Spanish.  In 2nd grade we had Spanish lessons.  In 4th grade  <br/>
I saw a kid get liquid soap put on his tongue for saying something in  <br/>
Spanish to another kid.  Not long after, the same day, the teacher  <br/>
was speaking Spanish to the janitor right from the classroom door.   <br/>
By the time I was in high school, bi-lingual programs were starting  <br/>
to crop up for early elementary...<br/>
<br/>
The experts seem to agree that what they were doing before wasn&#39;t  <br/>
working; they keep changing it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bummer the link to &quot;the Inessential Shakespeare website&quot; seems to go  <br/>
to a generic page.<br/>

oooo & as an artist who has &quot;heard&quot; junk like this (art is not educational,nor an occupation you can live by) MY whole life, i have to speak. LOL i _USED_ to  want to scream!! although glady it took not long to realize some live in (different) boxes, and  some live in the world (a circle hehe) AND you can NOT make anyone see who does not WANT to see. i know it took me a long time to actually consider myself an &quot;artist&quot; i would say &quot;oh i just love to make stuff&quot;. i also remember thinking i WAS NOT an artist because i could not &quot;draw&quot; realistically enough...so i hid my art in a &quot;BOX&quot; till i decided to climb out! one i was able to do that=people saw the FREEDOM & happiness i have!! thus today i travel (the world) encouraging people simply be true be you!!   <br/>

Picasso said &quot;When I was a child, my mother said to me, &#39;If you become a soldier, you&#39;ll be a general. If you become a monk you&#39;ll end up as the pope.&#39; Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and this!!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Each second we live is a new and unique moment of the universe, a moment that will never be again. And what do we teach our children? We teach them that two and two make four, and that Paris is the capital of France. When will we also teach them what they are? We should say to each of them: Do you know what you are? You are a marvel. You are unique. In all the years that have passed, there has never been another child like you. Your legs, your arms, your clever fingers, the way you move. You may become a Shakespeare, a Michelangelo, a Beethoven. You have the capacity for anything. Yes, you are a marvel. And when you grow up, can you then harm another who is, like you, a marvel? You must work, we must all work, to make the world worthy of its children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
anyhow so i usually respond....&quot;even if you only &quot;learn&quot; from text books, it is FILLED with art (photography,design,illustrations,writing etc)so ALL ART is educational (and extremely important!)!!&quot;<br/>

  &gt; Ok, not really about Blue Men, but, I find it really offensive when <br/>
  &gt; people clearly shun the arts as somehow less than other things. Fine <br/>
  &gt; and performing arts are never considered &quot;educational&quot;, just extra <br/>
  &gt; curricular. There is something wrong with that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Back in the late 1950s-early 1960s at my first school in London, we <br/>
were all given nibbed pens to write with that you had to dip in an <br/>
inkwell in the desk, but we were allowed to use our own pen as long <br/>
as it was a fountain pen (and the ink was of the approved colour). <br/>
The new fangled ballpoint pen that was then becoming popular was <br/>
strictly forbidden. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a left-hander. Because writing left-handed normally from left to <br/>
right with a nibbed pen or fountain pen smeared the ink, I had to <br/>
curl my hand around the top of what I was writing. I had this awkward <br/>
writing style for many years until it became normalised at high <br/>
school, where the use of a ballpoint pen was permitted.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that reminds me of something else that happened at my first <br/>
school. In my final year, I had a teacher that I had a very positive <br/>
relationship with. Admittedly, I was one of her pet pupils, so maybe <br/>
that influenced my high opinion of her. There was a girl in our class <br/>
who had been to America on a family vacation - to us in those days, <br/>
that was an expedition to a far off land - in particular, to New <br/>
Orleans. She was asked by our teacher to tell the story to the class. <br/>
Our teacher preceded that, however, by informing us that New Orleans <br/>
was named after the French city of Orlean, home of Joan of Arc, etc, <br/>
which is pronounced Or-lay-on. Then the girl started her story of her <br/>
family&#39;s visit to New Orleans. Except every time the girl said &quot;New <br/>
Orleans&quot;, the teacher corrected her with &quot;Or-lay-on&quot;. So the girl was <br/>
going &quot;When we landed at the airport in New Orleans&quot;...&quot;Or-lay-<br/>
on&quot;...&quot;When we landed at the airport in New Or-lay-on&quot;, like that <br/>
through the entire story. And every time the teacher &#39;corrected&#39; her, <br/>
it made it more difficult for the girl to tell her story and more <br/>
irritating for the rest of us to listen to it. We may not have known <br/>
much about America, but we knew New Orleans was called New Orleans. I <br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve lost respect for anybody quite as quickly as I lost <br/>
respect for that teacher that day. Over just that one incident.<br/>
