<div id="ygrps-yiv-235813860">Hello! Just wanted to introduce myself. I&#39;m Marcie and unschool my 8<br/>
year old son. We are in Massachusetts and I am always scared that our<br/>
school district will give us a hard time, try  to test him, etc. How do<br/>
you all get around your state laws to really, truly unschool in freedom?<br/>
My husband comes from a family of school teachers and they are REALLY<br/>
driving me crazy...<br/>

find in your own state.<br/>

I&#39;m going to quote the germ of that statement:<br/>

-=-I am always scared-=-<br/>
<br/>
Breathe deep breaths in and out when you think of it, and try to  <br/>
think of it more often.<br/>
<br/>
Massachusetts does have more laws than any two states put together  <br/>
need, but there are lots of people there doing this, and there will  <br/>
be a conference in Peabody in May.  You should hook up with those  <br/>
people and plan to go!  (See the first link above.)<br/>
<br/>
Meeting other unschoolers will boost your confidence, as will reading  <br/>
and trying lots of the ideas you find.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually the case law isn&#39;t too bad it&#39;s just that each town can make  <br/>
it&#39;s own interpretation. And if there&#39;s just one homeschooler in a  <br/>
town it can feel intimidating to tell the authorities that they&#39;re  <br/>
asking too much.<br/>
<br/>
The two secular state groups are:<br/>
<br/>
Massachusetts Home Learning Association<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mhla.org/">http://mhla.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ahem.info/">http://www.ahem.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
They both have articles on how to approach the case laws. I know MHLA  <br/>
has an emai list. Not sure about AHEM.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983732722">My Dh and his sis are both ps teachers and she is very involved with Jocelyn have kinda been those voices.  What I do to allay questions is that every few weeks I enthusiastically tell her what Jocelyn has been doing...such as oh...she&#39;s been writing her numbers to 100 and beyond and we are reading Peter Pan and she begs for it...and we are doing tons of phonics and usually sil is very satisfied.  I don&#39;t tell her that I let my daughter initiate and that we are no longer doing math worksheets...oh she&#39;d flip!<br/>
