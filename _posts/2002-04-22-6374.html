<div id="ygrps-yiv-496404416">Vets don&#39;t talk about this much. Believe me, there are dedicated people out<br/>
there who love animals, are good businesspersons, and have great people<br/>
skills, and if you can find one, hang on to her/him! I don&#39;t have or want<br/>
the business skills, and so never pursued my own practice, but I burned out<br/>
on animals. It&#39;s taken a year to enjoy them again and I actually own two<br/>
dogs now. For the last three years I worked in a high-volume<br/>
general/specialty/emergency/24 hour hospital and you have to be an<br/>
adrenaline junkie. It&#39;s much more business and dealing with people than it<br/>
is loving animals and that&#39;s what I try to impress on young people who want<br/>
to go into the profession. I also tell them they *must* work in a practice<br/>
before they commit. It helps to weed out the idealistic ones.<br/>
<br/>
Hiring an office manager? Even single-person practices have one, along with<br/>
a couple of receptionists, a couple of techs, and a kennel person. That&#39;s<br/>
minimum. Starting salaries for associates are often in the $40K range, and<br/>
it&#39;s the rare vet, owner *or* associate, who can ever make over $100K.<br/>
Happens occasionally now, but the ones I know who are well off have other<br/>
sources of income, or work two jobs. So don&#39;t go into it for the money! :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I talk with teens (mostly girls) that want to veterinarians when they grow<br/>
 </span></blockquote>up. I ask why they want to be vets. Inevitably they answer, &quot;Because I just<br/>
LOOOOOVE animals!&quot; It&#39;s hard to explain how the time you actually spend<br/>
PLAYING with the animals is very small---most of their time will be<br/>
inflicting pain on their patients. They hardly ever see healthy, happy<br/>
pooches that smother them with kisses. Of course there&#39;s all the paperwork<br/>
(unless you&#39;re interested in hiring an office manager to share in your<br/>
profits) and all the bitching from patients about how high your prices are.<br/>
There&#39;s the tremendous expense of starting a practice (before or after you<br/>
pay off those student loans?)---and then, after working all day on ugly,<br/>
sick<br/>
animals, you get to come home to your own critters----which you&#39;re really<br/>
don&#39;t want to deal with because the LAST thing you want to see at the end of<br/>
the day is ANOTHER DOG!&lt;&lt;</div>
