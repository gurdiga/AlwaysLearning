<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700169064">I am needing some help getting through fit throwing and lack of sleep.<br/>
First, since I don&#39;t post a ton, I will remind you all that I have an almost<br/>
12 year old and an almost 18 mo old.  I am very new to the respectful<br/>
parenting style let alone unschooling.  I am sure my issues are not unique<br/>
and I am not here to whine and complain, just to get some suggestions on how<br/>
I can better handle some situations.  Our family goal is peace which<br/>
incorporates mutual respect so in each instance I am wanting to respect<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs.  I will try to be as complete as possible without making<br/>
this email too long.<br/>
 <br/>
First issue, throwing fits.  I say fits because these are not tantrums where<br/>
he throws himself down kicking and screaming.  It is more like screaming and<br/>
crying so hard he gags.  He does this any time he does not get his way.  The<br/>
biggest fits come when he is not ready to get in the car after being<br/>
somewhere...anywhere.  If we have a choice of staying longer, we usually do<br/>
but there comes a time we have to leave and so ensues the fit.  Other major<br/>
fit times are diaper changes.  He doesn&#39;t always cry to the point of gagging<br/>
and he doesn&#39;t always throw a fit but it is often enough that I have either<br/>
just let him wear the wet dipe for much longer than I like or just take it<br/>
off and prolong putting another on.  I have even thought about doing EC but<br/>
I am not disciplined enough to do that plus my dh would freak...lol.<br/>
Another time he throws fits is when he wants to be in the kitchen with me<br/>
and I have to repeatedly tell him not to touch things to the point I cant<br/>
get anything done.  I have tried putting him in the carrier and wearing him<br/>
and I have tried putting him at the table with crayons and such but he wants<br/>
to be down so he can touch things the only thing else I know to do is put<br/>
him in the living room where everything is safe and he can still see me and<br/>
I can still talk to him and such.  When I do that he throws a fit.  I hope<br/>
this is good enough description but if you have questions please ask.<br/>
Otherwise, please suggest things that have worked for you or that you have<br/>
known to work for other people.  <br/>
 <br/>
Second issue, lack of sleep.  I am not talking about Aden, its me.  Aden was<br/>
on a routine of sleeping by around 8 or so but gradually that has turned<br/>
into around 11:30 or so.  We do dinner, playtime, bath, nakey playtime,<br/>
books, bottle, rocking, bed (or at least that is how it used to be).  Now,<br/>
after bottle he wants down to play then about 30 min later he wants back up<br/>
and acts like he is going to go to sleep but then he pops his head up and is<br/>
ready to play again and about 30 min later again wanting to rock.  This<br/>
pattern goes on for however long with me getting frustrated all the while<br/>
because I know what time I need to get up the next morning to either get<br/>
Seth somewhere or heaven forbid I get to go to the Y and work out.  Not only<br/>
does he stay up for what feels like forever, he tosses and turns most of the<br/>
night sometimes which causes even less sleep for me.  We are to a point<br/>
where Seth can go to bed pretty much whenever as long as he is in bed when<br/>
we are (I am not ready to let go more than that yet...key word yet).  With<br/>
Aden I cant just go to bed and leave him to play which means I am getting<br/>
more and more sleep deprived and more and more depressed about everything.<br/>
I cant sleep during the day when he takes a nap because that is the only<br/>
time I have to work my home biz.  I want him to learn his own body and such<br/>
yet I need at least 8 hrs of sleep...10 is actually better for me but 8<br/>
works okay too.  So how do I encourage him to learn his own body and his own<br/>
sleep needs while also getting my own sleep needs met or is that a pipe<br/>
dream?<br/>

<br/>

Several steps BEFORE his final move, you need to change your strategy.<br/>

<br/>
Help from this group will come as help from this group comes.  Most  <br/>
likely people will have ideas about how changes in your point of view  <br/>
and relationship with him will make the difference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you change his diaper or pick him up from places to bring him  <br/>
home, do you focus on him, and sing and smile and make it all happy  <br/>
and nice?   Maybe you&#39;ve tried that, but I&#39;ve seen some moms be  <br/>
businesslike and matter-of-fact and it seems harsh from the  <br/>
beginning.  Maybe this doesn&#39;t apply, but if it even nearly applies,  <br/>
please consider moving more toward fun and sweetness in his favor.<br/>
<br/>
Also there are other lists that might help.  One&#39;s about young  <br/>
children, and one is for beginning unschoolers.  You&#39;re welcome to  <br/>
stay here too, but this list is intended to be for established  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
He gets older every day.  These problems will go away with time.<br/>
Can you let your home business go for a while and spend more time  <br/>
with him?<br/>

<time>27 Jun 2006, at  9:28am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436832258">Two things come to mind quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One:  are you talking to him and reminding him that a transition is coming<br/>
soon so he can internalize it? Let him know 15 min., 10, min, and 5 minutes<br/>
before you leave that you are going to leave and then give him something to<br/>
look forward to where you are going next.  If it&#39;s home, remind him of<br/>
something he loves that is at home etc.  I know he&#39;s little but so many<br/>
people underestimate their kids ability to understand and so they don&#39;t even<br/>
bother to try to reason with them or talk with them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Two:  What is in the kitchen that he cannot touch?  Why not child proof the<br/>
kitchen?  I still have plastic cups and bowls in a low cupboard.  They&#39;ve<br/>
been there since the kids were little because A. they couldn&#39;t break them if<br/>
they wanted to play with them.  B. they could get them themselves without<br/>
climbing on the cupboard.  The cupboards that had cleaning supplies in them<br/>
I put a child lock on or moved to a higher cupboard.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It also sounds like he doesn&#39;t feel listened to.  I know that people have<br/>
different levels of interpersonal skill but if you are paying close<br/>
attention to him, you should see the signs of neediness before it becomes a<br/>
full blown temper tantrum.  Let him stand on a chair and help you do some<br/>
things that are safe.   Playing in the sink was always a favorite or washing<br/>
lettuce or potatoes or something.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I remember my sil&#39;s kids throwing huge tempter tantrums and she would give<br/>
them a time out or a swat and it drove me NUTS because you could see the kid<br/>
asking politely for attention a million times before he had a fit.  She<br/>
couldn&#39;t see it because she was too busy doing other things but I could see<br/>
it coming a million miles away.  I always felt so bad for the kids because<br/>
they got punished for it when all they wanted was some eye contact and<br/>
someone to validate their feelings and listen to them for a minute or even<br/>
something so simple as a drink that they asked for ten times and no one<br/>
heard them.  I began to interrupt her eventually and point out that the kids<br/>
needed her for something to prevent it.  If she addressed their issue it<br/>
never happened.    Some kids just need a lot of time in arms too and just<br/>
because you feel like you&#39;ve held them all day doesn&#39;t mean that they feel<br/>
like they&#39;ve had enough.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard when they are little and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s even harder when you are<br/>
trying to meet the needs of different aged kids.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
OH, and one more thing.  Stop counting how many hours of sleep you got.  I<br/>
used to do that and it just set me up to have an excuse to get short<br/>
tempered when I got tired.  How much do you need the extra income from the<br/>
part time job?  More than you need sleep?  What can you live without to make<br/>
up for it?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835138755">~~~But they don&#39;t come unexpectedly. Blaming him and labelling him and<br/>
his actions won&#39;t solve the problem.<br/>

 <br/>
I am not blaming or labeling, just trying to describe what he does, thinking<br/>
this would help obtain ideas of doing just what you suggest...changing my<br/>
strategy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~He throws a fit WHILE he&#39;s in a carrier? Do you have a backpack<br/>
hiking carrier?~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I have an Ergo carrier and he throws a fit when I am trying to put him in it<br/>
- showing me he doesn&#39;t want to be there so of course I try other things.<br/>
He would probably do better &quot;being worn&quot; in these situations if we were both<br/>
more used to it but sadly we aren&#39;t and he usually would rather be down<br/>
exploring.<br/>
<br/>
~~~Help from this group will come as help from this group comes. Most<br/>
likely people will have ideas about how changes in your point of view<br/>
and relationship with him will make the difference~~~<br/>
 <br/>
This is what I am expecting.  I treasure the changes in perspective I have<br/>
gained so far :)<br/>
<br/>
~~~When you change his diaper or pick him up from places to bring him<br/>
home, do you focus on him, and sing and smile and make it all happy<br/>
and nice?  Maybe this doesn&#39;t apply, but if it even nearly applies,<br/>

 <br/>
I do that some but do see room for improvement.  Thank you for reminding me<br/>
of that :)<br/>
 <br/>
~~~Also there are other lists that might help. One&#39;s about young<br/>
children, and one is for beginning unschoolers. You&#39;re welcome to<br/>
stay here too, but this list is intended to be for established<br/>
unschoolers.~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Could you send me the links or names of those groups as I have not been able<br/>
to find them in doing a search?  I am already a member of unschoolingbasics<br/>
if this is one you were thinking of.  I wasn&#39;t terribly sure which group to<br/>
post to.  I will keep that in mind for future posts.<br/>
<br/>
~~~Maybe find a girl who lives near you to come and play with him while<br/>
you&#39;re working so he doesn&#39;t take a nap. Are you &quot;putting him down&quot;<br/>
for a nap or does he just sleep when he&#39;s sleepy?~~~<br/>
 <br/>
There aren&#39;t any kids in the area that are old enough to watch him.  I do<br/>
not &quot;put him down for a nap,&quot;  he lets me know when he is sleepy during the<br/>
day, we rock and he falls asleep.  I then put him in &quot;his&quot; bed (twin next to<br/>
ours) and he sleeps as long or as little as he wants.<br/>
<br/>
~~~He gets older every day. These problems will go away with time.<br/>
Can you let your home business go for a while and spend more time<br/>
with him?  Needy children need more of mom, not less.~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I know this and thanks for the reminder.  I only work on my home biz while<br/>
he sleeps during the day.  Otherwise, I spend time with both boys as much as<br/>
possible.  Maybe I do just need to let it go and spend more time with him<br/>
even during his naps and get some sleep as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

 <br/>
As a matter of fact I haven&#39;t been consistent in doing this and I think it<br/>
is for the reason you stated.  Thank you for reminding me!  <br/>
<br/>
~~~Two: What is in the kitchen that he cannot touch? Why not child proof the<br/>
kitchen? I still have plastic cups and bowls in a low cupboard. They&#39;ve<br/>
been there since the kids were little because A. they couldn&#39;t break them if<br/>
they wanted to play with them. B. they could get them themselves without<br/>
climbing on the cupboard. The cupboards that had cleaning supplies in them<br/>
I put a child lock on or moved to a higher cupboard.~~~<br/>
 <br/>
we currently live with my fil and I have childproofed and moved everything I<br/>
can in this house.  the kitchen is pretty much off-limits as there isn&#39;t<br/>
much room to move things where they are at a safe distance nor is my fil<br/>
flexible enough to have things moved around.  we have our half of the house<br/>
(living room, bathroom and 2 bedrooms) that he can go but the areas that are<br/>
my fil&#39;s domain are not to be touched.  I would love to have a cupboard for<br/>
him, I had one for Seth when he was little (in our own place).   The thing<br/>
he gravitates to in the kitchen is the stove.<br/>
<br/>
~~~It also sounds like he doesn&#39;t feel listened to. I know that people have<br/>
different levels of interpersonal skill but if you are paying close<br/>
attention to him, you should see the signs of neediness before it becomes a<br/>
full blown temper tantrum. Let him stand on a chair and help you do some<br/>
things that are safe. Playing in the sink was always a favorite or washing<br/>
lettuce or potatoes or something.~~~<br/>
 <br/>
It may sound like I am shooting down your ideas here but I really wish it<br/>
were possible to implement these things.  The kitchen is so very small that<br/>
having a chair out by the sink would block access to the fridge and actually<br/>
access to the sink for me.  This is why I have tried using the carrier (hip<br/>
carry position) so he can help do things but he just wants down.  maybe I<br/>
just need to figure out how to get dinner made without being in the kitchen<br/>
for very long at a time?<br/>
<br/>
~~~I remember my sil&#39;s kids throwing huge tempter tantrums and she would<br/>
give<br/>
them a time out or a swat and it drove me NUTS because you could see the kid<br/>
asking politely for attention a million times before he had a fit.~~~<br/>
 <br/>
this sounds like my sisters, sad but true.  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~Some kids just need a lot of time in arms too and just because you feel<br/>
like you&#39;ve held them all day doesn&#39;t mean that they feel like they&#39;ve had<br/>
enough.~~~<br/>
 <br/>
this is why I got the carrier, thinking it would help but so far he hasn&#39;t<br/>
wanted to be in it much.  I am thinking about taking walks in the evening<br/>
with him in the carrier (as long as he wants to) so we can both get used to<br/>
it more.<br/>
<br/>
~~OH, and one more thing. Stop counting how many hours of sleep you got. I<br/>
used to do that and it just set me up to have an excuse to get short<br/>
tempered when I got tired.~~~<br/>
 <br/>
It is not really the hours of sleep, it is the feeling of always being tired<br/>
and completely worn out due to lack of sleep.  When I get quality sleep even<br/>
a couple of nites a week, I am fine but several nights/weeks of very little<br/>
are starting to take their toll.  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~How much do you need the extra income from the<br/>
part time job? More than you need sleep? What can you live without to make<br/>
up for it?~~~<br/>
 <br/>
As far as needing the income, we are trying desperately to get out of debt<br/>
so we can get out of my fil&#39;s house and have our own.  We have no &quot;extras&quot;<br/>
to cut out, believe me, I have tried and tried to figure out how to get out<br/>
of this house.  I have also tried and tried to figure out how to change my<br/>
perspective about living here and make it more kid friendly but I am up<br/>
against a man who is set in his ways and thinks I am spoiling the kids and<br/>
not strict enough as it is.<br/>
 <br/>
I really appreciate the thoughts and ideas and I will try to implement them<br/>
as much as possible.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513423066">While cooking we use a learning tower that works GREAT for our young<br/>
children. We give them the exact ingredients that we are using and lots of<br/>
impliments, tools, bowl etc. They cook too! At 18 mo my son would open tea<br/>
bags, peel garlic and joyfully taste all the bits and pieces we were<br/>
preparing. Try fully including him in cooking. Make simple meals, forget<br/>
about a mess and really explore WITH him. Put on fun music and have a glass<br/>
of wine and make it a party. Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125178660">-=-we currently live with my fil-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are real requirements for unschooling to work (even though in  <br/>
my opinion with a baby we&#39;re not talking about unschooling, really).   <br/>
One is that the parents have a living space in which they can build  <br/>
their unschooling nest, as it were.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/nest">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>
<br/>
When living in someone else&#39;s house, there are limits.  If a  <br/>
fundamentalist Christian family was living with me, they wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
spanking their kids, because it&#39;s my house.  They would need to get  <br/>
their own house before they could be washing ANY child&#39;s mouth out  <br/>
with soap in a house belonging to someone who doesn&#39;t believe in it  <br/>
and wants it to stop.<br/>

maybe.<br/>
<br/>

carry position) so he can help do things but he just wants down. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can find a frame backpack. We used one up and got a second  <br/>
one.  That way the kids are tall and can see all around and can touch  <br/>
you with their bellies and hands and you can talk to them and still  <br/>
move both your arms fully.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is not really the hours of sleep, it is the feeling of always  <br/>
being tired<br/>
and completely worn out due to lack of sleep. When I get quality  <br/>
sleep even<br/>
a couple of nites a week, I am fine but several nights/weeks of very  <br/>
little<br/>
are starting to take their toll.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Find tricks that work for you.  Deep breathing and relaxation  <br/>
exercises that you can do while you&#39;re doing other things could  <br/>
help.  Affirmations can help.  You can find ways to perk up�washing  <br/>
your face, maybe caffeine (or not, if you don&#39;t want that), singing,  <br/>
brisk walks, humor...   But in any case, feeling sorry for yourself  <br/>
will make you more fatigued.  Making excuses will make you feel put- <br/>
upon.  I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s nothing to feel sorry about, but in  <br/>
each and every moment you have choices to make.<br/>
<br/>
This might help:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553512559">Hi Christy,<br/>
<br/>
Your living situation is definitely a main issue here and needs to be<br/>
rethought, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Fwiw, we lived with my fil for 3 months when my two oldest were 2 and 1 (15<br/>
years ago). I found that we primarily had to utilize our &quot;private space&quot; for<br/>
freedom, and I avoided the shared spaces as much as possible. I did it with<br/>
joy and fun and adventure, and my kids had no idea they were missing<br/>
anything like &quot;dinner time&quot;. At 18 mo., maybe you don&#39;t have to make dinner<br/>
for anyone? Can you have this period of time be &quot;serve yourself if you&#39;re<br/>
old enough&quot; and you do the least amount of kitchen time while you&#39;re living<br/>
there? It sounds like your living situation is temporary (yay!), so maybe<br/>
you just need to rethink how to do things so that they are best for your<br/>
little guy. Include your 12 yo in the process too...see what he/she is<br/>
feeling and what may help them too.<br/>
<br/>
I *hear* the internal struggle you seem to have...you want to have some<br/>
order and dependable time and that is interrupted by both your living<br/>
situation and your son&#39;s needs. If you could let every little thing go for a<br/>
moment in your mind...every expectation you have of yourself in the<br/>
day...and think about what your son&#39;s day would look like if it was all<br/>
about him...what would it look like? How can you make his life as close to<br/>
that as possible?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much easier to change your life than to change his. His needs are<br/>
definitive and absolute. Yours are really more of a convenience than a<br/>
necessity. Flexibility is a key.<br/>

teenagers engage in their great love of late-night board games :oD<br/>
Definitely worth a little sleep deprivation</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038859178">Haven&#39;t had time to read all the other responses so forgive any redundancy!<br/>
   <br/>
  My kitchen is pretty safe, and maybe yours could be too.  Giving him something he CAN play with may prevent him from finding things he can&#39;t.  Ada likes pots, measuring cups, measuring spoons, wooden spatulas/spoons, a collander, etc<br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t have too much success babywearing in the kitchen either just because there isn&#39;t enough movement/action for Ada, since she got to be a toddler.<br/>
   <br/>
  Diaper changes: when Ada started walking, she started hating lying down for a change.  I have cloth dipes that snap on the sides.  I started snapping them up first (or snapping one side) then sticking her legs through the holes while she is standing and pulling them up her.  So if she is wet and running around, I get her to hold still standing up, unsnap and whip away the old dipe, wipe her with a washcloth, pull the new dipe up, and off she goes.  She does not seem to mind being held still standing up, and I always talk to her while doing it.  It has worked wonders!  I do also EC, by the way ;-)<br/>
   <br/>
  Leaving the park: It helps tremendously with my toddler to say, &quot;we have to go home now.  Say bye-bye to the swings,&quot; and let her pat the swings.  When she says, &quot;Swings!&quot; in a longing voice, I say, &quot;yes, you did some good swinging, didn&#39;t you?  And you went down the red slide, and we had lots of fun doing . . . &quot; etc.  So we talk about having played as we walk to the car, and we say good-bye, and we might talk about where we&#39;re going next, or what fun toy is in the car to play with, or a snack or juice, etc.<br/>
   <br/>
  Good luck!<br/>

Christy,<br/>
 <br/>
I am a bit late on this however I wanted to offer a couple  suggestions.<br/>
My children are 14, 6, 4 and 2 so I&#39;ve been through some of what you  explain <br/>
and one I just crossed over from:).. <br/>
Diaper changes being the first thought. Try changing him standing. I  rarely <br/>
had the change struggle doing this. I watch parents trying to keep  their kids <br/>
laying down and it&#39;s pure stress and really a parent/child struggle  that&#39;s <br/>
unnecessary esp for boys..<br/>
 <br/>
As far as the kitchen it sounds that by implementing the &quot;rules&quot;  in  the <br/>
kitchen this may have created more of an issue. In our home nothing is off  <br/>
limits. I understand you are not in your own home and that is a challenge for  all <br/>
including your unschooling goal. By not creating rules to be challenged  there <br/>
is less time spent trying to find out what all the fuss is about.<br/>
 <br/>
Off limits to a child can mean everything but do not touch. Their brains  are <br/>
in explore mode, they want to know and see. I understand the carrier however  <br/>
I doubt that it just being newly implemented is going to work. Being safe is  <br/>
important though I also see it as confining a child who doesn&#39;t want to be  <br/>
there. Weather it&#39;s a happy carrier or a leash/harness it&#39;s still a restraint  <br/>
&quot;IF&quot; they are not wanting to be in it.<br/>
 <br/>
 My Cameron is 26 mo now and we just passed the being one-to-all  hurdle. I <br/>
DO remember trying to cook dinner while he wanted to be held or  was fussy. <br/>
When my solutions failed I simply stopped making dinner until DH  came home to <br/>
take over the cooking or the baby. Pre-cooking works  too.<br/>
 <br/>
As for your sleep..zzz I do hear you also. I have four so the best way for  <br/>
me to get what I need to get done and have that little more time with the  <br/>
older&#39;s is to stay up later. I also have a business at home.. we raise and/or  <br/>
breed 6 Brittany (spaniels), I do their shots, training, breeding, baths, food,  <br/>
new customer interviews and pick up, web site design/photo&#39;s ,banking and so <br/>
on  between the four kids and my DH wants /needs/hopes and dreams AND MINE. I <br/>
do  what I can at night time. I also have a web site for unschooling and two <br/>
lists I  maintain. So I hear you! If your business is helping your finances I <br/>
get that  too. I realize there are people who put their money above their family <br/>
but when  struggling to survive or get out of a hole it can be frustrating. <br/>
Do what  you can in time the rest will come. <br/>
 <br/>
You said he drinks a bottle,, Can you offer the bottle to DH so you  can do <br/>
the things to finalize the day? <br/>
Is it possible to stay up later? If you are still in bed in the am will the  <br/>
18 mo old sleep longer? <br/>
 <br/>
In the end you are talking about an 18 mo and unschooling him. There are  <br/>
many things that can follow(mock) unschooled parenting. You need to figure  out <br/>
what works for this child.<br/>
 I also know that unschooling in this situation mixed with  the age may be <br/>
sending him mixed messages which I suspect is where you  are getting an upset <br/>
child. <br/>
 <br/>
I wonder where the 11 yo comes into play? You didn&#39;t mention him?<br/>

<br/>
With an 18 month old the most we can really be talking about is  <br/>
attachment parenting, mindful parenting.  No jurisdiction requires  <br/>
school of an 18 month old, so he&#39;s not &quot;not in school,&quot; he&#39;s home  <br/>
with his mom.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s not talk about mock unschooling, though.  Let&#39;s talk about  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think the AlwaysUnschooled list or an attachment parenting list  <br/>
would be more appropriate for questions about babies.  Yes, we&#39;ve all  <br/>
had babies, but ther are other things we&#39;ve all known and done that  <br/>
aren&#39;t appropriate to an unschooling discussion too, so I&#39;m  <br/>
uncomfortable going more deeplyinto toddler details.<br/>
<br/>
The principles, though, we could discuss.  Parents can&#39;t make  <br/>
decisions about parenting if the space isn&#39;t theirs.  When they&#39;re in  <br/>
imperfect surroundings, the children will need more one-on-one, more  <br/>
touch, more escape (take them out of the house and get in neutral  <br/>
territory more) than they would need if the house was really, truly  <br/>
theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s a better thing to discuss.<br/>
