<div id="ygrps-yiv-907134971">Hello everyone! My name is Kristie and I am new to the group.I&#39;m so excited to find a group of like-minded people to share with.My husband James and I have 3 kiddos Jaclyn 6,Israel4,and Javen 14mo.We also care for my 2 younger sisters Ashley 16 and Shannon 8.All of our  kids are homeschooled(unschooled) including Ashley.We have been handling her schooling for 2 yrs-I&#39;m still working on my mother to allow us to take Shannon out of public school too! We have seen wonderful things living this way and our kids continue to impress people wherever they go.People are absolutely amazed when they find out how we school.This is a mission for us.We have seen such wonderful fruit from raising our children this way that we want the world to know!We are determined that just by living this example LOUDLY people will be convinced that this is indeed the way to go.We are normal everyday, ok well maybe not everyday folks ..but we ARE normal.But most importantly our kids are smart,and it&#39;s all because we love them and let them live.OK I&#39;m getting down off of my soap box now ! LOL I look forward to getting to know you all.<br/>
