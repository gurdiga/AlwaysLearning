<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898115709">Ren Allen&#39;s family is in People Magazine, the 5/22/06 issue (Brooke  <br/>
Shields cover), page 141, about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Ren comments on it in her blog, here:<br/>

It&#39;s fun to see how big their yard is.  I had seen a photo of the  <br/>
other side of the house.  The article isn&#39;t as bad as some I&#39;ve seen,  <br/>
but the title is BIG and says &quot;Is This Any Way to Learn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have mixed feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1383784217">Funny thing...I was on page 134 of my People magazine just tonight, reading<br/>
about kids serving the community, not knowing anything about the article on<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Then I read your email Sandra. I went right to it.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a great article...particularly compared to some of the<br/>
press happening here locally in Phoenix. The title sucks, but that&#39;s really<br/>
the only downfall I think. Ren&#39;s and Maureen&#39;s family examples are fabulous,<br/>
and recognized positively in the article...it would DEFINITELY interest me<br/>
if I was seeking an alternative for my schooled or even homeschooled<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Ren to you and your family for opening your home and lives to People<br/>
Magazine, and their HUGE distribution. Your representation of unschooling<br/>
was really beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Jacki, who also loves Ren&#39;s yard :o)<br/>
