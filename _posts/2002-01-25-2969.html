<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339842669">&quot; The person of conscience, deeply committed to a radical change in <br/>
human civilizationfrom a dangerous, unsustainable social order to a <br/>
veritable garden for our children and grandchildrenmust be willing <br/>
to risk being considered a whiner by polite society. The nonviolent <br/>
revolutionary has a responsibility to be a thorn in the side of a <br/>
complacent status quo. The person of conscience holds up a mirror to <br/>
the world, which must include him or herself. The lover of humanity <br/>
is an agent of awakening, in a world where there is a collective urge <br/>
to sleep. &quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752256436">To Ren, and Anne--thanks for seeing me in that passage.  <br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine I hadn&#39;t talked to for a while asked me the other day what I <br/>
had been up to.  I said something like, &quot;Oh, changing people&#39;s lives.&quot;  He&#39;s <br/>
a priest, and has known me for 24 years or so, so he was neither unaccepting <br/>
nor skeptical of the report, and he just nodded and smiled.<br/>
