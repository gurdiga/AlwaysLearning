<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517517929">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
First, thanks for your thoughts on my leaving-the-pool difficulty.   Ollie and I seem to still be pals. ; )<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if someone could point me to any resources about putting together an end-of-year portfolio kind of thing for an unschooling family.  I&#39;m now embracing that unschooling is the right way to go for us, especially given the debacle of cramming idiotic work product activities in at the end of last year so we&#39;d have something to show the person doing our evaluation.  (I&#39;m not sure there has ever been a more pointless endeavor in the history of the world than making George and Theo put together a &quot;lapbook&quot; of colonial life.  I cringe thinking about it.)<br/>
<br/>
The woman we did this with last year is pretty laid back, but it&#39;s still at the back of my mind as we live day-to-day: &quot;What am I going to show her to show progress commensurate with age and ability in the six categories?&quot;  Oy.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d love to see or hear about examples of what folks do at the end of the year, or how to fit regular life into these categories (health, phys ed, math, literature, natural sciences, fine arts), maybe in ways that aren&#39;t so straightforward. (I&#39;m sure there are those of you who don&#39;t even deal with it, but we did choose to register).  <br/>
<br/>
All I know is that this is my responsibility to pull something together, and I want to keep the pressure off the boys to produce things just to show.  <br/>

If my life wasn&#39;t funny, it would just be true, and that&#39;s unacceptable.<br/>

regulations. My state, for instance, doesn&#39;t require a portfolio.<br/>

People sent those specifically for the purpose of letting other families mine them for the good parts.<br/>

Also, Shannon Burton has been putting things on her blog as she documents things for the state of New York:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325010556">Look up unschoolers in your own state (if you&#39;re in the U.S.):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a><br/>
Plug in your own state plus the word &quot;unschool&quot; and browse through the<br/>
results some of which go by county, some by city, and others by an acronym<br/>
or other moniker.<br/>
<br/>
When I looked up unschoolers out of curiosity for my sister in law who<br/>
expressed an interest in unschooling, she learned of additional options<br/>
available to her which freed her up from doing portfolios. It turns out that<br/>
portfolios are not a requirement of the state at all. For her, this also<br/>
means less cost to go with the umbrella group in her area (run by an<br/>
unschooler) because testing is not required by the state either but if you<br/>
DO test there&#39;s a fee for each child.<br/>
<br/>
That might be the case in lots of states. Umbrella organizations make<br/>
various requirements of their own.<br/>
<br/>
Look up unschoolers nearest to you.<br/>
