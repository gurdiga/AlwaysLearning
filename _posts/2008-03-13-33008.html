<div id="ygrps-yiv-338449433">1. How do I help ds11 earn money from outside our family?  He is the <br/>
type of person who never wants to get rid of anything.  We have <br/>
several boxes in the attic of toys/books/games he has outgrown but <br/>
that he insist we keep.  I told him selling the things he no longer <br/>
used would not only give him money to purchase something that he can <br/>
use, but would likely benefit the buyer as well.  But my son really <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to let anything go.  He has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome and has <br/>
a different way of looking at things than I or my husband do, which <br/>
makes communication challenging sometimes.  I really can&#39;t find my <br/>
way out of the box on this one other than to get a part-time job in <br/>
the evening myself so that I can earn money for him to use that <br/>
isn&#39;t currently in our means of living.  I just feel that would <br/>
disrupt our family flow and I&#39;m not sure how to look at it.<br/>
<br/>
2. A recurring discussion between me and DH is the matter of a high <br/>
school diploma.  My dh really doesn&#39;t want our children getting a <br/>
GED because of the poor reputation it has, kids who have dropped out <br/>
of school or been forced out of the school system.  This locks us <br/>
into a traditional educational way of thinking because in order to <br/>
earn a high school diploma in the state of Georgia, the student must <br/>
complete an accredited program.  That means 4 years of high school.  <br/>
That means my ds11 should be working on some academics, specifically <br/>
math and language arts, in order to be prepared for high school.  I <br/>
am positive there is another way to look at this but haven&#39;t yet <br/>
found a good way to help me explain this to my DH.  I hear about <br/>
unschooled teens having jobs and careers, but my DH says that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know of anyone who can be hired beyond the age of 18 without <br/>
a high school diploma.  Thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ll probably  make more money saving them and selling them later,  <br/>
and it&#39;s not worth the sorrow of letting things go.  So say I, Sandra  <br/>
a life-long packrat with some COOL stuff (and who has sold some cool  <br/>
stuff for seriously more than I paid).<br/>

been forced out of the school system.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Or, nowadays, kids who opted not to even go in at all.  The  <br/>
reputation isn&#39;t what it used to be.  Neither is the &quot;value&quot; of a  <br/>
high school diploma!<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have GEDs.  They just go to jobs and say &quot;I was  <br/>
homeschooled.&quot;  That&#39;s that.<br/>

<br/>
It does NOT &quot;lock you&quot; into anything.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband needs to do more learning of his own.  Every unschooled  <br/>
kid I know who&#39;s over the age of 18 has been working since BEFORE the  <br/>
age of 18.  Without a diploma, without a GED.<br/>
<br/>
It would be MUCH easier for your husband to learn more than for you  <br/>
to hinder and hamper your unschooling and your own family&#39;s peace and  <br/>
uniqueness by trying to follow a curriculum to get a high school  <br/>
diploma.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444407646"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; He is the type of person who never wants to get rid of anything. ... He<br/>
 </span></blockquote>has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome and has<br/>
a different way of looking at things than I or my husband do&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
My son is like this, and really, unschooling and having an accepting,<br/>
respectful, appreciative family, has saved his life. He has a completely<br/>
different outlook on the world than I do, thank bejesus. Boy would it be a<br/>
small world if it just worked the way I saw it (which I thought was the best<br/>
way until having kids, and he expanded that vision fifteen-fold).<br/>
<br/>
Anyray.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 19 now. After many years of collecting with great emotional attachment<br/>
(not that he ever looked at any of the stuff for all the years...he just<br/>
didn&#39;t want to separate from it and have that loss), he began to want a<br/>
cleaner and clearer space in his room. And he began throwing things out and<br/>
giving things to other people. And he was able to give really cool gifts to<br/>
people! An old comic book here, an action figure there...mostly to younger<br/>
people who really dug them and were very excited!<br/>
And that was a great thing for Andrew to experience...giving meaningful<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
The 6 years-worth of Halloween candy, each year still in its own bag or<br/>
pillow case, was tossed, none eaten. I didn&#39;t think that was ever going to<br/>
happen.<br/>
<br/>
Now he still has a lot of stuff, though it appears to have more use and<br/>
meaning to him. He still keeps stuff too (movie tickets, concert tickets,<br/>
cards...he used to collect business cards and advertising cards everywhere<br/>
he went...he would get SO excited at seeing people&#39;s cards). He loves Reeds<br/>
Ginger Ale and his entire room is lined with rows of these green bottles. It<br/>
is really cool-looking! His &quot;wants&quot; seem more specific, and he finds a place<br/>
for what he wants in his room. It&#39;s a subtle difference, but there is more<br/>
maturity and discernment involved. It happened at his pace.<br/>
<br/>
Respecting all your son&#39;s parts, even the parts that don&#39;t correlate with<br/>
your life vision, is important.<br/>
<br/>
Try seeing his &quot;oddities&quot; as neat things that you never got to have as part<br/>
of your make-up. If its not hurting anyone or anything, then maybe it is a<br/>
gift! You never know where any part of your son&#39;s personality will lead. My<br/>
guy does incredibly cool performance art with instruments, poetry, comedy,<br/>
choreographed weirdness...he didn&#39;t give eye contact to most people for<br/>
YEARS, but he can humbly lead a whole audience through another dimension.<br/>
<br/>
As far as making money is concerned...it really isn&#39;t different for your guy<br/>
than any other child...let him follow his passions and interests and see<br/>
where it leads. There will be opportunities.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My DH&#39;s concern is about the quality of jobs for a person without a <br/>
diploma.  We know kids can get jobs at a grocery store, movie <br/>
theater, mall, etc.  We&#39;re so used to thinking that when those kids <br/>
graduate and grow up, they generally move on to something else more <br/>
substantial.  My DH thinks of a diploma as a key to open more <br/>
opportunities.  A person with a diploma can still choose to work in <br/>
jobs that don&#39;t require a diploma, but a person without a diploma is <br/>
limited to just that one set of jobs.  When we talk about this, we <br/>
can&#39;t find a way to think beyond it.  We keep getting stuck at the <br/>
thought of the kids turning 30 years old with the same job prospects <br/>
as when they were 15 years old.  Our personal experience with living <br/>
expenses just makes us cringe at the idea that our children will one <br/>
day be trying to pay for a car, house, family, etc. on a salary <br/>
meant for a teenager still in school.<br/>
<br/>
My DH is open to new ideas.  We discuss these things trying to work <br/>
through them.  We&#39;ll look at the links you provided to see if that <br/>
helps us move forward with unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Jacki, your post was very helpful.  I suppose we&#39;re just at <br/>
the transition from little kid to teenager and he&#39;s got a foot in <br/>
both worlds.  This past weekend, we reorganized his room into more <br/>
of a teen pad, as he called it.  I asked him what 3 things he did <br/>
most in his room and he said computer, video games, and hot wheels <br/>
cars.  He has a huge collection of Lego bricks and creations and <br/>
that didn&#39;t even make his top 3, though it&#39;s always been the top of <br/>
his list since he was 2.  We worked together to get the room the way <br/>
he wanted it and that involved moving some stuff out and into the <br/>
attic.  We live in a small house with no extra rooms and his bedroom <br/>
is really small.  His solution to his space problem is for us to <br/>
move and that isn&#39;t an option.  At the same time, even though he has <br/>
so much stuff, he spends alot of time on the computer researching <br/>
things he wants.  For example, he really wants a Playstation 3 and I <br/>
just cannot afford one right now.  He prints out lists and pictures <br/>
and shows them to us repeatedly throughout the day.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how to handle it.  I feel guilty that I can&#39;t run out and buy him <br/>
the things he feels he needs.  If I try to discuss the matter with <br/>
him, he ends up extremely angry so I try not to get into discussions <br/>
about those things.  <br/>

<br/>
Holly keeps movie tickets.  I came across one of my Star Wars tickets  <br/>
from years ago.  $3.50 to get in, I think it was.   I have some of my  <br/>
concert tickets, and of course wish I had them all, because (it being  <br/>
60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s) I don&#39;t even remember who all I saw now.  (eeep!  <br/>
that drives Holly crazy!)<br/>
<br/>
When I find my Donovan tickets, I&#39;m definitely adding them to a  <br/>
Donovan page I&#39;ve started working on (because of Holly&#39;s interest).   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/donovan">http://sandradodd.com/donovan</a><br/>
<br/>
I collect business cards.  Not formally, I just have a stash of  <br/>
them.  I have a collection of post cards, too, but post cards I got  <br/>
from people I know are usually filed with other things from them.  So  <br/>
if I die, tell my kids not to shovel the house out without mining it  <br/>
for post cards and concert tickets!<br/>
<br/>
-=-He loves Reeds Ginger Ale and his entire room is lined with rows  <br/>

<br/>
Oh my gosh this ties in with my house this week!<br/>
<br/>
Holly let me crush-to-recycle the Red Bull cans she was saving. She  <br/>
has done a fair amount of Red Bull art (people make things from the  <br/>
cans, and some of the best stuff is on webpages), but I needed to  <br/>
take her window out to trim vines away from it (it&#39;s upstairs).     <br/>
And half an hour ago I was working in the yard, and filling up a  <br/>
green plastic watering can from a hose in the sunlight, and thinking  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen few things as beautiful in my life as the way water looks,  <br/>
moving and reflecting through green plastic.  I was thinking of the  <br/>
green corrugated fiberglass roof stuff so common when I was little,  <br/>
and I thought people hundreds of years ago could never have seen  <br/>
that.  Maybe they saw rain running on the windows through green  <br/>
stained glass, or through bottles, but not in the sunlight.  They had  <br/>
green glass bottles, though...<br/>
<br/>
And now I came in here and read about a green glass collection!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We didn&#39;t know Kirby would have a video game company job when he was  <br/>
grown.  He&#39;s been playing all kinds of games since he was little,  <br/>
though.  Nintendo since he was five.  Board games and card games  <br/>
longer.  We didn&#39;t stop him, and that&#39;s where he went, and where he  <br/>
is at the moment.  Keith is doing his taxes for him.  Keith is  <br/>
impressed.   Lots of overtime, the moving stipend, a raise...<br/>
<br/>
Kirby makes way more money than I did the first year I was teaching,  <br/>
even if my annual pay were to be adjusted for inflation.  I had a  <br/>
college degree and loans to repay.    I think Kirby&#39;s making close to  <br/>
what Keith started with when he first worked as an engineer when I  <br/>
was pregnant with Kirby.  Keith was 29 and had a BS degree.<br/>

Schuyler, did you get the GED to apply to Minnesota State, or what?   <br/>
The thing kids are doing here is going to the community college  <br/>
(formerly TVI, now Central New Mexico Community College (yeah, way  <br/>
too long) and then transferring to universities with their scores  <br/>
from there.<br/>
<br/>
Turning eighteen is WAY more useful than a GED or a high school  <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re used to thinking about schoolkids.<br/>
<br/>
One of the wealthiest unschooling families I know (at least the  <br/>
family with the best house &lt;g&gt;), the dad was a regional manager for a  <br/>
grocery store chain.  He started working there as a teen and kept  <br/>
getting promoted.<br/>

<br/>
As an aid to your thinking, since you&#39;ve asked for assistance,  <br/>
anytime you use the word &quot;just,&quot; stop and think very carefully.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a door-slamming word.  It&#39;s a word that limits thought, and people  <br/>
don&#39;t even know they&#39;re doing it to themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to name that &quot;one set of jobs&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
There are people with diplomas who don&#39;t want to work in the field  <br/>
they studied, or the degree they got isn&#39;t useful all by itself,  <br/>
except in cases where any old degree is fine.  There are jobs working  <br/>
for the state of New Mexico, for example, for which a person has to  <br/>
have a college diploma.  They don&#39;t care WHAT the degree is.  It  <br/>
could be pottery or psychology or math, what the job is is working in  <br/>
an administrative position.<br/>
<br/>
Some college degrees are known in advance to be worthless in the  <br/>
field unless the person goes on to get a master&#39;s or PhD.   <br/>
Psychology.  A BA in psychology is good only for getting into a  <br/>
master&#39;s program BUT you can get into the master&#39;s program with a  <br/>
degree in pottery or math or English.   You can probably think of  <br/>
other examples.<br/>
<br/>
PhDs---some are only good for teaching at a university.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My DH is open to new ideas. We discuss these things trying to  <br/>

<br/>
Stop discussing them.  You&#39;re both working with so limited a set of  <br/>
information that you&#39;re wasting time and energy you could be spending  <br/>
with your family.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Just.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First of all, the idea of such transitions is counterproductive to  <br/>
seeing him as a whole, full person.  Second, they&#39;re not two worlds.   <br/>
We&#39;re all in the same world, in unschooling.  Your thinking involves  <br/>
false worlds and divisions and transitions and teenage incomes and  <br/>
adult incomes for high school graduates as a separate category  <br/>
entirely from incomes for homeschoolers and dropouts (which you&#39;ve  <br/>
put into the same category).<br/>
<br/>
-=-His solution to his space problem is for us to move and that isn&#39;t  <br/>
an option.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I realize that it might not be an option, but I would like to suggest  <br/>
that the odds are that it is an option.<br/>
<br/>
If you have more children would you move?  If that house were flooded  <br/>
or caught fire would you move?  If the non-option has to do with  <br/>
inherited family home, what about adding on?  If your child were  <br/>
handicapped and you needed to change the house to get equipment in  <br/>
and out, would you?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to say no.  It&#39;s easy to say &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-he really wants a Playstation 3 and I just cannot afford one right  <br/>
now.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What expenses would he have if he were in school that he doesn&#39;t have  <br/>
because he&#39;s at home?  Those expenses should go back into his  <br/>
educational concerns.  Unschooling should NOT be less expensive than  <br/>
government schooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel guilty that I can&#39;t run out and buy him the things he feels  <br/>
he needs. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Try to take this well.  You did ask us for help.  I&#39;m going to  <br/>
comment after I quote the line you wrote after it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I try to discuss the matter with him, he ends up extremely  <br/>
angry -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to suggest something that might be making him angry.  The  <br/>
way you chose to phrase what you told us (strangers, but strangers  <br/>
who are willing to try to help you for free, so don&#39;t get cranky at  <br/>
me here) is revealing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what you have inadvertently revealed:  You don&#39;t think he  <br/>
needs those things.  You think people who do buy things for their  <br/>
children &quot;just run out and buy them.&quot;   You&#39;re feeling virtuous (or  <br/>
justified, or defensive; not sure) about not running out and buying  <br/>
him things he doesn&#39;t need anyway.<br/>
<br/>
You want us to help you feel you&#39;re doing the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible you could change the way you see his requests.<br/>

<h4>emvalschool</h4>
<time>13 Mar 2008, at 12:48pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138516873">One of my sons started working at a sandwich shop when he was 14. He saved a few<br/>
thousand dollars and when he was 23 opened a small but very unusual bike shop (he&#39;s<br/>
been passionate about bikes since he was 5 and always entrepreneurial). Now, 10 years<br/>
later, his shop takes up much of the block it&#39;s on and last year grossed 2.5 million dollars.<br/>
He supports his family very well. It is not true that one needs to have a GED or a college<br/>
degree to make money. Another son of mine does not have a high school diploma but<br/>
decided to go to university because what he wants to do requires a degree. He didn&#39;t start<br/>
college until he was 23 because until then he had no real reason to. It seems to me that<br/>
people who are deeply connected to themselves and know what they need will at the right<br/>
time do what they have to do and get what they need to get in order to create the life of<br/>

base and work ethic.  Anyone with a high school diploma may have a <br/>
piece of paper, but that doesn&#39;t gaurantee a good knowledge base or a <br/>
good work ethic.  A kid that is homeschooled can work at a place of <br/>
interest and acquire knowledge and be a good worker.  Good workers <br/>
don&#39;t stay in low positions, they move up.<br/>
<br/>
Kids that unschool, do what they need to do to get what they want.  <br/>
That is how it works.  Working in a low paying job may not be a bad <br/>
thing either.  I&#39;ve known people that take on those kind of jobs, <br/>
simply because they don&#39;t have to invest their all in it, they can do <br/>
their job with little drain on them, then do the other things they <br/>
love to do.  A job can be just a source of income and as long as it <br/>
provides what a person needs there is nothing wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
Once a job doesn&#39;t provide what a person needs, get a different <br/>
better one.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter is about to turn 14, the legal age that she can <br/>
work where we live.  She is extremely excited about that.  I have no <br/>
doubt in my mind that she will be a good employee and be fully <br/>
competent in whatever job she does.  We&#39;ve been talking about this <br/>
same stuff lately.  She has never been to school, nor does she plan <br/>
on it.  She&#39;s considered taking a college course or 2.  Once she <br/>
takes a college course, that trumps high school diploma.<br/>
<br/>
High school dimplomas don&#39;t mean a whole lot anymore with more and <br/>
more people going to college.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Why isn&#39;t it an option to move?  Don&#39;t answer that question on list <br/>
if you don&#39;t want to.  Sometimes there are legitimate reasons to not <br/>
be able to move, like leases and such.  My experience says that if <br/>
there is a will there is a way.  The world is FULL of options, <br/>
unlimited.<br/>
<br/>
As to the playstation 3 issue... Why not save money for it.  Put one <br/>
of his pictures on a jar and start putting money in it.  One quart <br/>
sized mason jar full of pennies is about $10.  Add nickels, dimes, <br/>
quarters, dollar bills, maybe even a fiver here and there.  Make <br/>
different choices at the grocery store.  Buy the generic and put the <br/>
difference in his jar.  Give an option of buying one or two boxes of <br/>
cookies and put the difference in the jar.  The world is made up of <br/>
little choices that you can act on to positively effect his world.<br/>
<br/>
Once it is full, cash it in and put the larger bill in it and start <br/>
adding more.  It could take months for it to grow and he may outgrow <br/>
is desire for the ps3, but it&#39;s more about the thought and the <br/>
willingness to honor his needs and his wishes.  If he wants to use <br/>
the cash for something else sooner, let him.<br/>
<br/>
All discussions about the ps3 can be positive and cool and you guys <br/>
can count the money often and think about it and wonder how long it <br/>
will take.  Be excited about it.  Be proactive about his desires.  It <br/>
really is a key element in unschooling.  Finding positive ways to <br/>
honor your child&#39;s desires not only creates a positive relationship, <br/>
it shows him how to find creative ways to problem solve.</div>

 </span></blockquote>  Im ehm over 30 . I went to nursing school about 15 years ago but its been years since Ive worked at any paying job. Since I havent been licensed in years here in tx id pretty much have to go do a lot of coursework over again if I wanted to become a nurse. In some ways through age which implies maturity most of the time in society and experience through volunteer work and such my chances are slightly better . In other ways because of age and have not had a paying job in years my chances are worse than a 15 yr old. <br/>
   <br/>
  I throughly enjoy my non paying job :) and dont plan on leaving anytime soon . <br/>
   <br/>
  IF I HAD to though the college doors are open .....if i were to go get a 4 year degree it would likely be forst 2 years at a jr college but most ppl pay attention to where you graduated from a lot more than where you went your first year. <br/>
   <br/>
  One of my children has a lot of medical expenses . We recently started making $160 a month to much to qualify for medicaid . Suddenly we have aprox $2000 a month in expenses we have to come up with because he is making $160 a month more ..........so more money dosent always benefit you :) <br/>

&gt; to seeing him as a whole, full person.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I do see that I&#39;m lumping alot of things together that I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be putting together.  The reason I&#39;m calling his growing a <br/>
transition is because I see and hear the changes in him that make <br/>
him seem more grown up.  I know he&#39;s a whole person, always has been <br/>
and always will be.  I also know that he&#39;s been growing since <br/>
conception.  I used to look at him and see a little boy.  Lately, <br/>
I&#39;m seeing more of a young man.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I realize that it might not be an option, but I would like to<br/>
&gt; suggest that the odds are that it is an option.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I used a poor choice of words.  Of course moving is an option <br/>
but my DH and I are not prepared for all that comes with selling and <br/>
buying houses.  We have the other children to consider, one of which <br/>
wants to stay in this house until she graduates.  Then there are all <br/>
the other excuses such as updating the house, trying to sell at a <br/>
bad time and probably not having any money left over from the <br/>
purchase to use as a down payment on the next one.  We have talked <br/>
about moving in the summer of 2010 when dd15 graduates high school.  <br/>
This doesn&#39;t help the immediate situation though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have more children would you move?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not until the child needed the space.  I&#39;d have the baby in with me <br/>
IF that were even an option.  DH had a vasectomy 10 years ago and I <br/>
haven&#39;t yet been lucky enough for it to fail.  :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If that house were flooded or caught fire would you move?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes because the insurance would cover it which isn&#39;t an option in <br/>
the current situation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If the non-option has to do with inherited family home, what about<br/>
&gt; adding on?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now this we have seriously considered.  We have a very large garage <br/>
that we thought about converting into livable space.  Jeffrey, our <br/>
ds11, said he would only use it if it was professionally finished <br/>
with real walls, carpet and a ceiling.  It would require taking out <br/>
a second mortgage.  We don&#39;t feel that is a sound financial decision <br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If your child were handicapped and you needed to change the house<br/>
&gt; to get equipment in and out, would you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, insurance would cover that.  And if it didn&#39;t, we&#39;d surely <br/>
take out a 2nd mortgage because the changes would mean something to <br/>
the quality of life for the disabled person.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s easy to say no.  It&#39;s easy to say &quot;can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it is, and I know that all my reasons above for not being able <br/>
to do this or that seem like easy excuses.  We don&#39;t see them as <br/>
easy though.  Would unschooling, non-coercive parents truly make <br/>
decisions that put the family into major debt to give a child <br/>
everything he desires?  Taking a 2nd mortgage to finish that garage <br/>
would be a major debt.  Also, are we wrong in thinking that another <br/>
game system is not the best use of the family money when we have <br/>
other expenses to pay?  I&#39;d be happy to forego a family vacation <br/>
this year in lieu of buying a new game system but the kids would <br/>
likely be upset as they enjoy family vacations.  Which, btw, we are <br/>
still paying off our last vacation to visit the inlaws in Wisconsin <br/>
last December.    <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What expenses would he have if he were in school that he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have because he&#39;s at home?  Those expenses should go back into<br/>
&gt; his educational concerns.  Unschooling should NOT be less<br/>
&gt; expensive than government schooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But we can only spend money once.  We&#39;ve already paid more than <br/>
normal expenses incurred with being in school.  When I do have extra <br/>
money, I am glad to take him to Gamestop, his favorite store, to buy <br/>
a new video game.  He does not like to save money.  He gets easily <br/>
frustrated and will spend anything he&#39;s saved just to have something <br/>
new.  I did ask him about starting a saving jar for the Playstation <br/>
3.  When we have extra money, it can go into the jar and when we <br/>
save enough, we can buy the system.  He doesn&#39;t want to do that <br/>
because it will take too long to save.  Isn&#39;t this a maturity issue?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Try to take this well.  You did ask us for help.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and I am truly listening to what you are saying.  I do want <br/>
help in looking at these issues from a different standpoint.  I&#39;m <br/>
not crying or upset.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here&#39;s what you have inadvertently revealed:  You don&#39;t think he  <br/>
&gt; needs those things.  You think people who do buy things for their  <br/>
&gt; children &quot;just run out and buy them.&quot;   You&#39;re feeling virtuous<br/>
&gt; (or justified, or defensive; not sure) about not running out and<br/>
&gt; buying him things he doesn&#39;t need anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I completely agree I don&#39;t feel he needs those things.  There <br/>
is a big difference between needs and wants.  Every one of us in <br/>
this family has a list of things we want.  How do we determine who&#39;s <br/>
wants are more important?  If I were to provide everything they <br/>
wanted, I&#39;d run our Visa up several thousand dollars in one day <br/>
easily.  If I add the things I want and my DH want, we&#39;d likely go <br/>
up another couple of thousand dollars.  Am I wrong in thinking that <br/>
the children need to understand that we simply cannot have whatever <br/>
we want whenever we want it?  If that is the real world, them I&#39;m in <br/>
the wrong place!  *laugh*  <br/>
<br/>
I do not think people just run out and buy things that I can&#39;t do.  <br/>
I am saying that my son wants what he wants when he wants it and <br/>
anything less than immediate gratification will not satisfy him.  <br/>
This is the child who asked for a Playstation 2 for months and when <br/>
we finally got one, he was asking for a Playstation 3 the very next <br/>
day.  And remember, he doesn&#39;t like letting things go.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand why he can&#39;t have both systems right now.  In other <br/>
words, he obsesses about something until he gets it and then he <br/>
moves his obsession onto something else.  He does act happy that he <br/>
has the new thing but he doesn&#39;t feel satisfied and content because <br/>
there are so many more things he wants.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You want us to help you feel you&#39;re doing the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  I want y&#39;all to help me look at these things the way y&#39;all do.  <br/>
It&#39;s almost like I&#39;m looking through hazy glass.  I can sort of make <br/>
out what is there, but it&#39;s not crystal clear.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s possible you could change the way you see his requests.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see his requests as being perfectly reasonable, honestly.  But how <br/>
do I truly give him what he wants when I absolutely do not have the <br/>
money?  Or what if I did have some money?  What if I had $500 right <br/>
now today.  Why is his want of a Playstation 3 greater than than the <br/>
clothes my dd15 needs for her spring break trip with her best <br/>
friend?  <br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;m speaking clearly.  I swear I do not intend any of this <br/>
with a whiny tone.  Maybe I&#39;ll print this out and take it with me to <br/>
Wendy&#39;s house tomorrow (unschooling family) and maybe she can help <br/>
me see things from a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I did talk with the kids earlier today about the possibility <br/>
of my getting a part-time job to help earn spending money.  Jeffrey <br/>
absolutely hated the idea.  He doesn&#39;t want me working outside the <br/>
home.  The girls didn&#39;t care one way or the other.  <br/>

Very often questions asked on this list are hypothetical--more for  <br/>

<br/>
As you chose to answer, though, I get to point at it.  &quot;because the  <br/>
changes would mean something to the quality of life for the disabled  <br/>
person.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe quality of life is just as important to other kids too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He doesn&#39;t want to do that because it will take too long to save.  <br/>
Isn&#39;t this a maturity issue?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Could be a personality issue.  But what if it&#39;s a maturity issue?<br/>
<br/>
-=-There is a big difference between needs and wants.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not with babies there isn&#39;t.  When do you think it changes?<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants something the parents deem him not to need, it seems  <br/>
the need is real.  Unmet needs make people want things.  I&#39;m  <br/>
surprised at the things my kids don&#39;t want.  I offered to buy Holly a  <br/>
new pair of Vans last week and she said no, it was fine.  And it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t any surly-girl hateful &quot;No, it&#39;s fine.&quot;  It was cheerful.  Her  <br/>
old Vans are wearing out.  She said if they went, though, she&#39;d just  <br/>
go to PayLess.  Would kids of needy children even believe such a  <br/>
think could be possible?  Does she &quot;need&quot; Vans?  Did she ever?  I got  <br/>
her some last year and she&#39;s worn them just about every day.  She  <br/>
didn&#39;t need them then and she doesn&#39;t need replacements.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Every one of us in this family has a list of things we want. How  <br/>
do we determine who&#39;s wants are more important?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What I want is to be a really good parents.  There are no overs.  One  <br/>
shot with each kid.  He&#39;ll never be the age he is again.  What you do  <br/>
now is what you do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would unschooling, non-coercive parents truly make decisions that  <br/>
put the family into major debt to give a child everything he desires?  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is not a &quot;non coercive parenting list.&quot;  Don&#39;t muddy the waters,  <br/>
please.  That&#39;s a specific organization and they don&#39;t discuss their  <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re doing that emotional revelation thing again.  &quot;Everything he  <br/>
desires&quot; is a loaded phrase.   I think any compassionate parent with  <br/>
a frustrated child should consider going a little into debt to give  <br/>
him some of the things he desires.<br/>
<br/>
The less you give him, the needier he will be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Am I wrong in thinking that the children need to understand that  <br/>
we simply cannot have whatever  we want whenever we want it? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No one made that recommendation. Please try not to ask your questions  <br/>
in such ways that you insult those who are trying to help.  And it  <br/>
might help more for you to go back through and read again, and read  <br/>
all the links people brought (or maybe I&#39;m the only one who brought  <br/>
links, but they&#39;re to many people&#39;s writings).   Maybe let some of  <br/>
this soak in and then see what questions you still have.<br/>

I was thinking if your son likes to collect things maybe a creative way<br/>
to display his collections might be fun for him??<br/>
<br/>
This post reminded me that I&#39;ve saved a bunch of bottles and want to put<br/>
a bottle tree in the front yard (I hear they&#39;re popular in the south),<br/>
but dh doesn&#39;t really like the idea.  I think he thinks the neighbors<br/>
will think we drink too much!!lol  We have an old pine that&#39;s really<br/>
getting overgrown and I&#39;d love to trim it down to the trunk!  I love<br/>
blue bottles!!  Maybe he&#39;d go for doing it in the backyard? hmmm<br/>

My hubby also has all his old albums from high school and I think it<br/>

&gt; has done a fair amount of Red Bull art (people make things from the<br/>
&gt; cans, and some of the best stuff is on webpages), but I needed to<br/>
&gt; take her window out to trim vines away from it (it&#39;s upstairs).<br/>
&gt; And half an hour ago I was working in the yard, and filling up a<br/>

I was thinking of the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kirby makes way more money than I did the first year I was teaching,<br/>
&gt; even if my annual pay were to be adjusted for inflation.  I had a<br/>

You son is eleven years old, right?<br/>
<br/>
You could put him in school, free.  (Almost free; they&#39;ll want money  <br/>
for uniforms and supplies and field trips and deposits all the time,  <br/>
and you&#39;ll have to buy the supplies they ask for.)   If you put him  <br/>
in school, he&#39;ll end up with a diploma.<br/>
<br/>
If the diploma is so important to you and your husband, put  him in  <br/>
school!<br/>

If you&#39;re not going to put him in school, would you *please* (please)  <br/>
read all the links I&#39;ve sent about teens who have had jobs?<br/>

it&#39;s this or this or this or this...<br/>

Family vacations don&#39;t have to be big and expensive and they don&#39;t <br/>

something else that another child wants and go on a small vacation.<br/>

It&#39;s not about when you have extra money to put into it.  Put <br/>
something in it everyday, even if its a dime.<br/>
<br/>
The garage doesn&#39;t have to be completely remodeled to make a cool and <br/>

anyone has to sleep in, it could be a space to hang out in.  It could <br/>

Martha Stewart, a few years ago, did big (poster sized) framed artwork where <br/>
she had small ephemera like tickets enlarged hugely and arranged on a mat. <br/>
There would be three or four items in each frame and then she lined up the <br/>
frames.<br/>
<br/>
Or use frames for the album covers and decoupage the tickets on to the <br/>
frames.<br/>
<br/>
Other people have used paper items in journal quilts doing things like <br/>
making gauze pockets or sewing through the paper. This would be wall hanging <br/>
type quilts.<br/>
<br/>
Make them into double sided book marks by laminating some together.<br/>
