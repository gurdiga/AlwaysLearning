<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know Broc and Gail, Broc has three kids who live  <br/>
in Texas.  They&#39;re late teens/young adults.  Gail has two kids (Brenna  <br/>
and Logan) who are mid and late teens.  They&#39;re all wonderful, and all  <br/>
in New Mexico this week because Broc&#39;s parents had their 50th  <br/>
anniversary.  They both have other relatives in the state, too.<br/>
<br/>
The first couple on this page is Broc and Gail:<br/>

Gail&#39;s blog is<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/">http://gail-hummingbirdhaven.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
and there are photos of all the kids there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lee Stranahan, who&#39;s making these videos for a DVD on unschooling,  <br/>
taped Broc yesterday and Brenna.<br/>
<br/>
He has quite a bit more of me (more than he&#39;s put on youtube, which I  <br/>
have here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/video">http://sandradodd.com/video</a> ) which won&#39;t be online, but will be on  <br/>
the final DVD and the advance copies.<br/>
<br/>
Financial supporters of the project can get an advance DVD or a  <br/>
special version of the final.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What Broc says about schools training people to do the steps from 1-60<br/>
to get to 60, is so true!  Unschooled kids will look at that process and<br/>
decide wether or not they really need to do steps 2-59 to get to 60,<br/>
while kids who have been schooled won&#39;t necessarily question that. <br/>
Schools tend to belabor processes that could be so much simpler and take<br/>
so much less time.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who question things and don&#39;t like jumping through hoops, the ones<br/>
who often get in trouble in school, are really the smart ones!  They<br/>
know inside themselves that what is being said to them isn&#39;t truth and<br/>
they can&#39;t do much much about it.  So they either sacrifice themselves<br/>
to get along in that system, or they don&#39;t and the system fails them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about other people, but I was one of the ones that<br/>
sacrificed myself to get along.  I&#39;m soooooo eternally grateful that I<br/>
can give my own kids a better life!  I love that they are able to find<br/>
their own ways to do things.  That process is so overlooked by schools,<br/>
yet, in my thinking it is one of the most important things in life for<br/>
kids (well anybody really) to be able to do.</div>

<br/>
But to keep this from being just a &quot;me too&quot; post, I think it is really <br/>
important to recognize that those of us who looked like school success <br/>
stories might, in fact, have been significantly harmed by school. It <br/>
took me many years to get over<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really admire the kids who don&#39;t just take it, the ones who know there<br/>
is something wrong.  It&#39;s a hard road to go though, to constantly feel<br/>
like you aren&#39;t wrong but to be told so repeatedly that you are simply<br/>
because you aren&#39;t fitting into that mold of school.<br/>
<br/>
I was a school success story, but I myself, am not really successful. <br/>
I&#39;m a good mom, and my kids are already way more whole and intact than I<br/>
was by the time I reached adulthood.  The things that I love to do, I<br/>
really wanted to do when I was a teen and couldn&#39;t because of how<br/>
enormously time consuming school was.  I don&#39;t think I ever got over<br/>
that.  By the time I was out of school, I had a baby and that was time<br/>
consuming too, a good time consuming, unlike school.<br/>
<br/>
I really love that I can undo that damage by not doing it to my kids!  I<br/>
love that my kids have the freedom to do nothing if they so choose, even<br/>
though that never happens.  The amount of hands on activities that<br/>
Chamille does is huge and wonderful and exciting and Margaux has learned<br/>
how to read full sentences.  She read her first book from front to back<br/>
last night.  It was a Curious George lift the flap book.  Their<br/>
curiousity and love of life and learning hasn&#39;t diminished with the<br/>
tedium of school.</div>

OH!  I want to have that flash-red-lights and hand-cranked-siren thing  <br/>
they have at ice cream parlors or kids&#39; pizza places sometimes, to  <br/>
show that something BIG is happening!!<br/>

<br/>
The only way a child can choose to do something is if she had the  <br/>
option to do nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Put that piece in the big puzzle we&#39;ve all been working on for a dozen  <br/>
years or more, please.   Thank you, Jenny!<br/>
<br/>
(I guess I&#39;d also like the big fire-extinguisher-looking whipped-cream  <br/>
dispenser to go with all this.)<br/>
