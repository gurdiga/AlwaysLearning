<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259601296">Last week I just found out that my son has leukemia.  He&#39;s six.  I was<br/>
wondering if someone might be able to put me in connection with another<br/>
family who has gone through a similar situation as unschoolers.  I&#39;m sure I<br/>
will have some unique needs and questions in the upcoming months and it<br/>
would be nice to have a friend on common ground.  Thank you.<br/>
