&gt; my kids were smaller to place things in the house so they were easier <br/>
&gt; for them to reach -- like cups, bowls, cereal, snack etc., put a few <br/>
&gt; of them in a lower cupboard so they don&#39;t have a hard time reaching <br/>
&gt; them themselves. I found this a relief for me and empowering for them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a teensy kitchen and no room for dishes at all in there --- they are <br/>
in a china cabinet in the so-called dining room (really just an area of the <br/>
one big room that serves as living room/family room, walkway, dining room &lt;G&gt;<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
I had one drawer in the kitchen with dishes for the kids - when they were too <br/>
little to easily get into the china cabinet. A couple of weeks ago I realized <br/>
that everybody&#39;s forgotten those dishes are even THERE -- its been so long <br/>
since they&#39;ve been that little!!!!  So I, sadly and ceremoniously, moved <br/>
those little dishes out of that drawer.<br/>
