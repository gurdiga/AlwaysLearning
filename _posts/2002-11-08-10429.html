<div id="ygrps-yiv-627545984">I went to Disneyland the first time when I was 10.  I loved it.  I wanted to live there!!  But I hated the rides.  The very first rollercoster in my whole life and it was Space Mountain.  My dad had to hold onto me to keep me from jumping off.   <br/>
<br/>
Went again when I was twelve with my cousins youth group.  I was a little older and it was even better.  Got over my fear of the roller coasters.  :)  Didn&#39;t have much money but had a swell time.  After that I decided I was going to go back on my honeymoon someday.  And believe it or not I did.  Nothing else I planned for my wedding happened right but that did.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Shawn and I got married in December and went on our Disney Honeymoon in Feb.  For Valentines day.  And again, even as an adult I was mesmerized.  But I LOVE flashy lights and crowds.  I realize not everyone does.  I just love adventure really and anything different than my regular life.  I used to joke that when I was young that I would find the fun in a public execution.  I would go to teen dances and spend the whole time crying only to come home and write about how amazing it was in my journal!  LOL   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re planning to go again with the kids someday when money will allow.  I haven&#39;t been as a parent yet so that might be a whole different feeling.  Going in Feb. was something I would definitely do again.  It was rainy but the lines were short sna d it wasn&#39;t so HOT.  The downside was that several of the rides were closed for maintenance which they do in the off season.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

I think there are at least two rides closed at any one time no matter what <br/>
time of year, but you can check the schedule online for that and plan around <br/>
it if your anniversary (or whatever) MUST have Pirates of the Caribbean!<br/>

(Did they ever re-open Roger Rabbits little cars?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>that is true.  We live five minutes away (in fact just drove by <br/>
delivering girl scout nuts to a girl) and go often so it&#39;s not an issue <br/>
to us, but it would be if I was traveling miles and miles.<br/>

disneyland.<br/>
