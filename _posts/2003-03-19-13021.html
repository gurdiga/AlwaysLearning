<div id="ygrps-yiv-243774622">I took my sons to a play yesterday and there was a school class sitting <br/>
behind us.  Before the play the teacher was asking them questions.  1st- What <br/>
do you like best about school:  (one answer) &quot;pay day&quot;.  2nd question- What <br/>
do you like least about school: (one answer)  &quot;having to pay money when I am <br/>
bad&quot;.<br/>
First off how sad.  Second when did they start using a paycheck and pay <br/>
punishment in school?  Or is this just speaking figuratively, like they <br/>
aren&#39;t using real money?  I never got paid.  LOL.  Couldn&#39;t believe this.  <br/>
After the play my son asked &quot;Do they have to give the school their own <br/>
money?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have an answer.  I just said it sounded like it.  And those children <br/>
didn&#39;t sound like they enjoyed it much.  But that maybe we weren&#39;t hearing <br/>
the whole story either.  These were about 6 or 7 year olds.  Not sure what <br/>
grade that would be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760283191">Can&#39;t you see that they are learning one of life&#39;s most important lessons?  Here it is: Spend most of your life doing things you don&#39;t really want to be doing, because you will get paid to do it!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s schooled friend (age 9) recently told us that she has agreed to read more books because &quot;she is capable of reading more than she is reading now&quot;.  She also knows that &quot;school is her job&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Schools are so full of incentives these days.  The kids around here are wearing necklaces with plastic books.  They earn a plastic book each time they meet certain reading goals.  And it is sad, because most parents think this is a good thing!<br/>
<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
hoping that nobody thinks I agree with the above!   (except the part about it being sad.  I do agree with that!)<br/>

Yes it is very sad, When the twins attended ps, they had them picking up <br/>
trash in exchange for these pink tickets. The trash was everywhere from the <br/>
school grounds themselves to the park that connected to it. These tickets <br/>
earned them a &quot;chance&quot; to win a pencil from the principal. So even after said <br/>
trash was picked up, that did not earn them the pencil, but rather put them <br/>
in a &quot;lottery&quot; for said writing instrument. The twins were in first grade at <br/>
that time. They were 6. When DH & I found out, we flipped. Apparently no <br/>
other parents had a problem with this idea.<br/>
<br/>
I was shocked and sickened, but what was worse is that my kids were made to <br/>
feel bad that their parents wouldn&#39;t allow them to participate. We went to <br/>
the school so that our &quot;issues&quot; could be be addressed face to face since my <br/>
initial phone call to the teacher was not enough. Perhaps no one had ever <br/>
thought of these issues because the kids are made to feel that this free <br/>
labor is somehow connected to having &quot;pirde&quot; in their school. I argued that <br/>
first: Don&#39;t you have paid custodians that should have &quot;pride&quot; in their jobs, <br/>
therefore, such trash should not exist in our childrens presence? If one <br/>
wants to learn pride from cleanliness, one should teach a child to throw <br/>
their trash in the can. Next on my list, safety: This park is a known hangout <br/>
for teens and has also been known to have both used condoms and used syringes <br/>
on the ground.  Not that I would have been happy with unused condoms or <br/>
syringes. In the scheme of safety, communicable deseases, sometimes life <br/>
threatening and always life altering,  had not even been considered. You know <br/>
what their response was??? The kids can wear gloves if they want. What???? I <br/>
must have looked absolutely deranged because my kids and hubby both turned <br/>
and said we should leave cuz mommy is gonna go off. Huh, that&#39;s when the <br/>
gloves came off and to this day I&#39;m shocked that no explicitives came spewing <br/>
out of my mouth. In the nicest voice I told them that they (Oak Park <br/>
Elementary and it&#39;s staff) made me physically ill that they would utilize the <br/>
labor of children without wage on the hopes of winning a pencil and although <br/>
we appreciate the assistance of the school in purchasing writing insturments, <br/>
I was more than capable of buying them whatever pencils they wanted. All the <br/>
while, DH is guiding me out by the hand. <br/>
<br/>
To this day my girls bring this event up, because of course we had to have a <br/>
big family discussion when we got home. Here they were 6 years old and <br/>
brainwashed to pick up trash or feel bad about it. One neighbor was shocked <br/>
at what my response was, and thought I was not being environmentally <br/>
conscious. We didn&#39;t speak for a year after that. Perhaps I have not made <br/>
that part clear though, we are environmentally concsious and do our best to <br/>
recycle, etc. but the environment was not my concern in this argument. Sadly <br/>
to say, this was only the first in many battles we endured before I had the <br/>
wits to yank them out of school. I&#39;ll always feel guilty about that.<br/>

Do you object to the school requiring the students to pick up trash, or to<br/>
the token reward for doing so?  There is hardly any &quot;pride&quot; involved if<br/>
you&#39;re being paid a token, IMO.  (I&#39;d have to agree that picking up trash in<br/>
a public park as part of school is crazy; safety should come first.)<br/>
<br/>
Too bad &quot;Punished By Rewards&quot; isn&#39;t required reading for the teachers<br/>
passing out the tokens for reading ;-)  That might be too large a book to<br/>
wear around the neck, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I objected to both. This was not the cleaning of their own classroom which to <br/>
me would signify more teamwork for the sake of ones immediate environment, <br/>
but rather the cleaning-up of crap that the school custodian is responsible <br/>
for. But my primary concern was their safety or lack thereof; note that the <br/>
teachers response was the choice of the kids to wear gloves if they wanted. I <br/>
mean safety wise, shouldn&#39;t they have worn gloves irregardless of choice? <br/>
Also realize that I am talking about public school and not the choices <br/>
children make while unschooled.<br/>

I know that feeling Rhonda... Zak went to 7 different pre-schools (one he<br/>
went to twice) before I got it that this was not going to work for either me<br/>
or he.  I remember in one pre-school the teacher telling me that she thought<br/>
Zak was ADD and ought to be on Ritalin so that he would comply better with<br/>
the instructions they were being given, because when he got into the &quot;real<br/>
world&quot; he was going to have to do as he was told.  You don&#39;t want to hear<br/>
the words that came out of my mouth to that one and also Zak came out of<br/>
that school that day.  <br/>
<br/>
Another one told me that at 4 he ought to be able to sit down and listen to<br/>
the story telling time for 45 mins instead of wanting to go outside and ride<br/>
a bicycle and playing on the swings.  This school wanted him to call her<br/>
Miss someoneorwother, another thing I don&#39;t like.  I was talking to this<br/>
woman and said to her &quot;I know you want the kids to call you Miss ???? but as<br/>
a grownup I&#39;m certainly not going to do that so what&#39;s your name, Debbie,<br/>
Joan, Alice&quot;  She looked so shocked that I wasn&#39;t going to call her Miss<br/>
????.  I think he lasted a week at that one.<br/>
<br/>
Zak told me a few weeks ago when I&#39;d been talking to a friend about<br/>
pre-schools that he thought everyone went to that many to try them out and<br/>
see new people all the time.  I thought that was a great way to look at<br/>
it...<br/>

I&#39;d known for a long time) was nervously trying to talk me out of <br/>
homeschooling, he told me about his neice&#39;s school where they had a great <br/>
little store with toys and stuff the kids would donate, and at school they <br/>
earned toy money, and could spend it in this store.<br/>
<br/>
I let him tell the whole store, explaining that it was a way for them to <br/>
learn about money and stores.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jerome, we live right near a Circle K!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He just looked at me.  He totally got it, and he was a little embarrassed, <br/>
but I saw him thinking and thinking about the idea that &quot;it&quot; didn&#39;t have to <br/>
be in school.  That spending real American money at a real convenience store <br/>
on real stuff beat the HECK out of spending pretend money on donated stuff.<br/>

&gt; goals.  And it is sad, because most parents think this is a<br/>
&gt; good thing!<br/>

talking<br/>
with her the first day she brought home her instrument. She spent most of<br/>
the time<br/>
explaining to me the incentive program they had...basically she earned<br/>
points for<br/>
every practice session, if she took outside lessons etc. I can&#39;t remember<br/>
what she<br/>
got if she earned enough points but she spent quite a bit of time planning<br/>
how she<br/>
was going to get it. such a shame....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do think sometimes they feel that the payment thing is the only alternative <br/>
for getting someone to do something they don&#39;t want to do.  Of course they <br/>
don&#39;t see the option of not making the child do it.  I guess what bothered me <br/>
more was that the conversation I overheard implied that the students had to <br/>
pay money for &quot;bad&quot; behavior.  Punishment by payment. But I am not a <br/>
punishment person anyway.<br/>
