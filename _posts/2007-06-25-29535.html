<div id="ygrps-yiv-628956195">Does anyone know of any camps in the US that are geared towards<br/>
unschoolers or at least are welcoming to unschoolers? I watched Indian<br/>
Summer last night and it reminded me that we wanted to start thinking<br/>
about our plans for 2008 and try to find something. We&#39;re looking for<br/>
camps that welcome the whole family. We don&#39;t mind camping in rustic<br/>
settings or tent sleeping. Any ideas?<br/>

<br/>
I am putting this <br/>

<br/>
together for 2007. And if all goes well I will be doing another <br/>
campout for 2008. I am not sure exactly what you are looking for but <br/>
maybe this will help.<br/>
<br/>
It is an unschooling campout at Lake Tahoe. I am going to be trying <br/>
to plan it in between Life is Good & L&L to have another option to <br/>
meet up with unschoolers, throughout the year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576140466">These aren&#39;t unschooling camps per se, but they are<br/>
family camps.  The City of Berkeley and City of<br/>
Oakland both host summer long family camps in the<br/>
wilderness of CA.  We are going to try it for a week<br/>
this year.  Here&#39;s one of the web addresses:<br/>

We have not been yet, but plan to. I was on the staff at Camp Westwind<br/>
for many summers and it is spectacular, remote and rustic. Although I<br/>
know that they have remodeled things since my days there and it may<br/>
not be as rustic as it once was.- Alyse</div>
