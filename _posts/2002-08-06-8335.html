<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022243785">Last year I made an effort to find homeschooled girls of similar ages <br/>
to my daughters to go on field trips and do some social things with.  <br/>
We found a nice group of moms and girls and had some fun and <br/>
interesting times together.<br/>
<br/>
One of the moms has decided she needs ways to motivate her daughter <br/>
to learn so she is starting a &quot;Silk Roads&quot; class.  The plan is for <br/>
each girl to choose a region of the world, preferably along the silk <br/>
roads trade route, to research and write about and bring the <br/>
information to share with the group.  The group will meet once a week <br/>
for this sharing of information as well as *fun* crafts, plays, <br/>
costume making and field trips.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked my girls if they wanted to participate.  I told them that <br/>
they would have to do &quot;homework&quot;.  Allison said she would try it and <br/>
see if she liked it.  Virginia said &quot;sure&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This whole thing bothers me.  The mom that is organizing it has said <br/>
numerous times that the girls are not interested in the world history <br/>
or geography aspects of the silk road but they are very excited about <br/>
the fun things and being together.<br/>
<br/>
Allison would probably enjoy the world history part of it because she <br/>
*is* interested in that.  Virginia likes doing projects and writing <br/>
so she would enjoy it.  However, it really bothers me that this mom <br/>
is doing it to trick her daughter into learning.<br/>
<br/>
How should I handle this in an unschooling way?  I&#39;d rather they <br/>
didn&#39;t go, on principle, but I feel I should leave it up to them.  I <br/>
feel it makes a mockery of learning.<br/>

Instead of treating it like homework or a kid-thing, do it together!  And <br/>
that would model for the other girl&#39;s mom that she could learn as well or <br/>
better and less stressfully if she and her mom would work together too.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was in girl scouts one season and they did Juliette Lowe day they <br/>
assigned countries, and the girls were to tell about Girl Scouts (or more <br/>
likely Girl Guides) in that country.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was assigned China.<br/>
<br/>
I told Holly there were no Girl Guides in China because it was a communist <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t sure I knew what I was talking about.  They had also told her <br/>
the flag should be blue and yellow.  (She had it in black outline and was <br/>
supposed to color it.<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time finding things around the house and online to show Holly <br/>
that truly, really, I wasn&#39;t crazy.<br/>
<br/>
So her presentation ended up being pretty cool, and she told that there are <br/>
Girl Guides in Hong Kong which has only lately become part of China, but <br/>
they&#39;re being phased out.<br/>
<br/>
She had a teammember who wanted to bring fortune cookies for their Chinese <br/>
food sample.  Fortune Cookies are American.  <br/>
<br/>
So Holly learned a lot and I discovered I had picked up more relevant trivia <br/>
than I had realized!   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same thing could be done with you guys and the silk road!<br/>
<br/>
I would think you could also not press your own daughter to write out her <br/>
research, but maybe to take a map or a piece of cloth or whatever all and <br/>
treat it like show and tell (which all the best presentations in the world <br/>
seem to be!) instead of &quot;a report.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this doesn&#39;t go well, your daughter will learn from experience that <br/>
too-contrived projects can be a bust.   But if it DOES go well she might be <br/>
inspired to be a...  sales executive!<br/>
designer<br/>
window dresser<br/>
inspirational speaker<br/>
politician &lt;g&gt;<br/>
historian<br/>
folklorist<br/>
anthropologist<br/>
<br/>
Maybe while she&#39;s looking things up you could point out where that <br/>
information comes from that she&#39;s finding.  Geographers, cartologists, <br/>
archeologists, historians...<br/>

I did not mention that this class is supposed to last a long time and <br/>
not be just a one or two day thing.<br/>
<br/>
The plan is for the class to be held every Thursday from 10-2 and for <br/>
it to move from geography to food, clothing, history, economics, art, <br/>
music and then religion.  In addition to my concern about the purpose <br/>
of the class being to trick the kids into learning, another concern I <br/>
have is that this would take up a lot of Allison and Virginia&#39;s time <br/>
at home.  Should this be given so much importance?  Will they still <br/>
take time for self-directed efforts? <br/>
<br/>
I *could* think of it as the same as anything I would offer to them <br/>

Pat, I&#39;ve had similar experiences. My daughter LOVES classes and group <br/>
projects of all kinds. When a Junior Great Books class started (years ago <br/>
now), I was completely sceptical. But it turned out great and it&#39;s because of <br/>
the attitude of the woman who runs it. And the fact that Zoe can quit anytime <br/>
it doesn&#39;t fit her needs. This year she will be doing eight (!) project/class <br/>
thingys, some lasting  all year. But the responsibility for doing the work, <br/>
etc. is up to her. <br/>
<br/>
So, if your daughters are excited about this, let them try it and see how it <br/>
goes. She won&#39;t have to trick them into learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329092842">Hi Pat -<br/>
What you&#39;re describing is like any of the classes my kids take.....the hard <br/>
part, for me, is to continue my own hands off/unschooling philosophy when <br/>
they are in &#39;schooling&#39; situations....and it can be very hard if  a child <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to participate attend one week for &#39;no reason&#39; or has a <br/>
different idea of how the class should go....I really have to watch my own <br/>
discomfort level and not let it affect dd&#39;s decisions/options.....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can get away from the other mother&#39;s motivations and just look at <br/>
the activity at face value....it is simply a time of getting together with <br/>
other girls and learning about other parts of the world....your daughters can <br/>
get whatever they want out of it....and they can stop going whenever, <br/>
too.....and they can speak up about what they are willing to do (enjoy coming <br/>
here and doing the activities but am not interested in doing the homework)....<br/>
<br/>
your friend&#39;s motivation doesn&#39;t have to be your motivation and you do not <br/>
have to participate in the coercion if your daughters don&#39;t want to <br/>
participate in something.....Also, (more of my baggage coming through!) don&#39;t <br/>
get sucked into doing more of the planning/organizing than you are willing to <br/>
do just bec. your friend is doing &#39;all the work&#39;....If this activity does not <br/>
interest you, find a way to be supportive of your daughters without being <br/>
involved in the stuff that doesn&#39;t interest you....<br/>
<br/>
Notice....you say, &quot;This whole thing bothers me&quot;.....but your daughters, <br/>
given all the information, are willing to give it a try....step back, take a <br/>
deep breath, go with the flow and trust yourself and your daughters.....<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s helpful! Good luck!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283612304">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you mean - my son in particular can sense my anxiety a<br/>
mile away and doesn&#39;t want anything to do with My Agenda, dressed up as<br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I don&#39;t see unschooling as a situation where I don&#39;t<br/>
introduce new ideas or try to foster excitement. Sometimes, people<br/>
(including kids) DO become interested in academic subjects after a fun<br/>
activity. Perhaps your friend&#39;s intentions are based in fear, or perhaps she<br/>
is just creatively, gently leading.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to have the learning vs. fun dichotomy set up in your<br/>
mind - if they are having fun together and doing fun projects, then that is<br/>
what they are doing - having fun! I hope you enjoy - I  am wondering if I<br/>
could do something like that here - we are going to make a big leap into<br/>
world history this year - a major gap in my own personal education. I should<br/>
say, I guess, that *I* am making the leap and I assume it will be of some<br/>
interest to my kids as I move along with my giant timeline down the back<br/>
hallway :-)<br/>
<br/>
Amy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so she would enjoy it.  However, it really bothers me that this mom<br/>
is doing it to trick her daughter into learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181657653">Dear Pat:  I was thinking about your situation.  In Great Falls, there<br/>
is no network.  People remain extremely exclusive within their own<br/>
church, and wouldn&#39;t even network with other churches.  Unschoolers and<br/>
non-religious homeschoolers tend to do their own thing.  But in another<br/>
town, Bozeman, I had a chance of meeting homeschoolers in a group.<br/>
Because of this experience, I realize I am not a group person, and, now,<br/>
the time I spend with a group is limited.  I don&#39;t want to get in a trap<br/>
of talking about other parents or kids who are misbehaving.  I think if<br/>
this mom is trying to get her kid to study geography and history through<br/>
a topic of the silk roads in a way that is not straight forward than it<br/>
is between her and her kids.  Your observations can be expressed if the<br/>
discussion comes up, but my advice is to just focus on your own way and<br/>
family and allow this parent to make a mistake.  I make parenting<br/>
mistakes all the time.  I try to go by my heart.  When I make a mistake<br/>
my father always tells me about it and it gets me mad, but if I realize<br/>
it on my own than I am okay, and learn from the humility of the moment.<br/>
If the behavior of someone in a group, the kid or parent, is negative,<br/>
perhaps it is better to use an &quot;I feel&quot; message and point out the<br/>
situation, not the cause of it because there may be many causes some we<br/>
don&#39;t even see.  Don&#39;t we all have an inner child that needs to be<br/>
nurtured?  And isn&#39;t it admirable when we can see this inner child in<br/>
other parents as well?  Lisa Hardiman<br/>

This sounds just like the homeschool group that we belong to. In fact,<br/>
we<br/>
meet on Thursdays, also!<br/>
We usually follow some sort of theme during the year and each meeting<br/>
incorporates craft projects, books, food or something about the theme. I<br/>
see<br/>
it as a way the group members can justify bringing their kids once a<br/>
week to<br/>
get together, because at least they are &quot;learning&quot; about something.<br/>
Otherwise, the diligent homeschoolers in our group could not see wasting<br/>
a<br/>
day just on kids playing together.<br/>
<br/>
All our kids also have the option of not participating if they choose -<br/>
I<br/>
think that&#39;s important. Sometimes the whole thing irritates me a bit,<br/>
too,<br/>
with importance given on individual reports or projects to give, and<br/>
then I<br/>
see my kids struggling a bit to complete their &quot;assignment&quot;. But in<br/>
retrospect, I realize we have had fun participating in these weekly<br/>
classes<br/>
and learning together in this non-threatening environment really makes<br/>
it<br/>
fun for all of us. The kids get a chance to see and play with other kids<br/>
and<br/>
us parents get a chance to talk, too.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you feel negative about the whole thing because it meets once a<br/>
week for 4 hours. To me, that is big time commitment that starts grating<br/>
on<br/>
me after a while and really gets old. But I continue going because my<br/>
kids<br/>
enjoy the whole thing. And I also like it because through the group, we<br/>
are<br/>
participating in activities and learning things we may not otherwise get<br/>
exposed to, at home. It&#39;s a little give and take, but hey, it DOES make<br/>
learning fun, and that&#39;s a good thing for all of us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825126716">Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how old your girls are? When our children were younger, it was much harder for me in those type of situtations. My skin would begin to crawl at the thought of so much instruction for activity at a young age. Our children have always been sooooo busy without anyone giving any type of direction. When situtations like this came up when ours were younger (which some still are!) I know that my feelings got in the way and our children sensed it and knew something was up. Thats just the way it was. I was able to stay netural at times, in areas that felt ok, maybe not ideal (whatever ideal is!!). Now that the older ones are older, the situtaions that I don&#39;t feel are to my liking, are mine. They participate in a variety of things because they are ready. Because they are branching out, reaching, growing, becoming more seperate. And making choices based on their experiences. If it doesn&#39;t feel right to them, they listen to that inner voice. Just like I did when they were younger and still do. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes sense!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Plus -- you might realize that your girls are going to, inevitably, be <br/>
involved in things where the other involved people have different agendas. My <br/>
kids don&#39;t only do things with other unschooled kids/families -- and <br/>
sometimes when they do something the other people are there for very <br/>
different reasons. Sometimes it doesn&#39;t work out well - sometimes it does - <br/>
even things that are really obviously nonacademic are sometimes fraught with <br/>
this kind of dichotomy. My 11 yo is going to soccer daycamp this week and it <br/>
is OBVIOUS that there are kids there because they LOOOOOVE to play soccer and <br/>
there are other kids there because they had to be babysat during the day and <br/>
this was what their parents chose for them for this week. Plus - there are <br/>
kids there whose parents are pushing them to be soccer-superstars and other <br/>
kids who are there because their parents decided they needed more exercise <br/>
and so on and on. The coaches probably have totally different ideas, too, <br/>
about what the camp is &quot;really&quot; for -- but as long as my daughter wants to go <br/>
and find it meets her own interests - I don&#39;t concern myself with why the <br/>
other kids are there and why the coaches are coaching, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, a LOT of the stuff they do at soccer camp is designed to &quot;trick&quot; the <br/>
kids into learning something --- they play all kinds of different games, each <br/>
designed to help them learn a certain skill or strategy. That&#39;s okay - they <br/>
have fun playing the games and they LIKE to learn. I&#39;d take that mom&#39;s <br/>
attitude as sort of being like that of the soccer coaches -- assume kids LOVE <br/>
to learn - provide them with activities that are fun, in and of themselves, <br/>
AND during which they pick up some information or cocepts about something <br/>
interesting -- sounds cool to me. <br/>
<br/>
If she started sending hom boring &quot;homework&quot; or started sitting them down and <br/>
giving them tests on what they should have been tricked into learning, then <br/>
I&#39;d have a problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
It CAN have a huge impact, of course -- the attitudes of the other kids and <br/>
the coaches could make it something that my daughter chooses to not do. But <br/>
it might be really fun, too. <br/>

&lt;&lt; So, if your daughters are excited about this, let them try it and see how <br/>
it <br/>
goes. She won&#39;t have to trick them into learning.<br/>

<br/>
I think a study of the silk road sounds very SCA-ish.  <br/>
That was the theme of the Twelfth Night feast in Denver last year--each <br/>
course was from a different culture along the road, and the servers changed <br/>
costume for each course too.<br/>
<br/>
Is this mom in the SCA?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re in northern Colorado, she&#39;s just recycling what she learned last <br/>
winter!  LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631787791">This sounds just like the homeschool group that we belong to. In fact, we<br/>
meet on Thursdays, also!<br/>
We usually follow some sort of theme during the year and each meeting<br/>
incorporates craft projects, books, food or something about the theme. I see<br/>
it as a way the group members can justify bringing their kids once a week to<br/>
get together, because at least they are &quot;learning&quot; about something.<br/>
Otherwise, the diligent homeschoolers in our group could not see wasting a<br/>
day just on kids playing together.<br/>
<br/>
All our kids also have the option of not participating if they choose - I<br/>
think that&#39;s important. Sometimes the whole thing irritates me a bit, too,<br/>
with importance given on individual reports or projects to give, and then I<br/>
see my kids struggling a bit to complete their &quot;assignment&quot;. But in<br/>
retrospect, I realize we have had fun participating in these weekly classes<br/>
and learning together in this non-threatening environment really makes it<br/>
fun for all of us. The kids get a chance to see and play with other kids and<br/>
us parents get a chance to talk, too.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you feel negative about the whole thing because it meets once a<br/>
week for 4 hours. To me, that is big time commitment that starts grating on<br/>
me after a while and really gets old. But I continue going because my kids<br/>
enjoy the whole thing. And I also like it because through the group, we are<br/>
participating in activities and learning things we may not otherwise get<br/>
exposed to, at home. It&#39;s a little give and take, but hey, it DOES make<br/>
learning fun, and that&#39;s a good thing for all of us.<br/>

&gt; The plan is for the class to be held every Thursday from 10-2 and for<br/>
&gt; it to move from geography to food, clothing, history, economics, art,<br/>
&gt; music and then religion.  In addition to my concern about the purpose<br/>

&gt; have is that this would take up a lot of Allison and Virginia&#39;s time<br/>
&gt; at home.  Should this be given so much importance?  Will they still<br/>
&gt; take time for self-directed efforts?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I *could* think of it as the same as anything I would offer to them<br/>
&gt; that they have not asked for.  They would always have the option to<br/>
&gt; say no.  I wonder why I feel so negative about this?<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think if<br/>
this mom is trying to get her kid to study geography and history through<br/>
a topic of the silk roads in a way that is not straight forward than it<br/>
is between her and her kids.  Your observations can be expressed if the<br/>
discussion comes up, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The discussion IS up, though, because either the girls participate or not, <br/>
and the reasons why they might not might be of interest to the organizing <br/>
family.  And if the girls do go and the mom isn&#39;t willing to &quot;make them&quot; do <br/>
their &quot;work&quot; (if/when that could be an issue) that too could be both <br/>
disruptive and instructive.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try to undo the project, if it involved one of my kids, but I <br/>
would be wary of &quot;the project&quot; making my kids feel inferior or wrong.<br/>

<br/>
It could be disruptive to the other girls in the group or the mothers <br/>
that *are* making their kids do stuff they don&#39;t want to do if <br/>
Allison and Virginia do things a little differently.<br/>
<br/>
We tried volunteering at a nature center with this same mom last <br/>
winter.  We had to call it quits when she came up with a project *for <br/>
educational* purposes that made no sense to me at all and the kids <br/>
were less than enthusiastic about.  This mom still goes to the nature <br/>
center and they still invite us to do things with them.  I just told <br/>
her the girls were not really into the nature center any more.  <br/>
Before we quit, I did try to talk her out of the particular project <br/>
we didn&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she just has me pegged as a negative person and will be able to <br/>
use that in the event we decide to leave the silk roads class.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, how upfront should I be here?<br/>

<br/>
No.  The &quot;might quit&quot; is implied in anyone&#39;s starting a project.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say &quot;I&#39;m concerned that this will be too schoolish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mom won&#39;t be thinking she&#39;e planning to be schoolish, but fun!  And your <br/>
stated concern will probably help her make the less schoolish choice at each <br/>
step along the way.<br/>

of there being a right and wrong way to do it. I do see that this mom who<br/>
set it up probably sees it this way but you don&#39;t need to :-)<br/>
<br/>
Look at it as a resource or opportunity to do something that doesn&#39;t<br/>
normally stumble through your lives.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it as an opportunity to put the idea out there for others to see<br/>
that they can approach something creatively too. (I bet there will be moms<br/>
who think &quot;I didn&#39;t know we could do it that way!&quot;)<br/>

Could there be belly dancing by any chance??  Now THAT sounds fun!<br/>
