<div id="ygrps-yiv-441785988"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;ve been looking into Intentional communities for a<br/>
&gt;year  or so and am DYING to be in one.  I too have an<br/>
&gt;uninterested husband.  I really think though that if<br/>
&gt;he gave it a chance he would find the &#39;honest work <br/>
&gt;with a clear purpose&#39; very fulfilling. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that a spouse should stand in the way<br/>
of your dreams.  Spouses should help you realize your<br/>
dreams, as you help them realize theirs.  But that&#39;s<br/>
just me.<br/>
<br/>
I will say however, that I was just discussing this<br/>
last night with a couple people.  Women crave<br/>
community, and feel free in our culture to seek it in<br/>
many ways: at work, with moms, through hobbies and<br/>
interests, etc.  Men crave community as well, and<br/>
desire to be approved of and emotionally supported. <br/>
But in our culture they are not free to persue that,<br/>
except in a mostly superficial way.  I think that men<br/>
stand to benefit MORE than women socially in<br/>
community, because they get what they don&#39;t have<br/>
anywhere else usually, and in many cases did not even<br/>
realize they were lacking.<br/>
<br/>
Men in our culture have this &quot;lone wolf&quot; image.  They<br/>
are not supposed to need anyone, can stand on their<br/>
own, are knowledgeable and strong and independent. <br/>
When they have a family, they still have this &quot;head of<br/>
the household, man of the house, breadwinner&quot; dynamic<br/>
going on, even if they are not the main income for the<br/>
family.)  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all a crock of hooey as far as I am concerned. <br/>
Men need people and are social creatures just like<br/>
women.  They suffer doubt as much as we do (although<br/>
they are not as permitted to show it without shame)<br/>
and they benefit from emotional support (although they<br/>
are not free to seek it without ridicule) and they<br/>
need good friends of their own sex (although real<br/>
relationships between men on our culture are few and<br/>
precious because of their social expectations.)  <br/>
<br/>
Men are mostly afraid of change, because the unknown<br/>
could bring embarrassment and expose their faults. <br/>
They are not as cultrually permitted to have faults. <br/>
They are terrified of failure too.  They are not<br/>
comfortable following intuition to realize dreams and<br/>
goals without facts and logic and caution supporting<br/>
those moves.  So they resist community because of<br/>
these many reasons, but once they get there, they are<br/>
overjoyed and become it&#39;s staunchest proponents and<br/>
protectors.  They take up the mantle of village men as<br/>
easily as breathing, and shake the burden of aloneness<br/>
as quickly as a wet coat. <br/>
<br/>
This is what I have seen in men in Intentional<br/>
Community.  They become strong voices for education<br/>
and change about the way boys are raised and the<br/>
cultural expectations and design.  They become<br/>
fascinated with interpersonal relationship dynamics,<br/>
of which they have had little experience usually.<br/>
Women crave community, but men benefit just as much,<br/>
or more, from it.<br/>

<br/>
I just watched &quot;Witness&quot; again this week.  Harrison Ford drama, involving the <br/>
Amish.<br/>
<br/>
The whole barnraising scene was fascinating for the male interactions.  <br/>
<br/>
At one point in the story he&#39;s seriously considering staying there with them <br/>
and living within that culture.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s all a crock of hooey as far as I am concerned. <br/>
Men need people and are social creatures just like<br/>
women. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Men and women are not just the same.  The women&#39;s movement tried with words <br/>
to make it so, but it&#39;s not so.<br/>
<br/>
Women pass culture.  Men take care of the physical plant and they hunt and <br/>
maintain safety.<br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;s a ton of overlap, in definition and task, but women&#39;s social <br/>
needs (instincts) are not the same as men&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people I know thought so too until they had children who were not all <br/>
male or female, and they changed their minds.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They are not<br/>
comfortable following intuition to realize dreams and<br/>
goals without facts and logic and caution supporting<br/>
those moves. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s one of those differences.<br/>
<br/>
How about hermits?  Men.  Those who live alone in cabins in the mountains or <br/>
in caves or whatever are male.   When women live as hermits they create a <br/>
culture with 35 cats.  (Stereotype, or something many of us have seen?)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Women crave community, but men benefit just as much,<br/>
or more, from it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That I absolutely believe.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess the only part that offended me was the &quot;Crock&quot; (which is short for <br/>
crock of sh*t) because I don&#39;t think men and women are the same.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen men become fascinated with interpersonals at a later age, too.  <br/>
It&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences are fun to play with, and I think <br/>
some are definitely stronger in men, and interpersonal/intrapersonal isn&#39;t <br/>
one of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Those male friends I was talking about having in the unschooling forum this <br/>
week are every one really good at interpersonals, and a big reason they talk <br/>
to me is because I&#39;ll discuss that with them.  Many of their male friends <br/>
just look at them quizzically, because they don&#39;t see those subtle <br/>
interpersonal things.   So they run their observations by me, because I&#39;ve <br/>
been doing that thing since we were little, and they remember.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I didn&#39;t want to cuss here.  This is not the<br/>
Totallyinsane list after all :)  <br/>
<br/>
I certainly did not mean to imply that men and women<br/>
were the same, but I guess I did.  I don&#39;t believe<br/>
that at all.  What I meant was that men and women are<br/>
both &quot;social creatures&quot; or part of a race of social<br/>
animals, if you will, not that their social needs were<br/>
identical.  They are not.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize the fact that not only is our body<br/>
chemistry different, but the function of our brains<br/>
are different from men.  We are wired differently for<br/>
different tasks.  But Men need and benefit from<br/>
community just as much or more so than women, in<br/>
GENERAL (yes there are exceptions, odd birds, hermits,<br/>
etc).  Men benefit from having same sex deep and<br/>
supportive friendships, they benefit from not having<br/>
to carry the burden of being the adult male alone,<br/>
they benefit from being part of a larger group,<br/>
mentoring younger males, learning from older males,<br/>
respecting and interacting with the famles of the<br/>
group in different ways than is typical in our<br/>
culture.  The whole village/community structure is<br/>
beneficial for them, growing up, and as adults.<br/>
<br/>
That was what I meant, that men need more and<br/>
different and better social interaction than they get<br/>
in modern western culture.  I meant that men and women<br/>
are both people, and all people need this.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
mean they should persue it in exactly the same manner<br/>
or for exactly the same reasons.  I hope that is more<br/>
clear.<br/>

I totally agree with that.  Now I see what you meant was a crock of hooey ! <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t remember my source, but I read something that said many men<br/>
don&#39;t have the same abilities that women have to read facial expression.<br/>
 And I think this partially explains why they don&#39;t like &quot;chick flicks&quot;.<br/>
 In a movie like Emma, the characters are maintaining a polite facade<br/>
socially, while feeling strong emotions underneath.  I can see all kinds<br/>
of emotions flickering in their faces, but I don&#39;t know if my husband<br/>
can.  (He often can&#39;t &quot;place&quot; a familiar actor by his face when I can.)<br/>
