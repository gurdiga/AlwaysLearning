<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848714200">Yesterday Keith and I saw Master and Commander.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to tell anything about it, because what made it so great for me <br/>
was that I knew very little about what was going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not historical in fact, but it&#39;s CAREFULLY historical in detail.  <br/>
It is BEAUTIFULLY filmed.   <br/>
<br/>
There were a couple of rough spots, but they were character building and <br/>
furthered the plot and I cheered up in no time (though there were a couple of <br/>
times I held my husband&#39;s hand really tight and forgot to breathe).<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend it for adults and teens.  Younger kids could find it too <br/>
frightening or boring, I think.  When it&#39;s on DVD you could at least show them <br/>
some ofthe good parts, or as Holly will, wander in and out as she wishes.<br/>

prisoners of war in Japanese prison camps) the other night with Rod. Those <br/>
poor husbands and their sore hands. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just tried reading Master and Commander but couldn&#39;t seem to get into it. <br/>
I&#39;m going to see the movie, though.<br/>
