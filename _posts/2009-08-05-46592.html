<div id="ygrps-yiv-500969164">Greetings from Southern Oregon -<br/>
<br/>
Hooray for the internet!  Thank goodness for you, Sandra Dodd, and all of the folks here who are joining our children in learning and growing together!<br/>
<br/>
I have been making forays into the homesteading movement - my five year old daughter and I have been living in an off the grid tipi village for the past year, and loving the life this earth gifts us with!  Recently I have been looking at options for the upcoming winter, as pioneering is HARD.  I have dreams of small town or rural subsistence farming, homesteading... and of living in community with other families who unschool as well.  The two seem to go together naturally, but I&#39;m surprised at how rarely I hear talk of this lifeway.<br/>
<br/>
I am re-reading My Antonia by Willa Cather - and would like to recommend it to anyone who read it years ago, or who never read it, and who is entranced by the pioneering folk who broke sod and during the first back-to-the-land movement in this country.  It&#39;s a classic, and can be found in any library or used book store.  I myself grew up on a &quot;subsistence farm&quot; that my mother manifested in the early eighties. It was not really successful.. but it seems to me now that a cooperative homesteading approach may be more feasible... for the radical unschooling and homesteading movements are (again) on the rise!<br/>
<br/>
Another wonderful reading is that of Ralph Borsodi, Flight From the City - An Experiment of Creative Living On the Land. This paper explores the homesteading movement of the 1920&#39;s and 30&#39;s, and can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0302hsted/030204borsodi/030204borsoditoc.html">http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0302hsted/030204borsodi/030204borsoditoc.html</a><br/>
<br/>
So happy to have met you - and looking forward to talking more!<br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t one of the basic tenets of unschooling that anyone forced to do  <br/>
anything will wilt? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This might not be the best list for discussing &quot;homesteading.&quot;  Having  <br/>
had relatives who actually, literally did homestead (take wild land  <br/>
and make a farm or ranch and live there long enough to own it), I&#39;m  <br/>
not crazy about the current use of it to mean &quot;playing hippies in  <br/>
town&quot; (I know it&#39;s not all just that, but some of it is).<br/>
<br/>
Talking about gardens and solar panels is fine with me as long as it&#39;s  <br/>
about helping kids learn about them.  Please keep the topics toward  <br/>
what will help people unschool.<br/>

describe families who were living independent of oil, water, and schools.<br/>
They were using alternative energy, composting toilets, collecting<br/>

It looks like a hard life going back to the land and to survive kids would<br/>
have to do a lot of hard work and possibly be very obedient--which doesn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have many success stories other than using our garden to eat dinners. my son and i go out and pick herbs or veggies to go with our dinner. I also use it as a tool to teach my son we have to water our plants every day. I wish we had the land to grow all our meals from but we r doing as much as we can. <br/>

<br/>
Yes, probably.:)<br/>
Homesteading is really living more self-reliant rather than just making choices for lower impact on the earth&#39;s resources. There are several of us unschoolers out here in the SE who are making choices both for right now (reducing impact) and for long-term (mini-farms, large gardens etc...)<br/>
<br/>
One book I really love that Kelly Lovejoy recently recommended is &quot;The Backyard Homestead&quot; which explains how to make smaller spaces more usable for growing food.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s really great to consider our own needs for moving towards a lower impact lifestyle while also considering other family member&#39;s desires and how it all plays out as we work together with different ideals.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to expand my garden every year and choose things that help all of us without taking away anyone else&#39;s choice...things like rain barrels and hanging laundry to dry and other things I truly enjoy. I love talking about how the kids and dh move in and out of these interests of mine, embracing parts and leaving me to other parts like most of the beekeeping! It&#39;s all part of the unschooling flow.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a big huge &quot;it depends&quot;. I know of a family in which the children have little to no choice about their homesteading lifestyle and are expected to do X amount of work. Obedience IS part of their homestead and survival. I think they are missing out on a lot because it isn&#39;t by choice.<br/>
<br/>
I know another family quite well (she may chime in here) who has an amazing farm and CSA and who lives quite consensually with her children and dh. She owns her passion for the self-sufficient life and they have a harmonious and peaceful lifestyle, without all of the burden of guilt and hard-work ethic that my Dad shouldered growing up on a farm. So it all depends on whether the family entered the lifestyle as a choice, working out the various differences with respect or if it&#39;s expected just because the parents decided it&#39;s better.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect my children to share my values, yet I do expect the members of my family to allow me the space to pursue those things. We all support each other, even if we don&#39;t all share the passion.<br/>

What about powering their games with the bike. There are the old sewing machines that ran with a foot pedal. It seems like that could be used to generate power and might be easier to do while gaming than a bike. I would love to get some exercise while game playing, but it might require more coordination than I have. I wonder if there is a way to charge up a handheld game system while riding around town.

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, as a fellow westerner, I think of homesteading in the historic  <br/>
sense, too; we need to get with the times ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 From Wikipedia:<br/>
<br/>
Currently the term &#39;homesteading&#39;[1] applies to anyone who is a limb  <br/>
of the back-to-the-land movement and who chooses to live a  <br/>
sustainable, self-sufficient lifestyle. While land is no longer freely  <br/>
available in most areas of the world, homesteading remains as a way of  <br/>
life. A new movement, called &#39;urban homesteading&#39;, can be viewed as a  <br/>
simple livinglifestyle, incorporating small-scale agriculture,  <br/>
sustainable and permaculture gardening, and home food production and  <br/>
storage into suburban or city living.<br/>
Certain progressive activists are attempting to redefine the term  <br/>
based on a few limited successes in New York courts. According to  <br/>
them, homesteading may also refer to the practice of squatting �  <br/>
occupying an abandoned or unoccupied space or building that the  <br/>
squatter does not own, rent or otherwise have permission to use.[2]<br/>

Sandra, as a fellow westerner, I think of homesteading in the historic<br/>
sense, too; we need to get with the times ;-)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how the growth of language and culture goes, though.  Some  <br/>
people resist the change and some people reckless run toward  <br/>
&quot;whatever.&quot;  And between the two of those, the changes have both  <br/>
momentum and brakes so that the language remains recognizeable or the  <br/>
culture stays alive.<br/>
<br/>
If language is going to change, it should be for a purpose and it  <br/>
should make sense.<br/>
<br/>
Being from the western U.S., and being from New Mexico specifically, I  <br/>
will still continue to stand and guard against the loud ignorance of  <br/>
people who thought all the Indians died in the 19th century, and that  <br/>
anyone vaguely Hispanic is part of &quot;Latino culture.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What works in New York is quite often lame and goofy in New Mexico.   <br/>
I&#39;m not conservative about everything, God knows, but about language I  <br/>
am.<br/>
<br/>
And this small-scale gardening, I must say that I ate my whole potato  <br/>
crop the other day--about a dozen tiny potatoes, the biggest one the  <br/>
size of a golf ball.  And I&#39;ve eaten most of the tomatoes straight off  <br/>
the vine, because they don&#39;t get ahead of the curve.  But then I live  <br/>
in the desert where it&#39;s unnatural to try to grow anything, so pretty  <br/>
much I&#39;m using way more water and time than it&#39;s worth.  Cheaper to  <br/>
buy greenouse tomatoes at the store a hundred yards out the back gate.  <br/>
If I were near the Rio Grande and had a field with irrigation rights,  <br/>
it would be a little more sensible, but here, eight miles from the  <br/>
river, not so much. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If people are growing vegetables for fun, that&#39;s great.  If they&#39;re  <br/>
too poor to buy food from the store, they should go for it.  But if  <br/>
they&#39;re growing vegetables (as I was) just for funs that doesn&#39;t make  <br/>
them homesteaders, nor are they likely to sustain their families  <br/>
unless they live where there&#39;s a whole lot of rain.  And some people do.<br/>
<br/>
But what it has to do with unschooling is slim.  And what it has to do  <br/>
with language and clarity is fat.<br/>

You don&#39;t have to use watering plants as a tool to teach.  If you water<br/>
your plants because they need water, kids will pick up on this idea. <br/>
Depending on where one lives and what plants they grow, watering<br/>
everyday may or may not be something that has to be done.<br/>
<br/>
Just like everything else in life, learning happens through interested<br/>
doings.  If a kid is interested in helping with gardening, they will<br/>
pick up on the details of how that&#39;s done and done well.  If the point<br/>
is teaching a child about watering, many other ideas may be lost through<br/>
that narrow focus.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552037795">Oh my gosh!  I&#39;d probably fall off the bike while trying to use a controller!  When I belonged to a health club (pre-kids), they had a bank of tv&#39;s set up in front of the exercise equipment.  I always made sure to be there at 7pm so I could watch Jeopardy while I exercised.  I could never figure out how to read & walk or bike & read without losing my balance.<br/>
<br/>
I remember Ed Begley Jr. had a reality show a few years ago.  It was mostly about his gardening, solar panels, using rain barrels to catch water and similar things.  I remember he rode an exercise bike to power his toaster in the mornings.  That might be a place to start if someone is interested in powering themselves.<br/>

What about powering their games with the bike. There are the old sewing machines that ran with a foot pedal. It seems like that could be used to generate power and might be easier to do while gaming than a bike. I would love to get some exercise while game playing, but it might require more coordination than I have. I wonder if there is a way to charge up a handheld game system while riding around town. That would be cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you chimed in, because I don&#39;t like naming people when they aren&#39;t in the conversation!:) Anyone who wants to talk about following your own passion into homesteading while radical unschooling really should talk to Danielle. It&#39;s a whole different reality than one where the parents expect the kids to join into the lifestyle without questioning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a joy to be around such families, whether they farm or live in the city or on a bus or??? The philosophies remain the same.<br/>
