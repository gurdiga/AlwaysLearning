<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088117179">My friend Jay loves conspiracy theories and signs and omens.<br/>
He LOVES that stuff to pieces.  <br/>
<br/>
For those who do NOT like that stuff one bit, I advise you to save this to <br/>
read later.  Or if you&#39;re having company and have a lot to do today, let it <br/>
slide.  It has to do with unpleasant current political realities and the <br/>
significance of dates.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and first, a distraction!  (for those who want to close screens without <br/>
reading anything alarming and frustrating)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching Sam Rockford movies, and so I watched The Green Mile.   <br/>
There is a sadness to it, but there is way more big good upliftingness (or <br/>
was for me, anyway).  It can&#39;t be recommended to everyone, and I shooed Holly <br/>
away a couple of times (although now that it&#39;s done I think she could handle <br/>
it whole or handle more parts).  I haven&#39;t much liked Stephen King stuff but <br/>
this I really like.  I forgot to tell her Stand By Me is also based on a <br/>
Stephen King story.   She loves that one.  She was really interested in this <br/>
one too.<br/>
<br/>
Sam Rockwell played a very bad and very irriting man.  He did a good job.<br/>
<br/>
Okay now, if you don&#39;t want to know what Osama bin Laden might be thinking <br/>
and some way-pre-U.S. motivation for us to get our butts kicked, close this <br/>
window until later.   And I left Jay&#39;s website link/sigline.  I&#39;ve known him <br/>
for 25 years, and he really is this weird, and smart, and twitchy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I should have thought of this myself -- the biggest victory of Islam over the<br/>
<br/>
Crusaders took place on July 4.<br/>

Why July 4 is significant to Islamists<br/>

On Sunday, one of the &quot;experts&quot; in the endless parade of experts on cable news<br/>
<br/>
stated the obvious: &quot;I am unaware of any special significance of the date <br/>
Sept.<br/>
<br/>
11.&quot; His implication was that there is no reason to anticipate a terror attack<br/>
<br/>
on July 4 because bin Laden didn&#39;t use date significance as a basis for<br/>
<br/>
selecting 9-11. Although he was technically accurate, he was pretty far from<br/>
<br/>
correct. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bin Laden is trying to raise the entire Muslim world to Jihad. Creating the<br/>
<br/>
mystique of the Chosen is central to his goal, and symbolism is the greatest<br/>
<br/>
weapon in his arsenal (thus far). Consider what he said (twice) in his<br/>
<br/>
post-Sept. 11 video: &quot;… after 80 years, the sword has come to America …&quot; He <br/>
was<br/>
<br/>
clearly referring to the resolution passed by the U.S. Congress endorsing the<br/>
<br/>
partition of Palestine (creation of a Zionist homeland) on Sept. 11, 1922. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Experts on American news networks continually warn us that al-Qaida may be<br/>
<br/>
encoding secret messages to sleeper cells in their videos and communiqués, but<br/>
<br/>
bin Laden speaks openly, relying on us not knowing even our own history, let<br/>
<br/>
alone Islamic history. Which brings us to July 4. We, in our narcissism, <br/>
assume<br/>
<br/>
that July 4 is all about us. But to Muslims it is a day of ultimate triumph. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On July 4, 1197, Saladin (Salah al-Din) completely annihilated the 20,000-man<br/>
<br/>
Crusader army at the battle of the Horns of Hattin, driving the &quot;Christians&quot;<br/>
<br/>
from the Holy Land until the 20th century. And we can be sure it is not lost <br/>
on<br/>
<br/>
bin Laden that Saladin won this battle in spite of the fact that the Crusaders<br/>
<br/>
carried with them the &quot;True Cross&quot; (the True Cross was a relic designated by<br/>
<br/>
Constantine&#39;s mother during the initial phase of the paganization of<br/>
<br/>
Christianity). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, July 4 is a very likely candidate for a terrorist strike, albeit<br/>
<br/>
only if the Islamists feel they have the means to achieve a final victory over<br/>
<br/>
the U.S. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first question is, do they? Recently, al-Qaida spokesman Abu Ghaith <br/>
promised<br/>
<br/>
to kill 4,000,000 of us, referring to America as &quot;Hubal.&quot; Hubal was the last <br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
the largest of the 364 pagan gods in the Kaaba to be toppled by Muhammad<br/>
<br/>
(al-ilah, the predecessor to Allah, was left standing). The image of Hubal was<br/>
<br/>
so large that Ali (Muhammad&#39;s son and the first Imam) had to stand on the<br/>
<br/>
Prophet&#39;s shoulders to push it over. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second question is, clearly, is bin Laden ready to stand on the Prophet&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
shoulders now? That really should be a role of the 12th Imam (Al Mahdi – the<br/>
<br/>
long-awaited Muslim chosen one who will convert the whole world by the sword).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe bin Laden has been hanging around a guy in really old clothes for a<br/>
<br/>
reason: Mullah Omar wears the Cloak of Muhammad (which he stole from a museum <br/>
in<br/>
<br/>
Kandahar). We all know neither clothes nor symbols make the man, but in an<br/>
<br/>
eschatologically-based war, image and deeds together can be larger than life.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, most of Europe capitulated before Tiger tanks bearing swastikas and<br/>
<br/>
the mere idea of blitzkrieg. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is reported that Bin Laden writes poetry in the style of Saladin. For bin<br/>
<br/>
Laden, defeating the Crusader army and knocking over Hubal on July 4 would be<br/>
<br/>
the stuff of which epic poems are made.<br/>
