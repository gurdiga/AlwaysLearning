<div id="ygrps-yiv-340463434">&lt;&lt; I had a major crush on David Bowie (still do as a<br/>
matter of fact!).  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was his first American fan.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote him a fan letter, it came back, I researched where to send it, it <br/>
arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I knew that, because he sent me a long, full page typed letter, signed it <br/>
cute, sent me photostatic copies (pre-Xerox) of his publicity shots, and a <br/>
full front section of a newspaper he was on/in (Chelsea news?  I have it all <br/>
somewhere, but not all in one place.)<br/>
<br/>
I saved the big envelope, but gave the stamps to a friend.<br/>
<br/>
The orginal letter is in some safe place (darn me, when we moved...) but I <br/>
definitely have it.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a copy on the wall here in my office.  <br/>
<br/>
it starts off &quot;Dear Sandra, <br/>
When I called in this, my manager&#39;s office, a few moments ago I was handed my <br/>
very first American fan letter - and it was from you.  I was so pleased that <br/>
I had to sit down and type an immediate reply...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was 1967.  My friends would come over and say &quot;Yeah, but who IS he?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My uncle was the manager of a C&W station in Amarillo, and they would get <br/>
promotional albums.  I had a cousin my age, had an old light-up juke box in <br/>
her bedroom, had music of all sorts, and he would let her go through the <br/>
non-C&W stuff and keep what she wanted.   She didn&#39;t keep this one (the promo <br/>
of his first album) and it came to me.<br/>
<br/>
It was weird, and interesting, and I wrote him a letter.  I had told him I <br/>
liked his writing, and the songs were good.  I think I&#39;d told him they were <br/>
as good as the Beatles, maybe, or some such.  I wish I had kept a copy of <br/>
what I wrote.  <br/>
<br/>
When he came to Santa Fe to film The Man Who Fell to Earth a couple of years <br/>
later, my friends were saying &quot;GO MEET HIM!&quot;  I didn&#39;t.  I was embarrassed or <br/>
afraid he wouldn&#39;t remember me or something, and I didn&#39;t care as much then <br/>
as I had before.  <br/>
<br/>
The letter was sweet.  I had offered to start a fan club.  He said &quot;There is <br/>
a Fan Club here in England, but if things go well in the States then we&#39;ll <br/>
have one there I suppose.  It&#39;s a little early to even think about it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hope one day to get to America.  my manager tells me lots about it as he <br/>
has been there many times with other acts he manages.  I was watching an old <br/>
film on TV the other night called &quot;No Down Payment&quot; a great film, but rather <br/>
depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way of Life.  However, <br/>
shortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American <br/>
poet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that evened the score.  I am <br/>
sure that that is nearer the real America...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He asked me to write and tell me more about myself.  I did.  I always figured <br/>
I was a reject for being fourteen years old.  But probably he was swept away <br/>
in being busy getting famous.  And I was getting swept away in my interest in <br/>
folk music, and my whirlwind of high school stuff, playing guitar, going to <br/>
all-State, going to college early, and it was okay.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had thumb-tacked the newspaper to the ceiling of my room (acoustical tile) <br/>
and it was there for two years.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing about the newspaper was I got my first taste of everyday <br/>
British English, neither literary nor television or movie script.  <br/>
Advertisements and the everyday descriptions of things.   A truck&#39;s engine <br/>
had caught fire.  But I had to figure that out, from a short article that <br/>
said a lorry had had a fire under its bonnet.  I was thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Ther letter&#39;s on PITT stationery (the manager&#39;s stationery, Kenneth Pitt) and <br/>
there are very few typos.  Good typist.  That impressed me too!  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t buy any more of his albums, anyway--by the time he was openly <br/>
available I was immersed in folk music.  I bought some current acoustic stuff <br/>
(Elton John, Joni Mitchell, Carol King), but mostly I was collecting field <br/>
recordings of traditional stuff ballads and everyday songs.  Then I got <br/>
involved in Renaissance music, and I had a sexy, funny boyfriend from India <br/>
and... one thing lead to another and here I am now hanging out with you guys!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010775067">Wow!  The only fan letter I&#39;ve ever written was to Tommy Smothers who<br/>
didn&#39;t answer me.  I really had expected him to as I&#39;d needed some<br/>
guidance on becoming a comedian.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772954946">David Bowie, huh?  Well, I almost hate to admit it in front of his first<br/>
American fan, but he always gave me the creeps.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my first sexual dream involved Lorne Green.  Guess it takes all<br/>
kinds   :)<br/>

DOH!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  I was at the doctor, though, and it&#39;s no longer early.<br/>
<br/>
I have a little air brace now which they said I should wear outside the <br/>
house, but it doesn&#39;t fit in any of my shoes.  Keith wants to buy me combat <br/>
boots.   Whatever.  Today I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m off duty of caring right now.<br/>
