<div id="ygrps-yiv-20236175">**The easiest &quot;bookish&quot; thing for kids is &quot;Schoolhouse Rock,&quot; and their songs <br/>
about parts of speech.**<br/>
<br/>
The Sunday Target ad this week has the Schoolhouse Rock DVD for ten bucks. <br/>
(and The Princess Bride for $7.50, but that&#39;s another subject entirely)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784231998">That was COOL!  Some of the comments at YouTube:<br/>
<br/>
ya go to school to learn stuff you dont need and be graded in stupid  <br/>
ways in place underfunded cause officials take it all and so you can  <br/>
be a college graduate in 2 fields from a top university, and be  <br/>
unemployed after graduation, 1 year as of last week!...<br/>

It&#39;s called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to  <br/>
believe it.<br/>

This is a humor piece made by Minnesota Public Radio; it&#39;s not  <br/>
propaganda made by homeschoolers. I love it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And someone wrote:<br/>
I get their point, but they do it in such a narrowminded,  <br/>
oversimplistic way that its unpalatable. I plan on homeschool my boy  <br/>
but I can&#39;t go to these clinics because I worry I&#39;ll have to deal  <br/>
with people like this. Why can&#39;t we have honest discussion instead of  <br/>
propaganda? Never trust propaganda makers-we should be teaching that  <br/>
right?<br/>

Hmmm... I guess Johnathan Swift was &quot;narrow-minded, overspimplistic&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;unpalatable.&quot;<br/>
Chill out. It&#39;s called satire.<br/>

So if you follow the link Alex brought us<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BKXi6OhhhY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BKXi6OhhhY</a><br/>
you come to other parodies and commentaries.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a good Simpsons parody of &quot;I&#39;m Just a Bill&quot; and I used to  <br/>
have it on my Simpsons page, but it was removed from YouTube, I  <br/>
think.  I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s gone from my page, but it is. <br/>
