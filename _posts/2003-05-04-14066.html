<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226914110">Holly worked hard today, out from 9:00 a.m. to 4:30, some of that driving <br/>
time, but mostly working in the sun at a cleanup of a county park in <br/>
preparation for a big SCA campout.  It was mostly men, some teens, a few <br/>
women, and Holly.<br/>
<br/>
As she was going to sleep she said &quot;I want a big breakfast tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you want pancakes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe.  No, not something sweet.  My tongue is tired of that.  Maybe <br/>
something salty or spicy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
She was really mostly asleep by then so I left.  I figure she might want <br/>
scrambled eggs with cheese.  She&#39;s hardly eating any meat, so breakfast <br/>
meat&#39;s not a good option.  She likes malt-o-meal, but she would probably <br/>
consider that sweet.  <br/>
<br/>
Interesting, though, I thought. <br/>
I could cook some apples with more cinnamon than sugar and put that on the <br/>
side of scrambled eggs.  <br/>

Well if the meat simply grosses her out, maybe she&#39;d like some of the <br/>
substitutes?<br/>
There are delicious vegetarian &quot;sausage&quot; and &quot;bacon&quot; now. And it&#39;s nicely <br/>
salty.<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

I should get some and try that with her.  I&#39;ve always been kind of <br/>
philosophically opposed to fake meat (and I was vegetarian for two years and <br/>
people kept trying to give it to me and I objected), but Keith who IS a <br/>
meateater has a veggie burger he likes to fix for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  She&#39;s still not awake and we&#39;re close to a Wild Oats.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The non-meaty, but salty breakfast that I eat most days is some kind of<br/>
heavy, grainy bread toasted and then topped with melted sharp cheddar. <br/>
This goes along with leftover pizza being my alltime favorite breakfast.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531666579">It&#39;s probably too late for breakfast, but we like fried potatoes, onions and<br/>
peppers, mixed with scrambled eggs and cheese, and put into a tortilla with<br/>
salsa and sour cream....<br/>
