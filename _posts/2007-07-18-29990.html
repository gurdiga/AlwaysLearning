<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905897750">I got the following today in my mailbox. They were trying to sell cheap <br/>
drugs (the ad appeared below this paragraph), so I&#39;m not sure why they <br/>
felt the need to write nonsense. It *looks* like a pargraph. It has <br/>
capitalization and punctuation---well, periods and commas and such. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
Words are spelled correctly, for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating piece of &quot;writing&quot; though---why did they pick what they <br/>
did? If it were meant to get my attention, it worked. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was thinking about reading vs comprehension. I&#39;m a pretty <br/>
good reader! But although I could read almost every word, I couldn&#39;t <br/>
comprehend much of anything! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Anyway, I was thinking about reading vs comprehension. I&#39;m a pretty<br/>
good reader! But although I could read almost every word, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
comprehend much of anything! &lt;G&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think the comprehension IS the reading.<br/>
<br/>
When you read someone&#39;s face, it means you can interpret their mood  <br/>
or meaning or see whether they&#39;re sick, maybe, on in pain by the way  <br/>
their face looks.  It&#39;s not &quot;reading a face&quot; if you just take it in  <br/>
your gaze and see that it&#39;s a face.<br/>
<br/>
If reading is just sounding out a word or seeing if you know what a  <br/>
word means, I can read several languages.<br/>
If reading means (as I think it does) seeing the words and knowing  <br/>
the meaning of the writing, taking the message from the writing, then  <br/>
I can only read English fluently.  Occasionally a passage of French  <br/>
or Spanish turns to  meaning and pictures in my head, but usually  <br/>
they&#39;re letters I could sound out that only turn to mechanically- <br/>
sounded-out words.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592644308">Well, I couldn&#39;t read it at all without it hurting my brain.  I read <br/>
a couple of lines at the top and one at the bottom.  If it were in a <br/>
book for some reason, and I&#39;ve known a few books that do stuff like <br/>
that, I would force myself to read it knowing that it may hold a clue <br/>
to some other part of the book, otherwise the author wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
put it in there.  It still would&#39;ve been a painful moment for me <br/>
though!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a slow reader, really slow.  Sometimes my eyes scan ahead, but my <br/>
brain doesn&#39;t trust that it&#39;s just read and comprehended that info, <br/>
so I have to go back and read it word for word.  I think it&#39;s a habit <br/>
that came from reading excercises in school.  Lately I&#39;ve been trying <br/>
to stop doing that so that I can get through the Harry Potter books.  <br/>
I need to trust that my eyes are seeing what I think they are seeing, <br/>
and not second guess myself and backtrack to rrreeeeaaaadddd it again.<br/>
<br/>
I need to do this because Chamille has challenged me to a reading <br/>
contest with the new Harry Potter book.  She doesn&#39;t second guess <br/>
herself when she reads and she reads fast fast fast!  If she does <br/>
this, it will be her first novel that she will have read on her own.  <br/>
So, in a few days I will be buying 2 Harry Potter books.  Day camp is <br/>
next week and we are going to wait until the weekend after to start <br/>
the books.</div>
