<div id="ygrps-yiv-412485210">This in from another site: Grace Llewellyn (author of Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook) has a new book out, called Guerilla Learning, I believe available<br/>
at Amazon.com (going there next to check it out). It is reportedly geared<br/>
for parents who have their kids in the school system, but I thought some<br/>
here might be interested anyway.<br/>
