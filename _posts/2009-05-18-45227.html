<div id="ygrps-yiv-211861453">For those of you who went to a school with bells, how many do you  <br/>
think you heard?  Try to guess without doing the math.<br/>
<br/>
I told the story of the first time Kirby and Marty heard a school  <br/>
bell.  It&#39;s here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com/2009/05/always-learning-sandra-dodds-interview.html">http://homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com/2009/05/always-learning-sandra-dodds-interview.html</a><br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;an interview,&quot; but that&#39;s a different topic.<br/>
<br/>
So I told that story, and thought about how many I might have heard by  <br/>
those ages.   Huh.  Half of what I had heard altogether by the time I  <br/>
stopped teaching.    (Not that those are the only bells I&#39;ve heard,  <br/>
because I&#39;ve done programs at schools about history of English and  <br/>
medieval demonstrations and such, and I&#39;ve gone to see friends in  <br/>
plays at schools, and I didn&#39;t count my pre-student-teaching semester  <br/>
or my student teaching, nor the two summers I went to summer school.    <br/>
So my figure turns out to be low, and I rounded it down anyway because  <br/>
I questioned my math.<br/>
<br/>
When I rechecked it, I thought it was interesting enough to bring here.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
How many bells do you think you&#39;ve heard?<br/>

math, 12 times a 100 several times a day.  That was the first thing that<br/>
popped into my head, sorry, I couldn&#39;t help it.  I tried not to do the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240727842">*<br/>
<br/>
*Minimum number:<br/>
8, 820 in elementary school<br/>
19,440 in junior and senior high school<br/>
<br/>
Total of 28,260.<br/>
<br/>
No &quot;bells&quot; though - we only ever had &quot;buzzers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that does not count the very very frequent special &quot;buzzers&quot; that <br/>
were to call the janitor to the office, or to announce a fire drill, <br/>
earthquake drill, or (in elementary school, nuclear attack drills).<br/>
<br/>
And, sorry, but I don&#39;t know how to estimate or guess without doing a <br/>
little math in my head - so I thought about how in elementary school we <br/>
had a 5-minute warning buzzer, a school start buzzer, morning recess <br/>
start and stop buzzers, lunch start and stop buzzers, and school&#39;s out <br/>
buzzer. That&#39;s 7 per day times 180 days times 7 years. In jr and senior <br/>
high school, we had 8 periods a day with a buzzer to start each and <br/>
another buzzer to end each, plus a 5 minute warning before school and a <br/>
5 minute warning before lunch period was over - so 18 per day for 180 <br/>
days per school year times 6 years.<br/>
<br/>
People used to say community college was &quot;high school with ash trays.&quot; I <br/>
used to add, &quot;And no buzzers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mom taught a lab preschool program at a high school and I hung out <br/>
there a lot when my children were little. The buzzers and announcements <br/>
going all the time were extremely distracting and annoying to me - I was <br/>
very very bothered by them. They didn&#39;t just have buzzers, but they had <br/>
speakers in every room and the &quot;office&quot; would be constant interrupting <br/>
and making announcements throughout the day. Not just once or twice, I&#39;d <br/>
say more like 10 times per day - more than once per class period. Drove <br/>
me nuts.<br/>

<br/>
You know those kids in school who didn&#39;t listen?  Me.  Those bells <br/>
could wake the dead and probably have.  I tuned them out.  I got my <br/>
stuff together to change classes when I saw others packing up and <br/>
shuffling around en masse (something like 10 minutes before the bell <br/>
rang and the teachers complained but oh well).  I only got up to leave <br/>
after I noticed other students making like a bee line to the door; it <br/>
was a crush anyway, may as well wait and be last out.  Bells for <br/>
changing rooms in middle & high school... gives you something else to <br/>
do.  Now imagine doing that in elementary school.  I can just see kids <br/>
in the hall looking like fish out of water, caught out as the crowds <br/>
thin and forgetting where they&#39;re next room is or still sifting through <br/>
their lockers like they don&#39;t care.  :)  Bells for sitting down: the <br/>
official start of class.  Bells for taking roll in homeroom.  I liked <br/>
the homeroom teachers who tactfully refrained from calling names out <br/>
loud and just checked you here.  Bells for the end of the school day; <br/>
two of them... first bus riders, then everybody else.  That&#39;s about 20 <br/>
bells for one full school day.<br/>

the movie &quot;Idiocracy&quot;, that everyone became very very stupid.  That is<br/>
her anxiety nightmarish dream!  I think I mentioned that once in a chat.<br/>
I told her that she needed to counteract that by having babies.  She<br/>
didn&#39;t like that answer at all!  I was mostly teasing because I know how<br/>
much she doesn&#39;t want to have any kids, at least that&#39;s how she feels<br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
So, no schoolish anxiety dreams here with my kids!</div>

(an experimental ungraded, no textbooks, no assignments, no homework, no <br/>
lessons, no tests, no grades multi-age program for 5 and 6 year olds). <br/>
But now she&#39;s 21 and in college and just today she told me that she <br/>
checks the final exam schedule over and over. In fact, she said that <br/>
sometimes she checks it and then blinks and then checks it again. And, <br/>
at night, she has dreams about missing her final exam because she&#39;s <br/>
gotten the time wrong. Ironically, her French teacher got the time wrong <br/>
for their final, today. Showed up 30 minutes late and only after <br/>
students had gone to the office and the office had called him.<br/>

I have those same dreams maybe once every year or two!  I&#39;m usually in high school, though, and I can&#39;t find my classes, I can&#39;t remember my schedule, I can&#39;t remember where my locker is (or the combination). I usually have missed a huge portion of classes and I&#39;m in danger of failing...UGH!  <br/>

Wow, that is really surprising. I guessed &quot;thousands&quot;, started  doing the <br/>
math and found &quot;tens of thousands&quot; just for high school-and we didn&#39;t  have <br/>
as many classes as lots of other schools-just 8 a day, (unless you count  the <br/>
&quot;elective class&quot; for things like marching band, then it was 9-which I  <br/>
didn&#39;t)! We had 2 rings before school, a &quot;tardy warning&quot; before class, a &quot;you&#39;d  <br/>
better be in class, now&quot; bell, a bell at the end of a class. High school <br/>
alone  rang up about 21,000. Even though I had more actual years in grade <br/>
school, there  were less switching of classes and thus less bells, but still, it <br/>
could easily  be around the 50,000 mark... astounding.<br/>
 <br/>
I forgot about the lunch bells until I read Pam&#39;s mention of  them.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking, as I read the replies, how liberating no  bells would <br/>
be in retrospect. But that&#39;s having had them and being freed from  them. <br/>
There has to be no blip on the radar at all for that for my kids, I&#39;m  thinking. <br/>
I feel like I&#39;ve gotten a wee, tiny peephole into the concept of how  <br/>
different my children&#39;s perception of not just *education* is, but also growing  <br/>
up, childhood, and family. Wow.<br/>

hugging in the halls because it slowed down the transition time<br/>

When I was in elementary school even if I didn&#39;t count the many Jr.  <br/>
High bells which we were to ignore (those were mounted on other  <br/>

I remember being a teacher and seeing the bell schedule, but at that  <br/>
time it was only Jr. High (same building), and there wasn&#39;t the  <br/>
confusion of which bells to ignore, though by then I was ignoring a  <br/>
lot of them, and they never startled me.<br/>

&gt; I have those same dreams maybe once every year or two!  I&#39;m usually  <br/>
&gt; in high school, though, and I can&#39;t find my classes, I can&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; remember my schedule, I can&#39;t remember where my locker is (or the  <br/>
&gt; combination). I usually have missed a huge portion of classes and  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in danger of failing...UGH!<br/>

college.  He went to the wrong psychology class for more than a week;  <br/>
he discovered the error after we&#39;d sold the bargain-priced book we&#39;d  <br/>
found on Craig&#39;s List, as he thought it was the wrong book, not the  <br/>
wrong *class*!  Doh!  Luckily, the instructor was absent one of the 3  <br/>
days he&#39;d missed, so he&#39;d only technically missed two.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, for those who wonder how unschoolers do in college...  Well,  <br/>
other than that snafu, he&#39;s done very well.  He enjoys his classes, is  <br/>
learning all sorts of things people assume kids need to drill to learn  <br/>
(like writing papers), and, for what it&#39;s worth, is getting good  <br/>
grades.  He&#39;s considering majoring in Japanese, he likes it so much.<br/>

Really?  Let me give it a shot:<br/>
<br/>
When your body chemistry comes to a panicky point for some reason, and  <br/>
you&#39;re asleep, you think of crazy &quot;do or die&quot; moments, and it might  <br/>
involve stopping a speeding car when you&#39;re not actually in the  <br/>
driver&#39;s seat, or finding people you&#39;re separated from in an  <br/>
emergency, or being by yourself and not knowing exactly what time and  <br/>
where, and because of this you&#39;re going to FAIL.<br/>
<br/>
But the dream might be about your pajamas being wrapped around your  <br/>
arm, or that you forgot to go to the grocery store and if you don&#39;t  <br/>
remember early the next day the dinner plan isn&#39;t going to work.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever stirs the biochemistry of sudden &quot;oh no!&quot; will add pictures  <br/>
for sleeping people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you have metaphysical interests, I&#39;ve used this book for several years<br/>
and have learned a lot from using it:<br/>

<br/>
There are 2 basic premises to the book:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Every person in the dream represents an aspect of Me.  The entire dream<br/>
is Me having fun, creating, and learning.  The dream is all about Me.  Every<br/>
person in the dream is Me.<br/>
<br/>
2.  All elements in the dream are universal symbols (not dependent on<br/>
language or culture), and these symbols can be understood and used to<br/>
understand our waking life better.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the symbol dictionary, the book has a good chapter about using them<br/>
to interpret the overall dream.  -=b.</div>

when I was outside a moment ago.  We live half a block from an<br/>
elementary school, so I still hear bells and whistles, and have been for<br/>
the last 5 yrs that I&#39;ve lived here!</div>
