Oh, and  I believe that when doing animal conditioning for a reward the whole <br/>
thing  only works if the animals are underfed.  As we know, bribing kids with <br/>
 candy and Nintendo time only works when those items are kept in pretty short <br/>
 supply.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I bet that was the original meaning of &quot;spoiled&quot; as regards children.   <br/>
Nowadays it means that the kid wants too much.  But in terms of &quot;training,&quot;  if a <br/>
kid has too much stuff you can&#39;t bribe and threaten, so you&#39;ve spoiled the  <br/>
ability to control his behavior with the promise of food, privilege or material  <br/>
goods.<br/>
 <br/>
When training rats to bar press for food (to touch a pellet-release bar a  <br/>
certain number of times to get the food to come out---a common psych-lab  <br/>
experiment in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, not now), it&#39;s important that that&#39;s their only  <br/>
source of food.   (They were fed on days there were no labs, but not  for some <br/>
number of hours before labs.)<br/>
 <br/>
Honestly, a lot of the &quot;truths&quot; of conditioning and training and learning  <br/>
come from lab-rat &quot;proofs.&quot;  I hadn&#39;t thought of that for years and  years.  We <br/>
&quot;proved&quot; things with really hungry rats and people applied the  principles to <br/>
human children who didn&#39;t live in cages.<br/>
 <br/>
All that operant conditioning is out of style now in psych studies.  I  think <br/>
the effects remain in schools.<br/>

Sandra<br/>
<br/>
Not strictly true.<br/>
<br/>
Positive reinforcement is far more effective as a learning/conditioning tool<br/>
than negative reinforcement.<br/>
Negative reinforcement would be for instance withholding to the point where<br/>
it becomes the dominant focus thought or focus.<br/>
With positive reinforcement the focus is on the behaviour you need to change<br/>
to get there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m using food as an analogy here. If you starved someone almost their whole<br/>
attention/focus will be on getting food. You can get them to do things for<br/>
food but don&#39;t expect much intelligence or creativity. Which is why you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t go food shopping when you&#39;re hungry.<br/>
<br/>
If you gave them an adequate diet and gave food &#39;treats&#39; as a reward. Then<br/>
intelligence/creativity will shoot up.<br/>
Laboratory rats when used for intelligence/mental testing are kept hungry<br/>
and interested in food but they&#39;re fed an adequate diet.<br/>
Because you are reinforcing a behaviour/reward response you don&#39;t want to<br/>
reinforce or focus on bad habits.<br/>
Eating a ton of sweets as a reward for dieting is reinforcing eating sweets<br/>
rather than dieting.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this really only applies to behaviours that you want to limit or<br/>
encourage, if something is completely unacceptable, then we&#39;re into a<br/>
different area. I think they use electric shocks with rats and mice, I don&#39;t<br/>
think that&#39;s acceptable with children !<br/>
<br/>
The most effective kind of conditioning is &#39;random reward&#39; where the reward<br/>
is not guaranteed, but is based on random chance with the reward becoming<br/>
less and less likely over time or the behaviour needed to get it becoming<br/>
more difficult (but still with a random element) , and the desired behaviour<br/>
increasing proportionately.<br/>
<br/>
In fact you could regard the whole of adult life as a &#39;random reward&#39; system<br/>
(I think I feel a book coming on).<br/>

(however figurative or literal) of any sort, so that they press bars when they <br/>

for rewards isn&#39;t a good overlay for a life of joy and learning.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t suggesting any kind of &#39;conditioning&#39; was the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
I was just saying in the context of conditioning &#39;random reward&#39; appears to<br/>
be the best.<br/>

Punishment---I do something mean to you because you do something I don&#39;t <br/>

One is internal and one is external.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby used to drive a woman home from class every day, when he was taking his <br/>
first-ever math class earlier this year.  (He&#39;s 18.)  He didn&#39;t do it for <br/>
flirtatious reasons; she was 30 years older.  He didn&#39;t do it for a reward.  He <br/>
did it just because it seemed a good thing to do.  <br/>
<br/>
If reading is for gathering information or for relaxation or fun, then people <br/>
will read just as much as they want to, and no more.  If reading is for the <br/>
purpose of getting faster at reading, or for earning pencils or little plastic <br/>
toys or pizza, that is &quot;reward,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t make the reading more <br/>
rewarding at an intrinsic level.  <br/>

I understand &#39;uplifting model&#39; to be in the same category as &#39;role model&#39;,<br/>
an &#39;uplifting model&#39; would be a good &#39;role model&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to get bogged down in words here but a reward is simply a<br/>
return for doing something.<br/>
<br/>
That return can be something material or just a feeling.<br/>

If it makes you feel good that&#39;s a reward.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; What&#39;s the difference between an &#39;uplifting model&#39; and a reward ? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One is internal and one is external.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kirby used to drive a woman home from class every day, when he was taking<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; first-ever math class earlier this year.  (He&#39;s 18.)  He didn&#39;t do it for<br/>
&gt; flirtatious reasons; she was 30 years older.  He didn&#39;t do it for a<br/>
reward.  He<br/>
&gt; did it just because it seemed a good thing to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If reading is for gathering information or for relaxation or fun, then<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; will read just as much as they want to, and no more.  If reading is for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; purpose of getting faster at reading, or for earning pencils or little<br/>
plastic<br/>
&gt; toys or pizza, that is &quot;reward,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t make the reading more<br/>
&gt; rewarding at an intrinsic level.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300553430">People learn to buckle their seat belt to avoid the annoying sound of <br/>
the buzzer in their car. A horse learns to turn or stop to avoid the <br/>
pressure from a tug on the reins. These are negative reinforcers.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment happens AFTER the behavior and the subject can&#39;t avoid it by <br/>
changing the behavior at the time.<br/>
<br/>
There are negative reinforcers that just happen in life - it is raining <br/>
hard and we scuttle under a shelter to avoid it, etc. And there are <br/>
hard-to-avoid punishments - traffic tickets, for example &lt;G&gt; - that <br/>
just WILL happen.<br/>
There are positive reinforcers that just happen in life.<br/>
<br/>
But those reinforcers that happen in the course of life are not the <br/>
same as intentional manipulation by another person. Humans don&#39;t like <br/>
the feeling of being &quot;trained.&quot; We resist. So - a kid may like the <br/>
treat or reward just like they might act to avoid negative reinforcers <br/>
or future punishments, but underneath that there is also resentment or <br/>
apathy brewing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s  Negative Punishment, not Negative Reinforcement -- I stop doing <br/>
&quot;something mean&quot; when you do &quot;something I like.&quot;  Sorry, I had to use <br/>
quotes, as I am an animal trainer and use all four reinforcers at <br/>
various times.  In the case of negative punishment, when a rider puts <br/>
pressure on, say, the horse&#39;s side with her leg, that&#39;s &quot;Positive <br/>
punishment&quot;; when the horse moves away from the pressure in the <br/>
direction the rider wants to go, the rider releases the pressure, i.e., <br/>
negates it (Negative Punishment).  A horse and rider can also be <br/>
trained to use a release in the direction of travel instead of pressure <br/>
from the opposite side, but it&#39;s the combination which is most <br/>
effective.<br/>
<br/>
Negative means &quot;off,&quot; and Positive means &quot;on.&quot;  Not &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Negative Reinforcement means &quot;no reward.&quot;  The animal is free to try <br/>
again; the interplay of positive and negative reward is the basis of <br/>
shaping behaviors.  Example:  I have a horse who is terrified of <br/>
plastic grocery bags.  I&#39;ve been using operant conditioning (aka <br/>
clicker training) to get her to, of her own volition, touch a bag on <br/>
the ground with her nose.  (She already knows the &quot;Touch&quot; game with <br/>
less scary objects.)  She is free to not touch, to leave the area, to <br/>
end the game.  She may choose No Reward.  If she looks at the bag, <br/>
she&#39;s rewarded.  If she takes a step in its direction, she&#39;s rewarded.  <br/>
Gradually, she moves closer.  Once she is close enough to touch it, <br/>
each attempt is rewarded, until she actually bumps it.  Then, she&#39;s <br/>
given a &quot;jackpot&quot; (remind you of anything?), a huge handful of treats, <br/>
a pat, and verbal praise.<br/>
<br/>
The game doesn&#39;t stop with the first touch, though ;-)  Now, I want to <br/>
increase the criteria, as my goal is for her to accept the presence of <br/>
plastic bags in all settings; one of those blowing across a trail can <br/>
make for a wild ride!  So, she touches the bag, which is wrapped around <br/>
a rock; then, I pull a bit of bag loose, so it&#39;s moving in the wind.  <br/>
Horse touches that.  Eventually, she&#39;s pushing it a bit with her nose.  <br/>
I up the ante; she has to push it, not merely touch, to get rewarded.  <br/>
Negative reinforcement -- no reward -- encourages her to try again, try <br/>
something different.  In a few weeks, I hope to have her picking up <br/>
empty plastic bags with her teeth &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a new twist in the clicker training world called &quot;Tag <br/>
Teaching,&quot; in which the human subject is in on the goal.  Instead of <br/>
using a clicker to shape an animal&#39;s behavior, the click is used to <br/>
tell the human they&#39;ve done the behavior correctly.  For example, a <br/>
dance teacher can use the sound to let the student know a position is <br/>
exactly correct, or a diving coach can mark the correct position for a <br/>
quickly moving student.  I&#39;ve used the technique myself with a <br/>
horseback riding student.  The reward, for a human student who wants to <br/>
learn, is the click itself.  For an animal, a click must be followed by <br/>
a reinforcer/reward of some kind, or they&#39;ll lose interest in the game; <br/>
you have to play by the rules.  (In Negative Reinforcement, the click <br/>
is withheld; one never clicks without following with a treat.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem with applying operant conditioning techniques to humans is <br/>
they are too smart: they see through the game, weigh the value of the <br/>
reward against the effort required to gain it, and opt out if the <br/>
reward doesn&#39;t measure up.  If you don&#39;t offer a reward for reading, <br/>
reading itself will be reward enough.  Put a reward in place, and the <br/>
child either strives to get through the reading to get it, or decides <br/>
it&#39;s not worth the effort.  In the end, it&#39;s reading that loses -- <br/>
logically, a book must be less valuable than other things (TV?  Video <br/>
games?) if a bribe must be offered to get one to read.  (FYI -- like <br/>
punishment being something bad that follows a behavior to try to <br/>
discourage recurrence, a bribe is something that precedes a behavior to <br/>
try to encourage it to occur.  In operant conditioning, the reward <br/>
follows the behavior, which is initiated by the subject/animal.  From <br/>
the animal&#39;s point of view, it&#39;s training you.)<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely love clicker training animals -- it provides a language <br/>
unique to both participants, and both enjoy the experience.  I don&#39;t <br/>
have to train my horse to eat grass, or roll in soft sand, or kick up <br/>
her heels.  I do have to train her to get in a trailer, or to stand <br/>
still while I get on, or to not spook at plastic bags; I can use a <br/>
completely benign, friendly (positive ;-) method to gain her <br/>
cooperation for my goals.<br/>
<br/>
(sorry to run on like that -- you hit on one of my favorite subjects!  <br/>
Talk about gardening for awhile, and I&#39;ll shut up ;-)<br/>

I have some interesting superstitious guesses about what might be <br/>

<br/>
When I was teaching 9th grade, one of the brightest and most popular girls <br/>
had a bad habit.  And being a Jr. High girl, it was a really unfortunate bad <br/>
habit.  She made a little click with her tongue in the front of her mouth (hard <br/>
palate, so a quiet little click) just before she said *anything.*  She couldn&#39;t <br/>
make any utterance without that click first.  She would even do it when she <br/>
was thinking to herself or muttering under her breath (if she was writing and <br/>
made a mistake, she would click and mutter, but we&#39;d only hear the click).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, in that place and time, that noise was also an insult.  It was <br/>
the equivalent of a big dramatic eye roll.  So people who knew her ignored it <br/>
(they knew it was not a meaningful utterance in her case, but a habit), and <br/>
those who didn&#39;t know her had their feelings hurt or were insulted.<br/>
<br/>
One day someone (who liked her and knew her) made fun of her about it in <br/>
class, and she got sad and upset and I said if she really wanted to stop we could <br/>
help her.  She said yes.  I got the other kids just in that one English class <br/>
to go along with it, and all we did was when she made the noise, others would <br/>
make it too.  No comment, no laughing or joking, just one &quot;click&quot; met with 25 <br/>
clicks.   She stopped within a week.    <br/>
<br/>
We would&#39;ve quit anytime she&#39;d asked us to.<br/>
<br/>
Most of those kids had known her since she was little.  Some of them probably <br/>
still know her now.  <br/>

I&#39;ll give you the OUP dictonary definition of reward as you seem to have a<br/>
bit of a problem with it:<br/>
<br/>
Reward. A return or recompense for service or merit.<br/>
<br/>
I always read before I post and if I make errors I apologise for them.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Rewards come from outside&#39; you didn&#39;t say &#39;I think&#39; but I presume it&#39;s an<br/>
opinion, that you&#39;re not actually redefining the word.<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t presume to know what you mean by &#39;outside&#39;, whatever you want<br/>
it to mean, right ?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So if I feel good about my choice, I have rewarded myself?<br/>
