<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-Well - there is also the whole &quot;writing&quot; side of soaps - what kind of <br/>
&gt; writing does it entail - how is that different from writing a movie <br/>
&gt; or a short story or a novel or ....?  How do the writers keep people <br/>
&gt; &quot;hooked&quot; on the stories? (But be careful that you don&#39;t turn this <br/>
&gt; into a &quot;language arts&quot; lesson - I almost hesitate to even mention <br/>
&gt; this aspect of it.) -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love the questions, but I wouldn&#39;t share them with young kids.<br/>
It could be great for the mom to watch the shows with those ideas in mind, <br/>
though.<br/>
OR... not to watch the shows, but to be aware that her kids might (if not <br/>
discouraged) figure out all those things on their own.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I LOVED English classes.   I took extra ones, then went to <br/>
college and studied English and then taught English.    I LOVE that stuff.   <br/>
But...<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
Things I learned painstakingly, did grudgingly, &quot;studied&quot; and then pressed <br/>
others to try to do are all things my kids do without knowing what it is, <br/>
without considering that it&#39;s &quot;hard&quot; or even has a formal name or particular jargon.<br/>
<br/>
Comparison/contrast:    NO PROBLEM<br/>
Character analysis? no problem<br/>
Plot summary and analysis?   no problem<br/>
Thematic discussions (and tying back to comparison/contrast and the rest...) <br/>
no problem.<br/>
<br/>
They might not know those terms, but if they read them in context they would <br/>
understand them.<br/>
<br/>
What they do know is how to discuss lyrics, composition, dialog, <br/>
characterization, motive, theme, the effects of music and artistic presentation...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;just watching movies&quot; or &quot;just listening to music&quot; to most people, but <br/>
it&#39;s all the best parts of &quot;language arts&quot; in practice.<br/>
