this week.**<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve been hearing my son humming and singing while he plays World <br/>
of Warcraft.  That&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I put on workout clothes, filled up a water bottle, and <br/>
removed the accumulated junk and dust from my treadmill.  I was just <br/>
about to step onto it when my son, who has a sniffle, invited me to <br/>
cuddle on the couch and watch a movie.  So, I waved good-bye (or maybe <br/>
&quot;au revoir&quot;) to the workout and went for the video cuddle experience.  <br/>
Pretty good movie, pretty good conversation.  And my husband got home <br/>
from work early, so a very good day.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On Sunday, my daughter (nearly 7) was invited to spend the day with <br/>
her friend and the friend&#39;s family.  At 11:30, the father came to pick <br/>
up my daughter and away they went! She was gone until 7:15 that <br/>
evening. She has gone to concerts and galleries with this family <br/>
before but only for a few hours each time.  Never has she been gone <br/>
this long.<br/>
<br/>
When she returned, she was happy and talked about what she did and who <br/>
she saw.  But that evening, she asked to sleep with us.  She told <br/>
me, &quot;I&#39;ve missed a whole day of hugs with you, Mommy. I&#39;ve got to <br/>
catch up!&quot; :)</div>
