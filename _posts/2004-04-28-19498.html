&gt;I guess diabetes is that kind of disease. You can<br/>
&gt;inherit it.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think of &quot;disease&quot; more as something that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;communicable or can be <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting supposition.  I&#39;m not sure if I agree, but<br/>
I am trying to compare other genetically influenced<br/>
conditions with alcoholism in my head to see how they<br/>
measure up and what the difference is between them and<br/>
a communicable disease.  <br/>
<br/>
A disease is defined as a &quot;particular malady&quot;, and a<br/>
&quot;condition of a living animal or plant body which<br/>
impairs normal functioning&quot; and &quot;an impairment of the<br/>
normal state of an organism that interrupts or<br/>
modifies its vital functions.&quot;  I cannot find any<br/>
mention of communicability being a factor in what is<br/>
defined as a disease.  There are many genetically<br/>
influenced impairments which are called diseases, and<br/>
certainly qualify as diseases based on the definitions<br/>
I have been able to find.<br/>
<br/>
There has long been a running debate however, about<br/>
whether alcoholism qualifies as a disease, and this<br/>
may be due in part, I think, to the fact that we<br/>
cannot verify that it&#39;s genetically influenced,<br/>
although we have good evidence to suggest that it is. <br/>
There is also the argument that alcohol impairs one&#39;s<br/>
functioning all on it&#39;s own, and the dysfunctionality<br/>
in the behavior of alcoholics is explained away as<br/>
solely cased by the physical effests of the alcohol,<br/>
which is a gross oversimplification.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it qualifies as a disease, but the word<br/>
disorder could just as easily be applied.  Like anyone<br/>
who&#39;s family is predisposed to a genetic disorder,<br/>
those with alcoholism (or addiction for that matter)<br/>
in the family are at risk for developing it<br/>
themselves, in my opinion.  I don&#39;t think that means<br/>
it&#39;s an unavoidable boogeyman.  It&#39;s just something<br/>
that needs to be taken into account so that preventive<br/>
measures can be taken, like not hanging with a social<br/>
group where drinking is &quot;required&quot; or not getting<br/>
yourself into a job or lifestyle where you are<br/>
constantly barraged by drinking or alcohol, not making<br/>
alcohol too convenient for yourself, or being<br/>
conscious of how/when and why you drink and adjusting<br/>
that before a problem develops if there is a negative<br/>
pattern there.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something I definately want to address with my<br/>
kids, given the risk factors in their genetics, even<br/>
though they have never lived with any alcoholics.<br/>
