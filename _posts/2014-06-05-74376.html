<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964444776">I&#39;ve sort of adopted the role of the one who shoves the list description in front of new members faces, trying to get people to read it ;-) But while I was on vacation I just let everyone through.<br/>
<br/>
So anyone who joined in the past 3 weeks -- and anyone who hasn&#39;t read this in a while -- please do read!<br/>
=====<br/>
Unlike most unschooling lists, the Always Learning list digs into the inner workings of parenting practices. List discussion focuses on what helps and hinders learning and relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who posts -- whether a question or a reply -- should want to see their ideas analyzed under an unschooling light.<br/>
<br/>
The list thrives on unschooling questions and discussion! :-) But it&#39;s also perfectly okay to sit back and follow the discussion. (All new members are encouraged to do just that for awhile to get a feel for the list.)<br/>
<br/>
Many find the analysis helps them clear out hidden baggage, think more clearly and become the radical unschooling parents they want to be. Some find it uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
If Always Learning sounds like a list you&#39;d like to try, then Welcome! If not, best wishes in your unschooling and finding a list that fits your unschooling needs.<br/>
=====<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
