<div id="ygrps-yiv-143610316">I saw the documentary at the H.O.U.S.E. conference here in Illinois.  (We&#39;re in Aurora, Deborah - are you nearby?)   It was interesting.  I was enthusiastic about seeing it - wanting to learn as much about unschooling as possible.  I was surprised to find that some of the &quot;grown homeschoolers&quot; did not have all positive things to say about the experience.  It shook my confidence a bit, not enough to give up the unschooling ideal, or even remotely consider school as an alternative option, but I was surprised, nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
In discussing the video with Peter afterwards, it was more clear that the differences in how people felt about their experience may have had to do with the time period in which they were homeschooled.  (The 30 plus age group had to deal with issues such as being &quot;underground&quot;, not being aloud to play outside for fear of being caught, etc.  The younger people - late teens and twenties - seemed very happy and confident about their experience.)  I believe some were &quot;unschooled&quot; and some were not.<br/>
<br/>
He also mentioned that the participants were the first to respond to his request, so they may have felt strongly about what they wanted to say about their experiences, whether it was positive or negative.<br/>
<br/>
What was even more surprising was that during another session which Peter was presenting, he and his fiance ( one of the participants from the video ) commented that they like homeschooling, and unschooling in the early years, but wished they had had more structure / guidance during the highschool years.<br/>
<br/>
Feedback?<br/>
<br/>
Resources?  Are there books, articles with positive &quot;grown unschooler&quot; opinions out there?  I would love to read / learn about it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
