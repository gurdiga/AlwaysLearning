&lt;&lt; Where was the funeral?   <br/>
 It&#39;s moments like these that &quot;online communities&quot; are really inadequate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well....it&#39;s that damn Alaskan weather that makes this so confusing.<br/>
As some of you are aware, I flew home in February to be with her through the <br/>
dying process.<br/>
We planned and held her service then, but you&#39;ve got to remember that the <br/>
ground is frozen solid for some time in Fairbanks.  They put everyone in a <br/>
big vault up at the cemetery until the ground thaws adequately and then hold <br/>
a little burial ceremony.<br/>
It was private, just for the family.<br/>
Everyone set red roses on her casket while my nephew (dear homeschooled 9 <br/>
y.o.) sweetly sang &quot;my heart will go on&quot;.  I would&#39;ve lost it big time.<br/>
My little niece had a white rose and when she went to set it on the casket, <br/>
it rolled off and fell underneath, she totally fell apart I guess.<br/>
I&#39;ve been dealing with losing my sweet, creative Mom fairly well. But seeing <br/>
the picture of that casket and the roses and the view of Fairbanks from Birch <br/>
Hill cemetery just totally hit me like a ton of bricks.<br/>
It&#39;s like that forever I guess.<br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m being depressing, don&#39;t want to be. It&#39;s really <br/>
bittersweet....she&#39;s with me all of the time, literally. Because everything <br/>
we do and say is touched by her influence. She was a big presence in our <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
So thanks for the cyber hug!<br/>

Oh.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Marty Tufts died in Alaska in winter. December.  He was buried in <br/>
the spring, like that.  We named our second child after him.<br/>
