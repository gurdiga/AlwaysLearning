<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872077531">As some background, our 11 y/o goes to his fathers house for 3-6 months at a<br/>
time in another state.  We share custody with a pretty flexible visitation<br/>
schedule that floats around depending on finances and what works for Draven<br/>
(the 11 y/o) and everyone else at the time.  When he&#39;s here we are radical<br/>
unschoolers, up there he has more rules and rigidity in his life but this<br/>
last visit his father didn&#39;t require any school work (and he possibly won&#39;t<br/>
from here on out).<br/>
<br/>
Draven got back from a 4 month visit with his dad a few days ago and it<br/>
dawned on me tonight that while he&#39;s happily continuing to unschool here in<br/>
our home, I&#39;m in serious need of deschooling again.  Today I asked if he<br/>
wanted to do madlibs with me, not because I thought it would be fun, but<br/>
because I wanted to cover grammar, and while he was helping with dinner I<br/>
wanted him to use the analog clock to time the french fries even after he<br/>
pointed out that setting his cell phone alarm would be much easier.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for going on 3 years now and most of the time it just<br/>
is . . . . I don&#39;t have to think about it.  Today while I wasn&#39;t thinking I<br/>
was doing many things I wasn&#39;t supposed to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding myself trying to quantify the time I&#39;ve missed with him while he<br/>
was gone I think.  His feet are this much bigger, he&#39;s this much taller, and<br/>
perhaps I&#39;m trying to find out if he&#39;s learned this or that or forgotten<br/>
this or that.<br/>
<br/>
I see the difference in him though.  I bought the Mad Libs book 5 years ago<br/>
or so and I think we&#39;ve done 2 of the stories in all that time.  Today we<br/>
sat and did quite a few of them together.  Even though I brought it up for<br/>
the wrong reasons, he was able to see it as fun and not something to make<br/>
him read or something to make him write.  Now I just need to get my head<br/>
back into the right space.<br/>

Instead of thinking of it as &quot;wasn&#39;t supposed to be doing&quot; (as though you broke a rule) it might help to think of it as being out of practice making the better choice (&quot;better&quot; meaning the one you prefer and feel good about, for whatever reason).<br/>

When you mentioned madlibs in the beginning of the post, I pictured YOU doing the reading and writing, and him naming the words.    That would be less intrusive/pushy/test-like, and still fun.  And probably faster and funnier!<br/>
