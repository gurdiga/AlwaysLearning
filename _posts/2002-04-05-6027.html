<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864127760">Seeing how many of you have lots of pets like we do, I&#39;m wondering if<br/>
the whole unschooling philosophy is consistent with collecting many<br/>
pets.  Instead of the rules and structure that cause most folks to be<br/>
&quot;practical&quot; about saying no to their kids when they want yet another<br/>
animal (or saying no to spouse), do we just wing it and take it &quot;one pet<br/>
at a time&quot;, deciding whether no would be a more harmful answer than yes<br/>
each time?  I don&#39;t want to sound like I advocate impulse pet<br/>
acquisition, but I think it&#39;s okay to take on pets impulsively if you<br/>
have a firm commitment and policy in your home not to get rid of them<br/>
once to take them on.  I know so many people who are more structured<br/>
than we are who seem to need every i dotted and t crossed before they&#39;ll<br/>
bring in a new pet, which doesn&#39;t allow for those times when your kid<br/>
just really needs that new friend right now!<br/>
 <br/>
This is one of the most touching things I&#39;ve ever heard a parent say<br/>
about pets.  When I used to teach dog training classes, there was a<br/>
family who brought their new shelter dog to class.  This dog was truly<br/>
homely and definitely lacking in what I would consider a good<br/>
temperament.  But she worked for them, and that&#39;s what counts.  The<br/>
problem was, she hadn&#39;t bonded to the child that needed a dog in that<br/>
family, so although this woman had never been a pet person, and had to<br/>
adjust to the idea of even one pet, she decided to get a 2nd dog for<br/>
this child.  This time I helped her pick a breed and a reputable breeder<br/>
and they got an adorable Miniature Poodle puppy.  The puppy bonded to<br/>
the middle child in the family, as hoped, and all was well.  The mom<br/>
said to me, &quot;I watched one daughter go through junior high school, and<br/>
promised that I would never let another of my children go through those<br/>
tough years without a friend to come home to besides mom.&quot;  While the<br/>
argument could be made that if it&#39;s that tough to get through junior<br/>
high, people should just homeschool, we all know most people aren&#39;t<br/>
going to do what we do, so I thought that was a wonderful attitude this<br/>
woman had.<br/>

I think it&#39;s okay to take on pets impulsively if you<br/>

once to take them on.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Part of the above depends on the pet and the household, too. I would not<br/>
hesitate to get rid of a dog who became truly aggressive. I have my own and<br/>
others little kids around, and I don&#39;t care about the dog&#39;s neuroses, he&#39;s<br/>
outta here. We raised frogs last year and kept them for some time, but they<br/>
got expensive to feed and we released them. We had a rat breeding project<br/>
and when we were done playing with colors and size we sold off all but the<br/>
four girl rats we have now, for snake food and pets.<br/>
<br/>
We have rabbits now and will be in 4H. We will have culls (both to be put<br/>
down for health or temperament reasons and to be sold once they are no<br/>
longer useful in our breeding program). We may change around what colors we<br/>
work on, or even what breed, which will mean selling off some to make room<br/>
for others. Of course, rabbits are an &quot;either way&quot; animal -- some people<br/>
keep them purely as pets, ours are more partly-pets, partly-livestock. The<br/>
girls do have veto power for placements, which will be a good lesson to them<br/>
in &quot;if I want to work on this, that rabbit has to go to make cage space&quot;. I<br/>
am sure they (and I, and heaven knows my sappy husband &lt;g&gt;) will have<br/>
special pet rabbits that will die here happily of old age, but they can&#39;t<br/>
all be that way or the program grinds to a halt once we will our cage space.<br/>
<br/>
I know our attitude is horrifying to pure pet folks, but there it is. We&#39;d<br/>
spend $2000 on our JRT if she came down with something dreadful and needed<br/>
the vet. I wouldn&#39;t spend that on a rat or a rabbit or on most cats (current<br/>
cat excepted &lt;g&gt;. His brother, who we put down when he had liver failure<br/>
last year, might have been saved with a $1500 surgery followed up by another<br/>
couple thousand in ongoing treatments -- and it wasn&#39;t just an unwillingness<br/>
to put the poor thing through all that that made me say &quot;no&quot;, it was also<br/>
the money. Frankly, he just wasn&#39;t that great a cat).<br/>
<br/>
In my universe, people are more important than pets. This doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>
don&#39;t owe them kindness and care when they&#39;re kept by us, but it does mean<br/>
that I value them on a sliding scale. This house is maintained for the<br/>
comfort of the humans who live here, pets have to fit in or go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107497783">Pam - <br/>
 <br/>
I actually agree with you on just about all counts.  Aggressive dogs<br/>
should not be kept, but they should be euthanized rather than placed<br/>
elsewhere for someone else to deal with.  The exception to that would be<br/>
if you have the 1) dog experience and 2) knowledge of that particular<br/>
dog to place it 3) with someone who can handle the problem<br/>
appropriately, and only then if 4) the problem is one that truly can be<br/>
managed.  And these 4 parameters don&#39;t come together often.<br/>
 <br/>
And of course when you have lots of pets you have to prioritize how much<br/>
you&#39;ll spend to fix problems.  One of the reasons we&#39;re going down on<br/>
our number of pets - strictly through attrition is that I don&#39;t like<br/>
that feeling of not being able to do everything financially for a pet I<br/>
love.  I pull out all the stops for my Dalmatians and cats, but not<br/>
always for the ferrets and rats.  The other reason is that my kids are<br/>
activity-manic, and we are home less (not homeless!) more than we used<br/>
to be, and my dogs clearly miss us.  <br/>
 <br/>
When you have a breeding program, you have to place some of your<br/>
animals, but if it&#39;s done responsibly, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.<br/>
The problem I have is when people have a few pets, get rid of them<br/>
because the kids are tired of them, then get more, rinse, repeat . . .<br/>
A woman on a homeschool list recently wrote that she was looking for<br/>
homes for her son&#39;s frogs and gecko because he&#39;d lost interest in them<br/>
since they got a new puppy.  I wrote back a polite private message about<br/>
pet responsiblity and how very possible it was that he would also lose<br/>
interest in the puppy because that was the routine that was being set<br/>
up.  I mentioned that none of my 4 kids had ever lost interest in any of<br/>
the 70+ pets we&#39;d had over the years.  She wrote back a very nice reply<br/>
assuring me that they were very responsible about their pets.  My whole<br/>
point of the lesson her son was learning about pets and responsibility<br/>
completely went over her head. <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Intention&quot; is better then &quot;firm commitment,&quot; I think.  Making a firm <br/>
commitment to someone or something you don&#39;t know really well is worse than <br/>
impulse.  You can impulsively decide to try something, but impulsively <br/>
commiting for life isn&#39;t something I want to model for my children (or to <br/>
inflict on myself).<br/>
<br/>
What if each of us were still with the first boyfriend we ever had, living in <br/>
the first house or apartment we ever independently obtained, in the same job <br/>
we ever first had, playing the first stereo we ever bought.  Is it just that <br/>
we count on outliving any irritating pets we might impulsively commit to?  <br/>
Beware parrots and horses (and, at my age, German Shepherds).<br/>
