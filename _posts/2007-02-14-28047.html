<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105520173">A quote from a post to an authenticity list about using a library to  <br/>
do research for one&#39;s SCA persona:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Have fun and beware of the sidetracking entity that lives in your<br/>
brain! Or don&#39;t...-=-<br/>
<br/>
People will apologize for poking around in a dictionary when they go  <br/>
to look up a word.  Someone did it at my house a week ago.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Without having seen what&#39;s above, I wrote this to a 17  year old boy  <br/>
in England who found my site (the food section, mostly) and was  <br/>
writing to chat about whether he should go to the university:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think going to college can offer way more than just the coursework,<br/>
&gt; as you probably know.   You&#39;ll meet friends you&#39;ll probably have for<br/>
&gt; life.  Try to keep the debt reasonable and don&#39;t limit your options.<br/>
&gt; Take classes  you &quot;don&#39;t have to take.&quot;  Do community things--free<br/>
&gt; this or that, plays, non-computer-geek stuff on the side.  Become a<br/>
&gt; sponge to soak it all in, instead of an arrow speeding toward one  <br/>
&gt; goal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be open to changes of plans!<br/>
&gt; Be open to the world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
