<div id="ygrps-yiv-839351180">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I find a similar situation in my family and town.It is a tough <br/>
concept for people to grasp that learning happens out of school.<br/>
The thought that it happens naturally , unprovoked or scripted is a <br/>
jarring thought to most.I am faced with questions that are <br/>
Sophmoric.Such as what about the Prom? Don&#39;t you want them to <br/>
remember the PROM? I am very surprised when senior citizens or others <br/>
who are  may have Not attended The Institution of SCHOOL, ask &quot;But <br/>
how will they learn?&quot; I respond,Humans have been on the earth for <br/>
millions of years,we managed to learn with out organized <br/>
schools,school politics and budgets for an awful long time; did we <br/>
not? Change scares many,many,people.<br/>
