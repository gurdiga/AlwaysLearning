<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586576560">remind me again that Lexie will learn to write.<br/>
<br/>
Today she took three messages.  She couldn&#39;t write down (or didn&#39;t) any <br/>
of the names.  They were all parents from the soccer team.  She wrote <br/>
down the phone numbers.  I couldn&#39;t read them.  I could see that the 0&#39;s <br/>
lookied like C&#39;s, and the 7, 9, 4&#39;s were backwards.  One number she got <br/>
all wrong, I still don&#39;t know who it was that called and I have no way <br/>
of finding out.  <br/>
<br/>
This was not funny, If she&#39;s goingto answer the phone when Dad&#39;s asleep <br/>
she needs to take a proper message.  I told her, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
answer the phone, we have voice mail.  Just let it ring.  But really, at <br/>
8, shouldn&#39;t she be able to write down a phone message?  She writes not <br/>
at all.  <br/>
<br/>
I need reassurance that this is OK.  <br/>
<br/>
I should add, I think this is part of her eye issues, fine motor skills, <br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Help?<br/>

<br/>
My 9 year old boy doesn&#39;t write at all.  And I literally mean not a <br/>
word, although he knows how all the letters are formed.... uh... mostly.<br/>
<br/>
There was some stuff on the HSC list (CA) recently that I found <br/>
comforting, claiming that stilted resentful writers are created by lots <br/>
of early writing drill.  (I guess I have drifted from handwriting to <br/>
composition, but sometimes I lump the worries together.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worrying for me, too, but I&#39;m trying to ride it out.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to remount our whiteboard on the wall, it&#39;s been down since <br/>
we moved.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I think it&#39;s a fine motor issue in my child, too.  My husband&#39;s <br/>
handwriting is torturous.  Obviously lots of handwriting practice and <br/>
being kept after school to write things over is not a winning approach <br/>
for everyone.  Yick.</div>

<br/>
Dylan didn&#39;t write at eight.  <br/>
<br/>
He can take phone messages now (he&#39;s eleven) but he asks the caller how<br/>
to spell stuff and has them repeat the number slowly.   He&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
sorry, I&#39;m a kid, can you slow down and help me?&quot; &lt;G&gt;   Almost everyone<br/>
now just leaves messages like &quot;call Amy&quot; then the number.  <br/>
<br/>
Does she know she can ask the caller to slow down, repeat, help spell,<br/>
etc?   I&#39;d remind her about that.<br/>
You could ask her to tell callers to call back if they don&#39;t hear from<br/>
you by a certain time.   <br/>
<br/>
She probably doesn&#39;t have much reason to write aside from a few phone<br/>
messages which can&#39;t possibly be as important to her as they are to you. <br/>
&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Good reasons for writing:  Sneaking messages to friends during class -<br/>
she won&#39;t need that!<br/>
Sending love notes to some romantic interest - she won&#39;t need that for a<br/>
few more years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Filling out job applications.  -  probably won&#39;t need that until she&#39;s<br/>
older.<br/>
<br/>
She sounds just right to me.<br/>

<br/>
I threw a fit one week a couple of years ago after both Kirby and Marty <br/>
botched phone messages.  I yelled.  I said IF you cannot ask them to spell their <br/>
names and you can&#39;t double-check the phone number after you write it down, DO <br/>
NOT EVEN TOUCH THAT PHONE, don&#39;t call out, don&#39;t answer it, just DON&#39;T.   I <br/>
can&#39;t BELIEVE people think they&#39;ve left a message and that I will call them back <br/>
and I can&#39;t even begin to, yada yada yada until I lost steam.<br/>
<br/>
I told them to practice writing fast, just goofing around, just while they <br/>
were watching commercials or whatever, to just practice writing down phone <br/>
numbers, to practice writing their names fast, just doodle.  I didn&#39;t need to see <br/>
it but they needed to do it because it was an important thing for them to know <br/>
if they ever wanted to use a phone again.<br/>
<br/>
They take MUCH better phone messages now.   Marty tends to type them in a <br/>
file on my computer desktop (not perfect, because sometimes the computer freezes, <br/>
though it hasn&#39;t happened with a message up, I&#39;ve just worried about it).<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t willing to force writing lessons on them, but once they honestly <br/>
botched some things that were potentially important (I don&#39;t even know if they <br/>
were homeschoolers or old friends or salesmen), then came a real need to know.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I need reassurance that this is OK.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;ll get it.<br/>
I hope she gets it without you going banshee-like as I did.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; remind me again that Lexie will learn to write.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rain (ten and a half) has been writing a lot more lately. I was worried a<br/>
few weeks ago after the Resume Writing Issue, but she seemed to recover<br/>
with no lasting effects. For some reason, writing notes to each other has<br/>
been a big thing in the last two shows she&#39;s done. During &quot;Emperor&#39;s&quot;,<br/>
she and a few friends made up treasure hunts for each others, and wrote<br/>
letters to send each otherto the next clues. During this show, she and a<br/>
friend have been writing notes to each other in character, and Rain has<br/>
gone so far as to burn the edges of the paper she writes on and then<br/>
stain it with tea, so it looks like authentic &quot;Lost Boy&quot; paper. I just<br/>
think it&#39;s all really cool, and it&#39;s totally kid-driven, all I&#39;ve done is<br/>
suggest doing the burning over the sink.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing Rain has taken up recently is email. She has a few<br/>
friends she writes to, and she actually checks her email almost every day<br/>
now. She writes fairly long emails, as far as I can tell, and likes<br/>
getting email back. She set up the program to spellcheck emails before<br/>
they go out, so she doesn&#39;t worry much about spelling when she&#39;s writing,<br/>
and her spelling has actually improved. <br/>
<br/>
I was a little taken aback a month ago when we went back to the bay area<br/>
for her friend&#39;s birthday party, and all her old non-writing friends were<br/>
now writing long paragraphs in birthday cards... OTOH, one of the moms<br/>
said she had hired a writing tutor (for her then-nine yr old). I am glad<br/>
I didn&#39;t panic, because it&#39;s really cool to watch her tackling this on<br/>
her own. So, on a reassurance-level, I think Lexie is doing fine...<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to take phone messages, though, I can see how making them<br/>
legible would be an issue. Rain still occasionally reverses a 3, although<br/>
if she stops to think about it she knows which way they go. At 8, though,<br/>
she made a lot more reversals (although only numbers; she&#39;s never<br/>
reversed letters, for some reason, except for Z). When she needed to<br/>
write a number forwards, she would usually check the computer keyboard to<br/>
see which way they went. Maybe you could write the numbers 1 - 9 in big<br/>
writing and post them somewhere near the phone? Or show her some tips,<br/>
like reading back the number after she takes it and then fixing anything<br/>
that&#39;s hard to read. Or maybe you could leave a calculator near the<br/>
phone, and she could punch the number into that when she takes the<br/>
message, and then later copy it on paper? With Rain at 8, taking phone<br/>
messages at 8 was hard because the person talked more quickly than she<br/>
could write, so she would try to write quickly and it would be illegible,<br/>
but doing it in a calculator would be faster. What she generally ended up<br/>
doing was just taking names, because generally I could look on the soccer<br/>
roster or homeschool group phone list or wherever to get the number...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380520273">I am speaking at the Homeschool Association of California conference in<br/>
Sacramento this coming week on The Benefits of Television.  Some of you may<br/>
recall that Sandra and Kathy and I gave a talk last year on video games that<br/>
was (I think) well received. That inspired the TV session for this year.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to cite some shows or movies that have been on TV very recently<br/>
- like in the past week or two.  Could we brainstorm a few of them here?<br/>
I&#39;d like to do some sort of hand out crammed full good programming.<br/>
<br/>
For example, tonight we watched the Simpson&#39;s episode where they do Hamlet,<br/>
Joan of Arc and Homer&#39;s Odyssey. It was ripe with opportunity to Talk about<br/>
Homer (not him, the ancient guy) and sirens and Shakespeare and burning<br/>
people to death. <br/>
<br/>
We also recently watched the Modern Marvels on non-lethal weapons where they<br/>
talked about sensory depravation and how effective that foamy, sticky glue<br/>
is a stopping people but they don&#39;t use it because it is very costly to<br/>
clean up. And it gave opportunity to talk about the disaster at the Russian<br/>
theatre where the knock-out gas that affectively stopped the terrorists from<br/>
blowing up the theatre ended up killing over 100 of the hostages.<br/>
<br/>
Or Ebert and Roper because they talk critically about films we have seen and<br/>
they intelligently explain their points of view. Saying good things about<br/>
bad movies and visa versa. Ultimately ending with either thumbs up or down<br/>
from all that gray of good and bad points. Illustrating how incomplete such<br/>
black and white answers can be. And how differently we all see the world.<br/>
<br/>
So what good TV programs have you seen lately and why were they good (in a<br/>
homeschooling context)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

2 weeks further on he is typing and spelling just fine. He still hasn&#39;t <br/>
picked up a pen cos he hates writing.<br/>
The same with my 8 yo. He flatly refuses to write. Loathes the whole <br/>
idea, yet he&#39;s typing away on Runescape as if he&#39;s<br/>
been spelling for years. 2 weeks ago he couldn&#39;t spell his name.<br/>

as a family. It made for great discussions about who<br/>
deserved to be the last survivor and about<br/>
ruthlessness and deceit. We discussed survivor skills<br/>
in our own family. The show was marginal, but I really<br/>
felt like it was a good learning project for us all.<br/>
In the cartoon world. We love Dora the Explorer. Even<br/>
my big kids will be walking around quoting Dora. And<br/>
we love Rugrats. The slaughter of the language and<br/>
usual lesson on doing the right thing and being<br/>
honest. My daughter who was very, very shy, when she<br/>
was five wanted  to be Angelica. I said she is the<br/>
mean one.. Ashton thought that was great. Her power<br/>
was a quality Ashton desired. Ashton at seven is not<br/>
mean or shy. <br/>
I do not know if most kids do this, but my kids pick a<br/>
character in lots of shows we watch. &quot;I&#39;m him&quot;, They<br/>
shout, each assigning to be a person in the story. <br/>
And then later they play being the character from the<br/>
show. In similar situations. I think that TV gives<br/>
them a spark for imaginative play is great. Hope I<br/>
have not been to long winded. Good luck Dan.<br/>

Honest, your child will &quot;learn&quot; this when she&#39;s ready.<br/>
Perhaps, if you&#39;re really nervous about it - you could make up games.....<br/>
Brianna & I have to spell certain words so that Teah (our dog) doesn&#39;t get excited.<br/>
Some of the words are <br/>
out<br/>
eat<br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
also, Brianna loves to draw - she draws what I call &#39;psycho-delic&#39; - you know that maze like drawing??<br/>
She started hiding her name in the maze - now she&#39;s up to words like<br/>
success<br/>
desire<br/>
humor<br/>
<br/>
she also asks me how to spell many words and so I do.<br/>
<br/>
Your kid is going to learn what she needs to learn.<br/>
As for the messages, I had to explain to Brianna that this is our business phone and it was better to let the voice mail pick it up rather than her get flustered - &#39;cos it ain&#39;t worth her getting flustered! :)<br/>
<br/>
When she was ready - she started to take messages.<br/>
As part of her choice - to answer the phone rather than let voice mail pick it up - it was her responsibility to make sure I or she could read the message.<br/>
I also have caller id - and that helps allot.<br/>
When Brianna wanted to practice,  I would call her from the cell phone or from my next door neighbors home and give her messages. (Brianna thought this one up)<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is this - have faith, have patience. One day your baby will walk up to you w/ a message that is readable and wonderful! and you and she will feel this rush of emotion. Celebrate!<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted.<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Today she took three messages.  She couldn&#39;t write down (or didn&#39;t) any <br/>
  &gt;of the names.  They were all parents from the soccer team.  She wrote <br/>
  &gt;down the phone numbers.  I couldn&#39;t read them.  I could see that the 0&#39;s <br/>
  &gt;lookied like C&#39;s, and the 7, 9, 4&#39;s were backwards.  One number she got <br/>
  &gt;all wrong, I still don&#39;t know who it was that called and I have no way <br/>
  &gt;of finding out.  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;This was not funny, If she&#39;s goingto answer the phone when Dad&#39;s asleep <br/>
  &gt;she needs to take a proper message.  I told her, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
  &gt;answer the phone, we have voice mail.  Just let it ring.  But really, at <br/>
  &gt;8, shouldn&#39;t she be able to write down a phone message?  She writes not <br/>
  &gt;at all.  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I need reassurance that this is OK.  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I should add, I think this is part of her eye issues, fine motor skills, <br/>
  &gt;etc.  <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Help?<br/>

  &gt;Joylyn<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  I don&#39;t know how old your Lexie is but my lad, Bryn (10) hasn&#39;t picked <br/>
  up a pen for 4 years, since he left school.<br/>
  His dad was beginning to fret....trying to hassle me into *making* them <br/>
  do spelling tests. Blaming me for the fact they<br/>
  couldn&#39;t write.<br/>
  Two weeks ago Bryn discovered an online game called Runescape. One of <br/>
  the important parts of the game is typing<br/>
  messages to other players to bargain for items. On the first day I got a <br/>
  lot of &#39;Muuuuuuuuuum, how do you spell ****&#39;<br/>
  2 weeks further on he is typing and spelling just fine. He still hasn&#39;t <br/>
  picked up a pen cos he hates writing.<br/>
  The same with my 8 yo. He flatly refuses to write. Loathes the whole <br/>
  idea, yet he&#39;s typing away on Runescape as if he&#39;s<br/>
  been spelling for years. 2 weeks ago he couldn&#39;t spell his name.<br/>
  (I&#39;m talking one finger typing here in case you&#39;re worried about motor <br/>
  skills)<br/>
  When the interest comes, there ain&#39;t no stopping them ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  Now, all I have to do is reassure DH that they will learn maths IF and <br/>
  When they WANT to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278642958">Last week on the Fairly Oddparents show,on Nickelodeon  we had a great<br/>
discussion about US History.<br/>
<br/>
Timmy, little boy/main character, got to meet with people from American<br/>
Revolutionary times.  He was struggling with his history homework and the<br/>
internet.  So his fairy godparents bring these historical people to meet him<br/>
and help him.    Things touched upon:  Signing of the Declaration of<br/>
Independence,  met up with George Washington, Ben Franklin, Thomas<br/>
Jefferson, John Hancock,  Benedict Arnold (who tried to masquerade as<br/>
George, wood teeth and all)<br/>
<br/>
Our discussion also included,  leadership, politics,   time travel: they go<br/>
into a scenerio of what if Benedict Arnold had been successful and we were<br/>
all British now, (yes, Shyrley, you would like it!)  British colonialism,<br/>
obsessions,(they figured out the real George from putting out a coat rack<br/>
made of wood and he wanted to chop it &lt;g&gt;)  and dentistry through the ages<br/>
&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if this is what you are looking for, but I was amazed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is now 13, taller than me, and has become a writer.  I had to sneak a<br/>
look at this, as he tends to hide his brilliance from his adoring mother :-)<br/>
This is part of a 9-page walkthrough for Zelda the Wind Waker he&#39;s writing<br/>
for the Ganon&#39;s Tower forum, where he is a regular poster:<br/>
***<br/>
Head back to land and go into your house, climb up the ladder once inside,<br/>
you¹ll find your grandma there. You¹ll go into a cut-scene with your grandma<br/>
explaining a bit of history, showing you the family shield, and giving you<br/>
the hero¹s clothes. This is Link¹s signature green tunic. (what¹s with<br/>
grandmas and giving kids clothes for holidays?)<br/>
<br/>
Well, aryll asked you to come see her, so let¹s do that, there¹s not much<br/>
else to do. You could go see orca and sturgeon, they¹re the two brothers who<br/>
live in the double-decker house. Orca will give you sword training, but<br/>
won¹t give you the sword itself. (yet, heehee.)<br/>
Sturgeon will give you little bits of advice so useless, a 3 year old in a<br/>
coma would be bored. But you never know, I didn¹t look at his advice, but<br/>
maybe some of you do.....<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A 3 year old in a coma would be bored&quot;???  Geez, where&#39;d this kid get it?<br/>
<br/>
Alex is my total unschooler, btw; his sister was subjected to a year of<br/>
Calvert School.  He recently got very upset because the Mad Libs he was<br/>
doing asked for a present tense verb, and he didn&#39;t know what that meant.<br/>
He had to ask just as I was going out the door for work, too...  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
explain it well enough for him in his agitated state (he thinks he&#39;s<br/>
stupid), so I suggested he put the word &quot;shit&quot; in on every verb space, then<br/>
see if they read right, or if they needed &quot;ing&quot; or &quot;ed.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if he<br/>
did it, but I left him cracking up instead of crying.  I hope he did do it,<br/>
because he clearly can use verbs even if he can&#39;t identify the case.<br/>
<br/>
His handwriting is legible printing, suitable for comics.  He still aligns<br/>
the crossbar of lower case &quot;t&quot; and &quot;f&quot; with the baseline, a characteristic I<br/>
didn&#39;t correct when he was learning to write.  Now it&#39;s a choice, not a<br/>
mistake.  My 16 y.o. dd, Laura, types away on her preferred forums and IM&#39;s<br/>
(neither had typing lessons, but both sound faster than me &lt;g&gt;).  She still<br/>
prints large letters, but when I asked, showed she could write small, neat<br/>
letters, but prefers large ones.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember them taking phone messages at 8, but then, they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been alone to take them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513001185">We were watching CSI last night, and they were talking about how cicadas<br/>
are born and then burrow underground for 17 years, and then when they<br/>
come out they shed their skin and then can fly, but then they only live<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll admit that I didn&#39;t remember the details, but Rain is next to me and<br/>
she did (although she says she already knew about cicadas). I think we<br/>
learn a lot of stuff from CSI and Law and Order and those crime drama<br/>
shows, but they&#39;re my current faves so maybe I&#39;m biased. They&#39;re also<br/>
good for problem solving and critical thinking skills, and for thinking<br/>
&quot;out of the box&quot;. Oh, and I like the autopsy bits...<br/>
<br/>
We saw King of the Hill last night, and it triggered a nice discussion on<br/>
transubstantiation and Catholicism in general (&quot;So, Catholics are into<br/>
cannibalism why?&quot;  - stuff I never asked about during my Catholic<br/>
childhood). It was the one where Peggy pretends to be a nun to get a<br/>
teaching job. We&#39;ve also learned about propane there.<br/>

Rain watches American Juniors, and she now knows who Gladys Knight and<br/>

&gt; My kids love junkyard wars. My boys will often head<br/>
&gt; out and try to create things and have their own<br/>
&gt; junkyard wars. I love the creativity it inspires. My<br/>
&gt; fourteen year old daughter is a music buff.  My<br/>
&gt; daughter watches, or records TRL every day. She<br/>
&gt; watches the video clips, downloads lyrics off the<br/>
&gt; Internet and burns cd&#39;s from Kazza. She has the top of<br/>
&gt; all popular music collections. We have never been fans<br/>
&gt; of reality TV.. But last season we did watch Survivor<br/>
&gt; as a family. It made for great discussions about who<br/>
&gt; deserved to be the last survivor and about<br/>
&gt; ruthlessness and deceit. We discussed survivor skills<br/>
&gt; in our own family. The show was marginal, but I really<br/>
&gt; felt like it was a good learning project for us all.<br/>
&gt; In the cartoon world. We love Dora the Explorer. Even<br/>
&gt; my big kids will be walking around quoting Dora. And<br/>
&gt; we love Rugrats. The slaughter of the language and<br/>
&gt; usual lesson on doing the right thing and being<br/>
&gt; honest. My daughter who was very, very shy, when she<br/>
&gt; was five wanted  to be Angelica. I said she is the<br/>
&gt; mean one.. Ashton thought that was great. Her power<br/>
&gt; was a quality Ashton desired. Ashton at seven is not<br/>
&gt; mean or shy.<br/>
&gt; I do not know if most kids do this, but my kids pick a<br/>
&gt; character in lots of shows we watch. &quot;I&#39;m him&quot;, They<br/>
&gt; shout, each assigning to be a person in the story.<br/>
&gt; And then later they play being the character from the<br/>
&gt; show. In similar situations. I think that TV gives<br/>
&gt; them a spark for imaginative play is great. Hope I<br/>
&gt; have not been to long winded. Good luck Dan.<br/>

&gt; &gt; good programming.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Joan of Arc and Homer&#39;s Odyssey. It was ripe with<br/>

&gt; &gt; Homer (not him, the ancient guy) and sirens and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shakespeare and burning<br/>
&gt; &gt; people to death.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We also recently watched the Modern Marvels on<br/>
&gt; &gt; non-lethal weapons where they<br/>
&gt; &gt; talked about sensory depravation and how effective<br/>
&gt; &gt; that foamy, sticky glue<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a stopping people but they don&#39;t use it because<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is very costly to<br/>
&gt; &gt; clean up. And it gave opportunity to talk about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; disaster at the Russian<br/>
&gt; &gt; theatre where the knock-out gas that affectively<br/>
&gt; &gt; stopped the terrorists from<br/>
&gt; &gt; blowing up the theatre ended up killing over 100 of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hostages.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Or Ebert and Roper because they talk critically<br/>

&gt; &gt; Saying good things about<br/>

&lt;&lt; For example, tonight we watched the Simpson&#39;s episode where they do Hamlet,<br/>
Joan of Arc and Homer&#39;s Odyssey. It was ripe with opportunity to Talk about<br/>
Homer (not him, the ancient guy) and sirens and Shakespeare and burning<br/>
people to death.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last time that was on here, Marty and I sat in Holly&#39;s room and watched it <br/>
with her.  It&#39;s truly brilliant.   And there&#39;s another Hamlet reference in the <br/>
musical Peter Pan.  It wasn&#39;t in the 50s video, but it&#39;s in the newer one.  The <br/>
lost boys are asking Wendy how various stories turn out.  I can&#39;t find a <br/>
transcript of that part with google, but after saying &quot;they lived happily ever <br/>
after&quot; about various other stories the boys ask about, they ask about Hamlet.  <br/>
With the same happy voice, she says something like, &quot;Well Ophelia dies, and <br/>
Polonius dies.  Hamlet dies, and Laertes dies.  The queen dies and the king dies.  <br/>
And they live happily ever after!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On top of those two pieces of humor my kids have seen the Zefirelli (sp?) <br/>
Hamlet, at least in parts, several times.   The humor of the Simpsons or Peter <br/>
Pan is as helpful for them realizing how famous the story is, who the main <br/>
characters are, and what the tone of the swordfight scene is, than if they took a <br/>
Shakespeare class and read the whole play, only it&#39;s fun and it&#39;s quick.<br/>
<br/>
Our TV hasnt&#39; been on much yet not counting playing videos (mostly musicals, <br/>
while I was doing housework or preparing for the homeschooling conference in <br/>
South Carolina), but today Marty and Holly were watching Jerry Springer, and <br/>
Marty was making intelligent comments about the practice of psychiatry and the <br/>
history of freak shows in relation to that program, and Holly told us a story <br/>
from the new movie &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; about the mom being a psychiatrist and <br/>
telling her daughter (who is in her body for the day) that whatever the person <br/>
says, she can say &quot;And how does that make you feel?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked if it turned into a joke about the cost of a session, and she said <br/>
no, but a guy said something had been really depressing, the daughter-as-mom <br/>
said &quot;And how does that make you feel?&quot; and he said &quot;DEPRESSED!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was a pretty rich five minutes spent with me passing through the room <br/>
where an 11 and a 14 year old were.<br/>

Mike Judge<br/>
 <br/>
A former engineer, Mike Judge achieved animation renown for his dead-on idiot <br/>
savant satire of American suburban teen culture in the MTV phenomenon Beavis <br/>
and Butthead. Born in Ecuador and raised in Albuquerque, NM, Judge got a <br/>
degree in physics at U.C. San Diego. Relocating to Texas, Judge worked as an <br/>
engineer and also tried to forge a career as a musician, but found that animation <br/>
was his preferred calling. After a Dallas animation festival, Judge&#39;s 1991 short <br/>
Office Space was picked up by Comedy Central. His 1992 short Frog Baseball, <br/>
featuring two sadistic teen cretins voiced by Judge, subsequently led to a 1993 <br/>
MTV animated series revolving around the heavy metal-loving adolescents <br/>
Beavis and Butthead. Anchored by the pair&#39;s witty critiques of muse on the teen boy <br/>
culture of raging hormones, loud music, fast food, and pyromania. Despite <br/>
fierce criticism of its overt idiocy and a 1993 scandal involving its influence <br/>
on a fire-setting viewer, Beavis and Butthead ran for several years, spawning <br/>
lucrative merchandising and Judge&#39;s first big-screen feature, Beavis and <br/>
Butthead Do America (1996). Judge branched out into network TV in 1997 with Fox&#39;s <br/>
popular, Emmy-nominated animated comedy series King of the Hill, featuring <br/>
executive producer Judge as the voice of laconic Texas propane salesman and family <br/>
man Hank Hill. Bringing his sweetly jaundiced view of American suburbia to <br/>
live-action film, Judge expanded his early short into the full-length feature <br/>
Office Space (1999). Humorously chronicling the myriad forms of office cubicle <br/>
and chain restaurant hell, with visually clever detours into the suburban white <br/>
male affection for gangsta rap, Office Space wickedly celebrated one man&#39;s <br/>
revolt against 1990s corporate culture and became a small hit. Despite his <br/>
success with live action, Judge continued working primarily in animation. Along with <br/>
his ongoing work on King of the Hill, Judge also added his voice talents to <br/>
the outrageously tasteless yet smart South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut <br/>
(1999). Judge is married and has two children. ~ Lucia Bozzola, All Movie Guide</div>
