<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289605219">I need some advice and ideas for my four-year-old boy. He loves to put things together in <br/>
interesting ways, and try to invent things. He also loves science experiments, making all <br/>
kinds of goop, etc. Lately he has seemed bored (with the winter, and I&#39;ve been sick, and he <br/>
hurt his thumb, we haven&#39;t been able to get out as much as we need too), the other day when <br/>
I was suggesting things to do he said that they were all &#39;lame&#39; and he wanted something new <br/>
to do. So, I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions of things that he could put <br/>
together, etc., that would be inexpensive.<br/>
<br/>
They need to be open ended, without a right way to do them, or he&#39;ll get frustrated. His mind <br/>
moves very quickly, and his motor skills can&#39;t always keep up. If anyone has any suggestions, <br/>
I&#39;d really appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Instead of &quot;suggesting&quot; things, put some things out.  Be doing  <br/>
something yourself.  Nothing set the value on a toy in our house as  <br/>
much as when the stained hardwood attribute blocks arrived when the  <br/>
kids weren&#39;t home, and when they got home Keith and I had a big  <br/>
mandala going on the table.  They wanted to play but we said wait. It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a calculated or planned move.  It was our natural desire to  <br/>
finish what we were doing.  But the fact that WE were having fun  <br/>
infused those blocks with the glory of being REAL fun, not &quot;fun for  <br/>
kids.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914487623">Sandra,<br/>
Thanks for the link. I was actually looking for that on your site, and<br/>
couldn&#39;t find it! You&#39;re right that I just need to start doing things<br/>
myself. Maybe the trick is to look for things that I would find<br/>
interesting to build with? I&#39;d also love to figure out how to create<br/>
things to build with myself, out of found objects, etc. I&#39;ve always been<br/>
more of an in-my-head person, I need a kick in the right direction to<br/>
get more active!<br/>

<br/>
No, but do you think we should have?  (Thinking of what I can infuse  <br/>
with splendor here...)<br/>
<br/>
Kirby (a.k.a. &quot;the experimental model&quot;) was made to pay for his own  <br/>
gasoline when he was first driving.  Holly didn&#39;t even have to learn  <br/>
to pump it, although recently she did, and she has even put gasoline  <br/>
in by herself, with her own debit card, at the ripe old age of 17.    <br/>
But the car needs gas, she&#39;s at work until 10:00 or 11:00, and needs  <br/>
to work at noon tomorrow, so her dad will willingly and lovingly take  <br/>
that car when he goes to Costco tomorrow morning, and it will be all  <br/>
gassed up when she wakes up to go to work.  And he won&#39;t grump about  <br/>
it or put it on her bill at interest, as his parents did with him  <br/>
about money.  It was low interest, 5 or 6%, but still...<br/>
<br/>
For Keith that must be healing and empowering, to give his daughter  <br/>
not just gas money, but a magically refilling tank, with no strings  <br/>
attached, no shame, no guilt.   And she really does appreciate it  <br/>
too.  She thanks him and brags him up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969041807">Crazy Machines is Karl&#39;s new favorite.  At first, we opened with &quot;new<br/>
game&quot; and it quickly led to burnout because each &quot;problem to solve&quot;<br/>
got progressively harder.  I wore out on it quicker than Karl.  Then<br/>
Karl happened upon &quot;my lab&quot; which is where the game operates more like<br/>
freestyle and, with all the components available to choose from, Karl<br/>
has had a literal blast.  Bombs, grenades and rockets that go kapow!<br/>
Dominoes, golf and tennis balls, basketballs.  All kinds of things to<br/>
setup and see what happens.  Karl has played for hours at a time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-920332042">We have legos, which he loves, and train tracks, which he likes me to<br/>
set up, sometimes. He&#39;s played with gears alot at the children&#39;s museum.<br/>
He likes them, but doesn&#39;t like that they slide away from each other<br/>
(they&#39;re magnetized), so he can only turn them a few times before<br/>
they&#39;ll stop working. He doesn&#39;t want to have to fix them again and<br/>
again. This is part of the problem I run into, that he has an idea in<br/>
his head of how they should work, and when they don&#39;t work that way, he<br/>
gets very frustrated and doesn&#39;t want to play with them anymore. We&#39;ve<br/>
talked about how inventors try things sometimes hundreds of times before<br/>
they get it to work, and I can see that his patience expands as he gets<br/>
older.<br/>
Today he spent about 15 minutes weaving our computer charging cord<br/>
through some angled tubes that are part of a build-your-own-saxophone.<br/>
It was the perfect activity for him, it didn&#39;t have a goal, he didn&#39;t<br/>
have a picture in his mind of how it should work, he fiddled with it for<br/>
awhile and seemed quite happy with how it turned out. Maybe I just need<br/>
to go to Home Depot and buy some pieces of things that fit together, and<br/>
see what happens?<br/>
I looked at Mouse Trap, and might get that. He would definitely enjoy<br/>
watching the machine (Club Penguin has a similar machine in the secret<br/>
agent headquarters, if anyone plays that), I think he&#39;d probably want me<br/>
to set it up, which is fine. I loved that game as a child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083826488">Our son spent hours and hours building / constructing with sticks, rocks, dirt, mud, things he just found lying around.  He built a dam in the middle of a rain shower - there was a channel of rain water in the dirt and he made a dam.  He made a waterfall under a faucet.  He dug a huge hole in our back yard - big enough to hide in.  Cardboard boxes became a boat, a car, a tank - big enough to sit in.  He had a lot of detail for example a soda carton became the boat motor off the back.  Gift wrap tubes became the tank cannon. He used various sizes of boxes to make forts, stations, etc. for his GI Joe&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
 The box stuff involved his dad.  The rock/stick/dirt creations he did himself.<br/>
<br/>
We had something called Tubers & Zots that are tubes and other shapes made from soft foam - the tubes were bendy - you could bend them and they&#39;d stay in that shape - these were a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
He had lots of fun with a hand drill (the old fashioned kind where you rotate the handle and it drills a hole) boards, nails, hammer, small saw, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He enjoyed non-hardening clay for a time - he made battle ships -<br/>
<br/>
CoinStructions - he liked those.  They have these little connector pieces that connect the coins together and you use penneys or other coins to build - they have a web site I believe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The two he still enjoys at 14 almost 15 is Zomes and Lego&#39;s - <br/>

Karl loved to watch me set it up and then he got to do the fun part of<br/>
sending the ball through it&#39;s paces.  And now he and I set it up<br/>
together, and he is gradually figuring how to make the parts go<br/>
together.  It&#39;s made to trip off verrry easily though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392009479">That&#39;s a game called Jungle Run. It&#39;s similar to Mouse Trap. It&#39;s based on a kids show in the UK. We got it at a bring and buy, I think. I can&#39;t find it on-line. Today though I spent time looking to see if I could get a hold of a Quadrilla marble run. They are just not easily available in the UK. Those are cool: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=quadrilla&x=0&y=0">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=quadrilla&x=0&y=0</a><br/>

Felt-tip pens are more soothing for many people than crayons are.   <br/>
Don&#39;t use stinky markers (like Sharpies), though.  Water-based felt  <br/>
tips.<br/>
<br/>
Not cheap newsprint-paper coloring books, but nice paper.  At least  <br/>
the paper from a printer.  You could print out some things to color,  <br/>
or find a book and photocopy some of the good pages so there&#39;s nothing  <br/>
on the back and the book itself isn&#39;t a hindrance.<br/>

That&#39;s a game called Jungle Run. It&#39;s similar to Mouse Trap. It&#39;s based on a kids show in the UK. We got it at a bring and buy, I think. I can&#39;t find it on-line. Today though I spent time looking to see if I could get a hold of a Quadrilla marble run. They are just not easily available in the UK. Those are cool: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=quadrilla&x=0&y=0">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=quadrilla&x=0&y=0</a><br/>

-=-I looked at Mouse Trap, and might get that.=-<br/>
<br/>
Mouse Trap is kinda fragile for a four-year-old.  We used to have a  <br/>
hard time making it work well when we were 12.<br/>
<br/>
On the young children page is mention and a photo or video of  <br/>
something Schuyler&#39;s kids have that&#39;s like a fancy marble run.<br/>

There are those corn based foam peanuts that you lick and stick together (or <br/>
use a moist sponge if you don&#39;t want to lick).<br/>
<br/>
Non- hardening clay or air drying clay which can then be painted. Crayola <br/>
has a version, but it might be cheaper just to buy air dry clay from the <br/>
craft store. Soon (or maybe already) they will be mature enough to do <br/>
polymer clay (it has to do with keeping the fingers out of the mouth while <br/>
working).<br/>
<br/>
Dough - like bread dough - can be used as a sculpting medium and then baked <br/>
and painted.<br/>
<br/>
American Science and Surplus www.sciplus.com constantly has new odd sets of <br/>
constructiony stuff or things like a bag of random prisms or pieces of cut <br/>
out wood or the leftover parts from something else being cut out. And school <br/>
supplies that can be adapted.<br/>

There is also a fleet of Lego aircraft across the entertainment center in the family room and the dresser in the spare bedroom.  Make a book of pictures of their constructions.  The pictures seemed to help give his projects permanence for him.  I know how he feels - I would not want to sew a dress or quilt a quilt and as soon as I finished it I had to rip it all apart to make something else.  Zac even told stories/narrations of what he did and why a specific piece was used to go along with a few of his constructions - we typed them out for him - added pictures and made it really nice.<br/>

saw Steven Caney&#39;s Ultimate Building Book. It would be wonderful for a<br/>
parent to have to pull ideas out of, and an older child might enjoy<br/>
browsing through it. It has lots of ideas for simple building homemade<br/>

construction, oh just about everything you might imagine about<br/>
building. Big huge book. :)<br/>

Oh yes... Many hours of fun here, especially when we had company.<br/>
<br/>
Get the miniature marshmallows and the flat toothpicks.  We&#39;ve had  <br/>
some pretty big structures here.<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re dry and the kids are tired of them, they&#39;re WONDERFUL to  <br/>
put in or next to a hot fire in the fireplace.  The toothpicks burn  <br/>
out like the filament in a lightbulb.  The marshmallows puff up slowly  <br/>
(because they&#39;re dry, I guess) and it never really bursts into flame  <br/>
until it&#39;s already gently fallen apart in odd ways.<br/>
