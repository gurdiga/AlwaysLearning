educational!&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Ok, I had an exhausting evening after the kids were<br/>
asleep with mom grilling me.  Mostly about reading,<br/>
how I need to teach Quentin phonics, blah, blah.  I&#39;m<br/>
trying to record (after she is now in bed) what she<br/>
said, I said so I can figure out what is going on. <br/>
<br/>
Here is just 2 comments & my replies & the &gt;&gt; are what<br/>
I think about it now.  Also, I have NOT asked her to<br/>
write down her concerns.  Don&#39;t know why.  Afraid it<br/>
will just make it worse?  I just turn to mush, or<br/>
maybe revert to when I was 3 yrs old, and I can&#39;t<br/>
think of how to respond when she starts in on me.  Oh,<br/>
well.  At least I recognize that the problem is HER<br/>
and not ME.  (I used to think I WAS the problem).  And<br/>
my dh is fully, extremely supportive.  She grilled him<br/>
last night (while I hid out in the bedroom) but it<br/>
didn&#39;t bother him so much since he doesn&#39;t have the<br/>
same issues with her.  <br/>
<br/>
Mom:  So do ALL homeschool families do it like you do,<br/>
just let their kids play all day?<br/>

<br/>
M: So how many people do you know who homeschool and<br/>
just let their kids play?  I mean you told me you knew<br/>

<br/>
H:  well, there are, I don&#39;t know, maybe 30 families<br/>
in our homeschool group (who do it that way).<br/>
<br/>

and do other things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655325723">Hey, Heather,  my heart goes out to you.  My mom makes me feel like I&#39;m <br/>
about 3 years old, too.  I only hope that if I make my girls feel that <br/>
way, it will only be to make them feel silly and giggly, not ashamed and <br/>
embarrassed.  Good luck to you.  HeidiC.<br/>

When I shared stories of homeschooled families that did not push reading, whose kids all learned to read just fine, but older than our societal norm, she said it was too bad that those people didn&#39;t make an effort to teach their kids sooner.<br/>

Lisa got reading quite easily at about 6 1/2,.  Jackie, now 7 1/2, is not an independent reader.<br/>

<br/>
What these people don&#39;t get is that it *is* important for kids to read &quot;on<br/>
time&quot; in school because the whole curriculum is based on reading.  Our kids<br/>
can learn in lots of ways, including being read to, so it doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
when they learn to read.  They aren&#39;t missing anything.<br/>
