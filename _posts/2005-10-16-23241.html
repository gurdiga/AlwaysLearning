<div id="ygrps-yiv-732329019">Is there anyone here perhaps from Hamilton, New Zealand?<br/>
<br/>
I just found this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-On November 25, 2004, a life-size bronze statue of Richard O&#39;Brien in his <br/>
Riff Raff space suit was unveiled in Hamilton, New Zealand, where O&#39;Brien grew <br/>
up after moving from England. Commissioned jointly by a local theatre group <br/>
and the Hamilton City Council, the statue stands on the site of the old Embassy <br/>
Cinema, where O&#39;Brien once watched science-fiction double features.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would love to have a photo of this, and if it&#39;s on a postcard that would be <br/>
VERY cool.<br/>
<br/>
With google I saw a photo of the plaque at the base of it (also cool) and <br/>
read that it was made by WETA, who did the props and lots of special effects for <br/>
the Lord of the Rings movies.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just came from living in New Zealand for 6 years 5 months ago. Never lived in Hamilton though and never heard of this statue. <br/>
<br/>
You could search some generic NZ websites, the first that springs to mind is  www.nzcity.co.nz  .<br/>
<br/>
Also, WETA might have archives online- google it to find out<br/>
<br/>
There is a magazine, New Zealand Geographic- modeled on National Geographic but even better, we enjoyed them immensely while there) which also might have searchable archives.<br/>
<br/>
And the official websites of Hamilton City and Tourism New Zealand could provide some leads too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have a photo or postcard of it to send you.<br/>
<br/>
