I was in attendance at the talk you gave last week.  Thank you again for sharing.  My husband had just finished reading Sandra&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling and we spent that evening discussing how we wanted our family to &quot;be&quot; in the future.  We know we will have bumps in the road but it was wonderful to discuss and be a bit more on the same page.  We will be able to hear Sandra speak at a conference in July and then again in September as well as meeting other families that live and learn together without school so we are looking forward to that.  <br/>
We will be looking into joining the HomeSchool Association of CA and attending their conference next year.  <br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
