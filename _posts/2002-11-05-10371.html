parents - my Dad is now at home with hospice for his cancer.<br/>
<br/>
We flew from San Diego to Phoenix - where we were supposed to have less than <br/>
an hour to wait for the flight to Minneapolis.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up being there over 5 hours --<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t give us a free ticket (which would be so useful as I am planning <br/>
to return to MN next month), but instead $50 off the next ticket.  I&#39;m flying <br/>
with someone else in Dec.<br/>
