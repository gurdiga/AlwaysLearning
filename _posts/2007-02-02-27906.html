<div id="ygrps-yiv-809062227">First some history since I haven&#39;t posted in quite awhile; My children are 10 and 7.  Their father passed away in May after being sick since March.  We have started putting our lives back together and moved into a new house in a different town.  We have lived here two months. My boyfriend has lived with us almost 3 yrs now.  We lived with their father until he passed away.  Recently they have started doing things my boyfriend asks them not too, especially my 10 yro daughter.  This does not happen to me.  Little things, but it is bothering him enough our house is starting to get really uncomfortable. We do not punish them, but talk.  I have given him different things to read about unschooling and peaceful parenting.  He feels like when they do these little things they are lying to him because they tell him they understand what he is saying and then do it anyway.  Here is an example of what happens; He asked them not to slide down the hill by our house when it was icy,<br/>
 because he didn&#39;t want them hitting the house.  When they did it anyway he explained that he didn&#39;t want them to get hurt and if they would have told him it was the best hill they could find, he would have showed them an even better one that didn&#39;t run into the house.  After something like this happens, he gets really upset.  This keeps happening and I cannot figure out what we are doing wrong.  It is interfering with our unschooling and making our home feel divided.  We used to do everything as a family.  Has this ever happened to anyone before and what can him or I do to communicate properly with the children?  He wants to start punishing them because it worked with him and I feel like that would make it worse.  Any advice is greatly appreciated. <br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144801856">Chrissie,<br/>
<br/>
I have the same question.  My daughter (8) also does things anyways.   <br/>
I have no advise to give as I am re-learning some things I seem to  <br/>
have forgotten these past 2 years.  What I can say is that punishment  <br/>
does NOT work. I made the mistake of trying it.... and not the time  <br/>
out type or go to your room, or threats of no TV etc..... I just  <br/>
started yelling at her and the more I let myself do that, the worse  <br/>
it got.... I can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if I locked her  <br/>
in her room without supper.  The results have accumulated over 2  <br/>
years and the only thing I have accomplished is to make her afraid of  <br/>
me, to make her feel she needs to lie, to push her away so that she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
Please, please do not resort to punishment...... please don&#39;t do that  <br/>
to them.  And please don&#39;t resort to hurtful words when feeling  <br/>
frustrated... making them feel horrible about themselves.... tears  <br/>
come to my eyes while writing this.  It&#39;s not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I patiently wait for the wise words of the parents on this list.  In  <br/>
just one day I made things different by following and re-learning  <br/>
what I used to do/be.  Just one day of &quot;yes&quot; and suddenly I&#39;m getting  <br/>
my spontaneous hugs back, the I love you&#39;s, 80% more co- <br/>
operation..... A reality slap in the face that it&#39;s not them (my  <br/>
children) it&#39;s how I react to them that creates nearly all the  <br/>
disturbance in our home... the resistance..... Please don&#39;t make my  <br/>
mistake.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad you asked!  Frankly (since you asked), I don&#39;t think your <br/>
daughters are the problem!  I think it&#39;s your boyfriend.  Apart from <br/>
all the extremely complex issues that your very young daughters are <br/>
having to go through regarding grieving for their father and now <br/>
having to live with and submit to the  rules & regs of someone whom <br/>
they probably did not choose, it would be far better if your <br/>
boyfriend understood that *he* is setting the girls up to &quot;disobey&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than tell them &quot;don&#39;t do this&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t do that,&quot; perhaps he <br/>
can be encouraged to use his experience and intellect to find ways of <br/>
helping them do what they seem to want to do!  For example, since <br/>
they like *that* hill, get a couple of bales of hay or some other <br/>
kind of soft barrier so they won&#39;t get hurt if they go too <br/>
far.  Showing them a &quot;better&quot; hill is not the same as helping them do <br/>
what they want to do (although he could show them other hills, too, <br/>
but not instead of that one).  If he finds ways of saying &quot;yes,&quot; he <br/>
will be supportive rather than undermining, and everyone (including <br/>
him) will be happier!  Saying &quot;no&quot; only encourages them to go <br/>
underground and get sneaky, which is a horrible dynamic and sets <br/>
things on a path of extreme yuckiness where it&#39;s *us against <br/>
them*.  That kind of thing will totally undermine unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
But, my gut is telling me (and I could, of course, be completely <br/>
wrong) that he may be annoyed that they&#39;re &quot;getting away&quot; with stuff <br/>
that *he* couldn&#39;t when he was a wee one.  My gut tells me that he&#39;s <br/>
kind of chomping at the bit to punish, and that&#39;s why he setting them <br/>
up with arbitrary restrictions that they *will* break so that he can <br/>
punish them.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion (since you asked) :-) would be to examine each one of <br/>
the *issues* that your boyfriend is having with what your girls are <br/>
doing that bug him, and find out *how* they can still do what *they* <br/>
want to do so that they are safe and happy and encouraged and feeling loved.<br/>
<br/>
And, if it were me (and, of course, it&#39;s not, but you *did* ask!), I <br/>
would let my boyfriend know unequivocally and in no uncertain terms <br/>
that disciplining *my* kids was not part of *his* job description, <br/>
and hands off!  If he wanted to understand unschooling better, I&#39;d be <br/>
happy to give him resources so he could get up to speed with my <br/>
parenting philosophies, but he would also be hearing from me that <br/>
until he understands what I&#39;m doing and why, his input is not <br/>
welcome!  I wouldn&#39;t give a @#$% what worked for him when he was <br/>
little because he&#39;s not them, you&#39;re not his mom, and they&#39;re not <br/>
living in the same circumstances that *he* did!  (You might consider <br/>
figuring out a gentler way to say that to him then I just did, but <br/>
I&#39;d keep the 2x4 handy, just in case!)  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!!<br/>

<br/>
Has he stated any intent to change and do things more the way you  <br/>
want them done?<br/>
If so, would he feel he was &quot;lying to you&quot; if he said he understood  <br/>
and then did it anyway?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a harsh definition of lying (and I&#39;m pretty harsh about the  <br/>
concept myself).<br/>
<br/>
Are they afraid NOT to agree with him during the conversation, and so  <br/>
the only way they can win or express themselves is to make their own  <br/>
decisions?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;ll be mad at them about making a decision in the moment, that&#39;s  <br/>
not helping them learn to make decisions, it&#39;s helping them learn to  <br/>
be afraid of him, to avoid him, and not to respect him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Put some old mattress or box springs against the house as a pad they  <br/>
can aim for.  Maybe they took it the way I did (MAYBE, not probably)  <br/>
if he said it the way you first worded it.  On the first sentence  <br/>
alone, it sounds like more concern for the house than for them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He wants to start punishing them because it worked with him and I  <br/>
feel like that would make it worse. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It &quot;worked&quot; for him in that he wants to pass it on.<br/>

<br/>
This is so true!  My kids were really on the fast track to sneakiness<br/>
when I had a lot of rules and limits in my house.  It concerned me to<br/>
see the adversarial relationship being created between us.  It really<br/>
made an impact on me when I discover one son trying to distract me while<br/>
my other son hovered in a corner of the garage gulping down the Capri<br/>
Sun he had smuggled from the fridge.  Yikes!  That got my attention and<br/>
I realized that this was NOT the relationship I wanted with my kids.  I<br/>
decided right then to go from rules to principles! <br/>
<br/>
That was almost two years ago and I had a wonderful conversation with my<br/>
8 year old about lying the other day that confirms we are on the right<br/>
path.  He asked me if I ever lied.  I say that of course I&#39;ve lied.  He<br/>
asked why.  I said that whenever I lie, it&#39;s usually because I&#39;m afraid<br/>
that the person I&#39;m lying to will not love me anymore if they knew the<br/>
truth.  I said that I really try hard not to lie and if I ever feel the<br/>
desire I remember that I&#39;m lovable anyway and I don&#39;t have to hide my<br/>
mistakes.  (I wasn&#39;t saying this in a preachy kind of way, hoping he&#39;d<br/>
get it. It was just a conversation and the sincere truth for me.)  He<br/>
thought for a minute and said, &quot;I haven&#39;t lied in a long time. I really<br/>
don&#39;t have a reason to anymore.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I love those little moments.<br/>

  Yes you helped a lot.  Oh and I have a 10 yro daughter and a 7 yro son lol.  I think his childhood did have a lot to do with him being so upset, because he did feel like they were &quot;getting away&quot; with things and he never did.  When you said he was &quot;setting the children up to &quot;disobey&quot; him&quot;, that really made him think.  Thank you so much for the advice and don&#39;t worry about putting up your dukes, things are starting to feel much better and more peaceful around here.<br/>

kids to question the permanence of every single person in their realm,<br/>
after experiencing Death.  &quot;Why should I listen to you? You&#39;re just<br/>
gonna die anyway!!&quot; was my first thought when I read their behaviors. <br/>
It&#39;s a bizarre human thing to think that Death is somehow easier if we<br/>
just don&#39;t love each other so much... but we do it, we distance<br/>
ourselves to avoid the pain.  Then there are those who refuse to be<br/>
distanced, who come again and again with love, and those are the ones<br/>
you know you won&#39;t mind missing so much.  They&#39;re worth our appreciation<br/>
in the here and now.  I would say the benefits of his relationship with<br/>
them has to outweigh their fear of the death of another loved one.  Let<br/>
him be the *fun, right here* guy, more than usual, for a while.  There&#39;s<br/>
a faith renewal that needs to happen here: 1- we can survive Death; 2-<br/>
we can count on those who are still here; 3-Life is the best way to<br/>
spend our time before we die.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on forever!  But I&#39;ll sum up with, this behavior is a call<br/>
for a gentle, loving response.  Worth it!<br/>

and peaceful parenting. He feels like when they do these little things<br/>
they are lying to him because they tell him they understand what he is<br/>
saying and then do it anyway. Here is an example of what happens; He<br/>
asked them not to slide down the hill by our house when it was icy,<br/>
because he didn&#39;t want them hitting the house. When they did it anyway<br/>
he explained that he didn&#39;t want them to get hurt and if they would have<br/>
told him it was the best hill they could find, he would have showed them<br/>
an even better one that didn&#39;t run into the house. After something like<br/>
this happens, he gets really upset. This keeps happening and I cannot<br/>
figure out what we are doing wrong. It is interfering with our<br/>
unschooling and making our home feel divided. We used to do everything<br/>
as a family. Has this ever happened to anyone before and what can him<br/>
or I do to communicate properly with the children? He wants to start<br/>
punishing them because it worked with him and I feel like that would<br/>
make it worse. Any advice is greatly appreciated.<br/>

kids to question the permanence of every single person in their realm,<br/>
after experiencing Death. &quot;Why should I listen to you? You&#39;re just<br/>
gonna die anyway!!&quot; was my first thought when I read their behaviors. <br/>
It&#39;s a bizarre human thing to think that Death is somehow easier if we<br/>
just don&#39;t love each other so much... but we do it, we distance<br/>
ourselves to avoid the pain. Then there are those who refuse to be<br/>
distanced, who come again and again with love, and those are the ones<br/>
you know you won&#39;t mind missing so much. They&#39;re worth our appreciation<br/>
in the here and now. I would say the benefits of his relationship with<br/>
them has to outweigh their fear of the death of another loved one. Let<br/>
him be the *fun, right here* guy, more than usual, for a while. There&#39;s<br/>
a faith renewal that needs to happen here: 1- we can survive Death; 2-<br/>
we can count on those who are still here; 3-Life is the best way to<br/>
spend our time before we die.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on forever! But I&#39;ll sum up with, this behavior is a call<br/>
for a gentle, loving response. Worth it!<br/>
