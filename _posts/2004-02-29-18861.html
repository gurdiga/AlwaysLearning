<div id="ygrps-yiv-937010917">I&#39;m planning on attending the conference this year and am trying to <br/>
make plans.  I know the schedule isn&#39;t done yet, but I was wondering <br/>
when will talks/activities begin?  I assume sometime Friday, will it <br/>
be morning, afternoon, or evening?  I&#39;m trying to decide when I want <br/>
to arrive.  When are most people going to be arriving?  I don&#39;t want <br/>
to miss anything!  When will the activities end?  Should I plan on <br/>
staying over Sunday night?  <br/>
<br/>
I guess that is it.  With my job and my husband&#39;s job we need to plan <br/>
early.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731884110">I think it&#39;s starting Friday afternoon and ending sunday with the whale-watch <br/>
outing.<br/>
<br/>
Whether to stay Sunday depends on how far you have to go to get home, maybe.  <br/>
I know there will be some people staying Sunday night, and it might be a good <br/>
time to talk *quietly* with some people.  <br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but I think both Kelly and Kathryn are busy with other <br/>
things today so I&#39;m chucking out a guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010078016">Thanks for the feedback.  We live about a 12 hour drive away, so I am trying to decide when we should arrive and when we should leave.  I think we will stay Sunday night and leave Monday morning.<br/>
