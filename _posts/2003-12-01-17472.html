<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724184843">I just got off the phone with Carolyn, and there are some openings left <br/>
for this homeschool camp.  This camp is really cool cause the working <br/>
parent can attend on the weekend, and then go back to work while the <br/>
other parent and kids can stay through thursday!  THe price is really <br/>
reasonable, and it&#39;s a good getaway.  If you have any questions, email <br/>
me.  I highly recommend this camp, the food is great, the people are <br/>
wonderful, the environment is restfull, the cabins are comfortable (not <br/>
the hilton, but nice!) and it&#39;s worth every minute!<br/>
<br/>
for those of you who are not in California, the camp is in the San <br/>
Bernadino mountains, about one hour, 20 minutes (without traffic) from <br/>
Orange County (disneyland), about the same from LA.  It&#39;s worth a longer <br/>
drive, though, and people have come from all over--from Arizona, Utah, <br/>
Northern California, etc. <br/>
