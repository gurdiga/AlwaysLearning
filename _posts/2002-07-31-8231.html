<div id="ygrps-yiv-349046536">I know controlling food has been discussed before, but I was <br/>
wondering if anyone would be willing to discuss it again.  We are <br/>
about to begin a new experiment in our house, and I&#39;m kind of anxious <br/>
about it.  My biggest fear is that my little ones won&#39;t get the <br/>
nutrition they need.  My kids are ages 9, 5, and 3.  <br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re going to do is take dh&#39;s paycheck, subtract all necessary <br/>
expenses (taxes,utilities, etc.).  We&#39;re not subtracting groceries <br/>
from that amount except for a small amount to allow me to shop at a <br/>
bargain store to stock up on really good deals.  The rest of the <br/>
money is going to be divided by the 5 of us.  Everyone can go <br/>
shopping for their own food.  Whatever money they have left at the <br/>
end of the month is theirs to spend on whatever.  Everyone is going <br/>
to rotate preparing a meal for everyone else, paid for by their <br/>
funds.  It can be a lasagna dinner or it can be bread and butter.  If <br/>
someone doesn&#39;t want to eat someone else&#39;s meal they can make their <br/>
own.  If someone wants to skimp on food in order to save more of <br/>
their moeny for something else, they can.  Each person is going to <br/>
get enough money that they can easily buy all their own food plus <br/>
have some spending money left over.  People can agree together and <br/>
put their money together to buy bigger things if they want to, or <br/>
they can spend it on junk.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course I&#39;ll help the kids figure out their own money and help <br/>
anyone who needs it to prepare their meals.  <br/>
<br/>
My two big hopes are that I&#39;ll eliminate the whining for expensive <br/>
cereals at the grocery store and that they will eventually choose to <br/>
eat their own fruits and veggies without me making them.  Any <br/>
opionions on this experiment?  Is it a good idea?  <br/>
<br/>
But what if they never choose to eat fruits and veggies.  Will they <br/>
grow up healthy?</div>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s a terrible idea, logistically, financially, socially, <br/>
emotionally...<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s doomed to failure and you should cancel it right away.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But what if they never choose to eat fruits and veggies.  Will they <br/>
grow up healthy?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  And if fruit and veggies have to come out of their part of the budget <br/>
they probably won&#39;t buy any.  <br/>
<br/>
That plan doesn&#39;t even work with three adult roommates who can read and do <br/>
math and who have ideas about nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
There have to be some basics in a house.  Bread.  Milk.  Juice.  <br/>
And staples:  flour, sugar, rice, salt, vanilla<br/>
And spices are expensive.  Whose budget does cinnamon come under?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The rest of the <br/>
money is going to be divided by the 5 of us.  Everyone can go <br/>
shopping for their own food.  Whatever money they have left at the <br/>
end of the month is theirs to spend on whatever. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NO, no no no no, that&#39;s not going to work.<br/>
<br/>
Buy food you think everyone will like.  Buy fruit and make it easily <br/>
available.  Let them pick some foods even if they&#39;re expensive cereals.  Let <br/>
them have choices, let them help decide about ingredients and menus and let <br/>
them eat between meals.  Help them make sandwiches.  But don&#39;t try to make a <br/>
little kid budget money and feel hungry or guilty.  Eliminating hunger and <br/>
guilt is one of the best advantages to loosening up food &quot;rules,&quot; but your <br/>
proposed experiment will end up being ALL about hunger, guilt, embarrassment, <br/>
and failure.<br/>

----------<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a really bad idea, but Sandra has already taken up all the good<br/>
reasons so all I can do is wave my arms around foolishly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can eliminate the whining at grocery stores by not taking them with you.<br/>
;) Of course, even my 4 year old knows to tell me, &quot;put M&Ms on the shopping<br/>
list&quot;. &lt;g&gt; But seriously, if they have to go to the trouble to remember to<br/>
tell you to put it on the list, it&#39;s not the same as impulse buying in the<br/>
store and &quot;spotting&quot; 2000 brightly colored packages, all of which they want,<br/>
in the sensory overload of the grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
But what if they never choose to eat fruits and veggies.  Will they<br/>
grow up healthy?<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
My four year old (who will be 5 in October) eats no fruit or vegetable that<br/>
is close to its original self -- she&#39;ll eat pizza, which contains tomatoes<br/>
in sauce. She&#39;ll eat fruit rolls, &quot;made with 10% real fruit!&quot; A few more<br/>
things along those lines. She survives on Bagel Bites (there&#39;s that tomato<br/>
sauce again), bread and butter, and various meat and dairy products. In one<br/>
of my few eating-coercive moves (in fact, the only one I can think of &lt;g&gt;) I<br/>
give her a multi-vitamin every day.<br/>
<br/>
Her sister likes some fruits but not veggies (except for huge green salads),<br/>
and gets the same vitamin.<br/>
<br/>
Both appear to be healthy as horses. Nice teeth, strong bones, don&#39;t seem to<br/>
catch colds and flus more easily than the average child, run all day, plenty<br/>
of lungpower for shrieking out &quot;Charmander, I Choose YOU!&quot; in Pokemon games,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
They do eat some &quot;junk&quot; (candy, etc.) but it&#39;s not a huge priority with<br/>
them. They don&#39;t gulp down candy the second it comes home, and we always<br/>
have it available. It&#39;s more an absence of fruits and vegetables in their<br/>
standard forms, and I expect they&#39;ll choose them more as they get older -- I<br/>
did.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They aren&#39;t old enough for this.<br/>
<br/>
Just be sensitive to their likes and dislikes - while being flexible so that <br/>
they aren&#39;t forever locked into &quot;I don&#39;t like peanut butter&quot; just because for <br/>
a few months when they were 5 they didn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
Let them pick out some stuff - you pick out the stuff you want them to eat <br/>
and have it there and convenient. Don&#39;t make them eat anything - just have it <br/>
ready and easily available, they&#39;ll eat it when they&#39;re hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Those bags of already peeled little baby carrots have been great for us - <br/>
cool and crunchy and just need a bag opened - no peeling, etc. Lazy? Yeah- <br/>
but my kids and I now eat a LOT of carrots. They&#39;re apparently especially <br/>
good with some ranch dressing. <br/>
<br/>
Fruit and sliced cheese are always easily available. And rice cakes. <br/>
I buy the frozen Amy&#39;s burritos - they seem a bit expensive - but they are <br/>
very nutritious and filling and beat the heck out of a quick trip for <br/>
fastfood.<br/>
<br/>
I do the shopping - I buy the groceries. There is a white board on the <br/>
refrigerator and sometimes someone writes on there: &quot;GRAPES&quot; or &quot;BLUEBERRY <br/>
MORNING CEREAL.&quot; I do if they are in season, reasonably priced, on sale or <br/>
whatever. Otherwise I tell them why I didn&#39;t buy it and what I got instead.<br/>
<br/>
As I walk out the door to go shopping I always ask, &quot;Does anybody want <br/>
anything at the grocery store?&quot; Sometimes I even call home from the grocery <br/>
store and doublecheck something. It isn&#39;t like I&#39;m not being responsive -- <br/>
but I&#39;m the one who sees the big picture about food. I&#39;m the one who knows we <br/>
need stuff that we can prepare really quickly on Tuesday and Thursdays <br/>
because we&#39;re busy on those days and that we need stuff to take to the park <br/>
on Wednesdays and so on.  I don&#39;t think the kids need to start doing that <br/>
kind of &quot;meta-thinking&quot; that their parents do - let them live &quot;in the moment&quot; <br/>
as they usually do. <br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t do a lot of unreasonable begging for things in the grocery <br/>
stores. I always buy what they ask for - seldom say no - and only if I really <br/>
do have a good reason. I think that was because, when they were really <br/>
little, we&#39;d walk in the door with them knowing that they could pick out <br/>
something special. I never made a big deal out of it being ONE thing special <br/>
- never really thought about it that much - it was just fun - as we walked up <br/>
to the door I&#39;d say, &quot;Okay - so what really special thing are you going to <br/>
get today?&quot; They&#39;d spend the time choosing between different things - to <br/>
figure out what the special thing was going to be -- cookies or ice cream or <br/>
whatever. I guess if they wanted something more I probably said things like, <br/>
&quot;Hey - that can be your special thing next time&quot; or something like that. This <br/>
was when they were really little - like under five. After that I just don&#39;t <br/>
remember - it was not a problem. I don&#39;t usually take them now unless they <br/>
really want to go - they all have a tendency to TALK my ear off while I&#39;m <br/>
trying to shop and I always forget something important - even with a list (I <br/>
just somehow don&#39;t see it on the list). If they really want to go - then I <br/>
figure it is because they want to spend time alone with me - so then I&#39;m GLAD <br/>
to do that - how cool is it when our kids WANT to hang out with us, even when <br/>
we&#39;re just grocery shopping -- that&#39;s NICE! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d concentrate on having enticing and reasonably healthy stuff easily <br/>
available. And maybe finding a way to go grocery shopping without them most <br/>
of the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872595159">I lucked out a few months ago and found a grocery store that delivers our<br/>
groceries.  I make a menu every Saturday for the coming week.  I go online<br/>
and order what we need (and want).  I specify time and date for the delivery<br/>
and Wala! there&#39;s our grocery shopping nightmares, gone for good! I pay<br/>
$8.95 delivery fee, but it is well worth it.<br/>
After making our menu, I put it on the fridge so everyone knows what meals<br/>
are available.  We take turns choosing what is for dinner or lunch that day.<br/>
Sometimes hubby and I eat food the kids hate, so we have &quot;alternates&quot;<br/>
avaiable for them (like sandwiches, easy mac, pizza, soup, etc).  We gave up<br/>
forcing them to eat stuff they don&#39;t like and surprisingly Max, who is the<br/>
pickiest eater here, has begun trying and liking new foods on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Ordering groceries has solved several problems for us....<br/>
1) the kids no longer drive me nuts while I am shopping for groceries<br/>
2) we do less impulse buying<br/>
3) we rarely eat out at a resteraunt now (this used to be our biggest budget<br/>
buster!)<br/>
4) when someone says &quot;What&#39;s for dinner&quot;, instead of a blank stare, I can<br/>
give them the menu list hahaha<br/>
5) I cook more now and really enjoy it, we try new recipes once a week<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870198750">I think others have already said the things I would say about this. But I<br/>
am having a hard time trying to imagine a 3-year-old (or 5 or even<br/>
9)wandering around the grocery store, wallet in hand, trying to make<br/>
judgements about what he/she should purchase to make for dinner that<br/>
evening. Heck even I have problems with that sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best way to get kids eating healthily is to get them involved<br/>
in helping with buying and cooking meals. We talk about what&#39;s good for us<br/>
and why as we buy it and that helps kids understand in an appropriate<br/>
developmental way.<br/>
<br/>
My 22-year-old brother was here this summer between chef jobs. He graduated<br/>
last year after a year at the Cordon Bleu in Paris. Anyway watching him<br/>
create wonderful dishes has spurred my oldest on and so this summer he has<br/>
decided he wants to become a better cook. We have had some great meals so<br/>
far and he has amazed himself at how much he already knows. That basically<br/>
came from hanging out and helping me since he has been little. He has also<br/>
been shopping for and cooking whole meals himself but ONLY since he was<br/>
about 13/14. Perhaps younger would be possible but I surely don&#39;t think 3<br/>
is fair.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps making a budget and saying we have $5 for &quot;junk&quot; food and you guys<br/>
decide how to split that up. Then perhaps they can start value shopping for<br/>
the cheaper cereals etc.<br/>

----------<br/>
Please don&#39;t feel picked on. I think we all know what you&#39;re wanting to do,<br/>
and it&#39;s an admirable goal, but I have to agree that this isn&#39;t the way to<br/>
achieve it. The complications boggle the mind and I can&#39;t imagine the<br/>
program lasting past the second trip to the store.<br/>
<br/>
I still deal with my own food-demons from childhood, so I want to be careful<br/>
with the kids. In my case, I have a casual, hands-off approach. Breakfast is<br/>
usually up to them (6 and 11 yo) although I&#39;ll cheerfully make something if<br/>
they request it. Around midday, I&#39;ll see who&#39;s hungry and let them know<br/>
what&#39;s available; it&#39;s a joint effort. Supper I&#39;ll make, unless we&#39;ve had a<br/>
big lunch, in which case it&#39;s snacktime. I keep fruits and veggies available<br/>
as much as possible, and try to have them at each meal, even if it&#39;s just a<br/>
bag of baby carrots slung on the table. For snacks, which they can have<br/>
whenever they&#39;re hungry, they choose between yogurt, pudding, fruit,<br/>
pretzels, or candy. They rarely choose the candy, and if I do come in to<br/>
find a stack of empty Hershey Kisses wrappers, I chalk it up to the<br/>
occasional chocolate attack. Heck, I have those too. Since I&#39;ve adapted<br/>
this, ice cream goes bad, cookies get stale, they just don&#39;t beg for them<br/>
like they used to.<br/>
<br/>
Budgeting is something that I expect will take awhile to learn (again, I&#39;m<br/>
still learning!) and it seems dangerous somehow to tie it to food this<br/>
early.<br/>

When I was a kid it was so treasured and measured it was gone in no time and <br/>
no more expected until the next eat-it-all frenzy (meaning the next time it <br/>
was brought into the house.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to *count* M&Ms or grapes into four equal piles for the four <br/>
kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Stuff like that only made it worse.<br/>
<br/>
There were two adults and four kids at our house.  A dozen (donuts, or <br/>
pinwheel cookies or sodas) meant two apiece.  No negotiating.  Two are yours. <br/>
 As an act of hostility sometimes one of the kids (never me) would save one <br/>
and consume it in a leisurely fashion right in front of the rest of us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527861205">Hi,<br/>
If you have to take the kids with you why not let them pick cereals from a <br/>
certain company or store brand only?  Is there a less expensive store <br/>
nearby?  Our local store is 5 minutes away, but the lower price store is <br/>
about 30 minutes.  The drive is worth the price for us.<br/>
Would they be willing to each pick out a fresh fruit/vegetable to share with <br/>
the family?  Canned or frozen fruits/ veggies?<br/>

&gt;My two big hopes are that I&#39;ll eliminate the whining for expensive<br/>
&gt;cereals at the grocery store and that they will eventually choose to<br/>
&gt;eat their own fruits and veggies without me making them.  Any<br/>
&gt;opionions on this experiment?  Is it a good idea?<br/>
&gt;----------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it&#39;s a really bad idea, but Sandra has already taken up all the <br/>
&gt;good<br/>
&gt;reasons so all I can do is wave my arms around foolishly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can eliminate the whining at grocery stores by not taking them with <br/>
&gt;you.<br/>
&gt;;) Of course, even my 4 year old knows to tell me, &quot;put M&Ms on the <br/>
&gt;shopping<br/>
&gt;list&quot;. &lt;g&gt; But seriously, if they have to go to the trouble to remember to<br/>
&gt;tell you to put it on the list, it&#39;s not the same as impulse buying in the<br/>
&gt;store and &quot;spotting&quot; 2000 brightly colored packages, all of which they <br/>
&gt;want,<br/>
&gt;in the sensory overload of the grocery store.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;----------<br/>
&gt;But what if they never choose to eat fruits and veggies.  Will they<br/>
&gt;grow up healthy?<br/>
&gt;----------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My four year old (who will be 5 in October) eats no fruit or vegetable that<br/>
&gt;is close to its original self -- she&#39;ll eat pizza, which contains tomatoes<br/>
&gt;in sauce. She&#39;ll eat fruit rolls, &quot;made with 10% real fruit!&quot; A few more<br/>
&gt;things along those lines. She survives on Bagel Bites (there&#39;s that tomato<br/>
&gt;sauce again), bread and butter, and various meat and dairy products. In one<br/>
&gt;of my few eating-coercive moves (in fact, the only one I can think of &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;give her a multi-vitamin every day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Her sister likes some fruits but not veggies (except for huge green <br/>
&gt;salads),<br/>
&gt;and gets the same vitamin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Both appear to be healthy as horses. Nice teeth, strong bones, don&#39;t seem <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;catch colds and flus more easily than the average child, run all day, <br/>
&gt;plenty<br/>
&gt;of lungpower for shrieking out &quot;Charmander, I Choose YOU!&quot; in Pokemon <br/>
&gt;games,<br/>
&gt;etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They do eat some &quot;junk&quot; (candy, etc.) but it&#39;s not a huge priority with<br/>
&gt;them. They don&#39;t gulp down candy the second it comes home, and we always<br/>
&gt;have it available. It&#39;s more an absence of fruits and vegetables in their<br/>
&gt;standard forms, and I expect they&#39;ll choose them more as they get older -- <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;did.<br/>
