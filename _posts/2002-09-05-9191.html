<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297784698">Shyrley -- This is so true -- going just under the speed limit seems to <br/>
frustrate the ponies out of all the road ragers on I-95 (not only a <br/>
highway name but a speed limit for same.) ~ Alicia<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids do that but I rarely speed. I get more enjoyment going 1<br/>
mph under it here in uptight VA.<br/>
