<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036610714">As the original poster, I want to clarify there is no fear deep inside.  I unschool all my boys right now and they are all happily free and learning on their own terms.  My son loves being home and I predict he will come back before a year is up, but he wants to see what it is all about.  School is portrayed in a fantasy way on TV and in movies and then ALL of his friends go to school  (we live in Costa Rica so not many kids don&#39;t go to school here).  We have talked extensively about it, pros and cons, what to expect day to day and I am going to have him do 2 trial days before the year is up (school is Feb-Nov here) so he can see first hand and maybe that will be enough.  I am supporting his decisions to explore.  I posted on the list because I wanted some advice from someone that has been through this before.  I feel school is a BAD place but some children thrive and love it so I need to give him that opportunity if it is what he seeks.  I<br/>
 don&#39;t want him dreaming of this fabulous place with no first hand knowledge of what it is really like.  Just wanted to clarify and I think you all for your responses.<br/>
