<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048869890">&lt;&lt;Labels everywhere&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did that this summer for Marsie (5) who really wants to learn to read.<br/>
The kids looked at them for a couple of days.  We played treasure hunt with<br/>
clues taking you from label to label, etc..  Then the kids didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
pay any attention to them at all.<br/>
<br/>
I was gone with Adriane and Zach to a stock show over the weekend and when I<br/>
got back, Dh had removed all labels, declaring that his compulsive heart<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand the clutter anymore.  He had asked Marsie if it was OK with<br/>
her and she said sure, that she could now read (this was news to us).  Dh<br/>
held up a card and asked her what it said and she gave him the correct<br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently she was soaking it up even if it didn&#39;t look like it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>so you &gt;have some information on the side.  It&#39;s not<br/>
something adoption &gt;and lots of love can overcome<br/>
entirely.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the same reason that identification (labeling)<br/>
of developmental or other differences can and does<br/>
provide a lot of help, for those they are applied to<br/>
and for those they live with.  As a parent it gives<br/>
you a whole new toolbox to look into, new places to<br/>
look for ideas and answers to behaviors that may be<br/>
totally baffling to you and are hurting your life or<br/>
relationship with the person affected or in question. <br/>
It gives you a way to connect yourself to others who<br/>
are struggling with similar challenges to network and<br/>
help each other, or just find understanding friends. <br/>
It&#39;s a huge relief also to know that your child&#39;s<br/>
challenges are not because you&#39;re doing a horrible job<br/>
as a parent.  The hard work you do of parenting<br/>
differently challenged kids can be recognized and<br/>
acknowledged as well, even if just in your own heart. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For a person to whom the lables might apply they help<br/>
you to understand yourself and your own needs better,<br/>
help you to meet those needs better and create coping<br/>
mechanisms that are healthy and positive while not<br/>
thinking you are broken or stupid or what have you. <br/>
Knowing there is a reason for your thoughts, feelings<br/>
or actions can be extremely reassuring and emotionally<br/>
a huge relief.  A diagnosis or label does not become<br/>
an excuse, but it is a *reason* that can be looked at<br/>
and studied and addressed.  It&#39;s a starting point.<br/>
<br/>
For dealing with other, including extended families,<br/>
having some labels can help you to lead them to<br/>
information to help them understand the affected<br/>
person better and to be more tolerant and accepting of<br/>
their needs.  It&#39;s VERY common for extended families<br/>
or other peripheral people in your life to have a<br/>
complete turnaround in their attitude and behavior<br/>
towards (for instance) your high functioning autistic<br/>
child when they understand that this is real, no they<br/>
are not just &quot;a brat&quot; and you are not a bad parent or<br/>
crazy or something.  While there is something to be<br/>
said for writing off those unwilling to accept and<br/>
love your family as they are, there is also much to be<br/>
said to meet them halfway by providing information<br/>
they can understand and allowing them to learn through<br/>
that method what you have learned by living with the<br/>
affected person(s.)<br/>
<br/>
After all, even a ton of &quot;normal&quot; social behaviors can<br/>
look totally bizarre and have an adverse affect on<br/>
people socially if you don&#39;t have background<br/>
information about the behaviors or about the person<br/>
doing them.<br/>

That&#39;s fine, but unschooling will still work .<br/>
<br/>
Few families of ANY unschooled kid will go long without thinking or  <br/>
saying that the parents are crazy or bad or the kid is a brat.  That  <br/>
will pass, but it happens to most unschooled kids and parents.<br/>

I think looking for differences is less helpful on a list like this  <br/>
than looking at similarities.<br/>

four of my children whole and shining as who they are. I hope nobody reading<br/>
this thread or any of the posts here would think because their child may<br/>

the same time it is hard to isolate it away from schooling too, as you<br/>
mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder in your example of your own life Barbara, if you had known about<br/>
dyslexia before your twenties if that would have been helpful or not while<br/>
you tried to navigate through a system that required you to read potentially<br/>
before you ready to.<br/>
<br/>
There are studies, none of which I have my hands on currently, that dyslexia<br/>
can actually be caused from forcing the brain to read before it is ready.<br/>
School is REALLY good at that!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son every now and then will say, &quot;It&#39;s because I&#39;m autistic&quot;...but<br/>
it is usually an informational statement for whoever he is talking to (I<br/>
heard him answer someone who asked, &quot;Dude...why do you mumble so much?&quot;) not<br/>
so much why he CAN&#39;T do something. But why he is the way he is in this<br/>
current moment. He works pretty hard to get better at things that are<br/>
challenges to him.<br/>
<br/>
If he was in school and was told he was autistic, it may have had a very<br/>
different effect on him, and may have given some of that &quot;self-fulfilling<br/>
prophecy&quot;. Eww.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Sandra&#39;s statement about using labels as an excuse was more geared<br/>
toward parents using the label as an excuse why their kids couldn&#39;t do<br/>
something. That&#39;s what confused me.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177349593">I&#39;ve told before about the girl who was playing in the swimming pool  <br/>
with two of my girls and her two sisters -- she was doing annoying  <br/>
things, messing up the game they were trying to play by splashing  <br/>
really big, etc. (She wasn&#39;t the youngest of the kids, by the way,  <br/>
she was 9 and the kids ranged in age from 6 to 11.)<br/>
<br/>
So - they were being pretty patient with her - her own sisters were  <br/>
firmly saying things like &quot;Lacey please stop doing that.&quot; One of my  <br/>
daughters pulled out a pool toy and said, &quot;Lacy if you take it a  <br/>
little ways away, you can play with this.&quot; Anyway - they were making  <br/>
an effort to make it clear to her they wanted her to stop and they  <br/>
offered her an alternative - they&#39;d already tried to include her in  <br/>
several ways.<br/>
<br/>
Well - finally their voices were starting get a little impatient  <br/>
sounding - they&#39;re all VERY sweet girls - they were truly not being  <br/>
mean or harsh with her -- but I heard her say to them, &quot;You KNOW I&#39;m  <br/>
special needs and you have to be nice and let me do what I want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a long story behind this child&#39;s problems - she&#39;d had  <br/>
leukemia at 6 years old. Before that she was in school and reading  <br/>
really well and clearly very bright. All five of her siblings were  <br/>
school successes, if you know what I mean. But she&#39;d had massive  <br/>
amounts of chemotherapy AND she&#39;d developed a secondary bone disease  <br/>
that had been treated with additional very strong meds -- and they&#39;d  <br/>
had an impact on her learning ability. After a year and a half out of  <br/>
school, she went back and had lots of trouble and was diagnosed with  <br/>
all kinds of learning disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - yes, I heard her MANY times use &quot;I am special needs&quot; as an  <br/>
excuse for being rude and demanding and so on. I don&#39;t know how that  <br/>
was being nurtured in her family, but it clearly was happening.<br/>
<br/>
That is just one example - but it was very extreme and specific.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is SUCH an incredibly sad story. I can&#39;t even imagine how that mixed<br/>
things up for that family.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest had his third open-heart surgery a year and a half ago at 15,<br/>
a procedure that went bad...lost him on the table for a bit...loss of oxygen<br/>
because of it...took 9 hours to complete what was supposed to take 4...it<br/>
took over a year (well, it&#39;s only been a year and a half since it happened,<br/>
so maybe we&#39;re still in recovery) for our guy to seem healthy again, and be<br/>
more himself. He was very confused often about the changes in his body and<br/>
mind from that surgery...he had pretty awful long-term side effects. He was<br/>
also deeply depressed for a while.<br/>
<br/>
As a parent in this situation, I can tell you that there is no clear line<br/>
between when you say, &quot;It seems to be one of the effects of the procedure&quot;<br/>
which I would say when he was feeling so badly about not being able to do<br/>
something and it was most likely because of the procedure, and when you say,<br/>
&quot;Suck it up. Move on.&quot; (a term my whole extended family uses and I<br/>
personally hate). I understand it is our job to keep it real with our kids<br/>
as they learn about how to function in the world, but when you are thrown<br/>
these unexpected sharp curve balls, the standard navigation in parenting<br/>
changes dramatically. Much less charted waters to draw from.<br/>
<br/>
That time was the most intensely painful experience any of my family&#39;s<br/>
lives. The healing comes slowly over time, and knowing exactly how to handle<br/>
all the changes in our lives because of it was very difficult. Who knows<br/>
when a parent should stop talking about &quot;special needs&quot; because of<br/>
chemotherapy? I sure don&#39;t. And I can see how easy it would be to be<br/>
confused about that. It seems like at that moment in time, that girl was<br/>
using a label in a negative way. Hopefully, someone helped to balance it out<br/>
for her.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like your daughter and friends handled this girl really well...she<br/>
probably would have gotten far less patience with most people. These outside<br/>
experiences will be some of the ways she learns about her behavior, I bet.<br/>
My son continues to learn from these outside experiences as well.<br/>
<br/>
Though I am happy to say that he is just thriving now, and doesn&#39;t even look<br/>
back to the hard times!<br/>

analogy (if that&#39;s the right word...)<br/>
<br/>
Imagine a horse being raised in a two legged society, and everyone is<br/>

come up with all sorts of strategies to make it easier, devices to help<br/>
support the back legs (because, after all, the horse was born w/ this<br/>
disability.)  And, most of the time the horse can stand on two feet... they<br/>
get by.  That&#39;s how I view the labels and the treatments, especially for<br/>
dyslexia.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the intervention helps the poor horse stand on two feet.  Yes, the<br/>
intervention helps the poor child read they way they are &quot;supposed&quot; to.<br/>
But that&#39;s not what I would have wanted in my life.... I wanted to run!<br/>
<br/>
The best for me would have been no school at all... but the next best for<br/>
me was being able to find my own path, being able to figure out how to work<br/>
around the system, being able to figure out that I was a horse and that<br/>
running on four legs was what felt the best for me.  A label and all of the<br/>
intervention that goes along with that would have probably stifled me for<br/>
life.<br/>

always been &quot;different&quot; in the way I process visual information.  Being<br/>
pushed to read early (and being forced to use a reading method which didn&#39;t<br/>
suite me at all) just made the difference more noticeable compared to other<br/>
kids.  That&#39;s why I think that labels based on comparisons with others just<br/>
get in the way of noticing and being who we are, or noticing and connection<br/>
with who our kids are, allowing each of us to uniquely flourish.<br/>

Yes, but I think there are people that DO display dyslexic tendencies<br/>
that don&#39;t have a genetic difference like yourself.<br/>
I think school and all their methods &quot;see&quot; dyslexia when no difference<br/>
really exists...it causes symptoms because of the methods, not a<br/>
difference in visual processing for the learner.<br/>
Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there ARE people with a genetic &quot;difference&quot; in the<br/>
processing...but there are also a lot of symptoms being caused by<br/>
their lame methods, where no real difference existed at all. The child<br/>
just needed more time and freedom.<br/>

&gt; Do you have an example of this Sandra? My circles tend not to use  <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s challenges as an excuse, and I&#39;m having a hard time  <br/>
&gt; imagining<br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>============================================================<br/>
<br/>
There was an example on this list, and I don&#39;t remember whose story  <br/>
it was.  I don&#39;t need to know who it was, so for those of you who  <br/>
know exactly who it was, I would very much prefer for you not to say  <br/>
&quot;it was me&quot; or &quot;her.&quot;  It shouldn&#39;t matter who it was.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said something like that she was proud of her son because he  <br/>
went to his [boss? leader-of-something?] and said that he was  <br/>
thus&#39;n&#39;such a way, and that meant he would be blunt and say what he  <br/>
thought and just tell the truth.*<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s short and I know that&#39;s a paraphrase.<br/>
<br/>
If a person knows enough to know that sometimes he says too much or  <br/>
says it impolitely or inappropriately, then saying &quot;I&#39;m going to do  <br/>
this because I can&#39;t help it,&quot; and expecting the other person to just  <br/>
live with tactlessness is using a condition/disability/syndrome as an  <br/>
excuse.  It was saying &quot;I must be excused for doing things that  <br/>
others would not do, or for what in others would be considered  <br/>
purposeful insubordination&quot; (or whatever--still in the paraphrase and  <br/>
example-mode).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I were a one-eyed driver and said &quot;Because I don&#39;t have binocular  <br/>
vision and I&#39;m not good at spatial reasoning, I will damage your  <br/>
truck and other vehicles more than your other employees do,&quot; that  <br/>
would be quite an unreasonable excuse.  Not everyone gets to drive.<br/>
<br/>
If a gambler told the landlord &quot;I will probably be behind on the  <br/>
rent, because I have a serious gambling problem, that would not be a  <br/>
good excuse.  Landlords make contracts with rentors<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems sometimes in discussions of children&#39;s special abilities or  <br/>
special needs, the parents confuse finding them opportunities to play  <br/>
and participate as children with some sort of lifelong license to  <br/>
participate &quot;equally&quot; forever.    And is seems sometimes that people  <br/>
confuse a school&#39;s requirement to provide services to every child in  <br/>
the school district with some imagined requirement of every neighbor  <br/>
and stranger to treat their child the same as that person would treat  <br/>
any other child.<br/>
<br/>
Some adults just won&#39;t like my children because they&#39;re quick to  <br/>
respond, they aren&#39;t as likely as some to say &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; they  <br/>
might sing rude songs, they wear smart-aleck t-shirts sometimes  <br/>
(often about homeschooling).  Lots of people like them.  Some people  <br/>
don&#39;t.  Some people would very likely prefer for them to stay away  <br/>
from their school-invested children who have to do homework and go to  <br/>
bed early or they might be grounded (etc....)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t dictate to other people how to respond to my children or how  <br/>
to treat my children.  If they were in public school, I could agitate  <br/>
for them to get special attention, but in the real world there&#39;s  <br/>
rarely anything resembling a special education department.  Maybe  <br/>
occupational therapists or social workers qualify in that way.<br/>
<br/>
And on a tangent from the star *, the idea that someone can just say  <br/>
&quot;I will tell the truth&quot;  can be an excuse.  Someone who&#39;s not good at  <br/>
knowing what&#39;s good to say when and to whom might want to consider  <br/>
that his perceptions might not be &quot;the truth&quot; every time.   &quot;It seems  <br/>
to me&quot; or &quot;I feel that...&quot; is generally a better way to preface a  <br/>
statement than &quot;I will tell you the truth.&quot;   &quot;I was just telling the  <br/>
truth&quot; doesn&#39;t cover over a difference of opinion or a need to  <br/>
understand that the other person in the situation might have a  <br/>
different perception and that his perception might be more objective,  <br/>
or more important.  It happens.<br/>

wouldn&#39;t.  I was just sharing ways in which a label<br/>
can be used positively.  The label Unschooler connects<br/>
people on this list, defines them partially in some<br/>
ways.  Labels are not big evil boogiemen if they are<br/>
not allowed to get bigger or more important than they<br/>
should be.  Labels can be very important tools, even<br/>
though they are defined (in the case of<br/>
medical/developmental labels) by someone else and are<br/>
imperfect ways to communicate an idea.  Words and<br/>
language are imperfect too for that matter, and maybe<br/>
direct brain to brain wordless sharing complete with<br/>
point of view and emotion and so forth would be the<br/>
only way to truly, really communicate fully.  Vulcan<br/>

try to use them to their potential.<br/>

happens to most unschooled &gt;kids and parents.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve seen this.  But with kids like mine, the<br/>
differences in behavior can be strong enough that even<br/>
other unschooling families are really weirded out and<br/>
judgemental about it unless they have a better<br/>
understanding of what they are dealing with.  Having<br/>
that sort of social background information that allows<br/>
you to know where the behaviors of another person are<br/>
coming from is really helpful, for them and for us. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter whether the behavior is a cultural<br/>
difference, a developmental difference or something<br/>
else.  There are not a lot of people in this world who<br/>
are flexible enough to just roll with radically<br/>
different stuff than they are used to without some<br/>
help assimilating and understanding it.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think looking for differences is less helpful on a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fortunately I wasn&#39;t looking for differences but was<br/>
just sharing information on a topic (Unschooling kids<br/>
who are &quot;atypical&quot;) that people were responding to<br/>
with interest.  Were I to refuse to acknowledge<br/>
however that my family do es have some challenges and<br/>
differences from *most* people I would not be doing<br/>
anyone any favors, least of all us.  It&#39;s not unusual<br/>
for kids with undiagnosed &quot;differences&quot; to be horribly<br/>
depressed and have a much harder time dealing with the<br/>
world, both because they don&#39;t understand why things<br/>
that come to others are so much harder for them and by<br/>
not being able to benefit from a whole world of<br/>
experienced folks who went before and can offer tools,<br/>
advice and assistance.  There are extremes to<br/>
everything of course and climbing into a label like a<br/>
new suit of skin isn&#39;t helpful either.  <br/>
<br/>
Would reinventing the wheel with unschooling all over<br/>
again in each and every family, rediscovering what<br/>
works, redefining what it is, standing alone against<br/>
the world feeling like the only unschooler on the<br/>
planet, and struggling with the bits that many others<br/>
before you had already solved and could offer great<br/>
assistance to you with, be better than gleaning from<br/>
the experience and knowledge of others on lists,<br/>
forums and in books?  People are all different and I<br/>
think that acknowledging and learning from those<br/>
differences is beneficial, at least as beneficial as<br/>
learning from our similarlities.  Not every child&#39;s<br/>
unschooling journey looks the same and those<br/>
differences add up to a lot of valuable information<br/>
for others, a goldmine of resources to draw from in my<br/>
opinion.  Different ways that different people<br/>
discover the same truths.  Just because my child&#39;s (or<br/>
my) behavior may or may not be something-or-other<br/>
that&#39;s typical of X-Y-Z label, doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
another parent couldn&#39;t learn something valuable for<br/>
their own unschooling journey from it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t understand why someone (can&#39;t remember<br/>
who, sorry!) pointing out in a previous post that<br/>
their husband had a problem that he was relieved to<br/>
find was associated with his functional developmental<br/>
differences (autism/aspergers I believe) made people<br/>
close up, shut off the potential for assosciating<br/>
themselves or connecting themselves with that<br/>
behavior.  They said something like &quot;Oh I really<br/>
realted to that, until that word was said...&quot;  Why was<br/>
that so scary and alien?  Why couldn&#39;t the other list<br/>
members still feel that connection to another human<br/>
who has a similar problem to themselves, but perhaps<br/>
for a different reason, and maybe to a different level<br/>
or degree?  <br/>
<br/>
Autism is often described as being mostly normal type<br/>
behaviors, but *more than* normal, more extreme, more<br/>
intense, etc.  Most of the behaviors could be found in<br/>
regular folks without autism, but not to the same<br/>
degree or extent.  That&#39;s the main defining<br/>
characteristic.  I&#39;m just curious, and learning from<br/>
this exploration of the emotions and ideas wrapped up<br/>
in these apparently powerful words.  I&#39;m not judging<br/>
anyone, in case it came out that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634465365"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Great example Pam! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No Kidding, what a tragedy.  Of course labels can be<br/>
misused and abused, like anything.  What&#39;s a label<br/>
anyway?  When does it go from being a piece of<br/>
potentially helpful information to a hurtful word? <br/>
Obviously the word &quot;label&quot; causes a visceral emotional<br/>
reaction for some people.<br/>
<br/>
This thread just keeps getting better.  I have been<br/>
soaking up all the stories from folks who were<br/>
&quot;labeled children.&quot;  Very interesting stuff.  I&#39;ve<br/>
often said that I am thankful that my kids have been<br/>
unschooled since birth and have escaped all those<br/>
school labels and aggressive interventions.  Thomas in<br/>
particular would have a ton of them.  They don&#39;t get<br/>
dragged around to many professionals to &quot;figure out<br/>
what&#39;s wrong with them&quot; nor do they get discussed in<br/>
terms of &quot;this is my (label) child.&quot;  I mainly handle<br/>
therapies myself when they are struggling with things<br/>
and need help.  <br/>
<br/>
Neither of them have ever said anything to the effect<br/>
of &quot;You have to be nice to me because I&#39;m special&quot; or<br/>
acted that way, nor do they think of themselves as<br/>
essentially different from other people that I can<br/>
tell at all.  In fact when they have a hard time (for<br/>
instance) with having appropriate behavior I let them<br/>
know that &quot;If something like this is hard for you<br/>
(doesn&#39;t matter why), that just means you have to work<br/>
harder to accomplish it, that doesn&#39;t excuse you from<br/>
doing it.&quot;  An example would be, not running and<br/>
screaming in a restaurant or store or climbing on the<br/>
shelving, etc.  They were doing this today (the<br/>
running, screaming, and climbing on the shelves) in a<br/>
store and after asking them to stop multiple times in<br/>
a 10 minute period I had to ask them to wait for me<br/>
outside because I was trying to get in line and leave<br/>
the store.  Just a reminder, they are 9 and almost 8. <br/>
Fortunately they could actually go outside where there<br/>
was a large pavement area and an empty bike rack thing<br/>
(big steel upside down U&#39;s coming out of the concrete)<br/>
to mess with and climb on and where I could see them<br/>
from the big glass doors of the store and was very<br/>
nearby.  It was a small store.  They asked to go with<br/>
me and they had their own money to get things and we<br/>
were not there that long, so it&#39;s not like I was<br/>
dragging them around on my boring errands or<br/>
something.  So we had to talk in the car about trying<br/>
harder to have appropriate behaviors, what ways I<br/>
could help them, how they could help me, and what was<br/>
and was not ok to do in a store, and then we tried<br/>
again at the little local toy shop they asked me to<br/>
take them to after that, to spend their nickels and<br/>
dimes.<br/>
<br/>
My boys certainly don&#39;t show any signs of depression<br/>
or image or self esteem problems.  They just joyfully<br/>
*ARE* and part of who they are happens to include<br/>
something that professional people like to call<br/>
autism, and which happens to affect multiple<br/>
generations of their family to some degree.  There&#39;s<br/>
nothing evil about it, any more than having redheads<br/>
in the family or being tall is evil.  It just is. <br/>
Sometimes it helps a lot though to know it, and to be<br/>
able to examine how it affects how we see and hear and<br/>
feel and react to things.  Helps a lot in fact.  It<br/>
does for me.  It helps me to know myself better, and<br/>
to not have as much anxiety about where my feelings<br/>
are coming from, and to be a better mom and spouse and<br/>
friend and to understand those weird &quot;neurologically<br/>
typical&quot; folks better. <br/>

enough to say he is sometimes impolite or inappropriate does not necessarily<br/>
AT ALL know right then how to make it NOT so. It shows that they at least<br/>
have that figured out. There is an assumption in the paragraph above that<br/>
this person was saying like, &quot;nah nah nah nah nah, I&#39;m this way and you have<br/>
to suffer for it.&quot; That may be how an observer perceived the situation. It<br/>
COULD be that the person was explaining a behavior that they are working on,<br/>
like I see my ds occasionally (very occasionally) do. When ds is in a<br/>
situation where he is having to explain that he can&#39;t help whatever he did,<br/>
or didn&#39;t mean whatever he did, he is usually mortified that he has gotten<br/>
in this position. Intense internal angst. He is trying to reach out to the<br/>
other person for some understanding. And he learns. And he moves forward<br/>
with another little piece that hopefully helps him next time.<br/>
<br/>
My husband talks about knowing that people would get pissed at him, and him<br/>
being SO clueless as to what he did wrong. Utilizing this label &quot;Asperger&#39;s&quot;<br/>
allowed them to unlock some major puzzle pieces for himself. We lived<br/>
without the labels for most of dh&#39;s and ds&#39;s lives, and only used the label<br/>
for information initially. But being able to say, &quot;I see your mad. Whatever<br/>
I did, I didn&#39;t mean to make you mad. What did I do?&quot; followed by &quot;I am<br/>
autistic and still learning certain social things. I&#39;m sorry to have<br/>
offended you.&quot; has made a huge difference in dh&#39;s life. No excuses, just<br/>
explanations.<br/>

Now they can at least say &quot;I am not an asshole. I am trying to learn this<br/>
stuff but it takes time. My heart is pure gold and if I do something to<br/>
offend you, please know it is not my intention&quot; because at least for my two<br/>
guys here, I have never seen them intentionally offend another person, or<br/>
want to be impolite. But that doesn&#39;t mean because they don&#39;t want to, they<br/>
automatically know how not to.<br/>
<br/>
Before the label, we had meetings with dh&#39;s co-workers to say, &quot;Hey look,<br/>
he&#39;s going to probably be more blunt than you are used to, but his intention<br/>
is to give you this information, not to offend you. Let him know if you are<br/>
feeling offended. He won&#39;t see it on his own&quot; along with telling them about<br/>
other seemingly &quot;inappropriate&quot; behaviors. They still got mad and assumed he<br/>
had complete control over it. *I* knew his struggle. He knew his struggle.<br/>
But others did not.<br/>
<br/>
It has been so much more effective to say, &quot;He is at the tail end of a long<br/>
life with autism. He&#39;s figured lots of things out socially, but every now<br/>
and then may say something that seems too blunt or offensive. Tell him when<br/>
that happens. He will probably immediately apologize and set it straight.&quot;<br/>
Which is what he does, and he ALWAYS feels bad when it happens. As does my<br/>
ds. They would NEVER arrogantly say, &quot;I have autism. I am rude. Deal with<br/>
it.&quot; They are mortified when they&#39;ve gotten themselves in situations like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Dh does not for a second lean on this label. Most information out there<br/>
about it gives great help with reducing the typical difficult symptoms,<br/>
which is often the goal. He has cognitively worked on this for years, and<br/>
maybe I&#39;m sheltered and naive about this, but I don&#39;t see our label<br/>
situation as being used as a crutch. That makes me think many others<br/>
probably aren&#39;t either.<br/>
<br/>
Just to move for a second to the positive, lest it sound like we focus on<br/>
this challenging stuff all the time, my two guys are amazing! Their amazing<br/>
creative writings, incredible inventive ideas, humor like no others in my<br/>
life...those are the things we typically focus on. These little challenges<br/>
are just part of an ever-evolving package.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, at least in how this is presented in the theory above, having<br/>
the label helped dh LESSEN being inappropriate and impolite.<br/>
<br/>
In the example I gave of my son in an earlier post, he said to his drama<br/>
teacher, &quot;&quot;Oh. You&#39;re probably wondering why I am so blunt about what I<br/>
think. You see, I am working on making that easier on people around me,...&quot;<br/>
that last part was a very important part of the sentence. He IS working on<br/>
making that easier on people around him. He&#39;s not sitting around saying &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
autistic and you guys are just going to have to deal with it. He WANTS to be<br/>
acceptable and polite to people.<br/>
<br/>
For Andrew, he sees with more clarity his impoliteness or inappropriateness<br/>
now than he ever did before he heard the word &quot;autism&quot;. And he&#39;s figuring<br/>
out what he is doing wrong and changing it. He doesn&#39;t like people pissed at<br/>
him. Who does? And while he learns how to get better and better at being<br/>
more &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;polite&quot; it is dang useful to give people a heads-up<br/>
when you start to see that they are getting confused about your behavior.<br/>
Hell, I&#39;m excited as a pig and poop that he even noticed that his drama<br/>
teacher was getting annoyed! That is a HUGE step for him...to notice WHEN<br/>
someone was getting irritated. And seeing that doesn&#39;t make his body then<br/>
become normal and act appropriate...it shows that SOMETHING he is doing is<br/>
bothering the other person...often not sure what...but to be able to<br/>
say...&quot;okay, I know something is wrong here, don&#39;t know exactly what it is,<br/>
but I am autistic and that is at least part of the problem&quot; IS helpful to<br/>
all involved. NOT an excuse. He WANTS to fix it. Can you imagine that<br/>
internal struggle? It is intense and filled with anxiety. It can be like<br/>
finding your way through an intricate gargantuan maze in the dark without a<br/>
flashlight.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If I were a one-eyed driver and said &quot;Because I don&#39;t have binocular<br/>
&gt;&gt;vision and I&#39;m not good at spatial reasoning, I will damage your<br/>
&gt;&gt;truck and other vehicles more than your other employees do,&quot; that<br/>
&gt;&gt;would be quite an unreasonable excuse.  Not everyone gets to drive.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you saying if you don&#39;t know how to communicate &quot;appropriately&quot;, as in<br/>
the way society has created thus far, you should not go into society? That&#39;s<br/>
what this analogy says to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If a gambler told the landlord &quot;I will probably be behind on the<br/>
&gt;&gt;rent, because I have a serious gambling problem, that would not be a<br/>
&gt;&gt;good excuse.  Landlords make contracts with rentors&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this is apples and oranges Sandra. A person with a neurological<br/>
condition is not doing something intentionally wrong, or breaking a<br/>
contract. In our situation, they are still figuring out what the damn<br/>
contract says!<br/>
<br/>
And if they are in the process of LEARNING how to cope and behave in<br/>
society, it makes sense that they let people know that. Let me tell you, my<br/>
husband would probably have given his right arm to not have gone through the<br/>
tortures of being an &quot;inappropriate&quot; person in this world. Your examples<br/>
only add to the lack of understanding and the intolerance of our society,<br/>
imho. Yes, we should all work toward treating each other well. AND yes some<br/>
people are way behind the curve in that area...(they are way ABOVE the curve<br/>
in other areas though...and my guess is that because they are so smart in<br/>
certain isolated areas [think Mozart, Einstein], their social development<br/>
suffers) but that is no excuse for US to not be understanding about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It seems sometimes in discussions of children&#39;s special abilities or<br/>
&gt;&gt;special needs, the parents confuse finding them opportunities to play<br/>
&gt;&gt;and participate as children with some sort of lifelong license to<br/>
&gt;&gt;participate &quot;equally&quot; forever.    And is seems sometimes that people<br/>
&gt;&gt;confuse a school&#39;s requirement to provide services to every child in<br/>
&gt;&gt;the school district with some imagined requirement of every neighbor<br/>
&gt;&gt;and stranger to treat their child the same as that person would treat<br/>
&gt;&gt;any other child.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When this happens, can you give an example? Talking in these generalities<br/>
has little meaning to me. I&#39;ve been talking about the real life things that<br/>
happen in my family. When you say something like this statement above, it is<br/>
clear to me that you are detached and distanced from the actual experience<br/>
of living with someone who is beyond the parameters of societal norms...NOT<br/>
public school norms...but society&#39;s norms. The kind of norms that keep<br/>
people able to work and live together well.<br/>
<br/>
This is part of why a list that has lots of people with this kind of<br/>
situation in their homes IS helpful...not to give excuses for behavior or<br/>
promote &quot;self-fulfilling prophecies&quot;, but to talk about our ACTUAL<br/>
experiences. Otherwise, it is often theory and assumptive and guesswork. And<br/>
can be SO non-understanding and, well, offensive, as I have found some of<br/>
this post to be.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I do think it is important to maintain an &quot;I can do anything&quot;<br/>
attitude no matter what &quot;condition&quot; one might have. That is a given in my<br/>
house. Being confined by a label is not helpful. My friend has a son who is<br/>
paralyzed from the waist down. Born with Cerebral Palsy. At age 11 he still<br/>
attends weekly physical therapy to keep his limbs healthy, but also to<br/>
continue working on walking. His label and diagnosis only help them get his<br/>
needs met...the labels do not make him or his parents think he&#39;ll never<br/>
walk, though that is what they are told.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;in the real world there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;rarely anything resembling a special education department.  Maybe<br/>
&gt;&gt;occupational therapists or social workers qualify in that way.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the real world there is the internet. YAY!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And on a tangent from the star *, the idea that someone can just say<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;I will tell the truth&quot;  can be an excuse.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are people who can not help themselves but to tell the truth. My<br/>
husband is one of them. To this day he often does not know when the truth<br/>
should or shouldn&#39;t be told. That is a skill that MOST of us have and SOME<br/>
of us don&#39;t. It is not something that is easy to learn if you don&#39;t have<br/>
that piece in your brain. Dh continues to try, but still gets very confused<br/>
about this...(&quot;Why wasn&#39;t I supposed to tell Sue that you didn&#39;t want to go<br/>
to her party? You said you didn&#39;t want to go.&quot; Or &quot;Why is she mad at me?<br/>
Because I said she smelled? She DID smell! Doesn&#39;t she want to know that?&quot;)<br/>
Very confusing. Literal, truthful life...what could be wrong with that? A<br/>
lot can end up being wrong with that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Someone who&#39;s not good at<br/>
&gt;&gt;knowing what&#39;s good to say when and to whom might want to consider<br/>
&gt;&gt;that his perceptions might not be &quot;the truth&quot; every time.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;It seems<br/>
&gt;&gt;to me&quot; or &quot;I feel that...&quot; is generally a better way to preface a<br/>
&gt;&gt;statement&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes a good suggestion that we&#39;ve figured out here. Softening the<br/>
sentences...it is a structured learning thing. And the more that you want<br/>
people to not be mad at you, the more you want to learn this and other<br/>
lessons.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;than &quot;I will tell you the truth.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well for us, dh and ds don&#39;t start their sentences that way...they just say<br/>
what they are thinking, or they answer a question. But it will be stated as<br/>
a statement, not as an opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&quot;I was just telling the<br/>
&gt;&gt;truth&quot; doesn&#39;t cover over a difference of opinion or a need to<br/>
&gt;&gt;understand that the other person in the situation might have a<br/>
&gt;&gt;different perception and that his perception might be more objective,<br/>
&gt;&gt;or more important.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is one of the pieces of learning that I&#39;ve seen happen<br/>
here...learning that the other person may think very differently. It takes a<br/>
kind of mental energy to go this distance (not for you or me, but definitely<br/>
for them). We see it, we do it. They WORK over time to understand this and<br/>
are at varying degrees of understanding it, and like many learned skills, it<br/>
can come and go. And in the meantime, it can be useful to say, &quot;I&#39;m autistic<br/>
and working on this.&quot;<br/>

so much why he CAN&#39;T do something. But why he is the way he is in this<br/>

on that one since he had an interest in people. And it is very much a<br/>

<br/>
I do hate though to talk about other people&#39;s remote situation though, and<br/>
judge without knowing much about it, as with the girl in the pool. Maybe<br/>
that was the only time it happened. Maybe she was playing with some ideas<br/>
she&#39;d been exposed to. Maybe she was screaming for those girls to set her<br/>
straight and tell her to cut it out. Maybe she was terrified that she really<br/>
did have special needs and she wanted those girls to verify that she didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I think of the things my kids have said and done in isolated situations over<br/>
the years, and there would be no way an unknowing group of emailers could<br/>
have enough information to make judgments about it.<br/>

beneficially to their potential for our children.<br/>

&gt;&gt;with interest.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>

differences? Celebrating the differences? Recognizing and helping with the<br/>
challenges? It would shortchange our children otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It&#39;s not unusual<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Nanci, I&#39;m so glad you brought this up. My dh was deeply depressed for a<br/>
long time. He started to come around when he found information that helped<br/>
him understand himself better. I really meant it when I said it completely<br/>
turned his life around. We shared this label with ds Andrew when he was<br/>
deeply depressed. What a difference it made for him.<br/>

&gt;&gt;that so scary and alien?  Why couldn&#39;t the other list<br/>
&gt;&gt;members still feel that connection to another human<br/>
&gt;&gt;who has a similar problem to themselves, but perhaps<br/>
&gt;&gt;for a different reason, and maybe to a different level<br/>
&gt;&gt;or degree?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well that was certainly my response as well to those posts, but I was a<br/>
little too close to the situation to feel comfortable responding about it.<br/>
We all have different tendencies at varying degrees which makes us more<br/>
alike than different. However when it strongly negatively impacts one&#39;s<br/>
life, it may be more than more typical tendencies.<br/>
<br/>
I would love for people to see that reacting negatively to a label only<br/>
continues a negative stigma. Kinda like the stigma some carry about<br/>
unschoolers. No need to disconnect because one unschools.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the desire to end all labels, and maybe that is where the<br/>
disconnect came. If you think labels are bad, when one is associated with<br/>
behaviors you have, then suddenly disconnecting makes sense. But we aren&#39;t<br/>
talking about labels...we are talking about people.<br/>
<br/>
We can individually decide that a label will or will not cause a disconnect<br/>
with another person. If we&#39;re talking about a person, what difference does<br/>
it make that they choose to utilize a label to help them in their lives?<br/>

when they speak, and are not aware that the other person has been offended <br/>
unless that person tells them, and then they really don&#39;t understand <br/>
why.  Although they can be coached to say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I hurt your feelings, <br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to.&quot; they usually really don&#39;t ever get why the person was <br/>
offended.<br/>
<br/>
When Aaron was younger and we would go to restaurants that had play areas <br/>
or to the playground, on the way there he would be so excited with <br/>
anticipation of playing in the tubes or on the equipment with the other <br/>
children there.  He would already have a game going in his head, and he <br/>
would already be in character when we arrived.<br/>
<br/>
He would enter the play area and start roaring like a dinosaur.  He would <br/>
have his fingers crooked like a T-rex&#39;s forelegs and be roaring at these <br/>
other children and run right up to them.  On two different occasions he got <br/>
punched in the face by slightly older boys who didn&#39;t appreciate being <br/>
&quot;attacked&quot; by a strange kid.   He never connected the way he approached <br/>
these children with the punches, though.   Even after it being explained to <br/>
him in various ways.  Even after the second time it happened.<br/>
<br/>
It took lots of coaching on my part for many months, lots of &quot;briefing&quot; <br/>
about how to approach the children at the playground each time on the way <br/>
to the place, before he would go up to them and say, &quot;I&#39;m Aaron.  Would you <br/>
like to pretend to be a dinosaur with me?&quot;  For a long time I had to be <br/>
right there next to him, and do it for him, because he couldn&#39;t even break <br/>
out of his dinosaur mode to do it himself.<br/>
<br/>
He still thinks it is really weird that he has to do it that way.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t really get that other people are not thinking the exact same things <br/>
he is.<br/>
<br/>
Aaron still makes animal noises rather than answer people&#39;s questions if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t understand what they are saying.  Even a, &quot;How did you like the <br/>
movie?&quot; is sometimes way too general a question and he will just look at <br/>
them and quack.  We&#39;re still working on that one.<br/>

Being right there, helping Aaron to negotiate the playground etiquette, was <br/>
really important when he was younger, as I posted before.   Once we <br/>
realized he lacked that intuitive way of connecting with other kids, and <br/>
needed more help to initiate play, it was really imperative that I be right <br/>
next to him for the beginning.   For a long while I had to do the <br/>
initiating and introductions and invitation to play for him.  Now I can <br/>
just coach him before we walk over from the car.  Someday I might not even <br/>
have to do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195560162">Do you (hypothetical public at large &quot;you&quot; being used here) know why <br/>
autism is so little understood and has such a lot of confusion <br/>
around it?  I think it&#39;s largely because people who are <br/>
neurologically typical have a very hard time wrapping their minds <br/>
around the very different place that autistics are coming from.  <br/>
There is a general public perception that they could be just like <br/>
everyone else if they wanted to be.  Trying to understand that what <br/>
comes easily to most (like learning social behaviors by natural <br/>
modeling, or relating to others in a normal human/primate social <br/>
way) is not easy at all for autistics must be really tough.  That&#39;s <br/>
why it&#39;s called a &quot;Social Disorder&quot; often.  If we really were <br/>
chimpanzees or something we autistics would probably be driven out <br/>
or beaten to death or something for our social failings.<br/>
<br/>
Autistics have a very hard time understanding that other people may <br/>
not think what they think.  They/We have a very hard time reading <br/>
body language and responding appropriately.  Autistics generally <br/>
have a very hard time dissembling or knowing what &quot;not to say.&quot;  <br/>
They often fall apart in stress and do the exact opposite of <br/>
something helpful to the situation.  Stress can be translated as <br/>
something as simple as the checker asks you something while you are <br/>
trying to write a check and then a car honks loudly and your <br/>
children start fighting.  That&#39;s enough to make me turn &quot;deer in the <br/>
headlights&quot; forget how to write a check or write my own name, not <br/>
register anything I am hearing (people talking sounds like &quot;Bla, bla <br/>
bla bla bla..blablablablablabla&quot; sensory input starts flashing, I <br/>
forget what I am doing and I just want everything to stop for about <br/>
30 seconds so that I can reset.  <br/>
<br/>
Does knowing all this mean that I can automatically correct it?  <br/>
God, don&#39;t I wish!!  I work hard at it, but I still sometimes go to <br/>
bed at night mentally berating myself for doing and saying &quot;wrong&quot; <br/>
things.  I ask those around me, friends and loved ones, if I am <br/>
doing or saying the appropriate things, or if I have responded <br/>
appropriately.  Knowing that there is a disconnect helps me to <br/>
understand myself better, and to find helpful information on how to <br/>
change this, and to find people who are supportive and <br/>
undertstanding and helpful to this process.  An Autistic will never <br/>
*not* be autistic, but they can learn (slowly, methodically) how to <br/>
deal with different things in life.<br/>
<br/>
Autistics often work in their lives from a script, a learned set of <br/>
cause and effect actions or step by step actions.  When life <br/>
deviates from the script it can be very upsetting.  A lot of <br/>
learning to cope with the world of other people for an autistic is <br/>
learning fallback scripts (alternate emergency contingencies) for <br/>
dealing with when the script fails.  <br/>
<br/>
A lot of learning to cope with the world in a non-social way is <br/>
learning coping mechanisms for various physical needs or challenges, <br/>
like sensory integration problems.  An example:  Thomas needs to <br/>
close his eyes and splay his fingers and make a certain noise in the <br/>
back of his throat while I brush his teeth in order to tone down his <br/>
tongue seeking to aggressivley eject the toothbrush from his mouth <br/>
as a sensory defense.  It took a lot of work to get to this point in <br/>
teeth brushing and for some reason that set of stims (behaviors to <br/>
help self sooth during stimulation) allow him to barely tolerate <br/>
teeth brushing.  He wants to brush his teeth, by the way, it&#39;s not <br/>
us forcing him against his will.  That works for now, mostly, but he <br/>
will eventually need to learn other coping strategies to make it <br/>
possible for him to brush his teeth on his own.  Thomas also has <br/>
motor delays and so he has a lot of trouble using silverware still.  <br/>
Even soup is mostly eaten with his hands.  Mostly that&#39;s ok at home <br/>
and he rarely eats anywhere else, but we have to encourage him to <br/>
use napkins so he isn&#39;t wearing most of his food every day and we <br/>
make a daily practice of trying to model better table manners and <br/>
encourage him to practice improving.  He doesn&#39;t want to gross his <br/>
friends out, but sometimes he does and is mortified by it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A person who knows enough to say he is sometimes impolite or <br/>
&gt;inappropriate does not necessarily AT ALL know right then how to <br/>
&gt;make it NOT so. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bingo.  They know they are sometimes impolite because other people <br/>
have told them so, and other people have gotten upset with them for <br/>
it.  They don&#39;t know it because they see it when it happens.  They <br/>
don&#39;t see it.  They are warning others because they want to avoid <br/>
ugly scenes again, which generally distress the autistics more than <br/>
the people they have offended.  They are also warning others because <br/>
they want to learn, they are working on it, and they want people to <br/>
like them and to like people in return.  They are giving people a <br/>
chance to give them the benefit of the doubt and say &quot;Hey, maybe I <br/>
am misunderstanding what you are saying, but that sounds offensive <br/>
in this way...etc&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;I see your mad. Whatever I did, I didn&#39;t mean to make you mad. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>What did I do?&quot; followed by &quot;I am autistic and still learning <br/>
certain social things. I&#39;m sorry to have offended you.&quot; has made a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;huge difference in dh&#39;s life. No excuses, just explanations.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, just like that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But that doesn&#39;t mean because they don&#39;t want to, they <br/>
&gt;automatically know how not to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right exactly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you saying if you don&#39;t know how to <br/>
&gt;communicate &quot;appropriately&quot;, as in the way society has created thus <br/>
 </span></blockquote>far, you should not go into society? That&#39;s what this analogy says <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too, I don&#39;t understand that analogy.  It&#39;s hard to learn if <br/>
we&#39;re not allowed to try.  Lots of people don&#39;t like us and reject <br/>
us because they don&#39;t understand us.  That hurts but it&#39;s reality <br/>
and I live with it.  But we still try every day to learn to move <br/>
through society better.  I try hard to not be offensive and to <br/>
handle things better.  I have strict scripts about what it means to <br/>
be a good host, be a good guest, be a good driver, be a good <br/>
citizen, be a good friend, be a good camper, etc. and I get really <br/>
upset when other people don&#39;t fulfill their roles in that or don&#39;t <br/>
live up to those standards.  That&#39;s an autistic black and white view <br/>
and I try to be more flexible about it than I used to be, and accept <br/>
other people&#39;s differing definitions of those roles.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A person with a neurological condition is not doing something <br/>
&gt;intentionally wrong, or breaking a contract.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Let me tell you, my husband would probably have given his right <br/>
&gt;arm to not have gone through the tortures of being <br/>
&gt;an &quot;inappropriate&quot; person in this world. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I feel that hurt.  I won&#39;t dwell on this past or it will make me <br/>
hurt about things gone and not live in the now, but I so totally <br/>
understand wht it means to be an inappropriate person in the world <br/>
despite all the effort you can give.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To this day he often does not know when the truth should or <br/>
&gt;shouldn&#39;t be told. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just in recent years finally *groked* the idea that there are <br/>
truths that should not be told.  It hit me like a brick wall one <br/>
day, stunningly and with finality.  I still struggle with which <br/>
things qualify in which situations for this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes a good suggestion that we&#39;ve figured out here. Softening the<br/>
&gt; sentences...it is a structured learning thing. And the more that <br/>
&gt;you want people to not be mad at you, the more you want to learn <br/>
&gt;this and other lessons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I learned this on the internet.  I didn&#39;t understand what people <br/>
meant when they said I was &quot;stating my opinions like facts&quot; or why <br/>
people got upset with me or said I &quot;thought I knew everything&quot; or <br/>
that I acted like I was always right.  God, I feel like I know <br/>
nothing, not everything!  I constantly question myself, and change <br/>
ideas and listen to what other people say.  I learn from everyone <br/>
around me, or try to.  How could they get such a wrong opinion of <br/>
me?!  I learned to try to soften my language (still forget sometimes <br/>
as Sandra reminded me in that recent post.)   I understand now that <br/>
my written, and sometimes my spoken voice, can be pendantic and seem <br/>
preachy.  I learned that what I am really doing is verbally stimming <br/>
and processing and that I am repetitive while I do this <br/>
(particularly in spoken language) and am learning to do this under <br/>
my breath instead of out loud because other people find it annoying <br/>
or worse.  I learned that I have a tendancy to analyze people and <br/>
life in general in my attempt to understand them, generally outloud <br/>
(oops!)  This is not polite or preferrable either I now understand, <br/>
so I am trying consciously not to do this.  By the way that&#39;s <br/>
something I learned from my neice Nicole.  I have a hard time just <br/>
listening and not offering my thoughts and opinions, and I realize <br/>
they are not always wanted and that listening is sometimes all that <br/>
is wanted and needed.  Even a friend with a problem may not want to <br/>
hear my possible solutions and I need to remember to ask before I <br/>
offer them.  This is added to my script then listening to friends <br/>
problems:  Ask before offering advice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...learning that the other person may think very differently. It <br/>
&gt;takes a kind of mental energy to go this distance <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh boy does it...<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can come and go.<br/>

&quot;Into society&quot; is a really big place, and there are parts that  <br/>

If people can&#39;t even look at what problems might look like, we can&#39;t  <br/>

in other areas though...and my guess is that because they are so  <br/>
smart in<br/>
certain isolated areas [think Mozart, Einstein], their social  <br/>

suffers) but that is no excuse for US to not be understanding about  <br/>
it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not every single person is way above the curve in some area.  This  <br/>
sounds like rhetoric and platitude.<br/>
Where natural learning is concerned the curve isn&#39;t an issue.  Where  <br/>
unschooling is concerned it doesn&#39;t matter if someone somewhere  <br/>
considers a child to be gifted or better or worse than some other  <br/>
child or group of children.<br/>
It does not matter.<br/>
<br/>

situation in their homes IS helpful...not to give excuses for  <br/>
behavior or<br/>
promote &quot;self-fulfilling prophecies&quot;, but to talk about our ACTUAL<br/>
experiences. Otherwise, it is often theory and assumptive and  <br/>
guesswork. And<br/>
can be SO non-understanding and, well, offensive, as I have found  <br/>
some of<br/>
this post to be.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was asked to explain why I made the statement that some use it as  <br/>

anything&quot;<br/>
attitude no matter what &quot;condition&quot; one might have. That is a given  <br/>

house.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Rather than claim that one can do anything, I try to go with each  <br/>
child&#39;s interests, talents and abilities and help them do things they  <br/>
really find interesting and doable.    &quot;Anything&quot; creates a huge  <br/>
field of potential failure.  If a kid with bad eyesight wants to be a  <br/>
test pilot, parents will do him a disservice by saying &quot;you can do  <br/>
anything.&quot;  He might like video game flight simulators; he might like  <br/>
research on corrective eye surgery.  There are tons of related  <br/>
things.   A narrow goal creates more failure than a broad goal.<br/>
<br/>
There is American mythology that says all men are created equal.   <br/>
That is not literally true.  It is poetically true.  It is, in  <br/>
contrast to the 18th century view of layers of society and classes of  <br/>
people, a radical and beautiful idea, but even those who wrote it  <br/>
meant all white male land-owners, not just every human who&#39;s born or  <br/>

Why does it have to be &quot;a structured learning thing&quot;?  The principle  <br/>
of qualified statements being potentially true while absolute  <br/>

without the structure.  That&#39;s internally structured that I mean, not <br/>
classroom structured, not schoolish structure.  The structured <br/>
environment of mailing lists are what taught me that very principle of <br/>

but I have to get to bed now.  I hope this is not considered too off <br/>
topic or contentious.  One of the reasons I think there is a lack of <br/>
understanding about autism is that it&#39;s not alright to discuss it <br/>
anywhere but among autism &quot;groups&quot; or similar forums, where they <br/>
already know what youknow and there isn&#39;t anyone there who isn&#39;t <br/>
already touched by it in their lives.  That doesn&#39;t help.  I would <br/>
like to think that discussing the different ways neurology can vary <br/>
and lead to these different issues among how people percieve things <br/>
and react to things and interact with each other is a topic that can <br/>
be looked at in a lot of ways and have positive repercussions on an <br/>
unschooling journey and spin off into other topics.<br/>
