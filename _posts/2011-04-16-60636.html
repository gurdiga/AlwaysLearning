<div id="ygrps-yiv-478072792">&quot;TV Turnoff Week is April 18-24. To help you unplug the electronics and plug in to your family, Chinaberry offers outstanding toys, books, and family activities. May we all discover the rewards of a TV-free lifestyle this week!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If they call that a week,&quot; Holly said.   Monday to Sunday.  She said something about how they would be counting, and I said &quot;And they WILL be counting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good deal for a catalog company to sell thing to the family, but I hope everyone here already has fun things to do in addition to (rather than instead of) TV.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said &quot;I don&#39;t have a TV in my room.  I have a DVD player and a Roku.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Screen time!&quot; Keith and I both said.   <br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t turn it on every day.   The last time I watched a TV show, I watched it on an iPad, just because i could.  And because I could carry it around with me while I cleaned the kitchen and fed wood into the hot tub fire, and that seemed decadently cool.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who has missed anti-TV rhetoric, here&#39;s my own collection:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/anti">http://sandradodd.com/t/anti</a><br/>
OH, HOLD ON.  I was just there checking links, and the Waldorf link is gone.  That site no longer has an anti-TV link (or not that one, anyway), and they disallowed it to be archived at the Wayback Machine.    So I went to look for another waldorf link and found two odd things.  A checklist of things parents should ask teachers at a school  (at a Waldorf school?  Unclear, and I need to go work in the yard with Keith)...   including this fascinating subset:<br/>
Is it possible that a being called Ahriman is present in electronic media?<br/>
Questions about different kinds of electronic media activites:<br/>
Is it OK if I print web pages, and read them to my child like a book?<br/>
Is it OK if I allow my child to watch home videos of family and friends? Can my child view images from my digital camera on a computer screen?<br/>
Is it OK if I allow my child to use email to keep in touch with close family members who are geographically distant?<br/>
Is it OK if my child listens to recorded music or stories? Can my child listen to the radio at home or in the car?<br/>
Is it OK if my child talks on a cell phone?<br/>
Is it OK if I use my own judgement with electronic media from time-to-time, based on special circumstances?<br/>
If my child mentioned a TV show, movie or video game, how would the teacher handle that?<br/>
I looked up &quot;Ahriman.&quot;  A devil.  Persian word.   A Zoroastrian devil!?  <br/>
<br/>
ARE there people claiming that &quot;electronic media&quot; will summon a devil!?<br/>
But even more insane, are their parents asking &quot;experts&quot; (Waldorf teachers?) whether it&#39;s okay if a child watches a home video of her cousin, or talks to her grandmother on a cellphone, or listens to music IN A STORE?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m half amused, half stunned/offended, and going to go and work in the yard to recover.<br/>

conditions of attending a Waldorf school is no TV, no computer, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think the questions aren&#39;t intended to be parenting questions but  <br/>
how much leeway the school permits. So the question isn&#39;t &quot;Is it okay  <br/>
for the child?&quot; but &quot;Will that be breaking the school rules?&quot; if the  <br/>
child talks at school to the other kids about having done one of those  <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like asking a public school how much flak you&#39;ll get for taking  <br/>
your child out for a week&#39;s vacation in the middle of the school year.<br/>

<br/>
There most absolutely are. I know a handful or more of such parents. And the <br/>
craziest part is that these parents are all very bright, thinking people.<br/>
<br/>
One friend of mine, a successful multimedia artist and art academy instructor, <br/>
attended a parent class at a local (to me, SF Bay Area) Waldorf school where she <br/>
was hoping to send her, then, 3 year old son.  She asked the teacher if it was <br/>
okay for her son to use a camera, as my friend often gave him one of her cameras <br/>
to use while she was doing art/work.  The teacher was very adamant that a young <br/>
child should never see the world through a camera lens as it disrupts their <br/>
natural development, awakening the child too early.  The teacher was also, <br/>
according to my friend, opposed to young children using black colored crayons, <br/>
and never ever markers, pens or pencils of any color. I wonder if devils come <br/>
from these also? I had actually not heard/read that before (and I have read <br/>
quite a bit of Steiner&#39;s work); maybe I missed/overlooked it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107283978">***ARE there people claiming that &quot;electronic media&quot; will summon a devil!?***<br/>
<br/>
That seems to be a Waldorf thing based on some writing by Rudolf Steiner.   (no surprise there)   I found this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.openwaldorf.com/media.html">http://www.openwaldorf.com/media.html</a><br/>
<br/>
If you scroll down a bit you&#39;ll find a section titled &quot;Ahriman and Television&quot; and an excerpt from Rudolf Steiner&#39;s &quot;The Ahrimanic Deception.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;...the Ahrimanic influence has been at work since the middle of the fifteenth century and will increase in strength until and actual incarnation of Ahriman takes place among Western humanity.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is characteristic of such things that they are prepared long in advance.  Ahrimanic powers prepare the evolution of mankind in such a way that it can fall a prey to Ahriman when he appears in human form within Western civilization - hardly then to be called &quot;civilization&quot; in our sense - as once Lucifer appeared in human form in China, as once Christ appeared in human form in Asia Minor.  It is of no avail to give oneself illusions today about these things.  Ahriman will appear in human form and the only question is, how will he find humanity prepared.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a link there but it doesn&#39;t work, but I found this other link (lucky you!)   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.doyletics.com/arj/tadrvw.htm">http://www.doyletics.com/arj/tadrvw.htm</a>   which will put you on a collision course with wackiness.    Since Steiner wrote this masterpiece in 1919 I&#39;m guessing the injection of Ahriman into computers happened later, tricky devil, with the help of some other brilliant prophet.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124735097">*****But even more insane, are their parents asking &quot;experts&quot; (Waldorf<br/>
teachers?) whether it&#39;s okay if a child watches a home video of her<br/>

IN A STORE?*****<br/>
<br/>
When my son was 2, we tried a &quot;Mom and Me&quot; program at our local<br/>
Waldorf school.  We lasted exactly one meeting before we became<br/>
Waldorf-school dropouts :-)  We hadn&#39;t realized when we enrolled how<br/>
very restrictive some of their ideas and policies are  once we<br/>
realized, we knew it wasn&#39;t for us at ALL.<br/>
<br/>
This is an excerpt from their media policy (as set forth in their parent<br/>
handbook).  Thought folks might find it interesting <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The debilitating effects of media on children&#39;s developing<br/>
capacities are increasingly apparent to us, and are well documented by<br/>
independent researchers. By &quot;media&quot; we mean the full array of<br/>
visual and aural electronic devices, including, but not limited to<br/>
videos, DVDs, video games, CD walkman units, computers, computer games,<br/>
television and radio. Of equal concern are large-screen movies, whether<br/>
in the theater or at home. We fully recognize the prevalence of media in<br/>
our culture and the need that many adults have for this in their<br/>
vocation and leisure time. We must also recognize, however, that the<br/>
adult has the ability to absorb and consciously process these<br/>
experiences. This a child cannot yet do.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We find that Waldorf Education works best with children who experience<br/>
little or no media at all. We strongly urge the elimination of all media<br/>
in the kindergarten through fifth grade, and ideally through eighth<br/>
grade. The teachers of these grades will provide recommendations about<br/>
how to carry this out and develop alternate activities for the children.<br/>
As the children get older, it may be increasingly difficult to protect<br/>
them completely from media exposure: their experiences become more<br/>
varied and the influence of the peer culture strengthens. We will work<br/>
with parents to bring some of the forms of media to the older students<br/>
in a healthy way, to educate them in being knowledgeable, productive,<br/>
and discerning users of media in our world.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When children are actively and imaginatively engaged with the natural<br/>
world, they experience the joy of their own energy. Their energy soon<br/>
becomes will power, self-discipline and ultimately, self-direction. With<br/>
a will, they apply themselves to all artistic endeavors-the music that<br/>
soothes the soul, the painting that nourishes it, or the drawing that<br/>
enlivens it. They apply themselves equally to the precise observation so<br/>
essential to middle school sciences and mathematics, and the habit of<br/>
clear thinking in all academics. Children&#39;s thinking also becomes<br/>
mobile and imaginative: their capacity for living vividly into the<br/>
stories and biographies they hear becomes the capacity of empathy for<br/>
their fellow humans in adulthood. As adults too, they become<br/>
independent, creative individuals, feeling at home in the world. Seen in<br/>
this light, it is not so much a matter of avoiding media, as it is one<br/>
of simply allowing the natural capacities of children to unfold.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some children are highly sensitive to media influence and cannot leave<br/>
it at home, but bring it into the classroom in their play. This in turns<br/>
changes the nature of the play for many children in the class, rather<br/>
than out of their own inner needs they re-enact the disturbing or<br/>
violent images they have seen or heard about. Should this become a<br/>
recurring problem, the classroom teacher may call for a parent<br/>
conference. If the situation does not reach a resolution the family may<br/>
be asked to leave the class as a last resort.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably. I read a story a couple of years ago on a local parenting list where many of the parents believe TV is evil (a lot go to a Waldorf school) that the parents get calls from the school about how many hours a child is watching TV.  The teacher claimed she could tell that the child had been watching TV by things he was saying in school and that meant the parents were violating the agreement they had with the school.  The school would basically tell the parents what the child could and couldn&#39;t do during off school hours and while at home.  <br/>

That one didn&#39;t even make sense.  They &quot;live vividly&quot; into a story?  It doesn&#39;t make grammatical sense.<br/>

What on earth would it be that their thinking also becomes &quot;mobile&quot;?<br/>

The emperor&#39;s new clothes.  If they use mysterious and hoity-sounding phrases, parents will not mind so much giving them cash, and changing their own lives.     If they started right off talking about &quot;the Ahrimanic influence,&quot;  they might not be making so much money.<br/>
<br/>
After years of occasional &quot;I&#39;ll show you my crazy Waldorf story if you&#39;ll show me yours,&quot; I had never yet run across &quot;Ahriman.&quot;  I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not the only spook in their closet.<br/>

Well I can&#39;t have any part of a religion that doesn&#39;t support the eating of potatoes.<br/>
<br/>
And they are, in some places, taking government money as charter schools.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should organize a potato-centric alternative school.  I would require that parents have as many screens in the house as people, and watch at least two hilarious movies or TV re-runs per week, as a family.   We could have TV Turn-On Week!  If I found a child who didn&#39;t understand basic references to popular culture, I would call for a parent conference, a la this:<br/>

Resort!  Yeah.  If they won&#39;t watch TV together, I would require that they go to a resort, as a family.  Good idea!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301296663">My daughter went to a Waldorf kindergarten for a couple of months. We choose that school because in the Netherlands homeschool is a very difficult option (only 330 children get it) and it was the school where there was the most outside play (my daughter loves to be outside). She loved to paint, draw etc , but within two months she stopped painting and drawing. I didn&#39;t notice it so much but when I asked her on a rainy sunday if we could paint together she said: I can&#39;t paint because I&#39;m not yet 5 years old. In the school they allowed children only to use paint when they were 5, starting with only yellow. It made me so angry, it took her more than half a year to start painting again.<br/>

&gt;-=-As the children get older, it may be increasingly difficult to protect<br/>
&gt;them completely from media exposure: their experiences become more<br/>
&gt;varied and the influence of the peer culture strengthens.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Protect them.<br/>
&gt;Maybe not completely.<br/>
&gt;But their intent is to protect them completely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-...their experiences become more<br/>
&gt;varied and the influence of the peer culture strengthens.-=--=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The influence of the peer culture strenghtens&quot; because the child gets older and WANTS and needs to BE a part of the world outside his or her own little family (or own little classroom/school). <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-Their energy soon becomes will power, self-discipline and ultimately, self-direction. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But until that time, they will be directed by the Waldorf school.  Twenty-four hours a day.  Their parents will be, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=. Children&#39;s thinking also becomes<br/>
&gt;mobile and imaginative: their capacity for living vividly into the<br/>
&gt;stories and biographies they hear becomes the capacity of empathy for<br/>
&gt;their fellow humans in adulthood.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That one didn&#39;t even make sense.  They &quot;live vividly&quot; into a story?  It doesn&#39;t make grammatical sense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Their thinking *becomes* imaginative? <br/>
&gt;What on earth would it be that their thinking also becomes &quot;mobile&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The emperor&#39;s new clothes.  If they use mysterious and hoity-sounding phrases, parents will not mind so much giving them cash, and changing their own lives.     If they started right off talking about &quot;the Ahrimanic influence,&quot;  they might not be making so much money.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After years of occasional &quot;I&#39;ll show you my crazy Waldorf story if you&#39;ll show me yours,&quot; I had never yet run across &quot;Ahriman.&quot;  I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s not the only spook in their closet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327848325">Apparently you aren&#39;t supposed to mention Ahriman early on, according to the <br/>
link that Deb sent (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.doyletics.com/arj/tadrvw.htm)">http://www.doyletics.com/arj/tadrvw.htm)</a>. You are supposed <br/>
to go through the three stages first and then you get to Ahriman. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;Why don&#39;t you just tell them the truth?&quot; some well-meaning person might ask. <br/>
Steiner minces no words when he answers that question. <br/>
<br/>
[page 7] People nowadays flee the truth, and one cannot give it to them in an <br/>
unvarnished form because they would ridicule it and scoff and jeer. But if one <br/>
gives it to them through the &quot;Threefold Social Organism&quot; as one now tries to do, <br/>
then they will not have it either — not the majority, at any rate. The fact that <br/>
people reject these things is just one of the means which the Ahrimanic powers <br/>
can use and which will give Ahriman the greatest possible following when he <br/>
appears in human form on earth.&quot;<br/>
It reminds me of a piece in the New Yorker about Paul Haggis, a Scientologist <br/>
apostate. It&#39;s a very long article, the bit I&#39;m thinking about is this: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;“The process of induction is so long and slow that you really do  convince <br/>
yourself of the truth of some of these things that don’t make  sense,” Haggis <br/>
told me. Although he refused to specify the contents of  O.T. materials, on the <br/>
ground that it offended Scientologists, he said,  “If they’d sprung this stuff <br/>
on me when I first walked in the door, I  just would have laughed and left right <br/>
away.” But by the time Haggis  approached the O.T. III material he’d already <br/>
been through several years  of auditing. His wife was deeply involved in the <br/>
church, as was his  sister Kathy. Moreover, his first writing jobs had come <br/>
through  Scientology connections. He was now entrenched in the community. <br/>
Success  stories in the Scientology magazine Advance! added an aura of  reality <br/>
to the church’s claims. Haggis admits, “I was looking forward to  enhanced <br/>
abilities.” Moreover, he had invested a lot of money in the  program. The <br/>
incentive to believe was high.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s part of why Waldorf keeps media from children, to make them more <br/>
committed to believing than they might otherwise be. It seems to me that any <br/>
system that is about closing avenues of information is about limiting critical <br/>
thinking. <br/>

I have that book.  Some days I have taken prozac AND potatoes. :-)<br/>

Every two or three years I have a bout of depression.  I&#39;m glad it&#39;s not more often than that.  It&#39;s probably that it WOULD be more often than that, if I weren&#39;t involved daily in a focus on fun, joy and playfulness.<br/>

Being an artist, their approach to creativity gave me the creeps, and so it was no longer an option.  Thankfully, I learned about unschooling, and began broadening our horizons, instead of limiting them.  <br/>
