<div id="ygrps-yiv-444711860">My friend Sue just called me to see if everything was OK at my house.  <br/>
Sue lives out in the boonies and had to drive sixteen miles to find a<br/>
phone, just to call. <br/>
<br/>
She heard from our mutual friend Karen, who&#39;s daughter is interested in,<br/>
and studying math right now. (Lindsey&#39;s 14 and went to college last year.<br/>
 She liked it and thinks she&#39;d like to take a few classes this year too) <br/>
 Karen told Sue she was going to give us her math book when she&#39;s<br/>
finished with it. <br/>
<br/>
Sue had to call and see if I&#39;d lost my mind or something.  She said &quot;Is<br/>
everything OK?  I heard you were getting a math book!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!  Big trouble at the Lewis house if they&#39;re getting SCHOOL books!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love unschoolers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Maybe she thought you had had a debilitating stroke or you were starting to <br/>
drink heavily or maybe had some of those alien brain-parasites.  (I saw some on <br/>
TV, so It Must Be True.)<br/>
