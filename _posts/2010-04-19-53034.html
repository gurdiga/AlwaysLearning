<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072706975">Is that an oxymoron? I&#39;m wondering how unschooling works, if it applies at all, once your child has become a legal adult. At 18 or 19 or 20, do they continue to unschool, hanging out at home, maybe working but maybe not or are there more expectations? Would you expect your late teen, early 20s child to work or go to college or would it be ok if they hung out at home and unschooled for a few more years? If you do have expectations that they work and/or go to college but they don&#39;t or won&#39;t, what would you do?<br/>

I think most people are biologically designed to leave the nest and go and do and be.  Some kids can&#39;t or won&#39;t.  Margaux and I watched a &quot;This American Life&quot; segment about a person with spinal muscular atrophy.  This person wanted more than anything in the world to lead an independent life and he couldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So, what would a kid look like if they were 20 or 25 and unable, or for whatever reason unwilling, to leave the nest?  Would it be much different from a kid who had a disability preventing them from doing so?<br/>
<br/>
This is a hypothetical situation.  Even the kids that I know of that are unschooled who live at home and they are old enough not to, go and do and be, hold jobs, run errands, and contribute in other ways to the household.<br/>
<br/>
Young women in some cultures, even this one a long time ago, weren&#39;t able to leave home without getting married.  What happened with those women who never married?  I imagine they stayed home.<br/>

Kirby worked from the time he was 14 (starting with part time and  <br/>
going to fulltime by the time he was 19).   He moved out at 21; his  <br/>
job paid for his move to Austin.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has been gone more than home since September, living with  <br/>
different families.  She plans to get an apartment when she moves back  <br/>
this summer, but if she doesn&#39;t that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;d rather have her  <br/>
here, but she&#39;s interested in moving out.  Maybe she&#39;ll come back at  <br/>
some point.<br/>
<br/>
Marty worked full time all through his 17th year,then traveled and  <br/>
hung out for a year on his savings. He had 30-hour a week job for  <br/>
another year and some, and then quit.  He&#39;e been unemployed for a  <br/>
while, though he gets small jobs occasionally.  He&#39;s 21 and home.   <br/>
He&#39;s really helpful.  I printed out three resumes for him last week  <br/>
and didn&#39;t ask him what they were for.  He took the accuplacer test at  <br/>
the community college and might be taking summer classes, but might  <br/>
wait for fall.   I&#39;m fine either way.<br/>
<br/>
I have no concerns about his future.   Keith was 21 when we first  <br/>
met.   He was an unemployed college dropout without a clue what he  <br/>
wanted to do.  He changed his mind lots of times in his 20&#39;s, and  <br/>
finished a cobbled together degree when he was nearly 29.    Major in  <br/>
Computer Science and minor in theatre.  That was a lot of extended  <br/>
farting around.   But we had a lot of fun, and didn&#39;t mind being poor.<br/>
Sometimes we both had jobs.  Sometimes one of us was in school.<br/>
<br/>
Marty will be fine.  We could pressure him and shame him, but why  <br/>
would we start doing that?  We&#39;ve seen the harm it has done in other  <br/>
families.<br/>

<br/>
Call me crazy, family-oriented, over-involved, too emotional -- whatever --<br/>
but I think if my kids hung around until they were in their late teens,<br/>
early twenties, I&#39;d be thrilled in many ways.  Granted, I still have babies<br/>
(and when I think of them going away as young adults, I get teary), but I<br/>
also have a teen and pre-teen, and I can imagine them being around for a<br/>
long, long time.  Also, we run a family business, in a way that would make<br/>
it really cool if they decided to be part of it when they are young adults.<br/>
I don&#39;t expect them to, but if they wanted to, that would be fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you follow a philosophy of *unschooling,* but you think of it<br/>
less as a *method of education* and more as just living and learning and<br/>
loving life together, then the concern or fear or whatever about them not<br/>
heading out on their own at a certain, proscribed age or point in life,<br/>
might really not occur to you, or bother you that much.  The idea of having<br/>
&quot;expectations&quot; based on a certain age really doesn&#39;t make sense, given<br/>
you&#39;ve led your life as if the typical societal expectations (that they<br/>
should read at 5, and be in Little League, and do Algebra I in 7th grade,<br/>
and go to prom at 17) don&#39;t apply.  Why should it suddenly matter at 18?<br/>
Why expectations?  Why, &quot;Ok, now you&#39;re 18, time to either get a job or go<br/>
to college&quot;?  I think that would fly in the face of unschooling/Always<br/>
Learning principles and philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
If I think about just continuing to love life with my kids, and growing with<br/>
them, I can&#39;t imagine them NOT going off and following their natural urges<br/>
to become independent of us, and yet, I can totally imagine still supporting<br/>
them here at our house, and having them be a part of our lives until they<br/>
are able (financially or otherwise) and willing to go do their own thing.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I, both formally over-educated beyond stupidity, have agreed<br/>
for a long time that we don&#39;t care one way or another if our kids choose to<br/>
go to college or not.  College, and for that matter, further post-secondary<br/>
education and credentialing, do not make life better or happier or more<br/>
productive or whatever those things are supposed to promise for young<br/>
adults.  As for work, I fully believe that a young person who has grown up<br/>
with lots of choices and independence has a natural tendency to seek out<br/>
those activities that make them feel fulfilled or happy or content.  I know<br/>
for myself that when I was just 14 or 15, I was already imagining and<br/>
dreaming about my own home, my own life separate from my parents, and that<br/>
the mere excitement of being free to set up house when I was old enough to<br/>
have a job and earn money and make that a reality was just fascinating.  Our<br/>
kids are already earning money, because they want to, not because we *make*<br/>
them -- because it&#39;s fun and interesting and gives them the opportunity to<br/>
buy stuff they want.<br/>
<br/>
If the idea of unschooling conjures fearful images of *lazy* or<br/>
*unmotivated* young adults who would rather mooch off their parents in<br/>
perpetuity, well, I have to just flatly disagree with that idea (it&#39;s such a<br/>
silly cliche, anyway).  A kid who has spent his or her young years working<br/>
and playing and learning alongside caring, loving, interesting adults, is<br/>
going to have every reason to become a caring, loving, interesting adult who<br/>
is involved in relationships and activities him or herself.  I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
my passionate 9-year-old step-son losing interest in life, or becoming<br/>
fearful of leaving our nest, unless he was somehow given the impression that<br/>
he should lose interest, or that he isn&#39;t capable of seeking out his own,<br/>
independent living situation.<br/>
<br/>
If anything, I think the school culture of being told what to do, being<br/>
constantly judged against yourself and against others, of being put in a box<br/>
with a label, of being bored out of your mind for long stretches, of being<br/>
emotionally beat up regularly, could lead to that outcome much more<br/>
commonly.  How shocking for the typically-schooled young adult, at 18, to<br/>
find oneself finally in a position to make decisions in a world of millions<br/>
of decisions.  To find oneself suddenly without a report card to tell you<br/>
how you&#39;re doing, without a teacher or guidance counselor or guru telling<br/>
you what line to get in, without a textbook or a class schedule!  In my<br/>
case, I knew the only answer was college, because I didn&#39;t know how to do<br/>
anything BUT school.  And I nearly had a nervous breakdown as the end of<br/>
college approached.  The answer?  More school.  And after that?  More.  It<br/>
took a good damn brush with my own mortality to finally break free of the<br/>
addiction to being told where to go, what to do, when.  I learned that the<br/>
only things I really, truly cared about in this life were: growing things,<br/>
being with family, and writing.  And so I quit jumping through hoops and<br/>
followed those loves, many years after I could have embraced them.  My whole<br/>
life, I was told that growing things was &quot;just a hobby,&quot; as was writing, and<br/>
that family was what you had on the evenings and weekends when you got away<br/>
from your job.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my husband and I farm and hang out with our family, despite multiple<br/>
degrees and credentials and crap that never mattered.  I don&#39;t want my kids<br/>
to experience that hoop-jumping idiocy.<br/>
<br/>
I would almost be willing to bet that unschooling / always learning prepares<br/>
kids more for the *responsibilities* and independence of life away from the<br/>
nest than traditional school does, for all those reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve babbled too much.  I just *heard* in your posted questions the fear<br/>
that a lot of people have when they think of unschooling (lazy kids doing<br/>
nothing!  When will they do Something???) -- and I think it requires a<br/>
letting go of all those typical societal, age-based expectations.<br/>

They would say Sandra and Keith, me and my husband - we&#39;re weren&#39;t <br/>
unschooled so we aren&#39;t unschoolers, even though we&#39;re learning outside <br/>
of school.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell my kids, &quot;You were unschooled, but you are no longer <br/>
unschoolers,&quot; except they are really convinced that having been <br/>
unschooled, they are different than other people as a result and so they <br/>
still identify with being unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397490124">In the U.S. and in the UK they often became school teachers or governesses and worked in what jobs were available. There are fantastic diary and letter collections from women like that in South Dakota and Minnesota and Montana. Redmond O&#39;Hanlon, I think, talks about a couple of spinster sisters who homesteaded in South Dakota, I think. Maybe I&#39;m blurring books, maybe their story is separate and intact and not in his book badlands. Women who didn&#39;t marry had to make a way for themselves. In the UK I think there were more servants options available. There is a tombstone in Bury St. Edmund, in the cautionary graveyard, that speaks of the girl buried beneath. She was a household servant who was hung because she let her lover into the house to do her master and mistress harm and to rob the house. So, that was an option open to some of the unmarried women in the UK. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are young, so I can&#39;t speak from experience as a parent. I _can_ speak to my expectations, and to my experience as a young adult.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra mentioned that she and Keith noodled around a lot in their 20s. Nearly all of my close friends went to college right out of high school, and graduated four years later (give or take a semester). Nearly all of us, though, later went back to school for various reasons. I went back in my 30s to get the English major I&#39;d always wanted, just for fun (my parents were paying for college and wouldn&#39;t let me major in English the first time around). My partner David went back as an undergrad after working as a librarian for several years and finding that the computer aspect of librarianship was the most fun for him; he studied computer science and is now a software engineer. Another friend went back to become a Physicians&#39; Assistant; she had to spend some time taking prerequisites first because, not knowing she wanted to be a PA, she hadn&#39;t taken anatomy or chemistry or things like that in college.<br/>
<br/>
We all were very successful in college, but that first 4-year degree didn&#39;t end up doing us much good. From a certain perspective, it was a waste of time and money, even though we enjoyed ourselves and learned a lot. Enjoying ourselves and learning a lot are certainly worthwhile, but we _thought_ we were there to get the education that would prepare us for our lives and careers. And it didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So, from that experience, I don&#39;t assume or expect my kids will go to college in their late teens. Unlike all the people around us whose kids at 9 or 10 already expect to go to college (one of my son&#39;s friends talked about it to us the other day; he&#39;s 10), to the extent it&#39;s come up at all I&#39;ve said to the kids that it&#39;s one thing they might choose to do when they get older. I think it makes sense for college to be a more considered decision than &quot;it&#39;s what you must do.&quot; Does the person have a career in mind they&#39;d like to explore? Is there something specific they&#39;re interested in learning? Do they want to have fun and learn a lot? Is college the best way for them to do any of those things? If so, does that mean being an on-campus student at a 4-year college or university, or something else?<br/>
<br/>
College is very expensive, most of the time. I&#39;m happy to put what resources I have towards that for my children. But if, at the same age, they want to keep living at home, work a part-time job, and hang out with their friends a lot, I&#39;d be happy to help with that, too. Or if they wanted to travel. Or had an art or something else they wanted to explore. For some people, it might make a lot more sense to be a college student later in life, after they&#39;ve had a chance to get some experience, see what&#39;s out there, figure out what they like. College is a great place for exploration but it&#39;s not the only place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559701274">With the idea that unschooling ends when a child is outside the compulsory school age, this may not apply here. I came to this list, though, because I knew there were unschoolers here with older, adult children that might have more insight into this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We could pressure him and shame him, but why  <br/>
&gt; would we start doing that?  We&#39;ve seen the harm it has done in other  <br/>
&gt; families.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess this is what I&#39;m struggling with. Not the shaming part. I wouldn&#39;t do that. The pressuring part. I&#39;m trying to be supportive and encouraging to my 19 year old, Ryan, about getting a job and/or taking college classes without making him feel pressured. <br/>
<br/>
Ryan says he wants to get a job but it&#39;s really hard right now, especially when you are young and don&#39;t have much work experience. I get that. Part of the problem is, I think, because he doesn&#39;t really know how to go after a job. I try to talk to him about having to do more than just turn in an application but he shuts down. Refuses to listen. He says he&#39;s doing what he can. I don&#39;t see him out there doing that every day, though. What I see is him hanging out with his friends, skateboarding or playing video games.<br/>
<br/>
He has said since he was 12 that he wants to be a chef and own his own restaurant. One of the community colleges near us has a culinary arts program. It&#39;s about an hour away, though, and we don&#39;t have an extra car so he&#39;d have to use my car. That would mean me and the little ones would be stuck at home most days. So I said he could take the general ed classes that are required at the closer community college and then after a year or so he could transfer to the other one. My hope was/is that by then he&#39;d have a job and we could get him his own car. We can buy him a car but we can&#39;t afford to pay for his insurance, which is why he would need to get a job to have use of the car. <br/>
<br/>
He signed up for 3 classes for the spring semester but got dropped from all 3 classes for missing too many days. He says he didn&#39;t mean to do that and he does still want to take classes. Now it&#39;s time for summer registration and he doesn&#39;t seem interested. He needs to find out which English class he tested into before he is scheduled to register on Wednesday but he won&#39;t do it. I&#39;m thinking maybe he doesn&#39;t really want to. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be ok with him not going this summer but I&#39;m getting a lot of pressure from my husband to get Ryan to do something because he&#39;s legally an adult now. My husband says we provide him with food and shelter and that&#39;s enough. We shouldn&#39;t be giving him anything else unless he works and/or goes to school. For example, my husband said I should not let Ryan use the car unless he can pay for the gas, knowing full well that he can&#39;t because he doesn&#39;t have a job. That seems unfair to me within the ideas and principles of unschooling. It&#39;s very common within mainstream parenting and living.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, I can understand my husband&#39;s position. Ryan is an adult now and you&#39;d think he&#39;d want to get out on his own and be independent. On the other hand, he is only 19, just barely an adult, and he may need more time to figure out what all of that means. For the most part, I don&#39;t mind him taking more time to figure things out. I do have some concerns and fears about him just hanging out with his friends. I&#39;m not sure how to go about helping him find what he needs without him feeling pressured.<br/>

<br/>
I should have mentioned the significant others.  My kids are on the  <br/>
grown end of the scale.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was here we didn&#39;t mind if he had someone over.  There was  <br/>
one girl for a while; stayed a few times.  Great singer; I already had  <br/>
my eye on genetically singing grandkids.  But no, when he moved to  <br/>
Texas she started dating a friend of his here.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s boyfriend lived with us for several months.  Not quite a year,  <br/>
I think, and she gave him the gentle boot.  He wasn&#39;t taking the  <br/>
gentle boot and I gave them the &quot;Seriously; Holly said...&quot; and then he  <br/>
moved.   I called him on his birthday the other day.  He was over  <br/>
playing music with Marty last week.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has had a girlfriend for 14 months.  She had an apartment and  <br/>
invited him to move in with her.  He declined politely.   She hinted  <br/>
heavily about moving in here (since Holly&#39;s boyfriend was here).   <br/>
Marty said he wasn&#39;t interested in that.<br/>
<br/>
When I was Marty&#39;s age I would have jumped at the chance to go  <br/>
somewhere with somebody (well I did, actually), but Marty likes being  <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
The girlfriend moved from her apartment back to her parents&#39; house to  <br/>
save money to go to college (she&#39;s a junior in anthropology and  <br/>
planning medical school, but not rushing along; she has a full time  <br/>
job in a medical lab).  Marty still didn&#39;t invite her to live here,  <br/>
and her parents won&#39;t let them be over there.   She stays over  <br/>
sometimes several nights in a row, and they&#39;ve begun to mix laundry,  <br/>
but she doesn&#39;t have very much stuff here at all.  She&#39;s not at all  <br/>
moved in.<br/>
<br/>
That might be more evidence for consideration.<br/>
With safety as a priority, I would rather they would be here than out  <br/>
in a car or a tent, if they&#39;re going to &quot;do it.&quot;  I would rather they  <br/>
would be free from attack, robbery, animal bites, lack of condoms and  <br/>
sanitation.   Other families&#39; priorities are different, and that&#39;s the  <br/>
whole deal about making choices.  First decide what you want to  <br/>
nurture and accomplish and then make choices in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
Some things will run a kid off.  You can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t mind if you  <br/>
stay into your 20&#39;s&quot; but then put a ton of rules on it.  You can, but  <br/>
it won&#39;t be the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322394674">== Sandra mentioned that she and Keith noodled around a lot in their 20s. Nearly all of my close friends went to college right out of high school, and graduated four years later (give or take a semester). Nearly all of us, though, later went back to school for various reasons. I went back in my 30s to get the English major I&#39;d always wanted, just for fun (my parents were paying for college and wouldn&#39;t let me major in English the first time around). My partner David went back as an undergrad after working as a librarian for several years and finding that the computer aspect of librarianship was the most fun for him; he studied computer science and is now a software engineer. Another friend went back to become a Physicians&#39; Assistant; she had to spend some time taking prerequisites first because, not knowing she wanted to be a PA, she hadn&#39;t taken anatomy or chemistry or things like that in college.==<br/>
<br/>
I graduated from high school early, started working and living on my own at 17 because I was desperate to get out of my mother&#39;s house. I took college classes here and there but it took me 10 years to get serious and finish. My undergrad degree improved my life immensely. What I learned from that was that my children have their entire lives to go to college or not. That&#39;s one thing I have to continually point out to my husband and mother.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned a family that is paying for college for their children who are only there because that&#39;s what is expected of them when it seems that money could be better spent allowing those children to follow their passions. That&#39;s how I see things. College is not the end all, be all. The rest of my family disagrees with me on that. But what do you do if your college age child doesn&#39;t seem to want to pursue anything?<br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing a lot when I was in my late teens and early 20s that if an adult child didn&#39;t go to college then s/he needed to get a job and get out. That was how everyone around me that I can remember thought. It was (still is to most people, I think) unacceptable for parents to continue to support their adult children. If an 18-20 year old was not working or going to college, he was a bum. <br/>
<br/>
There was a lot more I wanted to say about this but now I can&#39;t remember it. If it comes back to me, I&#39;ll post some more.<br/>

<br/>
Not being able to afford the expenses of another car is a temporary thing, I hope. At the moment, we are having to maintain 2 households because my husband has been assigned somewhere else just long enough that he doesn&#39;t get any extra pay for being gone but for such a short time that it was not worth it to move the whole family. I&#39;m hoping that once he&#39;s home again we&#39;ll be able to pay for all of that. Then my only obstacle will be my husband.<br/>
 <br/>

He can&#39;t seem to get past the idea that our son should be supporting himself now since he&#39;s legally an adult. He thinks not providing him anything but the bare necessities will motivate (force) him to get a job. I think that&#39;s harsh and unfair. Maybe I should run a cost comparison of tuition, supplies and room and board for college vs. a car.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can suggest that. It works for me. We talked about it some more today. He says it&#39;s silly that he has to take classes like Expository English and Art or Music Appreciation to cook. I can understand that. I&#39;m going to try searching again for cooking schools that don&#39;t require the general ed classes. I searched before but didn&#39;t find any that we could afford. He also said he&#39;d go to the other community college to discuss their culinary arts program after I suggested that he could start with the culinary classes there and not have to worry about the others for now.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an excellent point. I will definitely remind my husband of this. The ways that we interact with/treat Ryan has always been a sticking point for us. My husband thinks I&#39;m too soft and I think he&#39;s too rigid. So we go round and round about this. My husband gets unschooling with the younger ones but not with the older one. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is really about money for my husband. I think he&#39;s using that as a reason for his position. I think what it really is, though, is that he&#39;s stuck in that mindset that it&#39;s bad for us to give Ryan this stuff. I can&#39;t quite explain it because I really don&#39;t understand it. I think that whatever we have, we should give to our children at least as much as we give to ourselves. My husband thinks that if we just give Ryan these things, he won&#39;t learn to be responsible and self-sufficient. When Ryan was younger my husband conceded a lot of this to me but now that Ryan is an adult my husband is digging in his heals more. I&#39;m struggling with whether to just put my foot and tell my husband how it&#39;s going to be Ryan or doing some of what my husband wants when I know it&#39;s not the best for Ryan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947254546">I think it depends on where you are and who you are. I know lots of people who&#39;ve had lots of parental support throughout their lives. They live and work on the family farm, or they had the down payment on their house paid for by their parents or they had their college education funded by their folks, or they do volunteer work to buffer their c.v. while before they get a job. In the UK it was traditional to have a gap year. A year between college (high school) and university. That was probably buffered quite mightily with parental aid. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year</a> is an interesting discussion of the Gap year. Interestingly among the Ache, a hunter-gatherer group of Paraguay, young men aren&#39;t really competent at hunting until they are about 30 or so. They are buffered by their community and by their immediate family. The timing of their competence seems to coincide with the timing of their ability to get a wife, amazingly enough. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, maybe folks have glossed over some of the details of history and when children leave home. Just today I found a story of a murder of a young woman in 1827 who was still living at home (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Barn_murder)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Barn_murder)</a> at the time of her death. <br/>

In Mexico people stay home longer and share family businesses quite a  <br/>
bit.  Lots of families with family businesses give their kids jobs,  <br/>
even in English-speaking places.<br/>
<br/>
So in the absence of family farms, ranches and small business, things  <br/>
changed in a lot of places.<br/>
<br/>
I think school being mandatory to the age of 18 (where that&#39;s true;  <br/>
it&#39;s not everywhere) contributes mightily to the odd perception that  <br/>
after high school kids must sink or swim.<br/>

He&#39;s not allowed to have a key to the house. He gets kicked out for months at a time for not following their rules. His stepdad is retiring soon and he and the mom are planning to move several states away. My son told me they have told him, their son, that he can&#39;t come whether he has a job and a place to live or not. He&#39;s the youngest, the baby. All the other kids are out of the house.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654280098">===He has said since he was 12 that he wants to be a chef and own his own restaurant.===<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more than one path to becoming a chef. School is expensive and if money is an issue right now, and if your son isn&#39;t quite ready to jump through all the school-hurdles required to get his certification, then maybe school could be put on the back burner and he can look for jobs or apprenticeships that will specifically allow him to pick up some restaurant / chef&#39;ing experience.<br/>
<br/>
He could look for a job as a prep person at a restaurant. If he doesn&#39;t have luck finding a job, he could go to a locally-owned restaurant and offer to apprentice (might be easier at a locally-owned restaurant than a chain restaurant). School doesn&#39;t compare to hands-on experience.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any private chefs in your city, he could offer to apprentice with one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Brainstorm for ways other than school that will help him work towards his goal. There&#39;s no reason he can&#39;t go back to school in the future, after he&#39;s picked up some hands-on experience. Then again, after getting hands-on experience, he may find he can move forward without going back to school.<br/>
<br/>
He may not be following up on jobs he&#39;s applied for because the jobs don&#39;t particularly interest him. But if he can find a way to work in a field that interests him, odds are good that he&#39;ll be more motivated to work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===He thinks not providing him anything but the bare necessities will motivate (force) him to get a job.===<br/>
<br/>
It may motivate him to leave home and he may end up in an undesireable situation.<br/>
<br/>
If your son wants to take a break from school and opted to take responsibility for more things at home, would that be a middle ground your husband would agree to? Some ideas of things your son could do at home: pay bills and balance the checkbook (a skill that&#39;s necessary to know when he&#39;s on his own); buy groceries and prepare dinner; be sure your car always has gas and is clean; the yardwork; etc. Would your son be agreeable to doing some of those things on a regular basis instead of getting a paying job? Or does he have suggestions of ways he can contribute? Right now he may not feel he offers much value to the household (in his dad&#39;s eyes) if he&#39;s not working or in school, so brainstorm with him and think outside the box and take some ideas to your husband as alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, going back to an earlier post in this thread, hanging out with friends, skateboarding and playing video games may be how your son is processing the pressure he&#39;s feeling. It may look to you like he&#39;s doing nothing, but in reality he may be doing the best he can to deal with the pressure without buckling under it.<br/>

He has been applying at restaurants but can&#39;t seem to get his foot in the door. One place told him that although his desire was to work in the kitchen and they had openings in the kitchen, the personality test they administered him said he was better suited working directly with the customers and they didn&#39;t have any positions for that.<br/>
<br/>
An apprenticeship would be wonderful. I&#39;ve thought about that for awhile but am not really sure how one would go about getting one if it&#39;s not advertised. I guess the thing to do would be to just go to various restaurants and ask. <br/>

He does the grocery shopping a lot because I hate to do that and cooks meals (another one of my least favorite things to do). He cleans the car and does yard work when I ask him. He takes out the trash (most of the time). I think I need to find a better way of presenting all of this to my husband. Since he&#39;s not home much he doesn&#39;t see what happens on a daily basis. <br/>
<br/>
== Oh, going back to an earlier post in this thread, hanging out with friends, skateboarding and playing video games may be how your son is processing the pressure he&#39;s feeling. It may look to you like he&#39;s doing nothing, but in reality he may be doing the best he can to deal with the pressure without buckling under it.==<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this. I know my original post probably made it sound like I thought those things were equivalent to doing nothing but that&#39;s not how I think. Everyone else around me sees it that way so I was presenting it from their point of view.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165153672">I got zero &#39;babble&quot; from that piece, Deb. It describes my life to a<br/>
TEE or is that just a &quot;T?&quot; (Whatever.) I did the endless college thing<br/>
and a whole lot of other similar shifting around, being unsure what to<br/>
DO. I know planning is not something that school asks and neither did<br/>
my parents, and so I&#39;m still pushing as hard as I can in that<br/>
&quot;planning&quot; direction. It&#39;s working. Slowly (surely).<br/>
<br/>
I guess that puts a kibbosh on the old &quot;late-bloomer&quot; label I&#39;ve been<br/>
wearing all my life. Thanks! I love shedding labels like that! I&#39;m not<br/>
a late-bloomer after all. Schoolthink held me back more than I even<br/>
gave it credit for.<br/>

&gt; ***At 18 or 19 or 20, do they continue to unschool, hanging out at home,<br/>

&gt; your late teen, early 20s child to work or go to college or would it be ok<br/>
&gt; if they hung out at home and unschooled for a few more years? If you do have<br/>
&gt; expectations that they work and/or go to college but they don&#39;t or won&#39;t,<br/>
&gt; what would you do?***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Call me crazy, family-oriented, over-involved, too emotional -- whatever --<br/>
&gt; but I think if my kids hung around until they were in their late teens,<br/>
&gt; early twenties, I&#39;d be thrilled in many ways.  Granted, I still have babies<br/>
&gt; (and when I think of them going away as young adults, I get teary), but I<br/>
&gt; also have a teen and pre-teen, and I can imagine them being around for a<br/>
&gt; long, long time.  Also, we run a family business, in a way that would make<br/>
&gt; it really cool if they decided to be part of it when they are young adults.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t expect them to, but if they wanted to, that would be fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think if you follow a philosophy of *unschooling,* but you think of it<br/>
&gt; less as a *method of education* and more as just living and learning and<br/>
&gt; loving life together, then the concern or fear or whatever about them not<br/>
&gt; heading out on their own at a certain, proscribed age or point in life,<br/>
&gt; might really not occur to you, or bother you that much.  The idea of having<br/>
&gt; &quot;expectations&quot; based on a certain age really doesn&#39;t make sense, given<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve led your life as if the typical societal expectations (that they<br/>
&gt; should read at 5, and be in Little League, and do Algebra I in 7th grade,<br/>
&gt; and go to prom at 17) don&#39;t apply.  Why should it suddenly matter at 18?<br/>
&gt; Why expectations?  Why, &quot;Ok, now you&#39;re 18, time to either get a job or go<br/>
&gt; to college&quot;?  I think that would fly in the face of unschooling/Always<br/>
&gt; Learning principles and philosophy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I think about just continuing to love life with my kids, and growing with<br/>
&gt; them, I can&#39;t imagine them NOT going off and following their natural urges<br/>
&gt; to become independent of us, and yet, I can totally imagine still supporting<br/>
&gt; them here at our house, and having them be a part of our lives until they<br/>
&gt; are able (financially or otherwise) and willing to go do their own thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband and I, both formally over-educated beyond stupidity, have agreed<br/>
&gt; for a long time that we don&#39;t care one way or another if our kids choose to<br/>
&gt; go to college or not.  College, and for that matter, further post-secondary<br/>
&gt; education and credentialing, do not make life better or happier or more<br/>
&gt; productive or whatever those things are supposed to promise for young<br/>
&gt; adults.  As for work, I fully believe that a young person who has grown up<br/>
&gt; with lots of choices and independence has a natural tendency to seek out<br/>
&gt; those activities that make them feel fulfilled or happy or content.  I know<br/>
&gt; for myself that when I was just 14 or 15, I was already imagining and<br/>
&gt; dreaming about my own home, my own life separate from my parents, and that<br/>
&gt; the mere excitement of being free to set up house when I was old enough to<br/>
&gt; have a job and earn money and make that a reality was just fascinating.  Our<br/>
&gt; kids are already earning money, because they want to, not because we *make*<br/>
&gt; them -- because it&#39;s fun and interesting and gives them the opportunity to<br/>
&gt; buy stuff they want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the idea of unschooling conjures fearful images of *lazy* or<br/>
&gt; *unmotivated* young adults who would rather mooch off their parents in<br/>
&gt; perpetuity, well, I have to just flatly disagree with that idea (it&#39;s such a<br/>
&gt; silly cliche, anyway).  A kid who has spent his or her young years working<br/>
&gt; and playing and learning alongside caring, loving, interesting adults, is<br/>
&gt; going to have every reason to become a caring, loving, interesting adult who<br/>
&gt; is involved in relationships and activities him or herself.  I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
&gt; my passionate 9-year-old step-son losing interest in life, or becoming<br/>
&gt; fearful of leaving our nest, unless he was somehow given the impression that<br/>
&gt; he should lose interest, or that he isn&#39;t capable of seeking out his own,<br/>
&gt; independent living situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anything, I think the school culture of being told what to do, being<br/>
&gt; constantly judged against yourself and against others, of being put in a box<br/>
&gt; with a label, of being bored out of your mind for long stretches, of being<br/>
&gt; emotionally beat up regularly, could lead to that outcome much more<br/>
&gt; commonly.  How shocking for the typically-schooled young adult, at 18, to<br/>
&gt; find oneself finally in a position to make decisions in a world of millions<br/>
&gt; of decisions.  To find oneself suddenly without a report card to tell you<br/>
&gt; how you&#39;re doing, without a teacher or guidance counselor or guru telling<br/>
&gt; you what line to get in, without a textbook or a class schedule!  In my<br/>
&gt; case, I knew the only answer was college, because I didn&#39;t know how to do<br/>
&gt; anything BUT school.  And I nearly had a nervous breakdown as the end of<br/>
&gt; college approached.  The answer?  More school.  And after that?  More.  It<br/>
&gt; took a good damn brush with my own mortality to finally break free of the<br/>
&gt; addiction to being told where to go, what to do, when.  I learned that the<br/>
&gt; only things I really, truly cared about in this life were: growing things,<br/>
&gt; being with family, and writing.  And so I quit jumping through hoops and<br/>
&gt; followed those loves, many years after I could have embraced them.  My whole<br/>
&gt; life, I was told that growing things was &quot;just a hobby,&quot; as was writing, and<br/>
&gt; that family was what you had on the evenings and weekends when you got away<br/>
&gt; from your job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, my husband and I farm and hang out with our family, despite multiple<br/>
&gt; degrees and credentials and crap that never mattered.  I don&#39;t want my kids<br/>
&gt; to experience that hoop-jumping idiocy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would almost be willing to bet that unschooling / always learning prepares<br/>
&gt; kids more for the *responsibilities* and independence of life away from the<br/>
&gt; nest than traditional school does, for all those reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve babbled too much.  I just *heard* in your posted questions the fear<br/>
&gt; that a lot of people have when they think of unschooling (lazy kids doing<br/>
&gt; nothing!  When will they do Something???) -- and I think it requires a<br/>
&gt; letting go of all those typical societal, age-based expectations.<br/>

I LOVE libraries and universities.  I would love to have been a  <br/>
professor.  Not in combination with the kids I had, but if I hadn&#39;t  <br/>
had any children I would love, love LOVE to have been a professor of  <br/>
some sort of history of something in the direction of folklore/Bible/ <br/>
religion/medieval literature.  I would never have had to leave  <br/>
school.  I could have an office at a university keep my library books  <br/>
as long as I wanted to, get free books from authors and publishers and  <br/>
get paid to talk to students in half-hour appointment, and eat at the  <br/>
student union building and funky cafes within walking distance of my  <br/>
own office full of books.<br/>
<br/>
That would be like winning a big video game, for me, to go to school  <br/>
long enough that they pay you to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t have liked giving bad grades or failing people or  <br/>
putting people out of programs.  I wouldn&#39;t have liked to deal with  <br/>
bullshitters or cheaters.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the topic of adult children and the value of college vs.  <br/>
life... when someone keeps going back to school, that&#39;s respectable.   <br/>
Staying in school for life is respectable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994105970">hi all, <br/>
I&#39;m coming out of lurkdom to chime in on this topic.<br/>
 I am currently a pastry chef in my latest career so I have some ideas.<br/>
Before thinking about culinary school, your son may find it extremely beneficial to work in the industry for a year or two first. Finding a prep cook job can be a challange for someone with no experience in restaurants. Most non-graduates start as a dishwasher, which in my opinion is the very best place to start. Dishwasher is the most important position in a kitchen. It helps one learn speed and attention to detail, two vital skills. Often times, when the restaurant is not busy, a dishwasher is utilized to do simple prep work, such as cleaning veggies, chopping, or making stock. Many dishwashers who prove their worth don&#39;t stay dishwashers for long. Prepping requires some skills that many people new to the industry aren&#39;t aware of, such as good knife skills and knowledge of the difference between cooking at home (for 2-6 people) vs cooking in quantity (anywhere between 10 and 50 servings). If he has never worked in a restaurant, attempting to step in to a non-entry level position such as prep cook can be difficult. I would expect someone who started as a DWer, who shows a willingness to learn, speed and stamina to be cooking on the line within a year.  Restaurant cooking can be a physically and mentally exhausting job that many people decide is not for them. Finding that out before spending a ton of money on school is a good idea.<br/>
If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask me!<br/>
