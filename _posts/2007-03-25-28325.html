 <br/>
Anika, my 6yo dd is a daisy scout.  I am the troop leader.  The troop has<br/>
been together for just over a year and I am getting ready to bridge them to<br/>
Brownies.  All is not well, however, in Daisy land.  Anika really wants this<br/>
group but she is frustrated with the format.  Wants more free play and less<br/>
crafts and meeting stuff.  The problem is when she feels frustrated she<br/>
whines, yells, and acts in ways that bring the meetings to a screaming halt.<br/>
 <br/>
Ani is loud when she is playing but mostly when she does not like the way<br/>
the meeting is going.  Some of the other girls&#39; mothers have told me that<br/>
this frightens their daughters.  and although I could see this when they had<br/>
just met, My take is that they are annoyed with her and frustrated rather<br/>
than frightened.  If I give her verbal guidance, no matter how gentle, in<br/>
the moment, she will shout something like, I don&#39;t care!   Now, I know she<br/>
does care about having friendships with these girls.  She was nearly in<br/>
tears about it last week.  <br/>
 <br/>
The other moms are about fed up with the disruptions.  They are mostly very<br/>
nice.  They are all very schooly and have recently asked that we impliment<br/>
&quot;consequences&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot;.   I am afraid the actual consequence of not<br/>
fixing this problem will be that we won&#39;t have a troop next year because no<br/>
one will sign up again.  I just hate that it has gotten to the point where<br/>
my dd is being viewed as &quot;the problem&quot;.  These girls are only 6.  Surely<br/>
part of the experience is to help them with just these kinds of<br/>
interpersonal issues.<br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas would be welcome.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it possible for another mom to take over the troop so you can be <br/>
more focussed on your dd? It seems unfair to your dd that you are <br/>
focussing so much energy on these other kids when she is - quite <br/>
literally - screaming for your attention. If you were free to <br/>
facilitate her needs you could take her outside or help her play in <br/>
other ways that allow her to be with the group but not necessarily <br/>
doing the same things as everyone else. <br/>
<br/>
Both my dd and my stepson have always needed a bit of help dealing <br/>
with group activities and events. When my stepson was small (we, <br/>
sadly, didn&#39;t know about unschooling, then) we would get very <br/>
frustrated when other people weren&#39;t tolerant of his boisterousness -<br/>
 I understand that feeling! It took us far too long to figure out <br/>
that a whole lot of his disruptive behavior was due to the fact that <br/>
we were shoving his needs aside. Once we started to prioritize his <br/>
needs we found social situations went a lot more smoothly for <br/>
everyone. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>rather<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; than frightened. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to discount the idea that the other kids are <br/>
frightened, especially if your dd is very loud. Loud noises can be <br/>
scary. Loud people-noises may be associated with angry adults for <br/>
some of these girls, too - that&#39;s a pretty scary association. <br/>
<br/>
But even if they are &quot;just&quot; annoyed and frustrated, as the troop <br/>
leader you have a responsibility to create a peaceful environment <br/>
for these girls. Its unkind to allow one girl in the group to be so <br/>
distraught as to &quot;bring the meetings to a screaming halt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Talk to the other moms and see if one or more would be interested in <br/>
facilitating the group activities so that you can help your dd.<br/>

<br/>
When this happens what do you do?  I have been a daisy leader and a <br/>
brownie leader both at the same time even, with a mixed age group.  <br/>
Whenever we&#39;ve had problems in our group with any of the kids, mine <br/>
or my co-leader&#39;s or anyone else, we do stop and regroup and work it <br/>
out.  We go back to the GS laws and work on those things that <br/>
surface.  No girl is going to be happy 100% of the time in every <br/>
meeting.  The key with our troop is to work together as a team and <br/>
help each girl feel comfortable and accepted and as happy as <br/>
possible.  So, if one child is really uncomfortable, the other girls <br/>
can use their creative problem solving skills to help their friend in <br/>
need.  &quot;Be a sister to every girl scout&quot;  Those laws are set in place <br/>
for a reason.  Use them when you need to, talk about it.  Scouts is <br/>
not about doing crafts and projects as much as it is about personal <br/>
growth and teamwork, especially at the daisy/early brownie age.  The <br/>
parents should know that too, if they are expecting something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
We also build in free play for our meetings.  Daisy girls really <br/>
can&#39;t handle more than 30 min of sit down focus type work, some can&#39;t <br/>
even handle that, and there should be built in options for those that <br/>
can&#39;t.  We have play time EVERY week when we meet, sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
stuff like freeze dance or other active GS games (and there are lots <br/>
of them in the GS handbooks) and sometimes we have the girls bring <br/>
dress up clothes or sometimes we bring cardboard boxes or things to <br/>
build forts and do pretend play.  Sometimes we set actual meeting <br/>
time to do nothing but play at a park, for a break from doing <br/>
structured GS work, we all meet somewhere with a picnic lunch and let <br/>
the kids play.<br/>
<br/>
We let the girls have loud times and quiet times.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>
your parents are expecting, but you are a volunteer guiding the kids <br/>
through a scouting experience.  When girls signed up for our troop, <br/>
we made it absolutely clear that we were not structured and that our <br/>
focus was on fun, play, and getting along, with a bonus of doing some <br/>
GS stuff.  Within our GS stuff, we also work on Roots and Shoots, so <br/>
going to parks and stuff is totally part of the deal.  We also <br/>
involve the parents as much as possible, we delegate stuff for them <br/>
to bring or do for meetings.  We make is as mandatory as possible for <br/>
the parents to be there and present with the child.  I know other <br/>
troops aren&#39;t like that, but we made ours like that, because we <br/>
didn&#39;t want to be a drop off babysitting service like some troops are.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anything I&#39;m saying will help your troop or not.  I <br/>
do know that we&#39;ve had people leave our troop because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
structured enough, and good riddance as far as I&#39;m concerned.  All <br/>
you need is 4 girls to have a troop.  I&#39;d rather have 4 really nice <br/>
girls that all get along than a large troop that clashes or causes my <br/>
child to feel insecure.</div>

surface.  No girl is going to be happy 100% of the time in every <br/>
meeting.  The key with our troop is to work together as a team and <br/>
help each girl feel comfortable and accepted and as happy as <br/>
possible.  So, if one child is really uncomfortable, the other girls <br/>
can use their creative problem solving skills to help their friend in <br/>
need.  &quot;Be a sister to every girl scout&quot;  Those laws are set in place <br/>
for a reason.  Use them when you need to, talk about it.  Scouts is <br/>
not about doing crafts and projects as much as it is about personal <br/>
growth and teamwork, especially at the daisy/early brownie age.  The <br/>
parents should know that too, if they are expecting something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
We also build in free play for our meetings.  Daisy girls really <br/>
can&#39;t handle more than 30 min of sit down focus type work, some can&#39;t <br/>
even handle that, and there should be built in options for those that <br/>
can&#39;t.  We have play time EVERY week when we meet, sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
stuff like freeze dance or other active GS games (and there are lots <br/>
of them in the GS handbooks) and sometimes we have the girls bring <br/>
dress up clothes or sometimes we bring cardboard boxes or things to <br/>
build forts and do pretend play.  Sometimes we set actual meeting <br/>
time to do nothing but play at a park, for a break from doing <br/>
structured GS work, we all meet somewhere with a picnic lunch and let <br/>
the kids play.<br/>
<br/>
We let the girls have loud times and quiet times.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>
your parents are expecting, but you are a volunteer guiding the kids <br/>
through a scouting experience.  When girls signed up for our troop, <br/>
we made it absolutely clear that we were not structured and that our <br/>
focus was on fun, play, and getting along, with a bonus of doing some <br/>
GS stuff.  Within our GS stuff, we also work on Roots and Shoots, so <br/>
going to parks and stuff is totally part of the deal.  We also <br/>
involve the parents as much as possible, we delegate stuff for them <br/>
to bring or do for meetings.  We make is as mandatory as possible for <br/>
the parents to be there and present with the child.  I know other <br/>
troops aren&#39;t like that, but we made ours like that, because we <br/>
didn&#39;t want to be a drop off babysitting service like some troops are.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anything I&#39;m saying will help your troop or not.  I <br/>
do know that we&#39;ve had people leave our troop because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
structured enough, and good riddance as far as I&#39;m concerned.  All <br/>
you need is 4 girls to have a troop.  I&#39;d rather have 4 really nice <br/>
girls that all get along than a large troop that clashes or causes my <br/>
child to feel insecure.</div>

<h4>Krisula Moyer at 2007-03-29 21:28:51 +0300 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915461727">Thank you Jen.  What a great post.  (I won&#39; t copy it here since Yahoo made<br/>
sure everyone got it a dozen times or so yesterday.)  It is very inspiring<br/>
to see how differently you&#39;ve gone about your troop.  I think if we are<br/>
going to keep our troop we will explore a more relaxed model like yours with<br/>
lots of play and focusing on respect and the individual needs of the girls.<br/>
Now that I write it here it seems obvious but just two weeks ago I had no<br/>
idea what to do to change things.  I am inspired also by your free play park<br/>
days.  Anika would *love* that and I bet the other girls would too.  And<br/>
thank you, also for sharing about Roots and Shoots.  I was really glad to<br/>
take a look at that.<br/>
 <br/>
You asked &quot;what do you do&quot; when Anika acts out.  I guess most of the time I<br/>
don&#39;t let her get that far.  I stand next to her, hold her hand, focus on<br/>
her for a bit.  But this still just keeps the explosion at bay.  Her<br/>
discontent is still bubbling beneath the surface. There *are* times she is<br/>
engaged and likes being there.   I haven&#39;t tried to utilized the group as<br/>
you suggest.  That is a very good idea.  Last week when she did get to the<br/>
point of no return I left my co leader to do an activity with the group and<br/>
took Ani outside to let her calm down.  She very much wanted to go back<br/>
inside and didn&#39;t want to miss time with her friends so she was still<br/>
anxious, not quite calm, when we returned but that was the very end of the<br/>
time and she was able to do a closer with us before everyone left.  After<br/>
they all went she sat on my lap for a long time (we meet at a school so I<br/>
still had to gather my stuff and go)  She talked about all the things that<br/>
happened that bothered her and cried because the kids hadn&#39;t wanted  her to<br/>
play with them at the end.  (This happened after the meeting when they were<br/>
all getting ready to leave)  I told her that some of the girls were upset<br/>
because she had been talking loudly or rudely to them.  She said &quot;but I<br/>
stopped.  They still wouldn&#39;t let me play.&quot;  So I see she is thinking about<br/>
it.  She was disappointed that her decision to try to get along wasn&#39;t met<br/>
with immediate reversal.  I actually think the girls would have let her play<br/>
with them if I had pointed out that she heard their complaint and wanted to<br/>
try again to be nice.   If this had happened earlier in the meeting we<br/>
could&#39;ve talked about it and helped them all but it happened as everyone was<br/>
gathering their things and leaving and the moms were trying to get everyone<br/>
out.  <br/>
 <br/>
Tomorrow is the next meeting and I have asked someone else to lead so I can<br/>
hang back with my daughter.  I shared your post with my co leader and we&#39;re<br/>
going to try to put lots more play time into our gatherings.  In the end I<br/>
still might drop the group but I want to try first to see if it can be<br/>
something much better than it is right now.  Anika, despite her many<br/>
frustrations still wants to give it a go.  <br/>
