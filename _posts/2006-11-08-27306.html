<div id="ygrps-yiv-715638321">&lt;&lt;I have tried speaking with the kids about my frustrations,<br/>
explaining that I&#39;d like to meet more homeschoolers, find friends they like <br/>
who can play during the<br/>
day, that I&#39;d like to try more classes or outings&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, it&#39;s Crystal.  I&#39;d like to note that sometimes just because I want <br/>
something (here&#39;s me again...just like Veruca Salt from Willy Wonka...&quot;But <br/>
Daddy I WANT) doesn&#39;t mean that Sorscha wants it.  I have learned how to <br/>
&#39;shut-up&#39; (that is one of my favorite self talks the last few months) about <br/>
my frustrations.   Frustrations that range the whole spectrum of life.  If I <br/>
look at my past I can see Sorscha singing that song in her head, &quot;You talk <br/>
to much...you never shut up&quot;.  I can&#39;t remember the name of it.<br/>
<br/>
I used to drag Sorscha everywhere to meet friends, do classes, do <br/>
fieldtrips, etc.  I truly believed that it was in her best interest.  I was <br/>
exposing her to all those wonderful opportunities.  I think I thought that <br/>
if I missed an opportunity that Sorscha would have one less peg in her life <br/>
board and that I would be doing her a disservice as her parent.  In the last <br/>
year Sorscha has chosen to mostly be at home hangin out with me or the <br/>
homeschooled girl across the street. As a family we often choose to cocoon <br/>
together.  Our activities have dwindled so much.  The importance of this is <br/>
that Sorscha is happy.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy being with people, Sorscha is so so about it.  I really enjoy <br/>
going on trips, Sorscha is so so about it.  I really enjoy all sorts of <br/>
parties and events, Sorscha is so so.  What I have realized is that <br/>
ultimately I am at home and unschooling for her...not for me (okay, but WOW <br/>
have I learned so much on the journey).  If Sorscha were never born I would <br/>
not be doing what we do.  So, if I am being and doing all this for her then <br/>
shouldn&#39;t it be her choices, opportunities, and wants?  I say yes. <br/>
Expectations of a magical unschooling life are just that...expectations. <br/>
Expectations are set-ups with little trap doors waiting to snatch Sorscha <br/>
up.  Day by day it does not matter that we meet more home schoolers, find <br/>
friends, or take classes.  Day by day we choose to live the magical <br/>
unschooling life and that brings amazing adventures.  I realized that it is <br/>
not my responsibility to choose which holes Sorscha wants to fill with pegs. <br/>
It is my responsibility to respect her choices and gently help her when she <br/>
ask questions.  It&#39;s not my responsibility to &#39;fill&#39; her life with stuff she <br/>
does not choose<br/>
<br/>
Rambling like my typical, thought pondering, unschooling brain does.<br/>

PS: This non-grammar and not great spelling gal just spelled checked and it <br/>
said everything was correct.  I&#39;ve got this huge smile on my face.  You know <br/>
this could get me starting a whole new paragraph regarding children and <br/>
learning to spell.  I&#39;ll just make it short and sweet.  I went to school for <br/>
13 years and was an honors student but can&#39;t spell.  Just by typing away <br/>
daily and using spell-check...I&#39;m getting it (but then again...what is <br/>
&#39;getting it&#39; anyway).  heehee</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219861909">-=-So, if I am being and doing all this for her then<br/>

Expectations of a magical unschooling life are just that...expectations.<br/>
Expectations are set-ups with little trap doors waiting to snatch  <br/>
Sorscha<br/>
up. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Or to snatch you away from her, or to snatch your joy and peace away  <br/>
so that you&#39;re more separate.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who are sure they need to avoid &quot;compromise&quot; or who are  <br/>
themselves needy of attention and freedom and choices probably had  <br/>
children too early, before they themselves were ready to be parents.<br/>
<br/>
So what happens at that point?  They  need to buck up and stop  <br/>
whining and GET GROWN.  Kids can&#39;t wait forever for their moms to  <br/>
grow out of their angst.  If for whatever reason a mom has a child  <br/>
and the mom wants to do what&#39;s good for that child (even to the  <br/>
extent of unschooling), she&#39;s going to *have* to make some  <br/>
sacrifices.  She can sacrifice some of her whims and desires and  <br/>
fantasies, or she can just go straight to sacrificing any hope of a  <br/>
longterm close relationship with that child.<br/>
<br/>
Really, honestly, there are lots, and tons, of unschooling moms who  <br/>
started off angsty and whiney and blaming their kids for their own  <br/>
mom-lives not being like magazine articles, and then when they TRULY,  <br/>
really, simply started living with their children, playing with their  <br/>
children, talking with their children, eating what and where their  <br/>
kids wanted to eat instead of trying to mold their kids into  <br/>
miniature-yet-better versions of themselves, THEN they started  <br/>
finding happiness, and found they had things to rejoice about instead  <br/>
of whining, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The chance for happiness is right between you and your child, it&#39;s  <br/>
right in you, only you need to get yourself right next to your child,  <br/>
so the &quot;between&quot; is not so big.   You become one with your child and  <br/>
there will be enough happiness to envelope you both.<br/>
