&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t like the idea of coercion but I also don&#39;t like the idea of <br/>
doing all the work myself and feeling resentful for a lack of help from <br/>
other household members who are perfectly capable of participating.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to change your attitude and lost the resentment, not have to do <br/>
all the work yourself, and stop thinking of your children as &quot;perfectly <br/>
capable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of those phrases that only comes out in the critical mom voice.  <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re perfectly capable of [doing your own laundry, whatever all...].<br/>
<br/>
There are things I am perfectly capable of doing that my husband does for me, <br/>
and vice versa.  It&#39;s not that I couldn&#39;t do it.  It&#39;s that he can do it <br/>
better, or enjoys it more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s part of being loving toward one another.  If he dies, I will start <br/>
pumping my own gas, getting a chair to get up into the high cabinets (if my tall <br/>
sons have moved away then), and I&#39;ll keep a rubber glove around to help with <br/>
opening the new jars that he can open so easily.   <br/>
<br/>
If I die he will take care of all his own laundry, and clean the toilet, and <br/>
probably figure out some clever way to take care of cat litter.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a TCS or non-coercion topic.  It&#39;s a living peacefully with children <br/>
topic, which has come up on a couple of lists and at unschooling.com over the <br/>
years, and I&#39;ve collected some of the best bits here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913421955">In reading your email I wondered, when you say &#39;require&#39; is there a<br/>
punishment attached to that?  i.e. if you don&#39;t cook dinner, do the<br/>
laundry, etc.  you can&#39;t ______?   I tend to use a variation of the golden<br/>
rule as a litmus test.  Would I like the words said to me, would I say the<br/>
words to my spouse, friend, neighbor?  I think about how I would feel if<br/>
say my spouse said &#39;if you don&#39;t cook you can&#39;t use the computer.&#39;  That<br/>
wouldn&#39;t really go over well :)   If however, he said he had been traveling<br/>
and eating take out for a week and would love my famous whatever dish, then<br/>
I would be WAY more inclined to cook.  There is no threat, just information<br/>
and I know that if I said, you know what I just don&#39;t want to tonight, he<br/>
would be fine with it.  That is what I want to model for my children.  <br/>
<br/>
As for feeling resentment - when I have felt this way  I realize it is all<br/>
about me.  No one is trying to make my life miserable it is all in how *I*<br/>
am choosing to look at it.   We have gotten really good at sharing our<br/>
feelings about things.  I&#39;ve found we really do want to help each other.  <br/>
I&#39;m also able to reframe things.  For example, cleaning up toys is not a<br/>
hassle it is creating a blank canvas for my dds to create new adventures. <br/>
It is a gift for them and for me.  I don&#39;t have to look at it as a chore. <br/>
Now that doesn&#39;t mean I do it every day :) but when I do I don&#39;t feel<br/>
resentment about it and I don&#39;t feel the need to threaten them to it.  <br/>
Cooking is a gift for my family, when I want to do it, it&#39;s great, when I<br/>
don&#39;t we eat leftovers, take out, something simple whatever.  No one tries<br/>
to make me feel like I should be doing more or that I&#39;m not contributing<br/>
enough.  I&#39;ve found if we are all clear about how we are feeling and what<br/>
we need  - our needs really get met.   I think that works because we are<br/>
all on equal footing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020943878">This is a very timely topic for me.  I&#39;m reading and learning and have <br/>
to admit that while I&#39;ve come a million miles in the last 18 months as <br/>
far as being a better parent, friend and guide to my children, I coerce <br/>
my children fairly often about a lot of little things.  Like the parents <br/>
who never question whether or not they should send their children to <br/>
school, coercion is so ingrained from my childhood that I wasn&#39;t even <br/>
really aware of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my parents started a huge fight with my dh and we&#39;re all now <br/>
at a standstill...and really all because of coercion.  Yesterday my <br/>
parents finally came across a person that could only be coerced for so <br/>
long before he stood up for himself...and believe me, they didn&#39;t like <br/>
it.  The fight was so bad that I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll even have a <br/>
relationship with them anymore.  It&#39;s very sad and at the same time very <br/>
freeing and eye-opening.  Coercion on small occassions may seem like no <br/>
big deal, but in truth it&#39;s no different than verbal abuse and over a <br/>
long time, it can do a tremendous amout of mental damage.  I can see <br/>
this quite clearly now.<br/>
<br/>
So while this is a hard time for my family, thanks to all of you and the <br/>

person for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651937993">Yes, when I realized what an abusive parent-child relationship I had <br/>
growing up, it was scary. I THOUGHT it was me! I was TOLD it was <br/>
because of my behavior that I had these consequences...<br/>
<br/>
The patterns of coercion are difficult to see within the moments of <br/>
ones life. It is only when I realized there WAS a pattern of repeated <br/>
use of coercion was I able to see how ingrained and abusive that was. <br/>
The fact that I believed that I had to or was made to do things was <br/>
assumed. I didn&#39;t question it within the relationship with my <br/>
parents. They loved me. So it must be me, not the process of relating <br/>
that was dysfunctional.<br/>
<br/>
One has to be able to see that it is not the events of coercion that <br/>
is the issue so much as the PATTERN of forcing someone do something <br/>
that they do not want to do. As Sandra said coercion stays the same. <br/>
<br/>
Abuse is when there is no recourse to avoid the coercion over time. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck. Personally, I realized that each of my parents actually <br/>
had different roles in the coercive relationship. My father has been <br/>
unable to see that I perceive his behavior to still be coercive. He <br/>
believes that I have responsibilities and obligations to him and his <br/>
expectations. Not choices. Fortunately, he can no longer force me to <br/>
comply. We no longer have an abusive relationship. Sometimes all you <br/>
can do is leave the abusive relationship if it won&#39;t change. It is <br/>
very empowering to leave an abusive relationship. <br/>
<br/>
I can celebrate that my son can retain his self-determination and <br/>
self-value since he won&#39;t be in a relationship with a pattern of <br/>
coercion with his parents.<br/>
