<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116452426">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
We are in our second year of Life Learning.<br/>
<br/>
I let my oldest DD, (now 7yrs), go to public kindergarten, when she <br/>
was 5yrs, in 2005. I regretted it almost every day she was there. <br/>
When her personal safety was placed in jeapordy, right in front of my <br/>
eyes, that was when my decision to keep her out of the public school <br/>
system, was locked in place.<br/>
<br/>
Since our &quot;Life Learning&quot; journey began, it&#39;s as if our new lives <br/>
began. I feel as though it is not only my two daughters who are <br/>
learning, (7 & 2), but also I am learning/growing, right along with <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
I despise everything about public schooling. The <br/>
testing/labeling/grading/monitoring/confining/humiliation/bullying/cli<br/>
ques/failing/etc.! I want my children to have a better life! Public <br/>
schooling hinders that in every way.<br/>
<br/>
Though we are registered with a Homeschool board,(we have to in our <br/>
province), I chose the &quot;Parent Directed&quot; program, this year. In our <br/>
first year,/06, I chose the &quot;50% Teacher/50% Parent&quot; program. I found <br/>
it to be more &quot;monitored&quot; than I first thought. Along with working <br/>
with &quot;workbooks&quot; and having to fax my daughters finished work to the <br/>
teacher, (small amount at each months end), my DD and I both ended up <br/>
feeling &quot;burnt out&quot; within a few months. Hence my choice for the 100% <br/>
Parent Directed, basically &quot;Unschooling&quot;, as we can do whatever MY <br/>
DAUGHTER CHOOSES. That is what I want for both my DD&#39;s. &quot;LIFE <br/>
LEARNING&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
We only just moved to our new town a few months ago, but we are <br/>
already linked up with the HS group out here. We just met a bunch of <br/>
Mom&#39;s and their kids yesterday actually, when we all went to the <br/>
local Recreation Center, which has a HS Gym time alloted, 3 days of <br/>
the week. We already know we&#39;ll be going to the gym,as well as  <br/>
swimming/skating, and other events we&#39;ll be planning.But they will be <br/>
events our children want to go to/do, not OUR choices, without their <br/>
input.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was getting squirrely, regarding our <br/>
childrens &quot;socilization&quot; issue. It&#39;s not an issue for ME, just for <br/>
HIM. He&#39;s not 100% WITH me on the whole &quot;Life Learning&quot; choice, as he <br/>
thinks,(he&#39;s deluded and in denial) that HE, &quot;didn&#39;t have any <br/>
problems in public school&quot;. Really honey? Than why were you and your <br/>
friends always taking off from class, to go DRINKING ,(we&#39;re talking <br/>
High School here),in YOUR car, (as you were one year older because of <br/>
FAILING a grade), and WHERE are all your &quot;Freinds&quot; now? Not a one to <br/>
be found. So your &quot;socialization&quot; arguement, in one that you are <br/>
having, only with YOURSELF. <br/>
<br/>
I am 100% fine and having NO DOUBTS, that keeping my children out of <br/>
the PS system, is the BEST CHOICE. For them, and for me. I have to <br/>
say for me as well, because if I was the kind of woman who allowed my <br/>
husband to make our childrens education choice, I would be the one <br/>
doing all the work, while sitting at home ANXIOUS & WORRIED for my <br/>
childrens safety/protection/learning, every day! <br/>
<br/>
Everyday in our house, is now an ADVENTURE! We wake up, when WE want <br/>
to, not when SOCIETY or a Public School system tells us we HAVE to. <br/>
We have our breakfast, which we take the time to enjoy, no &quot;wolfing <br/>
it down&quot; and running down the street to get to &quot;class on time&quot;. (We <br/>
live just two blocks from the elementary school by the way. NO, <br/>
living two blocks from the PS, is NOT a GOOD ENOUGH REASON, to put my <br/>
children, in Public School! We also live behind a car dealership. So <br/>
you obviously bought your car from there, right? The liquor store is <br/>
right next to that car dealership. So you must be going there 5 times <br/>
a week, right? Well I DIDN&#39;T and I WON&#39;T!).It&#39;s about CHOICES people!<br/>
<br/>
After breakfast, I ask my oldest what SHE is feeling interested in <br/>
learning about/doing today. She&#39;s a big dinosaur fan right now. And <br/>
even though my husband thinks she&#39;s &quot;too obsessed&quot; with the &quot;Teenage <br/>
Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, he just bought her the new movie, (on DVD), <br/>
just yesterday. She&#39;s still learning honey!<br/>
<br/>
I am an avid reader/researcher, of John Holt. As well, I think Sandra <br/>
Dodd & Joyce Fetterol,(hope I spelled that right), are the most <br/>
amazing women/Mom&#39;s. I read through both of Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s <br/>
websites, regularly. I also believe in Jan Hunts view of &quot;Respectful <br/>
Parenting&quot;. (Currently working on being less of an &quot;Ole Yeller&quot;. <br/>
Didn&#39;t say I was perfect).<br/>
<br/>
My two DD&#39;s protection are the most important issue to me. Reason <br/>
being, is that my oldest DD&#39;s twin sister, died in my 29th week of <br/>
pregnancy, in 2000. My surviving DD, was born at 35wks, and had to <br/>
stay in the Neo-Natal unit, for the first 3 days of her life, due to <br/>
breathing issues. (She is perfectly healthy in EVERY way now!). I <br/>
then had three early miscarriages,in /02/03/04. I then gave birth to <br/>
my second DD, in Sept/05, only after taking medication for the first <br/>
3 months of my PG, so as to not lose her as well. She is perfectly <br/>
healthy as well. All thanks to GOD! <br/>
<br/>
I am protective of my two DD&#39;s, because of the above reasons. My <br/>
children are my greatest gifts from God. I am honored, to be their <br/>
Mommy. I believe, that being a Mother, is what I was born to be.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to reading/posting within this board!<br/>
<br/>
Bless you all!<br/>
