<div id="ygrps-yiv-320056756">Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one&#39;s courage.<br/>
<br/>
~Anais Nin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This came from the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Quoteoftheweek@yahoogroups.com">Quoteoftheweek@yahoogroups.com</a> list.<br/>
Although she uses the word &quot;courage,&quot; it&#39;s what is discussed on this  <br/>
list sometimes about making life bigger, more sparkly, about living  <br/>
in the world, about creating a good nest.<br/>
<br/>
I think of it as confidence.  They&#39;re similar.  Confidence grows from  <br/>
the inside, though, while courage can be reckless.<br/>
<br/>
Marty Dodd, my middle child (who&#39;s 18 and so not much of a child  <br/>
anymore) is living in a big world.  I know that he&#39;s shy, and the  <br/>
ways that he&#39;s shy, but he&#39;s also confident, and some of the  <br/>
confidence comes from experience and feedback.  Learning.<br/>
<br/>
The feedback from school and in school is so very often discouraging  <br/>
and negative.  Even the &quot;best students&quot; keep being reminded that  <br/>
every school has top students and the competition&#39;s fierce.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about javelina&#39;s yesterday, my sister-in-law-of-sorts  <br/>
and Marty and me. Her grandfather had a javelina head mounted on the  <br/>
wall in his den and the grandkids were afraid of the whole room.  We  <br/>
were talking about how small they are, and how scary, and I&#39;ve never  <br/>
seen on in the wild and hope never to.  She&#39;s older and lives further  <br/>
south and has seen some.<br/>
<br/>
Javelinas are fierce.<br/>
Thoughts about going into the world and finding friends and jobs and  <br/>
opportunities shouldn&#39;t be thought of as &quot;fierce.&quot;  That isn&#39;t  <br/>
confidence building.   Schools claim to expand kids&#39; lives, but at  <br/>
the same time they specialize in shrinking them.  Kids who aren&#39;t  <br/>
&quot;good students,&quot; their lives start shrinking from the time they&#39;re  <br/>
six or seven.  They don&#39;t get courage or confidence.<br/>
<br/>
So when you&#39;re thinking about what unschooling can bring into your  <br/>
life, don&#39;t forget confidence, or courage.  And do things to build  <br/>
that, so your children&#39;s lives and worlds expand.<br/>
