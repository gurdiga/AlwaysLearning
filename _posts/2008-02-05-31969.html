Your kids might enjoy participating in post card exchange.  We did <br/>
it for a year or so, when my boys were exactly the same age as your <br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the yahoo! groups for post card exchange is &quot;postcardkids&quot;.  <br/>
I am sure there are others.  But that is the one we used and it was <br/>
great!<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569701805">Flat traveling is a fun way to learn about different places.  Check out flat travelers homeschool @ yahoo groups.  We have been doing it for a year now.  You make a flat person(paper person) and send it to another family.  They treat this person as a guest in their home.  After a few weeks they send them home with photos, goodies, info about where they live etc.  The idea came from the book Flat Stanley.<br/>

The post card exchanges should be used more as a  math puzzle than  <br/>
geography.  Look at population.  Every participant in California,  <br/>
Texas and New York wants a post card from New Mexico.   (And Wyoming,  <br/>
and Idaho, and...) That means it&#39;s Very Expensive for those in states  <br/>
with a population smaller than many cities you haven&#39;t even heard  <br/>
of.  At some point the people in New Mexico (speaking from  <br/>
experience) have WAY too many from big states, and people are getting  <br/>
grouchy at them for not hurrying up and fulfilling their obligation.<br/>
<br/>
Post cards used to be a penny for the card and a penny for the stamp,  <br/>
and so they are considered in people&#39;s imaginations to be cheap.   <br/>
Check again.  VERY, very expensive.  A post card project will cost  <br/>
someone at least $25 and double or quadruple that if you&#39;re from a  <br/>
small state.<br/>
<br/>
A map of your town with things marked (WRITE on it; it&#39;s just a map-- <br/>
they get outdated every few years anyways) so the kids can see where  <br/>
the store is, where dad works, which road out of town goes toward  <br/>
grandma&#39;s, whatever.... that&#39;s probably more helpful than anything,  <br/>
for starters.<br/>
<br/>
But my oldest learned how to read maps from playing a video game that  <br/>
had a player&#39;s guide that had a map of the whole game.  Once he could  <br/>
follow that map, other maps were easy!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe make a map of your house and yard.<br/>
<br/>
We used to draw a map of a city park (various different ones), put it  <br/>
in a see-through plastic folder, bury a toy (some fast-food toy) or  <br/>
hide it, and mark the spot on the map with crayon or a sticker so it  <br/>
can be moved for the next round.  You could hide several things, and  <br/>
then let the kids take a turn and try to mark the right place on the  <br/>
map (have a big kid or adult to help, if they&#39;re very little).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667506469">We just got this game for Christmas from grandma.  Haven&#39;t played it  <br/>
yet, but I was happy we got it, because it&#39;s by an author who wrote  <br/>
another book my middle daughter really enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
The Scrambled States of America Game<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s based on the book by the same name by Laurie Keller, who&#39;s got a  <br/>
silly sort of illustration style.  Her other book is Grandpa  <br/>
Gazillion&#39;s Number Yard (or something close to that).  I think it&#39;s a  <br/>
matching concept, and has nicknames, but not sure if it&#39;s got more  <br/>
info than that on the cards.  It says &quot;whimsical, mad-dashing  <br/>
geography game&quot; on the cover, so it&#39;s probably more geared toward fun  <br/>
and high level state shape recognition.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, we&#39;ve printed out mapquest maps of our routine trip from  <br/>
Chicago to Iowa, and the kids are always eager to see how close we  <br/>
are to the Mississippi River, and we note the cities and landmarks  <br/>
along the way.  Probably anything you do can be Mapquested.<br/>
<br/>
How about Google Earth?  It&#39;s kind of another interesting way to  <br/>
orient to things.  We have a friend from Poland who we were recently  <br/>
trying to see if we could find her town, and it&#39;s just kind of cool  <br/>
to see how Google Earth jumps from your town up into the sky and  <br/>
around the globe to another place.<br/>
<br/>
I also just pick up the globe all the time, when we are talking about  <br/>
anything that is not where we are.  It&#39;s low-tech and not a game, but  <br/>
it floats around our house from place to place, and gets picked up  <br/>
and referenced when it makes sense (I&#39;m actually quite horrible at  <br/>
geography); just recently we were playing Pirates of the Caribbean&#39;s  <br/>
online game, and looking at the Caribbean.  So many things come up in  <br/>
conversation now, with a 9, 6 and 3yo, that we can often trace  <br/>
something across the globe.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>
Kelly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707759695">We really enjoy a game called &quot;Five-State Rummy,&quot; put out by School <br/>
Zone. I got it at Borders, and it&#39;s the sort of flash card-ish thing <br/>
that should be easy to find. Your goal is to get 5 states that touch <br/>
each other in some way. Each state card also shows the state bird and <br/>
flower. There&#39;s not a lot of depth to it but is quick fun and <br/>
portable. I will be totally honest and admit that only Mom and Dad <br/>
have played so far, since our baby is too little, but I think I would <br/>
have liked it. I just don&#39;t know how young.<br/>
<br/>
For that geography & that age range, I LOVE LOVE LOVE 3 books: <br/>
Scrambled States of America, Children Like Me by B&A Kindersley, and <br/>
Throw Your Tooth on the Roof. The last 2 can really make the <br/>
map/globe come alive. The last shows tooth fairy traditions all over <br/>
the world. When I taught 1st grade my students LOVED these books. <br/>
