<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521837961">This was on my local SCA mailing list, someone saying she had a basket of <br/>
books she would bring to events for children to use at events or borrow.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know the person, so I&#39;m guessing she works at a Christian school (she said <br/>
she works only in the mornings, and didn&#39;t say where), but it might be public.  <br/>
I was just interested in the criteria and choices:<br/>
<br/>
============================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These books were pulled from my school last year by the school board <br/>
<br/>
for being &quot;inappropriate,&quot; &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;presenting a negative view <br/>
<br/>
of Christianity.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Castle&quot; by David Macaulay Caldecott Honor hardback with dust jacket, <br/>
<br/>
donated to my school by the albuquerque public library.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fast Forward Castle&quot; by Peter Dennis hardback from a book fair<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the Time of Knights&quot; by Shelley Tanaka. Softcover biography of <br/>
<br/>
William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke. Also from a book fair.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Geoffrey Chaucer&#39;s Canterbury Tales,&quot; selected, translated and <br/>
<br/>
adapted for elementary children by Barbara Cohen. Hardback with dust <br/>
<br/>
jacket, donated to my school by the albuquerque public library.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Illuminations,&quot; by Jonathan Hunt. An ABC book. Hardback with dust <br/>
<br/>
jacket, donated to my school by the albuquerque public library.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind hauling &quot;loaner&quot; books around to events -- I am a born <br/>
<br/>
librarian after all -- but if anyone else has books to donate to the <br/>
<br/>
basket, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
=======================================================<br/>
<br/>
What WILL kids learn after the world has been sanitized for them?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty freaky.  There is not even anything in<br/>
there about evolution or sex, that I can see.  I<br/>
wonder what the objection was.  I mean, an alphabet<br/>
book?  Sheesh.  And violence?  What, the Bible doesn&#39;t<br/>
have any violence in it?<br/>
