&gt; this.  How much do they get (if you don&#39;t mind my asking)?  Did you <br/>
&gt; advise them ahead of time how to spend it or just let them learn the <br/>
&gt; hard way.  Do you have any rules about what they can&#39;t buy?<br/>

Whenever I give the twins (who have 12 days left of being 11) money to <br/>
purchase anything, food or otherwise, I only remind them that the amount they have <br/>
is the amount they have, no more. If they choose to spend a little and save the <br/>
rest, cool. If they choose to use every cent, cool.<br/>
<br/>
Kree recently bought a new knife at the knife shop in our local mall. She had <br/>
$20. She looked at several knives and decided to buy the smaller of the two <br/>
she liked the most. It was only $3 less than the bigger one. I asked why she <br/>
chose the small one, when the large one was not much more and she had enough <br/>
money for either one. She told me, that $3 was going to buy ice cream for her, <br/>
her sister and their cousin, when we got home from the mall. So she completely <br/>
chose how to spend every cent. She weighed what was important to her and she <br/>
made her decision based on her own wants and needs. <br/>
<br/>
The knife shop owner was suprised at the process. She took her time and you <br/>
could see her wheels turning the entire time. He asked why I let her not only <br/>
make up her mind without my input, but why I &quot;allowed&quot; her to buy a knife. <br/>
Instead of answering him, I questioned him back. &quot;Did you see her thought process <br/>
(which I knew he had since I watched him watch her)? Do you think she takes <br/>
ownership of this knife without serious contemplation? Why should I not &quot;allow&quot; <br/>
her to spend her money on what she wants?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The shop owner chuckled, and said, &quot;Well I think you are on to something <br/>
here, mom.&quot; So Kree walked away with her knife and a large grin, the shop owner <br/>
met a family where the kid had as much right to make decisions as an adult and I <br/>
walked away happy for them both.<br/>
