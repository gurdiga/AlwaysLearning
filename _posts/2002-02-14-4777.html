 </span></blockquote>I am in the same place as you right now Julie, with my<br/>
3 and 5 year old boys.  Add to that, lately they have<br/>
not wanted to set foot outside.  They are very active,<br/>
but I cannot even convince them to get out of the<br/>
house right now.  They are on a very homebody cycle<br/>
and it is frustrating to me.  I feel like a hermit.  I<br/>
know that as active as they are, they will eventually<br/>
decide to get out and about more, but for now it is a<br/>
big deal to try and get them up and out for anything. <br/>
It may be nesting sort of thing after selling our<br/>
house and moving 1,000 miles last fall, but here we<br/>
are.  I am trying to concentrate on indoor activites<br/>
for myself, until they are ready to join the world<br/>
again, and to not be out of control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43633114">I was really taken by surprise when Brit dropped all of her activities in <br/>
the fall -- she&#39;s always been such a social butterfly, and eager to join in<br/>
every possible thing, it was a shock! :) But, she obviously really needed<br/>
the break, and has just started adding a couple of things back in the past<br/>
month or so.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey, OTOH, has had little interest in leaving the house since birth &lt;g&gt;<br/>
and shows no immediate signs of changing her mind. I suppose I should brace<br/>
myself for a sudden flurry of join-everything from her one of these years...<br/>
