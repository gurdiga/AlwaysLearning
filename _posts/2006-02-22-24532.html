<div id="ygrps-yiv-519119042">Hi All, <br/>
<br/>
I am Laura. I am a christian unschooler. I have been married 11 <br/>
years as of this last saturday! We live in Oklahoma City. I am <br/>
originally from Oklahoma, but just got home in December from a two <br/>
year move in the Houston, TX area. I have been unschooling since the <br/>
beginning, although I didn&#39;t realize it until about 4 years ago. I <br/>
have 3 kids. I have a boy 8, girl 5, and a baby girl 1. I am so glad <br/>
to be a part of this awesome group! I have learned a lot already <br/>
from lurking.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine and I just started a new yahoo group tonight for <br/>
christian unschoolers in the OKC area. If any of you are here in <br/>
Oklahoma, please come and join us too on a local level! We are <br/>
wanting to get together with people that are in our area as well as <br/>
online! I look forward to being a part of this group! <br/>
