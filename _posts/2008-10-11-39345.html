<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707947200">I&#39;ve been asked to request input on a problem for someone requesting  <br/>
anonymity.  The names are false but the story is real.  (Kinda  <br/>
Dragnet-like, for those old enough to remember &quot;The story you&#39;re  <br/>
about to hear is real...&quot;)<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I have a son who has been making friends with new kids, lately. One  <br/>
of which, he&#39;s exchanged e-mails with. Susie and my son Sam have  <br/>
things in common personality-wise and interest-wise and have decided  <br/>
through their e-mail conversations, that they&#39;d like to get together  <br/>
and work on an art project together. They see each other once a week  <br/>
at a local homeschool activity (physical) that&#39;s structured, but they  <br/>
do have bits of time to talk during it.<br/>
<br/>
After the activity this week, in the course of conversation about  <br/>
when and where we could meet to work on the art project, Sam said  <br/>
that he wasn&#39;t sure he liked Susie any more and sounded quite  <br/>
disappointed. When I asked him about it, he said that Susie was  <br/>
calling another one of his friends, Joey, participating in the group  <br/>
activity, &quot;Miss Joey&quot; in a teasing way, and that Joey was *very*  <br/>
upset by it. I suggested that if I were someone like Susie, who  <br/>
wanted to be his friend, I would rather someone say that they didn&#39;t  <br/>
like something I was doing, rather than just stop talking to me and  <br/>
hanging out with me. We talked about what he could say and how he  <br/>
could say it and the different options about where he could talk to  <br/>
her (in private or in front of the group) and he took that all in and  <br/>
seemed to be mulling over his options.<br/>
<br/>
That evening, I was at a gathering of homeschool parents and was  <br/>
talking about Sam and Susie&#39;s growing friendship and recounting how I  <br/>
had talked to Sam about things - more in the vein of &quot;this is a cool  <br/>
thing I could talk over with my kid rather than taking the situation  <br/>
out of his hands and handling it myself&quot; than anything else. The mom  <br/>
I was talking to has a child, Pat, in the class, too, who is friends  <br/>
with Joey, and said that Susie had done the same thing at the  <br/>
activity last week and that Pat and Joe had come to their moms  <br/>
(relaxed homeschoolers) saying what had happened and the moms had  <br/>
kind of said it was likely Susie goofing off and trying to be funny.  <br/>
She also said that the two of them hadn&#39;t said anything about it  <br/>
after the activity today, so that they might not have heard it or it  <br/>
was not a big deal any more. That was *not* Sam&#39;s take on things:  <br/>
Joey seemed quite upset to Sam.<br/>
<br/>
There was a mom, Mary (NOT Susie&#39;s mom, but the mother of an  <br/>
Asperger&#39;s labeled child), nearby who overheard what was going on and  <br/>
spoke up, saying, &quot;You know, Susie has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. That&#39;s  <br/>
just how she is, she&#39;s trying to joke around with the kids and thinks  <br/>
she&#39;s being funny. If one of the kids says something to her, it&#39;s  <br/>
just going to get worse. If you tell her mom, she&#39;ll HANDLE it.&quot;  I  <br/>
took from the way she said &quot;handle it&quot; that Susie was either going to  <br/>
get a severe dressing down or physically punished. Mary is a gossip  <br/>
and kind of twists things in the retelling to make conflict, so I&#39;m  <br/>
not too happy she overheard this and took it out of context, but the  <br/>
real problem is how do I handle it, now?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be the cause of Susie getting laid into, nor start  <br/>
out a relationship with this new mom I don&#39;t know yet with stories of  <br/>
her daughter&#39;s &quot;misbehavior&quot;. On one hand, if that story hadn&#39;t come  <br/>
up at that moment where it was overheard, we&#39;d never have known about<br/>
<br/>
Susie&#39;s label and this supposed conflict with what I&#39;d talked over  <br/>
with my son. If we&#39;d just have met her in the park while her mom was  <br/>
off somewhere, I wouldn&#39;t have stopped to say, &quot;Okay, is this a non- <br/>
labeled kid who we can say something to or could this child possibly  <br/>
have a developmental disorder who can&#39;t hear something simple like,  <br/>
&#39;Hey, that&#39;s not cool.&#39;?&quot; On the other hand, if it is true that it  <br/>
will escalate her behavior (though I don&#39;t see how talking to her  <br/>
after the activity in private could transfer to it being worse a week  <br/>
later, with the description Mary gave - it seemed more of a &quot;in the  <br/>
moment&quot;/nervousness kind of thing), I don&#39;t want to put *any* of the  <br/>
kids in that situation. So, I&#39;m hoping to get some input here. Thanks.<br/>

My first thought is that any kid wether aspergers or not, if they are<br/>

it&#39;s indeed true that this girl is aspergers, she might not get subtle<br/>

<br/>
The best way that I know how to handle the situation is to try to keep<br/>
the moms uninvolved except for coaching, and let the son politely say<br/>

are emailing, perhaps he could write it out and send it via  email and<br/>
not have to do it in front of others or try to corner her privately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960836852">I like Jenny&#39;s email idea.  I think in general, having a big<br/>
conversation about it in front of the group makes it harder because<br/>
the child who&#39;s behavior is being criticized is embarrassed (labels or<br/>
not).<br/>
<br/>
If something happens again he could say something, but not make a big<br/>
deal about it or be very confrontational.  He could say something<br/>
short in a voice that was only slightly irritated if it happened<br/>
again, and I think that would be fine (knock it off, stop it, don&#39;t<br/>
say that etc.).  If he&#39;s already said something to her in email, he<br/>
could even try giving her a look first to see if that is enough to<br/>
stop her.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes when a child has Asperger&#39;s traits, the mom does too, to a  <br/>
lesser extent (in half a dozen to ten cases I could name but I  <br/>
won&#39;t).  I only know one set in which the mom is worse than the  <br/>
child, and it&#39;s not a homeschooling family.  The daughter (who is 31,  <br/>
neither my age nor Holly&#39;s) is marginally involved in my life and  <br/>
causes much trouble with zero remorse.  Very self-righteous and  <br/>
talkative and socially destructive.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes appealing to the mom won&#39;t help much.<br/>

Sorry, typo error. The &quot;but&quot; was not supposed to be there. <br/>
<br/>
But I also wanna say, I am kinda aspie myself LOL! So I am conscious <br/>
that sometimes I too can say the wrong thing and hurt someone&#39;s <br/>
feelings without realising it. It&#39;s un-intentional. It&#39;s just that I <br/>
can be very direct and matter of factly sort of person. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was young, I too then to give people cute  <br/>
nicknames, it&#39;s a sign of affection and closeness. But now that I&#39;m <br/>
older, I realised that it can be hurtful, and not funny at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this girl is like this. Maybe she&#39;s just showing affection and <br/>
her liking a person by giving them a &quot;cute name&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, it would be kind to made her aware that whatever she&#39;s <br/>
doing, it&#39;s not gaining her any affection. So in this sense, perhaps <br/>
speaking to the mother might be a good move, a fair move, because it <br/>
will be the mother&#39;s call to handle it anyhow she deem fit, isn&#39;t it? <br/>
The mother will also now how to handle it gentler because very often <br/>
when we&#39;re dealing with aspergers, we&#39;re also dealing with low self <br/>
esteem. <br/>
<br/>
If she decides not to do anything and reject your approach, then you <br/>
and your child should be allowed to do what is best for you guys, with <br/>
a clean conscience.  <br/>
<br/>
I would certainly make the effort to explain to my child why certain <br/>
action he thinks is funny, might not be classified as funny to others. <br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be fair to let him get on with it, and gain some very <br/>
unfavourable re-actions. <br/>
<br/>
All the best. <br/>

That too, though... It&#39;s not a choice a person gets to have, about  <br/>
her own life.  I can&#39;t demand that people give me feedback about my  <br/>

that people socialize with me or invite me to parties.  I can&#39;t  <br/>
demand that they not talk about me behind my back.<br/>
<br/>
People can live their own lives in the best way they can figure out  <br/>
to do it, and then deal with the responses.  That&#39;s the best anyone  <br/>
can do, as far as I know.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One way of looking at it is that your son doesn&#39;t enjoy her son&#39;s  <br/>
company.  Okay.  That&#39;s not something she or her son really have to  <br/>
deal with.  VERY many times parents *are* willing to help their  <br/>
children get along with other children, especially when they&#39;re  <br/>
involved in activities or they&#39;re relatives and it&#39;s good for the  <br/>
longterm peace of that other project.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be asking too much:  &quot;not interested in rectifying the  <br/>
problem&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes what one person sees as a problem isn&#39;t a problem to  <br/>
another person.  Just as &quot;it&#39;s only playing if everyone&#39;s playing,&quot;  <br/>
sometimes  it&#39;s only a problem if two people agree that it&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
One of my kids&#39; many young-adult friends was over here one night.   <br/>
Marty had been out to eat with him, and then Marty wanted to come  <br/>
home and go to bed.  They both came back to the house and talked a  <br/>
while and Marty said &quot;I need to sleep, I&#39;m going to bed&quot; and he did.   <br/>
The other friend should have left, but he started hanging out with  <br/>
Holly and her boyfriend.  After a while Holly wanted him to go home.   <br/>
He hadn&#39;t been invited, Marty had heavily hinted for him to leave,  <br/>
and he was being purposely dense because he just didn&#39;t want to go  <br/>
home to his own apartment and his own cat.  I do feel sorry for him,  <br/>
but Holly was home in her own house and minding her own business.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote to her the next day and said he would like to find a time to  <br/>
get together with Holly to discuss how she could be nicer to him in  <br/>
the future.  It pissed me off.  I talked to Holly and Marty both and  <br/>
reminded them that IF they bring someone into the house that&#39;s fine,  <br/>
but it&#39;s NOT fine to abandon the friend or foist them off on others.   <br/>
If someone comes in because of them, they need to hang out with that  <br/>
person and entertain them until they time they walk them back out the  <br/>
door.   I was willing to tell the friend myself that Holly has no  <br/>
obligation to be nice to him if he comes over uninvited by her and  <br/>
doesn&#39;t take any &quot;go home&quot; hints.  But Holly does like him and had  <br/>
already apologized and said she was tired and she was sorry she  <br/>
wasn&#39;t nicer.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this happen both ways.  I&#39;ve seen someone assume that her child was at fault, <br/>
when I was there and could see clearly that the other child was having problems and <br/>
precipitated the whole event.  And I&#39;ve seen people assume that it was the asperger&#39;s <br/>
child&#39;s fault because, well, of course it was &#39;cause that child is always &quot;bad.&quot;  Just one <br/>
problem with labels.<br/>
<br/>
And I would seriously appreciate being inform about it, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rather than have people isolating us and talking behind my child&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had people tell me that up front in a friendship, yet when I or another friend has <br/>
attempted to talk about a problem, it was quickly apparent it wasn&#39;t true--with multiple <br/>
people.  My experience has been that most people don&#39;t really want to be told when their <br/>
children aren&#39;t charming, but they will say they do, because the always want to be <br/>
&quot;honest.&quot;  (There is a sarcastic tone that may not have come across in my e-mail--LOL)  <br/>
<br/>
And the way something is &quot;told&quot; can make all the difference, as well as how many times <br/>
they&#39;ve been told lately, how they are feeling in the moment, whether they feel safe in a <br/>
social situation, etc.  It&#39;s not necessarily a simple thing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

coming across a little too critically--I don&#39;t know.  But it still seems clear to me that the <br/>
original poster wasn&#39;t there and it&#39;s still second-hand information to her.  It didn&#39;t happen <br/>
to her son, so the focus should be on what did happen to her son, which is that he didn&#39;t <br/>
like seeing the girl being mean to his friend.  This seems like one, to me, that&#39;s between <br/>
the kids, and mom&#39;s job is to support her son, not intervene between this girl and the <br/>
other boy after-the-fact.<br/>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
A little bit off topic, bt I would like to response to Joanna. <br/>
<br/>
No. Just because my kid&#39;s got asperger, it does not automatically mean <br/>
it&#39;s his fault. On contrary, I have work very hard at un-tangling <br/>
the &quot;it&#39;s always my fault&quot; mentality that we have to deal with 21 <br/>
months ago. Like I said, when we&#39;re dealing with asperger, it is quite <br/>
commonly we&#39;re dealing with low self esteem issues, especially if the <br/>
child been taken out of school. <br/>
<br/>
I always believe there&#39;s 2 side to a story. Which is why I always seek <br/>
to listen to both side. So if a parent comes to me, I&#39;ve heard herside <br/>
first. Then I&#39;ll go hear my son&#39;s version. This provide me a good <br/>
picture of what happened. For me, a valuable opportunity for me to <br/>
understand my son&#39;s individual way of thinking, and also a chance to <br/>
help him understand and manage this complex world of social do&#39;s and <br/>
don&#39;t. Or if he comes to me first, then I&#39;ll approach the other <br/>
parent, seeking her child&#39;s side fo the story. <br/>
<br/>
Either way, it&#39;s always a little mis-understanding that, with a little <br/>
insight and explanation, very easily explained.    <br/>
<br/>
In my case, an apology is always in the air - either we&#39;re expecting <br/>
it (and rarely getting it LOL!), or we&#39;re the ones offering it. <br/>
<br/>
To me, saying sorry is not necessary about admitting we&#39;re wrong or <br/>
acknowledging faults. Saying sorry is about acknowledging that someone <br/>
feelings has been hurt. Such a simple word, but yet so effective in <br/>
dispersing any tension and heartache there is. <br/>
<br/>
But Sandra is right. I cannot expect other people to be tell me <br/>
anything. I cannot expect people to think like me. Sorry might be such <br/>
a simple and healing word to me, but to some other&#39;s it might mean <br/>
alot more. <br/>
<br/>
So in my case, as and when my kid is innocent and the other parent do <br/>
not acknowledge it and not offer the healing word of sorry, I always <br/>
tell my son &quot;I&#39;m sorry the other mummy didn&#39;t believe you, but it&#39;s ok <br/>
because I do&quot;. He&#39;s learnt that by saying sorry, he&#39;s capable of <br/>
healing another person&#39;s heart. But if he doesn&#39;t receive it, it&#39;s ok <br/>
too. It&#39;s NOT because he&#39;s at fault but only because the other party <br/>
is uncomfortable giving it. And he&#39;s happy, and life moves on.   <br/>
<br/>
I cannot expect poeple to reciprocate the way I do, and I don&#39;t. But <br/>
foolish me still go on hoping and expecting &lt;BWG&gt; !<br/>
<br/>
Have a lovely day everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028530968">&quot; There was a mom, Mary (NOT Susie&#39;s mom, but the mother of an<br/>
Asperger&#39;s labeled child), nearby who overheard what was going on and<br/>
spoke up, saying, &quot;You know, Susie has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. That&#39;s<br/>
just how she is, she&#39;s trying to joke around with the kids and thinks<br/>
she&#39;s being funny. If one of the kids says something to her, it&#39;s<br/>
just going to get worse. If you tell her mom, she&#39;ll HANDLE it.&quot; I<br/>
took from the way she said &quot;handle it&quot; that Susie was either going to<br/>
get a severe dressing down or physically punished. Mary is a gossip<br/>
and kind of twists things in the retelling to make conflict, so I&#39;m<br/>
not too happy she overheard this and took it out of context, but the<br/>
real problem is how do I handle it, now?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be the cause of Susie getting laid into&quot; <br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
My earlier response was meant for the above. The asperger condition <br/>
was supposedly established. Hence I am responding from an asperger <br/>
mum&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Despite Mary being a nosy eves-dropper, she is right, from my view of <br/>
a mother to an asperger child. <br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;Handle&quot; would mean we know how to talk to our asperger child <br/>
about certain things, without denting thier self esteem or compounding <br/>
more worries onto the child. We also know how far to push our child&#39;s <br/>
button without them re-acting negatively, agressively or depressively, <br/>
causing lots of meltdowns and insercurities. <br/>
<br/>
This is what Mary is saying &quot;If one of the kids says something to her, <br/>
it&#39;s just going to get worse.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What Mary is saying is there is a chance Susie will speed up her <br/>
nicknames calling when she&#39;s stressed, knowing that she&#39;s annoyed the <br/>
other children and is potentially losing the friendship. But yet is <br/>
unable to break the vicious cycle of needing to keep retreating back <br/>
into the comfort of the action of nicknames calling, trying to hang <br/>
onto the established grounds of friendship that she&#39;s made. <br/>
<br/>
In another word, she doesn&#39;t know how to stop doing it. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote earlier that the possiblity she&#39;s progressed to nicknames as a <br/>
sign of affection. So she might ply more nicknames, thinking <br/>
being &quot;funny&quot; is a good way to establish friendship and effections. <br/>
<br/>
When her mum &quot;Handles&quot; it, the mother will know how to point out and <br/>
explain to Susie that she&#39;s already made that friendship bond. But <br/>
now, she potentially losing this friendship by nicknames calling. The <br/>
mother will then point out to Susie that nicknames calling to her is <br/>
funny, but to others it&#39;s call &quot;hurting&quot;.  The mother and Susis will <br/>
then have to work on a friendly tactic and a more nurturing approach, <br/>
to the friendship.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that Susis&#39; mom will not &quot;lay into her&quot; because I don&#39;t <br/>
know her. Maybe the poster have a more first hand observation of <br/>
Susie&#39;s mum, whether she&#39;s the type that will give Susie a severe <br/>
dressing down, or maybe the mother is the type who&#39;s kind and <br/>
protective of her daughter. I have yet to meet any mum with <br/>
a &quot;diagnosed asperger condition&quot; child who will get offended if <br/>
approach about thier child&#39;s un-welcome behaviour. If anything, we <br/>
aspie mum&#39;s do understand and will strive to help make it an easier <br/>
world for our children and everyone concern. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying or defending that the label entitle us or our children <br/>
to behaving differently, but the &quot;differentness&quot; in an asperger <br/>
child&#39;s mind is very real, and what they perceived to be normal and <br/>
funny, is distinctly different to ours. They are also very narrow <br/>
focus minded to a point of obliviousness, so it will help the child <br/>
when the parents points out many different emotions and actions <br/>
possible, outside thier very limited one track minds. <br/>
<br/>
So maybe the poster need to establish if the child is really with the <br/>
asperger condition or not before taking it further? <br/>
<br/>
Again, I do understand what Sandra wrote about people is not obligated <br/>
to do anything for other people. But then if you saw someone in a <br/>
wheel chair trying to get up the hill, wouldn&#39;t you offer a helping <br/>
hand along the way?  Having asperger is just as disabling, but <br/>
unfortunately it&#39;s not as visible as a wheel chair or walking stick. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>
<br/>

In a message dated 10/11/2008 5:43:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Always Learning <br/>
writes:<br/>
<br/>
-=-And I would seriously appreciate being inform about it, rather <br/>
than have people isolating us and talking behind my child&#39;s back. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s exactly why I posted it anonymously, so that anyone who might happen upon it <br/>
(however unlikely) that was there would not think I was spreading stories all over the <br/>
internet. I wanted some input on how to help *my* child deal with the situation in which <br/>
he was uncomfortable, and he was uncomfortable for both of his friends. Hopefully, the <br/>
girl will go to her mother, as my child came to me, to discuss things once my son has <br/>
dealt with things in his own way.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-=-But I also wanna say, I am kinda aspie myself LOL! So I am conscious <br/>
that sometimes I too can say the wrong thing and hurt someone&#39;s <br/>
feelings without realising it. It&#39;s un-intentional. It&#39;s just that I <br/>
can be very direct and matter of factly sort of person. -=-<br/>
So, then does your husband expect to be told about it? Does he appreciate being told <br/>
about it rather than have people talk behind your back?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to talk behind anyone&#39;s back, I&#39;m trying to find the kindest way to help my <br/>
son deal with something that is making at least 3 other people uncomfortable. He&#39;s fairly <br/>
used to negotiating between friends and aquaintences when there are disagreements and <br/>
such, but he&#39;s not really been around a situation where there&#39;s &quot;name calling&quot;, <br/>
embarrassment and hurt feelings.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-In my opinion, it would be kind to made her aware that whatever she&#39;s <br/>
doing, it&#39;s not gaining her any affection. So in this sense, perhaps <br/>
speaking to the mother might be a good move, a fair move, because it <br/>
will be the mother&#39;s call to handle it anyhow she deem fit, isn&#39;t it? -=-<br/>
I don&#39;t see how that will help my son or the girl in other situations or in places where <br/>
there isn&#39;t a parent to tell. Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is about-helping our kids <br/>
understand and deal with the world as it comes when they&#39;re ready for it?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-The mother will also now how to handle it gentler because very often <br/>
when we&#39;re dealing with aspergers, we&#39;re also dealing with low self <br/>
esteem. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My son cannot be gentle or gentle &quot;enough&quot; because he doesn&#39;t have a child with <br/>
Aspergers? He has other friends with Aspergers and I haven&#39;t had any mention from them <br/>
or their parents that my son cannot be &quot;gentle enough&quot; with their feelings. It would seem <br/>
to me that coming to me about hurt feelings all around and not saying something to the <br/>
girl before he talked with me would indicate a pretty big need to be gentle with other <br/>
people&#39;s feelings.<br/>
 <br/>
With my son (and maybe with other kids), going to a parent with &quot;an issue&quot; tends to give it <br/>
more weight-make it A Problem rather than just &quot;a bump&quot; that can be managed or <br/>
manuvered around. Needing a parent&#39;s involvement tends to give negative &quot;bad&quot; weight to <br/>
it as well. It just seems a lot easier, simpler, even kinder to let him give a casual comment <br/>
to her in private, after the activity, rather than to make a big issue out of it...</div>

<br/>
<br/>
This whole conversation is starting to bother me at a very deep level.<br/>
All mindful parents know how to handle situations with their child<br/>
without denting their self-esteem or compounding worries hopefully.<br/>
All this talk about &quot;aspie&quot; children being handled differently is<br/>
worrisome at an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
If we are to be mindful parents, we don&#39;t need to use labels so much<br/>
when describing our children. We would hopefully be in tune and aware<br/>
to the point that we are assisting ALL of our children when they need<br/>
us, regardless of their unique character traits and issues.<br/>
<br/>
Focusing so much on the Asperger&#39;s issue is harmful. A child in need,<br/>
is a child in need. With or without a label they need help in certain<br/>
social situations. We all have our quirks and traits that make<br/>
relationships and human interactions challenging at times. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551792304">-=-Like I said, when we&#39;re dealing with asperger, it is quite<br/>
commonly we&#39;re dealing with low self esteem issues, especially if the<br/>
child been taken out of school. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You mean, I think, especially if the child had once been in school?<br/>
<br/>
The taking out of school shouldn&#39;t be considered a cause of low self  <br/>
esteem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I always believe there&#39;s 2 side to a story. Which is why I always  <br/>
seek to listen to both side. So if a parent comes to me, I&#39;ve heard  <br/>
her side first. Then I&#39;ll go hear my son&#39;s version. This provide me a  <br/>
good picture of what happened.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That would be leaving out the account of the other child.  There are  <br/>
never only two sides to a story. If you think of it as aspects  <br/>
instead of sides, there are MANY aspects or facets of a story,  <br/>
involving the moods and reactions and circumstances and witnesses and  <br/>
history and possible future (are they both involved in an upcoming  <br/>
project?) and the effect on others...<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say I think every situation needs to be untangled to  <br/>
the end of all strings.  It can&#39;t be, and probably shouldn&#39;t be.   <br/>
Make one suggestion that will help next time and let it go, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For me, a valuable opportunity for me to<br/>
<br/>
understand my son&#39;s individual way of thinking, and also a chance to<br/>
help him understand and manage this complex world of social do&#39;s and<br/>
don&#39;t. Or if he comes to me first, then I&#39;ll approach the other<br/>
parent, seeking her child&#39;s side of the story. -=-<br/>
<br/>
A child shouldn&#39;t be required to relive a frustrating or confusing or  <br/>
hutful moment just so the mother of the other child can understand  <br/>
her own child better.    Sometimes, maybe, if the circumstances make  <br/>
it better for everyone, but RARELY should a situation need to be  <br/>
fully dissected and laid out to dry and documented like an  <br/>
archeological dig.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sorry might be such a simple and healing word to me, but to some  <br/>
other&#39;s it might mean alot more. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it means a lot less, when someone isn&#39;t really admitting  <br/>
wrong or acknowledging faults.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So in my case, as and when my kid is innocent and the other parent do<br/>
<br/>
not acknowledge it and not offer the healing word of sorry, I always<br/>
tell my son &quot;I&#39;m sorry the other mummy didn&#39;t believe you, but it&#39;s ok<br/>
because I do&quot;. He&#39;s learnt that by saying sorry, he&#39;s capable of<br/>
healing another person&#39;s heart. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Putting a salve on a situation isn&#39;t necessary healing a heart.   <br/>
Sorry is better than nothing, usually.  Maybe instead of seeing such  <br/>
situations (this example, the one from the anonymous mom, the one  <br/>
with the swimming pool in the apartments, the one with the theater  <br/>
try-outs...) as having innocence and truth and healing, it might be  <br/>
WAY better for moms to see ways to advise their children to be  <br/>
generous and compassionate and less antagonistic for the future.   <br/>
There will be other times.   &quot;Better&quot; is a better way to go than  <br/>
&quot;right.&quot;<br/>

I disagree with this analogy.  The wheel chair helps a child who  <br/>

<br/>
Better behavior will help children whose social skills aren&#39;t coming  <br/>
as naturally to them as they do to some other kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not okay for my kids to have to roll over and take abuse from  <br/>
kids because they&#39;ve been diagnosed ADD or aspergers or anything  <br/>
else.    I don&#39;t expect kids to all be expected to behave as well as  <br/>
the suavest of socially skilled kids.  I also don&#39;t expect anyone to  <br/>
hold up a label as a &quot;king&#39;s X&quot; in a social situation and say &quot;You&#39;re  <br/>
rude for not letting my kid be rude, because there&#39;s something wrong  <br/>
with him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that as parents, we should each be protecting our children  <br/>
from harm AND helping them learn not to be the causes of harm.<br/>

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people are replacing the idea of school with the idea of  <br/>
&quot;homeschooling play group&quot; (or, with apologies to Ren in this Blog  <br/>
Carnival month) &quot;tribe&quot; (which bugs me nineteen ways, or at least  <br/>
three).<br/>
<br/>
There is the undercurrent of an idea that unschoolers need to find  <br/>
other unschooling families and then their kids will live in  <br/>
unschooling paradise.  This can cause another whole set of problems.   <br/>
YES, sometimes families hit it off.  Sometimes playgroups last for  <br/>
*years* (ours here lasted six or seven good years, others have lasted  <br/>
longer, some don&#39;t last a year).  Sometimes a conference experience  <br/>
can be emotionally and spiritually transporting, but you can&#39;t live  <br/>
at a conference.  It&#39;s meant to give you good ideas you can take into  <br/>
your own daily life.  That&#39;s one reason I worry about the &quot;non com&quot;  <br/>
deals that don&#39;t have speakers.  Being where other people are being  <br/>
loose and free and sweet is great, but it can&#39;t happen in groups 24  <br/>
hours a day.  Somewhere in there people need to learn what&#39;s creating  <br/>
those relationships so they can have them at home, themselves, far  <br/>
from other unschoolers, on a Tuesday of a bad week, and not just wait  <br/>
for another chance to bask in the somewhat mysterious happiness of a  <br/>
big group of unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m preachin&#39; to the choir, because people here are on a serious  <br/>
unschooling discussion list, I know.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
There were complaints after the Live and Learn conference in St.  <br/>
Louis a few years ago, that it had been just like school because some  <br/>
of the girls already knew each other and so there were &quot;cliques.&quot;  It  <br/>
seemed to me the most just-like-school aspect of that was the idea  <br/>
that my daughter (any or every daughter) had to socialize with  <br/>
everyone equally, just because they were there, just because they  <br/>
were unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
School has the outward appearance of kids having lots of friends.  On  <br/>
the inside they&#39;re saying &quot;You&#39;re not here to socialize,&quot; and if  <br/>
someone has six or ten friends she&#39;s really lucky.  Some have two,  <br/>
one or none.  Some have way more enemies and abusers than friends.<br/>
<br/>
So back to the topic here.   The idea that other unschoolers are  <br/>
obligated to be kind and generous to and therapeutic for other  <br/>
unschooling kids seems to go against the more central principles of  <br/>
choices and the right to just say no.<br/>
<br/>
I could tell lots of stories of my kids being generous and kind and  <br/>
therapeutic, but every single time, they did it because they wanted  <br/>
to.  And there were times they didn&#39;t want to, and so they didn&#39;t.   <br/>
If I try to pressure my kids to become practice pads for kids who  <br/>
need social-skills-drumming, how is that right and good?<br/>
<br/>
Holly reminded me the other day of an incident at a conference in  <br/>
Albuquerque in which some younger girls had asked her to come to  <br/>
their room and play.  She was with older girls and said &quot;Right now  <br/>
I&#39;m doing [whatever], but I&#39;ll come up there later,&quot; and she got the  <br/>
room number.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t hear any of this until later, and I was glad she brought it  <br/>
up again this week, because it made me proud of her, and it also gave  <br/>
me a story to tell here.<br/>
<br/>
The mom didn&#39;t really think Holly would show up, but the little girls  <br/>
were sure, and they wanted to go to the room and wait.   It might  <br/>
have been an easy thing for a teenager to say &quot;yeah, sure, later&quot; and  <br/>
then forget all about it, or be persuaded to come do other things  <br/>
with the teens.  But Holly said she would, and she did.  She went  <br/>
there and played and had fun.<br/>
<br/>
Had I known and &quot;made her&quot; go there, she wouldn&#39;t have had fun.  She  <br/>
might not have gone.  We might have had an argument about it.  She  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been as likely to share stories with me after that.   <br/>
But without ANY parental involvement, of her own volition, she made  <br/>
that offer and carried it through in a direct and real way.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the result of years of me keeping my word to her (not  <br/>
counting mending; there are some things in the mending pile I haven&#39;t  <br/>
gotten to, and I feel guilty), and talking through situations with  <br/>
her in which her feelings were hurt or she had hurt other people&#39;s  <br/>
feelings, for years and years before that day.  She wants to feel  <br/>
good.  She likes to feel good.<br/>
<br/>
There have been other incidents at conferences where other kids or  <br/>
parents weren&#39;t as nice or as appreciative, but Holly&#39;s pretty good  <br/>
at seeing what part of the problem is hers and what is theirs, and  <br/>
not in a mean, challenging &quot;HA!  I won this one!&quot; way, either, but in  <br/>
a &quot;That wasn&#39;t as smooth as it could&#39;ve been&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m helping her live in the world, not helping the world adapt to  <br/>
Holly (nor demanding that people treat her the way I imagine they  <br/>
should if I were the director of all the lives around me).<br/>

&gt;  foolish me still go on hoping and expecting &lt;BWG&gt; !<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ridding ourselves of expectations is incredibly important not just for<br/>
unschooling but in life.  Having an idea about how others *should* behave is<br/>
often not useful, especially considering that our ideas may frequently fail<br/>
to pan out, sometimes disappointingly, sometimes happily.<br/>
<br/>
In parenting Karl, I notice that he has his own perspective and is not the<br/>
child I was.  He&#39;s a different person.  I also notice that I have my own<br/>
perspective as an adult, and looking back my retrospective view of me as<br/>
child is *not* totally the one I had when I was a child.  Unschooling is not<br/>
about changing the perspectives of the people involved.  We wouldn&#39;t wish to<br/>
throw out all the understanding we&#39;ve gained since we were children and<br/>
parent from there.  Instead, the practice of unschooling and the experience<br/>
of other unschoolers offers (hopefully more clearly) a picture of how to<br/>
interact with children.<br/>
<br/>
Putting the focus squarely on happy endings can easily bypass the needs of<br/>
the people living in the moment within the current situation.  It&#39;s limited<br/>
in approach.  We can&#39;t find happiness simply by saying it&#39;s so and ignoring<br/>
unmet (unheard) needs.<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling radically, the goal is peaceful interactions.  To have that,<br/>
it&#39;s imperative to leave  behind our expectations about how people will act<br/>
and react. It&#39;s helps to avoid speaking for unknowns, and to have a greater<br/>
respect for those unknowns.  To know that unknowns are there to be<br/>
discovered and considered.<br/>

completely valid!<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has always been extremely honest about doings and happenings,<br/>
she&#39;s also always been fair and really into everyone being treated<br/>
fairly.  So, when altercations happened with kids, I always went to<br/>
Chamille first, not just because she&#39;s my daughter, but because I know<br/>
without a doubt, I will get an accurate account of what happened.  She&#39;s<br/>
proven this time and time again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve even said to other kids, &quot;well Chamille has told me this and I<br/>
trust her completely, you all know that she&#39;s fair and honest about<br/>
these things.&quot;  and because they do know that she&#39;s fair and honest,<br/>
they look to her for accurate and fair accounting of things, or handling<br/>
mediation between people at discord.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux on the other hand, is not this way, so while her side is most<br/>
definitely how she interpreted the event, it&#39;s not always 100% exactly<br/>
what actually happened.  I know this, just as much as I know that<br/>
Chamille gives very accurate accounts, so I can take that into<br/>
consideration when negotiating social things with her.  Margaux is<br/>
getting better and better as time goes on, so it&#39;s definitely a learning<br/>
curve sort of thing to becoming more empathetic towards others.</div>

&gt; unable to break the vicious cycle of needing to keep retreating back<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; In another word, she doesn&#39;t know how to stop doing it.<br/>

perhaps they aren&#39;t ready for that kind of social interaction.  It<br/>

<br/>
1) recent accident with head injury; fine for a few hours, but needs  <br/>
naps<br/>
<br/>
2) stressed out over three months of caring for head injury partner;  <br/>
not in the mood for a big crowd, so went for a walk with me<br/>
<br/>
3) teenaged girl having a rough first day of her period<br/>
<br/>
4) teenaged boy with mono, fine for a few hours but needs to play a  <br/>
quiet game in a dark room a time or two a day<br/>
<br/>
5) husband (mine) home from a crazy stressful day of nonsense, needs  <br/>
to be alone to do physical things and get the adrenaline out<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always good to give people the option of party/no party,  noisy  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I taught Jr. High.  Those kids were 11 to 15 years old (mostly 12,  <br/>
13, 14).  Their nicknames were very rarely anywhere in the realm of  <br/>
affectionate or funny.  They ranged from dopey waste-of-time to  <br/>
cruelty-leaning-toward-ostracization.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to be called things other than my own name.  I really  <br/>
don&#39;t like it when someone has made a nickname and won&#39;t stop when I  <br/>
ask them to stop.  It&#39;s abusive.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to me to be a very dangerous precedent to be set if other  <br/>
kids are expected to be kind and understanding of a &quot;labelled&quot; child,  <br/>
when some of the worst name-calling in the world has to do with labels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If my child one single time called a Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; against his will,  <br/>
I would clearly and seriously say it&#39;s not okay to call people things  <br/>
they don&#39;t want to be called.  I wouldn&#39;t tell Robert it meant they  <br/>
liked him.  I wouldn&#39;t let them figure it out on their own.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the desire as a parent for our children to have positive social<br/>
experiences can cloud our judgment in providing useful paths this way. With<br/>
my guy, I tried to force social experiences when, as stated above, he wasn&#39;t<br/>
ready, and potentially wasn&#39;t even interested. He may have made vague<br/>
references to wanting to get together with others, but probably not to the<br/>
extent that I tried to get it together for him. I was overhearing, rather<br/>
than really hearing, if you know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
He was probably around 12 before he started having mostly appropriate<br/>
positive social interactions...ones where he listened and watched as much as<br/>
he participated with his own often eccentric twist. Socially he was still a<br/>
bit jilt, and others knew he was struggling somewhat, but he wasn&#39;t<br/>
offensive to anyone. He was just another unique critter in the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
It helped too to find accepting groups of people to hang with, along with<br/>
the regular run-of-the-mill crowd. Having people who specifically don&#39;t<br/>
judge and who handle awkwardness kindly gave the experience to my guy that<br/>
not all people were assholes (that is often the perception I think when what<br/>
you get from people is mostly negative, and you don&#39;t know why).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe if a kid isn&#39;t going to be nice, or if a kid has regular<br/>
unpleasant social experiences, finding what gives them  joy until things<br/>
shift, change, evolve is a great way to go. For us, practice in<br/>
socialization in large group experiences wasn&#39;t really a good idea. Small<br/>
groups, or single-person monitored interactions grew to better larger group<br/>
experiences, though to this day he is not a party-goer, as many of us<br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, Andrew has been creating a Halloween event, I think he&#39;s<br/>
calling it &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot;, where he is transforming our downstairs into an<br/>
experiential nightmarish kind-of place. He has enlisted 10 actors to<br/>
participate, has created really eerie spaces to bring groups through...one<br/>
with sound-making stuff and when people start their own music, white ghosty<br/>
people will come down the stairs, dance erratically and then bleed from<br/>
their mouths and chests and scream. One room has 6 TV&#39;s with no reception,<br/>
just white fuzz, and a story of evil sprits coming through the screens will<br/>
be told. Participants are told to stare at the TV and draw/write the message<br/>
they receive. There will be only black and red markers/paint available with<br/>
drawing pads. They will then be rushed outside by a screaming maniac telling<br/>
them the spirits will get them otherwise. Outside there are 5 gravestones<br/>
with people lying under tarps in front of them...you guessed it, zombies<br/>
will rise from the dead and scare the bejeebies out of them.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool stuff!<br/>

was usually right there with my guy to avoid social problems, but he was<br/>
still who he was, and even things that weren&#39;t disrespectful, but just odd,<br/>
would elicit unkind comments from kids and adults. Having this often in<br/>
one&#39;s life can lead to negative beliefs about people, and one&#39;s self.<br/>
<br/>
The Halloween event described is meant for informed people who know that<br/>
weird, creepy things await inside and for people who want to partake. I<br/>
assume that is assumed, but people with young children reading the paragraph<br/>
on its own may be a little wierded out. It&#39;s more a teenager thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is totally cool!!!  My son likes the same thing.  Aidan regularly<br/>
has friends over to make haunted houses - through our bathroom (that<br/>
has a front and back door), in our computer room, haunted backyard<br/>
last year where people rode through in the trailer attached to our<br/>
riding lawn mower.  We&#39;ve had a haunted barn in the past and he&#39;s<br/>
started decorating the front yard for Halloween this year.  He would<br/>
love to see your son&#39;s Slaughterhouse!!  A friend has plan for him to<br/>
help her with her Halloween party this year.  She has created some<br/>
pretty spectacular haunted barns and carriage rides in the past.  I am<br/>
also planning to get to several of the local haunted houses this year.<br/>
<br/>
He also likes to make scary movies.  He has always loved scary movies<br/>
and scary stories.  He started with Scooby Doo and Goosebumps and<br/>
progressed by way of Hitchcock films to Friday the 13th, Nightmare on<br/>
Elm Street, etc.  He has made several of his own films - two are on<br/>
youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As0G1ihWv70">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As0G1ihWv70</a> and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn0LoL37RDQ&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn0LoL37RDQ&feature=related</a>  We have<br/>
talked about suspense versus in your face gore and how it plays out in<br/>
our favorites.  We have attended a showing of a film which was<br/>
produced and filmed locally - Aidan was able to speak with the<br/>
director to ask how he got started.  He does a lot of his own make-up<br/>
and special effects for the gore scenes of some of his other movies<br/>
and has spent hours online researching the materials and techniques.  <br/>
He has run a scar workshop at an unschooling campout we attended.  He<br/>
has also spent time asking questions and picking up new tips at the<br/>
local magic and costume shops where he buys some of his supplies. <br/>
It&#39;s been fun watching his interest expand from just watching scary<br/>
movies to exploring all aspects of the process and then branching off<br/>
into haunted houses.  <br/>

&gt;  Ah.  Okay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  We&#39;ve come to have happy endings without expecting or needing an<br/>
&gt;  apology for someone else&#39;s inability to find happiness. If they was a<br/>
&gt;  problem and someone&#39;s actually sorry, that&#39;s a whole new chapter, a<br/>
&gt;  whole new incident, in my thinking.<br/>

lacked simple information.  I&#39;m well acquainted with that problem, being so<br/>
hard of hearing.  And occasionally there&#39;s even been situations where the<br/>
giving of information is not a clear reason to clear up misunderstandings<br/>
when it would infringe on someone&#39;s privacy or other needs or arrangements<br/>
or whatever.  Or on someone&#39;s needs .. a person not directly involved but<br/>
affected by the situation, like children who in many cases have no say.<br/>
