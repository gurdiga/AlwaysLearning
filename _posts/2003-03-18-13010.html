<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517826968">Hi Kate:<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t remember the topic so I thought I&#39;d put the above up there (sorry<br/>
too lazy to go back to my e-mail)...  I&#39;m not actually going to talk about<br/>
that, just wanted to thank Kate for her story.  I was imagining you and she<br/>
standing next to each other.<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking that if women ran the world would I, as a mother, send my<br/>
child to kill one of your children?  I don&#39;t know what the answer to that<br/>
is, but I&#39;ll keep thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
Off to buy things from Zak (with my own money, and things that are actually<br/>
mine)  He&#39;s having an indoor yard sale.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love these sales. Mine once had a big sale in the front yard with tree<br/>
limbs we had cut down. The sign said &quot;firwud fur sal&quot; It was kinda funny as<br/>
we lived in Hawaii and no one had any need for firewood:) But dh went out<br/>
and bought some (and he&#39;d been the one who&#39;d cut them down and dragged them<br/>
to the curb).<br/>
