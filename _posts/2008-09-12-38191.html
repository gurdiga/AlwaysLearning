<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952362336">I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place for this thread.  But, since<br/>
this is the only place I know of where kids have a choice on whether to<br/>
go to school or not, I&#39;m gonna ask here.<br/>
<br/>
Lydia (11) started public school this year, mainly to meet more friends.<br/>
Homeschoolers, especially unschoolers are few and far between here and<br/>
most that we know are not quite as outgoing as Lydia.  Anyway, she&#39;s<br/>
been in school for almost 3 weeks and is making a lot of friends and<br/>
enjoying that aspect of it.<br/>
<br/>
What she doesn&#39;t like is school itself (shocker...I know... [;)] ).  She<br/>
has sooo much homework and well, I won&#39;t go into all the pointless,<br/>
mindless, worthless stuffs she&#39;s doing.  I&#39;m guessing you all have a<br/>
pretty good idea about it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s exhausted.  This is a busy girl.  After and 8 hour day, she did<br/>
homework, went to 2 hours of cheerleading and then came home and went to<br/>
her good friends house a couple doors down.   A little before ten I<br/>
called her (cause she usually hits the hay by ten) just to make sure<br/>
nothing happened on the way home.  She was already on her way and just<br/>
lost track of time.<br/>
<br/>
When she got home she just started crying and wanting to be held.  She<br/>
still &quot;had to&quot; take a shower, and clean the guinnea pigs cage and pick<br/>
out her clothes and she said &quot; I just don&#39;t  want to go to school!&quot;  I<br/>
said, showe r in the morning, dad already did the cage, I&#39;ll pick out<br/>
your clothes and you don&#39;t have to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
She was so tired and it wasn&#39;t a good time to really talk.  But we<br/>
chatted a little about her choices.  She said she really likes the<br/>
friends at school but she just doesn&#39;t know what to do.  I suggest she<br/>
takes tomorrow off and she ended up wanting to go cause she&#39;s having a<br/>
sleep over at one of her friends houses.<br/>
<br/>
But I want to talk to her some more this weekend.  I don&#39;t know if I<br/>
should encourage her to quit, encourage her to give it some more time or<br/>
encourage her to dual enroll (in Iowa you can dual enroll and pick and<br/>
chose what you&#39;d like to take)????  Selfishly, I want her to quit.  But,<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I can find the social stuff during the day for her.  We<br/>
go to park days (which she doesn&#39;t really want to do anymore), and had<br/>
joined scouts, 4-H  (both of which she&#39;s had enough of) but her close<br/>
friends from homeschooling have all gone to school.  We also joined a<br/>
teen group but no real good matches there.  We will keep trying however!<br/>
I&#39;m not giving up, I just want her to be happy and fulfilled.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t want it to seem like we haven&#39;t been trying!<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately it&#39;s her choice, I know, it&#39;s just so hard watching her be so<br/>
exhausted, getting so drained and really not finding the happiness she<br/>
wants!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing there are no magic words, I guess I&#39;m just wondering how<br/>
this process worked for others?<br/>

<br/>
I think you should not talk to her about it unless she brings it up.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would try to let the weekend be a big break from school.   <br/>
Do something totally not related to school if you can.  Cook, or go  <br/>
shopping, or watch a movie.  Just be with her, in relaxing ways.  No  <br/>
more stress.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Three weeks isn&#39;t twelve years.  Let it unfold in its own time.  Let  <br/>
her come home totally because she wants to, not because you lured her  <br/>
back.  Or let her stay in school totally because she wanted to, not  <br/>
because you helped encourage her to finish what she started.  Try not  <br/>
to be a factor, not counting the BIG factor that you will hold her if  <br/>
she cries from exhaustion and that she knows you will welcome her  <br/>
home if she wants to quit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve had low points and high points regarding social lives. Rosie  <br/>
(now 17) had a few months of misery - really serious misery - after  <br/>
having problems with her then-best friends. She was 12 or 13. Losing  <br/>
those friends meant being left out of the social stuff she&#39;d been  <br/>
depending on for her entire social life. She woke up in the morning  <br/>
and was soon in tears over it - every day for several months. Then she  <br/>
somehow got her gumption together and decided to make herself a happy  <br/>
and active social group and she did it. She called people and was  <br/>
persistent and got various kids together to do things on a regular  <br/>
basis. She let herself be completely open to being friends with anyone  <br/>
available. She started some new activities. Over time, she developed a  <br/>
fantastic social group that she&#39;s thrilled with - they get together to  <br/>
play games, mostly, and also to go to movies. She still tends to be  <br/>
the &quot;organizer&quot; of the group - she&#39;s the one who mostly calls or text  <br/>
messages people and says, &quot;Hey, a bunch of us are going to see a movie  <br/>
on Tuesday afternoon if you want to go.&quot; She had to really take a lot  <br/>
of initiative to get herself over not having the girl friends she&#39;d  <br/>
depended on before but she&#39;s VERY glad, now, that it all happened and  <br/>
she&#39;s very very happy with her social life. Even in the last few weeks  <br/>
she&#39;s just suddenly exclaimed, out of nowhere, &quot;I LOVE my friends - I  <br/>
have such cool friends!&quot;  She also got closer to her sisters - partly  <br/>
that was because she got old enough to be more of a friend to hang out  <br/>
with - to have fun together -  her sisters are 3 and 6 years older  <br/>
than she is. She also took up martial arts about then - with my pretty  <br/>
strong urging to just try it - and that became a very strong passion  <br/>
and the martial arts studio provided a built-in social group, too.<br/>
<br/>
So - I hope some of that might help. You might tell her that it really  <br/>
took some very strong determination on my daughter&#39;s part that she was  <br/>
GOING to create a social life for herself. It didn&#39;t always look like  <br/>
it was going to go well, but she didn&#39;t give up even when she was  <br/>
disappointed that her friends weren&#39;t available nearly as often as she  <br/>
wanted them around.<br/>

<br/>
This is not a small accomplishment.  The decision to be more open widens the<br/>
pool of options.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes after you get in a group that clicks, it might not feel important<br/>
to widen the pool.<br/>
<br/>
Then going from one group to *no* established group means the old clickish<br/>
habits don&#39;t help and that&#39;s when being open to being friends with people<br/>
who are available ... in a sense not depending on your old discernment ...<br/>
comes in handy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something we do all the time.  But it&#39;s useful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What did you do??  I&#39;m not trying to be snarky, I being totally<br/>
serious.  How much did you get involved in that?  Did you encourage<br/>
that, model it?  Did you have conversations encouraging that?<br/>
<br/>
Lydia&#39;s pretty good at seeing the positives in people.  It&#39;s just all<br/>
of her life (11 years) it&#39;s really been me organizing playdates etc. <br/>
So, now that she&#39;s in school she&#39;s on her own and seems to be doing<br/>
pretty good at the friend making, it&#39;s just the schooly part that she<br/>
is finding less than desirable (she just asked me how much longer the<br/>
year is...:).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still organize things (like a skating party for her cheer squad,<br/>
haunted house trip for the homeschool teen group).  Was Rosie<br/>
motivated to just do that stuff herself?  I mean I come up with the<br/>
ideas and see if it&#39;s something she wants to do.  I just want her to<br/>
see there is still all these connections outside of school.  <br/>
