<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361943837">As a kid, I remember wearing thin cotton sneakers (keds) in the snow with no socks and the backs pressed down, so that they were more like mules or open-back clogs. My mother was horrified but let it be. Looking back, it seems crazy to me that I went out in the snow (and walked to school) like that. Now I have little cold-tolerance. I think it was partly a fashion choice on my part, but I can honestly say the wet snow seeping into my shoes (and wearing cold, wet shoes in school all day) didn&#39;t bother me!<br/>
<br/>
I also know a kid who made the decision to wear shorts every day throughout the winter. It was a personal challenge for him and he was committed to it. His parents supported him and he wasn&#39;t harmed. At the end of the season he was proud of his accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
As others have suggested, however, would confirm that it is not just an issue of  your son not liking the coat he has.<br/>

A friend of mine is a lawyer now, so I suppose she can afford custom  <br/>
shoes, but when she was younger she would wear flip-flops even in  <br/>
winter, because her feet were very long and narrow and shoes hurt her  <br/>
feet.  It was easier for her to hurry into a warm place and take off  <br/>
the (also uncomfortable).<br/>

<br/>
Common knowledge?  Part of a mother&#39;s learning curve.<br/>
Sometimes when a mom has a hard-won only child she&#39;s more patient than  <br/>
a mom expecting others to come along, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
If the firstborn is also very much like the mother in temperament,  <br/>
that can be doubly hard on the poor child.<br/>
