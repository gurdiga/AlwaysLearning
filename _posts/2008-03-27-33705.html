<div id="ygrps-yiv-498712743">I had an e-mail I&#39;m going to paraphrase and leave anonymous.  It  <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter who sent it.  It could&#39;ve been anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The question was whether I think someone&#39;s not unschooling enough, or  <br/>
whether someone&#39;s kids should be in school.<br/>
There was further some question about whether one should be further  <br/>
along with unschooling, or reading more.<br/>
<br/>
Those are all hard questions.  I don&#39;t want to have side e-mail about  <br/>
such things for a couple of reasons.  The value of this group is that  <br/>
people will get different ideas, and one person will pick up on a  <br/>
nuance that others miss.  Also, I don&#39;t want to do one-on-one  <br/>
exchanges because of time and the relative value of writing in  <br/>
private as opposed to writing in public.  If I write something here  <br/>
and ten families benefit, it was a better use of my time.<br/>
<br/>
The subject was &quot;I&#39;d hate to fail at this.&quot;  I want to look at that  <br/>
first.<br/>
Not knowing the emotions accompanying the thought that led to the  <br/>
writing, I&#39;m only guessing.  Here are a couple of guesses, though.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t need confirmation or denial.   It&#39;s just something to think  <br/>
about.  Could it be left over school thinking?  Could it be  <br/>
determination to start what one finishes?  Might it be that having  <br/>
declared &quot;we&#39;re unschooling&quot; it&#39;s self conscious fear of saying  <br/>
&quot;changed my mind&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, back to it, going another way.  &quot;I&#39;d hate to fail at this.&quot;   <br/>
Assuming one really does want to unschool smoothly and peacefully,  <br/>
then reading more might or might not help.  But what WILL help (and  <br/>
the only thing that will help) is putting the suggestions people send  <br/>
into use and seeing how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Some people swear by Birkenstocks.  I haven&#39;t had a pair I liked.  I  <br/>
like Wolkys, but honestly they look a little like old lady shoes, and  <br/>
I&#39;m a little like an old lady so I don&#39;t really mind.  They&#39;re  <br/>
expensive, but I don&#39;t wear my shoes out very quickly at all; they&#39;ll  <br/>
last years or the rest of my life.  So if in a conversation where  <br/>
shoe recommendations come through, some of that might be said.  It  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t matter who said what, what&#39;s going to matter is that you  <br/>
had more input before deciding yourself what to do.  You might not  <br/>
want either kind.  You might have young feet and strong ankles and  <br/>
can do with flip flops another few years, or some fancy sandals with  <br/>
heels.   We don&#39;t even need to know!  The questions are asked and  <br/>
people throw their best ideas onto the table.  Take what you like and  <br/>
leave the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Now...<br/>
WHY one is considering unschooling is important.  And how the kids  <br/>
feel about it is important.  But we don&#39;t need to know here on the  <br/>
list why and how each family is  unschooling.  We&#39;ll discuss  <br/>
particulars in general.  That&#39;s how it works.<br/>
<br/>
I think parenting choices are about the child&#39;s growth and learning.   <br/>
Some children, for some reasons, might do better in school than at  <br/>
home.  Some parents, for lots of reasons, can&#39;t unschool.  Don&#39;t want  <br/>
to.  Try but can&#39;t relax and go with the flow.  Can&#39;t find the flow.<br/>
<br/>
This list exists to help people find the flow.  Joyce&#39;s site, my ever- <br/>
growing collection, people&#39;s blogs are all there to help people  <br/>
figure out what they think and why and what they might want to change  <br/>
and why, and where they are and where they could be.<br/>
<br/>
Better is better.   That&#39;s just true.  Each little choice or word or  <br/>
action has the potential to make the next moment better.  A journey  <br/>
of a thousand miles can take fifteen hundred miles if you&#39;re not  <br/>
careful where you step.   And you only step in one place at a time,  <br/>
so choose it thoughtfully and happily, with &quot;getting warm/getting  <br/>
cold&quot; in mind.<br/>
<br/>
My whole &quot;make the better choice&quot; tool (which came out of an SCA  <br/>
context, speaking of SCA this morning, which I&#39;m not through doing  <br/>
yet) is very much like the game of &quot;you&#39;re getting warm&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re  <br/>
getting cold.&quot;    Only you can play it with yourself when you know  <br/>
where you want to go.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby gave directions to his friend Brett (a.k.a. Holly&#39;s boyfriend)  <br/>
the other day for driving to Austin.  There are several ways to drive  <br/>
to Austin.  Kirby was advising Roswell, Fort Stockton, go toward  <br/>
Fredricksburg and come up on Austin from the SE.   That didn&#39;t mean  <br/>
Brett *HAD* to drive that way.  It was advice based on accounts of  <br/>
people having done that and done other things, and Kirby sharing  <br/>
what, at the moment, he believes is the quickest way to get from our  <br/>
place to his.<br/>
<br/>
What people are doing on this list is similar to that.  People with  <br/>
older kids who have unschooled are advising people with younger kids  <br/>
about how we got here, what we wish we&#39;d done differently, what we&#39;ve  <br/>
seen other people do that they regretted or that never got them to  <br/>
unschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about failing at unschooling as if it&#39;s a goal to be  <br/>
accomplished.  Worry about whether your kids are learning and living  <br/>
in peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885079202">Sandra,<br/>
I just wanted to say, it&#39;s writing like this that motivated me to join this<br/>
list. Inspiring and positive and full of contributions to my life. This<br/>
particular topic reminded me of something I read a long time ago about how<br/>
maybe it&#39;s impossible to fail at learning, because learning just keeps<br/>
happening all the time no matter what you do! I wish I could remember where<br/>
to give the credit, but what stuck with me was a sense that I was not just<br/>
&quot;unschooling my kids&quot;, but we are *all* unschoolers. This may be obvious to<br/>
many here, particularly the veterans, but it was a good insight for me that<br/>
I think might help others. This is why I tend to think of unschooling as<br/>
&quot;cooperative life learning&quot; - even if while cooperating different<br/>
individuals within the family might take on different roles (i.e. child<br/>
discovers an interest, parent facilitates its pursuit) it emphasizes that<br/>
aspect of &quot;can&#39;t fail this&quot; to me, not in the sense that the person who<br/>
emailed it meant it, but because it&#39;s literally impossible to fail!  I think<br/>
one of the best points you raised was that all the reading or discussing in<br/>
the world is not what makes a difference, but what you actually do with it<br/>
in your interactions with your children (this is obviously my own<br/>
interpretation of what you said, what I got from it).<br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if the person who feared &quot;failing at this&quot; was just expressing<br/>
a feeling of being overwhelmed by the enormity of the change between their<br/>
current or recent situation and the unshcooling lifestyle? If so, I can<br/>
identify with that, and perhaps offer some reassurance that even very<br/>
positive transitions are still transitions and thus expected to cause some<br/>
stress almost by definition. Sure, losses such as divorce and death are<br/>
among the top-rated stress causes usually listed, but so are weddings and<br/>
births and adoptions, and I would add that for a parent conscientious enough<br/>
about their child&#39;s education to even be marginally interested in<br/>
unschooling, taking the actual leap, particularly if the kids have been<br/>
attending school thus far, would be up there too.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;you&#39;re getting warm/you&#39;re getting cold&quot;, I find that an extremely<br/>
useful guide for keeping the focus on the important stuff, and I plan to use<br/>
it! Only wish that this was more often as obvious as it can be sometimes -<br/>
wish I could have a thermometer of sorts to gauge how choices stand against<br/>
the final goal, if you know what I mean? It&#39;s not even just about knowing<br/>
where you want to go, IMO, even though that of course is essential, but<br/>
sometimes the questions of how to get &quot;there&quot; from &quot;here&quot; are not as clear.<br/>
For the times when it&#39;s clear though, which are clearly many, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll<br/>
be superbly helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone else has had that feeling of &quot;OK, I *know* where I want<br/>
to get, but I&quot;m not sure if this is getting me warmer, right now, or<br/>
colder&quot;? And how do you deal with that?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; accomplished. Worry about whether your kids are learning and living<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra said this in her great email.  Immediately when she mentioned this mother saying &quot;I don&#39;t want to fail at this&quot;, I thought, &quot;Oh God, me either!&quot;  Of course no one CAN fail at life, it&#39;s all relative.  But, when we are looking at how to do things by the minute, by the week etc., we do want to &quot;do well&quot; which in some way is the opposite of failing, and therefore the fear of failing is forever present.  <br/>
<br/>
As my 13 year old strives ALLLLLLLLLL week to get his new mount in WOW that was on some new &quot;patch&quot;, I have thought the whole week about how uncomfortable I am with this being so obsessive, and yet I want to honor his drive, interests etc.  My parenting inner voice is always having conversations---&quot;if I stop him or limit him from the game, what message does that send?, Yeah, but if I don&#39;t limit him, his days will be filled only with this 1 thing and I don&#39;t feel that is healthy.  You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not healthy perhaps when you look at it this way, but if you look at it in the context of him being allowed to control his own life more, it is actually empowering him, then..............&quot;  You get it...this is where I can say (to follow Sandra&#39;s great analogy) I am getting warmer.  I have a great idea of where I want to go....just wondering what things should look like along the way that take me to that destination.  <br/>
<br/>
This thread is so important--I see unschooling as my ultimate quest to be more patient.  This process requires trust and patience at the same levels that for ME, ap parenting and all the choices inherent therefore required.  There are no &quot;results&quot; given along the way as markers.  You have to wait usually a long time if ever to really see that &quot;end result&quot;.  Think how different that is from our typical schooling experiences......you have a test 2x a week to let you know where you are with &quot;results&quot;.  Jobs give you reviews etc.  There sure isn&#39;t some external somebody that is going to evaluate your unschooling/parenting and say &quot;A+, keep up the solid work&quot;.  You have to trust your instinct.  Now that I write this, perhaps working on tuning into your instincts on all levels would be good therapy for those of us who fear, or  those who constantly wonder if they are succeeding or failing.  I am always asking the kids to check their instinct--their GUT feeling.  Ours are not dead, just buried perhaps.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not just one thing, though, is it?  It&#39;s reading and strategy  <br/>

with a group).<br/>

If someone reads a lot and goes through three or four books a week,  <br/>
is that &quot;1 thing&quot; if the books are about different people and times  <br/>

<br/>
==================================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing a lot of World of Warcraft with Simon and Linnaea. Not all day, but every day. The goal isn&#39;t to get the new mount, none of us are high enough for a mount, yet. Our playing isn&#39;t particularly goal oriented. It is more about playing together, calling a friend or skype-ing another and playing as a group. We help each other or one of us will wander off for a quest, calling out when assistance is needed or when a special something was found that they KNOW will help someone else&#39;s character out. It is community and fellowship and a lot of joy. Occasionally there is frustration or jealousy or moments when getting up and moving are better than sitting down and playing. There is humor, oh, I don&#39;t know, there is so much more than just playing a game together. Or maybe that is all there is. Like playing Life or Monopoly or chess, maybe it is just like that, like the conversations and the stories and the companionship. When I was a child my<br/>
 family would go on extended family camping trips. Canasta played a big role in those extended family camping trips. Lots of competition, some hurt feelings; I can remember by Aunt Jamie crying when my dad and my grandmother trounced her and whomever else she was partnered with. Nobody questioned the value of those games. It was encouraged. It was fun and challenging and thoughtful. Just like World of Warcraft can be. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220062763"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This thread is so important--I see unschooling as my ultimate quest to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be more patient. This process requires &gt;trust and patience at the same<br/>
levels that for ME, ap parenting and all the choices inherent therefore<br/>
required.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that unschooling can truly work unless you are patient. <br/>
Patience, I don&#39;t think, can be the bi-product of unschooling.  I&#39;m a<br/>
very patient person by nature, but I had to really learn how to be more<br/>
patient with my kids, before unschooling could really work well. <br/>
Without it unschooling was only partial.  Getting rid of curriculum and<br/>
the idea that you NEED school was the easy part for me.  Saying &quot;yes&quot;<br/>
and being really mindful and patient was harder, but very very necessary<br/>
for unschooling to work.  Over the years I&#39;ve gotten more patient and<br/>
more mindful and unschooling has worked better and better with each<br/>
passing moment of more patience and more mindfulness.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There are no &quot;results&quot; given along the way as markers. You have to wait<br/>
 </span></blockquote>usually a long time if ever to really &gt;see that &quot;end result&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My experience is that you &quot;see&quot; the results a lot sooner if you can<br/>
really be patient and mindful sooner.  It can be from one week to the<br/>
next, one day to the next.  Seeing what your kids are doing, is a key<br/>
aspect to really understanding how each individual child learns. <br/>
Without that, you really will have a hard time knowing how to add more<br/>
to it that will really encourage and enrich that child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Think how different that is from our typical schooling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>experiences......you have a test 2x a week to let you &gt;know where you<br/>
are with &quot;results&quot;. Jobs give you reviews etc. There sure isn&#39;t some<br/>
external somebody that &gt;is going to evaluate your unschooling/parenting<br/>
and say &quot;A+, keep up the solid work&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all know this about school, most of us have been there.  The<br/>
evaluation process doesn&#39;t need to happen to know that things are<br/>
working.  You will know because your kids are at peace, you are at<br/>
peace, and your kids are doing the things that they want to do, or<br/>
striving to get there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You have to trust your instinct. Now that I write this, perhaps working<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on tuning into your instincts on all &gt;levels would be good therapy for<br/>
those of us who fear, or those who constantly wonder if they are<br/>
succeeding &gt;or failing. I am always asking the kids to check their<br/>
instinct--their GUT feeling. Ours are not dead, just buried &gt;perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of parents don&#39;t really know how to parent.  I certainly<br/>
don&#39;t know all the answers, but I&#39;m better at it than I was 5 yrs ago,<br/>
or even 2 yrs ago.  I think it&#39;s a lot more than trusting your<br/>
instincts.  Instincts can be good, but some people like you said have<br/>
had theirs buried.  Schools fail kids all the time.  It is an<br/>
unavoidable part of that system.  If they have successes they gaurantee<br/>
failures.  Get rid of those dynamics and there is only the person and<br/>
what that person does is measured by their own internal compass bouncing<br/>
off of the world they live in.  We either do or we don&#39;t do what we want<br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see either one of my kids measuring what they do as successes<br/>
and failures.  They are either doing what they want to do or not do,<br/>
they are either happy with the outcome or not.  I really don&#39;t see them<br/>
internalizing these ideas of success or failure.  For the most part they<br/>
are happy kids, content with their lives and what they are into.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092798724">-=-&gt;There are no &quot;results&quot; given along the way as markers. You have  <br/>

<br/>
When is the &quot;end result&quot; of high school?  Going to college?  What  <br/>
about dropping out during grad school?<br/>
<br/>
When is the end result of medical school?   Going to prison for  <br/>
illegally distributing methadone?<br/>
<br/>
(Those two examples are people I know personally.  I know lots of the  <br/>
former and knew one of the latter, and attended his funeral with  <br/>
Holly when she was nine.)<br/>
<br/>
When is the end result of anything?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The way we unschool, the end result is now, in this moment.  Five  <br/>
people are upstairs watching a movie together.  They went ice skating  <br/>
noonish and then out to lunch and then rented videos.  Two are legal  <br/>
adults and could be out drinking beer (or buying beer for the rest of  <br/>
them), but they&#39;re watching movies with three unschooled kids.  One  <br/>
of them has to go to work in a while.  One of the people who skated  <br/>
with them already had to go to work (another adult, who was  <br/>
unschooled, who&#39;s in college and has a job).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s some end result, in my opinion.<br/>
