<br/>
This was put up today—additions to three pages on my site.<br/>
<br/>
That link will lead to “Random old news of new info” and give you a way to explore my site, and Just Add Light (because the photos are links to posts there).<br/>
<br/>
Every day, still, I write about unschooling or work on my site, adding new quotes by someone, or me. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If there are people here who need more unschooling input, ask questions here!  <br/>
Or come to the less-elegant but much busier facebook group Radical Unschooling Info.  You can read it without joining, if you have a facebook account.<br/>
