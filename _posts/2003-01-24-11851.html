&gt; by reading what you have written.  The quality of women on this list is<br/>
&gt; wonderful and I learn so much.  This is a list where I get my strength<br/>

It IS a good place---thanks in great part to Sandra.<br/>

I really do appreciate reminders that I don&#39;t thoroughly suck, and that every <br/>
person who looked into unschooling and decided not to didn&#39;t leave JUST <br/>
because I&#39;m too blunt and pushy.<br/>
<br/>
To hear some of that, you&#39;d think I never contributed to unschooling in any <br/>
way, I just stand by the door and run people off.<br/>
