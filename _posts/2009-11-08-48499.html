<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955449071"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would proudly declare that if I had girls they would not wear<br/>
 &gt; pink and would not play with Barbies.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, I&#39;ve heard people say that.<br/>
<br/>
And can you imagine the reaction if some mom had proudly declared her<br/>
daughter would not wear blue and would not play with trucks!<br/>
=================================================================<br/>
<br/>
With sincere apologies for possibly irritating those who really truly  <br/>
cannot begin to consider going to Santa Fe in January,<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t Joyce clear and solid in her understanding of the logic behind  <br/>
why unschooling and mindful parenting work?<br/>
I&#39;m stunned and glad when Joyce writes something as clear as she&#39;s  <br/>
written above.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s likely that now that Joyce&#39;s daughter Kathryn is grown, Joyce  <br/>
might well gradually wander away from unschooling discussions.  She  <br/>
might not, but her website will endure somewhere between &quot;for a while&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;for a long time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still, what if you could look at her writings with her voice and her  <br/>
face in your mind?   What if you&#39;d get a chance to just hang out with  <br/>
her and eat, and maybe meet her husband and daughter?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the things this upcoming symposium in Santa Fe is about.<br/>
There&#39;s only one three-bedroom condo left in our set, but there are  <br/>
several one- and two-bedrooms left.   Those are $79 or $99 a night, if  <br/>
you register before the end of November, and they&#39;re real dwelling  <br/>
places you could live in.  Full kitchen, living room, fireplace, and  <br/>
my husband Keith and I will make sure you have some firewood and  <br/>
kindling and matches for those fireplaces.<br/>
<br/>
The conference fee is $100 for one person, $150 for two, $180 for  <br/>
three, and $20 additional per family member after that.  We will  <br/>
evening meals together.  One will be a potluck.  One night we&#39;ll play  <br/>
Apples to Apples and another night we&#39;ll have Show and Tell  <br/>
(potentially like a talent show, but no one needs literally to sing or  <br/>
dance).<br/>
<br/>
More information is here:<br/>

and that has links to a blog with photos and to a registration page<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing Joyce again myself, but I promise  <br/>
not to hog her attention, so others can hang out with her.<br/>

<br/>
We have a good number of families with teens, and it&#39;s okay for others  <br/>
to register now, on the understanding that you&#39;ve read what my hopes  <br/>
and intentions are for the symposium, and understand that it&#39;s not a  <br/>
conference intended for families with young children.   There are ways  <br/>
to deal with that, and I wrote some on the blog post linked above.<br/>
