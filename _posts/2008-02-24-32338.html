<div id="ygrps-yiv-112569714">We&#39;re going through a difficult time in a friendship at the moment between <br/>
my 8 year old ds and his two friends who are twin boys, 7 and a half yrs <br/>
old. The 3 boys love spending time together and have had a friendship since <br/>
they were quite young.<br/>
<br/>
The problem has been that my ds seems to override these boys to a point that <br/>
they feel they can&#39;t say no to him or stop if something negative happens or <br/>
something they don&#39;t feel comfortable with arises. The boys&#39; mum and I, also <br/>
friends, have discussed this many times over the past year in particular. <br/>
The boys have been telling their mum about situations, when playing with my <br/>
ds that they&#39;ve felt uncomfortable with (rough play, negative words said to <br/>
them etc) and she&#39;s now, after an incident at our unschoolers group a couple <br/>
of weeks or so ago, severed the friendship and told the boys they can&#39;t see <br/>
my ds anymore. All three boys are unhappy about this decision. I tried to <br/>
suggest we get together and see if we could problem solve, with the boys, <br/>
the situation and see if we could come up some better ways of dealing with <br/>
things - both for them and for us. I know my ds must be not coping too well <br/>
in their friendship at times for him to behaving in some of the ways it&#39;s <br/>
been said he&#39;s behaving and I see that they need our help to move through <br/>
this phase in the friendship.<br/>
<br/>
If her boys had wanted this decision to be made then I wouldn&#39;t have an <br/>
issue with the friendship ceasing but because all 3 boys don&#39;t want this I <br/>
feel extremely sad that we, as the parents, can hold this much power in <br/>
their lives. Labels of &#39;bully&#39; and &#39;dark&#39; have been given to my ds by this <br/>
mum, and I really understand her fears for her boys. But, knowing my ds, I <br/>
know that something, at the times these negative behaviours are coming out, <br/>
must be causing him to respond in this way and he needs my help and guidance <br/>
to move through it and find acceptable ways for dealing with situations. He <br/>
has been, in the past, a fairly volatile person but since turning 8, he&#39;s <br/>
really calmed down alot and in much more control of his anger and emotions.<br/>
<br/>
I find, with my ds, that lots of discussion about how others feel and how he <br/>
was feeling really helps him move through situations and come out better <br/>
able to deal with things, especially as time&#39;s going on and he&#39;s becoming <br/>
more emotionally mature. He doesn&#39;t seem to have these same issues with any <br/>
of his other friends and has some very close freindships with both boys and <br/>
girls.<br/>
<br/>
I guess then, after all that rambling, what I&#39;m asking for is your opinions <br/>
on what you think about the severing of these boys friendship. Is that <br/>
really the only way to deal with this situation? We have tried many <br/>
different settings for get togethers but it always seems to surface when we <br/>
aren&#39;t within direct earshot. I feel like there must be a better way to deal <br/>
with it - like problem solving with them and much more close-by attention <br/>
whilst playing together but perhaps my friend is right, perhaps this isn&#39;t <br/>
going to help. She feels fear for her boys that they are being bullied and <br/>
they are unhealthily keen on my ds and the friendship.I feel that the boys <br/>
need to be able to make those decisions for themselves, with us right there <br/>
to help the situation be better and everyone to be safe, feel OK and be <br/>
heard.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really appreciate your input as this has been quite a stressful and very <br/>
sad time for us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you should have long ago made it your habit to stay within  <br/>
earshot.<br/>
It might be too late - the other mom must be fed up. She has twins -  <br/>
they don&#39;t need your son as much as he needs them and he appears, to  <br/>
her at least, to be the problem. She probably feels like she&#39;s already  <br/>
given it enough of a try and doesn&#39;t want to deal with it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If so, then all you can do is learn from it.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found, personally, that it pays, in the long run, to try to  <br/>
convince someone to stay friends, once they&#39;ve decided to break it  <br/>
off, it is really just a matter of time, because at that point any  <br/>
little (normal) thing can push them over the edge.<br/>
<br/>
It CAN be hard for one kid to be friends with twins, by the way,  <br/>
because the twins often know each other so well and it can feel to the  <br/>
third kid like the twins are always backing each other up and sort of  <br/>
ganging up. My daughter was close friends with twins, and I know it  <br/>
often felt to her like they spoke a sort of private language that she  <br/>
didn&#39;t entirely understand - she&#39;d get frustrated with them and get  <br/>
demanding or pushy or, often, say she wouldn&#39;t play unless they did  <br/>
something her way. In HER mind, I think it was reaction to feeling  <br/>
always outnumbered by the two of them, but to them, she seemed  <br/>
unreasonable. This was when they were about 8 to 10 years old, I&#39;d  <br/>
say. The mother of the twins saw it differently - she thought my  <br/>
daughter was jealous of the closeness of the twins. I really didn&#39;t  <br/>
see that, (my daughter has two sisters whom she was and is very close  <br/>
to, no real reason for jealousy of that sisterly closeness) but, you  <br/>
know, reality was maybe a bit of both.<br/>
<br/>
If you do convince the other parent to reconsider, maybe do it under  <br/>
much more controlled circumstances - you spend time together such that  <br/>
you parents are right there with the kids all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Consider it good feedback - learn from it even if it doesn&#39;t work out.  <br/>
Help your son learn from it. Help him move on, too, and be forward  <br/>
looking, not living with resentment. LOTS of friendships of the early  <br/>
years will go by the wayside, don&#39;t YOU act like he should be more  <br/>
devastated than he is. Show empathy, by all means, but help him move  <br/>
on, too.<br/>

<br/>
For now, you  have no option.<br/>
<br/>
If you were frustrated enough with another family that you said &quot;No,  <br/>
no more,&quot; how would  you feel about that other  mom going and asking  <br/>
others for help about how to do an end run around you?<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t the only way to have dealt with it, but that&#39;s the move the  <br/>
other mom chose to make.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The boys&#39; mum and I, also<br/>
<br/>
friends, have discussed this many times over the past year in  <br/>
particular.<br/>

<br/>
She spoke with you several times over a year&#39;s time and it didn&#39;t get  <br/>
better, so it wasn&#39;t a sudden decision.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I think her right to keep her kids safe trumps your right  <br/>
to provide an opportunity for your son to practice being better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel that the boys need to be able to make those decisions for  <br/>
themselves, with us right there to help the situation be better and  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe in a month or two you could request another session.  Kids get  <br/>
older and it might be different before long.  The mom will probably  <br/>
relax and her boys might miss yours and it will be easier.  I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t contact her too soon, or argue about it.  She&#39;s not happy  <br/>
either, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394950541">Hi Kim--<br/>
<br/>
I have found that the friendship thing can be some of the trickiest waters to navigate.  To <br/>
get some perspective about it I&#39;d say to watch your son with a variety of playmates and <br/>
look realistically at what you see.  Does your son need more help?  It can be really <br/>
tempting to let kids go off to play so we have mom-talking time, but different kids are <br/>
ready at different times for more independence.  And some relationships require more <br/>
attention than others do.  The chemistry factor can be huge between playmates and can <br/>
bring out entirely different behaviors--whether your child behaves like a leader or a <br/>
follower can sometimes change depending on the playmate.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you need to let this go for now, but time passing can make a difference, and <br/>
at eight, you son may not miss his friends as much as you do, especially if you focus on <br/>
other playmates.  And to know that there are real consequences to not working things out <br/>
equitably (if that is in fact what was happening) is not such a bad thing to learn about. <br/>
<br/>
It could be that things will shift around, because they frequently do with kids (not always <br/>
with adults, however), and the mom might be willing to try again in the future.  Her own <br/>
kids will have that time to develop other relationships, and perhaps find a place of <br/>
speaking up for themselves more, if that&#39;s what is needed on their part.  Just seeing your <br/>
kid/s spending a lot of time in the &quot;follower&quot; role can look a little scary to a parent, <br/>
justified or not.<br/>
