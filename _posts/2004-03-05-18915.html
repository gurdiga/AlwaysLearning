I can only add links.  I love Steven, but getting him to DO any more on my <br/>
site is DIFFICULT!!!!  I&#39;ll ask him tho --- <br/>

A note about the grad school -- Shawn was here in Feb to audition to two <br/>
schools, and then did NYU, then back here for two more.  After he did UCLA he <br/>
called me and was SO excited.  He simply knew it went well, and there was a <br/>
connection.  He decided to cancel the audition he had scheduled at Yale in a couple <br/>
weeks.  He was worried his car wouldn&#39;t make it (9hrs each way), and felt he&#39;d <br/>
be better served working and getting more money!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Connie - besides NYU and UCLA, can you share which other schools he<br/>
auditioned at. My dd is heading that way and we&#39;re starting to do a bit of<br/>
research. Also, did I read correctly that he was a transfer student and not<br/>
applying as a homeschooler?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

You could add a link to a page that someone else puts updates on then (or <br/>
that you do) so that they can click &quot;what&#39;s new&quot; or something!  (if you wanted to)<br/>
