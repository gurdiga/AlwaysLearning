<div id="ygrps-yiv-650392468">Well, we were out running around today, we ate lunch and wandered and<br/>
talked to people and just did what ever we liked.  We went walking down<br/>
by the river.  There is an observation deck there, built out over the<br/>
water and we sit there sometimes in the early mornings and watch the<br/>
beavers and muskrats and herons.  Dylan climbed under it today to look<br/>
around and I sprawled on the deck and hung my head over to look at him. <br/>
We saw muskrat foot prints in the mud, and imagined it to be a sort of<br/>
dry muskrat meeting area there under that big platform.   He banged his<br/>
head once, but not too hard, he found a slender stick and tried to poke<br/>
my shoes with it through the cracks.  He watched the tiny little fish<br/>
hiding in the shadowy shallows.  He crawled around for a long time while<br/>
I sat and counted ducks up the river and ducks down the river and ducks<br/>
flying overhead.<br/>
When he scrambled out and came to sit beside me I was writing the names<br/>
of all the ducks I  had seen and I checked my book one last time to be<br/>
sure of the spelling&#39;s, etc.  I said - you&#39;re so patient with your duck<br/>
loving mother-- and he said  &quot;You&#39;re so patient with your troll boy.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
So tonight he&#39;s working on a story called Trolls and Duck lovers and<br/>
there&#39;s some thing about a mob of angry ducks and he&#39;s doing this<br/>
terrible Edward G Robinson voice  &quot;Quack, see....Quack.&quot;  <br/>

That&#39;s really beautiful.<br/>

Deb, you should write that day up (maybe with the story he finishes if he&#39;s <br/>
interested) for Home Education Magazine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660294177">Oh Deb, what a great story!  We have a deck like this just across the<br/>
street, the kids think it&#39;s heaven.  Jonathan always collects a mass of<br/>
objects for throwing into the water before we go.<br/>

I just got this!  Crazy Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I could do that day justice.  I write down our fun days<br/>
sometimes now and put them in a box for when I&#39;m old and gray.  <br/>
<br/>
His story would be fun though.  He makes up the most wonderful stories. <br/>
One of his stories started four or five years ago.  He watched a lot of<br/>
Godzilla movies and always felt sorry for the monsters getting shot up,<br/>
etc.  He thought of a story called &quot;Monster Doctors&quot; where all the<br/>
characters were taken from our pets and other critters he knew and they<br/>
worked together as a team  to heal and help monsters.  This is still an<br/>
ongoing story, with new characters, bad guys, and plot twists.   He has<br/>
at least four other stories going at all times.   He can keep characters<br/>
straight and story lines straight and they&#39;re always interesting.  When<br/>
he adds a new character, or when one gets maimed&lt;g&gt; he draws a picture so<br/>
I can get the full effect.  <br/>
Quite remarkable. <br/>
