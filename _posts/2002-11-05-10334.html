&lt;&lt; Las Vegas just looks like a place to toss away large quantites of <br/>
cash...or is there anything else to do? With small kids?<br/>

I personally hate the Las Vegas hype and dragging kids through smokey noisy <br/>
casinos to get anywhere, but right next door is a place called Henderson, <br/>
Nevada.  It has been a long time since we went, but Henderson had a bunch of <br/>
factory tours at that time.  When we were there we went to the Ocean Spray <br/>
juice factory,  a chocolate factory, a marshmellow factory and one that made <br/>
metal clown &quot;sculptures&quot;.  Each one had huge windows to see the various <br/>
processes they go through in the making of their various products, and at the <br/>
end you get to sample things. I would suggest you look up Henderson online <br/>
and see if they still have those if they interest you. My family really <br/>
enjoyed it.  When we went it was summer and at 118 degrees within seconds of <br/>
exiting the chocolate factory with various goodies they were all melted, but <br/>
you would not have that problem.<br/>
