I was planning to post a big thank you for this as well!  To Pam for originally writing it, and to Lissa for re-sharing it in such a meaningful way.  I was deeply touched by the post.<br/>

<br/>
This &#39;gobsmacked&#39; me!  &quot;The best relationships in my life&quot; absolutely are those between myself and DS and DH.  Just writing about them in this manner truly highlights the specialness and importance of these relationships, and really brings my awareness to &quot;the magnitude of the little things&quot; DH and DS do on a daily basis.  My DH is our brita filler as well here, along with our laundry guy, and the only one to put the portable phone on the charger, etc (when he&#39;s out of town we are without a phone b/c it usually dies the first night!)  These &#39;little things&#39; are love, care, and support in action, and I just feel so blessed when really thinking about them.  <br/>
<br/>
And, immediately upon reading your post (which was quite emotional for me--in a happy/loving way), I joined my 2yo DS in his play with blocks, and got a big hug and a deep sniff of his sweet head.  Thanks for giving me another way to think about the &quot;most important relationships in my life&quot;, in such a way that adds joy and connection to our already wonderful lives!<br/>

Mine and my family&#39;s lives included!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376597793">No time for details right now. But I just want to say that this entire &quot;Cheese and Crackers&quot; discussion has really been inspiring for me and has changed the way I&#39;ve been viewing my kids and husband these last couple days...been thinking lots about the things we do for each other. I&#39;ve been so much more appreciative of the things they do for me. And I&#39;ve been thinking &quot;Cheese and crackers, what can I do for them right now?&quot; all the time. I&#39;ve shared this with my friend, and she and her hubby were so grateful too. <br/>
Thanks, Jenny Vaughn<br/>
