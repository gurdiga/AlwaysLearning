Pam&#39;s response was so thorough. I did want to say that the thing you might be <br/>
missing if you decide what a person should learn is this thing called <br/>
serendipity.<br/>
It&#39;s responsible for much of the learning opportunities in our house.....if I <br/>
tried to make up some lesson, we might miss out on those serindipitous <br/>
moments that I couldn&#39;t possibly plan for in my wildest dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Not one radical unschooler here has ever suggested not introducing new items <br/>
or topics of interest to your child. No one has suggested not sharing <br/>
interesting things to do, places to go or people to meet.<br/>
But there is a wide world of difference between introducing these things in <br/>
an interesting way and doing a lesson.<br/>
A lesson to me, sends a message that that is how people should learn.<br/>
And that just isn&#39;t true.<br/>
When you choose a focus for a topic, you are possibly blocking truly <br/>
wonderful moments and learning opportunities that are more meaningful from <br/>
happening.<br/>
Choosing a focus might make me miss some lightbulb moment that is ten times <br/>
more important at that moment for my child than some contrived topic.<br/>
Contrived, because instead of trusting that they will learn all that they <br/>
need, I am choosing a topic and trying to get everyone in the house focused <br/>
on the same topic in the same time frame. Why? <br/>
I say it&#39;s a lack of trust in unschooling and the fact that it does work.<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that unschooling parents aren&#39;t constantly opening doors to <br/>
their children by introducing new thoughts, ideas and topics.<br/>
How it&#39;s done, however, makes all the difference.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep using the word &quot;offer&quot; - but somehow that might seem more passive than <br/>
it really works out. I use it because I&#39;m emphasizing that we&#39;re &quot;inviting&quot; <br/>
the kids to do something or share something with us, rather than insisting <br/>
that it is time to sit down and do their math or science or whatever. <br/>
Sometimes it really is just an offhand &quot;offer&quot; - &quot;Hey, do you feel like going <br/>
to the science museum today?&quot; Or, &quot;Look at this coloring book of underwater <br/>
creatures, is this something you want?&quot; Other times it is slightly stronger, <br/>
&quot;Hey, I thought we&#39;d go to the science musuem today.&quot; (See - I&#39;m not exactly <br/>
asking, but the kids can object - &quot;NO NONO we already had plans to build a <br/>
lego castle today.&quot;) Sometimes we make plans in advance. I say, &quot;Hey guys, I <br/>
really want to go up to the Norton Simon Museum one of these days and so we <br/>
put that on the calendar. Again, if a kid really didn&#39;t want to go, I&#39;d work <br/>
out an alternative for them - staying with a friend or something. But when <br/>
they were young they usually wanted to go - we always had fun no matter where <br/>
we went and it wasn&#39;t like I tortured them, making them stay longer than it <br/>
was fun. <br/>
<br/>
I also used the &quot;Leave it laying around&quot; method a lot -- if I found something <br/>
I thought was cool for the kids, I&#39;d just get it and leave it out. Sometimes <br/>
it would get buried in the piles of stuff and reemerge months or years later <br/>
just at the right moment (there&#39;s that serendipity again) for some child to <br/>
be interested.<br/>
