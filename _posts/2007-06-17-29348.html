<div id="ygrps-yiv-408648733">Hi Sandra~<br/>
<br/>
I really liked this statement and was wondering if you would explain <br/>
further what you meant by the &quot;bypass, which looks like unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said&gt;&gt;&gt;I know that sometimes newer unschoolers seem baffled that <br/>
we&#39;re talking so much philosophy and so little (it seems to them)<br/>
practicality and &quot;how to&quot; but it&#39;s because unschooling only starts to<br/>
work after beliefs and viewpoints change. There&#39;s not really a<br/>
shortcut. There&#39;s a bypass, which looks like unschooling that will<br/>
work, but it&#39;s not sustainable if the parents don&#39;t really relax into<br/>
it and expect it to be fun and good, and unless they do the work it<br/>
takes to create the environment to allow it to work for everyone.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This just really got me thinking...and I like to think :-) So if you <br/>
feel up for elaborating, I look forward to reading. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks~ Tracy</div>

<br/>
It has happened many times.  I&#39;ve seen it in person with people whose  <br/>
kids and houses and families I know.  I&#39;ve seen it at a distance,  <br/>
when people write after a couple of years and say &quot;Oh...&quot;  Or when  <br/>
people write elsewhere and describe how they &quot;used to unschool&quot; but  <br/>
that it didn&#39;t work and now their kids are in school.<br/>
<br/>
What those situations have most visibly in common is that the kids  <br/>
end up in school, or being schooled at home.<br/>
What they have less visibly in common, but just as surely, is that  <br/>
the parents went through the motions, made some physical changes,  <br/>
paid some lip service, made some claims, but never really changed.<br/>
<br/>
For a variety of reasons, one of them school, some of them various  <br/>
facets of human nature and personal neediness, many people really  <br/>
want other people to validate them, to endorse them, to &quot;make them  <br/>
real.&quot;  The path of least resistence often causes people to skim the  <br/>
surface like a water bug, scooting from one feel-good moment to the  <br/>
next, assuming those others they bump into know what&#39;s under the  <br/>
surface of the pond even though they themselves don&#39;t know and don&#39;t  <br/>
intend to get wet enough to find out.<br/>
<br/>
For years and years it has been apparent that within the  <br/>
&quot;homeschooling community,&quot; among those who discuss it and analyze it  <br/>
anyway, the unschoolers are the cool ones.  They have the brave and  <br/>
daring explorers, the creative intellectuals, the philosophers.   <br/>
There&#39;s only so much cool to be derived from saying &quot;We use unit  <br/>
studies and Saxon math&quot; or &quot;Yeah, we use Oak Meadow.&quot;  It&#39;s easy to  <br/>
pay money and follow the directions and blame the kids if it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work.  It&#39;s easy to go to a support group and copy what it seems  <br/>
others are doing, and commiserate with them about how hard it all is,  <br/>
and share field trips and science demos.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s movement toward unschooling is more physical and oratory  <br/>
than it is mental and emotional, they can look like unschoolers very  <br/>
quickly, by getting rid of the curriculum they bought before, and by  <br/>
not requiring math and reading, and by watching movies with their  <br/>
kids and writing a lot about how much better it is.  And it will be  <br/>
better, no doubt, but will it last?<br/>
<br/>
It will last if the parents see and feel and learn *why* it&#39;s  <br/>
different, and *how* it&#39;s working.  If they&#39;re just operating copy- <br/>
cat style, or on trust in one other individual or in a group, and  <br/>
they plan to go back and ask &quot;now what?&quot; every few days or weeks,  <br/>
they haven&#39;t become unschoolers, they&#39;re just acting like  <br/>
unschoolers.  If they haven&#39;t been transformed, but are only hanging  <br/>
with the cool kids and parroting words and actions, when it stops  <br/>
working they&#39;ll jump to the next set of cool kids who seem to know  <br/>
something new and improved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260755499">Very interesting...many of your statements are thought provoking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;the parents went through the motions, made some physical changes,  <br/>
&gt; paid some lip service, made some claims, but never really changed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So true, this is key...the parents changing...deschooling themselves. <br/>
Letting go of old conditioning, conditioning that just about every <br/>
american believes. It does take bravery and few are really willing to <br/>
dive all the way in! Unschooling is a very revealing process, few are <br/>
willing to go through the process...layer by layer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;the unschoolers are the cool ones.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In school I tried so hard to be one of the cool ones, it never worked <br/>
out so well for me. I love that unschooling has finally helped me <br/>
become &quot;cool&quot; &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; If someone&#39;s movement toward unschooling is more physical and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>oratory than it is mental and emotional, they can look like <br/>
unschoolers very quickly, by getting rid of the curriculum they <br/>
bought before, and by  not requiring math and reading, and by <br/>
watching movies with their kids and writing a lot about how much <br/>
better it is.<br/>
<br/>
This is the bypass I guess, and yes I have seen it happen often with <br/>
not great outcomes. Meaning... the parents don&#39;t deschool themselves, <br/>
they don&#39;t look at themselves and how they parent. The next thing is <br/>
for them to say &quot;unschooling doesn&#39;t work&quot; and go back to curriculum <br/>
and workbooks. To me unschooling isn&#39;t about &quot;working&quot;, because it&#39;s <br/>
not about expectations. So anyone waiting for it to &quot;work&quot; is setting <br/>
themselves up...IMO<br/>
