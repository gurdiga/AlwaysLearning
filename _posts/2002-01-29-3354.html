I&#39;m sorry about Max and I hope he&#39;s feeling better today and that the<br/>
burn&#39;s not too serious after all.  <br/>
No bad burns at our house but a good solid head cracker on Grandma&#39;s<br/>
marble coffee table that took six stitches when Dylan was three.  I can<br/>
still hear that sound.  It&#39;s so horrible when they get hurt.  <br/>
I&#39;m sorry Dawn. <br/>
