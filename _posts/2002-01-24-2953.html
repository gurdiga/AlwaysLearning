and it&#39;s illegal for most retail establishments to operate on Sundays.  <br/>
Grocery stores can be open, movie theaters and video rental places, <br/>
and gas stations, but all other retail stores MUST be closed.  I lived <br/>
there for two and a half years and really hated it when I&#39;d be shopping <br/>
at the grocery store on a Sunday and they&#39;d tell me I couldn&#39;t buy the<br/>
stickers, coloring books, crayons, etc,,, for my kids because of the <br/>
darn blue law.<br/>
