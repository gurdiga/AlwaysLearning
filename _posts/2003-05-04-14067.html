  &gt; Kirby had been a hospital long labor and 10 cm and pushing and cesarean.<br/>
  &gt; Marty was a homebirth long(er) labor and 10 cm and (more) pushing and same <br/>
  &gt; old cesarean.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I wasn&#39;t interested in going for three of those.<br/>

  &gt;&quot;Were you ever in twice in labor for 24 hours and got to 10 and didn&#39;t<br/>
  have a <br/>
<br/>
  Been there, done that.... The first two I was in labor 24 and 30 hours and<br/>
  ended up with c-sections. They suck because you are worn out and exhausted<br/>
  before you have major surgery. The third though I had as a VBAC as I was<br/>
  very determined that my body could work thru it despite the medical staff!<br/>
  I did have an epidural and that was wonderful. <br/>
  THe 4th though I ended up with a section again because my water broke and<br/>
  24 hours later no contractions. The hospital here won&#39;t give you any<br/>
  pitocin to bring on contractions if you&#39;ve had a previous section so we had<br/>
  no choice.<br/>
<br/>
  I healed wonderfully with the VBAC but ALSO with the last section. I<br/>
  checked myself out of the hospital after 2 days and even gave a solstice<br/>
  party for 15 people 5 days after he was born! I think having the section<br/>
  with no drain of labor before it made a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
  As others have said the big thing is a healthy baby and healthy mom. I<br/>
  believe part of the healthy mom aspect comes from making informed choices<br/>
  about the delivery. If that has to include surgery and you have looked at<br/>
  all the aspects surrounding it then so be it. <br/>
<br/>
  I just think it&#39;s frustrating when women opt to have surgery for<br/>
  convenience or because they just don&#39;t have a clue.<br/>

  &gt; they still had a vaginal birth and that&#39;s wonderfully lucky and I&#39;m happy<br/>

Don&#39;t you think that since you had one successful VBAC,  they&#39;ll let you<br/>
attempt another?<br/>
<br/>
My first was a tramatic vaginal delivery with a 10 pounder,  second-- <br/>
cesarean with a breach and third--VBAC.   With my third,  I told them what I<br/>
wanted to do and they did it.   I think if a practiitoner or midwife isn&#39;t<br/>
OK with doing what you want,  find another.   If I learned anything during<br/>
my pregnancies,  it was to take charge and tell them what I wanted.   Also<br/>
to listen to my body.<br/>
<br/>
With Alec,  my first,  I went into labor at 36 weeks,  the doctor stopped<br/>
the labor/with drugs.   Then guess what?  I didn&#39;t go into labor and he was<br/>
huge!   I think he was ready to come out at 36 weeks.  Later on I was<br/>
visiting with my Mom and we figured out that we ovulate early and conceive<br/>
early in our cycle, so that baby was there longer than the doctor thought.<br/>
I kept telling the doctor,  I think this baby must be 2 feet long,  oh no,<br/>
he says, it just seems that way!   HA!  Alec was 23 1/2 inches long.  :-P<br/>
(Is that how you do a raspberry?)<br/>
<br/>
Did I say I learned to listen to my body?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Much of course depends on what country or state we are in when/if the next<br/>

And you are right about shopping around. But sometimes there is an<br/>
insurance issue -- if everyone your coverage includes is problematic then<br/>
it creates problems. <br/>

That&#39;s great that pregnancies empowered you so much to listen to your body.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I had to sign a statement that I was willing to risk mine and my child&#39;s death by NOT having a hep lock in place during my VBAC.  But I had done my research and knew what the risks really were and what they could do if there were an emergency.<br/>
<br/>
They did not tell me that hep locks sometimes fail, so a hep lock is no safety guarantee either.<br/>
<br/>
I would have liked a home birth, but for a number of reasons chose to go to the hospital.  I did hire a doula, who had practiced as a midwife in another state, but wasn&#39;t licensed in my state.  I met her before I was even pregnant with number 2, so we had built a nice relationship by the time baby was due.  She came to my home when labor begin and went with us to the hospital too.  I waited as long as I could to go to the hospital, so they didn&#39;t have quite as much opportunity to interfere once I got there.<br/>
<br/>
That is the thing about a hospital birth though - they want to do it their way.  (Like insisting that I have the baby on the bed rather than on the toilet &lt;g&gt;)  Maybe they assume that most parents aren&#39;t well enough informed to make the right decisions?  Maybe they are right?  The hospital sponsored birth prep classes that most people take are not enough to really inform you.<br/>
<br/>
The c-sec doc said it was cephalopelvic disproportion.  I believed it, because her head was 90th percentile and perfectly round.  It was only later that I realized that her head was like that because it did not go through the birth canal.  The midwife I had for the second one said the doc should have called it &quot;failure to progress&quot;.  Which it was - failure to progress in the time frame the doctor wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Although I had a lot of anger at the doctor and the system, I&#39;ve had to accept my responsibility in not being informed enough, from a variety of sources, on childbirth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381728919">Count me in on the csec and vbac. With Jason my water broke, no immediate contractions, <br/>
put on pit, dilated to 10, pushed for 2 hrs, they tried forceps, had csec. Jason was<br/>
9 lbs with a 15 inch head. With Kyle I ended up switching to a midwife (cnm) and<br/>
getting a doula at 35 weeks when it became apparent that my obs were not going to let<br/>
me have a say in what I wanted to do. I labored at home until 7 cms and had an unmedicated<br/>
hospital birth. I did get drugs to deliver the placenta when it did not come out and they<br/>
had to manually remove it (felt like going back into labor again). Kyle was only 7lbs<br/>
12 oz with a 13.5 inch head (so who says 2nd babies are bigger!). Luckily my labor progressed<br/>
pretty much textbook with Kyle, no complications which made it doable. I always feel bad<br/>
for folks who do everything &quot;right&quot; trying for a vbac only to have something beyond their<br/>
control lead them to another csection. <br/>
<br/>
All in all my csec was a good one...recovery went well, Jason was healthy. I was pretty beat<br/>
up after they delivered the placenta with Kyle and was surprised to not bounce back as quick as<br/>
I had expected. But it was nice not to have to recover from a csec while taking care of a <br/>
newborn and a 3 yo.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I laugh about my friend. Her first was a normal hospital vaginal birth with an epi.<br/>
Her second was a natural birth by default (she has quick labors and almost gave birth<br/>
in the elevator of the hospital). For her 3rd, she figured that she might as well do<br/>
it at home with a lay midwife (a water birth). Then she decided to be a surrogate and<br/>
obviously there are few parents who would want to &quot;risk&quot; a homebirth. Plus she got<br/>
pregnant with twins so she researched and found an *absolutely* fantastic ob who was <br/>
very hands off and willing (and experienced) with delivering breech babies. She had <br/>
her lay midwife as a doula (with the blessing of her ob). The hospital had a labor tub<br/>
but the &quot;rule&quot; was that you could not deliver in one. So my friend and her doula <br/>
just kind of planned an &quot;oops&quot; waterbirth. She said that the nurses just about had a fit<br/>
when she refused to get out but her ob was perfectly fine. Unfortunately the 2nd baby<br/>
got stuck, they tried a manual version and then were going to try an internal version<br/>
but she started hemorrhaging so she had a csection (but for a good reason and after<br/>
trying many things). Turns out baby #2 had gotten 1 hand AND 1 foot down into the birth<br/>
canal, silly little thing! Before my friend left the hospital she talked with her ob<br/>
who said there would be no problem with her going for a vbac next time. :o) She plans<br/>
to be pregnant for a different couple in the next couple of months.<br/>
<br/>
I just find it so funny that she has had just about every type of birth possible. But her<br/>
body was meant to birth babies...she has hardly any difficulty during pregnancy and has<br/>
these really short labors (I was talking with her at 7pm and she said that she thought that<br/>
she might be in labor with her 3rd but I could not tell by listening to her. She called and<br/>
left a message that Aster was born at 11!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465499202">I was simply determined. While I was pregnant with Rubin (no.4)I read the book &quot;Silent Knife&quot; about vbacs and the horrendous number of unnecessary cesareans. I found it in the LLL library. I also got a lot of the support I needed from La Leche League. <br/>
<br/>
I realized that all 3 of my cesareans had been totally unnecessary. (1. breech, c-sec 38 weeks, no labour. 2. lack of progress to suit hospitals&#39; schedule. 3. 38 weeks again cos of previous c-secs.) I got hold of all my medical records and had my midwife and doctor read them. They both agreed.<br/>
<br/>
I went through a process of huge grief (lots of crying) and huge anger. Then I accepted things as they were and got positive. <br/>
<br/>
My doctor said he wouldn&#39;t support me. I found another doctor and a midwife who would. I was referred to an ob for a check as I was classified high risk. He was fine about it too and even asked me if I was having my baby at home.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this enormous birth plan listing all the things I did and didn&#39;t want. It makes me laugh to think about it now, half the things I was avoiding weren&#39;t even being practised here at the time &lt;bg&gt; We also had to sign a form taking responsibility for any disaster.<br/>
<br/>
I laboured at home and went into hospital for the birth. It was fabulous. I was upright and did everything the way I wanted. there were no problems at all. <br/>
<br/>
After that there seemed no reason to have anything to do with the medical world at all so we just had a wonderful midwife, great friends and family at our 3 home births. They were very quick and easy. The last 2 were water births which was truly amazing. Our midwife only just arrived in time to see those 2 emerging and the last one, Murphy, was totally unassisted. Just Murphy and me and the water....makes me all warm and fuzzy to remember it......It was the final healing for me.<br/>

<h4>Joylyn at 2003-05-05 09:32:46 +0300 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717223808">I&#39;ve read this thread with interest.  I would love to have a natural <br/>
birth.  If I am every pregnant again (doubtful, with all the yucky <br/>
problems I am having, but maybe) I will again work hard at having a <br/>
vbac.  However, if I have a live healthy baby, I will be happy.<br/>
<br/>
Lexie&#39;s birth was a medical rollercoaster.  If I knew then what I know <br/>
now I could have and would have prevented it.  Or at least, if I had not <br/>
prevented the high blood pressure, I would have known my bishop score <br/>
was 0 and I would have just had a section instead of laboring for 3 <br/>
days, getting a horrid infection after they broke my water, and almost <br/>
dying from the infection.  Lexie was pretty sick too, and her heart rate <br/>
in utero went way high and then way low.  I&#39;ve never seen such a fast <br/>
section turn around and it certainly saved our lives, but I am wondering <br/>
if different choices had been made (a high protien diet, for instance) <br/>
if I coul dhave avoided much of it.<br/>
<br/>
Janene was a different story.  Her section was truly medically <br/>
necessary.  She was sideways, with tummy down and cord hanging above my <br/>
opening cervix.  We thought she was 37 weeks, later we found out she was <br/>
34 or maybe 35 weeks.  They tried a version but no go, she turned back. <br/>
 So I fought with them to wait the weekend and come in on Monday after <br/>
my parents could arrive from NM.  I went in Monday and they tried to do <br/>
an amnio to test her lungs--the placenta had shut down.  I had GD and <br/>
this is not uncommon.  After trying to get the placenta to create more <br/>
amniotic fluid, they finally, after a very long day, sectioned her. <br/>
 They said the placentia had definately shut down.  She would have died <br/>
in the next day or so if I hadn&#39;t of been in the hospital.  I really <br/>
feel, in my heart that her life was saved, although I recognize I might <br/>
feel this way, need to feel this way, to justfiy another csection.  <br/>
<br/>
At the same time I was going through Janene&#39;s birth another friend was <br/>
choosing a different route.  Her water burst and she didn&#39;t go into <br/>
labor and didn&#39;t get induced for a long time, like 7 weeks.  It was a <br/>
horrible story, she was an email friend and I wanted to tell her that I <br/>
didn&#39;t agree with her decisions but so many others were just supporting <br/>
her and her desire to have a vbac so I just stayed quiet.  She had a <br/>
horrible first birth with her first child, which ended up in a totally <br/>
unnecessary section.  Anyway, after that long time, she finally develped <br/>
and infection and her baby died and then wouldn&#39;t be born and she ended <br/>
up with a section and a dead baby and a lot of guilt and 2nd guessing <br/>
herself (I&#39;m guessing).  Her marriage almost or did break up, and her <br/>
life was forever changed.  <br/>
<br/>
As bad as a c section is, give me one of them again, I can heal, I&#39;ve <br/>
had two and I can deal with it.  Sure, I&#39;d love, absolutely love a <br/>
natural birth.  I often grieve strongly over my lack of that experience. <br/>
 But the birth process only lasts hours, maybe a day or two.  My friend <br/>
will forever grieve for her lost child, and I--I get to see mine grow <br/>
up, and maybe I can be involved in the natural birth of my grandchild.  <br/>
<br/>
I wont&#39; say that after 10 weeks or 6 months you get past the section, <br/>
you heal.  I dont&#39; believe this. I still have scar tissue pain.  But <br/>
despite this, I will say, I can heal from a section.  So yes, give me a <br/>
section, and a live baby, please.  <br/>

&gt; the book &quot;Silent Knife&quot; about vbacs and the horrendous number of <br/>
&gt; unnecessary cesareans. I found it in the LLL library. I also got a lot <br/>
&gt; of the support I needed from La Leche League.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realized that all 3 of my cesareans had been totally unnecessary. <br/>
&gt; (1. breech, c-sec 38 weeks, no labour. 2. lack of progress to suit <br/>
&gt; hospitals&#39; schedule. 3. 38 weeks again cos of previous c-secs.) I got <br/>
&gt; hold of all my medical records and had my midwife and doctor read <br/>
&gt; them. They both agreed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went through a process of huge grief (lots of crying) and huge <br/>
&gt; anger. Then I accepted things as they were and got positive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My doctor said he wouldn&#39;t support me. I found another doctor and a <br/>
&gt; midwife who would. I was referred to an ob for a check as I was <br/>
&gt; classified high risk. He was fine about it too and even asked me if I <br/>
&gt; was having my baby at home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wrote this enormous birth plan listing all the things I did and <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t want. It makes me laugh to think about it now, half the things <br/>
&gt; I was avoiding weren&#39;t even being practised here at the time &lt;bg&gt; We <br/>
&gt; also had to sign a form taking responsibility for any disaster.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I laboured at home and went into hospital for the birth. It was <br/>
&gt; fabulous. I was upright and did everything the way I wanted. there <br/>
&gt; were no problems at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After that there seemed no reason to have anything to do with the <br/>
&gt; medical world at all so we just had a wonderful midwife, great friends <br/>
&gt; and family at our 3 home births. They were very quick and easy. The <br/>
&gt; last 2 were water births which was truly amazing. Our midwife only <br/>
&gt; just arrived in time to see those 2 emerging and the last one, Murphy, <br/>
&gt; was totally unassisted. Just Murphy and me and the water....makes me <br/>
&gt; all warm and fuzzy to remember it......It was the final healing for me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Wow so you had 3 sections and then a VBAC? How did you manage to get<br/>
&gt;   someone to go for that? I am hoping that with 2 sections, VBAC, 1 <br/>
&gt; section,<br/>
&gt;   I will still be able to find someone to do at least a trial of <br/>
&gt; labor. But I<br/>
&gt;   fear it&#39;s going to be difficult.<br/>
