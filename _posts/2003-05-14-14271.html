<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Now, of course, I see the anti-pot commercials on tv (Gee...who <br/>
&gt; &gt;knew...marijauna will make your 14 year old get pregnant!) and see the <br/>
&gt; &gt;results of the &quot;drug war,&quot; and I&#39;ve lightened up considerably. <br/>
&gt; Everytime I <br/>
&gt; &gt;see one of them I just want to offer my kid a joint.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;(No, not really, in case you managed to miss that I&#39;m kidding. Put <br/>
&gt; &gt;the phone down. Calling Child Protective will really not help<br/>
&gt; anything.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I talk back to the commercials - it really bugs me that kids are getting<br/>
&gt; bombarded with one-sided, anti-drug messages. If/when these kids actually<br/>
&gt; try drugs and experience the other side, I think they feel so betrayed by<br/>
&gt; the system for shoving all the anti-drug propaganda at them for years,<br/>
&gt; they no longer trust any of it. And it is a balance thing - drugs can<br/>
&gt; create big problems or exacerbate small problems in some people. They can<br/>
&gt; also be a lot of fun, and a nice way to mellow out, or alter your<br/>
&gt; reality, or whatever. I&#39;ve done pretty much everything from heroin on<br/>
&gt; down, and I did some stupid stuff that I regret (crack houses in South<br/>
&gt; Phoenix are not pleasant places, and operating or riding in a motor<br/>
&gt; vehicle while on acid is not a good plan) but I don&#39;t regret experiencing<br/>
&gt; the drugs themselves. And the stupid commercials never mention that<br/>
&gt; part...<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Someone asked me, along with a long weird list of questions about <br/>
homeschooling, what kind of anti-drug program we were doing with Julian. <br/>
<br/>
I began laughing hysterically.<br/>
<br/>
Since Julian was pretty young, whenever one of those drug or cigarette <br/>
commercials went on, we&#39;d look over at Juls and say, &quot;Hey, Jul?&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he&#39;d <br/>
say. &quot;Don&#39;t do drugs/smoke.&quot; &quot;&quot;Okay.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It was just one of those weird ritualistic things our family got into the <br/>
habit of doing (along with our weird bedtime ritual) having little to do with <br/>
drugs.<br/>
<br/>
But when this person asked this it occurred to me that someday someone may <br/>
offer Julian drugs or a cigarette, and he may dissolve into hysterical <br/>
laughter and say &quot;My mother told me not to.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What it comes down to is that he will have to make the decisions, and however <br/>
wonderful they are, anti-drug programs DON&#39;T prevent drug use. (They&#39;ve <br/>
actually documented that the DARE program has no effect whatsoever, but <br/>
they&#39;re still funded.<br/>
