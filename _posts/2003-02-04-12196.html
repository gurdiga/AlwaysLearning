<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493381713">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to report in an incident that occurred here today.  I had my<br/>
right tonsil our yesterday as I had a lump on it and so Steve had taken<br/>
off a couple of days from work.  My doctor suggested he also take off<br/>
Wednesday as well so Steve called his boss to let him know that he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be in Wednesday either and his boss said &quot;I don&#39;t know why you<br/>
don&#39;t put Zak in school and Max in day care, that way you&#39;d be able to<br/>
do whatever you need to do without the kids bothering you&quot;  (these are<br/>
the exact words his boss, the a***hole used).  Steve said &quot;we don&#39;t want<br/>
to do that with our kids&quot; and then changed the subject.  His boss then<br/>
went on and on about the benefits of daycare for Steve (not for Max) and<br/>
I and how we could have more time together and someone else gets to look<br/>
after them without us being &quot;bothered&quot; with them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Steve said it was all he could do to not punch him down the phone.<br/>
Instead he called me (I&#39;m in bed working on recovering) and said how<br/>
depressing it is that people have this sort of attitude.  I said &quot;that&#39;s<br/>
why you need to go to the men&#39;s homeschooling meeting tomorrow night so<br/>
you can talk to other dads about this&quot;.  Thankfully we have that here.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess eventually you grow a very hard shell around those kind of<br/>
comments, but I&#39;m imagining it takes a while.<br/>
<br/>

really about a boss not wanting an employee to actually *have* a family.<br/>
The family should stay in the background and never never interfere with the<br/>
employee&#39;s work.<br/>

they are considered that much of a &quot;bother&quot; why have them at all.<br/>

the department was raving about her and said &quot;she&#39;ll be a great member to<br/>
have on faculty because she has no husband or kids so can really put a lot<br/>
into the department.&quot; So basically all of us with families are doing a crap<br/>
job!<br/>
<br/>
And get this -- the department is the College of Family Sciences!!<br/>
