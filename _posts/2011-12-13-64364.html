<div id="ygrps-yiv-582443133">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
We have recently decided to remove our 4 year old son from school. He has never liked it and we did force him to go during nursery, due to our life commitments. Reception was just too much, he had change his character and was becoming more tense and aggressive, so I decided to take a year off to be with him. Now, we are pretty sure he is not coming back, not sure yet how we are going to manage, but we will some how. <br/>
<br/>
It has been just a few weeks, and we are at the moment doing nothing... Just relaxing and enjoying time together. We are also, as parents, reconsidering the way we talk to him, norms, what we used to find acceptable, etc. We are trying to make a fresh start to allow him to recover from the bad experience. <br/>
<br/>
Main thing that we have removed are little punishments like time outs (that we introduce at home when they were introduce in his life at school, pathetic...¡) and so on. <br/>
<br/>
The thing is that he will be pushing because he wants to be punished. I guess he is too little to understand the change and second he is just testing us to check our limits under this new system... <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am finding a bit difficult, normally, I can just be patient enough and distract him into forgetting about it, I think he is just looking for love and reassurance even when he misbehaves, but other times he punishes himself, which is very difficult for me to watch because any attempt from my side to get closer just make things worse, but I feel that if I ignore him (which is what he wants) is giving up on him or proving him right. I don&#39;t know, but it just does not feel right.<br/>
<br/>
It does not happen very often, but I am a bit lost and would appreciate your thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
I guess after your comments, I will start giving more details about the experiences. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again and talk to you soon. <br/>

<br/>
Why did you call it that!?<br/>
<br/>
If you move more toward helping him do things and giving him choices, you&#39;ll find there aren&#39;t many things to punish him about.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can&#39;t rebel if there aren&#39;t strict rules.  Kids can&#39;t balk at control if you&#39;re not trying to control them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess he is too little to understand the change and second he is just testing us to check our limits under this new system... -=-<br/>
<br/>
He shouldn&#39;t need to be able to understand the change.  Most adults have a very hard time understanding the change.  Don&#39;t talk to him about &quot;the change.&quot;  Just gradually be kinder, gentler and say yes more often.<br/>

<br/>
I doubt he wants to be ignored.  Perhaps he needs to be alone for a moment to process his feelings.  That&#39;s sometimes really necessary, especially for some people.  Can you give him a quiet comfortable place to be alone with his feelings while you do something sweet for him in another room?  What I like to do, is make a nice snack and bring it to my daughter.  In the time it takes to make that snack, 10-15 mins, your kid might have calmed down and be very receptive to something sweet and kind from mom.  Sometimes I&#39;ll bring a fun card game, like &quot;go fish&quot;.  She can eat while we play a quick game of cards.  It gives a distraction and a way to start talking if your kid wants to talk.<br/>

regularly. They step from, I believe, a very traumatic birth experience and<br/>
were followed by a couple of years in daycare while I worked full time<br/>
outside of the home. I&#39;ve been in the home with her full time for over a<br/>
year (and was working only part time for the year prior to that) and still<br/>
the separation anxiety crops up, and we continue to work through it with me<br/>
making sure I am available and present and give her my full attention<br/>
during the day when it is just her and I. (This sounds intense, but as she<br/>
gets filled up she will often go and play on her own, and I get to do fun<br/>
things like the dishes and laundry ;). My daughter is now four and half<br/>
years old.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m giving you that background because when my girl gets very upset she<br/>
will often yell that she wants to be left alone. The reality is, she both<br/>
wants to be left alone (as in have me shut up ;) and she wants me near. If<br/>
I calmly, kindly, say, &quot;I understand you want a little space, I&#39;m going<br/>
into the next room for one minute and then I&#39;ll come and check on you&quot; she<br/>
panics - her separation anxiety is triggered and everything is suddenly<br/>
about me not leaving as opposed to her figuring out her emotions by getting<br/>
some space to that. It&#39;s not a good situation. What I have recently started<br/>
doing instead is simply saying &quot;I understand you want some space right now.<br/>
I&#39;m going to step over here/sit over here and quietly wait while you have<br/>
some space and quiet&quot;. I don&#39;t leave the room. I literally step a foot or<br/>
two away and I keep my mouth shut so she can have the peace and quiet to<br/>
find her own center again.<br/>
<br/>
You could be right that your child doesn&#39;t want to truly be left alone, and<br/>
you could be wrong. I&#39;ve found that giving just a little physical space and<br/>
shutting my mouth helps my girl both sort out the emotions of the moment<br/>
and NOT trigger the panic of separation anxiety for her.<br/>

What do you consider misbehavior? If you&#39;re still seeing actions as misbehaving, and you&#39;re not doing ANYthing, there&#39;s a disconnect there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280616955">My husband and daugther seem to be really struggling with getting along <br/>
lately.  My daughter frequently gets quite angry at him when she percieves <br/>
him doing something &#39;wrong&#39;, which to her means not the way she pictured it <br/>
in her mind, and then my husband gets quite upset and feels she is being <br/>
ungrateful.<br/>
<br/>
An example is that today I bought some melting chocolate for my daughter, <br/>
and she wanted to melt it in her toy saucepans.  Her dad explained that we <br/>
couldn&#39;t put the saucepans in the microwave (nor are they designed to be <br/>
used on the stove, they&#39;re toys), but we could heat it in a bowl, then pour <br/>
it into the saucepan.  My daughter said that would work, so dad started <br/>
heating the chocolate in the microwave.  He took the chocolate out to stir <br/>
it part way through, and my daughter got upset that he was stirring it <br/>
because she wanted to.  Dad was concerned that it would be too hot for her <br/>
(the bowl itself gets painfully hot when heating).  He poured it into her <br/>
little saucepan, and she stirred it there.<br/>
<br/>
Then she poured it into her toy cake pan, but there wasn&#39;t enough, so dad <br/>
offered to melt some more, and asked how much.  Daughter said she would like <br/>
two of each colour, but dad said that probably wouldn&#39;t be enough.  Then he <br/>
asked her if she wanted to use some of the chocolate pieces that had started <br/>
to melt (in the sun), and she totally lost it, screaming that he&#39;d ruined <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
My husband went off into the other room, and my daughter did eventually calm <br/>
down.  I could point out to him a few points where he could have done things <br/>
differently (accepting that she only wanted two of each piece of chocolate <br/>
for example), and I explained to my daughter that if she wants to do <br/>
something a particular way, she needs to ask, not scream.  But other than <br/>
that, I&#39;m not sure how I can help them.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is usually OK about it after a few moments, it&#39;s really my <br/>
husband who&#39;s struggling.  He came from a very strict background, where he <br/>
was expected to say thanks for something and appreciate it even if it wasn&#39;t <br/>
what he wanted, and where what his parents said went, regardless of his own <br/>
opinions, so I think this is impacting on it.  He frequently says &#39;she&#39;s not <br/>
even grateful for what I&#39;m doing&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
It is really impacting on him, to the point where he has said that he would <br/>
rather not be here many days.  Some of this is his own issues (he suffers <br/>
from depression and anxiety, and has a very low self esteem), but the way my <br/>
daughter screams at him so frequently (at least once or twice most days) <br/>
isn&#39;t helping.  I find myself being harsher on her than I feel I should be <br/>
simply to stop her screaming at my husband, who is obviously very <br/>
distressed.  I&#39;m not really sure what else I can do.  I don&#39;t want to send <br/>
my daughter to school, though that would give my husband a break from her <br/>
constant presence (we both work from home).  I do try to take her out a <br/>
couple of times a week so that my husband can have some quiet time, and she <br/>
can play with her friends, but lately she hasn&#39;t wanted to go anywhere, and <br/>
playdates with her friends have ended similarly, with her yelling at them <br/>
and wanting to go home, saying she never wants to visit again.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone see any obvious flaws in how I&#39;m handling it, and anything I <br/>
could be doing differently.  Any great pages that I could suggest my husband <br/>
read?  He&#39;s very open to unschooling, and completely on board with it, but <br/>
he is struggling more with the actual implementation than I am, possibly <br/>
because he has less time to read as much as I have read.  It has taken me so <br/>
long to get to the point where I have a better relationship with my <br/>
daughter, and I want to help him find ways that work for him too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will help to mentally shift from doing less &quot;working through it&quot; and more responding to her underlying needs. Lots of kids who haven&#39;t been traumatized want and need their moms close. (My daughter didn&#39;t even like going to the bathroom by herself until she was 11ish.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really only the current society that is creating the *image* of it being natural for 4 yos (or 8 yos or 10 yos) to be away from their parents. Day care and preschool forces kids apart from their families. Little kids don&#39;t choose that. Most kids do their best to survive and adapt, but it&#39;s not what they need to thrive.<br/>

<br/>
I think you might be using too many words still. Just a compassionate okay and then let your actions speak.<br/>

<br/>
If he has needs and you&#39;re being a roadblock saying no, *is* it a good thing if he gives up his need? It&#39;s convenient for you as a parent. But is that what you want him to do as an adult when he has a need? To give up when someone says no? Or do you want him to persist to find safe, respectful, doable ways to get what he wants in the world?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he is just testing us to check our limits under this new system... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He may be testing but it&#39;s better not to see it in the negative way most parents say that.<br/>
<br/>
When anything changes, people try to figure out the new rules are by trying things out. If he is testing, that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s experimenting and seeing what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Or he may be trying to get his needs met.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, I am finding a bit difficult, normally, I can just be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When kids are very little, up to toddlers, distraction is good. Everything is interesting so finding something better to do is less frustrating for the child than trying to make something safe that isn&#39;t safe for them.<br/>
<br/>
As they get older, though, the more you treat their want seriously, helping them find safe, respectful, doable ways to get something, the stronger the relationship. The child will trust you&#39;re there to help rather than someone who keeps getting in their way <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think he is just looking for love and reassurance even when he misbehaves,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That makes it sound like a test, like he doesn&#39;t trust that you always love him. So it would be good to examine how he might be getting that message. It would be good to look at your own responses through his eyes. Or it might be a phase. But good to examine it!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but other times he punishes himself, which is very difficult for me to watch<br/>
&gt; because any attempt from my side to get closer just make things worse,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s punishing himself for trying to meet his own needs when you say no, you&#39;ll want to put more effort into saying yes!<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s punishing himself for mistakes, that can be rough to see a child do. But be compassionate and see it as how he needs to process things right now.<br/>
<br/>
Reassure him that you&#39;re nearby for when he needs you.<br/>

done, giving her plenty of time to answer. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay SOMEtimes, but it&#39;s not okay for you to sublimate your life (and your husband&#39;s) to letting her have her way about everything all the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m also much better at <br/>
understanding that when she&#39;s upset at something, I need to look at what <br/>
she&#39;s upset at rather than telling her not to be upset.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not working very well.<br/>
Sometimes she&#39;s upset when it would be better for her and her family for her to have options.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could coach her about making choices.  She&#39;s old enough to think about that, at seven.  It won&#39;t be at the same level as your choices, but before she yells or cries, she should think.   Is it good?  Is it right?  Will it help? Will it make her a better person?   Not all those questions at once, but at least one of them each time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And, don&#39;t get discouraged. My middle daughter, at 7, could rarely be<br/>
rational once she was upset by something and she was very easily upset. At<br/>
24, she is THE most reasonable person I know - she can stay calm and<br/>
focused, her skills at dealing with conflict and frustration and staying<br/>
solution-oriented are so good that she is the go-to person for many others<br/>
who turn to her when problems arise.<br/>
<br/>
When she was young, she had to work at working with others, dealing with<br/>
other people not seeing things her way, not doing things her way. There<br/>
were many times I despaired because she seemed so unreasonable.  And there<br/>
were many times I did the wrong thing and frustrated her even more by my<br/>
own impatient behavior. Knowing what I know now, if I had a do-over, I<br/>
could remain far more calm and rational, myself, and be more helpful to<br/>
her. But, we did fine and she&#39;s a natural leader these days - collaborates<br/>
extremely well.<br/>
<br/>
One recommendation I have is not to say too much about this stuff. Give her<br/>
just a little input and make it very very short. &quot;Other options?&quot;  She is<br/>
possibly easily overloaded with sensory input. She&#39;s very easily frustrated<br/>
(so that one wrong move by you or your husband sets off a chain reaction).<br/>
<br/>
Find ways to reduce the overall frustration level in her life, but, at the<br/>
same time, find something that she enjoys doing with other people that does<br/>
require her to wait her turn and do things the way other people decide. My<br/>
daughter benefitted tremendously from Destination Imagination - a creative<br/>
problem solving group activity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937721282">Sometimes my son and my husband have a hard time communicating.<br/>
What has helped is the same thing that I do between my son and my daughter.<br/>
Just last night my husband was feeling shunned by my son and my son was avoiding his dad.<br/>
<br/>
This has been going on for a couple days. So Yesterday I asked my son what happened.<br/>
Did dad do anything he did not like? &quot;NO&quot;<br/>
Did he say anything he did not like? &quot;I do not remember what it was anymore.&quot;<br/>
So I pointed out to him all the nice things dad does for him and how dad loves him and that<br/>
he should think about forgiving whatever it was because dad was feeling sad that he was not spending time&#39;<br/>
with him. <br/>
My son said that he was thinking about that already.<br/>
I did the same with my husband . I pointed out how just a few weeks ago my son was doing all this things with dad.<br/>
When dad got home my son went and gave him a hug.&#39;<br/>
They are fine now.<br/>
<br/>
I also learned that I was the cause of a lot of it when I got in the middle and kept telling my husband he was doing and saying the wrong things.<br/>
In a way I sabotage their relationship because I wanted dad to  do exactly like I do with my son. I needed to let them figure out<br/>
how to relate without getting in the middle, or helping on the sidelines. But I used to just jump in and in front of my son tell his dad he<br/>
was doing it wrong. Well that did not help them at all in their relationship. I did not trust dad to do it just right and of course my son <br/>
witnessed that. Once I stepped back, still help as needed, and I let their own relationship blossom things got so much better.<br/>
I still give tips to my husband of how it could help  if my son is upset and I still point out to my son how much dad loves him and all he does.<br/>
Before a lot of what my son saw was me telling my husband he was wrong and did not do it right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK I don;t know how clear that was but just wanted to clear that  &quot;doing it right&quot; means  talking, playing, relating and about how they were with one another and how my husband was relating to my son.<br/>

I agree.  VERY short messages.<br/>
&quot;Did you make a choice?&quot; might be one of them.<br/>

If she&#39;s making your husband so unhappy that he doesn&#39;t want to be at the house, that&#39;s gone too far, I think.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;If she&#39;s making your husband so unhappy that he doesn&#39;t want to be at the house, that&#39;s gone too far, I think.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also if you are always jumping in between her and him to rescue her when all he did was try to help her ( even if things backfired) he may be feeling like he can do nothing right and he is not needed or welcomed. No wonder he wants to not be there.<br/>
No one wants to feel like all they do is wrong and it looks like he was trying to play with her and help her out.<br/>
Once I no longer expected that my husband  relate to my son just like I did they were able to  connect.<br/>
My husband found HIS way .<br/>
I was many times the road block. How could my husband learn what made our son happy or not if he did not get the chance to find out and learn.<br/>
I was always in the way cutting in and telling him all he was doing was wrong and not the right way ( my way).<br/>
<br/>
I did not trust my husband to do it the right way ( my way) . How do you think he felt?<br/>
He felt like he was not wanted, needed, loved and that he could never measure up.<br/>
<br/>
If it was not for finding unschooling and extending the principles beyond  how I treated my child and towards my husband I am sure we<br/>
would not be like we are today. I still struggle at times. I still need to remind myself of all this and their relationship still has some bumps here and there<br/>
but they love each other very much and we are learning everyday to be more mindful towards each other<br/>

She is quite insistent that she wants the iPhone version of the game, not the high definition version (I think in reaction to my husband and I being too insistent that the high definition was better).  She is the one playing the game, so it really makes little difference to me, and insisting that I&#39;m right is only going to make her more determined that she&#39;s right.  <br/>

I feel that some of this stems from being an only child (perhaps I&#39;m imagining this though?) as she has limited chances to play these games with other children.  When she has friends over, they would love to play computer games with her (which she really enjoys doing when alone) but she doesn&#39;t want to, because it takes away from imaginary play.  They, on the other hand, all have brothers and sisters to play with, so focus a lot more on active games or other things to do.<br/>
<br/>
This is another frustration my husband is dealing with, that my daughter wants to play large amounts of imaginary games with him, and he really doesn&#39;t feel like playing the amount she seems to need.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t.  I would say she can only have the couch to herself when no one else wants it, and if she doesn&#39;t want to share she should sit somewhere else.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it should be only about whether it&#39;s going to affect him.   Does it affect HER?  Is her demanding nature causing her to be a mean person?  That affects her and the rest of the world.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t need to encourage selfishness.  If you&#39;re going to be a team, rather than adversaries, you need to be on her team, and TEAM, not you her abused servants.  Help her be generous.  Help her be fairminded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422283058">So my son , who is 9 years old, is having this heated discussion on youTube with some people/hunters who<br/>
are in favor of hunting wolves.<br/>
So I have been reading it and here is something he wrote and I was very surprised that he used punctuation.<br/>
That is something he slowly started using. Sure he does make mistakes spelling and grammatical errors too.<br/>
 (I apologize in advance for some of the language as he has been  very upset and this  guy ( who seems to be about 40) has been really obnoxiously calling him names since the discussion started a day ago. I could edit it out if it offends )<br/>
<br/>
==-=-=-=-<br/>
&quot;I hate you. Idiot...Wolves are EXTREMELY important for the ecosystem.Have you never heard that they eat dead bodies found in the forest?They clean the forest.So what if they kill deers?It&#39;s the circle of life, many animals(humans) kill deers,or something else,because they have to eat. It&#39;s not true that a stuffed wolf would chase﻿ and kill another animal, exception being killing for puppies&#39; meat or killing the intruders who get too close﻿ to their nest. I hope you don&#39;t get the tag.BTW,fuck you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
By the way he does not use this language in everyday life and he does not call his sister any names , or me and dad , even when he is upset. <br/>
<br/>
He has really been into wolves lately and has read about 10 books he got in the library about wolves. He also looks up videos on youtube and that is how this started.<br/>

<br/>
What has *he* asked for? What parts does *he* want ideas for? Have you asked him if he wants ideas?<br/>
<br/>
You said he&#39;s open to unschooling so maybe he does want some ideas. You said he grew up in an authoritarian home so he probably has a limited tool box of ideas to draw from. But *he* needs to want ideas for the parts that are bothering *him*. That&#39;s true whether the other person is a child or an adult.<br/>
<br/>
He also needs to trust himself that he has the ability to figure this out. If you&#39;re watching him, judging him, and he&#39;s coming up short in your eyes, that&#39;s going to undermine his confidence. You need to look at what he&#39;s doing right and project confidence that he can figure this out. Again, true whether a child or an adult.<br/>
<br/>
If he wants ideas, you could bring his wording here (not filtered through your ideas of what needs fixing about him.)<br/>
<br/>
Possibly, with his permission, if he wants them, -- depending on how much he trusts that you&#39;re *not* trying to fix him -- you might send him a general list of ideas that has worked for you. And then back off. Let him work with them. Or not.<br/>

I liked his punctuation, but maybe asking him to balance his opinion, to tone it down, could be helpful.  He&#39;s getting frothed up about something about which he might want to consider the other side of the argument.<br/>
<br/>
Have you talked to him about wolves and calves?  He&#39;s living on a dairy farm.  And I take it your calves aren&#39;t just any old &quot;love children&quot; of bored and rutting bulls and cows left to their own devices.    But people whose herds increased the natural way aren&#39;t fond of wolves, coyotes, or other people&#39;s dogs.  For good reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Dead bodies in the forest take care of themselves, or birds or ground-animals, insects, worms do that.   It seems to me that woves&#39; biggest fans are dreamy-eyed city kids.  OF COURSE I could be wrong about a lot of wolf-return proponents, and your son isn&#39;t one,  but having grown up in the non-urban western U.S., with parents and grandparents who did too (and I don&#39;t know how far back some of the greaty-greats were in the southeastern U.S., also farmers or small-town people), the idea that wolves rights would be held up over the safety of people, their livestock and their pets seems unfair or unbalanced.  (Not mentally unbalanced; rhetorically unbalanced.)<br/>
<br/>
But the punctuation was cool. :-)<br/>
Especially the apostrophe in &quot;puppies&#39; meat&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
And of course there are those who&#39;d say that putting the welfare of one<br/>
species and their pets or livestock over that of the larger ecosystem is<br/>
where the unfairness lies!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s thought about the livestock vs. wolves thing and still came out<br/>
for the wolves?<br/>
