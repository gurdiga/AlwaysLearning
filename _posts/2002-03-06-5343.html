<div id="ygrps-yiv-124633485">Hi Nanci K.,<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!!<br/>
<br/>
If you would feel comfortable doing so, would you expound some on your<br/>
intentional community?  I find the subject fascinating.<br/>

list if the others aren&#39;t interested?  Or perhaps suggest some resources to<br/>
learn more?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745556523">This is for everyone who contacted me, on and off<br/>
list, about Intentional Community.  ICs have been<br/>
around since Buddah&#39;s day and probably before.  Most<br/>
though, were about religion, then politics.  There is<br/>
a modern resurgance in the last 30 years of the<br/>
movement internationally to create communities solely<br/>
as a social change to create and sustain better lives.<br/>
 It began with counter cultural communes in the 70&#39;s,<br/>
but continues today with all types of communities. <br/>
Communes are identified by egalitarian principles<br/>
(total income sharing) and often a shared ideology<br/>
and/or faith.  They often have a charismatic<br/>
figurhead.<br/>
<br/>
But Intentional Communities are very much more than<br/>
communes, which is only one specific type of<br/>
community, just like rye is one type of bread.  The<br/>
movement in this country is growing at a feverish<br/>
pace.  CoHousing is particularly big.  It is a Swedish<br/>
concept that Americans are embracing.  CoHousing is<br/>
identified by the &quot;balance the traditional advantages<br/>
of home ownership with the benefits of shared common<br/>
facilities and ongoing connections with your<br/>
neighbors&quot; as it says at the CoHousing Network<br/>
Homepage.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cohousing.org/">http://www.cohousing.org/</a>  This is a good<br/>
resource for learning more about CoHousing and finding<br/>
groups, communities and individuals in your area.  <br/>
<br/>
The Intentional Communities website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ic.org/">http://www.ic.org/</a><br/>
is a great place for information too.  Their listing<br/>
of communities is very comprehensive and includes<br/>
CoHousing, group houses, urban cooperatives,<br/>
egalitiarian groups, and other types of communities.<br/>
<br/>
Our community, Rain Dance Village on Cedar Hill, is<br/>
located here on our 16+ acres on the Olympic<br/>
Peninsula.  We are in the Rain Shadow of the Olympics,<br/>
in the area which includes the islands in the Pugest<br/>
Sound and is known as the Banana Belt of the NW for<br/>
it&#39;s warm and temperate climate.  It is warmer and<br/>
drier than Seattle and Olympia, but still a lush NW<br/>
forest.  The Peninsula is 3/4 State and National<br/>
parks, and most of the privately owned land is very<br/>
undeveloped.  But we are 20 minutes from Port Townsend<br/>
(which sounds a lot like that town folks we talking<br/>
about here recently - was it Virginia City?)  PT is a<br/>
Victorian Seaport and home for a thriving arts<br/>
community, many local craftsmen, a rich wooden<br/>
shipbuilding tradition and school, and many eco-aware<br/>
and alternative folks.  It&#39;s nothing to see a mom in a<br/>
restaurant breastfeeding a 4 year old here, or any<br/>
number of other nice alternative type stuff like that.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are about an hour from Tacoma, an hour and a half<br/>
from Seattle and within that same distance radius to<br/>
many other areas around here, including the islands. <br/>
Anyway, we love it here.  We are building a community<br/>
which has a permaculture and natural/eclogical focus,<br/>
building small natural and sustainable cottages and<br/>
growing organic food, recycling greywater and so<br/>
forth.  We are committed to living in community and<br/>
are also building a community house in which we can<br/>
share group meals as desired and get together in other<br/>
ways.  We are a continuum concept based village, with<br/>
all unschoolers so far, non-religious or political,<br/>
open minded, and concensus based.  Other plans in the<br/>
works are a sweat lodge (designed by a Native American<br/>
family who are deeply involved in their heritage); <br/>
and a combined Bath House and Hot Tub, with an<br/>
adjoining &quot;Garden Shed&quot; with snack area, indoor lounge<br/>
and covered patio for busy gardeners to relax in.  <br/>
<br/>
We are sort of a hybrid, not quite CoHousing, since<br/>
members will not legally own their specific dwelling<br/>
and the land it sits on.  Legally we are forming as a<br/>
Housing Cooperative, with each person/family owning a<br/>
share of the total community, which includes their<br/>
dwelling.  This means we get to buy back someone&#39;s<br/>
shares who is leaving the community, and we choose who<br/>
to resell to based on someone who is a good fit in the<br/>
community.  We are just getting started out here and<br/>
plan not to exceed a smallish, extended family style<br/>
village with a handfull of families.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I answered the questions and provided the<br/>
information requested.  If not, please let me know.<br/>

<br/>
So how do you work out the legalities?<br/>
How and by who was  the land bought?<br/>
How many families are in your village?<br/>
Do you have to sign in for a number of years?<br/>
How much is it to each family? Are the houses the same?<br/>

Pullman &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series.  The animosity towards the books got me<br/>
reading the first one, which we owned but hadn&#39;t started yet.  Very<br/>
interesting!  I can see how it would piss off protestants, though!  (The<br/>
Calvinists won and took over the papacy...)  (I&#39;m only on Chapter 3 of The<br/>
Golden Compass.)<br/>
<br/>
What I found most interesting (though not surprising) was that one or two<br/>
people posted negative reviews, then a few others thanked them for warning<br/>
them and said they&#39;d never read the books.<br/>

I stepped down from moderating that list so now I can respond to stuff like<br/>

You could do a report on the latest &#39;Naturalist Life Styles&#39; book and come <br/>

probably be discussed for years.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would that be disliked? Though I&#39;m not sure I<br/>
would enjoy the book...is it tedious?<br/>
<br/>
IRL the Calvanists were persecuted. My maiden name is<br/>
Varnedoe (Varnedeaux). There is no one in France with<br/>
that name, left. One small family went to Spain, one<br/>
to Switzerland, and <br/>
Nathaniel Varnedeaux and one child arrived in Georgia<br/>
in 1701.<br/>
<br/>
My Mother called the Huegenots &#34;those Damned<br/>
Calvanists&#34;. They were more stiff-necked than any<br/>
Catholics ever were. <br/>
<br/>
I went to my Mother&#39;s brother&#39;s funeral, last<br/>
Wednesday. Aunt Martha woke me up on my birthday with<br/>
a phone call to tell me that Uncle Frank had just<br/>
died. Amazing. I haven&#39;t seen or spoken to her in 36<br/>
years, or any Rockwells, at all, in 24. I have sent<br/>
the occasional card and note. This had so touched her,<br/>
that she called me first. Who knew? My cousins were<br/>
grateful that my brother and Roy and I went to this<br/>
funeral. Surprised us.<br/>
<br/>
I did ask Roy not to wear his skull and cross bones<br/>
helmet-liner to the actual funeral. He wore the<br/>
lizard-skin looking one, instead. I saw him peaking<br/>
into the casket, at the viewing. He had told me he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to see any dead guys, and I had told him<br/>
he didn&#39;t have to look if he didn&#39;t want to. But he<br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
A little two and half girl-cousin latched onto Roy,<br/>
calling him My Boy. She wouldn&#39;t let anyone sit in any<br/>
seats that Roy had occupied. She hugged and hugged him<br/>
and held his hand. At the family gathering afterwards<br/>
(at the orange grove, were I lived when I was little)<br/>
Roy watched out for her. He saw a water moccasin just<br/>
moments after I had warned him about the snakes there,<br/>
I saw it too. Ugly, fat one. And the alligators in the<br/>
river. <br/>
<br/>
Roy took pictures of a huge big nest in the top of a<br/>
cypress tree. We didn&#39;t get to see if it was an egret<br/>
or eagle&#39;s. I saw a black panther run through the yard<br/>
there, at the grove, when my little brothers and I<br/>
were playing on the porch (now enclosed and the yard<br/>
is part of the grove)47 years ago.  It looked at us,<br/>
so beautiful, ....Grandmother saw it too....then it<br/>
ran away, in a furtive sort of way. A few minutes<br/>
later two hunters on horseback with dogs rode up,<br/>
tracking that cat. One of the last. They were really <br/>
black jaguars, not  panthers. If the light is right<br/>
you could see the spots. Grandmother shocked me by <br/>
saying we hadn&#39;t seen the black panther. I was glad,<br/>
but the dogs knew which way it went, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What used to be endless miles of palmetto and the<br/>
occasional stand of pine is not anymore. It is<br/>
subdivisions and different sorts green stuff and more<br/>
groves.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the cousins agreed that we didn&#39;t HAVE to pass<br/>
everything on down to the next generation :-) We could<br/>
stop the cycle. Start new ones. One cousin&#39;s daughters<br/>
were there, of which one was a third grade teacher.<br/>
She was a bit offended that we were unschoolers, but<br/>
savvy enough NOT to ask questions or make comments<br/>
(maybe she was merely respecting her elders, or<br/>
intimidated LOL) But the look in her eyes. Oooh. Oh<br/>
well. Some others were so HAPPY that they hugged and<br/>
kissed us. And they did trust Roy to keep Stella (the<br/>
little one) safe in that snakey, alligatory place that<br/>
had no fence between the house and the steep steep<br/>
river bank.<br/>
<br/>
Things have changed, some are for the better, some not<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Tolkien and Lewis were best friends, along with Charles Williams and other<br/>
scholars/writers at Oxford who met in the pub on Thursday nights to read and<br/>
discuss their current work.  (Tolkien wasn&#39;t too impressed with the Narnia<br/>
books, since they did not create as complete a world of fantasy as Middle<br/>
Earth, his own life&#39;s work.  Lewis knocked out Narnia in a much shorter<br/>
time.)  C.S. Lewis made a character of Tolkien in the Space Trilogy; Ransom<br/>
is based on him.  A fascinating book, named after their own group&#39;s name, is<br/>
&quot;The Inklings,&quot; by Humphrey Carpenter.<br/>
<br/>
Last November, I received by email an article about the fear-mongering of<br/>
Christians over Harry Potter books, which included this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...Rowling remains a member of the Church of Scotland and keeps<br/>
saying, &quot;I believe in God, not magic.&quot; She also has stated that the<br/>
magical elements in her books come from her studies in British folklore.<br/>
This means she is trying to tap some of the same wellsprings as C.S.<br/>
Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and even Charles Dickens.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Last year, Rowling told a Canadian reporter that she is a Christian and<br/>
that this &quot;seems to offend the religious right far worse than if I said I<br/>
thought there was no God. Every time I&#39;ve been asked if I believe in God,<br/>
I&#39;ve said, &#39;yes,&#39; because I do. But no one ever really has gone any more<br/>
deeply into it than that and, I have to say that does suit me. ... If I<br/>
talk too freely about that, I think the intelligent reader -- whether 10<br/>
or 60 -- will be able to guess what is coming in the books.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256020035">Apparently I goofed.  I sent this response only to<br/>
Liza.  So here it is again, for everyone else who was<br/>
interested.  By the way, just FYI, the 20 acres<br/>
adjoining our property with a view of Lake Leland<br/>
(very nice parcel) is still for sale.  About 80,000.00<br/>
I believe, from the same owner.  That one is South of<br/>
us, and is flatter, has fantastic Southern exposure,<br/>
some great cleared space for agriculture, a well in<br/>
place, a yurt platform in place in the woods, and<br/>
power within easy reach right at the road.  There is<br/>
reportedly a black bear who calls our area home as<br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
We wanted to buy that lot as well, but could not<br/>
afford both by our selves, and no one else was in<br/>
position to put in big money yet at that time.  Now we<br/>
have one family who has sold their house and another<br/>
which is in the process, but we didn&#39;t then.  I keep<br/>
hoping, though, that some folks who want to have a<br/>
similar and connected community to ours will buy it so<br/>
we can work together as two small villages.  The<br/>
neighbors around the lake are fantastic, by the way. <br/>
Very interested in what we are doing, suportive and<br/>
open minded.  There are also a number of other<br/>
Intentional Communities on the Peninsula and in<br/>
Seattle/Tacoma/Olympia and surrounding areas.<br/>
<br/>
Liza Sabater wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So how do you work out the legalities?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Communities all have different setups, depending on<br/>
the structure of the community, the local codes and<br/>
state laws.  In WA state (where we are) many CoHousing<br/>
communities operate under &quot;outdoor condominium&quot; laws. <br/>
Comdominium laws means that each owner has separate<br/>
legal title to an individual dwelling unit and an<br/>
undivided fractional interest in the common elements<br/>
of the project as a whole.  When it comes time to move<br/>
for any reason, the individual is mainly responsible<br/>
for selling their own home, although the process<br/>
varies by community, and many communities opt to have<br/>
first buyers rights in order to select a compatible<br/>
new owner.  Even if the homeowners are selling<br/>
seperately, communities still have the right to some<br/>
selection criteria (all are different, and some have<br/>
more than others.)<br/>
<br/>
Many other communities, ours included, operate under<br/>
the Cooperative Housing laws.  That means a member has<br/>
a membership in the cooperative corporation which in<br/>
turn holds title to the entire project. Further,<br/>
membership in a cooperative housing corporation<br/>
entitles its owner to the occupancy of a dwelling unit<br/>
in the project. This right of occupancy is appurtenant<br/>
to, and inseparable from, the membership interest in<br/>
the cooperative.  In our particular project, the<br/>
dwelling units are to be space efficient, small<br/>
natural cottages in the woods, that are owner and<br/>
community built.  When it comes time to move, a<br/>
member/family sells their shares back to the community<br/>
who keep a fund for that purpose, and then they select<br/>
and resell to new members.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How and by who was the land bought?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and I bought the land on an owner held<br/>
contract.  We have no bank loan.  We paid $15,000.00<br/>
down and have slightly higher interest than market<br/>
rate, but no bank to deal with.  The title holder<br/>
holds the contract, and takes our payments through a<br/>
title account with a local bank, which has certain<br/>
legal protections and insurance.  It is a common setup<br/>
for rural land.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How many families are in your village?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We bought the land this summer, and our family is, as<br/>
yet, alone here.  We have spent several years working<br/>
towards this, and have a very solid plan for growth<br/>
based on our experiences with other communities and<br/>
individuals.  We are taking our time to grow the<br/>
community in a stable way.  We meet frequently and do<br/>
projects on the land with prospective members, have a<br/>
mailing list to keep in touch with each other, and<br/>
correspond regularly.  We were involved with members<br/>
before we found this land.<br/>
<br/>
A family of 5 (unschooling, mom, dad, 14 y.o.d., 11<br/>
y.o.s, and 5 y.o.d.) are planning to move in before<br/>
the end of the year.  Another couple (a female High<br/>
School teacher, and her muscian partner) are in the<br/>
beginning<br/>
stages of developing membership here.  She calls<br/>
herself a &quot;plant in the system&quot; because of her<br/>
unschooling and alternative beliefs.  A third family<br/>
(unschooling mom, dad and 13 y.o.s.) are heavily<br/>
involved in developing membership here.  A single guy<br/>
from Texas is coming out to visit at the end of the<br/>
month, to explore membership options for himself.  We<br/>
are incontact with several other prospectives.<br/>
<br/>
Our process is to get to know each other through our<br/>
various mediums; spend time working together on the<br/>
land and doing other things together; move members<br/>
onto the land on a trial basis for at least a year in<br/>
a temporary structure (such as movable small cabin,<br/>
yurt or other); then formalize membership together<br/>
legally and emotionally (probably with some kind of<br/>
shared non-religious ceremony to mark the commitment.)<br/>
 We have folks in various stages of this process.  Our<br/>
goal is to have about 5 member families here, a small<br/>
village.  We are in contact with other nearby<br/>
communities as well, and hope to function<br/>
cooperatively with them.<br/>
<br/>
Financially, trial members will pay a monthly &quot;rent&quot;<br/>
per adult (about $200.00 each) and their portion of<br/>
shared expenses, as well as purchase their own<br/>
temporary dwelling, unless we have one to offer later.<br/>
 The rent goes towards the land payment and is<br/>
non-refundable if they decide to leave.  If they stay,<br/>
it can be counted towards their total investment<br/>
costs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you have to sign in for a number of years?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, folks can leave at any time.  If they are<br/>
invested, then we would buy back their shares for<br/>
resale later on.  If they are not yet invested, it is<br/>
even easier.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How much is it to each family? Are the houses the<br/>
&gt; same?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cost for total investment has not yet been determined,<br/>
and will depend on a number of factors.  We estimate,<br/>
with 5 families, cost will be about 20-30,000.00 total<br/>
share cost.  <br/>
<br/>
They also build their own cottages, but we use much<br/>
natural, onsite materials, found materials and free or<br/>
low cost recyclables in the building process.  The<br/>
cottages will be owner/community built, and specific<br/>
to each family&#39;s design.  They will include composting<br/>
toilets and a sink which is on a greywater recycling<br/>
system.  They will contain small kitchenettes for<br/>
private family meals and snacks when desired.  Other<br/>
amenities will vary by family, but overall size will<br/>
remain small.<br/>
<br/>
We have broken ground and begun a foundation on a<br/>
partially earth bermed studio cottage in a site my<br/>
niece selected.  It will be mainly cob and natural<br/>
alder and cedar posts cut on site (cob is sort of like<br/>
clay/adobe - think those white washed cottages in the<br/>
UK) with a green living roof.  She is 16, and will be<br/>
moving up here from California in the next year to<br/>
live in her cottage.  Hers will also include a shower<br/>
on a greywater system, at her request.<br/>
<br/>
We have selected a site and broken ground and begun to<br/>
cut cedar poles for our own family&#39;s cottage.  We have<br/>
posts and beams in place in concrete for a larger<br/>
building, which will serve as our community house<br/>
(kitchen/dining/social/multi use space) when it is<br/>
done.  We are working on our bathhouse design,<br/>
gardens, ponds and other features.  We have cleared a<br/>
site for group parking, to keep half the property as<br/>
pedestrian friendly, with capabilty to drive on it to<br/>
deliver heavy items, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Currently our family is living in the single wide,<br/>
older mobile home which was on the property.  As soon<br/>
as we complete our initial cottage (a simple, one<br/>
large room open design to begin with, to get it done<br/>
quickly, which will be added to later for our<br/>
permanent dwelling) this mobile will become our<br/>
temporary community house for a year or two, until our<br/>
permanent community house is completed.  At that time,<br/>
this structure will be torn down and removed, to make<br/>
more space on this site for our extensive gardens.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend we built a pole structure porch roof from<br/>
alders (with bark and moss still in place) using all<br/>
found scrap (didn&#39;t buy a thing) for railing, brackets<br/>
to hold the beams, hardware, roofing, etc.  It looks<br/>
really great, and we set the poles in such a way that<br/>
they can be reused later in another contruction when<br/>
this mobile goes away.  It&#39;s about 7X11 feet.  We left<br/>
the posts long too, like 14 feet tall, and put the<br/>
roof down at the appropriate height with the house<br/>
roof.  That way we have more versatility to reuse the<br/>
poles later.  They are really beefy, like 8 inches in<br/>
diameter, so we should be able to get good use of them<br/>
later as structural posts elsewhere.  It really<br/>
changes the look of the mobile for the better.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, while we were banging away on it and making<br/>
a lot of noise, a family of a doe and two yearlings<br/>
came mozeying by, eating the clover and blackberries<br/>
about 10 feet away.  The deer are so funny the way the<br/>
ignore us.  I left them a piece of the banana bread<br/>
that I made yesterday, but they were more interested<br/>
in the blackberries.  I am sure something else will<br/>
eat it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, hope I answered your questions.  I gotta get<br/>
to some chores, clean up, stack some wood for the<br/>
woodstove and work on our cottage site and plan.  Have<br/>
a great day!<br/>

&gt;this mobile goes away.  It&#39;s about 7X11 feet.  We left<br/>
&gt;the posts long too, like 14 feet tall, and put the<br/>
&gt;roof down at the appropriate height with the house<br/>
&gt;roof.  That way we have more versatility to reuse the<br/>
&gt;poles later.  They are really beefy, like 8 inches in<br/>
&gt;diameter, so we should be able to get good use of them<br/>
&gt;later as structural posts elsewhere.  It really<br/>
&gt;changes the look of the mobile for the better.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Yesterday, while we were banging away on it and making<br/>
&gt;a lot of noise, a family of a doe and two yearlings<br/>
&gt;came mozeying by, eating the clover and blackberries<br/>
&gt;about 10 feet away.  The deer are so funny the way the<br/>
&gt;ignore us.  I left them a piece of the banana bread<br/>
&gt;that I made yesterday, but they were more interested<br/>
&gt;in the blackberries.  I am sure something else will<br/>
&gt;eat it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to admit, building the roof structure from raw tree stock and no<br/>
power tools was alot of fun (though exhausting for this desk jocky.)  And<br/>
I did it amost excluseively with hand tools.  The only power tool used was<br/>
a cordless drill to screw on the roofing panels.  The final product does<br/>
look a bit raw with just sections of tree trunks fastened in place bark<br/>
and all and covered, but I think it looks marvelous.  Well, at least much<br/>
better than the harsh square-metallic shape of the trailer.  The deer<br/>
coming out to feed was a nice bonus.  They have slowly been getting used<br/>
to us and this is the first time I have seen them just walk out of the<br/>
trees and feed right in front of us.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I would like to add (because I have seen a couple comments about DH<br/>
being a bit inflexable) that Nanci has opened my mind about the world. <br/>
Yes, I was pretty stuck in the modern system, but I have to admit I love<br/>
the natural surroundings of our land much better.  So there may be hope<br/>
for us males yet.<br/>
