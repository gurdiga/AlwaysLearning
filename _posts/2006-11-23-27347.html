<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717259138">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
 I just went to send a Thanksgiving card from one of my favorite <br/>
websites and it occurred to me that perhaps ya&#39;ll would like to know <br/>
about it. It&#39;s got free e-cards, games, coloring pages you can print <br/>
and that sort of thing. (I am not affiliated with the website in any <br/>
way other than a happy person to have it available). I love Jan <br/>
Brett&#39;s illustrations and books and so naturally, I love the website <br/>
too. Hope this finds you having a lovely day! Here&#39;s the link:<br/>
