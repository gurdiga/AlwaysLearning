<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900849875">The other day you said that if somebody wanted a list that was different, they could start their own and share the link here. So, that is what I did. I am the list owner. I have been on and off this list a couple times. Sometimes it gets too heavy for me and I have to unsubscribe for a while so I can play with my kids and think about what was said and try to internalize it. <br/>
<br/>
I do not want to duplicate anything that you are doing. None of the lists that I am on are support groups. I felt the need for a support group and have seen other people express the need for a support group. I am muddling through the deschooling process and would like a support group where there is some hand holding. I have been deschooling for a couple years and still feel like there is a lot that I am missing. Sometimes, it feels like forever even though it has only been a couple of years. My oldest is only 8. I didn&#39;t start doing any serious research about how I was going to homeschool until my oldest was school age (2 years ago). Before that, I didn&#39;t see the need to think in terms of school at all. The only reason that I am thinking in terms of school now is because the state says that I have to. <br/>

<br/>
No, that&#39;s fine.  The only inappropriate thing was not telling what it  <br/>
was and why.  Thanks for the clarifications.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be good to consider deschooling a temporary state,  <br/>
too, but once people get on a list it can be hard to get them back  <br/>
off. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling basics was intended to be for beginners and feed back out  <br/>
but there are people who&#39;ve been there for years and never did go back  <br/>
to a higher-level discussions.  And there are lists run by people  <br/>
other than those who created them, so your own intentions for the list  <br/>
might need to be made clear, or others after you could do things you  <br/>
didn&#39;t intend.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;deschooling forever&quot; will cause anyone to be stuck rather than  <br/>
moving away from that to actually unschooling, it could be detrimental.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631047198">I agree that deschooling should not take forever. However, the truth is that whenever I think I have something untangled, something else creeps up. I would like a place where people tell me that it is okay to be afraid and give me a pat on the back from time to time. That is clearly outside the scope of this list. I can come here and find out all about the process of unschooling and deschooling. I need a place that will support me during that process. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to unschool well. I want to unschool better. I think I might be able to unschool better if I have a support group that I can go to when I am feeling a bit insecure. <br/>

After two years, if you&#39;re still in &quot;I think I might be&quot; and not  <br/>
feeling you want to unschool well, and if you&#39;re the list owner, will  <br/>
the tone and voice of that list be strong enough to help anyone?  If  <br/>
you&#39;re creating a list so that you can get help, who will help those  <br/>
who show up and are more insecure than you are?<br/>

I don&#39;t think security comes from more discussion.  I think it comes  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509587796">Hi Connie,<br/>
<br/>
Just sharing an opinion. I understand your need completely for a place where<br/>
there is an occasional pat on the back and &quot;you&#39;re okay&quot;. I think its vital.<br/>
However, I don&#39;t think its &quot;healthy&quot; for those pats on the backs to be<br/>
started by someone who isn&#39;t secure with her own unschooling situation,<br/>
because it is going to get too easy to ignore real challenges or get<br/>
judgmental about those who stress the need to fight them. In other words,<br/>
going the opposite end of this list is likely not going to help.<br/>
<br/>
I would find such a space more useful for my support and growth if anchored<br/>
by an extremely sensitive person, who is also an experienced unschooler.<br/>
There are a few of those too - who will give rock solid advice in a way that<br/>
is &quot;idiot proof&quot; and &quot;newbie friendly&quot;. Perhaps, rather than running off on<br/>
a tangent and starting something without the core experience, it might help<br/>
if a bunch of us newbies can invite experienced unschoolers whom we have<br/>
personally found sensitive and easy to take difficult feedback from to guide<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
As for pat on back, I don&#39;t think many of us are good at doing that to each<br/>
other without demolishing our objectives. If we were, we wouldn&#39;t need such<br/>
a group, because we&#39;d be able to do it anywhere. I&#39;d rather get a couple of<br/>
slaps and hide in a hole to cope before coming back than feel good but risk<br/>
getting derailed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683792981">I woke up thinking about the &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a good unschooler, I  <br/>
want to be a better unschooler&quot; statement.    If the writer has pre- <br/>
school children, then I think people with pre-school-aged children  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be writing about unschooling at all.  Maybe just read.  Ask  <br/>
questions, but don&#39;t be advising anyone about anything that involves  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If the person who wrote &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a good unschooler&quot; has  <br/>
school-aged children, then it&#39;s a deeply disturbing idea that the  <br/>
mother wouldn&#39;t want to commit to doing a good job.<br/>
<br/>
In activity entirely unrelated to unschooling, I came across something  <br/>
I wrote two years ago, in an SCA context (medieval studies group):    <br/>
&quot;I would rather people do what&#39;s good and right than to settle for the  <br/>
minimum of what they have to do. Some haven&#39;t liked my expectations,  <br/>
and some have left.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;left&quot; I was referring to someone who had asked me to mentor him or  <br/>
her, and then opted back out when I actually had expectations of them.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the first assumption is that every child will go to  <br/>
school.  School will be assumed to have a curriculum and measurements.<br/>
<br/>
In each state, there has come some way to opt out of that school  <br/>
attendance, either by homeschooling or by creating a private school  <br/>
registration situation.   In every case they either expect or require  <br/>
that the curriculum and measurements will be continued, in another  <br/>
form, elsewhere.  In no state or nation where there is a mandatory  <br/>
school attendance law is ANYone (administration, judicial officers)  <br/>
accepting of the idea of a family doing nothing.<br/>
<br/>
If a family defines unschooling as doing nothing, that is illegal to  <br/>
pursue.  If a family wants to &quot;unschool better&quot; but not to do it well,  <br/>
that is only barely beginning to be acceptable is the child is younger  <br/>
than the age at which education become mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to be rich and full enough to be comparable to the  <br/>
learning that&#39;s presented in a curriculum, it needs to be done well.   <br/>
It needs to be rich and full.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a parent admits that it&#39;s baffling, and admits she does not want to  <br/>
do it well, then she should probably put her children in school.   <br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t easy.  She should NOT be patted on the back or have  <br/>
her hand held about maintaining a stance in which she doesn&#39;t intend  <br/>
to go so far as to really understand it and solidly commit to doing it  <br/>
well.  And she should not be helping others to settle for better  <br/>
instead of great.<br/>
<br/>
I think when people want hand holding and back patting it can be about  <br/>
her wanting it to be about her, rather than about her children.  Any  <br/>
mother who can move past her own  neediness and just DO what her  <br/>
children need done to be happy and to be playing and learning in peace  <br/>
will, right then, be less needy.  She won&#39;t need other people to tell  <br/>
her she&#39;s doing better because she will know it and feel it and her  <br/>
children will let her know it by their peace and smiles and laughter  <br/>
and hugs.<br/>

<br/>
The Unschooling Basics list was started as a newbie friendly list for  <br/>
people who felt intimidated and &quot;unsupported&quot; by the tone of this list  <br/>
and what was once a very busy UnschoolingDiscussion list.  And so  <br/>
Unschooling Basics, which is still there, already is what is described  <br/>
above.  And the deal was that I wouldn&#39;t join it.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was that those who DID start it are no longer keeping it  <br/>
going. It was passed to others who didn&#39;t necessarily understand the  <br/>
original intention.  And even early on, I heard, those who started the  <br/>
list had sometimes a harsh response to silly irresponsible ideas, and  <br/>
that surprised people who thought it should be hand-holding.  They  <br/>
discovered nearly immediately that the hand-holding is a waste of time  <br/>
and people stay on bad trails instead of getting onto good ones.   And  <br/>
the stronger responses were coming from mothers with less experience.   <br/>
Same emotional experience, less practical benefit.<br/>
<br/>
It was also supposed to have been a beginning list, from which people  <br/>
would be sent to other lists as they became &quot;intermediate&quot; or  <br/>
established unschoolers.  That didn&#39;t actually happen.  People stayed  <br/>
there.  And so it was not beginners, it was people who had been there  <br/>
and were used to it.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the deschooling discussion could go the same way.  Those who  <br/>
are good at explaining will end up staying there, because if they  <br/>
leave it will disintigrate to being advisement by people who have very  <br/>
little experience of confidence.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not guessing about these possibilities.  I&#39;ve seen them.  You  <br/>
could go and read archives of several lists and see this dynamic play  <br/>
out over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to learn to be confident unschoolers should be around  <br/>
confident unschoolers.<br/>
Those who want encouragement to move very slowly toward unschooling  <br/>
eventually should think of their children more and themselves less.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/doit">http://sandradodd.com/doit</a><br/>
<br/>
Your children get older every moment of every day and you don&#39;t have  <br/>
time to mosey on over to unschooling maybe someday.   It&#39;s not  <br/>
practical or legal or moral to think about maybe doing a little better  <br/>
over the course of years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270669055">***The Unschooling Basics list was started as a newbie friendly list for <br/>
people who felt intimidated and &quot;unsupported&quot; by the tone of this list <br/>
and what was once a very busy UnschoolingDiscussion list.***<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolingbasics started because of one of Helen Hegener&#39;s lists (in those days when she was trying to make everyone happy with a &quot;just right support&quot; list, and most of those fizzled out)  I think it was Unschooling-101.    It had been advertised as a discussion list but turned into a whine fest.   The owners of unschoolingbasics wanted a discussion list where they could write about radical unschooling without people running to Helen and whimpering about how mean radical unschoolers were.  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t privy to the details worked out about who would or wouldn&#39;t be on the unschoolingbasics list - though I know Helen was banned&lt;g&gt;   The ideas of a basics list was generally welcomed as a place to send the same old newbie questions.   It didn&#39;t start because people were unhappy with AlwaysLearning or UnschoolingDiscussion, it started because the HEM lists were so flakey. And considering who the list owners are at unschoolingbasics it should not be mistaken for a hand holding, pat you on the back beginners list.  Though some new people are probably still surprised. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a busy list almost six years old and has over 2500 people.   A few dedicated posters there like Joyce, Meredith, Schuyler are still offering steadfast advice.   Though it&#39;s true that many new people who don&#39;t really understand the philosophy are posting advice frequently and at times it can be hard to see through the murk.  <br/>

UnschoolingDiscussion, it started because the HEM lists were so  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe some people went there from the HEM lists, but by that time I  <br/>
think Joyce already owned UnschoolingDiscussion.  I had (might have  <br/>
still had, but for the death of the older iMac) the correspondence  <br/>
with Ren and Kelly.  They would promise people I wouldn&#39;t be on there,  <br/>
and would take the newcomers who were complaining on  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion and my list, and I would send them newcomers,  <br/>
and they would send me seasoned people.  I still haven&#39;t been on a  <br/>
list with Meredith, though I see her at RUN, so the plan I was in on  <br/>
about that list didn&#39;t unfold as intended.<br/>
<br/>
The point I&#39;m trying to make is that the original intentions of lists  <br/>
don&#39;t always last as long as the lists last.  This one is an  <br/>
exception.  This one was started because of people on  <br/>
UnschoolingDotcom list (later or maybe already by then re-named  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion) targetting me for bullshit and focus.   I left  <br/>
that list and started one intended from the beginning to be serious  <br/>
discussion with people who were willing to discuss things seriously  <br/>
with me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I VERY much like it when a list or webpage or blog has the owners  <br/>
name.  I don&#39;t like it when I have to wonder, or ask.  I don&#39;t like it  <br/>
when someone uses a name like &quot;Unschooling&quot; on facebook or somewhere,  <br/>
and it&#39;s way unclear who it is, but very clear that it is not the  <br/>
voice of unschooling itself.<br/>

This one is an exception because I&#39;ve stayed and continued to do the  <br/>
work to keep it on topic.<br/>

I meant to say that.<br/>
<br/>
If someone invites people over for a party and then doesn&#39;t stay and  <br/>
host that party, it sometimes gets out of control, or fizzles out.<br/>
<br/>
I think it must seem simple to host a list.  There&#39;s a lot of evidence  <br/>
out there that it&#39;s not at all.  It&#39;s simple to set up an unmoderated  <br/>
list and let it go to hell and then blame other people for it, just as  <br/>
it&#39;s easy to invite people to a party and let it get out of hand and  <br/>
not take an responsibility for that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not interested in investing my time or reputation in any such  <br/>
activities, though.<br/>
<br/>
Those without a lot of time or reputation probably shouldn&#39;t even try  <br/>
to host lists.<br/>

<br/>
Remember when Sandra posted about how to keep a good park day going? A <br/>
list is like that, too. You have to show up, a lot, even when you don&#39;t <br/>
really feel like it. You have to keep it up through down times. It needs <br/>
a lot of loving attention and nurturing. AND - most importantly, it <br/>
needs a clear focus and someone who keeps that focus and doesn&#39;t let <br/>
other people take over for their own purposes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048319470">***This one was started because of people on <br/>
UnschoolingDotcom list (later or maybe already by then re-named <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussi on) targetting me for bullshit and focus. I left <br/>
that list and started one intended from the beginning to be serious <br/>
discussion with people who were willing to discuss things seriously <br/>
with me. &lt;g&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
I used to be a member of the unschoolingdotcom list.  I didn&#39;t post there, but maintained my membership to peek in and see what was going on there.  It turned out, not so much great stuff was there.  I cared because when you do a google search on unschooling, it is the number one site that comes up and that message board is linked there.  I think that people probably go there first and get some crazy notions of unschooling explained poorly by people who really don&#39;t like Sandra, so never send links to Sandra&#39;s webpage and anyone who does gets &quot;booed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve since unsubbed so I have no idea what gets said there, but it used to be a couple of years ago, REALLY bad advice from people who didn&#39;t know what they were talking about, who wanted unschooling to mean anything that worked for each unique family.  GAG!  People sent curriculum links for advice on how to unschool math and other BS of that nature.  It&#39;s BAD!  People who do finally find there way onto better lists come with these ideas in their heads and then get all upset when someone else tells them &quot;wrong way to unschool, don&#39;t do that&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When the unschooling dot come boards disappeared, the original and awesome ones, I went straight over to unschooling dot info, which I&#39;m very happy that Sandra is working on rebuilding.  It didn&#39;t take me long to find this list and from there the unschooling basics and the always unschooled.  But this list is my favorite!  Second, I guess would be the unschooling basics, which I read at, but never post, it&#39;s a very active list.<br/>
<br/>
The radical unschooling network seems like a happy place for many, yet again, you get a lot of folks up in arms all defensive if you post anything that doesn&#39;t FEEL good.  I DO post there sometimes because that, I feel, is an important place to keep going long term, so I invest time there.<br/>
<br/>
It concerns me a bit that the wiki site isn&#39;t at all what I&#39;d like it to be, but I have no idea how to diplomatically change it.<br/>

 <br/>
Yes that&#39;s the one, the Radical Unschooling wiki site, and yes, it&#39;s because of the connection to and promotion of law of attraction.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard enough to understand and get unschooling, adding something else to it, makes it even more difficult.<br/>
 <br/>
Part of why I think this, is because of my parents.  My parents can get unschooling to a certain degree.  They understand being nicer to kids, spending more time than less with kids, and helping kids get what they want.  They can also get that humans are born learning and learn best while happy.  This is the heart of unschooling.  If they were to do a search on unschooling and see the stuff about law of attraction they&#39;d probably call me concerned that I was getting into this crazy 21st century hippy dippy nonsense.  I&#39;d have to do some damage control in that regard. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not repsonsible for what my parents believe or conclude, but they are pretty typical in many ways in how they believe and what they believe.  I don&#39;t like unschooling being represented in correlation with something it is NOT.  Unschooling is NOT law of attraction and law of attraction is NOT unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
This is my opinion and I feel pretty strongly about it!  Even, dare I say, radically so!<br/>

-=-This is my opinion and I feel pretty strongly about it!  Even, dare  <br/>
I say, radically so!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  I don&#39;t own &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;  The reason that&#39;s the  <br/>
name of my page is that when I went to make an expage.com page a long  <br/>
time ago, when web pages has a character limit, &quot;unschooling&quot; was  <br/>
already taken. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Still, it seems that for someone to name a list that is dishonest and  <br/>
purposely misleading.  &quot;LOA-unschoolers&quot; would be clear and shorter.   <br/>
But then I value clarity and honesty.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve done things over the years, whether write or speak or  <br/>
maintain a website or list, it was for other people, not for me.  Part  <br/>
of the reason I&#39;m known by name is that I&#39;ve used my own real name  <br/>
rather than a nickname.  Part of the reason is integrity.  When people  <br/>
meet my kids they don&#39;t go home and say &quot;Oh no; not a good  <br/>
situation.&quot;   We did hear that about some of the TCS people&#39;s kids,  <br/>
many years back, that their theories (and practice of not telling  <br/>
specific stories) were not &quot;producing results.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What kind of results, though?  What I&#39;ve wanted for my kids was that  <br/>
they avoid the damage school does, and that they stay curious and  <br/>
happy--that attachment parenting could extend from those toddler days  <br/>
when they only walk away from the mom by their own choice, and are  <br/>
allowed to come back when they want to (to her lap at a park, or to  <br/>
the bed at night), to the days that young adults can drive away by  <br/>
their own choice when they want to, and come back if they need to.<br/>
<br/>
This worked out well for our family.  It&#39;s working out well still.<br/>
<br/>
If anytime over the past fifteen or more years since Kirby started  <br/>
unschooling I had been thought to have been dishonest or a fraud or  <br/>
incompetent, no doubt you would have heard about that.  My kids have  <br/>
been out there, at park days here and visiting other places, and  <br/>
sometimes at conferences. Lots of families have visited here.  We&#39;ve  <br/>
visited (in subgroups and a time or three as a whole family) with  <br/>
others.  We haven&#39;t been self-promoting about our family, but neither  <br/>
have we been secretive.<br/>
<br/>
What could I have wanted to &quot;attract&quot; or &quot;manifest&quot; other than what we  <br/>
could have and do by living warmly and generously with each other?  We  <br/>
don&#39;t need to &quot;attract&quot; learning; it happens inside of us, not  <br/>
outside.  I don&#39;t need to &quot;manifest&quot; unschooling.  It&#39;s a process and  <br/>
a way of living.  I was sharing unschooling and peaceful parenting  <br/>
because it seemed important to share, and because I felt indebted to  <br/>
&quot;the community&quot; of volunteer mothers who had helped me through La  <br/>
Leche League and birthing advice and assistance.  I felt guilty for  <br/>
having talked my cousin out of homeschooling, in the 1970&#39;s, and  <br/>
wanted to do some penance to make up for that.<br/>
<br/>
What I see about &quot;the law of attraction&quot; is a scam intended to make a  <br/>
few people rich.  Amway fizzled, but the new scamway is currently  <br/>
making them money.  It won&#39;t forever.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in an unschooling discussion last year wrote something like  <br/>
&quot;The universe has promised us that we can have whatever we wish for.&quot;   <br/>
I don&#39;t remember anyone saying &quot;WHAT!?  That&#39;s nonsense!&quot;  They were  <br/>
&quot;supportive.&quot;  (Or ignored it maybe; I forget.)<br/>
<br/>
The universe hasn&#39;t promised anyone anything at all.  Gravity, maybe.   <br/>
Atmosphere and temperature are variables on this planet.  Storms,  <br/>
volcanos and earthquakes aren&#39;t caused by nor prevented by anyone&#39;s  <br/>
LoA wishboards or stated intentions.<br/>
<br/>
Human nature has some realities.  Like attracts like.  Druggies hang  <br/>
out with druggies.  Kind people who reject mean friends and avoid mean  <br/>
relatives can eventually find themselves surrounded by many more kind  <br/>
people than mean.  Honest people who don&#39;t accept or condone  <br/>
dishonesty can count on their friends, because they&#39;ve been  <br/>
discriminating about who they will call &quot;friend.&quot;    Bullshit attracts  <br/>
bullshit, or at least attracts people who can&#39;t tell bullshit from  <br/>
truth.<br/>
<br/>
If there are tools people can learn from ANY book, pamphlet, movie,  <br/>
organization, religious group, that&#39;s fine.  But if they start trying  <br/>
to apply those things to the manipulation of others then a morality  <br/>
issue comes along.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions of integrity and morality are generally way beyond  <br/>
discussions of what will help unschoolers with their eight year old  <br/>
boys today, quickly and easily.   In the long run, though, good  <br/>
unschooling and generously helping others can lead to integrity and  <br/>
morality, bit by bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609813920">If you go to wikipedia and read the &quot;Unschooling&quot; entry - it is pretty <br/>
well written. There are a few things I would quibble with (child-led is <br/>
used in a place I&#39;d prefer child-centered), but, overall, I think it <br/>
gives a person a good sense of unschooling.  In the history section of <br/>
the article it says this:<br/>
<br/>
New Mexico homeschooling parent, Sandra Dodd proposed the term &quot;Radical <br/>
Unschooling&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Unschooling">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Unschooling</a>&gt; to <br/>

and non-educational activities.^[7] <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
But if you click on that link and go to the &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; wiki <br/>
article - it has a brief description of the difference between <br/>
unschooling versus radical unschooling and then talks about <br/>
complementary philosophies such as nonviolent communication, <br/>
unconditional parenting (alfie kohn), and continuum concept.<br/>
<br/>
Then it goes immediately into a confusing section on &quot;misconceptions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

I also had the same concerns that Pam had, about the radical unschooling page linking out from Sandra&#39;s name, then when you actually go there, Sandra is hardly listed or linked.  She&#39;s there, as well as other folks, some that I&#39;m more familiar with than others.  I love learning about new people and new things, but I&#39;ve been reading on unschooling sites and reading about unschooling for 10 yrs now.  It seems that I would&#39;ve heard about some of the people linked at some point.  I guess part of what bugs me too, is that page seems to be a self promotional page for some people.  Radical unschooling shouldn&#39;t be about self promotion, as a description.  Certainly links to various long time unschooling advocates are good.  Who gets to decide?<br/>
