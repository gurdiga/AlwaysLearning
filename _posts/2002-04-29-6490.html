&lt;&lt; So what about Woody Allen? I just can&#39;t stomach his films now. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read much about and of Mia Farrow?  That wasn&#39;t a very healthy <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Some people get kind of crazed about adopting children, and more and more of <br/>
them.  We know someone personally with an odd urge to adopt.  (Oh!  Two <br/>
families, now that I think of it.)  To the obvious and direct detriment of <br/>
their already-there children, they add more.<br/>
<br/>
But that was the story of two famous people and their personal unravellings <br/>
and situations.  <br/>
<br/>
The movies are not based on that, nor about that.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who loved Harrison Ford and loved all the movies.  I like <br/>
most of those movies.  I&#39;ve enjoyed watching Harrison Ford act since American <br/>
Graffiti.<br/>
<br/>
So he left his wife.  That&#39;s none of my business.  It&#39;s sad, but they&#39;ll <br/>
recover.<br/>
<br/>
But my friend refuses to go and see another movie of his or read an article <br/>
because he left his wife.  She doesn&#39;t know either of them, and never will.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand some of Elvis&#39;s fans didn&#39;t react well when he got married.<br/>
<br/>
That is a little bit TOO much vicarious living and fantasy life.  Either like <br/>
his music or not. Have a crush on his 20 year old form or not.  But get a <br/>
grip on where you are and what is what!!  <br/>
<br/>
So unless Dan and Matthew have a crush on the robotics teacher (WHICH I <br/>
SERIOUSLY DOUBT) and unless they plan to make an icon of him which they will <br/>
turn to in times of trouble and doubt, wanting to grow up to be just like him <br/>
in every way, I don&#39;t see a problem with them continuing to learn robotics <br/>
from him.<br/>
<br/>
If the robotics-club market were broad and varied, yeah--make it one of <br/>
several factors, along with how comfortable are the chairs?  What time is the <br/>
meeting?  How&#39;s the parking?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people leave a church because they didn&#39;t like the way the pastor&#39;s <br/>
wife treated her kids.  Never mind Jesus, they want to control and approve <br/>
all aspects of the lives of those they feel are controlling and approving them<br/>
.  At least in a church it&#39;s two ways.  I&#39;m pretty sure Harrison Ford didn&#39;t <br/>
give my friend a single thought when he and his wife were disagreeing.<br/>
