I wait for them to respond and then say &quot;We&#39;re unschoolers and that&#39;s  <br/>
now what we do.&quot;  And I try always to say &quot;If you want to know more  <br/>
about it... &quot; and I used to say &quot;go to unschooling.com,&quot; when that  <br/>
was the active and hoppin&#39; place to be, but now it&#39;s not.  Now I try  <br/>
to give them my own website because it&#39;s easy to remember (for me,  <br/>
anyway &lt;bwg&gt;).  Usually they don&#39;t really want to know, but knowing  <br/>
there&#39;s a place to look can be comforting or make it seem &quot;real.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Then I say &quot;That&#39;s usually called &#39;eclectic,&#39; and unschooling works  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This came up at our park day the other day. Rosie and her friend,  <br/>
Ronny, BOTH said they&#39;d been asked more than once, and recently (they  <br/>
are 17 and 18 years old), how they learned to tie their shoes if they  <br/>
didn&#39;t go to school. They&#39;re both sort of bewildered by the question  <br/>
but the young moms sitting around in the park pointed out that kids DO  <br/>
get taught to tie their shoes in pre-school - using a practice shoe.<br/>
<br/>
So, I thought I&#39;d look to see if they still sell those big practice  <br/>
shoes that I remember having in kindergarten, and look what I found -  <br/>
a detailed description of what is taught in a state preschool. I&#39;m  <br/>
quoting just a bit of it here - the very first item includes learning  <br/>
to tie shoes. There is lot more and I found it pretty interesting: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hrchs.org/stpreschool.php">http://www.hrchs.org/stpreschool.php</a> <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***************<br/>
WHAT WILL MY CHILD LEARN IN STATE PRESCHOOL?<br/>
<br/>
EDUCATION<br/>
The most important goal is to develop and nurture a child&#39;s self- <br/>
esteem. The program believes the future success of your child depends  <br/>
on a healthy self-image and pride in his family. With this ultimate  <br/>
goal in mind, the teaching staff along with input from parents plans a  <br/>
curriculum that encourages curiosity, provides successful experiences  <br/>
for children and promotes social skills necessary to prepare them for  <br/>
later school experiences. The curriculum covers the following areas.<br/>
<br/>
CURRICULUM<br/>
Self-Help Skills: Children are encouraged to perform self-care  <br/>
routines and tasks for themselves such as: setting tables, serving  <br/>
themselves at the table, snapping, zipping, and buttoning their own  <br/>
clothes, tying shoes, putting on own jackets, taking care of toileting  <br/>
needs, brushing teeth and cleaning up after play.<br/>
***************<br/>
<br/>
Also, at the end of that page, they talk about assessment and they say:<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
ASSESSMENT<br/>
Each child is assessed to identify their developmental strengths and  <br/>
emerging skills. In order to plan an individualized learning program  <br/>
of activities, teachers will meet with parents to discuss each child&#39;s  <br/>
progress and develop strategies to meet goals. A portfolio will be  <br/>
used to collect samples of each child&#39;s work.<br/>
<br/>
We also assess children using the Child Outcomes and Results Profile.  <br/>
Infant/Toddlers are assessed four times a year with this tool.  <br/>
Preschool children are assessed three times a year. This information  <br/>
is used to plan your child&#39;s individual program. Parents will receive  <br/>
a summary of these reports at the end of each school year.<br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
Kids 4 and under, including infants and toddlers are being assessed  <br/>
multiple times a year with the &quot;Child Outcomes and Results Profile&quot;  <br/>
and their teachers are following a curriculum and collecting work  <br/>
samples to put in their portfolio. Oh, and the parents get a summary  <br/>
of the assessment results.<br/>
<br/>
I also found some articles about whether or not children need to be  <br/>
taught to tie shoes - whether it should it shouldn&#39;t be part of the  <br/>
curriculum, anymore. The argument against it is that most of the young  <br/>
kid shoes are made with velcro fasteners, these days. The argument for  <br/>
it is that tying shoes is good small motor skills practice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a large part of what allowed me to find my expert parenting self<br/>
in regards to Chamille when she was little.  She&#39;d been tying things and<br/>
making knots and cutting intricate things from the time she was 3, but<br/>
she wouldn&#39;t hold a pencil and write her name!  Some child expert told<br/>
me that she was developmentally behind in her fine motor skills because<br/>
of her lack of pencil holding!  Obviously, I knew better!  I suddenly<br/>
realized that I may know more than a lot of experts, and that what<br/>
experts know, has very little to do with my child.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to know that pencil holding isn&#39;t the only form of find motor<br/>
skills these days!  Or is it a good thing?  Why do little kids need to<br/>
be assessed anyway!  If they can&#39;t tie their shoes now, in a couple of<br/>
years they may just be able to.  Same with reading, and all those other<br/>
&quot;bench marks&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux really wanted to know how to tie her own shoes, so I showed her,<br/>
and showed her and showed her.  She figured out on her own, the bunny<br/>
ear method, and came and showed me.  It turns out my way of tying shoes<br/>
was all wrong for her!</div>

pointing out, and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  Some people are very stubborn<br/>
about these things.  I&#39;ve even heard of parents with kids in school,<br/>
saying they homeschool after school hours.  It&#39;s certainly not my<br/>
definition of homeschooling, and unschooling with a curriculum seems<br/>
about as absurd to me as homeschooling after school.</div>

They teach that in school!?  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess healthy self-image and pride in family can&#39;t be entrusted to  <br/>
amateurs or parents.  ProFESSionals are the only ones who can take a  <br/>
child away from home and then tell him to be proud of his family and  <br/>
to feel good about himself.<br/>

Eeeyew, no!  No &quot;toileting needs&quot; samples!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s boyfriend, after trying to get a job for months, got three.   <br/>
He had taken one and he kept not getting enough hours, and they would  <br/>
put him off for several days at a time, and then he got a temporary  <br/>
medical lab job with bizarre hours (4:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.), and when  <br/>
driving home from his training session, was called by an upscale shoe  <br/>
store (where he honestly would like to work) and offered a job.  But  <br/>
in the paperwork for the lab job they explained that techs must be  <br/>
willing and able to handle samples of blood, urine and feces (poo).<br/>
<br/>
The technical term &quot;feces&quot; was translated into English as &quot;poo.&quot;<br/>

There&#39;s probably some business-jargon term they could use to take the  <br/>

to tie hair ribbons and belts, and gifts, and...  Surely there are  <br/>
other uses than shoes.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes, and there may be other reasons that they are saying this...maybe <br/>
they are testing themselves, and testing the waters as they try out <br/>
new thinking patterns.<br/>
My oldest went to school for three years - for most of this time I <br/>
had absolutely no idea that homeschooling existed or (once I had <br/>
heard of it) that it was a viable for us. <br/>
During those years at school, we would fill our weekends will trips <br/>
to the beach, museum, art gallery and we would have lots and lots of <br/>
fun at home with paint and glue and mud and clay....these were our <br/>
sanity hours that helped all of us survive the school setting. <br/>
Eventually I discovered that school was impeding (on a timetable <br/>
perspective) our ability to do what we were enjoying. so we <br/>
eventually decided to leave school. I would in those days sometimes <br/>
say that I didn&#39;t have time to take the kids to school...they were <br/>
learning to much with us. <br/>
I now suggest to parents who are cautious about taking their children <br/>
out of school (remembering that a lot of adults were brought up in <br/>
these institutions themselves!) that they try to fit lots of fun, <br/>
things into their weekends and hoildays and see how that feels for <br/>
everyone. With a rich life outside of &#39;office hours&#39; they may find <br/>
that school works just fine for them, or like us it may become more <br/>
and more apparent how incompatible the institutional learning is with <br/>
who they are as a family and who the children are as people. <br/>
all the best<br/>

<br/>
The argument against it is that most of the young kid shoes are made <br/>
with velcro fasteners, these days. The argument for it is that tying <br/>
shoes is good small motor skills practice.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Lisa and Ed, very true. The hidden agenda of tying shoe laces lessons <br/>
and many more &quot;life skills&quot; is all about effective classroom <br/>
management. It is all about a Bigger Agenda, in the long run. <br/>
<br/>
To me, it is here where the trouble starts- the authorities has used  <br/>
common life skills to disguise thier own &quot;classroom management&quot; needs.<br/>
<br/>
By passing off a few more like dressing oneself and toilet needs, the <br/>
authorities has effectively encroached and transferring upon themselves<br/>
(as and when it suits them to do so, )a big part of a parent&#39;s <br/>
responsibility as the nurturing and teaching adult.  <br/>
<br/>
This has lulled alot of today&#39;s parents into thinking that it is OK to <br/>
relinquish such parenting responsibilities, and confidences that the <br/>
state have more resources, and might possibly do a more effective job <br/>
than them. <br/>
<br/>
It is very much about &quot;let the teacher tell my child what to do <br/>
because my kids don&#39;t listen to me&quot;. We(as in unschoolers) all now <br/>
know our children is capable of thier own mind and opinions. <br/>
<br/>
It is quite common to hear a grateful parent citing &quot;rather the <br/>
teacher than me&quot; comment. <br/>
  <br/>
To me, this has created the &quot;easy parenting&quot; mentality. I have known <br/>
many SAHM who see school not only as an educational method but also as <br/>
a babysitting service, which is why they groan about school holidays.  <br/>
<br/>
It has also given some irresponsible parents the perfect excuse to <br/>
wash thier hands off thier responsibilities towards thier kids very <br/>
early on; enabling them to continue thier adult life as normal; and <br/>
then to blame someone, by passing off thier kids&#39; bad behaviour as the <br/>
school&#39;s failings, and never thiers.  <br/>
<br/>
I always question &quot;Why have children when you cannot imagine loving <br/>
being near them?&quot; Why have another when you clearly dont&#39; appreciate <br/>
having the first one around you all the time? &quot;Why did they become <br/>
mothers when they clearly prefer life without such &quot;perceived <br/>
emcumbrances&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
What were they expecting from motherhood? <br/>
<br/>
This &quot;easy parenting&quot; is what they were expecting from motherhood. As <br/>
such, they are only too happy to allow the school to take away more <br/>
and more of thier parenting responsibilities, thus saving them the <br/>
hassle of needing to do themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In UK, this is how I see it.<br/>
<br/>
The state has effectively created a &quot;pass the bucket&quot; scenario between <br/>
them and the parents, whereby nobody is taking responsibility towards <br/>
the child. The state feels the parents need to do more for the child, <br/>
and the parents feel the state is not doing enough for that huge  <br/>
amount of time the child is in school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which is why when one decides to educate their youngs on thier own, <br/>
the public sees them as mad people, because the public is convinced <br/>
that we could not possibly 1) enjoy being with our kids all the time <br/>
(as alot of them clearly told me it&#39;ll drive them mad!LOL!) 2)we <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly handle the full responsibility and accountability <br/>
towards our children well being. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Again, it&#39;s back to the &quot;there must be a very good reason why schools <br/>
is teaching how to tie your shoes laces and wipe your own bum&quot; skills. <br/>
<br/>
Because it all about &quot;mind control and moulding them from young&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Never mind that Velcro is the &quot;new shoe laces&quot; and cellophane tape is <br/>
the new &quot;string&quot; to hold your postage package together; The keyboard <br/>
is the new way to &quot;write&quot; your letter, and the spell check is the <br/>
new &quot;way&quot; to learn correct spellings.  <br/>
<br/>
And that calculator is a blessing for those of us who is very <br/>
impatient. I found using the calculator has enable me and son to <br/>
continue on with our maths learning and solving many mathematical <br/>
wonders without  getting stuck, fretting and struggling thru <br/>
multiplications and long divisions. <br/>
<br/>
So many new inventions created to help us humankinds to progress <br/>
further and easier into our lives, promoting better and faster <br/>
learning as we go along. So many fantastic inventions created to <br/>
bridge our &quot;in-abilities&quot; whether it&#39;s temporary or for permanent, so <br/>
that nothing stop us being able to progress further.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So indeed, the un-deniable truth is, there must be a VERY good and <br/>
logical reason why school still insist on hanging onto old methods and <br/>
not embracing the new, insisting that our children must know how to <br/>
tie shoes laces irregardless shoes laces is on it&#39;s way out.  Soon <br/>
they&#39;ll be teaching how to have a bath, as they are already teaching <br/>
how and what to eat, and how to &quot;sex education&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The question is Why, and Who, does this Reason serve. <br/>
<br/>
By the end of the day, we all know, no matter how they dress it up, <br/>
whether it is life skills or mental skills,  the bigger agenda is <br/>
still that school is just a factory churning out future workforce <br/>
drones, law abiding, never straying and uniformingly the same and <br/>
predictable. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kid&#39;s a cellophane and Velcro tape kid LOL!! Perhap oneday, he <br/>
might get interested in finding out to tie a ribbon (maybe a <br/>
girlfriend might instigate this need? lol) or how his dad is so clever <br/>
in doing that butcher&#39;s knot for mummy&#39;s roast pork joint, and maybe <br/>
venture into knottings and ropes for a bit of kinky sex! But then <br/>
maybe not, maybe he&#39;ll stick to his Velcro and cellophane tape! LOL!!! <br/>
<br/>
My kid&#39;s fine motor skills is fantastic, all thanks to the Lego <br/>
Company for it&#39;s little bricks; and Nintendo DS for it&#39;s little stylus <br/>
and screen; that little screw driver to open up anything, for all his <br/>
toys requries constant batteries replacement.     <br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, maybe this is how they perceived  unschooling to be, like a <br/>
holiday. Every holiday &quot;day&quot; is a happy day, full of fun, full of <br/>
hope, of discoveries and harmonious living, no measuring, no targets <br/>
to meet. It is really very much that saying &quot;Today is a &quot;Present&quot;, <br/>
unveiling itself as we goes along with it&#39;s flow.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me and son&#39;s unschooling is very much like a holiday. We just believe <br/>
it should be an everyday thing, and not just limited to weekends or <br/>
holidays.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Infact, time is no longer a concept to us because we wake when we <br/>
wake, sleep when we sleep. We eat when we&#39;re hungry. We go swimming <br/>
when we feel like it, and we wear pjs all the time. Everyday is a new <br/>
day, fluid and flexible to accomodate whatever needs that arises. The <br/>
only time we observe time is when it&#39;s a doctor or dentist appt. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Every food, is food. No disticntion needed. We can have cornflakes <br/>
with soft boiled egg for dinner, we have full Japanese hot rice and <br/>
tofu and soup for breakfast and pancakes for lunch. Yesterday, we had <br/>
cupcakes for dinner and curried rice for supper at 9pm. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It may sounds lazy and irrresponsible to some, but really, it isn&#39;t.  <br/>
It&#39;s called living life to the fullest abd be happy. We are very <br/>
active all the time, and is constantly in the middle of something, <br/>
churning out loads of learnings and understanding of our world around <br/>
us. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s not how we would like to protray unschooling as- a long <br/>
hippi-ish,  leisurely, harmonious and happy holiday without <br/>
expectations, but really, our lives is very much like this, and I <br/>
cannot possibly protray it otherwise. Other than to ensure we&#39;re well <br/>
dressed and smart whenever we&#39;re step out of our house LOL! But then <br/>
this has nothing to do with unschooling, I have always been a <br/>
fashionista of some sort, i do appreciate lovely clothes and shoes and <br/>
DS is beginning to show a preferance for his own sense of style.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some may classified me as ignorant or irresponsible or neglectful <br/>
parent because of my obvious disregard to conventional parenting, with <br/>
all it&#39;s rules and regulations. But to my perception, it is on <br/>
contrary to what they say. <br/>
<br/>
Infact, I am more responsible, more attentive, more informed and <br/>
intuned with my son than I have ever been before.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, perhap they maybe right in thier perception of &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
during weekend and hoilidays only. In a sense that they could see the <br/>
joy (and not necessary the long term benefits)of unschooling - the <br/>
happiness, freedom and the luxury of being just yourself and not <br/>
having to measure up and do schedules. They seems to understand the <br/>
beneficial properties of such living and feeling, which is why they <br/>
are using it to re-cuperate and re-juvenate from thier stressful <br/>
everyday lives.   <br/>
<br/>
But I just can&#39;t imagine how they can justify it&#39;s responsible <br/>
parenting and love, when they are teaching their children to only be <br/>
happy, only be comfortable being themselves, and accept and understand <br/>
that parents are only happy and comfortable being with them, ONLY <br/>
during weekends and holidays.<br/>
<br/>
How can they justify it as positive parenting, when they teach thier <br/>
children to fear that the very core of the themselves is not good <br/>
enough. That the child need to work hard put to aside thier instinct <br/>
and desires, to concentrate on stuff like lessons, and schedules and <br/>
staying on the grades, in order to justify thier worthiness and <br/>
usefulness. <br/>
<br/>
So perhaps, they do see the goodness of unschooling, which is learning <br/>
without structure but thru living life as it is. They just don&#39;t <br/>
believe it is good enough on it&#39;s own, which is why they are using it <br/>
to supplement thier already full and structured weekday homeschooling <br/>
learnings. To how they see it, the learning still continues, on the <br/>
weekend and holidays. They are just learning &quot;non relevant, non <br/>
important, non academic&quot; stuff, according to thier perspective.   <br/>
  <br/>
To me, this is the most important and the very basis of everything to <br/>
come. Academics is just an in-evitable by-product of our unschooling. <br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241392982">My daughter can&#39;t tie a bow, but she has a blast with knots.  They are<br/>
very useful.  She learned how to tie them herself and while what she<br/>
does doesn&#39;t match a knot book, they stay together very well and she<br/>
loves doing them.  I think it started with the laces from the lacing<br/>
toys we have.  I don&#39;t know that she laced the lacing toys more than<br/>
once or twice, but she loves the string.  I also bought a plain jump<br/>
rope and it gets used more as normal rope than as a jump rope.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, this weekend she tied the rope as a leash around a small<br/>
duck and then switched to string when the duck kept falling out.  She<br/>
used the rope to have her younger brother drag get across the hardwood<br/>
floors (knotted to make a loop which she was inside) as she was a baby<br/>
and couldn&#39;t walk.  She also used the rope to connect her fort to her<br/>
brothers fort so that Lucy Little would be able to climb the rope<br/>
between them if Lucy came out of the walls at night.   Probably more<br/>
rope/string stuff, but that is what springs to mind.<br/>
<br/>
String makes great living room spider webs.  Masking tape does too :)<br/>

&gt; shoes (20 pairs) multiple times a day and &quot;teach&quot; anything else ;)&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lisa W.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The argument against it is that most of the young kid shoes are made<br/>
&gt; with velcro fasteners, these days. The argument for it is that tying<br/>
&gt; shoes is good small motor skills practice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lisa and Ed, very true. The hidden agenda of tying shoe laces lessons<br/>
&gt; and many more &quot;life skills&quot; is all about effective classroom<br/>
&gt; management. It is all about a Bigger Agenda, in the long run.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To me, it is here where the trouble starts- the authorities has used<br/>
&gt; common life skills to disguise thier own &quot;classroom management&quot; needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By passing off a few more like dressing oneself and toilet needs, the<br/>
&gt; authorities has effectively encroached and transferring upon themselves<br/>
&gt; (as and when it suits them to do so, )a big part of a parent&#39;s<br/>
&gt; responsibility as the nurturing and teaching adult.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This has lulled alot of today&#39;s parents into thinking that it is OK to<br/>
&gt; relinquish such parenting responsibilities, and confidences that the<br/>
&gt; state have more resources, and might possibly do a more effective job<br/>
&gt; than them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is very much about &quot;let the teacher tell my child what to do<br/>
&gt; because my kids don&#39;t listen to me&quot;. We(as in unschoolers) all now<br/>
&gt; know our children is capable of thier own mind and opinions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is quite common to hear a grateful parent citing &quot;rather the<br/>
&gt; teacher than me&quot; comment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To me, this has created the &quot;easy parenting&quot; mentality. I have known<br/>
&gt; many SAHM who see school not only as an educational method but also as<br/>
&gt; a babysitting service, which is why they groan about school holidays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It has also given some irresponsible parents the perfect excuse to<br/>
&gt; wash thier hands off thier responsibilities towards thier kids very<br/>
&gt; early on; enabling them to continue thier adult life as normal; and<br/>
&gt; then to blame someone, by passing off thier kids&#39; bad behaviour as the<br/>
&gt; school&#39;s failings, and never thiers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I always question &quot;Why have children when you cannot imagine loving<br/>
&gt; being near them?&quot; Why have another when you clearly dont&#39; appreciate<br/>
&gt; having the first one around you all the time? &quot;Why did they become<br/>
&gt; mothers when they clearly prefer life without such &quot;perceived<br/>
&gt; emcumbrances&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What were they expecting from motherhood?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This &quot;easy parenting&quot; is what they were expecting from motherhood. As<br/>
&gt; such, they are only too happy to allow the school to take away more<br/>
&gt; and more of thier parenting responsibilities, thus saving them the<br/>
&gt; hassle of needing to do themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In UK, this is how I see it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The state has effectively created a &quot;pass the bucket&quot; scenario between<br/>
&gt; them and the parents, whereby nobody is taking responsibility towards<br/>
&gt; the child. The state feels the parents need to do more for the child,<br/>
&gt; and the parents feel the state is not doing enough for that huge<br/>
&gt; amount of time the child is in school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which is why when one decides to educate their youngs on thier own,<br/>
&gt; the public sees them as mad people, because the public is convinced<br/>
&gt; that we could not possibly 1) enjoy being with our kids all the time<br/>
&gt; (as alot of them clearly told me it&#39;ll drive them mad!LOL!) 2)we<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t possibly handle the full responsibility and accountability<br/>
&gt; towards our children well being.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, it&#39;s back to the &quot;there must be a very good reason why schools<br/>
&gt; is teaching how to tie your shoes laces and wipe your own bum&quot; skills.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because it all about &quot;mind control and moulding them from young&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Never mind that Velcro is the &quot;new shoe laces&quot; and cellophane tape is<br/>
&gt; the new &quot;string&quot; to hold your postage package together; The keyboard<br/>
&gt; is the new way to &quot;write&quot; your letter, and the spell check is the<br/>
&gt; new &quot;way&quot; to learn correct spellings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And that calculator is a blessing for those of us who is very<br/>
&gt; impatient. I found using the calculator has enable me and son to<br/>
&gt; continue on with our maths learning and solving many mathematical<br/>
&gt; wonders without getting stuck, fretting and struggling thru<br/>
&gt; multiplications and long divisions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So many new inventions created to help us humankinds to progress<br/>
&gt; further and easier into our lives, promoting better and faster<br/>
&gt; learning as we go along. So many fantastic inventions created to<br/>
&gt; bridge our &quot;in-abilities&quot; whether it&#39;s temporary or for permanent, so<br/>
&gt; that nothing stop us being able to progress further.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So indeed, the un-deniable truth is, there must be a VERY good and<br/>
&gt; logical reason why school still insist on hanging onto old methods and<br/>
&gt; not embracing the new, insisting that our children must know how to<br/>
&gt; tie shoes laces irregardless shoes laces is on it&#39;s way out. Soon<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll be teaching how to have a bath, as they are already teaching<br/>
&gt; how and what to eat, and how to &quot;sex education&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The question is Why, and Who, does this Reason serve.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the end of the day, we all know, no matter how they dress it up,<br/>
&gt; whether it is life skills or mental skills, the bigger agenda is<br/>
&gt; still that school is just a factory churning out future workforce<br/>
&gt; drones, law abiding, never straying and uniformingly the same and<br/>
&gt; predictable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kid&#39;s a cellophane and Velcro tape kid LOL!! Perhap oneday, he<br/>
&gt; might get interested in finding out to tie a ribbon (maybe a<br/>
&gt; girlfriend might instigate this need? lol) or how his dad is so clever<br/>
&gt; in doing that butcher&#39;s knot for mummy&#39;s roast pork joint, and maybe<br/>
&gt; venture into knottings and ropes for a bit of kinky sex! But then<br/>
&gt; maybe not, maybe he&#39;ll stick to his Velcro and cellophane tape! LOL!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kid&#39;s fine motor skills is fantastic, all thanks to the Lego<br/>
&gt; Company for it&#39;s little bricks; and Nintendo DS for it&#39;s little stylus<br/>
&gt; and screen; that little screw driver to open up anything, for all his<br/>
&gt; toys requries constant batteries replacement.<br/>

<br/>
Her interest in strings *started* with wanting to use them for real<br/>
things around her. To talk about seeing the connection to the every<br/>
day world suggests that there was a disconnect from the everyday world<br/>
at one point.  It has been in her real everyday world from when she<br/>
first started doing it.  Isn&#39;t that what unschooling is all about?<br/>
<br/>
Strings, yarn, and rope are interesting and useful even this age of<br/>
velcro and tape.  They are nice things to just have around even if<br/>
your kid likes tape and velcro and has no interest in tying their<br/>
shoes.<br/>

When Holly was little, three and four, she had a friend in the  <br/>
neighborhood who loved to come to our house and paint.  We had paper  <br/>
and all kinds of water colors and she would paint merrily.<br/>
<br/>
On one of her birthdays, 6th or 7th, we gave her a watercolors book,  <br/>
with little examples and lessons, and places right on the pages and  <br/>
the water colors were mounted at the bottom.  It was really nice, and  <br/>
all self contained.  Her mom wouldn&#39;t let her use it in their house,  <br/>
though.  She said her daughter could paint at school.<br/>

gotten to do later.<br/>

interesting, since when schools first started wanting to teach it,  <br/>
parents said &quot;That&#39;s for parents to do,&quot; but sure enough nowadays  <br/>

they tell them at school?&quot;)...<br/>

If it&#39;s too much of a struggle for one of them or both to put some clothes on, I end up just telling them that we don&#39;t HAVE to, if they don&#39;t want to get dressed, we don&#39;t have to go.  they sometimes opt to stay home just because they&#39;d rather not get dressed at all!  I sware, our loose lifestyle seems pretty loose to me sometimes!!  Oh well, I keep reminding myself, and hubby, one day, they&#39;ll want to put clothes on.....I suppose, I mean, I assume!  Will they??? :)<br/>
<br/>
I, myself, have had MY PJ bottoms on ALL DAY, but the house is clean, It&#39;s all good! :)<br/>

<br/>
One day, when there&#39;s a reason to get dressed, they WILL!! LOL!!<br/>
To yur kids, at the moment, &quot;not getting dressed&quot; seems like a better <br/>
option than &quot;getting dressed&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my philosophy. When he has a reason to do something, my kid <br/>
will LOL!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, he&#39;s beginning to find the reason to put his jacket on <br/>
when outside, because it&#39;s getting to cold to be walking around in <br/>
just shorts and short sleeved t-shirts!!??<br/>
<br/>
I just let him get on with it, walking out the house with shorts and <br/>
tshirts, declaring he&#39;s not cold. I just bring along his jacket and <br/>
long pants in the car, and somewhere along the journey, he&#39;ll declare <br/>
it&#39;s cold. I suggest &quot;jacket and long pants?&quot;, and he&#39;ll think it&#39;s a <br/>
great idea and get changed in the car LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
So there you go, when there&#39;s a reason to do so, he&#39;ll do it, <br/>
naturally. <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
OOoooh Margaret...that really STINGS!!! I can see how you&#39;re too <br/>
stunned to reply LOL! Because she sounded arrogant and <br/>
patronising!!! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If she had said, &quot;you don&#39;t do lessons&quot;, that would have been <br/>
correct and fine with me. But because she said &quot;you do nothing&quot;, to <br/>
me, that is a sweeping and patronising comment that literally means <br/>
we&#39;re lazy, dozing around and doing nothing. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To me, for her to pass such comments is being discriminating and <br/>
rude. Just because we don&#39;t do schedule lessons or workbooks, <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean my child is sitting at home being brain dead and not <br/>
learning.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Margaret, I would not have let her go lightly, whether she was <br/>
being naive or not. For her to have such wrong information and <br/>
opinions about unschoolers, this itself needs to be set right. It <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do anyone good for her to pass on such negative views of us <br/>
unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It could be possible that she really didn&#39;t implied what she said, <br/>
of which even more reason for her to understand that she needs to re-<br/>
phrase her sentence. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107633527">-=-I also found some articles about whether or not children need to be<br/>
taught to tie shoes - whether it should it shouldn&#39;t be part of the<br/>
curriculum, anymore. The argument against it is that most of the young<br/>
kid shoes are made with velcro fasteners, these days. The argument for<br/>
it is that tying shoes is good small motor skills practice.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the deeper argument for it is that there are manufacturers of practice shoes <br/>
who want to justify their existing stock, and continuing manufacture.<br/>
<br/>
Math manipulatives exist because...  because?  When I was in 2nd grade we each had a <br/>
bundle of popsicle sticks in our desks.  It was probably part of the origin of Thinking <br/>
Sticks.  I used to make puzzles for Kirby by painting a picture on some popsicle sticks.  I&#39;d <br/>
put ten or twelve of them side by side and put masking tape on them and paint a simple <br/>
shape on the other side and take the tape off.  A puzzle!    <br/>
<br/>
But even without dangerous wooden sticks, kids have fingers.  If they only  have ten, big <br/>
deal--there are twenty or thirty four other kids in the room.  That&#39;s a lot of fingers.   But <br/>
part of capitalism is that there needs to be money generated and spent and schools &quot;NEED&quot; <br/>
to draw and expend capital.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988631118">My husband, Keith, has always been a knot-tying guy, since he was a  <br/>
kid.  He can make tents out of rope and anything, and did so once at  <br/>
a company picnic.  We got there and it started raining and he built a  <br/>
kitchen out of stuff we had in the car--rope and a tarp--so that the  <br/>
hot-dog cooking could proceed.  He always has bundles of rope in his  <br/>
truck, and some of these ropes he&#39;s had since before I met him 30  <br/>
years ago.  It&#39;s kind of amazing.<br/>
<br/>
And his current artistic expression has to do with carving knotwork  <br/>
into wood.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s a very mathematically-minded guy who thinks in patterns, and  <br/>
these knots come easy to him.<br/>
<br/>
There are photos of some of his stuff here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/knotwork">http://sandradodd.com/knotwork</a><br/>
<br/>
That leads to another page on which there&#39;s a photo of a shield with  <br/>
knotwork that Marty did (that second page turns to SCA names, and  <br/>
Marty is Bardolf Gunwaldtsson, and that roundshield at the bottom  <br/>
right with the yellow knotwork is Marty&#39;s.  It&#39;s leaning against a  <br/>
leather stool that Keith owns but didn&#39;t make.  It was a gift years  <br/>
ago from one of his squires.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/guestfest/knotwork">http://sandradodd.com/guestfest/knotwork</a><br/>
<br/>
And in that same medieval projects series, another friend of ours  <br/>
taught how to make nets (for hair, but it&#39;s the same as for fishing)  <br/>
and that&#39;s here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/guestfest/netting">http://sandradodd.com/guestfest/netting</a><br/>
Marty was at that one, too; he&#39;s in the video.  So is Holly.  So is  <br/>
Sadie, another unschooler friend of ours.   (They&#39;re in the knotwork  <br/>
photos too, somewhere.)<br/>
<br/>
So all these links and those sent to the list have become a new page  <br/>
in the math section:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/math/knots">http://sandradodd.com/math/knots</a><br/>
and I&#39;ll link out from there to history and art.  I&#39;m still working  <br/>
on it.<br/>

<br/>
Please don&#39;t use quotation marks loosely in these discussions.  The  <br/>
quote was &quot;Oh that&#39;s right, you don&#39;t do anything anyway.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to clarity and honesty.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It could be possible that she really didn&#39;t implied what she said,<br/>

<br/>
It wasn&#39;t an unschooling meeting, it was general homeschoolers.  She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t need to rephrase anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s fun (and useful) to let an ignorant comment go by with  <br/>
no more response than an exchange of knowing smiles.<br/>
