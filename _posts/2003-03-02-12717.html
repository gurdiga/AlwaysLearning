&lt;&lt; Ren,<br/>
 I liked your article in HEM&#39;s new issue!   Very cool.<br/>
 <br/>
 Since you&#39;re always reminiscing about Alaska I thought I mention the<br/>
 start of the Iditarod today in down town Anchorage.   Because of lack of<br/>
 snow the restart was moved to Fairbanks.   Can you believe that?   On the<br/>
 Chena river behind Pike&#39;s Waterfront Lodge. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and WOW!!  <br/>
I know a lot of folks might not like the idea of dogmushing here, but COOL.<br/>
I would love to see the start of it and to think it was right there behind <br/>
Pikes, WOW!!<br/>
I love Pikes....have fond memories of snow mobiling on the river right behind <br/>
it. Too much fun.....sigh.<br/>

Just heard a story on the radio about a woman from Florida who is up here, for the Beargrease dog race marathon (in Duluth, actually).  She&#39;s training with her huskies that she saved from shelters.  She had been training down home by having them pull her and her daughter on skate boards and roller blades.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The dogs saw snow for the first time a couple weeks ago and what did they do?   They rolled in it.  &lt;g&gt;    It was a great story.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just looked on the Beargrease marathon website and her race, which is the mid distance one, went off yesterday.    I hope she completes it!<br/>

PS  Here in Bemidji, where I live, we had to postpone some races, not enough snow.   We have gotten a few inches this week though so we will probably have the races next weekend.<br/>
