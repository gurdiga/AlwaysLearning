<div id="ygrps-yiv-23816485">Help!  I have a situation which I am having trouble<br/>
finding appropriate information about online.  Can<br/>
anyone help me with information about the<br/>
laws/regs/alternatives/options available in Washington<br/>
and where I may look for them?  Here is the problem:<br/>
<br/>
My teeneage niece, whom I raised until she was 6,<br/>
wants to come and live with us and go to college in<br/>
Washington.  She and I have a very special elationship<br/>
and we are more than happy to have her.  Neither <br/>
of us think that her dysfunctional and irresponsible<br/>
parents will stop her from leaving.  They will be glad<br/>
for one less mouth to feed mostly, and have told her<br/>
she is free to go whenever she is free from compulsory<br/>
attendance in California and they will not be fined<br/>
for truancy.<br/>
<br/>
What are her options for getting out of school in<br/>
California and getting up here to Washington State to<br/>
go to school (or not) as she decides?  In California<br/>
she can take her CHSPE to test out, but she is test<br/>
phobic.  She would like to see if there is an option<br/>
for transferring up here to HS and then getting out<br/>
based on Washington State requirements or<br/>
alternatives, which she believes to be better (less<br/>
hoops to jump through) than California.  Would this<br/>
require a parental/guardianship change, or at 16 is<br/>
she allowed to make that decision herself in WA??  How<br/>
would she transfer from there to here, simply change<br/>
her address and move?  What are her options and her<br/>
best course of action?  Can anyone point me in the<br/>
right direction for finding the information?  I am not<br/>
having a lot of luck online.<br/>
<br/>
Right now she is in a Home-Study program in California<br/>
(like independent study.)  She is an Honor Student<br/>
from 1st grade, Presidential Honor Roll student, and<br/>
Rainbow Scholar, from a below poverty level family. <br/>
She is female and 1/4 Japanese, 1/4 Arabic, so she <br/>
qualifies for scholorships and aid on several levels,<br/>
if that helps.  She really wants to get out of the<br/>
compulsory system and away from her awful home life. <br/>
She is very bright.  I would appreciate any help or<br/>
advice anyone has to offer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211547140">I think the answer to your question depends on California&#39;s <br/>
homeschooling laws.  Maybe you could find a list specific to <br/>
California homeschooling that would answer your question if no one on <br/>
this list is sure. I could answer your question if she lived in <br/>
Pennsylvania, but I don&#39;t know California law.  If she lived in <br/>
Pennsylvania, the parents would have to sign the affidavit stating <br/>
that she is homeschooled and they are the supervisors of her program, <br/>
but they can have anyone teach her.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing to look into would be making her an emancipated minor. <br/>

If you are assigned legal custody, she will actually<br/>
be a ward of the state with you as custodian. You will<br/>
most probably be asigned a case-worker.  You can just<br/>
have her live with you and get power of attorny. So<br/>
that you (she) can get medical help, go on fields<br/>
trips, cross state lines, things like that. My brother<br/>
did that for me when I had his little girl with me for<br/>
a summer.<br/>

With my sister I had legal custody. (I actually only<br/>
saw the social worker once....ever).<br/>

<br/>
To transfer into school??<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do in the U.S. is show up.  They would like for you to prove <br/>
who you are, but that doesn&#39;t always happen, and they will take anyone who <br/>
shows up.<br/>
<br/>
But this is about unschooling, right?  Why talk to a superintendent of <br/>
anything?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you are assigned legal custody, she will actually<br/>
be a ward of the state with you as custodian.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
No, wards of the state are a whole &#39;nother thing.<br/>
A family can assign temporary legal custody with a notarized form.  It&#39;s not <br/>
a big deal.   It happens for extended field trips with regularity.  They <br/>
state that you have the right to make decisions on the child&#39;s behalf and to <br/>
authorize medical treatment, and they sign it and have it notarized.<br/>
<br/>
