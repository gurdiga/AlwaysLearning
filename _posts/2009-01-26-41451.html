<div id="ygrps-yiv-958947607">I have two recommendations for anyone who wants a little project  <br/>
today.  There&#39;s a good question on food here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5111">http://www.unschooling.info/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5111</a><br/>
<br/>
The topic is &quot;Can ALL children eat per their body&#39;s needs?&quot;  and one  <br/>
quote from the body is &quot;I do understand that the radical unschooling  <br/>
approach to food lets them choose what they want. It&#39;s not meant to  <br/>
&quot;work&quot; in the sense of them choosing to eat what I&#39;d choose for them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She could use input, and I&#39;d like to see it all in one place!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other request is for an analogy for a list of 100 (my fantasy  <br/>
goal) for why unschooling might not work.  I was hoping for analogies  <br/>
from all kinds of activities and hobbies and jobs.   What I was  <br/>
thinking this morning while I was getting up was to have a list of  <br/>
things explaining why something might not work, in short phrases, for  <br/>
a matching list.   Like<br/>
Unschooling might not work because you haven&#39;t stopped teaching.<br/>
Swimming might not work because you&#39;re still standing in the shallows.<br/>
The car might not move because you still have your foot on the clutch.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a mind to contribute any of those, please leave them here  <br/>
and I&#39;ll gather them up.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
