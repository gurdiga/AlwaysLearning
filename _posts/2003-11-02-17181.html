  &lt;&lt; Caitlin 10,and Alyssa 12 would be interested in instant messaging Holly if <br/>
  she would like more friends online that unschool.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">     &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  She asked me just last week when there would be another homeschooling chat, <br/>
  and I said I guess when you organize one!   Pick a time that&#39;s not next <br/>
  Friday <br/>
  and I bet she can be there.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HollDollDodd@...">HollDollDodd@...</a><br/>

  And Moly would always welcome more emailing with other kids too. I promised <br/>
  her I would help her set up a chat since the last one went so well... I&#39;ve been <br/>
  busy and I&#39;ve put her off, which I shouldn&#39;t do especially now when she is at <br/>
  a difficult time in her life. I&#39;m having surgery in just over a week and so I <br/>
  need to set one up soon. So tell Holly and Caitlin and Alyssa and any others <br/>
  interested I will attempt to set one up sometime this week. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:GirlOracle@...">GirlOracle@...</a><br/>

We know how to set them up.  Holly knows too.  Pick a time and we can do the <br/>
inviting when that time comes.  We&#39;re mountain daylight time.  With Denver, <br/>
not with Arizona (this season).  Any hour&#39;s okay this week.<br/>

I won&#39;t be able to set it up Monday or Tuesday. My MIL is having surgery on <br/>
Monday and I have a Dr. appointment and some tests on Tuesday. I will try for <br/>
Wednesday or Thursday. But will post here and at unschooling discussion a day <br/>
before the fact.<br/>

So Sandra is going to set this one up? That is fine with me. If you all do it <br/>
on Tuesday let me know that way Moly can stay home to chat. Someone will have <br/>
to email or IM her to let her on if I&#39;m not here to help her though.<br/>

Tuesday has become less sure here.  There might be bowling with other <br/>
homeschoolers.   <br/>
*Maybe* we could set up a chat time and the kids could try every day at that <br/>
time until they figure out which days are good/best or just keep them all?  <br/>
(just an idea)<br/>

Arizona doesn&#39;t partake of daylight savings time, so some people get confused <br/>
about what&#39;s mountain and what&#39;s not.   Sometimes clocks will use Denver as <br/>

  Ok so that didn&#39;t really help.  You are as good as I am here. :p<br/>
  I always have to ask anyone out of the east coast what time is it? Pretty bad trick I think all the different times.  I&#39;m still confused but I&#39;ll be ok.  I really never know if their ahead or behind us on time, but I do know the 24 hour difference for New Zealand.  Learned that on New Years Eve in 2000 &lt;BG&gt; Stepheny<br/>
