<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436880525">&lt;&lt;She really believes her animals are very smart and tells me how she has<br/>
trained them.  The most recent thing was training her cat to flush the<br/>
toilet since he likes seeing the water swirl.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a website for her:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s all about a cat named Misha who is toilet trained. Actually, if you<br/>
type in &quot;toilet training cats&quot; on Google you can see/read some pretty<br/>
amazing stuff.<br/>
