<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955546402">It&#39;s interesting...I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, but I am.<br/>
<br/>
My kid is growing up as the son of lesbians with an active dad, unschooled, <br/>
etc.... and it still surprises me I see how different his life is. He was at <br/>
church youth group, and there was much discussion of movies that his also <br/>
teenage friends&#39; parents wouldn&#39;t let them see. Julian can see anything he <br/>
really wants to. A big bone of contention was the movie Pleasantville, which <br/>
didn&#39;t seem that risque to me. Then I remembered that color came to people&#39;s <br/>
world often when they discovered sexuality. Oooo....yeah...we wouldn&#39;t want <br/>
to give teens the idea that sex is a GOOD thing! <br/>
<br/>
There are people who call themselves unschoolers here, but few of them really <br/>
are. (Totally apart from the censorship issue)<br/>
<br/>
Is growing up very different from other kids warping my kid&#39;s life? He says <br/>
he actually likes it, and he seems to like us, which is very nice. Should I <br/>
be putting money aside for counselling for him later?<br/>
<br/>
And what are we going to do when this kid grows up and moves on with his <br/>
life? Damn...will I have to break down and get a real job? (Will he? I kind <br/>
of hope not) <br/>
<br/>
Just some bizarre unschooling rambling....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I watched that again last week, with my kids, who like the film.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
merely sex that changes them: it&#39;s the release of whatever part the person<br/>
is repressing.  The Reese Witherspoon character is one of the last to<br/>
change, and she wonders why, since she&#39;s more active than any of them and<br/>
has been for awhile; what changes her is reading and discovering the<br/>
intellectual side of herself.  I think what torqued people was the mom<br/>
masturbating in the tub, obviously with some success ;-)  People don&#39;t like<br/>
their little secrets getting out...<br/>

and not able to watch the movies he wants.  Probably a LOT better than that.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all a crapshoot, anyway.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have two lesbian friends that adopted a darling girl from China. We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about Lizzie and unschooling a lot. Cynthia&#39;s adamant that, though she <br/>
sees the benefits, this child is 1) adopted, 2) Chinese (looks different), <br/>
and 3) has two moms. She thinks that it&#39;s in Lizzie&#39;s best interest to have <br/>
&quot;everything else&quot; as *normal* as possible because she&#39;s going to seem like an <br/>
outsider enough already. She&#39;s in private school at $10,000/year. <br/>
<br/>
In our own little world, Cameron LIKES being different, too. In a way, his <br/>
friends are terribly envious of his lifestyle, although they&#39;d never really <br/>
WANT to leave their miserable school life because it&#39;s NORMAL. The friends <br/>
hate their parents for being so strict or mean. Cam&#39;s SOOO happy we&#39;re his <br/>
parents---we hear him say that all the time. Several of the friends call me <br/>
Mama Lovejoy, because I&#39;m the mom they wish they HAD.<br/>
<br/>
Given the choice of a rather &quot;wacky&quot; childhood followed by a happy adulthood <br/>
or a &quot;normal&quot; childhood followed by despair, give me WACKY and weird and <br/>
ab-i-normal any day! And a happy right now will prepare him best for a happy <br/>
tomorrow. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s happy! <br/>

One of my (many) bumper stickers reads, &quot;Why be Normal?&quot;<br/>

    That reminds me. What does the conference bumper sticker say? I couldn&#39;t<br/>
find it anywhere and the message board was down just then. TIA!<br/>

&quot;Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it<br/>
is.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>
excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to<br/>
the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last<br/>
analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is<br/>
grace.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! Rain is quite comfortable being &quot;weird&quot; (her word), and she&#39;s quite<br/>
happy with her life right now. I was thinking recently that she&#39;s doing<br/>
just exactly what she wants to do about 99% of the time, and comparing<br/>
that to me life when I was 10... mostly what I remember is being bored at<br/>
school all... day... long.<br/>
