&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here on the East coast Ticks carry Lyme Disease. If not caught in time it<br/>
&gt;can be chronic and somewhat debilitating. If caught in time, it take a MONTH<br/>
&gt;course of Antibiotic treatment which might work. The bigger ticks don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;carry it, it&#39;s the miniscule Deer tick, which is just a little bigger than<br/>
&gt;thie period at the end of this sentance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have Lyme disease and deer ticks here, too.  For all of you who have <br/>
never seen a deer tick, don&#39;t worry...you *can* see them.  They are <br/>
tiny, but chiggers are smaller.  But even when we didn&#39;t know about Lyme <br/>
disease, we checked regularly for ticks.  It&#39;s just a fact of life <br/>
around here.  Go out in the grass or the woods, come in, check for <br/>
ticks.  Usually, they haven&#39;t bitten you, unless when you were outside <br/>
you were lying in the grass for hours or something.  In all my years <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen one fall out of a tree like my mother used to tell me <br/>
(cover your hair!), but they would often be brushed on to my leg or my <br/>
socks when walking through high grass or brush.  They do like to bite in <br/>
your hair, but seems to me it takes them a long time to get there, and <br/>
you catch them crawling.  <br/>
<br/>
We eliminated a lot of tick problems when we started using Frontline on <br/>
the dogs.  Well worth the money.  If you want your yard tick-free, keep <br/>
some chickens out in it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1135140736">Chickens eat EVERYYTHING including flowers and<br/>
veggies, too.  And sctach up the roots.  I have ben<br/>
told that guinies will eat the ticks, too. However, my<br/>
SIL has dozens of free-range guinies, and still has<br/>
ticks.  She also has dogs....lots of dogs. (in<br/>
Louisia, close to Arkansas). The dogs keep the guinies<br/>
from getting too over-populated. Her gardens are<br/>
fenced.  She has cattle, pigs, horse, etc.  The cattle<br/>
get dipped. Dogs get something (she breeds St<br/>
Bernards).  <br/>
<br/>
Also...chickens get mites, just as bothersome as ticks<br/>
:-(  and West Nile (they are a good sentinale animal)<br/>
<br/>
We have chickens...penned.  The dogs, owls, hawks,<br/>
coons, etc. eat them if they are loose. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I  had ticks when I had loose chickens in the Fl<br/>
panhandle :-( before the chickens were all consumed by<br/>
other wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my experience with chickens and ticks.<br/>
But it may save you some bother to try something else<br/>
instead.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes, they DO! Personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
And they can survive in a sort of dormant, but alert<br/>
state, for hours, days, weeks, YEARS waiting,in place,<br/>
for a blood meal (OH YUCK! THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF<br/>
EVERYTHING NASTY by Joy Masoff).<br/>
<br/>
They survive controlled burns very nicely, too.<br/>
<br/>
My personal theory is that there are less wild<br/>
critters for them to plague, so they just waite around<br/>
for anything.  The wild critters are MORE bothered<br/>
than they used to be, becuase the parasitic critters<br/>
are more concentrated.  But then, I am told by old,<br/>
old-timers that it has always been a misery. And the<br/>
mosquitoes and other flies used to be worse, too.<br/>

applicator, too, if you have a cleared, flat area.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eggbay.com/">http://www.eggbay.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a poultry web ring; I&#39;m sure there are discussion lists!<br/>
<br/>
One of the links was to an article on chicken tractors at a site called<br/>
&quot;mymeals.com&quot; which I am bookmarking!<br/>
