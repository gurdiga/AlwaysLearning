<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436052253">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a member of the group, but I think this is my first real post.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get right to the point. My son is 4 years old and he absolutely<br/>
hates sunscreen. Trouble is, he has very light skin, so playing in the<br/>
sun without being pretected is a big no-no for us.<br/>
<br/>
We do not believe in using force and although we&#39;ve resorted to it out<br/>
of sheer frustration and helplessness we hate having to use all kinds<br/>
of sneaky coercion - you know: &quot;if you put on sunscreen, you&#39;ll get<br/>
candy..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But even that doesn&#39;t work, and we are really at wits end.<br/>
<br/>
He spends all time indoors, because everything in his mind is better<br/>
that sunscreen. But he also really misses doing stuff outside.<br/>
Yesterday he cried, because he couldn&#39;t go and feed the ducks by the<br/>
lake. It&#39;s really heartbreaking. <br/>
<br/>
He is a really high-need child, and he has a real temper, which I&#39;m<br/>
sure he gets from me :) But until now we&#39;ve been able to cope with any<br/>
obstacle without resorting to questionable tactics - even toothbrushing.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

Yesterday he cried, because he couldn&#39;t go and feed the ducks by the<br/>
lake. It&#39;s really heartbreaking. -=-<br/>
<br/>
A sunburn is better than crying and not doing stuff outside.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s never had any sunburn at all, he won&#39;t have any personal idea  <br/>
why sunscreen might be a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he would compromise and just let you put it on his forehead  <br/>
where he can&#39;t smell it or feel it, or maybe he would put it on his  <br/>
own arms.  Let him wash his hands afterwards so it&#39;s not on the palms  <br/>
of his hands.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve already looked for unscented gel or something  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t feel yucky to him.<br/>
<br/>
Parental inflexibility about sunscreen IS force.  You&#39;re forcing him  <br/>
to stay in.<br/>
<br/>
-=-sneaky coercion - you know: &quot;if you put on sunscreen, you&#39;ll get<br/>
candy..&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s that sneaky?  The big one is &quot;If you put on sunscreen you can  <br/>
go outside and feed the ducks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yesterday he cried, because he couldn&#39;t go and feed the ducks by  <br/>
the lake.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why didn&#39;t you write &quot;Yesterday he cried, because we wouldn&#39;t let him  <br/>
go and feed the ducks by the lake&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve put sunscreen (your beliefs about sunscreen; your preferences  <br/>
about sunscreen) between you and your son, and between your son and  <br/>
the world.  That&#39;s one big screen!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-He spends all time indoors, because everything in his mind is better<br/>
that sunscreen.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He spends all time indoors because his parents think nothing is more  <br/>
important than that sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s four.  Just because a four year old doesn&#39;t understand what  <br/>
sunscreen is for doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll be a ten year old who refuses  <br/>
sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
And not all people sunburn as easily as others regardless of the  <br/>
degree of fair skin.  Not all skin is just the same.  Some burn  <br/>
EASILY and others not so much.  I live in New Mexico, and I camp with  <br/>
people of all skin tones and some never use sunscreen and don&#39;t get  <br/>
burnt and some do and still get burnt where they forgot to put it,  <br/>
and some do out of fear and will never know whether they needed it or  <br/>
not.  They let medical and government warnings scare them.  They let  <br/>
sunscreen advertising run their lives.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s my philosophical advice, involving the principles.<br/>
<br/>
On a practical note, he might more easily let you put sunscreen on  <br/>
him if he&#39;s sitting in your lap with his back to your belly and you  <br/>
put it on without him seeing it coming.  Dentists and dental workers  <br/>
are great about approaching a mouth with tools without getting in the  <br/>
way of the eyes.  When my kids were little, the feeling of sitting in  <br/>
mom&#39;s lap having her  massage their faces was fine.  The other  <br/>
position, my hand behind their head and my fingers approaching with  <br/>
scary stuff coming toward their mouth, nose and eyes was not nearly  <br/>
comforting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543077395">When my babes were little like that they didn&#39;t much care for putting <br/>
sunscreen on their face so we would wear hats.  I&#39;d recommend using <br/>
sunscreen made for faces, it goes on much easier, not so thick.  Another <br/>
thing that would work for them was letting them do it themselves and <br/>
offering help.  They were actually pretty good at getting the stuff on <br/>
too!  They used to make sunscreen in different colors, they thought of <br/>
it as face paint!<br/>
<br/>
If those idea&#39;s don&#39;t work, let him go out anyway!  He can learn from <br/>
actually getting a sunburn or bring him in when he starts getting red <br/>
and show him (not in a &quot;I told you so sort of way&quot;).  In the early <br/>
morning hours the sun isn&#39;t quite as strong, as well as the later <br/>
afternoon hours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476736332">How about a wide-brimmed hat or other sun-protective clothing?  There  <br/>
are companies on the internet that sell clothing specifically  <br/>
designed for sun-protection.<br/>
<br/>
How about going outside early in the day or late in the day when the  <br/>
sun is not as intense?  Seek out activities that provide fresh air  <br/>
but also an abundance of shade--a well-shaded playground or some such  <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
You also might want to do a search on the overuse of sunscreen or the  <br/>
dangers of sunscreen.  There are plenty of articles on the web that  <br/>
tell a different story than the sunscreen manufacturers would have us  <br/>
believe.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being protected from the sun doesn&#39;t necessarily mean having to use <br/>
sunscreen.  My sister, who lives in sunny New Mexico, feels that <br/>
sunscreen is actually very unhealthy.  She has her kids wear long <br/>
sleeve light weight clothing and hats instead of sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
I have red hair and freckles, believe me, I know the fear of sunburn.  <br/>
I&#39;ve had some really bad ones in my life.  One or two really bad <br/>
sunburns is not going to destroy a person&#39;s skin.  I just got a lot <br/>
more freckles.  My mom has red hair too, she grew up in sunny <br/>
California boogey boarding in the waves and didn&#39;t wear sunscreen.  She <br/>
hasn&#39;t had any problems with her skin, same thing with my grandmother, <br/>
although when she was in her 70&#39;s she had a piece of skin on her nose <br/>
replaced because of potential skin cancer.  It didn&#39;t disfigure her or <br/>
cause her discomfort.  That was 70 + yrs in California without <br/>
sunscreen with fair skin and a few freckles.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 children with fair skin, one burns, the other doesn&#39;t do <br/>
anything, no burns or tans, she stays a peachy color no matter how long <br/>
she stays in the sun with or without sunscreen.  The one who burns <br/>
sometimes doesn&#39;t want sunscreen on her face, so I let her wear a cool <br/>
hat instead and have her put it on her arms herself.  She is almost 6 <br/>
and has experienced mild sunburn, so she knows vaguely how it feels.  <br/>
We don&#39;t live in a place with intense sun. <br/>
<br/>
I think forcing a kid to wear sunscreen isn&#39;t worth it.  There are too <br/>
many variables and too many other options than sunscreen.  A nice broad <br/>
brimmed hat could potentially cover most of the skin on a small child <br/>
throughout much of the time that kid is outside.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726287998">Sandra&#39;s right about skin differences.  I&#39;ve been surprised many <br/>
times that my girls don&#39;t get sunburned when I do so easily, and our <br/>
skin seems to be about the same in color.  If I don&#39;t wear a hat, my <br/>
head WILL get sunburned if I&#39;m out for more than 30 minutes or so.  <br/>
My 2 girls have never had sunburned heads.  It&#39;s kind of a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried spray-on sunscreen?  We love it here, and it&#39;s so <br/>
quick.  Also, does your son object to wearing a big hat or covering <br/>
up a bit more?  In my experience, the most easily sunburned spots <br/>
are noses and shoulders on kids.  If he&#39;s wearing a shirt that <br/>
covers up his shoulders, perhaps he would agree to just a bit of <br/>
sunscreen on his nose?  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty sad that he is prevented from fun activities just <br/>
because of sunscreen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573236426">We are all super-fair too, and definitely have learned that our kids <br/>
will burn from little accidentally exposed patches during infancy or <br/>
early toddlerhood (nothing really serious, thankfully).<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely try to think of all the factors in the equation as <br/>
flexibly as possible.  Is it the middle of the day, okay well then <br/>
try to shoot for a shorter outing if your son is amenable to that.  <br/>
Not possible, then after a little while could you suggest finding a <br/>
shady tree to play under and explore with sticks for a while?  Our <br/>
kids do tend to get too hot and tired of the glare after a while, <br/>
likely a natural protective instinct, and we generally try to get to <br/>
cover after so much time outside.<br/>
<br/>
If you know he loves loves loves to feed the ducks, how about <br/>
breakfast with the ducks?  Before the sun gets super hot, and then <br/>
you&#39;ve got some time to meander back home perhaps in time for some <br/>
lunch and downtime for him and possibly you.<br/>
<br/>
Can you find some new shady places to play?  How about looking for <br/>
lightning bugs at night, if he can make it that long.  The worst <br/>
hours of the day are from 10-2 in most places, maybe 10-4 if you&#39;re <br/>
in Arizona or the west in some of the hottest places.  There is a <br/>
whole lot of time to be out there without slathering needed.<br/>
<br/>
We have also experimented with a whole variety of sunscreens and <br/>
application methods.  At our pool the sprays are hugely popular this <br/>
year.  I also have seen a little girl who applies her own face stick <br/>
(I think it&#39;s a Whole Foods brand w/titanium dioxide) so liberally <br/>
that it is cute and comical sometimes.  If he can understand it and <br/>
be in charge, it is soooo much better.<br/>
<br/>
We go swimming every day, but our children are very comfortable going <br/>
later in the afternoon and swimming through dinner time.  There are <br/>
lots of benefits.  It&#39;s not sunburn time for us, we rarely put on <br/>
sunscreen because it&#39;s almost always after 3-4pm, and the pool is <br/>
much less crowded.  We also have a number of kids whose families do <br/>
the same thing, so we&#39;ve got a nice small group of pool friends that <br/>
have developed as a result.<br/>
<br/>
The real message is flexible thinking, of course, as it is with all <br/>
other unschooling obstacles, but hopefully this as well as the others <br/>
will help you to see that there are a lot of positive scenarios that <br/>
can develop out of it.</div>

a decision. I rarely and I mean rarely put sunscreen on my kids or <br/>
self because one sunscreen can cause problems and the older formulas <br/>
did nothing for cancer only the sunburn. <br/>
<br/>
I look at it this way- we were made to be out in the sun our bodies <br/>
need sunlight for vitamin D, no its not good to continually burn but <br/>
if you ease into it MOST people will not burn. When I first take my <br/>
very light skinned kids out in the summer we stay at the pool for <br/>
about a half hour when they &quot;look&quot; pink then we come in after awhile <br/>
we can stay longer before turning pink and now they are a healthy <br/>
tan (much to my sisters discomfort who puts on sunscreen to go in <br/>
the car since sun comes inthe windows). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350859355">A couple of things:<br/>
<br/>
First off, you might explore what your son doesn&#39;t like about <br/>
sunscreen. I have an allergy to many sunscreens, and it&#39;s also <br/>
really irritating when it gets in my eyes. His anti-sunscreen <br/>
reaction seems pretty strong, and he might have a reason for it <br/>
that you might not be able to see yet. (When my son was 2 or 3, <br/>
he told me he didn&#39;t want to eat peanut butter anymore; I didn&#39;t <br/>
force him to eat it, and it turns out he has a pretty severe allergy <br/>
to it now at 11.) It also might be a strong reaction  to the daily <br/>
hassle/coercion of the application.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I wanted to echo what others have said. My four <br/>
children are all very blonde and light-skinned. They&#39;ve never had <br/>
sunburns (they&#39;ve gotten spots of light pink on occasion) and <br/>
they don&#39;t wear sunscreen every day or every time they go <br/>
outside. (I also live in a much sunnier climate than Denmark.) <br/>
Sometimes I suggest that they should wear sunscreen. Those <br/>
times include days when we&#39;re going to the beach or days when <br/>
they&#39;re going to be in the pool all day. This is probably a few <br/>
times a month, maybe 20 days in the whole year. <br/>
<br/>
There have been a number of times when we&#39;ve been outside all <br/>
day at a park, and I&#39;ve been wearing sunscreen and they have <br/>
not been;  it&#39;s odd when I&#39;m then the one who gets a burn. Unlike <br/>
me, they do get tans, which undoubtedly helps protect them <br/>
some.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, people express surprise that my children have <br/>
tans; my theory is that daily application of sunscreen might not <br/>
be an ultimately healthy idea. It&#39;s not as though it&#39;s unusual for <br/>
health recommendations to swing back and forth. (There was a <br/>
story in Monday&#39;s L.A. Times about how enriching breads and <br/>
cereals with folic acid in order to prevent neural tube defects <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909269524">i am sisse, mortens wife, and i want to say thank you so much for your<br/>
great responses and a lot of food for thought!!<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s funny how, when on this parenting journey of &#39;unlearning what you<br/>
have learnt&#39;, some things are easily discarded while others just blind<br/>
you completely. i mean, it&#39;s easy for me to let him decide whatever he<br/>
wants to eat, wear, do, when to sleep etc. but that sunscreen... i just<br/>
really bought into the whole &quot;you WILL get cancer if you don&#39;t wear<br/>
sunscreen&quot; thing. i can&#39;t believe i never thought to question the use of<br/>
it, rather than just focusing on getting it on him by almost whatever<br/>
means necessary :-(<br/>
<br/>
so i&#39;m really glad to hear from so many of you, who have chosen not to<br/>
use it! and i&#39;m just so sad that i didn&#39;t get to this point myself,<br/>
before having put him through these past few days indoors :-(<br/>
<br/>
sure, he might have some sort of reaction to it (although we have tried<br/>
several brands) and anyway - if he doesn&#39;t want it, he shouldn&#39;t have to<br/>
do it. you&#39;re right, of course, sandra - the whole &quot;we can&#39;t go outside&quot;<br/>
is force - i can&#39;t believe i didn&#39;t see that before. well, i did, of<br/>
course, but i was completely at a loss, torn between what i thought was<br/>
too important to let go and having fun with him :-( i feel so stupid and<br/>
cruel right now.<br/>
<br/>
and you&#39;re right about being inflexible. i don&#39;t know the principles, to<br/>
which you refer, but it is blatantly obvious how inflexibility is the<br/>
exact opposite of what i want. i guess i just needed someone to say<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sandra, i have to say this, too: although everything you said was right,<br/>
your first response made me feel extremely bad. it made me feel like i<br/>
would never dare ask a question in here again for fear of being shamed.<br/>
now, i&#39;m not familiar with the tone, and it might be that this is just<br/>
how you talk, and i&#39;m just too sensitive. it might also be that you get<br/>
tired of hearing from people, who think they are unschooling but are<br/>
mucking it up like this. i know i&#39;m not perfect. i know i do a lot of<br/>
things wrong. we are just trying to find our parenting path. it can be<br/>
so hard, but we know what we want - we just need to learn how to get<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
where we live, homeschooling is completely unheard of. i mean, people<br/>
think we are insane for even staying at home with the children under the<br/>
school age (6 here in denmark)! unschooling is so completely outlandish<br/>
that most people don&#39;t even understand it even after we explain it. we<br/>
know a few families who are choosing a path like ours, but we have<br/>
nothing like the kind of network here that groups like this one can<br/>
provide.<br/>
<br/>
that is why we came here with our question. we knew that we would get<br/>
the kind of answers here, that we needed to get through this and way<br/>
beyond. if i had asked someone here in Denmark, i would probably have<br/>
been told to just &quot;put it on and stop being stupid, so he can go<br/>
outside&quot;. your first response was so strong that it made me feel like i<br/>
had to defend myself - which is silly, because i saw immediately, that<br/>
you were right about everything. i just wish you had said it in a more<br/>
inspiring way, instead of making me feel like i&#39;m a horrible parent. it<br/>
would have been a shame if we had been scared off completely. please<br/>
don&#39;t feel like i&#39;m just saying this because i&#39;m mad at you for scolding<br/>
me - i just think i need inspiration and guidance a lot more than just<br/>
statements of the &quot;you&#39;re doing it all wrong!!&quot; nature. makes sense?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SO! i have already talked to bjørn about maybe wearing a little<br/>
sunscreen to see if he burns at all but he really hates the idea. but<br/>
wearing long sleeves and a hat will do for him, going to the park in the<br/>
morning, going to the beach in the late afternoon and all the other<br/>
great ideas. <br/>
<br/>
and now i have a 1st birthday to celebrate :-) <br/>

&gt; really irritating when it gets in my eyes. His anti-sunscreen <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632180557">I try to use sunscreen as little as possible with my kids for many of <br/>
the reasons listed. However, I did buy a powder sunscreen for my <br/>
daughter when we went on a cruise last year. She was not yet 3 and had <br/>
terrible eczema, bad enough that she wore pants no matter how hot as <br/>
she would scratch herself raw. Any lotion-y sunscreen burned her. I <br/>
found a sunscreen that you apply with a makeup brush that she had no <br/>
trouble with and she and my son thought it was fun to put on their <br/>
faces. It is called &quot;Colorescience Sunforgettable&quot;. You can get it in a <br/>
container with an applicator (but it is very expensive IMO) or you can <br/>
buy the refill sets which hold twice as much, but come without the <br/>
brush (much cheaper). I found them on eBay and the price was reasonable <br/>
for me there. This has been a great solution for our family when we are <br/>
doing something with more intense sunlight than usual and want a bit of <br/>
extra protection.</div>

I&#39;m glad there were other voices that didn&#39;t make you feel bad then.<br/>
<br/>
-=-is so completely outlandish<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s the same where I am, but I can say &quot;It&#39;s like the open classroom  <br/>
theories from the  70&#39;s,&quot; and that helps in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very common for parents to disregard the feelings of their  <br/>
children while magnifying their own feelings.  It&#39;s a normal human  <br/>
thing, greatly supported by cultural traditions.<br/>
<br/>
There was a mom on this list or maybe on UnschoolingDiscussion a few  <br/>
years back who complained bitterly that we had made her cry.   <br/>
Probably that I had made her cry, but others also agreed with me that  <br/>
spanking her children was not the best thing to defend.  She was  <br/>
adamant that spanking her children was okay, but when the problems  <br/>
inherent in her beliefs and practices was pointed out to her, she  <br/>
cried.  We didn&#39;t even spank her and she cried!  But then she was  <br/>
angry with the list for making her cry.<br/>
<br/>
No one on this list made  you stay inside or tried to force the ideas  <br/>
on you.   If my first priority were to make all the readers of the  <br/>
list feel comfortable and feel like good moms, the list wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
as useful and effective as it has been for so  many years.  My first  <br/>
priority is to help those moms see what they can change, today, to  <br/>
make their children&#39;s lives more comfortable so they can start making  <br/>
their children feel more like good children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-your first response made me feel extremely bad-=-<br/>
<br/>
My question has to be whether you felt worse than your son did when  <br/>
he was told he couldn&#39;t go outside and it was his fault.<br/>

You had a rule about sunscreen, but maybe you hadn&#39;t looked at the  <br/>
principle behind the rule.<br/>
<br/>
-=-if i had asked someone here in Denmark, i would probably have<br/>

I could get that answer from any of my neighbors here in the U.S., too.<br/>

that go on purple (or some other color) and rub in that he may find kind of<br/>

have found that we prefer the spray on sunscreens (they&#39;re a little cold at<br/>
first but no yucky hands from putting it on) and they also have sunscreen<br/>
sticks that look like big chapstick tubes.  (Like the old Bonnie Bell ones<br/>

With all the use of sunscren I would expect that skin cancer would be <br/>
LOW and it seems to be higher than a generation ago before they had <br/>
sunscreen. Better screening just does not cut it either.<br/>
<br/>
I think that there is a health myth concerning sunscreen and skin <br/>
cancer. Some people get skin cancer with or without sunscreen. Some <br/>
people smoke their whole lives with NO health problems. some people <br/>
eat &quot;healthy&quot; and die of a heart attack, some people do drugs and never <br/>
have problems, some people die in the tub or in bed. Should we ban bed <br/>
sleeping because some people die in their beds? <br/>
<br/>
There is no PROOF only theories and you have to look at those <br/>
critically. How much sun screen use is in Australia and for how many <br/>
years? Who were they looking at and how did they document how much sun <br/>
they were getting and the kind of sun. How about the kind of sunscreen <br/>
and how would they discover if they would have gotten cancer if they <br/>
did or did not use sunscreen. <br/>

floppy hats, long sleeves and even a little pop-up tent when he was really<br/>
small. When he was three, he went out without &quot;protection&quot; for the first<br/>
time. In just an hour, he began to tan. Even though his winter color may<br/>
match mine, his summer color is closer to that of his dad and sister! Now,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725146917">Well I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t find where I read it, but recently I read you <br/>
should get 20 minutes of sun 3 times a day to get adequate vitamin D <br/>
to help prevent some cancers, diabetes, MS, depression and maybe some <br/>
other stuff.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think being overly tan is the healthiest thing, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think avoiding the sun is healthy either.  It&#39;s like candy and tv and <br/>
everything else; a person might think these are not healthy, but <br/>
neither are control and force. (I&#39;m so thankful to this group for <br/>
helping me understand some things are worse than red dye or <br/>
commercials.) <br/>
I don&#39;t use sunscreen so when we overdo in the sun I put on coconut <br/>
oil.  If I&#39;m really burnt I do it often.  Another article I can&#39;t <br/>
find right now was actually a study about healing wounds in AIDS <br/>
patients, where they found that coconut oil worked best. I use it a <br/>
lot, I really reccommend reading about it.  My dd hates to have <br/>
anything put on her so if I&#39;m really worried I put it on her when <br/>
she&#39;s sleeping.  <br/>

I NEVER knew about this until I was diagnosed with it several months <br/>
ago. There is an incurable disease called Lupus which is activated <br/>
and triggered by ANY kind of sun exposure -- in the winter, on a <br/>
cloudy day, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I have to wear special-order, expensive sunblock at all times, no <br/>
matter what the weather is like or whether or not I&#39;m in the shade. <br/>
<br/>
Regular sunscreen that you can get at the drugstore is not <br/>
sufficient. Not taking this precaution regularly can actually cause <br/>
damage to my internal organs (some of which I&#39;ve already experienced.)<br/>
<br/>
Thirty years Lupus was a death sentence. If this were the sixties, it <br/>
would be very unlikely that I would live to even see any of my kids <br/>
become teenagers. <br/>
<br/>
Sooo ... this morning, when I was smearing this yucky, white, <br/>
expensive goop all over me just so I could take the trash out to the <br/>
curb, I was thinking, &quot;This is a pain, but I am SOO glad it exists, <br/>
because otherwise I would either a)almost NEVER be able to go <br/>
outside; and/or b)be very very ill.<br/>
<br/>
So I am very grateful that these products exist!<br/>
<br/>
I realize this is not the original point of this thread, and probably <br/>
nobody else here (or their kids) have Lupus, but I thought someone <br/>
might be interested in hearing this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is amazing. So lupus is triggered by sun exposure- like you do not <br/>
process it correctly or something? I do not know what lupus is so I <br/>
guess I will look it up and find out. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
 My comment did lack the point that lots of people have died as a <br/>
result of not having the medical knowledge we have now and while I <br/>
understand that there are some &quot;medical&quot; things that are theory and not <br/>
proof and things we need to critically look at<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had no idea what Lupus was til I was told I had it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an autoimmune disease that mostly strikes females. Nobody knows <br/>
what causes it and there&#39;s no cure. Interestingly, it&#39;s possibly <br/>
triggered by stress, and I started having symptoms about a month <br/>
after my daughter spent three weeks in the ICU (for another <br/>
autoimmune disease.)<br/>
<br/>
What happens is that for some reason the body gets confused, and <br/>
instead of (or really, in addition to) killing things like germs and <br/>
foreign objects, like a healthy body would, it thinks that things <br/>
like your kidneys, lungs, joints, skin, etc, are foreign objects that <br/>
need to be destroyed. <br/>
<br/>
[My daughter, who is now perfectly cured, had autoimmune hemolytic <br/>
anemia, which meant her body was literally destroying all her red <br/>
blood cells. Every four hours or so she would get another <br/>
transfusion, only to have it gone again within a few hours.]<br/>
<br/>
The slightest UVA or UVA rays makes those antibodies flare up -- and <br/>
yes, that includes rainy days or even fluorescent lights!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is interested in discussing any of this more is free to e-<br/>
mail me. I imagine this is probably something I should take off the <br/>
list at this point.<br/>

Thank you.  Your post was much more coherant than mine.  I had read <br/>
some of those studies but was too tired to find any references to <br/>
include.  It is important that it&#39;s organic virgin cocnut oil.  I <br/>
gave my aunt a little jar of it after knee surgery and her scar <br/>
healed beautifully.  We put it in smoothies and I use it like <br/>
lotion.  I feel it&#39;s worth the expense.  <br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446555190">Just wanted to throw this out there... if you follow a diet based on <br/>
your blood type, you may want to check to see if coconut oil is <br/>
beneficial or harmful for you (it&#39;s not good for type B) before you <br/>
go slathering yourself in it. For some people, ingesting it (whether <br/>
orally or through your skin) can do you more harm than good.<br/>
