<div id="ygrps-yiv-378354897">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been able to keep up the posts recently and just have been<br/>
skimming for the past week.  This morning I was thinking how grateful I am<br/>
that I was given the opportunity to create the life I want, which includes<br/>
having kids that are self directed learners.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This morning the kids made a massive bed out of putting the couches and the<br/>
all the cushions together while they watched Toy Story 2.  DH, the kids and<br/>
I then went to Krispie Cream to watch them make donuts and eat them.  Mum<br/>
met us there and the kids enjoyed that too.  DH and the Max are now washing<br/>
the car (it&#39;s going to be 90 degrees today) while Zak is making a river<br/>
outside putting rocks and sticks from the back door through the garage and<br/>
onto the sidewalk.  DH is leaving for his men&#39;s group at 1:30pm when I&#39;ll<br/>
take over.  The kids and I are going to a pottery class for a couple of<br/>
hours this afternoon and then home for dinner.  Zak talked to his friend<br/>
Auden on the phone this morning and read him a book about how germs make you<br/>
sick and how you can help prevent them in the future (Auden&#39;s brothers are<br/>
sick).  Zak also made a card for each of Auden&#39;s brothers and we stopped at<br/>
the post office on the way to Krispie Cream to mail them to them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m grateful..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Grateful that Steve got fired for the 2nd time 6 weeks ago and can now be<br/>
home with the kids<br/>
<br/>
Grateful that I have a home business that can support our family financially<br/>
so we can have days like today.<br/>
<br/>
Grateful that I have support for having self directed learning kids<br/>
<br/>
Grateful that my kids are healthy, happy and love to investigate the world<br/>
<br/>
Grateful that each day begins and ends with a sense of freedom and peace<br/>
that I didn&#39;t have when we were rushing around &quot;trying&quot; to fit in with The<br/>
Jones&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Grateful for the knowledge, experience and wisdom I read on this list.<br/>
<br/>
