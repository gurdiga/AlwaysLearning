<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261082571">My sister said the same thing to me only she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
let me take her kids because she didn&#39;t want them<br/>
homeschooled.  Instead she is leaving them to her<br/>
husband&#39;s cousin in Oregon who the kids don&#39;t know and<br/>
doesn&#39;t have nay children.  I have four and live near<br/>
them and they know me.  Go figure.  I told her isn&#39;t<br/>
it more important that they are loved.  Although I<br/>
have to say if she took my children, I would not want<br/>
them to go to school, but at least I know they would<br/>
be with people that loved them.<br/>
