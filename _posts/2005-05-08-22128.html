<div id="ygrps-yiv-37760865">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group - I feel very strongly that I would like to <br/>
incorporate Holt&#39;s views on learning into my own upbringing of my DS <br/>
(6 mos).  However, I have only found very brief paragraphs of his <br/>
that relate specifically to infants.  My husband (who read &#39;How <br/>
Children Learn&#39;) and I are having a hard time figuring out how best <br/>
to apply Holt&#39;s theories to our infant.  Since a 6 month old has <br/>
such a limited understanding of the world, I am torn between showing <br/>
him how to do things and letting him figure everything out for <br/>
himself (I&#39;m afraid that at this age children might need more <br/>
guidance than at the toddler age, but I really don&#39;t know).  For <br/>
instance, I recently taught him how to turn the light switch on and <br/>
off - I tried letting him just play with the switch as would seem to <br/>
be the best way per Holt, but he didn&#39;t have any interest until I <br/>
showed him how it works.  Does anyone know of any <br/>
writers/researchers/websites with views similar to Holt&#39;s but with a <br/>
bent towards infants?<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Does any six month old *need* to know how to turn on light? Isn&#39;t that <br/>
what mom is for?<br/>
<br/>
It has *so* much to do with &quot;when he&#39;s ready&quot;----like, *everything* to <br/>
do with it!<br/>
<br/>
He may find that knowing how to turn it on is pretty cool, but he can&#39;t <br/>
even *reach* it! What purpose would that serve him?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236091615">You are very right Kathy!  I have read Continuum Concept and a few <br/>
other AP books.  I&#39;m not sure why I taught him the light switch.  We <br/>
do EC, so we are in and out of the bathroom a million times a day, <br/>
so it seemed to fit...<br/>
<br/>
I actually had a great John Holt experience yesterday, since I put <br/>
up the post.  I bought crayons for my son (based on a story from a <br/>
GWS article that was mentioned in &#39;How Children Learn&#39;) about a <br/>
month ago and have given them to him to play with about once a week <br/>
to see if he was &quot;ready&quot;.  Each time, he would just put the crayons <br/>
in his mouth.  Then, yesterday, I realized that the only thing that <br/>
worried me about this was the paper around the crayons, so I took <br/>
off the paper and gave him the wax crayons and sat him in my lap <br/>
with a big pad of paper and then just watched.  Initially, he was <br/>
interested only in sucking on the crayons.  But as his arms moved <br/>
around with the crayons in his hands, he noticed that he was making <br/>
marks on the paper.  Then he started focusing on his drawing instead <br/>
of sucking and even worked on adjusting the crayon in his hand to <br/>
make it easier to draw!  Even though there was mention of a 6 month <br/>
old using crayons in &#39;How Children Learn&#39;, I never expected it to be <br/>
such a fascinating, mind-opening and successful experience!  <br/>
<br/>
I agree that you don&#39;t have to show babies anything artificially - I <br/>
find though that I&#39;ve been programmed to think that I&#39;m being a <br/>
better mother by teaching because I&#39;m doing something rather than <br/>
just watching.  I&#39;m working on it!  Thanks for your thoughts.<br/>

=======================<br/>
 <br/>
If you distill what you read into the principles behind the suggestions,  you <br/>
don&#39;t need specifics.<br/>
 <br/>
Here are some ideas about living by principle rather than by rules, and  <br/>
though it might seem this is changing the topic, it&#39;s probably exactly what  <br/>
you&#39;re wanting (without knowing it):<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989558094">-=-Since a 6 month old has <br/>
such a limited understanding of the world,  I am torn between showing <br/>
him how to do things and letting him figure  everything out for <br/>
himself -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=============================<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m behind on e-mail, but we have fun unschooling  houseguests.<br/>
 <br/>
I kept coming back to this one, though.<br/>
 <br/>
Probably someone has suggested attachment parenting sites. <br/>
 <br/>
There are lots of things between &quot;showing him how to do things&quot; and  &quot;letting <br/>
him figure everything out for himself.&quot;  Some things (let&#39;s take  the big <br/>
things looming in his future) you can&#39;t &quot;show him how to do--sitting up  and <br/>
walking.  He HAS to figure those out for himself.<br/>
 <br/>
So you let him figure them out for himself?  Not totally.   Probably you&#39;ll <br/>
help him by propping things behind him when he&#39;s first learning  to sit up, or <br/>
clearing a space for him or making things easily available for him  to play <br/>
with when he can first sit up but can&#39;t crawl yet.  And walking  needs things to <br/>
pull up on, and encouragment, and maybe he&#39;d like to hold your  finger and <br/>
pull up or walk from the couch two or three steps to your  hands.  That&#39;s not <br/>
showing him how, it&#39;s helping him when HE wants to do  it.<br/>
 <br/>
If you show him that a toy comes apart, that&#39;s like pee-a-boo.  He  might be <br/>
months from doing it himself, but he&#39;ll probably have fun watching you  pull <br/>
something out and put it back in.  <br/>
 <br/>
It won&#39;t ruin his discovery for you to show him how things work, or to talk  <br/>
while you&#39;re doing things so he&#39;ll start to see how they go, like talking <br/>
about  buckling the carseat, that there are two buckles; or saying you&#39;re screwing <br/>
the  lid on a cup so it won&#39;t spill.  That&#39;s conversation, and will help him  <br/>
understand how and why, and to pick up terminology.  Just carry him around,  <br/>
talk to him, and give him the opportunity to see, touch, taste, smell and hear <br/>
 lots and lots of things.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- For <br/>
instance, I recently taught him how to turn the light switch on  and <br/>
off - I tried letting him just play with the switch as would seem to  <br/>
be the best way per Holt, but he didn&#39;t have any interest until I <br/>
showed  him how it works. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
The most you could have done is to turn the light on and off and point at  it <br/>
and talk about the switch, and maybe help him turn it on and off and say  <br/>
&quot;Cool!&quot; or whatever.  You don&#39;t know that you &quot;taught&quot; him, but if he can  do it <br/>
himself now, you do know that he LEARNED.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s a life-changing distinction, when you really know deep down the  <br/>
difference between teaching him and him learning things.<br/>

-=-<br/>
When my teens were babies, my favorite authors were<br/>
William Sears, Penelope Leach and Polly Berrien Berends (Whole Child,  Whole <br/>
Parent) <br/>
and they all had ideas that made me feel more confident and helped clarify  <br/>
my thinking.<br/>
I especially recommend that third one,  <br/>

Talking to my babies and showing them things was natural for me.  It was<br/>
what my own mother did and still does with her grandbabies.  But it amazes<br/>
me upon talking with folks sometimes that not everyone does these things.<br/>
I&#39;ve only observed a small group of mother&#39;s parenting from birth on up but<br/>
it does seem to me that the more time spent in mother&#39;s arms, being talked<br/>
to and shown things, the greater understanding small children have of their<br/>
world and the greater their ability to be understood, whether or not they<br/>
are talking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016854295">Wow, Sandra, this is PERFECT!  Thanks so much for taking the time to <br/>
respond so thoroughly.  I think you hit the nail on the head.  I <br/>
think this will give me the peace of mind I craved.  I&#39;m the type <br/>
who wants to be &quot;right&quot; about everything, who lived for As all <br/>
through formal schooling.  I first fell into AP when my son was born <br/>
because I couldn&#39;t bear his cries when I put him in the co-sleeper I <br/>
had, so this introduced me to the idea of sleeping with baby and Dr. <br/>
Sears which led me to AP and Continuum Concept which got me to John <br/>
Holt.  I believe strongly in AP and John Holt, but I find myself <br/>
worrying that I am doing something &quot;wrong.&quot;  I like what you wrote <br/>
about principles vs. rules as well.  I guess I need to realize that <br/>
these ideas are not rules but rather principles and I will find my <br/>
way...<br/>
<br/>
Warmest regards,<br/>
Emily <br/>

&gt; such a limited understanding of the world,  I am torn between <br/>
showing <br/>
&gt; him how to do things and letting him figure  everything out for <br/>
&gt; himself -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; =============================<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m behind on e-mail, but we have fun unschooling  <br/>
houseguests.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I kept coming back to this one, though.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Probably someone has suggested attachment parenting sites. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There are lots of things between &quot;showing him how to do things&quot; <br/>
and  &quot;letting <br/>
&gt; him figure everything out for himself.&quot;  Some things (let&#39;s take  <br/>
the big <br/>
&gt; things looming in his future) you can&#39;t &quot;show him how to do--<br/>
sitting up  and <br/>
&gt; walking.  He HAS to figure those out for himself.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So you let him figure them out for himself?  Not totally.   <br/>
Probably you&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; help him by propping things behind him when he&#39;s first learning  <br/>
to sit up, or <br/>
&gt; clearing a space for him or making things easily available for <br/>
him  to play <br/>
&gt; with when he can first sit up but can&#39;t crawl yet.  And walking  <br/>
needs things to <br/>
&gt; pull up on, and encouragment, and maybe he&#39;d like to hold your  <br/>
finger and <br/>
&gt; pull up or walk from the couch two or three steps to your  hands.  <br/>
That&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; showing him how, it&#39;s helping him when HE wants to do  it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If you show him that a toy comes apart, that&#39;s like pee-a-boo.  <br/>
He  might be <br/>
&gt; months from doing it himself, but he&#39;ll probably have fun watching <br/>
you  pull <br/>
&gt; something out and put it back in.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It won&#39;t ruin his discovery for you to show him how things work, <br/>
or to talk  <br/>
&gt; while you&#39;re doing things so he&#39;ll start to see how they go, like <br/>
talking <br/>
&gt; about  buckling the carseat, that there are two buckles; or saying <br/>
you&#39;re screwing <br/>
&gt; the  lid on a cup so it won&#39;t spill.  That&#39;s conversation, and <br/>
will help him  <br/>
&gt; understand how and why, and to pick up terminology.  Just carry <br/>
him around,  <br/>
&gt; talk to him, and give him the opportunity to see, touch, taste, <br/>
smell and hear <br/>
&gt;  lots and lots of things.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=- For <br/>
&gt; instance, I recently taught him how to turn the light switch on  <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; off - I tried letting him just play with the switch as would seem <br/>
to  <br/>
&gt; be the best way per Holt, but he didn&#39;t have any interest until I <br/>
&gt; showed  him how it works. -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The most you could have done is to turn the light on and off and <br/>
point at  it <br/>
&gt; and talk about the switch, and maybe help him turn it on and off <br/>
and say  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Cool!&quot; or whatever.  You don&#39;t know that you &quot;taught&quot; him, but if <br/>
he can  do it <br/>
&gt; himself now, you do know that he LEARNED.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s a life-changing distinction, when you really know deep down <br/>
the  <br/>
&gt; difference between teaching him and him learning things.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=- Does anyone know of any <br/>
&gt; writers/researchers/websites with views  similar to Holt&#39;s but <br/>
with a <br/>
&gt; bent towards infants?<br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt; When my teens were babies, my favorite authors were<br/>
&gt; William Sears, Penelope Leach and Polly Berrien Berends (Whole <br/>
Child,  Whole <br/>
&gt; Parent) <br/>
&gt; and they all had ideas that made me feel more confident and helped <br/>
clarify  <br/>
&gt; my thinking.<br/>
&gt; I especially recommend that third one,  <br/>

him and I sing little made up songs like &quot;Yoavi loves to look up - <br/>

If you have some ulterior motive then you may be *teaching* but if you are just going about life and talking along the way then that is a different story.<br/>

True learning- learning that is permanent and useful, that leads to intelligent action<br/>
and further learning- can arise only out of the experience, interests and concerns of the learner.<br/>
