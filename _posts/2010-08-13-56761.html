<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076505511">Two people have written to ask if the list is down, because it&#39;s been  <br/>
quiet for a couple of days, so this is partly as a test message, but...<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a chat (Friday the 13th of August 2010) about whether  <br/>
unschooling works.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular">http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular</a>  (if you don&#39;t know the Friday  <br/>
time in your time zone)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/room">http://sandradodd.com/room</a> (if you do know the time)<br/>
<br/>
Because most of the people who read this will read it after the chat  <br/>
is over, it might be a good thing to discuss here, too.<br/>
It&#39;s one of those &quot;just semantics&quot; things, in a way.  But most of  <br/>
those discussions of which words work and which ones don&#39;t do cut  <br/>
straight to the central matter of how, what and why.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the note that went to the chat announcement list, but  <br/>
discussion here is just as good or better!<br/>
<br/>
What does it mean &quot;work&quot;? What are people looking for when they look<br/>
for unschooling success?<br/>

<br/>
The first one is old, but was put online yesterday.<br/>
The second one consists of things I didn&#39;t know the first twelve years<br/>
I unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about it because of some discussion on Facebook of<br/>
this blog post by Jeff Sabo:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the term &quot;working&quot; that can be a problem. Maybe there<br/>
isn&#39;t a problem. I thought it might be a good thing to discuss.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76142208">I think for me the response to the question &#39;is unschooling working&#39; is primarily an emotional one.  Maybe it&#39;s because my kids are young (5 & 3), but in my case I can FEEL that unschooling is working when the kids are busy cooking up their latest potion, popping dolls in a carriage to go to the ball, zooming up and down the hallway on the scooter, choosing books for me to read while we snuggle on the couch; in short when the atmosphere in our home is peaceful. Even when there is conflict, it is resolved promptly, and in a peaceful way.<br/>
<br/>
I can also instantly feel when things are NOT working, and it is in no way the fault of unschooling, but because I have hit a roadblock in my emotional response to the situation at hand. Case in point, recently the kids chose 2 Barbie movies from the video shop and wanted to watch them repeatedly. Now I completely understand about watching the same film over and over, and then moving on. This has been the pattern in our house for a long time. But, I had an overlay of discomfort about these particular movies because of half-formed thoughts swirling in my brain about female body image, shallowness and cringe-worthy plotting. A little negative, you could say.<br/>
<br/>
But the worst is that I did not overcome my negativity to try to see what the kids enjoyed about these films, I resisted putting them on for the kids, and it led to tears on their part and a real internal squirming on my part. Not just intellectually, but in my heart I could FEEL that what I was doing was wrong. Not &#39;wrong&#39; in a schoolish sense but wrong by my children. I was not putting our relationship first. I was taking away choices. Next time they choose a Barbie movie, I am going to leave that negativity behind.<br/>
<br/>
For me, unschooling has brought and continues to bring so many tangible benefits that I KNOW it works. But it takes a lot to make it work. It takes a significant effort on the part of the unschooling parent to deal with their own emotional responses in a way that does  not damage their kids. It&#39;s an ongoing project. But the rewards are a relationship of love and trust with your kids that is beyond price, and kids who have an internal strength and sense of compassion that is truly powerful.<br/>

Next time they do sit and watcht with them. Have an open mind while doing so.<br/>
Barbie movies are pretty great and if you have never really watched one fully I <br/>
recomend you do.<br/>
Barbie is a great friend and is a strong and empowered girl. <br/>
Don&#39;t let her good looks blind you to her character and strengh.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s the crux of the situation:  It doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;  <br/>
automatically.  Someone has to make it work.  Someone (eventually more  <br/>
than one, but usually at first one person) has to create and protect  <br/>
the environment and situation so that it can work.<br/>

I haven&#39;t watched one fully, but I would pop in for the songs!  Holly  <br/>
was already older when those movies started being made, but the music  <br/>
is really good.<br/>

<br/>
I have been really looking hard at my attitudes lately with my middle dd Sydney 14 because she has been going through some tough moments personally and also some triumphant ones this year but our relationship is shifting a bit and I wanted to make sure I am doing what I can to keep it supportive and open.  When I read Claire&#39;s post from yesterday I realized I&#39;d been negative about the last two things we watched together and perhaps more since I wasn&#39;t looking for it before.  The first was &quot;Dexter&quot; which she started watching the other day from season 1 and it made me so sick my stomach was upset the rest of the day.  But I get why she likes it and she&#39;s always been drawn to crime shows, medical mysteries and forensics, loves Bones and CSI and House which I have enjoyed with her.  The other was a  little made for TV Disney film called Smart House that she was enjoying but which I criticized as silly and tedious.  I wish I hadn&#39;t said anything negative because it spoiled the feeling in the room which could have been warm and light but instead was crowded with my complaints about the writing and acting.  Next time I&#39;ll be more aware.<br/>
