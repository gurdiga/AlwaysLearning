<div id="ygrps-yiv-724810814">I live in Iowa and have been stuck indoors for a while now.  Today it <br/>
is actually a little warmer and a whopping 34 degrees for a high, but <br/>
along witht that we will have rain/freezing rain.  I have tendency to <br/>
become depressed and need the *great outdoors* and sunshine.  Every <br/>
year I wonder why I live in Iowa and then comes spring and I am soooo <br/>
thrilled with the changes that I think I wouldn&#39;t want to live <br/>
anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Any tips on how to get a 20 month old to wear mittens?  <br/>
<br/>
I could use some *activities* related to winter, any ideas?  I have <br/>
just recently brought the snow indoors and had my husband fetch me a <br/>
big bowl of snow.  The kids and I played with it on our kitchen <br/>
floor.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501225532">No tips, but I can commiserate with ya!  I can&#39;t stand winter.  I get thru the holidays okay, but come about Jan 3rd, I&#39;m absolutely cranky and damn near impossible to live with.  I realized some years ago that I have SADD -- really, if I can&#39;t feel the sun&#39;s warmth on my skin, I get just monstrously restless and depressed.  Seeing the sun is some help, but really I need to be outside and feeling it.<br/>
 <br/>
Thankfully, we live in New Mexico where we get more sun than when we lived in No Va (man was winter there depressing!) still tho it&#39;s not really enough for me.  Ideally, I&#39;d live somewhere that it&#39;s always between 70 and 80, with very little humidity and cooler nights.  I just haven&#39;t found that idyllic paradise yet.  <br/>
 <br/>
Generally, by Feb 1, all I can do is mark off the days until March 1, when at least in my head, I can finally see winter coming to an end.<br/>

  You might want to try some SAD lights.  You can get them from various sources, but there are a few on sale here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sadlight.com/2004-sale.htm">http://www.sadlight.com/2004-sale.htm</a><br/>
  *<br/>
<br/>
  *<br/>
  As for winter activities, you might want to try some Snow Cream.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s one recipe for SnowCream and there are many more on the net:<br/>
  INGREDIENTS:<br/>
<br/>
    a.. 1-3 C. snow (make sure it&#39;s clean!) <br/>
    b.. 1/2 C. whipping cream or other cream of choice <br/>
    c.. 1 T. sugar <br/>
    d.. 2-3 drops vanilla flavoring<br/>
  PREPARATION:<br/>
<br/>
  In a separate bowl, mix cream, sugar and vanilla. Slowly add snow to desired consistency. Eat (slowly--it&#39;s cold) and enjoy! <br/>
  All ingredients can be adjusted to suit your particular preferences. <br/>
<br/>
  You might want to try some other flavorings: cinnamon, butterscotch, almond, or eggnog mix. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777689965">Hello from a neighbor down in Missouri - I&#39;m jealous! All we have is <br/>
mud mud and more mud! We would love some snow my son found a <br/>
snowboard at a garage sale this summer and he&#39;s ready to try it out! <br/>
Currently he&#39;s researching &quot;accelerators&quot; from hot wheels, we <br/>
recorded the movie when it was on CN last week as he really liked <br/>
the first movie and we found a car at wal-mart that has cards with <br/>
it so now he wants to know how they work. He&#39;s been a really indoor <br/>
person so far this year and I&#39;m respecting that, I remember when he <br/>
was 3-4 he would spend hours playing in the mud but apparently he <br/>
has moved on for now. Have fun the time time! Moza</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435811458">Well yes, but for a different reason...its too warm.<br/>
 I can&#39;t commiserate with ya since its 70 freaking degrees. I love <br/>
winter and hate when we get this warm stuff which means:<br/>
A. I can&#39;t wear my winter clothes...that does annoy me<br/>
B. When the cold front does come though we will have tonadoes...I prefer <br/>
to have at least 3 months out of the year that rain does not mean I need <br/>
to check for storm warnings.<br/>

  That&#39;s funny! I live in Australia and I survive February by reminding myself that it&#39;s only 28 days till I can start thinking there will be an end to the heat.<br/>

We get that in July.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m another one who can&#39;t stand the gray skies.  In Arkansas in  January, <br/>
even if it&#39;s 65 degrees, like it was yesterday, the skies are still  gray.  All <br/>
last weekend they promised sunshine but instead we got wicked  fog and of <br/>
course, more gray skies.  I don&#39;t know how those weathermen can  look at themselves <br/>
in the mirror.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969831998">My kids&#39; favorite winter activities seem to be video games and cooking.  <br/>
<br/>
When it is nice enough, some of them like to go iceskating downtown<br/>
too...but it is expensive, and we don&#39;t always have enough money.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I use to do to get through the long winters when my<br/>
kids were younger was to spend time at the mall.  Not shopping, but<br/>
people watching.  Sometimes we would get lunch or I&#39;d let them each<br/>
pick a book from the bookstore, and we&#39;d stop at each store with a<br/>
*kid friendly* display.  (Toy trains to play with and such.)  I also<br/>
got exercise.  I&#39;d also make regular errands take longer and try to<br/>
make them more interesting.  We&#39;d really look at things and talk about<br/>
them at the grocery store; I&#39;d read lots of books to them while we<br/>
were at the library, etc.  It gave me a change of scenery, and them<br/>
something different to do.</div>
