Stop along the way if something seems interesting. Take the back <br/>
roads, and stay off the freeway. You will find interesting houses, <br/>
yards, parks, views, and you can listen to music longer, or books on <br/>
tape/cd or play car games, or plain old talk. You can get lost a <br/>
little and try to find your way back to somewhere familiar and ask your <br/>
kids for help with which direction to turn.&quot;<br/>

  Ahhh! (Light bulb goes on!) I never think of those things that are so obvious sometimes! My son is in that &quot;I hate going to the store&quot; mode and I hadn&#39;t even thought to drive to the next town to do it.....duh!<br/>
  Thanks for expanding my world a bit! LOL<br/>
