I&#39;m here reading, mostly. I&#39;m trying hard to get more balance in my life. <br/>
Email had been getting quite compulsive for me. I&#39;m getting more things <br/>
done that I want to do by putting some lists on nomail and being more <br/>
selective about what I reply to on the lists I&#39;m still getting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715735085">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I decided I needed to get out and do something new.  I like to dance so I <br/>
signed up for a salsa class.  We rotate partners often in the class.  In the <br/>
first class there was one man who said to me, when I asked how he was doing that <br/>
his ego was suffering, since he couldn&#39;t seem to learn the basic step we were <br/>
working on.  I noticed after the lesson that his wife was trying to help him <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
On Friday we had our second lesson.  I wasn&#39;t surprised to notice they <br/>
weren&#39;t at class.  I think it is sad to think that often if there is something we <br/>
can&#39;t do well, we don&#39;t want to do it.  I&#39;ve noticed with the contra dancing I <br/>
do there are beginners that seem to &quot;get&quot; it right away.  I think of them as <br/>
&quot;body&quot; learners.  And then there are those that learn thro their heads, and they <br/>
count and analyze the dances and the music.  If these people hang in there, <br/>
they too become good dancers, it just takes longer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a poor skiier, a slow jogger and hiker, and a good dancer, but I love it <br/>
all.  I think I read it in Wayne Dwyer&#39;s book - that if you don&#39;t have to be <br/>
&quot;good&quot; there you can do a lot of things.  <br/>
<br/>
But, I also believe that if you try something, and don&#39;t like doing it, you <br/>
have learned that, and don&#39;t need to &quot;stick in there&quot;, it is OK to move on to <br/>
something you do find interesting.<br/>
