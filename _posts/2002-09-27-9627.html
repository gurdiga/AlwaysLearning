&gt; parents, but I knew other kids whose parents were pretty worthless to them <br/>
&gt; religiously speaking.  So if you count on the family beng the experience <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; every kid, some will lose out.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

Saturday morning (Youth Group is different).  However, even among UU&#39;s, kids <br/>
often diverge spiritually from their parents as they grow. UU&#39;s tend to be <br/>
more okay about that, I think.<br/>
<br/>
In writing this, I wanted to be clear to other Religious Educators that <br/>
however good their programs might be, we were NOT the primary religious <br/>
educators of the kids. From an early age, kids ask their parents (or someone <br/>
else -- I suppose many kids learn about spirituality &quot;on the streets&quot;) <br/>
questions like &quot;What happens when you die? Is there a God, &quot; etc. (There&#39;s a <br/>
cool UU Adult RE curriculum called &quot;Parents as Resident Theologians.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I see what we do in Sunday school as providing community, and giving <br/>
resources and ideas for exploration...it&#39;s up to the kids to figure out what <br/>
their next steps are, and we&#39;re always there to help.<br/>
<br/>
No, they won&#39;t fire me, because the congregation I serve is REALLY into this <br/>
stuff. When I first started with this church, I told the board that if it <br/>
came down to it, I&#39;d advocate for what the kids want. They LOVED it!<br/>
<br/>
Joyce asked me if we unschool RE at my church, and truthfully, we don&#39;t. With <br/>
volunteer teachers and expectations from both the parents and the kids, I <br/>
haven&#39;t figured out how to pull that off. However, I&#39;ve tried really hard to <br/>
at least respect what the kids want. I asked last Spring what they wanted to <br/>
learn this year, and lots said--Science. So my partner and I are writing a <br/>
curriculum (with lots of choices in it) about Science and Religion.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback.<br/>
