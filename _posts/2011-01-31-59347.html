<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783090123">Hello all,<br/>
 <br/>
My 3 1/2 year old daughter discovered the joy of buying toys in a big way this Christmas. We are on a tight budget due to recently buying a fixer house, me needing some dental work very soon, and saving for an upcoming family vacation that is important to all of us. We&#39;ve been living pretty frugally for quite a while. <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I figured out what we can give as an allowance right now. It&#39;s not much, but I&#39;ve taken every chance I can to help K stretch it by going to garage sales and thrift stores. When she is close I chip in an extra dollar or 2. We tried the dollar store and feel like the stuff there is so frustrating in how quickly it falls apart that we don&#39;t want to do it anymore. I&#39;ve looked on Freecycle for the kinds of things she wants too. It has been 4 weeks and I am really appreciating all the joy and natural learning that is coming out of this. I *would* like to minimize the frustration, while still holding close to our budget. We were thinking of giving her a much larger amount one week a month so that she can buy a larger item once in a while. There are a few things she likes that she would have to save for 6 weeks or more to get and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair to ask her to do if I can find a less frustrating way. I&#39;d rather not give her a little more each week instead also because then she buys a small set of something and then still really wants the deluxe set which has the same items plus more. <br/>
<br/>
So, I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing, but I wanted to know if any of you have done something else that worked well for you. I know this is a great group to talk to about buying toys! I&#39;d love any suggestions that are respectful of the reality of our budget.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62759393">Our family is very low income, paycheck to paycheck and constantly juggling<br/>
bills.<br/>
<br/>
When we were both working we came up with the idea of giving him a<br/>
percentage of our income.  We worked jobs where we got paid per hour, so our<br/>
income fluctuated constantly.  I believe we did 1% at that time.  The idea<br/>
behind it was, the more we worked the more Draven had to be independent.<br/>
 This was a great system for us because if I worked a ton (some weeks I<br/>
worked 75+ hours), a week later he would get a decent amount of money, but<br/>
if my hours were cut, there was no disappointment when I couldn&#39;t give him<br/>
as much.  He was older so he also understood when a bill was due and we had<br/>
to take every spare cent to pay that bill . . . we&#39;d write the amount owed<br/>
to him on the calendar and the following week he would get both weeks worth.<br/>
<br/>
Since then my partner and I have both lost our full time jobs and have been<br/>
living off of two very small part time jobs.  We&#39;ve had to move back into my<br/>
parents house to help out with a medical emergency.  There is NO spare money<br/>
for anything.  We had a yard sale and Draven got a percentage for helping<br/>
out, as well as keeping the income from his toys/clothes that sold.  Perhaps<br/>
your daughter is growing out of some clothes/toys and you can offer to list<br/>
them on craigslist or ebay.  Draven also tends to (quite often) trade in<br/>
games for money towards other used games.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also tax time, and when we get our taxes back he&#39;ll get a percentage of<br/>
that, plus we have a list of things we&#39;ve promised him we&#39;ll buy for him.<br/>
 There was some disappointment this week because I expected my taxes this<br/>
past Friday, or today at the latest, but the IRS is backed up and we&#39;ve been<br/>
told it&#39;ll be another week.<br/>
<br/>
He has before, decided to use layaway (back then it was free at walmart, but<br/>
now it&#39;s still available at kmart for a fee), so he didn&#39;t spend money on<br/>
something smaller when he was trying to save for something big.<br/>
<br/>
At Christmas I&#39;ve encouraged family to give him cash or gift cards (the<br/>
prepaid visa type gift cards are the best) and he spreads that money out as<br/>
much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Another big thing for us has been keeping him involved in the family budget.<br/>
 He has a pretty good idea of what all of our bills are each month, and at<br/>
this point has figured out when in the month they&#39;re due.  We played a game<br/>
of sorts as a family that involved cutting our electricity usage as much as<br/>
possible to see how low we could get our electric bills.  Once he realized<br/>
that keeping the house a little chillier in the winter, and a little warmer<br/>
in the summer, meant more money for all of us to spend, he was all for<br/>
bundling up or wearing minimal clothing to stay comfortable.  We did a<br/>
similar thing with water bills.<br/>
<br/>
He also sees us constantly price checking items on our wish list.  When<br/>
we&#39;re price checking and looking at things used he likes to chart the prices<br/>
we find and will recommend new websites to look stuff up on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found it useful to mention to other friends and family members the<br/>
things on our wishlist.  Recently I talked to my older sister about us<br/>
wanting some sort of book reader that will also play games for road trips<br/>
and stuff.  Turns out she had an older version of the Ipod touch sitting<br/>
around unused.  She&#39;s sending it to us for free.  I&#39;ve gotten bags of play<br/>
clothes and other misc. toys over the years just by mentioning to someone<br/>
that we&#39;re looking for a good price on that particular thing.<br/>
<br/>
This has gotten WAY too long, but I hope it helps.<br/>
<br/>

I hadn&#39;t seen that particular variation before - at least not in a deliberate sort of way. It could be a good solution for a young child who isn&#39;t really up for saving money, yet, to be able to get little things regularly and big things, sometimes. We&#39;ve done something similar with &quot;extra&quot; income - George is self-employed, part time, so we have regular income and &quot;extras&quot; and use those windfalls for larger ticket purchases. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195475685">What has worked best for our 4 year old is not taking him to the store as often. For quite a while, the kids were going with me every time we did errands. He wanted an expensive Lego set ($50+) every week, not the $5 toys his sisters wanted/liked. I started doing errands alone on the weekends and can now give them all a larger amount of pocket money when they do shop with me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556284075">Hi!<br/>
We have gone through periods when kids want to buy all kinds of things - and I think it&#39;s very fun and interesting for them to have that kind of control over what they get. We are always tight on $ around here, so we&#39;ve done a couple of things. First, we don&#39;t go out much. I try very hard to reign our own spending in by not going out to stores so much. I&#39;ve also helped the kids curb impulse shopping by giving them bank accounts at the &quot;Hogan&quot; bank. They have accounts on the computer that helps them keep track of their money. We really don&#39;t do allowances - mostly because we all forget about them and then are so far behind I&#39;d have to take out a loan to catch up. Instead, the kids do extra jobs and earn money for them, sell stuff they don&#39;t want anymore and help us sell veggies and other items at the farmers&#39; market. Any money they make, they can spend or bank as they wish. As for those little items...I&#39;ve always just been honest. When I can buy them - I<br/>
 say sure, go ahead. When I can&#39;t afford it - I just say, I&#39;m sorry - I don&#39;t have it right now, but if you still want it the next time we come this way - we&#39;ll try. Usually, either they really want it and we make an effort to get the item - or they forget about it. <br/>
The more honest I am with my kids about everything, from money to food or whatever...the more they understand. I rarely have issues with kids resenting us because we can&#39;t afford something. They know we&#39;ll get it for them if/when we can and if we can&#39;t - then it&#39;s disappointing, but it&#39;s not the end of the world. <br/>
Also - I have found that offering to make a similar item - whether food or toy - helps when I have to say &quot;I just can&#39;t this time.&quot;<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
