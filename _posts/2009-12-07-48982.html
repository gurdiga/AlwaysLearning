<div id="ygrps-yiv-747536149"> Then there is the climbing on the truck top and the shed. We don&#39;t want him on either. He refuses to stay off them! I did the explaining thing,danger talk,that didn&#39;t stop him. One day with my sciatica pain and all,I removed all the stuff he was using to get on the shed,i threw the wheelbarrow on top,the bins,all of it! He found a cooler to stand on! Every time he goes outside i find him on top of the shed...doing a dance sometimes!<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
is it that dangerous? are there some ways it could be less dangerous? Would it still be dangerous if you (or his dad) climbed with him on this shed? <br/>
Did he hurt himself when he did his dance?<br/>
If he climbed on this shed many times and never got injured maybe it&#39;s difficult for him to understand what is so dangerous about it. <br/>
I&#39;ve learnt to be very careful about what i call danger because I want my son to really trust me about danger and not challenge me about it. <br/>
Sometimes something can be dangerous but we can still try it once or twice being really careful, sometimes it&#39;s only dangerous if he goes alone and sometimes it&#39;s just too dangerous/impossible and in this case it&#39;s never a problem. He&#39;s only five (almost) so maybe it&#39;ll change but I doubt it because why would he want to get injured?<br/>
 <br/>
Same thing about the bathroom. Was it possible for the guys to explain a little what they were going to do, let him touch whatever? Was it really impossible for him to stand in some part of the bathroom and watch them?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Of course i offered lots of other things to climb on<br/>
----------------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed here that offering other stuff was only good if i did my best to respond to the first demand<br/>
