<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631085828">HI all.  Please forgive crossposts for anyone who may be on more than <br/>
one list with me.  I&#39;m trying to hit as broad a canvas as possible <br/>
with this information.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Nanci K.<br/>

Hi.  My name is Nanci, ans I am a mom with a son who has Aspergers <br/>
and other special needs.  I have created a brand new mailing list to <br/>
try to connect families in my area.  Please read the information <br/>
below if you are located in Jefferson, Clallam or Kitsap Counties in <br/>
WA State.  Please pass this information along to any other lists or <br/>
individuals whom you think might be interested in it.  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Olympic Peninsula Special At Home is a mailing list for support and <br/>
networking between families in Jefferson, Clallam and parts of <br/>
Kitsap County, Wasington State, who are Homeschooling Special Needs <br/>
or Medically Fragile Kids, or thinking about homeschooling them. <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the list is to connect, offer support, share ideas, <br/>
pass along local news and information about events and services, <br/>
spark friendships, plan get togethers, etc.  My hope for the list is <br/>
to create a safe and friendly virtual community center full of <br/>
understanding and experienced families in our greater community, and <br/>
to build a badly needed social support network for our families.<br/>
<br/>
All homeschooling styles, family types, faiths, and special needs <br/>
are welcome. This is an eclectic and inclusive group with no <br/>
religious or other affiliations.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s reach out to each other and hold hands, creating a web of <br/>
support across the North East Olympic and North Kitsap Peninsulas!</div>
