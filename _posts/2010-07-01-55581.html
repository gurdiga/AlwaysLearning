<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445122833">My daughter is 28 months. For some time now, she has been asking me to, &quot;do it.&quot; For example, if we are playing with a puzzle, she would like me to put down the pieces while she watches. I play with her and ask her if the pieces go here or there, if I need to turn the piece around in order for it to fit. We have fun. I remember reading a John Holt book saying that children (and probably adults) learn by watching. My question is - when does me &quot;doing it&quot; hinder her learning process? I&#39;m asking because I&#39;ve read several books on helping children develop and how it&#39;s important for them to work things out - to make mistakes and learn from them. I know my daughter is young. I also know I have a tendency of helping her with things that she can do on her own - for example, she likes to me to feed her because she doesn&#39;t like to get messy. (I try to get as messy as possible when we do some art exploration - yet, she really doesn&#39;t get messy - I do!) I would love<br/>
 to hear insight on - &quot;You do it!&quot; All the best, M.J.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, people learn best by figuring things out.<br/>
<br/>
But those books leave out the most important part! People learn best  <br/>
when they figure things out *that intrigue them.*<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s asking you to do it, respect her request.<br/>
<br/>
If this helps you see more clearly, you are showing her with your  <br/>
actions how  to listen to someone else&#39;s needs, respect those needs  <br/>
even if they&#39;re different from yours and how to help someone.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re overriding her wishes with your own agenda for her, picture  <br/>
yourself as an old lady with limited abilities who asks her daughter  <br/>
to turn on<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t like to change the oil on your car and asked your  <br/>
husband to do it, would it feel respectful if your husband decided it  <br/>
was more important for you to learn to do it than to respect your  <br/>
dislike of doing it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I also know I have a tendency of helping her with things that she  <br/>

&gt; - I do!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would put that in the same category as above. She may know how to  <br/>
feed herself, but there&#39;s a big yucky barrier between her and the  <br/>
food: not being able to get it into her mouth without getting messy.<br/>
<br/>
Feeding her is respecting that. You might also find foods that aren&#39;t  <br/>
as messy to give her more options. Recognizing her likes and dislikes  <br/>
and helping her get what she likes and avoid what she dislikes is  <br/>
respectful and increases her trust that you&#39;re there to help her  <br/>
navigate the world. Do trust that she *does* want to get better! But  <br/>
she has her own schedule, her own agenda. At some point being messy  <br/>
won&#39;t feel so yucky but it will happen when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if she&#39;s trying to do something and you do it for  <br/>
her because it&#39;s easier for you to do it than watch her fumble with  <br/>
it, that would be disrespectful. And potentially suggesting that  <br/>
getting things done efficiently is more important than her need to  <br/>
play and investigate.<br/>

<br/>
When she asks you to stop doing it and you keep doing it, I figure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also know I have a tendency of helping her with things that she  <br/>
can do on her own - for example, she likes to me to feed her because  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t like to get messy. (I try to get as messy as possible when  <br/>

<br/>
Interesting, about feeding kids.  I was staying with a family where  <br/>
most of the meals were Chinese style, and that is NOT finger food.   <br/>
The kids were being spoon-fed (fork fed, chop-sticks fed, depending on  <br/>
the person and the moment) and it made a lot of sense.  I think  <br/>
American food and a spoon is way easier for little kids than Asian  <br/>
food, so guessing by the original poster&#39;s name/e-mail, maybe it&#39;s a  <br/>
similar deal.  Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I didn&#39;t like to have anything on my hands like food  <br/>
or mud or paint.  It really kinda grossed me out and I would just hold  <br/>
my hands up for someone to clean them.  That passed after a few years,  <br/>
but I still remember the feeling occasionally, and I think the emotion  <br/>
was like fear or helplessness.  Something had made my hands unusable,  <br/>
and I didn&#39;t like that one bit.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For Karl, the answer is almost never, especially if he asks. Sometimes<br/>
I ask if he&#39;d like to have a go, and he will. A good example is<br/>
drawing or painting or anything with pens, crayons. He usually, really<br/>
almost always, used to ask me to draw or write something for him. He<br/>
wanted to know how by watching and observing. Doing what he asks gives<br/>
him the opportunity to see how it can be done. I varied the way I did<br/>
it too sometimes, to give him other or new ideas. Then he may or may<br/>
not try it himself. But he would remember it and put it somewhere in<br/>
his stash of things one can do or whatever he thinks of it as.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even when a child is watching someone do something, there&#39;s an<br/>
expectation of how it might be done, which can be spot on or way off.<br/>
And the child learns from mistakes even if the child isn&#39;t the one<br/>
doing the activity. Right now, Karl is watching walkthroughs on<br/>
Youtube for Wario World. I know he hates making mistakes and it&#39;s sooo<br/>
much easier for him to learn from his own mistaken ideas and from the<br/>
mistakes in the walkthrough than it is for him to make mistakes<br/>
himself to learn from, although he does that too. He about to turn 7,<br/>
close to the age range when accuracy begins to take on more<br/>
importance. So it&#39;s GOOD that it isn&#39;t having to be so difficult<br/>
personally and it&#39;s also good to see that everyone makes a lot of<br/>
mistakes when learning or perfecting what they already have learned<br/>
(learning more).<br/>

&gt; asking me to, &quot;do it.&quot;&lt;&lt;----<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My younger son is 8.  &quot;You do it&quot; is still his daily request of me.  8  <br/>
years is a long time, but I trust that he knows what is right for  <br/>
him.  Recently, he&#39;s been venturing into contributing to my &quot;doing&quot;  <br/>
and even has done a few of his own.  I&#39;m kind of amazed by the detail  <br/>
and level of visual information his mind is processing -- that he  <br/>
wants to include -- the stuff he does is pretty detailed and  <br/>
accurate.  It makes complete sense why he wants to watch me.  I&#39;m no  <br/>
artist, but he is (and wow, is he giving me a good stretch).  He&#39;s  <br/>
getting as much information as he can while he knows his fine motor  <br/>
set doesn&#39;t match his fine mental set... yet.  So, in the meantime, I  <br/>
create (the best I can) what he asks for as exactly as I can.   <br/>
Sometimes I wish I was a lot better for him, but he seems entirely  <br/>
satisfied with what I&#39;m doing, so all is well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s as if I&#39;m the player and he is the director.  His mind has an  <br/>
idea that he simply needs me to support him in whatever way in order  <br/>
for that thing to become real.  Hmmm... I wonder if I&#39;m making sense?<br/>
<br/>
He *did* however, the other day, ask me to add a room to the house.   <br/>
Um... My motor set hasn&#39;t got a clue!  :)  (But deep down in his mind,  <br/>
I think he&#39;d know exactly how to design it.)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

them all ourselves, thank goodness. Sometimes we can imagine doing <br/>
something and imagine the consequences and realize it would be a mistake <br/>
and nobody has to actually make it.<br/>

<br/>
I think some of the &quot;don&#39;t help her&quot; comes from school wanting young  <br/>
children to be able to tie their own shoes and wipe their own butts,  <br/>
so that they can be warehoused earlier and more conveniently, and then  <br/>
be accepting of the &quot;don&#39;t help each other; that&#39;s cheating&quot; culture  <br/>
of school.<br/>
<br/>
In real jobs, people help each other. School is training for testing,  <br/>
though, not for the real world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you saying you think she &quot;should&quot; get messy? I know some adults have an idea that getting messy is something kids need (while others have exactly the opposite expectation!), that its somehow important to learning. Its okay for someone to dislike being messy! <br/>
<br/>
You could try offering her things like aprons and gloves if you think that would help - some kids don&#39;t like the feel of goo or get very stressed about getting favored clothes stained. You could also offer different kinds of implements, things that are easier for her to use without generating mess. It might be a good idea, too, for you to work on not getting so messy, yourself, so that she can see how to do what she wants *and* do it neatly.  <br/>
