went online and found a website that let you try different color<br/>
combinations on walls, furniture and floor. <br/>

  Can you send me a link to that site (if you still know it)? Tamzin would love to do that. We&#39;ve googled and didn&#39;t come up with much.<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>

Here is the link that Hannah used that lets you mess around with colors in<br/>
rooms. It&#39;s a little complicated, but if you read everything carefully on<br/>
each page, you eventually end up with a palette of colors that you want to<br/>
work with (and you can easily change), and then it gives you the sample room<br/>
of your choice to click on, and then you can manipulate the parts of the<br/>
room and make them the colors that you want.<br/>
