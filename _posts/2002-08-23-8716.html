&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My thoughts exactly. There&#39;s nothing stopping anyone doing an OU <br/>
degree part time while working to earn the money to pay for it. In <br/>
fact, I think that ina way its more useful because the student will <br/>
have work expereinece too.<br/>
The downside (in the UK at least) is that OU degrees are <br/>
expensive. We don&#39;t pay tuition for our degrees. They are free to <br/>
UK residents. Poorer students get a government grant while richer <br/>
ones borrow the money from the Student Loans Company with no <br/>
interest.<br/>
I enjoyed my 3 years at university. There was a lot of drinking <br/>
invloved ( another UK thing - you can drink at 18. Perfect timing for <br/>
entering university). It&#39;s fun.<br/>
I still think that any self-motivated person can go from zero <br/>
knowledge to an A level in the required 2 years. I&#39;ve seen HE <br/>
children do that. One took A level maths in 9 months having never <br/>
looked at a math textbook becasue it was important to the CHILD.<br/>
<br/>
My house seems to be a microcosm of the outside world. Me, a <br/>
HE mum who is convinced unschooling in the way to go, my <br/>
husband, who is horrified at the lack of lessons and brings up all <br/>
those tired old arguments that we are often faced with and our <br/>
children who are stuck in the middle.<br/>
I&#39;ve tried telling my husband that even if it all goes horribly wrong <br/>
they can always go to college (high school for anyone over 16) and <br/>
do traditional A levels. They can go at any age. University doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to be done at 18. I went at 20 myself. A levels are free up to <br/>
the age of 19. I told him I will personally go out to work to pay for <br/>
them if the kids are older than that and want them :-)<br/>
<br/>
Seeing my in-laws is a nightmare. FIL is university Professor who <br/>
looks down on anyone without a degree (UK degrees are more <br/>
elitist than the ones here. Fewer people go as the entry <br/>
requirements for university are stricter). He refers to them as <br/>
&#39;plebs&#39;. MIL teaches physics at A level and thinks Science is some <br/>
kind of higher calling. It&#39;s an obsession with her.<br/>
You can now see where DH gets these attitudes from. He went to <br/>
a private school and excelled academically (you can see why can&#39;t <br/>
ya!), went to a prestigious university then got a PhD in 2 years. <br/>
And now he&#39;s married to me. Purple haired hippy who&#39;d rather take <br/>
the kids hiking and socialise with fellow humans. He spends all <br/>
day with DoD scientists and then he comes home to chaos. Dirty <br/>
dishes in the sink, laundry everywhere and the kids and me have <br/>
learned to build a lego fort :-)<br/>

Yes, Joyce, I read both of those.  I don&#39;t seem to be able to narrow it<br/>
down much.  (But I reread The Book of Learning and Forgetting recently<br/>
and don&#39;t think it was in there.)<br/>

It could also be Alfie Kohn, or Howard Gardner or darned near anyone.  I<br/>
think most likely it was a book or magazine article and not a<br/>
