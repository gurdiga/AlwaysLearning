<div id="ygrps-yiv-737063620">Last year we stopped at some little art gallery somewhere and my son<br/>
found paintings he really liked by a local Montana artist.   She&#39;s good<br/>
and they were expensive, so we looked and looked and left without them.  <br/>
<br/>
A little later we made our way into a gallery in our  town, the owner&#39;s<br/>
also an artist and very friendly fellow, and there were several paintings<br/>
by this artist Dylan liked.   She&#39;s an acquaintance, it turns out of the<br/>
gallery owner and he&#39;d arranged for her to be at a yearly artists<br/>
gathering.  <br/>
We went.  <br/>
We wandered around and looked at paintings and talked to artists, all of<br/>
whom were very friendly and encouraging to Dylan.  We finally found where<br/>
this woman was painting and she had three or four projects she was<br/>
working on.  Dylan gushed.  He was so delighted to meet her and talk with<br/>
her and tell her how wonderful she was.  She wasn&#39;t terribly friendly,<br/>
maybe she was hungry or something, but I wished it had been nicer for<br/>
Dylan, although he didn&#39;t seem to care that she wasn&#39;t as engaging as<br/>
some of the other artists we had talked to.  <br/>
So, yesterday we were in Butte, wandering around the galleries and Dylan<br/>
started pointing out these works he liked.  The woman there asked what he<br/>
was doing and he told her he really liked these certain paintings, mostly<br/>
watercolors and he wondered who the artist was.  Well, she said, she was<br/>
the artist and they talked for about half an hour and she showed him a<br/>
book with pictures of all her work.   He told her he also liked this<br/>
other artist and as it happens they knew each other.  <br/>
She said wouldn&#39;t it be nice to meet her at the next artist gathering and<br/>
wouldn&#39;t it be fun to get to talk to two of his favorite artist at the<br/>
same time.. she was very nice.<br/>
This morning the owner of the gallery here in town called me.  He lines<br/>
up all the artists who will come to the annual artist gathering here and<br/>
he said he&#39;d been talking to his friend at the Butte gallery and would my<br/>
son like to be one of the artists in attendance there this year.<br/>
I was so excited.  When he woke up I told him and he said, that&#39;s nice,<br/>
when will it be, ok then, I&#39;m usually not too busy in August.    Just<br/>
like that.  <br/>
Just so matter of fact.  <br/>
