<div id="ygrps-yiv-513689237">This wasn&#39;t commented on when it came by (I don&#39;t think) but I wanted  <br/>
to bring it back to light.<br/>
<br/>
I found it spelled &quot;kaizen&quot; (in this sense of gradual change).   It is  <br/>
kinda like &quot;make the better choice,&quot; huh?  Cool!<br/>
<br/>
I loved this combination of languages:  &quot;In modern usage, a focused  <br/>
kaizen that is designed to address a particular issue over the course  <br/>
of a week is referred to as a &#39;kaizen blitz&#39;.&quot;   A Japanese/German  <br/>
combo term.<br/>

..... I opened up an email about kazien (it was trying to sell me  <br/>
something). My curiosity was peaked so I looked it up. It is a great  <br/>
concept that applies aptly to what we do as unschooling parents.<br/>
<br/>
Even though our families are not businesses the basic premise is the  <br/>
same, I believe. Kazien, which is Japanese, comes from kai (change)  <br/>
and zen (good). According to Wikipedia it &quot;is a Japanese philosophy  <br/>
that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of  <br/>
life.&quot; Kaizen is based on making changes anywhere that improvements  <br/>
can be made. It is about small changes all the time, monitoring the  <br/>
results and then making more small changes and adjustments. This seems  <br/>
like what a lot of us do as we continue to grow as unschooling  <br/>
parents. Little shifts and changes all the time, like little  <br/>
experiments to see what can be tweaked in this moment to make life  <br/>
even better.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking about how I had to slowly keep tweaking things to, for  <br/>
example, find a way to make it out the door on time without upsets.  <br/>
Taking lots of suggestions into consideration, trying them, not  <br/>
discounting anything off-hand. It was a process, and it still is a  <br/>
process ... since my kids change everyday and what works one day may  <br/>
not be perfect for another day.<br/>
