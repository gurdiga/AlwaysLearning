<br/>
Okay, how is asphalt pronouced? And chimney? I say &quot;ass-fault&quot; and<br/>
&quot;chim-nee&quot;. How about pecan? Unless I skipped over it, I didn&#39;t see a<br/>
&quot;correct&quot; pronunciation (I admit to the northern &quot;puh-cahn&quot;)<br/>

A few nights ago on a sitcom an English character said he was going to be in <br/>

ten lines or so American dialog about hamburgers and the truck and a hot dog, <br/>

&gt; OK, I didn&#39;t see this mentioned, so I&#39;ll ask. It&#39;s the one grammar thing<br/>
dh<br/>
&gt; does that drives me absolutely bonkers. (He&#39;s from Oklahoma, so I&#39;ll say<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; more, except that those Michiganders and Pittsburghians have nothing on my<br/>
&gt; mil!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The lawn needs mowed.&quot; &quot;The house needs cleaned.&quot; &quot;The cat needs fed.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s always &quot;needs&quot; with the past tense of the verb. I&#39;ve heard it from<br/>
&gt; other Oklahomans, but no one else. Then again, I don&#39;t get out much.<br/>
Anyone<br/>
&gt; else do this? When I hear this, I finally get to practice my Lamaze!<br/>

this.  <br/>
I like it.  I think it sounds charming in his gentle Oklahoma accent. <br/>
Lately when my husband and son are roughhousing Dylan will say, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>

Presciptive grammarians try to take all the fun out of language as a<br/>
growing, evolving system. There is no &quot;correct&quot; grammar, only grammar<br/>
that those with power have decided is superior.<br/>

Yesterday Cacie and I were out shopping and she admired some little pots<br/>
with skin cream in them that a local potter was selling. The man running<br/>
the shop kept encouraging her to try the &quot;tasters&quot;, and she went over and<br/>
scooped out some of the cream and then asked me if she was really<br/>
supposed to taste it. He was saying  &quot;testers&quot;, of course...<br/>

My dh always says &quot;acrost&quot; when he means &quot;across&quot; and that drives me <br/>
nuts.  That comes from his mother who grew up in rural central Florida <br/>
(when it was still part of the South &lt;g&gt;).  She also says Wal-Mark, <br/>

In England there were five (I think five) major dialects of English, 500 <br/>
years ago.  All were equally legitimate at one time.  The politics of the <br/>
Crown of England settled one of them in to primacy (the king&#39;s English, which <br/>
went into grammar books).  Other dialects survive in part, and that formation <br/>
above probably has as good a history as the other two options, which are to <br/>
add the infinitive &quot;the lawn needs TO BE mowed&quot; or to use the gerund (the <br/>
lawn needs mowing), which is more common in England than in the U.S. or <br/>
Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Reading the history of English might be more fun that Lamaze breathing.  <br/>
There are some very cool survivals in the SE, out to Texas and SE New Mexico.<br/>
