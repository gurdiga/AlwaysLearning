<div id="ygrps-yiv-133209701">Some of the regular readers and contributors to the list are asleep (or quietly awake) in the same hotel I&#39;m in this morning.  We&#39;ve had a day and one evening of talks, playing, singing, puzzle working, coloring, laughing, and eating.  That&#39;s all very tiring.<br/>
<br/>
Though I&#39;ve taken photos and even uploaded some, choosing the best and putting them in a public place has not happened yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I spoke a little bit (intro) and the Pam Sorooshian, Jill Parmer and Joyce Fetteroll presented sessions to very attentive audiences (some of whom were also coloring and working puzzles, drawing or playing with something).  In a room opening to one side, younger kids were playing (though some were in the room with their parents) and in a similar room to the other side were games, tables, and a-few-to-several people playing video games on laptops.<br/>
<br/>
In the back of the main room there were snacks and drinks, some purchased for the symposium and some brought by attendees--leftover Christmas gifts, cookies they had made, Christmas cake from England.<br/>
<br/>
This morning Deb Lewis speaks.  James Daniel is going to do a little follow-up commentary on something from yesterday. After lunch, Rose Sorooshian has a presentation which will morph into some sort of panel or Q&A with some of the older unschooled kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Tonight we&#39;re scheduled to play table games.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning, Adam Daniel (who is six) is speaking on how he learns.  His mum, Julie, will assist him (follow-up commentary, I think).  Then I do the last presentation, and we&#39;re all done except the (probably pretty quiet) New Year&#39;s Eve party for those who are staying over one more night.  I have rum balls, posole and champagne, and I think we might have the leftovers from refrigerators of those who are leaving Saturday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
All this might be part of the reason the discussion list is quiet--that and holidays.<br/>
<br/>
If I put photos up somewhere, I&#39;ll try to remember to put a link here.<br/>
<br/>
For those new to the discussion, I&#39;m referring to the Always Learning Live Unschooling Symposium.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/all">http://sandradodd.com/all</a><br/>

This is exactly what I would love to have happening over here in Australia! Exactly this! <br/>
<br/>
We have had a so called Unschoolers conference in Australia recently, of which I didn’t attend. Without being too critical of the organisers etc it should really have been called the Woo Woo Unschoolers conference. It had such a new age/woo woo saturation and I could tell, from the speakers listed, that it wasn’t going to be my cup of tea. Now they are talking about having another one next year but calling it Shift. It seems to me that it’s way more about the spiritual woo stuff and way not about real unschooling. I wish they would’ve called it that from the start and not confused so many people about unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Since then there’s been a facebook group set up for people far more interested in the real nuts and bolts unschooling, with some people feeling a little jilted by the whole so called unschooling movement over here. I said on that group, just the other day, that we need Sandra to come on over here and straighten out the unschoolers! When I read all about the Unschooling Symposium that is happening in Albuquerque right now I feel so very, very envious and wish I could fly right over and join you all. <br/>
<br/>
I’m hoping that 2012 will be a better year in Australia for unschoolers. We so need more enthusiasm and encouragement over here as there’s no one really making much of a deal about it, yet...<br/>
Enjoy your final day of the symposium.<br/>
<br/>
Kind Wishes<br/>

<br/>
Right now, Rose Sorooshian, Holly and Marty (my second two of three kids) are standing up answering questions.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today there was discussion of what to do if one had a relative (specific example involved a sister) who was so unhappy that a family was unschooling that she was keeping the cousins from visiting much, and there was a growing rift.  I SO THOUGHT OF YOU, Ester!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838347962">Thank you Sandra for your thoughts!<br/>
It is sad when it is so - not sure how to help the situation.<br/>
It is comforting to share with like minded people as there seem to be  not many around who seem to understand!<br/>
Would have liked to hear that discussion regarding a drift within ones family!<br/>
Have fun and we all wish you all good in the New Year!! :)<br/>
