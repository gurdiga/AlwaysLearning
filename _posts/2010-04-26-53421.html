<div id="ygrps-yiv-688597552">I need to recommend someone in the U.S.  who is currently unschooling  <br/>
(kids of school age, at least two) and has Skype, for something that  <br/>
might never be aired.<br/>
<br/>
A little vague; sorry.<br/>
<br/>
May 11, a Tuesday, there is a pilot being made for a possible new talk  <br/>
show for mothers.  They&#39;re doing a piece on unschooling.  It might  <br/>
never actually be on TV, but a fair number of people will see it  <br/>
anyway, so this is an opportunity to do good without being attacked  <br/>
for it! Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
It should be someone who&#39;s articulate and also actually would be  <br/>
willing to do this.   It would be probably just a very short question  <br/>
or two, and it pays nothing.  Exciting, I know.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteers might be okay, but recommendations would be nice too.<br/>

her house was paradise ;) Her girls are often featured on my blog &lt;3<br/>
I think she&#39;d be wonderful!<br/>
