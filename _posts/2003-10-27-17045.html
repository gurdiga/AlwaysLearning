We have a family friend who swears that we should all carry guns to protect <br/>
ourselves.  I worked with battered women for many years, and my partner with <br/>
rape survivors, and we worked with this cool self-defense expert who said that <br/>
carrying guns are a very bad idea.  Most assaults are made by people who are <br/>
NOT carrying a weapon, so the result of having one means that there&#39;s always a <br/>
gun on the scene, and you might not end up being the person controlling it.<br/>
<br/>
He said that being aware of items like keys, ways to use your body, a heavy <br/>
purse, etc, were much more effective things if you needed to use them. <br/>
Ultimately, he said, it&#39;s better to survive, even if something terrible happens to <br/>
you. You can heal from even terrible things. But if you&#39;re killed, it&#39;s just over.<br/>
