fallacy used in place of truth or real analysis, and it makes me crazy.<br/>

Ironically, logic and the study of fallacies works for me because it&#39;s<br/>
labeling. =)   If I can hang a name on the form of mental gymnastics<br/>
someone&#39;s engaging in, it helps me retain my poise and not engage<br/>
needlessly. Sometimes, if I think the person is really trying to discuss, I<br/>
point it out. Sometimes if I think the person is trying to be hurtful, I<br/>
keep it to myself but the knowledge keeps me calm.<br/>

That&#39;s really cool! I&#39;ve just learned so far by reading up on the<br/>
internet and I am amazed and awed that our public leaders don&#39;t even<br/>
learn it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to take a course. <br/>
<br/>
Labels are a useful form of communication and a way to categorize<br/>
information.:) I just think it&#39;s harmful to label people in regards to<br/>
behavior or traits making them &quot;less than&quot;.<br/>

Many of them do, and their speechwriters, too.  Then it&#39;s rhetoric.   <br/>
If you&#39;re using it for a purpose, it&#39;s rhetoric.  If you&#39;re on the  <br/>
other side, it might be  fallacy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Debate teams were going out of style when I was a kid.  They still  <br/>
exist, but they used to be very common, debate competitions.  There  <br/>
are names for rhetorical devices that are called fallacies, but  <br/>
they&#39;re not &quot;fallacy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people are being persuasive, they&#39;re not being clinical.  If  <br/>
someone wants you to join a movement, or to treat your children  <br/>
better, the rhetoric they use might be dissected by others who want  <br/>
to stop them, but it&#39;s up to the listener to be persuaded by one of  <br/>
those sides or the other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239964557">Yes.  I think it&#39;s like labeling.  It&#39;s fine in our own minds to organize<br/>
our thoughts and avoid making crummy conclusions.  Debating doesn&#39;t create<br/>
relationships in itself but it is one thing that can be used to inform.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286112158">One thing I do pay for online is Knowledge News, because I like the  <br/>
writing style and it&#39;s simple and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something about rhetoric.  (Feel free to skip this, anyone  <br/>
who&#39;s not interested, but it does add to the discussion of the good  <br/>
side of what detractors sometimes call &quot;fallacy&quot; on.)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://knowledgenews.net/moxie/todaysknowledge/3-ways-to-persuade.shtml">http://knowledgenews.net/moxie/todaysknowledge/3-ways-to-persuade.shtml</a><br/>
(I quoted it in case the link is only available to subscribers.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aristotle (right) says, &quot;Calm down, Plato.<br/>
Campaign rhetoric isn&#39;t that bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
During the Democratic National Convention last week, KnowledgeNews  <br/>
turned to a political commentator unlike any you&#39;ll find on TV. We  <br/>
turned to famous Roman orator Cicero (106-43 BC). Yes, Cicero has  <br/>
been dead for 2,000 years, but turns out, he can still give today&#39;s  <br/>
politicians advice.<br/>
<br/>
Now, during this week&#39;s Republican National Convention, we&#39;re turning  <br/>
to another political commentator unlike any on TV. We&#39;re turning to  <br/>
famous Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC). He wrote the book on  <br/>
rhetoric--called The Art of Rhetoric--way back in the 4th century BC.<br/>
<br/>
We asked Aristotle, how should those politicians on the podium try to  <br/>
persuade? He told us that, aside from &quot;tortures, depositions, and the  <br/>
like,&quot; there are only three ways: logos, pathos, and ethos. In  <br/>
English, you might say logic, emotion, and character. Put it all  <br/>
together, and you get a reasonable argument, passionately made, by a  <br/>
person you trust.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
￼1. Logos<br/>
<br/>
Logic is an obvious one. After all, who isn&#39;t a sucker for  <br/>
irrefutable facts, verifiable numbers, and the inexorable march of  <br/>
reason across the course of a well-constructed speech? In fact, for  <br/>
many thinkers, including Aristotle&#39;s mentor, Plato, logos is the only  <br/>
legitimate way to win friends and influence people. The rest is  <br/>
sophistry.<br/>
<br/>
Logos was even more persuasive to ancient Greek philosophers, because  <br/>
they had a pretty expansive notion of what logos was. It could be the  <br/>
simple reason in the words of a speech, or it could mean the supreme  <br/>
reason of the universe, which all rational appeals naturally plugged  <br/>
into.<br/>
<br/>
2. Pathos<br/>
<br/>
Still, unlike old Plato, Aristotle was willing to look beyond  <br/>
strictly rational appeals. He recognized that people &quot;do not give  <br/>
judgment in the same way when aggrieved as when pleased&quot;--especially,  <br/>
he snobbily wrote, &quot;audiences of limited intellectual scope and  <br/>
limited capacity to follow an extended chain of reasoning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Enter pathos. Let&#39;s face it, said Aristotle. If you really want to  <br/>
persuade people, sometimes you have to resort to emotional appeals.  <br/>
It&#39;s why campaigns try to wrap themselves in the flag and make you  <br/>
fear the other guy. It&#39;s why a winning smile and puppy-dog eyes work  <br/>
magic in getting your way. It&#39;s why lawyers have the saying &quot;If the  <br/>
facts are on your side, pound the facts. If the law is on your side,  <br/>
pound the law. If neither is, pound the table.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, emotional appeals can take more subtle forms, too.  <br/>
Aristotle pointed out that eloquence itself is a kind of emotional  <br/>
persuasion. &quot;Style makes the matter more persuasive,&quot; he wrote, &quot;for  <br/>
the mind is tricked as though the speaker were telling the truth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
3. Ethos<br/>
<br/>
For a reason-loving philosopher like Aristotle, admitting the power  <br/>
of pathos had to be hard enough. But he goes even further with ethos.  <br/>
&quot;Character,&quot; he wrote, &quot;contains almost the strongest proof of all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Quite simply, it matters who&#39;s trying to persuade you. If the person  <br/>
trying to sway you shows &quot;common sense, virtue, and goodwill&quot; (for  <br/>
Aristotle, an ethical trifecta), then really, aren&#39;t you more likely  <br/>
to believe what that person says? Aristotle thought so, and so  <br/>
thought that persuasive attempts must work to &quot;establish the speaker  <br/>
himself as being of a certain type&quot;--namely, the type of person  <br/>
you&#39;ll believe.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes ethos is the only thing that matters. If, based on arcane  <br/>
medical tests, one doctor says you need immediate surgery, and  <br/>
another says you don&#39;t, how are you going to decide--except by  <br/>
judging who seems more credible? Similarly, lawyers put dueling  <br/>
experts on the stand, and politicians put dueling wonks on TV. Their  <br/>
reasons are obscure and technical, and only ethos makes the sale.  <br/>
That&#39;s why the old vaudeville philosophers used to say, &quot;If you can  <br/>
fake sincerity, you&#39;ve got it made.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047523812">Probably most parents can attest to the fact (logos) that children are<br/>
wonderful at pathos.  It is their most persuasive tactic in a world that<br/>
doesn&#39;t consider them to be particularly logical or having an established<br/>
trustworthy character.  One of the great things about unschooling is that it<br/>
encourages parents to see their children&#39;s logos and ethos just as viably as<br/>
their pathos.<br/>
