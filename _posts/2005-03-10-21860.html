<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869384221">Hi - My name is Julie and I have three children.  We have been a <br/>
loosely structures homeschooling family for seven years.  I am <br/>
burned out.  I am also a Christian - and as I was praying about how <br/>
to cope, I had a book jump out at me in the library on unschooling.  <br/>
I finished it that night - which is a record for me - and started <br/>
searching for more.  I had a friend hand me some John Holt books <br/>
that I haven&#39;t read yet, but I need some information from the <br/>
population.  First of all generally speaking - where is everybody <br/>
from?  Secondly, what was the biggest motivation to &quot;unschooling&quot;?  <br/>
Third, what would be the best piece of advice you could give a new <br/>
unschooler?  I have three children - 7, 11 and 14.  This is all <br/>
pretty new to me and to be honest I am concerned that my 7 year old <br/>
will not read or get basic math facts down - as well as that my 11 <br/>
year old that hates math won&#39;t ever be able to comfortably do basic <br/>
math - or learn to love to read.  <br/>
I would just like to talk to some of you.  I feel a bit like there <br/>
is a stigma attached to unschooling - and am somewhat afraid to let <br/>
people know what my husband and I have decided to do for fear of <br/>
ridicule.  There is only one other unschooling family I know.  I <br/>
think people tend to think it has something to do with laziness.  <br/>
Just the few days we have spent chasing any rabbit trail of the kids <br/>
choosing, I know you cannot be lazy and truly un-school.  <br/>
Thanks for letting me throw my questions out there!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514523876"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I am also a Christian<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might think of Unschooling as &quot;spirit-led-learning&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;John Holt books<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Read them!  They changed my life, the way I looked at learning (has nothing<br/>
to do with &quot;school&quot;) and even the way I parented!  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;- where is everybody <br/>
 </span></blockquote>from? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in and from Texas.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Secondly, what was the biggest motivation to &quot;unschooling&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I started to notice that my child was learning more from the things he<br/>
enjoyed than he was from &quot;school&quot; and I decided I better pay more attention<br/>
to what was working!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Third, what would be the best piece of advice you could give a new <br/>
&gt;unschooler? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Relax, and learn from your children - how they learn and when they learn.<br/>
Read those John Holt books!  Let everyone do what they want while you study!<br/>
Let them see you learning, it&#39;s a great example to set!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;basic math facts down<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Basic math facts can be picked up from doing everyday things.  I&#39;m not<br/>
talking just about board games that use dice or educational games or<br/>
cooking.  Maybe others can give more examples.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;hates math won&#39;t ever be able to comfortably do basic <br/>
&gt;math - or learn to love to read. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reason children hate math or reading is because they were forced to read<br/>
or do math before they were ready.  I would rather have a child that loves<br/>
math and reading than a child who learned early, but who hates reading and<br/>
math.  When children are allowed the freedom to read and do math, they don&#39;t<br/>
hate it.  When things are forced on us, we hate them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;afraid to let <br/>
&gt;people know what my husband and I have decided to do<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who cares what others think?  You are the mother.  You don&#39;t have to tell<br/>
them that you are &quot;Unschooling&quot; just say that you are letting the children<br/>
have autonomy over their own education.  Just brag about the things your<br/>
children do on their own.  Do they play on the computer?  Make web pages?<br/>
Do computer art? (paint program)  It might take awhile, but your children<br/>
will start to crave knowledge and it might not be from a text book.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;for fear of <br/>
&gt;ridicule. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learn learn learn.  Read those HOLT books!  Arm yourself with information -<br/>
best shield for caring about ridicule!  Become the expert!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;laziness<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Relaxing and enjoying your children is not laziness.  Sure, we aren&#39;t<br/>
pushing and pushing and stressing and stressing, but that doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>
are lazy.  Might mean we aren&#39;t stressed.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know you cannot be lazy and truly un-school. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can be lazy and do anything!  Hee hee  <br/>

<h4>Julie</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257486464">Kelly - Thanks so much for the reply - <br/>
I think it is great.  I really do already get the unschooling philosophy.  I<br/>
want to read a book called something about De-schooling ourselves.  I really<br/>
need that because that is the biggest hinderance.  My son is always doing<br/>
things that are math as part of the natural world.  Like for instance, at<br/>
this very moment he is rolling pennies and telling me how much he has in<br/>
dollar amounts - and hundreds - all on his own.  Left to do things like that<br/>
he seems to learn more than he can on paper from a workbook.  I have always<br/>
seen that and yet my own fear has kept me from letting it just happen that<br/>
way. <br/>
The unschooling book that helped me was the Unschooling Handbook  - It was a<br/>
huge encouragement.  It basically gave me the courage to let go of what I<br/>
was trying to do and the frustration that they weren&#39;t absorbing the facts<br/>
that I was trying to shove in anyway.  They really truly only learn what<br/>
they are bent towards and interested in.  The rest seems to be fact spewing.<br/>
 <br/>
Also as far as teaching the 7 year old to be a good reader - he basically<br/>
already reads just not strong - yesterday he let me know he wanted to<br/>
practice reading because he wants to know what his sisters spell to try to<br/>
hide things from him.  So evidently this will be a covert operation between<br/>
the two of us.  Ah that mother and child bonding!!!!! :)<br/>
Thanks again - I really appreciate the time you took to write me and the<br/>
links to others maybe more in the same place as me.<br/>
Sincerely - Julie<br/>

<br/>
About that autonomy line: My favorite was when Duncan, at age five, would tell people he was an autodidactic. THEN he&#39;d have to tell them what that was! Vocabulary lesson from a five year old! Shut them up every time! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;d say that, folks would think I must have REALLY brilliant, off-the-charts, smart kids.<br/>
<br/>
I DO!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But people would think that mine were too smart for school. Worked like a charm! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

skills), only better!  It&#39;s using the skills in context.  A worksheet would<br/>
be taking a skill out of a real life context.  I want math to be meaningful<br/>
and to have value to my child - not something to be feared or loathed.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We collect change and then roll our change too.  What the children are doing<br/>
would look really impressive on paper, but they are doing it in their head -<br/>
where math should be.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think I got very dependent on working things out on paper.  It made my<br/>
brain not work as hard.  What do you think about that?<br/>
