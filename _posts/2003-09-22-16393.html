<div id="ygrps-yiv-24433316">With my kids the things I find important and relevant is limited to supporting them to follow their joy, showing them how by following my own joy and giving them feedback, information.

The opening of my heart with my experience of the situation brings immediate peace.  One open heart is an invitation to openness that is irresistible and I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s what everyone is looking for.

Our culture is very intellect oriented, intellect separated from the heart.  Schools and other &quot;systems&quot; do not provide a safe environment for the emotional side of life.

 <br/>
My son and I both needed to recognize that testosterone is pumping through his veins at an alarming rate.  It was very hard for me to understand that his normal level of testosterone would probably send me to the lock up.  This young guy had to learn to take what nature had intended as a survival drive and try to function in a stifling society.  We bought him a punching bag and he used it.  He loves to shovel dirt and move big rocks.  (This from a 15yo who&#39;s teaching himself web page design.)  Now he studies martial arts.  He is a sensitive, gentle friend who won&#39;t even kill spiders &quot;because they&#39;re defenseless,&quot; but you&#39;d never know it if you heard him &quot;going off.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
He still has abundant testosterone and needs me to ask him what is going on in his life to cause him such frustration.  It usually has nothing do to with the random appearance of the outburst.  Now we have a running dialog about his friends and his activities which he happily shares because I ruthlessly refuse to try to manipulate or control his relationships or activities.  Unless of course he asks for my input.  I do point out discrepancies between what his friends say and what they do without attaching any meaning or blame, just info.  <br/>
 <br/>
We laugh about a lot of things together - I think that&#39;s really important.  I also tell him when I&#39;m concerned about how I perceive his friend&#39;s treatment of him, but always with &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re abandoning yourself when you tell Rob that you don&#39;t want to hang out today and he shows up anyway and you let him in, etc....&quot;  He will usually ignore frustrations like that until he blows and then remembers that I mentioned the situation before and he feels free to reintroduce the subject.<br/>
 <br/>
Last night we went through this routine.  He explained how Rob has been violating his boundaries (to sum it up.)  I asked him if he could use the remote and put Rob on &quot;pause,&quot; what would he like to say to Rob?  He had no trouble at all defining exactly what he wanted.  Once you can imagine yourself accomplishing something, it&#39;s easy to do.  Without these discussions he would just walk around frustrated and blowing his stack all the time.  It only &quot;works&quot; for us if I have an open heart, deep affection for him and no agenda.<br/>
 <br/>
I also tell him that his experience is really normal for his age (this comforts him tremendously to know he&#39;s not alone) and that he is an amazing person to be navigating life at such a tender age.<br/>
 <br/>
With their growth I try to maintain the attitude that I had when they were learning to walk:  there are no mistakes, falling down is part of the process, mutual enjoyment, full expectation of success.<br/>
 <br/>
Also I firmly believe that the kids mirror me.  I can be a perfectionist and highly frustrated with myself, but, as much as it galls me, I&#39;m striving towards more mediocrity with unimportant things and hopefully I&#39;ll live longer.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847401414">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post. My daughter is 3 and we intend to let her direct her own learning. I work full time and my wife stays home with her. I&#39;ve read a few John Holt books and am very excited about the ideas. I just read Sandra Dodd&#39;s great article on &quot;Leaning on a Truck&quot; and remembered the countless hours my brother and I spent with Legos.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I&#39;d like to get some pattern blocks, but the only ones I can find online are plastic, and I would much prefer some nice wood ones. I want to get A LOT of them. Enough to sit on the rug together and make large patterns. I am thinking Emma might like Tinkertoys as well, but I&#39;m not sure if they might require just a little too much dexterity and frustrate her. Then again, she is so determined--if I&#39;m not sure then she will most likely get it.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other assembly type toys I might be able to find on eBay or wherever. I had Lincoln logs when I was a kid but I remember them being somewhat limited. I could be wrong about that. Any input on this vague post is most welcome. Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Danny<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got a big tub of wooden pattern blocks at www.educatorsoutlet.com.  My kids <br/>
and all their little friends just love them.  Like anything else, though, <br/>
they don&#39;t particularly like to be directed in HOW to play with them, they just <br/>
like making their own patterns and things.  There are a lot of books of pattern <br/>
block cards that will show kids how to make the things that they will <br/>
naturally make all by themselves - flowers, trucks, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion along with tinker toys, are the Gears, Gears, Gears sets.  <br/>
She might need a little help to get the hang of it, but then just watch her <br/>
go with it!<br/>

Thanks for the kind slant of your comment on my &quot;truck&quot; article. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the wooden things were called &quot;Cuisinaire Attribute Blocks.&quot;<br/>
A stupid name, but nice tiles!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid to think of what they&#39;d cost now.  We have our two $25 sets, which <br/>
we now keep in two plastic trays made for silverware (similar to the other <br/>
thrift-store silverware trays in which we keep colored pencils and crayons).<br/>
<br/>
$50 worth of stained hardwood is probably a smaller pile now than it was ten <br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
We just got a catalog in the mail yesterday, VERY nice, called Magic Cabin <br/>
and they list a website.  They don&#39;t have those, but they had some other <br/>
wooden-piece things.<br/>
<br/>
And they have a website listed:<br/>
www.magiccabin.com<br/>
<br/>
I especially liked the wooden &quot;nesting elements.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mini Mosaic Puzzles were the wooden things I was thinking of.<br/>

living room table right now!  But we also like some magnetic ones that we<br/>
found called Kaleida Jewels.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter also loves to play with wooden construction sets, the kind that<br/>
have screws, nuts, bolts, rods, blocks w/ holes, wheels, etc.  I wish I<br/>
could give you some product names to search for, but we didn&#39;t save any of<br/>
the original packages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164868223">**I trust his driving.   I don&#39;t trust everyone else.   He&#39;s never changed a <br/>

I feel the adrenaline in my elbows, from thinking about him driving alone.<br/>

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll both be fine. &lt;g&gt;**<br/>
<br/>
Melissa does have a cell phone - she drives a lot at night on back roads and <br/>
bad roads, it saves my sanity if not hers. She called last night at 8:20 in <br/>
tears, my heart started beating really fast until she calmed down enough to tell <br/>
me she&#39;d hit a racoon. Sad and scary, but not nearly as scary as the stuff I <br/>
had flashing through my head until then. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t sleep till she&#39;s home safe, especially on weekends. Too many drunks <br/>
out.<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday a turkey vulture stood on the side of the road enjoying his dinner <br/>
(a skunk) as we were driving down our road.  This is a common occurrence.  <br/>
They usually either walk to the side of the road or take off long before we get <br/>
there.  Sometimes there are several of them.  Well, this one changed his mind <br/>
in mid-lift and got off a little late and we flew into each other.  He knocked <br/>
the side mirror right off my Beetle!  <br/>
<br/>
I thought he was surely dead, because he hit the road after the impact made <br/>
him fly up over the car and I could see him sprawled out flat.  Then, in the <br/>
rearview, I saw him miraculously arise from that position and take flight!<br/>
<br/>
The car stunk like skunk on that side for a while.  I had to deconstruct the <br/>
mirror so it wouldn&#39;t fall off on the interstate.  I was afraid to touch it <br/>
for getting the stink on me.<br/>
<br/>
When we came home later, there was his dinner right where he left it, and no <br/>
sign of him, so I guess he&#39;s okay.  It did get me wondering if turkey vultures <br/>
who get whacked on our road get eaten by other turkey vultures.  Can&#39;t recall <br/>
ever seeing it happen.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I am thinking Emma might like Tinkertoys as well, but I&#39;m not sure if they might require just a little too much dexterity and frustrate her. Then again, she is so determined--if I&#39;m not sure then she will most likely get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are there any other assembly type toys I might be able to find on eBay or wherever. I had Lincoln logs when I was a kid but I remember them being somewhat limited.<br/>
