<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534455908">It&#39;s the chicken vs. the egg. <br/>
<br/>
When you all kept telling me to JUST DO IT, and I kept asking HOW??? I<br/>
was so frustrated. So after getting booted (honestly, I didn&#39;t know to<br/>
read for awhile before posting, if I had, I would have learned a<br/>
ton...), I mulled over what.the.heck. I was supposed to do now...<br/>
<br/>
Then I&#39;d &quot;hear&quot; Sandra...&quot;just be with your kids...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but THEN what? How do I.....?  &quot;just play with your kids....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so then I....?  &quot;Just quit asking and DO already!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I still didn&#39;t get it. And so I read. And went back and read some<br/>
more. And read on different forums, and read more of Joyce&#39;s stuff,<br/>
and even more links that I hadn&#39;t of Sandra&#39;s....<br/>
<br/>
And I realize that by being with the kids today, I still haven&#39;t<br/>
solved the &quot;problems&quot; of tomorrow. My &quot;what-ifs&quot; still aren&#39;t answered. <br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the thing - they don&#39;t need to be! When we get to tomorrow,<br/>
we&#39;ll figure it out. When the &quot;if&quot; happens, THEN we&#39;ll meet it head-on.<br/>
<br/>
And in the end, I need to be just as confident of my children&#39;s<br/>
choices and their leading me as any of you are of your children<br/>
leading you. I can&#39;t compare my journey to yours and count myself<br/>
short. There isn&#39;t an unschooling measuring stick that says I am<br/>
behind. That&#39;s just me still trying to use my schooling ideas to feel<br/>
good about my parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I do wish, however, that I could hear these discussions coming from<br/>
real lips, because I know that imagined tones are sometimes harsher<br/>
than they&#39;re meant to be. Though sometimes I know that many of you are<br/>
just like my DH and tell it like it is! I&#39;m the gentler kind - I don&#39;t<br/>
want to tell it like it is, if it will hurt. Sadly, I tend to stand by<br/>
and watch you fall instead of warning you because I was afraid you&#39;d<br/>
take it the wrong way...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m starting to catch on, and though I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever<br/>
get a tougher skin about me, I think I have realized (through other<br/>
sources in my life this week as well) that I am the best mom for my<br/>
kids and I&#39;m trying to let them be the best kids they can be. My<br/>
oldest, thank goodness, is like her dad and isn&#39;t afraid to tell me<br/>
when I&#39;ve messed up!<br/>
<br/>
So...thanks, <br/>
<br/>
Deb</div>

<br/>
You didn&#39;t get booted.  You just were asked  to shush and read and  <br/>
think and do and THEN write.<br/>
<br/>
If  you&#39;d been booted, you wouldn&#39;t be posting this now. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Try not to think of them &quot;leading you&quot; for too long.  I don&#39;t think  <br/>
you got that from my pages or Joyce&#39;s.  &quot;Child led learning&quot; isn&#39;t a  <br/>
term used much here.<br/>
<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;led&quot; by anyone.  It needs a rich  <br/>
environment, which is up to the mom (and both parents, and kids  <br/>
eventually, but not at first) to provide.<br/>

as sensitive as you ever were.  Toughening your skin really *is*<br/>
schoolthink.  It&#39;s all about comparisons and grades and normatives (or<br/>
whatever you want to call it).  Those things can be painfully ostracizing<br/>
and I never got used to them.<br/>
<br/>
Your eyes have been opened and when you acclimate to the light it stops<br/>
feeling quite so bright.  You&#39;ll gain a clarity you didn&#39;t have before.<br/>
<br/>
All without toughening or doing anything to your skin, you&#39;ll get more<br/>
comfortable in the skin you&#39;re in and make changes to the old ways that<br/>
don&#39;t fit the goals you are now in the process of taking up.<br/>

<br/>
I know, right?<br/>
(I was channelling Holly there, though it doesn&#39;t show in writing.   <br/>
If anyone says anything nice about her hair, she says &quot;I know,  <br/>
right?&quot; with a certain girly-voice.)<br/>
<br/>
People who know me before they see my writing know it&#39;s downright  <br/>
mushy and sweet, because I write in my own voice.  Editors try to  <br/>
&quot;stilt it&quot; up and make it sound like other people, and I say take it  <br/>
as it is or don&#39;t publish it (not counting finding spelling errors  <br/>
and that).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386344932">The results to look for is incorporating unschooling in real ways that we&#39;ve<br/>
tried and can actually see working in our families.  As a slow deliberate<br/>
process, the knowledge has a chance to stick.  There&#39;s no unschooling exam<br/>
or test to cram for, so there&#39;s no need to remember stuff or feel on the<br/>
spot about it, only to promptly forget our last name.<br/>
<br/>
Fitting unschooling in bit by bit and pushing forward to gain the knowledge<br/>
and skills I need and keeping the desire alive is something I can do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to dampen desire for unschooling and grouse and grumble, and<br/>
piss all over today (as someone once said so eloquently).  Keeping the<br/>
desire alive means avoiding those things and staying in the light!<br/>
