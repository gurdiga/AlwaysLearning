<div id="ygrps-yiv-492882388">Hi folks.<br/>
<br/>
I just have to tell you what my son, 8-year-old Liam, just said to me. He <br/>
really blows me away sometimes.  He told me that he had been having a <br/>
conversation with a friend of his, a schooled, for lack of a better term <br/>
right now, typically parented kid.  They were discussing, I guess, behavior <br/>
or something like that.  Liam&#39;s friend remarked that it was most desirable <br/>
to be &quot;good.&quot; But, Liam argued that it was better to be &quot;normal.&quot;  He said <br/>
to me just now, &quot;I told _____ that it&#39;s better to be normal, you know, to <br/>
be yourself.  Right, Mom?&quot;  I think I only started to understand that when <br/>
I was 37 years old, and I&#39;m not quite sure I totally have it down yet!  I <br/>
do know that I have never overtly said anything like that to him.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t think of any folks better to share that with than you.  See you!<br/>

<br/>
Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
I will use this topic, then to tell you Holly&#39;s three wishes.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading poetry to her one night last week, and one was about catching a <br/>
fairy and making wishes.  She asked me what my wishes would be if I could <br/>
have three wishes, and she said it couldn&#39;t be anything like world peace or <br/>
that the women in Iraq could wear whatever they wanted to.  It had to be <br/>
selfish.<br/>
<br/>
So I came up with three pretty mundane grown-up wishes about the house being <br/>
paid off, and enough money to maintain it without Keith working, and a new <br/>
van.<br/>
<br/>
Boring.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s were this:<br/>
<br/>
Invisible eyelids so she could see with her eyes closed.  I told her some <br/>
snakes and I thought maybe some lizards had that.  She was happy to hear <br/>
that, and hadn&#39;t known.<br/>
<br/>
The second wish was to know whether we live other lives.<br/>
<br/>
Third wish was dependent on the second.  If the answer was yes, she wanted to <br/>
remember past lives.  If the answer was no, she wanted a thousand dollars. <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was way more thoughtful and creative than I would have wished at <br/>
eleven.  I might have wished for a bunch of books and a hundred dollars, I <br/>
think.  Inflation accounts for some of that, but unschooling has to account <br/>
for more.<br/>

If you have the room, time, etc. there are MANY breeders of many different <br/>
breeds of dogs that are willing to GIVE a child a dog of her very own for <br/>
agility. Contact me off-list of you&#39;re interested!<br/>

I knew she meant Afghanistan when she said it, but I didn&#39;t correct her <br/>
because it was just in the course of her clarifying the rules for the three <br/>
wishes.  I didn&#39;t tell her about Iran or anything either, just went with her <br/>
examples of what would be too unselfish.<br/>
<br/>
But thanks for the reminder.  If I get a chance to bring it up, I will.  We <br/>
need to get a new globe that doesn&#39;t have the Soviet Union, so maybe that <br/>
will be a good time to chit chat about what and who&#39;s where and what they&#39;re <br/>
wearing this season.<br/>
