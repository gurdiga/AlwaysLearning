<div id="ygrps-yiv-260226791">I can&#39;t remember when the unschooling.com site stopped it&#39;s message <br/>
boards - was it 2 or so years ago?  Anyway, I used to visit that site <br/>
every day!  Maybe some of you remember, maybe not, but no matter - I&#39;ve <br/>
found another great group!  <br/>
I&#39;ve got some memberships in other unschooling/homeschooling yahoo <br/>
groups but none that I actively participate in, though it was one of <br/>
those groups that mentioned the AlwaysLearning group, so I checked it <br/>
out.<br/>
I saw the name Sandra Dodd and that was it for me and here I am!<br/>
My ds Aaron is now 12 and my dd Amber is 8, we still unschool and I <br/>
still experience worries and doubts.  I won&#39;t elaborate on those yet, I <br/>
just wanted to say &quot;HI!&quot;</div>

<br/>
Longer, I think.  It&#39;s a bummer.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another message board here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.info/forum/">http://unschooling.info/forum/</a><br/>
<br/>
and there are a couple of lists on which I&#39;m active--this one and   <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion which is described and linked here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingdiscussion">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingdiscussion</a><br/>
<br/>
For you doubts, try Joyce&#39;s really well-organized collection<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
or putter around my ever-growing site<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
or search here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/search">http://sandradodd.com/search</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have some fun on this list, too.  The archives are &quot;new- <br/>
improved&quot; and easily searchable.  You might want to try that too,  <br/>
just go to the main page of this list or click the messages link at  <br/>
the bottom of an e-mail and there&#39;s a search function right there.   <br/>
That&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
