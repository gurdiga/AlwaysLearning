<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114122204">Going no mail for a while due to (embarressed grin) terrible pains in my hands<br/>
and wrists from too much computer.<br/>
Anyone want me can contact me offlist<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564743352">I have some writing and other deadlines - some self imposed yet all very important to me - coming up and I have a tendency to use my meagre alone time reading email. Anything to procrastinate actual writing/crafting work! <br/>
<br/>
Therefore I am going No Mail very temporarily. See you all soon, with good news about writing successes I hope.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs to speak to me specifically please go ahead off list. I will still be checking my mail often, just reducing volume for the time being.<br/>
