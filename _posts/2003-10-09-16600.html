When a more radical unschooler tells someone who doesn&#39;t want to really <br/>
unschool that something or other isn&#39;t going to produce unschooling results, <br/>
then <br/>
the less radical unschooler might upon occasion say to the more radical <br/>
unschooler something like<br/>
You think you own unschooling<br/>
or<br/>
Not everyone has to unschool the way you do<br/>
or<br/>
There are as many ways to unschool as there are unschoolers<br/>
or<br/>
Who died and made you god?<br/>
<br/>
or something suggesting that the person who honestly only really wanted to <br/>
help them be courageous and free is somehow trying to limit their unschooling <br/>
to <br/>
just radical, actual, workable unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562072358">So what are the &quot;hard-liner&quot; lists, so to speak, in your opinion --  if you don&#39;t mind saying?   I&#39;m in the middle of trying out multiple lists, and while I certainly don&#39;t view myself as an &quot;expert&quot; on anyting, the wish-washy handholding drives me nuts, and I would like to avoid it where possible. <br/>

I was interested in what others&#39; unschooling days looked like and for some creative unschooling ideas.  I wonder if it will get to that??<br/>

Thanks for being in the trenches for me ( and others)  immersing ourselves in real unschooling.  I just don&#39;t think I have enough unschooling under my belt to help you all, yet.  And really I just don&#39;t have the eloquent and succinct words you both (and others) have, yet.<br/>

<br/>
Creative  unschooling ideas are easier to come by yourself after you see what <br/>
other families are doing, so I think that page would help.<br/>
<br/>

Go especially to <br/>

Leaning on a Truck<br/>

www.unschooling.com message boards has lots of idea-discussions.<br/>
