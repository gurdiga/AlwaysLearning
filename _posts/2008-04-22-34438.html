Eleven and twelve are leftover evidence (along with dozens and  <br/>
&quot;gross&quot;) of base 12 days, and base 12  ties in nicely with 360  <br/>
degrees in a circle and 12 months in a year.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
After twelve, the numbers go<br/>
<br/>
three and ten (thirteen)<br/>
<br/>
four and ten (fourteen)...<br/>
<br/>
At twenty (two tens:  twa/twin/two) it seems to get &quot;normal,&quot; but<br/>
<br/>
thirteen<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
thirty both have to do with threes.  Three and ten, and three tens...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so the English word for 81 means eight-tens-and-one.<br/>

My cousin Nada was slightly older than I was (well... still is!) and  <br/>
lived with us from the time she was nearly eight.  She did addition  <br/>
and subtraction by touching her pencil to different points on the  <br/>
numbers, something she had figured out for her own purposes.  Maybe  <br/>
she had figured that out too!  But I think she had an overlaying  <br/>
pattern of some sort and started on the five point (of her imagined  <br/>
pattern) and walked (like moves in a board game) to the new number.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe an ancient Phoenician manuscript explains that.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first things I was interested in, historically,  was the  <br/>
history of writing.  We had a dictionary that had older forms at the  <br/>
top of every letter&#39;s beginning.  I&#39;ve done calligraphy for 30 years,  <br/>
and tried before then to learn it on my own.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a seven with a line at the bottom, ever.<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a nine that had more than one small curve at the  <br/>
bottom.  Usually it ends straight.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe ancient phoenicians did more lines, but I can&#39;t imagine it  <br/>
would&#39;ve been efficient to write those numerals with three strokes  <br/>
(as the 7 pictured there would&#39;ve had) when using the numbers for any  <br/>
practical purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe somewhere there were ideal forms that had those angles and the  <br/>
written form was a representation of those.  Like the dot patterns  <br/>
that make up constellations of stars with their ideal overlays and  <br/>
story connections.<br/>
<br/>
And on fours, the fact that their line doesn&#39;t cross over the  <br/>
vertical seems suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
So I think what I&#39;m asking is that nobody here &quot;teach&quot; children that  <br/>
numerals have that many angles.  Maybe say &quot;might have once,&quot; but I  <br/>
think that&#39;s as far as truth can go.<br/>
<br/>
There are other cool number systems to look at.  cuneiform/ <br/>
Babylonian  (oooh!  wikipedia has a big number chart!)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_numerals">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_numerals</a><br/>
and  runes, though they vary place to place, are interesting.   <br/>
Sometimes they needed to edges of a 90 degree surface, because they  <br/>
were whittlings on split sticks, or carvings on the edge of worked  <br/>
stones.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the numbers here, which are akin to Roman on the small ones,  <br/>
but really cool on big numbers:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hungarian_runes.htm">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hungarian_runes.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known runes as NW European things, and I don&#39;t know how far east  <br/>
they went (or from where in the East they  might&#39;ve come).<br/>
<br/>
Practicalities of formation will change depending on how the letters  <br/>
are being formed.  Sticks pressed on wet clay?  Carvings with a  <br/>
little knife?  Chisel on a rock?  (That&#39;s the explanation I&#39;ve heard  <br/>
most for Roman numerals:  they needed to be made with a chisel.)  <br/>
Stick on wax?  Pen and ink on parchment?  Ballpoint pen on notebook  <br/>
paper? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing about numbers, too, is that although we set them all on the  <br/>
same line, same height, not long ago (within a couple of hundred  <br/>
years) some went below the line (the real or imagined line), and some  <br/>
were shorter.<br/>
<br/>
As with lots of history, simplifying it can make it untrue.  Let it  <br/>
be complicated!  Kids can grasp and appreciate complication.  It  <br/>
gives them more mysteries to look out for in their lives.  If we act  <br/>
as though everything cool has been discovered, maybe our kids won&#39;t  <br/>
look around with the same curiosity and expectation as they will if  <br/>
we tell them (truthfully) lots of history is right in front of us,  <br/>
unnoticed!<br/>

represent the number of dots that corresponds to a number feels  <br/>

The angle theory holds up for 1,2,3 and 4 and shows their ancient  <br/>
forms. But then it breaks down and a circle represented a closed fist  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My pattern worked in that way, I could easily touch the pencil to the  <br/>
number.  I had teachers that wouldn&#39;t let us use our fingers (the  <br/>
first calculators) -- so I found this other trick.  I never realized  <br/>
that I hadn&#39;t told anyone about it until now.... well..... because it  <br/>
felt like cheating.  Bummer about that, because it was a cool trick.   <br/>
I&#39;m glad I get to share it now!!<br/>
<br/>
In looking at the website w/ the angles I don&#39;t see the connection  <br/>
with my own system.  As Sandra pointed out, there are extra lines in  <br/>
odd places.  My system was more about end-points, corners, and I  <br/>
counted curves.  And, it is way faster than fingers but not nearly as  <br/>
fast as using a calculator.<br/>
<br/>
OMG, I loved looking at those Babylonian numerals.  There is such a  <br/>
beautiful symmetry and balance.... which is how numbers actually feel  <br/>
to me.  It&#39;s so curious that they chose to draw the bar across the  <br/>
Y... it makes for a stable building block, which they then use for  <br/>
larger digits.  But then they have a shortcut for 9 (or maybe it&#39;s  <br/>
just hard to see all the Y shapes... it looks like squares.)<br/>

loved to discover that my own musings had indeed been discovered  <br/>
years ago.  Somehow I felt more connected with my world when I would  <br/>
find out....  It&#39;s fun to explore the ideas, to play around with  <br/>
patterns and to find/invent new ways to express ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Just recently my dd has been learning how to ride a bike.  While on  <br/>
the bike she stuck her feet straight out in front and coasted for  <br/>
awhile.  She was so thrilled she called to me and said &quot;Mom, look  <br/>
what I just invented!&quot;  She is always inventing.  I&#39;m glad you are  <br/>
reminding us/me that it&#39;s helpful to connect with our kids about how  <br/>
cool it is that *they* are discovering the world -- even if someone  <br/>
else discovered it before them.  I was thrilled for her enthusiasm,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739494540">Last night after I found a picture of those numbers/angles I also found<br/>
lots of discussion(s) about whether or not it was factual.  It seemed<br/>
the consensus was that it wasn&#39;t.  I would have loved to have had a<br/>
computer at my finger tips when I was in college (well, one that wasn&#39;t<br/>
on dial up and took 3 minutes to get to each page,lol).  That<br/>
angle/number info was in a textbook, I would have loved to been able to<br/>

seven), etc...&quot;Catorce and quince&quot; (14 and 15 respectively) are particularly<br/>
difficult for young kids to remember because they are different enough from<br/>
4 and 5 (cuatro, cinco). At the same time, when learning French those few<br/>
numbers (13, 14, 15) were particularly easy for me to remember because of<br/>
the similarity with Spanish. I wish I knew enough latin/linguistics to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; connection between the number and the angles/points on the written<br/>

&gt; My husband, Keith, wrote that. He&#39;s big into math and history and<br/>
