<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093553351">The only way Spanish ever stuck for me was spending time with people who<br/>
were native Spanish speakers.  A friend had made it his life&#39;s mission to<br/>
help new immigrants and was teaching ESL at a local restaurant free of<br/>
charge.  I asked if I could come.  The other students did lessons in English<br/>
and I helped them.  I did lessons in Spanish and they helped me.  It was<br/>
wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I also spent some time helping families whose children were in school but<br/>
the parents didn&#39;t speak English.  The parents had great difficulty helping<br/>
their kids with assignments and practicing reading.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if any formal groups would discriminate against a youngster<br/>
helping out but it might be worth a try.<br/>
