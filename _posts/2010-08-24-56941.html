<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105742240">My son who will turn 4 at the beginning of December is showing an interest in letters, reading, writing.<br/>
<br/>
He learned the alphabet, shapes, numbers, and colors very young, there was always an interest/curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
Today I was reading a book to him where two bunnies write love letters to each other.<br/>
There are pictures of the actual letters, so Logan said he wanted to write me a letter.<br/>
<br/>
I thought he was going to want scribble on the paper, but he said he wanted to write an actual letter, but he didn&#39;t know how.<br/>
Until he was about 2.5 (when he discovered trains and cars) we drew togeter everyday, he held a pencil the correct way, and could draw adoreably crude people.<br/>
Now he wraps all his fingers around the pencil.<br/>
He wanted me to help him do the letters, and tell him which each one was.<br/>
I put my hand over his, and we did it together.<br/>
<br/>
Do I show him the correct way to hold the pencil?<br/>
I want to help and encourage his interest without becoming pedagogical about it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. The letter he wanted to write said:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mommy,<br/>
Cuddle up to Logan.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll cherish it forever!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101168864">***I thought he was going to want scribble on the paper, but he said he wanted <br/>

<br/>
I found chalk boards to be invaluable for learning how to write and draw things. <br/>
 It requires a combination of large and small motor skills which I found really <br/>
young kids adapt to easier than straight small motor skills like piece of paper <br/>
and pencil.<br/>
<br/>
***Do I show him the correct way to hold the pencil?***<br/>
<br/>
If he asks, show him.  If he seems to be struggling, suggest other ways to do <br/>
it.  My kids tended to copy what I was doing.  Then they both found their own <br/>
ways to hold a pencil and form their letters.<br/>

<br/>
Show him how you hold it.  Maybe show him some alternative ways.  My  <br/>
best friend in elementary had the best handwriting, and never &quot;held  <br/>
her pencil right.&quot;  It was stickup up between her index and middle  <br/>
fingers.<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, I showed them the way school taught me to do it, and  <br/>
another couple of options, and suggested they experiment and look  <br/>
around at what others were doing.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re practicing with markers and crayons, too.  It&#39;s not a totally  <br/>
new moment in manual dexterity, when they start to make letters.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s pretty wonderful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854058603">When Jayn first wanted to make letter forms, I would make the shape of the letter with my fingers and hands for her. She was then able to recognize the letter and copy it. <br/>
<br/>
She worked out the order of her strokes to write the letters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407574181">Hayden, freshly 12, began writing prolifically at 4 :) He is a lover of<br/>
spiral notebooks and I have many from his young childhood, still!<br/>
He made lists of our movies, of the contents of our pantry; I would spend<br/>
long stretches of time spelling each word of the story he wanted to tell<br/>
(sometimes he would dictate it to me to jot down, then I read & spelled it<br/>
back to him for him to write in his notebook); I made lists of words he<br/>
wanted to write on his own...<br/>
Basically, I just said yes to whatever he asked when it came to writing ;)<br/>
Reading *clicked* for him at 6.5; he&#39;d been comfortable with words and their<br/>
shapes for a long time by then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705575424">I think Karl might have (or might not have) learned to read anyway by 6 but<br/>
when he was 4 he was made fun of about not being able to read by a kid he<br/>
likes and looks up to .. :( Maybe that put a damper on things. Or maybe not.<br/>
Karl is an early reader but not fluent. He also asked to write lists of all<br/>
kinds of things when he was 4 and asked me to write lists while he looked on<br/>
and so forth. Maybe he wasn&#39;t incredibly interested to get into reading<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
However he is learning... at his own pace.<br/>
