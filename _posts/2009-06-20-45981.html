<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945021494">The Family RUNning site is down and Holly and I need to leave for an  <br/>
out of town wedding soon.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was unable to view that video, and I wrote to Lee to see if it  <br/>
was anywhere else, and I have this note I was going to post.<br/>
<br/>
If someone else is willing pass this on to the person who asked  <br/>
directly to to add it to that discussion at RUN or both, I&#39;d really  <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>

I was probably to post it on YouTube in a few days....I&#39;m doing a  <br/>
bunch of health care videos there right now.<br/>
But I don&#39;t understand why she can&#39;t see it there/ I wonder if she  <br/>
needs to restart her browser.<br/>
<br/>
The question was here:<br/>
