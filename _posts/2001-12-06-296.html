<br/>
San Antonio.<br/>
<br/>
A friend just told me a gaming shop was opening up in a mall in town.  Maybe<br/>
I&#39;ll just try to hang out in there and ask some questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099673977">&lt;&lt;Hmmmm....how old are your kids?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My oldest 2 are 11 and 8, but they are really good at strategy games.<br/>
Problem is they are poor at reading directions.  So I have to figure out the<br/>
basics and then we play a sample game and the kids catch on.<br/>
<br/>
I got them some Harry Potter Quidditch cards....only problem is I can&#39;t<br/>
figure out how to play from the directions  :(<br/>

We like this game!  We found the directions a bit obtuse as well, but as you <br/>
start playing, it becomes clearer.  If you have a specific question.....?<br/>
