<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247909637">I&#39;m aiming this at Elizabeth (gotcha!) because I think she&#39;s mentioned that<br/>
her husband is a musicologist, but anyone else with info please jump in.<br/>
I&#39;m looking for books, websites, even search terms that will help me find<br/>
anecdotes about composers that I can work into articles and/or stories.  I&#39;m<br/>
thinking of things like the story behind Haydn&#39;s Farewell Symphony, or the<br/>
(possibly true) story about Bach sneaking manuscripts to copy that he wasn&#39;t<br/>
allowed to have.  I&#39;ve found some sites and books by searching on composers<br/>
+anecdotes, composers +stories, and &quot;classical music&quot; +anecdotes.  Any other<br/>
ideas?<br/>

Hi, Tia --<br/>
<br/>
Long ago, when my mom had the radio tuned into classical stations, the<br/>
announcer, Scott Beach, would do brief segments called &quot;Musicdotes&quot; and<br/>
I know that he published a book with that title.  (I suspect it is long<br/>
out of print.)<br/>
<br/>
I remember buying a copy of the book for my mother and reading just a<br/>
tiny bit of it.  I think the book led off with the story that Chopin<br/>
composed one of his works basing the notes on a pattern of freckles on<br/>
his mistress (Georges Sand, whatever her girlie name was.)<br/>
<br/>
This may be badly mangled, but I offer it up for what it&#39;s worth.  The<br/>
book would be cool, if you could find it.<br/>
<br/>
(If there wasn&#39;t nudity and implied sex in the story I doubt I would<br/>
remember it at all.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154487992">OK, here&#39;s the response from my husband:<br/>
<br/>
There are two wonderful books that go right to the heart of this request, <br/>
Victor Borge&#39;s &quot;My Favorite Intermissions&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Comedies in <br/>
Music.&quot;  The Internet still can&#39;t touch print media for such specialized <br/>
research (IMO of course).  The books are packed with anecdotes about famous <br/>
composers, some of them obscure and interesting (not just funny).<br/>
<br/>
Both the Borge books are out of print, but any large library should have at <br/>
least one of them.  Used book sites like bookfinder.com or abebooks.com will <br/>
have at least a dozen copies of each title listed at any time.  Don&#39;t be <br/>
suckered into paying $50-75 for a signed copy.  These went through several <br/>
printings and Borge must have signed hundreds of them.  She can probably find <br/>
a decent reading copy for $10, and a signed first for $25.  As a matter of <br/>
fact, I have a spare copy of &quot;My Favorite Intermissions&quot; in the eBay pile <br/>
upstairs, a first in very good condition with dj.  I&#39;d send it to her for $10 <br/>
postpaid just to avoid the hassle of listing it.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
I&#39;m wondering how many duplicate copies of how many things we have lying <br/>
around.  Our eBay pile is upstairs, so I haven&#39;t sold much of anything since <br/>
I broke my ankle.  Somehow, even with the cast off I can&#39;t get upstairs more <br/>
than once or twice a day.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you in your quest.<br/>

on the brink of trouble the last couple of days.<br/>
Thanks for the book suggestions.  I&#39;ll see if our library has them.  I came<br/>
home Friday with a couple of music anecdote books, though not ones that had<br/>
been recommended here.<br/>

Not as wonderful as playing Mahler, but I enjoyed it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A couple of years ago Mark was writing some liner notes for a Wagner piece.  <br/>
(I don&#39;t even pretend to be as literate as he is, so forgive my ignorance) He <br/>
played the &quot;kill the wabbit&quot; scene from Fantasia (?) about 300 times at high <br/>
volume - different recordings, different conductors and orchestras.  Today I <br/>
can smile about it, back then I had more sinister thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
We just had to miss our Chicago Symphony concert yesterday because of my leg. <br/>
 And my laryngitis.  We are in the gallery, front row.  Cheap seats, but nice <br/>
view.  Except that getting to them requires a really long flight down <br/>
extremely steep stairs.  There is no way I have the strength or confidence to <br/>
do that on my crutches.  Don&#39;t know why I harbored the fantasy of walking <br/>
soon after my cast was removed, but there you go.<br/>

section.<br/>
I know this because that&#39;s how I saw Fiddler on the Roof.  Maybe even without <br/>
a wheelchair they would have let you, but putting a moveable chair.  Keith <br/>
sat with me that night.  They have a little docking area with pipes around <br/>
it, where we go.  Maybe there&#39;s something like that for you.<br/>

But this Friday we&#39;re seeing Sound of Music, and the wheelchair spots were <br/>

<br/>
Good for you.  How scary to get up there and back down, though.  We could <br/>
have researched the wheelchair thing, placed a couple of calls, etc.  I think <br/>
I&#39;m going to need real therapy to get over my fear of stairs, though.  <br/>
Particularly the basement stairs, where I fell.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I WALKED!  OK, I had my crutches and it was only a couple of <br/>
steps, but Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day, right?  I put my full weight on the <br/>
left leg and moved my right leg forward slowly.  Still don&#39;t have enough calf <br/>
muscle to actually bend my knee while my foot is on the floor, but I can feel <br/>
it growing more each day.  I have my first physical therapy on Wednesday - it <br/>
took nearly a week to get the appointment.  Today I might just be able to <br/>
squeeze a shoe on.  <br/>
<br/>
The excitement never stops...<br/>

isn&#39;t somehow real to me.  It&#39;s not permanent, I think that&#39;s the problem.  I <br/>
felt strange asking about a parking pass too.  So, I never did and just went <br/>
farther on my crutches.  Of course, now that our driveway is a sheet of ice, <br/>
I&#39;m pretty much homebound.  But I&#39;ll be walking soon.<br/>
<br/>
While out an about in my wheelchair, though, I did notice that people seem to <br/>
really avoid you when you are disabled.  Maybe it&#39;s a height thing, not being <br/>
at eye level and all.  And I&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; normally, so I&#39;m used to being at eye <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share my neurosis about my broken ankle.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is my understanding that unless there is a state or local law that is<br/>
stricter than the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
What ADA requires is that the theatre make a *reasonable* accommodation. ADA<br/>
requires that new construction have 3% of the seating capacity accessible to<br/>
wheelchairs. That is 3 times the percentage of the general population that<br/>
use them. Once those spaces have been sold the theatre has gone beyond the<br/>
reasonable accommodation required by law. If the theatre has a &quot;no refund/no<br/>
exchange&quot; policy, which most do, there is no requirement that the theatre<br/>
exchange your tickets for wheelchair accessible seats. Most theatres will if<br/>
they are available, but there is nothing requiring it.<br/>
All of the theatres I know of do their best to accommodate all of their<br/>
patrons. None of them can afford to piss them off and loose future<br/>
audiences.<br/>
<br/>
Please remember, these theatres are run by people. People that want to be<br/>
friendly and helpful. Most of them bristle and become less flexible in their<br/>
accommodations when a patron approaches them demanding their entitlements. I<br/>
think it is just human nature to do so. Honey works so much better than<br/>
vinegar.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth, I&#39;m sure you know this, but it doesn&#39;t matter if your injury is<br/>
temporary or permanent, you are entitled to the parking permit and every<br/>
kind of reasonable accommodation. I encourage you to seek them out.<br/>
