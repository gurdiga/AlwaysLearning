But don&#39;t think about &quot;teaching your children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A better source than a dictionary would be the internet, anyway.   <br/>
It&#39;s a dictionary and encyclopedia and the day&#39;s news and history,  <br/>
music, art, science, humor, geography, space, paleontology,  <br/>
forensics, archeology, anthropology, auto mechanics, origami and  <br/>
architecture (among a million other things).<br/>

If you want to buy one cheap book that will help convince you of  <br/>
that, get Grover and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Museum.<br/>

hours a day. It&#39;s something that each enjoy. <br/>
The person who asked the question said she wanted one book though and <br/>
that&#39;s why I asked them which one book teaches them the most. They can <br/>
come up with a whole list of books if I asked them. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963335160">Another idea.....<br/>
 <br/>
I sat and really thought about the most important book, but instead of  books <br/>
for the kids, I came up with books which have helped ME be a better  parent.  <br/>
I thought, &quot;Which books could we not do without&quot; and I can&#39;t even  think of <br/>
one that the kids absolutely have to have, though I do think Sandra&#39;s  <br/>
suggestions of a dictionary is good...we use ours a lot.<br/>
 <br/>
Instead I thought of homeschooling books that have helped me through the  <br/>
years, parenting books,...probably one book that changed my life immensely  <br/>
(before my kids were born) was Penelope Leach&#39;s &quot;Your Baby and Child.&quot;  Had  it not <br/>
been for that book I probably would have raised my kids the &quot;old  fashioned&quot; <br/>
way....letting them cry themselves to sleep, scheduled feedings,  bottle <br/>
feeding, etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
And I&#39;d have to say being a part of the unschooling discussion list REALLY  <br/>
changed mine and my kids lives.  My only regret is that I hadn&#39;t been a  part <br/>
of it earlier in my kid&#39;s lives (those with little ones who are on this  list <br/>
and the UD list, count yourselves BLESSED!!)<br/>
 <br/>
So  maybe absolutely necessary books for our kids should instead  (or also) <br/>
be books for us, to make us better parents!<br/>

my copy for years. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve thought of buying another one just to  <br/>
see if that makes the first one appear.  (It&#39;s probably just in a  <br/>
pile of stuff that got put aside for some event and is disguised.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s never seen that book should at least borrow it from a  <br/>
library.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another, similar, about children and their families.   <br/>
Children Like Me (I think).  Not as big, but fun.  Outdated now, as  <br/>
the Gameboy will seem sadly old and small, but at the time it was the  <br/>
newest thing. I think that was one of the things the Navajo kid  <br/>
owned.  They had children from all over the world, and photographed  <br/>
them with their families, and alone, and some of their favorite  <br/>
possessions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So Melissa took an existing book and copied it onto a computer?  Alex <br/>
did that, at about age four, first with a photo caption from a National <br/>
Geographic, then with the book Ferdinand; he got tired part way through <br/>
and asked me to finish typing it.  He typed both in all capitals, which <br/>
for years he referred to as &quot;caps lock,&quot; in 48 pt. type, which he then <br/>
printed out.  After that, he could read.  I noticed with the National <br/>
Geographic caption that it was in upper and lower case italics, and <br/>
Alex painstakingly found each letter on the keyboard and then watched <br/>
the caps lock character appear on the screen.  I think he figured out <br/>
then that the letters were the same, no matter the typeface, etc.<br/>
