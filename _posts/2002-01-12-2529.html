I&#39;d subscribed to a step parents list but most of the people there are<br/>
what I would consider cruel, tough love, that kind of thing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That guy with the &quot;mostly say no&quot; list was quoted on a stepparenting site.<br/>
<br/>
We had people staying here last night, and the potential-stepmom-to-be said <br/>
some pretty cold things about the seven year old.    Their ONLY choice to <br/>
make that better is for the new female to spend lots of one-on-one time with <br/>
her, and for her to accept without resentment lots of one-on-one time with <br/>
her dad.  Otherwise, the situation will always be that a stranger took her <br/>
dad away.  There&#39;s no other position for the child if the parents bond <br/>
together and say &quot;We are a unit you will have to deal with.&quot;  Especially for <br/>
a little kid.  But even for a seventeen year old, and I speak from <br/>
experience.  My fourteen year old sister was put under the totally-foreign <br/>
authority of someone who wanted her to wear pink pantsuits (she didn&#39;t) and <br/>
tie her frizzy hair back before coming into the house (she did, so she could <br/>
eat and sleep and see her own father).  I was already at college, so the <br/>
affect on me was that I had no good place to go on the weekends or holidays <br/>
anymore.  My mom was usually at the bar, and my dad was working and the <br/>
stepmother (who had effected the sale of the house I was supposed to have <br/>
inherited without it even being discussed with me) was there, knowing little <br/>
to nothing about me and caring less. <br/>
<br/>
If a child WANTS time with the newer family member that&#39;s an incredible <br/>
opportunity that shouldn&#39;t be passed up.  She&#39;s not trying to separate the <br/>
couple as much as be recognized as a whole member of the family.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was told that the grandaughter of a good (former teacher) friend <br/>
of mine asked her stepdad to adopt her.  She&#39;s in her early 20&#39;s.  He offered <br/>
before, but she said no, hoping against hope that her dad would perk up and <br/>
pay attention to her.  And she DID have a dad, and she DID have his name, but <br/>
in retrospect, on a trip out of the country, she realized that the stepdad <br/>
was pretty great to her, and the real dad was not.  So she&#39;s changing her <br/>
name, as an adult, to her stepdad&#39;s name.  <br/>
<br/>
Whether any of that ore is helpful, I don&#39;t know, but maybe you found a <br/>
nugget of something.<br/>
