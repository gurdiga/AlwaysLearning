<div id="ygrps-yiv-85235064">When my kids ask for something and I can&#39;t afford to give it to them I tell<br/>
them so. We are very busy lately paying off bills so we can get to our<br/>
homestead and living the way we want to rather than the way my Mom wants us<br/>
to. This has been helpful to me (this forced poverty) because I am really<br/>
starting to learn the value of a dollar. NObody ever said to me when I was<br/>
growing up. We can&#39;t afford X because we need to keep money aside for Y. I<br/>
thought money was never ending. I don&#39;t remember thinking that My Dad works<br/>
to make money to buy food. Even after my parent&#39;s divorce and mom working,<br/>
it was still very abstract to me. Never taught to balance a checkbook, make<br/>
a budget, or the value of my time. As an adult, this was (and still is) a<br/>
severe handicap. I have been struggling to get over this and realized that I<br/>
need to be much more open with the kids about our money. If we can&#39;t afford<br/>
something, I let them know. I don&#39;t have the money for that now but maybe we<br/>
can wait until next week or look at yard sales or ask Grandpa for it for a<br/>
birthday present (big ticket items). When it is something that I am<br/>
philosophically opposed to (i.e. toy baby bottles for her doll is one of<br/>
mine) I remind them that they get an allowance and they just have enough<br/>
money left to buy it themselves. We are moving our new way of relating to<br/>
every member of our family into the money area now. I don&#39;t want Emily to<br/>
learn &quot;on the job&quot; the way I did - thru bounced checks, late payments,<br/>
ruined credit.<br/>
