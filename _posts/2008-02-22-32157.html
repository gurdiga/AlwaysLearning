<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375628798">Our oldest child is almost seven and is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My husband goes through various degrees of fear ...<br/>
there are certain things about unschooling that have<br/>
always appealed to him, but right now he&#39;s going<br/>
through one of his &quot;doubt periods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Today I printed and read a few articles from Sandra&#39;s<br/>
reading page to him. He liked them, but had some<br/>
questions. I told him I would write down some of his<br/>
comments and present them to you guys, and he seemed<br/>
to like that idea.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of his comments:<br/>
<br/>
*****************************************************<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sometimes you need somebody to kinda help push you<br/>
through a sticky spot [in learning and/or achieving<br/>
something], and then you appreciate it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
****************************************************<br/>
&quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>
things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>
like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>
a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>
wiser and knows how to lead you through it. <br/>
<br/>
And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>
seemingly meaningless things, like playing arpeggios,<br/>
but you trust them, because you know they can take you<br/>
somewhere you want to get to, and then later you can<br/>
look back and see how it did make sense ... like &#39;Wax<br/>
on, wax off&#39; from the Karate Kid. It may not have made<br/>
sense to him, but he did it because he knew the<br/>
teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>
get on his own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
&quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************<br/>
&quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>
but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>
for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>
It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>
would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>
all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>
Jenny<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781584128">-=-Today I printed and read a few articles from Sandra&#39;s<br/>

questions. I told him I would write down some of his<br/>
comments and present them to you guys, and he seemed<br/>
to like that idea.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We just played a trivia game that involved people reading lists of  <br/>
clues.  It&#39;s called &quot;Dumb Ass&quot; and is a new game.  Three people at  <br/>
the table were college grads.  One is a graduate of the local public  <br/>
school and is 23.  Holly is 16 and learned to read on her own.  She  <br/>
really cares about spelling and etymology.  She was discussing during  <br/>
the game whether Berlin and Burlesque might be related, and said even  <br/>
though they probably weren&#39;t, it would help her remember the name of  <br/>
Berlin.  That&#39;s fine.  Marty is 19 and learned to read on his own and  <br/>
is a classic lefty/mathish/dyslexic kind of guy, though we haven&#39;t  <br/>
talked about that with him.  (He knows he&#39;s left handed. &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
The least confident reader was the high school grad who is seven  <br/>
years older than Holly.  He was also pretty abysmal on the geography  <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>
<br/>
things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>
like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>
a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>
wiser and knows how to lead you through it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Or even with it.  They can ask for a guide when they want one.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/multipleintelligences">http://sandradodd.com/multipleintelligences</a><br/>

That might be good for him to think about.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And sometimes they make take you through some<br/>

teacher could help him get somewhere that he couldn&#39;t<br/>
get on his own.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they make you do arpeggios instead of playing real music  <br/>
and you lose all interest.  Sometimes teachers make the subject so  <br/>
distasteful or boring that the person has a lifelong aversion.   <br/>
(Okay, way  more than &quot;sometimes.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Can a child really be wise enough to guide himself?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about children &quot;guiding themselves.&quot;<br/>

Along with your husband&#39;s analogies, please suggest this:<br/>
<br/>
Swim lessons often start with proof that a person can float.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent doesn&#39;t believe in natural learning and clings to the  <br/>
teaching, he won&#39;t believe he can float.  If a parent doesn&#39;t believe  <br/>
it, the child won&#39;t believe it either.  Luckily for those families,  <br/>
though, the government offers free schools i every neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parents don&#39;t have forever to figure this out.  Halfway down this  <br/>
page is something really important:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-475956510">Hi Kim,<br/>
     I don&#39;t really understand what the difference is between what you do and what other unschoolers do.  In our family (as well as the other unschooling families we personally know), we also love to introduce new topics and offer classes/experiences to each other.  My husband and I (and the kids) are insatiably curious about almost everything and that usually spills all over each other and often leads to people learning insatiably and, like your son, stopping when interest wanes.  I&#39;m confused by your saying that your idea of unschooling is more narrow than the &#39;radical.&#39;  I too believe that there is a place for focused and guided learning if that is what the person is into.  My daughter loves to go to her art camp where there is structured, guided learning happening...is her embracing this somehow not &quot;radical&quot; unschooling, in your opinion?  When she took a basket weaving class, it was very focused and guided and she loved it...how is this not unschooling?  Okay, just<br/>
 curious about the distinctions you were making...enjoying the dialogue, as usual.<br/>
  Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-881644376">Okay, I&#39;ve obviously stepped on someone&#39;s toes. For that I apologize. <br/>
<br/>
I did in fact join recently, and have also read the archives. you&#39;ll notice that I haven&#39;t been participating while doing so. I&#39;ve been online since using the well in orange-on-black in high school, so I try to tread lightly put here. I did not realize that as a new member, I needed to be vetted in order to join in. Again I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
I had no intention to disagree with you, Sandra, in anyway; and have in fact been in agreement with your recent posts. My post was in response to some of the concerns of a poster&#39;s husband. The last of those concerns sounded familiar to me, and I thought I&#39;d post my response to it. Perhaps it&#39;d be a point of view he (or someone else) might be interested in hearing.<br/>
<br/>
I intended in no way to suggest that my son would be limited to choosing a path that I or anyone else happened to point out to him. Quite the opposite in fact; whether he chooses one of these areas, or any other as a life path is up to him entirely. My only investment is in hoping to expose him to as much as possible so that he has a myriad of paths from which to choose. I no more want him to be an expert in anything than I want him not to be. I do know however that there are certain paths that he *could* choose which would necessitate something typically considered formal guidance/training/teaching.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it sounds like &quot;bliss&quot; is a loaded word. I certainly didn&#39;t mean anything behind its surface intent. Rest assured that I won&#39;t use it again. I&#39;ll just live it, irie, and let others do their thing. <br/>
<br/>
Again please accept my apologies to you for having offended you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441235070">-=-I did not realize that as a new member, I needed to be vetted in  <br/>
order to join in. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You can join in, but you seemed to be characterizing other  <br/>
unschoolers on the list as being somehow in opposition to you, and it  <br/>
didn&#39;t seem productive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I did in fact join recently, and have also read the archives.  <br/>
you&#39;ll notice that I haven&#39;t been participating while doing so.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t notice you joined.  1500 members, 36000 old posts...  It&#39;s  <br/>
not personal.  It&#39;s not about you, or me.  It&#39;s about helping others  <br/>
on the list understand unschooling in ways that make it easier and  <br/>
more peaceful for them to do it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Quite the opposite in fact; whether he chooses one of these areas,  <br/>
or any other as a life path is up to him entirely. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect any of my children to choose a life path. I&#39;ve helped  <br/>
them  have rich lives of learning every day and I foresee no reason  <br/>
that will ever end for them.  I see them draw their schooled friends  <br/>
into their busy, happy lives.  Kids who aren&#39;t used to being playful  <br/>
and casual and funny loosen up around my kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do know however that there are certain paths that he *could*  <br/>
choose which would necessitate something typically considered formal  <br/>
guidance/training/teaching.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  No one has ever said anything else.<br/>
&quot;Preparing&quot; a young child for the possibility of choosing formal  <br/>
training ten years out isn&#39;t an unschooling help, though; it&#39;s a  <br/>
hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Finally, it sounds like &quot;bliss&quot; is a loaded word. I certainly  <br/>
didn&#39;t mean anything behind its surface intent. Rest assured that I  <br/>
won&#39;t use it again.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Use it all  you want.  I don&#39;t need rest or assurances.  You should  <br/>
be prepared for people to defend unschooling.<br/>
The discussion is all about ideas, and shouldn&#39;t be about people.    <br/>
Try to step back and talk about issues and ideas, not individuals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157583555"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So I&#39;ve decided to show him as much as I can of those<br/>
&gt; possibilities. ie &#39;This is baroque music. Would you<br/>
&gt; like to learn to play?&#39;; &#39;Mama goes to karate. Would<br/>
&gt; you like to try?&#39;; &#39;Jacob studied fossils with this<br/>
&gt; book. Wanna have a look together?&#39; That leads to<br/>
&gt; trying lessons or studying. If he enjoys, we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; continue, with the help of me or other teachers as<br/>
&gt; needed. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Unschooling aspect of this comes in what happens if the child says &quot;no&quot; <br/>
to the first question - before &quot;trying the lesson&quot;. Is he *free* to say no <br/>
before the lesson?<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like these questions turn everything into a lesson or teachable <br/>
moment. Sometimes I feel twinges of envy for those moms like Kim whose <br/>
children apparently accept their suggestions pleasantly. Jayn (8) would <br/>
absolutely reject this kind of conversation! For her it is crucial that <br/>
things can be enjoyed in the moment without any pressure to become a study <br/>
proposal. She will usually surprise me by coming back to a topic weeks or <br/>
months later with some remarks. (Jayn rarely asks questions outright - she <br/>
makes statements and then checks if she right.)<br/>
<br/>
A nonchalant &quot;This is baroque music&quot; is probably about as far as I would go. <br/>
Her answer to volunteered information, ie that she has not expressed <br/>
interest in, is usually, &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; I have learnt that I am far better <br/>
off asking her if she interested in hearing more about whatever the issue at <br/>
hand is first than getting locked into my need to share my knowledge. (Sigh, <br/>
and I like to think I&#39;m soooo darn clever.)<br/>
<br/>
I rarely suggest any type of class to Jayn, because it would take her <br/>
initiative away from her. I have offered her lessons in a couple of <br/>
situations that are outside of my experience or would benefit from a group <br/>
dynamic - including as examples: ballet, martial arts, soccer, gymnastics. <br/>
She has tried some, refused others, and said &quot;Not yet&quot; for some. What is <br/>
better for Jayn is to see a martial arts class (just to continue one <br/>
example) on tv, or through the window if we are passing a studio, or to hear <br/>
about what her friends are doing and begin her slow process towards deciding <br/>
to try it.<br/>
<br/>
With books, I tend to just leave them out. I don&#39;t ever talk about someone <br/>
&quot;studying&quot; a topic if I see one of her friends reading something, or that I <br/>
am reading myself.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn has an immensely strong drive to be the instigator and controller of <br/>
her own life. She will not be pushed from behind and she will not be pulled <br/>
along from in front. She will refuse to move *even in the direction she <br/>
wants to go*, unless she is being allowed to set the pace. She will push <br/>
herself when she is ready much more than any instructor. This is her <br/>
personality.<br/>
<br/>
The fastest way that I could remove her interest in music, karate, fossils, <br/>
languages, Cambodia, religions, math, geography, quantum physics, carpenty, <br/>
medicine or waste management would be to guide her into some lessons that I <br/>
thought were the right way for her to learn about these (or any) topics. She <br/>
rejects any imposition of structure in her learning - which incidentally <br/>
does not mean that she refuses to conform to the protocols of any class <br/>
situation she has chosen. If she finds the protocols too onerous, she leaves <br/>
the class with my blessing.<br/>
<br/>
In passing I will mention that the most of her personal solidification of <br/>
information comes in the form of making fantasy plays or art work about the <br/>
topic - eg: watched a couple of shows about mummies - made doll into mummy - <br/>
wanted to play Cleopatra - continues to look at shows/books about Egypt <br/>
intermittently. No lessons, no need to interfere with this process, no need <br/>
to assess the extent of her knowledge about mummies.  No arrival at the end <br/>
of &quot;the course&quot; either.<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, ooh. Here&#39;s another example, which is very current and ongoing. Got a <br/>
doll dressed in a kimono (a couple of years ago) - Studio Ghibli movies - <br/>
recent rediscovery of said doll - interest in other Japanese dolls (modern <br/>
clothing) and collectible dolls of &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; online - I <br/>
remembered I have the movie on dvd - discussions about kimonos, separation <br/>
of sisters, dance, geisha as artist, feminism, lack of choices, art <br/>
direction, costuming - wants to play geisha (dancing and tea parties!) - <br/>
continues to draw versions of ladies in kimonos and makeup. Other potential <br/>
topics lurking in that movie - WWII, sumo wrestling, slavery, tea <br/>
ceremonies, calligraphy - but I&#39;m not going to push them. She&#39;ll come back <br/>
to them, or not as suit her. Again no lessons, no interference, no <br/>
assessment, no conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my gosh - I just remembered her Barbie book about an investigation in a <br/>
Japanese tea house about an antique teapot! Time to get the book out again, <br/>
while the interest is still fresh.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from any kind of information pushing being utterly rejected, I have <br/>
found that my broad strewing is rarely as helpful to Jayn as more focussed <br/>
strewing connected to interests that she already has demonstrated. For <br/>
example, her greatest love is dolls of all kinds. So if I find a book, <br/>
place, magazine connected to dolls even tenuously, that is the time when I <br/>
will say, &quot;Look at this&quot; and be totally ready to back off if she say &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we recently visited the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising <br/>
exhibit of 2007 movie costumes, Jayn was far more overtly interested in the <br/>
costumes from movies she had seen, and also noticed a costume that had a <br/>
reproduction of an antique doll as part of the display. However a few days <br/>
later she surprised me with a conversation about some costumes from a <br/>
completely different movie. I will say that mostly she was more interested <br/>
in meeting up with her friend at the outing, than the location of the <br/>
outing.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that the resources available to us in a developed nation are so <br/>
wide ranging and broad, that I would never want to restrict Jayn&#39;s <br/>
explorations to what I know about. More fascinating information comes in to <br/>
our house and to her notice via the tv and internet every day than we could <br/>
ever cover through any kind of guided tours!<br/>
<br/>
Where I see my greater experience as being valuable to Jayn is not in the <br/>
area of suggesting topics for investigation, but that I have a greater <br/>
ability to research and gather resources/people on her behalf when she <br/>
expresses her interest in something. I can be a vector of knowledge for her, <br/>
rather than the definer of what might be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I have Wikipedia set as one of my home pages, and daily read the <br/>
main featured article and most of the &quot;Did you know...&quot; and &quot;On this day&quot; <br/>
intros, following some to their pages if they sound interesting.  And <br/>
sometimes there is an image that strikes me as something Jayn would like to <br/>
see, and I invite her to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that if I were accompanying the invitation to glance and my <br/>
computer with a whole lot of pressure (what she would feel as pressure) to <br/>
take it further, she would very quickly cease coming over to look.<br/>
<br/>
Truly I don&#39;t need to guide Jayn academically. I just try to keep up.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - husband&#39;s concerns - there are a couple of lists for dads. They are <br/>
generally quiet but he can certainly ask those same questions and get some <br/>
dad pov&#39;s on them. There are plenty of absolutely committed (to Unschooling <br/>
I mean) dads - my dh is one of them and he&#39;s on these lists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322513342">I have a really hard time with the wax on, wax off scene in the movie. It isn&#39;t about learning the skill as much as it is about demonstrating blind obedience. If Noriyuki Morita&#39;s character had informed Ralph Macchio&#39;s character the point of waxing his cars what would have been lost? Only the blind obedience and the demonstration that he would jump through hoops to prove his desire to learn karate. Surely it is better to make an informed choice and not to begin to feel bitter. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Sometimes you need somebody to kinda help push you<br/>
&gt; through a sticky spot [in learning and/or achieving<br/>
&gt; something], and then you appreciate it.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ****************************************************<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People who&#39;ve experienced a positive outcome from being pushed in  <br/>
some activity they enjoy are certain this is true.<br/>
<br/>
People who&#39;ve experienced a negative outcome usually don&#39;t make  <br/>
generalization about pushing being universally good or bad. They just  <br/>
decide they don&#39;t like the pusher, don&#39;t like what they were being  <br/>
pushed to do, and don&#39;t like being pushed.<br/>
<br/>
So the larger truth in the above statement is that people remember  <br/>
the positive results and forget the negative results. A not very  <br/>
scientific process!<br/>
<br/>
In the long run, it&#39;s better not to learn to depend on an outside  <br/>
source to push you past rough spots. It&#39;s far more useful for a  <br/>
lifetime to learn how to push yourself. Kids get that by having  <br/>
opportunities to discover that by pushing past rough spots, there are  <br/>
-- usually! -- rewards and a sense of accomplishment beyond the rough  <br/>
patches. And a really useful skill is being able to assess along the  <br/>
way and determine when an activity is draining more than it&#39;s  <br/>
returning (or likely to return.) Sometimes we&#39;ll guess wrong. But  <br/>
that&#39;s okay. We learn from our mistakes. And when we have the freedom  <br/>
to drop things and pick them up again, we know we can go back and  <br/>
pick something up when we feel we&#39;re ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
That said, people can *choose* to find someone who will push them,  <br/>
knowing full well that they&#39;re choosing to be pushed and can choose  <br/>
to drop the pushing any time. (Athletic coaches come to mind.) While  <br/>
choosing to have someone push you may look the same from the outside  <br/>
as someone pushing someone else, it has a totally different feel  <br/>
inside the person. And since all learning happens inside, what&#39;s  <br/>
happening inside the person is more important than what it looks like  <br/>
from outside.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;I know from my own experience that there are certain<br/>
&gt; things people are never going to be *very* good at,<br/>
&gt; like playing an instrument well, or learning how to be<br/>
&gt; a good computer programmer, without somebody who is<br/>
&gt; wiser and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true. But what we don&#39;t know is what *else* they would have  <br/>
done if they had the freedom. We *can&#39;t* know. And because we can&#39;t  <br/>
know, it&#39;s scary. If we&#39;re in a place we like, it&#39;s scary to think we  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have gotten there except by being pushed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to take fears out and examine them! Often they encourage us  <br/>
to do things to avoid worst case scenarios to make us feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a way around that fear other than face it. To also see  <br/>
the benefits of unschooling until that becomes way more important  <br/>
than the unfounded fears.<br/>
<br/>
And unschoolers *do* introduce their kids to a variety of activities.  <br/>
When the kids show an interest in something, we help them find ways  <br/>
to explore it. If they want, that can be a mentor who knows an  <br/>
instrument well or knows programming if that&#39;s where they&#39;re headed.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids *do* let us know what interests them even when it&#39;s  <br/>
outside of the things we&#39;re showing them. They may not jump directly  <br/>
to programming but they will be asking questions  about how people  <br/>
get things to do things. And it grows from there as we find ways to  <br/>
answer their questions, and find others to answer their questions  <br/>
when the need more than we can provide.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and knows how to lead you through it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the sticking points to getting unschooling. When we  <br/>
only know the success of being led through something, when we see all  <br/>
that we needed to know in order to get where we ended up, it seems  <br/>
impossible for that to have happened any other way.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest cure to that is seeing kids who have learned loads about  <br/>
something just by playing, wanting to learn it, and doing it. Kids  <br/>
learn HTML, Java and Javascript all by wanting to do stuff with it  <br/>
without a programmed process leading them from one thing to another.  <br/>
They just plunge in and learn what they need in the moment. (It&#39;s  <br/>
exactly how I learned HTML.) While the process is chaotic and pretty  <br/>
much untestable since kids are zigzagging from one bit to another,  <br/>
reaching for what they need to know in the moment without any  <br/>
apparent plan to get &quot;everything&quot;, the process is exactly the way  <br/>
they learn to speak English. And that works *way* better than sitting  <br/>
in a classroom to supposedly learn Spanish!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a lot like the process my daughter is going through  <br/>
learning guitar. She told her instructor what kind of music she liked  <br/>
and they both work together on suggesting what she could learn.  <br/>
Sometimes she picks the songs. Sometimes he does. She likes the blues  <br/>
but he had a lot more knowledge and helped her a lot on what he  <br/>
suggested she learned. Sometimes she sees someone doing something and  <br/>
tells him she&#39;d like to learn it. Sometimes she figures it out on her  <br/>
own. While he suggests and helps because he has a bigger picture of  <br/>
music, she&#39;s in the driver&#39;s seat and can decide which way to  <br/>
ultimately go.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds scary when we&#39;re used to programmed learning! What if she  <br/>
misses something? Ah, the truth is that programmed learners miss  <br/>
loads. They just don&#39;t know it! The programmed course leads them to  <br/>
believe it&#39;s everything they need. People buy into that. But when you  <br/>
walk into work that first day, you realize how much you don&#39;t know!  <br/>
And a much more useful skill is knowing that you don&#39;t know  <br/>
everything but having the confidence you can learn it when you need  <br/>
it -- rather than assuming you need someone to teach it to you :-)<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s not a perfect analogy since you need to know something to get  <br/>
the job! But with unschooling, kids are learning all along, getting  <br/>
what they need to know. It&#39;s just a different process. They get to  <br/>
the job *better* prepared because they&#39;ve had the freedom to do real  <br/>
life versions of the job rather than cramming in esoteric information  <br/>
that might suit the type of job they might want one day.)<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of learning by doing is that we naturally encounter what  <br/>
we need to know. We come across problems and learn -- as a side  <br/>
effect -- what we need to get past it. We encounter everything we  <br/>
need in real life contexts.<br/>
<br/>
Just as it was with learning English. Kids don&#39;t set out to learn  <br/>
English. They set out to get from life what they want. English is a  <br/>
tool that that use. They don&#39;t even consciously try to improve their  <br/>
tool use. They just get better at it by using it as a side effect of  <br/>
wanting something else.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, people remember the times that worked for them.<br/>
<br/>
There are far more numerous times when it doesn&#39;t work, when it turns  <br/>
someone off to something they would have enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
What turned me off to organ was learning songs that I didn&#39;t care to  <br/>
learn because there was supposedly a progression one had to go  <br/>
through. The teachers went through it and it got them where they are  <br/>
so the progression must work. Well, actually what it did was filter  <br/>
out the people that process  didn&#39;t work for!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is learning to play the guitar by playing the rock songs  <br/>
she wants to play. She&#39;s motivated to work past the tough spots  <br/>
because she wants the song. As opposed to the standard method of  <br/>
cramming in all the stuff kids will one day need to play what they  <br/>
want. Most kids never get past the cramming part. My daughter gets to  <br/>
jump right to what she wants and learns what she needs as a side  <br/>
effect because she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Schuyler about the Karate Kid. Actually I like the scene  <br/>
because I like the feeling of knowing something someone else doesn&#39;t  <br/>
and making them do things to get them to understand not only what I  <br/>
know but that I&#39;m superior.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a power trip.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s a good thing to recognize so we can avoid doing it to our  <br/>
kids because the other end of the power trip is *not* fun. The  <br/>
learner may learn something, but in the process they learn that  <br/>
having power rocks and not having power sucks. It can motivate  <br/>
someone to learn (have power) but it can also motivate people to lord  <br/>
their power over others because they were deprived of power  <br/>
themselves. (They become sensei who foist the wax on wax off power  <br/>
trip onto their students because it was done to them.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re imagining unschooling as parents stepping back and children  <br/>
learning everything on their own through their own discoveries, then no.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re imagining children having *the freedom* to explore  <br/>
according to their interests, then yes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s our job as parents to run the parts of the world we think might  <br/>
interest them into their lives. And to help them reach what they&#39;re  <br/>
trying to reach. And to get out of their way when they&#39;re engaged.<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is being on the look out for things a child might  <br/>
like. Just as you might do for your wife. If you&#39;re in a bookstore  <br/>
and see a book you&#39;re pretty sure she&#39;d like, you might buy it for  <br/>
her or at least tell her. Let her know it exists. We do that for our  <br/>
kids. But more actively since they can&#39;t be as much out in the world  <br/>
as adults can, won&#39;t be scanning lists of classes and events for  <br/>
something that sounds interesting. We use our superior knowledge of  <br/>
the world to filter out the stuff that probably won&#39;t interest them  <br/>
so they can see the stuff of potential interests.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *really* hard to see how it works when the only model someone is  <br/>
familiar with is schooled kids who are being made to learn. Schooled  <br/>
kids tend to avoid stuff that has the patina of school because they  <br/>
negatively associate those things with school. Unschooled kids don&#39;t  <br/>
have that. Shakespeare and Spongebob are all equal: something to like  <br/>
or not like today.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ******************************************************<br/>
&gt; &quot;Organic, unplanned, unexpected learning seems great,<br/>
&gt; but are these people saying that there&#39;s NEVER a place<br/>
&gt; for focused, structured, incremental learning as well?<br/>
&gt; It seems like what would maximize learning potential<br/>
&gt; would be to have the two together. Why would you throw<br/>
&gt; all structured learning to the wind?&quot;<br/>
&gt; ******************************************************<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The advantage we have is that we know kids (our own and ourselves  <br/>
too!) who have experienced forced learning and natural learning. We  <br/>
can see the difference. Those who have only experienced forced  <br/>
learning can only imagine what the effect of natural learning is by  <br/>
extrapolating from forced learning.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t work. What seems likely to happen isn&#39;t what actually happens.<br/>
<br/>
As for focused, structured, incremental ... I think you&#39;re equating  <br/>
it with forced learning. The two can be separated! My daughter has  <br/>
been taking college math classes since she was 13. She likes them. To  <br/>
her they&#39;re fun. Statistics, problem solving, algebra, pre-calculus.  <br/>
Two her father taught, all of them she and her Dad did the homework  <br/>
together in the evening. What encouraged her to keep taking classes  <br/>
was that his goal wasn&#39;t for her to learn but to have fun. As a side  <br/>
effect, she did learn. (Or at least did well on the tests which isn&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily the same thing!)<br/>
<br/>
What my husband does with our daughter is what, I think, people  <br/>
imagine the ideal of structured learning is. Two people working  <br/>
together, having fun in discovering  things through a structured  <br/>
course. But it isn&#39;t the structured course that comes from. You can&#39;t  <br/>
sit a child down with a course and expect that magic to happen. It  <br/>
comes from someone loving the material, being enthusiastic and not  <br/>
caring if the child does the material or not. The goal is to have  <br/>
fun. If it&#39;s not fun, it gets dropped for something that is fun.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about choice.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing about focused, structured, incremental learning is that  <br/>
the results are a lot easier to see. Structured education is more  <br/>
satisfying from someone *monitoring* the learning process. (It&#39;s also  <br/>
easier for educators to prove to parents, states and the school board  <br/>
that learning is taking place.) We *assume* that since we can see the  <br/>
learning and the progress that it must be superior to learning  <br/>
organically.<br/>
<br/>
Can you prove that? How would you prove it? With a test that is  <br/>
designed to test whether structured teaching has in fact resulted in  <br/>
learning?<br/>
<br/>
Can schools prove that their focused, structured, incremental process  <br/>
works? They have some kids that come out having done well on tests,  <br/>
but they also have kids who don&#39;t. They assume the process is  <br/>
responsible for the successes but without a control group how can  <br/>
they prove that claim? They can say the failures are the fault of the  <br/>
kids or family life, but, again, without a control group, how can  <br/>
they prove that claim?<br/>
<br/>
The real proof is in what unschooled kids do as adults I think. We&#39;re  <br/>
the control group. Our kids are learning and moving on in life  <br/>
without forced learning so it *can&#39;t* be the forced learning that is  <br/>
causing kids to learn in school. Fortunately we&#39;re paving the way  <br/>
with our own kids so you don&#39;t have to just trust that this is all  <br/>
some rosy glass type of deal. :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s expressed as though a proven fact. Can he prove that&#39;s true?<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest roadblocks to figuring out unschooling is that we  <br/>
only know schooled kids. People *assume* that schooled kids are just  <br/>
kids, but school changes them. People truly only know how kids are  <br/>
who&#39;ve been through the process of forced learning. People can&#39;t know  <br/>
what the behavior of natural kids are because people haven&#39;t met  <br/>
them. (Well, unschooler have! And we know they do behave differently  <br/>
than kids who are forced to learn. We know they react to life  <br/>
differently. We know they make different choices.)<br/>
<br/>
*If* someone sets school up as the yard stick to measure oneself by,  <br/>
then unschooled kids will feel inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
If someone lives life as though school doesn&#39;t exist, then kids are  <br/>
whole and happy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s scary not to have a yard stick but it&#39;s a fear that needs to be  <br/>
examined. Unschoolers know that the yardstick hold kids back because  <br/>
we can see it. Parents of schooled kids don&#39;t know that.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter hasn&#39;t been pushed into challenges and yet has always  <br/>
sought out the challenges that interested her (and avoided the ones  <br/>
that don&#39;t interest her). She isn&#39;t one to always be seeking a  <br/>
challenge. That&#39;s just not her personality, but she *does* challenge  <br/>
herself. Lack of coercion has not hindered that. And I think has  <br/>
helped her seek out her own challenges because she knows she&#39;s free  <br/>
to drop them anytime she wants. *Knowing* you can give up helps  <br/>
hugely when you&#39;re pushing yourself through because you know you&#39;re  <br/>
choosing to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you limit your vision to challeges of school you&#39;ll miss  <br/>
where she does push herself. If she was in school maybe she&#39;s sitting  <br/>
back choosing the freedom to not be pushed. But she will push herself  <br/>
when she finds things that are worth *to her* pushing. *That&#39;s* what  <br/>
you need to see. Look at when she&#39;s choosing to push herself (when  <br/>
she&#39;s ready) not when she&#39;s failing to meet your expectations of when  <br/>
she should push herself.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has pushed herself in drawing. She&#39;s pushed herself in  <br/>
running. She&#39;s done the National Novel Writing Challenge 4 times  <br/>
(write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days.) She&#39;s pushed herself past  <br/>
frustrating levels in video games.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you can see where kids are challenging *themselves* on what&#39;s  <br/>
important to them, it&#39;s going to be a lot harder to see when they&#39;re  <br/>
working hard to accomplish something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110934857">-=-Unschooled kids *do* let us know what interests them even when it&#39;s<br/>
outside of the things we&#39;re showing them. They may not jump directly<br/>
to programming but they will be asking questions about how people<br/>
get things to do things. And it grows from there as we find ways to<br/>
answer their questions, and find others to answer their questions<br/>
when the need more than we can provide.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell all this in full detail.  It would take thousands of  <br/>
words.  But a peek:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today Marty and I were standing in the kitchen talking about carnival  <br/>
games, traditional games and how they&#39;re designed to cheat people and  <br/>
how someone can be allowed to win (usually a physical manipulation of  <br/>
the mechanisms) to encourage others in.  Then we talked about the  <br/>
gambling games on NeoPets.  A slot machine game he liked has  <br/>
disappeared in the past week.  We talked about how the programming of  <br/>
those games isn&#39;t random, but winning is way more likely than in real  <br/>
games (especially when real games can make winning even LESS likely  <br/>
than random).<br/>
<br/>
The mail came.  I had forgotten I had ordered some little tricks and  <br/>
toys from a site I came across looking for something or other.   <br/>
Wonder Workshops, Retro Toys and Science Amusements.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wonderworks.com">http://wonderworks.com</a><br/>
<br/>
So we played with those things, which were also physically  <br/>
manipulated trick-things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That all &quot;just happened,&quot; but it happened because we&#39;ve been building  <br/>
up to it with our whole lives and our whole style of communicating  <br/>
and living together in a constant state of open curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I was thinking of the carnival games is that the other day  <br/>
Holly and I talked about suicide and how many people I&#39;ve known who  <br/>
committed suicide.  One was a guy named Nick who was in the SCA and  <br/>
used to work at a carnival and knew which of the games were  <br/>
Renaissance-old or older, and how to construct and operate them.  I  <br/>
hadn&#39;t thought of Nick for a long time but Holly&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s ex  <br/>
girlfriend&#39;s husband had killed himself in Arizona.  Nick, too, was  <br/>
from Arizona (I didn&#39;t mention that to them, but I&#39;m telling you now.)<br/>
<br/>
Once you start looking for connections and welcoming them, it creates  <br/>
a kind of flow that builds and grows.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the opportunity to explore this a bit more,<br/>
and for the fodder to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the delay in continuing this conversation.<br/>
Pesky work got in the way ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;d say that the distinction is that my<br/>
child&#39;s life and education are not *completely*<br/>
child-led. It&#39;s a matter of degree, perhaps? True we<br/>
live without curriculum, grades, timelines, rules for<br/>
every aspect of life, etc. But we have rules to<br/>
*guide* his behavior (mainly around civility and<br/>
respect for others, their time, and their<br/>
belongings---ie you put used tools back where they<br/>
belong, or you lose the privilege of using them).<br/>
Educationally, there are a myriad of things that I<br/>
expose him to, without waiting for him to express an<br/>
interest. I also have decided to require<br/>
full-participation in the activities he chooses to<br/>
continue: ie if he wants to take musical instrument<br/>
lessons, I make practice requisite, etc. If he wants<br/>
to take a course, he has to complete assignments.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t personally think that the differences<br/>
between radical unschoolers and myself are that great,<br/>
certainly not nearly as great as those between the<br/>
unschooling community and the &#39;school-at-home&#39;<br/>
community. But there are those who would disagree with<br/>
me strongly on that point; and in my original post, I<br/>
was trying to concede said differences at the outset.<br/>
<br/>
It was my attempt at humility, and it seems to have<br/>
fallen flat (in addition to ruffling the feathers of<br/>
the list-owner), lol!<br/>

vast majority of posts/responses which focused on the<br/>
personal. <br/>
<br/>
There is a significant difference between personal<br/>
observation and response to it, and personal attack. I<br/>
genuinely try to refrain from the latter. I&#39;m<br/>
especially aware that without the benefit of face to<br/>
face contact, what we write can be taken in a manner<br/>
which feels attacking to the reader. I try to keep a<br/>
very neutral and also passive voice to my posts, as in<br/>
my experience, it makes it easier for readers to take<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290103182">Awesome question, Robyn! I think that you point to the<br/>
spot where many feel that radical unschooling and<br/>
other approaches diverge. You might have already<br/>
noticed that I have a bit of a problem with short,<br/>
simple answers, lol. Is he free to say &quot;no&quot;? I guess<br/>
I&#39;ll say: sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Before signing up for lessons, classes, yes, he does<br/>
have the right to refuse. He simply says, &#39;not<br/>
interested&#39; or something to that effect. He does not<br/>
yet have the choice to participate in family<br/>
activities at this point. If the family is traveling<br/>
abroad, he has to come also. I think that this is a<br/>
good opportunity for him, something we do often. Will<br/>
it change when he&#39;s older? Maybe. However.....(isn&#39;t<br/>
there always a &#39;but&#39;) once he does choose to try an<br/>
activity, I do have certain requirements: that he<br/>
participate fully (as required by the given activity),<br/>
that he practice, for example, if he chooses to take<br/>
lessons, that he do the homework and testing required<br/>
by any course that he chooses to take. This isn&#39;t<br/>
technically free, really. Certainly not in the way<br/>
others whom I&#39;ve read or with whom I&#39;ve spoken<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049208283">Kim, this is meant gently. I&#39;m not sure what your point is. This list  <br/>
is for people to talk about unschooling and help other understand  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas you&#39;re bringing here won&#39;t help people understand  <br/>
unschooling. They will though draw list members to pull them out and  <br/>
examine them under the light of unschooling to help show how they  <br/>
won&#39;t build relationships.<br/>
<br/>
The responses will likely help others, but it&#39;s likely to drive you  <br/>
bonkers since it will seem like we&#39;re picking on you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I&#39;d say that the distinction is that my<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s life and education are not *completely*<br/>
&gt; child-led.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling isn&#39;t child led. Though sometimes it looks and gets  <br/>
described that way!<br/>
<br/>
We run the parts of the world we think might interest them through  <br/>
their lives, give them access to new ideas and interests. We help  <br/>
them explore what interests them.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s interests don&#39;t lead my life, but they do inspire me to  <br/>
notice things that he might be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But we have rules to<br/>
&gt; *guide* his behavior (mainly around civility and<br/>
&gt; respect for others, their time, and their<br/>
&gt; belongings---ie you put used tools back where they<br/>
&gt; belong, or you lose the privilege of using them).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are more respectful ways to help a child be careful with tools  <br/>
than punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment is more about doing something out of fear. If you create a  <br/>
relationship where he fears punishment for something he&#39;s done or not  <br/>
done, it&#39;s likely he won&#39;t come to you when he has a problem. He&#39;ll  <br/>
go to someone else who won&#39;t punish him.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you want?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Educationally, there are a myriad of things that I<br/>
&gt; expose him to, without waiting for him to express an<br/>
&gt; interest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my daughter&#39;s life I&#39;ve introduced many things I think she might  <br/>
be interested in. And though she learns by living life, what I  <br/>
introduce is potential new interests, not something that is labeled  <br/>
for education.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have decided to require<br/>
&gt; full-participation in the activities he chooses to<br/>
&gt; continue: ie if he wants to take musical instrument<br/>
&gt; lessons, I make practice requisite, etc. If he wants<br/>
&gt; to take a course, he has to complete assignments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dictating how someone explores can make them decide not to explore.  <br/>
If I knew I was trapped in a class that turned out differently than I  <br/>
had hoped, I&#39;d be gun-shy about taking more classes.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal is to train kids to stick with what they choose, you&#39;ve  <br/>
at least sent the message that that value is important to you.  <br/>
Whether he learns it or not is iffy. Often when we&#39;re trying to teach  <br/>
one lesson, another gets learned. He can learn that it&#39;s better to be  <br/>
powerful than not powerful so that you can be the one telling people  <br/>
what to do and how to do it. He can learn that his feelings aren&#39;t as  <br/>
important as your values. He can learn that sticking with something  <br/>
is more important than his thoughts that he&#39;d be better served by  <br/>
quitting. Among other things.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make my daughter stick with what she tries. And yet when  <br/>
she&#39;s in a situation where people depend on her, she&#39;s dependable.  <br/>
She&#39;s on the cross country team and understands the team depends on her.<br/>
<br/>
When we set up a class as if it were practice for sticking with  <br/>
something, it isn&#39;t the same situation at all. KIds don&#39;t learn to  <br/>
stick with something. They learn that mom will make them. They will  <br/>
learn that they&#39;ll feel guilty if they quit.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter chooses to support her team, she chooses to call her  <br/>
guitar teacher if she can&#39;t make a lesson because she&#39;s grow up in an  <br/>
environment where she&#39;s treated with respect. So she treats others  <br/>
with respect. She doesn&#39;t just go through the motions of sticking  <br/>
with something. She can see when she&#39;s important to something and  <br/>
when she&#39;s not. She can see when something is taking more than it&#39;s  <br/>
returning and can decide to quit. That&#39;s respect *and* empowerment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I don&#39;t personally think that the differences<br/>
&gt; between radical unschoolers and myself are that great,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps on the surface the difference may not be apparent. But your  <br/>
way of doing things will get in the way of trusting children and  <br/>
building relationships that we try to help people with.<br/>

understand how unschoolers differ from what you do.<br/>
<br/>
But if you say something counter to unschooling here, the response  <br/>
you&#39;ll get is how that won&#39;t be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Why would you assume we wouldn&#39;t let kids know what a class might be  <br/>
like?<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;ve written above sounds way too formal. I wouldn&#39;t introduce  <br/>
my daughter to what&#39;s expected of her. I would tell her what the  <br/>
class might be like. I would let her try the class. If it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
suiting her needs, she could quit. And she didn&#39;t start out with  <br/>
formal classes. She&#39;s taken more relaxed classes so she already knows  <br/>
a lot of the structure already.<br/>
<br/>
While there might be &quot;expectations&quot; I wouldn&#39;t see those as things  <br/>
she must do so much as things that will be part of the class, if you  <br/>
can see the distinction. Choosing not to do them will be part of  <br/>
choosing not to continue the class.<br/>

held up for examination.<br/>

child is 6 and is afraid of the dark when someone is asking about  <br/>
bedtimes. We share what the principles of unschooling and respectful  <br/>
parenting look like in our lives to help people understand the  <br/>
principles and the philosophy better.<br/>

Living your life and making decisions about what decisions you will  <br/>

&quot;Introduce&quot; meaning requiring assignments and practice and tests?<br/>

That&#39;s not conducive to natural learning.  It won&#39;t kill it dead to  <br/>

for a couple of years there at the end.  He chose it, every time he  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s just me&quot; is one of those &quot;no offense&quot; kind of phrases,  <br/>

<br/>
Of course.  We are talking about the real experiences of real  <br/>
unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t take that personally, and don&#39;t make your criticisms personal.<br/>
<br/>
Once the ideas are out there, the ideas are to be discussed as  <br/>
ideas.  Joyce described this very well once:<br/>
<br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Joyce<br/>
================================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told some DEEPLY personal stories and will continue to do so,  <br/>
but I&#39;m not telling them to get sympathy or approval or friends.   <br/>
When I question other people&#39;s assertions, it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t  <br/>
like the other person or I&#39;m trying to make an enemy.  Some people  <br/>
can&#39;t tell the difference between opinions and the depths of their  <br/>
souls.  Try to stay with the ideas as ideas, as tools, as clues, and   <br/>
useful pieces of a big puzzle about optimizing  natural learning in  <br/>
your kids&#39; lives.<br/>

She told me of her son, &quot;I don&#39;t care what books Dane reads, but if  <br/>
he starts a book he has to finish it.&quot;<br/>
