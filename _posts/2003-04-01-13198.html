<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116640716">I&#39;ve been reading this list for the last month and<br/>
have enjoyed reading about the day to day life of<br/>
unschoolers that are older.  My son is 3 and i am<br/>
planning on keeping him home.  Unschooling is very<br/>
appealing to me.   My son loves to look at books and<br/>
go to the library.  He&#39;s retelling stories and loves<br/>
to talk about letters.  I was wondering if you would<br/>
share with me how old your kids were when they started<br/>
reading and what it looked like. As a former school<br/>
teacher (Spanish k-12) I know my biggest challenge<br/>
will be to just chill out and follow their lead.  <br/>

played a lot of pretend games, played rhyming games, went to theater, <br/>
watched movies and tv, listened to books and stories on tape,sang a LOT <br/>
of songs, etc. None had any formal instruction at any time prior to <br/>
beginning to read.<br/>
<br/>
  - #1 began reading fluently at 4 1/2.<br/>

him.  He still doesn&#39;t like to read.  But he knows and does lots, is a nice<br/>
person, and will have no trouble supporting himself when the time comes<br/>
(based on his work history so far - he&#39;s 15).  Doing it over, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
expect him to read until he was 20.  That way he could have surprised me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353995113">My kids are young and very interested in reading. My 5 year old reads <br/>
the headlines in his train magazines, and occasional pages in his <br/>
chapter books, and the three year old picks out words. They are both <br/>
simply very interested in books and words. We really haven&#39;t used any <br/>
technique with them except making words accessible and spending every <br/>
free minute reading ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I cringed when the 3 yo picked out a toy and spelled it out for me and <br/>
my friends grabbed her kindergartener and SHAMED him with &quot;SHE&#39;s THREE <br/>
and SHE knows all those letters DO YOU?! YOU really need to...&quot; I said <br/>
please don&#39;t do that--she&#39;s just interested in words and letter and <br/>
she&#39;s not, that&#39;s all. And then she sat down with the game looking and <br/>
pointing to letters and I could hear her quietly sounding out <br/>
&quot;Candy...land....candy....land&quot; while the poor little guy went back to <br/>
his equally important playing.<br/>
<br/>
Not that that story relates to the question or the questioner, just that <br/>
it bothered me.<br/>

I have a dd that has taught herself to read at age five, and a ds that is <br/>
just starting to sound words out at 9.5.<br/>
My oldest ds, Trevor, learned to read at sixish, under duress. Not the best <br/>
way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Jared (9.5 y.o) is very excited this week because he&#39;s figuring out words <br/>
from Phantasy Star Online. It&#39;s coming easier to him than ever before. His <br/>
eyes were all lit up and he said, &quot;when you tried to show me it was boring <br/>
Mom, but I figured out I can do something I like (playing video games) AND <br/>
learn how to read.&quot;<br/>
Cool. Just wait and have fun together. Reading comes when it&#39;s meant to.<br/>

Most of the stories so far haven&#39;t been later readers besides Lars. :-)<br/>
    I know this may sound strange but hey, I am. LOL! When did Jared get his<br/>
front teeth in? I have heard of a theory...Ds still has quite a way before<br/>
both top front teeth will be in. ;-)<br/>

with a golf club last year when he turned 7. None of them were loose. But then, he was<br/>
already reading.<br/>
In a way, its a pity he was already reading cos it would have been interesting to see if<br/>
having his teeth knocked out led too reading......sort of an experiment ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364216081">I&#39;ve also read there is a whole line of connection from when infants get<br/>
teeth to getting adult teeth and then to when they reach puberty. So for a<br/>

earlier. So it sounds reasonable that these things are also connected to<br/>
other aspects of development.<br/>

or two after she turned 4 months, lost her first tooth at 3, almost 4,<br/>
and started getting breast development at 7... she turned 10 in January<br/>
and is over 5 feet tall... no periods yet, but we&#39;re prepared.<br/>
<br/>

that... she&#39;s just destined to be this way, I think. <br/>
<br/>
And I never know when to say she started reading fluently - she did have<br/>
a year of kindergarten that screwed her up in many ways, and reading was<br/>
one. At 5 1/2 she read a lot of things, at 6 1/2 she read nothing, and at<br/>
7 1/2 she read everything.<br/>
<br/>
At 10 1/6 she reads very little, however. But she sings a lot :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819845310">I think the only thing I caution is that each child is different  With <br/>
Lexie, when she bit, I yelled and put her down for 2-3 seconds and then <br/>
picked her up again.  She realized that she didn&#39;t want me to put her <br/>
down and stopped.  I also said &quot;no teeth&quot; which she used as a toddler to <br/>
remind herself not to use her teeth when nursing.<br/>
<br/>
With Janene the first time she gummed (but with a tooth coming through) <br/>
I yelled and put her down and she didn&#39;t nurse for 13 days.  She was <br/>
young, no solids yet, a low weight baby who was a premie and who didn&#39;t <br/>
have any other source of nutrition so not nursing for almost 2 weeks was <br/>
not good.  She wouldn&#39;t take a bottle, or take milk in a spoon, syringe, <br/>
or any other container.  During that time I was able to nurse her if she <br/>
was asleep but it was a constant battle.  It was even worse that I knew <br/>
I had caused this nursing strike by my yell and I felt that she was <br/>
afraid to hurt me again.  She&#39;s a very sensitive child.  Finally (and I <br/>
know this sounds strange) I had a long talk with her, told her I forgave <br/>
her for biting me, and that it was very important that she nurse again <br/>
and that it was OK if she bit me again and that we would just learn how <br/>
not to bite together.  She latched right on and never had another bit of <br/>
trouble (not nursing) although she did bit me a few more times.  But <br/>
with her I would just gently say &quot; no teeth, please.&quot; and as a toddler <br/>
she too would, when going to latch on, say right before &quot;no teeth&quot; to <br/>
remind herself.  I&#39;ve known other moms with very high need and sensitive <br/>
babies who the automatic yell caused more problems then they fixed, <br/>
often with a nursing strike.  <br/>
<br/>
I should say that both girls bit so hard the first time that I have a <br/>
scar, one on each nipple, one for each child.  But both of them went on <br/>
to nurse much longer than is average for our society--well anything <br/>
longer than six weeks is longer in this society,but they were well past <br/>
toddlerhood.<br/>

&gt; He just kept munching down and chewing with a vengence and it surprised me<br/>
&gt; as I hadn&#39;t expected it quite so early yet. He was funny though as <br/>
&gt; after my<br/>
&gt; initial yell and removal of his grip, when he resumed nursing he kept<br/>
&gt; staring at me and then &quot;biting&quot; while keeping eye contact and then<br/>
&gt; grinning. I had to work hard not to smile at him as he certainly is <br/>
&gt; turning<br/>
&gt; out to be quite a little character!<br/>
