<div id="ygrps-yiv-829273243">A song by the Animals has come to mind, partly because it&#39;s been a  <br/>
kind of 60&#39;s revival around here, and partly because Holly has a  <br/>
serious boyfriend--a good one--and  he has an Animals song on his  <br/>
playlist (not the one I quoted in the subject line).  I asked her a  <br/>
few days ago whether he likes 60&#39;s music, and she shrugged and  <br/>
thought and said &quot;some...&quot; and then I looked at his Project Playlist  <br/>
and it has several good 60&#39;s things, mostly in reference to his love  <br/>
of Holly.  Pretty sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I had an e-mail to go look at a blogpost.  I did.  I found this in  <br/>
the comments, by someone I don&#39;t know and isn&#39;t on this list, so this  <br/>
is like third hand stranger quote, but I thought of something  <br/>
potentially new (to me) and important:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;if I let the kids do what they wanted, they would play computer  <br/>
games or watch tv all day&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has been pointed out before that schoolkids watch TV as private  <br/>
recovery time from having been powerless and put-upon all day.  It   <br/>
has also been pointed out that if parents don&#39;t have anything more  <br/>
alluring and exciting to offer, they should let their kids do the  <br/>
most alluring and exciting thing (which might be video games or TV).   <br/>
Honestly, if I&#39;m not providing Holly with an exciting afternoon,  <br/>
maybe re-runs on FOX TV can!<br/>
<br/>
The phrase &quot;if I let the kids do what they wanted&quot; is the negative  <br/>
image of &quot;I don&#39;t let the kids do what they want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Going through my page on such dire predictions<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a>    (which is &quot;If I let&quot; and not &quot;I  <br/>
filet,&quot; for those of you who are thinking sharp knives and fish),   <br/>
here are some of the other statements clearly seen in the reflection  <br/>
of the glass each parent freely chose to share with the world:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t let him/them.  1111<br/>
My boys are not allowed to self-direct (or they would be reading  <br/>
Hardy Boys!)<br/>
I don&#39;t let him.<br/>
She is not left to herself to be inspired (or she would read all day!!)<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t have his way.<br/>
We drag his nose away from things.<br/>
They&#39;re not allowed to.<br/>
I don&#39;t leave him to his own plans.<br/>
I don&#39;t let my kids hang out.<br/>
I won&#39;t try that.<br/>
We don&#39;t allow them to.<br/>
I say that&#39;s enough--get outside and play, now.<br/>
We make him once in a while.<br/>
My boys are lazy (that&#39;s a direct quote--same in the image as the  <br/>
reflection; bummer)<br/>
I don&#39;t allow.<br/>
I don&#39;t leave him to his own devices.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have his choice.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have his way.<br/>
We make him stop.<br/>
I limit it.<br/>
They&#39;re not allowed to.<br/>
<br/>
Friends (say I, from my soapbox) THAT is exactly WHY some children  <br/>
would love nothing more than to face a screen all day and never turn  <br/>
around, because when they do turn around (or way before, it seems)  <br/>
someone is making them, telling them, insulting them, NOT allowing,  <br/>
giving, leaving, letting.<br/>
<br/>
If a child feels powerless he will be needy of power.<br/>
If a child feels limited,  he will be needy of freedom.<br/>
If a child is never left alone and never left to choose, he will need  <br/>
privacy and choices.<br/>
<br/>
First give them all those things.  THEN you will see natural learning  <br/>
and good relationships.<br/>
