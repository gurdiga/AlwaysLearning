<div id="ygrps-yiv-716126671">My world seemed a little smaller this last week. My husband happens <br/>
to be a drug & alcohol abuse counselor, a goal he has worked very hard <br/>
to achieve and hopes one day to co-own a clinic. He just happened to <br/>
be at a conference this last week where Kathleen Crowley was giving a <br/>
session about Procovery and selling the book she wrote about it. My <br/>
husband perked up when she mentioned Sandra Dodd&#39;s name and he <br/>
informed her that we were unschoolers and after talking with Crowley <br/>
found out that she is an unschooling mother of 2 grown girls and that <br/>
she had used a slightly altered version of Sandra Dodd&#39;s certificate <br/>
of empowerment in her work, with Sandra&#39;s permission of course. So I <br/>
thought I would share that and to say a thank you to Sandra for <br/>
helping those recovering from addiction as well as all the work you do <br/>
in spreading the ideas of unschooling. Barbara<br/>
The book can be found at:<br/>

She credits me right on there.<br/>

I thought it was so cool that she found a powerful use for that.<br/>

 <br/>
It was written for a local New Mexico conference nine years ago (Kirby was  <br/>
nine, I think; maybe it was ten years), and I wrote it and put it out on AOL <br/>
for  the other homeschooling moms to help me polish.<br/>
 <br/>
Once in those days, too, some cranky anti-radical-unschoolers wrote a  parody <br/>
of it, sort of, and if anyone kept a copy of that I&#39;d love to have  it.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t save it at the time thinking it would always be around.   It was about <br/>
their right to teach their children and decide things for  them.  Kinda <br/>
senseless, given the prevailing messages of the culture we  live in.<br/>
