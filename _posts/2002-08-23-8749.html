<div id="ygrps-yiv-416295194">Pam, last year you posted (in answer to a question of mine) how you think <br/>
algebra is a bad idea for kids under 13 or 14. At the time it was my husband <br/>
wanting our son to get to algebra way early, but thankfully he backed off <br/>
from that, partly because of what you said. However, just the other day a <br/>
friend of mine asked what I thought about her son doing algebra this year. <br/>
He&#39;s ten, a very bright, happy and funny boy. This is their first year <br/>
homeschooling and they&#39;re not unschoolers. The mom is really wanting to know <br/>
if algebra is wrong for her son, though he wants it. He has already finished <br/>
all the Saxon math books up to the point of algebra and wants to go on to <br/>
that. I had a vague memory of what you said then and looked it up in the <br/>
archives. Here&#39;s the quote from you: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Oh dear. I don&#39;t have time right now, or I&#39;d go into a long rant about how <br/>
 </span></blockquote>dangerous it is to push kids into algebra before they are 13 or 14 or 15 at <br/>
least. It is worse than counterproductive.<br/>
<br/>
There is &quot;algebraic thinking&quot; - that is fine -- kids do it pretty naturally <br/>
anyway and it can be really satisfying and fun -- and there are ways for <br/>
parents who aren&#39;t skilled in this area to encourage it in their children, <br/>
but that is VERY different than formal algebra studied in a systematic, <br/>
standard way. I have super strong opinions that that is a major mistake to <br/>
start early. I&#39;d try to find other mathematical things to do even for a kid <br/>
who was WANTING to study algebra -- there are so MANY other areas to explore <br/>
that are so much more appropriate and that a younger kid will get so much <br/>
more out of. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you elaborate a little on that? Explain your super stong opinions more? <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
