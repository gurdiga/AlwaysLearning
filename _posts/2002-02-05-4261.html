get in high school courses. The college I went to began right in with<br/>
Calculus. The only lower level courses offered were over the summer before<br/>
freshman year for promising kids from bad schools.<br/>

<br/>
There are things you can strew her path with of course.<br/>
<br/>
Theoni Pappas has written a lot of math books, like the Joy of Mathematics.<br/>
If you go to the Joy of Mathematics page at Amazon, there are more of her<br/>
books and lists of recommendations. She has a book specifically for kids<br/>
(Math for Kids & other people too) and that should have links too.<br/>
<br/>
Games Magazine and books<br/>
<br/>
Books of logic puzzles<br/>
<br/>
And I could come up with more later.<br/>

were terrific too!<br/>

Thanks, but there&#39;s no need for an apology to me. I wasn&#39;t the <br/>
least bit offended by it. If anything I thought, there&#39;s still hope for <br/>
me too &lt;g&gt;. I&#39;m not super lonely or anything like that. I just feel <br/>

that to offend me or cause hurt feelings &lt;gg&gt;.<br/>

that popped up reasonably close to the top on Google. It seems like they<br/>
want to be quiet about their existence, though they&#39;ve been around for<br/>
years.)<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve put out books. They used to publish a Games Magazine Junior, but I<br/>
guess not any more, but the book they published is still available:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.half.com">http://www.half.com</a> if that one is missing half its pages or something ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some links to other books too.<br/>
<br/>
I like Omni Games by Scott Morris but that&#39;s out of print. (There are others<br/>
by him too.) (Half.com might have it.) (Omni and Games are both for adults<br/>
so they may be on the challenging side. So, maybe get them for yourself :-)<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s a nifty book for kids by Herbert Kohl about topology (of all<br/>
things ;-) but he says it&#39;s about patterns. (Which, of course, it is.) It&#39;s<br/>
called Inside, Outside, Loops and Lines. (And not a single number in it :-)<br/>
(That one isn&#39;t even listed at Amazon though it&#39;s only from 1995.)<br/>
<br/>
The Number Devil is a great kids novel about math :-) Really! It&#39;s not only<br/>
funny but covers an amazing number of concepts without being too obviously<br/>
about math.<br/>
<br/>
At some point you may want to look into Harold Jacobs&#39; texts, especially his<br/>
Mathematical Endeavors. Check you library first to see if it might be<br/>
interesting for you daughter since it&#39;s textbook pricy.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m being very bookish today so I&#39;ll suggest that you absolutely must<br/>
have pattern blocks. :-)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m so confident that my kids will be fine.  I was terrified of <br/>
math by college, and took a &quot;math for non majors&quot; that did math in English, <br/>
and that I really loved.  It didn&#39;t take off the fright, but it did show me <br/>
what math was good for, which my teachers in school had failed to do (even <br/>
though I&#39;d ask them straight out).  <br/>
<br/>
And all around me were other kids as lost as I was, but who majored in <br/>
sciences and just started taking math and DID it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been around when Keith helped friends of ours with calculus and trig.  <br/>
It was totally like a foreign language to me, and so I just brought food and <br/>
drinks &lt;g&gt;, but what I did see clearly was that Keith liked it and thought it <br/>
was cool, and they were just afraid and had never thought &quot;cool.&quot;<br/>

They have specials, too--annuals, or &quot;best of&quot; or whatever, that you buy <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886061779">Yes, Joyce is right that some colleges start with<br/>
higher level math.  I guess if she is not ready to<br/>
enter at that level, than she should not consider<br/>
those colleges until she is ready.  <br/>
<br/>
At the very least, when the student is college<br/>
shopping, she can take Jr College course, community<br/>
extension courses, or other source courses in what she<br/>
might want to brush up on.  <br/>
<br/>
As for strewing her path now, I think that Puzzlemania<br/>
(by the Highlights folks) might be a good subscription<br/>
to invest in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639237311">We used to subscribe to Puzzlemania a few years ago and both girls liked it.  I stopped getting it when they stopped doing the puzzles.  Allison, 12 yo dd, kept all the magazines and has recently started doing them again.  I&#39;m starting to see a pattern here. <br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Math for College<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Joyce is right that some colleges start with<br/>
higher level math.  I guess if she is not ready to<br/>
enter at that level, than she should not consider<br/>
those colleges until she is ready.  <br/>
<br/>
At the very least, when the student is college<br/>
shopping, she can take Jr College course, community<br/>
extension courses, or other source courses in what she<br/>
might want to brush up on.  <br/>
<br/>
As for strewing her path now, I think that Puzzlemania<br/>
(by the Highlights folks) might be a good subscription<br/>
to invest in.<br/>

not tactless at all. I thought you were saying that you had once been<br/>
single, too (between marriages), and then had found someone, and that<br/>
could happen for Meghan and me, too. Which is cool.<br/>
<br/>
So, *I* don&#39;t think you have anything to be sorry for, and if I totally<br/>
misinterpreted you don&#39;t have to say anything. ;-)<br/>

time she had them out of the box! She also makes some pretty <br/>
