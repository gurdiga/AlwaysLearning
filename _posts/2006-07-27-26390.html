<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623471653">Our situation is quite unique. My husband and I, both in our thirties - <br/>
have decided to take our three children ages 13, 15 and 7 on the road. <br/>
We want the world to be our classroom. My son has Bi-Polar Disorder. <br/>
Because of his condition and the tremendous amount of problems at <br/>
school, the bulling, teachers that didn&#39;t understand -or care, we <br/>
decided to begin home schooling last year. The experience has been so <br/>
successful and rewarding, we&#39;ve decided to home school our other two <br/>
children as well and we&#39;re eagerly anticipating the many educational <br/>
experiences to come while on the road... <br/>
I have just recently heard of un schooling and the idea intrigue&#39;s me. <br/>
I would love to hear more on the subject. If anyone has any books on <br/>
the topic that they are not in need of any longer, I would be <br/>
interested in purchasing your used copies. I would buy some new, but we <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533155526">Hi Heather,<br/>
<br/>
I too would go the public library option, well at least until you start your<br/>
road trip.  How wonderful, I am dreadfully envious, that was one of my home<br/>
ed fantasies too.  However, our circumstances prevent us from taking off at<br/>
the moment, keep it in my dream folder!!!<br/>
<br/>
Some authors - Wendy Priesnitz, John Taylor Gatto, Alfie Kohn, Mary Griffith<br/>
<br/>
For sites - type something like unschooling, child led learning,<br/>
deschooling, natural learning and let the search engine show you an amazing<br/>
array of interesting sites.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few to start with:-<br/>
<br/>
www.unschooling.info/collectedposts.htm<br/>
<br/>
connections.organiclearning.org<br/>
<br/>
www.lifemedia.ca/wendy/blog.html<br/>
<br/>
www.besthomeschooling.org/articles/linda_dobson_gems<br/>
<br/>
www.spinninglobe.net/homed.htm<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling the Teen Years by Cafi Cohen ISBN 0-7615-2093-7 is a good book<br/>
for natural learning ideas for older children.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it all, perhaps you could email this group occasionally with<br/>
some travel tales?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844574593"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;have decided to take our three children ages 13, 15 and 7 on the road.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What did the kids think about the idea?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My son has Bi-Polar Disorder.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kinds of needs does he have that might need special thought before<br/>
embarking on this journey? How about for your other two? We&#39;ve found that<br/>
prevention of irritants and prethinking what triggers our guy with special<br/>
issues helps us to put together a more gratifying trip for everyone. For<br/>
that matter, thinking about each person individually in the family and what<br/>
they like and don&#39;t like is very helpful in planning a great trip. It may<br/>
not look anything at all like it would have if the parents just proceeded<br/>
without everyone&#39;s inclusion of ideas, desires and input.<br/>
<br/>
We just went on a road trip recently and things were MUCH different than<br/>
they would have been if I planned the trip on my own. For instance, we took<br/>
two vehicles...a mini-van with a TV and dvd player and dh&#39;s 4 door sedan<br/>
with a good sound system. There were 7 of us on the trip, and the mini-van<br/>
fit 8 plus storage, so we could have done that. But two of the kids had the<br/>
idea that it would potentially be hell at times with all our different<br/>
personalities and needs trying to come to consensus on  whether to watch TV<br/>
or sing or listen to music, etc. Two of our family members are kind of &quot;high<br/>
need&quot;, maybe similar to your son. What a world of difference it made to have<br/>
a choice of two places to ride. And the extra space. And the many different<br/>
variations of different people together. I would have just planned on the<br/>
one van, gas prices and all, and that was indeed part of the picture. But we<br/>
weighed it all out and dh and I figured out a way to do it. And it was a<br/>
great trip.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably not feasible for what you guys are doing, but I just bring<br/>
it up as an example of how flexibility, including everyone&#39;s ideas, and<br/>
really thinking about each person going and their needs, can really make it<br/>
a great trip.<br/>
<br/>
We also agreed to stop when ANYONE asked. This alleviated stress<br/>
immediately...dh and I didn&#39;t realize that, because of previous trips,<br/>
people now hesitated to ask to stop for the bathroom or whatever because of<br/>
adult or sibling reaction because we had stopped not too long before. Doh!<br/>
There was a visible relaxation when we were talking about this as people<br/>
were listened to. And it worked well! No one batted an eyelash when someone<br/>
asked to stop no matter how recently we had already stopped. And it didn&#39;t<br/>
happen too often either. Happiness in the vehicle is a pretty dang awesome<br/>
gift on a road trip!<br/>
<br/>
So my point is that in unschooling, even doing something that seems so<br/>
wonderful and adventurous as hitting the road still needs thoughtful<br/>
planning and inclusion of everyone&#39;s ideas in the process. And parents<br/>
taking the time to think about what some pitfalls may be from knowing their<br/>
children, and working to avoid them, is very helpful as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and we&#39;re eagerly anticipating the many educational<br/>
&gt;&gt;experiences to come while on the road...&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would suggest subtracting the word &quot;educational&quot; from the sentence above,<br/>
and see how it feels. Unschooling has little to do with looking at separate<br/>
life experiences as educational, but more enjoying a basking in the<br/>
experiences as they come, if they are of interest. Enjoying life and living<br/>
fully usually leads to whatever you need to know.<br/>

Sandra has graciously and meticulously gathered so much information on her<br/>
sight about unschooling (and other really neat tidbits!) that most questions<br/>
can be answered there, and lots of information can be gained. (Thank you<br/>
Sandra)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that was so long,<br/>

Few are specifically &quot;unschooling books.&quot;  Unschooling is much more a  <br/>
way to be and to think and to see the world than it is a thing to do.<br/>

<br/>
Thank You for your wonderful advice!!  We will be taking everyone&#39;s <br/>
opinions, desires and needs into consideration while planning this <br/>
trip.  I loved your idea about stopping any time anyone asked to do <br/>
so.  I agree that this will alivate a lot of stress while on the road.  <br/>
After all, we are not in any hurry.  It&#39;s not as if we will only have a <br/>
weeks vacation to do all the things we want to do.  <br/>
I have found Sandra Dodd&#39;s web site and there is a wealth of ideas <br/>
there.  I appreciate your book recommendations also.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
