<div id="ygrps-yiv-871864345">I&#39;m still pretty severely devastated right now and I can tell you what I <br/>
want to hear:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry and I know this is really hard for you.<br/>
(Just recognition - that&#39;s enough - it does make it better to know that <br/>
people care about me and are aware that I&#39;m in pain. The cards people send <br/>
or brief notes they send really do provide some sweet moments - I know it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem like much to the people sending them, but they are very <br/>
comforting.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I lost my (mother, father, brother, sister, child, etc.) and I <br/>
know how hard it is.<br/>
(Recognition of the pain and giving a sense of us being in it together - a <br/>
sharing. But it needs to NOT be in detail - I&#39;m not in any condition right <br/>
now to reciprocate if someone shares too many details of their own losses - <br/>
just being gently reminded that people do know what I&#39;m going through is <br/>
helpful, though.)<br/>
<br/>
Your mom was a wonderful person and ...... --- whatever they want to say <br/>
about how great she was ---......<br/>
(It is comforting to know that other people knew how wonderful she was and <br/>
it is comforting to talk about her -one of the things that is most painful <br/>
is the thought of her just being out of my daily life, disappearing like <br/>
she never existed and it really helps me for people to mention her, but <br/>
sometimes people don&#39;t know that and avoid it.)<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I want people to spend time with me in normal everyday ways and just <br/>
let it be okay with them and cut me some slack when I&#39;m absent-minded or on <br/>
edge or irritable or emotional or not entirely rational or somewhat <br/>
dullwitted --- I want people to understand that I&#39;m not sleeping well and <br/>
that my thinking is impaired and that I now have a deep sadness within me <br/>
that wasn&#39;t there before and I&#39;m having to learn to go on and be happy <br/>
anyway in its presence and that it isn&#39;t going to happen quickly and I&#39;m <br/>
likely to seem different to them  in ways they don&#39;t understand AND that <br/>
I&#39;m going to need more time than THEY probably think I should need.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  What I really wanted to hear was &quot;I&#39;m sorry, if <br/>
 you need me, I&#39;m here.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s tip number one!!<br/>
Showing that you care is fine, trying to make the person feel better is not.<br/>
Just a listening ear is often the best support, IF the person feels like <br/>
talking. Sometimes they don&#39;t. Be comfortable with tears, with sorrow.<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you the number of times I&#39;ve heard people say they didn&#39;t want <br/>
to bring up the death or loss because they &quot;might make the person cry&quot;.<br/>
As if not talking about it helped. What happens is the person that is <br/>
grieving feels isolated and cut off from their friends. Because the friends <br/>
are uncomfortable with tears so they don&#39;t call anymore, or don&#39;t talk openly <br/>
about the loss.<br/>
The best kind of friend is fine with your tears. They know they didn&#39;t cause <br/>
the pain just by asking about your baby/mother/loved one.  They were simply <br/>
willing to not act like nothing happened and be there while you were showing <br/>
hurt.<br/>
Don&#39;t say sorry a hundred times, we know you feel badly already.<br/>
Don&#39;t say &quot;ooooh&quot; with a really horrible look on your face over and over. <br/>
Cry with the person if you feel so moved. Hug them, let them know you love <br/>
them and will be there for them no matter what.<br/>
But just being a good listener is the number one thing.<br/>
When you&#39;ve lost someone, it helps to talk about them sometimes, to remember <br/>
good things and bad. A good listener is the best kind of friend.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that is a really horrible way to treat a grieving person is <br/>
that there is a time limit on their grief. <br/>
People expect you to &quot;get over it&quot; in a certain amount of time and if you are <br/>
still heavy into grief that isn&#39;t acceptable.<br/>
Helping people understand the nature of grief can help.<br/>
The grieving process isn&#39;t what we go through to &quot;get over&quot; anything. It&#39;s <br/>
simply a way to put the person we love into a new type of relationship with <br/>
us.<br/>
You don&#39;t quit having a relationship with someone just because they are gone.<br/>
They are in your heart and mind forever and what you have to do is adjust to <br/>
their not being present in your life physically. Which is the most painful <br/>
and difficult thing we can ever do I believe.<br/>
You never get over losing someone. It leaves a gap in your life forever. An <br/>
emptiness that no one else can fill.<br/>
Time does heal certain amounts of pain. Going through the grieving process <br/>
helps us accept and feel all the emotions connected to loss and death.<br/>
But there is no time limit on this process, there is no linear path through <br/>
the grieving process and it is a very different path for every person.<br/>
Some people are going to do things very differently than others, and to try <br/>
and understand and support them instead of telling them how to handle their <br/>
grief is very helpful.<br/>
If they still break down crying in a year, that&#39;s OK!<br/>
You might ask them if they&#39;ve considered counseling, but no one needs to hear <br/>
that they &quot;should&quot; have it.<br/>
Maybe crying is exactly what they need and they&#39;re feeling very capable of <br/>
handling their grief without outside support.<br/>
Usually, if a family unit is very open and able to talk about death and the <br/>
loved one, that is the most important support. Especially for children.<br/>
Without that, a person may need a group support situation or private <br/>
counseling.<br/>
If you want more info. email me, I don&#39;t want to get the list too clogged up <br/>
with grief advice. :)<br/>
I have a lot of info. on supporting children through the process, since <br/>
that&#39;s who I worked with (pre-teens) in the program. We did a camp that was a <br/>
very healing weekend for many families, and for myself also.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>

is doing the subject on her website about prematurity.  She might be able to <br/>

Everything I have is here with me, books, activities etc....I haven&#39;t <br/>
actually checked online information since all the work I did was back <br/>
in WA state before I was online.<br/>
There is a really good book called &quot;It Must Hurt a Lot&quot; that is about <br/>
a boy losing his puppy and the things that weren&#39;t helpful when he <br/>
was hurting and the things he learned.<br/>
I have a lot of games and activities that open the door to <br/>
communication about feelings and hurt.<br/>
Art is a great way to help children express hurt they otherwise can&#39;t <br/>
put into words.<br/>
Very young children will use play to deal with strong feelings, <br/>
especially acting things out with dolls or action figures.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what would be helpful for your friend, did she just want <br/>
links?<br/>

and I thought you might have some good stuff online.  (Of course, she can <br/>
google it!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pass on that book to her, though.  Thanks.  :)<br/>

BTW, the website is thepreemieplace.org.  The opening screen has pics of lots <br/>
of cute babies.  :)<br/>
