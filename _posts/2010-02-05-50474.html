<div id="ygrps-yiv-420507303">The last comment is another of those &quot;we&quot; statements that end up being  <br/>
unfair and untrue if &quot;we&quot; have not all had that experience.<br/>
<br/>
The middle comment, that I have &quot;lost that much essential space for  <br/>
self-awareness that makes it possible to keep our own selves  <br/>
nourished&quot; seems to be no more than an insult.<br/>
<br/>
This was posted on a blog by someone who was on this list a very short  <br/>
while:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is not that Sandra doesnâ€™t care about the well being of a child. I  <br/>
know she does, or she would never have made this phenomenal effort. I  <br/>
think, somewhere down the line, responding to so many questions,  <br/>
providing so much invaluable advice, working so hard to extend support  <br/>
to new beginners, she has lost that much essential space for self- <br/>
awareness that makes it possible to keep our own selves nourished.  <br/>
When that space gets crowded out, our actions start being automatic  <br/>
based on what we usually say, and they take on a life of our own,  <br/>
while we still continue to see ourselves as sensitive and caring.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve lost self awareness.  I don&#39;t think my actions have  <br/>
taken on a life of their own.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of putting that out in public?  Just one of those  <br/>
things...  Because I&#39;m willing to help people and because I&#39;m  <br/>
confident, I open myself up to the attacks of people who don&#39;t really  <br/>
know me at all.<br/>
<br/>
Will I hide, then?  Should I stop helping people, or question my  <br/>
confidence?  I don&#39;t think so.  I&#39;m staying here, doing what I&#39;m  <br/>
doing, because the &quot;two year thank you&quot; post from Susan the other day<br/>

trumps a blog post attempting to belittle me.<br/>

<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t think anything along the lines of:<br/>
<br/>
Should I stop helping people, or question my confidence?  I don&#39;t think so.<br/>

The same blog post also speaks of the respect I have for you and your<br/>
website, which continues to provide me with guidance. How you choose to<br/>
interpret it is your choice, and I cannot do anything other than being me.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was a new member some time. Unless that can be prevented, there are<br/>
going to be people who will perhaps not understand &quot;well enough&quot;. I see<br/>
value in many things you say, and other things I don&#39;t, like any outstanding<br/>
resource. What I share is my understanding of things, and this thread<br/>
reinforces it. That doesn&#39;t mean I lose respect for you, or even that my<br/>
losing respect has any significance in the face of the many who find<br/>
unending value here, including me.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do stand by what I said. I may change my mind in the future, but<br/>
my reality was that at the time of writing. Perhaps all newcomers go through<br/>
that, since you identified me as one? I cannot write or think based on how I<br/>
will feel about something some day in the future. I feel what I feel now. If<br/>
this is an insult, I cannot help it. I cannot pretend.<br/>
<br/>
One way of looking at it is my ignorance. Another is the impact of your<br/>
words. Two sides to every coin. Likely both true.<br/>

<br/>
It was hard not to interpret it as public criticism, but I was talking  <br/>
about the ideas, not who wrote them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Being me&quot; in anyone&#39;s case involves choices all along the way, all  <br/>
day, every moment.  You can do things other than criticize people in  <br/>
public, if you choose to.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If I joined a volkswagen repair list, I might mention that I once  <br/>
helped my dad rebuild a VW engine, but then I shouldn&#39;t keep on,  <br/>
because I haven&#39;t owned a VW for years, and haven&#39;t fixed one for  <br/>
longer than that because it was a Jetta and they&#39;re famously NOT home  <br/>
jobs.  They take special tools.  If I were on that list I would read  <br/>
more than post, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
If I joined a knitting list, I wouldn&#39;t post a word, because I can&#39;t  <br/>
knit.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, I do stand by what I said. I may change my mind in the  <br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t identify you as a newcomer because of what you wrote, but  <br/>
because you were asking newcomer questions and your child is an  <br/>
infant.  What you say, &quot;your reality,&quot; doesn&#39;t change what is true of  <br/>
me or of this list, though.   &quot;Your reality&quot; doesn&#39;t change how happy  <br/>
and whole my children are.<br/>
<br/>
This resource will still be here for a long time, I&#39;m sure.  If the  <br/>
list isn&#39;t, my website will be.  Joyce&#39;s will be around forever  <br/>
because it&#39;s so nicely designed that the internet archive&#39;s wayback  <br/>
machine will be able to find all the pages for sure.  I&#39;m glad of  <br/>
that.  Those who do want help will be able to find it even when those  <br/>
who are the regular writers now have gone on to other things.<br/>
