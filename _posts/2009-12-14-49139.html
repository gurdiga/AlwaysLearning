<div id="ygrps-yiv-518904059">I wanted to take the time to introduce myself.  I&#39;ve been on this list now for a few weeks, and thoroughly enjoying the discussions here, and thought it was time to say Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Christy--I am married (5 years) and have two children--1 biological son (17) and 1 adopted daughter (3).  We are in our 4th year of homeschooling, and our 1st embracing the unschooling philosophy.  We are doing well--our son is the most at peace and free than he has ever been and it is wonderful to watch all that he is embracing as his passions emerge. Our daughter is a free spirit and has been able to discover her passions as well--which is also an incredible sight :)<br/>
<br/>
We are currently foster parents in our state and have begun to provide care for 2 young girls (ages 3 and 5).  We are hoping to adopt them, but as of right now, their case is still tied up in the court system and could be for quite some time.  The obstacle I am facing at this time is how to parent them....since our priorities seem to be a bit different than those of the Department of Social Services.  Anything from eating to sleeping to discipline to school...very different views.  I find myself slipping into my authoritarian past and demanding respect---mainly because I feel the pressure to &quot;be&quot; something different than what we are.  Plus the girls are coming from a very authoritarian home, so the react negatively to any correction.  They also demand things as well--what to eat, to play, to watch on tv...they have been described as children with &quot;attachment issues&quot; and have been treated as such... <br/>
<br/>
It is difficult, these are children that I did not birth and they have come to us with their own set of issues that we were not a part of...yet their frustration is directed toward us and anyone that disagrees with them.  We are continuing to look at them as the beautiful children that they are, accentuate the positive and try to overlook the rest...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just curious if anyone on this list has had similar experiences and if so, can you offer your thoughts on how to encourage the children and remain true to your convictions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for reading ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082420602">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This group is dear to me and I have been reading almost every message for over a year. We have been unschooling for a year or so. we live in Ecuador and my children are 6 and 4.5. <br/>
<br/>
The other day I took my two daughters into the &quot;big city&quot; Quito and we ended up doing alot of fun things, buying a few pre-Christmas gifts and seeing friends. We spent the night in a hotel. Everytime we walked by the Christmas tree in the lobby, Divina (6) would admire one of the ornaments on the tree. It was a beautiful beaded, long ornament. She has recently gotten into beading and we stopped many times to admire the color of the beads, the design, etc. <br/>
<br/>
On the bus on the way home Divina and her sister, Sabina, were sitting to together and started to act funny - like they were doing something they knew they shouldn&#39;t be doing. I was curious and asked them what was up. <br/>
<br/>
In the past that has been the time they almost always filled me in on whatever suspicious activity they are up to. I have tried to be really aware of how I respond when they tell me they have broken something, or have done something that I might be upset about. I know they usually tell me what&#39;s going on because they know they won&#39;t &quot;get in trouble&quot; and we always talk about it. If it has been something that upsets me, then I let them know that. And we talk about why. Why they did it, why it upset me. And then it&#39;s over. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So when they both said &quot;nothing&quot; on the bus and the secrets and guilty faces continued I decided to let it go, trusting that they would tell me when it was time. Later on the bus ride I saw the Christmas tree ornament hanging out of Divina&#39;s bag. My face got red and my heart fell when I realized she had stolen the ornament from the hotel and then was hiding it from me on the bus. I was exhausted and the girls were really wound up, so I knew that it wasn&#39;t the time to take on the subject.  <br/>
<br/>
Later, as we were arriving to our hometown, Divina told me that she had taken the ornament. I was relieved that she was honest with me, but totally not sure how to respond. I knew shaming her and making her feel bad was not the way to go if I wanted to foster open, honest communication. But, I also felt like she should be aware of the gravity of the situation (ie stealing is NOT GOOD). So I told her that I wished she would have told me that she wanted to have the ornament when we were at the hotel. We could have asked if we could pay for it, or asked them where they got, to get one similar. I told her it was not okay to take things that belong to someone else without asking. Then I shut up. I have a tendency to say too much and I really didn&#39;t want to blow it. <br/>
<br/>
Once, at that same hotel, she really liked the fake flowers they had there. We looked for something like it in stores and found nothing. So she asked me if I would ask them if we could buy a few from them. It&#39;s a small, family-run hotel and it seemed reasonable. They know us, as we stay there a few times a year, and so I did ask. The receptionist was really sweet and handed us a few flowers at no charge. <br/>
<br/>
So when we got home I noticed that she had hung the ornament on the tree. It made me feel weird to have a stolen ornament on our tree, and I quietly and privately told her so. I also told her that I thought we should mail back the ornament to the hotel. I mentioned it to my husband as well, but really played it down and kinda joked about it, because I was worried he would get on her back about it, or shame her or lecture her. But that didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
So, to wrap this up (ha! Christmas pun intended) I&#39;m wondering how other unschooling families have handled stealing/pocketing with their small children. I feel sort of betrayed. Like she&#39;s growing up and wanting to leave me out of her thoughts and actions (which I guess she has a right to, I mean that&#39;s what maturing is to some extent, right? ) But I&#39;m hoping to learn how I can still be included in those internal dialogues (when considering taking something, or doing something she knows she shouldn&#39;t do).<br/>
<br/>
Also, that same day, we were at a friend&#39;s house and the friend&#39;s bracelet dropped out of Divina&#39;s bag. She had obviously pocketed it and Sabina (her sister) promptly picked it up and gave it back to the friend. I decided not to say anything in the moment because the situation had sort of taken care of itself. Again, not sure if I handled that right. Maybe I should have a follow up conversation, but also worried about to much blah blah.<br/>
<br/>
thoughts and experience greatly appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011741946">What if you call the hotel and talk to them and ask if you can send  <br/>
them a check?   Or if the ornament was special, offer to send it  <br/>
back?  But the check would be less expensive and then Davina will own  <br/>
it, and it might be a reminder every Christmas of how much she&#39;s grown  <br/>
up and away from that day.<br/>
<br/>
Once Kirby came home from playing with the neighbor, and he had a  <br/>
twenty-dollar bill in his hand.  He was five or six, I think.  He was  <br/>
looking at it oddly, and he said &quot;Look what I found in the street.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I said.  Was there anyone out there who might&#39;ve dropped it?  No,  <br/>
he said, but he seemed dazed, rather than excited as I thought he  <br/>
would have been if he found twenty dollars.<br/>
<br/>
In a while the neighbor&#39;s mom called and said there had been a twenty  <br/>
dollar bill and did I think Kirby might have gotten it.  I said yes,  <br/>
and we&#39;d come over, so he gave it back to her and said sorry and she  <br/>
was nice about it.  We talked a bit and I said I guess once he had it  <br/>
he couldn&#39;t figure out how to return it, and we all agreed it was very  <br/>
awkward, but at least he wasn&#39;t sneaky about it.<br/>
<br/>
Once money was missing from the karate dojo, when Kirby was ten or  <br/>
eleven and the sensei called me to ask whether Kirby might have gotten  <br/>
it, since he had been in the dressing room.  One of the guys had left  <br/>
cash in his shoe.   It had been over a day since it had happened, and  <br/>
Kirby had neither acted funny, nor had he gone and bought any thing.   <br/>
I figured if he had cash he would have bought Pokemon cards or  <br/>
whatever the equivalent thing was in those days (I think it was  <br/>
Pokemon days).  But I admitted that he had once taken that other money  <br/>
from a neighbor and returned it.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher was stressed, and he liked Kirby, but he said they  <br/>
couldn&#39;t have a thief at the dojo.  Kirby said he didn&#39;t get it, and I  <br/>
believed him but the teacher was doubtful and worried.   They found  <br/>
the money another day or two later, though.  It had fallen behind the  <br/>
shelf or some such, so Kirby was cleared and the other guy had the  <br/>
money, and as the years passed, there, Kirby became the most trusted  <br/>
student and used to housesit (the sensei lived in the building the  <br/>
dojo and the store were in).<br/>
<br/>
I think treating it was an awkward and and unfortunate situation that  <br/>
needs to be resolved, without condemning the child is the way to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is hard for most of us to become good unschooling parents --- <br/>
doing it with the added stresses of have DSS looking over your shoulder <br/>
really makes it more difficult. Doing it with THREE children ages 2, 3, <br/>
and 4 plus a 17 year old seems just extraordinarily hard.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you&#39;re determined to do it, more power to you (you&#39;ll need it). <br/>
I do know someone who adopted four young children and has successfully <br/>
unschooled, so I&#39;m not saying it is impossible. But, she has an <br/>
extremely involved husband and two sets of very very involved <br/>
grandparents, too. From the outside, anyway, it looks very difficult. <br/>
They do seem very very happy, though.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion to you is to focus on making a &quot;better&quot; choice each time <br/>
you can. I think that was the most helpful advice I got as a parent of <br/>
younger kids - it was surprisingly practical and encouraging to simply <br/>
consider at least two choices and pick the better one. The next time, <br/>
try to think of the one you did choose and then one other - pick the <br/>
better one. If you make a choice you&#39;re unhappy with, after the fact, <br/>
think then about what would have been a better choice - have that one <br/>
&quot;on hand&quot; for next time.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect to be perfect, but expect yourself to be improving all the <br/>
time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264310601">This thread brought back two memories.  I remember stealing a Weeble--<br/>
does anybody remember those toys?--in preschool, because I thought<br/>
Weebles were SOOOO cool, and I didn&#39;t have any, and I knew my parents<br/>
couldn&#39;t afford to buy me any.  I put it in my pocket and brought it home<br/>
from pre-school, then hid it in my room.  Couldn&#39;t sleep a wink that night,<br/>
tossing and turning with guilt.  You can bet I snuck that Weeble back into<br/>
my classroom the next day!<br/>
<br/>
The other memory is of something that happened a year or two later:  I got<br/>
to wondering what pebbles would sound like as they bounced off the sides of a <br/>
moving car.  It honestly NEVER occurred to me that throwing rocks at cars<br/>
could do damage, or that the owners of the cars might be upset.  I was just<br/>
honestly curious about what sort of sound the pebbles would make.  I think<br/>
I had become aware of the Doppler effect, and was wondering about that...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, one day, after school, at the baby sitter&#39;s house, I mentioned this<br/>
to the baby sitters&#39; two daughters.  They thought throwing rocks at cars sounded<br/>
like fun, so off we went to give it a try.  Can you imagine my surprise when the<br/>
first car we threw pebbles came to a screeching stop, and a VERY angry man<br/>
got out and yelled at us?  Honestly, I was SHOCKED.  To me, this was no different<br/>
than skipping stones across a pond, but, gosh, this guy was ANGRY.  <br/>
<br/>
He hollered at us for awhile, and then He then complained to the babysitter, who <br/>
promptly spanked her two girls, yelling at them for being a bad example for me.  <br/>
(They were often in trouble, and I never was.)  The whole story was relayed to my <br/>
mother when she came to pick me up, with MORE apologies for how the other<br/>
girls had been a bad influence on me.  All the way home, my mother talked<br/>
about how proud she was that I didn&#39;t act like those other, stupid girls, how relieved<br/>
she was that she didn&#39;t have to spank me and send me to bed without my supper.  <br/>
<br/>
I recall it took me several days to &#39;fess up to being the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind that <br/>
particular adventure; I remember being in tears, crying for fear of being spanked<br/>
and sent to bed without my supper, crying because I didn&#39;t know how I could<br/>
have been so stupid, and crying because I had let my parents down by acting <br/>
stupid.  What I can&#39;t remember is what happened AFTER my confession.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was thinking, sometimes people make mistakes because of an<br/>
impulse, and sometimes people just aren&#39;t thinking things through.  If we<br/>
can help our kids to think things through, I think (hope) that they will become<br/>
more able to think more things through on our own... eventually.  But of course,<br/>
there are times all through life when we make mistakes, and need a safe person<br/>
to talk to, and need forgiveness, and help in making amends.<br/>
<br/>
Also, these memories remind me that we can pass judgment on our kids,<br/>
indirectly, by passing judgment on others&#39;.  If we aren&#39;t tolerant, forgiving,<br/>
understanding of people in general, then we our kids won&#39;t feel that we<br/>
will be tolerant, forgiving, understanding of them, and with good reason!<br/>
<br/>
We can respond to our children&#39;s mistakes in a way that encourages them to<br/>
let us help them to think the problem though and to make amends.<br/>
<br/>
Most people appreciate when others make amends.  The missing ornament<br/>
may have gone unnoticed, but the act of sending it back, or paying for<br/>
a replacement, most likely will NOT go unnoticed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255695841">I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t written on here before and that this will be my first post.  It&#39;s probably better to have some posts introducing myself before jumping in, but I feel strongly about this thread.<br/>
<br/>
I think the ornament should be returned and as an alternative to that offer to pay for it--not the other way around.  It is difficult, but children can understand concepts such as property.  They can understand how they might feel if someone took one of their things and how it would be better if it was returned to them rather than the person offering to pay them for their thing--as if he/she has the right to decide what to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
It was not your daughter&#39;s ornament.  She took it.  She should return it.  If the people are amenable, you can pay for it.  But, that&#39;s their decision to make.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all of this, I also don&#39;t think you should shame your daughter, but empathize with her strong feelings about the ornament.  It was special to her.  Captivating.  Amazing.  But, it might be so to the hotel people too.  And, even if it wasn&#39;t special to them, it was theirs.  Just as your daughter has her stuff--is it only protected and hers to have if it&#39;s special and amazing?  Doesn&#39;t that set up the kind of limited thinking we want to avoid?  i.e. &quot;You already have that, you don&#39;t need more!&quot;  Or, &quot;You never play with the one you have--we should get rid of it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think your daughter should be helped to understand this.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter took a stuffed animal from a friend once when she was 4 or 5.  I discovered it when we were driving away from the playdate, almost at home,  as she was hiding it from me under her shirt... she was not good at being sneaky, and felt horrible and scared and guilty about it.  I was sympathetic and we talked about how great the lion was.  It&#39;s fur was so soft and fluffy and it looked kind but was also strong and majestic, just like a real lion.  She liked it and wanted it to be her friend.<br/>
<br/>
I called the mom when we got home and offered to return right away and she suggested that we could come back the next day.  So, I told my daughter that the lion could have a sleepover with us and meet all of her animals, and then she&#39;d have to go back home where she had all of her family and friends.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was a little sad about it all, but understood, at least as a concept, that the lion should go back to her friend who was missing it, that it was hers and that we must not take things that don&#39;t belong to us.<br/>
<br/>
I share my things with my kids to an extent.  There are some things that I don&#39;t--they&#39;re special to me or inappropriate for kids.  I don&#39;t expect my kids to share unless they want to usually.  If something is special to them, they don&#39;t have to share it, but we put it away or don&#39;t bring it with us if we will be around other kids who might want it. <br/>
<br/>
My kids understand that they have right over their own property and by extension that others have right over their own.  They also like to share all sorts of things with us and their friends and are generous.  It comes from them without my prompting. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are imperfect kids just as I am an imperfect mom.  We don&#39;t always get it right and we tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over until we don&#39;t any more.  It is not a straight, even line. But, we&#39;re trying. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra often speaks about being conscious about living with principles more than following rigid rules, and I think the concept of property and ownership is a principle that children can learn about and have evenly applied with them and the rest of the world. <br/>
<br/>
I think your daughter can understand.  She might not like it, she might be sad about it, but she can understand big ideas.  Most kids can.<br/>

<br/>
If one of my children had stolen something and not wanted to return  <br/>
it, I would have confiscated it and returned it myself, probably.  It  <br/>
depends on the item, because I don&#39;t want to contribute here to  <br/>
anyone&#39;s rule-building.<br/>
<br/>
There have been laws for a long time about harboring thieves or  <br/>
receiving stolen merchandise.  This is one of those (many) instances  <br/>
in which being unschoolers doesn&#39;t change our relationship with the  <br/>
world one bit!<br/>
<br/>

wrong word? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If anything has ever been wrong, stealing is wrong.  Stealing is  <br/>
generally a greater crime than killing someone, because killing has  <br/>
lots of justifications.  Theft has few to none.  Stealing has been a  <br/>
crime since caveman days, no doubt.  And then comes culture, which  <br/>
involves some people claiming ownership over group-acquired or - <br/>
created things, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic. Just pointing out  <br/>
that I&#39;m not trying to make a statement out of simplistic ignorance.   <br/>
(My ignorance is more complex... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Any child who has ever owned something knows that it would be wrong  <br/>
for someone else to take it.<br/>
Any parent who says &quot;this is yours&quot; and then takes it away from the  <br/>
child (to trash it secretly as my mom used to do to things, or to  <br/>
withhold it as punishment, or to let siblings play with it over the  <br/>
protests of the owner) is creating a sneak thief.<br/>
<br/>
If I had wanted to train my children to be thieves (as a neighbor who  <br/>
used to live behind me did) I could have done that.  Treating them  <br/>
cruelly helps.  It makes them needy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t apply in the case of this Christmas ornament.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I recommended calling the hotel applies because it&#39;s a  <br/>
hotel.  They woulnn&#39;t put family heirloom ornaments on a tree in a  <br/>
public place.  It&#39;s difficult to mail things the week before  <br/>
Christmas.  They might rather have cash.  They might not even save  <br/>
those ornaments from year to year but might say &quot;Oh, keep it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If one of my children stole an ornament from a private home, I would  <br/>
definitely send it back and not even consider offering to buy it.   <br/>
People&#39;s ornaments on their own trees in their own homes probably have  <br/>
sentimental value.  Ornaments on trees in hotel lobbies are unlikely  <br/>
to have that.<br/>

Does that mean that stealing is never, ever justified? Even to feed  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that murder might be okay (a murder that makes  <br/>

in terms of culture, judicial systems, religion?<br/>
<br/>

forgivable (at least by me). If you steal from me, I&#39;m not going to  <br/>

consider at least two choices and pick the better one. The next time,<br/>
try to think of the one you did choose and then one other - pick the<br/>
better one. If you make a choice you&#39;re unhappy with, after the fact,<br/>

<br/>
When the crime seems justified that doesn&#39;t get a severe penalty.   <br/>
Maybe none at all.<br/>
<br/>
The other night a policeman shot and killed a guy in Albuquerque.  It  <br/>
had been many years since that happened.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;murder,&quot; but a  <br/>
man is dead.  (Not a good guy, from all reports; still...)<br/>
<br/>
No one will fault this man who happens to be a policeman for killing  <br/>
this man who was clearly in the midst of violence, and also holding a  <br/>
shotgun while officers were asking him to please step out of the house  <br/>
and talk to them.  He didn&#39;t plan to do that, and it was a domestic  <br/>
violence call (and not his wife, and the guy had already been in  <br/>
trouble a few days earlier).    Bad.  Death.  Justifiable.<br/>
<br/>
Had that same policeman gone into the house and pocketed some CDs or  <br/>
some jewelry, *that* would be crazy.  Abuse of power.  None of his  <br/>
business whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Does that mean that stealing is never, ever justified? Even to feed<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think I said that, and I don&#39;t think anyone can or should say  <br/>
that.  Who&#39;s in a position to judge, in advance, all situations past  <br/>
or future?<br/>
<br/>
Theft isn&#39;t usually about bread, oranges, CDs or jewelry.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
usually about starvation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Someone killing my husband out of petty meanness or out of joy-ride  <br/>
youthful bullshit would have committed one of the worst crimes in the  <br/>
world.  If someone killed my husband out of self defense or to defend  <br/>
their children, that would be different.  It would still change my  <br/>
life as much, but their motives are at the heart of the criminality or  <br/>
forgiveability of it.  And one person might forgive another while  <br/>
others might not.  Noone earns the forgiveness nor the censure of all  <br/>
the world at once.  Each of us decides what and whom to forgive within  <br/>
ourselves.  Juries vote.  Judges ponder.  Other people get to revile  <br/>
or glorify as they wish to, freely.  Some thieves respect other  <br/>
thieves highly, no doubt.<br/>

<time>16 Dec 2009, at  1:44pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894110930">When Jayn was little, I&#39;m going to say pretty close to 5, her friend R <br/>
(about 7 or 8) brought over some small items that her dad had picked up for <br/>
her during his recent trip to Japan. She wanted to show them to Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
There was quite a lot of dress up play going on during the play date. <br/>
Eventually the time came for the visitor to go on home (just down the <br/>
balcony), and we started to gather up the things that she had brought with <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
Two pretty hairpins with flowers made from kimono silk were missing. They <br/>
were small - bobby pin size. So I proceeded to search through all the dress <br/>
up stuff and all over where they had been playing. I looked under the sofa <br/>
and the sofa pillows.<br/>
<br/>
I had a feeling from the way Jayn was kinda looking odd and trying to <br/>
encourage her friend to leave (very unusual) that she had taken them, but I <br/>
couldn&#39;t be sure. I figured I would have to go through her stuff later - <br/>
which is a pretty large undertaking. I took her aside and asked her a couple <br/>
of times is she knew where they were and wanted to get them, but she denied <br/>
knowing where they were.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, after probably a good 40 minutes of really picking through <br/>
everything they had played with in the course of the playdate, R started <br/>
getting pretty teary. I assured her that I wouldn&#39;t stop searching until I <br/>
found them, even if she went home. Jayn tried to cheer her up by drawing her <br/>
a picture, but she wasn&#39;t to be consoled.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly Jayn looked at her and seemed to really notice how sad she was. <br/>
Jayn asked her something like &quot;Are you really that upset?&quot; and her friend <br/>
said, &quot;Yes&quot;. Then Jayn turned and went into her room and a moment later came <br/>
out with the two pins which she had hidden. She handed them back to her <br/>
friend and said she was sorry, and asked if R felt better now.<br/>
<br/>
Her friend was pretty surprised and said something like, &quot;You liked them so <br/>
you just took them to keep?&quot; and I said something like, &quot;I thought it might <br/>
have been that.&quot; I told Jayn that I was proud of her for giving the pins <br/>
back, and she told me that she didn&#39;t like to see her friend so sad. I also <br/>
told Jayn that if she saw something that belonged to somone else that she <br/>
liked and wanted, to tell me so that I could try to get another for her.<br/>
<br/>
I am proud of Jayn for coming to that decision herself, and the reason she <br/>
returned the pins too. It was helpful for her to see that taking something <br/>
not her own affects other people directly. This time it was very personal, <br/>
but the principle that others can be hurt by theft is applicable to any <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think the girl was a bit surprised that I wasn&#39;t punishing Jayn. That same <br/>
little girl had some (quite a few) months earlier taken my diamond ring from <br/>
the bathroom and hidden it in her own jewelry box at home. The girls had <br/>
been playing dress up and makeovers, and Jayn had shown R. the ring earlier <br/>
with my permission.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until after she had gone home and I happened to go into the <br/>
bathroom that I noticed the ring was gone. I asked Jayn about it, but she <br/>
didn&#39;t know where it was. So I thought about it and called R&#39;s mom. I tried <br/>
to be very gentle wondering if R had accidentally worn my ring home, and <br/>
said something about how she might have forgotten that she had the ring on <br/>
because they had been trying on different bits and pieces of jewelry playing <br/>
dress up, trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later R. came back with the ring looking very hangdog and <br/>
down. I&#39;m pretty sure she had been spanked and was probably looking forward <br/>
to being grounded or other punishments. Her mom had gone through the jewelry <br/>
box, and apparently she had tried to tell some malarkey about thinking it <br/>
was her aunt&#39;s ring in the box. I wish I had gone to the door instead, <br/>
because then I could have asked to speak to R directly and given her the <br/>
chance to give it to me and avoid what was probably excessive (IMO) <br/>
punishments.<br/>
<br/>
We have also been the victim of theft, specifically with our car being <br/>
broken into more than once. Recently my GPS navigator was stolen after the <br/>
window was smashed. This was inconvenient and ended up being costly, and had <br/>
a direct effect on Jayn&#39;s comfort - so now she has that added layer of <br/>
information to add to her world view.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the contrast of the two different ways of handling relatively <br/>
similar situations might be useful to someone. I can tell you that Jayn has <br/>
never stolen anything else since, to my knowledge. When she sees something <br/>
like that ornament that she likes, she tells me, and we would usually ask <br/>
about it immediately. In the past some kind people at a family owned diner <br/>
gave her a little carved wooden angel that she was adimiring - it was very <br/>
sweet and I think they appreciated Jayn effusive gratitude in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would insist on returning the ornament, because the feelings of <br/>
the managment about their tree are irrelevant to the idea that taking <br/>
something that belongs to others without permission is a bad idea in <br/>
general. But I would also show Jayn that she can always trust me to help her <br/>
get what she wants by seeking out something similar to buy locally or find a <br/>
way to make it. We could make a quest of it that would replace a bad memory <br/>
with a good experience<br/>

<h4>emiLy Q.</h4>
<time>17 Dec 2009, at  2:12am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726281670">Today we were at a small independent toy store.  My daughter bought<br/>
something with her money, my husband picked up a few things for the kids for<br/>
Christmas, and my son was playing with the train table they have set out and<br/>
lots of other things.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter started trying to use a yo-yo, and we asked her not to, and she<br/>
kept doing it.  She was throwing it down to try to get it to come back up,<br/>
but one of the times the string came off her hand and wooden yo-yo broke<br/>
when it hit the floor.<br/>
<br/>
She had spent all her money on her toy, so she and I took the broken yo-yo<br/>
up to the counter.  One sales girl rang us up and said we could probably try<br/>
wood glue on it, and I said we probably would.  Then another sales girl was<br/>
talking to us and asked what we were getting, etc. and I said we&#39;re getting<br/>
this because she broke it.  She immediately said, Oh, you don&#39;t have to buy<br/>
it -- we&#39;ll just put it in the damaged bin, no, no, no.  I had already paid<br/>
for it, and she was going to start a refund and said &quot;Just come back another<br/>
time to get other toys.&quot; and I said &quot;well, why don&#39;t we just get a yo-yo<br/>
today and not issue the refund?&quot;  So my daughter picked a new, not broken,<br/>
yo-yo.  It was a great experience for all of us.<br/>

Killing the tree was horrible and mean, not at all the same as some hungry people taking some apples from a full tree.  I am not sure, if I were renting a property and there was a fruit tree on it, I don&#39;t think I would have considered it stealing to take the fruit.  They are renting the property that the tree is on after all.  I do think that the fruit should be shared will all 4 tenants.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid there was a house that the neighborhood kids walked past on the way to our elementary school.  We used to pick (steal...) pomegranates from the tree that grew near the back fence and eat them on the way home.  As I got older I started to feel bad that we did that (though I found out that my brother did it too, 10 years before me!), so I planted pomegranate trees along my back fence and let the neighborhood kids know that they could have them, just to make sure that they didn&#39;t make a mess of their clothes so that they didn&#39;t get in trouble with their parents.  <br/>

<br/>
Whoa!<br/>
First, you didn&#39;t disagree.<br/>
Second, I was talking about literal trees, not figurative trees.  In  <br/>
no literal way is a grocery store a tree.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid we had an orchard.  52 trees.  A couple of years we  <br/>
sold apples, but usually not.  But there are laws about trees.  If the  <br/>
branch of a fruit tree is hanging over into another yard, the fruit  <br/>
that falls or that can be picked without reaching across the fence is  <br/>
okay to have.  That may not be true everywhere, but where we live it  <br/>
is.  If a tree hangs out into a public roadway, those apples are  <br/>
growing in public.  Not the whole tree.  If people want to keep their  <br/>
trees on their own property, they need to trim them to stay within the  <br/>
fence or wall.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Killing it would suck, but it doesn&#39;t sound like anything was STOLEN  <br/>
unless you lived there too and had made clear that they were renting  <br/>
the apartment only, and not any part of the grounds.  If they were  <br/>
expected to keep the yard clean, and their rental agreement didn&#39;t say  <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t touch the apple tree&quot; it doesn&#39;t seem to be STEALING.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s are all kinds of differences among locations and intended  <br/>
purposes and ownership of the fruit on trees, and none of it has to do  <br/>
with stores.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-772561704">I work full time from home and I have a daughter that is 3yrs and a 1yr old.  I have a two nannies/babysitters (they alternate days) that come in and watch my children since my husband goes to law school full time and is not the best with small children- good with the 3 yr old not so good with the diapers.  Both my nannies/babysitters are out of work elementary teachers.  I thought this was going to be good but now I am unsure.  I have unschooling principals on the fridge and tried to explain my thoughts about school ahead of time but one of the nannies has started to &quot;teach&quot; my daughter things and give her &quot;lessons&quot;.  I am not sure how to approach it- I have read your web site over and over and I was thinking of saying something like &quot;I don&#39;t want to &quot;teach&quot; her anything- I know that sounds weird but I would like to try it for awhile and see what would happen&quot;  My statement in quotes is sort of true but not really- I don&#39;t think it is weird and I<br/>
 don&#39;t really want to try it for awhile that is what I am going to do but I know she will think it is weird.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think this is an ok approach.  I like the nannies- they are nice and are nice to my kids and play most of the time but it upsets me when one of them puts on the &quot;I am going to teach you this now&quot; hat.  Do you think I am making too big of a deal of it and should not say anything?  SHe was teaching my daughter that 5 pennies are in a nickel and kept trying to get her to tell me answers, etc.  My daughter did not care and was not interested.  Most nannies treat my daughter like she is 5 or 6 since she knows all her letters, sounds of letters, has started to write, read a little and loves books but she is really only 3.  I want her to do her own thing- I don&#39;t want to force anything.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221883191">HI there, <br/>
I was a nanny before having my own son. <br/>
SO i will give my &#39;nanny&#39; side !<br/>
this is tricky, as its like asking to do something that goes against THIER gut .. they are doing what feels right for them, like we are doing what feels right for us. <br/>
nannies are also trained to &#39;teach&#39; children. i went to a college called &#39;Norland&#39; (im from England) it was all bout structure, routine and teaching children. .. .. for all my nanny charges this is how i was - this is what is expected (i DINNT enjoy being that way, it felt wrong) <br/>
your nanny will be doing what she thinks, she is ment to be doing to be a GOOD nanny- saying actually id rather you didnt teach her will either be a relief OR not the way she likes to do things and think about if the job is right for her. <br/>
<br/>
i worked for one family who i Quit from as they wanted me to be a way i simply coudnt agree to be BE 9 hrs a day .. .. .. <br/>
<br/>
Also the nannies you have employed are teachers therefor they want to teach .. .. .. <br/>

&gt; I work full time from home and I have a daughter that is 3yrs and a 1yr old.  I have a two nannies/babysitters (they alternate days) that come in and watch my children since my husband goes to law school full time and is not the best with small children- good with the 3 yr old not so good with the diapers.  Both my nannies/babysitters are out of work elementary teachers.  I thought this was going to be good but now I am unsure.  I have unschooling principals on the fridge and tried to explain my thoughts about school ahead of time but one of the nannies has started to &quot;teach&quot; my daughter things and give her &quot;lessons&quot;.  I am not sure how to approach it- I have read your web site over and over and I was thinking of saying something like &quot;I don&#39;t want to &quot;teach&quot; her anything- I know that sounds weird but I would like to try it for awhile and see what would happen&quot;  My statement in quotes is sort of true but not really- I don&#39;t think it is weird and I<br/>
&gt;  don&#39;t really want to try it for awhile that is what I am going to do but I know she will think it is weird.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you think this is an ok approach.  I like the nannies- they are nice and are nice to my kids and play most of the time but it upsets me when one of them puts on the &quot;I am going to teach you this now&quot; hat.  Do you think I am making too big of a deal of it and should not say anything?  SHe was teaching my daughter that 5 pennies are in a nickel and kept trying to get her to tell me answers, etc.  My daughter did not care and was not interested.  Most nannies treat my daughter like she is 5 or 6 since she knows all her letters, sounds of letters, has started to write, read a little and loves books but she is really only 3.  I want her to do her own thing- I don&#39;t want to force anything.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you think? Should I be concerned or do I just worry too much.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115799746">After I told Divina that I thought we should take the ornament back on the first day, it disappeared off the tree and I found it when I was rummaging for something deep in the shelves. I didn&#39;t take it, though. I left it there and then asked her later if I could have it so that I could take it back to the hotel if they decided they wanted it back. She ran downstairs, got the ornament from it&#39;s hiding place and brought it to me. <br/>
<br/>
I called the hotel today and the receptionist (who probably didn&#39;t feel like she had the authority to give away the ornament) told me that I could bring it back the next time I was in Quito. I offered to pay for it, but she said bring it back. I asked her where they might have gotten it so we could get another one, she said she didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was obvious to me that Divina knew that taking that ornament was wrong. That&#39;s why she acted funny on the bus, that&#39;s why she hid it from me, and that&#39;s why she hid it again when I told her we were going to give it back. I guess what is kind of freaking me out is that she had given me no signs that she wanted it for her own. We admire stuff all the time. I don&#39;t want to be worried that this is going to happen again the next time we admire something together. I guess I&#39;m wondering how much I can talk to her about this because I have so much fear around her stealing. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping in the future that she will come to me when she has done something wrong. And I also hope that there are more opportunities to talk about other people&#39;s possessions and how important it is to respect them. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard not to feel like I have to teach her a lesson. That&#39;s where my childhood experiences want to come through and sabotage my parenting. Maybe there is something to be learned here, maybe not. But I do know that my relationship with my daughter is sacred and I want to preserve it while maintaining certain values - honesty, respect.<br/>
<br/>
I will tell her tonight about my conversation with the hotel receptionist and I&#39;ll bring up a few ideas about making or buying an ornament for her.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your input and experience. It&#39;s so great to have a place like this to go to when issues come up. I can&#39;t imagine talking with very many other people in my life about how to help my daughter (and myself!) through something like this!<br/>

&gt; -=-if a child didn&#39;t seem to know that what they did was wrong, how  <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; you explain it? And what if they didn&#39;t want to return the item, or pay<br/>
&gt; for it after the fact?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If one of my children had stolen something and not wanted to return  <br/>
&gt; it, I would have confiscated it and returned it myself, probably.  It  <br/>
&gt; depends on the item, because I don&#39;t want to contribute here to  <br/>
&gt; anyone&#39;s rule-building.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There have been laws for a long time about harboring thieves or  <br/>
&gt; receiving stolen merchandise.  This is one of those (many) instances  <br/>
&gt; in which being unschoolers doesn&#39;t change our relationship with the  <br/>
&gt; world one bit!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- Is there an assumption here that children just knows that<br/>
&gt; certain acts are &#39;wrong&#39; (I&#39;m pretty sure we intuitively know that<br/>
&gt; murder is wrong, but stealing seems a bit grey to me)? Is &#39;wrong&#39; the<br/>
&gt; wrong word? -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anything has ever been wrong, stealing is wrong.  Stealing is  <br/>
&gt; generally a greater crime than killing someone, because killing has  <br/>
&gt; lots of justifications.  Theft has few to none.  Stealing has been a  <br/>
&gt; crime since caveman days, no doubt.  And then comes culture, which  <br/>
&gt; involves some people claiming ownership over group-acquired or - <br/>
&gt; created things, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic. Just pointing out  <br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m not trying to make a statement out of simplistic ignorance.   <br/>
&gt; (My ignorance is more complex... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any child who has ever owned something knows that it would be wrong  <br/>
&gt; for someone else to take it.<br/>
&gt; Any parent who says &quot;this is yours&quot; and then takes it away from the  <br/>
&gt; child (to trash it secretly as my mom used to do to things, or to  <br/>
&gt; withhold it as punishment, or to let siblings play with it over the  <br/>
&gt; protests of the owner) is creating a sneak thief.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I had wanted to train my children to be thieves (as a neighbor who  <br/>
&gt; used to live behind me did) I could have done that.  Treating them  <br/>
&gt; cruelly helps.  It makes them needy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But that doesn&#39;t apply in the case of this Christmas ornament.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The reason I recommended calling the hotel applies because it&#39;s a  <br/>
&gt; hotel.  They woulnn&#39;t put family heirloom ornaments on a tree in a  <br/>
&gt; public place.  It&#39;s difficult to mail things the week before  <br/>
&gt; Christmas.  They might rather have cash.  They might not even save  <br/>
&gt; those ornaments from year to year but might say &quot;Oh, keep it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If one of my children stole an ornament from a private home, I would  <br/>
&gt; definitely send it back and not even consider offering to buy it.   <br/>
&gt; People&#39;s ornaments on their own trees in their own homes probably have  <br/>
&gt; sentimental value.  Ornaments on trees in hotel lobbies are unlikely  <br/>
&gt; to have that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570145860">I haven&#39;t found unschooling folks in my area yet.  I live in middle TN- I know there are bunch of folks in East TN but that is 3 hrs or so east.  I am sure I will find folks at some point. The farm school is about an hour away and I know there are some cool people there- I am on the unschooling list here.  When I started to think about telling her not to &quot;teach&quot; I realized how strange that might be since she knew I was looking for a out of work teacher- I also realized that maybe she is &quot;teaching&quot; not because she wants to but because she thinks that is what I expect.  I am wondering if maybe she thinks she will be graded at the end of our time together and I am going to say something like- &quot;what have you taught my daughter- does she know more as a result of your &quot;teaching&quot;&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I avoid conflict like crazy and sometimes this is good but sometimes bad.  I am going to say something to her today but I just don&#39;t want to come off critical or judgmental- I want her to have fun at my house and love my kids.  I really just want her to play with them.  Everyone says I am very laid back with all the nannies and I should be more structured and act more like a boss but I can&#39;t and won&#39;t.  I try to foster what I want to get back.  I want someone to come into my house and love my kids and play with them- no stress, no worries about cleaning, laundry, teaching, or what I will think- just be with them and be happy.  I have hundreds of things to play with at my house and my daughter is very &quot;self-directed&quot;- you can just follow her around all day and she will create a hundred imaginary worlds and give you a part.<br/>
