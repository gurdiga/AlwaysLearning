<div id="ygrps-yiv-721841245"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Hi all. I have post</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">d on this list a few times sporadically over the years. I&#39;m from Australia and have 3 children- 8, 5 and toddler. We moved towns last year, and when we moved &nbsp;I convinced my partner to let me try unschooling, rather than enrol the eldest 2 kids in a new school. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;">It took a lot of convincing but in the end he agreed to a &quot;trial&quot;. T</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">he unschooling experience was truly a </span><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-weight:bold;">mixed bag.</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;I saw lots of positives and was fascinated by my kids ideas and conversations. My partner <span>was unfortunately&nbsp;</span>quite critical and skeptical</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.&nbsp;He had a hard time</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:bold;"><span>with the kids using </span>so much&nbsp;technology at home. He&#39;s self employed with a flexible work schedule so he would pop home often unannounced, and would say things like &quot;Shouldn&#39;t they be doing something real? Not playing games all day?&quot; (They wo</span></span><span style="font-weight:bold;">uldn&#39;t be playing games all day, I should add. But it seemed that way to him.)<span>&nbsp;Also, he would th</span>reaten the kids that if they didn&#39;t improve their behaviour they would have to return to school. It felt like with these threats hanging overhead and the constant reference to it being a trial, rather than a proper commitment, it was difficult to be joyful. So after only a short period- 2 months or so- I felt like I had made a bad decision. My partner said one night, I know you really want to do this but I think it&#39;s just adding more stress to our lives and I think we should enrol the kids into the new school. So I reluctantly<span style="font-family:'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif;">&nbsp;</span>agreed.&nbsp;</span><div><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.22;">They have now completed two terms at the school and I&#39;m sad to say they are very unhappy there. They didn&#39;t mind their previous school at the old town, and were happy enough to go, few complaints. But at this school they are utterly miserable. They have been quite articulate in explaining why, and I have tried to improve what I can for them by being involved in the school as much as possible, communicating a lot with the teachers etc, but I haven&#39;t seen any improvement. It&#39;s breaking my heart</span><span style="line-height:1.22;">&nbsp;hearing and seeing the anxiety over the weekend in the lead up to school, they&#39;ve even been tearful at times. My partner agrees that it&#39;s no way to spend a childhood, feeling so miserable, but I don&#39;t think he would agree to give unschooling another try.<span>&nbsp;He keeps assuring them school will get better/easier, but that&#39;s not the experience the kids are having at all, and they&#39;re feeling quite angry at their dad for promising that.</span></span></span></div><div><span style="line-height:1.22;"><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br></span></span></div><div><span style="line-height:1.22;"><span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;I am sorry to bring schoolish chat to the list, but I hope it&#39;s <span>clear by the end of&nbsp;my email </span>that&nbsp;I&#39;m not looking for ways to help make school better for my kids. Rather, I would love to hear from any families who attempted u<span>nschoolin</span>g more than once before it became a long term &quot;success&quot;? <span>Would it be damaging for kids to &quot;ba</span>ck and forth&quot; between school and unschool</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">? I</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;would like to go back to</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp; unschooling but not be so&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">hasty to determine it&#39;s not working</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">. I would like to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">ask</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;">DP to give it longer and</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;I&#39;d&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">tweak things to make </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">home more fun/work better, I think. Or do you think it&#39;s unfair to even consider unschooling again so soon after the last time? I don&#39;t want to jerk the kids around</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">.&nbsp;What is a reasonable timeframe to broach this topic with DP agai</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">n? I fear he may roll his eyes and say &quot;Not again!&quot; I don&#39;t want to do it if he is unsupportive and unhappy but also I </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">want my kids to be happy.&nbsp;</span></span></span></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041622893"><p>Easing in to unschooling is often better than jumping in with both feet - in this case, it wasn&#39;t the kids who were confused, necessarily, but your partner. He got to see the &quot;worst&quot; of unschooling without any indicators that it was better than school.&nbsp;</p><p style="background-color:transparent;"><br>Make a compromise for the next school year/term (I don&#39;t know how that works in Australia) - the kids tried school and it wasn&#39;t a great experience, so you could try homeschooling. Something &quot;with more structure&quot; than unschooling so your partner isn&#39;t so panicked about it, and he agrees to back off and give it &quot;a fair chance&quot; - two months isn&#39;t enough for any kind of progress.<br><br>Do a bunch of research into different homeschool methods, materials, and curricula so he doesn&#39;t get the impression you&#39;re just winging it - have a plan and a couple backup plans (most homeschoolers find their first choice method or curriculum isn&#39;t perfect and need to make changes). Plan to need to prove yourself and your methods to your husband - read the &quot;curriculum&quot; and &quot;checklist&quot; pages at Sandra&#39;s site for some ideas in that regard, so you&#39;re not stuck with worksheets, but also realize that something like worksheets might be enough to get him to calm down - just like if you lived someplace where you needed to provide documentation. It&#39;s up to you to reassure him that you&#39;re doing right by his children. Since they&#39;ve had a rough school experience, they may be more cooperative in terms of jumping through those kinds of hoops than they would have been previously.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="line-height:13.555554389953613px;">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html<br></span>http://sandradodd.com/checklists<br></p><p style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;"><br></p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264317151">Are you in touch with Australian unschoolers?  Not the wild political/dietary-magic set, but those who read this discussion? :-)<br/>
<br/>
That would help.  <br/>
<br/>
In case you weren&#39;t aware, there will be three Always Learning LIVE events  in Australia in March.  With kids in school, it might not be so easy to attend, but maybe part of one, if they&#39;re not too far.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re near Cairns, there&#39;s a little gathering, not a symposium, but you could meet some other people, early the second week of March.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204506022"><p>Thanks. I do live someplace I need to provide documentation of learning. I&#39;d also keep a journal this time around, noting down the cool conversations we have, because there are so many. We have 4 terms per year here in Australia, around 2.5 months per term. So do you think I should ask him to consider a full year commitment? I don&#39;t know what a reasonable timeframe is, to be fair to everyone. I&#39;m only in the pondering stage right now, I don&#39;t want to rush anything. I&#39;m just trying to come up with a bit of a game plan in my mind so that if and when I do approach DP I will feel confident and positive.</p><p><br></p><p style="font-style:normal;">I used to be part of a couple of great Aussie unschooling groups on Facebook but am taking some off Facebook at the moment. Years ago, I was probably part of the political unschooling group, but have mellowed a lot since then :-) I&#39;ll think about reactivating my Facebook so I can join those groups again.<span style="">A</span><span style="line-height:1.22;">&nbsp;friend&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.22;">is&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.22;background-color:transparent;">&nbsp;going to the unschooling symposium in Melbourne this year and I would dearly love to go but can&#39;t afford the tickets or accommodation unfortunately. The great thing is that I can get the executive summary from&nbsp;my friend, which is better than nothing :-)</span></p></div>

Rather than focusing on unschooling, focus on what you want unschooling for. What do you want to use unschooling for?<br/>

Maybe something like &quot;Create a joyful learning experience for my kids AND support my husband in feeling comfortable that they&#39;re learning.&quot;<br/>

They&#39;re his kids too :-) And he&#39;s understandably worried. Worried especially since it&#39;s out of his control.<br/>

What are his fears? What would he like to see? What will help him feel more comfortable?<br/>

<time>10 Feb 2014, at  1:46am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990268869"><html><head></head>
 
<div dir="ltr">
<div style="FONT-SIZE:14pt;FONT-FAMILY:'Calibri';COLOR:#008080;">
<div><font size="4">Just on the play based learning thing. I am in Australia too. 
My experience with this and the general vibe wrt play-based&nbsp; learning is 
that its just another name for sneaking in academics when the kids are having 
fun and “hey they don’t even realise it! “ (I am not a proponent).&nbsp; I don’t 
believe any parent who adheres to schooly education would tolerate pure play for 
pure play’s sake. It would need to be proven that there are very fun ways to 
learn academics and that by having fun they will learn (which is true and IS 
aligned with unschooling but in this case its motivated by a bunch of hidden 
agendas). Its couched very nicely to appeal to the mainstream. </font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">I might be off the mark here but that’s my impression. Lots of 
scared parents do well with lovely play based talk (I am not saying your husband 
is scared just parents in general who send their kids to school who are scared 
to take them out because they don’t see any other option). At least that’s been 
what I have noticed in the community where I live. I am the only homeschooler 
here where I live who isn’t using a curriculum and who is learning how to let go 
and live into the unschooling philosophy. </font></div>
<div><font size="4">(I just want to add that I too am a scared parent at the 
moment... but that’s not because I am scared about the lack in academics. That’s 
the least of my worries. My big fear is allowing technology into our lives and 
the power that it is having which is the subject of whole different 
thread).</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Also, just as an aside. I bought Rue Kreams’ book from the US 
(it was $32 Aus) and its been worth every cent as far as getting my husband on 
board with this unschooling journey we are now on. My husband read it and is a 
complete convert to the unschooling philosophy. Its had my pretty awe struck to 
be honest as he has been as strict as me wrt sugar and tv and such. Now he’s the 
strong one helping ME to let go. Go figure! I recommend it if your husband is 
willing to read it (we had an agreement that if he read that then I would read 
one of his business coaching books! I have yet to live up to my side of the 
bargain on that one)</font></div>

<p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:12.0px Helvetica;min-height:14.0px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin:0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;font:12.0px Helvetica;">If you don&#39;t think conversation with him about it is likely to be helpful, reflect on the questions yourself. &nbsp;Are there things you can do to address any fears of his? &nbsp;Sometimes extra understanding and generosity in a sensitive area will help. &nbsp;If you can make progress in any area, it will shift the situation that you&#39;ve been dealing with. &nbsp;From there you&#39;ll be able to reassess again, make some changes again and so on.</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039555251">Thanks everyone for your replies, especially to you Lisa. A lot of what you said rings true for me too. My partner gets stressed with mess, and when me/our family is unorganised ( I have struggled with being neat and organised my whole life, this has been an ongoing frustration for him). One of his biggest bugbears is when the evening routine doesn&#39;t go smoothly, and the kids bedtime ends up later than usual. He has a real need for peace and quiet in the evenings, and likes spending time alone with me, debriefing about the day etc, once they&#39;re in bed. It seems strange after reading a lot on radical unschooling and relaxed (or lack of) bedtimes to consider that earlier bedtimes could actually be helpful for us. I&#39;ll make more of an effort to make home a relaxing place that everyone wants to be.<br/>
<br/>
My longterm goal *is* to have a happier family, who are connected. That includes my partner as well as the kids. Right now there is a lot of unhappiness, different reasons for everyone. Rather than focusing on unschooling as the goal, I will focus on making a more peaceful, happy home as the goal for now. <br/>
<br/>
What can I actually say to my kids though, that takes their unhappiness seriously and helps them get through school in the interim? I don&#39;t want to say &quot;it will get better, hang in there&quot;. As it might not. I also don&#39;t want to mention the possibility of homeschooling in future in case that doesn&#39;t happen. Some well-meaning people have told them things like &quot;all kids complain about school, life isn&#39;t fair&quot;. That doesn&#39;t feel right to me. So far I&#39;ve been empathising, eg &quot;Sorry you&#39;re finding it hard. What can I do to help you/make it easier?&quot; I feel like my token efforts aren&#39;t having much impact.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it&#39;s ok to ask that even though it&#39;s school-related. I understand if you remove that section of my post. This is a long-shot, but are there any groups for people who are not actually unschooling but would like to be, and have to work *with* school for now? I would love to talk with others in my position about what I can do within my limitations but don&#39;t want upset anyone by bringing schoolish chat here.<br/>
