<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248347944">My DD, who is 11, is very quick to cry, especially when disappointed<br/>
or if she sees a situation as being unfair.  Most kids seem to be able<br/>
to shake off these situations and move on, but my DD (Pearl) is just<br/>
not able to.<br/>
<br/>
I know that if she could change this about herself, she would.  I<br/>
often see her fighting back tears. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s difficult for her, and I see the effect it has on others.  I know<br/>
tears make most adults uncomfortable, and often folks try to fix the<br/>
problem or kind of talk her out of crying, which doesn&#39;t usually help. <br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but judging from body language, I&#39;m feeling like<br/>
some of the other kids are thinking &quot;here she goes again&quot; when Pearl<br/>
starts to cry.<br/>
<br/>
My immediate concern is that Pearl has decided she wants to be in a<br/>
play that our homeschool group is doing.  Today they had an acting<br/>
workshop for those who are interested in auditioning.  They played an<br/>
acting game at the workshop.  The director asked who&#39;d like to<br/>
participate (it was something where one kid would join in, later<br/>
another, then another.) Pearl thought everyone would be called on to<br/>
participate.  The director thought everyone who wanted to participate<br/>
would volunteer.  So what ended up happening was that Pearl was never<br/>
called on and never volunteered and did not get a chance to be in the<br/>
game.  This made her cry.<br/>
<br/>
This is a typical example of what brings her to tears.  The director<br/>
was very nice, and even apologized for the lack of clarity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always said yes to whatever the kids wanted to participate in.<br/>
I&#39;ve also been sure to let Pearl know just what to expect, where I<br/>
could foresee possible injustices that might occur, and ask her if she<br/>
thought she could handle it.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m wondering if I should tell her that I think she should not be<br/>
in the play (which is how I&#39;m feeling right now.) I don&#39;t know if<br/>
she&#39;ll be able to handle the feedback, (slow down, speak louder, etc.)<br/>
and there are bound to be situations that come up that she does not<br/>
agree with, and she&#39;s likely to cry.  I&#39;m just feeling like it&#39;s not<br/>
worth it, that the positives couldn&#39;t possibly outweigh the negatives.<br/>
 I also think the director is going to have enough on her plate<br/>
without the added complication of a not-so-easy-going actress in the<br/>
show.  <br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to do a &quot;try it and see how it goes&quot; thing, because if she<br/>
is cast, it&#39;s not cool to drop out, it affects the other people in the<br/>
show.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any wisdom, advice, that you can offer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I used to cry easily.<br/>
<br/>
Holly went to a group interview, kind of audition/games, for a job,  <br/>
and she ended up in tears, but she got the job, too.  It&#39;s not always  <br/>
a disaster.  She wasn&#39;t happy that she got tearful.<br/>
<br/>
I used to cry sometimes at music lessons--not boo-hoo cry, just tears  <br/>
in my eyes.  I could carry on, but it upset my teacher.  I figured  <br/>
out what it was, though, over the years.  I wasn&#39;t breathing.   <br/>
Especially when the instrument involved was a wind instrument.  But  <br/>
at piano lessons too, I was sitting stiffly, not relaxed, and holding  <br/>
my breath listening to the teacher, staring at the music, trying to  <br/>
figure out whether I could do it one more time, better.<br/>
<br/>
With my kids, that was valuable information.  I&#39;ve been able to help  <br/>
them find the huge value in deep, relaxing breaths, even while  <br/>
they&#39;re still in position to do whatever they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe talk to her about the feelings she has before the tears come.   <br/>
Tight throat?  Breathe.  Hardness behind the eyes?  She might toss  <br/>
her hair (which will shake off some of the building charge of  <br/>
electricity/stress around her neck) and smile.  And breathe.  I bet  <br/>
that will help.<br/>
<br/>
Being able to cry on cue is valuable for actors, though!<br/>
