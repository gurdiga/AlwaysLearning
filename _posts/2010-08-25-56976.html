<br/>
Five year olds sometimes want company. Thinking about this more respectfully<br/>
might help you ask a different question.  Would you want this for your<br/>
spouse or your friend--to quietly occupy themselves, rather than express a<br/>
need?   Would you consider it a successful marriage if you hadn&#39;t spoken to<br/>
your spouse in months or a year?  To a small child five minutes, or an hour<br/>
can be too long without connection, cuddle or a glass of water.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about getting a child off your back or out of your way.<br/>
Quite the opposite it is with engaging children, supporting their interests<br/>
and meeting their needs. Unschooling is not unparenting.<br/>
<br/>
When does she need to occupy herself? While you are using the bathroom, in<br/>
the shower, making dinner...<br/>
<br/>
Think about including her rather than ditching her, or perhaps offer a walk,<br/>
a tea party, or a trip to the grocery store to break the monotony of her<br/>
day.<br/>

&gt; but in shopping around I discovered there is also a DS Lite.  Too many<br/>
&gt; offerings.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>DSi is the most recent incarnation. It has a camera and better  <br/>
graphics. The newest version (3DS - not out yet) will have 3D  <br/>
capabilities. We&#39;re not sure we going to buy one. My daughter is happy  <br/>
with her DSi.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Part of my concern is that stylus thing.   Is that necessary<br/>
&gt; for all of the games?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some. Not all. My daughter plays using the buttons on her games more  <br/>
often than not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And aside from the likelihood of losing it, is it<br/>

&gt; Or even just dangerous in the same fashion as<br/>
&gt; &quot;don&#39;t poke your eye out with that pencil&quot; (Do kids use pencils  <br/>
&gt; anymore?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve lost a bunch of them, but replacements are easy to buy.  And  <br/>
unless your granddaughter tends to use pointy things as weapons, it  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be problematic &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; she<br/>
&gt; needs to be quietly occupied and forego the &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; every 2  <br/>
&gt; minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. Does she want a handheld game system? If not, don&#39;t expect it to  <br/>
be a solution for boredom. Are there a lot of instances in which she  <br/>
needs to be &quot;quietly occupied&quot;? At your home or your daughter/son&#39;s  <br/>
home?<br/>
<br/>
Engagement with her would be a better solution to her boredom, I  <br/>
think, than handing her a DS. In fact, at her age, she might need help  <br/>
with some games and if she&#39;s expected to play &quot;quietly&quot; it might not  <br/>
work at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Recommendations?  Feedback?   Would appreciate input about games as  <br/>
&gt; well as<br/>
&gt; game systems.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The DSLite or DSi are really the best handheld systems. The games  <br/>
themselves are a totally subjective thing. What does she like? Is she  <br/>
reading? I would say the Petz games (Dogz and Catz), and Nintendogs  <br/>
(from my daughter&#39;s experience) are good for non- or beginning  <br/>
readers. I hear that  My Little Pony, Sonic Rush, and some Disney  <br/>
games are good, too.<br/>
<br/>
I think looking at purpose behind such a purchase is a good starting  <br/>
point. I know, because when I was first looking at getting my daughter  <br/>
a system, it was to keep her occupied at our first unschooling  <br/>
conference. It was a misguided idea and a long-time unschooler pointed  <br/>
that out to me, thank goodness. I got her one because she was  <br/>
interested, in the end.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163142928">My 4 year old  daughter plays on my DS and I got my son his DS when he was also <br/>
4.<br/>
Not all games need a stylus pen. They are easy to loose and easy to replace.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine anyone being able to make them into a weapon!!!!!!!<br/>
The Nintendo DS is good in a way because you can still play gameboy on them.<br/>
THey now have the NintendoDSi  and the NintendoDSi XL<br/>
Both have more stuff in it like camera etc. you cannot play old  gameboy games <br/>
on them.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Were there also different types of Gameboy games?  Some have referred to<br/>
&gt; &quot;Gameboy Advance&quot; or something similar.<br/>
&gt; My younger son says that there is probably a Gameboy and some Games lost in<br/>
&gt; some closet here but the latest would have been &quot;gameboy color&quot;  and<br/>
&gt; probably not compatible with DS.   It&#39;s all &quot;Greek&quot; to<br/>
&gt; me.........................<br/>
&gt; Any advice on whether I should initiate a search in the packed closets and<br/>
&gt; nooks and crannies?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090521408">My kids are 4.5 and 6.5 and have had DS Lites for about 3 months now.  They both <br/>
play them a lot, and their favorite game is Super Mario Brothers.  2nd is Mario <br/>
Kart.   They particularly like them when we are driving places in the car, or <br/>
when they are tired and don&#39;t have much energy to engage in other activities.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Watch Craigslist if you have an active list in your area.  It&#39;s a great source <br/>
for outgrown DS Lites and games.  The games are pretty expensive even used at <br/>
Gamestop.  <br/>

Why would you need to?<br/>
I don&#39;t need to know the history of all Macintosh computers to buy an  <br/>
iPod.<br/>
<br/>
You just need to know there are different versions and that most male  <br/>

off to you anytime, anywhere. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-367081002">Megan got her DS Lite just before she turned 7. Her birthday was a<br/>
couple of weeks ago & grandma bought her a DSi XL (just like the DSi,<br/>
but a much bigger screen).<br/>
<br/>
The DSi has a camera (and some photo editing options also), can record<br/>
sound (sound editing options too!), you could use it as an MP3 player<br/>
with an SD memory card (music files need to be changed to AAC format,<br/>
I think). It also has a flip-note application (like making a<br/>
flip-book). Oh! It has wireless internet access too! The DS Lite<br/>
doesn&#39;t have any of that.<br/>
<br/>
The DS Lite & DSi XL have different sized styli & accessories (because<br/>
the XL is huge compared to the DS Lite) - I don&#39;t know how the DSi &<br/>
DS Lite compare as far as size and accessories.<br/>
<br/>
The DSi & DS Lite come in more fun colors than the DSi XL.<br/>
<br/>
We usually have a stash of styli for when we lose one (we keep them in<br/>
their own pen cup). But, in a pinch, the back end of a paintbrush<br/>
works fine too! The stylus is just pointy plastic, not magic. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If I was buying a game system for the first time, I&#39;d buy a DSi<br/>
because Megan is having so much fun with the voice, photo & flip book<br/>
options. Hers also came with 3 games installed already - Brain Age,<br/>
Brain Age Math & one other one.<br/>
<br/>
Megan decided to give her DS Lite to her sister, but she still uses it<br/>
to trade Pokemon characters between games. She&#39;s picky about graphics<br/>
and none of the older games appeal to her.<br/>

<br/>
My eldest says the DSlite is better as it can be hacked.  There is a card<br/>
you can buy that allows you to play anything you like.<br/>
<br/>
We have wireless and the dsi&#39;s are good online, the camera is great, and the<br/>
voice/sound recordings fun.<br/>
<br/>
Also DS to DS communication is fun.  Even pre-literate kids can draw happy<br/>
faces and enjoy sending messages back and forth.  My kids and I had lots of<br/>
fun with that.<br/>
<br/>
The PSP didn&#39;t work for us, though we did have GAMEBOY advances at one time.<br/>
 The best way I found to buy game systems was to take the kids to a store<br/>
that lets them try them out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28734878">In an effort to revive this conversation...<br/>
<br/>
My 8 yr old DD wants a hand-held gaming system for Christmas.  I am currently looking into the following systems and wondering if any of you and your kids have specific knowledge as to why one system might be better than another:<br/>
<br/>
1) iPod Touch  <br/>
<br/>
2) Nintendo DS Systems<br/>
<br/>
3) Sony PSP Go or the PSP <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, My 5 year old hasn&#39;t expressly asked for a hand-held system, but often expresses a desire for similar things that her sister receives as gifts. One idea I&#39;m tossing around in my head is I&#39;m considering buying the iPod Touch for my oldest, and then I could buy my younger daughter a DS or a PSP so that they can exchange and try the other system out as they want.    <br/>
<br/>
My question with regards to that possibility is whether there are compatibility benefits of purchasing two of the same system that might outweigh buying two separate kinds of systems?  Insights? <br/>
<br/>
Finally, one last thought is that they both love touch-screens, love taking pictures, playing games, watching movies, etc.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505666962">Buying two compatible systems lets people play together - hook up the units and play the same game at the same time, or exchange characters and information (Pokemon, anyway, don&#39;t know about other games). Its also nice to find games that are compatible with console systems for added playability and sharing. <br/>
<br/>
The specifics of &quot;which system&quot; are best answered by looking at which games your kids like. Not all games are equally available on all systems! So be sure to check which favorites are available where - that could answer your question pretty quickly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216925838">We started with Gameboy Advance, then moved on to DS&#39;s -- our oldest<br/>
now has an iPod touch and the other devices currently collect dust.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing what I know now, I would have simply started out with the iPod<br/>
touch.  If you can&#39;t afford to buy games, there are LOTS available for<br/>
free through the apple store.  (If you have a DS, ya gotta buy the<br/>
games, and they aren&#39;t cheap; we bought some, but my boys tired of<br/>
them quickly).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found they really enjoy the iPod touch and it&#39;s ability to play<br/>
games (free ones, that they can choose), listen to music, watch<br/>
YouTube videos, and tinker with the many cool gadget apps available<br/>
(lots for free, again)   Fun stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673125624">I think someone mentioned that before, but I would second it - first find the games you think you want him to play and then get the system that plays those games. For me, the question is more what do you want him to accomplish: pass time, solve puzzles, play a role-playing game, sport game, strategy and so on...<br/>
<br/>
I personally (not my kids) have PS2, x-box, PSP, GB and GBA and each console came to my house because of a game I wanted to play. I also have an ancient PC that I am keeping so my kids one day can play some of my really old PC games (The Journeyman project - now I feel really old :)). There really are very few games out that are worth playing and when you add his age, I would think the list gets even shorter. <br/>
<br/>
Some of my favorite games (with the warning that I am not sure that are OK for a 8yo, my kids are younger, so it is hard for me to judge) are Star Ocean: The Second Story (PS, but all the PS are backwards compatible), Dragon Warrior I&II&III (GB), Golden Sun (GBA - if I recall correctly GBA is backwards compatible too). Now these are all RPG games, and there is fantasy fighting, so again it all gets back to what do you want him to get out of the game. There is a fair amount of reading too to follow the story line. They all are rated E, so supposedly suitable for 6+. If you think there is a game he might like and you don&#39;t want to play it beforehand, check gamefaqs.com reviews to get a better sense of the game. Another genre that might appeal to a boy is strategy, so Harvest Moon series maybe?<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone recommended the mom find games SHE-the-mom  <br/>
thought she wanted him to play.<br/>
I think the suggestion was made to find out which games he wants, and  <br/>
get the system that plays those.<br/>

<br/>
I think there are very many games worth playing and that kids will  <br/>
find out from other people what they want to play, and are rarely  <br/>
likely to ask their mothers.<br/>
