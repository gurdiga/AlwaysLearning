<div id="ygrps-yiv-330571762">I loved this post!<br/>
  I&#39;m Mom to 6 wonderful, quirky, absolutely not *NORMAL* young people. Each one fits somewhere on the spectrum of what some call ADD/ADHD. All are productive and reasonably happy people,too. I&#39;m just thrilled that there is a space onthe web where we can go and read about others who are uninterested in how well one &#39;fits in&#39;, and more interested in what WE can bring to the table ( that is not otherwise provided.) Unschooling has come late for us--we did a patchwork of &#39;Christian&quot; schools, public schools, and conventional HS when my older kids were small, but it came right at the best time!<br/>

    You can explore the universe looking for somebody who is more deserving of your love and affection <br/>
  than you are yourself, <br/>
and you will not find that person anywhere.<br/>
