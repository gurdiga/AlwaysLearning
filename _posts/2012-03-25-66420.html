<div id="ygrps-yiv-442883663">A little over 1 month ago I withdrew my 11 y.o. daughter from a Montessori school and began deschooling.  At the moment, there is a great sense of peace at home.  She is learning so much through the computer (she is fascinated by other cultures, geography, languages, music and animals), and we have such wonderful conversations. She is so happy. It is beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
But I am concerned that she does not want to leave the house and only gets out of bed to join in our family meals. She only showers once or twice a week, but does so voluntarily. I do not pressure her as I am hoping this is just a stage. She goes to bed at 4am and sleeps until sometime between 2 and 4pm. I set the bedtime (trying to honor the fact that she is a night owl), otherwise she would go to bed at 9 or 10 am. Every night she asks me if she can stay up all night.<br/>
<br/>
When her sleeping patterns come up in conversation she reminds me she is deschooling(I might have given her too much information, without having done enough research).  I then remind her that this is fine for now, but she is practicing today for the adult she will become and that it is my responsibility to ensure her well being. I ask her what does she want her life to look like and she doesn&#39;t really care about much yet. <br/>
<br/>
For the moment, it is just the two of us and I am being extremely relaxed about it. We are leaving for NZ in one month and will be away 3 months, so I am taking it as if we are on vacations. But in NZ we will meet up with my partner, Lisa, and although she is educating herself on unschooling, she has expressed her disapproval. <br/>
<br/>
My biggest concern is my daughter&#39;s growth and hygiene. Kids need sleep while they are growing, right? But she IS sleeping 10-12 hours a day. Am I being neglectful? Am I being too relaxed about her sleeping and hygiene?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556907532">I wonder your reasoning at telling her &quot;no&quot; each night about staying up all<br/>
night.    What turned 4 am for you into having the same final wall quality<br/>
as 9 or 10 pm may have had previously?<br/>
<br/>
10-12 hours of sleep daily is not at all excessive for an 11 year old.<br/>
That need is one of my complaints about public schools that start classes<br/>
at 7 am (or expect children on a bus by 6 am or even earlier).   They are<br/>
chronically sleep-deprived.<br/>
<br/>
It might be (you could ask her!) that she wants the experience of staying<br/>
up all night but once gaining it might not want to continue to sleep<br/>
through periods of the most interesting events.  Or to have most of her<br/>
waking time during a period when you are sleeping. (Although I am not<br/>
positive when you sleep or when you are available to her other than that<br/>
you do have wonderful conversations). I think it is a great skill to learn<br/>
to determine when one should sleep in order to be awake for preferred<br/>
activities or friend availability.<br/>
<br/>
Some adults ( I was one during a few different periods of my life) work<br/>
evenings or &quot;graveyard&quot; shifts.   My experience was that doing so did<br/>
indeed interfere with social life but in some cases in a positive way.<br/>
When I had to go to work at 7 am I could not readily socialize with those<br/>
who went out until midnight!.   Graveyard shift meant that I could sleep in<br/>
the morning and early afternoon and then socialize in the dinner hour and<br/>
afterward then off to work at 11 pm or midnight!.    It is not a valid<br/>
concern to say a certain sleep pattern is needed now to prepare for<br/>
adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
Will you be with your partner for only the 3 months in New Zealand?<br/>
Business partner or life partner?   After the 3 months in NZ will you be<br/>
apart again?  I think it matters in deciding how the three of you interact<br/>
during the 3 months.  Is it a vacation schedule or plans for permanent<br/>
single household?<br/>
<br/>
One last item on re-reading...............if she really does not want to<br/>
leave the house (is that an exaggeration?) what is she saying about making<br/>
the trip to New Zealand?<br/>
<br/>
vicki<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: short version: 1 month is so little time especially after the super<br/>
structure of Montessori  (for how many years?). Let her try staying up all<br/>
night....perhaps with the proviso that you talk together about how that<br/>
works. AND that she must not disturb the sleep of people who wish to sleep<br/>
during those hours.   If she does not stink or is not doing &quot;dirty&quot; work,<br/>
then twice or even once weekly showers are plenty.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s deschooling.  <br/>
For a long time she was made the get up and leave the house whether she wanted to or not.  She might be making up for all those days of powerless hustle. Let her be.  She needs to recover.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I set the bedtime (trying to honor the fact that she is a night owl), otherwise she would go to bed at 9 or 10 am. Every night she asks me if she can stay up all night.-=-<br/>
<br/>
if you let her, she won&#39;t ask every night.  But if you had never had a bedtime, she might never have wanted to stay up all night. My kids never did.  People sometimes want what they can&#39;t have.  Staying up all night must be pretty valuable, because you won&#39;t give it to her.  4:00 a.m. is practically all night anyway, so you&#39;re being arbitrary.  I kind of understand that, but am also trying to point out that it&#39;s part of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I used to tell my oldest to be asleep before his dad went to work.  One morning Keith went to work early, Kirby was up on the computer, and Keith only thought it was kind of cute, so after that I didn&#39;t care anymore.<br/>
<br/>
-=But in NZ we will meet up with my partner, Lisa, and although she is educating herself on unschooling, she has expressed her disapproval. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing about unschooling that requires staying up late.  It&#39;s arbitrary bedtimes that can be a problem.   Going to sleep because there&#39;s sightseeing to do the next day or because others staying with you want to sleep and you&#39;re coordinating schedules is sleeping for a really good reason.  Nothing arbitrary about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722252857">***She only showers once or twice a week, but does so voluntarily. I do not pressure her as I am hoping this is just a stage.***<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s doing so voluntarily, then you are lucky!  Some kids fight it.  Once or twice a week is plenty for a pre-pubescent kid.  I think most kids bathe more when they get older and sweatier.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***She goes to bed at 4am and sleeps until sometime between 2 and 4pm. I set the bedtime (trying to honor the fact that she is a night owl), otherwise she would go to bed at 9 or 10 am. Every night she asks me if she can stay up all night.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unusual for that age.  That&#39;s about when my oldest started shifting her sleep pattern to staying up all night and sleeping much of the day.  She is 17 now and recently enrolled in a GED preparation program and chose the morning shift of classes that start at 8am.  That surprised me because she will still stay up all night, but for her it wasn&#39;t a big deal to shift gears that way.<br/>
<br/>
By allowing her the freedom to make her own sleep schedule, she is able to really feel when she&#39;s tired and needs sleep and when she can keep on going and miss some and maybe catch up later.  She&#39;s not opposed to scheduled sleep times either.  I&#39;ve come to realize that I have some pretty intense hangups around sleep schedules.  I was the kid who always wanted to stay up late and was forced to go to bed, not tired in the least.  I&#39;d lay awake for hours and hours and then HAVE to get up early.  It was hard and I hated mornings for years.  I&#39;m just now coming to terms with that pattern.  If the choice had been mine, stay up and be tired in the morning, I&#39;m sure I would have found a way to balance my sleep needs better. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to NZ from anywhere on the other side of the planet, your worries over this might seem silly in a month from now.  Time zone changes can shift someone&#39;s sleep pattern over night!  Staying awake all night might work in her favor and you might be the one who suffers some insomnia for a while!<br/>

&gt; today for the adult she will become<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s living the life of an 11 year old *now*. An unschooling 11 year  <br/>
old :-)<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been in school, adhering to someone else&#39;s rules for when to go  <br/>
to bed. Now she&#39;s exploring her limits of tiredness and when her body  <br/>
says she needs to sleep. She&#39;s not disturbing you, right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I ask her what does she want her life to look like and she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; really care about much yet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Her future life will, necessarily, look different. She doesn&#39;t have to  <br/>
care about it much at 11.<br/>
<br/>
I think parents can make the mistake of always trying to prepare their  <br/>
children for eventualities that might never happen. What if she ends  <br/>
up working the graveyard shift and you&#39;ve made her get up at 6 a.m.  <br/>
every morning to prepare for a daytime career? Oops.<br/>
<br/>
Children, as they get older and they&#39;ve been provided with useful  <br/>
information and choices, realize what responsibility entails.  <br/>
Unschooling kids are the absolute best at figuring that out by knowing  <br/>
what&#39;s important to get up/stay up for, the amount of sleep they  <br/>
really need, and how to adjust their schedules.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Kids need sleep while they are growing, right? But she IS sleeping  <br/>
&gt; 10-12 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids her age need that much sleep. And as kids move into teen years,  <br/>
their bodies often need a different sleep schedule (late nights, late  <br/>
mornings). Many teenagers in school are chronically sleep-deprived.  <br/>
Unschooled kids aren&#39;t!<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s kind of right - it&#39;s only been a month. And you&#39;re still setting a bedtime, so it will take her longer to &quot;deschool&quot; from the limits you&#39;re setting. But she&#39;s only &quot;kind of&quot; right because natural sleep cycles can change at different times of life. Right now, it may be natural for her to stay up later. If there are reasons for her to be up during the day - reasons which are good to her - she&#39;ll adjust. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Kids need sleep while they are growing, right? But she IS sleeping 10-12 hours a day.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**************<br/>
<br/>
If she needs that much sleep, will depriving her of it do any good at all? If you think she has some kind of fatigue problem, that&#39;s a little different - does she seem like she&#39;s lethargic? Does she have trouble focusing on things she finds interesting and important? You could offer her more vitamin D and maybe B vitamins if you&#39;re really worried and see if it helps, but it could be she needs a lot of rest right now. It could also be she&#39;s spending some of that time daydreaming - and that&#39;s really a good thing, especially if she went to a school which didn&#39;t encourage a lot of flights of fancy (Montessori schools have a bit of a reputation for zero tolerance of fantasy). It&#39;s normal for tweens and young teens to do a lot of daydreaming anyway, and if she&#39;s had a lack of fantasy in her life, she may be playing catch up!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Eeeeek! Go apologize and tell her You&#39;re still deschooling too and will take a lot longer than she will. That&#39;s a Horrible thing to tell another human being. She&#39;s not practicing anything, she&#39;s living her life and learning about herself and the world. Are you practicing to be an old lady?<br/>
<br/>
Spend time with her. Bring food to where she is and eat with her there. Bring projects for yourself so you can hang out with her for a big chunk of time, if she&#39;s doing something uninteresting to you. Enjoy her company. See her as she is right now - the shape of her face, the way she smiles, what interests her and what she enjoys. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and that it is my responsibility to ensure her well being.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she needs to sleep, then making sure she gets enough sleep is what will ensure her well being ;) Is there some Other problem with her hours? <br/>
<br/>
If the trouble is you&#39;re not seeing enough of her, say that. Come up with some ideas to spend more time together. Maybe you can stay up later or get up earlier! Maybe you can plan things to do in the evenings - lots of fun outings to be had after dark! That could help her get up and moving, too, if part of the problem is there&#39;s not much to do once the sun goes down. Make night time fun time!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I ask her what does she want her life to look like and she doesn&#39;t really care about much yet. <br/>

<br/>
Good for her! It&#39;s not good to get too bogged down planning one&#39;s life instead of living it, and she&#39;s only 10. How can she possibly know what her life will look like at 20? That&#39;s a lifetime from now, in her terms.<br/>
<br/>
I could not have guessed what my life looks like now when I was 10. Never in a million years. I couldn&#39;t have guessed ten years ago what my life would be today. I&#39;ve had a lot of changes in my life! Settling down into one thing, career or life plan, hasn&#39;t really worked for me - life keeps throwing me curves! I can look at what I&#39;m doing now and say &quot;I learned this here and that there&quot; but I wasn&#39;t preparing for anything when I learned to sew or make cheese or had a baby - I was living, and all those things have become part of what I know, part of how I understand the world. What will I be doing ten years from now? I&#39;m looking forward to finding out!<br/>

Current society is rife with disrespect for childhood. Like kids are merely gestating adults. <br/>
<br/>
Each day is a she is living the real life of an 11 year old. She&#39;s just as much a real person today as she will be next year or 10 years from now. Her likes and wants and needs are those of her right now self, not immature wrong needs that she must work at correcting until they match up with what adults need.<br/>
<br/>
Each day she will grow and change and her likes and wants and needs will change to reflect that.<br/>

Staying up all night must be pretty valuable, because you won&#39;t give it to her.  4:00 a.m. is practically all night anyway, so you&#39;re being arbitrary.  I kind of understand that, but am also trying to point out that it&#39;s part of the problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I used to tell my oldest to be asleep before his dad went to work.  One morning Keith went to work early, Kirby was up on the computer, and Keith only thought it was kind of cute, so after that I didn&#39;t care anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=But in NZ we will meet up with my partner, Lisa, and although she is educating herself on unschooling, she has expressed her disapproval. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s nothing about unschooling that requires staying up late.  It&#39;s arbitrary bedtimes that can be a problem.   Going to sleep because there&#39;s sightseeing to do the next day or because others staying with you want to sleep and you&#39;re coordinating schedules is sleeping for a really good reason.  Nothing arbitrary about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787170459">Hi,<br/>
I have two teens (13 yo girl and 15yo boy), that have always been educated<br/>
at home and we have unschooled for quite a few years now.<br/>
<br/>
At the age of 11 she is heading for, or in the throws of, adolescence.  I<br/>
found one decent article on adolescents and sleep cycles (the citation is<br/>
below).  The only point that I would disagree with is that they stated that<br/>
teens will needs &quot;as much as&quot; 9 hours a night.  This makes it sound as<br/>
though 9 hours is an outside number for hours of sleep.  My kids actually<br/>
slept as much as 13 or 14 hours some days when they were in the midst of a<br/>
major growth spurt.  So, I wouldn&#39;t think that 10- 12  hours a night is out<br/>
of the ordinary.<br/>
<br/>
I too am curious why 4 am is the deadline for going to bed.  She will<br/>
probably be a night owl for the next couple of years.  My kids seem to be<br/>
in the process of leveling off now.  They go to bed around 1 or 2 am and<br/>
wake around 11am.  They can change this when there is a field trip or<br/>
something that requires them to get up early, but otherwise we have a late<br/>
schedule.  Is there a reason to get up earlier and so go to bed  earlier?<br/>
If so, is it valid to your daughter, or is it reasoning that has no meaning<br/>
to her?  Obviously she thinks that it is important to join family meals.  I<br/>
think that that is a good sign.<br/>
<br/>
As far as hygiene goes... if she smells bad, I would tell her in a straight<br/>
forward, but polite way that she seems to need a bath.  My kids usually are<br/>
pretty good at judging their need to bathe, but will occasionally not<br/>
realize that they smell &quot;gamey&quot; and I will let them know.  I think that it<br/>
is only common courtesy to let them know so that they aren&#39;t embarrassed<br/>
outside of our home.  I still let them decide to bathe or not, though I<br/>
once had to ask my son (a couple of years back) to bathe because he was<br/>
really malodorous and we were going out.  It was allergy season and he<br/>
hadn&#39;t taken any meds for it and couldn&#39;t smell himself.  When he showered,<br/>
the steam cleared his sinuses and he could smell how bad he was and was<br/>
actually appalled that he neglected himself for so long.<br/>
<br/>
As for leaving the house... she is probably enjoying the freedom to stay<br/>
home.  I am only guessing because my kids have not generally avoided going<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I love that you say that she is happy.<br/>
Chris<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A little over 1 month ago I withdrew my 11 y.o. daughter from a Montessori<br/>
&gt; school and began deschooling. At the moment, there is a great sense of<br/>
&gt; peace at home. She is learning so much through the computer (she is<br/>
&gt; fascinated by other cultures, geography, languages, music and animals), and<br/>
&gt; we have such wonderful conversations. She is so happy. It is beautiful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I am concerned that she does not want to leave the house and only gets<br/>
&gt; out of bed to join in our family meals. She only showers once or twice a<br/>
&gt; week, but does so voluntarily. I do not pressure her as I am hoping this is<br/>
&gt; just a stage. She goes to bed at 4am and sleeps until sometime between 2<br/>
&gt; and 4pm. I set the bedtime (trying to honor the fact that she is a night<br/>
&gt; owl), otherwise she would go to bed at 9 or 10 am. Every night she asks me<br/>
&gt; if she can stay up all night.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When her sleeping patterns come up in conversation she reminds me she is<br/>
&gt; deschooling(I might have given her too much information, without having<br/>
&gt; done enough research). I then remind her that this is fine for now, but she<br/>
&gt; is practicing today for the adult she will become and that it is my<br/>
&gt; responsibility to ensure her well being. I ask her what does she want her<br/>
&gt; life to look like and she doesn&#39;t really care about much yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the moment, it is just the two of us and I am being extremely relaxed<br/>
&gt; about it. We are leaving for NZ in one month and will be away 3 months, so<br/>
&gt; I am taking it as if we are on vacations. But in NZ we will meet up with my<br/>
&gt; partner, Lisa, and although she is educating herself on unschooling, she<br/>
&gt; has expressed her disapproval.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My biggest concern is my daughter&#39;s growth and hygiene. Kids need sleep<br/>
&gt; while they are growing, right? But she IS sleeping 10-12 hours a day. Am I<br/>
&gt; being neglectful? Am I being too relaxed about her sleeping and hygiene?<br/>

&gt; ***************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s kind of right - it&#39;s only been a month. And you&#39;re still setting a bedtime, so it will take her longer to &quot;deschool&quot; from the limits you&#39;re setting. But she&#39;s only &quot;kind of&quot; right because natural sleep cycles can change at different times of life. Right now, it may be natural for her to stay up later. If there are reasons for her to be up during the day - reasons which are good to her - she&#39;ll adjust. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Kids need sleep while they are growing, right? But she IS sleeping 10-12 hours a day.<br/>
&gt; **************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If she needs that much sleep, will depriving her of it do any good at all? If you think she has some kind of fatigue problem, that&#39;s a little different - does she seem like she&#39;s lethargic? Does she have trouble focusing on things she finds interesting and important? You could offer her more vitamin D and maybe B vitamins if you&#39;re really worried and see if it helps, but it could be she needs a lot of rest right now. It could also be she&#39;s spending some of that time daydreaming - and that&#39;s really a good thing, especially if she went to a school which didn&#39;t encourage a lot of flights of fancy (Montessori schools have a bit of a reputation for zero tolerance of fantasy). It&#39;s normal for tweens and young teens to do a lot of daydreaming anyway, and if she&#39;s had a lack of fantasy in her life, she may be playing catch up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I then remind her that this is fine for now, but she is practicing today for the adult she will become<br/>
&gt; ***************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Eeeeek! Go apologize and tell her You&#39;re still deschooling too and will take a lot longer than she will. That&#39;s a Horrible thing to tell another human being. She&#39;s not practicing anything, she&#39;s living her life and learning about herself and the world. Are you practicing to be an old lady?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Spend time with her. Bring food to where she is and eat with her there. Bring projects for yourself so you can hang out with her for a big chunk of time, if she&#39;s doing something uninteresting to you. Enjoy her company. See her as she is right now - the shape of her face, the way she smiles, what interests her and what she enjoys. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;and that it is my responsibility to ensure her well being.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If she needs to sleep, then making sure she gets enough sleep is what will ensure her well being ;) Is there some Other problem with her hours? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the trouble is you&#39;re not seeing enough of her, say that. Come up with some ideas to spend more time together. Maybe you can stay up later or get up earlier! Maybe you can plan things to do in the evenings - lots of fun outings to be had after dark! That could help her get up and moving, too, if part of the problem is there&#39;s not much to do once the sun goes down. Make night time fun time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;I ask her what does she want her life to look like and she doesn&#39;t really care about much yet. <br/>
&gt; ****************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good for her! It&#39;s not good to get too bogged down planning one&#39;s life instead of living it, and she&#39;s only 10. How can she possibly know what her life will look like at 20? That&#39;s a lifetime from now, in her terms.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could not have guessed what my life looks like now when I was 10. Never in a million years. I couldn&#39;t have guessed ten years ago what my life would be today. I&#39;ve had a lot of changes in my life! Settling down into one thing, career or life plan, hasn&#39;t really worked for me - life keeps throwing me curves! I can look at what I&#39;m doing now and say &quot;I learned this here and that there&quot; but I wasn&#39;t preparing for anything when I learned to sew or make cheese or had a baby - I was living, and all those things have become part of what I know, part of how I understand the world. What will I be doing ten years from now? I&#39;m looking forward to finding out!<br/>

________One of the most enjoyable things I&#39;ve experienced since<br/>
unschooling is watching my kids learn the skills they&#39;ll need for<br/>
adulthood without imposing on them habits that worked for me.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s because they&#39;ve learned how to pay attention to details in their<br/>
environment and respond accordingly (they found other skills more<br/>
valuable in traditional school).  How do they learn to respond?  Lot&#39;s<br/>
of it is experience - trial and error.  Lots of watching others (what<br/>
works, what doesn&#39;t).  Lots of advice.  They know their father and I<br/>
have nothing to gain by convincing them to do something.   Our advice is<br/>
just that - advice.<br/>
For the record, I have a 12 yo who routinely stays up until 2-4 every<br/>
night. He probably sleeps 10-12 hours.  Every once in a while there is<br/>
something valuable for him in the morning and he jumps out of bed.  As<br/>
he gets older I expect his interests to change, and his sleeping habits<br/>
to accommodate his needs as they mature. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is very powerful. Especially since as adults we often impose habits that HAVEN&#39;T worked for us. On several occasions I&#39;ve asked friends to trace back the origins of the rules they impose on their children. They mostly come from their childhood experiences and 99% of the time they hated the rules. Yet we continue to impose them (myself included).  They seem to find value in having had a relatively unhappy/unfulfilled childhood just because they turned out &quot;ok&quot;, implying that these rules were necessary in order for us to become &quot;ok&quot; adults. But what I see lacking in most that have turned out &quot;ok&quot; is joy, a sense of purpose and fascination with life. <br/>
<br/>
I am so excited about the journey that we, as a family, are embarking on. A journey of fascination with life.</div>
