<div id="ygrps-yiv-537303341">I credit the preschool my boys went to with making me more receptive to<br/>
starting us on our unschooling journey (albeit many years later).  They<br/>
went to a Regio Emilia  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach)</a><br/>
parent co-op school. I worked there as the admin so I was around all day<br/>
and could pop in and out of the classroom and be available as needed.  I<br/>
learned a lot about respectful parenting, how to handle conflicts, how to<br/>
listen.  The wiki entry is pretty much spot on for the school my boys went<br/>
to, other than the hundred languages part.  It really was an amazing school<br/>
and the boys still remember it fondly.<br/>
<br/>
I do wish we had moved straight to unschooling after that but I had no idea<br/>
unschooling existed.  I wasn&#39;t able to extrapolate out to that and went<br/>
straight into the typical school route which really sucked for my guys.<br/>
 After things progressively became worse and I started looking into<br/>
alternate methods of learning, unschooling really stood out.  It made me<br/>
think of the Regio Emilia approach and that&#39;s why we ended up unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This started off being a response about preschools, but has turned into a<br/>
gratitude note.  So, thanks to all the unschooling contributers who have<br/>
helped me on my journey.  It&#39;s been invaluable.<br/>

It&#39;s cool looking back to see &quot;how we got here,&quot; how experiences we had before brought us to the present.<br/>
<br/>
I credit La Leche League and Adult Children of Alcoholics, because they helped me immensely, but not everyone lucks into a cool local La Leche League (or any breastfeeding or parenting-of-infants) support.  I did.  And I&#39;m hugely grateful that not everyone had an alcoholic parent from which she needs recovery assistance!<br/>
<br/>
When people have had a horrible accident, they often speak fondly of how much they learned, and it can almost seem that they wish others would have horrible accidents, too.  (Maybe that&#39;s just my personal perception.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad there are cool alternative schools, though, because it&#39;s good for people to see and learn about how learning is different with different treatment of the children, and it&#39;s good for people to have choices.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad unschooling works so well for so many families, and I&#39;m glad people on this list are willing to help keep clear information flowing, so thanks, Jess, for being one of them.<br/>
