with a few extra pieces, you can 1. play GameBoy games on the  <br/>

No opinion on Xbox, we don&#39;t own one and have never used one.<br/>

If you have a used game store, like Game Stop or EB World, you could  <br/>
try those for cheaper systems. They usually have a decent return  <br/>
policy for used equipment. They also sell refurbished ones which are  <br/>
cheaper than new. Or, watch the ads at Toys R Us and Best Buy and  <br/>
such, they&#39;ll sometimes toss in controllers or games as a bundle.  <br/>
Also, our local Target was selling PS1&#39;s pretty cheap but it&#39;s an  <br/>
older system and it may be harder to find games for it now.<br/>

<br/>
My daughter chose to get the GameCube originally because she liked the <br/>
games that are only available for the GameCube: Kirby, Mario, Animal <br/>
Crossing. At least it used to be true and maybe still is that GC has <br/>
more games for kids and preteens and XBox for teens and adults.<br/>
<br/>
She eventually bought a PlayStation 2. She liked the Spyro games for a <br/>
while. Now about the only thing that&#39;s played on it is DDR. But it&#39;s <br/>
used *a lot* for DDR :-)<br/>

<br/>
We have a GameCube too. One of the coolest features is that you can buy <br/>
a screen that attaches to the box, so you don&#39;t have to have a TV to <br/>
play it. It&#39;s also VERY car-friendly---with that screen and all---and a <br/>
battery adapter-cord thing. The games are tiny though!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We bought ther X-Box first. BAAAAD move! The games for the X-Box were <br/>
way over his head (we got it when he was six). I&#39;d asked several <br/>
people, and one of the adult gamers said that X-Box was THE best! Maybe <br/>
for him and other adults! But for a little six year old, the game <br/>
selection was crap! They&#39;ve gotten better over the years, but I still <br/>
wouldn&#39;t start with that.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve found that PS2 has the best selection of games. Mostly Duncan <br/>
plays those at friends&#39; houses---and they can play his two systems when <br/>
they&#39;re here.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Game Cube because of its portability. GREAT for those long <br/>
car trips to *conferences*! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903362112">We have Gamecube, PS2, X-Box and Gameboys.<br/>
 <br/>
We bought the PS2 first because of the DVD playing capability,  it was fine but then quickly picked up a refurbished Gamecube from Gamespot.   My son really wanted to play the Zelda games, which is for Gamecube.  We have had no problems with the refurbished one.  When we bought the X-box from Bestbuy they also informed us that we can trade that one in when the new X-box comes out.  So we&#39;ll be looking into that when that happens.<br/>
 <br/>
Your kids ages might be a factor in which system you pick.  The X-box seems more geared to older kids.  Ours is mostly used for the Halos.  Although, Legos Starwars did come out for that too.<br/>
 <br/>
We also like the Gameboy Player attachment.  We had a blast with Four Swords on that.  4 people can play that together!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
We love DDR, have it for our Playstation 2,  we&#39;ve worn out 1 mat already.  :D  Quite the workout!<br/>

Yep, and through Gamespot online. Our refurbished Gamecube came from there.  Going through the mail didn&#39;t hurt it a bit.<br/>

It is the back of my mind and has moved from up &quot;Christmas&quot; to &quot;Let me <br/>

Well that&#39;s a whole nother expensive thing, so never mind.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
If you think of it in terms of how many movies it would get or how many  <br/>
hamburger meals or trips to whatever-he-does, it might seem more &quot;in the budget&quot;  <br/>
(or not, I know).  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been saving money by getting iTunes.  I don&#39;t even have an iPod,  but <br/>
for 99 cents I can get a song (and listen to clips of several others while  I&#39;m <br/>
looking, and move it onto a CD, and NOT go and buy a whole CD to get a song  <br/>
(as I have done, oh, a hundred times in my life overall I guess).    I&#39;ve only <br/>
downloaded maybe 40 songs in six months (&quot;me&quot; meaning mine and Marty&#39;s  and <br/>
Holly&#39;s picks).  In that time I&#39;ve bought several fewer CDs than I have  in any <br/>
six month period for years.  Partly coincidence maybe, but partly  just <br/>
knowing it&#39;s there and I could go and get a song.<br/>
