The underlying issue, I think, is how damaging it can be to compare  <br/>
children, to decide that one child is doing &quot;better&quot; and that the  <br/>
other child is therefore somehow deficient. And this is damaging to a  <br/>
child whether he is the better one or the deficient one. And it is  <br/>
damaging to our relationships with our kids if we&#39;re thinking in  <br/>
these terms even in subtle ways. Or so it seems to me.**<br/>
<br/>
I really liked the way you explained this, Su.  I was really reading your whole post with enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line for me, is that I think it can be positive if we compare a child, with himself at an earlier age, and feel excited about new skills.  But comparisons with others or with a benchmark seem to stir up unpleasant feelings.<br/>
