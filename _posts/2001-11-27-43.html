that&#39;s what I meant. I&#39;ve had a couple of friends with kids who were underweight 
and needed medical intervention in order to eat or digest properly. That&#39;s just 
my usual caveat thrown in there. Most &quot;scrawny&quot; kids are wonderfully normal and 
probably a lot stronger, pound for pound, than I am!</font></span></div>
