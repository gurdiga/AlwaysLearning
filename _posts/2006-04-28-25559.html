<div id="ygrps-yiv-572905425">S, I don&#39;t know if there is anything that can be<br/>
&quot;done&quot; to &quot;get them to stop,&quot; besides something<br/>
authoritarian, but I recently read a comment about<br/>
cussing in Kurcinka&#39;s &quot;kids, parents, and power<br/>
struggles&quot; that struck me. I had been on the fence<br/>
about language before reading her explanation of it as<br/>
suppressing or stifling (I forget which word she used,<br/>
sorry!) emotions. I can have a pretty foul mouth<br/>
myself and can only thank my protective deities that<br/>
galen&#39;s worst so far are &quot;dammit!&quot; (always used<br/>
correctly, lol) and &quot;butthead&quot; (which I can&#39;t think of<br/>
when he heard that one, but it was probably me :S). I<br/>
realized that although it feels in the moment like a<br/>
release of tension, my verbal explosions really don&#39;t<br/>
express my needs and therefore block communication<br/>
that could actually improve my situation (seems<br/>
obvious now). this gave me an edge on motivating<br/>
myself to hold my foul tongue and instead try to<br/>
express my need, through tightly clenched teeth if<br/>
necessary. it&#39;s a process :)<br/>
<br/>
so perhaps that explanation could help; it&#39;s wordy and<br/>
intellectual, so for too young of a child it&#39;s no<br/>
good; I don&#39;t remember what age child you were asking<br/>
about. for my 3 y.o. ds (almost 3.5 y.o.) I just say<br/>
&quot;words like that can hurt people&#39;s feelings. if I say<br/>
that you can remind me that it&#39;s not ok&quot; or something<br/>
similar. this may not be the best thing to say, but so<br/>
far it has always been something I know he learned<br/>
from me, so that&#39;s my best effort so far. I ignore as<br/>
much as I can, too. if he&#39;s playing by himself and<br/>
mutters dammit under his breath, there&#39;s no logic in a<br/>
mini-lecture (well, there may not ever be logic in any<br/>
lecture, but that&#39;s another topic) on how that could<br/>
bother someone-- he knows no one is around!<br/>
<br/>
otoh, does it really matter? understanding what it is<br/>
you want stopped, and WHY, is probably very important<br/>
to the HOW. are we talking about strings of extreme<br/>
expletives in public? offending grandma/grandpa? or is<br/>
it only at home, but you&#39;re worried about the public?<br/>
or is it just your nerves that are rattled by it? who<br/>
is the modeler of foul language in your house, from<br/>
whom this has been learned? has that modeling stopped?<br/>
all this comes into play...<br/>
<br/>
and congrats on c&#39;s arm movement!! I&#39;m sure no amount<br/>
of praise you could have heaped on her could hold a<br/>
candle to how she felt about it! :D WOOHOO!!!<br/>

words as just more of the hundreds of thousands of words they know  <br/>
and use.  There are lots of times when one level of language is more  <br/>
appropriate than another.  People talk to their grandmothers  <br/>
differently than they talk to their friends while they&#39;re playing.   <br/>
People might use a different tone and vocabulary to talk to the  <br/>
neighbor than they would if they were sitting next to the governor at  <br/>
dinner.  Explaining physics to a four year old would take different  <br/>
vocabulary than discussing it among physicists.<br/>
<br/>
All that is a big part of the flexibility and beauty of language.<br/>

other than in their own slangy vulgarity-filled way. They seem to  <br/>
know that it probably isn&#39;t appropriate for speaking to their  <br/>
economics professor, but they&#39;re nearly tongue-tied and the  <br/>
vulgarities slip out in spite of their attempt to not do it.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for them - I guess either their parents must speak that  <br/>
way too, all the time, or they talk to their parents so little that  <br/>
the parents&#39; influence is absent. It is a serious handicap.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, you&#39;re right.<br/>
I meant ideally, people who are being good and considerate with  <br/>
language.  With or without &quot;bad words,&quot; there are different levels of  <br/>
courtesy and formality.  And those who CAN do that can also know when  <br/>
and where which words are appropriate or not.<br/>
<br/>
Simply having rules or training against &quot;bad language&quot; doesn&#39;t in  <br/>
itself make someone courteous with language, as I should&#39;ve said more  <br/>
clearly and as your example showed.<br/>
<br/>
Bad grammar can be a problem too. I&#39;m working part time for an  <br/>
attorney doing family law.  I was asked to assess someone last week,  <br/>
after a phone call, as to the odds of success of an interstate  <br/>
custody move.  A child was brought from another state to New Mexico  <br/>
and was saying with high-class-family relatives.  Law enforcement  <br/>
would be likely to trust a long-established local family in a small  <br/>
town over some young ex spouse from out of state.  Aside from the  <br/>
question of the relative power of legal documents from this state and  <br/>
that, the question was whether it seemed worth it for them to drive  <br/>
ten hours to pick her up if the local police weren&#39;t obligated to  <br/>
assist them remove the child from that home.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion wasn&#39;t the deciding factor, but it was one among some.   <br/>
The mom&#39;s boyfriend had taken the phone away from here and inserted  <br/>
his opinion.  He sounded redneck/biker, hot-headed, expecting a  <br/>
physical altercation (or seemed to be assuming or hoping for one) and  <br/>
both his tone and his language useage were nervous-making.  He would  <br/>
have very negatively impressed the local police in the town in question.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just one more example for the general considerations.  Even  <br/>
without bad language, someone can make so bad an impression that  <br/>
things (big things) won&#39;t go easily in his favor.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a matter of a personal prejudice on my part, either.  It  <br/>
involved considerations of where the girl&#39;s father was, how connected  <br/>
he was, how very reasonable his relatives were being, and how the  <br/>
mom&#39;s team (she and the boyfriend) were coming across.  The girl will  <br/>
be back with her mom a few days or a week later than it might  <br/>
otherwise have been.  And honestly I have no idea whether that&#39;s what  <br/>
the girl wants, poor thing.  She might be happy where she is, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not going to matter.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling aside, I wish people in general could be more considerate  <br/>
and respectful and supportive of children.  It is WONDERFUL for me to  <br/>
have people like this list to read/hear to know that there are lots  <br/>
of families where things are better than average (and sometimes  <br/>
better than GREAT!)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not directed at this poster, but neither of those two scenarios are true<br/>
here with us (parents speak that way all the time, or child talks so little<br/>
to the parents that their influence is absent) but my oldest still may be<br/>
thought of this way...handicapped by his &quot;vulgarity-filled&quot; language.<br/>
<br/>
Because he looks fully like an adult too (he&#39;s only 17), he is often given<br/>
very dirty looks by people thinking he is vulgar or  inappropriate<br/>
intentionally.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not seen him going for either of those when he gets on a swearing roll.<br/>
<br/>
I feel bad for him too, though not because he is still figuring out the<br/>
social norms, but because he is so misunderstood and judged by many around<br/>
him. The people who don&#39;t negatively judge him at his age now, are few and<br/>
far between, but I&#39;ll tell you they are angels in society...people who TRULY<br/>
seek to understand and specifically hold back judgment, at least in the<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
And ds is slowly, slowly getting it. I just wish I could protect his soul<br/>
along the way. I&#39;m not sure how helpful the looks of scorn were/are for<br/>
him...he usually did not know why people would get mad at him...it was much<br/>
more helpful for him to get information...&quot;when you say the &quot;f&quot; word, it<br/>
makes me think you can&#39;t think of a more interesting way to say that&quot;...or<br/>
&quot;the &quot;f&quot; word bothers me, would you mind not using it around me? Thanks&quot;.<br/>

Can you maybe talk to him about it in historical terms, like WWII— <br/>

that&#39;s part of the problem that came of women in the workplace,  <br/>
honestly.  Men were trained not to use that language in the presence  <br/>
of women, and so they didn&#39;t want women invading their space.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of it in the context of &quot;long ago&quot; might keep him from  <br/>
thinking it&#39;s about him, or something modern and particular to his  <br/>
generation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, defending him as &quot;only 17&quot; doesn&#39;t seem right.<br/>

hand, we need to do whatever it takes to protect him from things that aren&#39;t<br/>
good for him, and sometimes straight out rules might do that. But it never<br/>
really made sense to do that with him. He has a strong need to understand<br/>
the reasons for things, certainly &quot;rules&quot; if we were to impose them, and if<br/>
the explanation doesn&#39;t make sense to him, it is almost impossible it seems<br/>
for him to follow the rule. Probably makes sense for a lot of us.<br/>
<br/>
He has no problem following rules or principles that make sense to him so<br/>

reading rarely negatively affects others within earshot.<br/>

Thinking of other analogies�drinking out of an open cup without  <br/>
spilling, driving a car, riding a bike�if something is potentially  <br/>
damaging to oneself or others, should we expect better of a 25 year  <br/>
old than 17?  If a 17 year old can&#39;t drive safely, he will lose his  <br/>
license.  If someone can&#39;t drink out of an open cup yet, I have cups  <br/>
with lids and can stick a straw in it and not make any big deal about  <br/>
that.  If someone&#39;s not a competent bike rider, it&#39;s best to stay in  <br/>
the yard or driveway or be on the street only when an adult is  <br/>
running along or riding beside.  Doesn&#39;t matter how old he is.<br/>

woman two seats over from me apparently had Tourette&#39;s and kept  <br/>
saying two word things, full voice and louder, and it was very, very  <br/>
distracting.   It probably wasn&#39;t any better for her to be doing that  <br/>
in such a full theater than if I had kept shining a light every few  <br/>
minutes or honking a horn or something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52201544">Well these are certainly interesting thoughts Sandra. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Ds KNOWS there are people&#39;s sensitivities to certain words, but because it<br/>
makes no sense to him that people would get offended about a word,<br/>
especially if the word was not used against anyone (he doesn&#39;t swear AT<br/>
people), he doesn&#39;t quite get it. Yet.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem like an arrogance thing but it really isn&#39;t. It is purely a<br/>
logic thing. He proceeds with logic and has had to kindof learn<br/>
intuitiveness with people, and ability to read body language and such. But<br/>
its coming.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Maybe you could tell him that if he doesn&#39;t know when to use bad<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He has the information that not many jobs would allow swearing, and he knows<br/>
not to swear during an interview, or when around children, so he really is<br/>
getting it, over time. Just not all the time in public yet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Maybe that  could  be a case for a rule, then.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I would discourage playing in the street or in the driveway MUCH more<br/>
&gt;&gt;strongly than I have with my three.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh he has had things told to him MUCH more strongly than my other three.<br/>
That&#39;s for dang sure :o)<br/>
<br/>
At his age now, I could no better tell him what words to choose and what not<br/>
to choose than I could what to think. Or maybe it is that I don&#39;t want<br/>
to...don&#39;t think it is right, or what is best.<br/>
<br/>
I DO tell him what works for people in general and what doesn&#39;t. In many<br/>
different ways, including ds having the experience itself of people&#39;s<br/>
response around him. He&#39;s slowing getting it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m trying to compare it to not reading, but it&#39;s not working for<br/>
&gt;&gt;me.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is a very apt comparison.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t mind that a kid doesn&#39;t read until he&#39;s a teen.  Not<br/>
&gt;&gt;reading rarely negatively affects others within earshot.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just how negatively can words spoken to other people effect a bystander? I<br/>
don&#39;t think too much, really. If anything, it is more an  inconvenience to<br/>
how they have their preferences set.<br/>
<br/>
And how can we know how each person&#39;s preferences are set? Some people are<br/>
fine with freedom of speech, some aren&#39;t. I&#39;m not ready to force conformity<br/>
to some people&#39;s preferences. But I am fully prepared to continue to give<br/>
the true information of the matter...that some people don&#39;t like cussing.<br/>
And that some people see cussing as a &quot;dumbed down&quot; way to talk.<br/>
<br/>
What is important, imho, is if a person IS offended, they ask for it to<br/>
stop. And if a person is asked to stop, they should stop. Ds stops in a<br/>
heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
This issue IS like the person who starts reading at a later age imo...that&#39;s<br/>
when they&#39;re ready. Even though ds LOOKS old enough to have his language<br/>
always socially appropriate, he doesn&#39;t yet. I can&#39;t push the river, I need<br/>
to take it just like I took reading, toileting, etc...lots of modeling, lots<br/>
of information, even limits sometimes (you can&#39;t swear AT people, or hit<br/>
them, or put them down). Most of his behavior is completely respectful, he<br/>
just doesn&#39;t see why people should be offended if he is talking to someone<br/>
in public that isn&#39;t offended by swearing, and the bystander gets offended.<br/>
Frankly, I&#39;m not quite sure myself either. Maybe THAT is the problem :o)<br/>
<br/>
And he usually does figure out if the actual person he is talking to will be<br/>
okay with it. My mother moved in with us a few months ago, and I watched ds<br/>
ease into occasional swearing with her. She has been fine with it. If she<br/>
said to stop, he would have stopped.<br/>
<br/>
DS has had to fully immerse himself in this freedom of speech to be where he<br/>
is now...inching toward balance. Putting a limit on things with him has<br/>
usually caused an intensified reaction like that of the dangling carrot. He<br/>
would have anxiety, maybe even an obsession, about doing it if he was not<br/>
allowed to do it. He has had to do it to figure it out...have experience<br/>
with it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;A<br/>
&gt;&gt;woman two seats over from me apparently had Tourette&#39;s and kept<br/>
&gt;&gt;saying two word things, full voice and louder, and it was very, very<br/>
&gt;&gt;distracting.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That Tourettes case is a tough one...on the one hand, the poor people<br/>
watching the movie who paid money...on the other hand, the poor woman who<br/>
would never get to go to a movie because of her condition.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she could start a group of people like her to have a the theatre to<br/>
themselves a couple times a month...like they have showings where you can<br/>
bring your little ones in the theatre. Everyone agrees to the chaos in<br/>
advance.<br/>
<br/>
This is definitely an example of a person who has a condition that doesn&#39;t<br/>
fit social norms. Been working on that one for many years :o)<br/>
<br/>
And one lesson I&#39;ve learned big time in this lifetime thus far is to hold my<br/>
own judgment, to be thankful for what I&#39;ve got and the problems that I<br/>
don&#39;t, and to be compassionate to the people around me who have struggles,<br/>
even annoying ones. If I was in that movie theatre, I would be likely to be<br/>
thinking, &quot;Is it more important that I hear every word during this movie, or<br/>
is it more important I support this person who obviously has hellishness in<br/>
her life way more than I will ever know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Though another option would be to get my money back and go another time,<br/>
since there weren&#39;t seats further away to move to. Then we both win.<br/>

If a child can carry a water gun around without squirting it at  <br/>

keeps squirting people in public, at inappropriate times, squirting  <br/>
their books and papers, squirting drivers while they&#39;re driving, what  <br/>
kind of mom would say &quot;No problem, let me refill that for you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If someone makes a rule of never saying no, that&#39;s as extreme as  <br/>
always saying no.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the answer is &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop,&quot; even for spouses and best  <br/>
friends and guests in the home.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just how negatively can words spoken to other people effect a  <br/>
bystander? I<br/>
don&#39;t think too much, really. If anything, it is more an   <br/>
inconvenience to<br/>
how they have their preferences set.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When we hear parents threaten to spank kids, that affects us.  When  <br/>
we heard our neighbor across the back wall (a teen) yelling at his  <br/>
younger brother, who was yelling back, it affected us.  Not as  <br/>
negatively as it affected the younger brother, but it was negativity  <br/>
and meanness and harshness that floated into our yard.<br/>
<br/>
People at a restaurant talking about puke or crap certainly affect  <br/>
people negatively, if they&#39;re trying to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Not reading doesn&#39;t make noise five or fifty feet away.  It rarely  <br/>
disturbs the peace of others.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What is important, imho, is if a person IS offended, they ask for  <br/>
it to<br/>
stop. And if a person is asked to stop, they should stop. Ds stops in a<br/>
heartbeat.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t he stop the heartbeat before that then, working on the  <br/>
assumption that until he knows that language is welcome, he might  <br/>
assume it&#39;s not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Even though ds LOOKS old enough to have his language<br/>
always socially appropriate, he doesn&#39;t yet.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s part of a larger set of assumptions and principles that  <br/>
someone shouldn&#39;t use a tool unsafely or discourteously, then an  <br/>
eight or ten year old can be counselled about not using  <br/>
&quot;motherfucker&quot; outside of a known safe area.  Or if the child isn&#39;t  <br/>
ready for one reason or another, to use it safely, he shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
allowed or encouraged to use it.  If parents condone it  <br/>
unconditionally, they&#39;ve contributed to the discomfort of others, it  <br/>
seems to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If she<br/>
said to stop, he would have stopped.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to have to ask people to stop doing things they  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have been doing in the first place.  I&#39;m sure if someone  <br/>
was throwing trash on my table at a restaurant and I asked them to  <br/>
stop they would, but why would they have thought it was okay to  <br/>
invade my space in the first place?  There is aural space too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That Tourettes case is a tough one...on the one hand, the poor people<br/>

who<br/>
would never get to go to a movie because of her condition.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a one hand or the other.  There are less crowded showings  <br/>
than late afternoon on the Friday it opened.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I was in that movie theatre, I would be likely to be<br/>
thinking, &quot;Is it more important that I hear every word during this  <br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t move away.  I wasn&#39;t &quot;supporting&quot; her, though, I was being  <br/>
inconvenienced by her (as were many other people).   It wasn&#39;t the  <br/>
best of situations.  I felt sorry for her, and she had a 12ish child  <br/>
with her who seemed used to it and not embarrassed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Though another option would be to get my money back and go another  <br/>
time,<br/>
since there weren&#39;t seats further away to move to. Then we both win.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That wouldn&#39;t have been a win for me.  We drove quite a way, and it  <br/>
was a special thing Holly had wanted, and Keith and I were both  <br/>
there.  And I wouldn&#39;t want to theater to be discouraging her from  <br/>
going.  She just might have chosen better when to go and where to sit.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that strangers shouldn&#39;t have to ask a person to learn  <br/>
how to be in public.<br/>

The students I was talking about are different - they can&#39;t do it,  <br/>
can&#39;t stop themselves. They have so little contact with anybody other  <br/>
than their friends who all talk the same way, that they can&#39;t help it  <br/>
even when they think it is inappropriate. They just sort of start  <br/>
talking and stuff comes out and they&#39;re embarrassed and they clam up.  <br/>
It is a handicap that keeps them from engaging with adults. It isn&#39;t  <br/>
ME being judgmental that is the problem - I smile and nod and respond  <br/>
no matter how they talk - it isn&#39;t that &quot;I&quot; care how they talk, it is  <br/>
that they don&#39;t feel comfortable about it and their own discomfort  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oi, Pam, I&#39;m sorry if it sounded like I was implying that. I wasn&#39;t thinking<br/>
at all about you (I imagine you only as gracious and supportive).<br/>
<br/>
The post sparked the experience that we are currently having with my guy and<br/>
this issue...there is sometimes an automatic reaction to him...not just if<br/>
he swears, but sometimes his responses are blunt (&quot;Did you like that?&quot; about<br/>
someone&#39;s performance...&quot;No.&quot;), or lack of eye contact or lack of response<br/>
at all. It&#39;s not that he hasn&#39;t been &quot;trained&quot; well enough, god knows that<br/>
we&#39;ve walked a refined line figuring out how much structure is needed when<br/>
and where. It&#39;s just where he is right now.<br/>
<br/>
And as a mother having seen the pain he&#39;s experienced because of his<br/>
eccentricities and intense health problems, I continue to have the wish for<br/>
more understanding and compassion in the world.<br/>
<br/>
And yet I understand the idea that it is our duty to not let our children be<br/>
nuisances in public...we always kept this in check as ds&#39;s parents. It is<br/>
just most difficult now that he is reaching adulthood and the influence of<br/>
parenting is less and the world is more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a young friend, he is 17, who is as you describe. My whole  <br/>
family likes him and we frequently invite him to hang out with us and  <br/>
go places with us. He is also very blunt and sometimes hurts people&#39;s  <br/>
feelings. Or he responds in monosyllables with no expression. He once  <br/>
told one of my daughters that he didn&#39;t like her. I was shocked and  <br/>
she was hurt - but, later, when we were alone, I asked him, &quot;What did  <br/>
you mean when you said you don&#39;t like Roxana?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, I  <br/>
meant I don&#39;t like her.&quot; &quot;Huh, why not?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know her well  <br/>
enough to really like her, yet.&quot; (True - Roxana hadn&#39;t been around  <br/>
him much AND she&#39;s very reserved around people she doesn&#39;t know  <br/>
well.) I asked him, &quot;Do you dislike her for some reason? Is there  <br/>
something you don&#39;t like about her?&quot; He was honestly surprised and  <br/>
said, &quot;Of course not. I don&#39;t know her well enough to like her, yet,  <br/>
that&#39;s all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told him that Roxana&#39;s feelings had been hurt. He said, &quot;But they  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have been.&quot; I said, &quot;When it comes to feelings, it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
matter what &quot;should&quot; be, it isn&#39;t a matter of logic.&quot; He said, &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t understand that.&quot; I said, &quot;I know you don&#39;t - that&#39;s why I&#39;m  <br/>
talking about it right now, to help you understand it, because I  <br/>
really like you and want you to hang around with us, but if you hurt  <br/>
one of my kids&#39; feelings, it won&#39;t work.&quot; HE said, &quot;I know you guys  <br/>
like me, but I don&#39;t know why. I&#39;m not that likable.&quot; I told him that  <br/>
it was kind of hard to say why people like other people - that it is  <br/>
made up of so many variables, but that one of the things I know my  <br/>
family really liked about him was his enthusiasm for learning new  <br/>
things and that he was fun to have around because he openly enjoyed  <br/>
things. He asked, &quot;Why would she care if I like her or not?&quot; I said,  <br/>
&quot;Hmmm, good question.&quot; And I was hard-pressed to answer it in a way  <br/>
that made sense to him.<br/>
<br/>
After more discussion, I finally told him that Roxana is sensitive,  <br/>
already, about thinking people don&#39;t like her, so, if he wanted to  <br/>
hang out with our family a lot, I&#39;d appreciate it if he&#39;d be a little  <br/>
conscious of not saying negative things to her. And I told him that  <br/>
I&#39;d tell her what he&#39;d meant when he&#39;d said he didn&#39;t like her.<br/>
<br/>
So - for the next couple of months - he was so careful that he barely  <br/>
would speak when Rox was around. Poor guy. Over time, however,  <br/>
they&#39;ve gotten to know each other and now they both like each other  <br/>
and are comfortable with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Su -- there are people who will LIKE your son for his bluntness.  <br/>
Others will find it uncomfortable. That&#39;s probably going to continue  <br/>
for his whole life. What he might need is for you to be even more  <br/>
clear with him about the consequences of more clearly inappropriate  <br/>
behaviors - like swearing in places or in front of people where it is  <br/>
clearly not acceptable. Are there times you don&#39;t go places because  <br/>
of it? Maybe make more sure he knows he&#39;s limiting his experiences.  <br/>
That is the logical reason for not doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I&#39;m thinking that it doesn&#39;t do any good to complain that  <br/>
others are noticing his inappropriate behaviors and being judgmental  <br/>
about it - as true as it is, it IS how things are always going to be.  <br/>
So that&#39;s just part of the information that he needs to learn to  <br/>
process, right? As his mom, you probably want to pinch people&#39;s  <br/>
pointy little heads off, when they glare at him. You want to say, &quot;He  <br/>
is LEARNING, give him a break!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But - you might think of those people as your aides - if you help him  <br/>
see how he is affecting other people (those who glare or move away,  <br/>
etc.), then he has the information he needs to decide how he wants to  <br/>
come across, even to strangers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778104018">Thanks for sharing that wonderful interchange with your friend Pam. That is<br/>
like many conversations we have here. Each one seems to help build that<br/>
knowledge base a little bigger and stronger. I bet you are a very<br/>
appreciated person in this fellow&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Su -- there are people who will LIKE your son for his bluntness.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah, no doubt. LOTS of people like him...some are SO delighted with him.<br/>
After all, he is a really likeable dude. Very funny in unique ways, stand-up<br/>
improv is his forte&#39;, he is loyal to people and has a very sweet heart. He<br/>
chose to go to an art school this year, and many people there put him on a<br/>
pedestal...(&quot;so unfettered, unedited&quot;). This is the first year that he has<br/>
been in a circle such as this...they so appreciate his artwork, his insight,<br/>
his writings.<br/>
<br/>
He has his first set of *real* friends too, ones who get him, appreciate<br/>
him, really like him. And they guide him when he&#39;s off...too blunt, or too<br/>
crass. They&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, that was too much!&quot; He goes out with them<br/>
independently, and they play music together on campus sidewalks, and once<br/>
took the bus to the airport so they could record the planes taking off and<br/>
landing in the background while they played music. He&#39;s really experiencing<br/>
a freedom with friends that is new and exciting, and he is engaging in the<br/>
intense creativity that he has had his whole life, only with other people<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What he might need is for you to be even more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>clear with him about the consequences of more clearly inappropriate<br/>
behaviors - like swearing in places or in front of people where it is<br/>
clearly not acceptable. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate this advice. I think we&#39;ve been clear as ice on this...can&#39;t<br/>
think of a way to be clearer.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, he doesn&#39;t do this when he is out with me, it is mostly<br/>
when he is out with his friends, or by himself...both things are new to him,<br/>
and he&#39;s learning another set of life lessons...ones that I don&#39;t have so<br/>
much control over. But the environment and the people in it are his primary<br/>
teachers right now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Are there times you don&#39;t go places because<br/>
&gt;&gt;of it? Maybe make more sure he knows he&#39;s limiting his experiences.<br/>
&gt;&gt;That is the logical reason for not doing it.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I will absolutely not take him places where swearing won&#39;t work unless<br/>
he agrees not to. Depending on how much he&#39;d want to go there, he will agree<br/>
or not go. I personally don&#39;t care about swearing, and would feel<br/>
hypocritical if I told him he could not swear around me. We have tried that<br/>
in exercise though, to practice carefully choosing his words, not<br/>
swearing...he CAN do it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of a way to &quot;make more sure he knows&quot; he is limiting his<br/>
experiences... I continue the dialogue, the processing, the pointing out<br/>
what happened because of this or that, why it happened, how it could be<br/>
better next time. It is what we do regularly. I&#39;ve learned that he will be<br/>
sure to know something when it&#39;s right for him, and I do what I can to get<br/>
him there.<br/>
<br/>
The other part to this statement &quot;he&#39;s limiting his experiences&quot; is a pretty<br/>
complex idea, that without him feeling like his experience is limited, I&#39;m<br/>
not sure he would even believe it. *I* may think he is limiting his<br/>
experiences, but his actual experience may be perfectly fine for him right<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Anyway - I&#39;m thinking that it doesn&#39;t do any good to complain that<br/>
&gt;&gt;others are noticing his inappropriate behaviors and being judgmental<br/>
&gt;&gt;about it&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA! It did me a world of good! (kidding, kidding). You&#39;re very right Pam,<br/>
and thank you for pointing this out to me. This list is certainly not the<br/>
place to blather about wrongs done to my son, or the pain involved in<br/>
navigating with this personality type in the world. So sorry. Thanks for<br/>
pointing it out...I didn&#39;t see it before.<br/>
<br/>
People as aids in this process is a wonderful way to think about it too.<br/>
Thanks for that. It is the people who have given us so much to talk about<br/>
and process.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your response!<br/>

difference between someone else&#39;s responses being reasonable and to  <br/>
be expected, based on his behavior, versus when it is totally just  <br/>
the other person being a jerk.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m driving along and suddenly dart into the next lane and someone  <br/>
has to hit the brakes to keep from rear-ending me -- they might glare  <br/>
at me or shake their fist or worse. It wouldn&#39;t help me if someone  <br/>
said, &quot;That guy is a jerk.&quot; (Even if he IS overreacting.) Better for  <br/>
someone to say, &quot;You cut that guy off, that&#39;s why he&#39;s angry.&quot; And  <br/>
maybe add, &quot;You never know when the person you cut off might be a  <br/>
real jerk or even dangerous.&quot;<br/>
