<div id="ygrps-yiv-525730930">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s raining today.<br/>
<br/>
As for my intensity, I&#39;m the mellow parent. Tim however is intense. He is<br/>
working on this. We have Raising your Spirited Child. I&#39;ll reread it again. <br/>
<br/>
Riley looks 7-8. He&#39;ll be 6 in January. He&#39;s 60 lbs and can run with the big<br/>
kids. He does not sit well when mad. Never has. He needs outdoor space and to<br/>
be alone. Dar knows him a little. I also have Tessa, 3. She does need to be<br/>
carried. As for rehashing the party, the kids talk about it. It gets brought<br/>
up casually on the block. Writing here has kept me from talking to my hubby<br/>
about it as much. So this year we have talked less. This year Riley has not<br/>
shed as many tears. What I mean by scarred is Riley will still cry about being<br/>
left out from last year&#39;s party. This is his reaction. This is his reality.<br/>
I&#39;m asking for help to comfort him. And to help him cope with dissapointments<br/>
in general. I&#39;m seeing a trend in his behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of 2 wolves. I feed my kids love and nurish them. I show<br/>
kindness. My neighbor is not showing him kindness.</div>

<br/>
That&#39;s not her job, though.   And when he&#39;s matured some and gained tools to <br/>
help him cope with glitches, they might  like him better than anyone.  He <br/>
might marry their daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly still remembers that a little girl at McDonald&#39;s once made fun of her <br/>
name.  She remember little slights from years back, but because she reminds <br/>
herself, and collects them.  So I figure my job is to say something that will <br/>
advance her thinking.   So if she says &quot;Remember that girl who made fun of my <br/>
name?&quot; I say something like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you still remember,&quot; or &quot;I wonder if <br/>
people had made fun of her name,&quot; or &quot;I hope she remembers and she felt bad <br/>
and never did it again.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really think looking older than their biological age can make things<br/>
hard for kids. No one ever thinks Rain is 9, and ever since she was a<br/>
baby she&#39;s looked older than she is - and often people have inappropriate<br/>
expectations because of  it. <br/>
<br/>
Rain had a really hard time dealing with life from about 5 1/2 to 6 1/2.<br/>
She kicked me, she hit me, she spit at me. She also drew pictures of<br/>
people she was mad at (usually me) being burned at the stake, impaled by<br/>
arrows, shat upon, and so on - I actually preferred this to being<br/>
attacked. It was a really frustrating time, and I really appreciated the<br/>
people in my life who could cut her a little slack, and I was really<br/>
frustrated by people who would say things like &quot;Well, I just wouldn&#39;t<br/>
permit that kind of behavior&quot; - like I had told her sure, go ahead and<br/>
kick me. <br/>
<br/>
I just kept trudging on, removing her from the situation if she got<br/>
violent, agreeing that something was unkind (although she&#39;d sometimes get<br/>
mad because I wasn&#39;t as intense as she was when I talked about things -<br/>
yelling helped, not at her but at whatever situation she was upset about,<br/>
in private). I made mistakes, most notably when I&#39;d get really frustrated<br/>
and say, &quot;Well, that&#39;s life, *deal* with it&quot;, since she was clearly<br/>
telling me that she couldn&#39;t deal with it by herself then. It began to<br/>
get better at around 6 1/2 and now she&#39;s amazingly even-keeled at almost<br/>
10, although she threw pennies at me a couple of weeks ago when she was<br/>
mad at me. I&#39;m still amazed, though, at how much easier life is for her<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
And Riley&#39;s been perfectly fine and kind when we&#39;ve seen him at the park<br/>
or tennis - not that I doubt what you&#39;ve said, but he doesn&#39;t strike me<br/>
as the kind of kid you wouldn&#39;t want to invite over because you thought<br/>
he&#39;d trash the house. Y&#39;all are welcome to come up here anytime...<br/>

It might not be the host mom or the birthday girl that is the motivating<br/>
force behind the exclusion.  It might be one of the other guests holding<br/>
a grudge and pulling some kind of a queen bee stunt.  I think many of us<br/>
have met girls in school who would insist that their friends not be<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130059509">Thank you Dar,<br/>
<br/>
yup, Riley is a kid who when losses it is very intense. I can  not carry him.<br/>
What seems trivial to you and me, like being the only kid on the block not<br/>
invited to a party, sends him into rages. I look back to his 2nd year. He<br/>
threw 2-4 big tantrums a day for 18 days in a row. I wrote about them to get<br/>
perspective, to see what may be triggering them. Now at almost 6 he has a few<br/>
a week. Yesterday was a bummer day for him. The rain cancelled our activity<br/>
with friends. He was a bit stir crazy and flipped out because he wanted to<br/>
make 6 baskets in a row. He pounded the wall, wanted to hit me, slammed doors.<br/>
Later, he wanted more turns at jump rope. Everyone else was finished playing.<br/>
I had the others give him more time, but still he wailed for more. I can not<br/>
spin both sides of the rope to satisfy his needs. <br/>
<br/>
Mostly I think I&#39;m just venting. It gets tiring and I lose my love of<br/>
parenting when I have to deal with being hit and I feel a bit helpless. I do<br/>
not want to yell, punish, or otherwise make the situation more negative. Yet I<br/>
want him to gain control of his actions. I do not want a 10-12 year old who<br/>
thinks it&#39;s ok to strike his mother because he can not do what he expects. I<br/>
really do not want a 6 year old striking out at me. It puts me in an<br/>
uncomfortable situation. Is there anyone out there who deals with a kid like<br/>
this. What do you do when they start lashing out? <br/>

<br/>
You can tie the rope to something (even if you have to get a longer rope) and <br/>
turn one end.  We did that lots when I was little.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I do not want a 10-12 year old who<br/>

Ten year olds aren&#39;t like six year olds.    Kids grow out of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really do not want a 6 year old striking out at me. It puts me in an<br/>
uncomfortable situation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should talk to your neighbor one day when you&#39;ve built up enough <br/>
calm and patience to get through the conversation, and ask her if it&#39;s <br/>
because of his behavior, and give her a chance to tell you stories if she <br/>
wants to.   I can&#39;t help but think if he hits his mother he hits other people <br/>
too.  If she has stories to tell, just hear them, don&#39;t defend him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I look back to his 2nd year. He<br/>
threw 2-4 big tantrums a day for 18 days in a row. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a nephew who cried almost constantly when he was little and they <br/>
discovered one of his testicles growing in a spiral way, tightening up all <br/>
the time, hurting him all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you had him checked to see if there&#39;s something physical keeping him in <br/>
pain?  He wouldn&#39;t know it was pain if it had been a constant in his life.   <br/>
<br/>
What about allergies?  Is he hypoglycemic and needs more protein?  Some kids <br/>
like carbohydrates and not protein, but maybe you can find something he will <br/>
eat--peanut butter or boiled eggs or SOMEthing, if it might be that.   Eating <br/>
more protein doesn&#39;t take a doctor&#39;s visit to initiate.<br/>
<br/>
Are the tags in his clothes bothering him?  Are his socks bothering him?  <br/>
Would he do better with all cotton than polyester?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684906583">Mary --<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me you&#39;re asking several things at once.<br/>
<br/>
ONE is just for some understanding - it helps to know that there are other <br/>
people out there with very intense, easily agitated, explosive kids -- it <br/>
especially helps to know that there are those of us out here whose kids <br/>
were VERY much like that when they were young and they&#39;ve grown up into <br/>
wonderful teens and young adults. I think it is very very scary when your 6 <br/>
yo can&#39;t handle the day-to-day normal frustrations that other kids seem to <br/>
shake off so easily - partly because you imagine them as teenagers or <br/>
adults and behaving the same way. There ARE people who are like that - road <br/>
rage is real, for example. But it isn&#39;t a foregone conclusion. Roxana is <br/>
now 15 and a delightful person who goes to college and functions perfectly <br/>
well - better than most people in the world, imho. When she was 6, she was <br/>
in school and her teachers&#39; goal for the SCHOOL YEAR was for Roxana to be <br/>
able to go for one full school day and not have a complete meltdown. I&#39;m <br/>
telling you this so that you know that I really DO know what you&#39;re dealing <br/>
with - I&#39;ve really been there - and everything turned out just fine for us.<br/>
<br/>
Second - you want help/advice etc on how to handle him. You&#39;ll get lots - <br/>
I&#39;d do just what you are doing - listen and sort through it and try out <br/>
what seems like it might be useful and ignore the rest.  Read and read - <br/>
read all those books people have suggested - The Explosive Child, etc. Take <br/>
what you can from them - don&#39;t follow ANY of them slavishly (I know you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
Third - this is hard for me to say but I earned the right to say it since I <br/>
dealt with it too -- don&#39;t blame OTHER people for not wanting your son <br/>
around. YOU find him difficult and you love him as nobody else ever will. <br/>
They don&#39;t want him around (even with you there) because they are worried <br/>
about the possibility of him being disruptive. Don&#39;t blame them. In fact, <br/>
you ought to appreciate that this is really important feedback for you and <br/>
your son to have. He may be a bit young now, but I would not hide it from <br/>
him that his explosive behavior is likely to result in him being excluded. <br/>
Its a choice he needs to learn to make and a reality he needs to know about.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth - DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE his intense nature. It is hopeless anyway and <br/>
why would you want to do that? He&#39;s going to be an intense person. Help him <br/>
find ways to BE intense - for example, help him take that anger and direct <br/>
it to the real injustices of the world and give him something productive to <br/>
DO about them. Not just occasionally - but a lot of time spent on this. He <br/>
needs it. He&#39;s intense. He probably needs to do a lot more of this kind of <br/>
thing than most other kids. Don&#39;t think he&#39;s too young. Intensity can be <br/>
expressed in athletics, arts, etc. Help him find LOTS of ways to be extreme <br/>
and explosive and intense - ways that people might even ADMIRE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Fifth -- his relationship with his older sister probably stinks. It is <br/>
really really hard for these kids to deal with the kid who is slightly <br/>
older and always slightly ahead - getting to do more things, able to do <br/>
more things. They hate it and react badly and seem irrational to the <br/>
sibling who responds by not caring as much about them as they should. You <br/>
REALLY have to bring his sister on board in recognizing the specialness of <br/>
your son and vice versa. They have to learn to appreciate each other. You <br/>
can help both of them understand each other better.<br/>

I was just thinking last night about how totally calm and patient Kirby is <br/>
now.  His plans for a weekend in Denver are falling through, and he just <br/>
calmly told me &quot;I&#39;ll be disappointed if I don&#39;t get to go.&quot;   He spilled <br/>
chocolate milk in his computer keyboard a week ago.  Washing it didn&#39;t help.  <br/>
He&#39;s calm.  He&#39;s not whimpering for a new one (a friend is going to get him <br/>
one, he said; if not we can take him to get a used one, and if he doesn&#39;t go <br/>
to Denver he can afford a new one).<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, he would go ballistic over a broken video game controller, even if <br/>
it was an extra, even if he had just broken it himself by dashing it on the <br/>
floor in frustration.   And I would try to arrange for him not to break OTHER <br/>
things, try to distract him into something soothing (food, water-play, <br/>
shower, car trip...) and I would get another controller SOON.  Same day maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Did that spoil him?  Not a bit.  Had I added deprivation to deprivation, he <br/>
would probably not be nearly as patient as a sixteen year old.<br/>

physically attacked me. In my experience working with<br/>
emotionally/behaviorally disturbed children, I also got this - they<br/>
didn&#39;t feel safe exploding at home, but they felt safe exploding at<br/>
school because they knew we would be there and listen and not hit them.<br/>
So the year Rain was in kindergarten and I taught E/BD kids I got<br/>
exploded at all day long and drank wine in a box every evening...<br/>

When my older kids were little and I was going through a divorce, we had<br/>
some times where my son repeatedly tried to hit or kick me when he was<br/>
angry.  I believe he was five then.  I would hold him firmly to myself in<br/>
a type of bear hug where he could not get any momentum in his swings and<br/>
tell him that I was NOT going to let him hurt me.  I told him that I knew<br/>
he was angry but he did not have the right to hurt me when expressing his<br/>
anger.  Sometimes it would take quite a while for him to calm down but I<br/>
knew I could wait him out.  I tried to let him know that I loved him no<br/>
matter how he was feeling but I absolutely would not tolerate hurting the<br/>
people we care about.  It also seemed to help me from wanting to strike<br/>
back.  It worked for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600666215">Hi Mary<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you posted about this, sometimes I feel like I&#39;m the only parent <br/>
dealing with an intense child.  Lanora (12) was like this, although she <br/>
didn&#39;t hit.  She would scream and cry for 1/2 an hour or more, would not <br/>
accept comfort but wanted me near.  I would just sit with her and wait.  Now <br/>
she understands her feelings and knows how to control them; she is a calm and <br/>
gentle person and always a joy to be with.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan (5) is intense and physical, almost every emotion is expressed <br/>
physically.  He is gaining more and more control every day but it can seem <br/>
like an eternity. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; yup, Riley is a kid who when losses it is very intense. I can  not carry <br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt; What seems trivial to you and me, like being the only kid on the block not<br/>
&gt; invited to a party, sends him into rages.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s trivial, it&#39;s painful.  If some of my friends <br/>
were having a party and I wasn&#39;t invited I would be very hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have permanently pulled muscles from wrestling with Jonathan to <br/>
keep either himself or others safe.  LOL  Thank God he has gotten more <br/>
control as he&#39;s gotten bigger.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Mostly I think I&#39;m just venting. It gets tiring and I lose my love of<br/>
&gt; parenting when I have to deal with being hit and I feel a bit helpless. I <br/>
&gt; do<br/>
&gt; not want to yell, punish, or otherwise make the situation more negative. <br/>
&gt; Yet I<br/>
&gt; want him to gain control of his actions. I do not want a 10-12 year old who<br/>
&gt; thinks it&#39;s ok to strike his mother because he can not do what he expects. <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; really do not want a 6 year old striking out at me. It puts me in an<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable situation. Is there anyone out there who deals with a kid <br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; this. What do you do when they start lashing out? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The only effective thing I&#39;ve done is to just hold him until the rage passes. <br/>
 It&#39;s like a Hyde to Jekyll transformation!  Within just a few minutes he <br/>
becomes this peaceful, gentle and happy boy.  We can talk about what <br/>
happened, why it happened and how he can resist the urge to hit next time <br/>
while snuggling together.<br/>
<br/>
I realized a couple of things about how I, as the parent, was feeling during <br/>
these moments.<br/>
<br/>
Having been raised and indoctrinated with the &quot;spank them till they submit&quot; <br/>
mindset can cause you to question yourself.  People tend to view the parent <br/>
dealing with a child in a meltdown as ineffective and having lost control.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done it myself, looked at a kid screaming and the parent trying to talk <br/>
with them and thought &quot;Sheesh, who&#39;s in control here?&quot;  So now I see myself <br/>
from the outside and it can make me unsure of myself.<br/>
<br/>
When you parent with respect and tolerance of a child&#39;s personality and <br/>
emotions you can &quot;appear&quot; to be out of control.  Knowing that control of <br/>
another person is only an illusion helps but people will still judge.<br/>
<br/>
I just look at Lanora and remember that I could see who she was going to be <br/>
even when she screamed in my ear for 45 minutes.  I can see who Jonathan is <br/>
going to be even when he is trying to hit me.  They grow up knowing <br/>
themselves and why they feel the way they do and the rage isn&#39;t stuffed down <br/>
inside somewhere where it will do much worse damage someday.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, don&#39;t beat up on yourself.  You&#39;ll make mistakes and feel like <br/>
you&#39;re totally blowing it but you&#39;ll both make it through.  Apologize, that&#39;s <br/>
how they learn to do it and forgive each other.<br/>
