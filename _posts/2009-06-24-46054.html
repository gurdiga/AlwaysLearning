<div id="ygrps-yiv-872836106">Interesting topic! I&#39;ve been accused lately of &quot;letting myself go&quot;--by my husband, my sister, my mother, my best friend, even the last lady who cut my hair (over 8 months ago). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My terrible crime against humanity? I&#39;m letting my hair go gray. I&#39;m literally the only woman I know in my age bracket (mid-40s) who does not color her hair. Even my husband colors his beard regularly to hide the gray (which I find very sexy, but he thinks it makes him look old). We&#39;ve actually had fights about my stubborn determination to age naturally. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t care about my looks. It&#39;s just that I think I look fine the way I am. I live in jeans and T-shirts, wear very little makeup, and when I look in the mirror I think my gray streaks are pretty cool . I like my crow&#39;s feet too. I find my aging self fascinating....it&#39;s like I&#39;m conducting a science experime nt on my own head, LOL. My look at this stage of my life is &quot;aging hippie&quot;, which suits my personality very well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I wasn&#39;t expecting was the animosity from my friends and family. (Even strangers sometimes--the clerk at CVS eyed my hair and said to me , &quot;Looks like it&#39;s time for a dye job.&quot; Can you imagine??) It&#39;s almost as tho ugh my choice to embrace my looks as they are is a personal affront to everyone else. I fully expect them to stage an intervention at any moment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I am never self-deprecating in any way. (By the way, Sandra, I didn&#39;t think your comment came off that way.)  It&#39;s not really in my nature to put myself down, but more than that, I am always cognizant of the example I am setting for my teenage daughter (and all the young girls I work with). It&#39;s important to me to show my daughter that beauty is about so much more than physical appearance, and that it&#39;s okay to feel confident and present your true face to the world at every age. So few people do any more. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s just not for the faint of heart.:) <br/>

I like what you say.<br/>
Feeling strong about not self-depreciating seems to be one of the smartest thing one could do for her child.<br/>
I caught myself scrutinizing my daughter&#39;s round shape more than I would have done for my son.<br/>
This comes from media brainwashing, not my up-bringing, since my mother valued intelligence over looks and kindness over financial success, to put it shortly.Now I have to be more about celebrating the incredible intelligence and grace in my daughter&#39;s attitudes, rather than body-perfect image...How do you achieve that flawlessly though ?<br/>

a personal affront to everyone else. I fully expect them to stage an  <br/>
intervention at any moment. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do hormone therapy for menopause, either.  I figure it&#39;s just  <br/>
one more stage in a life in which I&#39;ve questioned people interfering  <br/>
with nature and instinct and hormones.  Why fight time and aging?  I  <br/>
learned to feel the hot flash coming on, know what it was, ride it  <br/>
through, and not make as small a deal of it as I could.  I slept with  <br/>
a towel on my pillow for night sweats.  Not a big deal.  Not worth  <br/>
being an experiment for the medical community about.  I&#39;ll be the  <br/>
control group; no problem! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids nursed, my boys were uncut, we embraced natural learning!    <br/>
Why would I start interfering with nature now?  (I did have myself  <br/>
surgically prevented from further pregnancy, though; tubal ligation,  <br/>
after Holly.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-the clerk at CVS eyed my hair and said to me , &quot;Looks like it&#39;s  <br/>
time for a dye job.&quot; Can you imagine??)-=-<br/>
<br/>
WTF!??<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I cannot believe that.  I can&#39;t imagine anyone in New  <br/>
Mexico saying that to anyone (unless they were hairdressers who had  <br/>
done the person&#39;s hair many times before, maybe).<br/>
<br/>
I honestly can&#39;t imagine very well at all!<br/>
<br/>
I think the grey skunk streak when aging dyed hair is growing out is  <br/>
way worse than all-grey hair.  So once that dying starts, it has to be  <br/>
maintained, I guess, unless one wants to start again with half-inch- <br/>
long grey hair.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s natural color has returned after years of us not knowing what  <br/>
her hair would look like if she left it alone.  I&#39;m fine either way  <br/>
with Holly&#39;s hair, and everyone else&#39;s hair, and mine! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith used to be blond(er) so the grey hair isn&#39;t so different from  <br/>
his other color.  Mine was dark, so it shows more, but the silver also  <br/>
finally went as long as my hair.  When it only went six inches or so,  <br/>
when I would put it up in a ponytail it looked like a brown fake  <br/>
ponytail on a grey-haired person. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of my friends have let their hair go grey when it did; many of  <br/>
them have long hair, too.<br/>
I noticed a white part on a red-headed friend the other day.  She was  <br/>
always strawberry blond.  Still, mostly.   I hadn&#39;t thought about her  <br/>
being old enough to lose that distinctive characteristic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234655205">The Tom-response to &quot;how...flawlessly?&quot; is great, and so I&#39;m repeating  <br/>
it just in case anyone missed it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-The same way you achieve flawless beauty... you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Awareness is the key. As long as you stay aware, you will act out of<br/>
that awareness, rather than your old habits. Trust that your awareness<br/>

<br/>
-=-Tom-=-<br/>
<br/>
IF it&#39;s okay not to be perfect physically, it should be just as  <br/>
acceptable not to be perfect emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
Her comes where I&#39;m in &quot;yeah, but...&quot; land.<br/>
But I&#39;m not trying to be perfect physically.  I AM trying to achieve  <br/>
optimal efficiency emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are the other way.  They don&#39;t lose sleep over having  <br/>
snapped at the hairdresser or snatching sale clothes out of the  <br/>
lighter grasp of others.  But they might become physically ill if they  <br/>
discovered they had a zit when they were going to meet someone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that for purposes of unschooling, the emotional and  <br/>
interpersonal facility is pretty important.<br/>
<br/>
Even flawless athletic health isn&#39;t a guarantee.  My friend Charlie  <br/>
Winckless has a famous sister who was an olympic rower and won  <br/>
national races (I don&#39;t have rowing-lingofacility).  She has tested  <br/>
positive for a condition that has their mother  entirely disabled.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article6523332.ece">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article6523332.ece</a><br/>
(Perhaps odd that her brother is in Albuquerque hanging around with  <br/>
people like me, but there it is--the way of the world.)<br/>
<br/>
Perfection isn&#39;t a good goal, but a touch of momentary &quot;couldn&#39;t have  <br/>
been better&quot; can be great!  I think it should be accepted as the  <br/>
uncontrolled &quot;good hair day&quot; or &quot;the other guy was a little slow that  <br/>
day&quot; that it was, because if people take full credit for everything  <br/>
they do without acknowledging other factors it&#39;s not good for their  <br/>
souls or their futures or their relationships.<br/>
<br/>
IF I had spoken words that touched hundreds, on a video that Lee made,  <br/>
Lee still made the video.  And if I&#39;m telling people what Joyce said,  <br/>
that&#39;s me and Joyce! (and Lee).<br/>
<br/>
If what Richard Prystowsky and I said one day at a conference is still  <br/>
listened to, that&#39;s because HSC hired a guy to tape it, and the guy  <br/>
liked me, and the conference let me continue to sell those tapes after  <br/>
their year was gone and they weren&#39;t even offering the really old  <br/>
recordings anymore.   AND because of the internet archives and Lee and  <br/>
Lauren knowing about them and being interested in what I was doing,  <br/>
and wanting to help me.<br/>
<br/>
Few things are done by one person in the absence of any other help or  <br/>
support.   Humility.<br/>
<br/>
Humility helps with looks and spelling and housekeeping and  <br/>
storytelling and just everything.<br/>

I didn&#39;t dye my hair for years because I (and Dave) loved the  color so <br/>
much, I was afraid it wouldn&#39;t grow back in the exact same color. It&#39;s  changed <br/>
over the years, anyway and I did have highlights put in twice, but I&#39;m  <br/>
really waiting until I go gray. I&#39;d *love* to experiment with hair color and <br/>
was  hoping the boys would be wild and crazy enough to want to color their <br/>
hair. Wyl  did, once, before he was 5 with Koolaide. The red didn&#39;t take very <br/>
well.  They both have a supply of colored hair spray, but don&#39;t use it on <br/>
their *hair*.  So, I&#39;m waiting until I&#39;m gray and then I&#39;ll try all the colors <br/>
(not at once.  probably.) I&#39;ve always thought would be cool to try.<br/>

Which reminds me, Storm wanted to spike his hair today-now  that we&#39;re <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078420172">I&#39;ve been hoping? I would have an opportunity to write this. It comes from the book Chaos by James Gleick that I&#39;m finally getting around to reading after 20 years. I love this quote and think it&#39;s really true.<br/>
This is talking about? revolutionary new science but could refer to many things.<br/>
p38.?? To some the difficulty of communicating the new ideas and the ferocious resistance from traditional? quarters showed how revolutionary the new science was. Shallow ideas can be assimilated; ideas that require people to reorganize their picture of the world provoke hostility. A physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Joseph Ford, started quoting Tolstoy: &quot;I know that most men, including those at ease with problems of the greatest complexity, can seldom accept even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to colleagues, which they have proudly taught to othes, and which they have woven, thread by thread, into the fabric of their lives&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This really reminded me of the reaction of many to unschooling when I read it.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s part of the humility problem.  If people are absolutely SURE  <br/>
they&#39;re right, it&#39;s harder for them to consider change, or even to  <br/>
make choices in that area of their life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had friends want to change--not about unschooling, but socio- <br/>
politically about something or other, or morally, and the more they  <br/>
stated their strong opinions in the past about what was stupid, and  <br/>
what they would never do in a million  years, the more trapped they  <br/>
are by their own words and posturing.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s the basis of &quot;Never say never.&quot;  Deciding in advance  <br/>
what one will or won&#39;t do chops off half  (or more) of their future  <br/>

&gt; My terrible crime against humanity? I&#39;m letting my hair go gray. I&#39;m literally the only woman I know in my age bracket (mid-40s) who does not color her hair. Even my husband colors his beard regularly to hide the gray (which I find very sexy, but he thinks it makes him look old). We&#39;ve actually had fights about my stubborn determination to age naturally. <br/>

<br/>
Now I&#39;m 22, and people usually think I&#39;m 28-30.  I don&#39;t know how much of that is my grey hair, and how much of it is the fact that I&#39;m married, have two kids, have been to college, don&#39;t live near my parents, hold a job etc.  I&#39;ve actually shown my license to prove how *young* I am. Sometimes it bugs me because I figure that when I really am 30, people will think I&#39;m 50!  But maybe by then it will be all white like Storm from the X-men.  <br/>

Being different is fun and interesting.  It&#39;s really neat when someone can be different without even trying, because everyone else is trying so hard to be the same.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708294465">-=-Hair turbibg grey is a beautiful thing.<br/>
In the book Women who run with wolves, Clarissa Pinkola Estes talks  <br/>
about all the beauty in the odd bodies; theimportance of recognizing  <br/>
grace in its different forms.<br/>
It is very true !-=-<br/>
<br/>
At the post office yesterday I almost took a picture of the whole room  <br/>
but thought some people might not appreciate that.  I myself was there  <br/>
with dirty hair in an orange t-shirt and purple jeans.  I hadn&#39;t  <br/>
noticed until I got out into the car. &lt;g&gt;  I wasn&#39;t expecting company.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually notice or think about dyed hair unless it&#39;s dayglo  <br/>
pink or cellophane blue or something.  But with this discussion in  <br/>
mind, I have a report.   Albuquerque, post office on the east side of  <br/>
town, Thursday late morning.<br/>
<br/>
Two people had dyed hair for certain.  One was a woman who was  <br/>
probably 70 or late 60&#39;s.  Her hair was dyed a light brown.  She was  <br/>
dressed conservatively.  One of the three postal clerks had her hair  <br/>
dyed dark brown.  Her face was wrinkly.  Maybe she was my age or  <br/>
older.  No grey showing in the part.  The other two clerks were male,  <br/>
one balding, one greying.<br/>
<br/>
Others were too young except for me and two other long-haired hippiesh  <br/>
types.  One man, hair to the middle of his back, balding and  <br/>
greying.   A woman, younger than I am maybe, so late 40&#39;s or early  <br/>
50&#39;s, hair to the tops of her thighs, greying.<br/>
<br/>
More people greying than dyed, in that snapshot moment.<br/>

I think that&#39;s beautiful! I&#39;ve also often been told I should dye my  <br/>
hair. I found the first grey when I was 10, and by highschool it was  <br/>
very noticable. All my friends told me I should dye it, but said that  <br/>
I didn&#39;t grow butt-length hair just to have it fried by too many dye  <br/>
jobs. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My dad&#39;s went grey when he was twenty or so.  It was salt-and-pepper  <br/>
when I knew him.  I wanted that.<br/>
There was a woman in my anthropology class in college with hair like  <br/>
that, and I was so jealous!  She would braid it or put it in twisty  <br/>
buns, and it always made patterns, like ice cream with chocolate syrup.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sometimes it bugs me because I figure that when I really am 30,  <br/>
people will think I&#39;m 50! But maybe by then it will be all white like  <br/>
Storm from the X-men. =-<br/>
<br/>
My younger sister used to be thrilled that she looked older than I  <br/>
was, when we were teens.   It stopped being thrilling when we were in  <br/>
our 20&#39;s, and now it just pisses her off. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Being different is fun and interesting. It&#39;s really neat when  <br/>
someone can be different without even trying, because everyone else is  <br/>
trying so hard to be the same. -=-<br/>
<br/>
And some try really hard to be different.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice when people can accept themselves happily and not spend a  <br/>
world of time and money and risk their health trying to be different.<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me that perhaps too much surgery could have been a  <br/>
problem for Michael Jackson.  I don&#39;t know the effects of tons of  <br/>
surgery.  I&#39;ve had a broken leg, a broken ankle, three cesareans (sad;  <br/>
I don&#39;t like to talk about that), a breast biopsy and a gall bladder  <br/>
removal (laproscopic, where they didn&#39;t cut me wholly open).  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know how many blood vessels can be cut and grow back (or not) without  <br/>
putting a strain on the circulatory system.  Maybe all of them, but I  <br/>
doubt it.  So somewhere between all and none there must be a point at  <br/>
which it&#39;s problematical.<br/>
<br/>
Totally elective surgery isn&#39;t for prolonging life, except maybe in  <br/>
those cases of suicidal thoughts about transgenderism or breast  <br/>
problems (too big, deformed, mastectomy...).<br/>
<br/>
When they were little, Marty and Kirby had seen a preview for a TV  <br/>
show (Phil Donohue, I think) about children who wanted plastic  <br/>
surgery.   They asked me very excitedly in the car, &quot;What&#39;s plastic  <br/>
surgery?&quot;   I told them and they seemed very disappointed.   I guess  <br/>
they were wondering if it was something THEY should want to have  <br/>
too!   I forgot to watch the show the next day.  We probably should&#39;ve.<br/>

Michael Jackson:  never recovered from an abusive<br/>

when he looked at the face he was born with, which is<br/>
why he mutilated it.  His plastic surgeons should have<br/>
their medical licenses pulled.  They are not supposed<br/>
to operate on mentally unstable individuals.<br/>

Joseph Ford, started quoting Tolstoy: &quot;I know that most men, including those at ease with problems of the greatest complexity, can seldom accept even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to colleagues, which they have proudly taught to othes, and which they have woven, thread by thread, into the fabric of their lives&quot;</div>

That sounds like an interesting book that would go along with what I am reading now Agnotology [The Making and Unmaking of ignorance] edited by Robert Proctor and Londa Schiebinger...What we don&#39;t know and why we don&#39;t know it. It&#39;s not one of those books about what you should have learned in school and didn&#39;t but more the control of information and the manipulation of information to create doubt and change history etc. It discusses military secrecy, Native American paleontology, female orgasm, global climate change, racial ignorance etc.<br/>
Just finished the section on the tobacco industry. I&#39;m getting into the military stuff. The military had information that it withheld from the public that would have helped confirm the theories on plate tectonics. It took some years for that information to become available for researchers.?That was mentioned in? Kuhn&#39;s book?description? that I just found on Amazon. Guess Kuhn&#39;s book needs to be next in line for me to read.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=b.<br/>
<br/>
I can see that being somewhat true, but as I read Agnotology I think it is even more complex than that. What areas get funding for research.... what is the monetarily favored areas to grow knowledge..... What falls out of fashion.....Who controls information.?I know some very complex knowledge of the people that lived before us is essentially lost. I&#39;m think of some of the agricultural practices that worked very well in the Amazon mentioned in the book 1491:New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus by Charles Mann. Some of this knowledge is being rediscovered, but I&#39;m betting a lot more has been lost. I&#39;m not sure that? science?is always advancing. It seems as if we are always losing previously well know information as we learn the new.? Our brains can only hold so much knowledge/information but I think our collective brains only hold so much knowledge/information to. <br/>
<br/>
By the way 1491 made the history I learned in school seem like some weird fabrication of reality?and I think Agnotology will explain some of that.<br/>

Another book which explores this issue is &quot;The Long Descent&quot; by John Michael Greer.   I am only up to the second chapter entitled &quot;The Stories We Tell Ourselves.&quot;  The book is actually about  peak oil but in his discussion there are parallels to thinking about life and learning. His argument goes that you can become so focused  on achieving immediate goals by familiar means (eg school and the qualifications treadmill) that you lose track of the wider context of priorities  that made those goals and means meaningful in the first place. (eg living a fulfilling life.)<br/>

Hey that embodies unschooling really well!  The really cool thing about<br/>
it, is that once you start acknowledging the wider context of things,<br/>

<br/>
This matches what Broc was saying when Lee Stranahan filmed him the  <br/>
other day, that kids in school are set on a course of levels, but  <br/>
unschoolers can either figure out how to bypass levels, or choose to  <br/>
go level by level.<br/>
<br/>
Wanting to do something and doing it is an entirely different &quot;doing&quot;  <br/>
than NOT wanting to do it, and making a half-hearted show of kind of  <br/>
doing just as little as you &quot;have to&quot; do to get to the next level,  <br/>
barely.  It&#39;s also different for go-getters who jump into a level with  <br/>
an air of competitive joy and ACE that sucker in no time flat with  <br/>
enough extra time to go to the parking lot and smoke dope and they get  <br/>
an A, a whole page of them, and get to the next level WooHOOO!   (Oh  <br/>
wait. That was me in 10th grade...)  If someone asks whether they  <br/>
wanted to do that, the answer would be an eye blink and a &#39;What do you  <br/>
mean?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And about those videos.  With trepidation, I announce one I haven&#39;t  <br/>
seen yet.<br/>
