<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546460273">We are also new to the group.  We live in California, and are learning<br/>
at home with our children Constanze 4, Robert 3, Gabrielle 7 months, and<br/>
Wesley 2 weeks.<br/>
We recently attended a homeschooling conference where I got to attend<br/>
Sandra&#39;s seminar on the practicalities of unschooling.  It was exciting<br/>
to hear someone put into words what we always new was the right<br/>
educational direction for our family.  I look forward to getting to know<br/>
all of you.<br/>
