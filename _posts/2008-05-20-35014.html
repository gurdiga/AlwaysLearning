<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788535761">It&#39;s that wonderful time of the year where we have to report to our school district.   You know <br/>
.. evaluations ... portfolios... yada yada.  Well.... has anyone here put video game type of  <br/>
learning into schoolish terms ... something that could be put in the ole portfolio? ... Like <br/>
from World of Warcraft??  I am determined that this can be done with a little thinking outside <br/>
the box.  Thought that I would start here for thoughts/ideas first in case it&#39;s already been <br/>
done.  <br/>
