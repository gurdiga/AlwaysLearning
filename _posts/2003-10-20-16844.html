Talk about uschooling or you&#39;ll be stuck with lists that flame you to <br/>
damnation for asking about teenaged boys touching themselves &quot;down there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was watching Wayne Brady&#39;s morning talk show while I was putzing around the <br/>
bedroom this morning, and a woman was on who&#39;s written a book about what our <br/>
kids are really doing and how to communicate with them.   Yeah!  Don&#39;t let <br/>
them watch the news, or watch it with them an explain.  Have lots of controls on <br/>
their internet access.<br/>
<br/>
Okay-fine, I suppose, but one story she told was of a family whose kids said <br/>
in the morning, during the Monica Lewinsky/Clinton problem, &quot;We need to talk <br/>
about this intern thing,&quot; and she says the parents worried all day about what <br/>
the kids wanted to know, and when the (I presume after-school) discussion time <br/>
came, the question was that the kids knew there were interns in hospitals, but <br/>
why were there interns in the White House?<br/>
<br/>
Not a bad question.  It&#39;s not about sex, it&#39;s not about anything but &quot;what is <br/>
an intern, anyway?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ms. On-TV-expert said &quot;I hope they said nothing,&quot; and then she acted out kind <br/>
of hemming and hawing until nothing had been said, but with eye contact.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what *I* wish:<br/>
I wish she had known enough to recommend that the thing to do was tell them <br/>
what an &quot;intern&quot; position is, that they&#39;re working internally in the business <br/>
they&#39;re studying.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an easy word for kids to figure out on their own, because at <br/>
hospitals they also have &quot;internal&quot; medicine,&quot; but that&#39;s internal to the person, <br/>
while &quot;interns&quot; are internal to the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
So the parents didn&#39;t KNOW the answer, and an expert is happy to encourage <br/>
parents just not to really answer questions kids have sat on all day after <br/>
announcing in advance. <br/>
<br/>
Those parents had all day (thought they probably thought WRONGLY that the <br/>
question was going to be about blow jobs and not about &quot;what does &#39;intern&#39; mean&quot;?<br/>
