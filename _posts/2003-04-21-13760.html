<div id="ygrps-yiv-785683596">I just got home from Easter at the in-laws.  My mil just got home for <br/>
the summer from their winter house in Florida.  She had to confront me <br/>
with how awful unschooling was and how terrible it will be for the girls <br/>
when I have to send them to school to &quot;fix&quot; what I&#39;ve done to them.  I <br/>
said, &quot;why would I have to send them to school?&quot;  Her answer was if  dh <br/>
and I died, the girls would have to go to school. I said that you can&#39;t <br/>
spend your life basing all your actions on what-ifs, that choices should <br/>
be made on what you believe in.  Then I told her that I had some great <br/>
articles and books she could read.  She said even if she read them, <br/>
she&#39;d still disagree with me.  I shrugged my shoulders and said I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t even discuss it with her until she was willing to learn more <br/>
about what we&#39;re doing.  The best part was when dh stood beind me and <br/>
backed up our decision to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Now I just have to get through the rest of the summer until she goes <br/>
back to Florida.  If only it wasn&#39;t such a small town!    HeidiC.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you handled it well, and I&#39;m glad to hear that your dh<br/>
backed you up.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me, vaguely, of a conversation I had with my brother where he<br/>
expressed the opinion that I was brainwashed, and all I could do was<br/>
sputter &quot;I&#39;m brainwashed?  Me?  I&#39;m the one that&#39;s brainwashed?  I don&#39;t<br/>
think so!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I need a more persuasive way to respond to people who are thinking<br/>
INSIDE the box.<br/>

all year, but here in Wayland, we can see their house from ours and with <br/>
dh and fil now business partners, we&#39;re going to be together a lot.  So <br/>
I stayed up last night and made a list I could e-mail for her to read <br/>
and printed out some more articles.  I have 3 John Holt books and I want <br/>
to get some of John Gatto&#39;s work.  Any other persuasive material you <br/>
could suggest, I would appreciate it.  Anything from well-known people <br/>
would be appreciated.  She respects someone&#39;s thoughts more if they are <br/>
famous.<br/>
<br/>
My mil is one of those people who LOVES to talk and talk and just knows <br/>
everything.  Her big arguements last night were that children should <br/>
always know that the parents have the authority and they shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
able to do whatever they want and that when Aislinn is with her friends, <br/>
they will ridicule for not being able to read yet and she&#39;ll be <br/>
devastated for life.  This from a woman who sent her children to her <br/>
mother for whole summers to take care of (just down the street as well) <br/>
and who would go on 1-2 months long vacations leaving her children with <br/>
a paid house sitter.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well.  I did expect it.  I&#39;m sure you have all been there.  Now I <br/>
just have to gather as much info as I can for backup.  That way I really <br/>
won&#39;t have to &quot;say&quot; anything but, &quot;here, read this.&quot;  As least that way <br/>
she can&#39;t ever try to use my own words against me or take something I <br/>
said out of context. She&#39;s pretty good at that.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness I found all of you! Thank you, thank you, thank you!   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heidi, this says it all. You know how married couples go round and round <br/>
arguing about the correct way to squeeze the toothpaste tube or if the <br/>
toilet paper roll should be hung with the flap from the front or the <br/>
back and it ISN&#39;T really arguing about toothpaste or toilet paper at <br/>
all? You can&#39;t persuade someone that you are a competent, caring, <br/>
responsible adult if what they really need you to be is an incompetent, <br/>
irresponsible child to prove to themselves that they weren&#39;t as <br/>
incompetent, uncaring and irresponsible as they suspect themselves to be.<br/>
<br/>
Keep telling yourself, &quot;It&#39;s not about me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found with some of my relatives that they are so invested in <br/>
supporting the shaky edifice of fantasy that they began constructing on <br/>
quicksand many many years before that someone else&#39;s reality has no part <br/>
in it. How could anyone get breakthrough that rationally? So, I started <br/>
asking myself, why is is important to me to change the way this person <br/>
thinks? Why do I feel I need their approval?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940738729">I told you all my mil&#39;s reaction to our unschooling.  Well, I&#39;ve been <br/>
thinking about the things she said, like being worried about what would <br/>
happen if dh and I died, when the girls would be forced to go to school. <br/>
 Now I know where she was coming from.  Let me tell you a little about <br/>
the fix we&#39;re in (kind of) then maybe you&#39;ll have some advice for me.   <br/>
This has to do with our wills and who we made legal guardians of our <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
About 6 years ago we had wills made and gave custody of all and any <br/>
children we had to my parents in case of an accident where both dh and I <br/>
died.  2 years ago, I was having big problems with my mom and felt that <br/>
her raising my kids would be a big mistake, so I asked mil and fil if <br/>
they would take on the responsibility should something happen.  We paid <br/>
to have the lawyer change our wills, but never followed through to sign <br/>
them and have them notarized.  So my parents are still legally going to <br/>
be responsible for our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, hopefully none of this will ever matter.  Neither set of <br/>
grandparents is ideal, in my opinion.   My mother will go along with <br/>
homeschooling, maybe even unschooling, but she also will use guilt to <br/>
manipulate them and her house and her life are like a tornado went <br/>
through (picture razor blades laying around, really) plus she&#39;s a big <br/>
supporter of spanking.   My mil plays with the kids a lot, but like I <br/>
said in other posts, wants to spend the majority of her time &quot;playing&quot; <br/>
her own games like golf, shopping, traveling.  She spent very little <br/>
time with her own kids.  That&#39;s where her worry is coming from, I&#39;m <br/>
sure.  What will she do if she&#39;s saddled with these kids who have never <br/>
been in school.  SHE&#39;s certainly not going to spent ever minute of the <br/>
day with them.<br/>
<br/>
What I think I&#39;m going to do is tell her that the change of the wills <br/>
were never legally finalized so she&#39;s off the hook.  And since my mother <br/>
never knew I was changing them, I just won&#39;t tell her.<br/>
<br/>
How do the rest of you handle things like this?  Is there ever anyone <br/>
good enough to raise our kids if we&#39;re out of the picture?  I normally <br/>
do not live in Whatif Land, but accidents do happen and I want to know I <br/>
did my best to ensure the girls&#39; happiness and security.    HeidiC.</div>

<br/>
Patrick & Gillian. Gillian was Cameron&#39;s thrid grade teacher. We hit it <br/>
off---and we&#39;ve all become great friends. We made it &quot;legal&quot; a few months <br/>
ago. Some of you met them at the conference last year---Gill&#39;s the tall Brit <br/>
and Patrick had the long beard and was hanging around the registration table <br/>
and at my house.<br/>
<br/>
Gillian, although still a teacher, is a huge John Holt fan and VERY <br/>
supportive of unschooling. Patrick is a sociology prof at the Uni. He thinks <br/>
school is a total waste of time! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was VERY important to me to find someone who would NOT make the boys go to <br/>
school. We have also set up a trust fund so that they have nothing &quot;out of <br/>
pocket&quot;---the boys will be financially provided for.<br/>
<br/>
So we have two teachers with the responsibility of rearing our unschooling <br/>
boys should something happen to both of us! One big happy family! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband and I changed our wills a while back and made his cousin and wife<br/>
guardians of Tim in the event it should become necessary.  When Tim was<br/>
born, it was originally my parents who were listed.  (MIL and FIL are just<br/>
too old to have ever been considered, really.)<br/>
<br/>
I grew to be uncomfortable with my mother ever being guardian, and so we<br/>
changed the wills.  Matt and Josie (cousin and wife) know, of course, but we<br/>
never told my parents.  I figured it would hurt their feelings, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
likely to be necessary, and honestly, if it was necessary, I won&#39;t be around<br/>
to deal with it.  I know the guardianship clause is strong enough to hold up<br/>
if challenged, and I think my parents would likely be relieved, though<br/>
they&#39;d never admit it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not entirely thrilled with our choice; Matt and Josie would not<br/>
homeschool, and she works as a school counselor.  However, my husband wants<br/>
to keep it in the family, and I can respect that.  These are good people,<br/>
caring and kind, who won&#39;t make the same choices I would, but I know that<br/>
Tim would be well taken care of.  At this point, that&#39;s the best I can do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333494190">I prefer my mother because I know deep down she means well.  So does <br/>
mil, but  I KNOW she will not be very involved with the girls if they <br/>
live with her.  My mother would hopefully clean up her house and her <br/>
razor blades if the girls actually lived there.  I doubt she&#39;d ever be <br/>
able to change herself though.  So it would either be guilt trips with <br/>
her or the very materialistic and uninvolved life of my mil.  A good <br/>
example would be that my sil who&#39;s single w/ one dd was dating a not <br/>
very nice dentist.  Mil told her she should stick with him even though <br/>
he was a jerk because he was a &quot;doctor&quot; and had money.  Not advice I <br/>

We really don&#39;t have anyone else who want to take on this many children <br/>
(4 so far).  We have large life insurance policies to guarantee they <br/>
would be provided for monetarily.  Anyway, I guess I just have to let it <br/>
go and not worry about it.  Live in the now.  Give them all the love I <br/>
have now.  HeidiC.<br/>

<h4>Kerrin or Ralph Taylor</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-790425132">I was just wondering...Has anyone discussed this with their children and asked who they would like to be with in the unlikely event of both parents dying? <br/>
<br/>
We have named Ralph&#39;s brother and my sister as trustees for our kids. That means that they get to make any decisions regarding the children. My sister and her husband are the ones most likely to take the kids as they are young and don&#39;t have any kids (despite years of trying). None of them, or anyone else in the family would homeschool, let alone unschool, our children. However I think they would be better off with the family that they love and who love them, even if they did have to go to school. They agree. I think family is incredibly important. My family is not without plenty of dysfunction, but the love and caring runs deep and is unconditional, so I think that is always the most important thing. I realise of course that not all families are like ours, but I disagree with putting mode of education before loving family bonds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369898913">Thank you, I need to feel rare and wonderful today.<br/>
Last evening, there was a benefit performance in Providence - it was a total fund raiser for the Station Fire Victims. I had two front row seats & back stage passes. Brianna couldn&#39;t go. She&#39;s in much pain due to a bruised tail bone. She & I got into a conversation about whether or not I should go, or more importantly - should she stay alone? I&#39;ve only ever left her for - maybe an hour - tops. And that was when I was at the market - up the street - with a cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I didn&#39;t go.<br/>
and I did feel bad - for a bit - <br/>
<br/>
The fact is Brianna is my prime responsibility - she&#39;s lots more important.<br/>
<br/>
But while we&#39;re on the subject - how old do you think a child should be before being left alone.?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - thanks,<br/>

And unschooling, fo us, is MUCH more than a &quot;mode of education&quot;. It&#39;s a way <br/>
of life that our families would put an end to quickly.<br/>
<br/>
We all choose unschooling----the lifestyle-- over hurt feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548620429">I think the issue isn&#39;t so much changing a mode of education, it&#39;s <br/>
changing a complete lifestyle, which unschooling really is.  Of course <br/>
children can overcome amazing hardships and they would overcome the loss <br/>
of their parents and having to completely change their way of life, <br/>
especially if they were surrounded by loved ones.  But I hope they won&#39;t <br/>
have to make that drastic change.  Not if I can help it.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
there will ever be a perfect choice for us.  I just want to know I&#39;ve <br/>
done the best I can.   HeidiC.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have named Ralph&#39;s brother and my sister as trustees for our kids. That means that they get to make any decisions regarding the children. My sister and her husband are the ones most likely to take the kids as they are young and don&#39;t have any kids (despite years of trying). None of them, or anyone else in the family would homeschool, let alone unschool, our children. However I think they would be better off with the family that they love and who love them, even if they did have to go to school. They agree. I think family is incredibly important. My family is not without plenty of dysfunction, but the love and caring runs deep and is unconditional, so I think that is always the most important thing. I realise of course that not all families are like ours, but I disagree with putting mode of education before loving family bonds.<br/>

&gt; Family would not even consider homeschooling <br/>
&gt;so I have chosen my best friend.  She would consider homeschooling them and <br/>
&gt;she treats them with respect and listens to what they have to say etc.  I <br/>
&gt;won&#39;t be here so I don&#39;t care if my family is hurt by the decision I have to <br/>
&gt;look out for my boys.  Family isn&#39;t always the only choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413296268">I&#39;ve left my 6 1/2 yr old alone, with my two youngest so I could walk my <br/>
5 yr old to preschool across the street.  Tops, I&#39;ve been gone about 15 <br/>
minutes.  But it really goes against all my instincts because I&#39;m a <br/>
dreadful worrier and she&#39;s not really good with the phone yet in case of <br/>
an emergency.   I&#39;m just starting to let the two older ones play alone <br/>
in the backyard, and even with that, I have to check on them every <br/>
couple of minutes just to make sure some &quot;bad&quot; man hasn&#39;t run off with <br/>
them.  See, plain old paranoid, that&#39;s me.  How old is Brianna?  How <br/>
does she really feel about being alone?  HeidiC.<br/>

&gt;Last evening, there was a benefit performance in Providence - it was a total fund raiser for the Station Fire Victims. I had two front row seats & back stage passes. Brianna couldn&#39;t go. She&#39;s in much pain due to a bruised tail bone. She & I got into a conversation about whether or not I should go, or more importantly - should she stay alone? I&#39;ve only ever left her for - maybe an hour - tops. And that was when I was at the market - up the street - with a cell phone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I didn&#39;t go.<br/>
&gt;and I did feel bad - for a bit - <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The fact is Brianna is my prime responsibility - she&#39;s lots more important.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But while we&#39;re on the subject - how old do you think a child should be before being left alone.?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway - thanks,<br/>

&gt;  &gt; &gt;We really don&#39;t have anyone else who want to take on this many <br/>

&gt;  &gt; &gt;(4 so far).  We have large life insurance policies to guarantee <br/>
&gt;  &gt; they <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;would be provided for monetarily.  Anyway, I guess I just have to <br/>
&gt;  &gt; let it <br/>
&gt;  &gt; &gt;go and not worry about it.  Live in the now.  Give them all the <br/>

&gt;  &gt; Heidi,  I lurk here and love it.  You don&#39;t know me but I&#39;ll take <br/>
&gt;  &gt; your kids if need be!!!!   Only kidding but truly, make a search. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I had the same reaction!!!!  Heidi, most of the things I have read have <br/>
&gt;  suggested NOT having grandparents as guardians, because they are likely to be <br/>
&gt;  older and not equipped to raise more kids....and this is non-homeschooling <br/>
&gt;  families. (To those grandparents raising your grandchildren: you are a <br/>
&gt;  wonderful, rare exception!)  The point is, maybe looking to friends, or <br/>
&gt;  whatever....?<br/>

  Now I say:<br/>
  Yes I totally agree with you. However I can&#39;t imagine a much bigger lifestyle change than losing both parents. There&#39;s just no way that the children&#39;s lifestyle would continue no matter who they were with. The unschooling life IS a family life for most of us.<br/>
