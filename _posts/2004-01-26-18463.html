&lt;&lt; Why do you think sexual activity<br/>
<br/>
tends to fall off after marriage?  Its no big deal...you can whenever you<br/>
<br/>
want without anybody making a deal about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s increasing thought and research into something biochemical that has <br/>
to do with mating.  We see it in other mammals all the time, but we have this <br/>
ancient tradition of denying our biological natures.    <br/>
<br/>
Seems there is brain activity that is being identified and measured and it <br/>
turns on when a person is in love and it lasts until the object of desire is <br/>
secured, and the&#39;ve nested, and it seems they could procreate, and then it starts <br/>
to wane.   There are (as with other brain-things) biochemical factors, and <br/>
re-routing in the brain (shut down logical analysis of the situation until the <br/>
goal is met) and lots of cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The first article I read I&#39;ve lost, but the guy was doing brain mapping AND <br/>
as part of his evidence collecting was gathering song lyrics and poetry written <br/>
by people who were trying to describe being in love, and looking for clues to <br/>
his theory that we really ARE different people in that state, or the same <br/>
people in an altered state.  After I read that I started listening for those <br/>
kinds of clues too.  One day in the car Holly and I were listening to a collection <br/>
of 60&#39;s stuff, and here came this:<br/>
&quot;I feel it in my fingers <br/>
I feel  it in my toes<br/>
Love is all around me<br/>
and so the feeling grows.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope he had that in his collection.<br/>
<br/>
Then a couple of months later we saw Love Actually, in which that song is <br/>
practically a main character! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the original research, but it&#39;s similar enough that after Carol <br/>
Narigon and I discussed the idea in general, she found this and sent it to me:<br/>

<br/>
(If it&#39;s not still there maybe I can cut and paste, but that&#39;s not working so <br/>
well for me today! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
