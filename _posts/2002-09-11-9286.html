<div id="ygrps-yiv-42145288">Hi Meghan and the rest of your California people (my fav place in the<br/>
world).... We are only making it to the other side of Tucson (LOL).... A<br/>
45 min drive from my family (which is a start as far as my DH is<br/>
concerned).... Closer to his new job....  Looks like a couple more years<br/>
before we make the big leap to California.... Liking the sounds of<br/>
Humboldt County....  Not taking place for another 6 months as they are<br/>
in the process of building the house.... <br/>

Hiya Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering where you had gotten to!  So where is your <br/>
moving destination and when is the event taking place?  Glad <br/>
you&#39;re back.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hiya Dawn - nice to see you back here.<br/>
Still haven&#39;t made it down to Tucson lately - and with you staying in town<br/>
maybe we could still meet up sometime, somewhere.<br/>
Maybe when it cools off - the end of summer is finally in sight .... :-)<br/>
