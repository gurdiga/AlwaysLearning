<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960046842">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
So I got really inspired the past couple of days and designed a new website/blog for myself. A place where I can write my thoughts, ideas etc. And I love it! And I was feeling really psyched about letting people know about it... until I started thinking more about what putting myself out there might mean.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the website: www.togetherwalking.weebly.com<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, my biggest hesitation is my in-laws reading and finally seeing,reading,hearing Unschooling. We will be together at Thanksgiving; my daughter is 5 and it is our first year of official homeschooling. I wrote here about a month ago about being nervous about my in-laws visiting us. Well the visit was great. But nothing was discussed. (See what I mean about worrying about things that never happen??) But at Thanksgiving my husband&#39;s Aunt and cousin will be there - his cousin was home-schooled by his Aunt till she was in the 9th grade - but it was very much school at home. So I really think that there is going to be some discussion about how things are going. <br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts about making my website &quot;public&quot;. It will be out there. I won&#39;t have to &quot;tiptoe&quot; around subjects or worry about what questions are brought up or what my daughter says about how we do things at home. <br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand - it seems kind of &quot;cold-turkey&quot; and not really a gentle introduction to the subject. I am worried that by putting the website and myself out there it could cause drama. The optimistic part of me wants to think that *if* there is drama that it will pass and at least things will be out in the open. But then I wonder if that is a simplistic view of how things will actually go down.<br/>
<br/>
I know that noone here can tell me what the &quot;right&quot; thing to do is, but I really value the experience and viewpoints from this group. If anyone has time to look at my website and tell me what they think, I would really appreciate it! Even if there are suggestions on things you would change etc. My gut is telling me to go for it, even though it is out of my comfort zone. I was even thinking of emailing family (my side and my husbands) with the address...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>

It that comes up, you could ask THEM questions.  Ask how it went, whether it was fun, whether it improve the relationship between them, whether it was always easy for him to do the work, how he felt about it.  Anything positive they say, you can smile and say &quot;We&#39;re hoping for that too!&quot; and anything negative they say, you can say &quot;Unschooling gets around that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to be on the defensive. <br/>
<br/>
Just because the blog is out there doesn&#39;t mean you need to tell them all to read it.  If they come to Thanksgiving and they want to talk about it, you could say you have a blog they could read when they get home, if they want to know more details.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814919490">Thanks Sandra! That is one reason (of many) why I love you and your voice - when I get stuck in &quot;either/or&quot; thinking you help me to see there are LOTS of options. And you are so no-nonsense, no drama! Love it :-) Anyways, I love my new website and I worked too hard on it to just let it sit - I&#39;m sharing it! Watch out world :-)<br/>
<br/>
and with that, it&#39;s time for bed so I have energy to tackle a new day tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Peace-<br/>
Susan<br/>
