<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m like this,too. I do like high-energy teachers -- but not those that have <br/>
&quot;tricks&quot; that they pull out in order to be more entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care if teachers are super well-organized. I just care that they know <br/>
stuff and can communicate it.<br/>
<br/>
So - I end up being a teacher who is like that. Not super well-organized (I <br/>
can take off on tangents and find my way full circle back to the starting <br/>
point though) and high energy and, oh yeah, I start off the semester and <br/>
repeat throughout the semester that the only difference between a student and <br/>
a teacher is that I have expertise in THIS subject that they don&#39;t have and <br/>
presumably want to acquire. But that any other day THEY could be the teacher <br/>
and I could be the student wanting to acquire expertise that they have. AND I <br/>
add that there are big gaps in my knowledge about economics (the subject I <br/>
teach) and some of them might very likely know more about certain specific <br/>
areas than I do and, if they do, they should speak up so we can all learn <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
I think they think I&#39;m just saying that -- but later on they find out that my <br/>
area of economics doesn&#39;t include the stock market, for example, and <br/>
occasionally we get someone in a class who really is a stock market whiz and <br/>
I help them (by leading questions and stuff) explain things to the rest of <br/>
the class, based on their own real-life and recent experience - much better <br/>
than my textbook-based explanations &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I do in my classes is have them make up their own semester <br/>
project. Every econ class student is required to do a semester project and in <br/>
ALL the other classes this is a 20-page &quot;research&quot; paper. Well - I point out <br/>
that they aren&#39;t doing actual &quot;research&quot; - that they&#39;re doing what is called <br/>
a &quot;survey of the literature&quot; and that is fine, if that&#39;s what they&#39;d like to <br/>
do. But they can do real research, if they want. They can do surveys, for <br/>
example. And I tell them they can take ANY of their passions, hobbies, other <br/>
classes, career goals, work, etc. and make up a project that relates that to <br/>
economics. I give the example of a student who was taking a class in <br/>
Photography: Contemporary Issues. She did a fantastic set of photos comparing <br/>
how the really rich live versus the really poor - in Los Angeles. She did a <br/>
little reading to go along with it and wrote up some information income <br/>
distribution and stuff like that too. A couple of people have done poster <br/>
collages, with an economic theme - one was on &quot;The American Dream.&quot; I&#39;ve had <br/>
a couple of videos - one was a guy who went out and interviewed workers in <br/>
different kinds of occupations and asked them about their work and their <br/>
feelings about it and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I give a number of suggestions - for those who can&#39;t think up an assignment <br/>
for themselves. And most use my suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
I only like the tricks, none of the other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
(Well, that might be an exaggeration, but give me a physics teacher who will <br/>
propelhimself across the room on a cart using a fire extingisher, and I <br/>
remember it for life.)<br/>
<br/>
When I make a presentation and I have done nothing but talk, I feel that I <br/>
cheated people badly.<br/>
<br/>
(I need to make a small, light cart, with well-greased bicycle wheels, <br/>
maybe...)<br/>
