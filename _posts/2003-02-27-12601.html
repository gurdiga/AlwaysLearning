&lt;&lt; Appreciating the here and now.  Death comes when it will, so take <br/>
 advantage of the now.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Thank you for the bittersweet reminder Joanna. I have thought of you almost <br/>
daily, but didn&#39;t know for sure if you could handle a bunch of email or not.<br/>
I figured I&#39;d wait until you made your way back to the list and then write.<br/>
I&#39;ve cried for you, for your sweet Sam and thanked God that you spent your <br/>
lives together the way you did.<br/>
I have looked at my children over and over while thinking of Sam and reminded <br/>
myself how very , very thankful I am to not only spend the time I get with <br/>
them, but to have found unschooling and be able to live our lives in freedom.<br/>
Not wasting time with petty things like school.....life is too short.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll live to see them grow up, I don&#39;t have the guarantee <br/>
that they will make it to adulthood.<br/>
But I have right now. I have today and I can spend it as joyfully and <br/>
passionately as possible.  I&#39;m glad you did.<br/>
I&#39;m glad Sam had such a wise Mama. And I am so sad still too......I just ache <br/>
for anyone losing loved ones because it is such a huge hole in your life. But <br/>
especially for Moms that lose their babies, or babies that lose their Moms, <br/>
it&#39;s almost too much to comprehend. <br/>
We&#39;re still here, and I&#39;m glad to see you here too.......<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
