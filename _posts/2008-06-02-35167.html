<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069564032">I made quiches.  One was ham and green chile (for Keith and Marty)  <br/>
and one was spinach (for Holly).  Holly came in and found hers and  <br/>
ate some before we talked.  I was looking at one of the cookbooks I  <br/>
had brought down to remind me how much liquid goes in what kind of  <br/>
pan.  One was The Enchanted Broccoli Forest, by Mollie Katzen--a hand- <br/>
lettered hippie recipe book from the early 80&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked if I had always owned that copy or if it was a  <br/>
replacement.  Replacement from a thrift store.  We talked a bit about  <br/>
this and that, and I thought I&#39;d come and see what Mollie Katzen is  <br/>
doing.  She&#39;s doing lots.  I read a while at her site, and I thought  <br/>
what&#39;s below might be perfect for some of the moms here.<br/>
<br/>
Here are two things from a longer list of questions and answers here:<br/>
<br/>
How and when did you start cooking?<br/>
I started make-believe cooking when I was a toddler, using invisible  <br/>
ingredients, plus grass, flowers, and mud. I started cooking with  <br/>
real food when I was about 8 or 9. My mother and grandmother let me  <br/>
follow them around the kitchen, and I was entranced. I tested and  <br/>
wrote my first recipe when I was 9. It was for a chocolate dessert  <br/>
that leaked out of the oven door and across the floor. My wonderful,  <br/>
patient mother, instead of yelling at me, said, &quot;Well this is  <br/>
certainly original. Let&#39;s give it a name.&quot; We called it &quot;Creeping  <br/>
Australian BooBoo.&quot; Lacking the good sense to be deterred, I went on  <br/>
to write many more recipes over the next 35+ years. Somewhere along  <br/>
the way, I figured out how to have things stay in the oven.<br/>
<br/>
What advice would you give a young person who is interested in a food  <br/>
career?<br/>
Read as many cookbooks and food publications as possible. Immerse  <br/>
yourself in the material! Peruse food markets, and save your money to  <br/>
have occasional restaurant meals in good places. Ask questions of  <br/>
experienced cooks. Get a job prepping in a restaurant that makes the  <br/>
kind of food you like. And above all, experiment with your own ideas  <br/>
in the kitchen. You might not need to go to culinary school if you do  <br/>
all the above. On the other hand, culinary school, if you can afford  <br/>
it, might be the way to go. Visit one, and see what it&#39;s like.<br/>

<br/>
We had some in the freezer, and I offered it to my oldest dd when she <br/>
was hungry late-ish, about 9 last night.<br/>
<br/>
I struggled for a few minutes wondering how exactly to pronounce it, <br/>
then remembered it being said on a movie (Muppets take Manhattan, &quot;Dog <br/>
gets quiche at 8.&quot;)  Which, in turn, reminded me of your page <br/>
Persephonics, because I could have never figured out &quot;quiche&quot; on my <br/>
own, if I hadn&#39;t heard it before.  <br/>

That IS cool!  And it should suprise me, but it doesn&#39;t.   :-)<br/>

Every connection allows for dozens more.  By dozens I probably mean  <br/>
thousands.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of dozens of connections. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Ooh. Thanks! I check it out on our next Barnes & Noble trip. Perfect timing too. My hormones are doing some shifting, and with them, my waistline is shifting too &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512082951">the topic, learning how to cook reminded me of something.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little, before microwaves, even, my mom showed me how to make campbells <br/>
chicken soup on the stovetop. Open can, pour into pot, add can of water, turn on burner, stir <br/>
till warm enough.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had it figured out. So the next time I tried to make Chef Boy R Dee ravioli using <br/>
the same procedure. Including the can of water. Only you dont add a can of water to <br/>
EVERYTHING you make on the stove, so it was all, you know, soupy, and not good. <br/>
<br/>
When I was in highschool, I lived with my mom, who was by then divorced. She paid me 10$  <br/>
a week to have dinner on the table when she got home from work. The only rule was that I <br/>
couldnt make breakfast for dinner more than once a week. Oh, and then another rule came <br/>
that everything couldnt be the same color. That was because one night I made chicken, corn, <br/>
and cornbread. I thought it was a nice theme. My mom thought it was nutritionally deficient <br/>
to have monochromatic meals. I learned how to make a lot of basic dinners, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778410810">I was also going to add that we have a great recipe from Alton Brown;s show Good Eats on <br/>
the food network for quiches-but he calls his Refrigerator Pies. Super easy and good, we <br/>
usually make the ham and spinach one. I havent made one in a while since Ive been avoiding <br/>
dairy, but maybe for brunch this weekend...:)<br/>
