<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last night Marty tried spaghetti again.  He doesn&#39;t like it.  I told him it <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; would be really helpful to everyone else if he liked it because it&#39;s so <br/>
&gt; cheap <br/>
&gt; and easy to make.  Usually he has just the sauce, with toast or rice, which <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; okay too, really.  So he said he would try again and I gave him a small <br/>
&gt; portion which he took to eat in another room. I don&#39;t know whether he liked <br/>
&gt; it; I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; ask next spaghetti day.    I&#39;m just telling this because Marty&#39;s 15 and it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; not just toddler-parents whose kids have an aversion that they might or <br/>
&gt; might <br/>
&gt; not grow out of. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey I did this with my son in law.  He hates tomatoes he said.  I asked him <br/>
when the last time he tried them, after all he loves sauce and ketchup.  He <br/>
willing tried it again after admitting it had been years, shook his head no and <br/>
went to the trash.  Something about the texture.  Caitlin my daughter won&#39;t eat <br/>
spaghetti but she will eat the sausage when I cook it in the sauce.  She eats <br/>
egg noodles with gravy though.  She hates spaghetti too.  Stepheny<br/>

was like being in another world.  Next year the kids all want to dress up for <br/>
it.  I loved it.  I have the SCA info and am trying to talk Frank into joining <br/>
LOL.   I would love being a part of it.  Stepheny<br/>
