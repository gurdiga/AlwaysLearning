<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056577800">Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that have seen my name before I&#39;m back!!!!.  We <br/>
just had Zak and Max in an unschooling school for the past 8 months <br/>
and hubby and I decided that paying $1300 a month for the kids to do <br/>
what they&#39;ve been doing at home didn&#39;t really make sense.  We are in <br/>
the process of moving from Tucson to the Denver/Boulder area of <br/>
Colorado in September and so decided it was time to get back on this <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Will post more later.... Glad to be back to an environment that I <br/>
have found interesting, informative, friendly, thought provoking and <br/>
challenging any of my old assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
Off to watch the kids clean out the guinea pigs.  Watching is what I <br/>
do a lot of now, rather than trying to tell them what to do or how <br/>
to do it!!!<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
<br/>
