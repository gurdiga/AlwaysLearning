<br/>
Another really good one is Lansinoh--it&#39;s a medical-grade, super-refined <br/>
lanolin.  We bought a tube when my daughter was a baby (it&#39;s mostly <br/>
advertised for nursing moms), and now we use it for all sorts of skin <br/>
abrasions/dryness/etc.  It works really well.  Here in Utah, the major <br/>
grocery stores have it, as well as the hippie grocery stores...if you&#39;re <br/>
interested and can&#39;t find any, I&#39;d be happy to send you a tube.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460018445">From the inside out, try Flax seed oil, mixed with juice -- dreadfully<br/>
yucky but seems to help dry skin or rashes; and a zinc supplement once or<br/>
twice a week for the little blemishes, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, there are Flax seed capsules if she can swallow stuff.  No bad taste<br/>
then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593386232">You can buy breastfeeding Lanolin which is pure and perfectly fine for <br/>
use and is digestable by baby. It can be purchased under the name of <br/>
Lansinoh and is fairly inexpensive. I know walgreens carries it...<br/>

<br/>
No.  <br/>
And she&#39;s sensitive to wool, so I hesitate to get lanoline for her. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s coming and going.  Holly thinks being out in the sun more will help.  <br/>
She&#39;s probably right.  She&#39;s often right. <br/>
