&gt; Kathryn, that was great! You wrote out all the ideas I&#39;ve had swirling<br/>
&gt; around in my head about RE that I haven&#39;t had time to express. Do you mind<br/>
&gt; if I forward it to our RE committee? They aren&#39;t quite as progressive as<br/>
&gt; yours -- well except for me ;-) -- but they seem to be on the brink of<br/>
&gt; seeing this themselves -- even if they do send their kids to school ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, go for it!<br/>
When I finish the damned book maybe they&#39;ll buy it ;)<br/>
