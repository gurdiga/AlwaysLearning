&lt;&lt;  I have witnessed many AP parents<br/>
struggle with their own childhood issues and therefore<br/>
at times be unable to identify the true needs of their<br/>
child.  Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>
experience. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably generalizing discussions from www.unschooling.com and <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
The ongoing discussion for years has involved people being aware of why and <br/>
what so they can be makig decisions as clearly as they can, based on principles <br/>
and priorities.  <br/>
<br/>
In a way, we don&#39;t need to identify the true needs of our children if we give <br/>
them enough leeway to indicate by choosing one thing over another how much <br/>
closeness they want, how much activity or quiet they want, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
I think my kids need safety and a lot of freedom within that safe <br/>
environment.  (Some people&#39;s &quot;safety&quot; would be repression or restriction from my point of <br/>
view, I know.)  I think they need opportunities and experiences and input, <br/>
and the right and power to say &quot;No thanks, not now, not that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some &quot;childhood issues&quot; are not &quot;issues&quot; in the sense that they&#39;re emotional <br/>
infections.  Some are just calm awarenesses of things we think hindered more <br/>
than helped.   Spankings.  Being put to bed in a dark room and made to stay <br/>
there even with bad dreams.   Those aren&#39;t &quot;issues&quot; for me, but those things <br/>
happened and I decided they were not the way to go.  So am I person who has <br/>
decided thoughtlessly to &quot;just&quot; do the opposite of what my mother did?  <br/>
<br/>
It seems more direct to me for people who are talking about unschooling to <br/>
move toward what will help their children learn without school, and develop into <br/>
confident, happy people.  Whether or not someone&#39;s parents spanked, spanking <br/>
doesn&#39;t help with any of that.    Some people don&#39;t spank because their <br/>
parents didn&#39;t.  Some don&#39;t spank because their parents did.  <br/>
