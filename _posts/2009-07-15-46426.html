<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935599772">The other day Emma, 6, asked me a series of questions to which all of the answers were yes.  She stopped and stared at my head for a bit and said &quot;Yeah, ya sure got a lot of yesses(sp?)in there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I loved that.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a lot of &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; in there.  Saying yes more often has made helped me be more clear about the difference between can&#39;t, won&#39;t, and don&#39;t want to.  When that all becomes clear, yesses are easier to get to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265399572">Thank you for sharing that Amy that made me chuckle. I have been a lot more on saying yes instead of no. I have trying not to say don&#39;t do that to my girls which has been a struggle because I have done it for long. But man does it feel good to say yes.<br/>

her quote where it couldn&#39;t get lost, and so this is what the Yes page  <br/>
looks like now:<br/>
