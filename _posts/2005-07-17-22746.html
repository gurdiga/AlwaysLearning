<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879796429">The State of the Outhouse speech:  The President is scheduled to deliver<br/>
his screwy address before a rascally session of Congress, telecast from<br/>
the House of Toity Bowl Cleaners.  <br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
&quot;60 Moments of Nirvana&quot; Investigates the saucy practice of laundering<br/>
counterfeit Poodles through nervous banks in the Shepherd Islands.  <br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Two Asses up&quot;  - Ebert and Wobberflox<br/>
&quot;A smart, saggy and baggy comedy.  You not only laugh, but it brings<br/>
Chinchilla&#39;s to your eyes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We played Mad Libs in the movie theater yesterday while waiting for a<br/>
matinee of &quot;Dark Water&quot;. <br/>
