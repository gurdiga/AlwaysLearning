<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275535551">Tonight we had the firemen come out to our house to search for the <br/>
source of some smokey smells my son and I were smelling.  Everything <br/>
turned out fine except for how I handled this whole incident with my <br/>
son.  He was so scared, as expected!  However, I handled trying to <br/>
make him feel better so badly, I feel like such a horrible mom!  <br/>
<br/>
We smelled smoke but after searching the house twice I couldn&#39;t find <br/>
the source of the smell.  There was no smoke and no fire so I tried <br/>
to tell my frightened son that it was fine and that I couldn&#39;t see <br/>
anything wrong.  Needless to say, I was a bit frightened too but was <br/>
not very comforting nor reassuring towards my son.  He needed me to <br/>
really listen and validate his fears (he wanted to go outside) and I <br/>
was not listening and responding to his needs AT ALL...I was trying <br/>
to make him calm down and not be scared.  My husband (who was at <br/>
work) told me to call 911...I know, I should have done this right <br/>
away but I come from a place (in my history) where I hate to bother <br/>
people...and since I didn&#39;t see anything, I just didn&#39;t call.  Of <br/>
course, now I KNOW i should have and will if this ever happens again <br/>
but that&#39;s not my point here...My point is I really let my son down <br/>
and I feel so bad!!<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning (he went to bed really early tonight) I plan on <br/>
talking and apologizing profusely to him but in the meantime I just <br/>
want to do this whole night over again!!  I&#39;d go outside with him as <br/>
he needed me to without question and grumpiness, hold him tight and <br/>
I&#39;d call 911!  I know I&#39;m not perfect but this stinks!  I&#39;m using it <br/>
as a lesson to me and I&#39;m hopeful next time he needs me so badly I <br/>
won&#39;t fail him.  I know I&#39;ve put a chink in our relationship tonight <br/>
but I&#39;m hopeful I can mend some of it back tomorrow morning.  Just <br/>
needed to talk about this a little, thanks for listening...</div>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have called 911.  I would&#39;ve taken my child outside, see  <br/>
if the smell is coming from outside the house (in through vents or on  <br/>
the wind), unplug anything that heats up and might have been  <br/>
stinking, and talk to him about what could cause a smoky smell.<br/>
<br/>
Had you recently turned on the furnace?  Did you vacuum out the vents?<br/>
<br/>
Had a neighbor recently lit a fireplace for the first time this  <br/>
year?  Was someone maybe burning leaves and the wind blowing the  <br/>
smell toward you?  Was there a forest fire or brush fire some  <br/>
distance away that was wafting smoke toward you?  There was a big  <br/>
forest fire 150 or 200 miles from here once, and the wind brought the  <br/>
smell all the way here.<br/>
<br/>
What did the firemen say?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you checked the house with confident, speaking aloud what you were  <br/>
looking at and for, he&#39;ll start building his own checklist of what to  <br/>
look for.<br/>
<br/>
By treating it as something that required experts, something that was  <br/>
an emergency, you might have made the fear worse.  You&#39;re the  <br/>
protective, wise adult when you&#39;re the only one there.<br/>

Knowledge is a great cure for fear. He was scared because he didn&#39;t  <br/>
know what to do. Go with him and talk to the firemen and ask for  <br/>
advice about what to do next time there&#39;s a smokey smell. What are  <br/>

There was a good book (and apparently a similar book still in print)  <br/>
full of information for kids if they stay home alone. While my  <br/>
daughter never was home alone, it was useful for her worries because  <br/>
the world seemed big and scary and too powerful for her. It gave her  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864104817">Thank you both, I really appreciate your comments!  The smell seems <br/>
to be our oil furnace when it turns on.  We just moved to this house <br/>
this past summer and it seems we need to have the oil company come <br/>
out and check the furnace, possibly clean it.  I smelled it again <br/>
last night after my kids went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
I so agree with your comments about not calling 911 (unless there is <br/>
obvious smoke/fire) to avoid blowing the fears out of proportion.  <br/>
btw, my husand is very protective when he is not home and can&#39;t <br/>
assess the situation so it was him that asked me to call 911.  <br/>
However, I do admit, I felt better knowing that they were coming :)<br/>
The other thing about calling 911 is responding to the panic of my <br/>
son in validating his fear of fire.  My husband reminded me that our <br/>
son is quite intuitive (based on past founded events) and he really <br/>
may have known something we didn&#39;t.  I had hoped that after the <br/>
firemen left he would feel better too. <br/>
<br/>
Now here is the issue I need to work on...coming from a family where <br/>
I did not have opportunities to learn for myself, I often don&#39;t feel <br/>
confident enought to handle &quot;big&quot; situations myself...I now realize <br/>
that my son saw the uncertainty in my eyes (as much as I tried to <br/>
look nonchalant...LOL) and was responding to that too!  Poor kid.  <br/>
Anyway, your comments have really helped me to take a strong look at <br/>
myself and the next time I have a similar event in which I need to be <br/>
the strong, calm protective one...I&#39;ll work on it :0<br/>
<br/>
We are planning a trip to the firehouse to have him talk to the <br/>
firemen and ask about this situation and others like it.  I love <br/>
those books too, Joyce, and I&#39;m going to get them.  Thanks again!<br/>

  I guess that I think that you are the best judge of whether this would put a chink in your relationship.  I do use the (frequent) mistakes I make to apologize, as you said that you would.  I hope that it helps my kids to know that when they make mistakes it&#39;s all right.  They usually do show me when the have broken something, etc, or tell me when they feel bad about something they have done.  So modeling how to apologize and move on is great, and a rich learning experience.  Having said that, I do still worry that even if they forgive me they will be less trusting in our relationship next time and that hurts a lot.  You could ask your son how he feels about the whole thing.  If there is anything he wishes that you would change if a similar thing happens again.  Sometimes my kids are more satisfied than I thought, or they will offer very good comments on what they would rather see me do.  That is better than assuming what they would wish<br/>
 for out of us.   Cameron P<br/>

There are other reasons not to call 911 besides avoiding the  <br/>
enlargement of fearfulness.  While the fire truck is at your house,  <br/>
it&#39;s not at the ready to respond to other calls.<br/>
<br/>
If you treat this as something that you did because your husband told  <br/>
you to, that&#39;s another way of making yourself more helpless and  <br/>
dependent than necessary.  If you treat it as something you did to  <br/>
prove that you love your child, there seems a risk of causing doubt  <br/>
of your love if you opt out of calling 911 another time in the future.<br/>

Good idea (your husband&#39;s).  Seems they could&#39;ve gone with that, with  <br/>
the truck at the ready in case the advance guy did need them.<br/>

Maybe my thoughts have to do, in part, with the distances in New  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165335562">We smell smoke a LOT where I live (southern NM).  I talk a lot to Richard directly and indirectly (just commenting out loud) about the different kinds of smoke, the different smells.  <br/>
<br/>
During the summer we have a lot of wildfires that last days or weeks.  We can not only smell them but sometimes we can see the smoke and the slurry planes and helicopters with buckets flying back and forth, trying to put out the fires.  Sometimes there is enough smoke in town to burn my eyes.  We also have a lot of people barbequing with mesquite and other wood in my neighborhood.  That smells different than wildfires.  <br/>
<br/>
During the winter many people around here use fireplaces or woodstoves for warmth.  We have experimented with different types of wood in ours, some smell wonderful.  We filled our house with smoke the other night when we burned pumpkin seeds in the oven, we had made 3 batches with butter and salt and other seasonings, but my niece wanted to try one with butter and brown sugar.   It didn&#39;t work out so well, the house smelled great at first, like cinnamon rolls, the burnt sugar smell after they burned was terrible!  It was good though because we found out that one of our smoke detectors doesn&#39;t work!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The majority of fires start in wiring inside walls, so if you really do smell smoke and can&#39;t find the source of it, it is very likely to be in a wall.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The thought of a fire in the wall is scary, especially since the smell of smoke is so common here.  I would hope that it would smell different, acrid or something, at least at first.  When we first moved into our new house one of our cats peed on an electrical outlet in Richard&#39;s bedroom.  The smell was very, well, electrical!  Gross.  It didn&#39;t start a fire but there was a scorched mark all up the wall above the outlet, and the plug for the little portable egg lights that was plugged in was burnt and ruined.  <br/>
<br/>
Because we smell smoke so often I would probably spend more time investigating rather than call 911 right away.  The fire department in my town is manned by a combination of volunteers and police officers.  We have no paid firemen that are not also police.  I bet it would be easier around here to get one of the volunteers to come out and have a sniff than it would be in a big city.  <br/>
