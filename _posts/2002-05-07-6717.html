&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know if I can answer these questions.  So, maybe it is <br/>
absurd to ask others before I really explore my own choices. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t seem absurd to get some input and basis for comparison.  That can <br/>
only help your own exploration.  No sense reinventing the philosophical wheel <br/>
if you don&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; So that might be a fun topic here, too: how far would YOU go to <br/>
unschool? Is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there anywhere you&#39;d draw the line and just say, &quot;Okay, I give, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; worth THAT&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would sign up for Clonlara, first.  That&#39;s not going TOO far.  It&#39;s <br/>
throwing money at it and having a screen to hide behind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be willing to move to another state if New Mexico became conservative and <br/>
insane suddenly for some reason.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be willing to be underground.  I already am unregistered, but I mean I <br/>
would be willing to (attempt to) be subtle and sneaky.  <br/>
<br/>
I might be willing to run my husband off, but that&#39;s a pretty bad plan.  But <br/>
if he suddenly became conservative and insane for some reason and I figured <br/>
the new attitude wasn&#39;t going to do the kids any good on earth, I might get <br/>
the kids and go elsewhere for a while if possible.  That wouldn&#39;t be &quot;to <br/>
unschool,&quot; but to maintain the level of peace and casual inquiry to which <br/>
they have become accustomed.<br/>
<br/>
I would also be willing to let the kids go to school if they wanted to (now <br/>
that they&#39;re old enough to be analytical and detached about it), if that <br/>
would save their freedom or whatever.  (Hypothetical situations are always <br/>
plagued by the &quot;Yeah, but&quot; and &quot;what about...&quot; bits.)<br/>
<br/>
Meghan admits she would cheat:  -=-And of course, there&#39;s always <br/>
faking it (as in do the kids work and hand it in if necessary) &lt;g&gt;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In the case of sudden insane conservatism on the part of the state, yeah I&#39;d <br/>
do that too.<br/>
<br/>
I never cheated in school (except one day several of us teamed up on some <br/>
drivers&#39; ed homework, but we all did know the material, we had just partied <br/>
late and hadn&#39;t filled in the workbooks, and once in 9th grade science I <br/>
purposely missed one of ten test questions so I&#39;d have a 90 and the curve <br/>
would be kinder to my friend--and they busted me hard for that and brought in <br/>
my parents), but I&#39;m not as loyal to school now as I was then! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
