 <br/>
Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
Some friends of mine are going to be on nightline tonight. For anyone<br/>
on EST, Nightline airs on ABC at 11:30pm. Check your local listings<br/>
for exact info.<br/>
<br/>
The family being featured is the Barenaked family<br/>
(barenakedfamily.com) and some other friends were there during the<br/>
filming so they might have a bit of airtime also (freerangefamily.com).<br/>
<br/>
Check it out! Unschoolers on the road, living la vida loca!!:)<br/>
Pass this on....<br/>
