<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554608843">After reading many responses from you all about how to &quot;deprogramme&quot; my<br/>
thirteen year old,  I still struggle.  Thank GOD I wasn&#39;t looking to you all<br/>
to &quot;approve&quot; or validate my feelings about not having a television.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that we as parents have a biblical responsibility to guard<br/>
our childrens&#39; hearts and minds, not just &quot;let them&quot; put whatever they want<br/>
to into them.  Do my children watch television, YES.  Do they watch movies,<br/>
YES... But do they get to say &quot;I want to watch Friday the 13th&quot; and I go get<br/>
it for them? NO.  Do they at seven, nine, or even thirteen years old<br/>
*want*to watch the teenage shows that promote girls wearing tight<br/>
short outfits<br/>
and boys oogling over them, or cartoons with disrespectful nasty attitudes<br/>
---YES.  Am I responsible as a parent to not only SAY that might not be the<br/>
best choice, but to protect their hearts from that temptation since it is<br/>
NOT good for the growth of their hearts?YES  Even though I would on occasion<br/>
let them watch these shows, and sit and talk with them about why they were<br/>
not good attitudes, and why we should not treat people this way -- if that<br/>
is what they are filling their minds with, they DO act that way.  I have<br/>
seen it in MANY children, NOT just my own.  I also don&#39;t see it as a good<br/>
thing to expose them (at ANY age) to the constant commercialism and the &quot;BUY<br/>
BUY BUY&quot; attitude that is shoved into every 5-7 minutes of television.<br/>
<br/>
However, I did not write to this list to look for you to tell me &quot;that&#39;s<br/>
great, you don&#39;t let your children watch television&quot; *or *for the opposite<br/>
of that.  And, that just isn&#39;t true.  They do watch tv, and movies, and we<br/>
enjoy them together, and they enjoy some that I prefer not to watch... and<br/>
that is fine.  My husband and I have simply chosen that it does NOT need to<br/>
be a daily focus in our household...  and I am sure that we are better off,<br/>
as a family, for that.<br/>
<br/>
I did write asking for help with trying to figure out what to do FOR my<br/>
thirteen year old.  I have been struggling with him for years, and trying to<br/>
figure out how to change my expectations and how to encourage him to learn.<br/>
I have always struggled with him, and really it took me until I had a<br/>
younger boy, who is very self discovering and self teaching, to realize that<br/>
IT IS ME that is holding my older son back.  I see that my younger son is<br/>
learning how to read, all by himself.  How to write, when it is important to<br/>
him, how to do math that he needs.  that when he wants to understand<br/>
something, he asks and he is willing to search it out.  I would love my<br/>
older son to have that sort of zeal.. and I GET IT, that it is my fault -<br/>
totally - that he doesn&#39;t have that.  I am trying to figure out what to do<br/>
for him now, why he still has the chance to recover some, if only a little.<br/>
I want to help him.  I want our relationship to get better.  We can sit for<br/>
an hour or two talking.  he will help when I need him to help.  He is a<br/>
great kid, and yes, it is my expectations that are getting in the way.  I<br/>
feel like he doesn&#39;t put any effort into learning anything.  but I am<br/>
starting to see differently as we are trying new and different things with<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to figure out how to NOT make the same mistakes with my other<br/>
children, and how to help my oldest make the best of his own life.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t know where to start with him.<br/>
<br/>
I have four younger children, I can&#39;t just go off everyday and take the<br/>
oldest everywhere, and do things with only him.  So I have to figure out<br/>
what I *can* do that will help HIM to be happiest, wholest, most fulfilled<br/>
person he can be.  I get it that damage has already been done.  trust me, I<br/>
get that.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that I might be able to help some of it heal, and I might not.<br/>
but if I can, I want to do it.<br/>

Do you think there is any family on this list in which the parents  <br/>

<br/>
Holly likes scary movies.  I just asked her if she&#39;s ever seen Friday  <br/>
the 13th.  &quot;No,&quot; she said.  Years ago, I told the video store across  <br/>
the vacant lot from our house that it was okay with me for my kids to  <br/>
rent R rated movies.  I made sure they put it in the notes of our  <br/>
account.  Holly turned 17 a week ago.  She can legally go into any R  <br/>
rated movie now.  For her birthday she had asked for Grease and  <br/>
Grease 2, and another family gave her a copy of Enchanted.  Tonight  <br/>
she was watching Follow that Bird.  The other day she and I and her  <br/>
boyfriend went to see Zack and Miri make a Porno.<br/>
<br/>
The presence of adult-themed movies doesn&#39;t destroy a healthy, strong  <br/>
person.  Being old enough to watch R rated movies made no difference  <br/>
with my kids.  They haven&#39;t been told &quot;Wait until you&#39;re older.&quot;   <br/>
Kirby is 22 and recommended  Wall E to me.  When Holly visited him  <br/>
last summer, he turned her on to a Sesame Street song she hadn&#39;t  <br/>
heard before, and she came home and asked me to find her a copy.  It  <br/>
was right on my computer and I threw it on a disk right then.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is that your fears and negativity will do more  <br/>
damage than &quot;the &quot;BUY BUY BUY&quot; attitude and &quot;the teenage shows that  <br/>
promote girls wearing tight short outfits and boys oogling over  <br/>
them.&quot;    You are afraid the sky is falling, and your thirteen year  <br/>
old boy might feel like the sky has fallen on him.    Yet instead of  <br/>
considering advice from people here whose teenaged boys are fine and  <br/>
happy and calm, you seem to be insulting us, insulting your son, and  <br/>
defending the stance and attitude that has not worked well up to this  <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
We have nothing to gain or lose from your decisions. Your son does.   <br/>
Your other children do.<br/>
<br/>
If the list might do you some good, then chill and be nice here.  If  <br/>
you&#39;re sure this list isn&#39;t going to help,  you could go back to not  <br/>
reading.  There are other lists.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks to this list and the encouragement to seek out the fun and interesting, my son and <br/>
I have been searching out comedy.  Right now, t.v. is on our daily &quot;curriculum&quot;  (our <br/>
comedy curriculum--LOL!) and we are having a blast!  Whereas several other parents I <br/>
know have been complaining to me about their teenage sons turning away from them and <br/>
not sharing their lives with them anymore, my son and I spend quality time together <br/>
everyday--looking forward to what&#39;s on the agenda.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even tell you all the conversation that has been stimulated--we make liberal use of <br/>
the pause button--I mean all the comparing, analyzing, dissection and belly laughing we <br/>
have shared, the connections that have been made--I wouldn&#39;t  trade our time for a <br/>
million bucks!  And then there&#39;s the planning, discussing shows, comedians, actors, <br/>
politics, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry, now, for parents that hold on to their biases against modern media (t.v., <br/>
computer, video games, etc.)  for all that they are missing out on.  I used to be in the &quot;fear <br/>
t.v. because it is evil&quot; camp, until I decided to trust my children to be drawn to what is <br/>
stimulating for them whether I understand it or not.  Until someone has made that shift, it <br/>
is hard to really describe it--except to say that in my opinion, it is the place where the <br/>
relationship exists that everyone fantasizes that they will have with their children before <br/>
they are born, but then you don&#39;t because you are caught up in power struggles!<br/>
<br/>
So after an entire day of LARPing and winter gardening, we settled down to a few episodes <br/>
of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It&#39;s been a good day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really want to get into a biblical discussion here, but if you<br/>
want to argue this line of thinking, you could also say that God gave<br/>
everyone free will.  Are you going to take that away from your kids and<br/>
go against a very biblical principle?  Free will is freedom to choose. <br/>
How can a child know how to make good choices, unless they can actually<br/>
do so.  Does that mean they will always make good choices?  No, and<br/>
neither does anybody else on the entire face of the planet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>attitudes<br/>
<br/>
My oldest loves scary movies!  When I say loves, I mean LOVES!  It&#39;s a<br/>
passion, so much so that she was involved in a very intense Halloween<br/>
haunt this year where she learned sooo much about make-up, costuming,<br/>
special effects, human nature, and the list goes on and on.  When she<br/>
watches scary movies, she&#39;s very analytical about them, she takes them<br/>
apart and dismantels them, expands on them, sometimes reads the books<br/>
they are based on and compares and critiques them.<br/>
<br/>
She also watches movies and TV shows beyond her age and she doesn&#39;t<br/>
dress or act in any way inappropriate.  She&#39;s very modest with her body<br/>
and she has an awesome attitude.  Her bedroom door has a sign that says<br/>
&quot;everything has the potential to be funny&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t say &quot;keep out&quot;<br/>
or &quot;enter at own risk&quot;, although she should have one like the latter ;)<br/>
<br/>
This is what I know about kids being forbidden for the fear of some<br/>
horrible things that they might possibly pick up from said forbidden<br/>
thing, they will find a way to do it anyway.  It becomes bigger than<br/>
them, more important, since it&#39;s so huge that it must be forbidden. <br/>
Parents may be able to control younger kids this way, but there will<br/>
come a day, like what you are experiencing with your oldest son, where<br/>
they will question your judgement and move towards independent thinking.<br/>
Sometimes they come to similar conclusions after years of soul searching<br/>
and sometimes they don&#39;t.<br/>

they feel about it.  It&#39;s about free choice and trust.<br/>

<br/>
People have given you a lot of ideas of what to do for you son.  You&#39;ve<br/>
been struggling with him for years, yet you won&#39;t stop doing what you<br/>
are doing and really look at alternatives that others are offering.  I<br/>
don&#39;t struggle with my teen, we live very harmoniously, she&#39;s thriving,<br/>
and I doubt there is ever a moment that she isn&#39;t learning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; younger boy, who is very self discovering and self teaching,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some kids are just more obvious in what they are learning and doing.  My<br/>
younger daughter is like this too, we all know everything that&#39;s going<br/>
on with her, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
...he asks and he is willing to search it out. I would love my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; older son to have that sort of zeal..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps his life is too narrow.  Perhaps he has a zeal for things that<br/>
you&#39;ve forbidden or frown upon and can&#39;t search it out.  Perhaps he<br/>
needs more in his life.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does it have to be every day or none at all?  Why can&#39;t you go and<br/>
do things with just him?  My husband and I have had to do a lot of<br/>
double teaming so that our oldest can go out with just me or just him. <br/>
It&#39;s been hugely important and hugely beneficial.  It also helps the<br/>
younger kid/s to get a larger percent of the other parent.  This may be<br/>
especially helpful if your son is moping around being a negative nelly,<br/>
the younger ones could use a break from that too.</div>

Chamille and her scary movies, really pushed me out of my comfort zone<br/>
because I&#39;m not much of a scary movie person, BUT it&#39;s been really fun<br/>

<br/>
Her experience watching scary movies isn&#39;t going to be at all the same<br/>
as kids watching a scary movie for the first time at a sleep over,<br/>
knowing that they&#39;d be punished by their parents if they knew.  They<br/>
can&#39;t even go home and talk about it to help process it for fear of the<br/>
punishment, which in all likelihood is more scary than the scary movie.</div>

don&#39;t want held up to examination, don&#39;t post it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
You say you want help with your son but half your post is about your  <br/>
philosophy of control. Because you&#39;ve posted it, it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
discussed because the ideas you&#39;ve presented -- ideas we&#39;re all  <br/>
familiar with and ideas that most of us have either used or grown up  <br/>
with -- get in the way of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And because you&#39;ve begun you&#39;re post with it, I&#39;m betting some people  <br/>
will run out of time and energy before they get to the questions  <br/>
about your son.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to impose another philosophy on top of freedom, they  <br/>
need to figure out how to do it on their own. If you had a list about  <br/>
Christianity, would you feel comfortable helping someone blend Islam  <br/>
with it?<br/>
<br/>
The posters here can&#39;t feel comfortable with control being suggested  <br/>
as a compatible idea with unschooling. Control is damaging and it  <br/>
interferes. If you want to control your children&#39;s lives and  <br/>
unschool, you&#39;ll need to find ways to counter the effect of control  <br/>
on your own because people here have found ways to help their  <br/>
children grow up healthy and sound without the control and we know  <br/>
it&#39;s not necessary.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By saying that, you&#39;re implying that we let our kids put whatever  <br/>
into themselves and don&#39;t care because our philosophy of freedom is  <br/>
more important than our kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think it will help you hear what we&#39;re saying if you believe that  <br/>
we care as much about our children&#39;s mental, physical and spiritual  <br/>
health as you do. We&#39;ve just found a way to do it without controlling  <br/>
them and telling them what to do. We&#39;re their partners as they  <br/>
explore the world. We trust that they have needs we don&#39;t understand  <br/>
and that they&#39;re exploring ways of meeting them. We&#39;re there to help  <br/>
them explore lots of different way. We trust that even though they  <br/>
may make choices for themselves that we wouldn&#39;t, that because  <br/>
they&#39;re being raised in a nurturing environment, that they don&#39;t want  <br/>
to hurt themselves (though may put up with discomfort for a bit to  <br/>
try something out). They *are* seeking ways to be happy and healthy.  <br/>
They find those ways by freely exploring and feeling the negatives  <br/>
and positives of their choices, sometimes putting up with the  <br/>
negatives to experience the positives. But they&#39;re not stupid. They  <br/>
use their heads and weigh and judge and do come to sound decisions as  <br/>
they grow because we&#39;ve trusted that they&#39;re capable.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also right here with them, helping them find ways to meet their  <br/>
needs and be safe and respectful.<br/>
<br/>
This is easiest when they&#39;re little, when their choices involve  <br/>
staying up late, taking the big jump on their bikes, getting a toy  <br/>
back from another child. When they&#39;re trusted early, there&#39;s no  <br/>
reason to push the boundaries into areas many teens do when they have  <br/>
the power to do so (drinking and driving, drugs). Unschooled kids  <br/>
aren&#39;t perfect but they&#39;re poster children next to kids who&#39;ve been  <br/>
raised under control.<br/>
<br/>
Does control always lead to rebellion? No, but it does a lot.  <br/>
Unfortunately most people are convinced that when control fails it&#39;s  <br/>
because they didn&#39;t control enough.<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s telling you to change your ideas. We are saying the ideas  <br/>
you&#39;re presenting won&#39;t be left to sit on the list without being  <br/>
countered. If you don&#39;t want them countered, don&#39;t bring them to the  <br/>
list. If you don&#39;t want to change, don&#39;t bring it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ven though I would on occasion<br/>

&gt; they were<br/>
&gt; not good attitudes, and why we should not treat people this way --  <br/>
&gt; if that<br/>
&gt; is what they are filling their minds with, they DO act that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, kids try out behavior.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found works better than no, is passing on how it makes me  <br/>
feel. Kids *don&#39;t* want to hurt people but often don&#39;t know how to  <br/>
get what they want without hurting someone. They need help not barriers.<br/>
<br/>
This topic has been discussed here on the list. People *have* found  <br/>
ways for their kids to be kind and respectful without controlling and  <br/>
even without lecturing each time some bad behavior comes on the  <br/>
screen. We trust that they&#39;re thinking creatures that don&#39;t want to  <br/>
hurt.<br/>
<br/>
If someone *does* want to tackle the topic of behavior that kids are  <br/>
picking up on tv and then trying out on their siblings, this is a  <br/>
great place  to find respectful ways for kids to watch TV *and* be  <br/>
nice. But it needs to be a current problem, not a hypothetical one.  <br/>
Kids have real reasons for what they do. Hypothetical kids can get  <br/>
&quot;what if&#39;d&quot; to the point of ridiculousness.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also don&#39;t see it as a good<br/>
&gt; thing to expose them (at ANY age) to the constant commercialism and  <br/>
&gt; the &quot;BUY<br/>
&gt; BUY BUY&quot; attitude that is shoved into every 5-7 minutes of television.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yet unschoolers do have kids watching commercials and they aren&#39;t  <br/>
hyperconsumers. (In fact the past couple of years it&#39;s been tough to  <br/>
get my teen daughter to think up what to put on her Christmas list.)  <br/>
Control isn&#39;t the only answer. (Control ultimately isn&#39;t even a good  <br/>
answer. Control might drive the immediate behavior out of sight, but  <br/>
it pays for it with bigger problems in the future.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband and I have simply chosen that it does NOT need to<br/>
&gt; be a daily focus in our household... and I am sure that we are  <br/>
&gt; better off,<br/>
&gt; as a family, for that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, lots of parents here began there. Lots of people were raised  <br/>
that way. *Everyone* is familiar with control. Yes, even gentle  <br/>
loving control. The stories of the problems it created get discussed  <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have been struggling with him for years, and trying to<br/>
&gt; figure out how to change my expectations and how to encourage him  <br/>
&gt; to learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you can do both. Either you drop your expectations or  <br/>
drop trying to change him.<br/>
<br/>
Create a nurturing environment. Help him feel comfortable with who he  <br/>
is. Help him feel comfortable reaching out. Help him feel comfortable  <br/>
not reaching out. The more he feels you pushing, the harder he&#39;s  <br/>
going to cling. Once you stop pushing that&#39;s when he&#39;ll start blooming.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I see that my younger son is<br/>
&gt; learning how to read, all by himself. How to write, when it is  <br/>
&gt; important to<br/>
&gt; him, how to do math that he needs. that when he wants to understand<br/>
&gt; something, he asks and he is willing to search it out. I would love my<br/>
&gt; older son to have that sort of zeal.. and I GET IT, that it is my  <br/>
&gt; fault<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you pushed him to read and do math, perhaps it is.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve cut off avenues he would have loved to explore, then  <br/>
perhaps it is. (I really can&#39;t say enough about video games and math  <br/>
and reading.)<br/>
<br/>
But not all kids are into researching things. Now that she&#39;s a teen  <br/>
my daughter will research a few things and explore and discover on  <br/>
her own, but other things -- especially things that might be labeled  <br/>
academic -- she&#39;d rather be shown or do it with someone who already  <br/>
knows. But there are answers between pushing and standing back.  <br/>
There&#39;s walking by their sides discovering things together. And other  <br/>
options.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and how to help my oldest make the best of his own life. I just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know where to start with him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Begin with who he is right now. What interests him? What does he love?<br/>
<br/>
13 *is* a tricky time. Often times they don&#39;t know what they like.  <br/>
(And you do make it harder by cutting off chunks of the world that he  <br/>
could explore. I understand you have your reasons so you don&#39;t need  <br/>
to tell us, but from experience unschoolers know that freedom (and  <br/>
support while they explore) works much better for kids to find  <br/>
themselves than limitations do.)<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;ll need to find ways to run more of the world through his  <br/>
life. Take him to more of the world. (Even a new grocery store, an  <br/>
ethnic market.) Be okay when he says no thanks. Respect that, but  <br/>
also keep the doors open and keep opening new ones.<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s vague but your post about your son is vague too. 90% of  <br/>
the post is about you. You haven&#39;t told us anything about him other  <br/>
than what you want for him and what you don&#39;t want for him and where  <br/>
he&#39;s living up to your expectations (eg, &quot;good&quot; which is such a vague  <br/>
term that it says nothing). Who is he? You need to begin there rather  <br/>
than with yourself.<br/>

I have been searching out comedy-=-<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re focusing on comedy, but not on &quot;TV.&quot;  There&#39;s comedy on  <br/>
YouTube, and on the radio, and recordings without video of many  <br/>
comedians over the years, and in conversations in your own life, and  <br/>
in books and on greeting cards...<br/>
<br/>
Joanna, this is beautiful, and I&#39;m putting it on the quotes generator at<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;...it is the place where the relationship exists that everyone  <br/>
fantasizes that they will have with their children before they are  <br/>
born, but then you don&#39;t because you are caught up in power struggles!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful, and in my experience true, except for this:  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
fantasize having such a good relationship with my children.  I had no  <br/>
idea it was possible.  It&#39;s BETTER than I fantasized.  Some of my  <br/>
best times of the past few days have been being in the car with  <br/>
Holly, doing routine things, and standing and watching Marty play  <br/>
Fallout 3.  I&#39;ll pass by and something&#39;s interesting, and I&#39;ll watch  <br/>
a while and ask a question, and then a cool song comes on the radio  <br/>
in the game, and Marty tells me a story, and I stand there for  <br/>
fifteen or twenty minutes.  It&#39;s an interesting story and a weird set- <br/>
up and the art is cool.  It&#39;s &quot;bloody&quot; (in a #CC0000-pixels kind of  <br/>
way), and I don&#39;t care much for the maze-and-first-person-shooter  <br/>
aspect, but the mystery and premise and story are good, and to see  <br/>
Marty so involved and efficient at it is great.  He&#39;s halfway through  <br/>
the second playing, being a different kind of character and seeing  <br/>
things he didn&#39;t see before.  There are different endings depending  <br/>
how you played.  I hope I&#39;m around when he gets to the end of the  <br/>
story next time.  He plays when he&#39;s not at work, but it&#39;s not the  <br/>
only thing he does.  This morning he&#39;s going to Santa Fe with his dad  <br/>
for a kingdom-wide fighter practice (SCA thing) and then they&#39;re  <br/>
coming back early so he can have a Thanksgiving dinner at the  <br/>
restaurant where he works.  The owners put on this dinner for their  <br/>
employees and friends every year; the restaurant is closed.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, meanwhile, will be at an airsoft battle in the mountains for  <br/>
her friend&#39;s 18th birthday, and then I&#39;ll meet that party and others  <br/>
who didn&#39;t want to shoot and be shot, at a restaurant (Garduño&#39;s at  <br/>
Winrock) to celebrate the birthday (this is the family Holly stayed  <br/>
with in England a few years ago), and then Holly will need to leave  <br/>
the dinner early to go for a group interview at a store at Coronado  <br/>
Mall, which is just half a mile from there.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s busier than some days here, but Keith will be with Marty some  <br/>
of the day, and I&#39;ll be with Holly some of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Oh... and Holly&#39;s boyfriend is in on none of that.  He&#39;ll be at the  <br/>
house leading a World of Warcraft raid from noon 6:00 and a guild  <br/>
meeting after that.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting note:  Holly, who&#39;s a very pink and fluffy kid, will  <br/>
be going to a 7:30 pm interview without having been home since noon- <br/>
thirty.  But it&#39;s for a sportsy store, so if she says &quot;I was playing  <br/>
airsoft in the Sandias,&quot; it might be points in her favor.  She&#39;s  <br/>
taking a spruce-up kit and will change in the restaurant bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
How many parents of 17 year old girls get to know so much of what  <br/>
they&#39;re planning and thinking?  It&#39;s very, very cool here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706667944">Jenny C has written some crucial info:<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is what I know about kids being forbidden for the fear of some<br/>
horrible things that they might possibly pick up from said forbidden<br/>
thing, they will find a way to do it anyway. It becomes bigger than<br/>
them, more important, since it&#39;s so huge that it must be forbidden.<br/>
Parents may be able to control younger kids this way, but there will<br/>
come a day, like what you are experiencing with your oldest son, where<br/>
they will question your judgement and move towards independent  <br/>
thinking.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly could watch Friday the 13th but she hasn&#39;t.   She might  <br/>
someday, but only if she really wants to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-...it&#39;s so huge that it must be forbidden...-=-<br/>
<br/>
And forbidding it makes it MORE huge.  Someone from a home where  <br/>
&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; is named as an evil boogey-man around which (the  <br/>
avoidance of) their lives are built is WAY more likely to absolutely  <br/>
watch that movie someday to see what on earth is mother was on about.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, families that revile &quot;Darwin&quot; as a boogey man will have  <br/>
kids who know more about Darwinism than my kids do.  Why should they  <br/>
read Darwin, really, unless they&#39;re interested?  But over-controlled,  <br/>
over-spooked children of fundamentalists will be the ones to look  <br/>
into what&#39;s so evil that their parents are afraid enough to lie and  <br/>
hide the TV about, to stay out of museums about, to censor their  <br/>
kids&#39; book choices about.<br/>
<br/>
The damage of the effects of fear is often worse than the imagined  <br/>
damage of the feared boogie-man thing.<br/>

Zoe is living in New York and I still know most everything that&#39;s  <br/>

instead of going to the party or the movie she was invited to, she  <br/>
went grocery shopping with Craig and then they went back to her  <br/>

it&#39;s not one-sided. Not in the we&#39;re-best-friends sort of way that  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565323408">I was adding a Joyce quote to my random quotes generator, and this  <br/>
one by Lyle came up.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let your kids be WHO THEY ARE, not who someone thinks they should  <br/>
be. Throw away the mold and let your kids LIVE.&quot; — Lyle Perry<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the Joyce-quote I added:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unfortunately most people are convinced that when control fails it&#39;s<br/>
because they didn&#39;t control enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Although people sometimes say they control their children out of  <br/>
love, it involves fear and meanness.  The love is too often love of  <br/>
the fear of God, and love of the hope of having &quot;model children&quot; in  <br/>
the eyes of church friends.<br/>
<br/>
But even those who have no religious basis for control can control  <br/>
the joy right out of their child&#39;s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-No one&#39;s telling you to change your ideas. We are saying the ideas  <br/>
you&#39;re presenting won&#39;t be left to sit on the list without being  <br/>
countered. If you don&#39;t want them countered, don&#39;t bring them to the  <br/>
list. If you don&#39;t want to change, don&#39;t bring it to the list.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think some people are saying &quot;If you want to unschool, changing  <br/>
your ideas will help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Joyce noted that one post was 90% about the mom.  That might be a  <br/>
ruler people can add to their toolboxes.  When there&#39;s angst and  <br/>
frustration, how much is about the mom&#39;s feelings?  How much of it is  <br/>
adversarial, even without having been intended?  Remembering to have  <br/>
a partnership relationship might help, when the mom is feeling that  <br/>
the child isn&#39;t doing what would make  her feel better:<br/>

<br/>
Is it the inverse, or is it just the ultimate other side of the  <br/>
gradual curve?<br/>
<br/>
I remember Marty and Kirby, when they were babies, toddlers, at La  <br/>
Leche League park days.  Kirby liked to go off with someone else, but  <br/>
he would come back and sit with me.  Marty, two and a  half years  <br/>
younger, would sit with me for a long time--an hour, maybe--and then  <br/>
when he got ready to get up, he would go by himself, and far, too, in  <br/>
his little baby waddle.  Because he knew he was safe, and because he  <br/>
knew he could come back when he wanted to, he had a huge amount of  <br/>
courage.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still like that, with them, at 22 and 19.  Marty has driven to  <br/>
other towns, other states, but he comes back home.  Kirby moved away,  <br/>
but with a roommate he knew, and works with people he knew before.   <br/>
He&#39;s still a little more cautious.  When they were babies they were  <br/>
babies of the people they are.<br/>

When something is forbidden the parent is in essence saying &quot;You&#39;re  <br/>
not strong enough for that. You can&#39;t handle it. It&#39;s more powerful  <br/>
than you are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s an effective way to get most kids to push their boundaries,  <br/>
like jumping off a high wall. &quot;I bet you can&#39;t. That&#39;s too high for  <br/>
you to jump off.&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Kids will push their boundaries. They should be. They&#39;re growing and  <br/>
changing and so are their limitations. They need to keep testing  <br/>
them. But there isn&#39;t a reason for them to jump way beyond their  <br/>
limitations *unless* someone else is saying they know the child&#39;s  <br/>
limitations better than the child.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re our children&#39;s partners, we can be with them as they test  <br/>
their boundaries. They won&#39;t be sneaking off to a friend&#39;s house to  <br/>
watch Friday the 13th. They can watch little bits of it. They can  <br/>
watch it with the lights on. They can fast forward. They can say &quot;Not  <br/>
ready yet,&quot; because they know they can always try again later if they  <br/>
want to.<br/>

My girls (12 and 13) could also watch Friday the 13th but neither of them<br/>
want to.  I was really into scary movies and books as a teen but they don&#39;t<br/>
think they would like them and so they choose not to watch them or read<br/>
them.  My younger dd has a fantastic imagination and she writes great<br/>
stories that are borderline horror stories.  I&#39;ve mentioned that she might<br/>
like some horror stories but she&#39;s not ready to go there yet and that&#39;s<br/>
fine.  She&#39;d rather write stories than read other people&#39;s stories at this<br/>
point anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I was a huge Stephen King fan as a teen and I&#39;ve yet to kill anyone even<br/>

One thing my girls and I do enjoy watching together is crime shows.  The<br/>

Despite that, they are the gentlest souls I know.  <br/>
