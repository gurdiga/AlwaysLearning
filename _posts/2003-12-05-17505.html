<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616343832">with the move  I havent had much time lately but still been trying to read as <br/>
often as possible.<br/>
things have been hoping here.<br/>
my oldest daughter  has a 5 year old and  suprised me by putting her in school <br/>
this year.keeps calling me saying mom why they pushing destiny to read she <br/>
reads just not what they want and mom they told me she cant do her abc&#39;s in <br/>
upper and lower case and the meeting with the teacher led to a fight they <br/>
marked her off bunch  because her m&#39;s look like upside down w&#39;s.<br/>
Suprise  I was shocked they  even did that in kindergarden.she  talked to me <br/>
about unschooling and  cirrclumn and so forth. she said mom that is what we <br/>
have always done with her  she knew abc and so forth going in there because it <br/>
was fun learning before and she and i did things now they  call me assine me <br/>
homework to work with her and  she dont always answer them when they ask her <br/>
things she says she dont because they are mean and yell.<br/>
her m&#39;s dolook like upside down w&#39;s big deal. what is that all about?<br/>
she called said &quot;mom I like her and me better before and I like her  <br/>
socalization before better,as I knew who her fiends where  I am confused  are <br/>
you right and my freinds wrong and dad is having fits that I am thinking of <br/>
home schooling her.&quot;<br/>
she will also have problems with the faternal grand mother as she is a <br/>
kindergarden teacher. she is afraid they will use  it as a excuse to futher <br/>
there case in custody battle.<br/>
I think I can talk to the faternal grandmother and smooth edges out.as for my <br/>
ex and his mother  no way they  think I am to lax and that destiny wont ever <br/>
learn anything ever I had to tell my daughter look hun it your kid not mine I <br/>
told you when you put her in school  you would but heads with the system and <br/>
you are. They did the testing  and she was way above  grade level because of <br/>
the fun you 2 had at home now that you have to do it in there way it not fun <br/>
for either of you, you know my opion on it and you know what is right for the 2 <br/>
of you I will not judge you onyour choice either way and yes will watch my <br/>
grand child when you need to work I just wont get up and drive across town if <br/>
she is here at 7 in the morning to get her to a school bus. if you keep her in <br/>
school you will have to work that one out(we are not big on baby sitters We <br/>
have  teens that watch others in family for week end money and mine dont want <br/>
to get up at 6:30 to do anything and isnt old enough to drive any way)<br/>
oh I might mention  my daughter even tryed switching schools and same thing <br/>
with the w&#39;s and m&#39;s what up with that one/<br/>
who cares about the  lil points heck I am impressed they dont look like side <br/>
way e&#39;s and like her mother and me we  will use upper and lower case all wrong. <br/>
when did kindergarden get so ...pissie?<br/>
