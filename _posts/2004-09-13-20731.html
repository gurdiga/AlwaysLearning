<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202546754">Thank you Deb, for portraying my original post about &quot;waiting for<br/>
Sandra&quot; in its original intent...as a light humor about Sandra <br/>
telling us to behave while she was away. It wasn&#39;t in response to anything <br/>
else, and I couldn&#39;t for the life of me figure out how it had been seen as <br/>
blind following. If anything, once I sent it, I worried again about using <br/>
humor on email...it doesn&#39;t always come through the way I mean it (you <br/>
caught the wink, thank you) and it certainly was misconstrued this time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jacki</div>
