<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142877797">&lt;&lt;-=-OOoo, how about putting the food coloring in little travel spray pumps <br/>
and tie-dying with that!-=-&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sounds good for adults but scary for a four year old to have a spray <br/>
pump of stain. &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ohhhh, I&#39;m thinking of my 10-year-old Miss Sorscha!  We play in our huge <br/>
sand area (I&#39;ll take a picture for the blog soon) with water and food <br/>
coloring all the time.  She likes to make what she calls her version of a <br/>
Pokemon Civilization (her words).  She will mix a small wheel barrel with <br/>
sand, water and food coloring and tint the sand different colors.  Then <br/>
she&#39;ll let walls, etc. harden in the sun.  It&#39;s beautiful.  Now I&#39;m thinking <br/>
we could add some spray-bottling technique to it.  UHHHHHH sooooo excited! <br/>
Hmmm, and I had the choice to read the 4/5 year-old activity thread. Should <br/>
I change it to the 10/40 year-old activity thread? How about the &#39;cool stuff <br/>
thread&#39;.<br/>

Food coloring on snow can be fun.  We tired to make a Bart Simpson  <br/>
snowman, though, and it just wouldn&#39;t get yellow enough, so we ended  <br/>
up using spray paint!! &lt;g&gt;  DEFINITELY not recommended for toddlers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880686338">Just to mention, there is spray frosting that can be used very artistically. Tastes terrible, so after we bought some and decided not to ruin a cake with it, it became backyard spray paint. It doesn&#39;t wash off any faster than the acrylic paint they fingerpainted onto the back porch, though. It&#39;s just not so toxic. One really cool ghosty face has lasted months.  We also used to spread a large (8&#39;x6&#39;) sheet of heavy plastic in the kitchen and give them paints (tempera, usually) and paper, or paper plates, or cardboard boxes, or small unfinished wooden things, or 25-cent baskets from the Salvation Army store.  Often they painted in their underwear, then ended up painting their bodies.  This offers still more fun in the tinted bath which follows.  Plastic comes in huge rolls available at hardware stores.  We also have spread it out on the floor to play in bubble stuff and in uncooked  grits, a winter &#39;sand.&#39;  When the fun is done, roll it up and<br/>
 throw the plastic out.  We have also recently built &#39;log cabins&#39; out of popsicle sticks from the dollar store. One house is very planned and tidy, and one is &quot;like the Weasley&#39;s house, all tippy.&quot;  Emily asked to paint something with acrylic paints again, so they are going to paint the picnic table. This resulted a few years ago in a porch with very sweet multicolored hand prints, etc. I can&#39;t wait to see what will end up on the picnic table this summer.  Cameron                        <br/>

the other and roll them together from one corner to the other - put a  <br/>
little piece of tape to hold the roll together - you can build with  <br/>
the newspaper &quot;logs.&quot; You can build HUGE structures and if you&#39;re  <br/>
thoughtful about how you build, they can be very very strong. Use  <br/>
masking tape or scotch tape to build with.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while to roll enough logs to have a lot of fun with them -  <br/>
so I suggest parents (with kid help as much as they want) sit and roll  <br/>
logs for a few hours one evening  - maybe while watching tv. Then the  <br/>
kids can have a plentiful supply to build with.<br/>

Is that rolling diagonally? Or more &quot;on the square&quot;, so to speak? How small  <br/>
is the diameter (or radius if that is easier) of the &quot;log&quot;? Do you just stack  <br/>
them on top of each other (log-cabin style) or do you tape or connect them in <br/>
 some way? This sounds awesome! Thanks for sharing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286990584">If you lay the papers down flat, one on top of each other, start from  <br/>
the lower right corner and roll it up to the upper left corner.  <br/>
They&#39;re about an inch across when you&#39;re done. They&#39;re STRONG - way  <br/>
stronger than you&#39;d expect. You don&#39;t have to stack them up - you can  <br/>
use them like you&#39;d use sticks - build frames, fill in with sheets of  <br/>
newspaper, if you want. Tape them together.<br/>
