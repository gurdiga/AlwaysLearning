<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The cable that comes with the software is a 1/8&quot;stereo plug to a pair of RCA<br/>
plugs. The 1/8&quot; plug goes into the sound input jack (on the iMac it has a<br/>
picture of a microphone next to it). The RCA plugs go into the back of the<br/>
HiFi. The receptacle should be labeled &quot;Rec Out&quot; or &quot;Line Out.&quot; If you&#39;re<br/>
buying a second hand turntable be sure that your HiFi has a &quot;Phono&quot; input<br/>
The turntable needs that kind of input to sound correct.  Some Hifi&#39;s make<br/>
you select what is being recorded, if that is the case, set it to phono.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The software you need comes with Roxio Toast Titanium 5.0.1. This is a<br/>
different version of Toast that is usually included with a CD writer. The<br/>
software for recording from LPs or cassettes to your computer is &quot;Spin<br/>
Doctor&quot;, and it is in the &quot;Roxio Music&quot; folder of the Roxio Toast program.<br/>
Be sure to set the input in the Input menu to &quot;Sound In.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The software has fairly clear instructions on how to record the music to the<br/>
computer using pop and rumble filters to get rid of unwanted LP noise, how<br/>
to delineate individual songs as tracks, to name them and to transfer them<br/>
to the Toast software that writes the CD.  The package also has software to<br/>
print labels and duplicate CDs.  Once it&#39;s all set up it&#39;s way easier than<br/>
writing out this post&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
If your iMac doesn&#39;t have that &quot;mic&quot; jack on the side, it gets much more<br/>
complicated. But Input devices that utilize the USB buss are made.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a Windoze user, Roxio&#39;s product is Easy CD Creator.  Look at the<br/>
box, but I&#39;m sure it can do all of these same things.  I have Macs for a<br/>
reason, good luck &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Personal Note: I would feel very bad if I just helped 150 people record and<br/>
distribute bootleg music.<br/>
[Soapbox ON] I work in the entertainment industry<br/>
and many of my friends and colleagues make their living writing, producing,<br/>
and playing music.  Making copies of copy written work for use by someone<br/>
who did not pay for its use is in affect stealing. Making copies, on CDs or<br/>
tapes, of your own CDs or records or tapes FOR YOUR OWN USE is OK but GIVING<br/>
OR SELLING THEM to others IS *BAD* please don&#39;t do it.  This holds true for<br/>
most of the material on all those internet sites that let you download copy<br/>
written work like the old Napster and now Gnutella type sites.<br/>

I&#39;ve gotten a few Beatles&#39; albums on CD, and while it&#39;s convenient, it&#39;s just <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703256764">I just wanted to share.....do due this list, my son<br/>
just got to meet two actual live unschoolers.  They<br/>
had a good time!!!<br/>
<br/>
Julie made the effort to drive from her MIL on St<br/>
Simon Island in Georgia down to MY HOUSE just north of<br/>
Jacksonville yesterday. Julie lives in Texas! We were<br/>
SO excited anticipating their arrival...and then they<br/>
did! Julie has five adopted children.  She brought the<br/>
two older ones Adrian, 11, and Zack, 8, with her.  It<br/>
was so GOOD.  Roy is 8 and never met any unschoolers. <br/>
All of the kids had attended school at one point, so<br/>
they even had that in common.  <br/>
<br/>
I was so worried as my house looked like 52-card<br/>
pick-up, and the $%#@^%$&% MS has been bothering me,<br/>
but Julie quickly reassured me.  Zack and Roy wandered<br/>
around inside and outside and did little boy stuff. <br/>
Roy was so delighted to have a BOY, not just Mama to<br/>
do things with.  Roy is NOT a loner, as I have always<br/>
been.  It was easy to see that we did things way<br/>
different than at Julie&#39;s house, but she made it OK. <br/>
We even play &quot;Sorry&quot; different.  <br/>
<br/>
It would sure be fun if lots of us could get<br/>
together....there is space here (29 acres...pristine<br/>
river to swim, depending on weather and floods, etc)<br/>
to camp out.  May would be a good time.....before it<br/>
gets too hot here. Indoor plumbing :) electricity.<br/>
Firewood....unless there has been a drought at that<br/>
time and there is a temporary burn ban....but we do<br/>
have a kitchen and on the porch a fish cooker....<br/>
<br/>
A few of us are trying to arrange to get together,<br/>
about then, but the more the merrier.  Everyone wants<br/>
to go to the conference in October, including<br/>
me....but that is such a long time away! This would be<br/>
for the children. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone thinks it might be fun  or that it would be<br/>
particularly not fun, please e back. Travel would be<br/>
the biggest expense.  Which is a problem for lots. In<br/>
my far and distant youth I hopped trains in Canada and<br/>
hitched in USA and Canada....but I DO NOT recommend<br/>
that.  <br/>

<br/>
When my turntable was newer, and now when it&#39;s in the mood, you can program <br/>
tracks.  It has a little light-reader-thing that sees where the tracks are, <br/>
and you can tell it to play three and then 5, 6, 7.  Or tell it to play #3 <br/>
over and over.<br/>

the timing is right for us (work wise, etc.) then<br/>
count us in! It sounds like a fabulous place you&#39;ve<br/>
got there. My oldest (as in known since I was a year<br/>
old) friend lives in Florida and we could get in a<br/>
visit to her as well.<br/>
LOL! Tamzin just said to me, &quot;Isn&#39;t Disneyworld in<br/>
Florida? Maybe we could go there too!&quot;. We&#39;ll have to<br/>
ponder on that one. Anyone have tips for Disneyworld<br/>
on a very restricted budget?<br/>
Thanks for the invite!<br/>

&gt;When my turntable was newer, and now when it&#39;s in the mood, you can program<br/>
&gt;tracks.  It has a little light-reader-thing that sees where the tracks are,<br/>
&gt;and you can tell it to play three and then 5, 6, 7.  Or tell it to play #3<br/>
&gt;over and over.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It used to work fabulously, 15 years ago. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

can see how old it is.<br/>

&gt; Oh Shyrley,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m envious. I think my friend Jeanne might be going<br/>
&gt; too, she usually does (she&#39;s living in Norfolk at the<br/>
&gt; moment). I can&#39;t believe how big HesFes has gotten!<br/>

gear in England so I wouldn&#39;t have to lug it across the Atlantic.<br/>
The kids think we&#39;re going and can&#39;t wait to meet up with all their<br/>
friends again.<br/>
Still, I got a month to make up my mind. We might win a lottery before<br/>
then :)<br/>
