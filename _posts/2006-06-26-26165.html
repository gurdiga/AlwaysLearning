<br/>
Here are two pretty nice video games or pieces of art.  Both.<br/>
<br/>
That first one can be played online or downloaded.<br/>
The second one (which was the first one historically speaking, I  <br/>
think) is a PC download but you can watch a video of some of it from  <br/>
a Mac or PC.<br/>
