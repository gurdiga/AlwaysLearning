<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336704632">This is one that comes through my e-mail periodically from some some folks I know.  It is opposite of unschooling, though it sure shows what we need to sometimes keep in mind about our children&#39;s friends and how their parents feel about them.<br/>
<br/>
No admittance about the possible substance abuse issues, leaving organized religion, etc they had as teens and young adults, or rebellion from all this dragging.  The parents just want to be right and say that they have done their part, so if you develop problems, they aren&#39;t at faullt.<br/>

&quot;I HAD A &quot;DRUG PROBLEM&quot; WHEN I WAS A CHILD<br/>
<br/>
AND ALSO AS A TEENAGER.................<br/>
<br/>
  I WAS &quot;DRUG&quot; TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNINGS.....<br/>
<br/>
  I WAS &quot;DRUG&quot; TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY EVENINGS......<br/>
<br/>
  I WAS &quot;DRUG&quot; TO CHURCH ON WEDNESDAY EVENINGS......<br/>
<br/>
  I WAS &quot;DRUG&quot; TO SUNDAY SCHOOL EVERY SUNDAY.......<br/>
<br/>
  I WAS &quot;DRUG&quot; TO VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL EVERY SUMMER.......<br/>
<br/>
  I WAS &quot;DRUG&quot; TO THE FAMILY ALTAR TO READ THE BIBLE......<br/>
<br/>
  I WAS &quot;DRUG&quot; TO THE WOODSHED WHEN I DISOBEYED MY PARENTS.....<br/>
<br/>
THOSE &quot;DRUGS&quot; ARE STILL WITH ME.......AND THEY AFFECT MY BEHAVIOR IN EVERYTHING I THINK, SAY, OR DO. THEY ARE STRONGER THAN COCAINE, CRACK, OR HEROIN!!<br/>
<br/>
IF OUR CHILDREN HAD THIS &quot;DRUG PROBLEM&quot;, AMERICA WOULD CERTAINLY BE A MUCH BETTER PLACE, AND MANY OF ITS PROBLEMS WOULD BE NONEXISTENT<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919056565">I used to get the same kind of thing. I asked repeatedly to be removed from<br/>
forwarding lists of people who did this. For a while, maybe it seemed like<br/>
success when I wrote in that I wasn&#39;t interested (since I wrote in, that<br/>
might have seemed to show interest).<br/>
<br/>
Then one forward came in that could be refuted with a snopes link, and<br/>
because I thought it was an unnecessarily scary lie (fear about women being<br/>
attacked, some bit that relied on a supposed news item to back up the<br/>
story), I wrote in with &quot;reply all&quot;. Then after another one went through I<br/>
checked by snopes and wrote in with another &quot;reply all.&quot; That&#39;s when the<br/>
forwards stopped. I don&#39;t even get other ones anymore since then, such as<br/>
praising war in God&#39;s name.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of forwards which don&#39;t use a false claim that&#39;s easily<br/>
fact checked. I was lucky I could fact check something and stop those<br/>
things.<br/>
