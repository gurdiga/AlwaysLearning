<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607560152"><div dir="ltr">Hi, Sarah,<div><br></div><div>I feel your pain.  I have also from time to time found myself in groups where the folks don&#39;t always seem the nicest.  </div><div><br></div><div>If your goal is to figure out how to stay in that group and make the best of it for yourself, you may find &quot;the work&quot; of Byron Katie to be useful.  At the risk of oversimplifying, she basically says first, that our suffering is (always) caused by our thoughts, and if we can challenge our thoughts, we become more peaceful.  She has a formula of questions that she recommends that we ask ourselves about our negative thoughts, starting with, &quot;is it true?&quot;  Then, &quot;are you absolutely sure it&#39;s true?&quot;  So maybe it&#39;s true that the other parents are catty and mean, or maybe it&#39;s not.  If you can find other reasons to attribute to their behavior, then maybe that will help you just move through them without worrying about whether they are being mean or not.  Second, one of Katie&#39;s other famous sayings is something like, &quot;If I had a prayer, it would be not to worry about what other people think of me.&quot;   Katie has lots of videos online, and of course many books and a website; I have found her work to be very helpful in keeping me from getting too worked up about stuff.</div><div><br></div><div>And finally, to quote one of my other heroes, &quot;when they go low, we go high.&quot;  Good luck.</div><div><br></div><div>Brenda Dixon</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1607560152gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1607560152gmail_quote">On Mon, Mar 20, 2017 at 10:12 AM, Sarah Thompson <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:thompsonisland@...">thompsonisland@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1607560152gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54555497">-=-Others might make different choices--maybe having a grandparent take the kids to the group, hiring a helper to go, asking dad to do it...  My focus would be on doing the better thing for my boy because I chose to homeschool him.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Once the friendship is more firmly established, you might (possibly) ask another family in the group to let your son go with them.  That way the younger brother could do something else with you, and not be following his brother around in ways that might not be adding to the peace of their relationship.<br/>
<br/>
You could invite kids over that your son likes and not just depend on the group, maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035014826"><div dir="ltr">My daughter was part of a co-op for social reasons- and she liked the classes- that i also tried to support and be involved in. While it did not get nasty with me- there was certainly plenty of other drama that I managed to stay out of- it was hard to embrace as there were real conflicts of intention and goals.<div><br></div><div> I found that by being involved more indirectly- rather than in any leadership role- was kind of a happy medium.  It sounds like this is the situation you&#39;re in, and that is probably the best place. Staying out of the drama and just being kind and neutral may end up serving the organization and perhaps you&#39;ll find people come around when the realize that you are not contributing to the &#39;poison.&#39;</div><div><br></div><div>The conflicting intentions and goals of our co-op essentially contributed to it breaking down, and then a core group who really wanted the the same thing started it up again. The rest of us did not re-join or try and push our own agenda in their new thing. It was for the best- it serves them well. There was no need to make it be everything or everyone, or meet all of our diverse needs.  </div><div><br></div><div>Also, kids change. Not sure if this runs through the summer, but maybe your kids will not be interested in returning. Maybe you can continue some friendships outside of the formal group over the summer and that will meet Wallace&#39;s social needs and he wont&#39; even want to go back. Or maybe he will, but more time and a break will give a needed pause and getting back together won&#39;t seem so challenging. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_quote">On Mon, Mar 20, 2017 at 12:09 PM, Brenda Dixon <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:brendagdixon@...">brendagdixon@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-2035014826gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

I was asked to join to be involved in the advisory council that was supposed to be establishing this as a new group. My kids said they wanted to join so I agreed.

There were some disagreements and the director has treated me very poorly, as well as some other members who got into a catty, melodramatic dynamic that has made the whole thing uncomfortable.

I don&#39;t think I should contine to be around some of these women; there are some patterns already and I worry that they will persist and poison the whole organization. </div><div><br></div><div>However, my kids say they want to stay. My younger child hasn&#39;t made any friends, really; he follows his brother around and makes it hard for him to do his own thing. He is finally really happy at home because he has started to make online friends in games. He says he wants to stay because the older child, Wallace, wants to stay, but he&#39;ll do what Wallace does. Wallace wants to stay because he IS making friends and having fun. Since I joined this organization for them, I should stay in it for them, but I don&#39;t know how to navigate an environment that is petty and hurtful in a healthy way for myself while staying positive for my kids, and all the kids I am organizing programming for (with whom I have a terrific rapport). </div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div>
