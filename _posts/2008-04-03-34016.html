<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487215726">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list a month or 2 ago and have been reading avidly<br/>
since. I am very interested in attending a conference in the future<br/>
and have a couple of questions. I think that the Live and Learn<br/>
conference this fall is going to be the last one? <br/>
<br/>
My daughter will only be 2. My question is - is it worth it for me to<br/>
go this year when she is still so young? I would love for my husband<br/>
to go also, but I doubt I can convince him this year. I guess part of<br/>
me thinks that I can wait a couple more years (especially since my<br/>
daughter is so little and I will probably bring her)but since this is<br/>
the last one have thought that maybe I should try to go. Or maybe I<br/>
should just wait and go to a different one later on...<br/>
<br/>
If I did decide to go -- how toddler-friendly are these events?<br/>
Ideally I could have someone there to help me with her, but I don&#39;t<br/>
know if that is an option for us at this point....<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any input!<br/>
<br/>
Susan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840702828">I went to the Link conference in California when my kids were 4 and 2.  I loved every minute of it.  For me it was great to go when they were little because then they were raised with me having a more relaxed approach.  I learned so much.  I bought a few tapes from some of the talks that I listen to now that they are older and I get new meaning out of it because of their age.  <br/>
The things I have learned at the conference have helped me in many aspects of my life.  Learning is always good.  If you have a chance to go, I would go.<br/>
