<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054494849">I can totally relate with you on the dilema of<br/>
unhealthy relatives.  Our choice was to live at a<br/>
distance, see them seldom, and control the environment<br/>
and terms on which we do see them.  These combined<br/>
factors have allowed our children to know their<br/>
grandparents (for instance) in a healthy way while<br/>
remaining unaffected by their negative and unhealthy<br/>
behaviors.  We don&#39;t allow these relatives to have our<br/>
kids overnight alone or to babysit them, nor do we<br/>
plan extended visits at their homes.  When visiting us<br/>
they stay elsewhere nearby (camping, hotel, etc) and<br/>
we limit visits to a few days maximum.  Public/neutral<br/>
territory to meet on is a very good thing as well.<br/>
<br/>
As Sandra suggested, we gave our extended family the<br/>
ultimatum of either treating us with decency and<br/>
respect or not seeing us at all, and then stopped all<br/>
visits (maintaining amicable letter/picture/phone<br/>
contact) for two years to give them time to mull this<br/>
over and take us seriously or not and/or adjust their<br/>
interactions with us, as well as give us time to heal<br/>
and cope with past issues with these folks within<br/>
ourselves.  This time span was not a punishment to<br/>
them, but a much needed physical and emotional break<br/>
from each other.  I believe it&#39;s easier after such a<br/>
break (not necessarily 2 years, but it should be a<br/>
good deal longer in comparison to whatever the normal<br/>
interval has been between visits and interactions) for<br/>
both parties to &quot;start fresh&quot; without real or imagined<br/>
injuries fresh in the mind and with the courteous<br/>
distance of relatives who have not seen each other for<br/>
a while allowing you to set a new tone to your<br/>
interactions for the future.  Your mileage may vary on<br/>
this idea.  We also offered literature as Sandra<br/>
suggests and said we&#39;d be happy to discuss it after<br/>
they had read it (&quot;Put up or shut up&quot;)  Refusing to<br/>
fight about it is a good idea.  Who cares what they<br/>
say or think anyway?  If they can&#39;t be reasonable,<br/>
mature and decent, don&#39;t put any weight in what they<br/>
say.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as holidays go, we choose to stay home on<br/>
holidays for many reasons such as creating our own<br/>
special traditions, basking in quiet family<br/>
togetherness without stress and conflict, not desiring<br/>
to travel during poor weather and peak traffic<br/>
congestion, not enjoying hectic crowded events,<br/>
avoiding drunken relatives, and more easily catering<br/>
to our certain family members&#39; specific special<br/>
medical and dietary needs.  With the medical and<br/>
dietary needs as a consideration and the travel<br/>
weather factor for us over two mountain ranges it&#39;s<br/>
easy enough for us to make our excuses without<br/>
offending anyone. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I, too, didn&#39;t understand what was meant &gt;&gt;my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;talking back.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It really means that children are not permitted to<br/>
relate to adults on the level of equal human beings,<br/>
and not allowed to question authority or orders given<br/>
or discipline meted out.  I just finished reading<br/>
James Dobson&#39;s The Strong Willed Child and I am still<br/>
dizzily digging my way out from under all the self<br/>
righteous slag and King James scripture.  Amusingly,<br/>
his books concepts are mainly backed up and<br/>
illustrated by his quoting of himself in his own<br/>
previous books or tapes (when he&#39;s not quoting<br/>
scriptures that is.)  This book, for those not<br/>
familiar with it, is a handbook for fundamentalist<br/>
Christians in the correct manner for administering<br/>
corporal punishment (beatings with a switch or belt<br/>
recommended, as well as other nerve or muscle pinches<br/>
advised) to children &quot;at every instance of<br/>
disobedience.&quot;  James Dobson, FYI, is a PhD clinical<br/>
psychologist,- marriage, family and child counselor,<br/>
has been a staff professor and attending physician in<br/>
prestegious children&#39;s hospitals and universitites and<br/>
is the founder of the Focus on the Family organization<br/>
which produces a worldwide radio program among other<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
The book recommends not beginning corporal punishment<br/>
until children are over 6 months of age, and that one<br/>
should &quot;take great care&quot; with large teenagers as<br/>
attempting corporal punishment with them can have<br/>
dangerous results.  I&#39;ll say!  They are big enough to<br/>
defend themselves!  The book explains that this method<br/>
is critical in &quot;good Christian&quot; homes because<br/>
otherwise the children will not grow up to submit<br/>
themselves to every authority in their lives such as<br/>
bosses, landlords, professors and so forth, but<br/>
chiefly so they can &quot;submit themselves to the<br/>
authority of God.&quot;  He repeatedly asserts that without<br/>
threat of looming punishment even adults would not<br/>
behave themselves.  He also repeatedly refers to<br/>
children as brats, which I think is telling.  He uses<br/>
his own family and children as his chief and only<br/>
named examples of proper techniques and discipline,<br/>
gives entire long speeches which parents are to<br/>
utilize verbatim with their children, (he suggests<br/>
making copies of these as well as charts in the book)<br/>
and of course also explains how responding to infant<br/>
cries &quot;too readily&quot; will create a spoiled and<br/>
manipulative child.  <br/>
<br/>
It was like a 240 page peep show window into a certain<br/>
broad cross section of American culture that is pretty<br/>
scary to behold, particularly in light of the current<br/>
administration.  The question and answer sections in<br/>
each chapter with &quot;real questions from readers&quot; was<br/>
particularly interesting.  Dobson even does some John<br/>
Holt bashing, which I found wryly amusing.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband was asking me why I was &quot;wasting my time&quot;<br/>
reading it, was I rubbernecking the train wreck of it<br/>
or what?  But you can&#39;t make intelligent arguments<br/>
against something without being educated on the<br/>
subject.  This book has sold millions of copies and is<br/>
considered a &quot;moderate&quot; not an extreme pro spanking<br/>
book.  I feel kinda dirtied now that I&#39;ve finished it<br/>
though, so I think I better read something else to<br/>
cleanse my brain.  Any suggestions folks?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We (me and dh) find ourselves unceremoniously and<br/>
&gt;quietly putting on the shelf family members we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;leave ds with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a good thing to do.  It hurts because we want to<br/>
unequivocally trust our family with our child in a big<br/>
fuzzy happy village of love.  But reality intrudes and<br/>
we need to do what we need to do to ensure the<br/>
physical and emotional safety of our children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is an ongoing diplomatic process that is<br/>
&gt;resulting in a silent stalemate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The silent stalemate is better than the bloody feud or<br/>
silently suffering and allowing your children to<br/>
suffer.  If you feel the loss of a larger family<br/>
group, begin building a new family of choice around<br/>
yourself of friends and their families of various ages<br/>
whom you CAN trust your child and yourself with. <br/>
Families are built by love and there are many people<br/>
in them not blood related to each other.  In a family<br/>
of choice there&#39;s more love, less blood, in more ways<br/>
than one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can&#39;t help but see that there&#39;s no need to hit<br/>
&gt;any child but the oldest, since spanking works it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;way to the youngest in unbroken chain from child to<br/>
&gt;child (and from child to pet or object when no<br/>
&gt;person is available), a transfer of violence<br/>
&gt;downward through the ages.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This notion of course is in direct opposition to<br/>
Dobson&#39;s work, who states that the claims of spanking<br/>
begetting a cycle of violence are &quot;Poppycock!&quot; but<br/>
doesn&#39;t back that up with much reality of course. <br/>
Train wreck indeed.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;spanking is contagious and I need to get away from<br/>
&gt;it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure the stress of being there is not doing your<br/>
patient mommy tendancies or building communication and<br/>
trust with your child any favors either.  Why people<br/>
abuse themselves in the name of &quot;family&quot; in this way<br/>
is baffling to me.  Just don&#39;t do it.  Send pictures,<br/>
letters, cards, phone calls from kids to Grandma or<br/>
Aunt Betty or Uncle Joe, but keep your distance for<br/>
health and sanity&#39;s sake!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I told a family once they could NOT spank their<br/>
&gt;child in my house, when they threatened.   I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want my kids to have to see it; it&#39;s just too <br/>
&gt;disturbing. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra<br/>
<br/>
Ooooo, that&#39;s ballsy.  I never know where to draw that<br/>
line at what to tell people they can and can&#39;t do to<br/>
their kids in my home.  It&#39;s good to know that you<br/>
draw the line there and I can use your example to<br/>
bolster my courage.  What do you do about people<br/>
telling their kids what they can and can&#39;t eat and do<br/>
while in your home, both when the parents are present,<br/>
or as pre drop off instructions?  I know this topic<br/>
has come up here before but I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
details.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I used to get hyper vigilant about my kids&#39; behavior<br/>
&gt;when I was in a place where the others were<br/>
 </span></blockquote>over-&gt;controlling their own kids and being irritated<br/>
that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;mine were there.   I really wanted mine to just not<br/>
&gt;make waves, don&#39;t rock the boat, and I&#39;d be sharp<br/>
&gt;and impatient in those instances, but they <br/>
&gt;always understood during the debrief in the car<br/>
&gt;afterward (or wherever) why I was nervous <br/>
&gt;in such situations.   <br/>

Glad I&#39;m not the only one.<br/>

His weekly column is featured in our local newspaper.  I read it to see what drivel he recommends.  I once wrote a letter to the editor against spanking, in response to one of his columns.<br/>

Often I make pained faces at the mom behind the kid&#39;s back (like she&#39;s at the <br/>
door looking in, and the kid can&#39;t see me and I&#39;m doing the &quot;You gotta be <br/>
kidding&quot; looks &lt;g&gt;).    If it&#39;s someone I know well and they know me well, <br/>
there&#39;s way less of any of that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were younger there was more, and I&#39;d let the mom do all her <br/>
speech, but I never felt bound by it.   <br/>
<br/>
We kept some kids once for a long day and the parents said we should spank <br/>
them if they were bad and I said nah, I didn&#39;t think so, so she said that&#39;s <br/>
fine, just tell them what the kids did wrong when they picked them up.     Nothing <br/>
happened that I felt like reporting. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

unhealthy relatives.  Our choice was to live at a<br/>
distance, see them seldom, and control the environment<br/>
and terms on which we do see them.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was pretty much how we dealt with my mother when she was alive. She<br/>
passed away last January, as I have posted before I think. She lived in<br/>
Galveston, TX and one of her great aspirations was to have us also move<br/>
there - fat chance! <br/>
<br/>
When she would start displaying her ignorance on the phone I would<br/>
immediately end the conversation - nicely but at once. EG: She: Jayn should<br/>
be writing her name by now. Me: No she shouldn&#39;t good bye Mum I love you<br/>
talk to you soon. Click.<br/>
<br/>
Then I would send her a website from a source that she would likely respect<br/>
(this was crucial) on the topic. Usually I would get an apologetic or at<br/>
least respectful email after a few days. It really was ignorance on her<br/>
part, rather than rigidity. I can&#39;t remember what I sent her about the early<br/>
name writing.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of sources she would respect the example I can always remember is<br/>
about breast feeding - I sent her the page from American Academy of<br/>
Pediatrics since she had a lot of respect for Doctors like her dh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;This time span was not a punishment to<br/>
them, but a much needed physical and emotional break<br/>
from each other.  I believe it&#39;s easier after such a<br/>
break (not necessarily 2 years, but it should be a<br/>
good deal longer in comparison to whatever the normal<br/>
interval has been between visits and interactions) for<br/>
both parties to &quot;start fresh&quot; without real or imagined<br/>
injuries fresh in the mind and with the courteous<br/>
distance of relatives who have not seen each other for<br/>
a while allowing you to set a new tone to your<br/>
interactions for the future. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was born my dh called his mother to tell her of the name we had<br/>
chosen. Her first response was &quot;oh I don&#39;t like *that* name&quot;. Dh replied,<br/>
very steadily and calmly although with no sense of wavering or pleading,<br/>
&quot;Mom..I don&#39;t want to hear your negativity.&quot; Click - by her that is. <br/>
<br/>
We did not hear from her for 2 years. But she is not an ordinary<br/>
grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I feel kinda dirtied now that I&#39;ve finished it<br/>
though, so I think I better read something else to<br/>
cleanse my brain.  Any suggestions folks? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have read enough about Dobson and the Ezzos on line to know that it makes<br/>
me too sad - I lose sleep worrying about all these poor children.<br/>

Brain cleansing literature - the latest Alfie Kohn &quot;Unconditional<br/>
Parenting&quot;; &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot; by Valerie Fitzenreiter; &quot;The Explosive<br/>
Child&quot; by what&#39;s-&#39;is-name; &quot;The Aware Baby&quot; by Aletha Solter and of course:<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling .<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What do you do about people<br/>
telling their kids what they can and can&#39;t eat and do<br/>
while in your home, both when the parents are present,<br/>
or as pre drop off instructions?  I know this topic<br/>
has come up here before but I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
details.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When our neighbor recently got on the phone and started going on about her<br/>
kids not eating &quot;junk food&quot; - a rather vague designation that varies<br/>
depending on the child - at our home, dh simply and clearly said, &quot;No I&#39;m<br/>
not going to enforce that here.&quot; He is so inspiring. Part of my response is<br/>
to put away the chocolates and cookies and chips and lollipops - so that it<br/>
is not putting temptation cruelly right in front of them (also they will<br/>
take candies and secrete them about their persons and smuggle stuff home). <br/>
<br/>
What I have said to them in the past, especially if they have come in<br/>
unannounced and then seen and wanted something that I suspect is forbidden,<br/>
is to say that I doubt that they should because their mother will probably<br/>
not allow them to return if she thinks they are coming here and eating<br/>
candy, and offer them some strawberries or grapes instead. It never felt<br/>
perfect, but it was really about saying something that Jayn would hear as<br/>
not being my choice to refuse someone food. <br/>
<br/>
However with James being so upfront, now I just say &quot;I don&#39;t know if your<br/>
mother would want you to have that, so if you are hungry please go home to<br/>
eat and then you can come back&quot; (It&#39;s just 40 feet down the hall - everyone<br/>
else always brings their own kid&#39;s food in a sack). If it is a kind of treat<br/>
(for them) like I have made brownies or James&#39; birthday cake, I will have<br/>
them phone their Mom for her permission - also if they started to argue<br/>
about it being something they were allowed. So far she has always said yes,<br/>
so I am even more confused. <br/>
<br/>
To be honest it still doesn&#39;t feel perfect - although better - but the<br/>
upside is that I am not being eaten out of house and home. In the past,<br/>
especially before I only allowed one over at a time, they would very swiftly<br/>
clean us out of foods that I can only assume are designated &quot;treats&quot; at<br/>
their place - snack size Pringles, small chocolate bars, Smarties (the US<br/>
kind), any cookies we had except for oatmeal (too healthy?), corn chips and<br/>
popcorn. I have even become reluctant to make popcorn because Renee takes<br/>
hers and pours a *ton* of extra salt onto it (last time she left us with<br/>
NONE in the shaker until I bought more). With Jayn I don&#39;t care what she<br/>
chooses to add to her popcorn, because she is living free of food related<br/>
emotional issues, but I don&#39;t know about Renee. I have to think that even a<br/>
big pile of salt on the rare occasions she is here probably won&#39;t hurt her -<br/>
but I would hate to be proved wrong if she turns out to have high blood<br/>
pressure or some undisclosed medical condition. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;I used to get hyper vigilant about my kids&#39; behavior<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;when I was in a place where the others were<br/>

<br/>
Add me to the list. I feel that Jayn is something of a &quot;target&quot; of criticism<br/>
because of her wild hair also. I have worked really hard at not being sharp<br/>
and impatient sounding, sort of living by example if I can - with mixed<br/>
success, but I certainly feel a lot of stress at those times.<br/>

What is it with that phrase &quot;did they behave?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
As if I would ever say &quot;no&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The only exceptions have been Renee stealing my diamond ring (as previously<br/>
reported) and Renee trying to touch Jayn&#39;s private parts last summer - and<br/>
with this issue that I would consider extremely problematic, I was lightly<br/>
assured it was &quot;normal&quot; and that her older cousin had treated Renee the same<br/>
way when she was the same age! I felt brushed off rather than reassured.<br/>
Renee thought she could try the same &quot;game&quot; again recently - funny how it is<br/>
happening just when said older cousin is visiting. I just watch - every<br/>
single second they are together.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that I think is rather odd. Whenever Renee comes over here<br/>
for a playdate, within 2 or 3 minutes of arriving she ALWAYS goes to the<br/>
bathroom for a lengthy b.m. (to judge by the time spent and air quality<br/>
following). I mean *ALWAYS*. I wonder if she somehow relaxes when she comes<br/>
here and the result is an urgent need to go....<br/>
<br/>
Jonah does it too, but not so fanatically *always*, just *usually*, shortly<br/>
after arriving.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, thanks.   I like to think of it as the brain-massage side of cleansing <br/>
rather than the brain-wipe. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Maybe some of the links on the spanking page, about people who did and now <br/>
don&#39;t.   That might be a balm to your post-James-Dobson reading.   <br/>

The book explains that this method<br/>
is critical in &quot;good Christian&quot; homes because<br/>
otherwise the children will not grow up to submit<br/>
themselves to every authority in their lives such as<br/>

A not so horrific example was the boy lost in Utah recently who hid  from his <br/>
rescuers because he was told never to talk to strangers.  <br/>
 <br/>
It would have been horrific if they had not found him, I guess.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Y&#39;all have the greatest resources!  I have read &quot;Punished by <br/>
Rewards&quot; and am now reading &quot;How to Talk So Kids Can Learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I should also mention... the great ideas about how to handle <br/>
parenting conflicts.  They&#39;re wonderful.  Even in conflicts of views <br/>
between two married parents of the same household, some of these <br/>
ideas are applicable, I would think.  Eventually, the path of least <br/>
resistance (usually warned against) may appeal to the more rule-<br/>
oriented parent.  One could hope, couldn&#39;t one?<br/>

Exactly my point about obedience.  You don&#39;t want to encourage that <br/>
really.<br/>

I also read a great book called &quot;The Dance of Connection&quot; by the <br/>
author of &quot;The Dance of Anger.&quot;  Very helpful in dealing with <br/>
conflicts and finding your own voice.  I needed it especially in the <br/>
situation with my in-laws.</div>
