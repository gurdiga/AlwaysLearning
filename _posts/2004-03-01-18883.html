 </span></blockquote>Unschooling means &quot;not&quot; schooling. It means living without the <br/>
trappings of school. Maybe some day (maybe sooner than we think &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
learning will no longer be equated with schooling and even schooling <br/>
will no longer mean what it does today - lecturing, testing, imposed <br/>
curriculum, grades, assignments, and learning during specific <br/>
hours/days. Until then, it makes sense to me that we are defined by the <br/>
fact that we do NOT do those things - we do not do school. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
talk about what we do instead - but that is not what distinguishes us <br/>
from how other people educate their children. My oldest daughter went <br/>
to school until 4th grade. When she was in school she was schooled, but <br/>
she also learned &quot;naturally&quot; - she learned through games and <br/>
conversation and real life, just like she continued to do, later, as an <br/>
unschooler. The ONLY difference was that when she was in school she was <br/>
also &quot;schooled.&quot; We pulled her out and then she was no longer schooled <br/>
- hence, she &quot;unschooled.&quot; The natural learning just kept right on <br/>
going, through it all. While it is true that unschooled kids don&#39;t have <br/>
the roadblocks in their natural learning pathways that school sets up, <br/>
to say we are &quot;natural learners&quot; as if kids in school don&#39;t also learn <br/>
&quot;naturally,&quot; sets up a false dichotomy. Remember, much of what kids <br/>
learn in their lives is learned outside of school, naturally, even in <br/>
spite of lecturing, grading, homework, assignments, and <br/>
one-size-fits-all curriculum. Even though it takes up far more of their <br/>
lives than seems healthy to us, school isn&#39;t their ENTIRE life and <br/>
natural learning happens in schooled kids lives, too.<br/>
<br/>
In response to the question, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t the term &#39;natural learning&#39; be <br/>
more affirming than the use of the negative in the term &#39;unschooling&#39;?&quot; <br/>

&quot;Lots of people make this point, but I never see the negation as <br/>
negative in a value-judgment sense when I use the word--to me <br/>
unschooling is as positive as unchaining, unbinding, unleashing, <br/>
unfolding, unfurling, unlimiting....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All mean freedom and growth and vast possibilities to me.&quot;<br/>
