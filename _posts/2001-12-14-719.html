<div id="ygrps-yiv-130766654">Having pondered this a bit,  no,  it wouldn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
What would bother me is if my children felt they couldn&#39;t talk about<br/>
sexuality in our home.  My oldest is almost 10...I think we&#39;ve got the door<br/>
open.  She has a few older friends which has brought some sexuality issues<br/>
to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
What I hope for my children is that they will be responsible, loving, caring<br/>
people in their relationships.  As they mature and develop into adulthood,<br/>
I hope their intimate friendships are based on love, honor and respect for<br/>
each other.<br/>
