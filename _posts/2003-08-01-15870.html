<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345775001">Thought I&#39;d share with you all what Kyra, my 6 yr old daughter, has been up to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been hearing her ask other kids if they want to play her new card game.  Its called Mystery.   <br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t really thought a whole lot about it.  Well,  the other day she comes and asks me if I&#39;d like to play.  &quot;Sure!&quot;  I say.  So we sit down and she deals out 7 cards to each and says not to look at them.  She then puts the pile of remaining cards in the middle, facing up.   She says we can&#39;t look out our own cards but we have to hold them up so the other person can see them.<br/>
<br/>
Then you play kind-of like Go Fish.  Look at the other persons&#39; hand,  are there any pairs? If there are you get to take them for a point.  Then next, you pick a card out of your own hand, still can&#39;t look at your hand.  Look at the one you picked, does it match with any in your opponent&#39;s hand?  If it does you take the one out of the opponent&#39;s hand,  if not put it back and draw the top card off the pile.   It is now the next person&#39;s turn.  You keep doing this until someone runs out of cards,  then the game is done.   If you are left with cards in your hand you have to deduct pairs from your collection.   Then, the person with the most pairs wins! <br/>
<br/>
It was pretty fun,  I thought it was just a little step up from Go Fish as far as challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Can you believe my little 6 year old thought this up??<br/>
<br/>
Its so funny we keep saying,  &quot;you can&#39;t look at the card,  that&#39;s why its called A Mystery!&quot; &lt;g&gt; Like a commercial or something!<br/>
<br/>
Kids are amazing.  Now if I had been pushing phonics or other things on her,  she might not of had any of these creative thoughts!<br/>
<br/>
Cool!<br/>

That is a cool game!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe look up Rio Grande Games and write and see if they&#39;re interested.  (You <br/>
can find it with Google.)  They&#39;re publishing various card games, but would <br/>
know where to refer you if that&#39;s not something they&#39;d be interested in.    <br/>
They do original games and reprints/translations of German (mostly) games.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another games publisher called Cheapass games you might contact if <br/>
she&#39;s interested in maybe publishing it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060304109">You can actually publish them??  Cool,  I&#39;ll check it out.<br/>
<br/>
My other dd, Abbi(8),  said  something along those lines.  In her words,<br/>
&quot;Kyra could earn something like $5,000 or something!&quot; &lt;g&gt;  Cute!<br/>
<br/>
I kind-of wondered if it actually was her idea,  but I don&#39;t think there is<br/>
anything like it.  There is some deductive reasoning in playing it because<br/>
at some points you know what cards you have but you don&#39;t know where they<br/>
are, cause you mix them.  And then you get rid of some and you could keep<br/>
track of that.<br/>
<br/>
Abbi and I just got done playing a round of it and we started talking about<br/>
percentages/probability.   &quot;I have 50% chance of getting a card that matches<br/>
yours because I have 4 cards and I know 2 are the same as yours.&quot;   Then on<br/>
to 66% chance.  Abbi didn&#39;t much like the game at first,  it was weird<br/>
holding cards facing out, ackward shuffling them that way.   But in the end<br/>
thought it was pretty cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84620649">Glad you like it Jen.    I always like a chance to brag up my unschooly<br/>
kids!  :)<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, if my description wasn&#39;t clear, feel free to<br/>

class in high school.  &lt;blech&gt;<br/>
