<div id="ygrps-yiv-443823075">Loved the link to Donny Osmond doing his white guy dance during the<br/>
entire White and Nerdy song. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWc6QQ9JlMc&feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWc6QQ9JlMc&feature=related</a><br/>
for those of you who missed it.<br/>
<br/>
Donny really brought it!  Did anyone else notice him signing ROTFLOL??<br/>
 (At one minute 55 seconds.)As any true Osmond Brothers fan knows, he<br/>
has older brothers who are hearing impaired. I was SO in love with<br/>
Donny when I was a youngster.  (I was in love with Jay too.) Tiger<br/>
Beat posters were all over my bedroom walls.  <br/>
<br/>
Loved the Bob Dylan palindrome video too!! For palindrome fans, Jon<br/>
Agee writes great palindrome books, one of which is called &quot;Go hang a<br/>
salami! I&#39;m a lasagna hog! and other palindromes.&quot;  His books are kind<br/>
of like comics, they tell the story of the palindrome. Lots of fun to<br/>
look at with the kids.  One of my faves: Eva, can I stab bats in a cave?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517303625">Ok I wanted to watch that again.  :D  Thanks for saying Donny was signing.<br/>
I totally missed that so I went back to see.  I wish I knew what he was<br/>
signing while Weird Al was singing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048165913">I finally figured that out after I pulled up the lyrics.  I tried my hardest<br/>
to get my fingers to move that fast.  I&#39;ll want to do it a lot more to get<br/>
it going that speed.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even pay attention to Weird Al... that&#39;s how visually funny Donny<br/>
Osmond&#39;s dancing is.  When I read the lyrics though... I about blew a gasket<br/>
a few times.   The green screen was the most fun for me I suppose because my<br/>
eyes don&#39;t focus on so many things.<br/>
