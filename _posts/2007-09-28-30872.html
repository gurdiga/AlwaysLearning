<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522577666">I&#39;ll be gone for eight days, from home. Sometimes I&#39;ll be on the  <br/>
internet, but not a whole lot.  It&#39;s possible that some posts will  <br/>
sit a while before being approved. Please don&#39;t post twice; just  <br/>
wait.  If those others with the ability to approve posts (or not to)  <br/>
would check in more while I&#39;m gone, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday I&#39;m speaking at the MHA conference.  My face is on the cover  <br/>
of the schedule, so I feel special pressure to do well.  &lt;g&gt;  Then  <br/>
Holly and I are going to hang out with Kelli Traaseth&#39;s family and be  <br/>
tourists and houseguests.<br/>

Because I&#39;m not going to be around much, I would really like to ask  <br/>
that the conversation turn away from the defense of limiting and  <br/>
controlling kids.  There are hundreds of other lists where that&#39;s  <br/>
discussed gleefully.  I don&#39;t want this to become one of them.<br/>
<br/>
The archives are linked at the bottom of every post (of those getting  <br/>
html mail) and is listed below for the rest.  Anyone who&#39;s  <br/>
unconvinced should read archives, or Joyce&#39;s site, or mine (links to  <br/>
many others are there...)<br/>
