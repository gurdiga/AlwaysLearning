<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867481273">Help.  My 9 year old daughter hates to change her clothes.  I don&#39;t mind if she wears the exact same outfit for as long as she lives, however I would like to wash them every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
  She wore a one piece bathing suit for over a year about 3 years ago.  I just washed it every other day and she wore it with pants and sometimes a shirt over it.  It fell apart in the washing machine and by then she was ok with that.<br/>
<br/>
What I have been doing now is asking the kids to take a shower or bath on Wednesday nights and Saturday any time.  I also ask them to brush their teeth and put clean clothes on every morning.

Natalie took a shower tonight while I was at work.  When I came home and saw that she had put on her dirty (crunchy with food bits) clothes...even her dirty underwear I reacted badly.  I told her it was gross.  She said she put on her dirty clothes because she only has to put clean clothes on in the morning.  I told her putting dirty clothes on a clean body does not make sense to me.  I really hurt her feelings.  <br/>
<br/>
On one hand I would like to honor her need to wear the same clothes (it&#39;s the idea of changing she hates...not an attachment to a specific set of clothes this time) on the other hand how do I let go of my need to see her in clean clothes?  <br/>
<br/>
She has a nervous habit of picking her lips and wiping the blood off on her shirt...whenever she picks a scab she spreads the blood all over her clothes.  It looks gross.  I can understand the fascination with blood...I did the same thing when I was a kid....but ewwww...she walks around looking like an assault victim who got in a food fight.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541941599">Man, this is a hard one! At first, two suggestions popped into my head. One, <br/>
grab her clothes as soon as she gets into the shower and throw those suckers <br/>
into the wash. May not work though as it would take hot/cold water away from <br/>
her shower and two, they take a while to dry. Hmmmm. I was also remembering <br/>
a book that I saw at Barnes and Noble that was written for younger girls <br/>
(maybe ages 10-14) that discussed hygiene and why it&#39;s important without <br/>
being gross. My daughter has developed a habit of grabbing/holding her <br/>
vagina in public which drives me up the wall! I asked her &quot;do you have an <br/>
itch?&quot;...&quot;no&quot;......&quot;Do you have to go pee??&quot;.......&quot;no&quot; THEN WHY ARE YOU <br/>
GRABBING YOURSELF LIKE THAT??!!! Her response? &quot; I just like it&quot;. And that&#39;s <br/>
that. I don&#39;t like it but when I first started saying things to her, I could <br/>
tell that she didn&#39;t get why the public found this to be innappropriate. <br/>
Kids just do things that they like I guess and it seems to ring true for <br/>
your daughter as well.  About the lip thing, that sounds plain painful!!! It <br/>
all brings up a great point, how do you tell a kid that society deems some <br/>
things to be plain &quot;gross&quot;..and do we believe these things too out of what <br/>
we have learned growing up? HMMM like why is it ok for a man to adjust <br/>
himself in public when, if a woman did it it would be just plain disgusting <br/>
(like she&#39;s dirty or something??)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31874124">I think it kindof depends on the source of her resistance to clothing changes.  If she feels like it&#39;s too much trouble to locate pants, and a shirt, and undies, and socks, maybe it&#39;s just easier to put on the stuff she&#39;d already been wearing.  If that&#39;s the case, maybe it would help to group her clothes in complete outfits, or set out something for her, or see if she&#39;s got any ideas to make getting some clothes together easier.  If it&#39;s the feeling or smell (or something) of clean clothes she doesn&#39;t like, maybe see if a different detergent or dryer sheet would change things.  Or maybe softer fabrics.  I&#39;ve got family members with very strong convictions about how clothes can feel (especially regarding seems, collars, sleeves, anything that can potentially chafe or rub or constrict), so maybe it&#39;s got something to do with already-worn clothes being less irritating.  I&#39;d recommend seeing if you can get any more information about her reasons, and then seeing if a workable<br/>
 solution presents itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677578378">-=-Help. My 9 year old daughter hates to change her clothes. I don&#39;t  <br/>
mind if she wears the exact same outfit for as long as she lives,  <br/>
however I would like to wash them every now and then.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can she take a shower in the clothes?<br/>
<br/>
I live in New Mexico where wet things get dry quickly, so that seems  <br/>
a potential solution from my geographical and practical point of  <br/>
view.  If you live in a very humid place that won&#39;t work, but if  <br/>
you&#39;re in the desert somewhere, maybe you could wash them while  <br/>
they&#39;re on her, somehow.<br/>
<br/>
For most of a year, when Marty was four, he wore a one-piece tiger  <br/>
costume outfit.   When he was playing outside in the water or taking  <br/>
a long bath with toys, I would wash it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Both of them use their clothes as napkins (no big deal...I don&#39;t  <br/>
care about stains) so by the end of the day they are pretty crunchy. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just about stains, though, it&#39;s about living in the world  <br/>
with other people.  There are ways to discuss that without seeming  <br/>
mean, I think.  If they had lots of shirts and would change after  <br/>
each meal, that would make more sense.  But planning around wiping on  <br/>
clothes instead of tissues or handkerchiefs seems bad.<br/>
<br/>
Would they like cloth napkins?  Thrift stores or garage sales...<br/>
What about handkerchiefs or scarves (cotton scarf tied around the  <br/>
neck just for napkin or blood-wiping?)  Thrift stores.  You can find  <br/>
cartoon character scarves or other cool scarves, and washing those  <br/>
would be way quicker and easier than washing clothes so much, and  <br/>
would wean them off to paper napkins, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I reacted badly. I told her it was gross.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well it was gross.  Probably not as gross for a nine year old girl,  <br/>
though, as it would be for a grown woman (in the same-underwear matter).<br/>
<br/>
An honest mom reaction like &quot;GROSS!&quot; can&#39;t be so awful.  A mom can  <br/>
overdo it, certainly, but for a mom Never to respond from her honest  <br/>
feelings is too far the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe read this article on balance if you&#39;re feeling too guilty about  <br/>
an honest gross-out moment:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/balance">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-On one hand I would like to honor her need to wear the same  <br/>
clothes (it&#39;s the idea of changing she hates...not an attachment to a  <br/>
specific set of clothes this time) on the other hand how do I let go  <br/>
of my need to see her in clean clothes? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could change the words and thoughts.  It shouldn&#39;t be so  <br/>
much &quot;your need to see her in clean clothes.&quot;  It&#39;s not about your  <br/>
eyes, or your mind.  It&#39;s about bacteria and appearance and  <br/>
sanitation.   The germs and crustiness she&#39;s collecting on dirty  <br/>
clothing gets back out into and onto other things in the house--beds,  <br/>
furniture...<br/>
<br/>
-=-She has a nervous habit of picking her lips and wiping the blood  <br/>
off on her shirt...whenever she picks a scab she spreads the blood  <br/>
all over her clothes. It looks gross. I can understand the  <br/>
fascination with blood..-=-<br/>
<br/>
In such cases as blood or stains, I always would say &quot;Blood stains  <br/>
and I want to wash it out while it&#39;s fresh.&quot;  I&#39;d soak it in cold  <br/>
water a while and really make sure I got it out.<br/>
<br/>
I figured part of my job as a mom was to maintain clothing, and cloth  <br/>
can only take so much abuse before it starts to break down or gets  <br/>
uncleanable.  Different cloth is different ways, and there are men&#39;s  <br/>
work clothes designed to take lots of abuse.  Jeans can take lots of  <br/>
chemicals and washing all kinds of ways.  Some cloth, no, though.   <br/>
But I would tell the kids, honestly, that it was better for stains  <br/>
not to stay on cloth too long if we wanted to make the cloth last  <br/>
longer and look better.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t guess your daughter cares, but you might (I definitely did)  <br/>
say you&#39;re unwilling to take her out looking that way.  Are you  <br/>
staying at home so  much that these things don&#39;t matter?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe get out of the house more.  Ask her the night before what she  <br/>
wants to wear, and say you need to wash that so she can wear  <br/>
something clean when you go out.<br/>
<br/>
I told my kids (honestly and truly) that homeschoolers get the  <br/>
critical eye from others, and I didn&#39;t want any trouble with the  <br/>
county about not being a good mom.  That was my defense about how  <br/>
they dressed in public or out in the front yard or on the street in  <br/>
front, and it&#39;s a valid one.  There are laws about parents taking  <br/>
care of their children.<br/>

GRABBING YOURSELF LIKE THAT??!!! Her response? &quot; I just like it&quot;. And  <br/>
that&#39;s<br/>
that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s THAT!?<br/>
<br/>
People, people, people...<br/>
Some things are illegal.<br/>
Some things aren&#39;t illegal, but still have an intractable wrongness  <br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t just say &quot;and that&#39;s that&quot; about a child rubbing himself or  <br/>
herself sexually or seemingly-sexually in public.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t like it but when I first started saying things to her, I  <br/>
could<br/>
tell that she didn&#39;t get why the public found this to be  <br/>
innappropriate. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you can explain why and she understands it, then she should stop.<br/>
If you can&#39;t explain why, or you can and she just doesn&#39;t understand  <br/>
it, then she should stop *BECAUSE* you can&#39;t explain it, but that it  <br/>
could get you a big damned visit from child social services.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Kids just do things that they like I guess -=-<br/>
<br/>
Parents need to just explain to kids that some things they like to do  <br/>
cannot and must not be done in front of other people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-HMMM like why is it ok for a man to adjust<br/>
himself in public when, if a woman did it it would be just plain  <br/>
disgusting<br/>
(like she&#39;s dirty or something??)-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;ok&quot; for a man to do it, but when a woman needs to do it  <br/>
it&#39;s sometimes because there&#39;s an uncleanliness situation.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a girl who&#39;s doing that a lot has rawness or irritation she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know is not normal.  Maybe &quot;light days&quot; pads would help, or  <br/>
just changing underwear.<br/>
<br/>
-=-how do you tell a kid that society deems some<br/>
things to be plain &quot;gross&quot;..and do we believe these things too out of  <br/>
what<br/>
we have learned growing up? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if you &quot;believe&quot; the thing or not.  It is a fact  <br/>
that touching certain parts of one&#39;s body is *NOT* okay in public and  <br/>
it&#39;s not going to become okay in any of our kids&#39; lifetimes.   It&#39;s  <br/>
not what the kids want to do nor what the parents believe, about  <br/>
things like this:<br/>
<br/>
Picking one&#39;s nose at a formal dinner (or a McDonald&#39;s).  Not good.<br/>
<br/>
Putting a bare foot on a dining table during a meal (or even a foot  <br/>
with a show on it).  Unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Flashing parts that should be covered (women&#39;s breasts, anyone&#39;s  <br/>
pubic area)--probably illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Rubbing any sexual parts in front of any people one is not engaging  <br/>
in sex with--probably illegal for minors and mostly for adults if  <br/>
money is being exchanged, depending on the jurisdiction and whether  <br/>
it&#39;s a strip club or peep show.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to flat out ask whether there are really parents who  <br/>
have considered not telling their kids about such things.<br/>
Holly spit the other day in a parking lot.  Right there.  Right on  <br/>
the ground in a parking lot.  I told her to find some dirt next time,  <br/>
a trash can maybe, or to spit near a tree where nobody was going to  <br/>
need to walk.  I complained quickly and definitely.<br/>
<br/>
In 1935 men used to spit on the ground, and nasty brown tobacco crap  <br/>
too, but in 2007, people should NOT spit where other people are walking.<br/>

I have noticed that Liam, my son, now looks to me for guidance on <br/>

A friend of mine&#39;s visiting Zimbabwe.  I googled a bit and wrote to  <br/>
him and said &quot;Don&#39;t eat with  your left hand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S.  people are two-fisted eaters.  There (and many other  <br/>
places) food is not touched with the left hand during a meal.  YUCK!   <br/>
Might as well hock a loogie in the stew.<br/>

Kids learn LOTS by getting out and about, and they need to know what  <br/>
behavior and dress and posture and noise level and vocabulary are  <br/>
expected and acceptable when they&#39;re out and about.<br/>

was a phase, that he was just exploring another part of his body and<br/>
he was little, so it didn&#39;t seem to matter as much. Other people<br/>
usually thought he needed to pee, so he got lots of &quot;Do you need to<br/>
use the bathroom?&quot; questions from friends & family.<br/>
<br/>

his clothing, which we resolved but by then it had become an<br/>
unconscious habit to grab himself. So we talked about how it&#39;s okay to<br/>
touch any part of his body when he&#39;s in private space - the bathtub,<br/>
his bedroom, etc. But when he is in other areas of the house or when<br/>
we are in public, it&#39;s not polite to touch his genitals, even on top<br/>
of his clothes.<br/>
<br/>
We use the words &quot;stop holding&quot; as a gentle reminder whenever we saw<br/>
him doing it. At first we had to say it about 30 times a day for a<br/>
couple months (this habit was hard to stop!) but we managed to get the<br/>
message across without shaming him. He still does it occasionally,<br/>
especially when his skin comes into contact with a particular fabric,<br/>
but *he* is aware of doing it now and will go change into something<br/>
else or put underwear on underneath his pants/shorts.<br/>

&gt;that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;that. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s THAT!?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;People, people, people...<br/>
&gt;Some things are illegal.<br/>
&gt;Some things aren&#39;t illegal, but still have an intractable wrongness<br/>
&gt;to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can&#39;t just say &quot;and that&#39;s that&quot; about a child rubbing himself or<br/>
&gt;herself sexually or seemingly-sexually in public.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-I don&#39;t like it but when I first started saying things to her, I<br/>
&gt;could<br/>
&gt;tell that she didn&#39;t get why the public found this to be<br/>
&gt;innappropriate. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you can explain why and she understands it, then she should stop.<br/>
&gt;If you can&#39;t explain why, or you can and she just doesn&#39;t understand<br/>
&gt;it, then she should stop *BECAUSE* you can&#39;t explain it, but that it<br/>
&gt;could get you a big damned visit from child social services.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-Kids just do things that they like I guess -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Parents need to just explain to kids that some things they like to do<br/>
&gt;cannot and must not be done in front of other people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-HMMM like why is it ok for a man to adjust<br/>
&gt;himself in public when, if a woman did it it would be just plain<br/>
&gt;disgusting<br/>
&gt;(like she&#39;s dirty or something??)-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not &quot;ok&quot; for a man to do it, but when a woman needs to do it<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s sometimes because there&#39;s an uncleanliness situation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Maybe a girl who&#39;s doing that a lot has rawness or irritation she<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t know is not normal.  Maybe &quot;light days&quot; pads would help, or<br/>
&gt;just changing underwear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-how do you tell a kid that society deems some<br/>
&gt;things to be plain &quot;gross&quot;..and do we believe these things too out of<br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt;we have learned growing up? -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It doesn&#39;t matter if you &quot;believe&quot; the thing or not.  It is a fact<br/>
&gt;that touching certain parts of one&#39;s body is *NOT* okay in public and<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s not going to become okay in any of our kids&#39; lifetimes.   It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;not what the kids want to do nor what the parents believe, about<br/>
&gt;things like this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Picking one&#39;s nose at a formal dinner (or a McDonald&#39;s).  Not good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Putting a bare foot on a dining table during a meal (or even a foot<br/>
&gt;with a show on it).  Unacceptable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Flashing parts that should be covered (women&#39;s breasts, anyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt;pubic area)--probably illegal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rubbing any sexual parts in front of any people one is not engaging<br/>
&gt;in sex with--probably illegal for minors and mostly for adults if<br/>
&gt;money is being exchanged, depending on the jurisdiction and whether<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s a strip club or peep show.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want to flat out ask whether there are really parents who<br/>
&gt;have considered not telling their kids about such things.<br/>
&gt;Holly spit the other day in a parking lot.  Right there.  Right on<br/>
&gt;the ground in a parking lot.  I told her to find some dirt next time,<br/>
&gt;a trash can maybe, or to spit near a tree where nobody was going to<br/>
&gt;need to walk.  I complained quickly and definitely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In 1935 men used to spit on the ground, and nasty brown tobacco crap<br/>
&gt;too, but in 2007, people should NOT spit where other people are walking.<br/>

&gt;so they know what&#39;s appropriate in the big world and, more<br/>
&gt;importantly, what isn&#39;t.  I think, in fact, that it was Sandra who<br/>
&gt;illustrated this point for somebody when she suggested that we see<br/>
&gt;our kids as honored guests from a vastly different culture with<br/>
&gt;vastly different customs.  We owe it to our guests to let them know<br/>
&gt;in a confidential way that their different customs will not be cool<br/>
&gt;here!  Not to shame them, just to let them know that it just plain<br/>
&gt;ain&#39;t cool here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hocking a loogie on the street just ain&#39;t cool, and neither is<br/>
&gt;grabbing one&#39;s crotch.  I&#39;d *want* to know about these things if it<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t already in my consciousness, and I&#39;d be ever grateful to the<br/>
&gt;one who cared enough about me and my experience to help me understand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have noticed that Liam, my son, now looks to me for guidance on<br/>
&gt;these things.  He trusts me to tell him straight and tell him kindly<br/>
&gt;and in a non-embarrassing way what&#39;s okay and what isn&#39;t.  He *wants*<br/>
&gt;to know.  I&#39;m really glad that we have developed that aspect of our<br/>
&gt;relationship.<br/>

moved and I had just had another baby -- that it wasn&#39;t really a <br/>
problem for me to help her wear the shirt she wanted to wear. I <br/>
looked at it as a gift to her to take it off her at night while she was <br/>
sleeping and wash it for her. I felt it was the least I could do <br/>
when there was a lot going on that she didn&#39;t have any say over <br/>
and she wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled about. <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I also agreed that we weren&#39;t going to take her <br/>
out in public in her &quot;dirty shirt&quot; when, eventually, it didn&#39;t get clean. <br/>
We lived in L.A., and not only did we get a lot of scrutiny because <br/>
we homeschool, but having four children in the Westside of L.A. <br/>
made us conspicuous as well. <br/>
<br/>
But, she could look presentable when she put a jumper or a <br/>
dress on over it. I  found another shirt that she also liked and <br/>
eventually that one would work, too.<br/>
<br/>
Now, BTW, she&#39;s 5, and she loves wearing lots of different kinds <br/>
of clothes!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son also liked wearing the same clothes when he was <br/>
between 6 and 11. Even now, he usually has one pair of shorts <br/>
(he wears shorts in SoCal year-round), and I wash them a few <br/>
times a week. He has other pants, if need be. He&#39;s just happier <br/>
being comfortable and familiar clothing feels good to him. For a <br/>
while, he had one shirt, too, that he wore like a uniform -- and I&#39;d <br/>
wash it regularly and ask him not to wear it when it looked too <br/>
dirty. (Part of it with him is the time-saving angle as well.) <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I, too, wear limited clothing options. That is, I <br/>
tend to get in clothing jags myself. As long as the clothes are <br/>
clean and I&#39;m not in the workplace, where it could become a <br/>
source of gossip/cattiness, it works. Right now, I have a dress <br/>
that I got on a clearance rack at Target that fits well and looks <br/>
fairly dressy, and I wear that a lot. Men always hold doors open <br/>
for me when I&#39;m wearing it.  I also have some more casual <br/>
clothes -- T-shirts and leggings and cropped jeans, but my <br/>
Target dress gets worn a lot, particularly if I&#39;m going to be out <br/>
and about. <br/>
<br/>
My husband buys five or six pairs of the exact same pair of pants <br/>
every few years. Which exact brand/style of pants he buys will <br/>
change, but they&#39;re always the same color (black) and he always <br/>
buys multiple copies of the same pair. He also will find <br/>
long-sleeved button-down shirts he likes to wear to work and <br/>
rotate them through his closet. He&#39;s also very disciplined and will <br/>
&quot;retire&quot; a shirt when he gets a new one, so he always has the <br/>
same number of shirts in his closet. He likes doing that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also noticed other friends who do the same thing -- wear the <br/>
same clothes, just wash them more frequently.<br/>
