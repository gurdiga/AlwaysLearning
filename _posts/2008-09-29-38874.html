<div id="ygrps-yiv-71970401">Ok have done a bit of reading and i understand the concept of<br/>
unschooling and how this approach to learning can work. <br/>
<br/>
I have afew very simplistic questions though and I beg tolerance from<br/>
you all for my ignorance....<br/>
<br/>
Firstly...<br/>
<br/>
If you have children who you fear will never write of their own accord<br/>
do you find ways to have them write even though they aren&#39;t initiating<br/>
it themselves?<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to math if a child doesn&#39;t initiate learning in this are<br/>
beyond the most basic functions how do you teach it without<br/>
compromising your unschooling philosophy?<br/>
<br/>
Currently we use a range of curricular materials to teach English and<br/>
writing and math but everything else is what I consider to be<br/>
unschooling in that I read aloud to the kids and anything beyond that<br/>
is optional. If they don&#39;t want to listen to me reading then they are<br/>
expected to play quietly near by so at least they can hear me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling and how this approach to learning can work. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have read enough to have a slight idea but not enough yet to <br/>
&quot;understand&quot; it or you wouldn&#39;t need to ask these particular questions.<br/>
There is tons of really good reading material for you at <br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling  helpfully sorted into topics. All topics <br/>
lead to others. Start almost anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; If you have children who you fear will never&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Unschooling has freed me from fear.<br/>
<br/>
Truly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;how do you teach it without<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; compromising your unschooling philosophy? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t teach anything. The minute you do, you are not unschooling during <br/>
that wasted minute.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Currently we use a range of curricular materials to teach English and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; writing and math but everything else is what I consider to be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We eat eggs and some chicken, but our diet is what I consider to be vegan, <br/>
in that I put out platters of cheese and anything beyond that is opitional. <br/>
If they don&#39;t want to swallow then they are expected to put the cheese on <br/>
their plate so at least they can smell and taste it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Get the picture?<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to unschool then don&#39;t, but really for the sake of your <br/>
internal clarity, don&#39;t call what you are doing &quot;unschooling&quot;. You&#39;re not, <br/>
yet. You could though.<br/>

&gt; do you find ways to have them write even though they aren&#39;t initiating<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, stop for a bit and think about writing - what IS it, really?  <br/>
What type of writing are you concerned with? Are you worried about the  <br/>
mechanics of penmanship? Or are you thinking about their ability to  <br/>
express themselves? For what purposes? Is it for making a shopping  <br/>
list or writing a letter to Grandma or write a book report? Are you  <br/>
talking about young kids, but worried about their ability to write an  <br/>
essay for college? Really stop right now, before you continue reading  <br/>
this response, and think for yourself about writing - maybe stop and  <br/>
write us a post in which you describe the kinds of writing you think  <br/>
your children ought to be doing and how they&#39;d benefit and why it  <br/>
seems important to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t really answer the question as you asked it, because you  <br/>
assumed the existence of fear. Experienced unschoolers simply don&#39;t  <br/>
have that fear anymore. But, you might really want to know why we  <br/>
don&#39;t have that fear, right? So I suggest that the question you ought  <br/>
to be asking is, &quot;For those whose kids don&#39;t write of their own  <br/>
accord, why are you NOT worried that your non-writing children are  <br/>
not, in fact, writing?&quot; Also, &quot;Do you find ways to get them to write?&quot;  <br/>
is a legitimate question and probably not as simple as some people  <br/>
might think.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you go ahead with my suggestion above and then come back and  <br/>
ask the other questions.<br/>
<br/>
Same for math. Exactly what math learning are you worrying about and  <br/>
why?<br/>
<br/>
We can talk in generalities, but it would help you most if we could be  <br/>
very specific.<br/>

<br/>
You took a peek and have a glimpse, but if you understood how it  <br/>
could work, you wouldn&#39;t have written the rest of your post!  No  <br/>
matter. I&#39;m sure people will have given you some great suggestions by  <br/>
now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helps with understanding natural learning is examining  <br/>
your language and thoughts in the areas of teaching, learning,  <br/>
knowing and understanding.   It seems like that&#39;s something for an  <br/>
extra day years down the line, but if you do it up front, you&#39;ll have  <br/>
LOTS more extra days down the line.<br/>

Holly, especially, is very artistic in her writing.  Kirby resisted  <br/>
hearing about the mechanics of writing until recently.  He&#39;s 22  <br/>
(well, he&#39;s 21 in Texas until October 30, because they  made an error  <br/>
on his driver&#39;s license), and lately he truly does care.  He needed  <br/>
to submit a writing sample at work when he was applying for a  <br/>
supervisory position, and he began then to really want to be  <br/>
technically good.  He called me about semi-colons.  I explained it  <br/>
and the next time he used one he sent it to me and asked if it was  <br/>
right.  It was.  I&#39;ve sent him a couple of candid uses of my own, and  <br/>
told him why I used them.<br/>
<br/>
For a mom who isn&#39;t sure about the how and why of semi-colons, there  <br/>
are webpages galore, and books.  It&#39;s also easy to avoid using semi- <br/>
colons for one&#39;s entire lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
There are some writing samples and stories at the link above.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a teeny recent sample of Holly&#39;s writing.  She was expressing  <br/>
herself candidly about a frustration about which I found her crying.   <br/>
I was really sad for her.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For the last two weeks I&#39;ve been playing a new game of Harvest Moon  <br/>
(a wonderful life) and it&#39;d been really great, and I was going to  <br/>
marry Nami, and my cow was pregnant, and I think it was already  <br/>
winter, and I was working on getting a lot of chickens, and I had  <br/>
some trees planted, and a lot of fish in my pack. So yeah today I  <br/>
saved my old game over it accidentally. I&#39;m pretty pissed and  <br/>
embarrassed and discouraged. I think I want to start a new game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She could have cleaned this writing up if she had needed to, but this  <br/>
is the way it came out.  She types REALLY fast, with her two middle  <br/>
fingers, by the way.  She texts on the phone, and she&#39;s used instant  <br/>
messages for years.  She uses writing in real ways, in dynamic and  <br/>
immediate ways, which is more than can be said for most people.  Her  <br/>
handwriting isn&#39;t pretty, for lack of practice.  She hasn&#39;t been  <br/>
living in pen-and-paper world, and honestly, she never needs to if  <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>

I know another lady who plans activities to do with their kids on a<br/>

understanding whilst they are participating in these activities. She<br/>
also encourages them to come up with their own activities and then she<br/>
looks for teachable moments in which she can extend their learning she<br/>
too considers herself and unschooler. This too could work for me once I<br/>
am a little more knowledgable and can have my concerns and questions<br/>
answerred to my satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
So my understanding of unschooling at this stage is that it varies from<br/>
family to family but that it centers on the interests of the children<br/>
rather than the educational goals of the parents. Am I right?<br/>
<br/>
Yes I know I&#39;m not unschooling at this stage of our journey and I don&#39;t<br/>
know for certain if I want to or not yet.  As I said I am still<br/>
learning, but I hope that by being a member of this group I will learn<br/>
enough to make an educated decision. So I am keen to hear about others<br/>
personal experiences rather than just reading general philosophies<br/>
online.<br/>
<br/>
So as I said bare with me, As I said, I&#39;m still learning.<br/>

I do no formal teaching at all.  My children have never been to  <br/>
school.  They are 22, 19 and 16.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Does she believe that?  Perhaps it&#39;s because she is neither  <br/>
&quot;disciplining&quot; nor teaching her children formally, and they have  <br/>
learned life skills, morals and values.   My children have.  I know  <br/>
fifty other families in which it&#39;s true, too.  I know ZERO other  <br/>
families whose children are as aware and together and whole and  <br/>
mature as the children in those unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know that this approach would not work for me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is a quote from the beginning of my deschooling page:<br/>
<br/>
*************************<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time a confident and experienced scholar went to the best  <br/>
Zen teacher he knew, to apply to be his student. The master offered  <br/>
tea, and he held out his cup. While the student recited his knowledge  <br/>
and cataloged his accomplishments to date, the master poured slowly.  <br/>
The bragging continued, and the pouring continued, until the student  <br/>
was getting a lapful of tea, and said, �My cup is full!� The master  <br/>
smiled and said, �Yes, it is. And until you empty yourself of what  <br/>
you think you know, you won�t be able to learn.�<br/>
<br/>
Weird Al says it a different way in �Everything You Know is Wrong,�  <br/>
and Christians say �You must surrender yourself.� Before that Jesus  <br/>
said, �Unless you become as a little child��<br/>
<br/>
What it means in homeschooling terms is that as long as you think you  <br/>
can control and add to what you already know, it will be hard to come  <br/>
to unschooling. The more quickly you empty your cup and open yourself  <br/>
to new ideas uncritically, the sooner you will see natural learning  <br/>
blossom.<br/>
<br/>
So much for philosophy and buildup. How can this be done? Can it work  <br/>
for former teachers? What about engineers who are sure their children  <br/>
need lots of math in an organized fashion? What about moms who love  <br/>
schedules and organization?<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling is needed much more by parents than by  <br/>
children.********************<br/>

Firstly thanks for this reply Pamela it is the type of reply I was<br/>
ho;ping for and is one that really helps me to gain understanding and to<br/>
learn without making me feel 2nd rate or ignorant LOL.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What type of writing are you concerned with? Are you worried about the<br/>

then I might be.<br/>
<br/>
Or are you thinking about their ability to  express themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Yes I think the ability to express themselves in writing is my biggest<br/>
concern at the moment<br/>
<br/>
For what purposes? Is it for making a shopping  list... No simple things<br/>
like lists are not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
or writing a letter to Grandma<br/>
<br/>
They will only do this if I make them and even then my boys wouldn&#39;t<br/>
manage more than a sentence or two and certainly wouldn&#39;t extend<br/>
themselves to make it interesting for her to read.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  or write a book report?<br/>
<br/>
If they initiated this for themselves I think I would fall over in shock<br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Are you  talking about young kids, but worried about their ability to<br/>
write an<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; essay for college?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This type of writing will be an issue later but before then there are<br/>
certain skills that they will need to learn. Naturally I realize these<br/>
skills will be learned gradually over the years and not in one foul<br/>
swoop. But If they don&#39;t initiate any writing on which to build upon<br/>
over time on their own wouldn&#39;t I then need to find ways to get them<br/>
writing myself?<br/>
<br/>
Really stop right now, before you continue reading  this response, and<br/>
think for yourself about writing - maybe stop and  write us a post in<br/>
which you describe the kinds of writing you think<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your children ought to be doing and how they&#39;d benefit and why it<br/>
&gt; seems important to you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like to write and feel it is the way in which I am most comfortable<br/>
expressing myself. In a practical sense it has benefited me 1000 times<br/>
over during my life and I believe it is an important skill to develop<br/>
and practice beyond the basics of letter and list writing. If they don&#39;t<br/>
give it a go they may never discover the joy of it and if the do give it<br/>
a shot they may well find a whole new world open up to them.  If later<br/>
down the track they decide to go to university i would like to think I<br/>
have kept as many doors open to them as possible and I believe being a<br/>
competant writer is one of those doors.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; We can&#39;t really answer the question as you asked it, because you<br/>

&gt; don&#39;t have that fear, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes that is one aspect of unschooling I just don&#39;t get at the moment. It<br/>
seems un-natural for a parent not to worry about the future on their<br/>
childrens behalf. This is not a criticizm  just where I am at right now.<br/>
<br/>
So I suggest that the question you ought  to be asking is,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For those whose kids don&#39;t write of their own  accord, why are you NOT<br/>
worried that your non-writing children are  not, in fact, writing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes thats what I meant lol<br/>
<br/>
Also,<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Do you find ways to get them to write?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes that too LOL<br/>

<br/>
Beyong the basic 4 functions and even prior to that mastering them.<br/>

<br/>
Because math was a subject at school I struggled with and never really<br/>
grasped as I had a poor foundation. This prevented me following a career<br/>
path I wanted later in life. It is also very important to my dh that the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905975791">-=-or write a book report?<br/>
<br/>
If they initiated this for themselves I think I would fall over in shock<br/>
LOL-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most adults who went to school don&#39;t have the faintest idea what a  <br/>
book report would actually be in the real world.  School book reports  <br/>
are not real writing.   The real writing is at Amazon.com, where  <br/>
people review books.  It&#39;s in magazines and newspapers, where books  <br/>
are reviewed too, but anyone can write a review at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is real writing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If any adult initiated a school-style book report on her own, I would  <br/>
think she was an idiot.  And the thing about unschooling is that it  <br/>
has to do with discovering what is real in the world and what is  <br/>
school.  Real people read books if they want to, for information or  <br/>
for pleasure.  Schoolkids read books because there are rewards and  <br/>
threats.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve treated my children like real people since they were born.  You  <br/>
might fall over in shock if you knew how wonderfully that is turning  <br/>
out.<br/>

Well Mine read because they want to and occasionally because I encourage<br/>

huge range of books from the Library and read aloud to them when asked<br/>
or occasionally whenever I find a good book that I think they&#39;ll enjoy.<br/>

I consider myself to treat my kids as real people but I probably go<br/>
about it a different way that you do at the moment. Just like me I see<br/>
that they have human weaknesses and just like me I see that they can<br/>
learn from the wisdom and guidance of others. Just like me they may<br/>
sometimes resist this wisdom and guidance at first but when they come<br/>
out the other end they are  usually glad they gave it a chance.<br/>

You probably would be happier buying a Christian curriculum.  You  <br/>
want to have an easy answer without any discussion or explanation.   <br/>
Your questions have all been asked from a position of inflexible  <br/>
belief and assumptions galore, and (I hope) without your meaning to,  <br/>
they are worded in such a way that you insult the people from whom  <br/>
you hope to get these free, easy answers.<br/>

If you don&#39;t have time to learn about unschooling you certainly don&#39;t  <br/>
have time to actually unschool your children.  Using a curriculum  <br/>
won&#39;t take all day and all night.  You can have days off.   <br/>
Unschooling is a commitment to living in such a way that learning  <br/>
happens all the time, every day, all year.<br/>

direction or at the very least guidance?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The tone sounds insulting, but I will answer it as though you meant  <br/>
no insult.<br/>
<br/>
 From the time my children were born I held them and nursed them,  <br/>
talked to them and sang to them, slept with them and played with  <br/>
them.  They have never been in daycare (Marty and Kirby, once, stayed  <br/>
at a mother&#39;s-day-out at a church near us for two hours while I went  <br/>
Christmas shopping, and Marty mentioned every time we passed that  <br/>
building for years--never in a good way).  They have never been to  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
If we have something scheduled, we go there.  If people are coming  <br/>
over, we stay home.  We check on each others&#39;s needs for help, food,  <br/>
clean clothes, rides, need to talk... this way of being has evolved  <br/>
over the 22  years I&#39;ve been a mom.  It evolved into unschooling  <br/>
pretty smoothly, and now is evolving out into their adult lives and  <br/>
relationship with me and their dad seamlessly.  There was not  <br/>
difference between their pre-school lives and their unschooling  <br/>
years, and no difference between their pre-18-year-old and 18, 19,  <br/>
21, 22 year old selves, except at some point they can&#39;t be on our  <br/>
insurance anymore.  Kirby, the oldest, has his own job and medical,  <br/>
dental, automotive insurance now.  He lives in another state, because  <br/>
a job transferred him there.  Before that he was living at home.<br/>
<br/>
They do whatever they like whenever they want to do it, but &quot;without  <br/>
my permission&quot; isn&#39;t an issue.  They let me know, and if there are  <br/>
any real objections, it wouldn&#39;t have to be me to state them--it  <br/>
could be their dad or a sibling or a friend.   They  make decisions  <br/>
about what to do with all the realities of their lives in mind.    <br/>
They have always had direction and a great deal of guidance.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s likely that my idea of direction isn&#39;t the same as yours.  My  <br/>
children live by principles and that makes direction a thing they  <br/>
have in them, not something other people do to them.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

feel promote values contrary to our families Christian beliefs. This<br/>
includes things such as books or games featuring witchcraft/wizardry,<br/>
horror, violence, or what I consider to be teen or adult concepts.<br/>
<br/>
Our approach to all areas of life is based upon our christian beliefs.<br/>
But that is us and I know not everyone shares our beliefs or approach to<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
My reason for asking this was that It would appear to me that if<br/>
children had total freedom of choice then religeous beliefs such as ours<br/>
couldn&#39;t come into it. Am I correct?<br/>
<br/>
Have I answered your questions satisfactorily?<br/>

wrong place to ask  my questions and hopefully learn from the<br/>

<br/>
I apologize to any and all whom I have upset and offended with my<br/>
apparently insulting questions. They were asked with the best of<br/>
intentions and were from a presumption that the statement below from the<br/>
groups page seemed to indicate that this was the purpose of this group.<br/>
<br/>
How and why does unschooling work? What kind of parents and parenting<br/>
does it take? What will help, and what will hinder?<br/>
<br/>
This is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling and<br/>
attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based on the<br/>
principles underlying unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Always Learning will focus on how people learn no matter where in the<br/>
world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or<br/>
jurisdiction.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I do apologize especially to Sandra who I fear I have<br/>
insulted without intending to.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra I will leave your group today seeing as my questions are<br/>
obviously not welcome.<br/>

a shot they may well find a whole new world open up to them.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I love to write, myself. I have 2 blogs with seemingly-endless entries. I  <br/>
kept a diary and journals from when I was a teen until I started blogging. I  <br/>
often think I have an affinity with the written word-it goes from my brain to my <br/>
 fingers without effort. I didn&#39;t gain this from someone making me write. My <br/>
joy  of writing would have been snuffed out if it was required of me-it was <br/>
something  I picked up and expanded and grew with the joy and time I put into it.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes, Wyl (9) wants to communicate with someone. At this point,  working <br/>
on it on his own (either typing or handwriting) is slow and difficult.  If he <br/>
does want to do something small, he wants help with spelling-I do so,  <br/>
gladly. (Incidentally, Storm [3 1/2] has picked this up and will often ask how  to <br/>
spell entire sentences while he is doodling, drawing and &quot;writing&quot;) If he  <br/>
wants to write a letter to someone, I will offer for him to dictate to me while  I <br/>
write for him. I type very fast, so I can keep up with his though process and <br/>
 it goes more quickly and thus smoother. If I made him do it himself, I&#39;m <br/>
certain  he would lose almost all interest in communicating by <br/>
written/typewritten word.  Very occasionally, he&#39;ll come to me and ask if I can write something <br/>
for him  (actually, today he asked me to help him finish writing a recipe he <br/>
had  started and it was getting long and tiring). The more I support his <br/>
interest in  communication in ways that I can, in ways that make it easy and <br/>
interesting, the  more he will continue with it. If I make it hard and boring, why <br/>
would he want  to continue?<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a philosophy of learning, not a homeschooling method.  <br/>
To unschool requires a paradigm shift for most people. For some, that  <br/>
paradigm shift feels wonderful - euphoric - and sometimes people seem  <br/>
to be able to slip into it very quickly. But, for most people, there  <br/>
is a significant amount of resistance and wrenching and thrashing  <br/>
about while hanging onto old underlying assumptions about children and  <br/>
growth and development and learning.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe it is possible to embrace unschooling principles  <br/>
unless you believe that human beings are born to learn. that learning  <br/>
is as natural as breathing, that learning happens ALL the time, that  <br/>
attempts to force learning have long-run detrimental effects on human  <br/>
development, and that the ideal role of a parent is to support  <br/>
learning through creating an experience-rich environment which brings  <br/>
the world to their children and their children to the world in ways  <br/>
that are very specifically tailored to each individual child&#39;s  <br/>
interests, life circumstances, personality, competencies, and  <br/>
aptitudes. Unschooling parents do not try to make a child learn - but  <br/>
they do make it possible for the children to do what comes naturally -  <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
It takes most people significant personal work to come to understand  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t appealing to everyone, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
It takes an openness to being unconventional and a certain amount of  <br/>
courage (or, sometimes, desperation) to be willing to even accept the  <br/>
possibility that parents do not have to remain &quot;in control&quot; of their  <br/>
children, that we can transcend the usual control-based parent/child  <br/>
relationship and move toward one that more closely resembles an  <br/>
intricate dance in which it can be difficult to tell which partner is  <br/>
doing the &quot;leading&quot; because they are so finally attuned to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Nina. Don&#39;t post anymore here for a while. You&#39;ll be better off to get  <br/>
more of a taste of unschooling, first. Read at &lt;SandraDodd.com&gt; where  <br/>
you will find the writing of many people on many topics. Have a blast  <br/>
reading there - let yourself go from one thing to another, following  <br/>
links to whatever catches your fancy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496885254">This was sent on the side.  I should say that I had already  <br/>
corresponded on the side with the poster, making other  <br/>
recommendations.   I wasn&#39;t crazy about being insulted here, and I&#39;m  <br/>
less crazy about being insulted in private.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Well thanks anyway as you are aware I have now left the group.<br/>
<br/>
I was made to feel very unwelcome and misunderstood soley by you. I  <br/>
sincerely hope that is not the way you welcome guests to your home.<br/>
<br/>
Some members were very kind and gracious in the way they responded to  <br/>
my posts and I really did appreciate their input. Others like  <br/>
yourself made me feel like I was intruding on some silly high school  <br/>
clique where if I didn&#39;t dress the same or speak the same or like the  <br/>
same music as everyone else I would be made to feel like a reject.  <br/>
For that I really have to thank you, because I had been going through  <br/>
some difficult times with my kids figuring out how best to juggle a  <br/>
new baby and 3 older kids, which is what lead me to investigate  <br/>
unschooling again. You managed to remind me exactly why I choose to  <br/>
homeschool and why ps will never be an option for us. You also  <br/>
affirmed to me, that I am doing an ok job training and TEACHING my  <br/>
children to treat others with grace, kindness and respect and to make  <br/>
allowances for their uniqueness.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to see that grace, acceptance and understanding is alive  <br/>
and well in homeschooling circles too.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you well on your journey through life.<br/>

===========================================================<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;thanks&quot; was because I had added  her e-mail address in blind  <br/>
copy to the links to Christian unschooling sites.  It&#39;s pretty common  <br/>
for people to say &quot;Okay, FINE, then I&#39;m LEAVING&quot; and not leave right  <br/>
away (if ever).  I don&#39;t have my yahoogroups notifications set to  <br/>
tell me when people join or leave the list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was made to feel very unwelcome and misunderstood soley by you.  <br/>
I sincerely hope that is not the way you welcome guests to your home.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Twice I&#39;ve had guests in my home be as rude and tacky as those e- <br/>
mails were.  Both times, the tacky human was male, and was there with  <br/>
someone else (so not directly a guest).  When I have guests, I make  <br/>
them beds, put kleenex and water and a light near the bed, and make  <br/>
them food.  When someone comes to a discussion list and doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
to discuss and states she&#39;s not going to read the links but wants to  <br/>
be spoonfed on the list to her satisfaction, I don&#39;t feel she&#39;s a  <br/>
guest at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You also affirmed to me, that I am doing an ok job training and  <br/>
TEACHING my children to treat others with grace, kindness and respect  <br/>
and to make allowances for their uniqueness. -=-<br/>
<br/>
EEEK!  Bear with me while I wonder how she&#39;s going to teach grace and  <br/>
respect....  Nah.  Never mind.  My kids are happy and healthy and fine.<br/>

offensive ones, since I like being counted with Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
BTW still more muddled thinking - notice how the offence was &quot;soley&quot; by <br/>
Sandra... but then also by &quot;other&quot; members? I LOVE that she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
time to spend reading on the computer, but apparently believes we have time <br/>
to rewrite it all just for her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still vaguely disappointed that the whole thing wasn&#39;t an invitation to <br/>
&quot;bare&quot; with her at a nice nudist beach....<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, she is having a hard time &quot;juggling&quot; all her kids <br/>
*because* she is trying to school them, and I think it sounds exhausting. <br/>
Fear is exhausting.<br/>
Constantly removing options is exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, perhaps she will sneak back and read some in her precious few <br/>
moments.<br/>

That is awesome, it should go on your quote generator, Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who recently has been asking a lot of favors of me.  I have <br/>
her kids a lot, and though her kids go to public school our parenting <br/>
philosophy is similar and our kids are good friends.  I usually do things <br/>
for her happily, but it has been getting to be too much lately.  She made a <br/>
comment recently that blew me away, something along the lines of *you are <br/>
not doing anything anyway.*  What???<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to gently give her the message that though I love unschooling <br/>
and don&#39;t think of it as work, it does take a lot of effort on my part.  <br/>
Your quote sums it up perfectly.<br/>

Thanks, Katy.  It&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who did that with me, when my kids were young.  I  <br/>
would keep her kids all day sometimes, and she would give me $10  or  <br/>
$15, which was not quite enough to get McDonalds meals for her kids  <br/>
and mine, and her kids were only used to fast-food lunches.   The  <br/>
kids were having fun together so I didn&#39;t make a deal of it.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not easy, but I just thought of it as something I was doing for my  <br/>
kids, and not for her, which made it more bearable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690977387">Unschooling is mainly a concept that must be understood ==not as Christian<br/>
or non== as it&#39;s a philosophy that embraces the child&#39;s developmental<br/>
methods, the ways they learn the easiest, the most naturally.  It is not<br/>
about *content* per se.  It *is* about trusting children, who of all people<br/>
*can* be trusted... and that is biblical.  The view of unschooling is not<br/>
how many Christians think of children because the Christian culture and<br/>
indeed many cultures look upon children with undue and extreme suspicion.<br/>
Unschooling points out the idea that we don&#39;t want to approach our<br/>
relationships with children in such a way that it guarantees a messed up<br/>
one.  We can discourage children with our cynical view of the world and put<br/>
that view on them as though children are involved in dreaming it up.  There<br/>
is a lot that we could be negative about ... but that&#39;s a choice we&#39;re<br/>
making, a view that we&#39;re adhering to.  Whatsoever things are of good<br/>
report. That&#39;s a way of life in unschooling.. seeing the good, not focusing<br/>
on the bad, since a focus on the bad puts an odd flavor of value on the very<br/>
thing we don&#39;t want and gives it unwarranted power.<br/>
