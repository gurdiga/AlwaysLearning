&lt;&lt; Her responses were all about how &quot;they let us do this&quot; and <br/>
&quot;they let us do that.&quot; It was disconcerting -- my conversations with <br/>
unschooled kids do NOT include that &quot;they let us&quot; kind of stuff at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s interesting.  I first saw it not in school vs. unschool, but in <br/>
pregnant women and nursing mothers.   When I was involved with Cesarean <br/>
Prevention and then with LLL (I wasn&#39;t a leader, but &quot;lived there&quot; for <br/>
years), moms would say &quot;My doctor says I can go swimming&quot; or &quot;I have to take <br/>
the baby in, but I don&#39;t want to&quot; or &quot;If I&#39;m not in labor by the 15th, <br/>
they&#39;ve decided to induce.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Every time, I would say &quot;It&#39;s not their baby,&quot; or &quot;What do YOU want to do?&quot;  <br/>
and very often I would get the blankest-cow-in-headlights look.  Many women <br/>
are twice or three times or 180 degrees from believing that they have the <br/>
power to say no to a doctor, or even to a book making a recommendation about <br/>
letting a baby cry.<br/>
<br/>
Once a mom is aware of her ownership of her own learning and decision making <br/>
about BEING a mother and caring for her children, it&#39;s a big headstart on <br/>
natural family, natural learning, natural thinking.<br/>

 It took me almost three years after my first child was born to realize I <br/>
didn&#39;t have to or even need to ask the pedatrition permission to do or not do <br/>
things.  Boy...I&#39;ve come a long way from those days :)<br/>

The first time I remember making my own decision about my baby was when it was time for shots. I never had thought twice about whether or not my baby would get vaccinated until they poked my own sweet innocent baby. He started crying and I just realized something about this was wrong. I had a very strong gut feeling that my baby was being harmed. From that point on I read and learned all I could about why people choose not to immunize and I felt so relieved that I wasn&#39;t the only one who felt this way. So I decided against it for my kids, and in a way, that decision was the first of many that have led me here. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315212630">A similar thing happened with Dana and her shots.  Fortunately, we had<br/>
chosen a ped that allowed me to make choices for my child &lt;g&gt;.  Now whenever<br/>
anything is needed with Dana it isn&#39;t do this or that, it is just<br/>
different(although one of the other docs in the practice is a &quot;my way or the<br/>
highway person&quot; and we don&#39;t see him but once every year.<br/>
<br/>
When I found my breast lump, I was glad that I knew enough about myself to<br/>
make decisions.  I knew that thing in me could have been bad, and I wanted<br/>
it gone.  Thankfully, my HMO physician felt the same way and we got my<br/>
studies done quickly and when the studies showed wait and see, he and I did<br/>
not feel comfortable with that.  He helped me to find a female surgeon who<br/>
specialized in the breast and we got the lump out.  No, wait and repeat as<br/>
the mammogram/radiology suggested - no &quot;no lump found&quot; as the ultrasound<br/>
reported.  I saw my surgeon, she saw the lump on the ultrasound - she found<br/>
it on palpation right away - she asked ME what I wanted to do.  I said I<br/>
wanted it gone, it didn&#39;t need to be there and I didn&#39;t want to make friends<br/>
with it and watch its growth pattern for the next x months.  So, its gone,<br/>
I&#39;m fine and went back to work when I felt ready.  No more watch and see,<br/>
just do monthly self exams and mammo when 38.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say any of this is related to unschooling as I have been very aware<br/>
of my body since I can remember.  I guess I have been fortunate enough to<br/>
choose physicians that assist me/my family in my/our resources to be well.<br/>
