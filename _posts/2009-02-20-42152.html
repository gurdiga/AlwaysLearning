<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311415674">-=-Making and taking time for discussion probably *is* catch 22 for many<br/>
readers though.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of discussion...<br/>
<br/>
The yahoo site tools I need to update my pages are down (or were  <br/>
before I made dinner, and I&#39;ll check again in a while).<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t update the page about tomorrow&#39;s chat, but tomorrow, afternoon  <br/>
in the U.S. (noon in California and 3:00 on the East Coast) there will  <br/>
be a chat at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/room">http://sandradodd.com/room</a><br/>
and the password is goodidea<br/>
<br/>
The topic is moving from school to unschooling!<br/>
