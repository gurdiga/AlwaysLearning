<br/>
I am Tami and my mate is Michael too :)<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Tami<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that is<br/>
more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>

<br/>
Two best suggestions I have are:  find a kid to come and play.  Doesn&#39;t need <br/>
to be 8 or a girl.  An older kid might be better.  Pay money if you need to, <br/>
but get someone to play with her.   AND.... make yourself play.  Whether you <br/>
love to or not, it&#39;s part of the job of an unschooling mom.  <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to act out Barbie, don&#39;t.  But find something you ARE <br/>
willing to do, whether it&#39;s hike and pretend with her that you&#39;re lost in the <br/>
mountains, or go to an amusement park and ride rides or tie a rope to something <br/>
outside and turn the other end so she can jump.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll learn by playing, and unschooling is going to need that.  <br/>
<br/>
When my third was an infant, I hired an older neighbor (she was 12) to come <br/>
and play with my boys, get them drinks, help them with things that were hard, <br/>
so I could sleep or nurse the baby with less frustration for me and the boys <br/>
too.  I paid her $2 an hour at first, and later $3.   When she was older, I&#39;d <br/>
pay her $4 rounded up for babysitting if I was not at the house.   The kids knew <br/>
her longterm and it was a relief for her to get away from her own house.  She <br/>
was a homeschooler too, and lived three houses up.<br/>
<br/>
That was easier than yours might be to find, but it&#39;s worth looking!<br/>

I&#39;ll confess that I hate games.  I blame it on bad experiences with my older <br/>
brother.  He always won and rubbed it in, and as we got older and I could beat <br/>
him, he then took to cheating.  He beat me up once because I won at Monopoly, <br/>
when we were teenagers.  I was an 20-something before I played another game, <br/>
and not with him!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a shame, because there is so much learning to be had from games.  <br/>
I do make myself play, but not near as much as Will would like.  I like it <br/>
more now that he&#39;s older and can beat me fair and square.  But, Charles plays <br/>
games with him more than I do, because he likes to play games.  I just have a <br/>
bad taste in my mouth that I&#39;ve never been able to get rid of...well, it&#39;s more <br/>
like a knot in my stomach, even though I can rationalize that Will is not my <br/>
brother and he&#39;s a good sport and all.  Another feeling I hate is getting all <br/>
worked up wanting to win, and then the disappointment when I lose.  I imagine I <br/>
felt that a lot as a child, but I&#39;ve blocked most of that out.  I recognize <br/>
it when I start to feel it, though, and then I just don&#39;t play.  Ah!  I just <br/>
realize it&#39;s the &quot;NO FAIR!&quot; feeling that I don&#39;t like.  Courtesy of my brother.  <br/>
:P  Thanks for nuttin&#39;, Steve.<br/>
<br/>
But I do try to be playful with my boy.  We play in the pool.  We play in the <br/>
car.  I let him use my desk as an aircraft carrier.  I just don&#39;t like <br/>
&quot;games&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303924214">The quotes got lost on that last post, so I&#39;m resending it slightly notated.  <br/>
First Tuck quoted me, and then she made good comments, which seemed like part <br/>
of the same paragraph at first.  <br/>
