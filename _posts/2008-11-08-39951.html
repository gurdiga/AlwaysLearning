shorter statement and comment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And the benefit is that when we&#39;ve put in years of respecting their<br/>
needs, when we&#39;re trying to get the laundry done and the beds made<br/>
before company comes we can say &quot;Hey, I could use some help here,&quot;<br/>
and the kids will say &quot;Sure!&quot; When we don&#39;t impose on their time<br/>
because of some false sense of them owing us, when we&#39;ve been<br/>
generous with our help meeting the needs *they* feel are important<br/>
(eg, making healthy meals for them isn&#39;t their need but our desire to<br/>
cook in a certain way), then they&#39;ll be generous with their time. We<br/>
will *be* someone they want to help.-=-<br/>

&quot;[W]hen we&#39;ve put in years of respecting their<br/>
needs... then they&#39;ll be generous with their time. We<br/>
will *be* someone they want to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t like sending  a child to school and then helping  <br/>
with his homework.  It requires the creation of an unschooling  <br/>
environment, coordinated by someone who really  understands  <br/>
unschooling.  That&#39;s probably going to be one parent at first, and  <br/>
maybe two eventually if there are two.  Someone who doesn&#39;t believe  <br/>
in unschooling can&#39;t do it.  Someone who doesn&#39;t know how to unschool  <br/>
can&#39;t do it.  Someone who isn&#39;t willing to change can&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
They can say they&#39;re doing it and go through some of the motions, but  <br/>
then they&#39;ll be writing about school and deciding unschooling wasn&#39;t  <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
To have children thrive in an unschooling home, the home must be made  <br/>
into an unschooling home.<br/>
<br/>
To have children spontaneously show affection and respect for their  <br/>
wonderful, mindful parents, the parents have to first become  <br/>
wonderfully mindful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not as hard as it sounds for those who want to do it, but it&#39;s  <br/>
absolutely impossible for those who don&#39;t want to!<br/>
<br/>
So no one &quot;has to&quot; change, but people also don&#39;t have to unschool.   <br/>
There are schools galore and all manner of online and in-a-box  <br/>
curriculum packages.<br/>
