<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923125493">One of our regular family stories (which was quoted today, in regards to this current list problem) is Kirby, when he was five or six, asking me &quot;Mom, why is Kyla older than Dane?&quot;<br/>
As I took a breath to answer, he said, &quot;And don&#39;t say it&#39;s because she was born first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Ther e was no other answer, but having been instructed what answer was unacceptable, I just laughed.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, Kyla WAS born first, through no fault or virtue on the part of anyone involved.  It was just a simple truth.<br/>
<br/>
So when someone puts any advance limitations on an answer they want, the shorthand here is &quot;...and don&#39;t say it&#39;s because she was born first.&quot;  <br/>
