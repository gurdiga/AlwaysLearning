 <br/>
I&#39;m finding some things about silent reading by reading this, but here&#39;s  <br/>
something interesting about reading aloud 1800 years ago:<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Punctuation, traditionally ascribed to Aristophanes of  Byzantium (circa <br/>
200 BC) and developed by other scholars of the Library of  Alexandria, was at <br/>
best erratic. Augustine, like Cicero before him, would have  had to practice a <br/>
text before reading it out loud, since sight-reading was in  his day an <br/>
unusual skill and often led to errors of interpretation. The fourth-  century <br/>
grammarian Servius criticized his colleague Donat for reading, in  Virgil&#39;s Aeneid, <br/>
the words collectam ex llio pubem (&quot;a people gathered from  troy&quot;) instead of <br/>
collectam exilio pubem (&quot;a people gathered for exile&quot;). Such  mistakes were <br/>
common when reading a continuous text.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Because of punctuation, modern English is pretty easy to read  aloud without <br/>
a whole lot of preparation.  It wouldn&#39;t be cool to read cold  for radio or <br/>
recordings, but it can happen that people can read a whole lot of  cold text <br/>
without making a mistake, thanks to commas, quotation marks and  periods.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a different skill, though, than &quot;reading for meaning,&quot;  silently to <br/>
oneself.  <br/>
 <br/>
Still looking for clues...<br/>
