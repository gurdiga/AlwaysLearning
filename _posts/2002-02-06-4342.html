<div id="ygrps-yiv-658307600">The &quot;stuff&quot; ended up to be mostly pH indicators and showing how iron<br/>
precipitates on a nail (yawn). *I* wouldn&#39;t have bought it, but it was<br/>
well-intended because it was &quot;educational.&quot; Purple cabbage water is a lot<br/>
more fun and very attractive as well; we ran around finding everything we<br/>
could in the house to mix with it and had every glass bowl I own filled up.<br/>
We&#39;ve done baking soda and vinegar many times, mainly because ds likes it,<br/>
plus the inevitable volcano. When the can of bug spray exploded in our<br/>
garage a few summers ago and punched a hole through the ceiling, we got to<br/>
talk about pressure and reactions (we didn&#39;t repeat the experiment, much to<br/>
his dismay.) And when I make a caramel pie out of Eagle Brand (BTW, that&#39;s<br/>
the entire recipe, so it&#39;s a bit rich &lt;g&gt;) I found that you can get the same<br/>
result from boiling a can for 3 hours as you do from letting it sit on the<br/>
shelf for three years. Neat, huh! And &#39;fessing up: I shouldn&#39;t have called<br/>
myself a chemistry survivor; I was actually a chemistry nerd. Want to know<br/>
what happens when you put a quarter at the bottom of a beaker of silver<br/>
nitrate? &lt;veg&gt;<br/>

&gt; Christmas and I thought, cool, because it says<br/>
&gt; Smithsonian, right? Wrong. The instructions weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; clear, the experiments didn&#39;t work, and nothing<br/>
&gt; smoked<br/>
&gt; or blew up, which really disappointed ds.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>...................................................&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;WHY didn&#39;t the stuff work?  There is chemistry<br/>
everywhere.  Hey!  You could blow up eggs in the<br/>
microwave! I once blew up some in a regular pot on the<br/>
stove top.  Left them to hardboil and forgot.  When I<br/>
came home, the pot was welded to the burner and the<br/>
eggs were eveywhere.  On the textured ceiling, behind<br/>
the refrigerator, underneath the uphigh cupboards, one<br/>
all of the exterior surfaces of everything.  Wish I<br/>
had observed this!<br/>
<br/>
There is the baking soda and vinigar comination, that<br/>
goes a long way for &quot;food for thought&quot;.  Actually all<br/>
cooking is chemistry.  Dyes and mordants are<br/>
chemistry.<br/>
Medicine is chemistry.  Compost and fertilizer is<br/>
chemistry, the weather is chemistry.....you really<br/>
can&#39;t avoid chemistry.  It is sort of like art and<br/>
craft materials.  Everywhere.<br/>

Robyn Coburn has posted links before to a place with good scientific equipment. You could wait for her to post it again or you could probably search the archives and find it. In the UK I can&#39;t get a chemisty set with much more than what I have in the kitchen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bill Nye the sciene guy is great.<br/>
we did brainpop and the kids loved it for a few days.  i objected that the subscription you had to commit to a year.  i thought it was great though.  we also tried the discovery channel site video thing but nobody was very impressed. <br/>
i buy the kids some of those little experiment kits from target sometimes.  they range from 10 on sale to 20.  the one target had about chemistry is basic but they liked it.<br/>
we also have a few basic experiment books that they like to go through ad pickout experiments occasionally.  just kitchen science kinds of things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-419106595">Haven&#39;t read the responses so pardon any repeats.<br/>
<br/>
Try youtube.  There&#39;s lots of how-to&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
Also maybe How Stuff Works (a book) by David MacCauley could have good<br/>
starting points?  Not sure as I haven&#39;t looked at it myself but I&#39;ve seen it<br/>
highly recommended on unschooling lists and I&#39;ve wondered.  Anybody know?.<br/>
<br/>
Krampf Experiments online newsletters are weekly, though not chemicals you<br/>
would find in a lab... the kitchen variety experimentation playing with<br/>
cause and effect.<br/>
<br/>
Karl is 5 and he enjoys BrianPopJr though it is a very limited set piece<br/>
that doesn&#39;t get very deep.  It leaves a lot of unanswered questions without<br/>
making it clear that it&#39;s doing so.  It&#39;s just a jumping off point.  Since I<br/>
have made sure to suggest that there might be more to it than what they say,<br/>
he seems fine with it.  I don&#39;t always agree with the facts presented and<br/>
since I mention that, Karl is beginning to take it as one opinion among<br/>
others.  He went around the room and tried magnets on various items as<br/>
suggested and had me to write down the results because he wanted to try out<br/>
the scientific method.  A simple concept... which he&#39;s done with for now.<br/>
So if an 8 year old wants to learn more about chemical reactions I would say<br/>
BrainPop is fine for a few ideas (they change their videos from time to<br/>
time).  Nothing wrong with it.  Just add more to it.  There&#39;s lots out there<br/>
for free as well.<br/>

<br/>
I had a cool chemistry set as a kid that I used to make lots of<br/>
foul-smelling and fun stuff.  I researched for a few hours before choosing<br/>
this one.  I haven&#39;t opened it yet.  Still in the box and waiting for me or<br/>
my son to get interested in it.  Future strewing.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my son is 4, I went ahead and bought it because so many formerly<br/>
easy-to-get chemicals are now restricted by state or federal laws because<br/>
they&#39;re used in the manufacture of different street drugs.  Lye, for<br/>
example.  A friend of ours in Missouri was bemoaning the fact last year that<br/>
she&#39;s had to change her soap recipe due to the unavailability of lye.  So I<br/>
thought I&#39;d buy a cool chemistry set before they&#39;re completely off the<br/>
market.  It has all the basics, and then I&#39;ll get creative and fill in the<br/>
gaps.  -=b.</div>
