Also, we are financially not doing well at all now. My husband is looking for a new (better paying) job that isn&#39;t the same hours as mine, but meanwhile, does anyone here have experience with jobs at home? I see advertisements, of course, but don&#39;t want a scam. DH or I are looking to supplement income in a way that keeps at least one of us home most of the time, so we can keep unschooling. <br/>

Anyone with cool ideas or experiences, I&#39;d love any info. Thanks. <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re welcome :-)<br/>
<br/>
It might also be helpful to think outside the box when it comes to classes, workshops or clubs. For example, you may be able to help out in the class in someway instead of making a financial payment.<br/>
<br/>
When my children were younger, I made alternative arrangements with a couple of different facilitators. For a weekly crafts workshop, the facilitator was happy with me coming early to help her set up the craft tables, make tea and chat, while my children played. After the class was finished, I&#39;d help with clean up, wrapping children&#39;s crafts up to take home and chat more with the facilitator. She was happy with the company and the extra assistance. I was happy that we could do the classes for free. <br/>
<br/>
At other times I&#39;ve offered to make a brochure or a website or help advertise different activities for people. A website is very easy to design with something like wordpress and it is free. We&#39;ve got software that makes designing brochures a breeze.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t done any of this professionally. I suppose I could. But for now, it&#39;s just one of the ways I help our children have more options with our family&#39;s limited financial funds. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554546802">Hi Kris: I did lots of different things to make money from home when my<br/>
children were younger - we had planned for me to go back to work full-time<br/>
when the children were school age, and then surprisingly, we decided to<br/>
keep them home. :-) So we had a bigger house than we could comfortably<br/>
afford on one income, but didn&#39;t want to move.<br/>
<br/>
I baked and then sold Irish soda bread and gingerbread at local craft<br/>
fairs, I worked as a freelance writer for the local newspaper, for a couple<br/>
of summers I ran short &quot;art days&quot; at my house, and had a small number of<br/>
children over to do things like painting or felting. I helped two different<br/>
older people in my community settle estates, which led to me learning how<br/>
to sell items on ebay, and I did that for many years. I know about managing<br/>
rental property, so I&#39;ve helped people get property ready for rental, set<br/>
up leases and screened tenants for them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes these activities were not completely run out of my house, but I<br/>
could bring my children with me and set my own schedule.<br/>
<br/>
What I always did first, before deciding I needed to add to our income, is<br/>
figure out if there were things we could do without. There are almost<br/>
always ways to cut costs - for many years we bought almost all of our<br/>
clothes second-hand, we rarely ate out, we didn&#39;t have cable, we didn&#39;t<br/>
travel, we postponed work on our house.<br/>
<br/>
We used the library (books, music, DVDs, museum passes, free programs),<br/>
attended a UU church that had activities for children, visited parks,<br/>
joined 4H and kept two rabbits, we had two wonderful cats that really<br/>
enriched the girl&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
To help offset costs for paid activities I sometimes acted as the<br/>
instructor&#39;s assistant and then my child participated for free (this worked<br/>
for a few NH Audubon programs) or asked if I could set up a payment plan.<br/>
For five summers both girls participated in a Shakespeare theater program -<br/>
I helped with publicity and ran front-of-house in exchange for tuition<br/>
forgiveness.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s looking at your situation with different eyes and seeing the<br/>
possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270983092">It&#39;s not very glamorous but there is good money in cleaning houses & the hours are flexible.  You could try to get a couple of jobs that you clean regularly and have a little income coming in.  I have a friend that does this and it has worked out great for her.  Once in awhile the home owners will have other projects they will hire her to work on, too.  Or maybe you could do yard work for someone on a weekly or biweekly basis.  Taking care of perennial beds, that type of thing.  <br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977962998">Thanks, more good ideas. Appreciate the ideas, everyone. My husband would be great at the housecleaning gig, if there is anyone needing that around here. My son is actually doing yard work for some folks, but when I recoup from knee surgery, I love working on perennial beds. Maybe he and I should start a business. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469024921">Thanks, this looks really intriguing for both my husband and I. Perhaps even our older kids. I haven&#39;t signed up yet, so not sure how it all works, but neat idea.<br/>
