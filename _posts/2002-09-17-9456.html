<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882975294">&lt;I would try to do an aikido maneuver so that her<br/>
desire to see school-style learning could be turned to<br/>
your advantage (and hers) during the visit.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra,  <br/>
YES!  She even had asked in a previous conversation<br/>
about what to buy for my son&#39;s birthday.  She wanted<br/>
to get one of those math electronic do-dad that tests<br/>
your addition.  Do you know what I mean?  I wasn&#39;t<br/>
sure I wanted that, but we&#39;ve never actually tried<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
And I confess, I don&#39;t know what some of these things<br/>
are:<br/>
&lt;Some attribute blocks? &gt;<br/>
&lt;A geoboard and some colored rubber bands.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And if any of you have other things your kids<br/>
especially liked, please share.  My kids are 4 & 6.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

interested...  who knows, they could get lucky!<br/>
<br/>
The Zoombini&#39;s (a computer program) are fun (and are obviously mathematical <br/>
in nature) and would probably work for at least the 6 year old.  I know <br/>
they still work for 35 year olds...  ahem.<br/>

middle of our patterns.<br/>
