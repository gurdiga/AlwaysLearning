<br/>
All day yesterday I kept thinking &quot;Friday is someone&#39;s anniversary,&quot;  <br/>
and I knew it was someone&#39;s something....<br/>
<br/>
Well I came back across Schuyler&#39;s blog and she turned 40 today.   <br/>
It&#39;s not her birthday in England anymore, but it&#39;s still her birthday  <br/>
in New Mexico!   Happy Birthday.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t birthday everybody on the list, but I&#39;ll tell you what:   <br/>
Schuyler has really made things easier for a lot of unschoolers in  <br/>
ways they don&#39;t even realize, by being a huge help on this list and  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion, as a moderator and advisor and peacemaker.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for that, Schuyler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047730720">Schuyler, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve never written to you before, so you probably<br/>
don&#39;t know me at all, but I make a point of reading your cheerful, gentle,<br/>
sensible, forthright, hope-inducing, creative, accepting, delightful posts<br/>
here and on Peacefulpartnerships.  I&#39;m glad to hear you are so young, so<br/>
that we&#39;ll have many more years to enjoy you.  Very happy birthday to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838944453">Gawrsh, as Goofy would say. What a wonderful thing to wake up to. That and coffee in the Linnaea Borealis mug my mom gave me. <br/>
<br/>
I had a really brilliant yesterday, I couldn&#39;t have asked to say good-by to the 30&#39;s in a better way. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

according to Douglas Adams :) it&#39;s kinda like standing on a summit and<br/>
having a pretty dang good view! Knowing that while there&#39;s still climbing<br/>
and exploring to be done, you&#39;ve come a long way (it ain&#39;t Nebraska no<br/>
more!) and it&#39;s all been a Schuyler-worthy experience :)<br/>
