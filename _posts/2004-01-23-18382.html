<div id="ygrps-yiv-281638143">&quot;I&#39;ve seen Chocolat and What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same here.<br/>
I loved Chocolat a ton also...watched it twice so far and plan to buy it. I also really liked Edward Scissorhands, though not as much as Sierra who watched it something like four times before I had to return it to Blockbuster!<br/>
It&#39;s quirky and has a bit of an offbeat dark side to it....my kinda movie. I totally enjoy Tim Burton&#39;s style though, that quirky, artsy stuff is great.<br/>
Anyhoo...now I have two more Depp movies to check out..thanks.<br/>
<br/>
And for those that don&#39;t mind a bit of blood and creepiness, the movie &quot;From Hell&quot; is another Depp film that is very well made. It&#39;s about Jack the Ripper and one of the theories surrounding those murders. I liked the ending a whole lot better than the real life account (Mary Kelly was the last of the Rippers victims).<br/>
So if you don&#39;t mind a thriller that has some gross scenes, I highly recommend it. Depp plays a character so vastly different from Jack Sparrow (that&#39;s Captain Jack Sparrow actually:) it&#39;s a great way to see the range of his talent.<br/>
<br/>
As to Viggo...I could have some REALLY hot dreams about that man. He is SO completely sexy. wow.<br/>
