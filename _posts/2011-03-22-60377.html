<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800202487">This came by e-mail.  It&#39;s part of a long, longer post by someone who said she had only read about 20% of the topic, and isn&#39;t an unschooler, and just joined the list.<br/>

_______________________<br/>
<br/>
Your statement (and please, if I am wrong and these aren&#39;t your words...) in one of the threads, pasted below, simply doesn&#39;t sit well however, regardless of what the original poster says, does, or otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
Your statement: <br/>
<br/>
That sentence has a lot of negative words. I&#39;m going to pick through that, and because you posted it on a list I own, you&#39;re going to let me do that without saying it&#39;s ridiculous, okay?<br/>
<br/>
1) do not<br/>
2) irresponsible<br/>
3) unattended<br/>
4) not a good thing<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all in one sentence.<br/>
<br/>
You could say That making sure he is attended would be a good thing. How could the first part be turned around to be more positive?<br/>

<br/>
Informing this woman of what she will do is first and foremost, disrespectful.  Whether you agree with her, feel she is being argumentative, feel she is hopeless, or otherwise, telling her what you will have her do in any context is outright disrespect.  As the owner of this list, you are not the controller. <br/>
_____________________________<br/>
<br/>
How is it I am not the controller of the list, first of all?  I created it.  I have the ability to block posts, remove members, and delete the entire list if I get tired of it.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t control what people post, but I do request that people read about the list before posting, and cooperate with the purpose and intent of the list, partly for the benefit of casual readers, and partly out of regard for the huge amount of time the regular posters and the several moderators put into reading all the posts and responding thoughtfully from their years of experience with unschooling.    <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t address (again) having been told something I had written was &quot;ridiculous.&quot;  I only mentioned it in passing, as quoted above.  I have in the past objected strongly to the word &quot;ridiculous,&quot; when aimed toward someone or something someone wrote on this list.  It&#39;s WAY too strong a word to use about other people&#39;s freely offered advice.<br/>
<br/>
I brought it up because of this statement (which was probably in the 80% my critic didn&#39;t read):  &quot; I have gotten some great advice and believe me I do not love my animals more then my children...how ridiculous really! &quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/60355">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/60355</a><br/>

<br/>
While looking for my past objections of &quot;ridiculous&quot; to create the third link above, I found this, which seems to apply to the topic that got so many people riled up (though maybe &quot;understanding the situation&quot; instead of unschooling, in this new case).  It&#39;s from a whole different discussion, in 2007.<br/>
______________________<br/>
<br/>
If you can read more than you write, and if you can REALLY read and<br/>
try to apply the suggestions instead of batting them away, you will<br/>
move quickly toward the possibility of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
No one is trying to thwart you. LOTS of people are trying to help<br/>
you. Quit flailing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to know why a) a person who isn&#39;t an unschooler joined this  <br/>
list b) reads only 20% of something and makes a summary judgement  <br/>
about the owner of said list and c) feels qualified to make such a  <br/>
judgement?<br/>
<br/>
Why oh why do people do this?<br/>
<br/>
Why is respectful to join a list, comment without bothering to read  <br/>
what&#39;s being discussed in total, and not be an unschooler, to boot?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s disrespectful not to think through the appropriateness of such a  <br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
Despite what some people might say, not everyone&#39;s opinion is worthy  <br/>
of respect. If a person has no idea what they&#39;re talking about and  <br/>
another person does, who should I be listening to?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s completely clear to me.<br/>
