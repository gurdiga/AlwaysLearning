One problem with thinking in terms of a balance between your freedom and other peoples&#39; is that there&#39;s an inherent conflict - more freedom for someone else means less freedom for you, which sets the stage for resentment and antagonism, even if it&#39;s not overt or conscious. <br/>
<br/>
Thinking in terms of choice means that every action is weighed against other possible actions and you choose the better or more positive choice. You get to make a positive move every time.<br/>

Facebook is like hanging around the bowling alley when it&#39;s really crowded, compared to this discussion.  I thought this really good point should have a higher class of audience.   (Even though some of you are in both places... you know what I mean, I guess.)<br/>

Another thing that I think makes it hard to talk about �freedom� is that<br/>
the word is overloaded--it has a lot of different meanings. It&#39;s<br/>
practically impossible to know what a person means by �freedom� without a<br/>
great deal of discussion on that point alone. Also, some people experience<br/>
requests for clarification as attacks, and employ all the classic defense<br/>
mechanisms, especially dismissal (�that&#39;s just<br/>
[semantics|nitpicking|pedantery|your opinion|my opinion]�).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a logical fallacy, it probably has a name, where you argue as<br/>
though the person who claims to disagree with you secretly agrees with you<br/>
but is arguing for some other reason, frequently identified as �just to<br/>
make me mad�. This fallacy manifests itself in these kinds of discussions<br/>
by people behaving as though everyone �should� know what they mean when<br/>
they use a vague, unwieldy, overloaded word like &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;education&quot;<br/>
or &quot;rights&quot;.<br/>
