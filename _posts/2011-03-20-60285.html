<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252731740">Hello. I am a new member and I imagine that learning to read is discussed often, so I hope this is not too redundant.<br/>
My son has been plugging away at puzzling out the alphabet and the basic letter sounds. He has spent a lot of time on starfall.com (at his request), and just asking me about every single sign, or package, or whatever with writing on it. He can sound out simple words and is wanting to read more, but is getting frustrated with more complicated words.<br/>
What I have been doing is just explaining each word as he encounters it, by saying something like &quot;E and A together usually make the eeee sound&quot; or that sometimes vowels can make different sounds so if the short sound doesn&#39;t work try the long sound (he doesn&#39;t actually know the terms long and short vowel sounds, I just say the sounds).<br/>
My question is, should I be doing more to explain letter and sound patterns? Or should I just keep repeating these things until they stick the way the letter sounds stuck by playing the starfall games? Would it be helpful for him to know that there are these letter patterns and some general rules? Or will he figure that out just from seeing them repeatedly? Or does it depend on the person?<br/>
Thanks in advance for any insight you have to offer.</div>

<br/>
The principle of natural learning covers that, I think.  Don&#39;t &quot;just keep repeating&quot; anything.  It&#39;s not about sticking, it&#39;s about his learning.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Would it be helpful for him to know that there are these letter patterns and some general rules? Or will he figure that out just from seeing them repeatedly?-=-<br/>
<br/>
He will figure it out in his own way, if you let him.  Answering his questions is nice.  Having a program of explaining more and more sounds more like teaching than helping.<br/>
<br/>
What i would do (what I have done) is not to focus on anything that&#39;s causing frustration.  He will learn to read, and it will be a better memory if it&#39;s a happy one.    If he&#39;s focussed on something that makes him feel less-than or frustrated, he&#39;ll have a harder time learning anything.  And generally, kids are learning lots of things at the same time.  Maybe watch more movies for a while, do more physical things away from printed words.   He will see words, but surrounding him with them seems counter-productive if he&#39;s not quite ready.<br/>
<br/>
This probably sounds wrong to new unschoolers, but the same way it helps &quot;to sleep on it&quot; when someone&#39;s stuck in processing thoughts, it can help to get away from something frustrating, to do something that uses totally different parts of the brain and body.<br/>
<br/>
Do it casually, without saying why.  Don&#39;t talk about it, just find some really fun things he can do and be learning from for a few weeks or months.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260814801">I would tell him what the signs say and move on with a joyous day! Each and <br/>
every time. I would stop talking about how to sound out the words. The &quot;when two <br/>
vowels go walking, the first one does the talking&quot; kind of thing is falling out <br/>
of favour with instructors, because there are so many instances when it isn&#39;t <br/>
true. Robin Coburn posted a message with a lovely example of how it doesn&#39;t <br/>
work: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/59152.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/59152.</a>  There is a <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
But the fact that the rules don&#39;t really work isn&#39;t why I&#39;d stop trying to <br/>
instil them in your son. I&#39;d stop because it isn&#39;t working.  I&#39;d stop because he <br/>
isn&#39;t at a point where your words are helping him to understand. I&#39;d stop <br/>
because going over and over something again and again can make you sound more <br/>
and more like the adults in Charlie Brown: &quot;wahwahwahwahwah.&quot; Instead do <br/>
fabulously fun and engaging things. Go out and be in the world and find cooler <br/>
and more interesting things than garnering frustration over interpreting a sign. <br/>
Stay home and snuggle up and watch a favourite show or play a cool computer game <br/>
or build fabulous towers with blocks and terrorise the figures you use to <br/>
populate the blocks with bouncy balls or whatever. Make wonderful food; dance; <br/>
play; run around; explore; turn over rocks and logs; go fishing; go skipping; <br/>
draw with chalk; blow bubbles; go swimming; go splashing; put on boots and jump <br/>
in puddles; squish your toes in mud; go biking; build with geomags; play a board <br/>
game; build card houses and knock them down with paper aeroplanes; use yarn and <br/>
make a spider web fort all around the furniture; use blankets and make a more <br/>
normal fort and have a picnic under the chairs; find some cardboard boxes and <br/>
cut them up and rebuild them with duct tape and create fabulous structures; go <br/>
to the grocery store and buy up one of all the different kinds of bubble gum on <br/>
offer and see which blows the best bubbles; get different kinds of root beer and <br/>
vanilla ice cream and have taste tests for root beer floats; go swing and see <br/>
who can swing higher; go sliding and see who slides faster; go roller skating; <br/>
go to the zoo and watch the people; go to the zoo and watch the animals. There <br/>
is so much more in the world than signs and soundings out. Really. <br/>

Hello. I am a new member and I imagine that learning to read is discussed often, <br/>

My son has been plugging away at puzzling out the alphabet and the basic letter <br/>
sounds. He has spent a lot of time on starfall.com (at his request), and just <br/>
asking me about every single sign, or package, or whatever with writing on it. <br/>
He can sound out simple words and is wanting to read more, but is getting <br/>

sometimes vowels can make different sounds so if the short sound doesn&#39;t work <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522020341">  When my son was learning to read I simply answered his questions.<br/>
If he asked me what that word said, I just read it to him. He  played a little <br/>
on Starfall too.<br/>
It made not sense to him  in terms of learning to read. Sounding out words were <br/>
not the way for him.<br/>
It would have made him quite confuse had I tried to &quot;help&quot; him by sounding out <br/>
words or letters.<br/>
 At six and a half he was reading fluently and a year later he started asking me <br/>
things like:<br/>
Why does &quot;inset word&quot; sounds like this? Shouldn&#39;t it sound like &quot; insert <br/>
other pronunciation&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
IT was very  interesting. He still like to play with words and sounds!<br/>
 Had I  tried to &quot;teach&quot; him I would have made him very confuse. He can get <br/>
frustrated easy.<br/>
So Starfall was boring to him. He was into Roblox back then ( an online building <br/>
game).<br/>
That is how he learned to read. I sat with him hours reading and typing so he <br/>
would talk to other players.<br/>
Then he could read some and pick out pre-written phrases out of a menu and write <br/>
things like: follow me,  <br/>
<br/>
want to be my friend, cool, lets build.<br/>
 Then I would sit and help with reading and spell out the words so he could <br/>
type. In the beginning I had to point<br/>
to the keyboard so he would know which letters. Then I did not need anymore. He <br/>
needed me less and less until<br/>
he rarely needed me and I would be in another room and just shout  back to him <br/>
or write in a piece of paper  for him to copy.<br/>
 Then he picked up a book and read a story to his sister and my mouth fell. I <br/>
knew he could read and write but<br/>
just how well and fast. It was amazing. <br/>

The neural pieces of the puzzle need to be in place for it all to come together. <br/>

my son, Simon, it wasn&#39;t until he was 12. What will it do to your son if those <br/>

puzzling over words as his frustration grows? Or can you try and distract him <br/>

#2, if you tell him everything there is to find, what will he learn on his own?<br/>
<br/>
In part it sounds as though you the mom could use more deschooling.  I had kids who cared about word histories and trivia (two out of three kids), and it was fun for me to always add one little story.  I probably still do that.  I think I do that with adults. :-)   <br/>
<br/>
For instance, some people, if asked why there&#39;s a silent &quot;w&quot; in &quot;two&quot; will say something like &quot;because English is stupid,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  But when I was asked, I was able to say &quot;Because it used to be pronounced, and still is in Scotland, as &quot;twa,&quot; and it&#39;s related to all the &quot;twice, twins, twixt&quot; kinds of words.  &quot;Between,&quot; I just realized while I was writing this, has that.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808559860">Ah, I see your point. At this time I would say that he can be frustrated in the moment but persists in his curiosity. He also shows a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around reading. There have been other things (like time concepts) that he has been really curious about but not able to grasp fully and he backed off on his own after a certain point, and he will come back to it occasionally to pick up new bits as they begin to make sense. I was assuming that with this also he would back off it was feeling too much for him. But it would be good to keep in mind that he might not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572409878">When my 8 yeAr old was learning to read, he would notice those kinds of patterns, we were sitting in a waiting room for ex. When he had a seemingly never ending bloody nose and he asked what the word caution said.  After I told him he sat there a while and said, &quot; so, sometimes t says sh in some words when it comes in front of ion&quot;. From then on he could read and spell tion words.  I never really told him those rules unless he asked, but he did seem to find them interesting and they helped him learn to read.  My older son, who is 9 now, however, has never had much interest in those patterns and does not appear to be helped by things like that.  I actually did try to teach him to read when he was younger and the rules didn&#39;t stick.  Each word always seemed to be new and different.  He is starting to read now and reads very differently than his brother.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550185869">When Xander was 7 and 8 we worked on sight words. I got a box of sight word flash cards. It was a struggle, but in the end he learned all of the words. It was so frustrating for Xan, but he really wanted to learn to read. He was also trying to learn how to write and this was even more frustrating. No matter how much he wanted to learn, he just was not able to read or write to his satisfaction or at the level he wanted. (Xan wasn&#39;t interested in reading beginning books. He wanted novels right away.) I realized that Xan was just not ready to read or write at that time. We stopped doing anything formal right away. Xan started reading for himself at age 10 and is very proficient! I gave him some basics, but he took it from there. I am so glad I didn&#39;t make him use the phonics tiles my mother bought for us. <br/>
<br/>
When Xan asked me to read a sign or what not (before he could read), I would just read it and make sure to pronounce it clearly. He would usually repeat it (on his own accord) and then we&#39;d continue on with what we were doing. I kept it simple. I have a bad habit of always reading signs out loud to this day, even without being asked. I just read anything with words anywhere when I&#39;m with Xan and of course now he says, &quot;Yeah mom, I already read that.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Hello. I am a new member and I imagine that learning to read is discussed often, so I hope this is not too redundant.<br/>
&gt; My son has been plugging away at puzzling out the alphabet and the basic letter sounds. He has spent a lot of time on starfall.com (at his request), and just asking me about every single sign, or package, or whatever with writing on it. He can sound out simple words and is wanting to read more, but is getting frustrated with more complicated words.<br/>
&gt; What I have been doing is just explaining each word as he encounters it, by saying something like &quot;E and A together usually make the eeee sound&quot; or that sometimes vowels can make different sounds so if the short sound doesn&#39;t work try the long sound (he doesn&#39;t actually know the terms long and short vowel sounds, I just say the sounds).<br/>
&gt; My question is, should I be doing more to explain letter and sound patterns? Or should I just keep repeating these things until they stick the way the letter sounds stuck by playing the starfall games? Would it be helpful for him to know that there are these letter patterns and some general rules? Or will he figure that out just from seeing them repeatedly? Or does it depend on the person?<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance for any insight you have to offer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782671496">One thing I would like some clarification on is that the OP mentioned that her son is asking her about the letters/ sounds etc in order to try and figure it out himself and is frustrated when she just tells him what the word is. So it seems like his question is not what is this word but something different. I may have misunderstood this though. However if he is asking a question about the letters/ phonics/ rules and not asking outright what the word is ,is it then helpful to just answer with what the word is?<br/>
If my son asked me what 8 and 8 more was I would tell him the answer. however if he saw the following written down 8 + 8 and asked me what the + meant I would not just tell him the answer is 16 as that wasn&#39;t his question. I would also apply this to reading as well. Am I missing something? <br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if there is some perception by the child that this is *THE* way to read and that may be why he is not looking at or grasping whole words and feeling frustrated at not being able to decode everything. My son has not been taught to read but has been exposed to some phonics mainly due to kids TV that my younger DD loves. It became clear to me after a while that he believed he couldn&#39;t read because he couldn&#39;t decode every word and discounted words that he knew through recognition. <br/>
I had a brief and very casual conversation with him about different ways people come to reading and he seemed to relax a lot around it. <br/>
<br/>
For myself I think I learnt to read the whole word way and built up a large lexicon that then enabled me to recognise patterns and decode other words that way but I do not believe I did it through phonics even then - but a more visual pattern recognition.<br/>
I remember once having an aha moment on watching Sesame Street showing how the letter e changed the length of the vowel in a word ie. cod or code. However I already &quot;knew&quot; that rule I just had never had a verbal expression for it it was just a pattern I recognised at some level. It never held me back I was a voracious reader from an early age.<br/>
<br/>
I think my son struggled for a short while with the received idea that he needed to use phonics to decode words or he wasn&#39;t reading. That was because he had no information that there are other ways of reading and they are not cheating but valid.<br/>
He will be 8 tomorrow and would not choose to read a book but his vocabulary of recognisable words is visibly expanding. As he doesn&#39;t have to demonstrate any of this to me I can only assume it is probably greater than I know about. He seems happy and continues to gain much pleasure and knowledge from books via me or DH reading to him and the same with computer/DS games. <br/>
He loves language and words and plays with them all the time making up wordplays and jokes based on wordplay. His spoken and understood vocabulary is pretty amazing to me. His viewpoint is that the most efficient way at the moment for him to get enjoyment or information from the written word is by us reading it to him. However he is also moving more and more towards reading things for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my main point was that frustration may come from believing that decoding is the only way to read even if it doesn&#39;t come easily. That may not be the case for this child but, as there seems to be a great deal of emphasis on phonics on kids TV (at least in the UK),it may be the case for others.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Karl was interested in thinking about numbers when he was 3 and that<br/>
came very easily for him. He was interested reading when he was 4 and<br/>
5 years old, and even though he had figured out some things such as<br/>
the fact that letters are doing something to construct the words, he<br/>
was not quite able to see where and how. It was the same about<br/>
writing, where tears fell over not being satisfied with how he was<br/>
writing something (even though I was impressed at what he knew!). I<br/>
interacted with him for a bit and then said that it takes time to find<br/>
what makes sense for him in order to write (or read), and that he will<br/>
find most of it by accident not on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
There were several times that frustration mounted quickly. Frustration<br/>
is anxiety, an expression of fear. When fear happens, learning shuts<br/>
down. It shuts down the ability to reason in favor of quick reaction.<br/>
It favors tunnel vision and shuts down peripheral vision, making the<br/>
ability to see patterns impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Even when a child is ready and able to see how something works, taking<br/>
frequent breaks doing fun stuff for fun&#39;s sake puts breaks on fear and<br/>
frustration so that learning CAN take place and the child can see the<br/>
pieces of the puzzle coming together.<br/>
<br/>
More times than not, distraction can be much better for learning than<br/>
concentration.<br/>

Just this morning I put up a quote from someone about agitation (elevated heartbeat) making thought impossible.   <br/>

I linked it here: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Getting away from words/reading/signs for long stretches at a time (hours, or weeks) WILL help with reading, even though it seems to someone who&#39;s invested in rushing a child along that it would not help at all.<br/>

Stepping away from the reading, turning another directions, and filling the horizon with pictures, music, activities will help the mother see other kinds of learning, and give them both a chance to breathe, and smile, and relax together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191213962">I guess I just felt it was a bit harsh to answer a child&#39;s actual question with an answer to a different question. However I completely agree with not using it in anyway as a teaching point and to consider that his needing to ask the questions may be coming from a different place than readiness and natural inclination. Also as suggested to move the focus way way away from the written word as much as possible and have more fun,fun,fun. As well as more deschooling around reading and learning in general.<br/>
My other point was just using my DS as an example to try to put across to the OP the possibility that just because a child is trying hard to use a certain method or do a certain thing does not always mean he is naturally drawn to it or ready for it. It may be because he believes he should be able to do it/ is scared that he won&#39;t be able to do it/ likes how much a parent likes him doing it or thinks that is the only way to do it. So not necessarily a natural inclination for phonics. <br/>
With my DS, given his personality, age and my knowledge of him, a short casual conversation at an opportune moment was fine. There were probably other ways I could have approached it but that seemed like best fit with my knowledge of both of us. However I had to believe and trust in what I was saying ie that reading could happen in many ways. Also my son wasn&#39;t particularly focussed on trying to &quot;do&quot; phonics but seemed to have developed certain beliefs about reading. So my approach would probably be too direct and wordy for the OP and her child at the moment and I don&#39;t want that to be taken as my advice to her. <br/>

Well, when he discovered all the letters there are to find, he then learned some of the sounds associated with them on his own and then how those sounds combine to form some words, and then how his grandmother pronounces some sounds differently because she speaks Spanish, etc. etc. etc. Basically he went deeper with it.<br/>

<br/>
It could help for mom to look for other ways to play with words and sounds - ways that don&#39;t necessarily look like &quot;reading&quot;. Playing with alliteration is fun for some kids. Or rhyming games. Singing and reading poetry - silly stuff with goofy words that are fun to try to sing or say. Tongue twisters. If he likes those sorts of things then playing that was *is* helping him learn about how sounds make up words. <br/>
<br/>
Magnetic letters are fun for this, too - spell out some gibberish and pronounce it. Don&#39;t bother to talk about rules, do it for the fun of it. If he&#39;s the sort of person who will find phonetic information useful learning to read, then he&#39;ll derive the rules on his own. But he might not find that kind of information useful. Have fun to have fun, not with the expectation of a specific outcome. <br/>

If you already knew what answer you wanted, and the answers here are wrong, then it seems (perhaps) we were being quizzed?  Or we were being invited to rubber-stamp a method already decided on?  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about natural learning, not about how to justify hanging on to more traditional ideas about how to learn.<br/>
<br/>
BUT... if a child asks a question, I would answer it.<br/>
I would not take that as an invitation to continue to lecture or explain past a few words.<br/>
I would not take it as evidence that he wanted a similar answer every time something like that came up.<br/>

<br/>
Kirby asked about the names of letters when he could hardly speak a word otherwise.  He was especially interested in the letters that made up his name.  But he didn&#39;t read very early.   Seven/eight, he was fluent.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The use of the terms &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;succeed&quot; make me think, again, that this is indicating a lack of deschooling in the mother.  And the problem with that, for this list, is that it could damage the ability of unschooling to succeed.   The primary strategy for unschooling involves deschooling.<br/>

Although this list can be used to discuss how to support a child who is learning to read, the only kind of support that ultimately should be given here is that which supports natural learning and unschooling at the same time.<br/>

Yes.  Let him discover some of those truths himself, with a little help, over time.  Don&#39;t rush to discover them all and check the timer to see how quickly they were understood.<br/>
<br/>
When Easter eggs are hidden, there are some truths that can be understood.  The mother could show a child where each one is, but that wouldn&#39;t be the child hunting the eggs.  That would be the child picking up the eggs the mother remembered hiding, or found.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595131621">*****For instance, some people, if asked why there&#39;s a silent &quot;w&quot; in &quot;two&quot; will say something like &quot;because English is stupid,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;*****<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old reads, but is only just beginning to show an interest in spelling.  Lately, he likes to try to spell words out loud while he&#39;s talking.  This is what he said (with a giggling, light-hearted tone) just this afternoon about silent letters  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mom I&#39;ll be right back.  Back.  B-A-C-K is that right, or do I need a silent E at the end?  I don&#39;t think I do this time.  And why is silent E silent?  Don&#39;t they make other silent letters too?  Like K-N-O-W with silent K?  Sometimes I think every word should just end with an E because it doesn&#39;t seem to matter if it&#39;s there or not.  I mean, since it&#39;s silent, when they were inventing words, couldn&#39;t they have just left that out??  Or maybe they could have made it an O or a K or a Z that ended all the words.  You know  since it doesn&#39;t matter anyway.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t want answers to his questions or information about words or silent letters  he just wanted to share what he thought was a funny thing, and then he moved on to battle his Star Wars figures.  If we had tried to teach him to read or spell instead of letting him learn his own way, I can only guess that he might have found the &quot;rules&quot; of the English language frustrating.  Instead he finds them amusing :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852515883"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am just trying to figure out the best way to help figure out how to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder, though, if asking for help in &quot;reading&quot; the word is being <br/>
interpreted by you as asking for help in sounding it out. Do you, maybe, <br/>
equate learning to read with &quot;sounding it out?&quot; That&#39;s a very limited <br/>
idea of what reading is, but it would explain why you think there are <br/>
all these rules he&#39;ll need to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that you don&#39;t really grasp how much more there is to <br/>
learning to read than learning all the &quot;sounding out&quot; rules. I have <br/>
three kids who each learned to read in their own natural way and those <br/>
ways were each very very different from the others. The most <br/>
interesting, to me, was watching Rosie (now 20) learn to read. She did <br/>
not even know the sounds of all the letters of the alphabet when she was <br/>
already reading quite a bit. She had learned to recognize words - not to <br/>
sound them out. She learned to recognize a LOT of words - hundreds - <br/>
before she started to use the sounds to figure words out. It was super <br/>
obvious when Rosie was from about 4 to 8 years old that her brain was <br/>
not able to put together sounds and symbols - she seemed unable to <br/>
really &quot;hear&quot; the distinct sounds in a word until she was much older - <br/>
closer to 13 years old.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is interested in &quot;sounding out,&quot; they will be very specific in <br/>
their questions or comments. I remember Roxana asking about the sounds <br/>
the letter &quot;O&quot; makes - and thinking it was interesting that it didn&#39;t <br/>
always make an &quot;O&quot; sound (as in &quot;oh&quot;). And at that time she sort of <br/>
collected words with &quot;O&quot; in them and was trying to find all the possible <br/>
sounds that an &quot;O&quot; could make. Roxana is STILL very interested in sounds <br/>
- at 23 years old she still finds language fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
So - part of the problem I have with giving reading instructions <br/>
(teaching the child the rules of sounding out, for example) is that it <br/>
presupposes a certain way of learning - that a kid should learn to <br/>
&quot;sound out&quot; words in order to learn to read. What if that isn&#39;t the <br/>
natural way that kid&#39;s brain works? It could have unintended negative <br/>
consequences. AND it isn&#39;t necessary. Have fun - if a kid is asking <br/>
questions, answer them with brief tidbits of helpful information and be <br/>
sensitive - don&#39;t overload. If a kid is indicating an interest in the <br/>
sounds that make up a word, then have some fun with that. But if a kid <br/>
is wanting to read, don&#39;t assume he is interested in how to &quot;sound out&quot; <br/>
words. Maybe he wishes he didn&#39;t need to depend on mom to read for him, <br/>
but that isn&#39;t the same thing as being ready and able to sound out <br/>
words. Maybe he&#39;s a kid who won&#39;t learn to sound out words for years <br/>
more - maybe he&#39;ll learn to recognize a LOT of words, first.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a rich environment where you introduce a variety of <br/>
activities and games and discussions and so on, and if you stick with <br/>
the policy of only continuing doing things that are enjoyable, and if <br/>
you&#39;re sensitive to whether or not the child really IS enjoying whatever <br/>
you&#39;re doing, then I think you&#39;re safe from creating problems.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that many learning disabilities (so-called) are caused by <br/>
early instruction that is not in line with a child&#39;s own learning style. <br/>
Pushing in the wrong direction can, imo, be harmful.<br/>

&quot;the magic e&quot; because it can change the sound of the letters before it.&quot; <br/>
Give him an example or two (if he&#39;s interested) such as: pal/pale or <br/>
mat/mate.<br/>

It seemed clear to me, when Chamille was young, that she didn&#39;t get phonics at <br/>
all.  She was a word collector.  She&#39;d remember words, how to spell them, how to <br/>
say them, in short, she&#39;d recognize them.  At that point I went around putting <br/>
stickers on things all over the house with the word written on it.  I had the <br/>
whole bathroom stickered for a long time.  There was a sticker that said <br/>
&quot;mirror&quot;, or &quot;toothpaste&quot;, or &quot;toilet&quot;, etc.  Those stickers were up for over a <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
There were several other huge contributing factors to Chamille learning to read. <br/>
 One was video games, specifically ToonTown, and the other was books on tape and <br/>
cd.  Book for book, she&#39;d absorbed more than her peers, her cousins included, <br/>
who were competitive school readers but didn&#39;t own any books at home.  She <br/>
watched movies that were based on books.  She did book and movie comparisons.  <br/>
<br/>
So, by the time she could read a whole book, which was a manga, at the age of <br/>
11, she&#39;d already had years of language and word usage and word recognition. <br/>
 She understands grammar, she spells almost perfectly, and she knows the <br/>
difference between &quot;their&quot;, &quot;they&#39;re&quot;, and &quot;there&quot;.  School friends go to her to <br/>
make sure that they have it right.  I didn&#39;t teach her any of that.  She <br/>
absorbed it from living a life full of good fiction!<br/>
<br/>
Her younger sister, who is 9, can read almost everything.  For the last couple <br/>
of years she has relied almost entirely on phonics.  She sounds words out.  It <br/>
is just what she does.  I correct her when she gets it wrong and I&#39;m patient <br/>
while reading with her to give her a chance to figure it out first.  It&#39;s a slow <br/>
and sometimes tedious process.  When she gets a word wrong and I say it right, <br/>
her response is generally one of interest and amusement at how it&#39;s spelled so <br/>
different from how it&#39;s spoken.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux has never been all that interested in story books.  She likes picture <br/>
books.  She still reads her picture books, especially the ones with any touch <br/>
and feel, or look and find.  She LOVES &quot;I Spy&quot; books!  She likes to go online <br/>
and look up youtube videos and play Facebook games or chat there.  These days, I <br/>
rarely need to spell out a word for her.  She doesn&#39;t always spell it right, but <br/>
she&#39;ll spell how it sounds and others can still read and understand what she&#39;s <br/>
written.  Sometimes I correct her and sometimes I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Just like all kinds of learning, there is a point at which a kid will be on the <br/>
cusp of figuring something out, where there is frustration before understanding. <br/>
 Reading is no different than say, learning how to use scissors.  There will <br/>
likely be frustration and mistakes, but if it&#39;s fun, they&#39;ll still figure it <br/>
out!<br/>
 <br/>

YES!  We have magnetic letters that get played with all the time, alongside a <br/>
huge chalkboard in the kitchen!  Those things are wonderful ways to play with <br/>
letters and words!  Dry erase boards are nice too.  Margaux and I used to play a <br/>
fun game of hide the word with her DS.  I&#39;d type something in with the stylus, <br/>
then draw over it so that the whole screen was blacked out.  She&#39;s have to go <br/>
and use the stylus on erase and she&#39;d uncover the mystery message.  We also used <br/>
to play with foam letters in the bathtub.  We&#39;d float words and messages.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Angela,<br/>
this isn&#39;t really what I am trying to suggest. I am saying that it might help you to understand that there may be other reasons why he is so invested in phonics at the moment and not necessarily to do with relaxed natural learning. I don&#39;t think showing him that there are other strategies is the route for you at this point as it could easily be teaching and overwhelm with another set of rules and variables. My DS is older than yours and we have a different history. <br/>
<br/>
At this stage I would just be open in your own mind to the fact that there are many many ways he might come to reading. You don&#39;t need to show him what they are or might be. It can be exciting when you think your child is starting to read and with all your unschooling enthusiasm you want to support it but often our thoughts about how to support it fall back to schooly techniques and resources. Actually supporting him is just having fun and providing rich experiences for him they don&#39;t have to be tailored to reading at all. and as he is showing frustration they probably should be distracting from the written word and doing other things instead.<br/>

<br/>
Dylan didn&#39;t find magnetic letters super interesting but he did like the little words from the various magnetic poetry kits we had.   We had some Mag Heads, different shapes that could put together to make abstract looking characters, and he liked incorporating the words from magnetic poetry into his creations.  Making hats or clothing our of words like &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;tent&quot; or having words like &quot;tired&quot; or &quot;out&quot; in the place of eyes.   He got to recognize many words but was also happy to play with the magnetic words without always knowing what the word was.  <br/>
<br/>
Those magnets sometimes got used in train or other play.  Dylan would set up his Thomas trains and if he thought a place needed trees but didn&#39;t have any more little wooden trees to put there, he would get the magnet that said &quot;tree&quot; and the space where he put it became the forest.  The  word &quot;rock&quot; was an obstruction on the tracks, or a rock slide, or a boulder a monster might hide behind.  <br/>
<br/>
We all played with those.  David, who in those days would be gone to work before Dylan woke up, would leave messages for Dylan on the refrigerator.   &quot;Cow will eat your shoe&quot; or &quot;frog dance on jelly&quot;  and Dylan would be so excited to go see what his dad had left him and maybe make some little message for his dad to find that night when he got home.  We still have refrigerator poetry and still leave messages for each other. <br/>
<br/>
For Dylan reading came gradually over years and whole word recognition was the biggest part of how he learned.   He read books beyond his reading ability quite happily by simply skipping the words he did not recognize.    Occasionally he asked what a word was, but only if it was an interesting looking word, or if it was repeated often enough for him to wonder whether it held some significance to the story.      <br/>
