<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926340851">Hello everyone!<br/>
My name is Reenie- I am a stay- at-home mom and artist (doll artist). I have two girls- Ann Elise 2 1/2 and Evelyn Grace (Eve) 5 1/2. We are &quot;UNSCHOOLING&quot;! <br/>
I am looking for like-minded people to chat with. I live in a very conservative area and the only homeschoolers I know are curriculum-aholics. I am definitely an odd-ball with my laid back approaches. I know there are others who see things as I do- I am currently reading &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by John Holt.<br/>
<br/>
My background: I have a BSE in Art Education. I am certified for K-12. I substituted in the public schools just enought to know that my kids were NOT going there- and that was before they were even born. I live in PA where the HS requirements are nasty- (testing, evaluations and portfolios)<br/>
Since I have a certificate, I can by-pass these laws, I just need to take courses to &quot;update&quot; my teaching certificate first. BUT- we are planning to move to MD in the next 2 years- where you are only required to turn in a portfolio.<br/>
Any MD unschoolers?<br/>
Gotta go- there is a tea party in my LR that I am invited to and I hear they have choc chip cookies!<br/>
LOVE TO CHAT!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi!<br/>
I&#39;m in MD.  Eastern Shore.<br/>
It&#39;s is not a requirment to turn in a portfolio here.  In my county, <br/>
we are suppose to get biannual visits from a school board rep. (Or <br/>
you could choose an umbrella group)  At that time, you can show them <br/>
things your children have done, books read, examples of math and <br/>
writing....your suppose to cover the subjects they teach in school.  <br/>
My 1st two years, I was visited, and it was very easy to categorize <br/>
things my kids did, and put it in schooly terms.  The man was usually <br/>
impressed with how much we were doing.  <br/>
I somehow slipped through the cracks, and haven&#39;t been called for an <br/>
appointment in over two years now ( oh, darn).  The people I do know <br/>
that get visited(not unschoolers) tell me that there is a new guy and <br/>
he is very easy going, and the most important thing seems to be an <br/>
attendance record! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978359292">Hi Reenie,<br/>
<br/>
We are in MD also.  Joanna I did not know you were on the Eastern Shore.  We are in Crofton, not far from Annapolis.<br/>
<br/>
Our county requires a twice a year portfolio review.  My first review is coming up on Feb. 24th.  I asked for an appointment to review my portfolio.  What they asked for was a notebook of the work being done in the 5 subject areas being taught in ps.  Our portfolio is going to be a little light so it will be interesting to see what happens.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to find out what the minimum amount of stuff is.  I was thinking of making some of it myself if my kids don&#39;t wind up doing it on their own.  It would be less expensive than getting one of the unschool friendly charter schools to oversee us.<br/>

NO! NO! NO! That is over and above Maryland State Homescooling Laws. PLEASE<br/>
don&#39;t let them come into your home! If that is what the county is telling<br/>
you is required, they are not following the law.<br/>
There also is no attendance requirement like you mentioned later. Please<br/>
think about finding out a little more about the homescooling law in Maryland<br/>
as the actions of one county affects what happens to regulations over the<br/>
entire state. It is vital to our homeschooling freedoms to ONLY give the<br/>
state what is required. The law is not a starting point for HSing<br/>
requirements. It is the limit.<br/>
Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mhea.com/legal.htm">http://www.mhea.com/legal.htm</a> for info on what is and isn&#39;t<br/>
allowed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Pat<br/>
I thought the md in your name might mean Maryland!<br/>
When I did my review, I showed very few things my kids had actually <br/>
written down.  I think I showed a math workbook, and only a few pages <br/>
had been messed with.  He didn&#39;t look through it.  Just recorded the <br/>
names of things we were using.<br/>
A friend of mine started making a list of things covered by her kids <br/>
and divided them into subjects.  The books read and field trips taken <br/>
took up pages to themselves.  I did that (but he never came that <br/>
year).  I wrote the heading &quot;math&quot; and under it would write all the <br/>
computer games, real life games, workbooks we happen to have here, <br/>
Puzzle Mania, savings account, shopping.....then I did the same for <br/>
science......  Filled up a few pages, and it was easy and kinda fun. <br/>
(Though I haven&#39;t done it again in over 2 years so it must not have <br/>
been *that* fun) My friend said the ps man just took her list and put <br/>
it in the file and chatted a little then left.  That was it.<br/>
I&#39;m sure it depends on your county and whose in charge of <br/>
homeschoolers.  It seems we are lucky here, and they must be <br/>
overburdened by all the homeschoolers here, because I&#39;m not the only <br/>
one who no longer is getting visited.<br/>
