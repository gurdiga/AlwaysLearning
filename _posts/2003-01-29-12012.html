<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078158001">I&#39;ve always figured myself and my kids to be lucky.  As I was born in<br/>
England and lived there till 22 I can always take my kids and hubby<br/>
there to live if I choose.  I&#39;m also now an American citizen (the<br/>
British don&#39;t recognize the right to give up your citizenship of Great<br/>
Britain when you were born there) so America is a place I can live.  My<br/>
brother emmigrated from England to Canada and is a Canadian and British<br/>
citizen too so we could emmigrate to Canada without too many problems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Make sure you keep your UK passport up-to-date as it&#39;s getting trickier now<br/>
even if you are British when you take on citizenship to other countries.<br/>
The UK is getting very strict as there is so much immigration there that<br/>
everyone is calling out for tough laws. The major thing now is if your<br/>
mother is/was British -- not just if you were born there.<br/>
If you have a UK passport you can live anywhere in the EU and have the same<br/>
rights to work as anyone from that member country.<br/>
You can emmigrate to AU and NZ but apparantly now we UK citizens are the<br/>
same as anyone else (no handouts for the motherland:) I know that AU has an<br/>
age limit of 45 and you have to be a professional (they usually want a<br/>
graduate degree) or have a large bank account. From what I&#39;ve heard the<br/>
same goes for Canada and NZ.<br/>
<br/>
Emmigration is a biggy here as we have so many subcontinental people and<br/>
they are always trying to get into those western countries (so I see lots<br/>
of articles in the newspaper). What amazes me is how discriminating the US<br/>
is and won&#39;t even let subcontinental people get visit visas to take a<br/>
vacation in the US. They can only go if they are over the age of about 50<br/>
and fully employed in another country. It&#39;s really hard because people have<br/>
to pay quite a large amount of money just to apply to try and get a visit<br/>
visa only to be turned down (and they don&#39;t refund the money). I know<br/>
people who&#39;ve been trying for years to visit the US.<br/>

Did the government people in the US tell you that you must give up your<br/>
passport from the UK when you took out citizenship? They did me and I just<br/>
smiled nicely. The UK allows for dual but not the US.<br/>
