Lexie heard the song &quot;we don&#39;t need no education, we don&#39;t need no <br/>
thought control...&quot;  today.  What is that song called? The wall?<br/>
<br/>
anyway, she thought it was a really cool song!<br/>
<br/>
I can just hear her singing that now.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Hi Joylyn,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure twentyhundred people will respond, but I&#39;m gonna too!  :)<br/>
That&#39;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; by Pink Floyd, though it was remade<br/>
in the last several years for a movie (The Faculty maybe?)  I dunno.  I<br/>
remember singing this on the bus in high school... It was a fairly new<br/>
song back then... Ugh I&#39;m old.  LOL...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115665407">thanks!<br/>
<br/>
For the record though, I do  know the song well.  I just didn&#39;t remember <br/>
the name of the particular song.  The album was also one of my <br/>
favorites, especially during the days when I was, well, experimenting <br/>
with herbal substances.<br/>
