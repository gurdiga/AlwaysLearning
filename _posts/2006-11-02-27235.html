<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016885936">Today i met this woman while my kids were in gymnastics.  we have <br/>
talked before because i have a 3 year old and she has 3 year old twins <br/>
and they play together in the back on the gynmastics waiting are while <br/>
the other kids are in gymnastics.  today we were talking about various <br/>
things and she kept talking about how her 6 year old cant read and he <br/>
has to learn and they do school in the mornings without fail and he is <br/>
going to be tested soon (i guess cause he cant read?) and on and on.  <br/>
I didnt know what to say.  i did make a comment that we really dont do <br/>
anything structured.  but when she said she has put all their toys <br/>
away and just pulls out blocks, or trains, or cars each day and is <br/>
trying to train them to just play with the one type of toy each day i <br/>
think my mouth was hanging open.  do you throw in your 2 cents in a <br/>
situation like that or do you just keep your mouth shut?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858704067">LOL..judgement call!  Depends how well you feel you can take what she throws back!<br/>
I tend to put my 2 cents in...(kinda like now?)  Sometimes if you have excellent tack, you can <br/>
really open their eyes. Sometimes if you have some of the skills of some of the ladies in this<br/>
group, you can seriously improve a child&#39;s life.  Sometimes, they will look at you like your a freak<br/>
if you fail to get the point across or if they are just locked in their ways.  So what can you handle?<br/>
<br/>
My spouse constantly reminds me to sow good karma.  ( He also keeps a running tab of when <br/>
I withdraw from my karma bank, lol)  No good come back goes without a payment he says.<br/>
<br/>
Go with your gut.  Trust yourself to know whats needed.<br/>
