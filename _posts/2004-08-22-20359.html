She is not in physical pain from an injury. She is not starving. She is <br/>
not scared. She is not lonely or neglected. I am there for her if she <br/>
wants a hug.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On a public message board, people may very well post messages in response to<br/>
what you write. That is the nature of the beast. There is absolutely no need<br/>
to respond to them, even if (maybe ESPECIALLY if) you&#39;re feeling like you<br/>
need to defend yourself. You don&#39;t need to. None of us has the slightest<br/>
power over you, your family, or your decisions, so you can just let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Letting things settle and move on is fine. Taking some days to quietly<br/>
reflect on what people say, with or without response and with or without<br/>
ultimately agreeing with anything they think, is also fine (and often wise).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1. It&#39;s NOT major. I know my child and I am not minimizing her emotions<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That brings up an interesting side topic on judging, even with intimate<br/>
knowledge of another person, how &quot;major&quot; their distress is at any given<br/>
time. I tend to want to err on the side of assuming that someone who is<br/>
crying needs comfort, rather than assuming that it&#39;s no big thing and<br/>
passing by their distress. If I offer the comfort and they don&#39;t need it,<br/>
that shows soon enough and no harm done. If I fail to and they did need it,<br/>
that&#39;s bad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865209902">I am really trying to bow out of this discussion after Sandra said I was <br/>
going into too much detail about a baby. But people keep posting things <br/>
that I feel I must address.<br/>
<br/>
1. It&#39;s NOT major. I know my child and I am not minimizing her emotions <br/>
just because they aren&#39;t physical pain. If it was major, the crying <br/>
would go on for a lot longer and she would want to be held, snuggled, <br/>
etc. This is just MINOR frustration, disappointment that she prefers to <br/>
work out on her own. I am totally there for her 110%.<br/>
<br/>
2. Perhaps you missed the beginning of the thread, but the whole reason <br/>
why I mentioned DH finding this amusing in the first place was because I <br/>
cautioned him not to laugh. I know how it makes a child feel when they <br/>
are upset and someone laughs at them, my father used to laugh at me all <br/>
the time when I got upset. The more upset I got the more he would laugh. <br/>
Not fun. That is why I told my DH to contain his laughter and he <br/>
understood and promised to from now on. Part of his laughter was also <br/>
surprise because he had never before witnessed her getting so upset when <br/>
a video ended. Because it doesn&#39;t happen every time, just sometimes. <br/>
He&#39;s not unfeeling or lacking in compassion. Neither am I.<br/>
<br/>
3. We treat each other with compassion in this family and we are setting <br/>
a very good example in general for DD in the way we treat each other in <br/>
general on a day to day basis. I know how powerful teaching by example <br/>
is.<br/>

Elissa did not intend to be cute.<br/>
Neither did your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Crying is communication.  <br/>
I don&#39;t maintain this list for people to make recommendations that are not <br/>
respectful of children.<br/>
We are not going back to your original &quot;carefully chosen wording.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
People can talk about the ideas on the table, where they relate to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You ignore your daughter&#39;s crying sometimes, and since you have made yourself <br/>
the judge of what is really worth attention, her communication is made less <br/>
valid.<br/>
You&#39;re ignoring my opinion about your posts, and since you have made yourself <br/>
the judge of what is worth regarding on this list, you need to either pay  <br/>
more attention to my communications or find another list.<br/>
<br/>
From the list&#39;s description, in case you missed it:<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an <br/>
idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, <br/>
general homeschooling discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling <br/>
discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how people learn no matter <br/>
where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular <br/>
country or jurisdiction-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547499470">I was away during this conversation so am chiming in late.  But I&#39;ve <br/>
been thinking about this idea of explaining oneself after getting <br/>
responses to what one said.  I agree with Pam that one doesn&#39;t need to <br/>
defend oneself.  I do think it can be very useful to explain why you <br/>
think the way you do if you know you have an entrenched idea about <br/>
something.  What I mean is that you might know that it isn&#39;t helpful to <br/>
your family for you to dig in your heels about a particular issue but <br/>
you&#39;re having trouble getting past your own fears or upbringing or <br/>
whatever.  A discussion list like this can really help us see our own <br/>
biases, weaknesses, fears, etc.  and can help us see where we might be <br/>
irrational about something. <br/>
