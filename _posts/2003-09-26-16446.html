When my daughter was 8.5 she wanted to learn to read.  I had a friend with a Phd in reading and linguistics who was starting her own tutoring business.  I asked her if she wanted Pat to help her, she said yes.  Pat likes children and made it fun.  She spent a few sessions assessing her, honed in on where her difficulty was and viola - she was reading in 90 days.  Now she happily reads like a house on fire.<br/>
