<div id="ygrps-yiv-122649116">&quot;Steven, who I work with, who wasn&#39;t very nice to me yesterday, but  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t matter, plays saxophone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I talked about diagramming sentences and how the top level of that  <br/>
one would be &quot;Steven plays saxophone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I talked about it being a little like programming, where  <br/>
statements can contain other statements/conditions/whatever, but you  <br/>
have to eventually close all the &quot;)}].<br/>
<br/>
So Holly asked whether diagramming sentences is to help people write  <br/>
more clearly.  I thought a second and said no, it&#39;s so people can talk  <br/>
about the details of grammar.<br/>
<br/>
Holly just looked over my shoulder and said I wrote what she said  <br/>
better than the way she said it.  I said I thought that&#39;s what she  <br/>
said, but she said she had asked was diagramming sentences for so when  <br/>
people write, their writing can be more easily understood?<br/>
but that &quot;write more clearly&quot; is so much  easier for people to  <br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
She has a friend in her 20&#39;s  who teaches English, and asked if she  <br/>
could go to her to talk about English and diagramming sentences and I  <br/>
said no, they don&#39;t do it anymore, but Kelly Lovejoy totally knows how  <br/>
to do it.<br/>
<br/>
And so I&#39;ve brought Holly&#39;s sentence here thinking maybe someone could  <br/>
diagram it for her.<br/>
<br/>
I could do it but I&#39;m only 80% confident in diagramming dependent  <br/>
clauses and like that.<br/>
I did explain semi-colons to my friend Bo last night.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if diagramming sentences was a way to make the study of  <br/>
language seem more scientific.  You can squint and see the chalkboard  <br/>
at a school being full of math equations, or sentence diagrams.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419526306">I always thought of diagramming sentences as being similar to setting up<br/>
equations out of &quot;word problems&quot;.<br/>
I loved diagramming and found the diagramming itself to be useful in<br/>
unraveling &quot;complicated&quot; sentences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531022333"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My editing instructor diagrams sentences for fun!<br/>
<br/>
In class, we *did* diagram sentences, but briefly. When copy editors  <br/>
edit for clarity, we want to make sure that what the author writes is  <br/>
clear to the reader. It is useful to know grammatical structure, and  <br/>
it can help to tease a sentence apart, so you know how to put it back  <br/>
together. Sometimes, the terminology gets in the way, though. It&#39;s why  <br/>
we have reference books &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose Holly had written that sentence for publication. If she had  <br/>
created a character who was saying this, a copy editor might leave it,  <br/>
as this might be exactly how this character would speak. Sort of  <br/>
stream-of-consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
However, if she had written it in non-fiction, an editor might suggest  <br/>
re-writing it.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, (checking my Chicago Manual of Style &lt;g&gt;) &quot;Steven plays  <br/>
saxophone&quot; is an independent clause. &quot;Who I work with&quot; and &quot;who wasn&#39;t  <br/>
very nice to me yesterday&quot; are subordinate clauses.  The phrase  <br/>
beginning with the conjunction &quot;but&quot; - &quot;but that doesn&#39;t matter&quot; - is  <br/>
a conjunction linking an independent clause to a subordinate clause  <br/>
(conjunction is &quot;but&quot;; the independent clause is &quot;that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
matter&quot;). Everything between &quot;Steven&quot; and &quot;plays saxophone&quot; are also  <br/>
interrupters (interrupting the main thought). There are general rules  <br/>
for punctuating the subordinate clauses and interrupters.<br/>
<br/>
So, a copy editor might suggest rewriting the sentence this way:  <br/>
&quot;Steven - who I work with and who wasn&#39;t very nice to me the other day  <br/>
(but that doesn&#39;t matter) - plays saxophone.&quot; Or they might suggest  <br/>
completely recasting it to: &quot;Steven, who I work with, plays saxophone.  <br/>
He wasn&#39;t very nice to me the other day, but that doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, whether it would be one sentence or two would also depend  <br/>
on what was written before or after. Is the fact that he wasn&#39;t very  <br/>
nice more important than playing the saxophone, regardless of the  <br/>
disclaimer &quot;but that doesn&#39;t matter&quot;? Or was the point that he plays  <br/>
saxophone? It can get rather complicated!<br/>
<br/>
For those who enjoys diagramming sentences, as my instructor does,  <br/>
it&#39;s like a word puzzle, I think.<br/>
<br/>
My class has been enlightening. I remember my English teachers&#39;  <br/>
admonitions to &quot;never start a sentence with a conjunction&quot;,  and  <br/>
&quot;never end it with a preposition&quot;? Bunk!  I love this quotation from  <br/>
Charles Allen Lloyd in 1938:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Next to the groundless notion that it is incorrect to end an English  <br/>
sentence with a preposition, perhaps the most wide-spread of the many  <br/>
false beliefs about the use of our language is the equally groundless  <br/>
notion that it is incorrect to begin one with &#39;but or &#39;and.&#39; As in the  <br/>
case of the superstition about the prepositional ending, no textbook  <br/>
supports it, but apparently about half of our teachers of English go  <br/>
out of their way to handicap their pupils by inculcating it. One  <br/>
cannot help wondering whether those who teach such a monstrous  <br/>
doctrine ever read any English themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I still have to stop myself from questioning my sentences when I begin  <br/>
them with &quot;and&quot; or end them with &quot;in.&quot; And (ha, ha!) there are indeed  <br/>
occasions when starting a sentence with &quot;but&quot; would not be correct,  <br/>
strictly speaking &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope that helps. Or maybe it muddifies it beyond recognition  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I usually write how I talk.  Almost always.  A long time ago an english<br/>
lit teacher told all of us to write using our own voice and I took that<br/>
advice literally.  So, sometimes, when I&#39;m writing like I talk, I use<br/>
prepositions first.  It gives a natural flow to how my thought goes from<br/>
my head to my fingers and out into words.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when editing things I&#39;ve written, I tweek it a bit to make it<br/>
read easier.  And sometimes I miss stuff, or the way I&#39;ve worded<br/>
something causes another meaning I didn&#39;t intend, and all of that is<br/>
probably due to tone of voice and inflection, which sometimes can&#39;t be<br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
This is where my mother&#39;s voice in my head comes in handy.  She&#39;s<br/>
amazing in this aspect of writing.  She should&#39;ve been a copy editor. <br/>
She writes for her local small town newspaper, and sometimes the editor<br/>
changes her wording, that she carefully and meaningfully chose, and it<br/>
changes the meaning and context enough to make it confusing.  It bothers<br/>
her when they add or remove punctuation that she purposely put into her<br/>
writing.  She has said, on a number of occasions that the changes make<br/>
her look illiterate, since they are simply wrong, grammatically.   She<br/>
is the kind of person who will catch EVERY mistake that a copy editor<br/>
has missed when a book gets published.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Ideally, the relationship between copy editor and author should be  <br/>
respect for the author&#39;s work. Copy editors are supposed to fix  <br/>
grammatical and punctuation errors, and only slightly more than that,  <br/>
depending on the level of edit. Changes other than spelling (and even  <br/>
then) are often queried to the author. Authors are entitled to reject  <br/>
copy editors&#39; changes.<br/>
<br/>
So, mistakes in books can happen at every level: editor, copy editor,  <br/>
proofreader, typesetter, and author (who has the right to refuse  <br/>
changes). I had no idea about how that worked until I started this  <br/>
program. I can always find mistakes in published works. But, I make  <br/>
them myself. I have a more empathetic view of everyone involved in the  <br/>
process, now.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like your mom had to deal with editors who clearly knew less  <br/>
about writing well than she did. That&#39;s not right or good.<br/>

changes. And tell editors why what they did was wrong (they can learn  <br/>

write and be paid for it. I&#39;ve been questioning that, these past few  <br/>
years. But, hey, you&#39;ve read what I write, both here and in print. You  <br/>

context, punctuation and even spelling, if it comes to that, without  <br/>
working *with* the author.  I meant that it wasn&#39;t fair that Jenny&#39;s  <br/>
mom had to deal with that. I assumed, perhaps wrongly, that her mom&#39;s  <br/>
work was published as edited.<br/>

voice. Cleaning up the other stuff is supposed to help do that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s for a small town newspaper, so the turn around time is very<br/>
quick, and she usually doesn&#39;t even see the edits until it&#39;s been put to<br/>
print.  She does call the editor to let him know his mistakes, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t do much good since what is done is done.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a good writer and meticulous with her editing, but because of<br/>
that, it makes her writing take time.  She&#39;s not really a writer though,<br/>
she does far more accounting for non-profits than anything else.  The<br/>
newspaper article is a little weekly side gig, short opinion piece.<br/>
<br/>
My sister is the writer, she just finished a book that took about 2 yrs,<br/>
in which time, nobody could read it or know anything about it.  I<br/>
imagine my mom is in the middle of reading and offering editing<br/>
suggestions right now.  I haven&#39;t gotten a copy yet....  I&#39;m guessing it<br/>
has personal stuff in it, or stuff about people she knows and that is<br/>
why she wouldn&#39;t let anyone read it in progress.   Who knows, maybe<br/>
there are embarassing stories about me and her in it, that could<br/>
certainly emcompass a book!?</div>
