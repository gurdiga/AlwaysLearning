 The hotel should pay the whole bill.  That&#39;s another angle to take.  Notify <br/>
 your insurance company that you were hurt like you were and that it&#39;s <br/>
 probably actionable in court.  I think they&#39;d pick up that ball and run with <br/>
 it, too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Usually your insurance company will want to sue their insurance if they <br/>
won&#39;t settle for your bills.<br/>
I would contact your insurance to make sure they know it was negligence <br/>
involved in the accident.<br/>
I bet that hotel would settle with you out of court fairly quick.<br/>
I can contact a lawyer friend about how it works when you&#39;re in a different <br/>
state, I&#39;m fairly sure you&#39;ll need to hire someone in SC.<br/>
