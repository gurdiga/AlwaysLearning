<br/>
If you can&#39;t chat, maybe suggest some small messages I can recommend  <br/>
there, or add to a collection.  Responses to this thread could be  <br/>
taken there (or to a page of affirmations, if such a thing comes of it).<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that my friend Bo made me a new piece of art for my  <br/>
random links page, and I&#39;m really happy with it:<br/>

<br/>
It was his idea to have the tree from the main page as an engraving on  <br/>
the metal doors.   I think it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was excited about this chat, until I realized all the quotes I&#39;ve been collecting for a while are all on my computer that was destroyed by a virus a month ago!  I thought I had them in google docs, but alas, they were in a windows thing....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll join if I can anyway, but I won&#39;t have much to contribute in quote form.</div>

Guess what I learned in the chat today!    Jill told us she keeps  <br/>
things she wants to save in a private yahoo list no one sees but  <br/>
her.   I&#39;m going to do that.  I have saved e-mails and notes on  <br/>
computer sticky notes that I really don&#39;t want to lose--things I&#39;ve  <br/>
said I&#39;ll put on a page but haven&#39;t done yet.  I have e-mails sent to  <br/>
myself on my other computer, and it&#39;s sludging up from too many open e- <br/>
mails.  So I&#39;m going to make myself a private or semi-private storage  <br/>
vault and if my computer goes fan up, I&#39;ll still have my notes!!  And  <br/>
if I continue not to get to them, at least they won&#39;t be making my  <br/>
computer only barely useable in the meantime!<br/>
<br/>
My advice to anyone who does this is not to use a really cool name  <br/>
others might have wanted to use, for your storage.     And if not a  <br/>
yahoo list, maybe a private blog (which I know some people have) or a  <br/>
googlegroups page or something.    Keeping your collections on someone  <br/>
else&#39;s computer isn&#39;t at all rude these days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I ended up not chatting, obviously, since I wasn&#39;t there.  A UPS<br/>
delivery came right before the chat and it had new pc games in it, so I<br/>
was a busy mom, helping with that!  I was so involved, that I forgot all<br/>
about the chat until much much later.  Oh well, next one....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to start saving stuff in google docs more.  I use it for lots<br/>
of things and I was really surprised to find that all my quotes weren&#39;t<br/>
there.  I like google docs because it&#39;s online and I can access it from<br/>
anywhere and it&#39;s a little like using MSword.  However, I did find<br/>
something that Joyce wrote many years ago at the unschooling dot com<br/>
boards that I liked and saved and actually got put on a disc at some<br/>
point.  That was fun!  It was a sort of &quot;why school isn&#39;t all it&#39;s<br/>
cracked up to be&quot; sort of post.<br/>
<br/>
I have e-mails sent to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; myself on my other computer, and it&#39;s sludging up from too many open<br/>
 </span></blockquote>e-<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; mails.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chamille usually has so many windows open at once that it slows<br/>
everything up, yet somehow she&#39;s able to navigate them all and IM at the<br/>
same time!  Not like emails of course, that dates us adults you know!<br/>
<br/>
Keeping your collections on someone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; else&#39;s computer isn&#39;t at all rude these days.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love that the internet is one big huge network, and that there are<br/>
ideas and people and words and pictures and all just floating around in<br/>
cyber land, and even though someone somewhere is hosting space to save<br/>
stuff in, there it is, floating around in cyber land, and not on my hard<br/>
drive taking up space!</div>
