<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885573385"><html><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;"><div></div><div>I am a list keeper myself, an engineer by trade.&nbsp; I enjoy the documentation process, and feel lost without lists. Not just lists for what I plan to do, but&nbsp;I like to see lists of what I have accomplished, however small the task.&nbsp; &nbsp; I found myself in the exact same situation a year ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; My lists and documentation were driving activities for suggestions, and impacting how I responded to my older child&#39;s decisions.&nbsp; If it didn&#39;t make my documentation look and feel complete and nice and neat and tidy, it didn&#39;t feel right.&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Due to where my daughter&#39;s birthday falls, I had an extra year before I needed to comply with state requirements regarding reporting and keeping a portfolio.&nbsp; I took that year to back off
 from my list.&nbsp; To observe and be present, and to takes notes only after so much time had passed that it became a little fuzzy.&nbsp; But, I remained conscious of everything going on, and after a few months started a flow chart.&nbsp; A flow chart that was more of a glimpse of our learning path&nbsp;at 50,000 feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of&nbsp;3 weeks ago&nbsp;I have had to start my documentation&nbsp;for real,&nbsp;but I have a completely different mindset as to why, and that is to fulfill my legal requirements and to do nothing more than that.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>My&nbsp;earlier documentation&nbsp;was for so much more, even though no one saw it.&nbsp; And while I can&#39;t speak to what your state requires of you, maybe some of what I realized speaks to you as well.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I realized my documentation was my new project.&nbsp;- It is not.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It became&nbsp;a new tool to use in proving others
 wrong when they questioned the learning going on, when it appears to them that&nbsp;they are only watching tv or playing video games.&nbsp; -&nbsp; Nice to say see, I told you, but not necessary to fulfill my state&#39;s requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#39;t use the documentation to prove to school administrators how wrong they have it.&nbsp; They won&#39;t read my documentation and&nbsp;say, hey, maybe we&#39;re a little off.&nbsp; I can&#39;t change the world with&nbsp;this documentation.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It became a way for me to document what felt like my accomplishments, to say &quot;hey, look how awesome we are&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; -- I don&#39;t need recognition for this document, I need to find other projects that are satisfying that fulfill that sense of accomplishment if it is lacking.&nbsp; I can&#39;t tie my identity to this document of our daily lives.&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I know all that might sound a little extreme, and I didn&#39;t see it at first until I
 stepped back and relaxed.&nbsp; I love documentation, and crave approval for my efforts.&nbsp; This is not the time and place for that, I need only to meet my state&#39;s requirements.&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So, is it possible to shift some of your other documented activities to other days, and leave out &quot;watched &lt;tv show&gt;&quot; even if that is what you did.&nbsp;(And I&#39;m positive there was a ton of learning going on, that you could list without even mentioning the show&nbsp;and just mentioning your observations and things that occurred because of the show)&nbsp;The entire day doesn&#39;t have to be documented, just enough to fulfill the requirements, or shift some activities from another day if you find there are days you can&#39;t find enough to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Heather</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div></div></html></div>
