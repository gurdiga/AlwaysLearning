<div id="ygrps-yiv-154116036">I was watching a bunch of Kahn Academy videos this morning and I thought it might be fun to invite my 12 year old son to watch some with me.  I had sent him the link to the Khan Academy before, but was pretty sure he hadn&#39;t looked at the site on his own.  <br/>
<br/>
After scrolling through the vast list of topics, he settled on the &quot;Developmental Math&quot; category.  My son really likes playing around with numbers, and when he gets that generic, &quot;What&#39;s your favorite subject?&quot; question from someone, he almost always says &quot;Math,&quot; which I find so funny and awesome. <br/>
 <br/>
We were looking through the topics and I asked him if he remembered how to multiply two digit numbers.  We had seen a video of a man who did it by using a method where you put the numbers on a kind of grid, hard to explain in words but if you are interested, it looks like this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSqDIcPSXLY&feature=plcp&context=C3c85a4cUDOEgsToPDskJHckG9EwHn9Il5jpW5mgoY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSqDIcPSXLY&feature=plcp&context=C3c85a4cUDOEgsToPDskJHckG9EwHn9Il5jpW5mgoY</a><br/>
<br/>
He said he remembered how to multiply two digit numbers.  I said, &quot;Can you show me?&quot;  And I wrote down 27 x 33, (but I wrote it one number on top of the other, not in a line like I just typed it.)  Then I grabbed the calculator and punched the numbers in so I&#39;d have the answer.<br/>
<br/>
I expected him to draw the grid and start working on it, but he just sat there.  After a little while I said, &quot;You don&#39;t remember how to do it?&quot; and he said, &quot;I&#39;m doing it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe 20 seconds later he said, &quot;891.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I showed him the calculator.  It felt like a magician&#39;s reveal, like &quot;is this your card?&quot;  We both got tickled and laughed and laughed.  I asked him to explain to me how he got his answer.  It took a few times of him explaining for me to grasp what he did and how he got the right answer.  Basically he multiplied 33 x 30 in his head and got 990, then subtracted 99, because 27 is 3 less than thirty, or 3 33s less.  All this in his head.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share one of those great unschooling moments.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-899638469">That&#39;s awesome. He has actually a complex understanding of not just basic math but the properties of multiplication. That&#39;s a building block for Algebra and other higher level math.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791485296">My daughter loves numbers and calculation and recently has said that she<br/>
wants to investigate what accountants do because she may want to be an<br/>
accountant when she grows up.<br/>
<br/>
I giggle about this because we haven&#39;t done very much formal math, we just<br/>
have a bunch of math books and have done lots of budgeting and baking.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029661078">My favorite multiplication story is about my friend who is an accountant but<br/>
who never learned her multiplication tables. It hasn&#39;t stopped her from a<br/>
career in math!<br/>
