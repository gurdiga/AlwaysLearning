<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969211781">Sounds much like what we call a Quincinera.  Almost like a wedding for<br/>
Hispanic girls at 15.  Around here, she isn&#39;t marrying God, but is making an<br/>
adult commitment to her faith.  Like a debutante party of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
I think about this kind of stuff at times for my kids, if they were<br/>
interested.  It is interesting to think about how the kids might incorporate<br/>
their ethnic backgrounds into their very Anglo lives.  I have visions of my<br/>
8yo in a low-rider (he is fascinated with them) with STAUFFER written across<br/>
the back windshield in Gothic letters.<br/>
