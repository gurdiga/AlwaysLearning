This came on a quote-of-the-day list:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing  <br/>
still.&quot;<br/>
          ~Franklin D. Roosevelt<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Directionally speaking that might be true, but in human factors I  <br/>
thought of two different ways of standing still right away:  There is  <br/>
standing still from fear or emotional wounding, and then there is  <br/>
making a conscious choice to pause and be still.<br/>
<br/>
Probably there are others.  There are probably many ways of going  <br/>
forward, some of which aren&#39;t really desireable, and many ways of  <br/>
standing still. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  LOL! I got the same quote today and thought pretty much the same thing. My thoughts were these:<br/>
  You can stand still in fear and/or confusion, in anger (paralyzing anger), and in meditation or thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The first thing that came to my mind is that one can never truly stand <br/>
still, literally speaking.  I&#39;ve tried and gravity is always pulling <br/>
our bodies one way or another, so that you your body is in constant <br/>
motion.  It&#39;s called &quot;the tiny dance&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Standing still can be deep and pleasant.  I&#39;ve found though, that it <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen very often that I can actually &quot;stand still&quot; for long <br/>
before someone wants me to &quot;get a move on&quot;.  ;)</div>
