<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231128737">I figure there are a lot of you out there who have local groups like these,  <br/>
and since I just started one about 2 weeks ago for the Akron (North  East) <br/>
Ohio area, I thought I&#39;d see if anyone had tips to keep it running  smoothly. I <br/>
am finding it difficult at this point to find that fine line of  balance, but <br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get there-I just don&#39;t want to alienate folks in the  process. <br/>
So, if anyone has any tips or experiences of what worked or what  clearly <br/>
*didn&#39;t* work, I&#39;d appreciate the input! Anything I should specifically  watch out <br/>
for? We&#39;ve already got 20 members and messages are coming pretty  regularly, so <br/>
I think I&#39;m on the right track, but I&#39;m guessing only time will  tell. Thanks <br/>
for any pointers anyone can give me!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496976296">Hopefully yours won&#39;t get hijacked like ours recently did. Some guy just butted in and took it over, started posting all sorts of nonsense. I guess the list owner isn&#39;t actively involved and we really didn&#39;t have much for moderaters either. Another mom recently started up another group, so hopefully the same nut won&#39;t find us again! Julie in MO<br/>
