Other foods can be made easier to access. <br/>

(cooled, like polenta, but white and coarse) with food coloring and <br/>
candles. It was a little thing, but it made it more attractive to <br/>
her, and therefore more desirable. <br/>
<br/>
Morgan goes through stretches where she&#39;s so intent on what she&#39;s <br/>
doing that she forgets to eat and doesn&#39;t notice food unless its <br/>
bright and interesting and can be incorporated in her play *and* <br/>
easy to eat. So from time to time I put foods on tiny little doll <br/>
plates, or use toys for dishes or cups, or decorate everything with <br/>
sprinkles, fancy toothpicks and paper drinks-parasols. <br/>
<br/>
It helps me, when I get frustrated with all these preparations, to <br/>
think about what I would do for a fancy dinner party. Good food is <br/>
more than simple nourishment, its a multisensory experience. A <br/>
luxurious meal is expected to be presented beautifully, on gorgeous <br/>
plates with intricately folded napkins and wonderful music and <br/>
carefully considered lighting. People make careers out of food <br/>
presentation. So putting some energy into making food for my kids <br/>
appealing makes good sense. <br/>
