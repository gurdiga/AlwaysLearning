I have seen Rear Window and loved it and now I own it.  I saw Disturbia <br/>

There are some older movies I just love, but I realize that kids now  <br/>
see them and see their flaws--bad costumes, anachronisms...      One  <br/>
of my favorites is good on male costume (not as good on female) and  <br/>
has a cast-of-thousands battle, but the mispronunciation of common  <br/>
Spanish names bothers some people so much they don&#39;t want to mess  <br/>
with it.  And it&#39;s not on DVD yet, even though it was multi-award- <br/>
winning.  It&#39;s on DVD from China.  That&#39;s El Cid with Charlton Heston  <br/>
and Sophia Loren.  Because I&#39;ve liked it since I was eleven years old  <br/>
or so, I&#39;ve forgiven it its flaws. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Hayden watched Rear Window with me because there was a spoof on The Simpsons<br/>
(Bart broke his leg and thought he witnessed Ned murdering and burying his<br/>
wife -- it was a houseplant). Which led to a discussion on perceptions vs<br/>
reality, and Grace Kelly and the Mika song about her. Which led to a<br/>
discussion about Morocco and royalty and gambling and national languages...<br/>
Hayden wants to see Disturbia, as he really likes Shia LeBouf. He asked that<br/>
we watch this movie at home, so he could pause when he needed to when it<br/>
became intense. Knowing it&#39;s a remake of an old movie, which became a<br/>
Simpsons spoof, takes some of the imagined intensity out of the equation.<br/>
<br/>
There was just a Hitchcock marathon on last weekend and I recorded some of<br/>
them. Hayden&#39;s excited about seeing a few because he&#39;s anticipating finding<br/>
connections to his favorite other things. (&quot;Birds&quot; especially has<br/>
connections to all kinds of pop-culture things)<br/>

Sunday :D Which leads to aaaalllll kinds of other connections from Michael<br/>

<br/>
I have to add, I&#39;ve always been uncomfortable talking to my kids about<br/>
sexual abuse/predators/pedophiles and instead talked to them about keeping<br/>
themselves safe from *anything* that makes them uncomfortable (without going<br/>
into specifics/fear mongering). Family Guy&#39;s perverted old man has given me<br/>
the opportunity to talk about this subject, with some needed humor, in a<br/>
very *real* way without bringing up something icky on an otherwise sunny<br/>
day.  We&#39;ve now talked honestly about the abuse some family members have<br/>
suffered and how we (as OUR family) have taken steps to stop/avoid that<br/>
cycle. Malcom in the Middle does the same thing for a comparison of how I<br/>

I think Holly was only seven years old or so when she said she  <br/>
thought family shows like Married With Children were educational  <br/>
shows for parents.  When Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers would ask a  <br/>
question or pose a situation and pause to give viewers a chance to  <br/>
decide what they thought the answer was, she understood that.  When  <br/>
there were shows about parents and children, she said it was a way  <br/>
for parents to think of what they would do.  ROSEANNE!  That might  <br/>
have been the one she saw as an instructive show for parents, in ways  <br/>
not to be.<br/>

This was probably done with some whining since I was upset at the time, but as she had proclaimed herself my &quot;therapist,&quot; I felt safe enough to unload.  She told me that she&#39;d recently been down with a cold and had watched many late-night reruns of &quot;Roseanne&quot;.  She said I should just get a grip and parent like they did on that show.  That they obviously loved their kids, but wouldn&#39;t let them get away with any sh*t.  That my dd was manipulative, sneaky and knew how to push my buttons.  And that she didn&#39;t think homeschooling was working for us, nor did she think all that time spent together was healthy.  Oh...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rosie watched Roseanne a lot. And compared it with The Cosby Show.  <br/>
She thought Roseanne and Dan were better parents than the Cosbys. She  <br/>
thought the Cosby&#39;s were rude to the kids, arbitrary, and made lots  <br/>
of jokes at their expense. Roseanne and Dan were so clearly  <br/>
struggling to do their best, and showed their love by being loving,  <br/>
unlike the Cosby parents who apparently showed their love by being  <br/>
strict. She especially liked how Dan was with the son, because the  <br/>
son was SO not what Dan would probably have chosen, but he was really  <br/>
sweet to him anyway.<br/>
<br/>
There were times that Roseanne and Dan were just strict and harsh,  <br/>
too, though. But they often reconsidered and changed their minds.  <br/>
That would have NEVER happened on the Cosby show.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - it made for a couple of years worth of educational  <br/>
television. In California, public high schools are required to offer  <br/>
a parenting course. Watching Roseanne and The Cosby Show for a couple  <br/>
of years ought to qualify.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, maybe! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But, really, the meanness factor in the Cosby Show is really apparent  <br/>
when you start looking for it. And on Roseanne, everybody&#39;s feelings  <br/>
are out there, in the open, the good, the bad, and the ugly, but  <br/>
there is a lot of love, too, and tolerance for each others&#39; quirkiness.<br/>
<br/>
Now - I hope I&#39;m not sounding like &quot;I&quot; am nominating Roseanne for a  <br/>
mother-of-the-year award or anything - they&#39;re both sitcoms and  <br/>
pretty bad as role models. Just an interesting comparison and worth a  <br/>
lot of discussion.<br/>

tail end of a Roseanne show last week and it was exactly as you described -<br/>
a lot of soul-searching and parents reaching out to their daughter.  I never<br/>
knew this about that show - the way Roseanne&#39;s voice sounded always put me<br/>
off, so I&#39;ve never really watched it.  I’m inspired to go check it out and<br/>
see what I missed!  Thanks for pointing that out.<br/>
