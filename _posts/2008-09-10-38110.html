<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399254350">This is fascinating ... I learned so much about particle physics <br/>
listening to this song!  And I didn&#39;t even know that it was such an  <br/>
interesting subject.<br/>

Thought I&#39;d pass it along for anyone who has always wanted to <br/>
understand the basics of particle physics but didn&#39;t want to have to <br/>
read an entire textbook &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am often behind on these things so I may be posting old news.  If so, <br/>
sorry in advance.<br/>

As it turns out, my dh & I were going out last night and were looking for<br/>
something to do. And I found this in the newspaper:<br/>
<br/>
From the Big Bang to Dark Matter: Turning on the Large Hadron Collider<br/>
<br/>
On September 10th, the Large Hadron Collider will begin operation by<br/>
sending a beam of sub-atomic particles around a 17-mile underground<br/>
tunnel beneath the boundary of France and Switzerland. Ultimately the<br/>
experiment will provide fundamental discoveries about our universe.<br/>
Come hear University of Arizona physicists discuss their participation<br/>
in the historic experiment and explain how the world&#39;s largest<br/>
scientific instrument will reveal secrets about our world. Lecture by<br/>
Elliott Cheu Associate Dean of UA&#39;s College of Science, UA Professor<br/>
of Physics, and member of the Large Hadron Collider-ATLAS team<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we  went and learned fascinating stuff about the universe and the<br/>
questions they are hoping to answer with the collider.<br/>
The collider might even be able to create microscopic black holes!<br/>
Or not.  It sounds like some really basic questions about the universe might<br/>
get answers within the next year or so...<br/>
<br/>
Elliot Cheu concluded the lecture by showing this very video!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101422544">i didn&#39;t see if anyone responded to this, but apparently several scientists tried to prevent this from happening because of the (small) chance that it could actually cause the end of the universe as we know it! lol!<br/>
