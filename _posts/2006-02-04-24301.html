<div id="ygrps-yiv-532608070">I want to share something that happened with my teen because I don&#39;t think it is typical of schooled kids.  We had a combo of family and friends over one evening and we were playing one of those &#39;how well do you know somebody games&#39;, I can&#39;t remember the name, but you try to predict how another person will answer a question.  MY 18 yr old daughter got the question &quot;Who would you consider person of the year?&quot;  Nobody guessed her answer, she said &quot;My Momma!, She helps me with more stuff than anybody.&quot;  I don&#39;t think too many teens would say that in front of a group of people.  It is one of those moments I will still remember if I make it to be a 100.  <br/>
  As a side encouragement to others, I didn&#39;t start homschooling her until she was 9, started unschooling at 11. So even if you didn&#39;t get an early start, unschooling will still allow you to have an awesome relationship with your teen.  I consider her one of my best friends.<br/>
