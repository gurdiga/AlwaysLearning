<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924596004">Adriane and I just got back from the State Fair in Dallas.  We both showed<br/>
our dairy goats.  (I got a first place and Adriane got a second)  Dairy goat<br/>
farmers travel cheap so most everybody was just sleeping in the barn, in the<br/>
areas where animals are washed.  It was not uncommon to see someone sleeping<br/>
on a cot next to someone washing their goat next to a teenaged girl shaving<br/>
her legs.  We were there for 4 days.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane and I hung out, rode the giant Ferris Wheel, got blisters from<br/>
walking so much, saw Alan Jackson perform (Adriane couldn&#39;t see so she rode<br/>
me piggy-back in the crowd.  She&#39;s eleven and her feet almost dragged the<br/>
ground.), had a great visit with Adriane&#39;s birthmother, saw the giant<br/>
sculpture made out of butter, and got very little sleep.  We met some really<br/>
wonderful people and had a ball.  Can&#39;t wait until January and we go to the<br/>
next big show.<br/>

Holly just mentioned butter sculptures yesterday.  <br/>
She saw one at the state fair here!  <br/>
It was of a guy on a horse with a donkey next to the horse (I&#39;m typing what <br/>
she&#39;s saying).<br/>
<br/>
Taller than she is, she says.<br/>
