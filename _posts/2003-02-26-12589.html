<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826452444">Thank you, Joanna.  I hadn&#39;t known what happened and was afraid to ask.  <br/>
I&#39;m so bad at keeping people, kids and lists straight and separate, and I <br/>
know there are a few kids amongst the unschooling folks with terminal <br/>
diseases and dangerous conditions, and I just kept my trap shut at the time <br/>
the notice was posted.  <br/>
<br/>
To others, the photo of Sam and his family is on the second page of photos at <br/>
the Always Learning home page at yahoo groups, end of the third row.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the post Elissa sent last month:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For those of you who know Joanna Wilkinson, Her son Sam passed away <br/>
<br/>
this weekend. <br/>
