<div id="ygrps-yiv-188644434">We had our first outing today since begining our new parenting style<br/>
and i wasn&#39;t sure what to do. My kids like to run, be loud, and not<br/>

helping shop and pick out foods but that only worked part of the time.<br/>
And i did take them out to the car instead of making them stand in<br/>

<br/>
Giving children choices isn&#39;t the same as saying &quot;If he wants an  <br/>
airplane, buy him one.  If he wants to fly it without a license, let  <br/>
him! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Find happy, possible choices and offer them to your child smilingly,  <br/>
joyfully.  Don&#39;t make up &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; but don&#39;t ignore the ones that  <br/>
are imposed from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
If you &quot;have to&quot; wear shoes in a restaurant, it means that&#39;s a  <br/>
condition of staying in the restaurant.  If you CHOOSE to be in the  <br/>
restaurant, then you choose to abide by their requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t replace an old rule you didn&#39;t think about carefully with a new  <br/>
rule you didn&#39;t think about carefully.<br/>

Seriously. Do they have to go? Do they want to go?<br/>
Can your significant other do the shopping? Mine does<br/>
and I will love him forever for it.<br/>
<br/>
I can see why kids love to run and be loud in grocery<br/>
stores, all those lines asiles....if only those other<br/>
folks would stay out of the way.<br/>
But the other folks are there and the store owners<br/>
expect you to act a certain way at their business.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is just best, for awhile, to avoid the<br/>
situations that kids find hard to maintain a certain<br/>
level of behavior. At times it is just a matter of age<br/>
and in a few months or a year they can handle it<br/>
better.<br/>

I think it goes against the principle of treating others kindly to let<br/>
kids run wild through a store!! We aren&#39;t doing our children any<br/>
favors if we don&#39;t help them figure out etiquette and respect for the<br/>
common good in public places.<br/>
<br/>
If my children can&#39;t handle shopping, I don&#39;t take them. Freedom is a<br/>
lot more than doing whatever you want, whenever you want. Constraint<br/>
and creative solutions are GOOD. Real life offers real limitations<br/>
that are sometimes for the common good. Helping children work within<br/>
those real limitations is better than letting them run wild where it<br/>
isn&#39;t appropriate!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366467279">Well, I didn&#39;t like just leaving my kids home, because I thought they  <br/>
would enjoy practicing, and I like spending time with them. Because  <br/>
my daughter has autism, we needed to get lots of little trips in  <br/>
because I didn&#39;t know if she would be able to go shopping without  <br/>
work.   We did, out of necessity, plan short trips. We did LOTS of  <br/>
rewards.  We go shopping probably four times a week for groceries  <br/>
(granted it takes a lot to feed us all), and we always talk about  <br/>
what we need before we go, they have lots of input on what we buy,  <br/>
and they have lots of input about timing. If the kids have lots of  <br/>
energy, we don&#39;t go then, we go to a park first. If they are too  <br/>
tired, we cancel altogether and dh or I go after he gets home from work.<br/>
<br/>
Take them late at night. Or early in the am. I like to go around 7am  <br/>
with the kids, there&#39;s no one there except the workers or ol&#39; folks,  <br/>
both of whom pretty much don&#39;t care. I do expect the kids to stay  <br/>
where they can see me, for safety reasons and for convenience (it  <br/>
takes too long trying to find people over and over).<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I both like to go for short trips, and take one kid with us.  <br/>
We pick up two or three things, buy a soda, and sit on the curb and  <br/>
talk. It&#39;s a cheap and easy date, and gives them one on one in a  <br/>
store so that they have your full attention, they get to practice,  <br/>
and they are learning how people act and how to buy stuff.<br/>

need time to be ready to learn those limitations. They<br/>
will learn about limitations, personal space and<br/>
things like that in other ways.<br/>
It also helps if they actually want to be at the store<br/>
or &quot;have to&quot; go.<br/>
When my 14 yr old was little he did not want to go to<br/>
the grochery store or even on short trips &quot;to town&quot;,<br/>
he still avoids shopping unless he has a reason to go.<br/>
I had the option of going without him OR sending my dh<br/>
to do the shopping.<br/>

cream after, or pack cold stuff in a cooler and stop at the park-- not as a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t remember offhand how old your kids are, or how many you&#39;re  <br/>
trying to shop with. I shop with two, ages 5 & 2, and we always have  <br/>
a great time. Some of the reason for that is that my kids have  <br/>
patient, easy-going temperaments, and so do I most days &lt;g&gt;. Some  <br/>
things we do that help it go smoothly:<br/>
<br/>
We usually have snacks in the cart. They like to get a bagel or a  <br/>
croissant at the bakery on the way in, or a box of animal cookies in  <br/>
the cookie aisle.<br/>
<br/>
I talk out loud to them a lot about what I&#39;m doing, what I&#39;m buying  <br/>
and why, what meals we&#39;re going to fix with it, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
We play games. They count down to blast-off every time we have to  <br/>
move the cart; they pretend to be firefighters leaping onto the cart  <br/>
to go fight a fire; if the aisle is empty, I jog a little and run in  <br/>
a serpentine pattern, saying, &quot;Oh, no, we&#39;re out of control! What  <br/>
will become of us? Aaaah!&quot; Stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
I bring new books from the library to look at in the cart (our  <br/>
grocery store has carts with two-kid benches attached that they  <br/>
really like to ride on), or their magnetic slates. Sometimes lately  <br/>
we jog quickly through the toy aisle on the way in and get something  <br/>
in the $2-5 range, like a matchbox car or small Lego toy that they  <br/>
can play with while we shop.<br/>
<br/>
I do wonder what will happen when 5 yo Eric is older and these games  <br/>
don&#39;t entertain him, but maybe by then he&#39;ll be able to actively help  <br/>
with the shopping, or choose to stay home (my partner works full-time  <br/>
from home).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The other piece of this for me is that often the behaviors that tempt  <br/>
me to punish Eric are behaviors that he really is not in control of.  <br/>
He&#39;s a great kid who wants to do what&#39;s right and has a lot of  <br/>
respect for other people but he is sometimes too tired, too hungry,  <br/>
too over-wrought, or, recently for a period of several months,  <br/>
apparently going through some kind of mysterious developmental  <br/>
process we don&#39;t understand. As hard as his behavior has been for me  <br/>
during that period, there&#39;s no point in punishing because if he could  <br/>
control himself, he would!<br/>

&gt; home would just stunt their learning sooner.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have left places when we needed to, if Eric was unable to behave  <br/>
appropriately. We try not to be punitive or blaming about it, just &quot;I  <br/>
see that you are not able to stay in your seat. I&#39;m going to take you  <br/>
outside while Mama gets our food packed up and pays the bill,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll come back and spend more time at the library another day.&quot; I  <br/>
think it does feel punitive to him, nonetheless, at least sometimes,  <br/>
but we try to be matter-of-fact and not lecture.<br/>
<br/>
Grocery shopping is a high-stress errand. It takes a long time, it&#39;s  <br/>
hard to cut the trip short if necessary, the artificial lights start  <br/>
to get to some people after awhile, the store is often full of cranky  <br/>
people, and there are never enough registers open. If doing the  <br/>
grocery shopping is too hard for a family, there are lots of other,  <br/>
less stressful, opportunities for kids to learn how to behave in  <br/>
public. A quick trip into a convenience store, the bakery, the  <br/>
library, the copy shop, the post office--those are all chances for  <br/>
kids to practice behaving appropriately without having to maintain  <br/>
that behavior for a very long time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, with Eric, sometimes there is something he&#39;s not ready for, and  <br/>
no amount of practice will help him get it. An example of this is  <br/>
lying back in the chair and staying there with his mouth open for a  <br/>
whole dental cleaning. At his cleaning when he had just turned four,  <br/>
he was alarmed by being asked to recline; every time the hygienist  <br/>
stopped for a moment to get a different instrument, he closed his  <br/>
mouth and tried to climb down; and ultimately he did not get a  <br/>
complete cleaning because it was being too stressful for him and we  <br/>
weren&#39;t going to get through it without getting more coercive than  <br/>
the situation called for. Six months later? He hopped into the chair,  <br/>
lay back with his feet casually crossed, opened his mouth, and just  <br/>
lay there looking relaxed while the hygienist did a very thorough  <br/>
cleaning and checked his teeth. The difference wasn&#39;t that he&#39;d been  <br/>
to the dentist a lot in between and learned how to behave there; the  <br/>
difference was the dramatic difference in development between &quot;just  <br/>
barely four&quot; and &quot;almost five.&quot;<br/>

If they can&#39;t behave within certain bounds, they can&#39;t go to stores.   <br/>
The store won&#39;t let them stay.  That&#39;s as true of adults as of children.<br/>
<br/>
Informing and advising them, creating an atmosphere between you and  <br/>
then so that they know what&#39;s expected and aren&#39;t feeling held down  <br/>

you, or not making suggestions.  For one thing, it&#39;s Easter and lots  <br/>

Some people here have experienced moving from punishments to other  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s about helping them know WHY people behave certain ways.  When I  <br/>
put the cart back at the grocery store after I use it, it&#39;s not  <br/>
because I thing I&#39;ll be yelled at or spanked. It&#39;s because I feel  <br/>
better when I do that. It seems   a better thing to do than to leave  <br/>
it where it might roll away or be in someone&#39;s way.  If it&#39;s really  <br/>
cold, or if one of the cart-returning workers is out there, I might  <br/>
leave it near the car, especially if I can indicate to them that I&#39;m  <br/>
leaving it and make some friendly gesture.  We live a few hundred  <br/>
yards from a store, and some neighbor of ours rudely takes a cart  <br/>
past our house and leave it. Sometimes I&#39;ve walked it back over  <br/>
there, or Marty has taken it when he goes to work there.  I don&#39;t do  <br/>
it to teach my kids to do it, I do it because walking is fun or I  <br/>
feel like it, or I need to go to the store anyway so I might as well  <br/>
take it back.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re out walking we pick up trash we find.  Not every piece, in  <br/>
a really trashy place, but few pieces  in a very clean place, or  <br/>
where kids are likely to play.  I did it before I had kids, I did it  <br/>
when they were babies and toddlers and would say why I was doing it  <br/>
while I was doing it, and I see them do it now when they don&#39;t know  <br/>
I&#39;m looking.<br/>
<br/>
What kids see affects them.  If they have high regard for the  <br/>
reasoning or the individuals they&#39;ll be more likely to emulate them.   <br/>
If they have low regard, they might avoid that behavior themselves.   <br/>
There are other kinds of factors that make people do or not do what  <br/>
they&#39;ve seen others do, and individual temperaments, but setting an  <br/>
example and explaining (briefly, not in lectures) why you&#39;re going to  <br/>
pick up broken glass that&#39;s under a slide helps them figure out the  <br/>
world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755412310">Okay, noted! ;-)<br/>
You&#39;re right, I did not phrase that appropriately. We did shop. I  <br/>
just planned on not buying a months worth of groceries at once. The  <br/>
short trips give them experience for handling a trip in which we  <br/>
might stay longer or attempt to buy more groceries. So not practice,  <br/>
per se, but gaining tools through MY compromise. Dh and I (and Josh  <br/>
too, when it was just the three of us) honestly would go buy a  <br/>
months&#39; worth of groceries in one three hour spree. I learned to let  <br/>
that go in the greater interest of family unity and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to rewrite the reward phrase too. I did not reward in the  <br/>
traditional negative sense as in &quot;Good girl..here&#39;s a biscuit&quot;, but  <br/>
rather more like &quot;Wow, we did great, I think we need to celebrate&quot;,  <br/>
or &quot;We had some trouble and feel crummy, let&#39;s go celebrate&quot;. :-P<br/>

I&#39;d go 3 times a week so it would be short trips cos kids under 5 get bored. And when they get bored, mine would get loud and often naked. Many times I turned around to find 3 naked toddlers behind me. Its funny now of course!<br/>
  Now I tend to go alone cos Celyn hates supermarkets. Something to do with the lighting I guess? She&#39;s ok if DH comes and he carries her but she refuses to be calm in her wheelchair while I push that and pull the trolley (cart) so i don&#39;t take her anymore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858251173"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It seems to me that leaving them at home would just stunt their<br/>
&gt; learning sooner.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Julie.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to think that children <br/>
are ready for limitations at all ages.  There is a big difference <br/>
between a 5 yr. old and a 12 yr. old, for example.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd13 (almost 14) is sometimes embarrassed by the way my dd8 <br/>
behaves.  The ironic thing is that they are like 2 peas in a pod!!  <br/>
My dd8&#39;s behavior is the same way my older daughter behaved when she <br/>
was this age.  When I try to explain that, my teenager looks at me <br/>
like I have 2 heads!  To her, she&#39;s always been cool.  KWIM?  She <br/>
can&#39;t fathom that she ever acted silly or immature.  *laugh*  <br/>
<br/>
If you have to take them to the store, I like the idea of taking <br/>
them early early in the morning or late at night when the store <br/>
isn&#39;t as crowded.  That could be a solution.<br/>
<br/>
I have always done most of my grocery shopping alone, at night, <br/>
after dinner.  *I* actually prefer the less-crowded atmosphere and <br/>
my children have always been happy to stay home.  Sometimes they <br/>
decide to go with me, but it&#39;s because they have something special <br/>
in mind, and they are always well behaved.  For example, my ds9 <br/>
loves to push the grocery cart while I fill it up.  He also likes to <br/>
empty the cart onto the conveyor belt.  And he really likes to go to <br/>
the store when I am shopping for only a few items because then we <br/>
use the self-help lanes and ring up our own purchases.  I can assure <br/>
you that when they were younger, they didn&#39;t understand public <br/>
ettiquette as much and were loud or ran around.  Now they don&#39;t do <br/>
that.  If they did, I&#39;d simply shop alone, leaving them at home <br/>
where they can be loud and run around without bothering people or <br/>
possibly causing damage to anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765269432">&quot;I guess i&#39;m really just wondering<br/>
how you teach them to respect boundries outside the home that they<br/>
don&#39;t really seem to care about. It seems to me that leaving them at<br/>

<br/>
A child that is hanging out with someone at home, happily is not going<br/>
to have any learning stunted. A child that can&#39;t behave appropriately<br/>
in a certain public place at 3 years old, is probably going to be just<br/>
fine at 12.<br/>
Kids don&#39;t need to learn all about various public places by any<br/>
certain age, nor do they need to learn from a grocery store at<br/>
all....though we&#39;ve had lotsa fun and learning there. Not visiting a<br/>
grocery store for a few years won&#39;t hurt their learning on any level.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, you could find ways to help them visit the grocery store if they<br/>
like it. I try to do shorter trips with Jalen (who is now five) or<br/>
take him there alone and go at his pace. I&#39;ve asked Markus to put on a<br/>
good movie or otherwish distract Jalen so I could go without him too.<br/>
His learning isn&#39;t stunted a bit.:)<br/>
<br/>
Exposing kids to the world, doesn&#39;t mean we have to do it by any<br/>
certain age, nor do we need to worry that their learning is stunted by<br/>
avoiding certain places that just don&#39;t work very well yet.<br/>

need to set up situations in which the odds for success are high.<br/>

I don&#39;t know the ages of your children, but if they&#39;re very little,<br/>
home is a wonderful place for them. I think we undervalue the<br/>
importance of wee people SLOWLY working into outings and public venues<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278105414"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; It occured to me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  last night that if punishment worked we wouldn&#39;t need to continue to<br/>
  do it. We would punish children and then they would never to that<br/>
  thing again they got punished for. That&#39;s not the way it works out.<br/>
  Therefore the method isn&#39;t effective. Seems like simple logic, i can&#39;t<br/>
  believe i didn&#39;t realize it sooner.  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s some people that never figure it out.  My SIL was giving me<br/>
parenting advice when my oldest was about three.  She was telling how there<br/>
were several years that it seemed like her son &quot;needed a spanking&quot; everyday.<br/>
She told me how she had to be diligent and consistent to make sure he got<br/>
what he needed.  I remembered at the time thinking there was a big problem<br/>
with their parenting methods - something wasn&#39;t working.  She never did<br/>
learn.  Did the same thing with all four of her children.  My husband<br/>
finally quit playing board games with this boy (he was a teen at the time)<br/>
because he cheated - and his father&#39;s a minister!  Your children are<br/>
fortunate you realized it now - earlier is better but now is way much better<br/>
than later.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for grocery stores, I have 5 yr. old twins.  When I go grocery shopping,<br/>
I&#39;m usually intent on getting the best deals, comparing prices, etc.  I shop<br/>
for a family of seven so I need to be careful.  I don&#39;t have the time to<br/>
give my twins when I&#39;m shopping like that.  What we do is make special trips<br/>
just for them at other times.  I usually never take them together unless my<br/>
husband is with me.  But we take them individually.  One thing they love to<br/>
do is go to a Dollar Store and then they get to pick out a few items while<br/>
oohing and aahing up and down all the aisles.  Lots of fun for them, and<br/>
when I only have one I can follow her and let her take the lead.  If I had<br/>
both, I would have to hold one back and there would probably be tears.  You<br/>
might try making special trips with them individually when you can give them<br/>
your attention.  It&#39;s actually a lot of fun - wouldn&#39;t be so much fun during<br/>
a &#39;for real&#39; grocery store trip.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94411530">here&#39;s my .02 on grocery shopping:<br/>
<br/>
Lilith, it sounds like it didn&#39;t go too badly!<br/>
celebrate that! public situations are different than<br/>
private ones, in some ways, that&#39;s true. over time the<br/>
guiding principles of how you&#39;re approaching life will<br/>
permeate your thinking (and your kids&#39; thinking) and<br/>
you won&#39;t have to consciously figure out every single<br/>
thing anew. <br/>
<br/>
my ds (3) is and always has been very energetic. he<br/>
now refuses to stay in the cart. something that really<br/>
helps him which may help your kids too (4 and 7,<br/>
aren&#39;t they? or have I got yours confused with someone<br/>
else?) is I tell ds *in the car, right before we go<br/>
in* exactly what we&#39;re doing and what to expect, and<br/>
what I expect. he won&#39;t remember if I tell him sooner.<br/>
sometimes I tell him as we&#39;re driving too, but<br/>
*always* right before we get out of the car to go in<br/>
the store. the only &quot;rule&quot; for lack of a better word<br/>
is that I need him to stay close to me. he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to stay glued to my bum, but in the same aisle so<br/>
I can see what he&#39;s doing, prevent accidents/<br/>
destruction of property (like toppling a display or<br/>
getting his hands all over the food in the bulk bins<br/>
or opening something I don&#39;t want to buy, all of which<br/>
we&#39;ve done lol), and have conversation with him. if<br/>
it&#39;s a day where I am in a rush, I tell him that<br/>
repeatedly before we go in and while we&#39;re in the<br/>
store. ex: we&#39;re stopping by the store for milk and<br/>
eggs and that&#39;s it, it&#39;s 5:30pm and I need to get back<br/>
to the house for dinner. normally when I have the time<br/>
we stop throughout the store and look at things, and<br/>
we stop at the matchbox cars and look at each one<br/>
until he decides which one to get (a decision that<br/>
cannot be rushed! lol). if we can&#39;t take that time<br/>
today, I tell him this and enlist his help in<br/>
remembering what we need to get. I have been very<br/>
surprised at his ability to remember what we need! I<br/>
continue to remind him (always gently) in the store<br/>
what we need and why we have to be fast (remember,<br/>
it&#39;s late and we have to get home to meet daddy, etc).<br/>
sometimes I can make a game out of being fast, too.<br/>
<br/>
also, ask your kids for ideas. tell them what needs to<br/>
be accomplished, both by the shopping and in terms of<br/>
being respectful of the store and other shoppers.<br/>
then, ask them for ideas to make it happen. would they<br/>
like to pick out a favorite snack food to eat in the<br/>
cart? I have no qualms about opening something in the<br/>
store that I know I intend to buy. there are plenty of<br/>
cheap toys in the grocery store here, too. it goes<br/>
against my environmental grain to get yet another<br/>
matchbox car every time we go, but it&#39;s part of ds&#39;s<br/>
ritual now and makes my shopping much easier. let them<br/>
know if you need to shop for a lot of stuff and it<br/>
might be a longish trip, if you think they might get<br/>
bored, etc. imo it doesn&#39;t &quot;put ideas in their heads&quot;<br/>
to acknowledge boredom if you see it; it seems to help<br/>
my ds deal with it if I help him name it.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with the post that asked whether they are<br/>
really being problematic for others. I have always<br/>
been pretty relaxed about ds&#39;s volume, but one day I<br/>
was wishing I could crawl under something when we were<br/>
in ingle&#39;s. I have no idea why, but he started a game<br/>
in which he would scream &quot;BUGGGSSS<br/>
BUNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!&quot; over and over, top of<br/>
his lungs, and then crack up hysterically. I was<br/>
beyond embarrassed and there was nothing I could do.<br/>
two women who were shopping together came by us in the<br/>
aisle and smiled at me. I shrugged and said &quot;I have no<br/>
idea!&quot; they said &quot;sounds like he&#39;s just being a kid!&quot;<br/>
and laughed. whew! after that I was much more relaxed<br/>
:) (the strangest thing about that was that he had<br/>
never heard of bugs bunny to my knowledge at that<br/>
time!)<br/>
<br/>
shorter trips or getting dh to do some are great too,<br/>
if you can make that work for you. I live pretty far<br/>
from everything and dh works so much that those<br/>
options are rarely feasible for me.<br/>
<br/>
hope this is useful!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574150596">I think I&#39;d laugh rather than find t embaressing. But thats just me.<br/>
  To be honest, if the volumne wasn&#39;t hurting people&#39;s ears or they weren&#39;t chucking things about I wouldn&#39;t worry about that sort of behaviour.<br/>
  Kids will be kids and sometimes grownups need to lighten up!<br/>
  Mine would sing or shout. the one thing i did explain to them probably wasn&#39;t polte was when we first moved to the States. They found the accent fascinating and used to meander around Target saying &#39;y&#39;all want fries with that.&#39;<br/>
  &lt;blush&gt;<br/>
  And that was in uptight north VA!<br/>
  But on the whole I think the problem more lies with what we as adults see an embaressing. We think every one is judging us on our kids behaviour and so we try and put a stop to watch is essentialy harmeless fun. And then we oppress our kids cos of all these perceptions.<br/>

As an example, a few months back we are shopping in Target for clothes<br/>

yelling &quot;Nipple, nipple!&quot; loudly back and forth to each other and<br/>
laughing about it, than to pick out their clothes. Now i have no<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The book dh and i have been reading titled Scream Free Parenting talks<br/>
a lot about learning not to feel responsible for all your children&#39;s<br/>
actions, as they are their own independent beings and everything they<br/>
do shouldn&#39;t reflect on you. I think that has helped me a bit with<br/>
feeling embaressed by their behavior, and i also try to keep in mind<br/>
that i shouldn&#39;t repress the natural urges of my children because i&#39;m<br/>
concerned what others think. What&#39;s really more important, having a<br/>
good image, or trying not to make your children feel rejected for<br/>
being who they are. These thoughts help me alot, but as i&#39;ve said, i<br/>
haven&#39;t perfected anything yet. It is more a journey than a<br/>
destination though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Marty was my runningest kid, but he was also pretty happy to stay in  <br/>
the cart.  If he was in the cart I would try to touch him a lot—play  <br/>
with his hands, put my hand on his back while I wasn&#39;t looking at  <br/>
him, etc.  That way he didn&#39;t feel ignored or alone.  He still had  <br/>
physical stuff going on.<br/>
<br/>
Whether he needed to stay really near me or not depended on the  <br/>
situation.  On a day when the store was really crowded or there was  <br/>
someone on crutches or otherwise frail looking, I&#39;d ask him to stay  <br/>
by me if they were near.   If the store was really pretty empty (we  <br/>
liked early weekday mornings lots), he could run back and forth in  <br/>
the aisle where I was, or go to the end and look around.  If I was in  <br/>
a frazzledy mood, I might say he could only get down if he stayed  <br/>
close enough to touch me or the cart.  If the deal is made in advance  <br/>
&quot;You can get out only if...&quot; then if he forgot, he&#39;d get in the cart  <br/>
without complaining because it was a deal he agreed to.  Maybe after  <br/>
another aisle or two I&#39;d let him try again (again, depending on who/ <br/>
what/when).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would forget, but I would try (still try) to avoid those  <br/>
times when it&#39;s very crowded.  If there are paydays around where you  <br/>
are, it&#39;s worth being aware of them.  Some places pay twice a month,  <br/>
and so there will be some 15ths or Fridays when LOTS and lots of  <br/>
people are shopping.    Food stamps, social security checks and  <br/>
veteran&#39;s benefits checks affect people here between the first and  <br/>
fifth of the month.   My sister works in a bank in Dulce, and on some  <br/>
Friday every month (third Friday or fourth?) everyone in the tribe  <br/>
gets a check.  That day and the next, the banks are swamped and the  <br/>
stores.<br/>
<br/>
We live near a big video rental store.  Sometimes I forget and go on  <br/>
a Friday.  Big mistake.  I can breeze in on a Thursday and have the  <br/>
store to myself when all the videos rented the weekend before have  <br/>
been returned.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s going to involve taking a child who might get bored, maybe  <br/>
add those factors to your checklist.<br/>

<br/>
I tell my kids it&#39;s not nice to make others feel uncomfortable.  That  <br/>
covers lots of things, and they started early on figuring out what  <br/>
kinds of things were &quot;cheating&quot; in shared spaces like theaters,  <br/>
stores, restaurants.  They were all games playing kids, so speaking  <br/>
in terms of taking turns and not messing up the game made sense to  <br/>
them.  Not sitting so close you could see other people&#39;s cards was  <br/>
kind of like giving people their space at restaurants.  Don&#39;t lean  <br/>
over and stare at their food, for instance.  It wouldn&#39;t be nice at a  <br/>
gaming table.<br/>
<br/>
So with an analogy or two you might avoid lots of lists of &quot;rules&quot; or  <br/>
things not to do.  The principle of sharing spaces politely pretty  <br/>
much covers it.<br/>

<br/>
I watch how parents handle it when their kids really are being  <br/>
disruptive (I&#39;m not talking about normal kidness, but screaming kids  <br/>
in a restaurant, kids running or jumping or playing with a ball in a  <br/>
grocery store where there are old people in the aisles. I always hope  <br/>
to see the parents respond by distracting or counseling a bit or  <br/>
taking the child out of the situation, but not being punitive. I  <br/>
don&#39;t blame the kids when they don&#39;t know appropriate behavior - but  <br/>
the adults in their lives aren&#39;t doing them a favor if they act like  <br/>
needlessly disrupting other people&#39;s business or pleasure is just  <br/>
absolutely fine.<br/>
