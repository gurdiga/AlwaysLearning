<div id="ygrps-yiv-934395116">...&gt;since I grew up in a family where junk food was a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;reward, and &#39;fun food&#39; was tightly controlled. <br/>
&gt;Breakfast was ALWAYS Total cereal on weekdays, we<br/>
&gt;were only allowed to eat Roman Meal bread, <br/>
&gt;and had to eat all our vegies (even things that made<br/>
&gt;us gag) and dessert was only for those who ate all<br/>
&gt;their dinner.  Until my sis and I reached our teens<br/>
&gt;and put on weight (from Dorito and Pizza at the<br/>
&gt;school snack bar) when dessert cancelled for us.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>...&gt;I guess my point in all this rambling is that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;controlling your kids&#39; diet leads to all kinds of<br/>
&gt;fall-out, much of it multi-generational.   <br/>
&gt;Sylvia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ewwwwww Sylvia.  Sounds definately scarring.  Around<br/>
here the kids eat whatever they want for breakfast:<br/>
leftover birthday cake, cereal, oatmeal, pickles,<br/>
fried eggs and honey cornbread are a sample of recent<br/>
choices.  It&#39;s the one meal a day when I will play<br/>
short order cook.  Since we&#39;re unschoolers, every day<br/>
is a &quot;weekday&quot; (a day in the week) right?<br/>
<br/>
The bulk of the day we graze, and I generally make<br/>
more food for myself than I can eat when I make a<br/>
lunch, as the kids &quot;forget&quot; to eat until they smell my<br/>
food cooking and then come howling into the kitchen<br/>
like ravenous wolves.  Dinner we encourage them to eat<br/>
with us and be social, but it&#39;s not &quot;required&quot; that<br/>
they do so.  If they run off with their food to watch<br/>
a movie, it&#39;s nice to have a quiet dinner with my<br/>
hubby once in a while!  We don&#39;t have any such thing<br/>
as &quot;dessert.&quot;  Sweets are for when you feel like it,<br/>
not some pre-specified time, nor as a reward for<br/>
eating things you don&#39;t like.  Nobody around here eats<br/>
things they don&#39;t like.  <br/>
<br/>
There are, unfortunately, some villianous foods in my<br/>
older son&#39;s mind, as eating them will probably kill<br/>
him.  But others of us eat those thigs and are careful<br/>
to clean up afterwards.  We don&#39;t have a lot of &quot;junk<br/>
food&quot; in the house, or food with no nutritional value.<br/>
 Even the potato chips we have in the house are yummy<br/>
and full of nutritional value (yeah! Terra Chips!) <br/>
They do have a treat jar, which they fill with<br/>
whatever they want each time we go shopping and eat at<br/>
whatever pace they want.  It&#39;s usually never empty. <br/>
The cookie jar is the same way, which they have free<br/>
access to.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a son who has a tendancy to be sugar addicted,<br/>
and has impulse control problems.  So it&#39;s not like I<br/>
have stepford kids and this is just a cakewalk (food<br/>
pun intended) with my particular kids, to have them<br/>
not eating sweets all day.  If Thomas gets hungry he<br/>
will ALWAYS go for the sugary stuff first.  What I try<br/>
to do is head him off.  I will cook up some of his<br/>
favorite things (he loves hot foods) and offer them to<br/>
him when I think he might be hungry, and that prevents<br/>
him from wating to go for the sugar.  If I make<br/>
something and put it in from of him, he will usually<br/>
eat it.  If I am not in time and he is wanting to<br/>
gorge on the cookie jar or something, then I just make<br/>
the food anyway and offer it to him as well, and he<br/>
usually eats it and cuts short his sugar binge.  I<br/>
also talk to him about how he feels when he eats<br/>
certain things and he forms opinions about which ways<br/>
he doesn&#39;t like to feel.<br/>
