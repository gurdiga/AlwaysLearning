<div id="ygrps-yiv-593922155">&lt;&lt;a family-wide passion for the homeschool theatre group&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aha! I’ve asked about other homeschool theater groups many times in the <br/>
past (on this list and others), and I don’t get much in the way of <br/>
replies. Now I’ve got a live one....<br/>
<br/>
We started Theatrix, homeschool community theater, in 1995 and have done <br/>
two shows a years (spring/fall) since then. We started with a cast of 12 <br/>
and an audience of 50 and this time (Pollyanna--opens in two weeks) we <br/>
have a cast of 42 and hope to have an audience near 1,000! It’s been <br/>
such an adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us about your group (and welcome. Laurel!).<br/>

<br/>
I know you weren&#39;t asking me, but I&#39;ll answer anyway &lt;g&gt;. We don&#39;t have a <br/>
regular company, but the group has been doing a show a year for the last <br/>
three years. This year, another theater mom and me decided to take it a <br/>
little easier - little did we know! - and do a weekly advanced scene study <br/>
class instead. We do a play a month, the kids read it before we start, we <br/>
cast scenes, then we direct them and they perform for each other on the <br/>
fourth week. We tried to make it so demanding that the group would stay small <br/>
- instead two more kids have joined. We&#39;ve done The Crucible, The Importance <br/>
of Being Earnest, The Miracle Worker, Our Town and now we&#39;re working on <br/>
Servant of Two Masters. We are having a blast!<br/>
<br/>
In June, we&#39;ll do a public performance of some scenes from each play. Any <br/>
good suggestions for next year&#39;s plays?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424553824">I&#39;d really like to start discussing homeschool theater, but we&#39;re just <br/>
days away from our opening of Pollyanna and I&#39;ve got 7.34 million things <br/>
to do. Of course, just when my life is at its most hectic, our toilet <br/>
overflows upstairs and causes...$30,000 worth of damage!!<br/>
<br/>
I came home to find it &quot;raining&quot; in the kitchen (through the recessed <br/>
lights). My daughter was downstairs in the basement and heard it, but <br/>
figured it was an outside sound. Both upstairs bathroom floors have to <br/>
be replaced, the wood floors downstairs have to be replaced (kitchen, <br/>
dinette, halls, mudroom, half-bath, front entry). Our kitchen cupboards <br/>
are in the garage (holes were punched in the walls to get to the <br/>
moisture behind them) and their contents are all over the living-room <br/>
and art room (formerly diningroom). The kitchen center island is in the <br/>
dinette. The dinette table and chairs are in the family room. We had <br/>
industrial fans going day and night for several days (like living with <br/>
an airplane engine on all the time).<br/>
<br/>
On top of all this, our oldest cat, Tiger, has just been diagnosed with <br/>
hyperthyroidism and is failing fast. I&#39;m having to make a decision in <br/>
the next day or two about euthanizing him. It&#39;s not just the thyroid <br/>
thing, but several other things that are unspecified. I&#39;ve already spent <br/>
a lot of money on tests and the vet says we need more to find out what&#39;s <br/>
going on--and then we might not have happy options. He&#39;s not really <br/>
eating how and my daughter and I are supposed to be hydrating him every <br/>
other day. (A needle in his back which introduces a lot of water <br/>
subcutaneously.) He HATED it the first time, although it made him feel <br/>
better. He&#39;s so weak that it feels cruel to make him suffer through <br/>
that. I want an island of quiet time to deal with this--to hold him and, <br/>
if we euthanize, to make a ceremony of it (the vet will come out). I&#39;ve <br/>
put the workmen on hold for a week, but I can&#39;t stop the play or my <br/>
involvement in it. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is still in Australia and knows nothing about the house <br/>
damage--what can he do from 10,000 miles away except worry? He&#39;s very <br/>
sad about Tiger, though, and says he thinks of him every day. It&#39;s so <br/>
sad that Tiger likely won&#39;t be here when Eric gets back.<br/>

<br/>
eeeeep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Susan&#39;s house.  It&#39;s really wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Our cheap, painted-baseboards house in the desert is not NEARLY as nice.<br/>
<br/>
So when our toilet overflowed and rained into Marty&#39;s room through the light <br/>
fixtures, and over the washing machine, that couldn&#39;t be $30,000 worth of <br/>
damage in any possible way.  But it was caught in about fifteen minutes, too. <br/>
 AND we&#39;re in the desert; it dried out.<br/>
<br/>
We had to take the carpet out of Marty&#39;s room, and under that was linoleum <br/>
tile he liked even better.  There&#39;s some ceiling damage over the washing <br/>
machine.  <br/>
<br/>
{{{{{{{{Susan}}}}}}}}<br/>
<br/>
That is so sad.  I hope maybe there&#39;s insurance to cover some of it.<br/>
<br/>
Our homeowner&#39;s insurance is probably just to pay for someone else slipping <br/>
on the very-occasional ice.  I never even thought of looking when that thing <br/>
overflowed last time, but for $30,000 I&#39;d certainly find out!!<br/>
<br/>
You certainly did not need that to happen.<br/>
