<br/>
We pretty much pick up other people&#39;s trash and try to live  <br/>
responsibly all year.<br/>
<br/>
We give each other presents throughout the year too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the very first Earth Day, I was on the plaza in Santa Fe hearing  <br/>
speeches.  I still have one of the green armbands they were passing out.<br/>
<br/>
On the second Earth Day, I helped lots of people from my local area  <br/>
(east side of Espanola) clean up near the Santa Cruz river, which at  <br/>
the time had a ford through it (cars drove through shallow running  <br/>
water  instead of on a bridge), and so it had gotten kind of junky  <br/>
around there.<br/>
