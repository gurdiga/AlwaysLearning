Hey, you can&#39;t use this list for private e-mail! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cameron wasn&#39;t wearing a man skirt.  It was a regular old skirt and  <br/>
they have them at the thrift stores near you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There will likely be photos of him among the many at the bottom of  <br/>
this page <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/abq">http://sandradodd.com/abq</a><br/>
<br/>
You might let your son know there&#39;s a construction company in which  <br/>
all the men wear work kilts and work that way.  It&#39;s in the U.S. but  <br/>
I forget where.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.skortman.com/">http://www.skortman.com/</a><br/>
There&#39;s a site that mentions skirts for boys.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.skortman.com/skortmanmainpage.html">http://www.skortman.com/skortmanmainpage.html</a><br/>
Because it&#39;s &quot;skort&quot; I&#39;m guessing they have a crotch too.  Holly has  <br/>
a couple of things like that and she really likes them.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a &quot;mini-kilts&quot; page.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to google you&#39;ll find LOTS and lots of pages of kilts and  <br/>
mens&#39; skirts.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours has a kilt he made of camouflage material.  He wore  <br/>
it to a wedding last year.  I should be able to find a photo of him  <br/>
in it, standing with Kirby...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a German site with lots of fashion photographs of guys in  <br/>
skirts of their design:<br/>

On their &quot;musicians&quot; link is a drummer in a skirt.  I guess it would  <br/>
be pretty nice for drummers (which Cameron Lovejoy is!)<br/>

We have lots of pictures of all my boys in skirts! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think Cam mostly wore a plain old &quot;girl-skirt&quot; at the conference last <br/>
year. I think he picked it up at a Goodwill store. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He does have two kilts. Both are from Scotland. Both are Dunlap (my <br/>
maiden name) clan---one&#39;s a dress tartan and the other&#39;s a hunting <br/>
tartan. Both are beautiful colors! (not all are! &lt;g&gt;) Ben wears the <br/>
Citadel tartan that my father bought from a friend whose son went to <br/>
the Citadel. Cam wore his kilt to Carly&#39;s prom last year. He had all <br/>
the fancy formal gear to go with it and looked sooo handsome! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cam also bought a third sarong at last year&#39;s conference from Red <br/>
Serpent Batiks---one of the vendors last year. She&#39;s coming back this <br/>
year too, I think. I borrow Cam&#39;s sarongs regularly! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think James Coburn wore a utilikilt---or something like that. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t a Scottish kilt like I&#39;m used to---it was something different. <br/>
Like a...well, utily kilt! &lt;g&gt; Cameron liked it.<br/>
<br/>
I like that Cameron is comfortable enough with himself to wear skirts. <br/>
Hell, I just like that he&#39;s comfortable with himself! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909048642">I wrote and thought about skirts and kilts.  I looked at websites.  I  <br/>
showed Kirby one.  I said &quot;You could totally pull this off.&quot;  I had  <br/>
been thinking earlier maybe Keith and Marty would like them, and  <br/>
thought &quot;Nah, they&#39;d be too self conscious.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I drove out to the post office and was by myself a while.<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized that most of today I was working on a new tunic for  <br/>
Keith to wear under his armor this weekend at a tournament where he  <br/>
and Marty will be...  and that Marty AND Keith wear not skirts, but  <br/>
dresses, basically. &lt;g&gt;   I asked Marty when I got home if he ever  <br/>
wore his tunics without pants and he said no, because most of his are  <br/>
kinda short.  But I KNOW Keith and Kirby have.  Kirby has a nice red  <br/>
full-skirted Viking tunic, and a nearly floor-length straighter one.   <br/>
I made them myself.<br/>
<br/>
But the names I used above were just for the benefit of readers  <br/>
here.  I was compartmentalizing my life, I guess, earlier today when  <br/>
was thinking that Keith, Kirby and Marty don&#39;t wear skirts.  But as  <br/>
Gunwaldt, Magnus and Bardolf they sure do!<br/>
<br/>
The diagram for wearing the full-skirted tunic is even on the SCA  <br/>
section of my webpage.   I had seen the diagram in a historical  <br/>
costume book put out in the 1930&#39;s or so that UNM used to have, and I  <br/>
photocopied that page and experimented with it until I got it to work  <br/>
really well, and I never saw anyone else in the SCA figure it out.   <br/>
In fact, when I showed it to someone once to correct something she  <br/>
was planning to do, she declared it simply something that wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
work.  Odd thing, since Keith and I both had been wearing them for  <br/>
years. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not recommending this for an everyday skirt for men in the 21st  <br/>
century, except at SCA events.  It&#39;s too early a period for  <br/>
Renfaires.  If you&#39;re putting on Hamlet, though consider this:   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/duckford/sewing">http://sandradodd.com/duckford/sewing</a>  (nearly to the bottom).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a photo of him in a long tunic, though not the total full- <br/>
skirted version, second photo here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/duckford/">http://sandradodd.com/duckford/</a> <br/>
gunwaldt and he&#39;s holding baby Holly.  Baby Asta.  (The upper photo  <br/>
isn&#39;t Viking costumes, that was for a different thing.)<br/>

photocopied that page and experimented with it until I got it to work<br/>
really well-=-<br/>
<br/>
I used diagram twice for two different things.  One was just a line  <br/>
drawing talking about how they thought early Germanic/Saxon/Viking  <br/>
men&#39;s clothes were cut or constructed.  One type of garment, anyway.   <br/>
And the other was the diagram I made that&#39;s on that page, which I  <br/>
drew up one night when we let a friend borrow one of Keith&#39;s big- <br/>
skirted tunics, and weren&#39;t going to be with him when he dressed.  He  <br/>
brought the paper back with the tunic and I saved it in case I&#39;d need  <br/>
it again.<br/>
<br/>
There are medieval paintings of men working in fields and cutting  <br/>
wood and their tunics (not as full as this, but with knee-length  <br/>
skirts) are tucked up into what seems like nothing.  In those days  <br/>
men didn&#39;t wear pants with a crotch.  I guess they had some kinda  <br/>
wrap (or not, but what looked like pants under those skirts were two  <br/>
tubes of cloth�hosen, or braes�and they tied to a belt that was  <br/>
inside.  Not a belt like we think of with a big buckle and all, but  <br/>
some kind of leather or cloth thing wrapped and tied around their  <br/>
waist or hips.  So the leggings were fastened to that.  And they  <br/>
could pull some of the skirt up so it was out of their way when they  <br/>
worked.  To them it would&#39;ve made perfect sense.  Then when they&#39;re  <br/>
through working, they just pull the skirt and it falls back down the  <br/>
right way.  It&#39;s kinda like pulling up sleeves or rolling up pants  <br/>
legs, or even now sometimes women wearing long dresses will pull them  <br/>
up and tie the on the side or something.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen people in the SCA do that either, but it&#39;s because  <br/>
they&#39;re wearing pants of one sort or another because the crotchless  <br/>
thing has a hard time taking hold in the minds of modern folk (for  <br/>
everyday wear).<br/>
