<br/>
If you change “servitude” (in which a person is stuck, and it’s a role he can’t get out of) to “service” (which is in every instance a voluntary gift), you might feel better immediately.<br/>
<br/>
People who think words don’t make any difference will be more unhappy than those who consider whether a simple change of terminology and thought can change their emotions and their vision of where and who they are, and what they’re doing, and why.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That page has some really nice things by lots of people.  The word “servitude” is used four times, usually saying it’s not that, but “service,” which is used 59 times.  <br/>
13 “serve”s<br/>
3 “serving”<br/>
<br/>
People who refuse to “serve” anyone because they don’t want to be “a servant” will probably end up divorced and unhappy (or the other way around).  <br/>
This is another example of the power or words and emotions, and the problems with languages.  This might be an English-language problem that doesn’t bother people who are speaking another language.    But among English speakers, it can ruin relationships.<br/>
<br/>
“Servitude” is not something to be joyful about.<br/>
Doing kind things voluntarily for people you love CAN lead to joy.<br/>
Forget “servitude.&quot;<br/>

This doesn&#39;t need to be a full time job. It&#39;s big and little things here and there. It&#39;s turning on a light when someone&#39;s reading in the dark. It&#39;s taking a child to the midnight show of the new Star Wars.

That&#39;s your own expectation.

You might ask your husband for a night off so you can go relax in a bookstore. But the more you can find your family fulfilling, the less time you&#39;ll need away from them. But first you need to stop doing the stuff you feel is necessary to be of service and look honestly at what they really need.&nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-912840921"><br class="ygrps-yiv-912840921"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-912840921">*** I try to look at it as servitude ***</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-912840921"><br class="ygrps-yiv-912840921"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-912840921">Please don&#39;t.

But you&#39;ve put too much into the &quot;service&quot; column. Your family will still be happy if you remove a lot of the Two&#39;s from the list. See what your family wants and needs. Then see anything extra beyond that as what you want to give. Those are separate and a *choice* for you.
