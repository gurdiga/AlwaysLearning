<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918286039">Hey all<br/>
I have some thoughts running around here, and would like some <br/>
feedback.  I  hope it doesn&#39;t sound too much like babble.<br/>
<br/>
I live across the street from a school.  Today, I was listening to <br/>
the happy sounds of kids playing, and then a loud bell went off, and <br/>
all the happy sounds drifted away.  I don&#39;t know why, but that makes <br/>
me so nuts!   I try to explain to my little ones why I don&#39;t want <br/>
them to go to school, but I have such a hard time doing it without <br/>
being negative about school, rather than telling them all the <br/>
positive reasons I have for keeping them here. <br/>
<br/>
Am I  brainwashing them with my comments like &quot;Oh look at those poor <br/>
kids cooped up in school all day!&quot; or &quot;Isn&#39;t it bizarre when those <br/>
kids march around in lines?&quot;  Some days it just seems harmless <br/>
enough (although it can make for awkward conversations with schooled <br/>
friends, ha ha).  Today, though, I am wondering about it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know, maybe those horrible bells going off all day are making me <br/>
crazy!   <br/>

their agemates will still enjoy school.  If they are older, it may be the<br/>
public school kids themselves who convince yours how good homeschooling is.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard more than one &quot;You are SO lucky!&quot; directed my kids&#39; way &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your kids are asking about going to school, I think it&#39;s fair to give<br/>
them the facts of what goes on there (you sort of have to, as they have<br/>
Barney and those of their friends who don&#39;t yet hate school and possibly<br/>
your relatives or others praising it).<br/>
<br/>
When Brit was asking about school a couple of years ago, I told her, &quot;You&#39;d<br/>
need to go to bed much earlier than you do and get up much earlier than you<br/>
do. You&#39;d have to do what the teacher told you to do every day, for hours,<br/>
instead of deciding what you wanted to do for yourself. You&#39;d have to ask if<br/>
you wanted to go to the bathroom, and they might make you wait. You&#39;d have<br/>
to wait to eat at a certain time when they told you to, not when you wanted<br/>
to.&quot; Etc.<br/>

preschool.  Or what about having a little co-op with people you know<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747539212">When we&#39;re out early in the mornings we see tons of kids (elementary age<br/>
mostly) out waiting for the bus.  NONE of these kids look happy or excited<br/>
about going to school.  The other weird thing is that when we pass a school,<br/>
the buses are parked right out in front, kids trapped inside. NO ONE is<br/>
playing on the playground (which, btw, is a really nice big brand new one<br/>
they just put in when they expanded the school).  What the  heck is up with<br/>
that?<br/>
