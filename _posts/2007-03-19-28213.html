<div id="ygrps-yiv-676870726">I just received this by e-mail and I don&#39;t appreciate it:<br/>
<br/>
Am I wrong to hear the blunt crudeness to your voice? I mean no  <br/>
disrespect, I&#39;m sure you have a lot of experience in which I may find  <br/>
helpful to glean from, but I don&#39;t think it kind to respond so coldly  <br/>
to people who are here with an attitude of respect and trust with the  <br/>
issues they are facing while attempting to unschool their children.  <br/>
You may find it strengthening to your own ego to make others feel  <br/>
subservient to you, but I find it quite disrespectful & unnerving. I  <br/>
am sure there are many people who belong to this group who could  <br/>
bless you with the information and perspectives they have. Perhaps  <br/>
you should treat others here as you strive to encourage us to treat  <br/>
our children. I also think it quite interesting that you pick  <br/>
people&#39;s words apart so as to support the advice you then add. I am  <br/>
open to any suggestions, advice, whatever and I do agree with some of  <br/>
what you wrote, but I thought it necessary to let you know that you  <br/>
may know a bit about unschooling but you have a lot to learn about  <br/>
public relations & human kindness. I suppose you are not here to make  <br/>
anyone happy and that is fine, but a little  gentleness never hurt  <br/>
anyone. I am not posting this publicly but I know there are others  <br/>
who feel this same way. If you feel me so offensive feel free to  <br/>
discontinue my membership, otherwise I hope to add my own soul to the  <br/>
topics i choose to write or reply to.<br/>
<br/>
======================================<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve deleted the original and I won&#39;t even remember who it was, but I  <br/>
will say again that I don&#39;t like what basically amounts to following  <br/>
someone home from a public meeting and attacking them on their own  <br/>
porch.  If people have comments about this list, make them &quot;during  <br/>
the meeiing.&quot;  If the person who wrote that wants to continue on the  <br/>
list, then great--I won&#39;t remember later how tacky this was.  Truly;  <br/>
I forget.<br/>
<br/>
If there are people who can help people get to unschooling better  <br/>
than I can, go where they are.  Take everyone with you. I&#39;m helping  <br/>
for free and because I want to.  Nobody gets a refund; nobody paid a  <br/>
dollar to join this list.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what happens when people can accept criticism, when people  <br/>
are willing and eager to do better for their children:<br/>

<br/>
As to what happens when they don&#39;t really care, you can find examples  <br/>
without end all around you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Perhaps you should treat others here as you strive to encourage us  <br/>
to treat our children.-=-<br/>
<br/>
No.  I treat my children as I think you should treat your children.   <br/>
Those who have met my children aren&#39;t encouraging me to tell other  <br/>
parents to take their time deciding whether to move toward  <br/>
unschooling.  I gave my children years and years of peace to learn  <br/>
how to read.  If I wait years and years for parents to gradually move  <br/>
toward unschooling, they won&#39;t get there while their children are  <br/>
still young enough.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t want to help people attempt to unschool.<br/>
I want to help people unschool.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not cold for me to help parents to transfer their respect and  <br/>
trust directly to the  core being of their children.<br/>
It would be cold of me not to.<br/>

<br/>
Uh.... WHAT!?  Subservient!?  Is anyone washing my car or doing my  <br/>
dishes?<br/>
<br/>
My ego is strong because my children are happy and whole.<br/>
My ego is strong because people who know me in person trust me,  <br/>
because when they see my family and meet me and talk with me, they  <br/>
know I&#39;m not being dishonest in the least about what I say will help  <br/>
unschooling work.  I&#39;m not dodging, I&#39;m not bullshitting, I&#39;m not  <br/>
writing or speaking to strengthen my own ego.  I could stay home  <br/>
forevermore and suffer no loss of confidence.  I could never write  <br/>
another word, and what&#39;s here would be sufficient:<br/>

<br/>
-=-I<br/>
am sure there are many people who belong to this group who could<br/>
bless you with the information and perspectives they have. -=-<br/>
<br/>
And they have.  And they will continue to do so.  So have hundreds or  <br/>
thousands of other parents since the time I had Kirby and went to La  <br/>
Leche League and learned from other parents who were sharing their  <br/>
time and energy freely and generously for the good of Kirby Dodd, not  <br/>
for *MY* personal good.  That link up above has enough writing by  <br/>
people besides me that one could read for a week, ignoring anything I  <br/>
wrote myself, and still be reading.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also think it quite interesting that you pick<br/>
people&#39;s words apart so as to support the advice you then add.-=-<br/>
<br/>
?<br/>
If someone wants and needs advice, one should take free advice  <br/>
graciously and not direct someone as to how it should have been  <br/>
presented.<br/>
<br/>
When someone posts in public and by that posting reveals things she  <br/>
hadn&#39;t even seen herself, it is a HUGE and priceless kindness of  <br/>
others to be willing to hold up the mirror and say &quot;Wait.... look.&quot;    <br/>
You could go to a counselor and pay $90 a week for years and not get  <br/>
what you can get on this list in a week.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I thought it necessary to let you know that you<br/>
may know a bit about unschooling but you have a lot to learn about<br/>
public relations & human kindness.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Necessary?  Very often people accuse others of the thing of which  <br/>
they themselves are guilty.  &quot;<br/>
Some parents find it necessary to belittle their children.  It&#39;s  <br/>
very, very bad for unschooling for them to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I may know a little bit about unschooling and I may know a lot.<br/>
I DO know a lot about keeping a discussion list healthy for many years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I suppose you are not here to make<br/>

anyone.-=-<br/>
<br/>
A little gentleness will hurt when women sooth and coo instead of  <br/>
saying &quot;this isn&#39;t going to help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I AM  here to make people happy.  I&#39;m here to make people&#39;s children  <br/>
happy.  A mother with happy children will find it easier to be a  <br/>
happy mother than a mother whose children are unhappy.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think that someone writing to you privately about her  <br/>
feelings, which also didn&#39;t sound like an &quot;attack&quot; at all is  <br/>
&quot;tacky&quot;.  What came off as &quot;tacky&quot; was that you posted it publicly  <br/>
for all to read.  I find that very disrespectful.  You could&#39;ve  <br/>
easily just stated that you got an email that you didn&#39;t like and  <br/>
state the reasons you didn&#39;t like it.<br/>

When you run a list, do as  you wish.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to be insulted for my volunteer work.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel the need to be &#39;respectful&#39; of people who write to tell  <br/>
me I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing or how to do it, even though I might  <br/>
know a little about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are other lists I&#39;m not on, if anyone wants to get away from  <br/>
lists I&#39;m on.<br/>
Here.  I&#39;ve voluntarily made a page with links to them:<br/>

Don&#39;t join UnschoolingDiscussion, though, if you want to get away  <br/>
from me.  Any of the others are unpolluted by my presence.<br/>
