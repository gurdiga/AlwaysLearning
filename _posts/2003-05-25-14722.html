<div id="ygrps-yiv-557911508">I am home, and I am exhausted, and honestly, I need some sympathy for a<br/>
really rough day.  I didn&#39;t sleep well last night, just feeling uneasy about<br/>
today.  Talk about premonitions.<br/>
<br/>
My car wouldn&#39;t start this morning before church.  I had scads of stuff to<br/>
bring to church, because there were extra choir rehearsals and baseball<br/>
practice for my son, and all that.  No way I was going to take the train.<br/>
So I tracked down my neighbor to jump it.  Fortunately, it appears that the<br/>
battery was the only problem, because is has run fine since.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so long story short, church started at 9:45, and I left to go home at<br/>
4:15.  Had something to drop off at someone&#39;s house and found them fine.<br/>
Got lost on the way home.  This is not unusual for me in Germany, the roads<br/>
are former cow paths and the cows had no sense of direction.  It takes an<br/>
hour to drive the 20 km home, but I arrive.  Finally.<br/>
<br/>
Relax.  Make popcorn, read the paper and a few emails.  Remember I need to<br/>
call a friend about getting together on Tuesday.  Her phone rings once, and<br/>
Tim is shrieking in pain.  So I hang up, and look.  He has a hand over his<br/>
eye, and there&#39;s blood down the fingers and the face.  Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
The cat scratched him, and she managed to catch his eye.  So after I mop him<br/>
up enough to puzzle out what&#39;s going on, it appears that there is a cut on<br/>
the center inside of the lower lid.  So off we go to the German hospital.<br/>
(No military hospital here or anywhere near here.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, you must understand that German hospitals are just not like American<br/>
hospitals.  I walk in the front door (there&#39;s no emergency entrance) and the<br/>
receptionist speaks no English, and my German is mediocre at the best of<br/>
times.  She points, and we head off.  And get lost.  In the hospital.  Miles<br/>
of empty corridors.  This is where I lost it.  Finally, a nurse appears and<br/>
magically, she speaks enough English to puzzle out the problem, and leads me<br/>
to where I need to be.  It&#39;s nowhere near where the receptionist pointed, so<br/>
far as I can tell. <br/>
<br/>
After ten minutes discussion about who will pay for this, I finally convince<br/>
the doctor to look at my son&#39;s eye.  I am ready to lose it again, but in<br/>
anger this time.  Let&#39;s talk money after we deal with a scared, hurting<br/>
child, okay?  GRRRRRRRRRR!<br/>
<br/>
This doctor can tell me that he does not need stitches.  (Brilliant,<br/>
Sherlock.  Even *I* had guessed that.)  So we must see the opthomologist.<br/>
Miraculously, there is one working on a Sunday night.  In the town 30 km up<br/>
the road.  And like any good doctor, we arrive early and she&#39;s running late.<br/>
Tim is hungry, tierd, scared, and wants to go home.  Me too, but we really<br/>
do need to see this doctor.<br/>
<br/>
After the &quot;who&#39;s going pay&quot; song and dance again, she turns out to be quite<br/>
nice, does a very good exam of his eye.  The cornea is NOT scratched, to my<br/>
great relief, and the cut will heal on its own.  She gives us an antiboitic,<br/>
bandages the eye, and home we go.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so relieved that he&#39;s okay, but still so wound up inside about a system<br/>
that seems so much more interested in money than people.  I know the<br/>
military is terribly slow about paying their bills.  I am very sorry for<br/>
that, and I was happy to pay the bills tonight and will bill the insurance<br/>
myself.  But please, help my son first!<br/>
<br/>
So somebody, please, say something calming.  Soon.  Thank you!!!<br/>

(And, it&#39;s exactly the same in U.S. hospitals -- probably not in U.S.<br/>
military hospitals, but in civilian hospitals you betcha. The Germans<br/>
probably LEARNED it from us. Walk into an emergency room here and the first<br/>
thing they make you do is go to the little office and write them a check or<br/>
fill out the insurance forms. They&#39;re also no better at giving directions<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeow!  What a day!  But you handled it, and Tim&#39;s okay.  This whole thing <br/>
could have gone so much worse, but I&#39;m so glad you are both home ~ <br/>
together!  You know, the one thing, weird as it sounds, that gets me <br/>
through really rough days like that is that most days are NOT like <br/>
that.  Most days are peaceful and calm and even though things happen, they <br/>
are not nearly as outrageous and taxing and scary as today was for <br/>
you.  And, it helps me appreciate those calmer days so much more!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you both can enjoy your evening, and when you wake up tomorrow, <br/>
it&#39;ll be a new *different* day.<br/>
<br/>
With love and hugs,<br/>
<br/>
Marji <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890432650">Brenda, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re son is okay.  Thank goodness it&#39;s all over.  <br/>
<br/>
Pam&#39;s right about the U.S.&#39;s ER&#39;s.  I cut my thumb a couple years back <br/>
on a broken glass while washing dishes, halfway severing a tendon. In <br/>
the ER, I was of course sent to their little office to fill out forms, <br/>
and after asking me all the usual questions, the woman working whipped <br/>
out a pen and handed over the forms to be signed, seemingly completely <br/>
oblivious to the blood soaked clothes I was holding on my right hand <br/>
with my left.  After one wild-eyed look at my dh, he signed for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Yet the thing I always try to remind myself is that I&#39;m really glad <br/>
there are people who want to be Dr&#39;s and nurses and ambulance drivers, <br/>
etc. Even though I wish they could do the job with more common sense, <br/>
I&#39;m still glad that in an emergency, they are there.  I&#39;m glad you were <br/>
able to eventually get the help you needed.   HeidiC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654902335">You are way to hard on yourself. You are in a foreign country - have you not just moved there? How stressful that must be! Where is your man? Is he not a warrior? Does that not carry stress of its own?<br/>
You did wonderful as the stress piles on you heavier and heavier.<br/>
You should be proud......<br/>
I think there are many that would have fallen part right at the beginning...an eye injury is such a scary thing.<br/>

You are a strong and patient mother. Good for you! Better for your babies.<br/>
