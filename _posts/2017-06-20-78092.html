On her own, just like that- and asked for lots of fruit, dried fruit, nuts etc to be kept on hand for snacks. She has both a healthy appetite and a great body image. &nbsp;When I asked her why she felt that way, and changed, she said she felt it was better for her to just eat things that looked more like they did when they grew.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234863107divtagdefaultwrapper" style="font-size:12pt;color:#000000;font-family:Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif;" dir="ltr">

<br>
==I don&#39;t know for sure where this is coming from==<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t think it matters - ALL kids will get exposed to judgements and discussions about body size and image at some point. All kids will compare their bodies to the bodies of others and hope/wish something about it was different.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
== I think I had hoped that she&#39;d have a different relationship with her body than the one I had/have with my own body==<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t think that this is her relationship now, forever, with her body. It&#39;s likely just a quick phase - don&#39;t get stuck in it :)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="color:rgb(33, 33, 33);font-family:Georgia, serif, EmojiFont;font-size:15px;">
<div dir="ltr">==So maybe she&#39;ll be satisfied if we do a little bit of exercise, for instance (and that is what she has mentioned).==<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;When Kai has expressed a wish to do more exercise to lose weight (yes - it happens to boys too!), I have suggested if he wants to do that, he does it to get stronger and fitter, if he wants to, and asserted that he doesn&#39;t need to lose weight, and that his
 body is going to grow and change a LOT before he&#39;s an adult.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I told him he can join me on walks if he wants - and left it up to him. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
For the record - his musings on &#39;weight&#39; usually pass very quickly as long as I don&#39;t help him dwell on them.<br>
<br>
<br>
==Although maybe I should warn her that it might not work as fast as she thinks it will?==<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;You don&#39;t know if it might &#39;work&#39; or even what &#39;work&#39; really means to her. I wouldn&#39;t say anything at all. If she wants to walk more, or whatever type of exercise, do it with her and see it as a time to connect - Kai and I have big talks on our walks :)</div>
<div dir="ltr"><br>
</div>
<div>==I think I&#39;m looking for ideas on how to help her have a positive body image==<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t project your fears on to her. Work hard on your own&nbsp;body image, so she has a good model. Don&#39;t get stuck in this one phase and think that it means she&#39;ll have a poor body image for ever - it is natural for kids her age to start thinking about their body,
 comparing it to others and comparing it to bodies they see on TV and in shows.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949238483"><div>My kids have been involved in an amazing martial arts program for a couple of years, and I just joined the adult program. It is an approach to training that combines a number of styles to address the whole picture of physical and mental fitness in a way that is gentle and challenging and supportive. Each person is always working towards their own best, not competing or comparing. I cannot overemphasize how wonderful it has been to watch Wallace go from saying, &quot;I&#39;m not an athlete and I&#39;m the worst player on the team&quot; to being invited to train for the demonstration team in less than two years. </div><div><br></div><div>If she wants to get exercise because it sounds appealing, a program like this could be a great fit. Not because it will change her body, but because it will build up her strength and self-confidence and allow her to find what is fitness for *her*. I train with people of all ages, body types, and fitness levels, and we all feel valued and respected. I know this because we talk about it:)</div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>
