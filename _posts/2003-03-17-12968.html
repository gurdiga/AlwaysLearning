<div id="ygrps-yiv-662546550">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list but not new to unschooling.  I have lurked for a <br/>
week or so but the conversation this morning prompted me to begin <br/>
chatting with you all.<br/>
<br/>
My introduction was made sort of informally, so I thought I&#39;d try <br/>
again.  I am Maggie Lesoing, married, with 2 unschooled boys, Ethan, age <br/>
5 (6 in June!) and Cyrus, age 9.  Someone today said they had unschooled <br/>
since birth, and I think that is true for us, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I love unschooling with all my heart.  It truly &#39;fits.&#39; The only <br/>
so-called problem I ever have (apart from my husband&#39;s occasional low <br/>
confidence levels -- lol!) is that we are TOGETHER all day, every day, <br/>
and all night, as well.  We have time apart when the boys go play at a <br/>
neighbor&#39;s house or something, but basically it&#39;s us together constantly.<br/>
<br/>
Amid all this togetherness, which I mostly love dearly, there are times <br/>
when my mind craves being physically alone, or when I crave quiet, or <br/>
when I can&#39;t stand one more minute of fighting!  (The boys have gotten <br/>
into a nasty routine of fighting together quite a bit!)<br/>
<br/>
How do you all handle this?  Is it an issue for anyone else?  Parenting <br/>
is very much in the forefront of my mind most of the time, like how to <br/>
handle some tougher situations, like fighting, etc.  My philosophy is <br/>
in-line with the Parenting with Dignity people, (they even have a web <br/>
site for anyone interested --    <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parentingwithdignity.com/PWD/menu/index.htm)">http://www.parentingwithdignity.com/PWD/menu/index.htm)</a>  but even with <br/>
that philosophy my patience and creativity is frequently challenged.<br/>
<br/>
Just hoping for support and suggestions from others.  There are other <br/>
homeschoolers in our tiny little town but I am the only unschooler as <br/>
far as I know, and most of not all of the other hs&#39;ers do curriculums or <br/>
school at home.  It can begin to feel that I am afloat in a vast ocean <br/>
with one tiny life boat.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.  You are all wonderful, of course!<br/>
<br/>
Maggie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339129356">Well I guess I should introduce myself too, especially since I&#39;ve already <br/>
posted several times. LOL <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Rhonda Hill, wife to Phillip, mother to Kass & Kree, our 11 yo twin <br/>
daughters. We&#39;ve unschooled since the minute I took them out of public <br/>
school. That was about 3 years ago. I never knew such a thing existed until <br/>
shortly before I took them out, all I knew was that &quot;school&quot; didn&#39;t work for <br/>
us. I was feeling as though everything was a battle and red tape. I had <br/>
always heard of homeschooling as a conservative, religious based decision. I <br/>
figured I&#39;d lie if I had to and say it was based on my religious beliefs, <br/>
figuring that since it is a constitutional right, that it would be a good <br/>
base from which to stand. No matter how far from the truth. Wow, was I <br/>
shocked when I joined several local groups. Some were religious based, others <br/>
diversified, but more importantly I found I was not alone. <br/>
<br/>
Now a member of 2 groups,  one more diverse than another, I have many <br/>
unschooling friends. They lurk here too. But they have to introduce <br/>
themselves.LOL <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we have no typical day. Everyday is different and we find joy in all <br/>
of them. There&#39;s even joy in the bickering. My hubby usually reminds them <br/>
that if they were in school they wouldn&#39;t be with each other so maybe they&#39;d <br/>
get along better??? They quickly admit their pettiness and that it would <br/>
definately suck to go back. He is a complete believer in unschooling and is <br/>
currently sitting behind me trying to mess me up because I&#39;m not paying <br/>
attention to him right now. He&#39;s my biggest kid of course. Jealous of the <br/>
computer and books. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to say that he&#39;s a Marine &  National Guardsman, however he was <br/>
inactivated a couples of years ago when I got ill. To all of you with loved <br/>
ones serving, our thoughts and hopes are with you. The twins plan on going <br/>
into the Corps, a thought that can make a mother both honored and sad <br/>
simultaneously. They are young still and could change their minds tomorrow, <br/>
but then again isn&#39;t that what all this is about? We would not change our <br/>
lifestyle for any other. We are free in our home, if not in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Probably way more info than any of you wanted to know. But those here who <br/>
know me personally can testify I tend to have diarhea of the mouth, the <br/>
keyboard and other orfaces. LOL<br/>
<br/>
This group is wonderful, thank you to everyone on it.<br/>
<br/>
