<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719881629">I have 2 girls. Marti is the oldest and she will be 8 in July. Lilly is 4<br/>
1/2. We are having a little issue that I am at a loss about.<br/>
<br/>
Lilly likes to play with Marti. She wants her attention quite a bit. Marti<br/>
blows her off on a regular basis, lately. I do my best to step in and say<br/>
&quot;Lilly, lets go play&quot;. I catch it nearly all of the time, say 90% or so. A<br/>
lot of times though, I am just not what Lilly wants. Any ideas on how I can<br/>
explain to Lilly that Marti doesn&#39;t want to play with her without hurting<br/>
feelings?<br/>

<br/>
I would do more talking to Marti than Lilly about it.  And not to try  <br/>
to get her to let Lilly play all the time, but to sometimes give  <br/>
Lilly special attention, for Marti to play with Lilly, instead of  <br/>
&quot;letting Lilly play with Marti.&quot;  There&#39;s a big difference and an  <br/>
eight year old is likely able to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
In exchange for that, then you could give her lots of uninterrupted  <br/>
time so that Lilly starts to see that sometimes Marti needs time  <br/>
alone, but it won&#39;t be a long series of &quot;no&quot; with an occasional &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, I bet they could get along better outside the house, away from  <br/>
Marti&#39;s possessions and space.  Go to a mall or store, but schedule  <br/>
enough extra time (you don&#39;t need to tell the girls) that they can  <br/>
play around on a bench or a planter around trees, or somewhere  <br/>
outside where they can jump and climb and run a little bit, where the  <br/>
two of them are doing something in a new and interesting setting.   I  <br/>
was picturing things outside a mall near me, where if you park a  <br/>
little far you pass by some stuff.  Or go out a door that&#39;s NOT  <br/>
nearest your car.  See what you see.  Ramps, stairs.<br/>
<br/>
Go for a picnic, or to feed birds or prairie dogs.  (depending where  <br/>
you are)<br/>
<br/>
Throw rocks in a pond or river.    (ditto--some places have rocks, no  <br/>
water; some water, no rocks)<br/>

Can you really go feed prairie dogs?  What do they eat?  I&#39;m fascinated...<br/>

Well...  The answer is &quot;it depends,&quot; and this could lead to a eco- <br/>
philosophical dilemma or three.  But rather than expound on prairie  <br/>
dogs, I can provide these two links:<br/>

<br/>
And where prairie dogs live by freeway exits, some will live up near  <br/>
the traffic light and... I started to say &quot;beg,&quot; but they&#39;re not  <br/>
begging.  I guess they&#39;re hinting--looking hopeful and expectant.   <br/>
And sometimes people will throw things out to them.  I&#39;ll try to get  <br/>
photo of some of those later this summer.<br/>

the day. Roxana really needed a LOT of pretend-play and got hard-to- <br/>
get-along-with when she didn&#39;t enough of it. If they played an intense  <br/>
pretend-play hour in the morning, the rest of the day always went  <br/>
noticeably more smoothly. Roya could tell that it was much better, so  <br/>
she was willing.<br/>

That sounds like a really good way to do it.  Early in the day.<br/>
<br/>
With us, I would ask Kirby to do something Marty liked for a while  <br/>
sometimes.  And occasionally I would offer Kirby money to distract  <br/>
Marty while I needed to do something else.  He would read to him, or  <br/>
play something strenuous outside.  The difference between those times  <br/>
and the play-by-choice times were a little like a practice job for  <br/>
Kirby.  It was always optional.  Sometimes he wanted money to buy  <br/>
Ninja Turtles.<br/>
