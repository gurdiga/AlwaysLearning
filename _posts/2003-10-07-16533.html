I got a message today with a subject line, &quot;Invitation to Join the <br/>
Unschooling2 Group.  I was suspicious because it talks about the <br/>
unschooling group you now are a member of having a technical problem.  The <br/>
only fast solution is to start a new one with a similar name.  First of <br/>
all, there *is* no Yahoo group with that name.  You&#39;re supposed to go <br/>
straight to that group&#39;s page, which of course is not on the Yahoo site at <br/>
all.  It&#39;s groups.yahoo.com rather than yahoogroups.com.  I&#39;m guessing <br/>
going there could get you a nice new worm or something for your <br/>
computer.  Please be careful, and if you&#39;ve already gone there, make sure <br/>
you scan your computer with good anti-virus software.<br/>

<br/>
I have already joined this new group.  It seems to be on the up and up.  Just incase I ran antivirus, it found nothing wrong.  Anyone else have any thoughts or the real &quot;What&#39;s up&quot;?<br/>

by yahoo. i&#39;ve been typing in groups.yahoo.com to get to the site for<br/>
months. i&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, but that i didn&#39;t see anything<br/>
suspicious (though i haven&#39;t joined the new group yet). i would contact<br/>
the people at the homeschool zone website (i think, who the original email<br/>
is supposed to be from) or the list owners of either group i mentioned<br/>
above, before accusing them of something. :o)<br/>

I don&#39;t know why they would try to lure you away with a valid link.  There&#39;s <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nah.  I was mistaken.  The unschooling list actually is being changed to <br/>
unschooling2 to avoid a Yahoo problem they were having.  I just didn&#39;t <br/>
realize it since I was on nomail.  And searching on Yahoo for the new group <br/>
didn&#39;t work because it takes a couple of days for groups to show up.<br/>

When i go to yahoogroups I just put in yahoogroups.com.  I know it redirects, <br/>
but as long as it&#39;s working, I don&#39;t have to learn anything new.  So there.<br/>

out.  When I couldn&#39;t find the group by searching at Yahoo, that got my <br/>
suspicions up.  I wasn&#39;t accusing anyone of anything, just trying to stop <br/>
people gettin hurt by a possible scam.  I *know* that there are people out <br/>
there doing all kinds of things to get people to websites where they will <br/>
get a worm.  I thought possibly this was one of them.<br/>
