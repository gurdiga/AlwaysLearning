<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078307930">We really have the holiday birthdays at our house.....Oldest is Christmas<br/>
Eve (11:33 p.m.....almost the first Christmas baby that year).  Our 3y.o.<br/>
arrived 2-1/2 weeks early...I&#39;m wondering if she just wanted to be born at<br/>
Easter!  And finally,  our littlest (1yo), came two weeks LATE!!  He held<br/>
out for Halloween!!!  Only one child was born on a non-holiday....poor thing<br/>
may feel left out around here.<br/>
    I must say I STILL haven&#39;t figured a great way to keep the Christmas<br/>
girl&#39;s b-day from not &#39;blending in &#39; with the holiday.<br/>

&gt; I really hope I&#39;m doing this message stuff right....I&#39;ve never been on an<br/>
&gt; e-mail list like this so I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
&gt; Anyway...<br/>
&gt; Tia, I thought Mimi&#39;s were a Southern thing!! Never heard it before moving<br/>
&gt; down here.<br/>
&gt; And we have a holiday baby too (another New Year&#39;s baby) and I&#39;m sure<br/>
that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; part of what prompted him to ask for the special day. We started out by<br/>
&gt; calling it a Trevor day...then moved into the half Birthday thing.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a great day because there is no pressure on me to do decorations or<br/>
&gt; anything. It&#39;s simple, but fun.<br/>

very small extra something on the real birthday.  My daughter was going to <br/>
do that for her little girl, but it never happened.<br/>
