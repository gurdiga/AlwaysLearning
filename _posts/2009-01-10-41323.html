<div id="ygrps-yiv-430417603">My kids have been watching some YouTube videos with lego characters<br/>
singing/dancing/fighting, what have you.  I&#39;m sure my oldest would like to<br/>
try his hand at making some of these himself, but this is where my age shows<br/>
as it is a &quot;new&quot; area of computing that I know nothing about.  Does anyone<br/>
know how they do these things?  Is there a program one buys where you upload<br/>
a photo & can then make characters move?<br/>
Feeling decidedly clueless & un-modern,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-491115534">There are several.<br/>
IF you have Windows look for Windows Movie MAker in your computer.<br/>
My two computers came with it.<br/>
You canot make characters move.<br/>
You take pictures and move a hand a little take another picture.<br/>
Its like frame by frame and upload the pictures. Choose the speed the pictures will play and that will make it look like the characters are moving.<br/>
YOu can add subtittles, music, voices and much much more. It is not difficult.<br/>
I bet if you research they have some fre software you can download.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133774453">we use stop motion pro with a web cam, because that allows control of each pic from the computer keyboard.  there is a trial version of stop motion pro downloadable for free and the web cam cost under $40....you can do it with modeling clay too - make your own claymation!<br/>
