<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403500717">I don&#39;t have any advise, but my boys have used a  math text book up until<br/>
now, and I still have to help them a lot when it comes to games. Even with<br/>
adding up the money, or dice etc. they ask a lot of questions about the<br/>
instructions. It could just be a different situation for your daughter and<br/>
it caused her to draw a blank or caught her off guard. BTW my boys are 12<br/>
and 14.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;oth my children have areas that I am sure others would be very<br/>
 </span></blockquote>surprised that they didn&#39;t &quot;know&quot;**, given their ages, and at 13 and 10 yrs<br/>
old they are both well into school age believe me. One example recently<br/>
that made me think of this whole thread, is dd (13) was struggling to play<br/>
Monoploy at Girl Guides as she has never added columns of numbers on paper,<br/>
and couldn&#39;t do the mental math in her head to pay people or buy things,<br/>
although I know in real life she has done so with allowance and rounding it<br/>
up in her head/estimating change, or &quot;candy money&quot; in much smaller amounts<br/>
under 10.00, and with basic things like even amounts of dollars (no cents<br/>
involved). The other girls had to help her out a lot<br/>
