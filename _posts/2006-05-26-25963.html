There&#39;s the site of the people who are doing the movie Kirby&#39;s in.   <br/>
It will be shown at a local festival, at least, and be available on  <br/>
DVD next fall, I think.<br/>
<br/>
It talks about auditions, where the cast is listed, but Kirby was a  <br/>
straight invitee, I think.  They knew him from the gaming store.<br/>
<br/>
The project is called &quot;In Character,&quot; and is about role-playing gamers.<br/>

What is your take on the necessity of cursive writing.  Do kids really<br/>
need to learn it.?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My granny was sure, in the the 60&#39;s, that my life would be incomplete  <br/>
because I was learning to write with pencil and ballpoint instead of  <br/>
a fountain pen.<br/>
<br/>
I did okay.  And because of personal interest, I did a lot of writing  <br/>
with fountain pens, cartridge pens and dip pens.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s cursive writing is unuseable for everyday purposes.  I  <br/>
know one young man in his 20&#39;s who went to school &quot;regularly&quot; and  <br/>
can&#39;t read cursive writing very well at all.  He can&#39;t be the only one.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s fading.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It does seem that &quot;keyboarding&quot; (once known as typing) is the  <br/>
important skill to have.<br/>
Even if I thought cursive was a necessity for life, though, trying to  <br/>
make people do it wouldn&#39;t be a good way to get there.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s handwriting improved a lot after he went to work at a pizza  <br/>
place and took phone orders that other people needed to be able to  <br/>
read.  It was his first real use of quick handwriting.  Some people  <br/>
never find a real-world need for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807811298">My son can&#39;t read cursive yet. I&#39;m not too worried. I think the need <br/>
for it is diminishing greatly with the use of computers. My son can <br/>
type really fast. <br/>
<br/>
The only time i really use cursive is in signing checks or credit card <br/>
slips, or when i am making a list for myself. (Obviously, if i am <br/>
leaving a note for my son i print.) My son recently opened up a <br/>
savings acct and &quot;signed&quot; the back of the check he was depositing...he <br/>
printed his name. It was fine. I think if there is a situation in <br/>
which he needs to read cursive, he&#39;ll learn it pretty quickly, the <br/>
same way he&#39;s learned computer programs, or typing, etc.<br/>

signature, but a Deposit only, account #xxxxx.  People who CAN sign  <br/>
in cursive. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty has direct deposit and uses a debit card, so even the argument  <br/>
about signing checks that DID seem to make sense to me a few years  <br/>
ago has passed on into history, pretty much.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a check this week to someone who doesn&#39;t have PayPal. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And a couple of weeks ago I wrote one, and those were the first for  <br/>
quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
When I write grocery lists for Keith, I use my regular handwriting.   <br/>
We&#39;ve known each other nearly 30 years and can read each other&#39;s  <br/>
scribbles.  When I write for one of the kids, I use careful cursive  <br/>
and go back over letters they might miss, if it will matter (R, mostly).<br/>

No, if you have trouble with stress, you find a way to cope with it.  <br/>
If you live your life with compassion and grace, then other people  <br/>
are usually more than happy to help you in the same way. My husband  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>So why add more stress unnecessarily? That argument has always been hogwash,<br/>
and often comes from someone who is terrified to think that they could be<br/>
making their child&#39;s life BETTER by NOT adding stress. The real world has<br/>
real stresses for real people. One of our jobs is to help and support our<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having been an employer for 12 years, the people who &quot;handle&quot; stress well<br/>
are usually the ones who have had a good amount of their lives living with<br/>
peace and contentment. They have better priorities, and know the difference<br/>
between having to run quickly because there is a fire and running quickly to<br/>
meet a deadline. In both situations, calmness can be the base. And genetics<br/>
of course play a part, etc. but...<br/>
<br/>
people who are raised in an environment where even their closest allies,<br/>
their parents, add stress to their lives, do not usually come out whole or<br/>
come out the best people they can be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555076699">Cursive is any style of handwriting in which all the letters in a  <br/>
word are connected, making a word one single (complicated) stroke. In  <br/>
British English, the phrase &quot;joined-up writing&quot; is far more commonly  <br/>
used, while the term &quot;running writing&quot; is sometimes used in  <br/>
Australia. Cursive is considered distinct from the so-called  <br/>
&quot;printing&quot; or &quot;block letter&quot; style of handwriting, in which the  <br/>
letters of a word are unconnected, and from &quot;print-writing&quot;, which is  <br/>
a cross between cursive and printing, with some unconnected letters  <br/>
and some connected.<br/>
<br/>
 From wikipedia&#39;s article.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive_writing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive_writing</a><br/>
<br/>
I went to find some samples of Australian writing, and found some  <br/>
there!  Victorian Modern.  Says it&#39;s most common in Western  <br/>
Australia.  This is fun!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows of or finds something good, please send me links or  <br/>
notes!<br/>
I&#39;m putting it here:<br/>

And I think the files area of this list has a collection we started  <br/>
to make of people&#39;s handwriting.  Mine and Dan Vilter&#39;s are there, I  <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll link those to this page, but I think only list members can  <br/>
see them.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we do (in Australia) have a joined-up writing style for cursive and in schools they haev changed it to a much better form (in the past few years) that basically just joins the letters in an even more natural way. But, as a teacher, I had great trouble re-learning how to do it and I was forever embarressed to have to do handwriting lessons on the blackboard as mine was something very unworthy of copying! Hey, but I was the teacher!!!! YUK!<br/>
<br/>
As a child I hated cursive writing and, to this day, I can&#39;t do it properly. I have never, since high school, used it. Printing is so much quicker for me and typing ..well, give me a keyboard any day. I do love to write on paper though - something special about a pen and paper for me, especially that first crisp, blank  page in a new journal. But for ease and quickness I use the computer. <br/>

me, even when I kinda knew what I was looking for.    So even  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216333852">Good point! that was something we learned early on with Breanna. the  <br/>
psychologist explained it like this. If you hold your hands out  <br/>
together, they are built to hold a certain number of marbles. Some  <br/>
people have bigger hands, some have smaller. Some are able to spread  <br/>
their fingers and hold a little more than you&#39;d expect. So if you  <br/>
pile a few marbles in there, you are doing okay. A few more and maybe  <br/>
your hands start to cramp, get a little sweaty or hot. But if you  <br/>
have someone pouring marbles into your hand, you cannot just hold  <br/>
more with practice! You can handle some stress, we&#39;re all created  <br/>
differently and handle the stress differently. But everyone has a  <br/>
threshold where they can hold no more marbles.<br/>
<br/>
Our job is to put our hands under hers and help her catch the marbles  <br/>
until her hands are big enough to hold what she needs to. There is  <br/>
nothing in the job description about adding more marbles!<br/>

I know at one point I typed it all out, holding the book between my  <br/>
knee and the desk.  Probably on this list.  Probably years ago.   <br/>
Probably should do it again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He was teaching kids, elementary level I think, and said cursive was  <br/>
faster and some of them said they didn&#39;t think so.  So they raced,  <br/>
and two printers won, and so Holt quit using the explanation he had  <br/>
been told (and believed), that cursive was faster.<br/>
<br/>
Cursive is good for people using liquid ink, because the flow doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have to stop.  That&#39;s another explanation that seems reasonable in a  <br/>
way, but then...  maybe not totally valid either.  And few people use  <br/>
liquid ink anymore and those who do are often doing calligraphy  <br/>
that&#39;s not even intended to be &quot;joined up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably just art and preference, as with lots of aesthetic  <br/>
things.  Explanations are made, but don&#39;t hold up to scrutiny.  The  <br/>
explanation for why blackletter is so tightly parallel was that paper  <br/>
was expensive.  But those same books with the vertical blackletter/ <br/>
old-English script had BIG margins and full pages of giant initial  <br/>
letters, or pages of vines and flowers.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;paper is  <br/>
expensive,&quot; it&#39;s that people thought tall and elegant was pretty.   <br/>
The same people and places were creating vertical cathedrals with  <br/>
lots of columns closer together than engineering required, and making  <br/>
the buidings VERY vertical and pointy, and not because land was  <br/>
scarce and expensive. &lt;g&gt;  It was the style.<br/>
<br/>
Then in the 1960&#39;s the same people who were driving VW bugs home to  <br/>
geodesic dome houses were making those fat bubble letters.<br/>

A quote from the article.<br/>
<br/>
the findings also suggest that early positive life events may have a  <br/>
protective influence over the effects of subsequent adversity:<br/>
<br/>
ï¿½If positive life events predate the negative life events then  <br/>
individuals may be more resilient in terms of, not being so badly  <br/>
affected, psychologically, by the subsequent adverse events. However,  <br/>
issues may arise if the reverse is the case; if the adverse life  <br/>
events precede the positive, those individuals may become, as a  <br/>
result, more susceptible to suggestion and misleading information.  <br/>
Nevertheless, future research will still have to examine this. The  <br/>
order of life events experienced, however, is seemingly important.ï¿½<br/>
The study found that the parental role is an important one, so  <br/>
education- showing parents functional ways of dealing with their  <br/>
children, meaning that the children will see positive role models,  <br/>
and learn &quot;healthy&quot; skills or ways of dealing with stress/negative  <br/>
life events- may help cultivate a positive mind-set within the child  <br/>
or adolescent which will stay with them throughout life.<br/>

Sort of. It&#39;s called Foundation handwriting and it has a very similar slant to italics.The printing method of foundation has a slant too so that when they teach kids the cursive mehtod the format remians the same. Sort of a good idea I guess if they have to be taught something.  The first style of writing I learnt (in Kindergarten I guess?) was the old &#39;ball and stick&#39; method for printing and that&#39;s how I write, still today. I&#39;ve changed my k&#39;s as I had to for learning faoundation handwriting for my teaching days and my e&#39;s are more slanty.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509568479">This is addressed in Living Joyfully With Children by Win and Bill <br/>
Sweet. They posit that it is of the utmost importance to nurture and <br/>
protect a child&#39;s emotional core, and that a sound emotional core is <br/>
what helps them &quot;weather the storms&quot; that life inevitably brings.<br/>
<br/>
They claim that people with damaged emotional cores are less resilient <br/>
in the face of adversity. They cite a study that was done on soldiers <br/>
in Viet Nam. The people conducting the study split the soldiers into <br/>
two groups: those who handled stress well, who functioned well in a <br/>
crisis. The other group was made up of soldiers who had breakdowns, <br/>
abused drugs, or deserted.<br/>
<br/>
Then they studied the childhoods of each soldier and found a general <br/>
pattern. Those who abused drugs and had nervous breakdowns were much <br/>
more likely to have suffered abuse and neglect as children. Most of <br/>
those who stayed calm in hair-raising situations and did what needed to <br/>
be done effectively came from very stable nurturing homes.<br/>
<br/>
The Sweets caution parents not to send kids out into the world too <br/>
soon, that it&#39;s better to let that separation happen naturally. Also <br/>
they stress the importance of not pushing kids too hard, of letting <br/>
them &quot;walk&quot; on their own from one stage, from one milestone to another, <br/>
without a lot of pressure. They say that &quot;giving childhood back to your <br/>
children&quot; is the best way to nurture their emotional core. And I say <br/>
what better way to give back their childhood than by unschooling them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So some of that could be genetic.  People who aren&#39;t alcoholic/ <br/>
addictive are more likely to create and maintain a stable, nurturing  <br/>
home.  And they&#39;re genetically more likely to produce children who  <br/>
are like them biochemically and emotionally (might be the same thing,  <br/>
those two).<br/>
<br/>
What they&#39;ll really need to study to show the full effect is children  <br/>
adopted from known stable and nurturing parents into homes where  <br/>
parents were abusive and neglectful.  The problem is, stable and  <br/>
nurturing parents&#39;  children don&#39;t as often get put out for adoption  <br/>
as the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
But in any case, making a kid cry about cursive writing isn&#39;t going  <br/>
to help. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The specific suggestion that early pressure makes kids gullible is  <br/>
interesting.   School makes kids gullible too, and encourages them to  <br/>
ignore their parents, in various ways, and to have faith in the  <br/>
teachers and other kids.  Then the teachers and other kids change  <br/>
frequently, and schools often enforce that too, purposely separating  <br/>
friends when it comes time to schedule classes.<br/>
<br/>
So kids left adrift that way will identify with the first charismatic  <br/>
kid who comes along, and voilaâ€”odd little destructive projects, drug  <br/>
experimentation, and gangs.    If there&#39;s more stability and  <br/>
longevity in a clique or a gang (small or large) than at home or in  <br/>
school, kids are actually making the best choice to join a gang.<br/>
<br/>
Weird but true.<br/>
<br/>
People have needs, and the need to belong and feel safe sometimes  <br/>
isn&#39;t met until they get to prison.  And the idea that gullibility  <br/>
would make someone likely to confess to a crime that he didn&#39;t really  <br/>
commit is fine, but it will also get one involved in committing real  <br/>
crimes, when other say &quot;Oh, it will work!  Easy!  Just do this/that/ <br/>
whatever....&quot;   How many people fantasize bank robberies and perfect  <br/>
murders?  Some just write novels or screenplays or work on TV shows.   <br/>
Others decide to try it at home or down the street.  It&#39;s sad.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t try to force your children to learn loopy cursive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730893291">I think reading cursive is definitely age related.  I doubt the majority of<br/>
even recent public school graduates can read cursive with ease.   Those who<br/>
enjoy decoding will be able to sort it out if they are motivated by things<br/>
like perhaps love notes done in cursive. Not at all necessary to read or<br/>
write cursive to &quot;get along in life&quot;.<br/>

I think that for the under 25 crowd reading cursive is perhaps as necessary<br/>
as the the over 40 crowd learning the lingo and abbreviations for texting.<br/>

utilize probably &quot;just ain&#39;t gonna happen&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>About the only cursive Kathryn has seen in 19 years is maybe a dozen  <br/>
or so letters and (lengthy) notes written on cards. At first she did  <br/>
ask me to read them to her but now it&#39;s only a word or two if the  <br/>
letters are very deformed.<br/>
<br/>
For kids who are interested it&#39;s like an intriguing code. My guess is  <br/>
it&#39;s like when little kids hear speaking. There are words and phrases  <br/>
they don&#39;t understand but they pick up the meaning from the parts they  <br/>
do understand. So if a kid tries to read cursive they&#39;ll be able to  <br/>
pick up some of it since some letters are similar and they&#39;ll build  <br/>
