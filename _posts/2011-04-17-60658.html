<div id="ygrps-yiv-551431329">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
a couple of months ago somebody wrote about a book that I would like to read but i can&#39;t find the title.<br/>
The book is about people who don&#39;t want to choose between things to do but they want to do it all.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone remember which book it was? It was written by a woman.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Josh<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447304947">I&#39;m just guessing that it was Barbara Sher&#39;s book Refuse to Choose or a <br/>
different one by her. <br/>
