<div id="ygrps-yiv-180993449">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re an unschooling family up here by Bangor.  My 10 year old son is now interested in trying out an on-line math program.  something, ideally, with some games as part of it and something where he can build skill from bottom up.  He has a lot of the basics with math, but now has an interest in trying to be &#39;caught&#39; up (whatever that means to him ) to his grade level (going into 5th grade).<br/>
<br/>
So a program where he can start maybe at an earlier grade or difficulty level and then &#39;test out&#39; or go through it quickly for what he knows...and take more time over what he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions!<br/>

Khan Academy is a great on-line resource for free. My kids love it, even thought it&#39;s not a game format, they do get stars when they master a level. Brainpop is also a cool resource. Google searches bring up all kinds of sites. When my kids ask me about finding something, we google together, and they almost always find something that leads to something that inspires us/them which may or may not have anything to do with the original quest !<br/>

this - at 10 years old he&#39;d be better off doing other things - real things<br/>
- and letting the math learning just happen along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Do you not really know what being caught up means to him? The concept of<br/>
&quot;caught up&quot; doesn&#39;t really make a lot of sense in an unschooling context -<br/>
I would assume he thinks he is behind schooled kids. He might benefit from<br/>
some conversation about the very idea of &quot;ahead&quot; and &quot;behind&quot; in life!<br/>
Grade levels are very artificial and pretty goofy ways of classifying<br/>
people - convenient for mass education, but not natural at all.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could get the Mighty Math series of computer games from Edmark. Zoo<br/>
Zillions, Carnival Countdown, Astro Algebra, Cosmic Geometry - there are a<br/>
couple more. They&#39;re not grade specific - they&#39;re fun - and in playing the<br/>
games the player learns and uses pretty much all the math normally taught<br/>
up through elementary and into middle school.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to continue unschooling, I&#39;d try to move him away from thinking<br/>
of himself in a grade level - that&#39;s kind of a hindrance to free and<br/>
wonderful unschooling.<br/>

Does he have a particular goal or is he looking for interesting puzzle games in general? A fun series of logic games is the Myst series - some of the games are so old that the first &quot;logic puzzle&quot; is how to get them to run on your computer, but they&#39;re fantastic games with good replay factor. The first time through, it helps to consult a walkthrough, but once you get the hang of the particular logic of the games, they&#39;re a blast... and interesting stories, too. <br/>
