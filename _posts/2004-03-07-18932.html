<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077681081">I think the assumption I see you making is that unschooling children are <br/>
never involved in formal educational situations. <br/>
<br/>
For some kids that is the case.  For others it is not the case. <br/>
<br/>
My oldest child will be nine next week, but she has already been a part <br/>
of more formal educational situations, of her own choosing, doing formal <br/>
work, with deadlines (She&#39;s involved in a film club where she is, along <br/>
with others, writing, and then producing, their own film).  She&#39;s also <br/>
been in formal classrooms, and has taken formal tests, all of her own <br/>
choosing.  Unschooling simply means, to me, child led learning.  It does <br/>
not mean no formal learning. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I don&#39;t prepare my children for anything.  We work together.  :-) <br/>

<br/>
I think that if my children have the opportunity to have some real <br/>
control over their lives and their learning now, then their future will <br/>
be one of their choosing and they will prepare for it themselves, with <br/>
me being there to simply provide the food, transportation, hugs, love, <br/>
encouragement, guidance, etc.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If your child is motivated to go to college because they want to learn <br/>
something and think that is the best way at the time, or they need a college degree <br/>
for a career they desire, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll have any problem figuring out <br/>
how to handle the *classroom setting*.  College classes vary a lot from each <br/>
other and in my experience tend to be a lot different from highschool classes.<br/>
<br/>
In my dd&#39;s experience of attending ps for 7th grade after being previously <br/>
homeschooled, she adjusted to the middle school setting better than the students <br/>
who had come from ps elementary school.  (Her guidance counselor actually <br/>
commented on this.)  I think it was because she didn&#39;t have any expectations <br/>
about how school should be but just saw it as an adventure.  I think an unschooler <br/>
might experience the same thing if their first *classroom* was in college.  <br/>
They wouldn&#39;t be carrying around expectations from highschool.  A lot of <br/>
highschoolers seem to let the freedom of college sidetrack them from learning.  An <br/>
unschooler definitely wouldn&#39;t have this problem!<br/>

<br/>
How to show up at classes and on time?<br/>
How to take notes during a lecture, take a test, or write an essay?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you mean that they need to have studied certain things in order <br/>
to be prepared to understand the material taught in the college <br/>
classes?<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to popular belief, college courses do not assume any prior <br/>
knowledge in a subject because the professors (I am one) are perfectly <br/>
aware that students do not come from high school with much, if any, <br/>
retention of whatever courses they supposedly took. We assume nothing <br/>
and start from scratch in all freshman courses.  Unschooled kids <br/>
typically have broad general knowledge and far more retention of what <br/>
they&#39;ve learned then kids in school who have &quot;studied&quot; certain <br/>
subjects.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say that the biggest problem new students have, in college, is <br/>
UNlearning bad habits they&#39;ve developed in high school. By this I mean, <br/>
for example, that they have the habit of relying on a teacher to tell <br/>
them EXACTLY what is going to be on a test and they expect to just <br/>
memorize whatever it is they are told and spit it back out on an exam. <br/>
Some college courses are like that, too. But in some courses, they&#39;re <br/>
expected to read and THINK about material and understand it far beyond <br/>
just regurgitating it for the test. Many of them just can&#39;t get to that <br/>
point - they&#39;ve spent many years perfecting the art of reading a <br/>
chapter, answering the end-of-chapter questions, and spitting it all <br/>
out on a test and forgetting it. THINKING is not part of the repertoire <br/>
they&#39;ve built up in high school. THIS is the most frustrating part of <br/>
teaching college freshmen, for me.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids might have poor handwriting &lt;G&gt;. And they might have <br/>
idiosyncratic ways of doing arithmetic. And they might need some <br/>
instruction on how to write a standard essay (they&#39;ll get that <br/>
instruction in their first semester &quot;College Writing&quot; course). But the <br/>
one thing that is important in college is that they are willing to <br/>
actually engage - think - wonder - make connections between material in <br/>
a course and what else they know or are learning. For unschooled kids, <br/>
this is how they live - it is as natural to them as breathing. For <br/>
schooled kids, this is the HARDEST part of college and it sometimes <br/>
takes a Herculean effort for them to throw off the weight of bad habits <br/>
formed in response to their previous schooling.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Well anything we tell you about college today, then, would be fifteen years <br/>
or more outdated by the time your son&#39;s that age, right?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do home/unschooling parents prepare their kids for the curriculum <br/>
<br/>
and scheduling of college if the kids have never participated in an <br/>
<br/>
actual &quot;classroom&quot; setting? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to be prepared.  If they&#39;re interested, they just do it. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen it happen lots.<br/>
<br/>
Same as waking up to go to class or to go to work or to a picnic or to pick <br/>
up a friend at the airport.  People don&#39;t need years of &quot;practice&quot; or <br/>
preparation to use an alarm clock when they need to.<br/>
<br/>
My son used to wake up before 6:30 every morning (on his own with an alarm <br/>
clock) to record Ninja Turtles, and then go back to sleep.  When he doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to go to work, he sleeps until 1:00 p.m. or so.  Yet he&#39;s had a job for three <br/>
and a half years, and has only overslept once.  How can that be? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;you have to prepare for the future&quot; stuff is school-message.  Let it go. <br/>
 Empty your school memories so you have more room for more fun things!<br/>
<br/>
Here are lots of ideas for you to consider if you think you&#39;d like to <br/>
unschool:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632248671">Hi Lauren!<br/>
 <br/>
Welcome, and congratulations on becoming a Mom!  Seven weeks and already looking ahead to college, are you?  <br/>
 <br/>
You are going to find that so many of our best plans with our kids seldom turn out as we planned.  This is because, when we just love our kids, let them unfold on their own and come to know who they are, what we get is so much more and better than we could have ever thought to plan or even ask for!  <br/>
 <br/>
When you have loved your children, and raised thim in freedom, cherishing their journey -- and yours -- they will know what they want from life, and how to pursue it, whether or not they ever spent a moment in a classroom.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, by the time a person goes to college, even the most unschooled have likely attended Driver&#39;s Ed, tried some art or dance classes, or learned a sport that involved focused attention to a teacher, practice and some level of discipline as well as a time commitment.  And they&#39;ll have done it because this was what they wanted to do, it was the path they chose to reach their own goals, for their own fulfillment.  College really only works for people who want to be there.  I&#39;ve known lots of people who either didn&#39;t finish college because they were only going for someone else (myself included) or finished, but never pursued the career choice, again because going didn&#39;t fulfill them, it simply fulfilled someone else&#39;s plan for them.  <br/>
 <br/>
For now, just relax with your new baby.  Respond to his needs with love, watch him with amazement, sniff his head (better than any other sensory experience I&#39;ve ever had) laugh with him, watch him become who he is meant to be.  That&#39;s how unschooling works, and nothing that right can ever be insufficient for your child&#39;s future.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Marty just finished driver&#39;s ed.<br/>
<br/>
For him and Kirby both, driver&#39;s ed was the first formal classroom situation <br/>
they&#39;d had.  (Well Marty did a junior police academy for a week and there were <br/>
a couple of note-taking times, and Marty is on the souvenir videotape they <br/>
gave the kids taking his notes &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
The had no problem showing up early, prepared, taking notes, participating in <br/>
class or driving.<br/>
<br/>
Their problem (and quite minor) was taking a multiple choice test, where they <br/>
were to put their answers on another sheet of paper.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know and you all know that such a situation would look like this:<br/>
<br/>
1. a<br/>
2. a<br/>
3. c<br/>
4. d<br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty didn&#39;t know that. <br/>
<br/>
Kirby wrote his answers out, so when others were done, he was still writing.  <br/>
The teacher said &quot;writing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So Marty knew from that not to write the answers out.<br/>
<br/>
What Marty didn&#39;t know was each question will only have ONE answer.<br/>
<br/>
So he went <br/>
<br/>
1. a, c, d<br/>
2. b<br/>
3. a<br/>
<br/>
So he had three wrong where there was only one item! &lt;g&gt;  (It was just a <br/>
pre-test, nothing binding or important, but even the final test was one that could <br/>
be retaken twice if necessary, and they both passed.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty had read the question wrong, and was indicating what you DID need to <br/>
have in the car when driving, instead of marking what you didn&#39;t need to have <br/>
(the car title).<br/>
<br/>
All those years of no preparation, and that was that.<br/>
<br/>
They were both able to do theiere making appointments a month or two out in <br/>
the future.  Marty could go at noon; no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them, too, were MUCH better at asking question in class and caring <br/>
about the answer; they were better at participating when there was something <br/>
interesting to do (like get into the cab of a semi, which Kirby did without <br/>
hesitation, but the other kids were too cool to want to do).<br/>
<br/>
We were at the museum&#39;s star show the other night, in one of those cool domed <br/>
theaters where the chairs all recline and the stars are projected, and move <br/>
around.   The narrator was talking about the phase of the moon and the <br/>
positions of the planets, and said, about the angles and moon-shadowing, &quot;So which way <br/>
are we facing?&quot; and Marty said clearly, loudly and without hesitation &quot;Up!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It got a good laugh. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Did you know that it&#39;s ok NOT to go to college, just<br/>

7 weeks any more than I would be planning for him to<br/>
work or be married, or will be know how to fit into<br/>
his retirement home if he&#39;s never been<br/>

let him live himself, and all the rest will take care<br/>

Sylvia, I totally agree with you. I plan on letting my son be who he <br/>

support, whether or not he wants to go to college. I just want to be <br/>
fully prepared for the future for all options he will have so I won&#39;t <br/>
be caught off-guard at the last minute and end up failing him as his <br/>
mother and his &quot;educator&quot; (maybe &quot;encourager&quot; is a better word) <br/>
because I didn&#39;t find out in advance what *I* needed to know for his <br/>
benefit, YKWIM? I could think of nothing more heart-breaking than my <br/>
teenage son coming to me and saying he wanted to go to college but he <br/>
can&#39;t because of something I didn&#39;t do or something I did wrong, when <br/>
I could have done my &quot;homework&quot; long beforehand.<br/>
I am enjoying every moment with him right now, of course, he&#39;s my <br/>
angel. :) But I&#39;m also always looking ahead, to make sure he was a <br/>
bright future that *I* won&#39;t screw up by not knowing what the heck <br/>
I&#39;m doing.<br/>

Hi Lauren!<br/>
When I first read your post, I thought your son was 7 YEARS old, and while it <br/>
was early to be worrying about college, I figured he was recently school-aged <br/>
and people were bugging you about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When I realized that he was only 7 WEEKS old, I laughed and thought, &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
been a while since Lauren has taken a nap.&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
Lauren, first, you have so much time and so many things you&#39;ll be able to <br/>
worry about before you get to worrying about college. The first time your little <br/>
one gets a cold, or rolls off the bed, etc. Try to stay in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
That said, my 14 year old unschooled son recently took a very challenging <br/>
college course for fun. It involved lots of writing, which he&#39;d hardly done at <br/>
all. It also involved a heavy load of reading. He did great, mostly because he <br/>
really cared about the class, found it interesting, and was doing it because HE <br/>
wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
So, don&#39;t worry. And kiss your wee one for us folks whose babies have gotten <br/>
REALLY big.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815567108">Lauren - the best thing you can do for your baby is be FULLY in his  <br/>
present -- not be living in the future.<br/>
<br/>
By the time he is college age things may have changed dramatically,  <br/>
anyway. Distance education, a la carte college courses, internships,  <br/>
all kinds of new innovations in college education will have happened.  <br/>
Things we can&#39;t even imagine, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooled kids go to college all the time. It is common. I have two  <br/>
unschooled kids now going to college.<br/>
<br/>
I know you just want to do right by your son, but you&#39;re on the wrong  <br/>
track, worrying now about things that are so far in the future. How  <br/>
about, instead, you spend some time reading things that will help you  <br/>
in the upcoming years of his young childhood? The first book that comes  <br/>
to mind is:  &quot;The Hurried Child&quot; by David Elkind. I think you might be  <br/>
in danger of becoming an overanxious and/or pushy parent as he gets  <br/>
older. Maybe I&#39;m all wrong on that - but I still think you ought to  <br/>
read that book, now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039725783">Thanks everybody! I&#39;ve seen some of the exact reasons why unschooling <br/>
is best for my child.<br/>
I&#39;ve printed out some of this to give my husband to read during his <br/>
morning commute, just to reassure him that we are doing the right <br/>
thing.<br/>
Although my husband tries to be supportive of my unschooling ideas, <br/>
we were both educated in public school systems and his clinging to <br/>
vestiges of conventionality prey upon my own belief that we have <br/>
chosen the best course for our child. This type of exchange <br/>
reinforces my convictions!<br/>
<br/>
Our DD will be 4 in a few weeks. She asks intelligent questions and <br/>
always tries to figure out how things work. She understands that for <br/>
every action there is a reaction. This is true of social situations, <br/>
as well as the more physical or mechanical processes. I am fully <br/>
confident that by presenting her with situations that interest her, <br/>
she will continue to grow and develop an understanding of what she <br/>
wants to do with her own life.<br/>
Oh, she&#39;s not very concerned with getting places on time because she <br/>
is off in her &quot;Imagi-Nation&quot; (a magical place), but that will change <br/>
as she realizes that you can miss some fun things if you don&#39;t get <br/>
out of the house!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy every moment. Listen to and learn from your child. It is an <br/>
amazing adventure.</div>

**Hi Lauren - That&#39;s just not possible.  There are no guarantees.  <br/>
Instead of worrying about giving him a &quot;bright future&quot;, live a bright<br/>
today with him. Then no matter what tomorrow brings, he will have a<br/>
foundation that will support him throughout his life. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last night Marty (15) and I had gone out for him to practice driving.  We <br/>
drove around for two hours and went to least-busy freeway entrances for him to <br/>
practice merging.   <br/>
<br/>
On the way home he was talking about college.  He&#39;s planning to be a <br/>
policeman.  He said he doesn&#39;t know what might be good to take besides chemistry, in <br/>
case he wanted to go into forensics.   I told him freshmen often take an <br/>
assortment of beginning classes just to see what strikes them as especially <br/>
interesting, and maybe he should do that.  He asked if there are any classes everyone <br/>
is required to take.  I said English 101 and 102, probably, and otherwise it <br/>
depended whether they were going into the arts/humanities, or the sciences (and <br/>
I gave him some examples of those).  He said he thought law might help.<br/>
<br/>
I said he might consider psychology, sociology, New Mexico history, maybe <br/>
political science and economics, and see what he liked, but that intro courses in <br/>
any of those would help him with concepts and terminology he would come <br/>
across.  Physics would probably be helpful no matter whether he did basic police <br/>
work, forensics, bomb squad--but anything involving investigations or firearms <br/>
could use knowledge of physics.  I forgot to mention driving and <br/>
accident-related stuff. I&#39;ll bring that up next time we&#39;re out alone.<br/>
<br/>
It was a really calm conversation.  I told him there was no rush, he didn&#39;t <br/>
have to get a degree to learn the things.   I told him he didn&#39;t need to stick <br/>
with one job all his life either.  He said maybe after he&#39;d been in police <br/>
work a while, he might rather go on to law.<br/>
<br/>
It all sounds good, but I won&#39;t hold him to any of it.  I&#39;ve seen too many <br/>
families where a kid mentioned one desire or interest and the family practically <br/>
tattooed it on his forehead and wouldn&#39;t shake loose of it.    Sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
just a passing fancy.  Sometimes it might have been a lifelong pursuit if <br/>
someone hadn&#39;t commandeered it.<br/>
<br/>
So I want to leave Marty&#39;s ideas in Marty&#39;s domain and not take charge of <br/>
them.  I&#39;ll help him, and I&#39;m paying attention, but I don&#39;t want to back him into <br/>
a corner, or whine later, &quot;You said you wanted to go to college&quot; or &quot;What <br/>
happened to being a policeman?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When he was just starting to drive I had a hard time describing to him how to <br/>
hold the steering wheel when coming back to straight from a turn.  It was not <br/>
&quot;let go of it&quot; but it sure wasn&#39;t &quot;hold it tight and put it where you want <br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was right between &quot;hold it&quot; and &quot;let it go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where I am with Marty and his interests and future.  I&#39;m neither hands <br/>
on nor hands off.  I&#39;m hands near.<br/>
<br/>
The example I came up with was rappelling, which he learned to do at a junior <br/>
police academy, and which he&#39;s done on a climbing wall at the Santa Fe <br/>
children&#39;s museum too.   You neither hold the rope tight all the time nor just let <br/>
go of it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; He could probably get a good idea by using the internet to look at a <br/>
college with police training.  They will often list the coursework required <br/>
throughout the 4 years, and he can look into some of it from there, should <br/>
he maintain interest. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good idea.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I was also told tonight that TVI, our local trade-school/jr.collegish thing, <br/>
has an associate&#39;s degree in police work, so maybe he could look at those too!<br/>
<br/>
I really hesitate to channel him, and if he goes to regular general intro <br/>
classes he might find something he likes better, but I&#39;ll suggest he could look <br/>
around on the net (rather than deliver it into his lap myself).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, Pam, you are, and I find it upsetting that you would make such a <br/>
judgment call on my character when you don&#39;t know a thing about me <br/>
except for a few typed words on a screen. I&#39;m sure you mean well, but <br/>
you are way off base. I have already stated that I will allow my son <br/>
to do whatever he wants to do, but I really don&#39;t feel I should have <br/>
to explain my own parenting techniques or family values, or my <br/>
reasons for them, to complete strangers. <br/>
I have asked the question in a pretty straightforward manner, twice. <br/>
Yet I have not gotten a single logical answer. All I *have* gotten <br/>
are lectures and judgments on the possible *reasons* for my question, <br/>
unsolicited advice on how to better appreciate and/or raise my own <br/>
child, and people telling me that my *own* feelings on what I should <br/>
personally find &quot;heart-breaking&quot; are wrong--none of which has <br/>
*anything* to do with the question itself. What is SO difficult about <br/>
just answering a simple question, as opposed to over-analyzing and <br/>
worrying about and lecturing about the WHY of it? It&#39;s enough to <br/>
drive a person mad, it&#39;s very frustrating, I feel like I&#39;m trying to <br/>
reason with a brick wall, and I don&#39;t understand or appreciate the <br/>
treatment I&#39;ve received here. Is this how all new members are treated <br/>
when they ask questions of the group? If so, I&#39;ll gladly take my <br/>
leave.<br/>
<br/>
Really, is there someone, anyone, who would PLEASE take the question <br/>
at face value and please give me an answer? PLEASE??<br/>
<br/>
Let me simplify this even more so maybe it&#39;ll be easier to give a <br/>
straight answer: As it stands today, right now, what proof do <br/>
home/unschooled individuals provide to show that they have had an <br/>
education? Do they get a GED or a high-school equivalency diploma <br/>
issued by their state, or is there something else that is done? Some <br/>
jobs and educational institutions require a &quot;high school diploma or <br/>
equivalent&quot;. So what do you have to show them when you&#39;ve been <br/>
home/unschooled? Your word alone isn&#39;t enough, there has to be <br/>
*tangible proof*. So what do you do?<br/>
(In the United States, I mean--North Carolina more specifically, if <br/>
that helps.)</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; teenage son coming to me and saying he wanted to go to college but <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can&#39;t because of something I didn&#39;t do or something I did wrong, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What could possibly be something you didn&#39;t do, or did wrong that <br/>
would prevent him from doing something he wants?  What couldn&#39;t he <br/>
learn or do now that he&#39;s a teenager.  If something is needed and a <br/>
true desire is there, things get done.<br/>
As your child grows, you will see how amazing children are.  How <br/>
brilliant they are.  My children are my inspiration.  I want to be <br/>
like them and I learn from them, real lessons that help me become a <br/>
better person.  When they are so tiny, we feel this awesome <br/>
responsibility to protect and nuture, and it can feel overwhelming.<br/>
This little human being is ours, and it&#39;s completely up to us to do <br/>
this right.  But, as they grow, if you really look at them, and honor <br/>
them, you realize how little control you really have.  And the sooner <br/>
you let go of trying to control, the sooner you get to a peaceful <br/>
life.<br/>
Control is about fear.  Trust is about love.<br/>
I wish I had known that from the beginning.<br/>
I spent the first half of my son Sam&#39;s life being a controlling <br/>
parent.  Worrying about him turning out right and making so many <br/>
decisions based on fear.  I spent the last half of his life learning <br/>
to let go, to value who he IS, not who he will be.  I came to realize <br/>
the &#39;now&#39; was important and when I truely understood that, our life <br/>
became joyful.  He was always joyful and I sometimes can&#39;t understand <br/>
how I could have wasted our time by not really appreciating it.<br/>
By worrying about what others thought, worrying about expectations, <br/>
worrying about being the perfect parent.  What a waste.<br/>
My SIL was over the other day.  She was looking at my daughter Jamie. <br/>
She asked &quot;So, are you going through that 4 year old stage with her?&quot;<br/>
Then she told about a friend of hers who&#39;s having a hard time with <br/>
her 4yo.  I had forgotten about how life can be with a young child, <br/>
when control is a big part of your life.  I rarely say &#39;no&#39; to Jamie, <br/>
or my other kids.  I don&#39;t worry they will turn out to be spoiled <br/>
brats or treat me like a door mat.  I know what kind of relationship <br/>
you get, when you go for happiness over anything else.  <br/>
I have a 13yo and she is one of the coolest human beings I have ever <br/>
known.  How lucky am I, that she lives in my house!  I know that <br/>
giving her the freedom to be who she is has helped keep the most <br/>
precious part of her intact.<br/>
Living in the now, is really the most importatn lesson to learn in <br/>
this life.  It&#39;s the only thing that is real, tangent.<br/>
Yesterday is a memory and tomorrow is an idea.<br/>
Sam died right before his 9th birthday.  He would be 10 today.<br/>
He fell through the ice on a pond last winter.<br/>
Even I can think of things more heartbreaking than that.<br/>

future Pa is preparing Laura for.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And it wasn&#39;t even true. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trains went from station to station.   When people were moving to ranches, <br/>
they still had to use wagons to get their stuff there, up to the time when <br/>
trucks and pavement made horses obsolete.  But there wer still many decades of <br/>
overlap.  My grandmother&#39;s family moved to and from a ranch near Carizozo, New <br/>
Mexico, without trucks.  Covered wagon, herding cattle, riding horses.  There <br/>
wasn&#39;t a road a truck could&#39;ve gone on anyway.   And they dug their own well.  <br/>
Well drilling equipment was invented, but it took roads and trucks.<br/>
<br/>
Northern New Mexico (my grandmother was in SE N.Mex.) has ranches still that <br/>
can&#39;t be accessed well.  Mountains create problems of their own.  So if you <br/>
have a child who&#39;s interested in ranching, he will still to this day need to <br/>
have horseback skills--unless he&#39;s in some flatland where ATVs will do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She didn&#39;t <br/>
live a life that looked like Pa&#39;s, and neither can we foresee the lives <br/>
our kids will live or the challenges they&#39;ll face.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That is hugely true.<br/>
<br/>
The same year my grandmother was bemoaning the fact that I couldn&#39;t (at nine <br/>
years old) milk a cow or use a fountain pen (this was 1963), my 4th grade <br/>
teacher told us that SOMEday there would be calculators small enough to hold in <br/>
our hands, and they would cost less than $200 (I think was her figure).    <br/>
RIGHT, thought I.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have free-to-cheap solar- and battery-powered calculators scattered <br/>
around my house, I can use a fountain pen, or cartridge, or dip-pen, and I still <br/>
can&#39;t milk a cow.  But I&#39;m composing this writing on a computer my 4th grade <br/>
teacher wouldn&#39;t have imagined could be in a private home so soon after the <br/>
fantasy of the hand-held electronic calculator.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So the moral is:  don&#39;t waste your energy worrying about 15 years from now.  <br/>
We can&#39;t really see it from here.  We just see 2004 15 years older, and our <br/>
vision will be wrong. Worry about having a child who is confident and happy.   <br/>
He&#39;ll figure out the future on his own.<br/>
