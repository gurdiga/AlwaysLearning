<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141273871">&lt;&lt; Have any of you <br/>
folks thought about what if your kids are gay or lesbian? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When you talk to <br/>
them about potential mates or futures, do you use exclusively heterosexual <br/>
terms?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lately, but not earlier.<br/>
And we ALWAYS leave open the possibility that they won&#39;t partner up or marry <br/>
at all.  We don&#39;t say &quot;When you get married&quot; but &quot;if you were to...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Would it bother you if your child WERE gay or lesbian. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
When the boys were babies Keith and I used to joke that we might as well give <br/>
up the old American sterotypes and go with the new stats--that one of them <br/>
would be gay and one would marry an Asian.   New Mexico has more mixed <br/>
marriages than most other places in the world, probably, so very little would <br/>
surprise or dismay us.  It dismayed and surprised me that I married an anglo, <br/>
after my first several serious boyfriends who weren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It helped the discussions that we had a very pink neighbor boy.    At first <br/>
we only knew his mom.  Later I met his dad and his dad&#39;s partner.  I think <br/>
there was a genetic factor.  The best quote about the neighbor came from <br/>
Kirby when he was five or so.  He had expressed some jealous irritation that <br/>
it seemed that the boy was particularly liking a girl across the street, and <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t play with Kirby as much.  I said without thinking &quot;I didn&#39;t <br/>
think AJ liked girls.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With all honest plainness, Kirby said, &quot;Of course he likes girls.  Why else <br/>
would he want to be Kimberly when we play Power Rangers?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t crack up.  Not right then.  I still crack up sometimes now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a deep topic knocking at the inside of my skull, trying to find its<br/>
way out.  This seems like a good list for it, as it certainly falls under<br/>
&quot;Always Learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a program on The Discovery Channel called &quot;Assignment: Discovery.&quot;<br/>
We watch it in the morning, and often use it as a jumping-off point for<br/>
discussion, a trip to the library, etc.  This week, the topic has been human<br/>
genetics.  One day, they showed the separated twins research that has been<br/>
going on for many years.  It shows how the personality, as well as physical<br/>
traits, are inherited: two girls, for instance, one raised in wealth and<br/>
with the &quot;best&quot; parenting, the other in poverty and neglect, nonetheless<br/>
developed the same mental pathologies and learning disablilities.<br/>
Upbringing had nothing to do with it.  And so on.<br/>
<br/>
What was surprising to the researchers was that separated twins very often<br/>
had the same spiritual leanings.  Two women in Britain, for instance, who<br/>
were not raised in it, chose Evangelical Christianity as adults.<br/>
<br/>
My mom was raised in a Seventh-Day Adventist home, but was never baptized;<br/>
the minister said she had &quot;too many questions.&quot;  Her mother was horrified<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Much later in life (about 20 years ago), my mom learned that her father<br/>
was, er, not her father.  Her mother had gotten pregnant at age 14 by a 22<br/>
y.o. (she&#39;d lied about her age to him), and he fled to Mexico.  After<br/>
learning about her true paternity, mom went hunting for him.  She finally<br/>
tracked down the right man, too late to meet him before his death, but did<br/>
find her half-brother.  She learned that her real dad was a Religious<br/>
Scientist -- as she had been since her 30&#39;s.  That is not a common religion;<br/>
it seems unlikely mere coincidence would draw them to the same beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a very religious person since my late teens, but also prone to<br/>
depression.  During those periods, God simply disappears.  No contact, no<br/>
faith, no desire for Him.  He simply no longer exists.  My husband became<br/>
very depressed a couple of years ago, and stopped going to church; he put<br/>
it, &quot;Church doesn&#39;t do it for me anymore.&quot;  I&#39;ve known other religious<br/>
people who &quot;lose their faith&quot; during depression.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are people who never need faith of any kind, it seems.  In my<br/>
husband&#39;s family, there are a few religious people, and a number of those<br/>
who are either indifferent, atheists, or rationalists.  There are also a<br/>
number of scientists; in my family visual artists dominate, and the missing<br/>
grandfather, as it turns out, was a photographer with a wild sense of humor<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  That explains a lot :-)<br/>
<br/>
The questions rattling in my head are -- Does faith depend on heredity?  Is<br/>
there a brain structure or function which governs &quot;God&quot;?  If a person who is<br/>
religious can become an atheist because of depression, does it mean that<br/>
faith, or the perception of God, or spirituality, is controlled by some<br/>
function of the brain, which depression interrupts?  Do closed societies<br/>
(the Amish, for instance) maintain their religion because the propensity to<br/>
it is inherited?  Is there a &quot;God gene&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If the answer to any of that is &quot;yes,&quot; does it mean that God does not exist,<br/>
that our perceptions are delusions which plague some but not others, or does<br/>
it mean he/she/it *does* exist, and has created these structures or<br/>
functions in order to have contact with us?  And does it mean that those<br/>
without the capacity to perceive him are damned?  Or, if he is just, that<br/>
those without the gene are equally saved without religion, since it would be<br/>
unfair otherwise?  (I&#39;m using saved and damned in a general sense, as most<br/>
religions promise some kind of reward for participation.)<br/>
<br/>
And what of religions that practice meditation, or use drugs sacramentally?<br/>
My religion&#39;s hagiography is replete with saints whose visions could be just<br/>
as easily described as hallucinations; were they just nuts, or can severe<br/>
fasting account for them?<br/>
<br/>
Something to ponder at this season of The Incarnation ;-)<br/>

<br/>
There was a big article about this very thing (minus the depression issue, <br/>
but still--) in Time Magazine in May or so this year.<br/>
<br/>
They asked the very same question you did:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If the answer to any of that is &quot;yes,&quot; does it mean that God does not exist,<br/>
that our perceptions are delusions which plague some but not others, or does<br/>
it mean he/she/it *does* exist, and has created these structures or<br/>
functions in order to have contact with us?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They tested praying nuns and meditating monks and the same part of the brain <br/>
was &quot;lighting up&quot; as it were (in their test-jazz, however they had them wired <br/>
up with EKG or whatever it was.  And they talked about sudden epiphanies and <br/>
brain damage and suchlike.<br/>
<br/>
Those who know &quot;ecstacy&quot; can sometimes induce it in themselves.  And there <br/>
are similarities in lots of religions--chanting (om or Amen) and swaying and <br/>
closed-eye, humming, singing, rhythmic stuff.    People have said it calls <br/>
God down.  &quot;God is here with us&quot; they say in revivals.  &quot;The house of the <br/>
Lord--Amen.&quot;  And people start swaying.  And with the professionals having <br/>
primed the pump, it&#39;s not as hard as on a normal day for the amateurs to <br/>
commune with God.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been thinking.<br/>
