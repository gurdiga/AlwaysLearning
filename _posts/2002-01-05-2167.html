<div id="ygrps-yiv-768600052">Hey Tia, Jacli here :)<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you have already found some games or not<br/>
but I read <br/>
this and thought MYST immediately.  Myst was a series of<br/>
games <br/>
that were full of beautiful graphics and puzzles and clues.<br/>
 It almost<br/>
reminds me of detective type gaming.  It does include<br/>
reading as well.<br/>
Also, Atlantis - though I am not sure if this is still<br/>
available or not.<br/>
Also, Journeyman time traveler games.  Myst is set in<br/>
islands and Journeyman<br/>
travels all over the world and through time.  On a lighter<br/>
note there are the <br/>
Abes Oddworld games which include a certain amount of<br/>
reading and are<br/>
just hysterical.  Probably one of the best ways to find out<br/>
what the new games<br/>
entail is to pickup a copy of PcGamer at your nearest<br/>
electronics/video game store.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have listed a few sites that can maybe help you<br/>
find what you seek-<br/>
happy gaming!<br/>

after that you can choose from a wide variety of games. We have on ours the Greek <br/>
gods, the solar system, US states, organs of the body and presidents. I <br/>
actually enjoy quizzing myself on it, too.<br/>

<br/>
Have you looked at Neopets?  There&#39;s a fairy-land but I don&#39;t play any fairy <br/>
games except the Wheel of [whatever, Excitement?] which costs points so avoid <br/>
that unless you the mom want to earn her some points to play it.<br/>
<br/>
There are pattern games that need no reading except &quot;send score&quot; or &quot;play <br/>
again&quot; at the end, I think.   You&#39;d have to set her up in it probably, but <br/>
DestructoMatch is a kind of reverse Tetris (you click on blocks where the colors are <br/>
matching), and she could play Sutek&#39;s Tomb if you set it to Zen mode (which <br/>
takes the timer off).  That&#39;s another pattern-search game, and kinda pretty <br/>
too.  I guess the bad thing is on zen mode the game never finishes. &lt;g&gt;  But she <br/>
could go to a certain number of points and call that a win if she likes to win.<br/>
<br/>
Kiko Match is good, but there&#39;s a timer.  Maybe she could point and you could <br/>
click.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655069454">Hello all :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a now-and-again lurker chiming in to say our 13 year old girlie enjoys<br/>
Club Penguin online(www.clubpenguin.com). There&#39;s alot you can do free and<br/>
then there&#39;s a $5.95/monthly membership that opens the world up even more.<br/>
The girlie here has been enjoying Club Penguin for a bit over a year now.<br/>
She likes to stay up late on the days new stuff is released--apparently the<br/>
site is England-based so at midnight &#39;our time&#39;, it&#39;s morning &#39;over there&#39;<br/>
and the new stuff is out. I think that happens monthly? Not sure, it&#39;s been<br/>
awhile since she wanted to stay up that late since we&#39;ve been babysitting<br/>
this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Sims has also been popular with her lately, before that it was Diner Dash<br/>
and lots of spinoffs from it...those are on several freebie sites. A Google<br/>
search should bring it up.<br/>
<br/>
She used to really enjoy the Zoombinis and Carmen SanDiego games as well.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
