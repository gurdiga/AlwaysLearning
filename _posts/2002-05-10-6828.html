<br/>
Yes, but it was fictional music.  Meaning the songs they sang (even Edelweiss <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) were written for the musical, by New Yorkers for New Yorkers.<br/>
<br/>
They lived in Vermont for a long time.  They were largely responsible for the <br/>
introduction of the recorder (wooden fipple flute) to the U.S.  It had died <br/>
out after the Renaissance, but was revived in Germany in the early 20th <br/>
century, and the Trapps aided in bringing it here.  The staple of all <br/>
recorder method books is The Trapp Family Book.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere I have (or used to have, I haven&#39;t spotted it lately) a book about <br/>
holiday celebrations, with some recipes and some this&#39;n&#39;that by Maria von <br/>
Trapp.  I got it used and dusty, years ago.<br/>
<br/>
She was very religious and very strict.  Some of the kids are still living <br/>
(or were a few years ago).  <br/>
<br/>
I used to know more about how much of the story was fictionalized, but I&#39;m <br/>
not sure enough to say now.  I&#39;m sure you could find info on it at <br/>
google.com, and People Magazine had an article last month or maybe March <br/>
about the actors who did the kids in the movie and what they&#39;re doing now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762555159">I saw a show on them on biography, I think....it was<br/>
pretty bad.  She was a pretty poor mother, I gather,<br/>
and when a child wanted to marry and move away, she<br/>
never spoke to them again.  Many more horrible things.<br/>
I wish I hadn&#39;t watched, as I loved Julie Andrews as<br/>
the fictional Maria, and it kind of spoiled the movie<br/>
for me!<br/>

It&#39;s run by the son Maria was pregnant with (child #10) when they escaped<br/>
Austria. (It says he&#39;s president so he probably isn&#39;t there much. Though it<br/>
mentions Rosemarie von Trapp does singalongs with kids.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a Trapp Family on line museum:<br/>

<br/>
which is more of a biography but nonetheless interesting. (Don&#39;t worry, Ren,<br/>
since it&#39;s written by the family it won&#39;t shatter any of your images, just<br/>
enhance them!)<br/>
