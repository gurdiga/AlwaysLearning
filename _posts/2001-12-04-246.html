<br/>
When I was in college, I had a fantastic literature professor.  Basically,<br/>
we just sat around and discussed lit and at the end of the term we were<br/>
supposed to write a paper.  True to form, I waited until after Thanksgiving<br/>
to even think about the paper.  I picked a poem by John Donne, thinking<br/>
surely nobody reads this guy.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out my professor did his dissertation on Donne  :(<br/>
<br/>
He wrote across my paper  &quot;You completely missed the point...B-&quot;.  I<br/>
understood that he liked my writing well enough to pass me but thought I<br/>
didn&#39;t understand the poem.  I found it a challenge, learned more about<br/>
Donne and found out that hey I like to read this guy.<br/>
