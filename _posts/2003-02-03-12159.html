Philadelphia Recruits and Trains Parents as Truant Officers<br/>
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HILADELPHIA, Jan. 29  In an effort to corral thousands of class-cutting<br/>
students, the Philadelphia school district hired 250 truant officers late<br/>
last year.<br/>
Among its hiring criteria for the job, one element loomed most important:<br/>
the district specifically recruited parents.<br/>
&quot;Parents know the terrain, know the environment, understand the culture<br/>
and may even know some of the individual parents and kids,&quot; said Paul<br/>
Vallas, chief executive of the 200,000-student school system.<br/>
Truancy is a big concern in Philadelphia. On any given day, more than<br/>
12,000 Philadelphia students, or 6.4 percent, are absent without an<br/>
excuse.<br/>
The problem worries school officials because truants are more likely to<br/>
use drugs, join gangs, commit crimes or drop out.<br/>
&quot;Truancy is our first best flag that a kid will enter the juvenile<br/>
justice system,&quot; said Ken Seeley, who is studying the effectiveness of<br/>
seven truancy reduction programs for the Justice Department.<br/>
Mr. Vallas hired 600 parents for a similar program in Chicago, where he<br/>
headed the school system for six years. He said the program cut truancy<br/>
to 3.9 percent from 5.7 percent.<br/>
Philadelphia contracted with 12 community and religious organizations to<br/>
hire and train parent-truant officers. The training began last month; so<br/>
far, 166 parents have gone through the program and started visiting the<br/>
homes of truants. The officers are paid $9 an hour for at least 10 hours<br/>
a week.<br/>
&quot;The primary role is to inform parents that their child has been truant,<br/>
that resources are available, that we are ready to help,&quot; said Vern<br/>
Trent, who heads the program.<br/>
While it is too soon to tell whether the $1.2 million program is working,<br/>
the officers had more than 1,600 contacts with parents through Dec. 31.<br/>
Some parents are unaware that their children are cutting class. Others<br/>
cannot afford clothes or bus tokens. Others are on drugs or alcohol.<br/>
Hastings Coach, who heads the parent-truant officer program for the<br/>
Women&#39;s Association for Women&#39;s Alternatives, a social services agency,<br/>
said officers were told to be supportive and understanding, not<br/>
threatening.<br/>
&quot;Any time you&#39;re in someone&#39;s home, you&#39;re a guest and you have to<br/>
conduct yourself accordingly. You&#39;re not some authority with a stiff<br/>
hand. You want to be invited back,&quot; Mr. Coach said.<br/>
But officers also explain that chronic absenteeism could land both<br/>
students and their parents in the truancy court, with the possibility of<br/>
fines, community service and even jail for the adults and transfer to an<br/>
alternative school for the pupils.<br/>
That is smart, Mr. Seeley said, because any successful truancy-reduction<br/>
program needs to have both carrots and sticks. In Jacksonville, Fla., one<br/>
of the programs he is studying, more than 100 parents have been arrested<br/>
for failing to send their children to school.<br/>
Jennifer Jones, 42, whose children are 6, 16 and 19, said Philadelphia&#39;s<br/>
truancy program was a natural fit for her. Her house is a magnet for<br/>
neighborhood children; she has been known to break up fistfights; even<br/>
before she became a truant officer, she confronted truants and ordered<br/>
them to go back to school.<br/>
And because her own children are sometimes less than enthusiastic about<br/>
school, she understands how some parents have trouble making sure theirs<br/>
go to class.<br/>
&quot;I think people feel more comfortable dealing with another parent,&quot; Ms.<br/>
Jones said. &quot;Parents know what kids are capable of, how their minds<br/>
work.&quot;<br/>

A week ago I told Keith this group has 200 members.  Then I happened by the <br/>

a little embarrassed and dopily pleased that I could have been so wrong.  <br/>

<br/>
WOW.  <br/>
Couldn&#39;t they just use that money to pay kids to come to class!?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s what the schools should do.  Just like the army.  Pay the damned <br/>
kids.  Let them build up some post-graduation benefits.  Give raises for <br/>
excellent attention spans (OR WHATEVER...)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a GREAT idea!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d get so much by just showing up and being minimally cooperative and<br/>
decent to the other kids and teachers.   You&#39;d get more if your level of<br/>
participation was more.   <br/>
They could make it better and give free tickets to rock concerts to kids<br/>
who go all the time.<br/>
That way, if a kid did pick up some useful information there it&#39;d be a<br/>
bonus, but at the very least they&#39;d have some money and entertainment. <br/>
Of course the little deviants would just spend it on drugs and create<br/>
false identities to get a second pay check and scalp the tickets for<br/>
astronomical amounts of money.    Those kids could get the special<br/>
entrepreneurial  award and be emancipated!  <br/>

More evidence of the &quot;us and them&quot; mentality some adults have toward kids.  <br/>
If they knew I had suggested pouring ice water on an adult they would be <br/>
stunned, or assume the suggestion had come from a kid.  <br/>

Holly&#39;s watching Saqua (sp?) in the other room.  The kitten wanted to watch <br/>

up.  The show involved the simple &quot;fact&quot; that some things cannot happen until <br/>
you&#39;re older.  That seeing the fireflies is really wonderful, but it&#39;s not <br/>

He gets to see them but only after a day of hard labor and ridicule, having <br/>
to clean up after kittens to prove he&#39;s &quot;a cat,&quot; and other us/them nonsense.  <br/>
<br/>
I was telling Holly to turn it off because it was about mean parents.  She <br/>
was laughing and saying she wanted to see the firefly part because it was <br/>
cool.  I said the parents should just let him stay up.  She said &quot;I know.&quot;   <br/>

So it goes, even on programs designed for peaceful well-loved kids by adults <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018427629">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that most of this is socialization. Sadly, many<br/>
people that may not realize they are socializing the kids are, in reality,<br/>
doing just that.<br/>
The powers that be are raising consumers and victims, not thinkers!<br/>
When I put Brianna in public school, for grade 1, it was hell! She didn&#39;t<br/>
have the same &#39;values&#39; the kids in class had. One of the girls told her that<br/>
she should have blonde highlights in her hair, that she would be &quot;hot&quot;.<br/>
A boy told her she was too tall to be pretty,<br/>
She was told that I was a bad parent because I worked from home.<br/>
She was told that I was a lesbian because I have no husband.<br/>
She didn&#39;t dress right. They made fun of her.<br/>
She&#39;s not a Christian. They hit her.<br/>
<br/>
Her lunch menu for the month was an advertisement for Frito-Lay.<br/>
Her teacher was out of work from the day before Thanksgiving until the<br/>
beginning of the last quarter. Many of those days, the class watched Disney<br/>
movies. Brianna came home one day and told me that a boy in class was<br/>
hitting everyone. When I asked about it, the substitute teacher said, &quot;Boys<br/>
will be boys&quot; When I said she would be defending herself. I was told, &quot;Two<br/>
wrongs don&#39;t make a right&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When she passed in a paper on the Cherokee People, she wasn&#39;t graded. The<br/>
teacher said she hadn&#39;t done it. There was too much information and too many<br/>
Cherokee words. (My clan sister, her aunt, is Cherokee.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about making us little consumers and blindly obedient &#39;citizens&#39;. I<br/>
am appalled at the &#39;victimization&#39; of kids. The schools actually give them a<br/>
&#39;victim&#39; mind set.<br/>
Sorry if I got carried away!<br/>
Janis<br/>
BTW.don&#39;t even get me started about the Family Court system!! What I went<br/>
through to get Brianna in the first place!<br/>

An unschooler fell into my lap, sort of (via a move from the east coast) and<br/>
she had already made two unschooling friends, so it was a ready-made<br/>
unschooling family. ;)<br/>

I have to say it&#39;s really nice to have face-to-face people I can talk to,<br/>

<br/>
There used to be a homeschooling group that met in our neighborhood.  When <br/>
there was a statewide newsletter,  years ago, they listed.  So one day I took <br/>
Kirby and Marty, who were 5 and 2, I think, or a bit older.<br/>
<br/>
We walked up and first a mom showed us where the big girls were playing, and <br/>
where the little girls were, and then where the bigger boys were and where <br/>
the little boys were.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;Play where you want to,&quot; even though it was <br/>
a public park.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I went to sit with the moms and was asked which curriculum I used, &quot;Bob <br/>
Jones, or ABeka?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Neither.<br/>
And there was a slightly perceptible but very real shoulder-shift among the <br/>
moms sitting there and I found myself not in the conversation and not in the <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
That was okay, because I looked up and saw Marty looking NOT happy, so I went <br/>
and hung out with my boys.  None of the moms were hanging out with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just a school thing, unfortunately.  It&#39;s a cultural thing.  These <br/>
Christian homeschoolers were totally into dividing girls from boys, and into <br/>
age divisions.  And into dividing adults from kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410331312">Today I was at a Destination Imagination event being held at a high <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
There was a sign in one of the rooms that said that people who graduate <br/>
from high school make about $236,000 more in income in their lifetime <br/>
than those who drop out. So - they took that number and divided by 4 <br/>
years of high school and said that meant that each year of high school <br/>
was worth $59,000. Then they divided that by 180 (number of school days <br/>
in a year) and said each day they went to school was worth $327.78. <br/>
Then they divided that by 6 (number of classes per day) and said each <br/>
class was worth $54.63.<br/>
<br/>
Then they said: &quot;Stay in school because where are you going to find a <br/>
job that pays $54.63/hour?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But - using the same starting point -- $236,000 extra dollars of income <br/>
over, say, 50 years, is only $4720 per year. Divided by 250 working <br/>
days in a year that is only $18.88 per day. Dividing that by 8 (8 hours <br/>
per day of work) that is only $2.36 per hour.<br/>
<br/>
So - starting with the EXACT same number and making the same kinds of <br/>
calculations, we show that spending years being tortured in school <br/>
results in an average gain of $2.36 per hour over a lifetime of <br/>
working? So - staying in school pays $2.36 per hour. What kind of <br/>
crummy job is that?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too bad the kids don&#39;t think outside the box a little -- or they&#39;d <br/>
learn some math while twisting the school&#39;s own propaganda against the <br/>
school itself.<br/>
