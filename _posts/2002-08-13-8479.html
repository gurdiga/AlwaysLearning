<div id="ygrps-yiv-685404157"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;... your taste buds grow and develop over your years,<br/>
&gt;and everyone&#39;s taste buds are different.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t forget about the magic of body chemistry.  A<br/>
person&#39;s body chemistry changes throughout their<br/>
lifetime and foods actually DO taste differently<br/>
depending on your body chemistry from one stage of<br/>
life to another.<br/>

Something totally unrelated:  Thomas is sitting here<br/>
under my chair talking about how the mechanism works<br/>
and why the chair can change heights.  While he was<br/>
down there, he looked up into the closet and saw his<br/>
dad&#39;s monopoly game on the shelf and said &quot;Mom, when<br/>
Dad gets home I want him to teach me how to play his<br/>
game &quot;Not Believe&quot;  Kids say the darndest things... <br/>

Lately Emily has been rude to me a few times and I&#39;ve talked to her about<br/>
respecting others, etc. The other day in a store, though, she really let a<br/>
remark fly and seemed to watch me to see how I reacted. I asked her why she<br/>
said that, and she chirped, &quot;I&#39;m trying to get on Kids Say The Darnedest<br/>
Things!&quot; She&#39;s been watching that show lately, obviously!<br/>
<br/>
So then we got to talk about tryouts, Bill Cosby&#39;s career, and how unlikely<br/>
he was to show up in Kohl&#39;s looking for applicants...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093216974">10:20 Holly was watching Simpson&#39;s and came and asked me to make her some <br/>
spinach.  I said okay and she said I was the nicest mom in the world.<br/>
<br/>
All we had was frozen and she&#39;s used to fresh.<br/>
She&#39;s never tasted canned.<br/>
<br/>
When it was nearly ready she was talking to me about how many minutes or <br/>
whatever, and I told her wait, I wasn&#39;t listening.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;You shouldn&#39;t ignore me, mom, because that will ruin my life and <br/>
I&#39;ll end up being mean to my kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s sharing her spinach with me now.  It&#39;s good!<br/>
