<div id="ygrps-yiv-196767454">Laura, your children are so young even it you were a traditional<br/>
homeschooler, you might not be using a curriculum yet.<br/>
<br/>
I would just say to people that you aren&#39;t rushing into using a curriculum<br/>
and right now they are learning from their activities.<br/>
<br/>
I also live in a small town where everyone knows us &lt;g&gt;. What I&#39;ve found is<br/>
that when I make my daughter&#39;s environment rich and full of fun and learning<br/>
opportunities, most people can see that and they often want to join in.<br/>
Which is a whole other kettle of fish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>
Anna (14) and Molly (12)<br/>

<br/>
Are you in a Bible Belt town full of fundamentalist Christians?<br/>
That would be the worst-case scenario.<br/>
<br/>
But if you are, and you lie or dodge, they&#39;ll eventually see you as  <br/>
worse than neglectful.<br/>
<br/>
For a while, at first, you could say &quot;We&#39;re creating our own as we  <br/>
go.&quot;   You could say &quot;We haven&#39;t decided, what do you use?&quot; and get  <br/>
them talking. Maybe in the course of that talk you could say &quot;Ah.   <br/>
Yeah, we don&#39;t plan to make her... [whatever they might be bragging  <br/>
about].&quot;   But brief answers, and light.<br/>
<br/>
If your unschooling goes well, if you really DO things so that no one  <br/>
could possibly see you as neglectful, then you will gain confidence  <br/>
and before many years you should be able to say &quot;We&#39;re unschoolers,  <br/>
and it has worked out really well for us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993167646">I find that when people are asking about curriculum, it&#39;s one of those questions that, even though they asked it, they really may not want to know too much detail about what you are doing.  Sometimes people are just making chit-chat, like talking about the weather.  Or, they may be just checking out if they can feel good about their own curriculum/school choice.  I think that everyone feels just a little insecure and what they are in effect asking is, `am I doing my best?&#39;<br/>
  <br/>
So I keep that in mind when I get that kind of question.  If it&#39;s a social gathering or casual meeting, I like to keep the conversation amicable, so I answer their question, but keep it light.  I carefully word things so as to draw attention to what is common between us and not to what is different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486881478">-=-I find that when people are asking about curriculum, it&#39;s one of  <br/>
those questions that, even though they asked it, they really may not  <br/>
want to know too much detail about what you are doing. Sometimes  <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes that chit-chat is like &quot;Where do you go to church?&quot;<br/>
Some people live where that would NOT be one of the first questions  <br/>
asked (or EVER asked).<br/>
<br/>
If someone lives in the &quot;where do you go to church&quot; area of the world  <br/>
and it&#39;s fringe (which extends pretty far out in the homeschooling  <br/>
edges in the U.S.) the question can be code for &quot;will we consider  <br/>
letting our children play with yours?&quot;   &quot;Are you one of us?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The most acceptable answers I know of in such a case are ABeka and  <br/>
Sonlight.  Creationist, revisionist, sheltering things.<br/>
And within those communities there are further divisions.  How do you  <br/>
feel about the age at which a person should be baptized?  Some people  <br/>
will have nothing to do with the infant baptism type.  And AS they are  <br/>
all creationists (rejecting evolution), but as they are accustomed to  <br/>
arguing and rejecting others based on belief, those who believe the  <br/>
earth was created in six days not so long ago will reject those who  <br/>
think it was created by God, but gradually, and a long time ago.   <br/>
Practically Darwin.  Reject.<br/>
<br/>
(You could say KONOS or ATI or something but if you were doing ATI,  <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t be out there socializing with those other people probably  <br/>
anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s nice to say that it&#39;s an innocent chit-chat question, when  <br/>
people ask about a curriculum, but depending who and where the person  <br/>
is, it might not be innocent at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Or, they may be just checking out if they can feel good about  <br/>

I take it you don&#39;t know any ABeka families.  :-)<br/>

Some &quot;eclectic&quot; folks will drift more to one curriculum or other, while others will drift more to &quot;independent study&quot; or even unschooling - and really, the same can be said of unschooling families, especially if you&#39;re meeting other folks with younger kids. <br/>

<br/>
Either way, insecure or righteous, it&#39;s a good idea to keep the conversation light.  If the person/group is too probing, it may be time to change venues or just keep the subject to the weather.<br/>

The first part means that in the case of someone asking what  <br/>

nothing I made up.)<br/>

It was not mentioned in the original, but it was totally disregarded  <br/>
in one of the responses, where someone answered in such a way as to  <br/>
disregard the very definite possibility that someone in a small town  <br/>
who was afraid to say &quot;unschooling&quot; could likely be living where the  <br/>
other people were fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105138805">It&#39;s almost become a political question, hasn&#39;t it?  But I Do believe it IS important to bring unschooling &quot;into the light.&quot; It shouldn&#39;t be a dirty little secret, when it&#39;s main thrust is to enlighten children&#39;s lives for a lifetime of learning, loving, living in a positive way. How could that be a &quot;bad&quot; thing?  I know that great ideas are often unpopular ideas at the genesis of their acceptance into society.   The key is to slowly, carefully, educate the public about the benefits of child-led learning, through quotes from John Taylor Gatto, John Holt, Fitzenrieter, Sandra Dodd, and a host of other unschooling philosophers. This is a growing movement of parents who trust and respect their children (and thus want their children to grow up trusting and respecting their own ideas, instincts and interests). If you have read as many books as I have on unschooling, and that is why you are doing it, then don&#39;t be afraid to tell the truth about it.  Tell your homeschooling friends about authors you&#39;d suggest to them.  Send a website their way. Explain the reasons WHY we unschool and what GOOD it can do a child to  grow up &quot;unprocessed.&quot; You know those cute little stories about accidental learning we tell our husbands at night so they can be on board?  Share them with your homeschooling group so they can &quot;learn&quot; more about it too. I truly believe in my heart if more people would try this approach to learning and parenting, we&#39;d live in a better world.  We&#39;d have a world of kids who were confident, innovative, creative, compassionate, and perhaps not so conditioned into accepting warmongering all over the globe.  They&#39;d believe in their own ideas because they&#39;d have always come to them themselves.   They&#39;d come up with logical solutions and be brave enough to implement them because they&#39;d learned how to trust their own ideas and not follow the heard. As we unschool our children, we have to be brave enough to unschool ourselves. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102194708">-=-It&#39;s almost become a political question, hasn&#39;t it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It has been a political question for over twenty years.   One happy  <br/>
advantage to the more recent phenomenon of unschoolers-only lists,  <br/>
sites and conferences is that someone can unschool without knowing  <br/>
that, unless she lives in the Bible Belt or chooses to associate  <br/>
regularly with Christian-curriculum-using homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;It&quot; in this was intended to be &quot;Unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-It shouldn&#39;t be a dirty little secret, when it&#39;s main thrust is to  <br/>
enlighten children&#39;s lives for a lifetime of learning, loving, living  <br/>
in a positive way. How could that be a &quot;bad&quot; thing?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of people prevaricating about unschooling in  <br/>
general, but the question was asked specifically about a small town in  <br/>
which it didn&#39;t seem to be a good idea to say &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think that if within a couple of years of starting to  <br/>
unschool, one isn&#39;t confident and courageous enough to say &quot;We&#39;re  <br/>
unschoolers,&quot; they&#39;re not doing it very well.   And I *know* for a  <br/>
fact, proven many, many times, that choosing &quot;eclectic&quot; and saying  <br/>
&quot;some unschooling&quot; in ANY way leads to some unschooling/eclectic,  <br/>
which leads soon to no unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/doit">http://sandradodd.com/doit</a><br/>
<br/>
It is possible for unschooling to fail.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is a growing movement of parents who trust and respect their  <br/>
children (and thus want their children to grow up trusting and  <br/>
respecting their own ideas, instincts and interests). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there is.  Even parents whose kids are in school seem to be  <br/>
edging toward being more compassionate and friendly and direct with  <br/>
their children.   MANY parents, but not all.  Some cling to old ways,  <br/>
specifically because they&#39;re old.  Many of them won&#39;t have computers  <br/>
and internet, because they&#39;re not old.   There are probably more  <br/>
families using a curriculum and not having a computer (getting their  <br/>
supplies by mailorder from flyers at church or through print magazines  <br/>
such as The Home Schooling Digest of The Old Schoolhouse Magazine)  <br/>
than there are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Tell your homeschooling friends about authors you&#39;d suggest to  <br/>
them. Send a website their way. Explain the reasons WHY we unschool  <br/>
and what GOOD it can do a child to grow up &quot;unprocessed.&quot; -=<br/>
<br/>
If your homeschooling friends are fundamentalist Christians using a  <br/>
revisionist, creationist curriculum and you do any of that, you might  <br/>
as well say &quot;We worship Satan.&quot;  To those homeschoolers, they are  <br/>
homeschooling because the schools are not Biblical, because the  <br/>
schools push multiculturalism and don&#39;t condemn homosexuality.  They  <br/>
are homeschooling to keep their children away from people like me, and  <br/>
sites like mine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You know those cute little stories about accidental learning we  <br/>
tell our husbands at night so they can be on board? Share them with  <br/>
your homeschooling group so they can &quot;learn&quot; more about it too. I  <br/>

learning and parenting, we&#39;d live in a better world. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re new to this.  There are other stories, not so  <br/>
cute, about state homeschooling conventions and yahoo lists and  <br/>
newsletters blowing in two because someone wanted to tell their cute  <br/>
unschooling stories.<br/>

to learning and parenting, we&#39;d live in a better world. We&#39;d have a  <br/>
world of kids who were confident, innovative, creative, compassionate,  <br/>
and perhaps not so conditioned into accepting warmongering all over  <br/>
the globe. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are MANY people unschooling, and resources like this list make  <br/>
that possible.  The same years of experience that make this list  <br/>
useful for people who want to learn to unschool better  are alongside  <br/>
experience with the downsides.  There&#39;s no advantage in a flowers-and- <br/>
butterflies picture of the world and what unschooling can accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can change YOUR life, YOUR family&#39;s life, if you can  <br/>
persuade your partner and relatives that it&#39;s a good idea.  Don&#39;t even  <br/>
start to try to persuade the entire world. Your kids need your  <br/>
attention and the whole world doesn&#39;t want this.<br/>

understanding.<br/>
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy  <br/>
path.&quot;  (Proverbs 3: 5-6)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the cornerstones of Christian homeschooling, of  <br/>
fundamentalist Christianity.  It&#39;s okay if most people on this group  <br/>
never heard of it, but ALL Christian homeschoolers know it.  The kids  <br/>
can probably recite it and find it in the Bible within seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Something a person &quot;comes to themselves&quot; is likely to be false, or  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of going slowly and carefully, though, involves knowing why someone is asking in the first place - if that person isn&#39;t actively searching for something like unschooling then you run the risk of putting that person off, by seeming like another loud mouthed, pushy, judgemental unschooler, with no sense of personal boundaries. People like that pushed me away from unschooling when I was still homeschooling. I did a little of that when I was new to unschooling, all fired up with enthusiasm - but I don&#39;t want to push grownups buttons any more than I do my kids&#39;. I&#39;d rather set myself up for better relationships First, and see where that goes.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;educate the public about the benefits of child-led learning<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Trying to teach adults who aren&#39;t interested in what you have to say isn&#39;t any better than trying to teach children and has very similar results - people shut down and become resentful. I certainly did when I was homeschooling, and I was an Advocate of child-led learning... just the &quot;managed&quot; kind, teachable moments and all that stuff. I wasn&#39;t interested in hearing more than that.<br/>
<br/>
Its one thing to post a link and a blurb, on facebook, say, that other people can ignore if they want, another thing to give too much information at a social gathering. Its rude. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You know those cute little stories about accidental learning we tell our husbands at night so they can be on board?  Share them with your homeschooling group so they can &quot;learn&quot; more about it too.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>********************<br/>
<br/>
Adults don&#39;t need someone else&#39;s secret learning agenda any more than kids do. Tell those cute stories because they&#39;re cute. Tell sweet stories to keep the tone of the conversation light and positive. Be upbeat and warm and friendly. Wait until you&#39;re asked to give advice.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a part-time job where I work with a homeschooling dad. We talk about allllll sorts of things and have a bunch of things in common. He&#39;s on the &quot;eclectic&quot; end of homeschooling - independent study sorts of stuff, but still very much &quot;study&quot;. Not an unschooler. So I didn&#39;t mind telling him we were also &quot;eclectic&quot; but a little less formal than what he was doing - no details, although I think by now I&#39;ve said &quot;unschool&quot; but really casually. We each talk about our kids, and I keep my stories light and positive. <br/>
<br/>
Last month he had a big &quot;issue&quot; with his dd - 12yo, wanting to wear make-up. He didn&#39;t want her to wear make-up and at first forbade it, then tried to shame her out of it. Finally he asked my opinion. He wanted mine because he sees me as self-confident and comfortable in my own skin and would like his dd to be that way, too. I told him that I&#39;d worn make-up at 12, talked about kids needing space to try things out and &quot;try on&quot; different ways of being sometimes. He thought about that. He wasn&#39;t sure he believed it all, but he told his dd she could wear make-up if she wanted and the next time we worked together thanked me for my input. He thinks it helped his relationship with his kid. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s big. Doing something that lets a relationship get a little better, that&#39;s huge in this world that sets parents and kids at odds most of the time.</div>

attention and the whole world doesn&#39;t want this.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the key right there.  People on unschooling lists can&#39;t even agree to <br/>
what unschooling is and they WANT to unschool.  Everyone else is doing whatever <br/>
else they are doing because it&#39;s either what they want to do and are convinced <br/>
that it is the best way for their family, OR they feel as if the status quo of <br/>
public schooling is just fine, thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
I must focus on MY family and create happy existences for them otherwise <br/>
unschooling will fail.  There are people who spend a lot of time cheerleading <br/>
for unschooling.  I know how that feels.  The older my kids get and the more I <br/>
want to keep my family a family that stays together, the more time goes into <br/>
that than the cheerleading.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so easy to ignore what&#39;s right in front of you and put other things right <br/>
in front of you and spend your time on that.  Eventually the kids are bored and <br/>
wanting to go back to school, and maybe the the significant other in your life <br/>
feels neglected too and things spiral out of control really quickly. <br/>
 Unschooling isn&#39;t easy, it&#39;s simple, but not really easy.  It takes a LOT of <br/>
time and effort to keep a household running smoothly, adding the responsibility <br/>
of educating your own kids into that, and it&#39;s even more time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
As your kids get older and they branch out into the larger world, they will <br/>
encounter less and less homeschoolers, let alone unschoolers.  Most people don&#39;t <br/>
get unschooling.  Kids really should live in the world at large and be around <br/>
many many others.  I&#39;m grateful for the few unschooling friends that we have, <br/>
but our whole family needs to get along with those that don&#39;t.  That includes <br/>
school at homers, even the religious ones, especially if those are the only kids <br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
We did girl scouts for a number of years and it was a homeschooling troop.  Most <br/>
of the families involved were religious school at homers.  We got along with all <br/>
of those families and I still run into some of them here and there at various <br/>
homeschooling park days or the library or grocery store.  Our kids grew apart, <br/>
but it didn&#39;t have anything to do with our homeschooling style, more about <br/>
changing interests.  As long as we were willing to get along, we got along!  You <br/>
can&#39;t change another person&#39;s reaction or opinion of you or unschooling, but you <br/>
can find ways to get along and part of that can be about keeping your mouth shut <br/>
when needed.<br/>

<br/>
Kirby spoke on a panel of grown unschoolers at the HSC conference last  <br/>
week.<br/>
He said now he can know someone for a year or more without them  <br/>
knowing he didn&#39;t go to school, and when it comes up, usually because  <br/>
they&#39;re talking about school or graduation or something and ask him a  <br/>
question or he says he didn&#39;t have that, then they ask, he tells them,  <br/>
they&#39;re interested in the fact that they didn&#39;t know, and then they  <br/>
all go about their business.<br/>
<br/>
Some have found out because he had a copy of The Big Book of  <br/>
Unschooling on his desk.  One co-worker said &quot;The author has the same  <br/>
last name as you do,&quot; and Kirby said it wasn&#39;t a coincidence, and  <br/>
flipped through to show a photo of himself.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that unschoolers will change the world for having been  <br/>
unschooled is probably true, but it will be gradual change over  <br/>
generations, not one big sparkly change within the next 20 years.   <br/>
It&#39;s also possible that they will dissolve into the culture at large  <br/>
and as school becomes less solid on the horizon of the future, they  <br/>
will be seen as some of the early proof that schools weren&#39;t  <br/>
necessary, and there will be more options, perhaps, for our  <br/>
grandchildren and great grandchildren.<br/>
<br/>
But what I do know for certain is that I have three children who grew  <br/>
up without going to school.  They&#39;re grown.  They&#39;re whole and heathy  <br/>
and kind and thoughtful.   They each have in various ways and various  <br/>
times volunteered time and energy to reassure and to help other  <br/>
unschoolers.  They&#39;ve been understanding of my desire to do that,  <br/>
too.  My husband, too.  He&#39;s glad there are others who appreciate that  <br/>
our family&#39;s years doing this have been shared publicly--in person, in  <br/>
writing, with visitors to the house, and at conferences.<br/>

<br/>
ANY unschooler who wants to sit quietly in the dark has the right to  <br/>
do that.  NO one has the right to shove anyone out on stage and demand  <br/>
that they perform or reveal more of themselves than they want to  <br/>
reveal.   Living quiet lives is not a crime.  Not everyone needs to be  <br/>
a cheerleader, a missionary or a rally organizer.<br/>
<br/>
Each unschooler can decide whether to read about it online, whether to  <br/>
write (in private, on lists, on blogs, to magazines), whether to speak  <br/>
(in person one-on-one, in meetings to groups, maybe at conferences).    <br/>
But no one should feel they&#39;re keeping a secret (let alone a &quot;dirty  <br/>
little secret&quot;) if they&#39;re not comfortable describing what they do.<br/>
<br/>
At La Leche League meetings, women nurse babies in front of each  <br/>
other.  If someone doesn&#39;t want to do that, she isn&#39;t forced to.  If  <br/>
someone doesn&#39;t want to go to those meetings, she doesn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
There are hundreds of people on this list who read but don&#39;t write.   <br/>
That&#39;s absolutely fine.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who came to my talks last weekend in Sacramento and  <br/>
didn&#39;t make eye contact.  They listened, maybe took notes, and left  <br/>
when it was over.  Others came and spoke with me.  A few cried, and  <br/>
expressed regrets.   No one had to do any of that.  I didn&#39;t have to  <br/>
speak at all.  I didn&#39;t have to hang around afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Just as we let our children decide whether to look, speak, write,  <br/>
sing, jump or sleep, we need to let others have space or privacy or  <br/>
opportunity or anonymity as they prefer.<br/>

I appreciate your enthusiasm! As others have pointed out, it shouldn&#39;t be up to every unschooler to publicize unschooling. Not only does the wrong impression get made if the family doesn&#39;t have lots of experience and some discernment (remember the news story of the unschooler who had her son at a bar at 10 o&#39;clock at night?), but most radical unschoolers&#39; focus is on their family. I used to feel guilty I didn&#39;t do more, didn&#39;t blog specifically about unschooling, etc., then I realized what&#39;s most important right now is the time I spend with my kids. I take time when I have it to answer posts on the couple of lists I&#39;m on, and I&#39;ve left a comment or two on a news story or article, but I don&#39;t need to do more right now. When the boys aren&#39;t around as much as they get older, I may feel called to do more, but right now, we&#39;re building their lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870446283">Wow. I am new to this site and have been reading quietly as suggested for over a <br/>
month. I have only one child. A ten year old that my husband and I are <br/>
unschooling. I am an older mother (just turned 50) from So CA. I knew kids that <br/>
were unschooled when I was a kid. This makes me laugh. It is like the movie Eat <br/>
Pray Love. So 70s. LOL None of this is new.<br/>
<br/>
My 95 year old grandma and my daughter read to each other sometimes at night on <br/>
skype before bed. Grandma lives in Mississippi and could not be more proud of us <br/>
for listening to that small still voice of God and not give our child up to the <br/>
Government. Or a private school. If the Lord trusted me enough to knit her <br/>
together in my womb He trusts us enough to teacher her all that she needs to <br/>
know using His world. We believe we were led by the Lord and never worry about <br/>
stuff like credentials as we know that He does not call upon the qualified...He <br/>
qualifies the called. So no. We are not homeschooling to hide her from anyone. <br/>
(I am sorry I don&#39;t know what category you are in personally and don&#39;t really <br/>
care. As I am not God and leave the judging to Him as I am taught to do in His <br/>
word.) Or any group.<br/>
<br/>
How would I hide her from any one group? I was (closed shop) an antique dealer <br/>
with all kinds of customers. I now am a Interior Stylist. With sewers, <br/>
and furniture stores, and painters, fabric stores. We go to several spas (at my <br/>
age a micro-derm is a must). Hair salons. LA Museum.  Art Museums. Missions <br/>
(every one in CA and AZ). Our Nutritionist/DC office. Trader Joe&#39;s. San Diego <br/>
Zoo. Wild animal park.  Napa. Pismo. Palm Springs. Indian Tribes. Apple Farmers. <br/>
and on and on. I don&#39;t know any home-schoolers/unschoolers-eclectic teachers <br/>
that actually stay at home. I am not alone in my thinking as we are in a <br/>
Home-school group at my church that includes 70 families just on the email list. <br/>
Anyone may come to the meetings unless they are just there to criticize God. We <br/>
are there to support each other. (There were 90 people at my house at <br/>
our Valentines day party.) Our children are enlightened and so are we. Even <br/>
though we continue to be judged and ridiculed  for believing that Jesus died for <br/>
us. And yes we are very conservative which only means, mind your own business. I <br/>
think we can find middle ground with that one. LOL. We didn&#39;t come to this <br/>
ourselves. So your scripture is out of context.  As all Christians do...we pray <br/>
about it and were answered by the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
As for Satin...Really, we never give him credit.<br/>

in a positive way. How could that be a &quot;bad&quot; thing?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of people prevaricating about unschooling in <br/>
general, but the question was asked specifically about a small town in <br/>
which it didn&#39;t seem to be a good idea to say &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think that if within a couple of years of starting to <br/>
unschool, one isn&#39;t confident and courageous enough to say &quot;We&#39;re <br/>
unschoolers,&quot; they&#39;re not doing it very well.   And I *know* for a <br/>
fact, proven many, many times, that choosing &quot;eclectic&quot; and saying <br/>
&quot;some unschooling&quot; in ANY way leads to some unschooling/eclectic, <br/>
which leads soon to no unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/doit">http://sandradodd.com/doit</a><br/>
<br/>
It is possible for unschooling to fail.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is a growing movement of parents who trust and respect their <br/>
children (and thus want their children to grow up trusting and <br/>
respecting their own ideas, instincts and interests). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there is.  Even parents whose kids are in school seem to be <br/>
edging toward being more compassionate and friendly and direct with <br/>
their children.   MANY parents, but not all.  Some cling to old ways, <br/>
specifically because they&#39;re old.  Many of them won&#39;t have computers <br/>
and internet, because they&#39;re not old.   There are probably more <br/>
families using a curriculum and not having a computer (getting their <br/>
supplies by mailorder from flyers at church or through print magazines <br/>
such as The Home Schooling Digest of The Old Schoolhouse Magazine) <br/>
than there are unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Tell your homeschooling friends about authors you&#39;d suggest to <br/>
them. Send a website their way. Explain the reasons WHY we unschool <br/>
and what GOOD it can do a child to grow up &quot;unprocessed.&quot; -=<br/>
<br/>
If your homeschooling friends are fundamentalist Christians using a <br/>
revisionist, creationist curriculum and you do any of that, you might <br/>
as well say &quot;We worship Satan.&quot;  To those homeschoolers, they are <br/>
homeschooling because the schools are not Biblical, because the <br/>
schools push multiculturalism and don&#39;t condemn homosexuality.  They <br/>
are homeschooling to keep their children away from people like me, and <br/>
sites like mine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You know those cute little stories about accidental learning we <br/>
tell our husbands at night so they can be on board? Share them with <br/>
your homeschooling group so they can &quot;learn&quot; more about it too. I <br/>
truly believe in my heart if more people would try this approach to <br/>
learning and parenting, we&#39;d live in a better world. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re new to this.  There are other stories, not so <br/>
cute, about state homeschooling conventions and yahoo lists and <br/>
newsletters blowing in two because someone wanted to tell their cute <br/>
unschooling stories.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I truly believe in my heart if more people would try this approach <br/>
to learning and parenting, we&#39;d live in a better world. We&#39;d have a <br/>
world of kids who were confident, innovative, creative, compassionate, <br/>
and perhaps not so conditioned into accepting warmongering all over <br/>
the globe. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are MANY people unschooling, and resources like this list make <br/>
that possible.  The same years of experience that make this list <br/>
useful for people who want to learn to unschool better  are alongside <br/>
experience with the downsides.  There&#39;s no advantage in a flowers-and- <br/>
butterflies picture of the world and what unschooling can accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can change YOUR life, YOUR family&#39;s life, if you can <br/>
persuade your partner and relatives that it&#39;s a good idea.  Don&#39;t even <br/>
start to try to persuade the entire world. Your kids need your <br/>
attention and the whole world doesn&#39;t want this.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They&#39;d believe in their own ideas because they&#39;d have always come <br/>
to them themselves.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thy own <br/>
understanding.<br/>
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy <br/>
path.&quot;  (Proverbs 3: 5-6)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the cornerstones of Christian homeschooling, of <br/>
fundamentalist Christianity.  It&#39;s okay if most people on this group <br/>
never heard of it, but ALL Christian homeschoolers know it.  The kids <br/>
can probably recite it and find it in the Bible within seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Something a person &quot;comes to themselves&quot; is likely to be false, or <br/>
inspired by Satan.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not making this stuff up.<br/>

again and interpreted by the person taking them out of context.  It IS the very <br/>

laugh. It is like the movie Eat<br/>
Pray Love. So 70s. LOL None of this is new.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate people not laughing at this list.<br/>
Unschooling might not be new, and I know there were some hippie kids  <br/>
homeschooled in the 1970&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know any who didn&#39;t go to  <br/>
school at some point, even the kids at the Santa Fe Free School, which  <br/>
was the center of a lot of the discussion and experimentation.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We believe we were led by the Lord and never worry about<br/>
stuff like credentials as we know that He does not call upon the  <br/>
qualified...He<br/>
qualifies the called. So no. We are not homeschooling to hide her from  <br/>
anyone.<br/>

What &quot;Category&quot; I&#39;m in personally?   I&#39;m the owner of the Always  <br/>
Learning list.<br/>
If you &quot;don&#39;t really care&quot; about something, the polite thing to do is  <br/>
probably to keep it to yourself, especially in your first post to a  <br/>
group.   You wouldn&#39;t walk into a party at someone&#39;s house and say &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t know who you are and I don&#39;t really care,&quot; to a guest or to the  <br/>
hostess.  But in this house, I&#39;m the hostess.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know any home-schoolers/unschoolers-eclectic teachers<br/>
that actually stay at home. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are many who advocate staying home during school hours, and only  <br/>
associating with others who believe as they do.  Maybe not in your  <br/>
group and that&#39;s fine.  But your group doesn&#39;t negate the other  <br/>
groups.  Southern California is hardly the Bible Belt.  I think people  <br/>
who have never lived in the south imagine others are exaggerating when  <br/>
they say they&#39;ll be asked &quot;What church do you go to?&quot; in the grocery  <br/>
store, or at the filling station, by people who haven&#39;t asked them  <br/>
anything else before that.<br/>
<br/>
-=- We didn&#39;t come to this ourselves. So your scripture is out of  <br/>
context. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you didn&#39;t read the entire thread.  At the bottom of this e- <br/>
mail is a link that says &quot;messages in this topic.&quot;  My quotation was  <br/>
cited, and referred to someone else&#39;s... wait...  IN YOUR E-MAIL you  <br/>
quoted my entire post, in which I quoted the paragraph to which I was  <br/>
referring:<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Back when I was in college, I student-taught at a lab school on campus.  In<br/>
attendance were preschool children - one-third children from the community<br/>
(who were of a variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds), one-third<br/>
children of the professors who taught at the college (again, a variety of<br/>
backgrounds), and one-third children of the low-wage employees of the<br/>
college (all of whom were Haitian).  That year, the school was planning a<br/>
huge Halloween bash - the children were going to come in costume, there was<br/>
going to be a parade. it was going to be quite the celebration.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the mothers of one of the children, a quiet Haitian woman who worked<br/>
cleaning the dorm bathrooms and never spoke or made eye contact with the<br/>
teachers - not even me, a young student teacher - requested a meeting with<br/>
the school director.  She explained to the Director that if the school went<br/>
forward with the celebration, the Haitian families would be forced by<br/>
circumstance to find alternate care for their children that day.  Because in<br/>
the Haitian culture with which these families identified, Halloween was not<br/>
a day to fool around with - not a day to celebrate.  It has religious<br/>
meaning.  It is tied in with voodoo.  It&#39;s not something to be taken lightly<br/>
(I&#39;m not near expert enough to explain the details - but I&#39;ll guess you get<br/>
the picture).  It was very serious business for this woman - serious enough<br/>
for her to step out of her comfort zone and ask to be heard.  And respected.<br/>
Despite her non-mainstream beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The Director called a staff meeting.  She asked what people thought should<br/>
be done.  All the staff (and student-staff) agreed that it would be<br/>
inexcusable to hold a celebration that would not only exclude, but insult, a<br/>
full third of the children and families served by the school.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Halloween came and went that year - with no costumes, parade, or party at<br/>
the school.  The children who celebrated Halloween did it on their own<br/>
&quot;turf&quot; - and the children who didn&#39;t, well, didn&#39;t.  What could have been an<br/>
awkward, difficult situation became a non-issue, because people chose<br/>
Tolerance and not Righteousness or Belittling or Name Calling or any other<br/>
choice that&#39;s out there.  We the Halloween-celebrating weren&#39;t Satanists and<br/>
they the non-celebrating weren&#39;t Religious Fanatics.  A little Tolerance,<br/>
and everybody &quot;won.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The lesson I took from that has stayed with me always.  Just because someone<br/>
doesn&#39;t do something my way, it doesn&#39;t make them wrong.  And just because<br/>
someone isn&#39;t with the majority, it doesn&#39;t make them bad.  As unschoolers,<br/>
I would think we would be well aware of what it&#39;s like to be outside the<br/>
mainstream.  And I, for one, choose Tolerance when faced with or dealing<br/>
with someone else whose ideas or beliefs or customs or interests or whatever<br/>
differ from mine.  That Haitian woman all those years ago wasn&#39;t Wrong<br/>
because she believed something I don&#39;t even understand - she was just<br/>
Different than me.  Fundamentalist Christians aren&#39;t wrong because they<br/>
believe what they believe.  They don&#39;t see it my way - I don&#39;t see it<br/>
theirs.  But I find no joy or power or anything else in pointing out how<br/>
right I am and how wrong they are.  I don&#39;t need to point it out at all.<br/>
After all, maybe my way isn&#39;t the right way either.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I saw a little blip of film once and the message was &quot;I&#39;m different, you&#39;re<br/>
different, we&#39;re all ok.&quot;  I think a little of that sort of thinking goes a<br/>
long way.  And yes, I understand that one of the things about some<br/>
Fundamentalist Christians is that they would very much like me (and people<br/>
like me) to think their way.  And that gets on some people&#39;s nerves.  And it<br/>
makes the Us vs Them thing certainly not any better, and probably worse. But<br/>
I don&#39;t fault them for that either.  It&#39;s just the way they believe (some of<br/>
them - not all - I don&#39;t like to generalize - just like I would never assert<br/>
that all Haitians believe what that mom believed).  Religions fail if they<br/>
can&#39;t get (and keep) new members.  I choose not to be a member - but I also<br/>
choose not to criticize those who do choose that for themselves.  Tolerance.<br/>

and not continue to ask more questions. I live in a very small country  <br/>
town and<br/>
it is hard to be anonymous, but I worry that people who don&#39;t understand<br/>
unschooling, will just see me as negelectful.-=-<br/>

Her concern was that the homeschoolers in her small country town would  <br/>
be intolerant.<br/>
