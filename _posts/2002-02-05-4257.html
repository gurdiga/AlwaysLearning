 </span></blockquote>Hey Nancy, I wanted to say thank you for that<br/>
fantastic post.  I did not think it was too long at<br/>
all, as I was fascinated all the way through.  :-) <br/>
Your story is SO radically different than my own path<br/>
to Unschooling that it was really a great learning<br/>
experience for me.  I am not accustomed to believing<br/>
people think that way.  I guess no matter how hard we<br/>
try, we do really assume that other folks are similar<br/>
to us.  I knew that not everyone came to Unschooling<br/>
the same way, but your story was a real illustration<br/>
of how opposite those paths can be that lead to the<br/>
same destination.<br/>
<br/>
I found my way to Unschooling as a teenager, in my<br/>
quest to educate myself and escape from the<br/>
institutions.  I had to fight against a lot of<br/>
enormous odds for my right to be in charge of my own<br/>
education, my parents being one of my biggest<br/>
obstacles.  I finally had enough information, strength<br/>
of will, and ability to access and utilize options<br/>
when I was a teen starting highschool to be able to<br/>
effect my escape from school.  Oh how I wish the<br/>
Teenage Liberation handbook had been in print then, or<br/>
that I had discovered John Holt.<br/>
<br/>
I have always known I WANTED children, and had spent<br/>
most of my life in various positions of caring for<br/>
other people&#39;s children before I had my own.<br/>
I decided that I would not subject my own children to<br/>
what I had to endure in the city schools.  I decided<br/>
to homeschool my own children before I ever had any,<br/>
before I found their daddy.  :-)  <br/>
I began to explore homeschooling options and<br/>
legalities when my first son was an infant and<br/>
discovered that there was a name for what I had done<br/>
with myself as a teenager, Unschooling!  It felt like<br/>
coming home to find the Unschooling community.  <br/>
<br/>
I am still working my way through all the books about<br/>
Unschooling, homeschooling, education and parenting<br/>
that I want to read.  Somehow two VERY active boys are<br/>
not conducive to my own desired reading list<br/>
shrinking, and Unschooling has a way of making my<br/>
reading list keep growing and growing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you for your story.  It really helps me<br/>
to understand where some people may be coming from.  I<br/>
grew up on San Francisco and environs (Sausalito, Palo<br/>
Alto, Mountain View, Santa Cruz, San Lorenzo Valley<br/>
and kids who grew up on the communes there, and etc)<br/>
and while I was exposed to a huge variety of<br/>
lifestyles, values and diverse folks, it&#39;s been an<br/>
education process since I moved away from California<br/>
what types of folks I did NOT get exposure to.  I did<br/>
not get a lot of exposure to things like close<br/>
mindedness, conservativism, circular and dead end<br/>
thinking, bigotry and prejudice.  I KNEW about such<br/>
things, but thought they were the exception, not the<br/>
majority.  I was in for a great culture shock when I<br/>
moved, and I continue to encounter attitudes which<br/>
startle or surprise me.  Particularly because I am the<br/>
antithesis of those things and am very joyfully honest<br/>
about being a Pagan-Unschooling-Attachment<br/>
Parenting-Intentional Communitarian-and Etc....  Some<br/>
people find me REALLY offensive, just for being me.  I<br/>
am sure everyone on this list knows what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to know that being on opposite spectrums<br/>
about some things does not prevent us from<br/>
communicating and learning from each other, as is so<br/>
often the case.<br/>
<br/>

I understand that feeling.  I grew merrily in New Mexico, not knowing how <br/>
many people were elsewhere, how little openness there was elsewhere, or that <br/>
in other places people were taught NOT to make eye contact, NOT to report <br/>
crimes, NOT to tell someone who was littering to stop it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And I grew up thinking people used to be very prejudiced but the Whole World <br/>
was getting over it, because we all lived together.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  That was northern New Mexico, not the whole world.<br/>

<br/>
I am going through a bit of an identity crisis.  I have always thought of myself as conservative because I like &quot;old fashioned&quot; values where a woman can stay home and raise her family and not feel pressure to bring in money.  I like &quot;old fashioned&quot; moral character where modesty is a virtue and there is shame in being a virgin.  I don&#39;t like to hear people say &quot;hey what ever makes them happy&quot; when there is adultery in a marriage or &quot;that&#39;s a sign of the times&quot; when people get divorced.  I don&#39;t like MTV or porn on the internet being connected to free game software for kids.<br/>
<br/>
I like progress when it means women have a choice in their lives.  I like progress when it means my children never use the color of someone&#39;s skin to describe them.  I like progress when it is positive.  So am I a conservative?  Is being conservative bad if I am not trying to conserve traditions that are not positive?  What is a liberal?<br/>

LOL!! Well, I know when I was a teen it was &#39;uncool&#39;<br/>
to be a virgin, but I had no idea that there was shame<br/>
in it!<br/>

<br/>
A few years ago--actually, more than a few years ago--Eric (dh) was waiting<br/>
at a stop light behind someone who finished eating something and threw the<br/>
wadded-up wrapping out the car window. Eric jumped out of his car, ran<br/>
ahead, picked up the trash and said to the man &quot;excuse me sir, you dropped<br/>
this.&quot; The startled guy actually said &quot;thank you&quot; and took it back!  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if he detected sarcasm or not. (Today Eric probably would have been<br/>
shot.)<br/>
<br/>
Another time he was driving along a lonely road and a pick-up truck full of<br/>
junk roared past him. Awhile later it roared past the other way, minus the<br/>
junk. He continued along until he found a lovely spot in the woods where<br/>
these jerks had dumped all their trash and he spent about a half-hour<br/>
digging around until he found an envelope with their name and address on it.<br/>
He reported them to the police, who were so pleased they called him back to<br/>
tell him when the &quot;got&#39; the guys.<br/>

Don&#39;t be littering around Eric....<br/>
