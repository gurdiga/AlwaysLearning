<div id="ygrps-yiv-318087892">The reason the AlwaysUnschooled list was created is that I objected  <br/>
to people with babies saying they were unschoolers.  Sometimes I feel  <br/>
one way about it and sometimes I feel another, but I just found this  <br/>
comment on a blog, out there, by &quot;anonymous&quot; and it reinforces my  <br/>
feeling that it clutters up unschooling for people to say they&#39;ve  <br/>
done it if they give up at &quot;school age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hi�. I used to unschool our two kids but as they grew up,  <br/>
particularly at age 7ish, I felt this need to provide an official  <br/>
education for them - you know, reading, writing, arithmetic - and so  <br/>
we homeschool now. I know a bunch of unschoolers and I�ve read a  <br/>
bunch of blogs about it, and it seems like most unschooling parents  <br/>
have kids that are 8 and under. I�ll be pretty curious about your  <br/>
educational choices when your girls are older�. truthfully I doubt  <br/>
they�ll be the same. It seems like a lot of people drop out of the  <br/>
unschooling ways as their kids grow. I mean there comes a point�. are  <br/>
you hear to guide your kids, or are you just going to let them figure  <br/>
it all out themselves? Do you make your kids brush their teeth, or is  <br/>
that a choice they get to make too? Do you let them watch hours and  <br/>
hours of TV full of ads they think are truth (because they are  <br/>
innocent)? When do you say no, that is not safe! ? Instread of asking  <br/>
them if it feels safe. I strongly believe that kids need boundaries,  <br/>
they need guidance, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That said, I did agree with a lot of your post, especially about  <br/>
parenting like there is no tomorrow. And I actually do think  <br/>
unschooling is a great way to learn, it�s how I learn, and when my  <br/>
kids are in their teens and they have a foundation of a great  <br/>
education and skills, then we will make this transition. It�s  <br/>
actually a family goal, to give our kids the foundation they need to  <br/>
be autodidacts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So will that family say, in the long run, that they are unschoolers,  <br/>
and that their kids were unschooled, because they unschooled before  <br/>
they were seven and when they were teens?  If so, how do people  <br/>
distinguish between that and people who REALLY DO unschool instead of  <br/>
sending their kids to school, and instead of school at home?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that I don&#39;t think the principles of unschooling  <br/>
and attachment parenting don&#39;t work with babies.  That&#39;s where  <br/>
attachment parenting comes from! I just don&#39;t think someone who  <br/>
&quot;lets&quot; a baby or two year old learn naturally has a lot to brag  <br/>
about, as courage and innovation go.  So maybe it&#39;s that I don&#39;t like  <br/>
someone saying, &quot;Oh yes, we&#39;ve unschooled for five years&quot; and then  <br/>
sending their kid to first grade.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262543870">I can see your point, and as a mother of a 5 year old, which I try to<br/>
mention frequently for those who want to know that kind of thing, it&#39;s an<br/>
important distinction.  Karl would be entering grade K if it weren&#39;t for<br/>
unschooling.  Brian has begun to worry about unschooling and academics<br/>
(already!).  I have been taking some steps to get more proactive, not just<br/>
so I can enrich Karl&#39;s unschooling nest with plenty of fun and happenings<br/>
for him to glean and grow from (the most important reason), but also so that<br/>
we can continue doing unschooling in the long run (a vital consideration<br/>
believe me).<br/>
<br/>
Some areas that need encouragement for those who decide the fate of<br/>
unschooling in our house to keep on with it:<br/>
<br/>
Sleep Routines<br/>
Okay yeh Academic Concerns<br/>
Video/Computer/TV Engagement<br/>
<br/>
All the typical stuff right, and there&#39;s plenty to keep us busy in the<br/>
archives.<br/>
<br/>
I just wrote in my blog about how thankful I am to Pam Sorooshian for<br/>
talking up the &quot;guest&quot; model for how to treat children in the home.  One of<br/>
my comments is that in the predominantly anti-feminist culture that is the<br/>
Southeast and Christianity, the thought to treat our children as we would<br/>
treat our spouse doesn&#39;t resonate very much if at all in the right way.<br/>
Treating family members more like guests and learning simple courtesy is<br/>
something that we need here.  *blush*  It&#39;s true.  We haven&#39;t learned that<br/>
kind of respect in the families we grew up in.  So *now* we&#39;re in dire need<br/>
for such things.  Otherwise unschooling will be a complete wash, and the<br/>
last thing I want is for Karl&#39;s childhood to be a wash.  So I mean it when I<br/>
say I am working double time to learn what I need to know in order to<br/>
succeed for Karl&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Pam.<br/>

feeling that it clutters up unschooling for people to say they&#39;ve<br/>

<br/>
I started a post to this list a couple days ago (didn&#39;t finish yet) <br/>
and wrote, &quot;I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re still unschoolers.&quot;   I wrote that <br/>
because Dylan is now sixteen and is past compulsory school age in our <br/>
state. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I can claim he passed his compulsory schooling.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
When he was little I wasn&#39;t unschooling -  I wasn&#39;t *not schooling* <br/>
him - because he wasn&#39;t required to be in school.   He could have <br/>
gone to Kindergarten when he was five (and he didn&#39;t) so sometimes I <br/>
count from there.   But he wasn&#39;t *required* to attend school until <br/>
he was seven years old so I usually count from there.    Before he <br/>
was compelled by law to be in school I don&#39;t see how I can claim &quot;not <br/>
schooling&quot; and have it mean anything.   <br/>
<br/>
The folks who&#39;ve never got to the point where they were *compelled by <br/>
law* and made the choice to not comply don&#39;t have any real idea what <br/>
it means, emotionally, socially, culturally, legally or practically. <br/>
<br/>
And as the mom of a now sixteen year old really unschooled kid&lt;g&gt; I <br/>
can say it takes some considerable more thought than parroting vague <br/>
yuck about how &quot;kids need boundaries.&quot;    Boundary talk is one of the <br/>
first indicators that person isn&#39;t doing much thinking. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509855770">My 4 kids are 3 to 6 (almost 7).   I think the reason more and more people think of themselves as unschoolers when their kids are not even school age is the growing tendency in this county to feel you need to purposely teach even preschool stuff.  I am on a forum where several people posted pictures of their kids (3 and 4 year olds) all ready to start &quot;preschool at home&quot;.  Some people even stretch these things to gross motor skill in babies by enrolling them in baby gymnastics classes etc...   So they say they are unschoolers to let people know that no they dont sit down and follow a schedule and have a curriculum for their preschoolers.  But at some point they loose faith or see that in actuallity they are glad even to follow these principles as long as their kid looks &quot;advanced&quot; but when the kids stop learning the things they think they should be learning &quot;like reading or skip counting&quot;  they feel a need to run to a curriculum.  <br/>
At this point I dont think of myself as unschooling my kids.  I just kind of think of it as getting through the day as happy as we can.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805836269">I¹m in this camp. My kids are 2 and 5. We have Early Childhood and Family<br/>
Education (ECFE) here in Minnesota. The mainstream view is that we are soooo<br/>
fortunate to have these services (fee-based on a sliding scale) for our kids<br/>
and should be taking every advantage of them! ³How could you not want to<br/>
give them every opportunity?² ;P I did attend when we first moved here when<br/>
my oldest (now 5) was 1 to check it out. I was w/ her in the class. What it<br/>
was early indoctrination of rules, shuffling from one activity to another,<br/>
and preschool drilling; did I mention she was 1? Needless to say, we ended<br/>
up ECFE drop outs. It also got her registered in the district¹s system. They<br/>
called this spring out of the blue to see why we hadn¹t attended the<br/>
kindergarten open house. Um, I¹m not required to tell you anything until<br/>
compulsory age of 7 here in MN.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of that, the pressure to preschool was ever-present. EVERY one of<br/>
the mainstream mommas I chatted w/ at playdates or while watching dd¹s<br/>
creative dance class, talked about their child¹s wonderful<br/>
preschool(part-time daycare) experience. Again, ³How could I not have her in<br/>
preschool?², they¹d wonder. I¹d say we were planning on homeschooling so<br/>
there was no need to prepare her for school. That got some odd looks. Then<br/>
would come the, ³Oh, I could never do that [homeschool].² Well, they may not<br/>
be able to do that. They¹ve bought into the idea that someone else has to<br/>
formally instruct their child from birth or their little one won¹t succeed.<br/>
<br/>
It was only by attending homeschool park days and lists such as this and<br/>
AlwaysUnschooled that I could find people who lived what I saw as the way I<br/>
wanted us to live and do live. -- Though there was this one mother who said<br/>
she had to leave the homeschooling gathering early so she her 2 y.o. twins<br/>
could finish their homework before lunch. She was completely serious. I<br/>
certainly felt like an unschooler then. -- And I do consider us<br/>
³unschoolers² and have since I first read Holt when dd was 6wks old. Okay,<br/>
maybe at 6wks, I did say in my head we would unschool, but I can¹t clearly<br/>
say when I switched over to using the present tense; I¹m guessing during<br/>
ECFE. <br/>
<br/>
Now I see it as a semantics issue, and prefer ³universal, lifelong learners²<br/>
for every member of my family. It¹s just so much more liberating to me. What<br/>
others call us doesn¹t really concern me. It used to bother me more if<br/>
someone called themselves an unschooler and it didn¹t match my definition <br/>
much like if they called themselves a vegetarian but ate fish. Now, it<br/>
doesn¹t concern me so much. I just focus on my little world and what brings<br/>
us joy. I see how from a list owners perspective, though, the goal would be<br/>
to present the philosophy in as clear form as possible so newcomers aren¹t<br/>
confused.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is 3.5.  The value of calling ourselves &quot;radical unschoolers&quot; at this<br/>
point in time is because of the intensive deschooling my wife and I have<br/>
been doing since his birth.  Beyond lack of limits on food or bedtimes or tv<br/>
or whatever, it&#39;s our mindset about life in general.  Had I not had<br/>
children, I wouldn&#39;t have had the same motivation to examine my own beliefs<br/>
and principles about how fun and full life can be.  Questioning everything<br/>
(especially all *rules*) and choosing our own beliefs while letting go of<br/>
our own childhood baggage has made our life more fun than I could have<br/>
imagined 4 years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, to me, is about the parents first.  If parents can&#39;t deschool<br/>
themselves adequately, they&#39;re not going to be effective in helping their<br/>
children lead big fun lives.<br/>

when all that was around me were authoritarian parenting models, books and lectures, <br/>
that&#39;s what I thought was right, and I thought I just needed to do it better.  Sad, but true, <br/>
and full of thought and conviction.  Just the wrong thoughts and the wrong convictions.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have real experience with sparkling children and good relationships from which to <br/>
draw my convictions about what is right and wrong.  Back in the day I had one 2 1/2 year <br/>
old with an emerging iron will that I just didn&#39;t know what to do with, and the messages <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802172433">Yes! I would agree that calling us unschoolers was mostly about me finding<br/>
my place, immersing myself in the idea, fully embracing it, and becoming<br/>
more and more confident in my stance. I can¹t imagine any other way now.<br/>
<br/>
However, after reading Holt¹s ³Learning All the Time² I did become even more<br/>
adamant that I would not partake in or allow any type of preschool drill or<br/>
quizing. To allow it could have planted the seed in my dd¹s head that she<br/>
couldn¹t learn w/o someone else directing her. In our schooly and<br/>
rule-driven world, I wanted to watch myself so I could keep her intact in<br/>
trusting herself. And, yes, she is the type who would have been a grand<br/>
follower (I see her get spunkier every day, though, as she comes into<br/>
herself more and more.). So, I think unschooling does actually happen early,<br/>
not just in theory, and serve a purpose. It is more than simply attentive<br/>
parenting. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the distinction is in how one really is at their core and if they plan<br/>
to not allow themselves to choose school (or the other structures that would<br/>
fall under radical unschooling). If they truly believed and lived the<br/>
freedom while the kids were whatever age, they are unschoolers (as school<br/>
per my argument begins as early as our society says it does  6mo. here, not<br/>
by law but by availability and expectation). Still in the end, we can¹t<br/>
really control what someone is going to label and proclaim themselves to<br/>
others. <br/>

I second that! After all, aren&#39;t all of us beginning unschooling <br/>
since day 1 of a babies life. I wish I would have stayed on that boat <br/>
and not gone into the whole homeschooling thing. But, I was just one <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633819316">Preschool&#39;s been around a long time.  I don&#39;t know if there was such <br/>
a thing as preschool when I was that pre-school age but I remember my <br/>
niece going to preschool and that would have been 1977 or 1978.   <br/>
<br/>
I remember talk from a long time ago that practically guaranteed if a <br/>
kid didn&#39;t go to the right preschool then he or she might not get <br/>
into the right college.   I have no idea what the statistics are on <br/>
that...whether colleges ask what preschool you attended.  <br/>
<br/>
If your state mandates preschool at age three and you opt out that&#39;s <br/>
different than if your friends and neighbors think preschool&#39;s the <br/>
thing and you don&#39;t send your kid.   People who think you&#39;re quirky <br/>
or even a little crazy for going against cultural norms think you&#39;re <br/>
negligent and maybe even criminal if you opt out of statutory <br/>
education. <br/>
<br/>
I might still call my kid an unschooler even though he&#39;s no longer <br/>
compelled by law to go to school because he might otherwise have been <br/>
in school until he&#39;s eighteen.  How long after that, though?  If he <br/>
doesn&#39;t go to college can I still say &quot;unschooler?&quot;  What if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t go on to a masters program and a Ph.D?    Maybe there&#39;s a <br/>
whole group of unschooling parents out there who think my kid can&#39;t <br/>
possibly be and unschooler anymore. <br/>
<br/>
I might want to say &quot;Unschooler!&quot; because other sixteen year old kids <br/>
who are not in school are &quot;drop outs.&quot;   But &#39;round here, unschooler <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean anything to anyone. &lt;g&gt;  It only means something to <br/>
other unschoolers.  Here, we&#39;ll say &quot;homeschooled&quot; and folks will <br/>
draw the absolutely wrong conclusion and many will still <br/>
think &quot;quirky, crazy, negligent, criminal&quot; but we&#39;re so used to that <br/>
after all these years we&#39;ll likely not even notice. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the difference.  When your kids are three you think it&#39;s <br/>
a big deal to opt out of preschool and be the talk of your <br/>
neighborhood or social circle.  When your kid is older and has never <br/>
been to school you realize the criticism and speculation of others <br/>
has no real power over your life and happiness.  <br/>

From what I can tell it&#39;s a standard for all child care providers but <br/>
it does not require parents to put children in preschool.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370866390">I consider myself an unschooler and I have considered myself one for<br/>
some time.  DD was probably 1.5 when we discovered unschooling but it<br/>
probably took me another year or so to soak in radical unschooling and<br/>
want to do all of it.  That was probably when I really started to<br/>
think of myself as an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
One reason I think that we are unschoolers is that when I decided to<br/>
be an unschooler, it changed the way I did things.  We were gentle<br/>
parents to begin with, but when I decided that I wanted to unschool,<br/>
things got even better.  When DD was really young, we didn&#39;t watch TV<br/>
around her and it wasn&#39;t until she was 2 that I started putting movies<br/>
on for her (all in spanish).  We didn&#39;t limit it to a certain amount<br/>
of time and I don&#39;t remember saying no... but I also didn&#39;t offer it<br/>
and she was 2 so it really was a limit.  I started to get more<br/>
comfortable with TV and now it is something that I don&#39;t have any<br/>
negativity about: our netflix account is largely for the kids and I<br/>
actively try to find things that  they might like and introduce them<br/>
to new things (or more episodes of old favorites).  I would not have<br/>
introduced them to Spongebob and they love that show.  I would not<br/>
have bought them toys, puzzles or scooters with pictures of their<br/>
favorite TV characters.  I would probably have pushed much much more<br/>
academically instead of trusting, helping and enjoying being with my<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t change much of anything that I did with DS when he was an<br/>
infant... although I didn&#39;t go nuts with alphabet letters in the bath<br/>
when he was 1.5 like I did w/dd.  Unschooling ideas weren&#39;t really<br/>
relevant very early on, but they certainly started to matter well<br/>
before my kids were school aged.<br/>
<br/>
As far as learning things goes, knowing that we were unschooling made<br/>
me realize that this was how my kids were going to learn things so I<br/>
got better about following up on their interests.  I started doing a<br/>
better job of making books, movies, websites, trips etc. available<br/>
when they were asking questions and expressing interest in things.  I<br/>
also started working harder to think of things that might be<br/>
interesting and offer them  It helped me make my home richer and<br/>
happier than it would have been otherwise.  I don&#39;t think we would<br/>
have our elaborate art table and wonderful projects piled up over the<br/>
house.  It wouldn&#39;t have occurred to me to introduce ds to the wii and<br/>
I would not have been as excited as I am when he learned how to play.<br/>
He even beat the boss of the game he plays (which isn&#39;t meant to be a<br/>
kids game) - I love to watch him and to play with him.  A friend of<br/>
mine who is pushing her son very hard academically seemed to think it<br/>
was stupid and a non-achievement.... the thought that it could have<br/>
been me looking down on this amazing stuff he is doing is really sad.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I can see that the issues that I am dealing with are not the<br/>
same as the issues that someone with older kids deals with... but<br/>
unschooling is not just an absence of structured schooling. I&#39;m not<br/>
just sitting her not going to preschool;  I am really DOING something<br/>
here.  Unschooling philosophy has been permeating our lives for<br/>
several years and what I do every day is different because of it.  I<br/>
am better at it than I was when I started and I hope that by the time<br/>
my kids are old enough to be &quot;real&quot; unschoolers that I will be even<br/>
better at it than I am now.  I think the parenting stuff that goes<br/>
with unschooling is vitally important and I don&#39;t see how academic<br/>
only unschooling can really work... if the parents are being<br/>
controlling about other aspects of the child&#39;s life do they really<br/>
think that the child isn&#39;t going to resist learning academic things<br/>
that they know their parents think are one of the few worthwhile ways<br/>
to spend their time?<br/>
<br/>
In 5 years will I think that what I did w/my dd at age 3 was<br/>
unschooling?  Yeah, I think I will.  DD would have started<br/>
kindergarten this week so perhaps now I am officially an unschooler...<br/>
but we are doing the same things that we were two weeks ago so it<br/>
seems rather silly to me to say that two weeks ago I wasn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling but now I am.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Hi…. I used to unschool our two kids but as they grew up,<br/>
&gt; particularly at age 7ish, I felt this need to provide an official<br/>
&gt; education for them - you know, reading, writing, arithmetic - and so<br/>
&gt; we homeschool now. I know a bunch of unschoolers and I&#39;ve read a<br/>
&gt; bunch of blogs about it, and it seems like most unschooling parents<br/>
&gt; have kids that are 8 and under. I&#39;ll be pretty curious about your<br/>
&gt; educational choices when your girls are older…. truthfully I doubt<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll be the same. It seems like a lot of people drop out of the<br/>
&gt; unschooling ways as their kids grow. I mean there comes a point…. are<br/>
&gt; you hear to guide your kids, or are you just going to let them figure<br/>
&gt; it all out themselves? Do you make your kids brush their teeth, or is<br/>
&gt; that a choice they get to make too? Do you let them watch hours and<br/>
&gt; hours of TV full of ads they think are truth (because they are<br/>
&gt; innocent)? When do you say no, that is not safe! ? Instread of asking<br/>
&gt; them if it feels safe. I strongly believe that kids need boundaries,<br/>
&gt; they need guidance, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;That said, I did agree with a lot of your post, especially about<br/>
&gt; parenting like there is no tomorrow. And I actually do think<br/>
&gt; unschooling is a great way to learn, it&#39;s how I learn, and when my<br/>
&gt; kids are in their teens and they have a foundation of a great<br/>
&gt; education and skills, then we will make this transition. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; actually a family goal, to give our kids the foundation they need to<br/>
&gt; be autodidacts.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So will that family say, in the long run, that they are unschoolers,<br/>
&gt; and that their kids were unschooled, because they unschooled before<br/>
&gt; they were seven and when they were teens?  If so, how do people<br/>
&gt; distinguish between that and people who REALLY DO unschool instead of<br/>
&gt; sending their kids to school, and instead of school at home?<br/>

&gt;<br/>

&gt; about, as courage and innovation go.  So maybe it&#39;s that I don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; someone saying, &quot;Oh yes, we&#39;ve unschooled for five years&quot; and then<br/>
&gt; sending their kid to first grade.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748179236">In Missouri the compulsorary age is 7.  So for record keeping homeschoolers have to by law begin keeping records at age 7 - though most people (not the homeschoolers) send their kids to day care from birth (well maybe more like 2 weeks of age) then possibly pre-school then to Kindergarten ...........etc.<br/>
<br/>
My school district has what they call Universal Pre-school that is available to all 3 & 4 year olds - this is the second year it has been available.  It is not mandatory but it is free and is an all day program - parent can drop off at 7 AM and pick up at 6 PM.  Some daycares closed their doors when we implemented this last year due to loss of enrollment.  They seem to think this will solve our district&#39;s problem of meeting the national rules for No Child Left Behind / Adequate Yearly Progress - and don&#39;t even get me started on the stupidness that says that by a certain year (which is fast approaching) 100% of the children will be scoring 100% which is impossible - unless we help them make little hankies I guess.  I wonder what Washington will come up with when the top districts in the nation do not make compliance????  Us poor inner city districts don&#39;t stand a chance.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve even added 50 minutes to the instructional time for all students in the district - grrrrrrrrrrrrr.<br/>
<br/>
Why do most people think that earlier and earlier is the solution to the &quot;problem&quot;?  Or more and more and more?  Someone should tell them that less can often times be more :)    It seems to me that the more we make them go to school the <br/>
<br/>
I did not even have kindergarten available when I went to school in 1968 in Illinois - I started with first grade, had mixed grade levels because we were such a small school, stayed in the same school through 8th grade and did just fine. ;)<br/>

at home or anywhere else, when schooling is legally required.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Roya is 23 and I am clearly not unschooling her - meaning &quot;I&quot; am not  <br/>
any longer immersed in providing her with a rich environment and &quot;I&quot;  <br/>
no longer feel responsible for supporting her interests and expanding  <br/>
on her interests and offering her new opportunities and possibilities.  <br/>
Her life is so much more separate from mine, now, that it would seem  <br/>
ludicrous for me to say I am her unschooling parent. We&#39;re very close.  <br/>
I talk to her pretty much every day, see her more than once a week,  <br/>
spend a lot of fun time together and I&#39;m the first person she talks to  <br/>
about any concerns, problems, etc. But, still, she&#39;s an adult living  <br/>
her own life - I&#39;m not unschooling her.<br/>
<br/>
My second child is about to turn 21 and I&#39;m still her unschooling  <br/>
parent. She lives at home, she&#39;s very mature. But I&#39;m still an  <br/>
unschooling parent in heart and mind with her. I&#39;m still providing her  <br/>
with a stimulating environment. I&#39;m still offering her opportunities  <br/>
to explore her interests and to expand on her interests. She&#39;s still  <br/>
&quot;there&quot; in my unschooling parent&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
My third is 17 and could have left school, legally, by now. But, in  <br/>
her case, there is no doubt that we&#39;re still unschooling. There is  <br/>
also no doubt that we&#39;re reaching the end of it, though. The signs are  <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, my kids all three (including the 23 yo) call themselves  <br/>
unschoolers. They say that they are very aware of a big difference  <br/>
between themselves and other (schooled) people in their outlook on  <br/>
life, their sense of themselves, their entire approach and  <br/>
understanding of how learning happens. They say they are different  <br/>
because of unschooling and &quot;once an unschooler always an unschooler.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They have a completely different interpretation of the word - not as  <br/>
something that is being &quot;done,&quot; but as a way they &quot;are.&quot;<br/>

Why do most people think that earlier and earlier is the solution to the &quot;problem&quot;?  Or more and more and more?  Someone should tell them that less can often times be more :)  <br/>
-----------<br/>
I think a big part of why more and more is happening is about letting both parents work, or in a single parent household, the parent work. Pre-school daycare can be quite expensive and in the UK that is why they now are introducing these measures for assessing daycares. You assess a school by it&#39;s product which is an educated child. You assess education with testing. So you test infants and toddlers at daycare. <br/>
I&#39;m lucky and I&#39;m willing to take the hit, I don&#39;t work. We live without my income. If we needed my income I would work really, really hard to find ways to earn money while still having Simon and Linnaea at home. But I balk the system in that regard. For most people being able to put your children in state-funded daycare is a very good thing. I suppose having a school open to earlier age children takes away some of the stigma of not paying for childcare, using welfare based childcare. Maybe not. It probably, also, helps those who are marginally not on welfare. <br/>
<br/>
------snip--------<br/>
I did not even have kindergarten available when I went to school in 1968 in Illinois - I started with first grade, had mixed grade levels because we were such a small school, stayed in the same school through 8th grade and did just fine. ;)<br/>
-----------------<br/>
The economy was very different in 1968. In 1968, the year I was born, my mom didn&#39;t work. She went to school fulltime when I was 5, so 1973. My next door neighbor, who was a nurse, but was also around a lot of the time, so must not have been working, babysat for me until second grade, when I think mom was at home more and taking the bus to and from school delayed my homecoming long enough for me not to be home alone much. And even so, I went to preschool for 2 years before school. I can distinctly remember 3 different locations for the preschools, so maybe even 3 years of preschool, or 1 year of daycare and 2 years of preschool. <br/>
It isn&#39;t about you doing fine with less school. I think it is more about balancing the needs of so many people being in the workforce. It is not seen as a public good to have mothers or fathers be at home with their children during their childhood. There is lots of lovely data demonstrating that having a parent at home is a really good thing for children, but the data doesn&#39;t have the same impact as the GDP does, I imagine. And, of course, there is also data demonstrating that children in early learning programs are more precocious. Of course being precocial is not necessarily a good thing, but it looks good to achieve learning landmarks early. Certainly when you are testing for outcome. <br/>
