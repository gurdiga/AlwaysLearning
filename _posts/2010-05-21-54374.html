<div id="ygrps-yiv-197437024">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
many of you might be aware of the fact that homeschooling is still illegal in Germany. There is now an online petition to the German government, running until June 16th, requesting homeschooling to be legalized. Anybody can sign the petition, irrespective of their age, nationality or place of residence. Please help us get as many signatures as possible:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699146192">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t find the article you mention, but that sounds definitely wrong. Like in the US, we have two main groups in Germany who would really like to get rid of compulsory schooling. One group are some fundamental Christians, and the other group are unschoolers and people who would like more educational freedom for their children, because they cannot cope with school as it is. I think the &quot;educatinggermany&quot; site is from a Christian person, I don&#39;t have any information about the owner. I just included it because of the translation for the petition, so people could understand if they want to support us. As long as we still face the situation of homeschooling being illegal, we absolutely need to work together for our goal, Christians, unschoolers, everybody here in Germany who thinks homeschooling should be a legal choice for every family.<br/>

<br/>
yes, you get an email and need to click on the link. At &quot;Land&quot; you can write &quot;USA&quot; or &quot;US&quot; or whatever you please. At &quot;Bundesland&quot; you could choose &quot;Ausland&quot; at the bottom of the list or just not enter anything. Several people from the US have already signed the petition.<br/>
