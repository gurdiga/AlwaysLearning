<br/>
That&#39;s an article (book excerpt) by Laura Weldon, listing several kinds of get-togethers her kids or other families have organized and kept going for a while.  But as I was reading it, I thought there could be one-shot gatherings of that kind too, so that there could be a theme party and then IF that&#39;s fun, there could be a second one.  Maybe up to an 80th.  But if you plan for something to be the first of a series and the first time doesn&#39;t work out well, there&#39;s failure.  If you plan for a party and there&#39;s still partying... success!!<br/>
<br/>
She describes a science club, a cooking group, mentions boffers, hiking, letterboxing, historic reenactment, live-action role-playing, pirates, stop-motion movie making, sketching, book discussions.   <br/>
<br/>
There are lists of suggestions and practical considerations.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little we were in a sort of field-trip co-op called &quot;Moms with Something Extra.&quot;  Some of the outings were fun.  One of my weeks, I organized a bike and trike parade in a park that was full of sidewalks going everywhere, and brought crepe paper and cards and clothes pins to decorate bike spokes and handlebars.  That was a dud, turned out, because the other moms really wanted things to be *educational.*  So if you organize one as an unschooler, it might be good to remind people that art, music and playing are good things too.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is to look for such things already organized by others.  You don&#39;t have to create a geology club if there already is one.  There are garden club meetings and tours in some towns, and opportunities to trade plants and seeds.  <br/>
<br/>
If you find something and your child has zero interest, maybe you could find a place to leave him while you go and do something in a special-interest group!<br/>
