<br/>
I hurried into the local department store to grab some last minute <br/>
Christmas gifts. I looked at all the people and grumbled to myself. I <br/>
would be in here forever and I just had so much to do. Christmas was <br/>
beginning to become such a drag. I kinda wished that I could just <br/>
sleep through Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
But I hurried the best I could through all the people to the toy <br/>
department. Once again I kind of mumbled to myself at the prices of <br/>
all these toys. And wondered if the grandkids would even play with <br/>
them. I found myself in the doll aisle. <br/>
<br/>
Out of the corner of my eye I saw a little boy, about 5, holding a <br/>
lovely doll. He kept touching her hair and he held her so gently. I <br/>
could not seem to help myself. I just kept looking over at the little <br/>
boy and wondered who the doll was for. I watched him turn to a woman, <br/>
and he called his aunt by name and said, &quot;Are you sure I don&#39;t have <br/>
enough money?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She replied a bit impatiently, &quot;You know that you don&#39;t have enough <br/>
money for it.&quot; The aunt told the little boy not to go anywhere, that <br/>
she had to go get some other things and would be back in a few <br/>
minutes. And then she left the aisle.<br/>
<br/>
The boy continued to hold the doll. After a bit I asked the boy who <br/>
the doll was for. <br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;It is the doll my sister wanted so badly for Christmas. She <br/>
just knew that Santa would bring it.&quot; I told him that maybe Santa was <br/>
going to bring it. He said, &quot;No, Santa can&#39;t go where my sister <br/>
is...I have to give the doll to my Mamma to take to her.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I asked him where his sister was.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at me with the saddest eyes and said, &quot;She has gone to be <br/>
with Jesus. My Daddy says that Mama is going to have to go be with <br/>
her.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My heart nearly stopped beating. <br/>
<br/>
Then the boy looked at me again and said, &quot;I told my Daddy to tell <br/>
Mama not to go yet. I told him to tell her to wait till I got back <br/>
from the store&quot;. Then he asked me if I wanted to see his picture. <br/>
<br/>
I told him I would love to. He pulled out some pictures he had taken <br/>
at the front of the store. <br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;I want my Mamma to take this with her so she don&#39;t ever <br/>
forget me. I love my Mama so very much and I wish she did not have to <br/>
leave me. But Daddy says she will need to be with my sister.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I saw that the little boy had lowered his head and had grown so very <br/>
quiet. While he was not looking, I reached into my purse and pulled <br/>
out a handful of bills. I asked the little boy, &quot;Shall we count that <br/>
money one more time?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He grew excited and said &quot;Yes, I just know it has to be enough&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I slipped my money in with his, and we began to count it. Of <br/>
course it was plenty for the doll. <br/>
<br/>
He softly said, &quot;Thank you, Jesus, for giving me enough money.&quot; Then <br/>
the boy said &quot;I just asked Jesus to give me enough money to buy this <br/>
doll, so Mama can take it with her, to give to my sister. And He <br/>
heard my prayer. I wanted to ask Him for enough to buy my Mama a <br/>
white rose, but I didn&#39;t ask Him, but He gave me enough to buy the <br/>
doll and a rose for my Mama. She loves white roses so very, very <br/>
much&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In a few minutes the aunt came back, and I wheeled my cart away. I <br/>
could not keep from thinking about the little boy as I finished my <br/>
shopping in a totally different spirit than when I had started.<br/>
<br/>
And I kept remembering a story I had seen in the newspaper several <br/>
days earlier, about a drunk driver hitting a car and killing a little <br/>
girl and leaving the Mother in serious condition.The family was <br/>
deciding on whether to remove the life support. Now surely this <br/>
little boy did not belong with that story. <br/>
<br/>
Two days later, I read in the paper where the family had disconnected <br/>
the life support and the young woman had died. I could not forget the <br/>
little boy, and just kept wondering if the two were somehow <br/>
connected. <br/>
<br/>
Later that day, I could not help myself and I went out and bought <br/>
some white roses and took them to the funeral home, where the young <br/>
woman was. And there she was, holding a lovely white rose, the <br/>
beautiful doll, and the picture of the little boy in the store.<br/>
<br/>
I left there in tears, my life changed forever. The love that little <br/>
boy had for his little sister and his mother was overwhelming. <br/>
<br/>
And in a split second a drunk driver had ripped the life of that <br/>
little boy to pieces.<br/>
