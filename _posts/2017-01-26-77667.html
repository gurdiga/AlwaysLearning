<div id="ygrps-yiv-918617387">My 17 year old son is wondering if there are any careers that match up with his passion/talent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since early childhood, he is a collector.  He has moved through different items, but it is always a similar style of collecting.  He loves to go through tons of one thing looking for the rare and valuable ones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The past 8 months have been coins.  He has filtered through thousands of coins.  He has amazing stamina for this kind of work!  And he knows so many details about coins, metals, etc.  He spends 3-5 hours per day doing this work, driving to banks, picking up a couple hundred pounds of coins, dumping rejected coins in machines, and back home to sift again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This came up last night in talking about classes.  He has started taking a couple classes at a community college.  He thinks a class description sounds interesting, but then once he is sitting in class, he has a hard time keeping himself interested enough to pay attention to lecture.  Same goes for the reading he is assigned.  He finds that his mind wanders while he is reading and then he can&#39;t remember a thing from the chapter.   He was wishing he could learn to be as passionate about class readings as coins, so that he could learn the material more easily.  He said he thought he was not good at learning based on these class experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It got us thinking about this skill he has honed.  I wondered if he will look back one day and say, all those years collecting rare Lego minifigs and selling them, or sifting through millions of coins... those skills I developed made ____ work possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe this group of thinkers might come up with ideas other than open up a coin shop, which is a possibility for a career for him.  I was thinking scientists often filter through tons of data looking for something meaningful.  Any other ideas?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219654446">I&#39;m wondering what these &#39;sorting&#39; skills really are. What is it about the sorting he really enjoys? For example is it finding the unnusual ones? Is it creating order out of chaos? Is it valuing/selling/trading? Is it tactile or intellectual? What is the essence of his excitement? I ask because you say this passion has been applied to many things over the years. <br/>
<br/>
And do you think this could apply to intangible stuff such as data? <br/>
<br/>
Its interesting to think about, but i&#39;m wondering if this is getting ahead of yourselves. Does he need to think in these terms yet? Isnt it ok to enjoy his passions and see where they lead? Enable him in looking for opportunities which fit, whether they have obvious career connections or not. He really is quite young  to be career planning. Lots of schooled children are jumping through college hoops at his age but still have no passion or interest they can pinpoint to a career. They are only thinking about it because they are told to. And then they end up in jobs they dont like! <br/>
<br/>
His negative experiences at college may have given him a big feeling of &#39;ought to be thinking about career&#39; , panic.  <br/>
<br/>
He might start stacking shelves. He might love all the sorting! And then realise he wants to do something different and then take the classes because he desperately wants to for a reason rather than they &#39;sound interesting&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Keep the joy in the passion :-)<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, <br/>

<br/>
Yes.  “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is an irritating and harmful question.  Many people are unhappy in careers they chose when they were seven, or twelve, or eighteen.<br/>
<br/>
Real-world work experience is WAY more valuable than “career counselling,” whether it’s by school officials or college counsellors or well-meaning parents.<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps you should.<br/>
Maybe not “suggest,” but to state it gently as an option.<br/>
<br/>
School kills the desire to learn, in many people. In most, perhaps.  It’s not too late for him to have his curiosity damaged, or his expansiveness narrowed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  Everyone on both sides of his family has PhD, JD or masters degrees.  I don&#39;t want him to think that because he doesn&#39;t have experience with how to do school-type studying and didn&#39;t get used to the monotony of jumping through hoops to get a degree, that he&#39;s at a disadvantage.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
But he IS at a disadvantage.  They built up to it with years of schooling, and probably saw it as the last few years of confinement and helplessness before they could earn options.  He is going from options tocontrol and it must not feel very good.<br/>
<br/>
And he is at a disadvantage because of the family situation and expectations, which would make “being a diligent student” a virtue.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is, by nature, not an organized person. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I’m not either.  I accomplish lots, and always have, but I leave scraps and notes and print-outs and artwork and supplies and…  It’s not a sin, and shouldn’t be considered inferior to those who have a clean desk every day.  Some of them are productive too, but some spend a lot of time cleaning their desks.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  It is really difficult for him to do without significant help.  I have been looking at all the help that we are giving him as part of his process of learning how to be a student at school. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It will help both of you, all of you, to look at that help as what you’re doing as an unschooling parent, as part of his process of learning how to live in the world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  It is not much like the type of learning he is used to living (in the wild).  I&#39;m not even sure much of it is learning about the topics he is studying!  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems from your writing that you’re still looking at school and schoolishness at every turn.  When parents don’g deschool enough to see the world in a very different way, they can’t accept non-schoolish things with real enthusiasm and appreciation, and without that, unschooling can fail.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131723861">-=-My 13 year old has expressed anger that he has to do SO much work to catch up with peers in math and writing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
At 13, he shouldn’t be looking at work, or math, or writing, or “peers.”  Unschooled peers?  <br/>
<br/>
If he has been going along comparing himself to other kids his age for seven years, unshooling can’t be working well.<br/>
<br/>
-=- He refers to himself as “uneducated”-=-<br/>
<br/>
Was he in school for a while? Does he have a parent or grandparents who are opposed to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-and has commented to his younger brothers who are 6 & 8 that they should stop playing Minecraft all day and start doing math now while they still have the chance to not fall so far behind.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is there someone doing to him what you say hie is doing to his younger brothers?<br/>
Don’t let him do that.  Don’t “balance his words.”  Protect your children from damaging pressure from others, even from each other, if you can do it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- By unschooling, am I making it more difficult for my children to earn... college or higher degrees? -=-<br/>
<br/>
NO.  Many unschoolers have earned college degrees and done exceptionally well at universities because they were not beat down by thirteen years in the classroom, but were interested and filled with trivia that was just about to turn to KNOWLEDGE.  But that is if unschooling is preserved, maintained and is flourishing.<br/>
<br/>
-=- By unschooling, am I making it more difficult for my children to earn high school, college or higher degrees? -=-<br/>
<br/>
High school?  He’s 13.  If you have been planning to put him in high school, it’s about time. <br/>
Lots of unschoolers have gone to school for a while and come back home.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there’s something going on besides great unschooling, if he’s angry and you’re asking about high school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Am I pushing them toward other paths?  And is there anything wrong with that?  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you’re not pushing them. I hope you’re living a rich full life with them, not leaving them to try to do it on their own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Theoretically, if unschooling were helping them find a passion that does not need a degree, then wonderful. -=-<br/>
<br/>
#1, don’t look for “a passion that does not need a degree.”  Look for learning and peace.   Provide that.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/nest">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>
<br/>
#2, “Theoretically…”   If unschooling is theoretical for you and it’s not working, make changes to help it work.  If reading the easily available materials you can get to from this isn’t working, consider getting help, maybe, from Marji Zintz or Amy Childs or someone.<br/>
<br/>
Look here first:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a> but I hope you don’t need that.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-But if one child wants to earn a degree, but feels the task is just too big of a hurdle to cross because he has not taken all the baby steps to get him there, is that having served that child&#39;s best interests?—=-<br/>
<br/>
Baby steps to university are provided free in public schools.  We didn’t keep you from putting your children in school.  But unschooling should be bigger and better than school, or kids should be in school.<br/>

I can&#39;t remember whether it was here or on some other list where one of the contributors was talking about how the idea that we can&#39;t learn as well after a certain age is a really poisonous thought to hold onto, because it makes us feel a sense of urgency or helplessness that there is going to be a magic window that closes and we won&#39;t ever be able to learn something really new.<br><br></div>Sometimes my kids get frustrated that they don&#39;t already know how to do something.

Maybe just helping a child get through the steep curve if they ask for help, or even taking on something new and hard yourself at the same time to be a partner in that particular phase of learning, can help them see that there&#39;s never a point that you have all the tools already - there are always more to gather.

I can&#39;t remember whether it was here or on some other list where one of the contributors was talking about how the idea that we can&#39;t learn as well after a certain age is a really poisonous thought to hold onto, because it makes us feel a sense of urgency or helplessness that there is going to be a magic window that closes and we won&#39;t ever be able to learn something really new.<br><br></div>Sometimes my kids get frustrated that they don&#39;t already know how to do something. Most of the time, it is a passing thing - they experiment with it for a while and then move on. Once in a while, it really clicks and they dig in and get through the steep curve at the beginning. Maybe just helping a child get through the steep curve if they ask for help, or even taking on something new and hard yourself at the same time to be a partner in that particular phase of learning, can help them see that there&#39;s never a point that you have all the tools already - there are always more to gather. And maybe pointing out all the wonderful things they have in their lives because they weren&#39;t focused on basic math when tsunamis or Atlantis or Minecraft were more interesting, can help support them in the ongoing maturation process?<span class="ygrps-yiv-1784523983HOEnZb"><font color="#888888"><br><br></font></span></div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1784523983HOEnZb"><font color="#888888">Sarah<br></font></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1784523983HOEnZb"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1784523983h5"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1784523983gmail_extra"><br><div class="ygrps-yiv-1784523983gmail_quote">On Sat, Jan 28, 2017 at 5:11 PM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:semajrak@...">semajrak@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups. com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1784523983gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

Generally there is an understanding that it might be tricky in the beginning of any new pursuit.  I feel like unschoolers might be especially well equipped to understand and embrace that reality. They also might better understand that if it&#39;s not something that really appeals to them--if the effort isn&#39;t worth the reward--they can move on to find and try other things.  <br><br>Karen James</span></div><p></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537825223">Also, unschoolers who have stepped away from the conveyor belt and schedule of school years and ages could relax about *when* a child goes to college, if at all.  My middle son is a junior at the University of New Mexico, studying Economics.  He’s 28.  We’re paying for it, for him.  If one of our other kids wants to go to school, we’ll pay for that too.  The interest gained on having had dthat money in savings (CDs, bonds) is probably better than student loan interest, too.  Had we pressured any of them to go to college at 18, they wouldn’t have known what they wanted to do, might have wasted time and money, and been in debt (they would be, or we might be).  <br/>
<br/>
If you think of learning in and about the world, that can go on for years, for life, and along the way there might be jobs from which learning will come, too.  My kids have all learned tons on various jobs.<br/>

Part of that is about birth control.  In the absence of legal birth control (whether in time, or in locale), once people are married, they’re likely to have a baby, that means some opportunitites are shut down for a while.  If a family wanted to help a son, especially, to be able to be a responsible father and husband, he needed to have a career before he got married.   Many things are different now.  Lots of things have changed, and it gives us all, older parents, young adults, teens, many more options.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;At 13, he shouldn’t be looking at work, or math, or writing, or “peers.”  Unschooled peers?  <br>
<br> </span></blockquote>Thank you for this discussion.  I can understand that most 13 year old unschoolers wouldn&#39;t be looking at work, math, writing or peers. His older brother definitely was not at that age.  But Will certainly is!!  He has never been to school.  He is a highly driven kid.   He loves playing basketball and baseball.  He joined a higher level team for each sport about 2 years ago.  He is the only unschooler on either team, there is 1 school-at-home kid on one of the teams.  Since joining these teams, these issues have surfaced.  The coaches tell the kids they are preparing them for high school sports.  Will is playing because he loves playing with kids who love playing as much as he does.   He loves the challenge.  His favorite thing is to push his body further than he thought possible.   He does not have to attend high school to play sports on a high school team here in Colorado.  I have explained to him that we can continue to unschool and he can try out for local high school teams anyway.<br><br></div>Ever since joining these teams, he has become interested in what it would be like to be part of a school crowd.  A lot of the boys on his baseball team talk about having girlfriends, and for a little while, he decided to try out dating a girl who was a friend of a friend.  He went to movies and out to meals on dates.  Then he decided that he wasn&#39;t ready for that kind of thing and broke it off.  Kids ask him things like what is your favorite subject, where are you going to high school?  He has developed answers to these questions that make him feel comfortable socially, but he still questions these things himself, at home, with me.  <br><br></div>He has a group of friends who live locally and who are homeschoolers.  But none of them are unschoolers.  One has a private tutor to keep up with grade level.  Another follows an online curriculum.  Another does &quot;school&quot; everyday until noon and then has freedom in the afternoons.  He was never bothered to compare himself to other kids until recently.  He became acutely aware that his handwriting looked younger than his friends&#39;.  Since then, he has practiced writing almost daily for 2 years and now has beautiful handwriting that he is proud of.  He decided to learn cursive recently so that he could read cursive handwriting.  <br><br></div>I think he has conversations with his homeschooling friends, who lately have become competitive with each other, about grade levels and skills.  He asked to do the curriculum that 2 of these friends were doing so that he could also be ready for high school.  All of his homeschool friends plan to go to high school.  I think they text about how much fun it will be to go to school together when they are in high school.  I am definitely not pushing him to go to high school.  <br> <br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div class="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail_extra"><div class="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail_quote"><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-text"><p>
Is there someone doing to him what you say he is doing to his younger brothers?<br>
Don’t let him do that.  Don’t “balance his words.”  Protect your children from damaging pressure from others, even from each other, if you can do it.<br></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I do not think anyone is saying this type of thing to him.  He often says sharp, biting or witty statements.  I do feel as though part of my job is to balance out the harshness of his words.  His brothers chuckle to me about Will, &quot;Mom, he&#39;s saying these crazy things again!  Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;  And they run off and play somewhere else.  I have felt pretty good about how his younger brothers are doing in light of this.  But I am concerned about Will and his feelings about being uneducated and behind.  He hasn&#39;t come out and said that he resents being unschooled, but at times, I do think he feels it.  <br><br></div><div>Sarah&#39;s point about opportunity cost is a great one.  You can&#39;t have it all!  When you are a 13 year old kid who has lived differently from everyone around you, it would be hard to not think about how if he had been in school like everyone else, he&#39;d automatically be ready for high school.  So I gave up the opportunity for him to be at grade level through the school method, but he has been able to immerse himself in sports, one of his great passions.  He has been able to gain expert skills at gaming, and has learned to control the rage that he used to get during gaming.  He has been able to spend days and days watching films, another passion.  <br><br></div><div>Right now, he is looking at all that through the eyes of judging middle schoolers.  They are likely repeating judgments from their parents about gaming, watching movies and sports as being for down time, or for relaxation.  So he feels uneducated because he doesn&#39;t know how to multiply fractions or write an essay.  And then his first attempt at getting caught up was so overwhelming that he quit, and now feels doomed to be &quot;uneducated.&quot;<br><br></div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-190445628gmail-m_-3951896143787029606ygrp-text"><p>
I think there’s something going on besides great unschooling, if he’s angry and you’re asking about high school.<br>
I hope you’re not pushing them. I hope you’re living a rich full life with them, not leaving them to try to do it on their own.<br></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>Yes, maybe I am not involved enough throughout the day.  Will likes to spend a lot of time in his room, by himself, usually texting and snapchatting with friends or watching videos on youtube.  He talks to me about his conversations and which friends he talks to the most, but I am certainly not involved directly in the conversations.  There have been some very tough situations where he has had to completely block a friend because of bullying and during those situations, I do sit and read the text conversations with him.   Sometimes I think about his life-- sports for 3 hours every evening and most of the weekend days, up late on social media with friends at night, waking around noon, reading and watching sports replays for a couple hours, playing with brothers, getting ready to go back to sports again... and I wish we had more time to do other things.  He wants to do the sports.  But I could be bringing more in.<br></div><div> <br></div><div>Ali<br></div><div><br><br> </div></span></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883606023">*** There is a huge pressure to conform socially at that age ***<br/>
<br/>
It’s not just peer pressure. It’s biology too. Kids in the 11-14 year range can become very concerned about whether they’re up to speed with their peers.<br/>
<br/>
In social mammals, adolescence is when the juveniles join the adults in adult work, under supervision. In lions the juveniles will be at the edge of the hunt, observing, participating in a lesser capacity as they learn what to do to contribute to the group.<br/>
<br/>
Preadolescence is naturally a time of asking “Am I ready? What can I do to be ready to contribute to the group?”<br/>
<br/>
Of course our society isn’t set up so that childhood flows into real contributing work with a child&#39;s tribe. But it doesn’t stop biology from starting the process! I would bet that his strong draw to sports teams coincides with a strong need to compare himself to them. He’s subconsciously asking if he’s ready to fit in. And he’s feeling he isn’t. He isn’t doing what they’re doing. <br/>
<br/>
I think the more you can *reasonably* support him in exploring what he believes will help will help. He’ll see that what feels like &quot;preparation to join the tribe” is really just a bunch of hoops the kids are jumping through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284874417">-=-I think he has conversations with his homeschooling friends, who lately have become competitive with each other, about grade levels and skills.  He asked to do the curriculum that 2 of these friends were doing so that he could also be ready for high school.  All of his homeschool friends plan to go to high school.  I think they text about how much fun it will be to go to school together when they are in high school.  I am definitely not pushing him to go to high school.  <br/>
 -=-<br/>
<br/>
If he wants to play sports, he’ll need to keep a 3.0 average, probably, too, so if sports is the main goal I can understand his concern.  That’s different from the college-at-18 trajectory I had first imagined.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do not think anyone is saying this type of thing to him.  He often says sharp, biting or witty statements.  I do feel as though part of my job is to balance out the harshness of his words.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Harmful and hurtful shouldn’t be dismissed  as “witty.”  If someone is harming your child’s peace and prosperity, you should top it even if it’s coming from another of your children.  Don’t balance it. Prevent it.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could make it part of the condition of his sports activity that he NOT bring the school-style behaviors home.  Yes, school has a hierarchy and accepts low-level bullying because there is high-level bullying to contrast it with.  You don’t need to “balance” that in an unschooling home.  You can say “keep it at school.”<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, maybe I am not involved enough throughout the day.  Will likes to spend a lot of time in his room, by himself, usually texting and snapchatting with friends or watching videos on youtube.  He talks to me about his conversations and which friends he talks to the most, but I am certainly not involved directly in the conversations.  There have been some very tough situations where he has had to completely block a friend because of bullying and during those situations, I do sit and read the text conversations with him.   Sometimes I think about his life-- sports for 3 hours every evening and most of the weekend days, up late on social media with friends at night, waking around noon, reading and watching sports replays for a couple hours, playing with brothers, getting ready to go back to sports again... and I wish we had more time to do other things.  He wants to do the sports.  But I could be bringing more in.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could arrange an overnight or weekend road trip with him.  That can be extremely therapeutic for a parent/child dyad.  Drive far, do something very cool (sports event, concert, play, or a museum related to his interests).  Stay in a hotel.  Eat in restaurants.  Vacation.  Drive back.  <br/>
<br/>
The event will creat a memory.  The drive will provide time to relax and talk without “sitting down to talk.”  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355228832">I liked Belinda’s post except for this:  &quot;If you have a vague feeling something is ‘missing’, so will he.  “<br/>
<br/>
Something “missing” is not a concrete thing, though.  It would be a wistfulness within a person’s soul.  So if one is missing it, the other might not be at all.<br/>
<br/>
But if he’s still young and communications are lacking, maybe the parents can rearrange their time with him and the quality of their presence.  Still, he might not be as needy as they are. :-)<br/>

But it doesn&#39;t change his feeling of being &quot;uneducated&quot; so I&#39;m thinking that perhaps my interpretation of his cocooning in his room by himself as natural and healthy is edging on neglect!  I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ll force him to do worksheets.  But I&#39;ll offer to take him out to do more, help him find films he&#39;d enjoy, etc.  He can always say no.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274592889">I have a thought regarding careers that is pertinent to this thread (this is my first AL post!).<br/>
<br/>
When I was in grade 11 or so, I remember sort of flailing, trying to decide what among my many interests and talents would be suitable for My Career and My University Education (capitalization for emphasis - it all felt very very important). <br/>
<br/>
My mom said: &quot; you don&#39;t have to decide what you&#39;re going to do for the rest of your life right now. You just have to decide what you&#39;re going to do first.&quot; (Yes, &quot;have-to&quot; alert!!....Mom isn&#39;t an unschooler).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the have-to can be replaced with &quot;get to&quot; or &quot;have the opportunity to&quot; and it makes it much more exciting. <br/>
<br/>
Her words have been floating around in my mind a lot recently as I have moved from working as an engineer (a career I put about 15 years into that turned out not to be compatible with the kind of mother I choose to be) to homeschooling my kids and teaching my hobby for some additional income. It was easier to move on to the next thing knowing all along that there wasn&#39;t an expectation of permanence.<br/>

Your mom’s statment is fine!  She was excusing you from someone else’s “have to.”  <br/>
The “have to” alert should only kick in when someone is saying “Well, we have to…” or “he has to…” without an if/then.  (I have to use the clutch to put my car in gear; that’s a fact.)<br/>

<br/>
But it changes the meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Life changes, and faster now than it did before, and not as fast as it will later.<br/>
Pressing a kid to decide isn’t as good as helping a child explore.<br/>
