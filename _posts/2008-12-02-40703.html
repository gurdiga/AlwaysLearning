Hi Sandra, <br/>
Thanks....I had already printed them out to send to family and friends before I saw that you had collected them all in one spot!  I should have known that you would be way ahead of me ;)<br/>
I&#39;m glad that you and Pam put it all together!<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Beth in Ma<br/>

There&#39;s a typo in #10 (someone sent it and I was glad!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I fixed it on the webpage.  &quot;Plant&quot; should be &quot;Plan&quot; in that paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could&#39;ve just sent people to the page in the first place, but I&#39;m  <br/>
hoping for discussion of the individual items, so I made each one its  <br/>
own topic.<br/>
<br/>
