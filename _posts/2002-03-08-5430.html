Literacy:<br/>
A boy and his father were walking along a road when they came across a large <br/>
stone. The boy said to his father,&quot;Do yo think if I use all my strength, I <br/>
can move this rock?&quot; His father answered, &quot;If you use all your strength, I am <br/>
sure you can do it.&quot; The boy began to push the rock. Exerting himself as much <br/>
as he could, he pushed and pushed. The rock did not move. Discouraged, he <br/>
said to his father, &quot;You were wrong. I can&#39;t do it.&quot; His father placed his <br/>
arm around the boy&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;No, son. You din&#39;t use ALL your <br/>
strength--you didn&#39;t ask me to help.&quot;<br/>
