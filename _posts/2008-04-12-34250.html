I would do more talking to Marti than Lilly about it.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I have tried to talk to Marti a bit. She is the type that jumps to<br/>
conclusions and, for lack of a better word, is a &quot;drama queen&quot;. This is what<br/>
she says to me when I try and talk to her about it (and go with a very huffy<br/>
and irritated voice here), &quot;Are you saying I HAVE to play with Lilly?&quot;<br/>
Totally not what I am saying, but she must hear that. Apparently I don&#39;t<br/>
know how to talk to her so that I *don&#39;t* get those kinds of responses<br/>
though. She often says things like that in that tone of voice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
In exchange for that, then you could give her lots of uninterrupted<br/>
time so that Lilly starts to see that sometimes Marti needs time<br/>
alone, but it won&#39;t be a long series of &quot;no&quot; with an occasional &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I think we do give her a lot of uninterrupted time, but I will ask and see<br/>
what she thinks.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Also, I bet they could get along better outside the house, away from<br/>
Marti&#39;s possessions and space.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I think you&#39;re right and I love your suggestions, however that brings me to<br/>
another post I have been meaning to write...<br/>
<br/>
We are without a vehicle right now. Are there any unschoolers out there who<br/>
manage without a car?<br/>
<br/>
We live on a bus route, but our car breaking down has been a *huge*<br/>
lifestyle change for us. It takes a long time to get somewhere on the bus<br/>
and the bus is really hot, which is not something we can control and the<br/>
three of us (Me and the girls) get motion sickness, especially when its hot.<br/>
We also can&#39;t go to places that we went before, because they are either not<br/>
on the bus route at all or we would need to transfer busses multiple times.<br/>
Like, we used to go to one particular library on the other side of the town<br/>
next to us. It took us about 1/2 hour to get there by car, but it would take<br/>
1 1/2 hours on the bus to get there and 2 to get home, plus we would have to<br/>
transfer busses 4 times and it would cost us nearly $12.<br/>
<br/>
I know right now, I am feeling trapped and I think Lilly especially is too.<br/>
We are not sure when we are going to be able to get the car fixed. Much of<br/>
the money we are saving in gas is either going into savings to get the car<br/>
fixed or to pay for rides on the bus. I need a big perspective change when<br/>
it comes to this, I think.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a couple of parks nearby, that is to say a 20+ minute walk away,<br/>
and we try to get out to them when Daddy has the day off of work (so that we<br/>
can take both strollers because the girls are obviously going to be tired on<br/>
the way home and not want to walk), but that is only 2 days a week and it is<br/>
spring so if it&#39;s cold or raining on one of those two days, we are out of<br/>
luck.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I got Roya to try out playing with Roxana for an hour first thing in the<br/>
day.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I will see if there is a good time for Marti. Right now we are at a point<br/>
that the only time Marti wants to play with Lilly is when we go upstairs at<br/>
night for bed and at that point Lilly is tired. She has asked to go to bed<br/>
and she even tells Marti to stop &quot;jumping on the bed&quot; and &quot;roughhousing&quot;<br/>
because she is tired.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
With us, I would ask Kirby to do something Marty liked for a while<br/>
sometimes. And occasionally I would offer Kirby money to distract<br/>
Marty while I needed to do something else. He would read to him, or<br/>
play something strenuous outside. The difference between those times<br/>
and the play-by-choice times were a little like a practice job for<br/>
Kirby. It was always optional. Sometimes he wanted money to buy<br/>
Ninja Turtles.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
If I *ask* Marti to play with Lilly the answer is always an automatic &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
Even if she isn&#39;t doing anything. Maybe because I have asked too many times<br/>
when she has been doing something, I am not sure, but I try really hard not<br/>
to do that to her. I know that she sees things way differently than I do<br/>
though so it is, of course, possible.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatley paying her isn&#39;t an option right now due mostly to the car<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587313519">-=-&quot;Are you saying I HAVE to play with Lilly?&quot;<br/>
Totally not what I am saying, but she must hear that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;Why are you using that tone of voice, can&#39;t we talk  <br/>
about it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would likely talk about things (not all at once, but one once in a  <br/>
while, unless she&#39;s into a long conversation about it) like what if  <br/>
she were the younger sister?  But my first mental response to &quot;Are  <br/>
you saying I HAVE to play with Lilly?&quot; was &quot;Are saying you don&#39;t EVER  <br/>
want to play with her!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It can be said in a similar tone of voice, but friendly, and it might  <br/>
surprise her to hear what she has basically just said.<br/>
<br/>
There must be something between you and the park--a vacant lot, a  <br/>
stream, something?  The loading dock behind an old store?  An alley?   <br/>
McDonald&#39;s with a play place?  Thrift store?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to add something about Kirby and &quot;practice jobs.&quot;  When I  <br/>
talked to him today,  he said a guy who&#39;s been staying with them is  <br/>
moving back to Albuquerque tomorrow morning, and they asked Kirby if  <br/>
he wanted to call in and hang out the rest of the day.  He told them  <br/>
he couldn&#39;t call in 45 minutes before a shift, but he hoped they had  <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
He told me he *could* call in, and he has two days of vacation, but  <br/>
that &quot;there would be a cost in good will.&quot;  He&#39;s pretty responsible  <br/>
for a 21 year old.<br/>
