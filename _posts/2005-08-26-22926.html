<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084263010">Someone posted about horseback lessons...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am located in the south valley about ten minutes from the Big-I.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Secret code, that&#39;s in Albuquerque.   Never mind; I&#39;ve written with <br/>
suggestions for local lists to put it on.   On the other hand, if any of you are in <br/>
Albuquerque...   or want to come stay at my house while you take a few lessons <br/>
with cool yoga-type prep exercises...<br/>
<br/>
Please keep local and timely business off this list, though.   I&#39;m aiming for <br/>
timeless and philosophical.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
