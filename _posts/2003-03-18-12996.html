<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413965971">Nancy, this is how I got to the list. First, I went to Sandra Dodd <br/>
on Unschooling, then to Radical Unschooling, then dropped down to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> and then join the membership. I never <br/>
saw anything that said it was an advanced group. But thats where it <br/>
took me. I am sorry. Im not only new at unschooling also new at the <br/>
computer. My son started school at 4 in Headstart. Then at 5 <br/>
kindergarden. At 6 first grade. At 7 second grade. Took him out at <br/>
the end of Jan. of this <br/>
year.                                                                <br/>
    Brenda, Thanks a Million for your help. You told me everything I <br/>
need to here. This is going to be fun. I maybe 51 yrs old but can <br/>
still be a kid. What great excuse for getting out of housework. lol <br/>
I just wanted to say Thanks for the help I got today.  Pam</div>

 </span></blockquote>No need to apologize :-)  I just wondered, because I used to moderate a<br/>
large list in San Diego; it had a sudden influx of members when someone<br/>
posted a link to it from her website.  It&#39;s interesting to me how people<br/>
find their homeschooling information.<br/>
