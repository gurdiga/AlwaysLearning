I dont know if I told you (all), but I started an italian list for  <br/>
&quot;apprendimento naturale&quot;<br/>
the address is:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/apprendimentonaturale/?yguid=286713246">http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/apprendimentonaturale/?yguid=286713246</a><br/>
it is definitely new, but I am finding alot of people interested. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Two new local resources are on this page now:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>
<br/>
If anyone has time to check it, I&#39;d appreciate knowing if some of  <br/>
those groups are defunct, or if there are new ones!  I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
list just any old homeschooling group if there&#39;s a good, strong  <br/>
unschooling group to list.  (When there isn&#39;t, any old homeschooling  <br/>
group is better than nothing.)<br/>
