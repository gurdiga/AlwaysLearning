&gt;<br/>
&gt;My almost 10yo son is currently having a lot of fun doing bad imitations of <br/>
&gt;bad Elvis imitations, in reply to almost every comment or question. (He&#39;s our <br/>
&gt;stand up comedian). I realized he probably hasn&#39;t ever seen the real thing. <br/>
&gt; [:)]  Suggestions for a first dose appreciated, bearing in mind that he&#39;s at the <br/>
&gt;age when sappy love stories send him fleeing the room.   [:)] <br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Time for a road-trip to Graceland, Deb!<br/>
<br/>
I cracked up the other day when I saw something I had forgotten about. <br/>
 When Will was 6, he had me write, in black Sharpie marker on the back <br/>
of his dark blue batting helmet, &quot;You don&#39;t know I&#39;m Elvis.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to see unless you&#39;re looking for it---but isn&#39;t it a cool <br/>
thing to know that it&#39;s there?  LOL. In 2-1/2 seaons and countless games <br/>
and practices, how many people have picked up that helmet in 2 years, <br/>
and noticed it or not?  And what in the world did they think, if they <br/>
did notice?  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I saw a bumper sticker that said &quot;Who died and made you Elvis!?<br/>
<br/>
You know where I live, Deborah.  Let me know when you&#39;re coming!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Tuck in MElvis...I mean, Memphis!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And of course I&#39;m not suggesting that. I&#39;m not even suggesting telling him <br/>
that this guy is a DANGER. I&#39;m suggesting letting Matthew in on this bit of <br/>
information because I know Matthew and I know Dan and I think Dan&#39;s feeling <br/>
like Mathew would appreciate knowing - feel like Dan had held out something <br/>
from him - but that Dan is really not wanting the &quot;golden age&quot; of childhood <br/>
to end for Matthew. I dont want that either. I care a LOT about Matthew. I <br/>
think Matthew could be made aware of it without it being a thing that would <br/>
associate horrible ugliness with robotics. I think he is starting ANYWAY to <br/>
get a sense of how people are complex. He&#39;s learning already that his friends <br/>
are not perfect - that sometimes he doesn&#39;t really like certain aspects of <br/>
them. He also REALLY trusts his dad to bring things to his attention - I sort <br/>
of think he&#39;d feel a little duped by not being told that his dad has major <br/>
misgivings about some guy while pretending to Matthew that the guy is just <br/>
wonderful. I just don&#39;t think it would be all that awful for Matthew to hear: <br/>
&quot;Yuck, some people are just so surprising in their weird and STUPID ideas. <br/>
Here we&#39;ve got this guy who is so brilliant in robotics and so idiotic in <br/>
this other belief.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mathew is going to hear this stuff anyway - so I don&#39;t think it matters so <br/>
much whether or not you tell him about THIS.  He&#39;s also going to hear racist <br/>
and homophobic stuff even from people he cares about, for example. It has <br/>
gone over his head but it won&#39;t for long. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How much detail do you give a six year old about what could happen to them <br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; they get lured into a car by a stranger?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this is relevant. Matthew isn&#39;t a 6 yo and we&#39;re not talking <br/>
about that kind of stuff. And Dan can use his judgement about how graphic he <br/>
wants to be about white supremists - not very, I wouldn&#39;t think, not now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Racism won&#39;t be created nor destroyed by Matthew&#39;s awareness.  Matthew&#39;s <br/>
&gt; youth will be made uglier, though.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mathew is a sensitive kid who is going to notice this stuff. It is going to <br/>
upset him. A situation like this might be the way to begin to talk about it <br/>
together so that his mom and dad can help him deal with it. <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe not - I could be way off base.<br/>
