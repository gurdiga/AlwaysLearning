I saw you mention Battle ground and had to write and find out.  Did you live there?  Near there?  We are actually planning to move to Battle Ground (or somewhere REALLY close to it) in the spring.  It&#39;s crazy beacuse I had never even heard of it before but once I decided to move there everywhere I turn people are mentioning it.  Seriously, it must be a good sign.  :)  I&#39;m trying to learn all I can about the area and so far I LOVE everything I have found out.  I so look forward to living somewhere green and small!!  :) Anyway, if there is anything you could tell me about the area I would love to know.  What&#39;s the unschooling environment there?  Or maybe you don&#39;t live there at all... But you&#39;ve &#39;been&#39; there right?  :)<br/>

I&#39;ve seen this Naturopath mentioned all over in the stuff on the web.  Definatly have to hook up with her when we get there :)<br/>

Dr. Jill Stansbury was our Naturopath up North, and I&#39;ve seen her quoted in  <br/>
several books since I&#39;ve left. She was extremely thorough and well trained.  <br/>
Her practice is in Battleground,WA if anyone gets up there. Just across the  <br/>
