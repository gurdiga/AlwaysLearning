<div id="ygrps-yiv-248128872">we joined a charter last year, at the<br/>
beginning of the year.  It&#39;s been pretty<br/>
good, the EA we have leaves us alone, I email<br/>
her my monthly summary of what Lexie has done<br/>
and Mark drops off the attendance form or she<br/>
comes and gets it.  We&#39;ve seen her 3 x since<br/>
September.  So I&#39;m Ok with that.  But we have<br/>
like $500 to spend (now that Lexie wont&#39; go<br/>
to that school) and I am wondering how to<br/>
spend it.  In Septemeber Lexie picked out<br/>
some work books--two critical thinking books,<br/>
the HP reading guide (I only let her get one,<br/>
I wanted to see them before spending $ on<br/>
them), a few math books (Time and Money, and<br/>
a cuisenaire rod one), and a few other work<br/>
book type things.  She made most of the<br/>
choices. Janene also choose a few things in<br/>
Sept (Linking elephants and a book for<br/>
them.)   I&#39;d like to stay away from work<br/>
books now, though.  We have plenty of books<br/>
for her to read, chapter books, and such,<br/>
although I want to buy the rest of the<br/>
American Girl series.  We;ve read Meet Addy<br/>
and one other and she likes them, although<br/>
they are too easy for her to read, the<br/>
content is right on, and she loves history.<br/>
Lexie agrees that is good choice.  We are<br/>
also looking for a Spanish program as she<br/>
wants to continue the spanish.  I was<br/>
thinking art supplies, but what else to spend<br/>
that money on? any suggestions?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ooh, how fun! <br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the things we got and enjoyed when we were<br/>
chartering...:<br/>
<br/>
Cuisenaire rods<br/>
<br/>
Pattern blocks<br/>
<br/>
Kapla Blocks<br/>
<br/>
Those other wooden blocks that are styled after a peticular time in<br/>
history, like Roman Arch blocks and Medieval blocks... you can build such<br/>
cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Tie Dye Kit (Dick Blick had a good one)<br/>
<br/>
Science Kits - Wild Goose has some fun ones, we especially liked the<br/>
little &quot;Loose in the Lab&quot; ones, although we tended to experiment outside<br/>
of their directions<br/>
<br/>
Good watercolors and watercolor paper<br/>
<br/>
Watercolor-paper  postcards<br/>
<br/>
Brushes<br/>
<br/>
Sculpey or Fimo clay<br/>
<br/>
Computer software - Zoombinis, Oregon Trail, Roller Coaster Tycoon,<br/>
Amazon Trail, Age of Empires... maybe they&#39;d balk at The Sims<br/>
<br/>
Good colored pencils <br/>
<br/>
Sketchpads <br/>
<br/>
Games - Set, Quarto, chess...whatever you&#39;re into<br/>
<br/>
American Girls paper dolls - except that cutting them out is a PITA<br/>
<br/>
Linoleum blocks and printing supplies<br/>
<br/>
Beads and beading supplies<br/>
<br/>
Make Your Own Paper kit<br/>
<br/>
Big rolls of butcher paper<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more... almost all  of this can be bought through<br/>
Rainbow Resource, Nasco, or Dick Blick.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, you&#39;ll ask Lexie and Janene what sounds good to them...<br/>
sometimes Cacie would just thumb through catalogs and pick stuff out.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tickets to the theater, memberships to museums, zoos or parks?<br/>
A road trip to somewhere that $500 will cover?<br/>
<br/>
Ice skates, rollerblades, musical instruments, craft kits, $25 to go spend <br/>
at a thrift store, movie passes, computer games, video games, a calligraphy <br/>
set?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;d like to join one of those Scholastic Book clubs. I know they <br/>
have one for Little House on the Prairie. Each month they send you a book, a <br/>
craft ,newsletter and such.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe use some of that money as seed money to start a little business with <br/>
her or to start a fundraising project for a favorite charity?<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and art supplies. ;-)<br/>

Hi Joylyn,<br/>
<br/>
We did the charter school thing this year (this will<br/>
also be the last year of it due to increasing<br/>
regulation and required testing as of next year!). I<br/>
can tell you some of the things Tamzin has picked out<br/>
that have gone down a treat.<br/>
Watercolor paints and paper, butterfly garden (we<br/>
haven&#39;t used this yet - will do in the spring),<br/>
various educational games and puzzles, CD Roms,<br/>
Audubon guides, recorder and music books, Pattern<br/>
Blocks, weaving loom (made loads of Christmas pressies<br/>
with this one!), beginning sewing book, glitter paint,<br/>
and a knitting spool. I know there are other things as<br/>
well, but those are the ones off the top of my head.<br/>
We get most of our supplies from the Rainbow Resource<br/>
Center (great prices!) and Dick Blick Art Materials<br/>
(funny name and great prices!).<br/>
As far as language programs, The Learnables is<br/>
supposed to be great. Total immersion program that<br/>
focuses on just listening at the start. I have some<br/>
friends that use it and love it. We&#39;re planning to get<br/>
it (hopefully from the charter school library!).<br/>
Tamzin loves Madeline and France and &quot;wants to learn<br/>
French better&quot;. The other advice I&#39;ve gotten about<br/>
learning a new language is to just listen to<br/>
everything you can find in the language that you want<br/>
to learn for the first year (at least). Particularly<br/>
children&#39;s songs and stories (they have the simplest,<br/>
most regular speech patterns apparently). <br/>
Happy Shopping!<br/>
<br/>

 They had the old one, too, but we already have it.<br/>

Boolieville!  :)<br/>

catalog, they&#39;ll prob&#39;ly sell it to you.  $20 or less.  I think I got it free <br/>
for buying another game (which is almost always their offer, which makes <br/>
things half price or so...)<br/>
