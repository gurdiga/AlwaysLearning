<div id="ygrps-yiv-836518471">woke up early this am and got a  declined membership to a  group  <br/>
and  went out of room and  my computer crashed I mean crash! said <br/>
complete  hard drive failer. wont boot evenn with a disk nota I run 3 <br/>
virus protecters. (one I pay thru the nose for) 2 fire walls and the <br/>
puter is exatly one year and 3 days old.<br/>
I also  start a 20 streach at  work tue of  5 am. to 4 p.m<br/>
  I got hubbys puter up and running but I havent had it net ready in <br/>
over a year so dont trust it . I will try and change to diegest to <br/>
stop the  bouncing that happens when mailbox gets to full.<br/>
I doubt the crash has much to do with. the  decline letter I recived. <br/>
but they had been having problems is why they closed there <br/>
membership. It probley due to  the  timing of the warenty . lol it <br/>
did tell me to take off any thing I had recently  put in computer ans <br/>
I hadn&#39;t any thing new. <br/>
this is just my week lol after I went upstair I also descovered my <br/>
fridge  had  gave up on me. Then went to work to find I need to fix a <br/>
ice cream machine . not my day to day.<br/>
maybe tommorow will be better.<br/>
