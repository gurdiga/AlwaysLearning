&lt;&lt; Falcons? As in peregrine and ? Ooooooo Tell us. Tell<br/>
 us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well...I&#39;ll be a falconer, but I won&#39;t own a falcon to start with. The term <br/>
Falconry means hunting with a falcon OR hawk. Owning one does not qualify a <br/>
person as a Falconer, only if you hunt with it.<br/>
It&#39;s an ancient form of hunting dating back to around 2,000BC and popularized <br/>
in Medieval times in Europe when Royalty often hunted this way.<br/>
I will start with a Red-tailed Hawk. My sponsor says if I hurry up and pass <br/>
my test I could start trying to trap one starting in August. <br/>
I&#39;m not ready yet though. I need more time to prepare my property, buy <br/>
equipment and mentally prepare myself for hacking up cute little rabbits and <br/>
squirrels. <br/>
Seems quite a strange sport for an almost vegetarian eh? I must be nuts.<br/>
Can&#39;t get rid of this feeling of complete excitement and awe though....it&#39;s <br/>
definitely something I&#39;ve always dreamed of doing.<br/>

What does this involve?  What will you need to do to your property, and what <br/>
sort of equipment is required?  This sounds really intriguing!<br/>
