<div id="ygrps-yiv-920252239">I started a list for unschoolers who like manga and anime. All ages  <br/>
welcome. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I know there are unschooling conferences coming up and I thought it  <br/>
would be a great way for kids to meet before the conference and maybe  <br/>
have some already in place friends before they get there :-)<br/>

Interest is the key not kid status.<br/>
