<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563375584">I guess I finally get what people mean when they say they found Jesus and <br/>
were saved. That &#39;s how I&#39;m feeling about unschooling. <br/>
    I am questioning so many of the old beliefs I carry that block joy. <br/>
    I  feel  overwhelmed with grief when I think of the ten years I have been <br/>
parenting my son from a place of judgement. I think that is a normal reaction <br/>
because it is a lose. I feel inspired to parent from a place of unconditional love <br/>
and acceptance (which I actually thought I was doing before). I could cry <br/>
about the 10 years wasted or say &quot;Thank God he&#39;s just turning 10&quot; ! There is <br/>
still time! <br/>
    I feel grateful to all of you who contribute and share and especially Sandra <br/>
Dodd who&#39;s writings have changed my life.<br/>
     My last thread of fear is attached to video games and television.(At least it&#39;s <br/>
only a thread. A month ago it was a steel cable). I&#39;ve let go of  total control but <br/>
still loosely limit time. I let him buy a hunting game that he&#39;s been wanting <br/>
where you kill animals. I tried watching while he played because he wanted <br/>
me to and it was more than I could handle. I felt so disturbed by it. I bowed out <br/>
as unjudmentally as I could but didn&#39;t tell him that he couldn&#39;t play. It was a big <br/>
step for me. I don&#39;t understand it though, why he would enjoy a game like that. <br/>
I&#39;m really hung up on this video thing.</div>

You&#39;re welcome!  I&#39;m glad your son&#39;s life is opening up.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t quote your video games paragraph on the &quot;if only&quot; page,  <br/>
because I think you&#39;ll get over it.  Ren used to be anti-TV, and I  <br/>
quoted her, and then I added in when she changed her mind.   That&#39;s  <br/>
pretty cool to read.  It&#39;s here:  http://sandradodd/t/debate<br/>

I&#39;m probably one of the only other people here that do believe it&#39;s  <br/>
ok to limit TV when necessary. I find my one son getting very lazy  <br/>
and not interested in other activities for DAYS on end if I don&#39;t say  <br/>
anything. If I say &quot;ok, enough TV for today&quot; and suggest that we do  <br/>
something, he is usually glad for it. If he&#39;s in the middle of  <br/>
something he really wants to watch I just say &quot;ok, when that&#39;s over  <br/>
do you think we could go do something?&quot; and he always is fine with  <br/>
that. I have relaxed a lot over the whole issue but I think there are  <br/>
some kids that are more addictive and affected by it than others. I  <br/>
just disagree with total self regulation on that topic....sorry. I do  <br/>
believe it is best to be relaxed over it and I&#39;m glad that self- <br/>
regulation works for all of you. Ren changed her mind about this  <br/>
later.read about her change of heart<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I challenge you to actually sit down and play the game for a while.  My dh<br/>
is a big gamer.  He plays on-line with other gamers and he sometimes plays<br/>
with my dd�s when they are interested.  It used to bother me a lot.  It<br/>
wasn�t until I actually sat down and played with them that I found out how<br/>
different it is when you are playing.  It isn�t about killing actual people<br/>
(it�s much worse to watch than play) and when you are playing you get caught<br/>
up in the challenge of it all and you just want to kill them before they<br/>
kill you.  It�s like cops and robbers as a kid.  It doesn�t make you<br/>
violent.  My dh is one of the most gentle souls I know, yet he plays these<br/>
games often.  I am huge animal lover and the hunting one might be harder for<br/>
me than the people shooting one but until I�ve actually played it I would<br/>
not pass judgment on it.  And even then, it may not be the same for you as<br/>
it is for him.  He may just find it a challenge as a man to be able to hunt<br/>
effectively.  You are probably seeing it as killing innocent animals.<br/>
Either way, it�s just a video game and he�s not out plucking of squirrels<br/>
with a BB gun behind your back.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was a kid I used to fold up papers and drop them into the  <br/>
trash when other kids crumpled. I still, as an adult, can&#39;t rip  <br/>
wrapping paper off gifts. I have to remove it neatly. I just have a  <br/>
problem destroying things people have spent time crafting. (Even  <br/>
school notices ;-) My daughter Kat is very similar. And yet we both  <br/>
had a lot of fun playing Godzilla Destroy All Monsters and not only  <br/>
destroy monsters but cities too.<br/>
<br/>
Kat will say mean things to characters she doesn&#39;t like and send them  <br/>
ugly shirts in Animal Crossing. But in real life she&#39;s very conscious  <br/>
of not hurting people&#39;s feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I read murder mysteries, but it doesn&#39;t make me want to murder  <br/>
anyone. (Or question people who might be murders to find the real  <br/>
killer ;-) I like to watch strong characters like Xena and Buffy and  <br/>
anime characters too numerous to mention slice and dice the bad guys  <br/>
and other nasties. It doesn&#39;t make me want to take up a sword and  <br/>
kill things or feel depressed that I&#39;ll never master Kamehameha times  <br/>
ten and blow up planets. I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and could  <br/>
wallop a board or a pad pretty well but it didn&#39;t make me want to  <br/>
kick someone in the face.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something satisfying in taking out your aggressions on things  <br/>
but in real life there are bad consequences you want to avoid. But in  <br/>
games -- and acting and writing and art and pretending -- it&#39;s  <br/>
possible to act those out and release it without doing anyone harm.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t make me want to smash things in real life because I know  <br/>
the real consequences are still there. I think it&#39;s a very healthy  <br/>
way to play out needs you don&#39;t want to play out in real life.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s worth thinking about seriously. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why would it be harder to kill a squirrel or a duck (and by  <br/>
&quot;squirrel&quot; or &quot;duck,&quot; I mean a pixel-built cartoon in the shape of  <br/>
one) than a person (pixel-built-thereof)?  Or just harder to kill a  <br/>
deer or a gorilla?   I&#39;m okay, personally, with killing spiders but  <br/>
have a harder time with mice; yet I set two mouse traps yesterday  <br/>
when Kirby said the cats had been staring at the stove and one was on  <br/>
the counter.  Those are big mouse-clues.<br/>
<br/>
All of that is much more real-world than a video game.<br/>
<br/>
When people played Galaxy-this&#39;n&#39;that games in the 70&#39;s and early  <br/>
80&#39;s, no one was bemoaning the violence of shooting down space ships.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same programming, whether the &quot;space ships&quot; are mushrooms or  <br/>
falling bees, or ducks, or blocks of wood or color.<br/>
<br/>
The kids can clearly tell the difference between pattern games and  <br/>
violence.<br/>
<br/>
When a mother can NOT tell the difference, she looks less intelligent  <br/>
than she should.<br/>

LOL!   I think because it&#39;s easy for me to see people as the bad guys.  It&#39;s<br/>
harder for me to see animals in that light.  They  just seem so innocent,<br/>
esp. deer or other prey animals. (like big fuzzy horses!) I realize that<br/>
some animals kill and eat each other, but that seems justifiable.  Our cats<br/>
just kill for fun and leave the mole or mouse carcasses on my doorstep like<br/>
a prize.  I always feel bad for those mice but not enough to keep the cats<br/>
inside.  I just wish they&#39;d eat them, all of them and not leave them for me<br/>
to clean up.  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that if I sat down and actually played a hunting game that I could<br/>
get into it just like any other type of game.  It&#39;s always harder to watch<br/>
them than it is to play them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son got a new laptop from his father for his birthday, and he&#39;s <br/>
been attached to it for a week now (he even sleeps with it.) He&#39;s <br/>
been playing a game called Fable for hours a day since last <br/>
Saturday. Yesterday I sat down and watched with him...he explained <br/>
that his hero was &quot;good&quot; (you can be good or evil in the game based <br/>
upon the decisions you make), even wore a little halo, and all the <br/>
people in the towns cheer when he comes (its really funny)...so he <br/>
goes into a new town, and decides he doesnt want to be &quot;good&quot; <br/>
anymore, he wants to try being evil. So he starts slaughtering <br/>
people left and right, mostly guards with weapons. Then he (meaning, <br/>
his character)walks into a house, and there is a defenseless woman <br/>
who starts complimenting him (hoping he&#39;ll spare her life)...i&#39;m <br/>
thinking &quot;He can&#39;t kill this defenseless old lady!!&quot; but in the end, <br/>
he did. I then had to remember what Dan Vilter said during his <br/>
presentation on videogames at the L&L conference in Sept.: Its not <br/>
real.<br/>
<br/>
Its not real. Our kids *know* that....my son would NEVER hurt a <br/>
defenseless old lady cowering in her house. But it wasnt a real <br/>
woman. She doesnt exist. She has no life. She is just a pixilated <br/>
image, and she couldve been *anything*...she just happened to &quot;look <br/>
human.&quot; And my son got joy out of destroying her (it), not because <br/>
killing people is cool, but destroying a target in a game is fun. <br/>
His &quot;evil-ness&quot; went way up in the game. I realized that it was <br/>
fine, that it actually was kind of fun to see how many people you <br/>
can take out in such a short time. <br/>
<br/>
I think his character is back to being a hero, based upon him doing <br/>
some good deeds. <br/>
<br/>
Its amazing how you see the world once you put respecting kids on a <br/>
higher level than maintaining &quot;control&quot; as a parent...in the same <br/>
day i read an article in some magazine about limiting videogames, <br/>
which including maintaining a &quot;half hour&quot; rule on school days and <br/>
only an hour of playing on weekend days. I thought &quot;How the heck can <br/>
the kid get anything done in a game in an hour?!&quot; Then we were <br/>
watching this new show on tv called &quot;6 Degrees&quot;, and the dad told <br/>
the son to stop playing his game, it was bedtime. The kid said &quot;A <br/>
couple more minutes, I&#39;m almost done with this level!!&quot; The dad made <br/>
him turn it off immediately, and then when the kid complained he <br/>
smashed the gameboy. My first thought was &quot;Doesnt this parent know <br/>
that there are only certain &quot;save spots&quot; in the game, and the child <br/>
will lose all his hard work if he stops now!?!&quot; Its so much better <br/>
to be on your child&#39;s side. <br/>

I watched some of Marty&#39;s bad-guy behaviors in Knights of the Old  <br/>
Republic (I think it&#39;s called), a Star Wars Jedi-Knight game.  You  <br/>
can make choices to be a good Jedi or a bad Jedi.  He played the  <br/>
whole game both ways.<br/>
<br/>
Holly played Harvest Moon as well as she could one time until she was  <br/>
rich and popular and then started doing all the wrong things, to see  <br/>
what all the program had in it.  She gave gifts to people she wasn&#39;t  <br/>
married to.  She quit feeding her farm animals, and quit weeding her  <br/>
farm.  She started buying everything and spending all her money and  <br/>
giving her stuff away or throwing it in ponds.  She took a chicken to  <br/>
church and left it there.  It was kind of a hoot!<br/>
<br/>
Now if I were to show that to some of the &quot;half hour limit / video  <br/>
games are satanic&quot; people, would they say &quot;One mother encouraged her  <br/>
daughter to take a chicken to church and leave it there&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
No doubt.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
STUPID dad smashed any hope of a close relationship of trust and love  <br/>
with his biological son.  That boy won&#39;t trust his dad about anything  <br/>
anymore.  Stupid dad.<br/>

Years ago Keith and I went to see Terminator and I was horrified.  I  <br/>
just hated it.<br/>
We went to see Commando, and I LOVED it.  Saw it twice.  Was happy.<br/>
<br/>
Keith was mystified, and asked me why.  I had to think, but I figured  <br/>
it out.<br/>
<br/>
In Terminator he went into public places, and private houses, and  <br/>
killed women who were minding their own business.  Normal women.   <br/>
like me.<br/>
<br/>
In Commando, there were soldiers killing soldiers.  And not just any  <br/>
soldiers, but willing voluntary mercenary soldiers with a personal  <br/>
stake in what was going on.  And it involved the rescue of a little  <br/>
girl.<br/>
<br/>
True Lies was fun just because it was funny.  With a great script,  <br/>
violence can be kind of hilarious.  And that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easier  <br/>
for me to kill a mouse.  And I was SURE that True Lies was fiction,  <br/>
every moment I was watching it.  It also has some fantastic acting  <br/>
and some actors who are much more famous now than they were twelve  <br/>
years ago.<br/>

In Dungeons and Dragons you can change your alignment (how<br/>

character is acting during the game.<br/>
<br/>
If you act out of character for your alignment, you can actually lose<br/>

anyone for no good reason, or break the law. A chaotic evil character<br/>
would be pretty hard to trust as they do whatever benefits themselves.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, I have quite a bit of evidence as I have worked in Law Enforcement for twenty years.<br/>
If you need a particular example, The Deltona Murders was over an Xbox, and the deaths contributed to a style of killing from one of the games.<br/>
Was it a games influence?  Probably not as most people wouldn&#39;t emulate video murder in real life.<br/>
Why did it happen?  The debates could last forever (and have)<br/>
9/11 terrorists were said to train on a flight simulator that had the exact pattern they flew.<br/>
In the game, you are to fly between the towers but as it&#39;s a game, you can fly into the towers.<br/>
My son plays math attacks, and DS Brainage & Brain Academy...guess what?<br/>
His math is sharper then ever.<br/>
We have a friend who designs/creates military video games to train the troops.<br/>
It has been proven to be an excellent training tool.<br/>
If you choose to believe different then me, that is your right, I am not trying to win you over to my way.  My son has learned so much from video games that we have chosen to wait till he is older for that particular one.  <br/>

<br/>
Oh, I love this game!<br/>
<br/>
The 1929   murderers of Bobby Franks were college graduates, intelligent - <br/>
one spoke five languages!  This must be evidence that intelligence, college <br/>
and an interest in foreign language could lead to murder.   Good story if <br/>
you google Leopold/Loeb .<br/>
<br/>
William Corder, who murdered Maria Marten in 1827 was a school teacher.   As <br/>
a kid I suspected teachers were criminals...<br/>
<br/>
Theo Durrant was a medical student when he killed two women in 1895.  In a <br/>
church!   Maybe it&#39;s the study of medicine causes criminal behaviors.  Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s the worship of God.<br/>
<br/>
When serial killer Fritz Haarmann started killing people in 1918 he liked to <br/>
bake and smoke cigars.<br/>
<br/>
 I could site LOTS more and I chose these because they were killing people <br/>
before TV, before rock and roll, before movies and before video games.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
None of these guys played GTA.<br/>
<br/>
People blamed the devil for a long time.  People blamed dime store novels. <br/>
Today people blame the media.   I still blame parents. (and sometimes <br/>
teachers&lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008460204">-=-and the dad told the son to stop playing his game, it was bedtime. The kid said &quot;A <br/>
couple more minutes, I&#39;m almost done with this level!!&quot; The dad made <br/>
him turn it off immediately, and then when the kid complained he <br/>
smashed the gameboy. My first thought was &quot;Doesnt this parent know <br/>
that there are only certain &quot;save spots&quot; in the game, and the child <br/>
will lose all his hard work if he stops now!?!&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I remember once I put so much work into writing a play when I was about 11 years old. It took me weeks to write out the lines for the characters, assign roles to about 8 different friends (including myself). I had music cued up for certain parts. I also made cool props, all by myself with free time I had after school and on weekends. It was really exciting. We rehearsed a few times too. <br/>
<br/>
I just remember it being one of the most ecxiting, important things that I had ever done by myself as a child. IIt was a Christmas play and I had plans to perform it at a local nursing home. I loved every minute of the process and I put so much time and energy into the whole thing <br/>
<br/>
Well, I did something &quot;wrong&quot; one day, (I don&#39;t remember what now), and my parents punished me by not allowing me to perform the play I wrote/created. I had to call everyone in the play and the nursing home to cancel. It was so unfair and mean and my body still gets hot thinking about it. I cried and cried. How could they not have seen or cared about how much I put into it all? I guess they thought it would be a punishment that would &quot;stick&quot; because it was something that meant so much to me. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why the above story from Katherine made me remember this time from my childhood, but something about it did. I guess because my parents never valued the importance or significance of things that brought joy and meaning to my life, just like the father in Katherine&#39;s story. <br/>
