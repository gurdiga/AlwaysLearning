<div id="ygrps-yiv-26242396">I wanted some opinions here and i will post on veryyoungkidsteeth.<br/>
I called a *childrens* dentist office today and inquired about how<br/>
they do things with children for the first visit.<br/>
I asked her what it would be like for my son(6yo. in Oct.) she said<br/>
they give out a pre-school package and go over proper<br/>
snacks,brushing,flossing with the mom(I&#39;m thinking...oh geez!)<br/>
she said said they take the child to the back,parents are not allowed<br/>
and they clean,take x-rays,and an exam.<br/>
I asked her why can&#39;t parents be with the child and she said It&#39;s<br/>
their policy,that kids do better without the parents.<br/>
Does this sound red flaggish or am i paranoid???<br/>
I then said I thought it wouldn&#39;t be all that done for the first<br/>
time,i thought it was more of an orientation type visit,she said,they<br/>
try to get it done.<br/>
I asked..well,what if my child doesn&#39;t want x-rays? and she<br/>
said...they talk them thru it.<br/>
I didn&#39;t dare ask if they ask the child if they can...i knew they<br/>
aren&#39;t respectful<br/>
My problem is i want your thoughts because it&#39;s very hard..so far..to<br/>
find a kids dentist that takes our insurance(tri-care)<br/>
she said when they turn 6yo. they can have appt.s in the afternoon but<br/>
until that age ,it&#39;s made in the morning....what&#39;s up with that? Is<br/>
this a normal dentist way of doing things?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077891961">Hi,<br/>
  I&#39;m a dental hygienist and used to work in a pediatric dental office.<br/>
  Yes, a lot of times dentists prefer to see the child alone, they do usually do better without the parents.<br/>
  I totally understand where you are coming from.<br/>
  Why not ask them if you can come in the room, and then if your son doesn&#39;t cooperate they can tell him that you need to leave the room if he doesn&#39;t cooperate.  That usually works for most kids.  Some just need their parent in the room.<br/>
  Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825078584">We&#39;ve been to two different dentists, one when my older two were  <br/>
little and then a new one (the first had retired to go be a stay-at- <br/>
home mom - she&#39;d had 3 kids during the years we were her patients)  <br/>
when my youngest was little.  For a first visit, I went for a regular  <br/>
appointment, myself, and, at the end, my kids sat in the chair, on my  <br/>
lap. The dentist just looked inside their mouth, didn&#39;t even touch  <br/>
them. He said super nice things like, &quot;Wow, great teeth.&quot; That was  <br/>
about it. Maybe 3 minutes, total. We goofed with the chair a little  <br/>
and turned the big light off and on.<br/>
<br/>
A week or two later, we went back and the dentist said hi to the  <br/>
child and told her that the hygienist was going to brush her teeth  <br/>
with special brushes. He showed the child how it worked. The  <br/>
hygienist did it very very very gently - first with a regular  <br/>
toothbrush and then polished with the electric polishing tool. No  <br/>
scraping. Then she showed the child some x-rays of teeth and said  <br/>
that next time they&#39;d take that kind of special pictures. So we made  <br/>
yet another appointment for a week or so later and then went in for x- <br/>
rays only.<br/>
<br/>
I never liked pediatric dentists (I&#39;ve taken my nieces and nephews to  <br/>
them, on occasion)  because there was an atmosphere of &quot;herding&quot; lots  <br/>
of little, recalcitrant children. Also, the assumption that they&#39;ve  <br/>
got to be bribed/rewarded for a dentist visit (choose a little gift  <br/>
at the end, get stickers, etc.) makes a negative statement. We go to  <br/>
one-person offices where we are all treated as individuals, children  <br/>
and adults. My kids don&#39;t get all the gimmicks that pediatric  <br/>
dentists use (bubble gum flavored rinse or whatever), but they are  <br/>
treated respectfully, just like any adult would be.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well it was a red flag for me because it is very easy for medical <br/>
professionals to believe that they are in charge, and expect the parents to <br/>
back up their authoritarian plays.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago Jayn had an emergency dental situation, and I posted <br/>
the whole long story as well as wrote an article for Live Free, Learn Free <br/>
magazine. The story should be in the archives of Unschooling Discussion if <br/>
that helps. Would you like me to send you the article off list?<br/>
<br/>
The best advice I have as a result of that situation is that it is worth <br/>
taking the time to find a good, full service and child-repectful dentist. <br/>
They do exist. By full service I mean that they do any surgery there, where <br/>
a rapport and relationship has hopefully been established. Believe me, if <br/>
you think some dentists are disrespectful wait until you have to find a <br/>
dental surgeon who is willing to take things at the child&#39;s pace. It is also <br/>
worth the peace of mind to have an anesthetist for any surgery, rather than <br/>
just the dentist.<br/>
<br/>
I eventually found someone who was kind, gentle, respectful and slow (ie at <br/>
Jayn&#39;s pace), and didn&#39;t make threats to force compliance. She always <br/>
explains to Jayn what she is going to do, and asks if she is ready.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I then said I thought it wouldn&#39;t be all that done for the first<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time,i thought it was more of an orientation type visit,she said,they<br/>
&gt; try to get it done. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have to be careful because they have different meanings for the same <br/>
words, as I found out the hard way. When you say, or Jayn says, &quot;just saying <br/>
hello&quot; or &quot;just meeting&quot; we mean literally meeting the dentist and staff, <br/>
looking over the office maybe, asking questions about procedures. They mean <br/>
the child sits in the chair and opens her mouth, gets a cleaning probably <br/>
and x-rays, but no *major* work is done.<br/>
<br/>
What city are you in? I have a fabulous, non-judgemental dentist now. Jayn <br/>
is always delighted to go there, makes drawings for her, and calls when she <br/>
loses a tooth.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; she said when they turn 6yo. they can have appt.s in the afternoon but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; until that age ,it&#39;s made in the morning....what&#39;s up with that? Is<br/>
&gt; this a normal dentist way of doing things? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jayn&#39;s dentist schedules around us, with the caveat that she does have one <br/>
day every month (or maybe every two weeks) set aside for surgery when she <br/>
sees no other patients. It is normal in that they assume that a 6yo is in <br/>
school so they fill the mornings with pre-school age kids.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that is sometimes helpful is to pick up some plastic dentist tools <br/>
and play act the procedures - he &quot;does&quot; you, his teddy and Daddy, then you <br/>
&quot;do&quot; him to the extent he will let you. This is something that I heard about <br/>
on veryyoungkidsteeth, although it was not something that we needed to do as <br/>
it turned out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339360596">I don&#39;t see how it would be a good idea to use fear in order to get <br/>
cooperation.  To me, that&#39;s the same as a parent threatening to <br/>
leave a child in order to get them to come along!<br/>
<br/>
If the child is scared/doesn&#39;t want to be there/feels <br/>
uncomfortable/is unable to hold the x-ray thing in his mouth, then <br/>
he should be able to tell the dentist or his parent and know that he <br/>
will be taken seriously.  <br/>
<br/>
When it comes to the dentist, if something doesn&#39;t work for my <br/>
child, then it doesn&#39;t really matter what works for most children.<br/>
<br/>
The worst experiences we have had with dentists have been with <br/>
pediatric dentists.  We&#39;ve had much better communication with <br/>
general dentists.  They have been more willing to listen and less <br/>
rigid in their &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33271718">I should have also mentioned that if you get a strange or not good feeling about the office- forget about going there. I&#39;m sure you probably know that already.<br/>
  Like I said previously- I&#39;m a hygienist and I&#39;ve seen all different types of philosophies and attitudes.  Many are just plain out for the $, but there are good ones out there. Unfortunately this happens in this field, just  like others.<br/>
  Since you live in Florida I can&#39;t help you with that, but ask around the people that you know and seem to have good judgement.  Most dentists  also agree that you need to go through word of mouth and never just pick one from the phone book.  You can get lucky, but please ask other people and do go to just meet them.  If they don&#39;t allow that -you  probably DO NOT want to take your son there:(  I also agree with the person who said you don&#39;t need a pediatric office.  It&#39;s probably smart to go to a good general dentist that will do most procedures, so that he doesn&#39;t have to be referred elsewhere for any extractions, etc.<br/>
  I used to be the most fearful patient- I&#39;m great now. My daughter was just like me at 6-7 years old.  I took her to a pediatric dentist who didn&#39;t allow me in the room for the fillings.  She did not respond well to that.  I found another dentist and she became so cooperative and has no fear of going to the dentist now.  It&#39;s awful how many adults still are phobic when going to the dentist even for a cleaning.   The personality of the hygienist and dentist are soooo important.<br/>
  I don&#39;t know if you live near a Dr. Ira Ginsberg.  If you do he would probably be able to refer you to a great dentist.  I grew up with him and he is very honest and I&#39;m sure his referral would be good.<br/>
  Hope this has been of help to you!<br/>
  Good luck in searching for a dentist!<br/>

          Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m a dental hygienist and used to work in a pediatric dental office.<br/>
Yes, a lot of times dentists prefer to see the child alone, they do usually do better without the parents.<br/>
I totally understand where you are coming from.<br/>
Why not ask them if you can come in the room, and then if your son doesn&#39;t cooperate they can tell him that you need to leave the room if he doesn&#39;t cooperate. That usually works for most kids. Some just need their parent in the room.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

they do things with children for the first visit.<br/>
I asked her what it would be like for my son(6yo. in Oct.) she said<br/>
they give out a pre-school package and go over proper<br/>
snacks,brushing,flossing with the mom(I&#39;m thinking...oh geez!)<br/>
she said said they take the child to the back,parents are not allowed<br/>

So, if the goal is to get the kids through the visit with as little  <br/>
work as possible for the dentist/staff, then sending mine in alone  <br/>
and telling them to just do what they were told, would have worked. I  <br/>
think there are MANY kids like mine who will behave well (better)  <br/>
without the parent there. But, that doesn&#39;t mean it is the best thing  <br/>
for the child. If the child is acting &quot;fine,&quot; but starts to cry or  <br/>
act scared when the parent shows up, then those feelings were already  <br/>
there, just well hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Even when my kids were older, I&#39;d wander in and out of the room -  <br/>
just stand in the doorway sometimes. I was very casual and acted like  <br/>
it was the most normal thing in the world for mom to sort of wander  <br/>
in and see how things are going. A few times someone asked me, &quot;Can I  <br/>
help you?&quot; with a sense that I was not where I was supposed to be,  <br/>
but I just said, calmly &lt;g&gt;, &quot;Oh, no, I&#39;m fine.&quot; (No explanations - I  <br/>
am the mother, I don&#39;t have to explain why I&#39;m wanting to be near my  <br/>

<br/>
Like school.<br/>
<br/>
Schools say &quot;no problem&quot; because most of the kids just go with it,  <br/>
but if you ask adults, years later, how they felt, you hear a  <br/>
different story.  And some kids (most?) get through it by telling  <br/>
themselves it&#39;s better to be independent, and their moms don&#39;t like  <br/>
them all that much anyway, to leave them in scary situations, and  <br/>
after a few years of those internal justifications, they no longer  <br/>
trust nor really want to be with their moms as much as they might&#39;ve  <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a slippery slope.<br/>

stayed with Chamille (13) to help her help out at a daycamp.  I had <br/>
actually stayed for a few minutes because I thought Margaux (5) <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do well without me.  Turns out she didn&#39;t really care wether I <br/>
stayed or not, but it&#39;s a good thing I did, because Chamille just about <br/>
threw up because she was so nervous about helping, something I didn&#39;t <br/>
expect at all!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure she would&#39;ve done just fine without me, but the fact is she <br/>
would&#39;ve kept it all to herself, but really it wouldn&#39;t have changed <br/>
the fact that she needed me there.  Today, she was fine with me leaving <br/>
her there.  I asked her and she told me with honesty, not just to put <br/>
on a brave face for her mom.  A lot of parents don&#39;t get that, they <br/>
just don&#39;t do that for their kids, they expect them to behave a certain <br/>
way and push them into that, especially when they are &quot;old enough&quot;.  <br/>
Both of my kids KNOW without a doubt that I would never ever push them <br/>
into a situation that they are uncomfortable with, so they can tell me <br/>
honestly when they are un/comfortable.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085018100">I would never leave my child in a dentist&#39;s chair, or anywhere, without them<br/>
telling me that that is what they wanted. I don&#39;t care what the<br/>
&quot;professionals&quot; say...they don&#39;t know what MY child needs...they know what<br/>
THEY want...a compliant (scared?) child to do what they are told. And<br/>
schools are like that too.<br/>
<br/>
We had a pediatric dentist who had a chair for the parent in the room. He<br/>
was very respectful, and if the child became upset, he had some strategies<br/>
for helping, but if they didn&#39;t work, he would say that this doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
be the time for this dental work. I was always so impressed with that, but<br/>
heard other parents complain about him.<br/>
<br/>
He was very sensitive himself, and I know that he was just right there with<br/>
the child. I heard him refer parents to other dentists who he knew would do<br/>
the work regardless of the child&#39;s feelings, if the parents pushed, but he<br/>
didn&#39;t like doing that.<br/>
<br/>
He also referred out for sedated work, which he didn&#39;t do, for children who<br/>
needed immediate dental work but weren&#39;t relaxed enough yet with the dentist<br/>
to do it.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has had excruciating medical procedures that had to be done for<br/>
him to live. There was no choice. He has had three open-heart surgeries so<br/>
far...each one more physically and emotionally damaging than the last. On<br/>
top of that, he is VERY sensitive, as in, has a heightened sense of light,<br/>
sound, taste, touch, etc...he has lived with great anxiety most of his life,<br/>
was not been able to navigate the world outside our home too easily...didn&#39;t<br/>
understand people and their cues and reactions, etc. So it was crucial for<br/>
us to find doctors and staff who would let him be as in control as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Because of these medical issues, he has hardly ever been to the dentist. It<br/>
was always on a back burner. It was just too much for him to deal with (lots<br/>
of anxiety of anything being done to his body, as well as needles). When we<br/>
did go, he could only open his mouth about 1/2 and inch. He thought he was<br/>
opening it very wide like requested. He is now 18 and is asking to go to the<br/>
dentist.<br/>
<br/>
I called a local pediatric dentist that was recommended, even though he is<br/>
18, because I was told they have a real special and relaxed way with kids.<br/>
That office recommended a dentist that works with &quot;special needs&quot; adults as<br/>
well as general dentistry. I&#39;m not sure what I think about that, but my<br/>
experience has been that &quot;special needs&quot; professionals (less the school<br/>
system who tries to box people and mold them) tend to be more understanding,<br/>
respectful, patient, etc., so we&#39;re going to check them out tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people have recommended not going to pediatric dentists, but we<br/>
have had such fabulous experiences with Children&#39;s Hospitals (3 different<br/>
ones in 3 different parts of the country) and sometimes Children&#39;s Hospitals<br/>
have dentists offices associated with them, ones where the kids are in<br/>
charge and are very respected. It may be worth checking out if there is a<br/>
Children&#39;s Hospital near you, and if they have a dental clinic.<br/>

&gt;&gt;day each time...maybe because he nursed until he was four?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, our guy nursed until he was 3 1/2, and outside his physical problems,<br/>
was pretty healthy.<br/>
<br/>
One related story about listening to our children in the presence of<br/>
&quot;authority&quot; or &quot;professionals&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Andrew was 5 months old the first time he had open-heart surgery for a<br/>
complicated congenital heart defect.<br/>
<br/>
After the surgery, he was in the ICU, tubes coming out of most orifices.<br/>
They took out the breathing tube after a while, and the nurse said that when<br/>
he woke up, they&#39;d start to feed him a bottle.<br/>
<br/>
I said that he had never had a bottle in his life, and I didn&#39;t intend to<br/>
start him on one now. The nurse rolled her eyes and said, &quot;He needs to learn<br/>
sometime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
?????<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Aaaa, no he doesn&#39;t.&quot; She went on to say that his intake needed to<br/>
be measured exactly, and that couldn&#39;t be done with breastfeeding. I said<br/>
that I knew how much milk was in each breast, as I had been pumping for<br/>
days, and that we would have a close estimate. She said that wasn&#39;t an<br/>
option. I told her that knowing the exact amount of how much goes in and how<br/>
much comes out wasn&#39;t necessary, we&#39;d know if his kidneys weren&#39;t working<br/>
with close estimates. She said she would only bottle feed him. I told her<br/>
that she was not to touch my son for feeding, and if she needed me to talk<br/>
to her superior, I would be glad to. I never left his bedside.<br/>
<br/>
She clocked out soon after. I said nothing but pleasantries to the new<br/>
nurse, and when Andrew woke up, I picked him up and offered him the breast.<br/>
He hadn&#39;t had anything in his stomach for a day and a half. He nursed away<br/>
and I know that this helped with his emotional and physical healing at that<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I told the new nurse that Andrew had just breastfed, and that he emptied one<br/>
breast, which I knew from pumping, equaled about 4 ounces. She looked quite<br/>
pleased and marked it in his record. We continued this way for the rest of<br/>
his recovery.<br/>
<br/>
It can take bravery to really protect our children, and to do what is best<br/>
for them, especially if we are in a realm that we are not familiar with.<br/>
There may be times when we don&#39;t have all the answers, or know the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
thing to do (like in the case of medical care), but we can read up and learn<br/>
and stay as informed as we can to help navigate the way for our children.<br/>
There are SO many &quot;rules&quot; in places (schools, hospitals, dentist offices)<br/>
that are put there for purposes that have nothing to do with what&#39;s best for<br/>
our kids. It&#39;s really helpful to try to figure these things out as best as<br/>
we can beforehand, and to question anything that doesn&#39;t seem best for our<br/>
kids.<br/>

&gt; the fact that she needed me there. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Jayn first began dancing at 3.5 she was too scared to dance without me <br/>
there. The teacher normally doesn&#39;t allow spectators - to keep a <br/>
non-judgmental atmosphere - but encourages parents to tip toe and peek every <br/>
now and then. However she let that go for Jayn&#39;s comfort.<br/>
<br/>
She and crying Jayn appeared at her front door, to find me lurking very <br/>
nervously outside - I had a feeling Jayn wouldn&#39;t last. Then I sat on the <br/>
floor of the dance class for the first year. Jayn would run over several <br/>
times during the class to get a kissy. Over the course of the seven months <br/>
of classes I moved from the floor of the class to the stairwell. I would <br/>
bring a book with me.<br/>
<br/>
The second year, again relaxing her usual rule, I waited downstairs in the <br/>
teacher&#39;s living room during the class (a huge improvement in my comfort).<br/>
<br/>
Now having just completed her fourth year of dancing, Jayn is completely <br/>
comfortable, and I can even go off on errands during the class.<br/>
<br/>
When one of the dental surgeons we visited threatened Jayn that she would <br/>
send dh and I out if Jayn didn&#39;t open her mouth and sit quietly, James and I <br/>
were horrified. The ds clearly assumed that we would back up that play, but <br/>
Jayn was terrified, and we all left instead. Lucky for us she is not one to <br/>
suppress her own feelings!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922457402">I don&#39;t know where you live but here in CT that is NOT the way children are seen. I worked for a pediatric /adult dentist for almost 4 years and the parents were and still are always allowed back. As a matter of fact they were even allowed in the operating room when the kids had severe teeth problems and needed to be anesthetized. They would stay till their kid fell asleep. This dentist and his office is totally out of line. they work for you not the other way around. if it wasn&#39;t for you they would be out of business. on another note please don&#39;t wait any longer to bring your son to the dentist or if you have any other kids. It is super important that they see the dentist for the first time no later than 2 years of age. It will only be a quick tooth count and simple cleaning but it is sooooo important that their baby teeth are healthy before their permanent teeth come in. my kids starting seeing the DMD when they turned 1year. My oldest son has a bite misalignment but i<br/>
 would not have known how serious it was had i not brought him in. he has to see an orthodontist and he&#39;s only 7. Good luck with your endeavor and remember YOU are your child&#39;s only advocate and the Dr. is NOT always right. Your son has no one else to stand up for him except you. i would hate for him to be scared of the DMD for the rest of his life because one DMD is a schmo.<br/>

          I wanted some opinions here and i will post on veryyoungkidsteeth.<br/>
I called a *childrens* dentist office today and inquired about how<br/>
they do things with children for the first visit.<br/>
I asked her what it would be like for my son(6yo. in Oct.) she said<br/>
they give out a pre-school package and go over proper<br/>
snacks,brushing,flossing with the mom(I&#39;m thinking...oh geez!)<br/>
she said said they take the child to the back,parents are not allowed<br/>
and they clean,take x-rays,and an exam.<br/>
I asked her why can&#39;t parents be with the child and she said It&#39;s<br/>
their policy,that kids do better without the parents.<br/>
Does this sound red flaggish or am i paranoid???<br/>
I then said I thought it wouldn&#39;t be all that done for the first<br/>
time,i thought it was more of an orientation type visit,she said,they<br/>
try to get it done.<br/>
I asked..well,what if my child doesn&#39;t want x-rays? and she<br/>
said...they talk them thru it.<br/>
I didn&#39;t dare ask if they ask the child if they can...i knew they<br/>
aren&#39;t respectful<br/>
My problem is i want your thoughts because it&#39;s very hard..so far..to<br/>
find a kids dentist that takes our insurance(tri-care)<br/>
she said when they turn 6yo. they can have appt.s in the afternoon but<br/>
until that age ,it&#39;s made in the morning....what&#39;s up with that? Is<br/>
this a normal dentist way of doing things?<br/>
thanks,Heather<br/>
p.s. I would particularly like to know if there are any other<br/>
questions i should ask and how you handled the visits.My son barely<br/>
lets me look in his mouth.<br/>

was 6 or 7.  She had a couple of cavities that they filled and a <br/>
couple they left to wait until they fell out and were replaced with <br/>
good healthy adult teeth.  That encompassed 2 visits to the dentist, <br/>
one to check and clean, and another to fill the cavities.<br/>
<br/>
Fastforward to now, she just went to the dentist about a month ago, <br/>
this would be her third trip to the dentist.  No cavities, clean <br/>
teeth, probably genetic.  She has a couple of teeth that need to come <br/>
out because her adult teeth are trying to come in under them.  She <br/>
said &quot;no way&quot;, even though they highly recommended it and I later <br/>
explained why they recommended it.  She still says &quot;no way&quot;.  I put <br/>
up a sticky note in the bathroom to remind her to wiggle her teeth, <br/>
so they can come out soon, before they force her adult teeth to come <br/>
in, in places they shouldn&#39;t and hopefully avoid braces.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille is 13 and has had a total of 4 cavities, 2 of them were <br/>
filled, with a total number of 3 trips to the dentist.  I really <br/>
don&#39;t see how taking her at the age of 1 or 2 would have done <br/>
anything but cost me money I didn&#39;t have!  She hardly had any teeth <br/>
at that age anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My 5 yr old has cavities, you can see them.  It&#39;s from extended <br/>
nursing.  Sometimes they hurt and sometimes they don&#39;t.  She doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to go to the dentist.  If they start hurting so much that it <br/>
interferes with living happily and eating what she wants, we will go <br/>
to the dentist.  She absolutely never would&#39;ve tolerated a dentist at <br/>
the age of 2!</div>

I worked in a pedi/adult dental office for about 4 years and i saw some horrible stuff in peoples mouths, especially kids. the standards for A LOT of things have changed even since my 7 year old was a baby. it is very important to keep updated on all health care related issuse that may affect your children.  As far as what is wrong with my sons teeth? if i let it go he would have a mouth like a pug dog, bottom teeth jutting out under his top teeth. this of course could lead to jaw problems making it hard to chew and possibly eroding the jaw bone itself over the long road.most orthodontic work is not purely for &quot;crooked teeth&quot;. a lot of the time it is for a bite problem. i had a similar problem and nothing was done until i made the descision to get braces in my 20&#39;s. now my jaw bone is flat on one side and chewing anything for too long really hurts i.e gum, caramel etc.  As far as what<br/>
 did people do before.....they were probably in pain just like MANY of the people back when a lot of medical/dental help was in its infancy. many people just walked around with no teeth because they fell out and if you were lucky enough to get them fixed and had the money what did you get...wood, animal bone, cadaver teeth. the internet is a great place to find out what happens to people when they don&#39;t take care of their teeth. just look at the pics. they are really gross and it is more common thatn you think.<br/>

Says who?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It will only be a quick tooth count and simple cleaning but&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been to many different dentist offices, and no one of them seem to be<br/>
on the same schedule. I think this is pretty individual, though I know that<br/>
in general most of them are following the latest doctrine of the American<br/>
Dental Association, which has changed its recommendations many times over<br/>
the years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;it is sooooo important that their baby teeth are healthy before their<br/>
 </span></blockquote>permanent teeth come in.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The exact opposite of what the standard recommendation was when my kids were<br/>
that age. I was told that their baby teeth would fall out and that their<br/>
baby teeth would not influence their second teeth at all. There was not as<br/>
much emphasis on dental care for babies at that time, and I don&#39;t see any<br/>
negative result from that with these kids who are now teenagers and adults.<br/>
<br/>
These recommendations are a good example of blanket &quot;rules&quot; in medicine that<br/>
don&#39;t individualize for our kids and our situations. Examples of the need to<br/>
research and find real and true information. I trust that many intelligent<br/>
parents would be able to take good measures for their kids&#39; teeth without a<br/>
lot of dentist intervention.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My oldest son has a bite misalignment but i<br/>
&gt;&gt;would not have known how serious it was had i not brought him in. he has<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to see an orthodontist and he&#39;s only 7.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
How serious is it? What would supposedly happen if you didn&#39;t know and<br/>
didn&#39;t do anything?<br/>
<br/>
The world of orthodontics is a curious one to me. What did people do before<br/>
it existed? Did their mouths cave in? I have a hard time believing that<br/>
there is as much *need* (as in health would deteriorate without it) for<br/>
orthodontic work as there are braces on kids. It seems like in many cases<br/>
orthodontic work is more a choice (or should be) than helping a serious<br/>
health issue. And at the same time, I&#39;m sure there is SOME useful need for<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest (13) has very crooked teeth. I&#39;ve asked him if he was interested<br/>
in braces. So far he&#39;s said no. Many of his friends have been to the<br/>
orthodontist and have been made to wear braces. Some of them didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
even have crooked teeth. And most of them don&#39;t follow the recommendations<br/>
for keeping the braces clean and in good shape.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057232524">good for you. that is exactly what i would have done!!!! I sat in on every class when my son wanted to take tap class. he didn&#39;t want me to leave so i sat quietly on the floor in the back of the room. i think its important to reassure your kids that you will be there for them when<br/>
  they need you no matter what the issue is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Jayn first began dancing at 3.5 she was too scared to dance without me <br/>
there. The teacher normally doesn&#39;t allow spectators - to keep a <br/>
non-judgmental atmosphere - but encourages parents to tip toe and peek every <br/>
now and then. However she let that go for Jayn&#39;s comfort.<br/>
<br/>
She and crying Jayn appeared at her front door, to find me lurking very <br/>
nervously outside - I had a feeling Jayn wouldn&#39;t last. Then I sat on the <br/>
floor of the dance class for the first year. Jayn would run over several <br/>
times during the class to get a kissy. Over the course of the seven months <br/>
of classes I moved from the floor of the class to the stairwell. I would <br/>
bring a book with me.<br/>
<br/>
The second year, again relaxing her usual rule, I waited downstairs in the <br/>
teacher&#39;s living room during the class (a huge improvement in my comfort).<br/>
<br/>
Now having just completed her fourth year of dancing, Jayn is completely <br/>
comfortable, and I can even go off on errands during the class.<br/>
<br/>
When one of the dental surgeons we visited threatened Jayn that she would <br/>
send dh and I out if Jayn didn&#39;t open her mouth and sit quietly, James and I <br/>
were horrified. The ds clearly assumed that we would back up that play, but <br/>
Jayn was terrified, and we all left instead. Lucky for us she is not one to <br/>
suppress her own feelings!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019146642">I think many people were like me: I was unable to eat an orange before<br/>
orthodontics.  When I bit down, only two of my teeth touched, and they<br/>
weren&#39;t two that were supposed to.<br/>
Because of the way I was chewing (to get the teeth to connect--and<br/>
still, I remember sitting at the table for HOURS after everyone else<br/>
had finished, chewing and chewing and chewing on something simple like<br/>
a chicken leg), because of that, I had huge problems with TMJ, and<br/>
chronic headaches.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with orthodontics of that time period is that the work<br/>
that was done dramatically reduced the lengh of the roots of the<br/>
teeth, so many of us are at risk for other problems.  I had an<br/>
extremely progressive orthodontist, who didn&#39;t do extractions (which<br/>
has always puzzled me, until the hygenist pointed out the other day<br/>
that it&#39;s now considered generally unethical), and who capitalized on<br/>
my 14yo vanity by showing before-and-after shots of what teeth that<br/>
aren&#39;t cared for look like.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, I am able to eat chicken and oranges, have a nice smile,<br/>
and very few cavities (all pre-orthodontics).<br/>
I think if orthodontia didn&#39;t exist, I&#39;d likely be a vegan, and still<br/>
have tremendous headaches.<br/>
<br/>
It is my opinion that establishing good dental habits very early in<br/>
life is an extraordinary gift to give your child(ren).  Even if they<br/>
choose to let it slide later, you can contribute to a joyful and<br/>
peaceful childhood by helping assure that dental visits are pain and<br/>
anxiety free.<br/>

I had braces.  Years later, I chose to be vegan.  I don&#39;t understand why you<br/>
mentioned the likelihood of being vegan if orthodontia didn&#39;t exist.  Are<br/>
you suggesting vegans don&#39;t eat a variety of foods that require chewing?<br/>
