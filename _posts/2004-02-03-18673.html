<br/>
I feared the wrath of the infidels and pharisees.<br/>
Once in a while, still (twice this week) someone writes and accuses me of <br/>
thinking I am (in Jr. High Girl Speak) &quot;ALL hot or something.&quot;   So I try not to <br/>
wear the sequined glow in the dark cape too much, y&#39;know.  It disturbs the <br/>
neighbors.<br/>

We can only get away with it here, on AlwaysLearning, as it&#39;s Sandra&#39;s e-list <br/>
for those who have already seen the light. She gets pissy anywhere else! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m sorry. Did you not see the  &quot;Experienced unschoolers, please ignore my <br/>
school-speak&quot; that I put in there somewhere? I used &quot;rules&quot; on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m only funny to me & Deb! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

I&#39;ll nominate you, Rue.<br/>

Rue is our voice of compassion calmly and succinctly helping all - in <br/>

I know she&#39;s not a hypocrite!!!!)<br/>

Sorry this is was sort of wimpy - I&#39;m a Lutheran - we don&#39;t show <br/>
