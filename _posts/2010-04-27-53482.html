Still they managed to turn it all screwy in the article.  (Maybe the  <br/>
report didn&#39;t say this, maybe that end comment was by one of their  <br/>
balancing experts...)<br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
Media literacy advocate Shari Graydon says the study confirms what  <br/>
conscientious critics have been saying for years.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents who actively engage with their children&#39;s cognitive  <br/>
development have a much stronger impact on developmental outcomes than  <br/>
the amount of screen time a child has,&#39;&#39; says Graydon, a director at  <br/>
Media Action in Ottawa. &quot;At the same time, the displacement factor  <br/>
remains an issue for anyone concerned about the broader development of  <br/>
a child.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
This sentiment is shared by Dr. Diane Sacks, a pediatrician for more  <br/>
than 30 years.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The study itself looks well-done, and it does (establish) that kids  <br/>
can watch television and still have good reading and math skills,&#39;&#39;  <br/>
says Sacks, past president of the Canadian Paediatric Society. &quot;But  <br/>
the real issue is what kids aren&#39;t doing when they&#39;re watching TV. Who  <br/>
cares if my kid is the best reader or mathematician on the block if  <br/>
he&#39;s lonely, asocial and obese?&#39;&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959119511">Hi Sandra and others,<br/>
<br/>
have you watched the google-Statistics about Homeschooling and Unschooling?<br/>
Unschooling really peaked up to the height of Homeschooling:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://google.com/trends?q=Unschooling,+Homeschooling">http://google.com/trends?q=Unschooling,+Homeschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
So beware. There will probably increased media attention on all the <br/>
blogs and lists and so on for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely<br/>
Richard<br/>
<br/>
PS: Hello, I&#39;m new on the list and only accidentally this week where a <br/>
lot of others came.<br/>
I&#39;m an Unschooler from Germany and the only thing restrictions on <br/>
Homeschooling does is, that it leads to emigration. We will leave <br/>
Germany in a few months. Yipppieeh! Freedom here we come!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291086057">Wow what an assumption: &quot;lonely, asocial and obese.&quot; First of all, I have a<br/>
problem with the word obese anyway. Many body types carry lots of weight<br/>
without being unhealthy in the least. As skinny as I was years ago, I<br/>
carried a lot of weight for my height, but didn&#39;t look it. I still do.<br/>
That&#39;s body type at work for sure.<br/>
<br/>
The hours I have spent online should have done me in by now to go by that<br/>
assessment. I remember as a kid, I spent most hours with my nose in a book.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t conversation but it was communication of ideas nonetheless. (I see<br/>
the same thing with Karl and tv, video games, and the internet.)<br/>
<br/>
Was reading books asocial? Maybe. I wasn&#39;t lonely when I was reading (to the<br/>
contrary; books were my favorite companions) and I was a skinny little<br/>
beanpole. And on top of that I watched a 4 or so hours of tv everyday as<br/>
well. And I went to school and sat at a desk all day. AND I hated PE. And I<br/>
avoided any hint of sports because I thought the social aspect of those<br/>
activities was abhorrent really, probably because it didn&#39;t fit who I was as<br/>
a kid. I liked lots of activities and still enjoy them today but I&#39;ve never<br/>
been a high energy type.<br/>
<br/>
The focus of this study is very clear. The ending comments about obesity<br/>
seem to be rather off-topic. :/<br/>

<br/>
All that was true of me except the energy.  I played a LOT at school,  <br/>
running around, acting things out, putting a cardboard box over my  <br/>
head (with my friend Martha) and pretending to be a radio, walking  <br/>
around and saying &quot;Turn on the radio!&quot; and then we would sing a song.   <br/>
At home we played on the swing set, dug deep holes, climbed trees,  <br/>
rode bikes, jumped rope with two people turning and all kinds of long,  <br/>
elaborate jumprope games, we played running games that involved  <br/>
running around spirals drawn on the ground to escape &quot;a witch,&quot; and  <br/>
hopscotch, but I also read as much as I could find to read, and that  <br/>
was &quot;sedentary.&quot;  I watched comedy re-runs or PBS every afternoon.  I  <br/>
watched TV most of Saturday (cartoons, then old movies--Tarzan, or  <br/>
Shirley Temple or Frankenstein/Mummy/Creature...)<br/>
<br/>
I went to church where I sat for two hours Sunday morning, two hours  <br/>
Sunday evening and an hour on Wednesday, with much less intellectual  <br/>
stimulation than watching TV.  I figured out what all the appendices  <br/>
in the back of the hymnal were by just reading them and following page  <br/>
numbers until I understood the &quot;metric index of tunes.&quot;  I spent time  <br/>
reading the whole chapter the sermon was from to see how out of  <br/>
context it was *this* time.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting isn&#39;t the crime.  Doing something the parents didn&#39;t design  <br/>
and approve is the crime with television.  It&#39;s the possibility of  <br/>
knowing more than the parents.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s really cool!  I never thought to look at google search statistics on that!  I love that my own city pops up first!  Way to go Pacific NW folks!  There really are a LOT of unschoolers around these parts... Perhaps when you move from Germany, you could come on this way... One of my neighbors is German even!<br/>
