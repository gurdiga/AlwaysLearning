<div id="ygrps-yiv-250303817">Hi,<br/>
  Some one wrote, &quot;Christianity teaches that humans have a soul that will go<br/>
to heaven.&quot;<br/>
 That is not exactly true for me a Christian. My views of Christianity are<br/>
closer to Buddhism and Hindu than to what many people think of as Christian.<br/>
I just happen to have studied Jesus teachings, and think he is one of the<br/>
greatest examples of man on earth, but I don&#39;t think he is God, nor do I<br/>
think he is the only worthy example.<br/>
Many people worship him, praise him and quote the bible.  Politicians,so-<br/>
called religious institutions of old and new have exploited him, but they<br/>
don&#39;t really follow what he taught- like worshiping a door, but not opening<br/>
it or walking through it.<br/>
I don&#39;t think my soul just goes to a golden, euphoric place, but that heaven<br/>
and hell are states of mind that are now.<br/>
It is  constant work for me to strive to be in,what I call, heaven - being<br/>
grateful, happy,appreciative, euphoric, etc. Every time a hellish thought or<br/>
situation enters my life, I try to counter it with a good or wait patiently<br/>
for a solution which always turns out to be better than what I originally<br/>
had planned.<br/>
Just like in art, when something goes on the paper that seems like a<br/>
horrible accident, but actually turns out to be a happy new direction, or in<br/>
math where it seems like there is no solution, but there always is. (I<br/>
really loved all of the math stuff earlier on this list.)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I am starting to ramble, but Christians are  lumped together, and<br/>
fundamentals seem to  have totally taken over the term Christian that I felt<br/>
like giving my perspective.<br/>

Wendy,<br/>
Thank you for the ramble and your perspective! I<br/>
really liked what you had to say. I know that<br/>
sometimes I&#39;m guilty of lumping all Christians<br/>
together and words like yours help me to remember not<br/>
to judge too quickly when I hear the &#39;C&#39; word &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
