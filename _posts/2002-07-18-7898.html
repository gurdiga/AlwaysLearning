<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877898952">I really like these.  If any of you have other saved versions or come across <br/>
one, I&#39;d like to see it.<br/>
<br/>
Another kind of humor I really like is up at sandradodd.com/map<br/>

 Teaching Math in 1970: A logger exchanges a set &quot;L&quot; of lumber for a set &quot;M&quot; <br/>
of money. The cardinality of set &quot;M&quot; is 100. Each element is worth one <br/>
dollar. Make 100 dots representing the elements of the set &quot;M.&quot;  The set &quot;C&quot;, <br/>
the cost of production, contains 20 fewer points than set &quot;M.&quot; Represent the <br/>
set &quot;C&quot; as a subset of set &quot;M&quot; and answer the following question: What is the <br/>
cardinality of the set &quot;P&quot; of profits?<br/>
