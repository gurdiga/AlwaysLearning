&lt;&lt; But I truly am *guessing* with little real data.  As the mom who&#39;s lived<br/>
every minute with your kids, *you&#39;re the one* that has the insight.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m a factor, so I can&#39;t see it.  And one family with three kids isn&#39;t a <br/>
scientific sample.  We&#39;re in that place where we can&#39;t have &quot;proof.&quot;  Even if <br/>
a mom had 120 kids and kept great records of conditions, the kids would each <br/>
be born to a mom of a different age, and into a different environment, with a <br/>
dad who had more money, or less sanity, or whatever all. &lt;g&gt;  And the birth <br/>
order factors!  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t believe<br/>
I can take all the credit for the fact that my son is outstandingly<br/>
reasonable at the age of 8.  For goodness sake, he&#39;s far more reasonable<br/>
than I am. How could it be my doing? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At least school isn&#39;t frustrating his reason.<br/>
