<div id="ygrps-yiv-447471062">I live in Costa Rica and the culture here is quite different then in the US in a lot of ways.  One way is in regards to theft.  It would  NEVER be even called theft for someone to grab some fruit out of your tree when passing by.  Many people steal to take care of themselves or others, it is not OK to me but here even judges will certainly let things slide by in the interest of feeding their children.  It is interesting because in some ways I like that people can get by just grabbing some fruit while on a walk, and because everyone here is OK with that they are more relaxed and there is certainly a better sense of community or a slight mentality of communal living.  On the other hand it seems a slippery slope and so children grow up and feel they have a need and see nothing wrong with stealing from others, so theft has become a big problem here.<br/>
Anyway, just giving another country&#39;s perspective.  I love living in another country:)<br/>

What about technical info that is &quot;stolen&quot; to keep a country ahead of another or spying where info and data,words,plans and more are stolen to keep our country and others safe?

Are you asking for a group consensus?<br/>
The answer is going to be different for each person and each  <br/>
situation.  Some people might say &quot;never.&quot;  Each person&#39;s answer will  <br/>
be different.<br/>

<br/>
In Rumplestiltskin, did the queen steal Rumpelstiltskin&#39;s name?  Did  <br/>
her father steal her position in court?<br/>
Was Jack a big thief for stealing from the giant?  Or was he  <br/>
liberating enslaved magical beings?  We don&#39;t get to know for sure.   <br/>

Choosing the word &quot;stolen&quot; is what makes the difference in that.  Was  <br/>
England stolen by the Angle, Saxons and Jutes?   Was Brazil stolen by  <br/>
Portugal?  Was New Mexico stolen by Spain?  Mexico?  The U.S.?   Was  <br/>
it stolen from someone else by the Pueblo Indians?  Even they don&#39;t  <br/>
know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622486400">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m asking because i might have a conversation with my kid in the <br/>
future when he knows these things and might ask why gathering info is okay <br/>
but not taking something from a store. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When you say &quot;gathering info&quot; I guess you are referring to the spying in the <br/>
prior post - the gathering of private information. I don&#39;t see that it is <br/>
always OK. I think that patent laws, privacy laws and copyright laws are in <br/>
place partly to make clear the point at which information gathering becomes <br/>
illegal such as industrial espionage.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of international spying, I think the mitigating factor is the <br/>
assumption of malevolent intent, or the possibility of malevolent intent, on <br/>
the part of the other country&#39;s government. I suppose therefore it falls <br/>
under the rubrick of &quot;self-defense&quot;. I don&#39;t think the assumption that the <br/>
local store or the hotel intends to harm its customers is at all reasonable. <br/>
It&#39;s all a bit muddy, and could at least make for some cool conversations.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it becomes even muddier when the issue is self preservation on a <br/>
personal scale. Many of the original European settlers in Australia, <br/>
convicts of the First and Second fleets, were transported because they were <br/>
convicted of poverty driven minor self preservation crimes like stealing <br/>
loaves of bread.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone ever said that being an unschooling parent conferred an <br/>
ability to know all the answers. Perhaps we inherently have a greater <br/>
interest in tangling with knotty questions.<br/>
