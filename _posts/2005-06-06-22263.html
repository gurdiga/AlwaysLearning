We&#39;ve had that same kind of thing happen at our house. We had a new family move into our neighborhood a little less than a year ago. It is a dad who has his two kids every other weekend. Well, the younger one is a girl, and she was in Kindergarten last year. When she was over here one day she told me something along the lines of, &quot;Well, I just don&#39;t see how your kids are getting any smarter.&quot; A Kindergartener said that! I mean, they start indoctrinating them early, don&#39;t they?? <br/>

  The kids are happy and have a couple <br/>
  new horsey friends.  (one of whom keeps asking how many work sheets they have to do every day and doesn&#39;t quite understand that they don&#39;t have to do any.) <br/>
