<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011419841"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;....maybe you were not fully loved and therefore <br/>
&gt;it just doesn&#39;t come easily. I nursed four kids for<br/>
&gt;nine years straight, much of the time tandem-nursing<br/>
&gt;while being pregnant, and I had to work on a<br/>
&gt;daily basis to let go of irritability and fill<br/>
&gt;myself with love. I was not taken care of that way<br/>
&gt;when I was little so it wasn&#39;t part of my<br/>
&gt;conditioning, and I was charting a new course for my<br/>
&gt;children. It is a brave and challenging thing to do!<br/>
&gt;And as you obviously know, as important work as<br/>
&gt;there is. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy this hits home.  It&#39;s not something I didn&#39;t<br/>
already know, but it&#39;s good to hear it from outside<br/>
sources once in a while.  The particular challenges of<br/>
overcoming my past, fulfilling the ideals of parenting<br/>
in which I believe, reaching my own personal goals and<br/>
dealing with my own personal flaws and shortcomings,<br/>
and raising a special needs child to boot sometimes<br/>
feel so mountainously overwhelming and I feel despair,<br/>
loneliness and frustration that seem unbearable.  Self<br/>
pity isn&#39;t something I want to wallow in though, and<br/>
certainly won&#39;t do myself or my children any favors,<br/>
so I keep plugging along, as do we all.  It&#39;s<br/>
definately been worth the effort so far.<br/>
