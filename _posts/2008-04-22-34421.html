<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302571983">My always unschooled girls, ages 11 and 13, are very capable readers.  They<br/>
almost never read fiction. They do read non-fiction books and magazines for<br/>
information when they want to know something in particular but that is<br/>
really it when it comes to printed material.   In the past I always read to<br/>
them a lot and I think they got their fill of stories from my reading to<br/>
them but lately we aren&#39;t even doing that.  However, their world is filled<br/>
with the written word and stories.  They play on-line games a lot and they<br/>
watch TV.  They also still use their vivid imaginations in their play.  My<br/>
younger dd goes through periods of story writing.  My oldest likes to make<br/>
lists.  I have always been a voracious reader but in the last few years I<br/>
haven&#39;t read many books either.  I am however, still reading all the time.<br/>
I read many of these lists.  I read during the on-line games I play.  I read<br/>
a lot of magazines.  I read cereal boxes and Ketchup bottles.  There is just<br/>
so much more information available on-line and on TV now that you can spend<br/>
the whole day reading, writing, listening, and thinking and never pick up a<br/>
book.  I really think it&#39;s just a sign of the times. <br/>

Yes, of course, kids can learn without reading.  Janene did, until she read at 8.  Others have.  I know some kids don&#39;t read  until 12 or older.  Robert Frost didn&#39;t read until 14.  But I think a literate level of reading is very important. <br/>

Choosing not to read, I get that...  But I think it&#39;s sad when someone is illiterate, and therefore it&#39;s not a choice.  <br/>

<br/>
I will sing to my children.  I will even sing to my students.  There are a few books that I read each year that have songs in them and I will sing the songs when I am reading the book out loud in shared reading.  But if an adult comes into the room, I freeze up.  I would not sing in public.  It is sad.  I&#39;m working on this issue of mine... <br/>

I totally agree with Joylyn here.  I think our children would be at a<br/>
serious disadvantage in both learning and in living if they did not learn to<br/>
read.  I&#39;ve known two adults who never learned to read.  Neither were<br/>
unschooled, but they weren&#39;t schooled either.  They kind of &quot;escaped&quot;<br/>
society and hid themselves away in a tiny little &quot;hippie&quot; town.  Both were<br/>
very depressed individuals with low self-esteem.  They sold drugs as a<br/>
living, because no one would hire them because they couldn&#39;t read.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine and I got in a pretty big argument about this topic. <br/>
She&#39;s a public school teacher (I was) and we were arguing about weather<br/>
or not children need to be taught to read.  Her final statement to me<br/>
was something to the effect of the literacy problem and I said it is<br/>
caused by &quot;teaching&quot; kids to read (imo)!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I usually follow these threads closely.  My 8 yo is not reading<br/>
independently and I know that is ok (fine, perfectly normal), but I<br/>
still occasionally worry.  I&#39;ve just learned to keep it to myself and<br/>
read all I can  when I&#39;m having one of those moments.  One difference I<br/>
can tell you about Graham is he doesn&#39;t hate reading and he believes<br/>
that he just can&#39;t yet. [:)] His world his surrounded by written words<br/>
and he doesn&#39;t fear them or hate them, he has no problem asking for help<br/>
when playing games, his ds, playstation or a magazine, etc.  I think<br/>
that people who end up illiterate somehow feel like there is something<br/>
wrong with them and even hide the fact that they can&#39;t.<br/>

But being illiterate at 12 is not the problem. It&#39;s being judged and<br/>
compared and being called &quot;illiterate&quot; that is the problem. Jared<br/>

I do believe that unschoolers will ever be illiterate.  But do any of you,<br/>
who have had children who don&#39;t read until 11, 12, 13 + feel that they could<br/>
have grasped the concept of reading had they read earlier?  The reason I ask<br/>
is that I&#39;ve read (as a teacher, so who knows how unbiiased my readings<br/>
were) that if a child learns to speak or learn music after the age of 12,<br/>
they will not learn it as well as a child who learns at an earlier age.<br/>
Something about brain development.  I wonder if this pertains to reading, as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t know if this &quot;brain development&quot; theory is just false, or if we<br/>
are talking about schooled vs. unschooled kids here.  Even if it is true,<br/>
you also have to factor in the fact that forcing a child to read can totally<br/>
turn him off to reading.  So is it really beneficial to &quot;push&quot; reading even<br/>
if this happens to be ture?  (I think I just answered my own question!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious to see what others here think about this &quot;brain development&quot;<br/>
theory?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is that I&#39;ve read (as a teacher, so who knows how unbiiased my readings<br/>
&gt; were) that if a child learns to speak or learn music after the age of 12,<br/>
&gt; they will not learn it as well as a child who learns at an earlier age.<br/>
&gt; Something about brain development.  I wonder if this pertains to reading, as<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t buy it at all.  I was 12 when I began to play the flute.  I loved it.  I played and <br/>
played--even in the car because I couldn&#39;t wait until I got home!  I improved rapidly, <br/>
began taking private lessons, auditioned for a local youth orchestra and got in, took <br/>
lessons with a better teacher, got into another youth symphony, made state honor band, <br/>
and was basically on a track to do it professionally.  Then other factors came into play and <br/>
I didn&#39;t end up pursuing it, but that had nothing to do with the inability of my brain to <br/>
&quot;learn it as well.&quot;  It was all about drive and desire.  I remember John Holt addressing this <br/>
very topic--I&#39;m sure someone else will remember which book/s are pertinent.<br/>
<br/>
With all the cutting edge research going on in the field of brain plasticity, I think that this <br/>
is a very outdated concept.  We&#39;ve all heard the &quot;window of opportunity&quot; theory, but think <br/>
about how much easier some concepts are to just grasp now, as an adult, than they were <br/>
when presented in school when we weren&#39;t ready for them or interested enough in them <br/>
to actively engage them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, I don&#39;t know if this &quot;brain development&quot; theory is just false, or if we<br/>
&gt; are talking about schooled vs. unschooled kids here.  Even if it is true,<br/>
&gt; you also have to factor in the fact that forcing a child to read can totally<br/>
&gt; turn him off to reading.  So is it really beneficial to &quot;push&quot; reading even<br/>
&gt; if this happens to be ture?  (I think I just answered my own question!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that letting go of the brain development theory, like many preconceptions that <br/>
aren&#39;t based on actual experience, can help parents to connect more fully in the present <br/>
with their children, and holding on to it can create fear and anxiety that inhibits that <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
My personal theory is that there may be windows where kids are putting together their <br/>
understanding of certain things like language, mathematical stuff/patterns, music, rhythm, <br/>
etc., but if they are in a rich, supportive environment they will have what they need, or can <br/>
get what they need to assimilate those things to the degree to which it makes sense to the <br/>
child.  I think that people like to muck about in natural processes as if we should, and we <br/>
have great potential to do harm and to dishonor that process if we try to &quot;take over&quot; and <br/>
use those windows as an excuse to force someone to learn according to an external <br/>
agenda.  Those processes are completely internal and can be messed up by an external <br/>
focus.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The realisation of the plasticity of the brain has shown that we don&#39;t<br/>
become *incapable* of learning new skills. My understanding is that<br/>
it&#39;s more to do with the way new information coming into the brain is<br/>
interpreted in terms of existing information.<br/>
<br/>
How that often works out with children is that an adult who doesn&#39;t<br/>
appreciate that &quot;careless talk costs lives&quot; (as those WW2 posters used<br/>
to say) will write them off as a failure for all time on the basis of<br/>
their failure to achieve something on a specific occasion. Tell a five<br/>
or six year old who isn&#39;t reading now that they &quot;can&#39;t read&quot; and they<br/>
might well still believe it ten years from now.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to play the violin when I was 21. Actually, I was a fiddle<br/>
player, not as challenging as becoming a violinist perhaps, but still<br/>
it was a skill I didn&#39;t know I had the ability to acquire until I made<br/>
the decision to acquire it.<br/>
<br/>
One time, I read an article by a professional bodybulider in which he<br/>
wrote that if you haven&#39;t built a muscular physique by the time you&#39;re<br/>
20, you&#39;ll never do it. Some years later, I read a story about a<br/>
former thin guy who took up bodybuilding when he was 50 and two years<br/>
later won the National title (I think that was in the UK).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Self-improvement&quot; techniques such as visualization, hypnosis, NLP,<br/>
Think Right Now, and so on, are primarily to do with changing patterns<br/>
of thought, and thus our beliefs, so that they become more helpful -<br/>
&quot;empowering&quot; I think is the popular word. The point is, though, that<br/>
the change requires an intention to change - beliefs usually don&#39;t<br/>
change themselves. Patterns of thought tend to become more rigid over<br/>
time as we tend to notice evidence that supports them and disregard<br/>
evidence that doesn&#39;t. So it may well be that people who believe we<br/>
can&#39;t learn new skills once we&#39;re out of our childhood are people<br/>
who&#39;ve never actually tried.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Haha, not just brains, but bodies!  Sports anyone?  I was a genuine <br/>
klutz as a kid and my only hope to get through gym was to befriend the <br/>
teacher. :)  I sat and regaled my high school gym teacher with stories <br/>
and held his clipboard and ran errands - ANYTHING to stay off that <br/>
field, court, track, whatever!  Any time I couldn&#39;t talk him out of <br/>
keeping me out of the game, it was like a mile long disconnect with <br/>
what my brain saw, told my body, and my body reacting!  The ball was <br/>
always long gone when I swung at it.<br/>
<br/>
When I later worked at a college and my boss wanted everyone on the <br/>
faculty volleyball and softball team, I dreaded it but figured I could <br/>
enjoy the sunshine, take up space and maybe block a ball or two.  But <br/>
despite his disappointment in my less than stellar performance, I <br/>
impressed myself when I realized that I had actually developed some <br/>
coordination!  I could actually see the ball and hit it. :)  Not that <br/>
it went where I wanted, but I had improved by doing nothing...  It was <br/>
just when my body was ready... <br/>
<br/>
If only there were a little league for twenty-somethings! :(  Well, <br/>
there wasn&#39;t, so I went on to non-competitve sports, like SCUBA and <br/>
Skiing.  I never became an expert, but I finally got enjoyment out of <br/>
something physical...  Something I had learned to accept that I <br/>
was &#39;bad&#39; at and had stopped trying until that fluke.  BTW, thanks <br/>
also in part to him, I later became a SCUBA instructor and certified <br/>
that boss to dive after starting a program at the college. :)<br/>
<br/>
I never got very good at eye-hand coordination at activities requiring <br/>
speed. :) My body still primarily serves as the vehicle to cart my <br/>
brain around, but I can get in a batting cage and hit some, which <br/>
would be a miracle to my 16 year old self. :)  Practice might improve <br/>
my performance, but I&#39;m satisfied with my abilities in that area.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old asked why I liked to read so much the other day and I  <br/>
explained, but almost everything I heard myself saying could have been <br/>
also said about movies, tv, games, roleplaying, etc.  Even my favorite <br/>
part, which is that books are at my time, my speed can be done with <br/>
DVR/Tivo these days.<br/>
<br/>
One things books still have over electronics is that they are easier <br/>
to replace when they fall in the bathtub and they don&#39;t need <br/>
batteries, so they work well on long airplane trips and on beaches, <br/>
but I see my son self entertain non-electronically by drawing - <br/>
something that has never interested me.<br/>
<br/>
I realized when I was answering him that escapism was always one of my <br/>
main reasons and I read far fewer books today than years ago both <br/>
because I don&#39;t have such a strong need to escape and because I can <br/>
read online and watch movies instead.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m almost done with my long post.  One last thought...<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have tried to avoid is comparisons, but right after he <br/>
asked me why I liked to read, he said he didn&#39;t think he was smart. :( <br/>
<br/>
After we talked about the difference of smart vs. knowing vs. ability <br/>
vs. practice and what exactly he is good at and why that might be, he <br/>
specifically brought up reading.  So I told him about older kids he <br/>
knows who didn&#39;t learn to read until they were 10 or 12.  One was an <br/>
unschooler and one is schooled.  He seemed surprised and then looked a <br/>
bit relieved.  I&#39;ve always tried to be positive, but he gets other <br/>
messages about comparisons to age based abilities from family, friends <br/>
and tv.<br/>
<br/>
I reminded him that he can read some things, so it&#39;s not that he <br/>
*can&#39;t* read, but that he&#39;s learning to read. I see him developing <br/>
need based and practice based (username/passwords frequently entered) <br/>
abilities and I trust that he will continue that path to meet his <br/>
needs in reading.  He&#39;s very proud of how fast he can type his <br/>
password on runescape (not an easy word, but I can&#39;t tell) and I told <br/>
him my story of typing - another slowly developed physical skill that <br/>
I&#39;m now excellent at, but only by time and practice, like many <br/>
things.  And that he&#39;s probably a better typer than many his age.<br/>
<br/>
This is also the boy who could hit a baseball at age two and asked us <br/>
to take off the training wheels on his bike when he was ready at age 4 <br/>
and did a perfect ride the very first time.  He didn&#39;t get that from <br/>
me. :)  (I&#39;ll spare you the story of my riding a bike into a tree at <br/>
age 12).<br/>
<br/>
Some people develop coordination at a young age.  Some don&#39;t.  Some <br/>
read at a young age.  Some don&#39;t. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690970456">We always read a lot of books in our house; and my son loved his evening<br/>
reading times with Dad. The concept of reading was quite clear to him, I<br/>
think, and he definitely recognised its value. However, he did not read<br/>
himself until he was 12. Another daughter, 11, is now working hard on her<br/>
reading skills; she was not that interested before.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I notice that kids, left to decide when to learn to read for themselves,<br/>
often leave it till later - there is so much that is more important to them<br/>
in their childhood. Reading is a bit abstract, a bit removed from real life.<br/>
They want to grasp hold of real life and experience it for themselves, and<br/>
only when they are full up and contented with this are they interested in<br/>
receiving it second-hand, through books. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
People say that a child is losing out if he cannot read. I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
Left to decide for himself, a child is busy all day long - living and<br/>
learning. And then there are those lovely quiet snugly times when you read a<br/>
book together - if he can&#39;t read it for himself yet, there is no reason at<br/>
all why he should lose out - you can give him the gift of your reading skill<br/>
to use.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we lived in South Africa, we had a housekeeper in her 30&#39;s who could<br/>
not read. She did want to learn, and while working for me, did an adult<br/>
reading course. However, although being able to read did add value to her<br/>
life, she had successfully functioned for all those years without the skill.<br/>
She was a nurturing mother of 8 children, a wonderful housekeeper, a super<br/>
person. She knew a lot about her environment, nature, folk remedies etc. She<br/>
could do her shopping, get from point A to point B, bake and cook... one is<br/>
inclined to see illiteracy as a great handicap. However, she made a huge<br/>
difference to my life in the days when my children were little and my<br/>
husband was working far too hard, out of the country more than he was in it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do feel that reading is important, and yes, I do want my kids to<br/>
learn to read. But I think we place far too much value on the skill as<br/>
compared with other skills...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thus say I, a confirmed book-aholic, who learned to read when I was 4!!!<br/>

I would argue that my son, who at 11 is not yet a reader, is seeing things that all of the rest of the readers in the household are missing out on. Often Simon will notice something that my word-centric perspective completely misses. When we lived in Japan, where I was completely illiterate, I found I looked for many different arenas for information. And Japan is amazingly well setup for the non-literate. In restaurants there are often models of the food that&#39;s on offer in the window so you can lead the waitress outside to point at what you want to eat (amid much giggling). The most difficult request I had to negotiate was for tampons. The poor woman was so embarrassed when I finally communicated to her my need. But that isn&#39;t the point. The point is that there is much that Simon sees that I don&#39;t see. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of snuggling, this morning Simon and I had a lovely time reading through his Yugioh cards. It is amazing to listen to him take in the information. I didn&#39;t notice alot of the details of what I was reading aloud. But he would comment on the cards and tell me which decks he thought they would be good with and how. It was wonderful.<br/>

since no pressure was put on them, the kids were allowed to follow exactly<br/>
what their brains needed. Some of their kids didn&#39;t read until they were<br/>
older (used to be that they said 12 was their oldest). But they read at &quot;age<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664326504">&lt;&lt;&lt;Simon and I had a lovely time reading<br/>
through his Yugioh cards. It is amazing to listen to him take in the<br/>
information. I didn&#39;t notice alot of the details of what I was reading<br/>
aloud.<br/>
But he would comment on the cards and tell me which decks he thought<br/>
they would<br/>
be good with and how.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting, my son does this same thing.  My daughter will sit and<br/>
listen to me read and just listen and listen and about all she says is<br/>
&quot;read another chapter!&quot;(she was an &quot;earlier reader&quot; btw).  But Graham<br/>
will ask soooo many questions!  Every couple sentences, yes, noticing<br/>
details that I really don&#39;t pay attention to, learning things, telling<br/>
me things!  Bringing up earlier ideas from pages and chapters past.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, if this is a pattern with later readers?  If maybe  they&#39;re so<br/>
busy taking in so much information that reading is just too mudane or<br/>
slow for them at this time???<br/>
<br/>
He even stuttered as a tot when he would get excited talking or have a<br/>
bunch of information to share.  He would get frustrated and I would<br/>
always say, don&#39;t worry your brain just moving faster than the words are<br/>
ready to come out.  Both grandmas were getting worried that there might<br/>
be something wrong, but I never did because I really knew he would work<br/>
it out in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s really good at contraptions, building things and video games<br/>
(problem solving type things), I&#39;m mean really good.  I look at this<br/>
contraption computer game<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/puzzle/returnoftheimc/index.html)">http://www.gamespot.com/pc/puzzle/returnoftheimc/index.html)</a> he plays<br/>
and am like &quot;DUHHHHHH&quot; but he solves these puzzles in seconds!  He sees<br/>
so much further ahead then my brain seems to work (and I consider myself<br/>
fairly smart...bwg!)!!<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts!<br/>

&gt;&gt;often leave it till later&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like that may have been the case for the poster&#39;s children, but I<br/>
have heard lots about kids picking up reading at young ages...my four were<br/>
each different, from ages 4 to 9. Just depends on the person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004574794">-=-It does not pertain to reading - and I doubt it really pertains to  <br/>
music either.-=-<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of what it pertains to (or pertained to once), with music.<br/>
<br/>
Before the days of Victrolas and before the days of mechanical music  <br/>
boxes, for a while the HUGE fad, which they thought was natural and  <br/>
inevitable, was to have ladies (not so often men) who played the  <br/>
pianoforte.  And women of a certain class needed to be good enough at  <br/>
it by marriage-age to get a good husband.  It was part of the not-yet- <br/>
faded tradition of dowry, practically.  The girls needed to know  <br/>
music and French or Italian and poetry and needlework.  They didn&#39;t  <br/>
need to know how to cook; they would have a cook.<br/>
<br/>
Years passed and there were wars and a big depression and people  <br/>
could buy recorded music and then there were radios, but that was all  <br/>
considered inferior.<br/>
<br/>
The ideal of breeding and culture included music, and it&#39;s not that  <br/>
one would lose cognitive function later, it&#39;s that there was a  <br/>
looming window of marriagability and the parents had a duty to get  <br/>
her all spiffed up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just too complicated and embarrassing for people to admit that  <br/>
such factors have anything on earth to do with the urge to have a  <br/>
child in Suzuki violin or playing recorder Waldorf-style right on  <br/>
schedule.   That justification of a window has more to do with  <br/>
organization and with consistency (and visual conformity) than with  <br/>
learning itself.   I noticed as I was writing this that we&#39;re talking  <br/>
Japan and Germany.  They both have reputations for being humorless  <br/>
with and controlling of children.  Perhaps it&#39;s an unfair stereotype;  <br/>
perhaps it&#39;s as real as any genetic realities can be.  If it&#39;s not at  <br/>
all genetic, perhaps there are traditions in those cultures that  <br/>
others find somewhat inflexible but they&#39;re accepted by those who  <br/>
grew up with it.<br/>
<br/>
The press to have young girls play piano is with us still, even in  <br/>
Japan now.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are some reasonable concerns with grown women  <br/>
(especially young wives) being in the company of male teachers  <br/>
(especially piano teachers who sit right next to them with all those  <br/>
vibrations coming from the large, hard-bodied instrument).   <br/>
Seriously.   Electronic pianos are much more safely unsexy.<br/>
<br/>
The prejudice about &quot;if you don&#39;t learn it when you&#39;re little you&#39;re   <br/>
not going to learn it at all&quot; is reinforced by compulsory attendance  <br/>
(to 18 in many places; John Holt must be fidgeting in his grave, as  <br/>
he thought 15 and 16 were too late to hold young men down like  <br/>
children).<br/>
<br/>
The realities are different now, as to opportunities for learning, I  <br/>
think.  Life is easier for us than for great grandmothers who had to  <br/>
haul water and heat it over a fire to do laundry for men and teen  <br/>
sons who were working in other people&#39;s fields all week.    That  <br/>
would be my own maternal grandmother, but I&#39;m older than most of  <br/>
you.  And some of you might never have had grandmothers who had to  <br/>
haul water to wash clothes.   I just have to get my clothes to the  <br/>
washing machine.  I don&#39;t even have to make my own soap.  I can play  <br/>
piano all through the rinse cycle and never even get my hands wet.<br/>
<br/>
So as usual, when considering questions like these, consider as much  <br/>
as you can historically and geographically and socially to try to see  <br/>
where the messages come from, and how the landscape is changing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219134983">Oh, wonderful! My mind went to the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and Noam Chomsky&#39;s stuff on the window of language acquisition and how so much of what people believe (including the neural pathway stuff) seems to be some extension of that. But I like the idea that it is about some parental desire to increase their children&#39;s value on the mating market. <br/>
