&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; In an unschooling household, there&#39;s no difference between this kind of<br/>
 reminder and the reminder of fiddle practice or finishing Kathryn&#39;s book. ;) <br/>

goals. Some of my goals include some not very comfortable momenst and I tend <br/>
to avoid the discomfort (training for a triathlon). I want dh to bug me and I <br/>
want him to be there working out with me too.....sometimes maybe that&#39;s what <br/>
our kids need, a friendly partner.<br/>
I hated practicing piano as a kid. I think I would have just sat and messed <br/>
with it more had my Mom been willing to sit with me....I really  just didn&#39;t <br/>
like doing it alone.<br/>
I know a LOT of people that will  work out with a partner but just can&#39;t seem <br/>
to self motivate, and yet being in shape is something they really want.<br/>
I would not have rolled my sorry A** out of bed at 6:30 this morning to go <br/>
swim in the gulf and then bike 18 miles. But when dh woke me up and said &quot;are <br/>
you coming?&quot; it was suddenly doable.<br/>
I think kids are no different. They have things they want that are difficult <br/>
to achieve. They may ask for a nudge, or they may just want a partner in the <br/>
venture. I think being an aware parent helps us know the signals they are <br/>
sending and gives us a chance to dialogue with them to help understand what <br/>
our role is in helping them achieve that goal.<br/>
