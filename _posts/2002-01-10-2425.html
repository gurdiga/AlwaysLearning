You can always order for BBC America on-line.  They have a British store.<br/>
We have one in Tucson called the Tudor Rose.  I paid $2.75 per Pork Pie the<br/>
other day, but it was delicious.  Also paid $1.75 for what looks like<br/>
Sainsbury&#39;s Sausage Rolls.  Again delicious so well worth it...  By the way<br/>
I&#39;m born and bred in England until age 21 and now for 21 years have lived in<br/>
the US.  I&#39;m a US and British Citizen so I get the best of both worlds.<br/>
