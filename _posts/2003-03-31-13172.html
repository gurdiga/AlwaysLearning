 </span></blockquote>When people ask me what Trevor (14) is &quot;doing&quot; these days, I reply - <br/>
&quot;growing&quot;.   He mainly eats and sleeps.  He has grown inches and doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to be slowing.  My oldest son is 6&#39;5&quot; tall, and Trevor seems to be headed in <br/>
that direction.  (By the way I&#39;m a short (for this list I guess) 5&#39;3&quot; tall - <br/>
I tell the kids I used to be 5&#39;4&quot;, but got shorter from carrying them in <br/>
packs on my front and back all those years :-)-when they tease me about being <br/>
the short person in the family!).<br/>
<br/>
All of the kids in the family seem to really need lots of sleep from about <br/>
ages 13-15.  They love to stay up really late, and I protect their sleep into <br/>
the morning.  I know my grandparents felt you were a &quot;better&quot; person if you <br/>
got up early, but they aren&#39;t around to watch our &quot;lazy&quot; ways!!  It is all <br/>
too soon after that that the kids get involved in work and classes and then <br/>
they need to be on a schedule.  I think that is a healthy freedom - to beable <br/>
to sleep as your body needs it.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, here I&#39;ll confess about the day I was being oh, so quiet because Trevor <br/>
was sleeping in.  Finally it was getting really late, so I peeked in, and he <br/>
wasn&#39;t there!!!  He had gone to his Dad&#39;s house without me being aware of it <br/>
(he does leave notes, but sometimes I miss them!!).  All that wasted care!! <br/>

Kirby&#39;s 16 now and not sleeping as much.  I hadn&#39;t considered that he might <br/>
be past the greater need!  I hope he still grows a bit.  He has a mixed bag <br/>
of genetic potential as to height.  He&#39;s 5&#39;10&quot; and seems to have stopped.  <br/>
His dad&#39;s 6&#39;1&quot; but the tallest in his family.  But he has a taller uncle and <br/>
I have a couple of tall uncles.  So we have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s the first day for nearly two weeks that Kirby can sleep late.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be at work until 3:00.  It will be interesting to see, <br/>
though, whether he will wake up naturally earlier (or whether he forgot to <br/>
turn off his driver&#39;s-ed alarm, now that that&#39;s over) and whether the lure of <br/>
Zelda will get him out of bed before noon anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is 14 and really growing fast.   His sleep time is generally 2:00 a.m. <br/>
to 11:30.<br/>
<br/>
Holly just lately started sleeping a lot.  She&#39;s 11 and a third &lt;g&gt;, hasn&#39;t <br/>
started her period but is starting to have other symptoms of the big changes. <br/>
 Facial imperfections (which she HATES, and she&#39;s getting a dry rash around <br/>
her nose that&#39;s really bugging her--any ideas are welcome!) and moods.  <br/>

Kass and Kree are 11 and 1/2 and we are noticing a tiredness they are not <br/>
used to. The mood swings are tremendous and DH is scared to take them riding <br/>
in the dessert for fear they will start their periods the moment they get <br/>
there and I won&#39;t be around. This weekend we bought a package of pads for <br/>
when &quot;it&quot; happens. Kass said &quot;Don&#39;t forget to buy those things mom,&quot; her twin <br/>
Kree who only buys boys clothes almost had a heart attack and exclaimed <br/>
&quot;Sissy, we don&#39;t need those yet!!!&quot;. She wanted to hide them at the check out <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand where that part comes from. I have always told them that <br/>
that day will be a celebratory one and the meaning of transition to <br/>
womanhood. I&#39;ve also warned them about severe mood swings (which we are going <br/>
through now) and although your hormones may feel out of whack, being hateful <br/>
or hurtful to others will only make you feel worse.<br/>
<br/>
The woman in me will be proud that day, but the mommy in me wishes they could <br/>
stay little.<br/>

I&#39;ve said it will be fun for about an hour and then never fun again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that it&#39;s a sign of health and just one of those things.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s had pads for a year.  There they sit.  Better than not.  One friend <br/>
of mine didn&#39;t start until she was fifteen, and she was worried.  Looking <br/>
back, I think she was really lucky!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she&#39;s really shy about buying the plastic pads, you could consider <br/>
making (or buying) some flannel pads for her.  She&#39;d have to have a space <br/>
to store them during her bloom and then wash them (in the washing machine) <br/>
when she was done for the month. It&#39;s really very easy.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I always hated it when the stickum bit on the plastic got stuck to <br/>
my leg or other sensitive bits.  Ouch! ...and I find the flannel comfy, so <br/>
long as I change them in the middle of the day.  On the other hand, my dd <br/>
likes to wear thongs, so they don&#39;t work for her!<br/>
<br/>

Their nighttime pads are awesome.<br/>
If you want to sew some, contact me offlist and I&#39;ll share how.  It&#39;s <br/>
really, really easy (and you&#39;ll never have to buy them again!)<br/>

the pads. Poor kid. Thanx for the links, the girls love to sew, so we could <br/>
make it a project and maybe slip some conversation about the whole thing too. <br/>
I haven&#39;t cycled in 11 years so they never see me have to deal with it. I <br/>
truly appreciate your insight.<br/>
<br/>

besides patience? &lt;g&gt;), but my acne got worse with washing, and I got dry<br/>
rash, too.  Best thing I do for my face (then and now!) is wash with warm<br/>
water.  Period.  But I don&#39;t wear makeup; if she&#39;s into the makeup bit, she<br/>
might need something that takes it off.<br/>
