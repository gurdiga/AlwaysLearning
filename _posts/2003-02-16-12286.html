<br/>
Hi all!  Here&#39;s a quick little story.  Was wondering what you all might<br/>
make of it.  I know how it hit me!  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I were at Border&#39;s books last night (my daughter was<br/>
spending a b&#39;day gift certificate.)  While she and my other daughter<br/>
shopped, my son (age 6) and I sat down to look at a dinosaur book he<br/>
found - was for adults, but had great pictures with captions!  (we did<br/>
end up buying it).  As he and I sat with the crowd of other parents and<br/>
kids looking at books, I overheard a mom say to her child regarding<br/>
selecting books &quot;It&#39;s what I want or it&#39;s nothing.&quot;  I gathered the<br/>
child didn&#39;t have any say in what they were going to buy.  The little<br/>
girl was crying over it.<br/>
<br/>
It just kind of struck me as sad and counterproductive.  Wouldn&#39;t the<br/>
child be more likely to learn from and want to read a book she selected?<br/>
I just don&#39;t get it.  If I made my son read what I wanted to read, I<br/>
doubt he&#39;d sit still very long.  I personally have NO interest in<br/>
dinosaurs... Lol... But he loves them, and I have to admit I learned a<br/>
lot from that book.  We haven&#39;t finished it yet.  And heck, if he&#39;s<br/>
willing and interested in sitting still for a book that&#39;s written for<br/>
adults... I only had to explain a couple of the bigger words... Then why<br/>
not?  Heck his vocabulary is certainly going to be good.  And it was<br/>
hitting on aspects of &quot;being a dinosaur&quot; that I&#39;ve never seen in the<br/>
kids books.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just needed to share.  I&#39;d also be interested in hearing from<br/>
you guys what your feelings on the scenario might have been.  Maybe I&#39;m<br/>
missing something?  Maybe my own viewpoint is too narrow?  Maybe she was<br/>
right in some way?  I don&#39;t know.  :)  Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Alyce, in what way could that mom have been right?<br/>
<br/>
My mom, though flawed in many ways &lt;g&gt;, raised us to be readers and book<br/>
lovers: if I could make a case for a book I wanted, she&#39;d buy it.  Toys<br/>
would often be met with &quot;use your allowance&quot; or &quot;wait until Christmas,&quot; but<br/>
books were always purchased.  (I don&#39;t remember ever being unable to<br/>
convince her ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve followed the same policy when possible; when not possible, I do what<br/>
mom did back when we were broke: we go to the library a LOT.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
restricted their choices to the children&#39;s section, either.<br/>
<br/>
As for dinosaurs, well...  They (and Calvin and Hobbes) got my son reading<br/>
at 4.  He loved Eyewitness books, and he and his sister went through a<br/>
couple of years where they collected the Eyewitness Pocket books; Santa<br/>
found they fit well in the stockings.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a more literary book about dinos, try Robert Bakker&#39;s &quot;Raptor<br/>
Red,&quot; in which a female Utah raptor&#39;s life is told from her point of view.<br/>
It was the one good dino book left out of Home Education Magazine&#39;s article<br/>
about them; I tried to get Alex to write a letter to the editor, but he<br/>
forgot ;-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Once she knew she had the <br/>
option, or maybe even the power to say I&#39;ve had enough, things turned <br/>
around. SHE turned them around. She stayed in school because it was <br/>
something she knew she didn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to do. She&#39;s there because she wants to <br/>
be.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is really important.<br/>
<br/>
In most (maybe all) of the school-at-home families I&#39;ve met or read about, <br/>
the parents made that decision without the children&#39;s input.  They parents <br/>
sometimes then make a decision to put the children back on school, without <br/>
regard for what the children want.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between &quot;schooling&quot; and unschooling has way more to do with <br/>
the relationship between the parents and the children than it has to do with <br/>
workbooks or location or hours.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that someone with a great relationship with her kids whose <br/>
kids are in a Catholic boarding school is an unschooler.  What I mean to say <br/>
is that if parents are controlling and children aren&#39;t free to say &quot;no&quot; (even <br/>
to the point of saying &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to homeschool anymore, I want to go <br/>
back to school), then the children aren&#39;t learning in freedom.  And until the <br/>
child has some independent rights, the miraculous kinds of things that <br/>
families report here can&#39;t start to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Children who are in school by their own choice are having a different school <br/>
experience than  their own choice are having a different homeschooling <br/>
experience than those whose parents won&#39;t let them go to school even if they <br/>
want to.<br/>

==========================<br/>
<br/>
I cried a lot as a kid.<br/>
One of my primary goals is not to make my kids cry! <br/>
<br/>
Poor little girl.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It just kind of struck me as sad and counterproductive. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And destructive of love and trust.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe I&#39;m missing something?  Maybe my own viewpoint is too narrow?  Maybe <br/>
she was<br/>
right in some way?  I don&#39;t know.  :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NO, I think you&#39;re exactly right.<br/>
<br/>
The norm in this culture is for parents NOT to respect children, not listen <br/>
to them, and to move them quickly along the path to adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right or good.<br/>
Your reaction is just what mine would have been, but I would probably have <br/>
given the mom a business card of mine and tell her she should just buy her <br/>
kid the book she wants and they AND we other customers would all be much <br/>
happier.<br/>

and I don&#39;t pick for them.  Sometimes they say they are looking for a certain <br/>
subject and I help them search.  And they read the books they choose.  And <br/>
they are not limited to the &quot;children&#39;s&quot; section.  They go where the books <br/>
they are interested in are located.<br/>
<br/>
But there are people out there that are like that &quot;It&#39;s my way or no way&quot;.  I <br/>
saw a young boy looking at Arthur books in a B&N.  The Mom came up and took <br/>
the books away and said in a very sickeningly sweet voice.  &quot;Now honey you <br/>
know we don&#39;t buy Arthur books&quot;.  And she gave him something else to look at. <br/>
 He looked like &quot;when did we decide that&quot; but didn&#39;t say anything.  Just went <br/>
along as instructed.  Like the &quot;good little boy&quot; YUCK!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362462882">Good Morning,<br/>
Brianna & I are pow wow traders.  Just about every weekend we are at our<br/>
&quot;port-a-store&quot;. We see all kinds of people.<br/>
When we first started, Brianna was going on 4 years old. We used to set up,<br/>
occasionally, at a &#39;high-end/tourist &#39; flea market near the shore here in<br/>
SouthEastern New England.<br/>
This one day, a family walked up the row to our tent. This family was very<br/>
well dressed. Mom had a Rolex. The dad went to the vendor across the way.<br/>
The mom & son were at our table. We had a glass bowl of arrowheads. The son<br/>
went through the bowl while mom looked at blankets, t-shirts, etc.<br/>
The son wanted an arrowhead, this one arrowhead that caused his eyes to<br/>
light up!  They were priced at $1.00 each. He asked his mom if he could get<br/>
one. &quot;Why?&quot; she asked,   &quot;I really want one, Mom.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; she asked again.<br/>
Well this boy gave her a reason, &quot;I really like it.&quot; This went on and on. He<br/>
got so tense, so desperate. This poor kid was probably 9 or 10. He went<br/>
through the wringer with his mom.<br/>
&quot;Please, mom, I really want this, please?&quot;<br/>
Finally, after begging and pleading for a bit, the son said, &quot;Mom, please, I<br/>
earned the money. It&#39;s my money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mom told him to ask his father.<br/>
Dad was called.<br/>
The son went through a list of reasons<br/>
I like it.<br/>
It&#39;s a keepsake.<br/>
It&#39;s my money.<br/>
<br/>
His father said, &quot;No, it&#39;s junk and you don&#39;t need it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was awful.<br/>
The family walked away.<br/>
Brianna looked at me and asked if she could give the boy the arrowhead. I<br/>
said yes.<br/>
She grabbed the arrowhead and ran up to the family, she cut in front of the<br/>
dad and said to the boy, &quot;You forgot your arrowhead&quot; The boy just looked at<br/>
her, the dad said &quot;That&#39;s not his, he didn&#39;t pay for it.&quot; Brianna never<br/>
looked at the dad. She just stood there, holding the arrowhead out for the<br/>
boy to take. The dad got more severe w/ Brianna.<br/>
&quot;He didn&#39;t pay for it. And it&#39;s junk!&quot;<br/>
Brianna said to the boy, &quot;You paid for this, this is yours. My cousins on<br/>
the reservation make these. You keep it.&quot;<br/>
Then she looked at the dad and said &quot;Your mean.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s the worst I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many people bring kids to a pow wow and yell at them to<br/>
stay clean.<br/>
Or totally disrespect the kids wishes, opinions, tastes, and choices.<br/>
It&#39;s horrible!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454558064">Alyce:  I&#39;ve been in stores and seen the same thing and now know that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t benefit the child.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that as I&#39;ve been through a deschooling process it seems that<br/>
making kids read or do anything I want them to do (unless it&#39;s for<br/>
safety reasons) is a waste of my energy.  I have to ask myself &quot;how do I<br/>
benefit from making my children do something I want them to do as<br/>
opposed to them doing what they want?&quot;  I find it takes a lot more<br/>
effort and energy out of me to try and make my kids do what I want.<br/>
That is very exhausting and what would I get out of it, except I&#39;d be<br/>
annoyed, frustrated and p**sed off at them.  That doesn&#39;t make for a<br/>
harmonious living arrangement.  I&#39;m learning the more I let go of what<br/>
they are up too, not only is my life calmer but so is theirs.<br/>

spending a b&#39;day gift certificate.)  While she and my other daughter<br/>
shopped, my son (age 6) and I sat down to look at a dinosaur book he<br/>
found - was for adults, but had great pictures with captions!  (we did<br/>
end up buying it).  As he and I sat with the crowd of other parents and<br/>
kids looking at books, I overheard a mom say to her child regarding<br/>
selecting books &quot;It&#39;s what I want or it&#39;s nothing.&quot;  I gathered the<br/>
child didn&#39;t have any say in what they were going to buy.  The little<br/>
girl was crying over it.</div>

I can&#39;t believe he not only insulted his son, but he insulted you too. He was <br/>
not only mean spirited, but incredibly rude.<br/>
Wow.<br/>
That whole story made me feel sick to my stomache. I think of all the <br/>
children having to live that way from day to day and it breaks my heart.<br/>

Subject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] What do you make of this<br/>
 <br/>
Good Morning,<br/>
Brianna & I are pow wow traders.  Just about every weekend we are at our<br/>
&quot;port-a-store&quot;. We see all kinds of people.<br/>
When we first started, Brianna was going on 4 years old. We used to set<br/>
up,<br/>
occasionally, at a &#39;high-end/tourist &#39; flea market near the shore here<br/>
in<br/>
SouthEastern New England.<br/>
This one day, a family walked up the row to our tent. This family was<br/>
very<br/>
well dressed. Mom had a Rolex. The dad went to the vendor across the<br/>
way.<br/>
The mom & son were at our table. We had a glass bowl of arrowheads. The<br/>
son<br/>
went through the bowl while mom looked at blankets, t-shirts, etc.<br/>
The son wanted an arrowhead, this one arrowhead that caused his eyes to<br/>
light up!  They were priced at $1.00 each. He asked his mom if he could<br/>
get<br/>
one. &quot;Why?&quot; she asked,   &quot;I really want one, Mom.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; she asked<br/>
again.<br/>
Well this boy gave her a reason, &quot;I really like it.&quot; This went on and<br/>
on. He<br/>
got so tense, so desperate. This poor kid was probably 9 or 10. He went<br/>
through the wringer with his mom.<br/>
&quot;Please, mom, I really want this, please?&quot;<br/>
Finally, after begging and pleading for a bit, the son said, &quot;Mom,<br/>
please, I<br/>
earned the money. It&#39;s my money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mom told him to ask his father.<br/>
Dad was called.<br/>
The son went through a list of reasons<br/>
I like it.<br/>
It&#39;s a keepsake.<br/>
It&#39;s my money.<br/>
<br/>
His father said, &quot;No, it&#39;s junk and you don&#39;t need it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was awful.<br/>
The family walked away.<br/>
Brianna looked at me and asked if she could give the boy the arrowhead.<br/>
I<br/>
said yes.<br/>
She grabbed the arrowhead and ran up to the family, she cut in front of<br/>
the<br/>
dad and said to the boy, &quot;You forgot your arrowhead&quot; The boy just looked<br/>
at<br/>
her, the dad said &quot;That&#39;s not his, he didn&#39;t pay for it.&quot; Brianna never<br/>
looked at the dad. She just stood there, holding the arrowhead out for<br/>
the<br/>
boy to take. The dad got more severe w/ Brianna.<br/>
&quot;He didn&#39;t pay for it. And it&#39;s junk!&quot;<br/>
Brianna said to the boy, &quot;You paid for this, this is yours. My cousins<br/>
on<br/>
the reservation make these. You keep it.&quot;<br/>
Then she looked at the dad and said &quot;Your mean.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s the worst I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many people bring kids to a pow wow and yell at<br/>
them to<br/>
stay clean.<br/>
Or totally disrespect the kids wishes, opinions, tastes, and choices.<br/>
It&#39;s horrible!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear that a lot when I&#39;m in the library.  A parent will tell the child<br/>
that they already have enough books, or they must take 2 and only 2, or<br/>
something like that.  For Pete&#39;s sake, the things are *free*!  What&#39;s<br/>
the<br/>
big deal.  If the parent has problems with the books getting back on<br/>
time,<br/>
then deal with *that* problem.  I go online to the library catalog and<br/>
just<br/>
get carried away ordering this, and that, and oh that one looks<br/>
interesting.<br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t the kids do the same?<br/>
