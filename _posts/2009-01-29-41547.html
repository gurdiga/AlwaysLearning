<div id="ygrps-yiv-866386967">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m glad that this is working for you, but my first thought was to wonder<br/>
whether your husband and kids missed that tv watching togetherness.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just posted some of those very moments where Dave & Tails are &#39;connecting&#39; <br/>
by simply being side-by-side.  They often times remind me of toddlers who <br/>
are &#39;playing together&#39; even though they don&#39;t look like they are connecting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Every Sunday night they watch a movie together.<br/>

During the week I often find them sitting side-by-side reading together but <br/>
separately.<br/>
