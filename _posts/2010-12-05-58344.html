<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298993042"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess for me the question becomes if we stop lying to our kids about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Santa and all...do we destroy magic and as adults do WE really see (not<br/>
believe) or know that magic exists and what is magic?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
You can destroy magic in the mind of someone. It&#39;s possible. You can<br/>
eradicate every instance you find.<br/>
<br/>
How many philosophers have tried and failed to distinguish the<br/>
difference between or determine the order of seeing and believing or<br/>
believing and knowing? I don&#39;t think an unschooling list can decide<br/>
that for anyone.<br/>
<br/>
To me, there is magic in everything even, maybe especially, the<br/>
lowliest things. I see magic in smiles and laughter (what *is* it<br/>
about smiles and laughter?), horns and wrinkles<br/>
(http://www.amazon.com/Horns-Wrinkles-Joseph-Helgerson/dp/0618616799),<br/>
tastes and smells, the spices I can put in food, fire, light, music,<br/>
sound, sight.<br/>
<br/>
Make your own list of favorite magic.<br/>
<br/>
I recently drew something on Tuxpaint (http://tuxpaint.org), using a<br/>
feature that is actually named Magic. Karl took one look at the<br/>
picture (http://wp.me/pYi8H-3Z) and said &quot;everybody has a reflection<br/>
of themselves.&quot; For me, that was quite a moment to hear him to say<br/>
something about what he sees in all humanity. That&#39;s magic to me.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be superstitious or religious a bit to see or<br/>
appreciate or believe in magic. For some the word &quot;belief&quot; or<br/>
&quot;believe&quot; doesn&#39;t enter into questions about magic. Magic can be<br/>
equated with miracle or might not be. Belief, strictly speaking, can<br/>
be just doing without absolute proof one way or the other. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to be so exact. One doesn&#39;t have to accept something as real to<br/>
enjoy it even though it might be preferable in some ways to have a<br/>
fuller picture of truth. Even then the meaning is up for grabs. When a<br/>
person looks at an object, the eye sends signals to the brain and then<br/>
the viewer is the one who pulls together their own experiences to<br/>
decide what the signals could be about.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes. Learning itself is magic. I can guess how it works and try to<br/>
encourage and assist it but I can&#39;t guarantee it or cast the spell<br/>
that makes it happen. It&#39;s mysterious enough that we need a list like<br/>
this just for figuring out as much as we can about it.<br/>
