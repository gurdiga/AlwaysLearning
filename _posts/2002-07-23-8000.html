<div id="ygrps-yiv-185489061">This was forwarded to me by a friend. I checked the truth of it on urban <br/>
legends so it&#39;s a good warning.<br/>
<br/>
Cia <br/>
<br/>
to a mere selection of all my generally curious, science-y, nukro-using<br/>
<br/>
friends...  be safe and lotsa love afbb<br/>

PLEASE READ ~ IT&#39;S FROM A FRIEND! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was very glad to get this email from a friend, because I have been <br/>
<br/>
guilty of heating water in a microwave many times. You&#39;ll be glad you <br/>
<br/>
read it. <br/>
<br/>
About five days ago, my 26-year-old son decided to have a <br/>
cup of instant <br/>
coffee. He took a cup of water and put it in the microwave to <br/>
heat it up <br/>
(something that he had done numerous times before). I am not sure <br/>
how <br/>
long <br/>
he set the timer for but he told me he wanted to bring the <br/>
water to a <br/>
boil. <br/>
When the timer shut the oven off, he removed the cup <br/>
from the oven. As he <br/>
looked into the cup he noted that the water was not <br/>
boiling. Then <br/>
instantly the water in the cup &quot;blew up&quot; into his face. The <br/>
cup remained <br/>
intact until he threw it out of his hand but all the water had <br/>
flown out <br/>
into his face due to the buildup of energy. <br/>
His whole face is <br/>
blistered and he has 1st and 2nd degree burns to his <br/>
face, which may leave <br/>
scarring. He may also have lost partial sight in <br/>
his left eye. While at the <br/>
hospital, the doctor who was attending to him <br/>
stated that this is a fairly <br/>
common occurrence and water (alone) should <br/>
never be heated in a microwave <br/>
oven. <br/>
If water is heated in this manner, something such as a wooden stir <br/>
stick <br/>
or a tea bag should be placed in the cup to diffuse the energy. <br/>
<br/>
Here is what our science teacher has to say on the matter: &quot;Thanks for <br/>
<br/>
the microwave warning. I have seen this happen before. It is caused by a <br/>
<br/>
phenomenon known as super heating. It can occur any time water is heated <br/>
<br/>
and will particularly occur if the vessel that the water is heated in is <br/>
<br/>
new. <br/>
What happens is that the water heats faster than the vapor bubbles <br/>
can <br/>
form. If the cup is very new then it is unlikely to have small surface <br/>
<br/>
scratches inside it that provide a place for the bubbles to form. As the <br/>
<br/>
bubbles <br/>
cannot form and release some of the heat that has built up, the <br/>
liquid <br/>
does not boil, and the liquid continues to heat up well past its <br/>
boiling <br/>
point. <br/>
What then usually happens is that the liquid is bumped or <br/>
jarred, which <br/>
is just enough of a shock to cause the bubbles to rapidly form <br/>
and expel <br/>
the hot liquid. The rapid formation of bubbles is also why a <br/>
carbonated <br/>
beverage spews when opened after having been shaken. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please pass this on to everyone you know, it could save a lot of pain <br/>
and <br/>
suffering. <br/>
