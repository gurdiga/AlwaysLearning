<br/>
You asked for recipes.   That can go on and on for thousands of posts,  <br/>
and on lots of cooking  sites, it does! &lt;g&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Oh yes, I&#39;ve been on a couple of recipe email lists...very  overwhelming!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of recipes, suggestions for good books with quick  recipes?  <br/>
 <br/>
My favorites:<br/>
 <br/>
More With Less Cookbook - it&#39;s a Mennonite cookbook and the recipes a  great, <br/>
easy, and usually only call for stuff most of us already have around the  <br/>
house.  Our most used cookbook.<br/>
 <br/>
La Leche League&#39;s &quot;Whole Foods for the Whole Family.&quot;  Probably a  little <br/>
more on the healthy side, but again, whole foods, not a bunch of fancy  <br/>
stuff,...pantry type cooking.<br/>
 <br/>
Fix it and Forget it - a good crockpot recipe book, simple stuff to throw  in <br/>
the pot and have a nice meal with a few hours later.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;One thing I&#39;ve done since having kids is to lose the  expectation to have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dinner on the table at a certain time or even with us  all eating together.<br/>
When I first read those studies about families that  eat together I didn&#39;t<br/>
think it through and I thought it was important to  eat together and I<br/>
stressed myself out with those expectations.  But  what is really important<br/>
is to spend time with your family each day,  listening to them and hanging<br/>
out with them.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it  is at dinner time or not.  When I<br/>
let go of that expectation our lives  became much more peaceful.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
When I was a kid we always ate around the table, but I remember it being a  <br/>
quiet time, everyone busy eating, not gabbing about the days <br/>
events..LOL...maybe  we were strange.<br/>
 <br/>
The only time we all sit down together for a meal is Thanksgiving and  <br/>
Christmas.  Otherwise we&#39;re all over the house.  We do our talking in  the car, <br/>
before and after a good movie,...off and on all day really!  I  usually feed the <br/>
kids first, then Chuck and I will get our own.  We&#39;re both  on diets so we <br/>
don&#39;t eat the same thing the kids eat anyhow.<br/>

<br/>
(This is worded kind of funny, but I can&#39;t think of another way to say it<br/>
more clearly.) How do they base the reports that say how children do better<br/>
in school and are higher achievers, more emotionally stable, etc. when they<br/>
eat together as family?  <br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with eating together in my opinion but it may have a<br/>
lot to do with time spent together talking with your family and feeling<br/>
listened to and part of a team.  But many mainstream families are so<br/>
crunched for time that dinnertime is the only time they can manage to<br/>
actually connect with each other.  <br/>
<br/>
As an Unschooling family with plenty of time on our hands, having time to<br/>
really connect with each other isn&#39;t an issue.  We do it on and off all day<br/>
long.  We plan our lives to have plenty of down time because that is what<br/>
works best for our family.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about having a connection with your family, not about when you eat or<br/>
if you eat together.  <br/>
