<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404770511">-=-I&#39;ve seen people in discussions &quot;well&quot; and &quot;yeah, but&quot;<br/>
themselves into a corner with ever changing stories and wildly  <br/>
escalating<br/>
details until they&#39;ve left a trail in writing even they can&#39;t follow<br/>
anymore. I&#39;m not saying that happened here.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It has happened here, and probably will again, which is one reason  <br/>
I&#39;m so watchful of the door, as it were.<br/>
<br/>
What makes these discussions work is the true stories.  We can&#39;t  <br/>
guarantee that people who pop in here and tell stories will be  <br/>
telling the truth.<br/>
<br/>
A dozen years ago there was some discussion of that and while it&#39;s  <br/>
two layers deep in philosophical what-ifs, those of us in the  <br/>
discussion (several of whom are still around, still unschooling,  <br/>
still helping other people) kinda concluded that even if a poster  <br/>
were a mom-posing ) 85-year -old man who had no children, if the  <br/>
advice was good and useful, that would be more helpful than that of a  <br/>
mom who had children but no clear grasp on reality or honesty.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years I have met lots and lots of moms and sometimes whole  <br/>
families that I once knew only from words on a screen, as you see  <br/>
these.  Lots of other families  have met me, my kids, my husband, and  <br/>
seen my house, and a few have seen me sleep-deprived or tipsy and  <br/>
goofy.   I have no place to hide.<br/>
<br/>
There are some who come to a discussion like this, or  <br/>
unschooling.info, or back in the old days to unschooling.com or aol&#39;s  <br/>
homeschooling forum, and within a day or two people are saying  <br/>
&quot;Wait... you said this...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Several of them, twenty or more over the years, have risen up banshee  <br/>
like screeching &quot;You know NOTHING ABOUT ME!&quot; (or something in that  <br/>
area of emotion).<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well... at that point we know there&#39;s less-than-optimal mental  <br/>
stability and calm.  But we knew that before, which is why people  <br/>
were saying, &quot;Hey, slow down.  Hold on.  Read before you post.  Think  <br/>
before you write.  Breathe before you screech.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people have an easy time in online discussions because they post  <br/>
simple truths and plain ideas and helpful suggestions, and they don&#39;t  <br/>
get angry if other ideas trump theirs or others dissect their  <br/>
suggestions in bright unschooling light.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have an easy time because they&#39;re willing to pour out  <br/>
their days for others&#39; encouragement, edification or amusement.<br/>
<br/>
Some have an easy time because they just don&#39;t post at all! &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m  <br/>
surprised every single time, even if it&#39;s the same person telling me  <br/>
again, when someone refers to one of these discussions in person when  <br/>
she didn&#39;t post anything at all.    Me being me, I can&#39;t not post.  <br/>
I&#39;m like Roger Rabbit responding to the knocked rhythm of &quot;shave and  <br/>
a haircut...&quot;   But some can, and so their lives are peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
Some have a hard time because they come with anger, with cloudy  <br/>
thinking, with a mind full of &quot;yeah but&quot; which they&#39;ve used before in  <br/>
other situations.  Some like to blame other people, thing and  <br/>
situations  and have done so for years.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you who have never seen Vicky Pollard (a character from  <br/>
Little Britain) get a chance to see some, think of AlwaysLearning  <br/>
when you see it.  Not the good posts, but those that get the list  <br/>
busy and crazy and all that.   (No, but... yeah, but... no, but...)<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  The internet now features &quot;no waiting&quot; access to Vicky Pollard.<br/>

hadn&#39;t seen before, and should note for Americans that &quot;estate&quot; means  <br/>
low-income housing apartments, like &quot;the projects&quot; in some cities)<br/>
<br/>
And for those who like documentation,  Vicky is a character done by  <br/>
Matt Lucas, who is just amazing.  I have to really concentrate and  <br/>
think to realize she&#39;s &quot;the same person&quot; as the other characters he  <br/>
does.  He&#39;s as good as Mike Meyers or better and just becoming  <br/>
someone else.<br/>
