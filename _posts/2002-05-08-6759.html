<div id="ygrps-yiv-973586119"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now that I am convinced that I am dull and concerned about the well<br/>
&gt; &gt; being of my children, is there any real harm in *structuring* time<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play games from the &quot;Family Math&quot; book, do science experiments,<br/>
&gt; watch<br/>
&gt; &gt; movies for &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science&quot;, do vocabulary cartoon books and<br/>
&gt; &gt; word puzzle books.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think any of us are born dull.  I think we&#39;re born full of<br/>
curiousity and wonder.<br/>
<br/>
However, life experiences, especially the enforced drudgery of school,<br/>
can do a lot to dull that edge.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe an important part of figuring out how to get &quot;sharp&quot; is examining<br/>
the things that took the edge off and the luster out in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
