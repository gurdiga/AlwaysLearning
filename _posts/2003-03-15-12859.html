&quot;Children do not need to be made to learn, or shown how. They want to and<br/>
they know how.&quot; - John Holt, author of How Children Learn and many other<br/>
inspiring books. <br/>
<br/>
Holt spent many years teaching, observing, and learning from children, but<br/>
any parent can see that children are born wanting to grow up to be part of<br/>
the adult world. They are so curious and eager that it seems almost<br/>
impossible to keep up with their drive to do and learn everything.<br/>
<br/>
Then at some point learning gets separated from the rest of life and turned<br/>
into schooling. We are taught that learning means sitting still, doing as<br/>
you¹re told. Insatiable, passionate learners are turned into bored,<br/>
rebellious, frightened or passive students. Loving parents become frustrated<br/>
and burned out teachers. There must be a better way!<br/>
<br/>
The good news is there are lots of parents and children who are growing<br/>
without schooling -- living/learning in their own way, at their own pace,<br/>
without text books, lessons, tests or  coercion. And there are more and more<br/>
stories of unschooled children who grow up to be happy, confident, competent<br/>
adults doing meaningful and satisfying work. Ready to give unschooling a<br/>
try? Here¹s my handy list of reminders for letting go of schooling and<br/>
enjoying a REAL LIFE:<br/>
<br/>
R - Relax. It sounds easy, but it takes practice. Being a parent may just be<br/>
the most difficult challenge of our lives. When you start to feel stress<br/>
coming on, take a breath, take a hike, take up knitting or square dancing or<br/>
scuba diving. Take it one day (or one moment) at a time.<br/>
<br/>
E - Enjoy. The challenges of parenting are great and the rewards are even<br/>
greater. The years go by so quickly -- embrace each stage and welcome the<br/>
changes. If you take pictures, write a journal or make a scrapbook, you can<br/>
enjoy it again when the children are grown and the house is quiet and<br/>
orderly.<br/>
<br/>
A - Accept and acknowledge the absolutely amazing, awesome and authentic<br/>
individual who&#39;s sharing your life. Allow him to &quot;be how he grows&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
L - Love is the greatest gift. Giving is receiving.<br/>
<br/>
L - Learn from and learn with your children. Learn to play, learn a new<br/>
skill, learn about yourself. Watch how your children learn. Living is<br/>
learning. Teaching is unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
I - Investigate intriguing ideas. Help your children follow their interests.<br/>
One thing leads to another and the infinite universe is interconnected --<br/>
you can start anywhere. It¹s impossible to predict exactly which skills or<br/>
knowledge will be needed in ten or twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
F - Fearlessly forgive and forget. Schooling taught us to be fearful;<br/>
unschooling encourages us to be brave. We all make mistakes. Forgive<br/>
yourself and forge ahead. &quot;Forget everything you learned in school.&quot; Did<br/>
your first boss tell you that? It¹s still good advice. Have fun. Have<br/>
faith. <br/>
<br/>
E - Expect miracles. Encourage and enable exploration. Eschew ersatz<br/>
educational edicts. Embody the traits you wish to pass on.  Empower your<br/>
children (and yourself) to experiment, to engage in a life worth living and<br/>
work worth doing.</div>

This came at a perfect time for me. My chiropractor, whom I&#39;m seeing a <br/>
lot of these days, has four darling children. The oldest is a boy, <br/>
nine, and I just met him. I only spent about 5 minutes with him, but he <br/>
struck me as such an intense, intelligent child. He seems weighted down <br/>
by the world, though, and has a stutter. I mentioned homeschooling to <br/>
the chiro, but he didn&#39;t seem too interested. He talked about how his <br/>
son is reading WAY above his class level and he does WAY much more work <br/>
than the other kids do.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll give him this article and just let the idea start to <br/>
slowly sink in. He&#39;s a very science-oriented guy (used to be an <br/>
engineer) and probably a tough nut to crack, so I&#39;ll soak him in water <br/>
awhile to loosen up his shell! I&#39;ll also try to get him to come to <br/>
Alice in Wonderland, our (homeschool theater) spring play, where he&#39;ll <br/>
see 48 real-life hs-ed kids.<br/>
<br/>
Susan, who hates it when people proselytize -- is that what I&#39;m doing?</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s a little hearing aid type thing that you wear in your ear.  It changes <br/>
the sound of your own voice, and for some reason it works INSTANTLY.  It <br/>
tricks your brain into thinking it&#39;s someone else speaking.  It was amazing <br/>
to watch.<br/>

her website.  The man who invented the machine was a physician who had a <br/>
terrible stutter.  They don&#39;t know exactly why it works, but it is like <br/>
watching a miracle.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it revolutionizes things for people who stutter.  <br/>
