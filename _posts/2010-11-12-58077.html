<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565754148">We have just been offered an amazingly generous gift by my mother-in-law: she recently started a new job, which will last for 2-3 years until her retirement.  Her salary has been tripled and she wants to contribute money every month to our daughter&#39;s college fund.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t actually have a college savings account for our daughter.  I have an account for her, in her name, where I&#39;ve managed to put a small bit away, but that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
My question is: how do unschoolers save for their children&#39;s future?  I don&#39;t want to assume that my 7 year old will or will not want to go to college when she&#39;s older and I know traditional 529 accounts are heavily penalized when the money is used for anything other than &quot;education.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I think my MIL will be open to a conversation about &quot;seed money&quot; in general, rather than &quot;college&quot; money in particular.  She sees how wonderful unschooling is for our family, and I think she&#39;ll appreciate that N *may* choose a non-traditional educational path, like starting a business, or sailing around the world, whatever.  She may choose to go to university, too, but I don&#39;t want that to be predetermined by our planning, or lack thereof.<br/>
<br/>
Any experience, thoughts, suggestions would be greatly appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014264930">You could look into an UGMA or UTMA depending on your state.  It is a universal <br/>
transfer/gift to minors act.  The money can be used for anything except basic <br/>
living expenses.  It can fund college, camps, computers, trade school, cars, <br/>
etc.  In different states it is transferable to kids at different ages.  But it <br/>
can be accessed at anytime by the parents.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is from a financial standpoint, but it is good information never the less.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710875306">The great benefit of a 529 is that it can grow tax free. Money that is<br/>
withdrawn from a Section 529 plan that is not used for higher education<br/>
expenses will be subject to a 10% penalty and income tax on the profits.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you put $10,000 into a Section 529 plan that is now worth<br/>
$15,000, you�d have a $5,000 profit. If that entire amount is withdrawn for<br/>
non-college purposes, you�d have to pay income tax and a 10% penalty on the<br/>
$5,000 gain.<br/>
<br/>
There are up and down sides. We were faced with the same quandary after<br/>
receiving an inheritance for my daughters. We decided to invest in a 529 for<br/>
1/3, a general stock account for 1/3 and left 1/3 in cash for their<br/>
educational expenses while still school age homeschoolers. Good luck!<br/>
