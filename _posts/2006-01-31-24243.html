<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939799299">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
Are there any unschooling resources on audio, CD, video or DVD?  <br/>
<br/>
I am having a hard time getting my husband to read any books on the <br/>
subject, but if it is something he can listen to or watch on TV he <br/>
would be more likely to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for all of the recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna</div>

The Peaceful Parenting tape there is a joint talk, me and Dr. Richard  <br/>
Prystowsky.  Male and PhD both; that might help.<br/>
