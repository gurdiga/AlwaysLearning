<div id="ygrps-yiv-410436601">Just a reminder that the Maryland Home Education Association will hold its<br/>
annual Conference, Resource and Services Fair on Saturday, April 30 at Anne<br/>
Arundel Community College (about midway between Baltimore and Annapolis)<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto will be the Keynote Speaker and his topic will be &quot;The<br/>
Artificial Extension of Childhood.&quot; He will also present a workshop entitled<br/>
&quot;The Curriculum of Power.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there will be many workshops and speaker sessions covering<br/>
topics such as: The Unschooling Philosophy, Foundations of Unschooling,<br/>
Ready for Algebra?, Pay College Without Going Broke, Matching Learning Style<br/>
with Method, Curing Learning Disabilities, and many more. There will be lots<br/>
of activities and workshops for teens including: Learn to Swing Dance,<br/>
Preparing for the New SAT and Researching Your Bliss.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a Resource Fair featuring vendors offering a unique selection<br/>
of many supplies and services not typically found at &quot;Curriculum&quot; fairs.<br/>
Representatives from all Maryland support groups have also been invited to<br/>
the Support Groups Fair to provide information about their groups and help<br/>
attendees find a support group in their area.<br/>

<br/>
FUN Books will be at the conference with lots of special discounted &quot;scratch<br/>
and dent&quot; items, discontinued items and our regular selection of great<br/>
resources for homeschooling and unschooling. Remember, we can&#39;t bring all<br/>
the items in our catalog, so to be sure that we bring the items you want, we<br/>
strongly encourage you to pre-order from our web site and put a note in the<br/>
&quot;comments&quot; section that you will pick up your order at the conference. That<br/>
way you won&#39;t have to pay shipping, you&#39;ll be sure we bring the items you<br/>
want, and you won&#39;t have to worry about someone else buying our last copy of<br/>
an item you wanted! You can also use the comments section to list items you<br/>
are not sure you want to purchase yet and would like to see at the<br/>
conference before making a decision. Visit www.FUN-Books.com to place your<br/>
order soon!<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to distribute this message to anyone you feel may be able<br/>
to benefit from this conference.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
