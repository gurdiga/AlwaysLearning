<div id="ygrps-yiv-580949174">Hello, I am recently new here, and just want to share a loosely related <br/>
experience, showing how I have been changing and how much I appreciate <br/>
having others for support in unschooling... I am a mom of 3 boys ages <br/>
8, 6, 3yrs, homeschooling rather unhappily/ ambivalently for 3-4 years, <br/>
basically up a creek without a paddle was how I saw myself...<br/>
<br/>
I was at the grocery store today, I normally don&#39;t go out on weekends <br/>
because it is overwhelmingly crowded in Los Angeles, that was my <br/>
reasoning... yet I had a really great time, which got me thinking about <br/>
all the rules and expectations I have and don&#39;t challenge... one of the <br/>
reasons I don&#39;t challenge my own thinking is that the perspective is <br/>
just not there, I have no perspective of myself when I am self <br/>
centered, which I am growing out of slowly and consciously... I am very <br/>
good at reasoning for control and it has been a struggle for me to let <br/>
things go, not be right, see things from a different side, a long windy <br/>
road so far in this life... having babies really brought changes, <br/>
because well it&#39;s impossible to be available for anyone else with my <br/>
ego taking highest priority... so I have had a very hard time with <br/>
homeschooling, and unschooling just seemed impossible though I wanted <br/>
to understand it and get out of my mind trap... I have been working for <br/>
years to let many personal issues go and just get some peace for <br/>
myself, and being aware of the kids as they are not how i want them to <br/>
be... a very wonderful change and the best time of my life really... <br/>
but what changed things very quickly and rather painlessly was to read <br/>
the posts and lurk around in this group... there were many arguments <br/>
and back/ forth posts which I was really interested in due to the <br/>
intensity of spirit and then the gentle release, to each her/ his <br/>
own... I never had such articulate arguments or conversations about my <br/>
thoughts on unschooling... I was trying to think in a giant mushy <br/>
tangle, I could not get a clear thought, but still did not see how I <br/>
was having a tough time... listening to all the ideas here has been <br/>
pivotal for me, and I thought it was so great to go to the grocery <br/>
store and challenge myself to start something and not know how it would <br/>
turn out, I found out that my kids can and will shop in a TIGHTLY <br/>
CROWDED store on a Saturday, are happy getting in and out FAST, and <br/>
surprise, it was not as bad as I thought... really I believe this <br/>
experience came from losing the fear of the unknown, that I have too <br/>
many expectations to meet, they are wholly unnecessary and even if it&#39;s <br/>
worse than I thought, we can go in and find a way to deal with it... <br/>
this is the problem I had with unschooling, thinking too much for the <br/>
kids who are fine and not wanting to be analyzed and today it just <br/>
vanished when we changed our minds...<br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes sense, the ideas came on top of each other... thanks <br/>
to all who participate and allow me to follow the thought process with <br/>
you, it&#39;s been such a great tool...<br/>
<br/>
Jules.</div>

I&#39;m glad this list helped you.<br/>
There are some others you might like too, if you want more and faster.  (Some <br/>
people want less and slower, and that&#39;s okay too.)<br/>

<br/>
I think the mom&#39;s attitude makes ALL the difference.  We&#39;ve had fun stopped <br/>
in freeway traffic (MUCH rarer here than in California).  We&#39;ve had fun in a <br/>
mall in a Christmas rush.   I know from the kid-side and from seeing other <br/>
families and from my own impatient reactions in time past that I COULD make it all <br/>
tense and horrible.  I know how to make it all tense and horrible.  And that <br/>
means I know what NOT to do.  I know how to make it pleasant and peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
I have a collection of people&#39;s accounts of the moment they changed their <br/>
thinking.  Not all are on the website yet (and I&#39;d like to have more, if anyone&#39;s <br/>
inclined to write it down for posterity), and that&#39;s. . .   I can&#39;t find it.  <br/>
 I need a better index. &lt;g&gt;  But here are two related things, and if I do <br/>
find the page I&#39;m thinking about I&#39;ll link it here and if I don&#39;t find it I&#39;ll <br/>
make one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723793778">The page I was thinking about is about chores, and I found it because Joyce <br/>
Fetteroll wrote something clearly wonderful on UnschoolingDiscussion a minute <br/>
ago, and I put it on that page.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I need a &quot;seeing the change&quot; page for each individual topic. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, what a great response from Joyce!  Not only does it apply to chores,<br/>
but it&#39;s a great example of looking at power struggles in a new way....<br/>
which could be involved with any area of life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to see several of these shift stories all on one page, mixing all<br/>
of the topics together.  There is something about seeing them all together<br/>
that I can imagine would be very powerful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else here heard about the movie &quot;What The Bleep Do We Know?&quot;<br/>
You can find out more about it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.whatthebleep.com">http://www.whatthebleep.com</a>  It&#39;s a<br/>
great movie, and relates to the topic here about shifts, changes in<br/>
perspective, choices, etc.  Basically, it&#39;s a movie that talks about<br/>
quantum physics, spirituality, and how they relate to our lives.<br/>
Interviews are woven together with a story about several days of a woman&#39;s<br/>
life, and they serve as a Greek chorus.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, my husband and I took our four guys (ages 10 to 15) to &quot;What the Bleep<br/>
Do We Know?&quot; two weeks ago. It&#39;s playing here in Tempe Arizona Art Theatre.<br/>
The movie supplied us with lots of topics of conversation. We bought the<br/>
book &quot;The Hidden Messages in Water&quot; the same day, and leave it on our coffee<br/>
table. Our kids look through it often and talk to each other about new<br/>
things they&#39;ve noticed. We still bring up things from the movie in our every<br/>
day lives too. It has certainly provided a great avenue for &quot;huge changes in<br/>
perspective&quot; for all of us.<br/>
