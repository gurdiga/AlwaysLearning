<div id="ygrps-yiv-298227853">My son Jeffrey (12) has always preferred very small groups for <br/>
interactions.  He has one best friend that he sees once or twice a <br/>

friendship circle.  <br/>
<br/>
He spends a great deal of his time in his room with his video games, <br/>
Lego sets, and computer.  He did participate in TaeKwonDo a few years <br/>
ago and earned his Black Belt but it wasn&#39;t a passion.  All of us <br/>
(parents and siblings) were involved so it was kind of a fun family <br/>

team that he did okay on; but again, it wasn&#39;t a passion.  <br/>
<br/>
My DH is very supportive of unschooling, but he is worried about <br/>
Jeffrey&#39;s seemingly self-imposed isolation.  He is wondering if there <br/>
is something we can do to get Jeffrey out and active.  In fact, at <br/>
Jeffrey&#39;s last doctor visit, the pediatrician was concerned with <br/>
Jeffrey&#39;s skin color as it&#39;s super pale.  He does have a sickly <br/>
appearance.  He just really dislikes going outside and doesn&#39;t get <br/>
any sun at all.  The doctor ordered blood tests worried about <br/>
possible medical conditions but Jeffrey is in fine health.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in letting Jeffrey be Jeffrey.  We show him things to do <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118051627">I can tell you as a very introverted child I was pushed by my parents<br/>
whom I guess wanted a more outgoing/popular child into interactions I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to have. I was completely happy in my own little world<br/>
with 1 or 2 friends to share it with. To push me only made me retreat<br/>
further into myself and feel there was something wrong with me because<br/>
I was shy or feel badly that I wasn&#39;t &quot;popular&quot; with many friends. God<br/>
made us all the way we were supposed to be for a reason. Your son will<br/>
probably touch someones life in a big way because he is who he is.<br/>
Tell your hubby to relax and let him like you said be himself.<br/>

Do things with him yourselves.  You don&#39;t need to invite another  <br/>
child, though you could sometimes.  The more you do as a family the  <br/>
more shared experiences you have and the more you&#39;ll be directly  <br/>
involved in his learning.  Go out to eat.  Not just dinner; breakfast  <br/>
and lunch are cheaper and less crowded.  Interesting places with  <br/>
something to see.  Go to a concert or a museum or a movie every week  <br/>
or so.  Go out of town if you have to.  Stay in motels with wireless  <br/>
so  he can still play games.  Being out of the house and being in new  <br/>
situations shouldn&#39;t need to involve &quot;activities&quot; organized for kids,  <br/>
nor other kids even.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Am I supporting Jeffrey&#39;s desires or am I hindering his social  <br/>
growth-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of both, but those aren&#39;t the only two things.  He&#39;ll only  <br/>
be 12 until he&#39;s 13.  It might be harder to do things as a family if   <br/>
you wait.<br/>
<br/>
Getting out (out of town, out of state, out of the country maybe)  <br/>
will not only give him access to ideas and things and places he might  <br/>
not find at home, but it will give you impressive, concrete things to  <br/>
tell your family and coworkers.<br/>
<br/>
Consider gaming conventions, computer fairs,<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is wondering if there is something we can do to get Jeffrey out  <br/>

<br/>
If you equate &quot;0ut&quot; with &quot;active&quot; and he&#39;s not a kinesthetic,  <br/>
athletic kid, he might avoid out even more.  If you can combine out  <br/>
with things he&#39;s already interested in, you&#39;ll have a better chance  <br/>
of changing things some.<br/>

  ago and earned his Black Belt but it wasn&#39;t a passion. All of us <br/>
  (parents and siblings) were involved so it was kind of a fun family <br/>
  thing. <br/>
  .<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  has he always been unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
because, if not, your description below could be, nearly to a T, about my son - including the one friend with no interest in cultivating other friendships, the tae kwon do as a family event (but he quit and my daughter and i continued), and the period of time spent only going to game stop, etc.<br/>
<br/>
my son (10) was in school, though, until January of this year.  so that really extreme isolation was a product of deschooling, for the most part.  however, the temperament traits have been there from day 1 - he has always needed lots of time  alone, never been interested in, or able to manage groups of kids smoothly, etc. however - the mistake we made, i now am convinced, is to push too much, to encourage and cajole him to &quot;get out, get active, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
it resulted in a tremendous amount of stress and strain, lots of events that were NOT fun, because he didn&#39;t want to be there in the first place, and a backlash that was more severe and more long lasting, once we came to our senses and gave him the room to do or not do whatever he felt comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
so, fast forward 10 months, we can now do things together as a family that involve going places, and he will hop on his bike with me for short errands and destinations, (like game crazy!)  <br/>
<br/>
he enjoys short visits with friends, even small groups, especially if its something i have arranged around his interests (like we went to a goat farm and he resisted going, but because i have not even *requested* that he do *anything* he doesn&#39;t want to for months, he was willing to go &quot;for a few minutes&quot; with the agreement that we would  leave if he wanted to, whenever he wanted - and within seconds he was having and amazing time - he milked the  goats and even drank goat milk - which was amazing for him, as he is very selective about food choices).<br/>
<br/>
it is also apparent that he really enjoys the company of adults more than the company of most kids - so when we are available for focused attention and interaction, he is much more calm and contented - and willing to do stuff/go places.<br/>
<br/>
i have also started hosting activities in our home - invited a few other familes  for things like duct tape inventions, sugar skull decoration, and coming up  in december candy house creation.    its a way to meet *my* need for socialization, get some energy going in the house, and possibly a fun activity my son will participate in (but even if he doesn&#39;t, he ends up hanging with friends, gaming, or whatever and it brings a different energy into the house, just for a short time.)<br/>
<br/>
but all that said, he still really prefers lots of time with just our family.  and i am sure what he needs more than anything is to be appreciated and valued for who he is.  when he really feels that unconditional positive regard, he becomes more open to trying new things, venturing out in small steps.  but group activities designed for kids have never appealed.  its just not who he is.  an introverted person is an introverted person - they are drained by interactions and recharged by alone time.  there is no changing that, just recognizing it and working with it.<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mentioned a church related activity, so I&#39;m assuming you are<br/>
involved in church related activities.  One thing I&#39;ve noticed about<br/>
church related activities is there is a large pressure on kids to become<br/>
friends with each other to have &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; children as<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this relates to you guys or not, but I&#39;ve seen this<br/>
happen to kids we know.  One church going event a week can seem huge for<br/>
a kid that doesn&#39;t like to get out of the house to socialize. <br/>
Especially if he doesn&#39;t connect with any or most of the kids.  If<br/>
church going is a must and he must socialize while there, it could be<br/>
filling up his social meter.</div>

Thank you.  I think if people freely share their ideas and that gets  <br/>
passed on from person to person, the world is better right behind us  <br/>

teacher service.  They also take extra academic classes through <br/>
another place that requires a lot of work.  And that&#39;s just the <br/>
child&#39;s schedule.  The parents are very busy with work and school.  <br/>
<br/>
As I read through the responses, I feel that everything is okay.  <br/>
Jeffrey does go out nearly every day as he likes to do regular life <br/>
daily things with me or his dad.  The &quot;getting out&quot; concern was <br/>
really centered on the idea of kids&#39; activities.  Jeffrey doesn&#39;t <br/>
like joining groups. After my DH and I talked some more, I realized <br/>
it was the fear that we have no external measure of his learning that <br/>
had my DH worried.  He didn&#39;t even realize that old tape was playing <br/>
in his mind!  <br/>
<br/>
Jeffrey is way excited about today.  Saints Row 2 is being released <br/>
this morning.  :)  <br/>
