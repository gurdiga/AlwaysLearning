<div id="ygrps-yiv-546078677">-=-No longer will you have to rack your brain trying to think up appropriate <br/>
consequences.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Weird.  <br/>
<br/>
But not as bad as some parenting plans!<br/>
<br/>
The name of one of the pages was &quot;Control Your kids&#39; behavior, yet stay <br/>
friends&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The pre-made themes were:<br/>
Excessive Arguing<br/>
Leaving the Lights On<br/>
Not Putting Things Away<br/>
A Job Poorly Done<br/>
S-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g the Truth<br/>
Taking Without Asking<br/>
Talking Back<br/>
<br/>
For a family in which it IS hard for the parents to get any ideas, where <br/>
their goal is controlling their kids, it&#39;s more innocuous than most things I&#39;ve <br/>
seen.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling seems SO much easier to me!  (And $15 cheaper &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
