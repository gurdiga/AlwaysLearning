<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847641542">There are 2 issues in our home right now with my ds, 15.   <br/>
<br/>
He thinks i love or care more about his younger brother (9) than i do him.   Sibling rivalry and jealousy are not uncommon it seems.  Hows that going in the unschooling households?<br/>
<br/>
Also, he seems really independent at this stage and i want him to continue to be free in his choices.  He seems to need me less.  But the whole no rules and freedom thing (many years now) seems to be backfiring.   He&#39;s suggesting that it makes him feel like i dont care if i dont punish him like his friends are.  <br/>
<br/>
His 18 yo friend is a big influence.  I debated with df about discipline.  He feels kids need punishment, rules, chores and even spankings when younger.  We were camping at the time.  When we were packing up to leave, he and my son decided they would sit on their butts and let me do all the work to prove a point. <br/>
Am I being clear?   <br/>

DO you show him enough attention? I think there is a tendency for  <br/>

you mention, specifically, how independent he&#39;s getting. Is that  <br/>
important to you? Maybe that feels a little like he&#39;s being pushed away.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t blame the other kid - he may be putting these ideas in your  <br/>
son&#39;s head, but the ideas are finding fertile ground, so there much be  <br/>
something going on with him.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, if another kid told my 16 yo that her parents must not care  <br/>
about her that much if they don&#39;t punish and give chores and stuff,  <br/>
she&#39;d laugh out loud. So - think - why isn&#39;t HE laughing?<br/>

I think that even in the most ideal surroundings, there is an  <br/>
instinct to leave.  Don&#39;t totally resist and deny such instincts.<br/>
<br/>
I found myself surprised to be impatient with teens sometimes when it  <br/>
seemed they hadn&#39;t done anything to trigger exasperation.  And I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t exasperated in general; it wasn&#39;t a bad moment for me, I just  <br/>
found myself sometimes being quickly critical of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s an instinct to make it easier for them to leave the nest.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Civilized&quot; humans have worked hard to extinguish or deny or belittle  <br/>
the idea that people, as animals, have instincts.  If there was no  <br/>
natural urge to move on, every bird, every bear, every mouse would  <br/>
still live where it was born.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, of course. It sort of comes and goes, though, during those  <br/>
years before the child becomes really ready to go. I&#39;m thinking that  <br/>
some parents feel that urge and then that&#39;s it - they start giving off  <br/>
the &quot;its time for you to get out and be independent&quot; vibes and that  <br/>
overrides the &quot;I love the young person you are right now&quot; vibes. And,  <br/>
the kid might be feeling the beginning of those &quot;time for me to be  <br/>
independent vibes&quot; while, at the same time, that is pretty scary and  <br/>
he might need extra amounts of the &quot;I love you and am here for you,&quot;  <br/>
vibes from his mother.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that paradox HAS been true for both of my older daughters.  <br/>
One is moved out and very independent, and we did occasionally have  <br/>
more conflict for a while before she really got moved out on her own.  <br/>
But, still, at that exact same time that we were both sensing those  <br/>
push away feelings, there was a lot of clinginess and holding-on  <br/>
feelings, too. Now I&#39;m feeling the same with Roxana, although I a lot  <br/>
less intensely, much much more calmly, and that&#39;s really a personality  <br/>
difference in the kids AND the fact that it is the second time through  <br/>
it for me. And, Rox isn&#39;t one to act quickly on a feeling so there  <br/>
isn&#39;t any hurry. When Roya started having those &quot;time to be on my own&quot;  <br/>
urges - her every nerve ending cried out to totally satisfy that urge  <br/>
right now! Roxana is happier to satisfy it by being here with us and  <br/>
moving gradually toward more independence. Well, and it is helping  <br/>
that she just spent 3 months in France, living on her own, so she got  <br/>
a LOT of that urge satisfied in a big way and can relax happily at  <br/>
home, now, even though we all know it won&#39;t last forever.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I&#39;m not saying to try to deny or belittle the &quot;time to be  <br/>
independent&quot; feelings. Not at all. I&#39;m saying that at the same time  <br/>
that those feelings are rising up, don&#39;t go too far in stopping  with  <br/>
the &quot;I love you and care about you.&quot; After all, this is a 15 year old  <br/>
- he probably is not going to actually move away and live on his own  <br/>
for at least a few years - you still have significant time with him at  <br/>
home. The starting urges for moving on may be there - but I bet  <br/>
they&#39;re there in the way the toddler urges are there to move away from  <br/>
mom and then run back and touch base before bravely setting out again.<br/>
<br/>
And the child who has that strong sense of support behind him will,  <br/>
like the toddler, be more able and competent to be independent.<br/>

<br/>
The danger I was foreseeing in some of the advice was that if the mom  <br/>
presses a young man to be closer to his mom--if she pulls him back-- <br/>
he could react badly.<br/>
<br/>
What seems to have helped here has been me asking the kids to do real  <br/>
things, that I would ask an adult houseguest or roommate or my  <br/>
husband to do.  Not always, but occasionally.  And then thanking them  <br/>
sincerely, for having done the thing so that I didn&#39;t have to.   <br/>
Sometimes it involves going somewhere or handling details of a social  <br/>
situation, or even asking Marty to do things he can do because he&#39;s  <br/>
tall and strong.<br/>
<br/>
What doesn&#39;t help is me going all sentimental on them and saying I  <br/>
miss them being toddlers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When a young man is feeling the house is small and the world is big,  <br/>
it&#39;s no time to start cooing about baby things.  It might just fling  <br/>
him farther.<br/>

Zoe will be home next week after eight months in New York. She was  <br/>
fantastically independent - and called me several times a day. She  <br/>
found an apartment, a job, went to school - and still needed me to  <br/>
help her negotiate certain parts of that journey. I just said to her,  <br/>
&quot;When you get home, let&#39;s just sit on the couch and hug all day.&quot; And  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No - that&#39;s not what I was talking about at all. I was comparing the  <br/>
behavior to that of toddlers, that the more supported they feel, the  <br/>
more brave they can be, but not saying the mom should talk about  <br/>
missing his toddlerhood. Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
But as far as sentimentality goes - that might depend on the kid. Some  <br/>
might actually appreciate a mom expressing out loud the kind of  <br/>
ambivalent, sweet/sad sentiments that a kid might be feeling a bit of,  <br/>
too. Maybe not most guys, but maybe some. A little would go a long way  <br/>
- and for some kids it might be awful. I only have girls, myself, but  <br/>
watched closely as my sister&#39;s boys (now 29 and 26) left home. One of  <br/>
them is a very &quot;mushy&quot; kind of guy - cuddly, still. The other a bit  <br/>
more macho-like, I guess. But I remember my sister noting back then  <br/>
that she felt it was important for her not to stop hugging them,  <br/>
touching them on the arm when speaking, looking directly into their  <br/>
eyes, speaking opening about how much she liked them. Since then, I&#39;ve  <br/>
noticed that lots of moms seem to withdraw from closeness - physical  <br/>
and emotional - with their sons when they get big and manly. I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking maybe they might do it too abruptly - too much withdrawal,  <br/>
too soon. So - for this particular case - a 15 yo with a 9 yo brother  <br/>
- maybe the jealousy is about the younger brother still getting all  <br/>
kinds of loving attention, while the older one is feeling mom is, if  <br/>
not pushing him away, going along a bit too eagerly with his pushing  <br/>
away himself.<br/>
<br/>
A 15 yo probably doesn&#39;t want the kind of loving attention a 9 yo  <br/>
wants. He&#39;s probably not going to want to sit in mom&#39;s lap and cuddle,  <br/>
while she reads him a story. But my suggestion is to find ways that  <br/>
are appropriate for that particular 15 yo to continue to give him  <br/>
focused attention and love. It might be as simple as remembering to  <br/>
look directly into his eyes when he talks to you. It might be making  <br/>
the effort to do special things like make his favorite foods or do his  <br/>
laundry for him (if he usually does it) or buy a shirt or a cd or  <br/>
something he might like, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Although I didn&#39;t have sentimental stuff in mind, I also don&#39;t  <br/>
entirely want to rule it out. I know that my 17 yo daughter still  <br/>
LOVES to get all mushy and cuddly with me - she&#39;ll hug me and kiss me  <br/>
and say, &quot;You&#39;re my favorite mommy - I LOOOOVE you.&quot; And I do the same  <br/>
kind of stuff back. She does seem to be wanting more and more of that  <br/>
kind of gushy stuff - and I do most definitely have the sense that it  <br/>
is because she&#39;s having those urges toward independence at the same  <br/>
time. She&#39;s doing things like taking the bus places instead of asking  <br/>
me for rides. And she&#39;s been studying for the drivers license test -  <br/>
so she&#39;s making those kinds of moves.<br/>

Yes,  this is what has been on my mind of late.  I am uncertain that he wants to be hugged/kissed, so i backed off.  I usually kiss him when i go to his room in the am, while he is sleeping.

There are other ways to give your teens the touch they need without <br/>
hugging. I used to lean over and put my arm around my son while he <br/>
was playing games on the computer. He&#39;s much taller than me and he <br/>
would put his arm on my head as crutch. He&#39;s 17 now and hugs and <br/>
even kisses me every time he sees me and every time we part. The <br/>
kisses on the cheek surprised me because he hadn&#39;t really done that <br/>
before. He&#39;s not living at home now so that&#39;s not like 50 times a <br/>
day or anything. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883443713">I know that one of my big little brothers likes to have his shoulders<br/>
massaged (just for a few minutes when hanging out in the kitchen, not<br/>
a full on massage with oils etc).  Friendly and loving but also more<br/>
manly than hugs and kisses :)  My dad, who is very loving but not a<br/>
huge hugger (we hug now as hello/goodbye but didn&#39;t really when I was<br/>
a teenager) has a very sweet way of squeezing my shoulder, often with<br/>
an arm around me. I think someone else mentioned touching an arm when<br/>
talking.  Maybe different kinds of touching would work better if hugs<br/>
and kisses aren&#39;t really his thing right now but he still needs to<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;So - for this particular case - a 15 yo with a 9 yo brother<br/>
&gt; - maybe the jealousy is about the younger brother still getting all<br/>

&gt; not pushing him away, going along a bit too eagerly with his pushing<br/>
&gt; away himself.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, this is what has been on my mind of late. I am uncertain that he wants<br/>
&gt; to be hugged/kissed, so i backed off. I usually kiss him when i go to his<br/>
&gt; room in the am, while he is sleeping. But he is taller than me now and<br/>
&gt; slowly, it seemed that hugging became uncomfortable for him. I want that<br/>
&gt; back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;A 15 yo probably doesn&#39;t want the kind of loving attention a 9 yo<br/>
&gt; wants. He&#39;s probably not going to want to sit in mom&#39;s lap and cuddle,<br/>
&gt; while she reads him a story. But my suggestion is to find ways that<br/>
&gt; are appropriate for that particular 15 yo to continue to give him<br/>
&gt; focused attention and love. It might be as simple as remembering to<br/>
&gt; look directly into his eyes when he talks to you. It might be making<br/>
&gt; the effort to do special things like make his favorite foods or do his<br/>
&gt; laundry for him (if he usually does it) or buy a shirt or a cd or<br/>
&gt; something he might like, etc.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really? I am not feeling that doing/buying can replace the touching/hugging.<br/>

Oh!  I hadn&#39;t assumed that any of those things would be lacking.  I  <br/>
bought Marty a shirt just this week (Batman, brown-on-brown, used)  <br/>
and Holly the new Cyndi Lauper CD and I offer them food all the  <br/>
time.  So I was assuming that if with all those things the  <br/>
relationship was still seeming distant, maybe it was a natural  <br/>
distancing.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right--it&#39;s possible the younger kid is getting attention  <br/>
that&#39;s making the older one jealous and the older relationship was  <br/>
being neglected or changing without ideas for maintaining or  <br/>
strenghtening it.<br/>

Don&#39;t think of it as a substitution of one thing for another.  Think  <br/>
principles over rules.   In any one moment, doing the more attentive  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe not &quot;replace.&quot; but supplement? It isn&#39;t the &quot;stuff&quot; of the  <br/>
buying - it is showing that you&#39;re thinking about him. It isn&#39;t so  <br/>
much what you do for them as the fact that you want to do things for  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I bought my 23 yo a swimsuit the other day.  I knew it would fit  <br/>
because she&#39;d bought herself one almost like it at the same place. She  <br/>
swims a lot and the pool chemicals wear out suits and I happened to  <br/>
see this one on sale and thought of her. It is the &quot;thought of her&quot;  <br/>
part that matters. She&#39;ll be happy to have the extra suit, but it&#39;ll  <br/>
be the fact that I was thinking about her, that I was aware of her  <br/>
needs, that really matters.<br/>
<br/>
I get your concern - substituting buying stuff for them for showing  <br/>
love? It is what neglectful parents do. There is no substitute for  <br/>
being willing to spend your own time with your child - but when they  <br/>
are getting to be older teens and young adults and you&#39;re not spending  <br/>
as much time with them, it is awfully nice for them to know that  <br/>
you&#39;re still thinking about them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. This is a perfect example!<br/>
<br/>
We do the same - just touch in some way as we pass each other. We have  <br/>
a couch that has a walkway behind it - the kids are very often sitting  <br/>
there with their laptops and I just pat the tops of their heads as I  <br/>
walk by. They do the same to me. Just last night, I plopped down on  <br/>
the other end of the couch from one of my daughters and snuggled my  <br/>
feet up against her. She patted them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve reminded my husband to keep up the loving touches and eye-contact  <br/>
and all that, as the girls hit their teens. Again, I think it is  <br/>
natural that a dad changes his ways of being physical when his  <br/>
daughters become more womanly, but not to stop altogether. In fact,  <br/>
maybe they need more of it. Don&#39;t sit them on your lap and kiss them  <br/>
and sort of &quot;handle them&quot; the same way as when they were toddlers. But  <br/>
don&#39;t just suddenly be hands-off, either. That hurts.<br/>

&gt; What? Why are we even here discussing how to raise our kids?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting, isn&#39;t it? I thought a lot about that when I first read it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe surprising to her? First of all, &quot;little impact&quot; doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
&quot;no impact&quot; For example, just a little more likely for children to be  <br/>
depressed? Is that okay?<br/>
<br/>
But, I think she&#39;s wrong. I think her conclusion is based on  <br/>
statistical research and what the research REALLY shows is that it is  <br/>
very difficult to nail down differences in parenting other than the  <br/>
extremes.<br/>
<br/>
The way the studies work is that they take a large group of parents  <br/>
and kids and they either observe them directly (in natural settings or  <br/>
in labs) and/or they &quot;survey&quot; them - ask them lots of questions.<br/>
<br/>
They come up with parenting style categories - usually authoritarian,  <br/>
authoritative, indulgent, and neglectful. They might have some  <br/>
additional subcategories like &quot;demanding&quot; and &quot;responsive.&#39; So you  <br/>
have each parent identified this way -  they might be indulgent and  <br/>
responsive or authoritative and responsive, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Then they do the same with the kids. They come up with a bunch of  <br/>
categories (i.e., school outcomes, social interaction competence,  <br/>
happiness/depression) - they give each kid a score in each category.  <br/>
They CHOOSE the categories, they define them and decide what gets a  <br/>
kid a high score and what gives a low score.<br/>
<br/>
Then they use snazzy statistical techniques to find correlations  <br/>
between the parental categories and the kid categories.<br/>
<br/>
Please notice that it ALL depends on how they set up the studies in  <br/>
the first place. The way they are typically set up, the vast majority  <br/>
of parents are authoritative - and within that very large group, they  <br/>
don&#39;t find parenting matters much. That&#39;s because they&#39;re lumping  <br/>
together way too many different kinds of parenting -  because the  <br/>
differences are in hard-to-nail-down, hard-to-observe, hard-to-ask-the- <br/>
right-question-about, aspects of parenting. Do they (are they even  <br/>
able to) look at how supportive a parent is, how in-tune with a child,  <br/>
how thoughtful of children&#39;s needs, how good a parent is in helping a  <br/>
child learn to navigate the world, and on and on. And, the categories  <br/>
for the kids are likely to be completely ignoring things that are very  <br/>
important to some of us. They ask, for example, kids and parents (and  <br/>
sometimes teachers) to rate kids on their &quot;competency&quot; levels - how  <br/>
well do they follow instructions, how well do they behave in class,  <br/>
how well do they get along with peers. And &quot;problems in school?&quot; Well,  <br/>
yeah, reading later is a big problem. Do we care? Not if they don&#39;t GO  <br/>
to school!<br/>
<br/>
Turns out, within that big authoritative group, there isn&#39;t much  <br/>
correlation found between parenting behaviors and child-outcomes. Not  <br/>
actually surprising at all. It is a statistical muddle, not a real- <br/>
life parenting muddle.<br/>

<br/>
So even if we&#39;re doing nothing more than making sure we&#39;re not really  <br/>
bad parents, the discussion is worth having.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And a handful of parents have a talent for turning  messed up kids  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s talking about foster or adoptive parents there.  Or  <br/>
parents who help their kids out following traumatic events or  <br/>
something; I don&#39;t know.  But there are rare humans who can help  <br/>
messed up people turn *themselves* into healthy ones.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Much more common are the 95% of parents in the vast middle range,  <br/>
whose parenting techniques have surprisingly little impact on how  <br/>
happy or  successful their kids turn out to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s the definition of &quot;happy&quot;?  Some parents are perfectly  <br/>
happy spanking and grounding and shaming their kids.  And if that by  <br/>
itself doesn&#39;t make them  happy, they go and tell their friends all  <br/>
about it and the parents say &quot;GOOD for you; those brats...&quot; and they  <br/>
all laugh.  I&#39;ve seen it; I&#39;ve heard it.  I saw it as a kid, and I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen it as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Happy and successful&quot; is probably measured in ways that put 95% of  <br/>
the people in that range.  Not homeless, not in prison, not  <br/>
hospitalized for depression...<br/>

<br/>
Okay...<br/>
<br/>
If someone thinks the world will end on a certain day, is making a  <br/>
movie about it the way to go?  Several outcomes are possible, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
1, history ends that day and nobody will be alive to to say &quot;Oh, you  <br/>
were right!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
2, history doesn&#39;t end that day, the filmmaker is a dork,  and the  <br/>
whole project was a massive waste of time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But as to children, anything that will make the rest of today more  <br/>
pleasant is worth having, even if the world is ending in 2012, or  <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>

<br/>
Its about living with our children Right Now.  Our children are not <br/>
unfinished products, future activists, or stooges to The Man, our <br/>
kids are Who They Are right now.  That&#39;s where unschooling happens.  <br/>
If you are thinking in terms of Raising your children you aren&#39;t <br/>
looking at the human beings living in your home, you are looking at <br/>
future adults - and those are pure imagination on your part.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to live with our kids Right Now *and* hold the whole <br/>
world in our minds at the same time?  Yes.  Its challenging, but its <br/>
possible.<br/>

over how they &quot;turn out&quot;. It&#39;s about having a loving, joyful <br/>
relationship with them now. At least that way I won&#39;t mess them up <br/>
(I hope).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Interesting, isn&#39;t it? I thought a lot about that when I first read it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe surprising to her? First of all, &quot;little impact&quot; doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
&gt; &quot;no impact&quot; For example, just a little more likely for children to be  <br/>
&gt; depressed? Is that okay?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, I think she&#39;s wrong. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So do I. <br/>
<br/>
And &quot;little impact&quot; can also mean &quot;little obvious impact&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure the idea that, in nearly all cases, our parenting doesn&#39;t<br/>
affect the development of our children will be music to the ears of<br/>
the lazy and incompetent!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think her conclusion is based on  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; statistical research and what the research REALLY shows is that it is  <br/>
&gt; very difficult to nail down differences in parenting other than the  <br/>
&gt; extremes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The way the studies work is that they take a large group of parents  <br/>
&gt; and kids and they either observe them directly (in natural settings or  <br/>
&gt; in labs) and/or they &quot;survey&quot; them - ask them lots of questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They come up with parenting style categories - usually authoritarian,  <br/>
&gt; authoritative, indulgent, and neglectful. They might have some  <br/>
&gt; additional subcategories like &quot;demanding&quot; and &quot;responsive.&#39; So you  <br/>
&gt; have each parent identified this way -  they might be indulgent and  <br/>
&gt; responsive or authoritative and responsive, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All subjective concepts to begin with and impossible to quantify in<br/>
any truly meaningful way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Then they do the same with the kids. They come up with a bunch of  <br/>
&gt; categories (i.e., school outcomes, social interaction competence,  <br/>
&gt; happiness/depression) - they give each kid a score in each category.  <br/>
&gt; They CHOOSE the categories, they define them and decide what gets a  <br/>
&gt; kid a high score and what gives a low score.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then they use snazzy statistical techniques to find correlations  <br/>
&gt; between the parental categories and the kid categories.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perceived patterns, like inkblot butterflies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Please notice that it ALL depends on how they set up the studies in  <br/>
&gt; the first place. The way they are typically set up, the vast majority  <br/>
&gt; of parents are authoritative - and within that very large group, they  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t find parenting matters much. That&#39;s because they&#39;re lumping  <br/>
&gt; together way too many different kinds of parenting -  because the  <br/>
&gt; differences are in hard-to-nail-down, hard-to-observe, hard-to-ask-the- <br/>
&gt; right-question-about, aspects of parenting. Do they (are they even  <br/>
&gt; able to) look at how supportive a parent is, how in-tune with a child,  <br/>
&gt; how thoughtful of children&#39;s needs, how good a parent is in helping a  <br/>
&gt; child learn to navigate the world, and on and on. And, the categories  <br/>
&gt; for the kids are likely to be completely ignoring things that are very  <br/>
&gt; important to some of us. They ask, for example, kids and parents (and  <br/>
&gt; sometimes teachers) to rate kids on their &quot;competency&quot; levels - how  <br/>
&gt; well do they follow instructions, how well do they behave in class,  <br/>
&gt; how well do they get along with peers. And &quot;problems in school?&quot; Well,  <br/>
&gt; yeah, reading later is a big problem. Do we care? Not if they don&#39;t GO  <br/>
&gt; to school!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turns out, within that big authoritative group, there isn&#39;t much  <br/>
&gt; correlation found between parenting behaviors and child-outcomes. Not  <br/>
&gt; actually surprising at all. It is a statistical muddle, not a real- <br/>
&gt; life parenting muddle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -pam<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IMNSHO, much of what&#39;s generally referred to as Social Science (an<br/>
oxymoron if ever there was one) is a form of self-fulfilling prophecy.<br/>
Researchers into human behaviour see what they want to see based on<br/>
their personal experiences in the world and, though they may use the<br/>
scientific method as a template, they create the details of their<br/>
research criteria according to what they set out to find. Not<br/>
necessarily at a conscious level or deliberately (although that does<br/>
happen), but because they&#39;re humans too and objectivity is an<br/>
impossibility when humans study the behaviour of other humans.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested to know how many parents were involved in the<br/>
research that produced the observation made by the author of the book.<br/>
I remember having a pop at a social &#39;scientist&#39; one time for<br/>
publishing a sweeping pronouncement on human behaviour generally that<br/>
was totally at odds with my real life experience and turned out to be<br/>
based on her study of the behaviour of just 19 people. <br/>
<br/>
That kind of nonsense isn&#39;t rare. Another time, I had a social<br/>
scientist tell me that her research had shown mothers who have a full<br/>
time job outside the home spend as much time with their children over<br/>
the course of a week as mothers who stay at home full time. That was<br/>
based on a study of just a few hundred mothers with no indication<br/>
given as to what the selection process was or what the research<br/>
criteria were. I told her her results seemed to me like something that<br/>
had come out of the back end of a certain farm animal. Naughty me. So<br/>
petulant and rude at times.<br/>
<br/>
But, the fact is, I&#39;m totally cynical about social &#39;science&#39; (which it<br/>
isn&#39;t) and statistics generally. They can be used to &#39;prove&#39; anything<br/>
you want to prove. <br/>
<br/>
Then there was that classic headline in a national newspaper here a<br/>
few years ago, &quot;75% of Australians don&#39;t want Charles as the next King<br/>
of Australia&quot; (the Queen of England is still, on paper, the Head of<br/>
State of Australia, and the belief is that Charles should be bypassed<br/>
when the time comes in favour of Prince William because he&#39;s more in<br/>
touch with &#39;the people&#39; in today&#39;s world). So, &quot;75% of Australians&quot; is<br/>
about 15 million people, right? Hmm... I didn&#39;t see any notification<br/>
of a referendum in the media. No. It&#39;s 75% of the little more than 300<br/>
Australians living in the same part of the country as the research<br/>
company who were asked a predesignated question and were deemed, we<br/>
know not how, to be &quot;statistically representative&quot; of the entire<br/>
population.<br/>
