<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746123890">Hello all. I have been lurking a little while. I have a 5 month old <br/>
daughter whom I plan to homeschool, and I am leaning more and more <br/>
towards unschooling. I taught in public & private schools for 5 years <br/>
before quitting for a variety of reasons. I&#39;m not even going to try <br/>
to say anything else about that right now, since my last placement <br/>
left me pretty bitter. <br/>
<br/>
I just read an awesome new book that I had to tell you folks about. <br/>
It&#39;s called Identical Strangers: A Memoir of Twins Separated and <br/>
Reunited. In addition to telling their story, Elyse Schein and Paula <br/>
Bernstein talk about other twins who were separated as babies. One <br/>
pair of men were both obsessively clean. One attributed it to growing <br/>
up with his birth mother, who was like that too, and the other <br/>
thought it was in reaction to having a mom who was a slob. When <br/>
questioned about the eating habits of another pair when they were <br/>
still preschool age, one adoptive mom said the kid was an awful <br/>
eater, and would only eat things that had cinnamon on them. The <br/>
adoptive mom of the other twin said that her daughter was a wonderful <br/>
eater, and would eat absolutely anything as long as she put cinnamon <br/>
on it! It blows my mind that a little quirk that specific would be <br/>
genetic.<br/>
<br/>
As horribly sad and wrong as it was that these children were <br/>
separated, this is such amazing information to have. It just goes to <br/>
show you how very much our babies are their own little people the <br/>
moment they are born. Of course I want my baby to eat lots of things <br/>
and be neat and clean, etc etc. But knowing how very, very strong her <br/>
inborn preferences and tendencies are, I feel like it is my <br/>
responsibility to work with her within her comfort zone instead of <br/>
trying to change her completely. I want to be the &quot;She&#39;ll eat <br/>
anything, as long as it has cinnamon on it&quot; mom. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me listen to all your conversations, as I&#39;m <br/>
learning a lot. <br/>
