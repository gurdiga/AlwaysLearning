<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439490900">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
First of all a quick intro. I&#39;m Kerrie, unschooling Mum to my son <br/>
Elijah. We&#39;re from Australia. I joined this list out of curiosity a <br/>
while back but I found I wasn&#39;t quite in the headspace for it then. <br/>
I was still caught up in the idea of teaching, and to be frank, <br/>
thought most of you were a bit nuts. After many years of <br/>
conditioning to thinkthe only way kids really learn is via formal <br/>
lessons subjects and dictation, it was such a challenge to undo all <br/>
of that and see learning for what it truly is (natural & constant, <br/>
and at it&#39;s best when child-led.) I have now completely embraced <br/>
unschooling and can&#39;t believe I ever doubted the concept. It really <br/>
does seem radical, when you consider it against the general view in <br/>
society of learning and education! But less radical the more I think <br/>
about it. It grows more normal every day, and my son&#39;s natural <br/>
curiosity, eye for detail, incredible memory and interest and <br/>
growing  passion in the world around him are constant affirmations <br/>
this is the right path.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway! Enough about me. I have a question for you wise people. How <br/>
do you  explain to strangers around you, the concept of unschooling <br/>
in brief, not just as &#39;homeschooling&#39; but as a lifestyle? I have had <br/>
people in disbelief that I &#39;allow&#39; my son to play with his food, to <br/>
paint his body with waterpaints if he wants to, to watch tv whilst <br/>
eating his breakfast, and just other random life acts that he <br/>
chooses to do himself. I find it difficult, without launching into a <br/>
great spiel, explaining how we live and why it&#39;s important to me <br/>
that DS has autonomy. I find that feathers are really ruffled when I <br/>
don&#39;t &#39;pull my son up&#39;, and with our lack of rules and boundaries <br/>
that many other families seem to have. How in short, would I get the <br/>
message across about what unchooling is, and to leave people with a <br/>
positive understanding of it, not a negative (eg my kids run wild <br/>
and I don&#39;t do anything about it.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you had strangers ask you about your parenting practices or <br/>
ask &#39;what&#39;s unschooling&#39;, and if so, how do you answer without <br/>
seeming like you&#39;re fishing for debate?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks  in advance!<br/>
<br/>
Kerrie.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738679348">ahhh yes the concept of simple answers is truly amazing!  sandra is so right. i mean can you really argue with &quot;we are always learning&quot;! i usually add &quot;i know i learn something new everyday!&#39; i know i know yes there are people who can & will agrue,.,, LOL <br/>
<br/>
i never defend my parenting or schooling,in the traditional sense,my children &quot;speak&quot; for me. you will learn you either are confident or your not. so chose to be confident! yes worries will come, just check them at the door and move on. i get alot of people commenting on how respectful and smart my children are and then even asking me for advice!<br/>
<br/>
perspective. really the revelation is in HOW people look at things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681134448">Thank you both. You&#39;re so right. How do we answer any other question <br/>
when asked? With a simple answer. I don&#39;t know why I felt I somehow <br/>
had to launch into something long and detailed. I think I&#39;m feeling a <br/>
bit nervous because I know this decision isn&#39;t going to be very well-<br/>
received. And perhaps I am being a little defensive- wanting to be <br/>
able to justify why we&#39;re unschooling, and have plenty of verbal <br/>
ammunition on hand, should a  debate arise. What am I doing! This is <br/>
about the best, norman and natural way of learning for my son, not <br/>
being out to prove myself to others. I think I need to work on my <br/>
issues, as I don&#39;t think I&#39;m 100% confident yet. Thanks for helping me <br/>
identify that :)<br/>
<br/>
I do hope that some people show genuine interest and I&#39;m able to stir <br/>
some inspiration to look further into unschooling. I don&#39;t know any <br/>
unschoolers in real life, and would have loved to have discussed the <br/>
ideas with someone, especially when I was in highschool and sensed <br/>
deeply myself there was something so wrong about learning in a school. <br/>
I just couldn&#39;t articulate at that time, why education felt so forced <br/>
and unnatural.</div>

&gt; chooses to do himself. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it helpful to diffuse these sorts of situations with some <br/>
kind of positive statement about whatever my kid is doing, like &quot;I <br/>
love how creative s/he is!&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m amazed how independent s/he is!&quot; <br/>
or just a big pleased smile. I&#39;ve seen other adults relax when I do <br/>
that - as though their reaction was in some kind of anticipation of <br/>
*my* reaction.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would help to have an example. Are other parents making snarky <br/>
remarks or asking questions? Or just scowling? What kind of context? <br/>
For example, I&#39;m happy with my dd jumping on the furniture at home, <br/>
but if she wants to do that in someone else&#39;s house, I&#39;m going to <br/>
check with that person and help Mo find something else to do if <br/>
that&#39;s not okay. Another example is food - my gf has a house rule <br/>
that &quot;food stays in the kitchen&quot; so I remind Mo of that rule when <br/>
we&#39;re over there, and suggest eating outside or in our car as <br/>
alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you had strangers ask you about your parenting practices<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had parents ask about my &quot;discipline&quot; practices, and I tell <br/>
those parents I would like all &quot;disciplinary&quot; issues referred to me. <br/>
I live in a very pro-spanking area, so that&#39;s pretty important. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you had strangers... <br/>
&gt; ask &#39;what&#39;s unschooling&#39;, and if so, how do you answer without <br/>
&gt; seeming like you&#39;re fishing for debate?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t mention the word unschooling unless I&#39;m talking to another <br/>
homeschooler - and even then only if the issues of curriculum or <br/>
teaching methods come up. Mostly I say things like &quot;my kids are very <br/>
independent learners&quot;. <br/>

Yes.  Sometimes it&#39;s good to give a tricksy answer and look at them  <br/>

When they get feisty, I say &quot;I have some things you can read if you  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453078740">Hi, Kerrie<br/>
<br/>
I have a 21 year old daughter who&#39;s currently in her final year at <br/>
the University of Canberra and an 11 year old son who went to school <br/>
for two years but has been at home with me for the past five.<br/>
<br/>
I describe my son as &#39;self-educated under my supervision&#39;. I think if <br/>
you tell people your child is unschooled, they will probably assume <br/>
that you mean uneducated and everything the idea implies. Self-<br/>
educated has different connotations. The conclusions people jump to <br/>
are different.<br/>
<br/>
The semantics can be tricky sometimes. Especially when there are so <br/>
many parents who erroneously believe that children have to be <br/>
&#39;taught&#39; everything (even when they can see with their own eyes that <br/>
it isn&#39;t true!).<br/>
<br/>
So, what does my self-educated son do all day? Whatever he likes. No <br/>
difference there.<br/>
<br/>
But, the fact is, people rarely ask me about this. None of my <br/>
relatives have ever commented on my son&#39;s unusual lifestyle. My <br/>
wife&#39;s mother, in fact, who&#39;s 86 and living with us now, is all for <br/>
it - she gets to see the benefits every day. If a stranger, or the <br/>
parent of one of my son&#39;s former schoolmates, should ask, they <br/>
invariably assume that I&#39;m doing school at home, so they&#39;ll <br/>
ask &quot;How&#39;s the homeschooling going?&quot; &quot;Yeah, great. I&#39;m very pleased <br/>
with Pat&#39;s progress.&quot; End of conversation.<br/>
<br/>
I also keep a copy of Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s book &#39;If You Want to Be Rich <br/>
and Happy, Don&#39;t Go to School&#39; handy - &quot;By the way, have you read <br/>
this book? It&#39;s most enlightening.&quot; - but I haven&#39;t had to use that <br/>
tactic so far.<br/>
<br/>
It can be useful to remind people that the institutional school <br/>
system takes up only about 150-200 years of humanity&#39;s long history, <br/>
it was designed to suit the needs of the Industrial Revolution and <br/>
the Digital Revolution that&#39;s now replaced it has changed all the <br/>
rules about everything.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, even when my daughter was thriving in the school system, <br/>
I would tell her that going to school was only part of her education <br/>
and not necessarily the most important part. That&#39;s what I truly <br/>
believe.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was always amongst what Robert Kiyosaki calls <br/>
the &#39;favoured five per cent&#39; - those students whose achievements <br/>
reflect well on the school and who are consequently treated <br/>
favourably in ways that average students and below are not. That was <br/>
a crucial aspect of her experience and not unrelated to how she was <br/>
treated before she started school and outside of school during her <br/>
school years.<br/>
<br/>
So, really, my son&#39;s lifestyle is no different to the lifestyle his <br/>
sister has always enjoyed when she&#39;s at home. Do what you like and <br/>
don&#39;t do what you don&#39;t like. If it&#39;s good enough for me, it&#39;s good <br/>
enough for my children. :) <br/>
<br/>
The important thing is to be convinced yourself of the value of what <br/>
you&#39;re doing. That&#39;s not easy in the beginning, when you&#39;re <br/>
deschooling yourself, but it comes from observing the results, as <br/>
you&#39;re doing. When you&#39;re getting results people can&#39;t argue with, <br/>
they won&#39;t argue with your results. When you&#39;re certain that what <br/>
you&#39;re doing is right, you project that into situations and other <br/>
people think twice about voicing negative opinions.<br/>
<br/>
But there will always be people, I guess, who will look for things to <br/>
criticise in order to rationalise their own decisions about their own <br/>
children. Perhaps they&#39;re secretly hoping and praying that what we&#39;re <br/>
doing couldn&#39;t possibly be better than sending our children to <br/>
school. Unfortunately for them, it is. :)<br/>
