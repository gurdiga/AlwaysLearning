<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860826734">Just wanted to express my appreciation for the generous responses to my first post where I used the term &quot;de-fooding.&quot;  I am reading my way along the thread slowly as I&#39;m not online as much as I&#39;d like to be.  Happy to find so much to work with and wanted folks to know that I am listening!</div>
