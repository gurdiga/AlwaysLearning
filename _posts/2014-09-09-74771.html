<div id="ygrps-yiv-652219725"><html>I clicked on a blog called &quot;unprocessed people&quot; that came across my facebook feed. &nbsp;I was curious.<br><br>It&#39;s more political activism and vegan recipes than parenting. &nbsp;I&#39;m bringing it as an example of some things to consider avoiding.<br><br>-=-I’m not the type of parent who makes a different meal for each of her finicky children. H – no. So yes, to an&nbsp;extent, our&nbsp;children eat whatever I make.&nbsp;-=-<br><br>She was building up to saying that when they&#39;re home they eat what she gives them, but when they&#39;re out elsewhere, they&nbsp;can&nbsp;eat what&#39;s served or available.<br><br>-=-As&nbsp;nutritarian,&nbsp;plant strong, vegan, WFPB (whole foods plat based), non GMO,&nbsp;juicing&nbsp;andblending&nbsp;enthusiasts/evangelists-=-<br><br>Some of you might be interested in it for the recipes.<br><br>What it showed me is how far I&#39;ve come from &quot;Parents are REAL&quot; and kids are future adults.<br><br>&quot;Unprocessed kids&quot; was about diet, not about whether the children are themselves &quot;being processed.&quot; &nbsp;At first I guess I&nbsp;had associated it with&nbsp;Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s&nbsp;book&nbsp;<i>The Unprocessed Child: Living Without School.</i><br><br>______________quote:__________<br>Having a house full of rambunctious children can really wear on my patience sometimes. Often I feel like I spend&nbsp;my life as a&nbsp;full-time referee. With two boys who are the same age, fighting just comes with the territory I&nbsp;suppose.<br><br>We really limit the time our children are allowed to watch television and play video games.&nbsp;-=-<br><br><br>_________Sandra:__________<br><br>I found that passage while looking to see whether their children were in school or homeschooled.&nbsp; The question wasn&#39;t&nbsp;addressed.<br><br>Maybe they wouldn&#39;t live in a territory where fighting is normal or accepted if they were allowed to watch TV and play video&nbsp;games more.<br><br>But it&#39;s more than that. &nbsp;The mom is making decisions based on trying to make sure her children change the world.<br><br>____________quote:_________<br><br>&nbsp;We can’t have a world filled with compassionate and caring adults if we don’t take the time to instill those&nbsp;qualities in our&nbsp;children. The shows played on television these days won’t do it for you.<br><br>Every person who comes across my children now and when they’re grown will be effected by them in some way.&nbsp;I want to live&nbsp;in a different world than the one we do now. I want people to care about everyone. To love all&nbsp;people and all creatures. I can’t&nbsp;change the world but I can raise up three people who will want to change the&nbsp;world as well and so can you..<br><br>______________________Sandra_____________<br><br>I wonder if her children might not have the same kind of guilt gifted children are &quot;gifted&quot; with—if they fail to change the world&nbsp;to their mother&#39;s specifications.<br><br>Earlier in that same post she talked about giving them a soup, for dinner, that one of the children doesn&#39;t like.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>________________________quote:__________<br><br>When my son brought his bowl over to me once finished I said thank you for not complaining about dinner, that I&nbsp;really&nbsp;appreciated it. He replied, “I really can’t complain about not liking my dinner when some kids have no&nbsp;place to sleep and no&nbsp;dinner to eat.”<br><br>Wow. That warms me up right to the core. These moments are the ones I live for.<br><br>_______________________Sandra_________<br><br>Maybe he could have food he likes. &nbsp;Perhaps THAT would be an example of compassion, on the mom&#39;s behalf.<br>It sounds like her heart was warmed because her manipulation of his emotions is paying off.<br><br>_____________quote:_________________<br><br>(Name, name, name of children)&nbsp;here is my hope for you: Don’t settle for anything less than changing the world. For&nbsp;whatever you believe. Don’t hang up your beliefs on the shelf because they make you different. Be the change&nbsp;I’ve always wanted to see in the world. Be the voice for those who can’t make the change themselves.<br><br>__________________Sandra______________<br>-=-Be the change I’ve always wanted to see in the world.-=-<br>That seems way beyond the pressure some of us have seen or known to do something one of our parents was&nbsp;unable to do but Really WANTED: &nbsp;professional sports, astronautics, ballet, Olympic skiing...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Living vicariously through one&#39;s children is to make them an extension of the parent in an unhealthy way, in a&nbsp;way that doesn&#39;t see them as separate people with their own skills, desires, aversions, hopes.<br><br>So anyway...<br>It surprised me that &quot;unprocessed&quot; didn&#39;t extend to compassion for the children, or really seeing them as people&nbsp;who might want to play more video games, fight less, or NOT be missionaries for their mom&#39;s political visions.<br><br>I have said before that unschooling will change the world, will make the world a better place, but what I meant&nbsp;was there will be more people who know learning doesn&#39;t need schooling, and more people who didn&#39;t grow up&nbsp;with shame and punishments—people who are likely to be good, peaceful, interesting partners and friends and&nbsp;parents someday.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This is interesting (quoting again):&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-=-Every person who comes across my children now and when they’re grown will be effected by them in some way.&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in a different world than the one we do now. I want people to care about everyone. To love all&nbsp;people and all creatures. I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;change the world but I can raise up three people who will want to change the&nbsp;world as well and so can you..-=-<br><br>&quot;Affected&quot; she meant.<br>I don&#39;t think every person who comes across my children are affected in some way. &nbsp;Some are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>-=-I want to live&nbsp;in a different world than the one we do now....&nbsp;I can’t&nbsp;change the world but...-=-<br><br>Why does she think her children can (or should want to) if she can&#39;t?<br><br>Anyway...<br>This is the kind of activism-above-children I&#39;ve cautioned people about sometimes. &nbsp;If &quot;the cause&quot; is big on the horizon and&nbsp;the children need to live in the shadow of that, parenting isn&#39;t as rich or as direct as it could be.<br><br>The same blogger wrote &quot;It’s so important to remember that our children become some version of who we are as&nbsp;people. Be someone worthy of being emulated.&quot; but she goes on then about teaching them, fighting for things,&nbsp;persecution. &nbsp;Politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Sandra<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div></html></div>
