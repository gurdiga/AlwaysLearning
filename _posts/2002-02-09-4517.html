<div id="ygrps-yiv-97295586">Thank goodness.. I thought I was the only one with a child that sheds his<br/>
clothes the moment his feet hit our house.  Because of the prudishness of<br/>
many Americans that I run into I was worried last summer about getting my<br/>
films developed.  Most of them were of the kids doing things naked in the<br/>
back garden, such as building sandcastles, painting on the walls, climbing<br/>
on the playset, running through the water and in the house there Zak was<br/>
naked building legos, playing on his computer.  Max also kept trying to take<br/>
of his diaper and would sometimes do that.  Some of my friends think it&#39;s<br/>
odd that he doesn&#39;t put clothes on.  I don&#39;t.  He puts them on when he goes<br/>
to play soccer or go to Karate or a playdate.  I don&#39;t have to force him to<br/>
do that... But when he&#39;s home he loves to be naked... and I thought this was<br/>
a Virgo thing (LOL).<br/>
