<div id="ygrps-yiv-749836520">Hi everyone, I&#39;m looking for Internet resources for things to do with<br/>
my two year old - arts, crafts, ideas for nature etc. Can I get<br/>
spammed with a bunch of resources?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone in here in South Florida by the way?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to use the internet for craft resources, now, I find it much more<br/>
fun to go to a craft store and get whatever looks like it might be<br/>
interesting or fun.<br/>
<br/>
A few months back we got a whole bunch of pipe cleaner things of all<br/>
sizes (the huge ones are especially fun, even for older kids).  We got<br/>
them for Marguax specifically, nobody else.  She spent weeks playing<br/>
with those things, she still has a few piles of unused ones and used<br/>
ones that get pulled out and shaped and reshaped.  It was about $15<br/>
worth of pipe cleaner stuff that&#39;s lasted for months and months.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best resources we&#39;ve used throughout the years is a recipe<br/>
book of messy stuff, perfect for a 2 yro.  The Ultimate Book of Kid<br/>
Concoctions<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Book-Kid-Concoctions-Wacky/dp/0966108809&#92;">http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Book-Kid-Concoctions-Wacky/dp/0966108809&#92;</a><br/>
/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1226206580&sr=1-1&gt;  It&#39;s not an internet<br/>
resource, but we&#39;ve used it for crafty stuff more than any other crafty<br/>
book we have!  It&#39;s not stuff you make and keep, it&#39;s tangible, and<br/>
edible, or usable and disposable, which I prefer!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310928221">These were written for Montana in the winter, but some would still work:<br/>

<br/>
Some wouldn&#39;t be fun or safe for a two year old but others would work  <br/>
fine!<br/>
