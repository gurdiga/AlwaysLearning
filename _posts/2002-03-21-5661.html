<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017056892">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This week I am  again wondering am I alright. Did I make the right choice by <br/>
letting my kids stay home. We are simply stuck inside with the TV and <br/>
computer on making me feel our time is whirling away. Then at swim practice <br/>
yesterday I had a caretaker sit down behind me and argue for along time with <br/>
a little boy. He was probably 8. Sobbing away working on work sheets. The <br/>
caregiver kept erasing his work, he sobbed not to. She simply did not <br/>
respect anything he said. In the end the caregiver said &quot; Why are you being <br/>
so mean to me?&quot; Who was mean to who? Poor boy, I wish I could have hugged <br/>
him. This same caregiver also said, &quot;see I told you it was wrong&quot;. She got <br/>
enjoyment from his incorrect answers.<br/>
<br/>
I�m not worrying anymore. My kids are staying home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would of stuck my oar in. I really cannot stand watching adults using their<br/>
power over kids like this so I always say something. Even if it does not work<br/>
the child will realise, probably for the first time in his/her life, that he/she<br/>
is worth sticking up for and that not all adults are mean. It might just plant a<br/>
little seed of selfesteem in a child.<br/>
Quite often I&#39;ve helped the adult too who did not know how to relate to people<br/>
or was stressed.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, my mouth often jumps in before my brain is engaged.<br/>
