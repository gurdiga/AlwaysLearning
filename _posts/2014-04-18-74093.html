<div id="ygrps-yiv-531319728">Today, a neighbor girl (J, 8 years old), told my 8 and 5 year olds that she had a secret.&nbsp; I happened to walk outside right as she was telling my 5 year old &quot;[Boy] and I are going to have sex.&quot;&nbsp; Without thinking my first reaction was &quot;Whoa!&quot;, but I immediately took a deep breath, sat down, and calmly asked J &quot;So, what do you think that means?&quot;&nbsp; <br><br>She said she didn&#39;t know, but that she loved this boy so she was going to have sex with him.&nbsp; I asked where she had heard that idea, and she said another neighbor (who is 5) told her that because she loves this boy, they should have sex.&nbsp; My 8 year old said, &quot;Mom, I was going to tell you!&quot; and J said &quot;I told you it was a secret!&quot;&nbsp; I told them both that some secrets are fun, but some things are important to tell a grown up and that I was glad my daughter was planning on telling me.<br><br>I know J&#39;s mom a bit, so when she came over a few minutes later, I told her about the conversation, in a &quot;Just thought you should have a heads up about what your daughter is talking about,&quot; kind of way.&nbsp; She said that J doesn&#39;t really know anything beyond &quot;when mommy and daddy love each other, 9 months later a baby comes,&quot; <br><br>So, my kids both know way more than J, because we&#39;ve discussed the whole biological process.&nbsp; Not in great detail, but in a factual, anatomically correct way as their questions have come up.&nbsp; I told them that J&#39;s mom should be the one to tell her though.&nbsp; <br><br>I don&#39;t know how/if to approach the 5 year old girl, K, who told J that she should have sex with this boy.&nbsp; I hardly know her, and it&#39;s not an in-the-moment conversation like it was with J, so it seems highly inappropriate to just bring it up.&nbsp; However, I also don&#39;t know her mom, so I&#39;m hesitant to go meet her for the first time and then maybe get her in trouble or who knows what.&nbsp; I have no way of knowing how her mom will react.&nbsp; <br><br>But I&#39;d like to know if this girl just has knowledge of the biological facts, like my kids do, or if something more is going on in her life that I need to be cautious about exposing my kids to, because she IS telling other kids &quot;if you love that boy you should have sex with him!&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>So, I&#39;m not even sure what my question is, I&#39;m just hoping to get some feedback and perspective on the whole situation.&nbsp; For the most part, I feel like I have a pretty good handle on talking to my kids about sex.&nbsp; We&#39;ve been open, casual, factual, and non-shaming.&nbsp; But I have no idea how to handle other kids talking to my kids about sex, especially wanting them to keep those conversations a secret, and my 8 year old thinking about her 8 year old friends having sex, etc.&nbsp;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010259739">I would say that sex is for grownups, for grownup bodies, not for little children.  Not said in such a way that they want to try it out to play grownups, but in a way that says it&#39;s a natural thing for grown people, and not a good thing for children to even play with or talk about playing with.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, personally, I would say that secrets should be about birthday gifts or happy surprises, not about sneaky, bad things.  They don&#39;t need to agree to keep secrets for other kids.  It can be dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t need biological information.  More like legal information, cultural information, maybe.<br/>
