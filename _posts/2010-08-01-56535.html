<br/>
It&#39;s not into, but anything &quot;on&quot; a stick is dish free, kabobs, smoothie <br/>
popsicles, hot dogs or corn dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Bread bowls count though as &quot;into&quot;.  I make a breakfast tortilla thing, where I <br/>
drop an egg into the fry pan, then after the white turns a bit white, I smash a <br/>
tortilla onto it, usually a corn one because it&#39;s about the perfect size.  When <br/>
it&#39;s about done, I flip it over to cook the tortilla a bit and then it can be <br/>
folded and eaten.  I guess you could add things in it too, like cheese or salsa, <br/>
but I usually don&#39;t because it&#39;s the simplicity that I like about it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
need to scramble it or use any other utensil other than a spatula.  I keep in on <br/>
the spatula until it&#39;s cool enough to touch and I do ALL of it because it <br/>
requires zero dishes.  The pan and the spatula are generally clean enough to <br/>
wipe and then be done.<br/>
<br/>
Pita pocket bread is great too!<br/>

Lately we&#39;ve been taking a romain lettuce leaf and rolling slicked  <br/>
turkey, cheese and sprouts, etc. up in the lettuce leaf to eat - -=-<br/>
<br/>
We use lettuce leaves sometimes for egg salad or tuna salad.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody mentioned crackers (other than graham crackers).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of out of style, but saltines or other savory crackers with  <br/>
a spread, or tuna salad, or some such used to be standard for kid food.<br/>
<br/>
If you take a head of iceberg lettuce, hold it with the base away from  <br/>
your hand and slam it on the counter (you&#39;ll figure out how hard is  <br/>
hard enough; fairly hard), the stem will come away from the rest of  <br/>
it.  If you take the outside leaves off carefully, you&#39;ll have big  <br/>
bowls.  I used to work at a restaurant where the best of the bowls  <br/>
went under salads.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was a great struggle in California with labor unions and  <br/>
lettuce, and iceberg lettuce was declared not to have been any damned  <br/>
good for anyone anyway; no vitamins.   And so it was an effective sort  <br/>
of boycott that went on for years, and other kinds of lettuce were  <br/>
declared &quot;lettuce&quot; and iceberg was declared to be taste-free and low  <br/>
class.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of months ago, so 35 years or so after the initial  <br/>
character assassination of iceberg lettuce, I saw a little article  <br/>
somewhere that say &quot;Hey!  Iceberg lettuce IS good for people!&quot;  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t even bother to read it; just figured the author must have been  <br/>
born in the late 1970&#39;s or later.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We use lettuce leaves sometimes for egg salad or tuna salad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nobody mentioned crackers (other than graham crackers).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s kind of out of style, but saltines or other savory crackers with<br/>
&gt; a spread, or tuna salad, or some such used to be standard for kid food.<br/>
&gt; -----------------------------------------<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My children like crackers or breadsticks or pitta bread and a tub of hummous<br/>
or cream cheese to dip them in, or sometimes fishpaste (which might be just<br/>
a British thing, I&#39;m not sure). Or cream crackers with cheese like Wallace<br/>
and Gromit.<br/>
<br/>
They also love raw green beans and Mange Tout, which we buy ready trimmed<br/>
and they eat straight from the packet.<br/>
<br/>
Cornish Pasties are a good fridge standard, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We use romaine for tacos quite a bit in the same manner. <br/>
Tacos / taco salad = edible dishes.<br/>
Pot pies -- make them in muffin tins and they become finger foods (bonus if you make fruit pies in the muffin tin for desert at the same time) =)<br/>
Nori rolls<br/>
Collard green wraps<br/>
Fruit salad can be served in the watermelon shell (not exactly edible but no bowl to wash)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274243317">Banana Boats<br/>
<br/>
Slice unpeeled banana lengthwise, not all the way through.  Stuff the <br/>
banana with some chocolate chips and miniature marshmallows and then <br/>
wrap some foil around it and bake for about 5 minutes on a campfire, <br/>
barbeque, or in 300 degree oven.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you can eat the entire banana, so it doesn&#39;t entirely qualify <br/>
for &quot;You can even eat the dishes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another one like this is &quot;Cake in an Orange.&quot; You slice of the top of <br/>
some oranges and scoop them out. Mix up a spice or chocolate cake mix <br/>
and fill the organes about half full. Put the tops back on and wrap in <br/>
some foil and bake on campfire, barbeque, or in 350 degree oven for <br/>
about 20 minutes. People can eat the fruit out of the orange with a <br/>
spoon, first, then fill the orange with the cake mix and bake. Or use <br/>
the scooped out fruit for fruit salad.</div>

&gt; Squash flowers!<br/>
&gt; You can make a &quot;fairy feast&quot; with all edible leaf and flower plates if you know what&#39;s what in the garden. <br/>
&gt; For dainty apetites, violets and pansies are edible and make tiny little plates - flowers and leaves, too. Rose petals, too. Daylilies can make little cups or bowls. Nasturtium flowers and leaves are edible but peppery. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lots of weeds are also edible - check what&#39;s good locally. <br/>
