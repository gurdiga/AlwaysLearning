<br/>
One thing I have been wondering about/worrying about/battling others about is the topic of college.  I do not by any means think it is necessary but I do want the option easily at hand if that is the choice my children make..  Does anyone have any story to share of how they unschooled and their child was still able to go to college?  I am not sure what to say when people ask this and then it gets me worrying that it will be a very tough endeavor.  I want every door open for them!  Thanks in advance<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674466731">mary...oh your post came at the PERFECT time. my mother has been making such ignorant comments about unschooling (even though i&#39;ve explained to her and tried to edumacate her many a time in the past 6 years...)& actually its a good good thing...the past few days she has asked me a few questions...<br/>
<br/>
so one of her latest questions is &#39;what about college? how do unschoolers go on to college if they want to?. my answer was if they got a GED or went to H.S. as a teen and graduated w/ a diploma. these are the only 2 ways...or am i incorrect???<br/>
<br/>
thank you for this topic!<br/>
<br/>
oh and quickly...i just rejoined this group after being away a few years... i am solo parenting my daughter, 6.5yo and my son, 17mo. and i live in oregon. <br/>

<br/>
I live in England so what I have to say might not answer your question but I<br/>
know this is an international school so I&#39;ll say it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest sister graduated last November with a first-class degree in<br/>
Midwifery from a university in England. She wasn&#39;t unschooled but was<br/>
home-schooled very informally and didn&#39;t take any school exams. When she<br/>
decided on midwifery in her early twenties she was able to take a one-year<br/>
course at an adult education college which was all the qualification she<br/>
needed to start her degree.<br/>
<br/>
She was top of her year all the way through and was also elected student rep<br/>
for her year, so her lack of formal education and peer group socialisation<br/>
didn&#39;t exactly hold her back at all.<br/>
<br/>
In the UK there are several ways to get into university without academic<br/>
qualifications, especially as a &#39;mature&#39; student - and there&#39;s the Open<br/>
University, which has very inclusive entry requirements, if you want a<br/>
degree but don&#39;t want to attend a regular college. I expect most countries<br/>
have something equivalent to the OU?<br/>

oldest child is 10 years old. Seriously.<br/>

are either graduated or in college now.<br/>

Roya is 24, radically unschooled since she was 10 years old,  she <br/>
graduated with a BA degree in Recreation and Leisure Studies. In <br/>
college, she won a bunch of merit-based scholarships and the outstanding <br/>
graduating senior of the year award. She is now the coordinator of a <br/>
program called &quot;Access to Adventure&quot; - she plans and carries out <br/>
excursions and activities for adults with developmental and other <br/>
disabilities. She also does fundraising and hires and supervises student <br/>
interns. Here is their website <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://proindependence.org/our_programs_access.htm">http://proindependence.org/our_programs_access.htm</a>&gt; which I believe she <br/>
also created.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana (21) is going to the University of California, Irvine, in the <br/>
fall as a Junior. She&#39;s probably going to have a double major in drama <br/>
and comparative literature. She&#39;s an honors student and she spent a <br/>
semester studying in Paris, France, last year.<br/>
<br/>
Rose is 18 and always radically unschooled. She has taken college <br/>
courses and gotten good grades at the local community college and is now <br/>
working toward an ASL interpreter license plus fulfilling the general <br/>
education requirements to transfer to a university and major in Deaf <br/>
Studies.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps - please don&#39;t feel you have to prepare kids for <br/>
college. The best preperation is a full life with lots of experiences.<br/>

our H.S. diplomas..-=-<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t check mine, but they got a transcript sent from the high  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who didn&#39;t go to high school might do better to say &quot;I don&#39;t have  <br/>
a transcript because I didn&#39;t go to school,&quot; and provide a list of  <br/>
cool things they did instead.<br/>
<br/>
If a university really truly has no flexible alternative to a  <br/>
transcript, I&#39;d be willing to create one but I wouldn&#39;t begin to  <br/>
falsify anything for it.   If my kids wanted one of those they could  <br/>
get someone else to make one.  But I&#39;ve known of lots of kids who went  <br/>
to college saying &quot;I didn&#39;t go to high school at all, and now I&#39;d like  <br/>
to go to college.&quot;<br/>

the last year+ with our Community College. When he wanted to take a  <br/>
writing course we spoke with an adviser, he took a placement exam, and  <br/>
off he went! The fact that he&#39;d never attended high school was a non- <br/>
issue.  He&#39;s taken literature, history and philosophy courses since  <br/>
then and plans to take more next year and then possibly transfer as a  <br/>
Sophomore into a 4-year college after that.  Some of his formerly  <br/>
homeschooled then high-schooled friends are having graduation parties  <br/>
and ceremonies in the next few weeks but those kinds of milestone  <br/>
marking events seem inconsequential to him  when he&#39;s been working and  <br/>
earning college credit for awhile now.<br/>

<br/>
You said you don&#39;t know what to say when other people ask about college <br/>
and unschooling. What we were giving you was something simple and clear <br/>
to say. You can now say that you know of unschooled kids who have <br/>
graduated from college or are now in college and, in fact, they are <br/>
doing very well.<br/>
<br/>
  I know a lot of unschooled kids who have gone to college - each has <br/>
done it in their own way. Some took college entrance exams and did so <br/>
well that they were accepted and even given scholarships based on test <br/>
scores. Some created portfolios or narrative transcripts and were able <br/>
to get interviews and were accepted on that basis. Some applied to <br/>
schools that are looking particularly for nontraditional students. Some <br/>
went to community colleges to get a college transcript and used that in <br/>
their transfer application. Some took extension courses at the college <br/>
and then applied with that as their transcript.<br/>

Well, you probably can&#39;t have that. But you couldn&#39;t have that if you sent <br/>
them to the best private school in the country, either, so it&#39;s not an <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764664530">Hi, I am new here but not new to homeschooling/unschooling. (My son is going<br/>
to be 9 and because we started out in a conventional school environment, we<br/>
have done _a lot_ of reading/comparing/arguing/discussing/active involvement<br/>
in educational alternatives.)<br/>
<br/>
We have a young friend who was unschooled all of her life who now, at 17,<br/>
has been accepted to three good colleges - one of them an Ivy League school.<br/>
(Today is her deadline to pick a school!) She was never forced to &quot;do school<br/>
work&quot;  by her parents, I think they might have asked her to do some math<br/>
every now and then but she&#39;s probably the most &quot;unschooled&quot; kid I&#39;ve met.<br/>
Still, once she was of high school age, she enrolled in a cyber charter<br/>
school for a year or two. Through them, she started taking college classes<br/>
at the local community college and is now on her way into the world of<br/>
academics, with a great attitude and a healthy desire to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Compare this to the daughter of another friend of mine: 16 years old, in a<br/>
catholic high school where they&#39;ve been having SAT-practice classes on<br/>
Saturdays for many weeks now, where she took a Math test _last year_, and it<br/>
was clear based on her good but not excellent scores that she would not make<br/>
it to a &quot;good school&quot;. (!?!?!?! )<br/>
<br/>
 She will not even apply to an Ivy League school because &quot;she wouldn&#39;t get<br/>
in anyway&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This is a smart kid who does her homework, and likes school. And already at<br/>
16 she&#39;s told that she shouldn&#39;t &quot;reach for the stars&quot; (if you know what i<br/>
mean...)<br/>
<br/>
Pretty scary, huh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160006582">-=-.  I wasn&#39;t really looking for how children do IN school as I am  <br/>
sure all our children would be capable (a previous post sounded a bit  <br/>
like a resume, lol).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t laugh at people&#39;s freely offered posts.<br/>
If you ask for information and it is provided generously the same day  <br/>
you asked, be grateful, not critical.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I wanted to have something to say to naysayers and also was  <br/>
curious about the ease of it all for the children that choose this  <br/>
path.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The ease of it&quot; has a great deal to do with how unschoolers do when  <br/>
they get in there, and so a statement like &quot;I am sure all our children  <br/>
would be capable&quot; is not very useful.   Each unschooler who does well  <br/>
in college makes it easier for admissions officers to feel good about  <br/>
considering another one.<br/>

Seriously, be nice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>College is fine for folks who want to go.  But the idea that it<br/>
is the only path to success is wrong.  There are lots of jobs<br/>
that don&#39;t need college degrees.  Search the web using &quot;best<br/>
jobs no college degree&quot; and you will see a variety of interesting,<br/>
and many high paying jobs.  (Not that *I* believe success is<br/>
measured by a high salary, but if you are speaking to folks<br/>
who do believe that, perhaps they&#39;d be reassured that you can<br/>
earn oodles without a college degree.)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I look at is how many of my friends went to<br/>
college, and then didn&#39;t use the degree.  Or, their career took<br/>
off on a tangent.  My husband studied management in college.<br/>
He did a lot of computer programming in his free time, for fun.<br/>
His brother studied computer programming in college.  Now,<br/>
guess which brother is the manager, and which brother does A<br/>
LOT of computer programming in his work?  Yeah, my husband<br/>
writes a lot of programs to help him do his research--he&#39;s<br/>
a professor--and my brother-in-law is the manager.<br/>
<br/>
I know a guy who took 10 years to get his Ph.D.  That&#39;s<br/>
not ten years from high school graduation.  That&#39;s ten<br/>
years after completing four years of undergraduate studies<br/>
and I don&#39;t know how many years earning a Master&#39;s degree.<br/>
He earned a Ph.D. in physics, then went to Hollywood and<br/>
became a successful writer of screenplays.  Now, his degree<br/>
was tangental to his career; he started out as a science consultant<br/>
for a popular sci-fi show, and worked his way up from there.<br/>
<br/>
I also know a lot of folks who learned their jobs by doing them,<br/>
then went back for degrees because the institutions for which<br/>
they work require the degree for promotion.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I would really urge you to try to release your worries<br/>
about college.  You kids will certainly pick up on those anxieties,<br/>
and that won&#39;t do any of you any good.<br/>

In the U.S. you individual rights are largely contingent upon your income. Poor people have essentially no rights. If they lack a permanent address they cannot open a bank account, get a credit card, obtain a mortgage. If their income is low, they might not have health insurance, and they might not be able to afford a lawyer to defend them in a court of law.<br/>
<br/>
Your ability to earn money is connected to your college education, your personal contacts, your skills ... All of these things are important.<br/>
<br/>
Now this doesn&#39;t mean a person needs to be making 500k to be happy and have rights. A person can live on a modest income as long as he or she has very little (or no) debt. Debt limits our freedoms, and makes us slaves to the lender. <br/>

  i worked with many college graduates, many from &quot;upper class&quot; and &quot;middle class&quot; families, etc., and in some cases, for those who did not go to college, the mental illness or addiction were the barrier to that as well.  anything we can do as parents to improve our kids&#39; general optimism/hope/happiness/contentedness and mental health is going to go a lot further toward preventing addiciton or mental illness, which will in turn mean a much more hopeful future than that of those who go to college but are depressed, anxious, and alcholic/addicted.<br/>

Holly has a boyfriend whose sister just got her medical license  <br/>
reinstated, after in patient therapy in Kansas.  Her residency was in  <br/>
Oregon, but they won&#39;t take her back because she&#39;s troublesome, and  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t falsify a report.  (Even if that was her only problem, she&#39;s  <br/>
still troublesome.)   The reason her license was revoked is that she  <br/>
prescribed something strong to someone who wasn&#39;t her patient (her  <br/>
boyfriend) and then downed it all to try to kill herself.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t want to be a doctor, but her parents assured her (from  <br/>
birth, apparently, as they have Brett) that it&#39;s the only way to  be  <br/>
happy, or at least the only way for the parents to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the parents are happy.  I know his sister isn&#39;t happy.    <br/>
And she&#39;s in debt a few thousand dollars, too.   She could&#39;ve bought a  <br/>
house with that money and be working in a fast food place and smiling  <br/>
every day she woke up.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When unschoolers respond to such conventional thinking, the message  <br/>
that gets heard is that unschoolers think college is unimportant.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, what should be heard is: rethink what you&#39;ve been fed. The  <br/>
words you&#39;ve written are so entrenched in most people&#39;s minds as to  <br/>
go unquestioned.<br/>
<br/>
Those who deliberately choose not to go to college because they have  <br/>
other plans are in a separate category from those who can&#39;t go to  <br/>
college or refuse to subject themselves to 4 more years of school.  <br/>
But statistics on median income lump them together. It would be like  <br/>
using high school drop outs as a way to measure the potential success  <br/>
of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Most college graduates enter the work force in huge debt. Which, as  <br/>
you say: &quot;A person can live on a modest income as long as he or she  <br/>
has very little (or no) debt. Debt limits our freedoms, and makes us  <br/>
slaves to the lender.&quot; Debt also makes us slaves to our jobs. College  <br/>
graduates have to get good paying jobs to pay off their debts. And to  <br/>
keep a good paying job one generally settles down and buys a house,  <br/>
adding to the debt and tying one down further.<br/>
<br/>
If you think outside the corporate world and middle class America,  <br/>
think outside the standard track, there are far more opportunities  <br/>
for jobs than most people think. Most people see the standard track  <br/>
and if they aren&#39;t on it, they feel like they&#39;re stuck in low paying  <br/>
jobs. Just as many people feel like they&#39;ve limited their future by  <br/>
dropping out of high school. But those who feel they&#39;ve freed  <br/>
themselves from chains that were holding them back are far more  <br/>
likely to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
When college is seen as another way to explore what you&#39;re interested  <br/>
in, rather than a bunch of expensive hoops to jump through to a good  <br/>
paying job, it&#39;s even more valuable. But even better for some is the  <br/>
freedom to explore life beyond home on their own. It costs way less  <br/>
than a year of college for a kid to explore Europe on the cheap. And  <br/>
they&#39;ll be picking up way more than they would from some overpriced  <br/>
textbooks ;-) They can spend four or more years after their &quot;high  <br/>
school years&quot; exploring all sorts of jobs, learning on the job --  <br/>
while they get paid for it! And no reason they can&#39;t then go onto  <br/>
college if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
Most parents fear that if their kids don&#39;t go directly from high  <br/>
school to college that they won&#39;t. It&#39;s not unreasonable. After 12  <br/>
years, kids are burned out on school. It can take *years* to recover  <br/>
from that. And few will be willing to jump back into what they have  <br/>
such poor memories of.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t get in the way of anyone going to college.  <br/>
Unschooling provides a pathway for kids to show who they really are  <br/>
and explore what their interested in rather than generate a bunch of  <br/>
letters next to hoops.<br/>
<br/>
A good book on the opportunities besides college is The Uncollege  <br/>
Alternative.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617580562"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the U.S. you individual rights are largely contingent upon your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>income. Poor people have essentially no rights. If they lack a permanent<br/>
address they cannot open a bank account, get a credit card, obtain a<br/>
mortgage. If their income is low, they might not have health insurance,<br/>
and they might not be able to afford a lawyer to defend them in a court<br/>
of law.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because someone doesn&#39;t go to college, doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t have<br/>
health insurance or a house or bank account, or even afford to hire a<br/>
lawyer.  Just because a person goes to college, doesn&#39;t mean they will<br/>
have a bank account or health insurance or a house, etc.  That&#39;s a huge<br/>
either or statement you are making about going to college.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Your ability to earn money is connected to your college education,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your personal contacts, your skills ... All of these things are<br/>
important.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely disagree with this statement!  Why connect personal<br/>
contacts and skills with college education?  Sure sometimes those things<br/>
interconnect, but certainly not always, and I would even wager that<br/>
personal contacts and skills are far more important than a piece of<br/>
paper from a college, for most careers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Now this doesn&#39;t mean a person needs to be making 500k to be happy<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and have rights. A person can live on a modest income as long as he or<br/>
she has very little (or no) debt. Debt limits our freedoms, and makes us<br/>
slaves to the lender. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What you are talking about is living within ones means.  It has nothing<br/>
whatsoever to do with wether or not someone goes to college, or even if<br/>
someone makes tons of money or not.  My experience has shown that most<br/>
folks who make a lot of money, also have a lot of debt, not the other<br/>
way around.  Most people who make very little money, have very little<br/>
debt.  That might not be everyone else&#39;s experience, but that&#39;s what<br/>
I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; A college degree bestows an &quot;economic advantage&quot; (although most<br/>
 </span></blockquote>degrees are wildly over-priced). Not for everyone--but for most.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure, colleges and schools would love for us all to believe this load of<br/>
lies!  They have an invested interest to promote that idea!<br/>
