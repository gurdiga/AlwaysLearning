<div id="ygrps-yiv-799903533">On the SCA Homeschoolers list, someone had asked about dyslexia and <br/>
unschooling, and another mom wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We have learned, that it is possible for a parent to learn pretty much <br/>
everything they need to know to accommodate a child&#39;s disabilities, but it is <br/>
never possible for an expert to learn everything they need to know about a <br/>
child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now THAT I like.  It&#39;s a way to cover the &#39;you&#39;re the expert&#39; in a meaningful <br/>
way.  <br/>
You have the opportunity to be the expert on your child.<br/>
