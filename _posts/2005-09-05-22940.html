<div id="ygrps-yiv-366260388">Hi,<br/>
We have been unschooling our 10 yo daughter and 7 yo son for 2 years <br/>
now.  Our son is taking to it just fine and has an incredible <br/>
curiosity, desire to explore and learn.  If it is t.v., he watches <br/>
Discovery or the Science channels.  He is active with karate and <br/>
triathlons which is plenty!  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand there is our daughter.  To her t.v. is distasteful<br/>
(in our eyes) cartoons fron 8am to 10pm daily!  Pottery class is her <br/>
outside activity and she keeps frogs, saltwater fish and lizards as <br/>
her intersts dictate.  These activites are second cartoons of course.<br/>
<br/>
The puzzle lies in the fact that if our daughter even senses that she <br/>
is about to learn something outside her interest area she shuts <br/>
down.  If we were to ask her the time she will not respond since it <br/>
could be construed as learning outside her field of interest.  If we <br/>
ask her if she were to buy 5 additional fish then how many would she <br/>
have.  She would then know she is being &quot;tricked&quot; into learning math <br/>
and will not respond.  Many times in conversation you can see that <br/>
presented information is being thought of as learning and so ends the <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We are also ready to disallow cartoons.  They have been the root of <br/>
so much family disruption(not eating dinner together, just 5 more <br/>
minites!!!, not taking care of other responsibilities first like <br/>
feeding pets.) and on and on.  We have considered letting pets die <br/>
(we would need to lie if we let them go free) from lack of care as a <br/>
learning tool, yet we hate to see them suffer. <br/>
<br/>
Well, that is enough, I guess, to get the picture, any ideas?  We <br/>
will consider all options, if any.  We &quot;heard&quot; that &quot;if you think it <br/>
is bad now just wait a few years&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If what she does is distasteful to you, she probably knows it.   It would be <br/>
better for you and her and the relationship between you and her for you to <br/>
really, openly and honestly, look at her interests through her eyes.   Find out <br/>
what she DOES like.   Like it with her.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of her as &quot;stubborn.&quot;   It&#39;s negative.<br/>
Think of it as focussed or dedicated.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not a puzzle.   That is the root of the difference between someone <br/>
else imposing what is &quot;educational&quot; on a person, and the unschooling creation of <br/>
a rich, accepting, happy learning environment.<br/>
<br/>
You can do it!   Lots of people have done it.<br/>

Please do read through the informaton at the two links above, and then maybe <br/>
here if you&#39;re not tired of it at that point:<br/>

If you understand unschooling better, it will start to work better <br/>
immediately.   When it&#39;s working better, you&#39;ll understand it better.   It will play <br/>
back and forth that way and keep improving.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of negativity tied to your view about your dd&#39;s <br/>
interests. Her interests, including cartoons, are just as valid as <br/>
your ds&#39;s interests. If she loves cartoons, watch them with her, try <br/>
to understand them, help her access other aspects of this love and <br/>
become her ally, not her enemy.<br/>
Unschooling can not unfold in the way you read about here unless you <br/>
DO become their ally.<br/>
<br/>
Try to let go of those negative perceptions, she is picking up on <br/>
that, I guarantee it!  I&#39;m sure she&#39;s feeling invalidated, because <br/>
her interests cause angst and distress, while her brothers get <br/>
positive feedback.<br/>
Feeling as though she may lose something she loves will cause her to <br/>
do it MORE, not less.<br/>
<br/>
I had a really great conversation with Sandra last night about <br/>
healing through unschooling. I shared something Luz Shosie had <br/>
written, that I really, really love;<br/>
&quot;We were all born with a drive to learn that is more compelling than <br/>
almost any other instinct.  If we step back from the power struggles <br/>
we can be ALLIES with our children in learning, solving problems and <br/>
creating what John Holt called &quot;a life worth living adn work worth <br/>
doing.&quot;  Unschooling is deprogramming, healing, regenerating.  It is <br/>
remembering to relax and trust our own and our children&#39;s innate <br/>
ability to choose ideas and activities that promote lifelong <br/>
learning and growth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Let your child SHINE (Anne Ohman&#39;s word) in your eyes. Trust that <br/>
she is capable, intelligent and worthy. Her interests matter, <br/>
whatever they may be. Don&#39;t try to push her to learn anything, just <br/>
let it unfold naturally....be her ally.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about taking the opposite approach and EMBRACE her interests  <br/>
instead of denigrating them?<br/>
Find out what her favorite cartoons are. Watch them with her. Rent  <br/>
them so you can watch them in a &quot;marathon&quot; format. Find related  <br/>
merchandise to buy. Have FUN with it. Dress up like cartoon  <br/>
characters for Halloween (whole family). Plan a trip to an animation  <br/>
studio - does she like Disney cartoons? Plan a trip to Disneyland and  <br/>
California Adventure where they have a very cool animation studio  <br/>
where kids get to engage in a bunch of animation activities.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re missing something big if you don&#39;t recognize what cartoons  <br/>
offer. Lots of cartoons have really significant themes - friendship,  <br/>
danger, good versus evil, loyalty, and so on. Watch WITH her and look  <br/>
for the FUN in it. Get the jokes. Laugh. Do NOT make it into a  <br/>
lesson, but just make it a together time.<br/>
<br/>
The cartoons might be a way to escape from you. You&#39;ll never find out  <br/>
because you appear to be treating her as an adversary - she is  <br/>
sensitive to you trying to manipulate her into learning. Stop that.<br/>
Be on her side. Love what she loves.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re considering being very meanspirited. I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t  <br/>
really want to model that, right? What DO you want to model?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has a hamster. It is in a nice big aquarium right in the  <br/>
living room and I take good care of it. I change its water every  <br/>
single day. I give it little treats - whenever I&#39;m eating a piece of  <br/>
fruit or veggie and cut off a little bit and give it to the hamster.  <br/>
I feed it. I clean its cage.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 14 and I still do all these things. Why? Because I  <br/>
decided when we got it that it was going to be a source of joy to our  <br/>
family, not something to fight over and certainly not something to  <br/>
make my daughter feel ashamed about or like a failure. LOTS of times  <br/>
I&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, Rosie, give the hamster some food.&quot; Or, &quot;Rosie, come  <br/>
help me change the hamster bedding.&quot; I don&#39;t interrupt her and I  <br/>
don&#39;t insist and if she doesn&#39;t find time I just do it, happily.<br/>
<br/>
It is NORMAL for kids not to take good care of pets. Why parents set  <br/>
themselves up for a daily battle, by getting pets under the condition  <br/>
that the children will care for them - is beyond me. A set up for a  <br/>
kid to feel like a failure and everybody to end up with hard  <br/>
feelings. What I try to do is share the enjoyment of taking care of  <br/>
that sweet little hamster - if it isn&#39;t like that, then I don&#39;t ask  <br/>
for help.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect your thoughts are filled with, &quot;But she &#39;should&#39; take care  <br/>
of her own pets.&quot; &quot;But she shouldn&#39;t watch so much tv.&quot; &quot;But she  <br/>
should want to watch something better than cartoons.&quot; And so on.<br/>
<br/>
You sound very angry at her that she&#39;s not rising to your  <br/>
expectations. In fact, you sound angry at her for not &quot;being&quot; a  <br/>
better person.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a pretty horrible reality for a child to have to live with -  <br/>
her parents not thinking well of her, in general.<br/>
<br/>
I really truly think that if you fix YOUR problem - change the way  <br/>
you think of her (especially that she doesn&#39;t fare well in  <br/>
comparisons to her brother) - you&#39;ll find that curiosity and love of  <br/>
learning will slowly return to her.<br/>
<br/>
But, you cannot MAKE that happen. What you can do is love her now -  <br/>
SHOW that you love her by showing respect for her choices. And,  <br/>
gently invite her to do things with you for the ENJOYMENT, not to  <br/>
trick her into learning something.<br/>
<br/>
Also - no more exaggeration. How can she watch tv from 8 am to 10 pm?  <br/>
Do you NEVER go out of the house with her?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sad for you because you&#39;re missing out on the love and  <br/>
laughter and closeness of these wonderful years. I so understand  <br/>
being worried about our children - that they won&#39;t be prepared for  <br/>
the future. I really do. But maybe you could just decide to take a  <br/>
break from that worry, for now, for, say, one year. For one year just  <br/>
focus on ONLY the positives and LOOK differently at everything and  <br/>
try to see positives where you&#39;ve never seen them. Think more about  <br/>
cartoons - watch them. Think about what is so great about them. Find  <br/>
some that you loved as a kid and rent them - my kids were pretty  <br/>
amused at how excited I got when we bought a &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; cartoon  <br/>
from the dollar store. We watched it and I just laughed so hard - I  <br/>
hadn&#39;t seen those cartoons for over 40 years. It was great. When  <br/>
you&#39;ve watched her cartoons with her and enjoyed them, a lot, maybe  <br/>
you can introduce some new ones - &quot;Kiko&#39;s Delivery Service&quot; is a  <br/>
wonderful Japanese animated movie - same guy who made &quot;Spirited Away&quot;  <br/>
which is absolutely gorgeous and weird and may or may not be to her  <br/>
taste.<br/>
<br/>
Go on a Disney movie kick - get one every day and watch it as a  <br/>
family. Have popcorn. Have fun. And let it go if that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
interest her. Or just get it yourself and watch it and let her join  <br/>
you or not.<br/>
<br/>
Also - think about why she&#39;d want to watch cartoons all the time?  <br/>
What else is going on in the home? Cartoons are THE most attractive  <br/>
thing to her, right now. Respect that - but you might wonder what  <br/>
else MIGHT be attractive to her. How about horseback riding lessons?  <br/>
Ice skating? Backpacking? Barbie dolls. Origami. Cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Does she have friends? Do they sit and watch cartoons with her during  <br/>
that 8 am to 10 pm time?<br/>
<br/>
What else is going on? Is she depressed?<br/>
<br/>
Please remember that how her parents think of her, now, is how she is  <br/>
likely to think of herself, when she&#39;s an adult.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, it&#39;s normal for parents not to take very good care of kids.<br/>
Some parents are downright abusive to their kids while reciting the evil <br/>
mantra &quot;it&#39;s for your own good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t hurt for parents to practice on pets. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Practicing on kids is good too.    <br/>
<br/>
And what Ren and were discussing last night is that when parents are gentler <br/>
and more positive with their kids, they come to be happier, gentler and more <br/>
positive with and in themselve<br/>

*******************<br/>
Distasteful? Cartoons? I had a neighbor several years ago use this word. I  <br/>
knew they were fairly strict parents who were more concerned about impressing  <br/>
others than their children. So much so they thought our son and family was ill <br/>
 suited for their sweet little girls.<br/>
Just yesterday, their oldest, walked down the road dressed in an all black  <br/>
lace dress,black lace hat, a large lace black umbrella and black makeup. She  <br/>
told my son last week that when she is 38 (no clue about the number) she was  <br/>
going to hang herself in the family dining room in front of her kids. <br/>
Why? I don&#39;t know *yet but I suspect she is rebelling against her  parents.<br/>
********************<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;The puzzle lies in the fact that if our daughter even senses that  she <br/>

**********************<br/>
This is classic for a child who attended public school. You may still see  <br/>
this in two years. I would suggest changing your relationship with her. You need <br/>
 to be her friend and playmate right now not her teacher.<br/>

This will bring you unhappy results for all. Maybe she would like to go  <br/>
somewhere? Maybe as much as her brother but for her?<br/>

You know I had a situation a little over a year ago regarding pets. Ours  was <br/>
a cat and litter box... The cat is no longer his job and his room smells  <br/>
much nicer..  When parents buy pets they must know that in the end if the  animal <br/>
is un-cared for the job becomes theirs. Why (knowing this now myself)  would <br/>
you want to have weekly stress over something that can easily be  <br/>
resolved/stopped?<br/>

***<br/>
Jeff and Judi, my advice... get your daughter out of the house, talk to her  <br/>
and get to know her before she gets to puberty and stops talking. It only gets <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175519354">&quot; We realize a lot of this is OUR problem, but please<br/>
don&#39;t tell me that we are the only ones making mistakes along this<br/>
huge adventure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well...I could tell you that, but I&#39;d be a huge hypocrite. Yes, I make<br/>
mistakes plenty.  But if someone posts a huge wad of negativity about<br/>
how they view their child, they should expect posts telling them to<br/>
shift how they think/act towards that child.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what else you&#39;d expect here!:)<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I view your family as awful or horrible...anyone<br/>
even seeking unschooling or gentle parenting answers is miles ahead of<br/>
most families.<br/>
<br/>
About the animals, I&#39;m not sure how you got SO many animals without<br/>
regards to the other members of the family. It&#39;s one thing to honor<br/>
interests, it&#39;s something else entirely when those interests are<br/>
detracting from someone elses peace and joy.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you have to get creative when one member loves animals and<br/>
someone else doesn&#39;t care for pets (I&#39;m thinking of my own family),<br/>
like having a membership to the zoo, or frequenting pet stores, maybe<br/>
volunteering at a wildlife center etc...<br/>
Filling your home with something that causes friction and distress is<br/>
not the best way to honor her interest. I guess you all have figured<br/>
that out now, but need a way to creatively problem solve now that it&#39;s<br/>
too late!<br/>
<br/>
If you sit down and discuss how it affects your dh, how the<br/>
responsibility is just too much for everyone and maybe try to find<br/>
some good homes for a few pets, would she be open to that?  I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s fair for anyone to be surrounded by something they don&#39;t<br/>
like, sounds that aggravate them etc... My dh would be beside<br/>
himself...but that&#39;s why we discuss these issues BEFORE bringing any<br/>
animals into the house.<br/>
<br/>
Balance is the goal...you all just need to find that balance again.<br/>

Cats, like all creatures, can be complicated. Personality has as much to do<br/>
with it as gender and size. I recommend contacting Cats International. They<br/>
offer a free behavior hotline to help people with just such issues. If there<br/>
is a spraying/litterbox issue contact them sooner than later. I¹m guessing<br/>
they¹ll focus in on how to reduce stress for both these cats to help them<br/>

and one female, both fixed. They are the same age, rescued both as <br/>
kittens and raised them together (they arent littermates though.)I&#39;ve <br/>
rescued cats in the past, and never had a problem with any of them <br/>
fighting or not getting along, whether male or female, but they were <br/>
all fixed so that might be a factor as well. I would think that two <br/>
unneutered males might fight if there were a female present.<br/>

I&#39;ve never known one to do so, and have had a male cat around a litter of <br/>
kittens not his own more than once.   <br/>

I&#39;ve known dogs kill a kitten twice by trying to move them like the mom cat <br/>

(Well... did it with some and failed with others.)   I don&#39;t know why the dogs were <br/>
moving the kittens one by one.   Once (years ago) a dog was moving them from <br/>
the inside of the house to an outside house (guest house).   More recently, <br/>
Kirby was here and I wasn&#39;t, and the dog was moving them from a closet to <br/>
another room.    Putting them back where the mom cat had had them the first time.   <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
It may vary by the age at which the male was fixed.  I&#39;ve known male<br/>
neutered cats who still sprayed--and a quick google search says 10% of<br/>
neutered males spray, as do 5% of spayed females--but I would assume<br/>
that the drive to reproduce would change when there weren&#39;t any<br/>
testicles producing testosterone.  Have you ever seen pictures of male<br/>
Castrati (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrato)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrato)</a>?  Here&#39;s the last<br/>
recording of Allessandro Moreschi<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Moreschi)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Moreschi)</a>:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-castrato_recording.html.">http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-castrato_recording.html.</a>  Or the<br/>

There is a complete lack of post-pubescent male cues. Testosterone is<br/>
a big drug with huge behavioral changes associated.  Apparently in<br/>
Europe castration has been used to &quot;treat&quot; sex offenders with a change<br/>
in recidivism from 46 percent to 3 percent according to one German<br/>
study (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.utmb.edu/imh/announcements.asp?id=67)">http://www.utmb.edu/imh/announcements.asp?id=67)</a>. So, maybe<br/>
that which works in humans would also work in cats? With a recidivism<br/>
rate of 3 to 7%?   <br/>
<br/>
Aha--here is a paper on infanticide among rats that states:<br/>
&quot;The presence of testosterone in the young male rat is implicated in<br/>
infanticidal behavior. Male rats castrated while young are much less<br/>
likely to kill newborn rats than intact controls (32% of castrates<br/>
kill strange newborns, compared with 79.5% of intact males), but if<br/>
they are given replacement injections of testosterone their<br/>
infanticidal behavior resembles that of intact rats (76% are<br/>
infanticidal: Rosenberg et al. 1974).&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ratbehavior.org/infanticide.htm">http://www.ratbehavior.org/infanticide.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Sounds like it is in the nuts.<br/>
<br/>
So, probably not as likely to, and if the risks are relatively low to<br/>
begin with--and I can&#39;t find any data online giving me rates--then it<br/>
should be that much lower in neutered males.  <br/>
<br/>
I found one article<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bsas.org.uk/downloads/annlproc/Pdf2003/016.pdf)">http://www.bsas.org.uk/downloads/annlproc/Pdf2003/016.pdf)</a> looking at<br/>
affiliative behaviour (e.g. allogroom, rub cat, miaow) in cats that<br/>
found that the presence of kittens only mildly increased defensive<br/>
interactions while increasing vigilance and what they called<br/>
affiliative behaviours among a group of 9 adult cats living in a two<br/>
story house. The lack of much change in aggressive interactions when<br/>
kittens were added to the interactions might mean that even without<br/>
the presence of male hormones the two female cats would hiss at the tom.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98190210">I&#39;ve never seen it nor experienced it nor had a friend who told me<br/>
stories of it.  My experience is based entirely on some ancient<br/>
British television show that PBS used to show as filler that mentioned<br/>
infanticide in cats.  I think it was based on a paper by D.W. McDonald<br/>
that I kept stumbling on when I was doing a google search.  However, I<br/>
did find the abstract below with real data and real experience of some<br/>
field biologists:<br/>

Title: Infanticide in rural male cats (Felis catus L.) as a<br/>
reproductive mating tactic<br/>
Author(s): Pontier D, Natoli E<br/>

Information<br/>
Abstract: Here we report six cases of infanticide in the domestic cat<br/>
directly observed in populations located in the rural environment.<br/>
This is the first time that infanticide in domestic cats has been<br/>
witnessed directly and described. All infanticidal males were fully<br/>
adult and sexually mature unknown males. All kittens killed were<br/>
within their first week of life. The killing pattern was generally the<br/>
same as that described in lions. All females reacted aggressively but<br/>
could not prevent the infanticide. Three hypotheses are discussed :<br/>
(1) infanticide is a remnant of cat male reproductive strategy<br/>
selected in the original environment; (2) the conditions of the rural<br/>
environment have created a selection pressure encouraging a<br/>
polymorphism of infanticidal and noninfanticidal males to evolve; (3)<br/>
infanticide is an abnormal behaviour caused by environmental<br/>
conditions such as human disturbance. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc. <br/>

&gt; Thats interesting...i&#39;ve heard of male lions who recently take over <br/>
&gt; the pride(kill or chase off the top lion)killing the offspring of<br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; top lion. I&#39;ve never heard of a pet male domestic cat killing a new <br/>
&gt; kitten brought into the family. I&#39;ve had dozens of cats (rescues)and <br/>
&gt; never even had two cats fight let alone one kill another. Not saying <br/>
&gt; it &quot;never&quot; happens (obviously in your experience it does), but i dont <br/>
&gt; think its a normal response for a pet cat to kill a kitten, and would <br/>
&gt; venture to say its unusual. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, and seeing more details of the study, I&#39;m not surprised that it was <br/>
&quot;rural cats&quot; which I take to mean farm cats or barn cats--cats that live with <br/>
humans, but not in the house as lap-cats, fed canned food, trained not to <br/>
scratch the couch.   &quot;Having cats&quot; the way my grandmother did was way different <br/>
from people having cats that never go outside, wear collars, etc.   Somewhere in <br/>
there, I think instinct weakens.   Lack of example or lack of normal feline <br/>
behavior from the other cats or something, I don&#39;t know.   <br/>
<br/>
My cats are fed inside and have a litter box (two) but also can go out a pet <br/>
door, so they&#39;re inside/outside cats.    <br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the wild,&quot; my dog wouldn&#39;t have a pet cat.   One of our cats, though, <br/>
took up with the dog when she was a kitten and they&#39;re still buddies.   <br/>
