<div id="ygrps-yiv-521585004">I&#39;m about exhausted looking for a bedspread/comforter on-line. Anybody got an <br/>
&quot;in&quot; to find this stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s birthday present is a new bedroom. We&#39;re going from the cool <br/>
&quot;Batcave&quot; to a Simpsons room. I don&#39;t want the sheets &#39;cause too often they&#39;re made <br/>
of scratchy polyester, but curtains and a spread would be great. Cotton fabric <br/>
would be OK too, as I have a friend that sews.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve googled (&quot;the Simpsons&quot; bedding) and other similar things----anybody? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Can you get a picture of Bart&#39;s bed from the show and just make his bed up <br/>
like Bart&#39;s?  For documentation, you could frame the picture of Bart in his bed <br/>
right above Duncan&#39;s bed. <br/>

rather than using Simpson&#39;s character stuff?<br/>
<br/>
There was a real house built to look just like the Simpson&#39;s house, in<br/>
Henderson Nevada, and given away in a contest.  See<br/>

You can see interior shots of Bart&#39;s room in the Photos and in the virtual<br/>
tour ;-)<br/>

That&#39;s an idea.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d planned to paint the walls bright blue or something. <br/>
<br/>
I have chalkboard paint, so I was going to paint one wall with that and put a <br/>
&quot;full-sized&quot; Bart next to it . He could write &quot;I will not&#39;s&quot; on the board as <br/>
he choses. Duncan wants a life-sized Homer with a beer can saying, &quot;doh!&quot; and <br/>
Lisa with books or a sax----all the family represented. We&#39;ve thought of <br/>
writing on the walls a bunch of Simpson sayings.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the website of the Simpson house. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t pull <br/>
up anything but the first page----but I&#39;ll keep trying.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, y&#39;all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551056075">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
Can you get Simpson&#39;s material?  It would be easy to make a comforter from that.  I guess even a bedspread would be pretty easy to make!  (And, believe me, I&#39;m a BASIC sewer!)<br/>
