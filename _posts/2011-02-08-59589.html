<br/>
(Sorry I didn&#39;t send this early enough for the Ohio stop).<br/>
<br/>
We went to the tour in Seattle and had a great time. My husband went  <br/>
on the Saturday with Senna and I went to the movie on Sunday with her.  <br/>
There&#39;s a huge display of the new legendary Pokemon (good photo op), a  <br/>
Pokemon store (for plushies and t-shirts etc.), a stamp rally, an  <br/>
activity zone, a demo version of the game, and a downloadable Celebi  <br/>
at Gamestop.<br/>
<br/>
The movie tickets are free and they have around 6 showings a day, but  <br/>
be prepared to hang around and stand in line and have the distribution  <br/>
changed at the last minute &lt;sigh&gt;. Also, all the parties you want  <br/>
tickets for must be present when you request tickets.<br/>
<br/>
The coolest thing is seeing just how many Pokemon afficionados there  <br/>
are, young and older. Some cosplay, so it&#39;s fun figuring out what  <br/>
characters they are.<br/>
