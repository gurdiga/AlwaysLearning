<div id="ygrps-yiv-941603180">I&#39;m being very nonchalant with Lexie, but she<br/>
has chosen, all on her own (with only what I<br/>
am pretty sure were minimal vibes from me) to<br/>
NOT continue her homeschooling academy, which<br/>
had really turned into a one day a week<br/>
school.  I am very thrilled. I wasn&#39;t really<br/>
wantingher to do this, but she was begging<br/>
for some sort of school thing, and so I found<br/>
this, which is, as I said, a one day a week<br/>
full day school thing with other<br/>
homeschoolers.  Most are homeschoolers,<br/>
though, and not unschoolers, and as Lexie<br/>
said &quot;there are more and more rules every<br/>
time I go!&quot;  Her only reason for staying was<br/>
the kids, she loves being around other<br/>
children, but she said &quot;I never get to do<br/>
anything with them, I have to be quiet and<br/>
sit but then the other kids talk and the<br/>
teacher has to tell them to be quiet and they<br/>
don&#39;t, and so I don&#39;t learn anything,<br/>
anyway.&quot;  The last months she was talking<br/>
about how she really wasn&#39;t learning<br/>
anything, except for in Spanish.  Also, I<br/>
think she saw a lot of stuff she didn&#39;t like,<br/>
the management issues, how kids who behaved<br/>
(like she did) were &quot;punished&quot; (her word)<br/>
along with those who misbehaved (example, the<br/>
pe teacher said that those who behaved could<br/>
help her with something but then decided that<br/>
everyone had misbehaved and no one could help<br/>
and Lexie said that she and brett and another<br/>
child had behaved but the teacher hadn&#39;t seen<br/>
this or didn&#39;t care.  typical school stuff).<br/>
Anyway, she agreed the other night that the<br/>
work was all very easy, except for the<br/>
writing, which she says &quot;I can do that on my<br/>
own&quot; and that she hadn&#39;t relaly learned<br/>
anything &quot;except in Spanish&quot; and &quot;I can do<br/>
that on my own, better&quot; and she doesn&#39;t like<br/>
getting up so early, etc.  So she wants to<br/>
not go.  We will attempt to spend time with<br/>
the kids she has chosen to stay in contact<br/>
with, she made a list of 4-5 kids she wants<br/>
to keep seeing.  I am concerned about Janene,<br/>
she has two older boys she loves there, and<br/>
she wont&#39; see them again, but I am certain<br/>
this is the right decision.  Change is hard,<br/>
even if we know it&#39;s for the best.  I am<br/>
taking tomorrow off from work to go wtih her<br/>
on the last day of the semester, so we can<br/>
get phone numbers of the friends she wants to<br/>
stay in contact with and so I can try to talk<br/>
to those parents.  Not sure if we&#39;ll stay the<br/>
entire day or not...<br/>
<br/>
I am very pleased about this decision, but a<br/>
bit surprised.  She has all along said she<br/>
loved it, but what I see she really loves is<br/>
the social, and I think she realized that the<br/>
confounds of school makes the social she love<br/>
just not happen.  We&#39;ll ahve to work hard to<br/>
maintain these relationships...<br/>
