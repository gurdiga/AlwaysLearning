Trivia An historic moment in time<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At 8.02pm on February 20 this year it will be an historic moment in time.<br/>
<br/>
It will not be marked by the chiming of any clocks or the ringing of bells,<br/>
but<br/>
at that precise time, on that specific date, something will happen which<br/>
has not<br/>
occurred for 1,001 years and will never happen again.<br/>
<br/>
As the clock ticks over from 8.01pm on Wednesday, February 20, time will, for<br/>
sixty seconds only, read in perfect symmetry 2002, 2002, 2002, or to be more<br/>
precise - 20:02, 20/02, 2002.<br/>
<br/>
The last occasion that time read in such a symmetrical pattern was long <br/>
before<br/>
the days of the digital watch and the 24-hour clock - at 10:01am on January<br/>
10,<br/>
1001. And because the clock only goes up to 23:59, it is something that will<br/>
never happen again.<br/>
