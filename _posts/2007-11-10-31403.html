<br/>
There was a clash (this list or another) a few months ago about  <br/>
someone who had lots of very young children getting angry because I  <br/>
said there could be too many children for some things to work.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people write about whether something is &quot;their job&quot; as a  <br/>
mom or not.<br/>
<br/>
All those things have come together in a thought about labor unions.<br/>
<br/>
Cultural expectations color our thoughts and language.  It can&#39;t be  <br/>
helped.  Growing up after labor unions and workplace regulations  <br/>
about hours and breaks and conditions were very common, the idea that  <br/>
life should be fair and somewhat equalized, and no one in the same  <br/>
position should &quot;have to&quot; work harder than others of the same grade  <br/>
and rank seem like realities.<br/>
<br/>
To speak of mothering or parenting as &quot;a job&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to show  <br/>
the realities of it clearly.   Having reproduced, one is a mother or  <br/>
a father.  Having adopted, one is a mother or a father.  That&#39;s what  <br/>
it is.  The only thing remaining then is whether to be a good parent  <br/>
or not.  There is no court of appeals to say &quot;Yes, you get a nanny  <br/>
because you have so many kids,&quot; or &quot;Yes, you can go to lunch like  <br/>
your friends who have two kids, even though you have six.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Each child needs as much love and attention as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the parents are very needy due to their own backgrounds or  <br/>
upbringing.  Rather than having children fulfill my needs, I found  <br/>
other outlets and sources for processing my personal problems.    <br/>
Lists like this can be helpful, and I spent some years in Adult  <br/>
Children of Alcoholics meetings, and La Leche League was great for  <br/>
moms helping moms too.<br/>
<br/>
Needy parents could beget needy children just as spanked children can  <br/>
beget spanked children.<br/>
<br/>
I opted to try to make sure my children weren&#39;t needy.  That&#39;s going  <br/>
to be different in different families and different circumstances,  <br/>
and with different kids.  The practicalities are going to be  <br/>
different, but the principles are the same.  No mom is guaranteed six  <br/>
consecutive hours of sleep.  No mom is guaranteed an hour to herself  <br/>
free, or even fifteen minute coffee breaks.<br/>
<br/>
An early investment in children&#39;s happiness pays off pretty quickly,  <br/>
though, and in the long run moms gets LOTS of peace and quiet when  <br/>
their kids are older and helpful and trustworthy and content.<br/>
