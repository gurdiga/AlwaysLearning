<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really like that.  Inspiration... Next time, I will try not to have the stone face.  It can&#39;t be very inspirational!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I remember a discussion with some of the total non-coercion proponents once, <br/>
&gt;about persuasion.  If persuasions a sin there, maybe it&#39;s just because <br/>
&gt;they&#39;re not good at persuasion.  I don&#39;t know.  I think it&#39;s a great tool in <br/>
&gt;life in general, and if nobody&#39;s feeling tricked or duped or embarrassed when <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s over, then it was free will exercise.<br/>

With kids, you were just stating some facts.  If I say &quot;The mess in the den <br/>
is really getting to me.  Could you guys at least get your own stuff out?  <br/>
And I need help with laundry folding.&quot; I&#39;m wanting them to do something.  <br/>
Lots of things.   I&#39;m just not saying &quot;Anything still in here in an hour is <br/>
trash&quot; or &quot;Marty YOU clean it all up, because you&#39;ve been the least helpful <br/>
lately.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sandra, you were talking about angst you expressed when Kirby was younger.  <br/>
Could this have been why Kirby is a better reader?  Are there any negative <br/>
side affects from displaying your angst?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t display it much, I just let it make my stomach acid dance.<br/>
<br/>
There were two and a half reading lessons when Kirby was seven (six or <br/>
seven).  Horrible.  I would love to take those back.  I was afraid of his <br/>
grandma.  Everybody is.  If he had read at two on national TV she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have been happy.  I just hadn&#39;t figured that out, quite, in those days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still aware of some thing, like my kids don&#39;t have good handwriting, but <br/>
having taught jr. high I remember kids who&#39;d been in school for nine or ten <br/>
years who didn&#39;t have either.   The difference is my kids haven&#39;t been made <br/>
to rewrite boring homework, or gotten bad grades in penmanship, or points <br/>
taken off a grade because they wrote something illegibly, or shamed or <br/>
laughed at in front of 30 people repeatedly for years.   They&#39;re happy guys <br/>
whose writing&#39;s bad, instead of shamed to the core guys whose writing&#39;s bad.  <br/>
  Kirby&#39;s is starting to show some improvement.  He wants to take driver&#39;s <br/>
ed, and he&#39;s learning to cook.  He wrote down a recipe the other day.  Nobody <br/>
made him.<br/>
