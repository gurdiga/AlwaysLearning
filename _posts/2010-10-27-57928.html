The free software that you download from their site is perfect for our needs and they can use a webcam to take the pictures which are directly pasted into the software and it is very easy to make cool little movies within minutes of opening the book.  I showed it to my 7 year old tonight.. i played with it for a little while first to make sure it worked.  And he was so excited.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551585392">If you have a MAC/ Apple store close to you they do educator field trips, I took my homeschool group there last week we did stop motion, the kids get a t-shirt and certificate along with their finished projects. Just sign up on the Apple site they call you and set it up. Cheryl<br/>

Thank you for this! We, too, have been disappointed with different types of software - I almost bought the Klutz book the other day, but hesitated. It&#39;s good to hear a review:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253887052">Hi<br/>
Thanks for this. I went to the klutz website to look at it and found a page about their tricky videos book. There was a link from that page to videos they had made using the &quot;tricks&quot; in the book. my 2 children (age 7 and 4) spent about an hour watching them and lapping it up.<br/>
Then we looked at some of the animations from the animation book.<br/>
It inspired lots of fun and pondering how they might have achieved the effects.<br/>
We will definitely be buying both books and downloading the software.<br/>
For anyone in the UK, amazon seems to have a great price on the books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424334104">We&#39;ve made stop motion animation on the cheap by taking a series of photos (on our digital camera) of the figures&#39; movements and then, after downloading the images to the computer, we run them through iPhoto&#39;s slideshow on the option for the fastest paced image change. If you don&#39;t use a Mac, or iPhoto, I imagine any photo program you run will work, so long as it has a slideshow option.<br/>
<br/>
It is a bit choppy, but really not too bad.  My daughter is more than happy with the results (for now), and with a tripod, she can do a lot of it herself.<br/>
<br/>
The Klutz program looks really cool though!<br/>
