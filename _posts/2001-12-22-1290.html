<div id="ygrps-yiv-899358695">Deb says,<br/>
&quot;dogs bond<br/>
with humans so strongly they will risk their lives for them, or grieve<br/>
when they die.  Is that spiritual?<br/>
Is caring and compassion really spiritual?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think yes! I think qualities that are &quot;a feeling&quot; are spiritual, except<br/>
hate,negatives, because that is based more on  misunderstanding and<br/>
ignorance.<br/>
Some of the most Spiritual people I know don&#39;t believe in God, but they<br/>
still express Goodness which in my belief is expressing God, Buddha, Allah,<br/>
The Great Spirit, The Force, the great magnet, etc.</div>
