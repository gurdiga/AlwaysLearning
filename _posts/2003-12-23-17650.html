<div id="ygrps-yiv-184718787">We have two of these for our boys.  They are light and<br/>
easy to move, which we do frequently.  They are easy<br/>
to clean because the back removes from the seat and<br/>
the cloth cover removes to wash.  They each have two<br/>
pull out cupholders which are also great for little<br/>
snacks and small toys.  The arm rests are a good<br/>
length and the &quot;wings&quot; work well for when they fall<br/>
asleep in the car.  The boys call them their &quot;race car<br/>
seats&quot; and think they are pretty cool.<br/>
