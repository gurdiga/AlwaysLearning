hard to sort out reality from fantasy and where there are PLENTY of people <br/>
who really want to believe in the fantasy, for many reasons.<br/>

If I was vacuuming my living room and thought I saw a fairy, I&#39;d SURE hope to <br/>
be capable of &quot;second-guessing&quot; myself and considering the possibility that <br/>
it was, in fact, a glint of sunlight reflecting off the vacuum cleaner.<br/>

20 years ago, my husband saw, with his own eyes and up close and personal, a <br/>
HUGE rat - like the size of a dog and NOT a little-bitty dog. It was in our <br/>
backyard. He told people about this GIANT rat for weeks. People in the <br/>
neighborhood started getting weirded out by the idea of these GIANT rats <br/>
running around in our backyards. Some of them saw it too. People were keeping <br/>
their kids out of their backyards and calling the county animal control <br/>
people and demanding that they do something about the invasion of giant rats.<br/>
<br/>
Then, finally, I saw it too. It was a HUGE....possum.<br/>

My husband comes from Iran - they don&#39;t have the same wildlife we do. They <br/>
don&#39;t have possums.<br/>

My bil comes from a very rural area in northern California and knows all kinds of wildlife--foxes, bears, mountain lions, etc. After he moved to town he called Fish and Game to tell them he had spotted either a new species of animal or some strange mutant creature. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, it was a possum. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421513699">I forgot to say, my father later gave him a copy of Possum Come A-Knockin, to give him insight into the nature of possums, I think. It&#39;s a great book. We have a very dog-eared copy ourselves!<br/>
