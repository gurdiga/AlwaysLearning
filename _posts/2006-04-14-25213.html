<div id="ygrps-yiv-897721917">Hi, <br/>
  I mainly lurk here, read a lot,  and see my family moving toward no controls...slowly.  Here is a situation that happened this morning at our house.  It was a busy time, breakfast happening and my husband going off to work early.  (I have a 9yo, a 7yo, a 2 yo, and a 5 mo).....the 2 yo asked for oatmeal, which she likes to share with her Dad.  She then spotted a bowl of jelly beans on the counter that were left over from yesterday and climbed up on a chair to get them.  As she reached for them, Dad said, &quot;Those aren&#39;t really a breakfast food.&quot;  I said, &quot;It&#39;s OK, Honey&quot; to my husband and she proceeded to have a few jelly beans and brought about 4 more over to her high chair.  I didn&#39;t say anything to her.  She happily sat with oatmeal, pineapple, oj, and jelly beans on her tray.  As she was eating, I said something like &quot;You know, when I eat candy and my tummy is empty, it sometimes feels yucky.&quot;  My 7 yo said he agreed and told me about a time he had eaten chocolate when<br/>
 he was really hungry.  I guess my question is, was it worth talking about the principle right then?  I felt like I was really doing it more for the 7 yo and 9 yo....should I have said nothing and saved the conversation about being healthy and taking care of our bodies for another time?  Not really sure how this should have played out......<br/>
  Thanks for reading and offering suggestions.  I apprecuate all of the years of wisdom here.....<br/>
  Peace, <br/>
  Beth <br/>
  NB:  The four or so jelly beans on her tray got chewed and spit out! <br/>

There are a few real biological realities and a WHOLE lot of  <br/>
traditional warning and threat.<br/>
&quot;That will make you sick&quot; is said of very many things that will NOT  <br/>
make someone sick.<br/>
<br/>
Jelly beans aren&#39;t traditional breakfast food, but donuts are.   <br/>
Pancakes with fruit and syrup are.  Oatmeal with brown sugar is.<br/>
<br/>
To tell a child that candy might feel yucky is not a principle.<br/>
<br/>
For parents to resolve to let children figure out for themselves how  <br/>
things actually DO make them feel, that&#39;s a principle.  The idea that  <br/>
people learn better by actually learning than by following  <br/>
recommendations and avoiding things they&#39;ve been warned about is a  <br/>
principle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041120285">Thanks, <br/>
  So, the principle of taking care of our bodies is an on-going conversation that I and my husband model.....and biting my tongue and not letting go(!) during a &quot;jelly bean breakfast&quot; is best for her to figure out what tastes good and what doesn&#39;t for herself....(I guess she already knows since she spit out the jelly beans!)  I didn&#39;t see what I said to her about feeling yucky as a veiled threat (you&#39;re going to get sick), but when you repeated it back to me, it sure sounded different.  I thought I was just sharing my own experience.....I guess my confusion is when to share experience and when to step back.  <br/>
  Thanks, <br/>
  Beth (who is bting her tongue for the rest of the day!)<br/>
