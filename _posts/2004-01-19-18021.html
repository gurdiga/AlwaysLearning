**OK, here&#39;s a true Unschooling Confession:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; When Zoe was 4-5, we read her &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; - 3 times in a row!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking back, that seems a little kooky, but she loved it so.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s another one, confession that is.   My son begged and begged to watch<br/>
Jurassic Park at the age of 4/5.   This was before my unschooling<br/>
transformation.  I didn&#39;t let him, I didn&#39;t let him,  finally I think when<br/>
he was 5, we caved in.    Poor guy, me not letting him at first,  although<br/>
it still scares me!<br/>
<br/>
He loved it,  wasn&#39;t scared by it at all,  just continued to love dinasaurs<br/>
and all that has to do with them.   This is him talking, &quot;Mom,  you know its<br/>
all make believe,  there aren&#39;t any real dinasaurs out there!&quot;   said with a<br/>
huge grin on his face.<br/>
<br/>
So interesting,  he isn&#39;t bothered at all by those movies,  then last year<br/>
we watched Robin Hood: Prince of Theives and scolded me for not warning him<br/>
about the violence!   &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m slowly figuring it out. :)<br/>
<br/>
I have to look up Raptor Red,  I&#39;ve never heard of that one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my grandson (step-grandson? Rain&#39;s half-sister&#39;s son) and his mom<br/>
came out to visit when he was 2 or 3, watching this video was one of his<br/>
favorite things to do at our house. &quot;Watch a dinosaur movie? Watch a<br/>
dinosaur movie?&quot; I&#39;m surprised we didn&#39;t wear out the tape... sometimes<br/>
Rain could deflect him to Land of the Lost videos, which also had<br/>
dinosaurs, but mostly he wanted All Jurassic Park, All the Time. I<br/>
haven&#39;t wanted to watch it since... but he was happy, and not scared, and<br/>
it didn&#39;t seem to scar him for life.<br/>
<br/>
When he came to visit the year before, his mom commented that Rain and I<br/>
picked him up whenever he asked, whereas her mom had stopped when he<br/>
learned to walk, because he was &quot;too big&quot;. It was nice that her parenting<br/>
philosophy ended up more in line with mine...<br/>
