<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419794369">I was just sitting her having my tea and remembering that when I was a<br/>
young kid I *hated* painting with those stupid *kids* paintbrushes. I<br/>
hated the feel and smell of *kids* paints. Even today the nostalgia of<br/>
temprah paint borders on sickening to good memories?? I don&#39;t know how<br/>
else to say it. <br/>
<br/>
How does this post apply to unschooling...ok ok I&#39;m gettin there!<br/>
<br/>
The other day we pulled out all of my *old* art supplies from my<br/>
college days. These are my gold...my pastels, my oil paints, my 20<br/>
dollar brushes, my expensive paper...do you see a pattern. They area<br/>
all *MINE*. <br/>
<br/>
We have recently moved. As I unpacked all of our boxes I have stumbled<br/>
upon my treasure trove of ultimate art supplies. MINE! Anyhow, both of<br/>
my kids were completley fascinated with this big box of MINE! So I<br/>
slowly pulled out all of my treasures and explained how they were so<br/>
expensive and then my mental lightbulb went on! Oh Hello TICIA you<br/>
silly Mommy, your children want to play with your &quot;expensive&quot; and<br/>
alluring art supplies because they are so desired now. LOL<br/>
<br/>
That lightbulb was more of a lightning strike to me. I unpacked my<br/>
untouchables and let them go at all of my supplies. They played with<br/>
oil pastels, conte crayons, liquid water colors, fancy dancy paper,<br/>
and my $$$ uh um brushes. <br/>
<br/>
AND GUESS WHAT!!!<br/>
<br/>
They created such Great artwork because they enjoyed the luxury of<br/>
good brushes, paper and numerous other fun and new things. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how else to explain my round about logic. BUT, I do know<br/>
that when we go into &quot;educational supply stores&quot; we usually feel like<br/>
 we are all in a toy store. *I* am the only one who feels the guilt of<br/>
it being &quot;undercover&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the fun of exploring wherever you are. And let those kiddos<br/>
explore a piece of you and your fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843247454">On the expensive MINE things - my dear mother gave me the clarinet she used in high school when I<br/>
was 10 and starting band.  After I was finished with it, I gave it back to her.  This summer, she<br/>
gave it to my dd10, but I still think of it as MINE.  It&#39;s in need of a little repair, but after I<br/>
taped down a key whose spring had broken and put a piece of foam in place of a pad, I bought two<br/>
new reeds and tried it out.  Oh, was I out of practice!?  I explained that this clarinet was made<br/>
in the 1960&#39;s, I&#39;d seen used clarinets for $125-$200 at the music store, and they need to treat<br/>
the instrument with respect.  I was so scared to let them use it!!!  I showed them where to place<br/>
their fingers and let them go at it.  I started to go down the, &quot;let&#39;s get out the music reader<br/>
and learn what all the notes are,&quot; but then I had to remind myself that they need to get the feel<br/>
of the instrument and embouchure and just explore.  I wanted to jump in and play music teacher<br/>
sooo badly!  (We&#39;re still deschooling...)  So the kids aren&#39;t producing masterpieces yet, but they<br/>
have more musical experience in the past two weeks or so than most of the kids in our ps district,<br/>
who don&#39;t start band until 7th grade.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125382981">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group and also new to homeschooling our two daughters so <br/>
we&#39;re still deschooling also. These emails you both wrote really struck a cord <br/>
with me. I have been an artist most all of my life so I too have the &quot;MINE&quot; <br/>
attitude towards all of MY expensive art supplies. Your emails reminded me of a <br/>
time when I was doing a commissioned piece and my daughters came into my studio <br/>
asking if they too could do some painting and burning (at the time I was doing <br/>
pyrography/painting on a very large fireplace mantel) So, I went over to <br/>
&quot;their&quot; shelves of art supplies and got out &quot;their&quot; things. When I carried them <br/>
over to the table for them the look on their faces were sad and confused but they <br/>
never said a word about it, they just started painting and burning. I noticed <br/>
how awful their works of art were coming along, it was hard for them, even at <br/>
their young level, to do much detail at all with the lame supplies they had. <br/>
I ended up taking all of their stuff and throwing it in a box and took all of <br/>
my things and let them go for it. I showed them the different strokes each <br/>
brush would make and introduced them to my burner, (the one that cost me a <br/>
bundle)! and also taught them how to care for all of them. The look on their faces <br/>
was enough for me, but the art work they produced was unbelievably so much <br/>
better. I too remember:......<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was just sitting her having my  tea and remembering that when I was a<br/>
young kid I *hated* painting with those stupid *kids* paintbrushes. I<br/>
hated the feel and smell of *kids* paints. Even today the nostalgia of<br/>
temprah paint borders on sickening to good memories?? I don&#39;t know how<br/>
else to say it.&quot;   &lt;That was a perfect way of saying it! I feel the same way <br/>
too! :o)<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are homeschooling and giving our family time to deschool, thanks <br/>
for reminding me once again the need to just let my kids grow without the <br/>
influence and restrictions that were placed on them by not only the public school <br/>
system that we just (so thankfully) pulled them out of, but also, sometimes <br/>
innocently and/or unknowingly by me!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Clarinet&#39;s hard.   You should &quot;play music teacher&quot; as much as they ask.   <br/>
Probably you did show them how to make the sounds, and you probably showed them a <br/>
few notes, anyway, right?   I used to play clarinet (ages 10 to 14, after <br/>
which I sold it and bought a guitar with the money).<br/>
<br/>
When people start to mess with a recorder they tend to blow too hard and to <br/>
try to start with all the holes covered up.   That&#39;s one of the hardest notes <br/>
and it takes the LEAST air, so it&#39;s better to help them find an easier few <br/>
notes to try out.   That&#39;s not being too teacherly.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you just   meant you had to resist teaching them to read musical <br/>
notation.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and discovery are very cool, but in the face of some new piece of <br/>
equipment--musical, mechanical, cooking equipment--it&#39;s regular everyday <br/>
courtesy to help someone new to that thing understand its operation and dangers <br/>
and all.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t really about the clarinet at all, but about the idea that <br/>
unschoolers shouldn&#39;t help kids too much for fear of turning into a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
One dangerous aspect (dangerous to unschooling, I mean) of teaching is the <br/>
expectation of the teacher--the potential frustration and divisive feeling if <br/>
the lessons don&#39;t go well.   <br/>
<br/>
I let a two year old play with my pump organ the other day.   She would&#39;ve <br/>
gone for the electric keyboard that was on top of it,   but she had asked what <br/>
the pedals did, so I moved the electric keyboard, opened the lid and showed <br/>
her.   She might be too little to remember, but I think the idea of an instrument <br/>
that&#39;s not electric, that has no on/off switch, might stay with her. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
When I was little I was surrounded by people-powered tools.   My granny&#39;s <br/>
house had a treadle machine, hand-cranked meat grinder, hand-cranked egg beater, <br/>
hand-cranked drill, and they started their tractor with a crank (though after <br/>
that point it was a gas powered engine, of course).    Kids nowadays might see <br/>
very few hand-powered tools or even instruments.   Even their parent&#39;s <br/>
acoustic guitar might have a pickup and an amp.   A friend of mine used to collect <br/>
electronic instruments when they first came out. He had an electronic saxophone <br/>
and guitar and even bagpipes.   You only had to touch the place where you <br/>
would have ordinarily have had to cover the hole completely, or only put your <br/>
fingers where the strings would have been, and strum across where the strings <br/>
would have been to make the sound.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know... I went on a little detour. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827129340">&quot;Maybe you just   meant you had to resist teaching them to read musical<br/>
notation.&quot;<br/>
Yup, that&#39;s what I meant.  I wanted to delve into how to read music and what the fingering was on<br/>
the clarinet for each note, but I resisted.  But like you said, I gave them the tip that an open<br/>
note E was a lot easier than covering the holes, I showed them where to put their hands, how to<br/>
hold their mouth and keep their cheeks in and breathe from their bellies and such.  I&#39;m still<br/>
trying to grasp the whole unschooling thing.  I&#39;ve tried to be a bit child-led by letting the kids<br/>
pick topics for unit studies, but we just started homeschooling in September and I&#39;m feeling my<br/>
way through it based on the kids&#39; reactions, so I&#39;m attempting to let go of &quot;teaching&quot; and grasp<br/>
the concept of being more of a facilitator and getting them interested in something other than TV.<br/>
 Not that all TV is bad, and I know it&#39;s ok to allow that sometimes, too, but they want to watch<br/>
soaps, and we don&#39;t have cable or PBS for all the good &quot;educational&quot; shows.  Unschooling sounds a<br/>
lot easier and better in the books I&#39;ve read than it is for me in real life. I&#39;ve read about kids<br/>
who were unschooled and do amazing things like building computers or playing concertos on the<br/>
piano, and my kids have no drive or interest in anything in particular (yet.)   And I don&#39;t know<br/>
whether or not to expect them to be great at something, but to just have an appreciation for<br/>
learning would be nice.  I have a lot of doubts sometimes and more &quot;Oh, no, what if I&#39;m not doing<br/>
enough!&quot; moments in the last month.  So maybe it&#39;s just me.  Maybe I&#39;m not seeing enough of what<br/>
they&#39;re doing to learn so I think it isn&#39;t happening.  But now I&#39;m just thinking out loud on the<br/>
keyboard and starting to ramble, so I&#39;ll leave it at that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input!<br/>

(We don&#39;t have cable either...)<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a DVD player?<br/>
<br/>
-=- Unschooling sounds a<br/>
lot easier and better in the books I&#39;ve read than it is for me in real <br/>
life.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to buy a different book?   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook">http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook</a><br/>
<br/>
You can read about my kids watching TV (among other things).<br/>
<br/>
-=-my kids have no drive or interest in anything in particular (yet.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes when people say &quot;drive&quot; they subconsciously mean &quot;desire to <br/>
create school-like projects spontaneously,&quot; so if you get a chance to look at <br/>
that &quot;drive&quot; maybe disassemble it and let the parts scatter out behind you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  And I don&#39;t know whether or not to expect them to be great at something, <br/>
but to just have an appreciation for learning would be nice. -=-<br/>
<br/>
What will help more, I&#39;m guessing (from prior experience more than from your <br/>
writing, not counting a clue or two), would be for you to continue your own <br/>
deschooling while they learn.   Somewhere in there you will develop an <br/>
appreciation for learning that doesn&#39;t look schoolish, and you&#39;ll see what they&#39;re <br/>
doing, even watching soaps, as part of their learning about everything in the <br/>
whole wide world.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Maybe I&#39;m not seeing enough of what<br/>

<br/>
Like that. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Now back to that TV idea of yours...<br/>
<br/>
-=-... and getting them interested in something other than TV.<br/>
Not that all TV is bad, and I know it&#39;s ok to allow that sometimes, too, <br/>
but...-=-<br/>
<br/>
When are these &quot;sometimes&quot; that it&#39;s ok to allow TV?<br/>
When are those times you&#39;re disallowing it?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to tell us, but maybe have a look here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
and see how some other people&#39;s thinking went.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t they play clarinet and watch TV at the same time?   <br/>
Can&#39;t they draw, paint, sort, build, play and watch TV at the same time? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952174110">In fact, start with the soaps, right now, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Do you watch with them? Do you talk about the people? Their  <br/>
decisions? What&#39;s probably going to happen next? What were the  <br/>
writers thinking? Soaps are GREAT for psychology and sociology  <br/>
discussions.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT could be more important than learning about human behavior?<br/>
<br/>
Well - there is also the whole &quot;writing&quot; side of soaps - what kind of  <br/>
writing does it entail - how is that different from writing a movie  <br/>
or a short story or a novel or ....?  How do the writers keep people  <br/>
&quot;hooked&quot; on the stories? (But be careful that you don&#39;t turn this  <br/>
into a &quot;language arts&quot; lesson - I almost hesitate to even mention  <br/>
this aspect of it.)<br/>
<br/>
Support their interest - don&#39;t try to distract AWAY from it.<br/>

How can you not have PBS!?<br/>
(We don&#39;t have cable either...)<br/>
We live in a mobile home with just a pair of rabbit ears.  I think the nearest PBS station is<br/>
about 150 miles away.  I was bummed at that when we moved here.  I miss Nova.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a DVD player? - yes, and we do watch a lot of movies.  We could afford cable if we<br/>
didn&#39;t go to Blockbuster so much, and the kids get more DVD&#39;s and VHS tapes than books most visits<br/>
to the library.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want to buy a different book?   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook">http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook</a> - I&#39;ll have to get it now, huh?<br/>
<br/>
You can read about my kids watching TV (among other things).<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes when people say &quot;drive&quot; they subconsciously mean &quot;desire to <br/>
create school-like projects spontaneously,&quot; so if you get a chance to look at <br/>
that &quot;drive&quot; maybe disassemble it and let the parts scatter out behind you. - <br/>
<br/>
point taken - I told you I&#39;m new at this whole concept!<br/>
<br/>
What will help more, I&#39;m guessing (from prior experience more than from your <br/>
writing, not counting a clue or two), would be for you to continue your own <br/>
deschooling while they learn.   Somewhere in there you will develop an <br/>
appreciation for learning that doesn&#39;t look schoolish, and you&#39;ll see what they&#39;re <br/>
doing, even watching soaps, as part of their learning about everything in the <br/>
whole wide world. - <br/>
<br/>
Oh, I am very aware that  I need to deschool.  I catch myself every day thinking about schoolish<br/>
things and I&#39;m sure there are other thoughts that I&#39;ve been so indoctrinated with that I don&#39;t<br/>
even realize I&#39;m thinking them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now back to that TV idea of yours...<br/>
<br/>
-=-... and getting them interested in something other than TV.<br/>
Not that all TV is bad, and I know it&#39;s ok to allow that sometimes, too, <br/>
but...-=-<br/>
<br/>
When are these &quot;sometimes&quot; that it&#39;s ok to allow TV? - well, since I still haven&#39;t tossed the<br/>
notion of &quot;school hours&quot;, I usually ask them to keep the TV off till after lunch.  Then they watch<br/>
game shows and soaps, since there isn&#39;t much else on.  They watched the new Herbie movie this<br/>
morning, though...  It&#39;s always ok to watch TV when I want to!  LOL!  I know I&#39;m sounding like a<br/>
hypocrite now, but I have my TV on in the bedroom while I fold laundry or make a to-do list or<br/>
they&#39;re busy doing something and I just watch Martha Stewart or The View or something.  And I<br/>
learn about food, recipes, crafts, current events, etc, when I watch, so why wouldn&#39;t they?  I&#39;m<br/>
getting it now.  I guess I was raised that TV fries kids&#39; brains and isn&#39;t good, and it&#39;s stuck<br/>
with me.  But I suppose my brain isn&#39;t fried, and I watch a few hours every day.<br/>
<br/>
When are those times you&#39;re disallowing it?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to tell us, but maybe have a look here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
and see how some other people&#39;s thinking went. - Ok, I told you anyway, and I read some of the<br/>
articles from the link.  I see the point now.  I guess I&#39;ll have to let go a bit more, eh?  <br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t they play clarinet and watch TV at the same time?   <br/>
Can&#39;t they draw, paint, sort, build, play and watch TV at the same time?   Yes, and they do.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sandra, for opening my mind up a bit more.  One day I&#39;ll get to where I want to be with<br/>
this, I hope.<br/>
