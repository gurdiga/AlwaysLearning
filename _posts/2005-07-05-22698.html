My dd is 14 and has been unschooling herself for 8 years.  She is a <br/>
competitive gymnast and works out 15 hours per week.  She also works at the <br/>
gym as much as she can.  She is very involved in 4-H.  She has held pretty <br/>
much every office available.  She raises goats and rabbits and auctions them <br/>
off.  She uses the money to then pay for some of her gymnastics expenses, <br/>
like camp, that were beyond our means.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly,  Adriane is a happy teenager.  She is funny, kind, honest. <br/>
She is the kid that her friends&#39; moms want to have around as a good <br/>
influence.  She is responsible and understanding.....and she can cuss like a <br/>
sailor when she is mad &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Would you mind talking about that &quot;rough early puberty&quot;?  My 12 yo son is <br/>
really having a tough time and we are haivng trouble balancing his right to <br/>
self-determination and the rest of the family&#39;s right to self-preservation. <br/>
My other kids have truly thrived with unschooling...it has been easy and <br/>
natural.  With Zach, I feel that I am always being backed into a corner by <br/>
the way he treats family members to be much more controlling than I want to <br/>
be, than I am with anyone else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wrote &quot;right after rough early puberty,&quot; but I didn&#39;t mean &quot;early puberty&quot; <br/>
(though it was a ambiguous, sorry).   I meant the rough early days of puberty.<br/>
<br/>
With my kids (probably with LOTS of kids), the early days of puberty <br/>
coincided with some frustration about feeling they didn&#39;t know all that the schoolkids <br/>
their age knew.   But once the throes of body growth were over, or at least <br/>
when they were accustomed to them, and their friends at school had started to <br/>
throw in the towel and envy their unschooled acquaintances, and they all had <br/>
moved into the phase where the company of other teens was more important than <br/>
&quot;being a good kid,&quot; then there came a comfortable and confident time.<br/>

If anything&#39;s happening &quot;always,&quot; change your strategy.    If what you&#39;re <br/>
saying or doing isn&#39;t working, what can you do differently?    Could you mediate <br/>
between him and others?   Role-play?   Reason/condition/negotiate?    Send him <br/>
to live with another family for a while?   (He might appreciate home more <br/>
when he gets back, or might have had time to think more clearly about what he <br/>
wants/needs.)<br/>

My kid (11) is too.  And I&#39;ll add in &quot;affectionate&quot;.  This seems to be a fine combination for charming grandparents.  Because, undoubtedly, the grandparents thought that homeschooling would lead to &quot;being different&quot; in a stigmatized and unpleasant way.  (I&#39;m sure this was a big boogeyman fear for them.)  Instead I provide them with a grandchild who is nicer and happier than average, and more comfortable talking to adults.  This seems to please them.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On our (ahem) interesting recent family camping trip,<br/>
which we take each year pretty much solely so that our<br/>
family can see the other extended families&#39; children<br/>
that we seldom get to see, there was some interesting<br/>
similar conversation about &quot;teens&quot; by the other<br/>
adults.  There were the typical meant to be amusing<br/>
comments about this or that person&#39;s uncomfortable<br/>
teen years, with no mention given to WHY they might<br/>
have been angry, or angsty or &quot;difficult.&quot;  There<br/>
followed the typical comments about this quality being<br/>
&quot;universal&quot; to all teens all over the world to be<br/>
cagey and sly and at emotional war with their parents.<br/>
 I kept my mouth shut, as that was the best response<br/>
in that setting with those people.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of these same adults are the ones who forced<br/>
their very well behaved 8 and 10 year old girls into<br/>
bed at an arbitrary time, crying, during a holiday<br/>
camping trip with seldom seen relatives they wanted to<br/>
see.  The 8 year old, who has more sauce in her than<br/>
her older sister, would climb in my lap and whisper to<br/>
me about wanting to stay up or steeling herself to not<br/>
be moved.  I was sympathetic, but unable to help her<br/>
escape.  The reason given was that they &quot;looked<br/>
exhausted&quot; and their parents &quot;won&#39;t have them being<br/>
cranky&quot; the next day.  Cranky and crying at bedtime is<br/>
preferable I guess.  Of course the adults were all<br/>
tired too, staying up too late to visit, and several<br/>
of them drinking far too much, but no one ordered them<br/>
to stop or go to bed.  My own boys (7 and 8) stayed up<br/>
as late as the wanted, as usual, and were not any more<br/>
or less cranky than anyone else.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This also brought to mind the overall bearing of my<br/>
aforementioned neices over the recent holiday:<br/>
reticent to talk to adults, hesitant to express their<br/>
desires, and in particular the case of the 8 year old,<br/>
usually looking forlorn and moody.  I had to coax her<br/>
to share her thoughts and needs, in whispers, when I<br/>
could tell she wanted something.  I&#39;m so sad for them<br/>
and wonder what it will be like as they get older and<br/>
more independent and able to assert themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s me as well Julie.  My 8 year old is high functioning <br/>
autistic, (or whatever label of the week, we don&#39;t really care <br/>
except to help him and us understand himself and his needs.)  I end <br/>
up having to give him more structure, but he&#39;s not able to ask for <br/>
it in so many words as other people&#39;s kids have.  He&#39;s very verbal, <br/>
but he has typical fuzzy high functioning autistic communication <br/>
problems with abstracts, social communication, awareness of his <br/>
needs and feelings, appropriateness with others verbally and <br/>
physically, stopping when someone says stop, and so forth.  He&#39;s <br/>
just happier and more balanced and better able to cope with the rest <br/>
of us with a bit more structure than I am comfortable giving him.  I <br/>
constantly wrestle with myself about not wanting to &quot;go there&quot; but <br/>
him needing me to.<br/>

We had this happen at a family birthday party/reunion with many of the teens<br/>
sitting in with the group. When the above comment and others like it were<br/>
made I spoke up to say how very cool and unlike that I found my teenager to<br/>
be. It was just enough to make the conversation stop momentarily and head<br/>
back more in a positive vein even though I ultimately got the &quot;you are just<br/>
lucky then&quot; speech and the roll of the eyes to indicate the tough stuff was<br/>
yet to come. <br/>
