<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313817692">Hi all, <br/>
I&#39;m pretty much just a lurker here though some of you may know me from other lists. I have a blog ( see link in my sig line) that is pretty much about our day to day life as unschoolers. I haven&#39;t been at it for too long, but there are already some examples of what our days &quot;look&quot; like., and as time goes on there will be more. Your all welcome to check it out.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; I was interested in what others&#39; unschooling days looked like and for some <br/>
  creative unschooling ideas.  I wonder if it will get to that?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Some good days are collected here:<br/>

<br/>
  Creative  unschooling ideas are easier to come by yourself after you see what <br/>
  other families are doing, so I think that page would help.<br/>
