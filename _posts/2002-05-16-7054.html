&lt;&lt; Is it possible to NOT carry around sand? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL!! I have some embedded in my eardrums I think.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;ps Ren, I think you are homesick for Alaska&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Am I that transparent??!  Actually, I have a love/hate affair with that damn <br/>
state. It gets into your blood like lust and you can&#39;t get it out, but I <br/>
dread the thought of ever having to live there again. Fortunately my dh is <br/>
not attracted to it at ALL, so I won&#39;t be moving there any time soon.<br/>
I think once you&#39;ve lived places you love, there&#39;s always somewhere to miss. <br/>
I miss parts of the NW...the food, the progressive ideas, the <br/>
mountains....sigh.<br/>
But I am happy living here. I need the beach at this point in my life, and <br/>
the small town life.<br/>
