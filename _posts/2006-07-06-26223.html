<div id="ygrps-yiv-284868070">&lt;&lt;I think there was an article about them a while back in Life  Learning, <br/>
wasn&#39;t there?<br/>
<br/>
Here it is--more recent than I thought it  was: <br/>

This  was a nice follow-up!<br/>

I wrote the paper letting them know that I enjoyed the article.  As a  former <br/>
foster child and now unschooler my self I felt like I knew them though I  <br/>
have never met them. It&#39;s funny bc  the article never said  unschooling however <br/>
to me it sang of unschooling hints esp around  here. I also like that she is a <br/>
social worker. Another paving the way in a  system that needs an eye opener on <br/>
what really matters.<br/>
