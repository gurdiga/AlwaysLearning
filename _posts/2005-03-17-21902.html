How do  you deal with it when you have completely lost the picture and ranted <br/>
and  raved or do you not get to that stage.  I have had 8 teeth out and feel  <br/>
really ruff and like a little girl in need of what I never got as a child <br/>
care  and sympathy so have lost the plot completely.  How do I now deal with  the <br/>
fall out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=================<br/>
 <br/>
Ask for help, from inside or outside the family.  When did you have  the <br/>
teeth out?  You ARE in need of care and sympathy.  That&#39;s not your  imagination.  <br/>
Marty had eight out last Monday, and so I&#39;m freshly  reminded.<br/>
 <br/>
As to the other, explain and apologize. Apologize and make up for it after  <br/>
you feel better.  Tell them you&#39;re afraid, if you are.  Tell them it  hurts, if <br/>
it does.    Find someone(s) to hang out with your kids  so you can sleep it <br/>
off some, or to bring you soup or other soft  food.   <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Apologize and be grateful.  <br/>
 <br/>
Having 8 teeth out is not a picnic.  Ask for what you need.   Don&#39;t expect <br/>
others to read your mind, even though it may seem obvious to  you.  After you <br/>
apologize, make a list of the things you are grateful for,  and pass it around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983874517">Thank you for all your replies to my Bad Mum post, I have realised that the moon affects me and that as the full moon gets closer I find life very difficult. It is like a drawing out of my issues and making me face them. I am also more racked with pain at this time too. It is also the time when my 2ds seem to be at they&#39;re most productive in questioning life and my DH is at his lowest. Have others found the moon has an influence on them and their offspring.<br/>
