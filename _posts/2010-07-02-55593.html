<div id="ygrps-yiv-315243424">A couple of weeks ago, Logan (4 next month) and I were having lunch at a nearby restaurant and looking out the window.  A school bus drove by which led to his question, &quot;hey mom, what&#39;s school?&quot; I told him that school is a place that some parents send their kids to during the day to learn stuff.  He then asked me what kind of things are in school, to which I told him desks, teachers, other kids, books, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to be as neutral as possible when answering his questions but I&#39;m wondering if I am being neutral.  For any of you who&#39;s kids didn&#39;t go to school, how did you answer their questions?  A lot of random strangers have been asking Logan if he goes to school or when he will be going and he gives them a blank stare.  I usually say he doesn&#39;t go to school and leave it at that (he&#39;s not yet 4!).  In the back of my mind, I&#39;m a smidgen nervous that he might want to go, although he&#39;s pretty afraid of big groups of kids and doesn&#39;t like to be apart from me.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m over-thinking the whole thing.<br/>

bothering her that the neighbor kids were constantly talking about their <br/>
teachers. By spring, I was a little concerned she&#39;d want to go to school <br/>
just for that. But we signed her up for a 5-day, 2 hours per day, nature <br/>
center class during spring break time and that was all she needed. She <br/>
didn&#39;t even go every day. But she talked about &quot;My Teacher&quot; for a couple <br/>
of years after that.<br/>

The author wrote the book to make money off unschoolers.  She decided  <br/>
quickly and early on that she wasn&#39;t an unschooler.  At that point she  <br/>
was already set up to speak at  conference, and she did, and it had  <br/>
nothing at all to do with unschooling.  I was dismayed that she had  <br/>
used that book to get a foot in the door (and make some money) but  <br/>
that it didn&#39;t reflect her beliefs or practices.<br/>
<br/>
I did let this post through, and I bought a copy of the book when it  <br/>
was new, thinking I was being supportive of another unschooling family.<br/>

<br/>
Making a contract with your inner child to go away and leave you alone.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t sound at all like the path to wholeness or acceptance or  <br/>
healing.  I&#39;ve seen lots of people come to peace with childhood hurts  <br/>
and sorrow by being good parents, and by being more integrated within  <br/>
themselves, rather than compartmentalized.<br/>
<br/>
This presentation had to do with compartmentalization and then divorce/ <br/>
separation from the child.  Not healthy, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were the middle of the group at the wall farthest from the  <br/>
doors, and she was disturbed and antsy first.  If it had been a video,  <br/>
she would already have paused it and been saying &quot;WHAT!?&quot;  And she was  <br/>
17.<br/>
Pam came in before we left, and sat in the front near a door.  She  <br/>
stayed, but didn&#39;t really want to.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a negative about someone who&#39;s also a speaker going to another  <br/>
speaker&#39;s talk.  If you want to leave, it&#39;s noticed.  So I felt bad  <br/>
for her that we were getting up and leaving, and hoped it would get  <br/>
better, but I don&#39;t think it did.<br/>
<br/>
Also she refused to allow it to be recorded (as other speakers&#39; talks  <br/>
were recorded), because it&#39;s a service for sale, this &quot;contract.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like unschooling conferences being a platform for people&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;therapy&quot; businesses, for lots of reasons.  I think all the  <br/>
discussions should be by unschoolers and about unschooling.  Sometimes  <br/>
there are sensible exceptions, but when the person has already  <br/>
declared &quot;NOT an unschooler&quot; in public (even a barely-read blog is in  <br/>
public), AND is not talking about unschooling and it&#39;s something that  <br/>
will do more harm than good to the parent of a young child, I&#39;m  <br/>
saddened.<br/>
<br/>
For the several-eth time lately, I rejected a request for someone to  <br/>
post something on this list that wasn&#39;t about unschooling, really.  It  <br/>
was a questionnaire/survey about how kids learned their times tables.   <br/>
There was something similar the other day, some study or putative  <br/>
research.  No, I said.  Not appropriate.  Not the purpose of the  <br/>
list.   The reason there IS a list that stays on topic (95% of the  <br/>
time or more, I think) is that I have been unwilling to wander off and  <br/>
say &quot;whatever.&quot;  A dozen other lists have been either abandoned at one  <br/>
time or another and picked up by others with different beliefs and  <br/>
priorities, or the owners find themselves too &quot;friendly&quot; to say no to  <br/>
people who are being &quot;friendly&quot; and it becomes a wad of friendly vague  <br/>
friendliness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unwilling to gather unschoolers together and then offer them up to  <br/>
be measured or tested.<br/>
Maybe one line parents could offer their kids is &quot;My parents don&#39;t  <br/>
believe in testing.&quot;<br/>
That will answer a lot of questions.  And if the questioner starts on  <br/>
&quot;How do you spell...&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s XtimesWhatever&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s the  <br/>
capital of South Dakota?&quot; The kid can say, &quot;Are you testing me?  My  <br/>
parents don&#39;t believe in testing.&quot;   Whether they know the answer or  <br/>
not, it&#39;s not anyone else&#39;s business whether they know that, unless  <br/>
the other person is offering them a job for money spelling or  <br/>
multiplying or knowing the capital of South Dakota.<br/>
<br/>
They wouldn&#39;t ask their adult friends, unless they actually needed to  <br/>
know.<br/>

that if I whisper something to someone sitting next to me the speaker <br/>
might notice and think I&#39;m commenting on them. I&#39;m more likely saying, <br/>
&quot;I need to go to the bathroom right after this,&quot; because I don&#39;t feel <br/>

speaker.<br/>

<br/>
And if their adult friend didn&#39;t know the answer to their question, most people wouldn&#39;t then assume their friend had not been &quot;taught&quot; properly; it would just be something their friend didn&#39;t know, or had forgotten - unlike when people quiz kids, when an &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; means the child has been horribly disadvantaged by unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Oy. It makes me think about testing: WHEN will someone be completely stranded, alone, without phone access and unable to look up information, and to know the &#39;right&#39; answer *right then* will be vital?! WHY can&#39;t kids look up answers to test questions? WHY can&#39;t they ask for help? No one lives their general real lives that way. Highly specialized workers do, sometimes, where they need to have been tested to know they know. (I&#39;m thinking of surgeons.) But for most folks? The answer is nearly always close, and almost never vitally important in one second. Tests have nothing to do with most of real life. Unless you&#39;re in school.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;ve never heard the &quot;My parents don&#39;t believe in testing&quot; response before. I LOVE that!<br/>
