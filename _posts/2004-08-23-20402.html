Does she like apples? Chewing on apple slices can help cleanse the teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Along the same lines, I have and older child who doesn&#39;t brush his teeth. He<br/>
knows the possible consequences, but has not suffered any of them...yet.<br/>
What are some unschooling thoughts about hygiene/health in older kids? When<br/>
it comes to teeth, the cost of not brushing can be high, and seeing as he<br/>
has no income, ultimately I will be paying the dental bill. But at the same<br/>
time, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll really understand the consequences until he goes<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250469228">It&#39;s important to me that my kids brush their teeth daily.  One reason is<br/>
that I am pretty sure they would really stress about having their cavities<br/>
filled.  They aren&#39;t overly thrilled with the dentist to begin with.<br/>
Brushing before bed is a habit that we&#39;ve all gotten into and I don&#39;t have<br/>
to remind them very often.  Morning brushing takes a reminder most days<br/>
because they are busy playing.  I have found that making it a request rather<br/>
than a demand works much better.  &quot;Would you be willing to brush your teeth<br/>
now?  We&#39;ll be leaving in a few minutes.&quot;   I&#39;ve told them my concern about<br/>
them getting cavities (and they&#39;ve looked in my mouth!) so I know that they<br/>
know my concern so I don&#39;t repeat it all the time.<br/>
Asking instead of telling makes a difference here.  We all seem to hate<br/>
being *told* what to do.  No one seems to mind being reminded or asked.   On<br/>
the rare occasion when they really don&#39;t want to stop and brush, I&#39;ll<br/>
sometime bring their toothbrush into the room where they are and ask if I<br/>
can do a quick brushing for them.  I don&#39;t use toothpaste so they don&#39;t have<br/>
to go spit it out.  They&#39;ve never refused.  They usually don&#39;t want to do it<br/>
because they are just too busy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556562715">Since my DH has tons of fillings as did my dad & my brother we felt <br/>
tooth brushing was necessary!!<br/>
<br/>
So we gave choices!! We had a choice of two toothbrushes & a choice <br/>
of two toothpastes. Also a choice of brushing before or after reading <br/>
a story, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It helped when they were little to sing a silly little song about <br/>
getting rid of the cavity dudes. Also I would say, &quot;Let&#39;s see what <br/>
you had for dinner. Oh my goodness I see that you had orange carrots. <br/>
Look there are green peas up on the top there, better get those out <br/>
of there. Hey did you know that there are purple grapes on the <br/>
bottom!!&quot;. We would also pretend to be certain animals to open our <br/>
mouths wide like an alligator or roaring like a lion.  Also we <br/>
modelled the behaviour of toothbrushing & we would brush eachother&#39;s <br/>
teeth. (Only works if adult doesn&#39;t have an overly sensitive gag <br/>
reflex!! ha!!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sung to &quot;Row, row, row your boat&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Brush, brush, brush our teeth<br/>
Brush our teeth today.<br/>
<br/>
Brush all those cavity dudes,<br/>
Brush them all away!!<br/>
<br/>
The older kids brush as they basically see DH&#39;s mess in his mouth. Go <br/>
to the dentist with everyone so the dentist is excellent & explains <br/>
why DH has all the cavities & they watch as he gets them repaired, <br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
Oh I had my first & only cavity filled this year!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560727297">I was in a skiing accident as a teenager, hitting my front tooth with a <br/>
pole, had infections due to the nerve damage, and ultimately lost that <br/>
tooth... I wear a prosthetic tooth which my kids know they don&#39;t want, <br/>
they have respect for the teeth they have and plan to take care of <br/>
them... this is different from lack of care, but I also have plenty of <br/>
other teeth with fillings or cavities, they look in my mouth and count <br/>
the &quot;spots&quot;... we met a homeless man who had none of his front teeth on <br/>
top, and when the kids asked him how he lost his teeth, they could not <br/>
understand his speech well enough to get the answer... I think they are <br/>
used to seeing people with teeth, and that experience showed being <br/>
without teeth as negative... we don&#39;t make the kids brush but when ask <br/>
if they did it&#39;s yes or they just go on their own and do it right <br/>
then... they are good at knowing when they are getting tired and brush <br/>
first, then read or whatever in bed until they fall asleep with the <br/>
lights on... I think the no bedtime rules in our family take the stress <br/>
out of brushing teeth?<br/>

Any ideas for a 15 year old? One who has had three open-heart surgeries (the<br/>
last one in June), falls under the category of high functioning autistic (I<br/>
am only using the label so that I don&#39;t waste time trying to describe the<br/>
personality elements that effect him on this list) who has seemed to lose<br/>
his caring about his teeth. He wouldn&#39;t appreciate songs and fun stuff, and<br/>
even when I give him his toothbrush ready to go so that it doesn&#39;t interrupt<br/>
him, he takes it but doesn&#39;t do it. It seems to have only become a &quot;chore&quot;<br/>
for him since his last surgery (which, as much as we did to make the<br/>
situation as good as it could have been, was terribly traumatic). He has<br/>
long term negative physical effects from the surgery as well, and I think he<br/>
is just taking a break on everything. Do you think it is okay to sacrifice<br/>
his teeth while he continues to recover? We&#39;re being there for him in every<br/>
way, but I wondered if there were teenagers out there who refused to brush<br/>
their teeth and what advice (from those of you with or without teenagers...I<br/>
take all insight!) you may have.<br/>

<br/>
There are nicer ways to say it.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to tell my sister &quot;Irene, your breath smells like a gut wagon.&quot;<br/>
I heard her say it many times, just like that, as though she had never said <br/>
it before.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has bad breath sometimes, and I say, &quot;Have you brushed your teeth <br/>
already?&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m going to brush my teeth, do you want to go?&quot; or &quot;Do you have any <br/>
of that gum you bought the other day?&quot;   It&#39;s a hint, and she gets it, and I <br/>
haven&#39;t put a recording of an insult in her head.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known people who never brushed their teeth and didn&#39;t have bad breath <br/>
and didn&#39;t have cavites.   There are other factors, and not brushing doesn&#39;t <br/>
guarantee teeth falling out of heads.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215565510">You probably already know this - but I&#39;m new there so just have to <br/>
share - there is a list for &quot;homeschooling&quot; in the autistic specturm <br/>
at groups.yahoo.com/group/ASLearningAtHome   so perhaps they have <br/>
some insight for you. I just joined there because of my 2 nephews in <br/>
the spectum and a new friend in the same town, I hope they&#39;re not <br/>
too &quot;schooly&quot; but I&#39;m gonna find out because I need some resources. <br/>
Anyhow - I&#39;m luckly that my 6yo likes to brush his teeth in the <br/>
morning (it&#39;s something he doesn on his own after dayd goes to work -<br/>
 he thought of it himself) and sometimes additionally when he sees <br/>
someone else do it. Once he gave me a big smaking kiss a few months <br/>
ago and his breath was rank so I did tell him politely (something <br/>
like &quot;your breath smells kindof yucky - have you brushed your teeth <br/>
lately?&quot;) about it and he went immediately and bushed and then gave <br/>
me another big kiss. Believe it or not that approach also works with <br/>
husbands - have had to use it a few times myself - ewwwwwwww! Moza</div>

 </span></blockquote>It may have some bearing on your son&#39;s mental state too, that after a <br/>
physical opening of the body cavity (open heart surgery) a person&#39;s body chemistry is <br/>
almost identical to that of someone diagnosed as &quot;clinically depressed.&quot;  Our <br/>
family was shocked to learn this after my grandmother, who was normally a <br/>
very dynamic/positive/pro-active person, had open heart surgery and REALLY seemed <br/>
to give up on life.  Like your son she was disinterested in her teeth and <br/>
other personal hygene and lifelong habits of cleanliness.  Her doctors only <br/>
informed us how common this was AFTER we had struggled with it for months and ASKED <br/>
THEM! (It sure would have helpe us to know in advance!)  Anyway, what we <br/>
found worked was exposing my grandmother to any experience/activity which produced <br/>
happy feelings.  There&#39;s a chemical change in the body when experiencing <br/>
&quot;good&quot; emotions which counteracts the chemistry of depression.  You might consider <br/>
laying off the teeth issue just now and work on intense affirmations with <br/>
your son until things turn around because even implying that your son *should be* <br/>
doing something, which he isn&#39;t up to doing yet, may be contributing to <br/>
negative feelings of failure or at least inadaquacy.  Not really helpful just now.  <br/>
Plus, most tooth decay takes a fairly long period of time to get REALLY bad.  <br/>
(I have a dentist in the family who we disappoint regularly by going WAY <br/>
longer between visits than we *should!*  lol!)  You should have time for reversing <br/>
anything caused by this relatively short period of neglect.<br/>
<br/>
I feel for your son having to go through this.  Its a really radical <br/>
experience for the physical body to undergo--not to mention the psyche.  Love, love, <br/>
love and pleasant experiences are what worked for us with my gran.  Just like <br/>
learning happening best when you&#39;re happy, healing and lots of other good <br/>
things happen then as well.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There&#39;s a chemical change in the body when experiencing <br/>
&quot;good&quot; emotions which counteracts the chemistry of depression.  You might <br/>
consider <br/>
laying off the teeth issue just now and work on intense affirmations with <br/>
your son &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What does he like?  What has ever made him laugh?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he needs happy music, a new kitten, Three Stooges movies.<br/>
<br/>
With depression, negativity makes it worse, so try not to rag on him.<br/>

Anyway, what we <br/>
found worked was exposing my grandmother to any experience/activity which produced <br/>
happy feelings.  There&#39;s a chemical change in the body when experiencing <br/>
&quot;good&quot; emotions which counteracts the chemistry of depression.**<br/>
<br/>
Possibilities:  sunshine, physical movement, being with someone you love who is expressing it, smiling, listening to music.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s even one study (tho&#39; I can&#39;t cite it) that shows that &quot;grimacing&quot; in a smile like shape several times a day releases much of the same feel-good chemicals as actually smiling.  But actual smiling would be preferable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760391225">Thank you all for your thoughtful suggestions for us regarding our guy<br/>
Andrew and his teeth/surgery recovery. We do some of the things mentioned,<br/>
and are incorporating more. I love that all of your suggestions involve love<br/>
and fun...the perfect healing elements for such a challenging time.<br/>
<br/>
Related thought: Andrew very much wanted to go to an art high school this<br/>
year that he had picked out before his surgery. He tried the first day of<br/>
school and was sick by the end of the day. He slowly gave up on this idea,<br/>
though not in a way that felt &quot;successful&quot; to him. We talked about this, and<br/>
he has had some great raging sessions. Day by day though he seems lighter<br/>
and happier. Yesterday, when he normally would have been in school, we<br/>
spontaneously went to see the movie Collateral (movies...a great love of<br/>
his...he&#39;s just finishing a script for a scary dark comedy that you may all<br/>
see on the big screen someday soon :0). He giggled almost the whole way<br/>
there at this relinquished taste of freedom. He has since said to hell with<br/>
school and has delved completely into his movie. I&#39;m sure it will be filled<br/>
with blood and guts and people getting cut open without their permission.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you for the reminders about what&#39;s important. We were really<br/>
stuck on this one. We were struggling with the idea of letting another part<br/>
of his body go downhill, but you&#39;ve reminded us to trust our instincts that<br/>
his mind and soul take precedence right now.<br/>
