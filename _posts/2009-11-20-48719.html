<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403432723">Here is the situation in a nutshell:<br/>
<br/>
My boys love to be at home...this is a good thing, I know this....however sometimes I really want to do things with them like we used to like skating, swimming, going to the park etc....they really enjoyed those activities but for some reason they have no desire to leave the house.  The last month has been spent solely at home (due to illness and buying a wii)  This is fine...but I miss getting out with them and enjoying different activities with them.  Today I suggested skating and got a positive response....until it was time to leave and then was met with I dont want to go.  Our wii has been on from the moment they wake up til the moment they go to sleep these days and I tried explaining that it would still be here when they got back...<br/>
<br/>
Of course we didnt go....but I still felt disappointed and frustrated.  I know that I need to let this go and just embrace their interests and enjoy doing what they are enjoying...any suggestions???<br/>

<br/>
The Wii is new.  Period.  New video games can trump old skating rinks.<br/>
<br/>
For getting out, it might help to be meeting someone there, or picking  <br/>
a friend up on the way.  But don&#39;t do that just for no other reason  <br/>
than to get them away from the Wii.<br/>
<br/>

I do have suggestions!   Look in the corners of your frustration.  Is  <br/>
it that you want them to pay attention to you?  Or that you want to  <br/>
feel like a great unschooler?  (a worthy desire) or do you miss going  <br/>
out of the house?  Or do you miss other people?<br/>
<br/>
You could invite others over, to play Wii, or to have lunch, or to  <br/>
watch a movie with you (if the Wii isn&#39;t on the only good movie-TV).<br/>
You could take one child out with you while another stays home and  <br/>
plays Wii, if there&#39;s another adult to be home.<br/>
You could spend the frustrated feelings thinking of other things to do  <br/>
someday when the Wii isn&#39;t so new.<br/>
You could practice breathing and being mindful.  My sister just told  <br/>
me excitedly that she&#39;s only having to pay $35 a week for her  <br/>
counsellor and she really likes him and he&#39;s having her think about  <br/>
mindfulness, about her feelings and emotions, and about waiting before  <br/>
she responds.<br/>
<br/>
Here, free.  Not even $35.<br/>
