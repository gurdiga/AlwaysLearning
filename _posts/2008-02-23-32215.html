<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601212942">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list - sort of.  I&#39;ve been lurking and learning for a <br/>
little while now but I&#39;ve never posted.  I have a 5 yr old daughter and <br/>
my son is 3 3/4.  We&#39;re having a blast together and I&#39;m so grateful to <br/>
have found and read three of John Holt&#39;s books last year.  Unschooling <br/>
just makes so much sense to me.  I&#39;m happy to have found out about it <br/>
while my children are still so young.  My question concerns conflicting <br/>
interests of my children at times and how to deal with them.  If one <br/>
wants to go somewhere, say an event with a set time, and the other <br/>
isn&#39;t really into leaving the house at the particular time of the event <br/>
because they are involved in something, what would be a good way to <br/>
deal with the situation?  <br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Marcia</div>

Find another family to leave one with, or a babysitter, or find an  <br/>
activity when the dad is home, or start preparing early to get out of  <br/>
the house, or do another activity on the way there that the secondary  <br/>
kid DOES want to do, or invite a third child to go with you to change  <br/>
the dynamics.<br/>
<br/>
Those are some of the things I&#39;ve done.  Mine were five, three and  <br/>
newborn.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to remember is to make it ALL happy and funny and  <br/>
comfortable and exciting so that they want to be with you.  Be sparkly.<br/>
