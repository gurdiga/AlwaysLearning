<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527133018">I can&#39;t believe I figured it out!  I put a picture of me and my <br/>
family in the photos.<br/>
I&#39;m planning on going to the conference in the fall, in SC, so I <br/>
thought it would be nice to be a somewhat familiar face to you who <br/>
are going.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s up with the Maryland get together?<br/>
I&#39;m going to be in FL from the 20th to the 1st of March, so any time <br/>
after that is good for me.<br/>
I&#39;m willing to travel!<br/>
