I couldn&#39;t get all fifteen in one photo. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THANKS whoever knew about the spider lilly.   Blades are coming up.   I moved <br/>
it.   There was a single bulb, but it was big and rooty. &lt;g&gt;   Maye it will <br/>
split next year.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I should be asleep.   I dibsed the bed in the back of the van, and have <br/>
been up doing last-minute trip preparation, like, uh... taking and posting <br/>
photos of our record number of moonflowers.   We&#39;re going to miss some big <br/>
nights, but when we get back they should still be there.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I sleep to Oklahoma, but I might only make Texas.<br/>
