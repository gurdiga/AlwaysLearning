 </span></blockquote>This past weekend my hubby and I had a great time.<br/>
We arranged for our boys to spend the night at their grandpa&#39;s house (my<br/>
FIL) for the first time.<br/>
We went out for dinner with my sister, her boyfriend and my other sister,<br/>
and afterwards went to a comedy nightclub. A night out with adults! We had a<br/>
lot of fun and it seemed to make us feel like the old &quot;us&quot; couple - before<br/>
kids - at least for a while.<br/>
We felt like we reconnected and my dh really appreciated being able to spend<br/>
time with me without the kids.<br/>
My FIL really appreciated spending time with the boys and getting to know<br/>
them better, too.<br/>
It&#39;s nice that we can do this because I feel better leaving the kids because<br/>
they&#39;re getting older now (9 & 11). I felt uncomfortable leaving them when<br/>
they were younger.<br/>
