<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118884246">First off I want to thank Sandra for her website (thank you, Sandra!)<br/>
I have been scouring it and soaking it up. I will admit that having<br/>
now met you in &quot;person&quot; on-line, I was a bit nervous and excited (THE<br/>
Sandra Dodd????) I had heard about your site from other unschooler<br/>
forums, but somehow never got the link to any you were on until the<br/>
NING site where your name appeared and I went &quot;Hey - I know that name!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will say I feel somewhat less educated compared to you (I<br/>
would use the &quot;s&quot; word, but since I know how you feel about that now,<br/>
I&#39;ll refrain!) I hope that someday I&#39;ll feel as confidant as you sound<br/>
in your posts. <br/>
<br/>
This whole concept of changing the way we think in order to change the<br/>
way we parent and allow our children the freedom to be and learn is<br/>
still a process I&#39;m growing through.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ironic. When I was little, my mom didn&#39;t like us saying those<br/>
silly children&#39;s clapping rhymes because she said words are powerful<br/>
and the ones we were saying were not good (Mama, Mama, I&#39;m so sick,<br/>
call the doctor quick quick quick...Doctor, doctor, will I die? Count<br/>
to five and you&#39;ll be alive!)<br/>
<br/>
And yet here I am, fully adult, and once again finding out how<br/>
powerful words can be, though obviously in a different fashion. And to<br/>
be honest, I will admit my first knee-jerk reaction is: this is not<br/>
fun. Now I have to THINK before I can just say what I want!<br/>
<br/>
But hopefully I&#39;ll get over it and just learn!<br/>
<br/>
Second, to everyone:<br/>
<br/>
What has the journey of your spouse or partner looked like as you have<br/>
traveled the unschooling path?<br/>
<br/>
My DH is very supportive of it (remember, he&#39;s a public school social<br/>
studies teacher, mostly seniors, and a head football coach.) He hasn&#39;t<br/>
read any of the books (not a book reader) or gone to any of the sites,<br/>
due to time. So I just relay the info I find to him, and he totally<br/>
agrees with me, which is good.<br/>
<br/>
But then comes the parenting stuff, which I&#39;m not totally great at,<br/>
yet. I try very hard to guide my children peacefully, and I know I do<br/>
better than I would have if I had never heard of unschooling. But I<br/>
have a long way to go. <br/>
<br/>
DH (Jim, it&#39;s easier) doesn&#39;t get the benefit of sitting down 3 hours<br/>
a night to read all the stuff I do, and he isn&#39;t here during the day<br/>
to see how I might react in certain situations. So when the kids do<br/>
something that is very normal for kids, he&#39;ll react in a very &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
parent-type way. Sometimes I do, too. But when I catch myself, he&#39;ll<br/>
of course still be reacting the same way. And I don&#39;t want to chide<br/>
him, because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s any better than putting down the<br/>
child, but I&#39;m not sure how to explain to him all the stuff I&#39;ve<br/>
gathered in the short time that we actually get to talk (over the kids<br/>
chatter, of course, since he&#39;s only home for a few hours before HE<br/>
goes to bed around 8 or 9...getting up at 5 to get work done at school<br/>
before his football boys come in for their morning weight lift.)<br/>
<br/>
Overall he&#39;s a GREAT father, and wonderful husband. I count my<br/>
blessings daily! And since I&#39;m still working on MY end of the<br/>
parenting scale, I can&#39;t expect him to be perfect. <br/>
<br/>
So what did you all do, or DO you do? Did you dh&#39;s or partners read<br/>
everything you did? Or do you sit down and talk about it?<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m hitting on some key elements that finally clicked for me<br/>
tonight, as I was trying to explain some stuff to him, and then he<br/>
asked me, &quot;Well, what happens when the kid goes off and does something<br/>
really stupid, then?&quot; I replied that, I THINK, the whole point is that<br/>
in respectful families, the kids have NO NEED to do anything stupid.<br/>
But I&#39;d ask....<br/>
<br/>
And then I thought of parents I know whose kids bite or hit other<br/>
kids, and I wondered how you all would handle that if it were YOUR<br/>
child...<br/>
<br/>
And then I read Sandra&#39;s site on sibling fights, and I think I found<br/>
an answer, sort of...<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s maybe not a certain way of handling it, but it&#39;s about looking<br/>
at how your child would WANT you to handle it (not in the silly,<br/>
doubter&#39;s head sort of way where one might think, &quot;well, he&#39;s a kid,<br/>
he&#39;ll want to get away with it!&quot;) because I&#39;m beginning to see that&#39;s<br/>
not true. He WANTS to do good, and doesn&#39;t know how to handle the<br/>
feelings he has, and he needs MY help to figure out a way to properly<br/>
handle those strong, and justified, feelings.<br/>
<br/>
And the part (don&#39;t remember if Sandra or someone she was quoting said<br/>
it) about LETTING yourself (as an adult) process your feelings instead<br/>
of trying to STOP the anger, to let it come, realize why it&#39;s there,<br/>
then let it go, might actually help HIM personally. He is a person who<br/>
reacts before he thinks sometimes, and never hurts people, but usually<br/>
says things he doesn&#39;t mean, or throws his tools or something. And he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to do it, but doesn&#39;t know how to stop. So maybe this<br/>
will help him!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again, and any advice you have for Dad would be wonderful!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993806606">Thanks for that interesting email, it gave me plenty of food for <br/>
thought. I do not consider myself an unschooler YET, but I&#39;m slowly <br/>
travelling down that path.<br/>
<br/>
You see, my husband is Egyptian and comes from a culture where <br/>
homeschooling is virtually non-existent and almost guaranteed to lead <br/>
to a life of unemployment and poverty. I&#39;ve wanted to homeschool my <br/>
children since my first marriage over ten years ago. When I <br/>
remarried, I set right to work at showing Hesham (I guess DH is <br/>
easier in this case, LOL) the virtues of homeschooling. I hammered it <br/>
into him at every opportunity. After three years, our first daughter <br/>
was born and now that she&#39;s going to turn four, he wouldn&#39;t have it <br/>
any other way (SCORE!)<br/>
<br/>
Now for unschooling. Right now, I&#39;m using Calvert K with DD. I don&#39;t <br/>
consider it forced schooling since 1. she&#39;s gifted (no doubt about <br/>
that) and 2, she LOVES doing the work. She begs to do it and if I <br/>
can&#39;t one day, she&#39;ll ask about it all day. I plan on finishing off <br/>
the curriculum, then go more towards interest-lead learning in the <br/>
form of unit studies (informally). I plan on using a curriculum for <br/>
math however. It&#39;s taken so much work trying to get DH convinced that <br/>
homeschooling is not only the best way, but the only way. I don&#39;t <br/>
want to push it with him. I can justify unschooling with the rest of <br/>
her education, but I feel like I&#39;d lose his support when it comes to <br/>
math. Secondly, I have medical conditions that might make it <br/>
impossible to follow her closely (and my other daughter, for that <br/>
matter) in the future. Should the case ever arise that (God forbid) <br/>
I&#39;m no longer around, I want her to be able to take up learning under <br/>
someone else&#39;s tutelage or a school (again, God forbid) without too <br/>
much grief. This is the one area I know she might lack otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I know many of you will have your opinions on this and I welcome <br/>
them. I&#39;d like to fully unschool her, but I also need to resolve it <br/>
with my life&#39;s circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rambling!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well thanks, I guess.   Don&#39;t use the s word; sheesh!  I&#39;ve been  <br/>
thinking about this stuff (learning and parenting) since about 1956,  <br/>
so a lot of it experience and a large factor is cerebral  <br/>
hyperactivity.  I try to aim it in a good direction and use my   <br/>
outpourings for good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you found the unschooling site and that you like it.  Many  <br/>
people have contributed the cloth from which I made that oversized  <br/>
quilt, and I keep adding to it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I was little, my mom didn&#39;t like us saying those<br/>
<br/>
silly children&#39;s clapping rhymes because she said words are powerful<br/>

call the doctor quick quick quick...Doctor, doctor, will I die? Count<br/>
to five and you&#39;ll be alive!)-=-<br/>
<br/>
My mom flipped out once when I was three or four or so and was  <br/>
playing by myself with dolls and one doll said to the other &quot;Where&#39;s  <br/>
Papaw?&quot; and another doll answered &quot;Papaw&#39;s dead.&quot;  I was playing with  <br/>
the idea, and I think I didn&#39;t have a doll that could have  <br/>
represented him, and I was playing by myself as usual and she went  <br/>
off and said this and some: &quot;What if he dies?  You&#39;ll feel terrible!   <br/>
Don&#39;t EVER say you wish someone were dead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until many years later that I pieced together (speaking of  <br/>
quilts) that she had wished her brother would die, and he did.  She  <br/>
didn&#39;t cause rheumatic fever (nor rural poverty and the state of  <br/>
medicine in the 1930&#39;s), but she felt guilty, I guess, and wasn&#39;t  <br/>
talking about the what and why.  So her personal state of emotional  <br/>
outpouring was hurting other people.    Life is better now, I think,  <br/>
in that the idea of psychology and self-knowledge isn&#39;t in the  <br/>
category of sinful self-indulgent nonsense anymore.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And to<br/>
<br/>
be honest, I will admit my first knee-jerk reaction is: this is not<br/>
fun. Now I have to THINK before I can just say what I want!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oooh!!  Is it like the cartoon here?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m always interested in knowing why these ideas get people cranky  <br/>
before it gets them euphoric.  I think the ideas make them cranky,  <br/>
but their seeing the improvements in their children and their  <br/>
relationships with them brings them overwhelming joy.   I could be  <br/>
wrong.<br/>

That&#39;s it.  It involves changing from being your child&#39;s jailer/ <br/>

<br/>

will help him!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t sound like me, the first part.  I prefer people to turn their  <br/>
frustrations toward clarity and breathing and learning to be calm.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I saw my progress, Kirby was a baby with a doctor&#39;s  <br/>
appointment and I had given him a bath in a baby tub on the kitchen  <br/>
table (an old 50&#39;s dinette set, which sounds like a cool antique, but  <br/>
at the time it wasn&#39;t; but it wasn&#39;t a wooden table is what I&#39;m saying).<br/>
<br/>
He was dressed and in the living room, and I was all ready to go, and  <br/>
it was time, and I was going to move that baby bath water from the  <br/>
tub to the sink, to pour it out.  The plastic tub buckled, and dumped  <br/>
that soapy baby water all over my kitchen floor, my feet, my legs,  <br/>
myself, the things on the bottom shelves, under the stove.<br/>
<br/>
I remember seeing it happen like in slow motion and instead of my  <br/>
usual rage and crying and yelling bad words and feeling abused and  <br/>
unlucky and a failure and being angry at the horrible unfairness of  <br/>
the stupid world, I thought it wasn&#39;t the best thing to have   <br/>
happened, and maybe next time I could empty some of the water out,  <br/>
and this wouldn&#39;t be so bad because the floor needed a wash anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It was more important that I be calm for Kirby&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
I remember it smelled like Johnson&#39;s baby wash.  And I didn&#39;t scream  <br/>
or do that long guttural fury-grunt or anything.  I changed clothes  <br/>
and took Kirby to the doctor.<br/>
<br/>
I was glad to tell Keith, when he got home, that I had handled a  <br/>
disaster calmly.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was a rough day for me, just one thing after another,  <br/>
starting with waking up to a computer that wouldn&#39;t power on, and no  <br/>
trick I&#39;d known before (plugging and unplugging, waiting) helped.   <br/>
Black was black.  It didn&#39;t even smell like Johnson&#39;s baby soap or  <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
But it was important that I not add to the unfolding day of  <br/>
imperfection by being horrible myself.  I was short a few times, but  <br/>
tried to turn it to humor and apology and try to act in ways that let  <br/>
my friends and family know that it was a bad day that a long nap  <br/>
would fix, but for one reason and another I couldn&#39;t take a nap yet,  <br/>
because the problems were still arriving and unfolding themselves.<br/>
<br/>
So if you model your newfound attempt to be and reasons to be more  <br/>
mindful and calm, it will spread.  If you try to be nice to your  <br/>
husband in some of the new ways you&#39;re being nice to your kids,  that  <br/>
will help.<br/>
<br/>
This might help:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/breathing">http://sandradodd.com/breathing</a><br/>
<br/>
I suppose it will have more someday.  Someone at a conference argued  <br/>
with me, and sent me &quot;evidence&quot; later that it was light breathing  <br/>
that was calming.  Well, not if you&#39;re full of adrenaline it&#39;s not.   <br/>
Getting angry or scared of self-righteous and then holding your  <br/>
breath or avoiding the intake of oxygen, that&#39;s a maintenance plan  <br/>
for negativity.<br/>

DH (Jim, it&#39;s easier) doesn&#39;t get the benefit of sitting down 3 hours<br/>

to see how I might react in certain situations. So when the kids do<br/>
something that is very normal for kids, he&#39;ll react in a very &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
parent-type way. Sometimes I do, too. But when I catch myself, he&#39;ll<br/>
of course still be reacting the same way. <br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
David parents in a different way to me. Sometimes it is lecturing, sometimes it is playing, it&#39;s just different. Sometimes there are things that I can see are being made more difficult because of the way he handles it. But there is definitely a vice versa going on sometimes. Today, for example, Simon said he was tired and I asked him a couple of times if he wanted a bath. David turned to me and gently said &quot;He knows what he wants, he is very good at asking for what he wants.&quot; HIs perspective often helps me to see more clearly. If David is being angrier or shorter, more terse, with Simon and Linnaea I&#39;ll sometimes ask if he&#39;s tired, not meanly, not naggingly, just as a sort of nudge. Usually he is tired. Maybe he&#39;s always tired, but in that moment he gets to choose whether or not to be led by being tired. But that comes from lots of time into this kind of parenting. Sometimes I&#39;ll change what is going on with Simon and Linnaea, move us into a different<br/>
 activity, a different kind of motion and noise. <br/>
<br/>
In the early days I&#39;m sure I told him off more. I don&#39;t think it helped. It just made him more defensive and less likely to be involved. Now, if I see something that I know is going to piss him off happening I will try and step in, just as I would with Simon or Linnaea, and mediate that moment, calm it, make it less irritating. I think he does the same thing. That didn&#39;t happen because I nagged him. That didn&#39;t happen because I told him what to do. It came because I wanted things to be better and brighter and more peaceful (if loud) and I took steps to make that happen. David wanted the same thing and he saw what I had done and did similar things. There have been conversations, I talk a lot, but it has been much more about modelling than it has been about sculpting, if you will. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
I think I&#39;m hitting on some key elements that finally clicked for me<br/>
tonight, as I was trying to explain some stuff to him, and then he<br/>
asked me, &quot;Well, what happens when the kid goes off and does something<br/>
really stupid, then?&quot; I replied that, I THINK, the whole point is that<br/>
in respectful families, the kids have NO NEED to do anything stupid.<br/>
But I&#39;d ask....<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What if you did something really stupid, what would you want to happen. What if you broke a dish or got distracted while you were creating something and glued a piece of paper to the floor? What would you want to have happen? Would you want to be lectured or grounded or made to replace the goods? Or would you want to have help cleaning up the mess and moving forward from that moment? People do stupid things, usually accidentally. It is best if you just help to minimize the costs of the stupidity and move on. I tend to feel pretty stupid after I&#39;ve done something stupid, having someone else tell me what an idiot I am just makes me angry and defensive and usually I shout back. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
And then I thought of parents I know whose kids bite or hit other<br/>
kids, and I wondered how you all would handle that if it were YOUR<br/>
child...<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Simon or Linnaea are getting angry toward each other, or are having a day that is more emotional than usual I tend to be fairly constantly present. I also make sure that I offer lots of distractions and food and drink over the course of the day. Sometimes being frustrated comes from being hungry or tired or sick or bored (as Linnaea has told me, she has added Bored to the HALT acronym (Hungry Angry Lonely Tired)). And if I&#39;m around I can keep things from getting to the breaking point and if they do break, I can take the hit while protecting the other person. If I had a child who was likely to go from happy to hitting quickly I would be present a lot of the time. When Linnaea was younger that was really important. I don&#39;t think they need to work through those things alone. I am very present when there is a disagreement over things or time or whatever going on. They are both good at coming up with alternatives, but if they are in the middle of being<br/>
 angry and resentful and furious it is really hard to calm down enough to think of another way. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
And the part (don&#39;t remember if Sandra or someone she was quoting said<br/>
it) about LETTING yourself (as an adult) process your feelings instead<br/>
of trying to STOP the anger, to let it come, realize why it&#39;s there,<br/>
then let it go, might actually help HIM personally. He is a person who<br/>
reacts before he thinks sometimes, and never hurts people, but usually<br/>
says things he doesn&#39;t mean, or throws his tools or something. And he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to do it, but doesn&#39;t know how to stop. So maybe this<br/>
will help him!<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I have that kind of anger. Less now. But I have broken a few things in my time. It is an awful thing to not know what to do with being angry. I&#39;m really good at saying mean things. Maybe you could talk about that with him. Not to tell him how to be better in his own self, but how his angry overwhelms him and he&#39;s an adult. Maybe suggest that if you can be there for your children more and be more present when they are working through something that they won&#39;t end up with the anger that plays out in those hugely explosive and scary and hurtful ways. <br/>

what happens when the kid goes off and does something really stupid, then?&quot; I <br/>
replied that, I THINK, the whole point is that in respectful families, the <br/>
kids have NO NEED to do anything stupid. But I&#39;d ask....**<br/>
<br/>
Well, no. :) Connected parenting isn&#39;t going to guarantee that your kid won&#39;t <br/>
ever do something thoughtless, or careless, or even incredibly dangerous. <br/>
About the only thing you can say for sure is that it&#39;s unlikely a child will be <br/>
doing any particular something out of a need to rebel or fight back against the <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
What happens when the kid blows it IS the point. It helps to think about what <br/>
kinds of reactions would help *you* in the aftermath of a situation where you <br/>
had done something that turned out badly. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to think <br/>
on this a lot recently, after attempting to drive my van through standing water <br/>
in a flooded parking lot that turned out to be *much* deeper than it looked. <br/>
The engine was destroyed, and because there was a LOT of water everywhere in <br/>
the area that weekend, the insurance company is being slower than normal to do <br/>
everything, including deciding that my beloved 11yo van isn&#39;t worth much at <br/>
all. :( <br/>
<br/>
A really poor decision of mine has had big effects on the whole family. My <br/>
husband has been taking the train to work so the rest of us can use his car. He <br/>
has to wake up earlier, walk a mile to the station, walk nearly two miles to <br/>
work from the other station. He gets home later than usual. Some of the things <br/>
our kids wanted to do have had to be rescheduled or cancelled because we just <br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out a way to get everyone where they wanted to be. We&#39;re going <br/>
to have to spend a lot of money for another vehicle, when we had thought we&#39;d <br/>
have a few years yet before we&#39;d replace the van - it was in outstanding <br/>
shape right up until I ran it into the water, and I&#39;d just had new tires put on it <br/>
in May. We&#39;re having a lot of trouble finding the time to go out looking at <br/>
vehicles without feeling the pressure to just make a decision right now. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been feeling sad and mad at myself and pretty dumb, but I&#39;ve also been <br/>
feeling SO incredibly loved because not one member of my family has been <br/>
anything but supportive. Nobody has asked how I could do something so stupid or what <br/>
was I thinking. Nobody has pointed out exactly where I went wrong and what I <br/>
should do in the future. Nobody has complained about how they&#39;ve been <br/>
inconvienced or about how much this is going to cost us. Nobody has made jokes at my <br/>
expense. My husband has hugged me and told me that it will work out okay, that <br/>
he&#39;s happy because nobody got hurt or was ever in danger. He&#39;s also gently <br/>
reminded me of things I need to do to help us work out of this situation without <br/>
implying I was stupid or thoughtless because I hadn&#39;t remembered all of them <br/>
myself. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the kind of reaction our kids need when they blow it. Help and support <br/>
to think through what needs to be done. Hugs and appreciation that they are <br/>
still around for us to love. Support in fixing what needs to be fixed, or <br/>
mourning what can&#39;t be repaired. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s SO easy to get derailed. The parent feels compelled to point out how <br/>
stupid the kid was and how lucky they are to be alive. The kid feels compelled to <br/>
protect himself by deflecting the criticism, protesting that he doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand what the big deal is or yelling in response. Everybody ends up hurt, <br/>
feeling angry and misunderstood. Whatever might have been learned from the <br/>
experience ends up buried under layers of blame and resentment. It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
be that way.<br/>

I&#39;m always interested in knowing why these ideas get people cranky  <br/>
before it gets them euphoric.  I think the ideas make them cranky,  <br/>
but their seeing the improvements in their children and their  <br/>
relationships with them brings them overwhelming joy.   I could be  <br/>
wrong.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the challange makes them cranky. I think the idea that what they are doing now isn&#39;t good enough or isn&#39;t right makes them cranky. I&#39;m on a list where I challanged someone&#39;s stance on replica guns for children and she and others on the list decided that I was judging her parenting and only believed that there was one good way to be a parent and that I should know that this mother was an amazing mother, and on and on. I had challenged her words but she felt that I was challenging all that she was and all that she believed in. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it has to do with confidence, too. I know what I am doing works. Some of it is because I see it working in my own family. I watch the joy that you mention overwhelming us all. It is fantastic. But it is also because I know a lot of people who are also living this life and parenting in this way and I see how it works in their own families and so I am not disturbed when my parenting or my range of food available or my policy on television watching is questioned, because I am very, very confident in what I am doing. And maybe that shakes people as well. <br/>

Secondly, I have medical conditions that might make it <br/>
impossible to follow her closely (and my other daughter, for that <br/>
matter) in the future. Should the case ever arise that (God forbid) <br/>
I&#39;m no longer around, I want her to be able to take up learning under <br/>
someone else&#39;s tutelage or a school (again, God forbid) without too <br/>
much grief. This is the one area I know she might lack otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I know many of you will have your opinions on this and I welcome <br/>
them. I&#39;d like to fully unschool her, but I also need to resolve it <br/>
with my life&#39;s circumstances.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It must be scary to imagine your children growing up without you. There are people on this list who have lost family members. I bet you every one of them is happier for the memories they have of an unschooled life filled with joy and laughter and presence and play than they worry about anything that they didn&#39;t teach or learn in those precious moments. I imagine that your daughters will rather that they remember you as this wonderfully joyful parent than that they will rally against you for not preparing them well enough for a possible return to school. Parent them with the wonderful freedom that could come with knowing that every moment is a gift. Don&#39;t prepare them for your absence, let them live with your joy!<br/>

&gt; everything you did? Or do you sit down and talk about it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband never read anything and didn&#39;t understand what I was trying  <br/>
to do. And he felt attacked when we talked about it - or bored.<br/>
<br/>
He slowly caught on.<br/>
<br/>
In the midst of something, you can use some pre-thought-out phrases to  <br/>
use that might help him see what you&#39;re trying to do.<br/>
<br/>
Say you&#39;re all sitting around the living room - he&#39;s watching Monday  <br/>
night football, kids are building with legos on the floor. They jump  <br/>
up to do something else, paint pictures, let&#39;s say, and leave a big  <br/>
bunch of legos scattered around the floor, right in his line of vision  <br/>
between him and the tv &lt;G&gt;. He yells after then, &quot;Hey, come back and  <br/>
clean these up before you go off and make another mess somewhere  <br/>
else.&quot; You deftly step in and start cleaning them up, with a big smile  <br/>
and a positive attitude. And you say, &quot;Hey you guys, let&#39;s first get  <br/>
these ready for the next time you want to use them and then I&#39;ll help  <br/>
you get all the paint out in the kitchen.&quot; In the meantime, you&#39;ve  <br/>
probably already almost finished putting them away, so there really  <br/>
isn&#39;t much for the kids to do. Everybody is happy.<br/>
<br/>
This worked wonders at my house - my husband got to see how to ask the  <br/>
kids to do something without creating a power struggle, which is how  <br/>
his usual demands nearly always ended up.<br/>
<br/>
He noticed that I asked for much less but got cooperation when I  <br/>
asked. He demanded and got resistance and anger. At first he blamed me  <br/>
for the resistance he experienced because &quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t make them do  <br/>
enough. He was right, in a way. Because of the way I was treating  <br/>
them, they weren&#39;t willing to accept the way he was treating them. So  <br/>
he was a bit resentful and stopped asking them to do things. Then he  <br/>
started asking me to ask them to do things &lt;G&gt;. When he did that, I  <br/>
would usually ask the kids to help me, but be okay doing it myself if  <br/>
they didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Once in a while my husband will say, &quot;Don&#39;t do it FOR them, they need  <br/>
to learn to clean up after themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When he says that in front of the kids, my response is, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s  <br/>
okay, I don&#39;t mind at all because I&#39;m glad that in this family we all  <br/>
help each other out in so many ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If he says it to me privately, I tell him that that I&#39;m more concerned  <br/>
with long-term goals than with who cleans up the legos right now and  <br/>
that, long term, the kids will become more helpful people if they  <br/>
experience us being helpful to them.<br/>
<br/>
That theme of looking at longer-term goals seemed to really make the  <br/>
most sense to him of anything else I tried in the way of explanation.<br/>
<br/>
My husband certainly noticed that my interactions with the kids were  <br/>
more harmonious than his. He also noticed, though, that I &quot;waited on  <br/>
them&quot; a lot, whereas he felt like kids should be asked to &quot;wait on&quot;  <br/>
adults more often than not. That comes from his childhood in Iran  <br/>
where kids were pretty much treated like little servants. He couldn&#39;t  <br/>
wait to be a grown-up so that he could be the one giving orders. So  <br/>
that feels like a sort of dirty trick was played on him - he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want to feel like a servant to his kids now that he&#39;s the grown up. It  <br/>
took a while and still he sometimes feels like we parents are going  <br/>
too far, doing too much for the kids, not asking enough of them.<br/>
<br/>
It can help a relationship a lot if you realize that he is not you, he  <br/>
isn&#39;t going to ever BE you. His relationship with the kids belongs to  <br/>
them, not to you. Even though my husband was never totally on board  <br/>
with certain things - he came slowly around to far more respectful  <br/>
parenting than he probably ever thought he would. He DID emulate me at  <br/>
times. And every once in a while I&#39;d give him a concrete suggestion -  <br/>
to make things better, not to make him a perfect imitation of me &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>
For example, one idea I got from the &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen  <br/>
and Listen so Kids Will Talk&quot; book, was &quot;use a word.&quot; I thought that  <br/>
would really help him. I told him about it and he immediately tried it  <br/>
out. Roya walked by with a wet towel and draped it over the back of  <br/>
the couch while she talked to us. Then she walked off, leaving it  <br/>
there. My husband&#39;s cue to launch into a lecture about why she  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t leave wet towels on the furniture and her to get huffy about  <br/>
being lectured at and him angry at the way she talked back to him and  <br/>
her grabbing the towel, angrily, and flinging it into the bathroom and  <br/>
slamming her bedroom door. Over a wet towel on the back of the couch?  <br/>
I could see it coming.<br/>
<br/>
But this time he just very nicely said, &quot;Towel,&quot; and Roya turned  <br/>
around, smiled and said, &quot;Oh, thanks,&quot; and took it off with her. My  <br/>
husband about fell out of his chair. My credibility went up about a  <br/>
thousand percent right then and there.<br/>
<br/>
And the kids adore him and know what a wonderful and sweet heart he  <br/>
has and they find some of his &quot;old country&quot; beliefs and behaviors   <br/>
very charming, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526746336">-=-Sheesh, Sandra, my blowing up my car qualifies as a special  <br/>
occasion if<br/>
anything does. :)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know, but my thought was if he&#39;s leaving his car at home for  you  <br/>
guys to use, he&#39;s also chosen to walk to the station rather than ask  <br/>
you to wake up and take him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, he HAS TO wake up much earlier because it takes twice as long  <br/>
to get to<br/>
<br/>
work riding the train than walking from the station-=-<br/>
<br/>
The earlier part I understood completely.  The having to walk a mile  <br/>
when there was a car running at the house did confuse me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Good lord, I write a long post about the love and joy of accepting  <br/>
what is<br/>
<br/>
instead of blaming in a situation in which there is plenty of blame  <br/>
that I could<br/>
be heaped with, and you pick at me for one Has To. Clearly the point  <br/>
just<br/>
went right past everyone. Sorry.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the point went past.  It was sweet!<br/>
<br/>
I mention  just about every &quot;has to&quot; that doesn&#39;t seem to be a has  <br/>
to.  That&#39;s because it&#39;s about clarity more than about individual  <br/>
details.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m always interested in knowing why these ideas get people cranky  <br/>
&gt; before it gets them euphoric.  I think the ideas make them cranky,  <br/>
&gt; but their seeing the improvements in their children and their  <br/>
&gt; relationships with them brings them overwhelming joy.   I could be  <br/>
&gt; wrong.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was one of the pages I read last night, and I was trying to think<br/>
if it was a correct application. In a way, Yes, and in another way, No...<br/>
<br/>
My husband always felt stupid growing up and still believes it<br/>
sometimes. I&#39;m not sure why, but he honestly thinks the teachers<br/>
thought of him that way. Regardless, he is always trying to &quot;prove&quot;<br/>
himself, even if subconsciously, so that people will say &quot;Oh, he knows<br/>
what he&#39;s talking about!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*I*, on the other hand, always got the opposite. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re so smart&quot;<br/>
&quot;Hey, Grandpa, did you hear what she said? She memorized such & such<br/>
perfectly!!&quot; and the comments in my yearbooks from kids who couldn&#39;t<br/>
care less about me or want to get to know me (in the private school)<br/>
were always, more or less, &quot;To the smart and nice girl.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then in high school I was even valedictorian (which I refused to<br/>
speak because I hate public speaking and I had only attended the<br/>
school for 4 years, so I felt that another person who knew most of the<br/>
peers would be a better fit.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I got tired of everyone telling me how smart I was, because I<br/>
knew it wasn&#39;t intelligence I was showing, it was my memorization<br/>
skills and homework assignments done on time. Something anyone can do,<br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
Yet at the same time, when someone points out mistakes to me, or<br/>
critiques me, even gently, I absolutely dissolve. I feel stupid, I<br/>
cringe, I feel worthless.<br/>
<br/>
I DO want to learn, but don&#39;t like hearing that I NEED to learn. I<br/>
liked feeling superior, even if I didn&#39;t believe it. If that even<br/>
makes sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819582506">HIs perspective often helps me to see more clearly. If David is being<br/>
angrier or shorter, more terse, with Simon and Linnaea I&#39;ll sometimes<br/>
ask if he&#39;s tired, not meanly, not naggingly, just as a sort of nudge. <br/>
<br/>
I love when Jim is the calming influence, as well. I still get that<br/>
tendency to say &quot;No, here&#39;s how *I* do such-and-such&quot; and then I<br/>
remember to back off and watch how he adds a dimension to parenting<br/>
that I can&#39;t. It makes me wish he could be here more :)  And I DO hate<br/>
nagging him. My mom always nagged my dad, and I hate it. And of course<br/>
I turned out just.like.her. And so I have tried, step by step, to<br/>
change all those things in me that mirror what I disliked about her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; What if you did something really stupid, what would you want to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>happen. What if you broke a dish or got distracted while you were<br/>
creating something and glued a piece of paper to the floor? What would<br/>
you want to have happen? Would you want to be lectured or grounded or<br/>
made to replace the goods? Or would you want to have help cleaning up<br/>
the mess and moving forward from that moment? People do stupid things,<br/>
usually accidentally. It is best if you just help to minimize the<br/>
costs of the stupidity and move on. I tend to feel pretty stupid after<br/>
I&#39;ve done something stupid, having someone else tell me what an idiot<br/>
I am just makes me angry and defensive and usually I shout back. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is EXACTLY how I took the example that I was reading when it<br/>
&quot;clicked&quot; for me. Both Jim and I are horrible about sometimes<br/>
sarcastically throwing it in the childrens&#39; faces that they screwed<br/>
up, and I immediately feel bad when I see their faces. This, I think,<br/>
is huge for me. To HONESTLY put myself in their shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure WHEN or WHERE we got the idea (we being universal, not<br/>
just Jim and I) that children are SUPPOSED to feel less, or inferior,<br/>
than adults. I can&#39;t even think of anywhere in the Bible (if religion<br/>
had a part to play) were this is advocated. In fact, being religious,<br/>
I honestly believe that the part where Jesus told the disciples to<br/>
back off and let the little tikes approach him shows he WAS supportive<br/>
of children, much like he was actually supportive of women, even<br/>
though the men of the time treated them like property. (the whole<br/>
stone throwing incident with the men who accused the adulteress but<br/>
somehow left the adulterer out of it.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s a huge mindset to change from thinking, &quot;But they&#39;re<br/>
kids, they don&#39;t deserve to have the same rights as adults. They<br/>
aren&#39;t supposed to have the freedoms we do because they can&#39;t handle<br/>
it.&quot; Instead, it&#39;s now &quot;They have every right, or maybe more so, to be<br/>
treated with kindness and respect. They deserve the freedom to make<br/>
choices with us as their guides, leading them to make wise decisions<br/>
and protecting them from the unwise ones until they are old enough to<br/>
learn from them&quot; (at least, the way I see it, as my babies can not yet<br/>
make the decision to walk towards the road without dire consequences,<br/>
so I pull them away. While my older ones DO go near the road, with my<br/>
watchful eye, and a few times I HAVE had to remind them that cars are<br/>
coming...but they are very good at staying on the side now and handle<br/>
it quite well.<br/>
<br/>
Deb<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; And then I thought of parents I know whose kids bite or hit other<br/>
&gt; kids, and I wondered how you all would handle that if it were YOUR<br/>
&gt; child...<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When Simon or Linnaea are getting angry toward each other, or are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>having a day that is more emotional than usual I tend to be fairly<br/>
constantly present. I also make sure that I offer lots of distractions<br/>
and food and drink over the course of the day. Sometimes being<br/>
frustrated comes from being hungry or tired or sick or bored (as<br/>
Linnaea has told me, she has added Bored to the HALT acronym (Hungry<br/>
Angry Lonely Tired)). And if I&#39;m around I can keep things from getting<br/>
to the breaking point and if they do break, I can take the hit while<br/>
protecting the other person. If I had a child who was likely to go<br/>
from happy to hitting quickly I would be present a lot of the time.<br/>
When Linnaea was younger that was really important. I don&#39;t think they<br/>
need to work through those things alone. I am very present when there<br/>
is a disagreement over things or time or whatever going on. They are<br/>
both good at coming up with alternatives, but if they are in the<br/>
middle of being<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  angry and resentful and furious it is really hard to calm down<br/>
 </span></blockquote>enough to think of another way. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the part (don&#39;t remember if Sandra or someone she was quoting said<br/>
&gt; it) about LETTING yourself (as an adult) process your feelings instead<br/>
&gt; of trying to STOP the anger, to let it come, realize why it&#39;s there,<br/>
&gt; then let it go, might actually help HIM personally. He is a person who<br/>
&gt; reacts before he thinks sometimes, and never hurts people, but usually<br/>
&gt; says things he doesn&#39;t mean, or throws his tools or something. And he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t like to do it, but doesn&#39;t know how to stop. So maybe this<br/>
&gt; will help him!<br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, I have that kind of anger. Less now. But I have broken a few<br/>
 </span></blockquote>things in my time. It is an awful thing to not know what to do with<br/>
being angry. I&#39;m really good at saying mean things. Maybe you could<br/>
talk about that with him. Not to tell him how to be better in his own<br/>
self, but how his angry overwhelms him and he&#39;s an adult. Maybe<br/>
suggest that if you can be there for your children more and be more<br/>
present when they are working through something that they won&#39;t end up<br/>
with the anger that plays out in those hugely explosive and scary and<br/>
hurtful ways. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of a story Dr. Kevin Leman told about the time he came<br/>
home to find that his wife had backed their car right through the<br/>
CLOSED garage door....he just walked in, gave his (sobbing) wife a<br/>
hug, and acted like nothing unusual had happened. He never even<br/>
mentioned it to her (even though he fixed it later.)<br/>
<br/>
It also, sadly, brings to mind the horrible tragedy with Stephen<br/>
Curtis Chapman&#39;s daughter (his 17 year old son accidentally backed<br/>
over her, resulting in her death.) On Larry King Live, Larry asked the<br/>
family if they ever blamed the son for the accident, and the mother<br/>
immediately says, &quot;No. Not ever.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I actually have a hard time believing it, not because it isn&#39;t true,<br/>
but because of my OWN heart. For some reason, part of me WOULD blame<br/>
him, accident though it was. I&#39;m not sure why this is rooted in me (I<br/>
really, REALLY don&#39;t like it!) But it&#39;s there. It&#39;s one of the HUGE<br/>
things I want to change about me.<br/>
<br/>
I really do know my parents love me and did everything they thought<br/>
they were supposed to do, to the best of their ability. But yet I am<br/>
so hung up on guilt and wanting to please people, and pinning blame on<br/>
things gone wrong....such negativity, all the time....<br/>
<br/>
I even hear their voices in my head (mostly my mother&#39;s) when I read<br/>
these articles or the discussion points here. I hear their sarcasm and<br/>
their disbelief and shock...it&#39;s all still in my head...and I feel<br/>
guilty for even THINKING things like &quot;Yeah, maybe filthy language<br/>
isn&#39;t necessarily filthy, but appropriate only in certain times and<br/>
places...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another thing Dr. Leman says is that when you marry, you bring to your<br/>
marriage bed your spouses whole family - so in effect you are sleeping<br/>
with your in-laws. what he meant, of course, is that your spouse has<br/>
things ingrained in him from his parents that will carry over into<br/>
YOUR marriage....In my case it&#39;s MY parents that are carrying over<br/>
into my parenting...<br/>

those &quot;he can&#39;t play with guns in my house&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t point it at<br/>
people&quot; (well, isn&#39;t that the point of &quot;bad guy vs. good guy play????)<br/>
<br/>
But yet she&#39;s totally not religious, she even LIKES to hunt deer, and<br/>
I&#39;m sure has no issue with the masturbation. (which I think is one of<br/>
the most saddest things religion has done to young men...AND women...)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter went through a whole year of asking about death and dying<br/>
and when SHE would die (broke my heart to hear it, though...just<br/>
thinking about it, since I couldn&#39;t guarantee her it would be a long<br/>
time from now, though I told her I sure hoped it would be.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she at one point said that her girlfriend (imaginary friend)<br/>
had a sword and a gun and she kills bad dogs. Now, this is funny if<br/>
you had met my 3 year old at the time since she SEEMS all sweet and<br/>
innocence, and we loved it! My mom, of course, was appalled, and<br/>
probably wondered WHAT we had let her watch, but I knew she was simply<br/>
learning, in her way, what DYING was, and was exploring that in play.<br/>
Just as now my 4 year old boy thinks it&#39;s hilarious to talk about<br/>
peeing and pooping in one&#39;s pants.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing to watch them play, and the reasons they come up with for<br/>
the heavy topics of life.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I think,  people who are seeing that from a Christian  <br/>
point of view have a harder time than others.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that there&#39;s an objective good and bad is extreme.  But  <br/>
going to the opposite of that, the (very bad) idea that there&#39;s no  <br/>
way to tell good from bad, is just as extreme.<br/>
<br/>
First people need to know what they want.  I don&#39;t mean what they  <br/>
want exactly ten years from now.   This is another extreme  <br/>
interpretation of something true and simple, that you can visualize  <br/>
yourself a yacht and an Escalade and you&#39;re guaranteed to get them  <br/>
unless your visualizations were faulty.<br/>
<br/>
But if you&#39;re living in the realm of priorities that have to do with  <br/>
relationships and a peaceful family and a lot of learning, you will  <br/>
then know right from wrong for you in that situation because you will  <br/>
be able to make the more peaceful, learning-rich choices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So the more mindful and conscious you are, the less conflicted, which  <br/>
is what Katherine said.  I&#39;m not disputing it, I&#39;m trying to put it  <br/>
on a glass shelf with a little spotlight and a docent explaining it.   <br/>
I guess I&#39;m the docent in my museum moment.<br/>

The more aware and mindful we can be while creating __peaceful and<br/>

less conflicted our decision making will be too.<br/>
<br/>
(I need to think of it that way because action is better than abstraction,<br/>
which I tend to go toward... having had much more experience in purely<br/>
thinking instead of thinking in order to know how I want to act.  I think<br/>
that&#39;s a direct result of not having a lot of experience making decisions<br/>

&gt; But if you&#39;re living in the realm of priorities that have to do with<br/>
&gt; relationships and a peaceful family and a lot of learning, you will<br/>
&gt; then know right from wrong for you in that situation because you will<br/>
&gt; be able to make the more peaceful, learning-rich choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the more mindful and conscious you are, the less conflicted, which<br/>
&gt; is what Katherine said. I&#39;m not disputing it, I&#39;m trying to put it<br/>
&gt; on a glass shelf with a little spotlight and a docent explaining it.<br/>
&gt; I guess I&#39;m the docent in my museum moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106387210">-=-&gt; First people need to know what they want. I don&#39;t mean what they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; want exactly ten years from now. This is another extreme<br/>
 &gt; interpretation of something true and simple, that you can visualize<br/>
 &gt; yourself a yacht and an Escalade and you&#39;re guaranteed to get them<br/>
 &gt; unless your visualizations were faulty.<br/>
 &gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was unclear.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that last statement is the true and simple thing.  I  <br/>
think the idea of visualizing a yacht and a luxury car is an extreme  <br/>
interpretation (and not a good focus in life--see the story of King  <br/>
Midas for remembering priorities, or the fairy tale   &quot;Toads and  <br/>
Diamonds&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
While it is VERY clear and true that deciding to make more peaceful  <br/>
choices leads to peace, choosing to make more-Escalade choices might  <br/>
not lead to an Escalade OR to peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022267531">Thanks for these resources, Sandra...some very good points were made <br/>
in those articles...especially the one that highlights that if a <br/>
child is truly unschooling, it doesn&#39;t really matter where they are <br/>
intellectually compared to their peers, that IQ standards are only <br/>
really needed to figure out where to farm the kids out in school. If <br/>
she&#39;s learning out of interest and through life experiences, she will <br/>
learn what she needs when she&#39;s ready. Am I getting the point?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still new at so many aspects of unschooling, but I&#39;m really <br/>
starting to see a difference when I apply some of the concepts. Just <br/>
removing the word &#39;no&#39; from my vocabulary seems to bring about <br/>
amazing changes and not the negativity which I expected. I&#39;m the <br/>
first to admit that I&#39;m still quite green in this area, but I hope to <br/>
get tons of knowledge from this list. I&#39;ve bookmarked your link so <br/>
that I can read the articles there when I have some more free time.<br/>
<br/>
I started a blog last week to document my daughters journey through <br/>
life/homeschooling/unschooling...partly for my family to follow, and <br/>
partly to see how they grow over the years. Once Dawn (these are not <br/>
their real names, btw) is school-aged, it will also serve as a <br/>
portfolio for her school board.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154098533">-=If she&#39;s learning out of interest and through life experiences, she  <br/>

<br/>
Yes, but even more than &quot;learn what she needs when she&#39;s ready,&quot; she  <br/>
will learn all KINDS of things no one thought in advance that she  <br/>
needed, and every bit of that makes it easier to learn other things.<br/>
<br/>
When people learn, they&#39;re making connections to what they already  <br/>
know, so the more one knows from ANY source (lyrics, movies, games,  <br/>
toys, local parks, the grocery store), the more hooks to hang new  <br/>
information there will be.   This is why it&#39;s detrimental for  <br/>
unschooling when parents try to sort &quot;good information&quot; from  <br/>
&quot;worthless/fluff/crap&quot;  (The &quot;crap&quot; is a quote, and from more than  <br/>
one parent, in writing, I&#39;m sorry to say.)<br/>
<br/>
Those families in which a child&#39;s access to information and  <br/>
experience is limited will have children whose knowledge of the world  <br/>
is more limited, and so whose learning will not be as quick or easy  <br/>
or fun.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve bookmarked your link so that I can read the articles there  <br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re going to unschool, you can&#39;t think in terms of &quot;free time&quot;  <br/>
as much anymore.  All of your time will become learning time.  If  <br/>
reading on my site or Joyce&#39;s brings amazing changes and less  <br/>
negativity, then doing that will be part of your job as a unschooling  <br/>
parent.  It&#39;s not fluff for free time.  It&#39;s preparation for the  <br/>
unschooling day.<br/>
<br/>
On Joyce&#39;s front page these days there&#39;s information about making the  <br/>
transition and saying yes.<br/>
