<div id="ygrps-yiv-625346601">Hi everyone,<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a few days, I think it is about time to introduce<br/>
myself so that I can &quot;jump right in&quot; on the coversations.<br/>
<br/>
We (dh, ds 8yo, dd 11yo) have been HSing for almost 6 years. We started out<br/>
unschooling.  A strange turn of events involving bitter family members and<br/>
social services made me lose my mind &lt;g&gt; and I began &quot;school at home&quot;<br/>
practices after only 1 year unschooling.  I have flipped back and forth over<br/>
the years.  We are back to unschooling now, to stay, forever.  This time<br/>
feels different for us. For this and many other changes I thank all the<br/>
posters on this and other unschooly lists, message boards, and web page<br/>
articles.  My family is happier now.<br/>
<br/>
We currently live in central Indiana.  I&#39;ve lived in many places (Alaska,<br/>
Texas, North Carolina, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, Indiana) and attended<br/>
12 different public schools in my youth.  (Yes, I am still recovering from<br/>
that) LOL<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s all for now.... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Zan<br/>
<br/>
This message is cross-posted to other lists, sorry if you have to read it<br/>
twice :-(<br/>
