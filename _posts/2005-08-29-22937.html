<div id="ygrps-yiv-105770451">Hello - We&#39;ve been living an &#39;unschooling&#39; lifestyle for more <br/>
than 1 1/2 years now, I was more of an attachment style parent when <br/>
he was younger but then (sigh) sent him to preschool for half a year <br/>
and then kindy for half a year (I didn&#39;t know about unschooling <br/>
then!) I can see in him that he is regaining some of the creativity <br/>
and joy he had before school but more &#39;deschooling&#39; is still <br/>
necessary. Anyhow that just gives you a little information about our <br/>
background what I would like to have some advise on is how to help <br/>
him to realize there are other families like ours - that there are <br/>
other unschoolers - that it is okey for him to work on what he wants <br/>
for as long as he wants.<br/>
    There are very few homeschoolers in our area and no other <br/>
unschoolers and he gets to play with other children rarely, although <br/>
the last 2X we went to the park he did play with another child <br/>
there. But the last several times we went to the homeschool playtime <br/>
he prettymuch played by himself, I&#39;m thinking we should stop going. <br/>
He spends a lot of time at home working on building hotwheels <br/>
racetracks and creating scenerios, building with blocks, he watches <br/>
a few TV shows but I have found since he has unlimited access then <br/>
he won&#39;t watch unless it&#39;s something he is really interested in <br/>
(that&#39;s a GOOD thing IMHO.) He spends some time on his PS2 but even <br/>
more with his computer, but again it&#39;s not something he wants to do <br/>
constantly. I am hoping he will get better at typing and reading <br/>
soon so he can get some email &quot;pen pals&quot; that hopefully are <br/>
unschoolers, or just interesting nice kids - I just sense that he <br/>
feels somewhat alone. <br/>
   He has TONS of books on every subject imaginable and sometimes I <br/>
read to him or we read together at his request, plus I think he <br/>
reads a lot to himself on the computer without even realizing it. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I need to stew more things - I&#39;m not sure what else <br/>
to do? I think he has investigated lots of computer sites, again he <br/>
has unlimited access to a computer with internet, should I try to <br/>
find more websites for him? I feel like he prettymuch has accessed <br/>
the best kid&#39;s sites available and done the games that he liked <br/>
until he is tired of them. I try to follow his lead but lately he <br/>
seems in a lull, should I just let him wait it out or try to <br/>
introduce something new? I really would like for him to have more <br/>
knowledge of other kids who are unschoolers. Are there any websites <br/>
yet directed more towards unschoolers, perhaps with chatboards? Is <br/>
there anything that I could say to him that would help him? I wish I <br/>
could remember what it was liked to be 7 so I could relate to him <br/>
more, to help him figure out what he really wants to ask for more... <br/>
Thank you for your suggestions! Barbara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729763137">If he&#39;s not complaining, maybe he&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
As to stirring things up, can you leave town, visit something in another <br/>
town, maybe spend the night (or at least all a long day with lunch or dinner) and <br/>
be touristy?   (Or maybe you can be touristy in your own town.)<br/>
<br/>
After some real-life out-there, he&#39;ll play differently, and maybe look at <br/>
different websites, and work through connecting the things he saw and did with <br/>
what he already knows.   It will stir things a bit, and you&#39;ll get to see what <br/>
sorts of things pique his interest, so that you can maybe follow through (a <br/>
little, not tons) on some things.   It might help you both figure out some other <br/>
dots to connect.<br/>
