<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087833712">&lt;&lt;Poop is stinky. Pellet poop is stinky.  All poop is<br/>
stinky.<br/>

I actually like the smell of Horse Poop, sheep and goat poop is to small and<br/>
firm to be stinky to me. Cow poop is not as pleasant but is not a<br/>
gag-inducer.<br/>
It&#39;s all subjective. When riding in the country, I roll DOWN the windows<br/>
when passing by a field of livestock..<br/>
