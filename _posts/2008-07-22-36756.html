<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873881622">Storm is three and a half (end of October birthday) and I know there&#39;s the  <br/>
possibility he&#39;s &quot;growing out of&quot; naps, but I&#39;m not sure how gradual that is. <br/>
If  he would skip a nap for a day when he was younger, it was *very* hard for <br/>
him to  get back into the routine of napping, now not so much. Often, he&#39;ll nap <br/>
in the  car later than he would nap at home if we&#39;re out at nap time. At home <br/>
I nap with  him 99% of the time, occasionally, I&#39;ll lay with him until he <br/>
falls asleep then  come downstairs. Very rarely, he isn&#39;t interested in napping <br/>
and I&#39;m  exhausted, and I&#39;ll nap while he stays up. We don&#39;t even call it <br/>
napping, we  call it &quot;relax time&quot; or more often &quot;playing video games&quot;, since we <br/>
take our  handheld games (Gameboy DS) and play side by side lying down until one <br/>
or both  of us is tired, then we usually leave one of them open and running <br/>
for Storm to  have light.<br/>
 <br/>
Today, Storm took his Gameboy and went upstairs himself. In the 5 minutes  or <br/>
so he was up there, while I was pondering this new development and gloating  <br/>
to myself about how trust and freedom is the way to go, I was finishing up  <br/>
something on the computer before I was going to head up with him. Well, just as  <br/>
I was finishing, he came down and took my hand and asked me to come with him, <br/>
 took me upstairs and was showing me some of the things that were the same on <br/>
2  Gameboy game boxes that were laid side-by-side on the bed. He started <br/>
playing  one of them and I ducked into the bathroom for a moment before I joined <br/>
him.  When I came back in, he was still standing beside the bed playing and <br/>
after  asking him to get up in the bed and he didn&#39;t respond, I figured he was <br/>
just  concentrating, so I picked him up and laid him on the bed. (Okay, now I&#39;m <br/>
seeing  that I shouldn&#39;t have done that.) He protested that he didn&#39;t want to <br/>
sleep and  I said I had needed him out of the way to get into bed. He said he <br/>
wanted to go  downstairs and I said that I loved playing video games with him <br/>
and couldn&#39;t we  do that. He said no, he wanted to go downstairs. I said I was <br/>
disappointed and  that I had really wanted to play with him. He said he <br/>
didn&#39;t want to sleep. I  told him he didn&#39;t have to sleep, he could just play games <br/>
next to me. Storm is  often most adamant about avoiding lying down or getting <br/>
comfortable when he is  the most sleepy. He started to get off the bed and <br/>
said he wanted to go  downstairs and I said firmly but gently, &quot;No, lay down <br/>
here with me for a while.  We&#39;ll go downstairs later.&quot; He reluctantly climbed <br/>
back up beside me and lay  down, then whined a bit and I said he sounded kind of <br/>
like a doggy whining  and asked him if he&#39;d ever heard a dog whine. Then I <br/>
played with him a bit,  pretending to be a dog snuffling at him and whining, then <br/>
a soft bark. After  about 5 minutes of him giggling and asking me to do it <br/>
again, he acted like a  doggy for a bit and then settled down to play his game. <br/>
Eventually, he fell  asleep and when he woke, he showed no signs of his <br/>
earlier upset/disapointment  and even pretended to be a dog and curled up with me <br/>
for a while before he went  downstairs.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems like a happy ending, but I&#39;m unsure if rare occurrences like these  <br/>
are going to affect how he feels about sleeping or his ability to listen to <br/>
his  body and know when he&#39;s tired. We&#39;ve tried repeatedly (at night, not  <br/>
naptime) to let him fall asleep wherever (downstairs), but he just doesn&#39;t  fall <br/>
asleep. He&#39;s a very light sleeper and anything keeps him awake, so even all  the <br/>
rest of the family being quiet around him and the t.v. so low it&#39;s barely  <br/>
able to be heard keep him awake. Three to four hours past when he normally falls <br/>
 asleep, and at that point, he&#39;s been so horribly cranky and beside himself <br/>
that  we&#39;ve taken him up where he&#39;s fallen asleep within 5 minutes. So, I&#39;m <br/>
feeling  uncertain. I&#39;m not sure what else I could have done instead (besides not <br/>
picking  him up and placing him on the bed-I&#39;ll remember that next time), and <br/>
this was  one of those days where it was clear he needed some rest. Truly, I <br/>
didn&#39;t care  if he fell asleep or just laid quietly for a while, but I was <br/>
pretty sure he  *would* fall asleep if he was quiet a bit.<br/>
 <br/>
Am I still not trusting him enough and deciding what&#39;s best for him myself?  <br/>
Do I just need some new techniques and ideas? Is an incident like this rare  <br/>
enough that it doesn&#39;t matter? I&#39;m just not sure, but I&#39;d like some input.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
De<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-164902081">I had that kind of experience with Rosie (my now-17 yo) for a while. I  <br/>
used to do pretty much the same thing - try to find some way of  <br/>
getting her off alone and into a reclining position. She&#39;d resist  <br/>
because she knew she was going to fall asleep and didn&#39;t want to miss  <br/>
anything. I&#39;d try different things - the best was to get her to let me  <br/>
read to her in bed. Sometimes it was watching a video.<br/>
<br/>
Now she does it to herself - when she knows she needs to sleep to feel  <br/>
her best, but she has the urge to push herself longer and stay awake,  <br/>
she&#39;ll watch a movie or a tv series on dvd. Goes right off to sleep.  <br/>
Her tv has a sleep timer - she sets it for 15 minutes and almost never  <br/>
is awake when it goes off.<br/>
