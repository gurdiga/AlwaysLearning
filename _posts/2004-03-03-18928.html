<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341680887">Hello Danny and all -<br/>
Another idea:<br/>
Scoop up the child and run outside....I&#39;d scoop up my child and carry her <br/>
outside and jog around saying things to have her notice her surroundings - ooh <br/>
feel the cool air....look at the birds....wow, there&#39;s the mail truck....let&#39;s <br/>
swing around!.....let&#39;s roll on the ground....feel the branch on your arm.... <br/>
movement movement movement..... life life life...... kind of to get her out of <br/>
her head for a moment.....<br/>
<br/>
After there is some calmness, then I&#39;d offer the food, etc......<br/>
<br/>
And MUCH later, I&#39;d talk with her about what&#39;s going on and what would be <br/>
helpful in those moments..... <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s one of those &#39;anything can work some of the time&#39; ideas.....<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes....<br/>
Jane<br/>
