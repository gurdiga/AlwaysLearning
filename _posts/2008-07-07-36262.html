<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020270926">I always try to answer a question when posed by anyone, kids or <br/>
others.  If I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll offer to help find the answer if <br/>
practical.  Bring me the dictionary, I&#39;ll look it up for you, try <br/>
googling...XXX, see if that works, call uncle Will, I think he&#39;ll know <br/>
the answer...When my 15y.o. daughter was much younger, 4-5 I guess, we <br/>
strated a question note book...something we kept in the car and toted <br/>
around with us on trips and such...if a question was asked that I could <br/>
answer right then I would write it down ans then look up the answer as <br/>
soon as I could.  This way I hoped she wouldn&#39;t feel like her questions <br/>
were not important, and to help me remember what I promised to find out <br/>
for her...Beverly</div>
