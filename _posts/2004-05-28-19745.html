<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479126688">The following isn&#39;t my list, and I&#39;m not on it.  I&#39;m just making the <br/>
announcement because I think it&#39;s a good idea!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingBasics/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingBasics/</a><br/>
<br/>
From the webpage:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Basics<br/>
<br/>
A list designed for those new to the philosophy of unschooling. Ask <br/>
experienced unschoolers all those niggling questions, and find out how unschooling <br/>
works in real families.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re familiar with John Holt&#39;s work, but unsure of how to begin or what <br/>
an unschooling day really looks like, this is a place for you to <br/>
discuss,question, ponder and become deeply familiar with natural learning and how it <br/>
affects our entire lives. From parenting issues to learning from the whole wide <br/>
world and beyond, come explore the issues that unschooling families have dealt <br/>
with in the past and how to get beyond &quot;school-think&quot; to a joyful unschooling <br/>
lifestyle! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
SO if anyone here is feeling crowded on this list by the experiences of <br/>
people who&#39;ve been unschooling a long time, that might be a place to get more basic <br/>
info.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll warn you though, It&#39;s RenA  and KellyL and they&#39;re more radical than I <br/>
am, I think. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m promoting other lists and info, <br/>
here&#39;s a collection and if any of you know good lists to add to that, write <br/>
to me on the side at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>.<br/>
