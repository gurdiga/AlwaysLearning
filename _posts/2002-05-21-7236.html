<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183912089">I&#39;m trying to book a flight for my dh, Eric, from Los Angeles to Las <br/>
Vegas for next week. I&#39;ve spent hours on the internet trying to find a <br/>
&quot;deal&quot;; the best one was $71, which I should have snapped up but didn&#39;t. <br/>
Now all I can find are fares of $95 and up.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know any tips about how to do this? Also, a naive question: <br/>
how does a travel agent make money? They don&#39;t charge the customer, <br/>
correct?<br/>

commissions, but this system recently changed. You&#39;re better off using the <br/>
internet now. If he can fly on Tuesday or Wednesday, fares might be cheaper.<br/>

p.m. and I can&#39;t risk booking him on a flight he won&#39;t be able to make.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know priceline was for hotel rooms too! Next time....<br/>
