I&#39;m actually going to be camping ( in cabins)with Elissa starting <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
It is an unschoolers camp in Frederick MD.  I think about 15 families <br/>
are coming this time.<br/>
A group there started it a few years ago.  I met the organizer on the <br/>
beach on Assateague last summer and we became friends and she invited <br/>
me to come last fall.  I live about 4 hours away.  We had a blast!<br/>
I was informed Elissa and a few families from her area will be coming <br/>
this time and I&#39;m am excited to meet her.<br/>
It&#39;s Sun. thru Thurs.  <br/>
I unfortunately have to travel to find like minded souls, but it&#39;s <br/>
well worth it.<br/>
