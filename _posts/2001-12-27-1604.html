<br/>
When I was 19, my housemates in college tormented me for hours one night, and <br/>
I was almost in tears, when one of them said kindly &quot;write some down.&quot;  So I <br/>
got it and I could sleep that night.  But their method was just this:<br/>
<br/>
It is green, but it&#39;s not blue.<br/>
It is funny, but it&#39;s not hilarious.<br/>
It is good, but it&#39;s not great.<br/>

And written down makes them way too easy, but then again I shouldn&#39;t wish the <br/>
torment I went through on anyone! <br/>

We do have so much fun, most of the time.<br/>
Lexie told me a few weeks back that she tries<br/>
to be mad at me but then I make her laugh!  I<br/>
do use humor a lot to defuse situations, very<br/>
necessary with my 3 year old.<br/>
