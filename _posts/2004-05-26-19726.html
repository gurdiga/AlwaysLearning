<br/>
Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said she and her dad had been talking and he said to ask me something.  <br/>
The question was this:  If (if it&#39;s true) that long ago Britons or their <br/>
ancestors counted to twelve with fingers and hands, did they count six on one <br/>
hand, or ten and then 11 and 12?<br/>
<br/>
I said I didn&#39;t think there was any possible way to know that, since most <br/>
evidence about culture in those days is linguistic evidence.  (There are also <br/>
&quot;middens&quot; so archeologists can figure out what people ate, and there are graves <br/>
and bones and sometimes evidence of dwellings.)<br/>
<br/>
Without myths or religous clues, and without linguistic evidence, I think it <br/>
must be impossible to say.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pedophilia&quot; is a greek word, and they&#39;re famous/infamous/stereotyped as <br/>
being (or having once been) a society in which men had sex with boys and sheep.  <br/>
(Scotland gets that later accusation/jab too.)<br/>
<br/>
In British English they have the term &quot;buggery&quot; for butt-fucking.  American <br/>
English has no such term (just the mondo-gross term I used just before this).  <br/>
[A young American friend who attended English schools for a few years got in <br/>
trouble for telling a boy who was picking on her to &quot;bug off.&quot;  What was a <br/>
benign American-English term was a nasty Brit phrase.]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sodomy&quot; is a non-Greek legal term, but there&#39;s no real evidence that Sodom <br/>
(the Biblical city from which that term comes) was guilty of that particular <br/>
sin.  The Bible story is vague.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has always existed.  It even happens in the animal world.  I was watching<br/>
our chickens yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
We are in the unfortunate position of having too many roosters right now and<br/>
they fight over hens.  One rooster is a different, smaller breed and he<br/>
loses out.  We have two chicks that are just starting to sexually mature<br/>
(probably comparable to a 10 or 11 year old human).  The little rooster<br/>
attempts to mate with the chicks, scaring them to death.<br/>
<br/>
What is interesting is that the alpha rooster runs to the rescue of the<br/>
chicks but never attempts to mate with them himself.<br/>
