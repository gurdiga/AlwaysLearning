<div id="ygrps-yiv-347294058">In some potting soil we bought, in which the plants are already big  <br/>
in peat pots and nearly ready to take outside, some little mushrooms  <br/>
have come up.  They&#39;re delicate and nearly clear and look like jelly  <br/>
fish.<br/>
<br/>
Marty wondered if they could be related to jelly fish.  I honestly  <br/>
have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know much about such tiny mystery foreign things?<br/>

<br/>
Not exactly.  But I had a &quot;Wow, that&#39;s amazing!&quot; moment listening to Bill Bryson&#39;s A Short History of Nearly Everything  (a few months ago) where he talked about slime molds as a species.<br/>
<br/>
p. 308, quote :<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For years slime molds were claimed as protozoa by zoologists and as fungi by mycologists, though most people could see they really didn&#39;t belong anywhere.  When genetic testing arrived, people in lab coats were surprised to find that slime molds were so distinctive and peculiar that they weren&#39;t directly related to anything else in nature, and sometimes not even to each other.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, large colonies of slime mold can apparently bunch up and travel like a slug.  <br/>
<br/>
(So, I jumped tracks on you a little, but it seems like a wildly cool topic.  It&#39;s almost too wild to believe -- in the newspaper I would suspect it was an April Fool&#39;s hoax.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found a photo of one.  It&#39;s on a mushroom page by someone who does  <br/>
know about mushrooms, who also thinks it&#39;s a mystery.  It&#39;s the one  <br/>
by the paper match head.  Some of mine are bigger, and I did look at  <br/>
it under a microscope and didn&#39;t need a slide because we have a top- <br/>
and-bottom lit binocular microscope.  That&#39;s how I know how clear it  <br/>
is, close-up.<br/>

So there are living things on this planet as different as bunched-up  <br/>
travelling slime-mold, and slugs, and butterflies, and whales, and  <br/>
eels, and crows, and yet on Star Trek all the aliens look like  <br/>
people. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Speaking of Star Trek ...<br/>
<br/>
Did you know they&#39;re making new old episodes?<br/>
<br/>
Some of the original people are involved in the project. It&#39;s all  <br/>
donated time. The episodes are downloadable for free and watchable on  <br/>
Windows Media Player. (Some have been converted to other formats.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a faq about the project:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.startreknewvoyages.com/1024/faq.php">http://www.startreknewvoyages.com/1024/faq.php</a><br/>
<br/>
The set and sounds and camera angles all look like the original show.  <br/>
The special effects are better.  I&#39;ve only watched the beginning of  <br/>
the pilot episode so far and the acting&#39;s a bit stiff but I peeked at  <br/>
the 1st episode and they seem to have relaxed and aren&#39;t obviously  <br/>
trying to channel the original actors.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one of the mirror sites to download the two episodes available  <br/>
so far. Don&#39;t do the vingnette &quot;Center Seat&quot; first like I did. It&#39;s  <br/>
very uncomfortable to watch like 3 guys at a Trek convention  <br/>
pretending to be Sulu, de Salle and Kirk. ;-) Maybe it was filmed first.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.newvoyages.pauley79.com/">http://www.newvoyages.pauley79.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s a list of mirror sites at the New  <br/>
Voyages site:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.startreknewvoyages.com/1024/episodes.php">http://www.startreknewvoyages.com/1024/episodes.php</a><br/>
<br/>
though the list of episodes at that site is confusing. Come What May  <br/>
is the Pilot and In Harm&#39;s Way is the 1st episode. (There&#39;s a link  <br/>
there to software to &quot;convert to Mac&quot; but that&#39;s not necessary.  <br/>
Windows Media Player works fine on Macs.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, tribbles aren&#39;t sentient life forms; they&#39;re more like guinea <br/>
pigs or hamsters.  Hortas, on the other hand, *are* alien &quot;people,&quot; but <br/>
look like giant rubber vomit on a shag rug.  Otherwise, most of &#39;em do <br/>
look like us, but they explained why in a Next Generation episode  <br/>
