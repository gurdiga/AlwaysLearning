<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563953542">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
Our family is a mixed bag as well.....Anglo, Latino, Cherokee, and Black.<br/>
My oldest kids tend to look Anglo, but my younger ones, particularly the<br/>
2yo, don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be appalled at the comments people would make not knowing my kids<br/>
were mixed.  I am horrified at what occasionally slips out of people on<br/>
accident now that they KNOW my kids are mixed.  My brother in law, who I<br/>
hate in general not because of this, acts like he just loves my kids, has<br/>
them crawling all over him, etc..  Then made some comment awhile back about<br/>
how &quot;beaners&quot; should stay south.  It broke my heart to think of my kids, who<br/>
are under the impression that he loves them, hearing that crap.  Luckily we<br/>
see him less than once a year.<br/>
<br/>
I would much rather deal with the people with shaved heads and KKK bumper<br/>
stickers than to deal with hidden racism.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen &quot;Dragon&quot; about Bruce Lee?  It deals, very well I think, with<br/>
Linda Lee (who is Anglo) coming to see racism through her husband&#39;s eyes.<br/>
