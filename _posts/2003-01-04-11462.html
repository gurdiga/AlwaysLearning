<div id="ygrps-yiv-569014719">We had family for Christmas, my husbands sister and her husband and their<br/>
two kids.   The boys are 13 and almost 17.   <br/>
They came late the Sunday before Christmas, and we all stayed up into the<br/>
wee hours, talking until the kids passed out. <br/>
Monday we went shopping for stocking stuffers for everyone and wandered<br/>
around and ate Chinese food and stopped in a funky little shop that sells<br/>
all things Celtic.   We listened to the guy play the uilleann (sp) pipes<br/>
and there was a woman there buy and trying out low whistles.   Very cool.<br/>
  And we found the most amazing chocolate mints there...<br/>
We came home and watched National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation.  <br/>
Tuesday we cooked and listened to music and baked and talked and strung<br/>
dried berries and fruit for the birds, then hung it in the pine tree and<br/>
watched the dog try to jump for it.   <br/>
The 17 year old is a musician and he played guitar for us and little bits<br/>
on the piano.   He liked some of the old songs I learned from my aunt and<br/>
tried to play them.   We looked for the music on the Internet and<br/>
couldn&#39;t find it, but he left with a good idea how to play some of them<br/>
on guitar.   <br/>
We went to the Catholic service Christmas eve, it was beautiful.   The<br/>
only one who&#39;s Catholic is my brother in law but his family goes at<br/>
Christmas.   David and Dylan had never been.  That&#39;s amazing because even<br/>
I had been before, me, the heathen, with Catholic friends.<br/>
Christmas morning we opened stockings and made a huge breakfast and<br/>
opened more gifts.  After visitors and neighbors had wandered in and out<br/>
again we made some soup and loaded up and went snowshoeing.   We haven&#39;t<br/>
had a lot of snow so we drove north of town to Millers lake and finally<br/>
found enough snow to make it worthwhile.   We wanted to go across the<br/>
lake so David went out first to check the ice.   There is an enticing<br/>
little island in the middle and we thought that would be a good<br/>
destination but the ice wasn&#39;t strong enough and David had to come back. <br/>
 He&#39;s not very tall, and kind of stocky, and he came back to shore with<br/>
the determination of a small bulldozer, all that adrenaline I suppose,<br/>
and a big grin and one wet boot.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
We headed into the trees instead.   It was a glorious day.   Dylan and<br/>
Evan went way out ahead of us slower folk and liked being the trail<br/>
blazers.   They saw an owl and came back to report it.   We saw elk and<br/>
deer. <br/>
I saw the first Blue jays and Stellers jays I&#39;ve seen all winter. <br/>
We stopped and built a fire and ate hot soup and crusty bread.   We made<br/>
hot chai and everyone was happily buzzing for the hike out.   We couldn&#39;t<br/>
feel our toes when we got back to the cars.<br/>
On the drive out from the lake we stopped where we had found a deer skull<br/>
last summer, a big one with the rack still on it.  We couldn&#39;t find it<br/>
again in the snow, but there were juniper trees there on the south side<br/>
of this little hill and they were full of Cedar waxwings.   Evan said it<br/>
was the Christmas tree that God made.<br/>
 <br/>
We all changed into warm things when we got home and watched &quot;A Christmas<br/>
story.&quot;  The boys knew the dialog by heart.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday everyone had different plans and my plan was just to stay in bed<br/>
forever.  The dogs got me up at six but I went back to bed after they ate<br/>
and went outside.   David went downstairs at seven thirty and I heard him<br/>
say, &quot;Oh my God!&quot;  Imagining a pile of poo or a big huge hair ball or<br/>
something nasty I sprang out of bed and flew downstairs to find the<br/>
Christmas tree had fallen over.   I hadn&#39;t heard a thing.  It was<br/>
vertical at six, I had both eyes open, I would have noticed.   David is<br/>
the get excited and panic a little type so he ran back upstairs to get<br/>
his shoes on and I just grabbed that tree and yanked it up, Bruce Willis<br/>
style.   If it had gone south it would have leaned up against the big<br/>
window and maybe slithered down from there.  If it had gone east it would<br/>
have cleared off my plate rail and all my stoneware and Polish pottery.  <br/>
West and it would have got the piano and all the pictures and candles and<br/>
the little paper model of the Globe theater.  But it went quietly and<br/>
happily north, and laid right down through the kitchen doorway.  Only the<br/>
tree topper broke.  I was feeling a little sentimental about that, it was<br/>
the topper we bought our first Christmas together.  Nothing special, the<br/>
box still said $2.99, we bought it at the Pay n Pack in Wasilla, Alaska. <br/>
 Then, Dylan told me it wasn&#39;t that topper made our Christmas&#39;s special,<br/>
but our Christmas&#39;s that made the topper special.   He bought me new<br/>
topper that afternoon, an old fashioned looking Santa.  <br/>
<br/>
David had to work New years day but the rest of us stayed up and finally<br/>
drank some of that bottle of champagne that had been in our fridge since<br/>
New years eve 2000.  It wasn&#39;t very good champagne to begin with, and the<br/>
ageing didn&#39;t improve it any.   We built blue bird houses New years day<br/>
and some have gone back to Colorado now, but the others will go up when<br/>
we get the information from the bluebird trails folks about where to<br/>
place them.   Always and forever now we have to maintain them for the<br/>
bluebirds, like responsible landlords.   <br/>
The first bird I saw in 2003 wasn&#39;t a bluebird, but the pigeon with a<br/>
broken wing and pneumonia who is recovering (noisily) in our living room.<br/>
  But after that there were little House finches.<br/>
<br/>
We couldn&#39;t have asked for a nicer holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Today I took my mother (she&#39;ll be 81 in March) and her sister (85)<br/>
shopping in the next town at Wal-mart. <br/>
Today was the third and that means it&#39;s the day these ladies get their<br/>
social security checks.  It also, always means Wal-mart day.   <br/>
I hate Wal-mart.   But I got to go to the thrift store and I found used<br/>
Pendleton wool shirts, just right for cutting up and making rugs, SUCH a<br/>
find, five good shirts for $12.00.   I was in heaven until I got home and<br/>
David said he liked them and they&#39;d be good work shirts and how COULD I<br/>
cut up such good shirts for hooked rugs?<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll cut up his old cotton shirts tomorrow for braided rugs<br/>
instead.&lt;g&gt;  One way or another, we will have rugs.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s playing a Crash Bandicoot game he found for Playstation at the<br/>
thrift store, while his dad gives pointers.  None of the pointers are<br/>
helpful and there&#39;s a lot of good natured arguing going on out there.  <br/>
I&#39;m off to walk the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you&#39;re all recovering from too much food and too much cheer.<br/>

Maybe I should change my font.  I read it &quot;with the rock still on it.&quot;<br/>

I thought, &quot;DAMN!  Somebody killed a deer with a big rock!&quot;<br/>

Maybe I just need to wipe my glasses off and drink some tea.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The brother in law along on that adventure is a big he man hunter guy.  <br/>
He once paid a small fortune to hunt brown bear in the Yukon, where the<br/>
guide baited, and then took his pick which big, hand fed bear to shoot. <br/>
My husband told him he might have just gone to the Denver zoo, same big<br/>
type bears, no travel and the fine would have been cheaper than the<br/>
outfitter. <br/>
Anyway when we saw a big bull elk he said how he wished he had his gun<br/>
and how well that big elk head would look over his fire place.   <br/>
The mind of a person who can look at a live majestic animal and think the<br/>
dead stuffed thing is more beautiful is beyond me in the first place, but<br/>
just because I&#39;m mouthy I told him a real man would charge the bull and<br/>
wrestle it to the ground and choke the life out of it with his bare<br/>
hands.  (I didn&#39;t think about using a rock).   Then and only then would<br/>
the trophy be a real trophy and of course the politically correct thing<br/>
to do would be to offer stud service to the herd.   Carl is NOT a Montana<br/>
native, where men are men and sheep are nervous, he&#39;s from Wisconsin and<br/>
Catholic on top of that so that part was wholly unappealing to him.   <br/>
But for the rest of the day we didn&#39;t have to hear about how he&#39;d like to<br/>
kill stuff.  <br/>
I bet I know what he&#39;d have really liked to choke.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think a knife would be fair, especially a knife he made himself of iron he <br/>
dug and smelted by hand.<br/>

<br/>
Susan Brownmiller would have a lot to say about that.  The spoils of war <br/>
through the ages is the spreading of the victors&#39; semen in the surviving <br/>
female population.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you were politically incorrect, but anthropologically and <br/>
historically dead on.<br/>
(Except the small inter-species detail.)<br/>

But the bull is still happily with his herd and Carl is, maybe, at the<br/>
zoo, and I still have time to learn political correctness.   (will have<br/>
to pencil it in between raiding experimentation labs and throwing blood<br/>
on fur clad models).&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s another story.  My husband hunts for our meat when he can.  Years ago<br/>
he was out hunting and saw some antlers sticking up from behind a big rock.<br/>
He circled carefully around to where he&#39;d be able to see the whole deer.<br/>
When he got there, it was just a skull and antlers, probably an old cougar<br/>
kill.  He brought it home, and after some years I made a basket out of it,<br/>
using the antlers as part of the basket structure but letting them stick out<br/>
above the basket.  It was really cool.<br/>
