&quot;When I made the suggestion about saying something to the effect<br/>
of, â€œIf you want to have your teeth fall out of your head, thatâ€™s<br/>
fine, but itâ€™s unfriendly to make the rest of us smell a plaque-<br/>
filled mouth,â€ I did not realize that it would be taken as something<br/>
so rude&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I read this, I thought you were being humorous. In fact, it was in<br/>
response to my request for help with my bad breathed :) son who stopped<br/>
brushing. I never thought you meant to be rude. I think that email is easily<br/>
misinterpreted, since it doesn&#39;t have those nuances of inflection in our<br/>
voices, facial expressions and body language. And some people may think that<br/>
literal words can be harmful, no matter what the nuances.<br/>
<br/>
I was called on using the term &quot;psycho-like tantrums&quot; which was also said in<br/>
fun, with humor being my intention feeling like a had a camaraderie with a<br/>
group of parents who had struggled with their children&#39;s emotions as I had.<br/>
I thought it would inspire a response of something like, &quot;yes, those<br/>
tantrums have made me want to just scream&quot; (even though we don&#39;t). And maybe<br/>
some did think that. I don&#39;t know. What I got was something similar to what<br/>
you got. So now I try to be very accurate in my communication here, for fear<br/>
of misinterpretation, or worse.<br/>
Accuracy is very very important here. Words are all we have to go on since <br/>
this is a written medium.<br/>
There are many words our culture uses in relation to children, some of which <br/>
have become so ingrained that we no longer realize that they may be harmful to <br/>
others, but also to our own view of others.<br/>
 Some members here (I would think many, since I have been on and read this <br/>
list continually since it&#39;s birth) try to point out that these words may not <br/>
necessarily be BAD but yet are not helping families to move forward to a place of <br/>
mutual respect. Choosing words that are uplifting and positive, words that <br/>
encourage trust and faith in a relationship, are very important when it comes to <br/>
unschooling/mindful parenting. Sometimes we don&#39;t realize when others are <br/>
hurt by things we say, especially when the receiver of those words is able to <br/>
hide their feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Life&#39;s challenges are not supposed to paralyze you;<br/>
They&#39;re supposed to help you discover who you are. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, what Elissa said.<br/>
<br/>
Someone recently posted this quote by Wayne Dyer on the Unschoolingbasics<br/>
list:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &quot;If you change the way you look at things; the things you look at<br/>
&gt;&gt; will change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which could be a catch phrase -- or catch sentence ;-) -- for getting<br/>
unschooling. And a catch sentence for the discussion lists (AlwaysLearning,<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion, unschoolingbasics and the Unschooling.com boards)<br/>
that exist to help people get unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
While there may be members who would agree their kids have &quot;psycho tantrums&quot;<br/>
the lists aren&#39;t a place to trade sympathy for those feelings, but a place<br/>
to ask how others get beyond those feelings to a better place.<br/>
<br/>
I think negative phrases and thoughts about our kids are used for<br/>
self-protection. When our kids are being less than perfect, we can feel<br/>
we&#39;re doing something wrong, that their behavior is a reflection on us and<br/>
our skills as a parent. But negative phrases are a way of separating &quot;them&quot;<br/>
from &quot;us&quot;. Kids become &quot;other&quot;, that is, other than us, other than (adult)<br/>
human. So it becomes okay for &quot;them&quot; to act in bizarre ways and for us not<br/>
to be able to do anything about it. And it&#39;s even better when we can get<br/>
agreement from other parents that, yes, kids are &quot;other&quot;, they&#39;re almost<br/>
alien creatures in their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
The lists aren&#39;t about stuffing down guilt or about shrugging off guilt.<br/>
They&#39;re about getting to a better place: seeing kids as fellow humans. Kids<br/>
may react to situations in ways that would be bizarre reactions for adults<br/>
but the emotions behind the reactions are pure human emotions. We can feel<br/>
we&#39;d never whine about not getting to watch a TV show, we&#39;d never have a<br/>
melt down in the middle of a store. But if we turn our thougts around to<br/>
imagine a situation where we *would* whine or we *would* have a meltdown,<br/>
then it&#39;s easier to offer the comfort and attentiveness they&#39;re asking for<br/>
and to recognize when we&#39;re causing it by ignoring the subtle signs of build<br/>
up.<br/>

 <br/>
Being the mother of very dramatic and dynamic children who, when in the throes of puberty and all of the hormonal and chemical imbalances that go along with that, have had what could accurately be described as &quot;seemingly psychotic&quot; outbursts (as they are so intense one would indeed wonder if there is some sort of psychosis at work there -- (and with my having two bipolar siblings, it is not out of the realm of possibility)) I have indeed struggled with finding a loving and kind way of helping my children to cope when they become emotionally overwhelmed.  I don&#39;t find it negative or insulting to my children to refer to their behavior in these terms (I may not have thought to use that particular description myself, but I understood it when I read it.)  Granted, it may not be to someone else&#39;s taste to refer to their children that way, in which case, a helpful response could be given using the sensitive writer&#39;s preferred terminology which could then give the first parent a new way of<br/>
 referring to that particular behavior.  This way, the IDEA is being discussed rather than the terminology.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, back to the point of trying to be helpful: when your older child is having these struggles, you might try revisiting the successful techniques you used when they were toddlers and modifying and reapplying them now, i.e.: making sure they know they are being heard and that their position is respected, being gentle and consistent and available, etc.  The transition through the teens is often very similar to the transition our children go through as little ones.  <br/>

I was composing a response to this thread with a similar message, but I just<br/>
erased it because you said it so well Kathryn.  Thank you! I am glad to see<br/>
that I&#39;m not alone in encouraging us to respond to people&#39;s content, support<br/>
them as the intelligent parents that they are, and if the wording bothers<br/>
someone, give an alternative that they prefer, being self-responsible that<br/>
they have an issue with it, without the lecture. I would SOOO have preferred<br/>
someone to have said, &quot;I understand what you are referring to. I am a little<br/>
sensitive to the using the word &quot;psychotic&quot; when referring to children&#39;s<br/>
behavior. Maybe strongly emotional says it better?&quot; This would not have<br/>
changed my behavior in any way with my children, since I am very sensitive,<br/>
compassionate, and connected to them, and typically don&#39;t use any negative<br/>
terminology with them, but it would have made me be more careful with my<br/>
terminology on this list, out of respect for those who have issues with<br/>
whatever the term was. It&#39;s nice to know that someone understood what I<br/>
meant.<br/>

not. It&#39;s a discussion group.<br/>
<br/>
What we discuss are ideas. And words are used to express those ideas. For a<br/>
discussion group, it is *not* useful to assume that the words someone has<br/>
written don&#39;t mean what they appear to mean. If someone is asking for help,<br/>
and they realize from the responses they get that they&#39;ve used words that<br/>
paint an inaccurate image of their problem, then they need to choose words<br/>
that will help people form a more accurate image. What is *not* helpful is<br/>
to defend the words they&#39;ve used that painted the inaccurate picture.<br/>
<br/>
And before there&#39;s more energy put into some false &quot;group consensus&quot; about<br/>
how the list should operate, it would make sense to wait for the list owner<br/>
(Sandra) to return from the conference.<br/>
