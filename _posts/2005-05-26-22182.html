<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093738933">I think HSC is a really great group, and they have an extensive <br/>
website.  One place to start is their info on getting started <br/>
homeschooling, titled &quot;From Chaos to Confidence&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to their conference in Sacramento in August with a group of <br/>
friends (from San Jose), and it&#39;s my eighth time attending.  This can be <br/>
fairly expensive if you go for the whole thing and stay at the hotel, <br/>
but less expensive if you are close enough to drop by just for one day.<br/>
<br/>
The inimitable Pam Sorooshian is a featured speaker this year.  I <br/>
guarantee that unschooling parents will find her presentations <br/>
fascinating and enheartening.<br/>
<br/>
As a crude rule of thumb, in California it seems like the bigger the <br/>
city the worse the schools and the bigger the homeschooling group.  Some <br/>
suburbs and rural areas seem to have a thinner smattering of homeschoolers.<br/>

**What part of California? There are quite a few unschoolers, and <br/>
there&#39;s a state organization (good general info, not specifically <br/>
unschooling) and a fun conference once a year in Sacramento, and you can <br/>
still get to lists like this, even if you&#39;re in California. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

They have county contacts, and a magazine.**</div>
