<div id="ygrps-yiv-555302292">Diana quoted a Maslow summary:<br/>
<br/>
-=3. We should help people *discover their vocation in life,* their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; calling, fate or destiny. This is especially focused on finding the  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>right<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; career and the right mate.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe in &quot;calling,  fate or destiny,&quot; except in  <br/>
retrospect.   I don&#39;t think on a planet of over six billion people who  <br/>
fly around from continent to continent all the time that anyone  <br/>
anymore should think of any &quot;right mate.&quot;  Certainly not THE right mate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just in from two solid hours of working in the yard, digging,  <br/>
undoing and turning a big compost bin, clearing out a big two-year-old  <br/>
(or more) pile of branches and small trees and an old christmas tree  <br/>
and moving rocks, and when I do things like that, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Keith won&#39;t consider it &quot;cleaned out,&quot; because there will be an  <br/>
unexpected pile of stuff for him to do.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, one of the things I was thinking was fate and destiny and  <br/>
calling.  I often do think about things I don&#39;t believe in.<br/>
<br/>
Because Facebook is for whatever reasons cooking up, lots of old  <br/>
friends of mine have joined lately, so some of us are talking about  <br/>
when we were kids, and some of my SCA friends from 25, 30 years ago  <br/>
are catching up and telling me stories, and lots of people I know are  <br/>
retiring from &quot;professions&quot; and callings.  Several of them are  <br/>
teachers, were teachers, retired and are teaching in different  <br/>
capacities now, and they&#39;re summarizing years of work and change and  <br/>
growth and confusion on facebook.<br/>
<br/>
No generation ever has had this before.  When people wrote a lot of  <br/>
letters--the 18th century and that, when people &quot;wrote their letters&quot;  <br/>
every morning (kind of like checking e-mail now) and &quot;entertained  <br/>
callers&quot; in the afternoon (kind of like chatrooms or going out for  <br/>
coffee now) they seem to have tended neither to spill their guts nor  <br/>
to talk much philosophy.   There were niceties and formulaeic  <br/>
conversations.<br/>
<br/>
But here I find myself, being me, summarizing what I&#39;ve done in thirty  <br/>
years, to various kinds of people who know me in various kinds of  <br/>
ways--many of them very will, in one window or phase of my life or  <br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting.   I suppose I&#39;m still &quot;involved in education,&quot; as  <br/>
that goes.<br/>
I can&#39;t retire, because I didn&#39;t stick with any one job long enough to  <br/>
&quot;retire.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The things I wanted to do when I was little--be a teacher, a  <br/>
missionary or a magazine writer--all rolled together to be  <br/>
SandraDodd.com, maybe, and this list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
