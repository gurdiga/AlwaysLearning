A scary example (not so good for sharing with a troubled child):  The  <br/>
Bad Seed, the original version.  I&#39;m just betting that&#39;s been watched  <br/>
or discussed by those writing or directing or acting in Desperate  <br/>
Housewives.  Lynette and Kayla.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, I just did a little google search and found references to  <br/>
just that:  Rachel Fox, who plays Kayla:<br/>
<br/>
********<br/>
&quot;She is every parent&#39;s worst nightmare,&quot; said Fox. &quot;She does so many  <br/>
evil things, I wish I could tell you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Desperate Housewives&quot; creator Marc Cherry took his inspiration for  <br/>
Kayla from the 1956 film &quot;The Bad Seed,&quot; in which Patty McCormack  <br/>
played a girl who did whatever it took to get what she wanted.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They asked me to watch [the movie], so I did,&quot; Fox said. &quot;I love it.  <br/>
It was kind of scary, but Patty McCormack did a really good job. I  <br/>
loved her evil look.&quot;<br/>
****************************<br/>
And the actress did such a good job at using that same evil look that  <br/>
I thought of the movie, which I haven&#39;t seen for 30 years or more.<br/>

I just love recognizing the direct influences of prior works on current stuff.  Brilliant!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, no examples are coming to my after 40 mind right now, but my son and I both <br/>
enjoy pointing them out when we see them.  It&#39;s fun for me that he&#39;s seeing his own--it used <br/>
to be just me pointing them out, beginning of course, with all the stories that draw from the  <br/>
J. R. R. Tolkien well.  Sometimes I see a character, and I just know that the author had read <br/>
the same book, etc., and I feel this great intellectual connection.  References like that are like <br/>
a library of common language.  Fun.<br/>

  For some reason this made me think of the movie Bad Ronald. It was a TV movie from the 70&#39;s about a boy who accidentally kills another kid and his mom makes a false wall and hides him. After some time she goes into the hospital, then dies and Ronald is left in the house. A family comes and buys the house and one of the kids find him. I don&#39;t remember how it ends. Does anyone else remember it, and how it ends?<br/>

<br/>
Plot description<br/>
<br/>
Ronald Wilby (Scott Jacoby) is a nerdy high school youth with budding  <br/>
artistic talent and a predilection for fantasy. His mother (Kim  <br/>
Hunter of Planet of the Apes fame) is an over-bearing motherly type,  <br/>
in need of surgery, of a similar stripe to those featured in Carrie  <br/>
and the creation of Norman Bates. He is often shamed and mocked for  <br/>
his behavior and mannerisms. His mother&#39;s plans are for him to become  <br/>
a doctor and cure her illness.<br/>
<br/>
One afternoon while asking Leanne Matthews out he is ridiculed by her  <br/>
friends. As he runs home he knocks over her younger sister Carole.  <br/>
Carole taunts Ronald, at which point he pushes her over,  <br/>
inadvertently killing her. He hides the body and confesses to his  <br/>
mother. Fearing the police will not believe that it was accidental,  <br/>
Ronald and his mother fill in the door frame to the downstairs  <br/>
bathroom and convert the closed off space to a living quarters for  <br/>
Ronald. The plan is for him to hide in the room until the incident  <br/>
blows over. He was only to come out when his mother said it was safe.  <br/>
Mrs Wilby told the police that Ronald ran away.<br/>
<br/>
Ronald&#39;s mother keeps paying attention to what the neighbors and  <br/>
others are saying about the young girl&#39;s disappearance and tells  <br/>
Ronald that when it&#39;s safe, he can return to a normal life. One  <br/>
afternoon she is taken into a hospital for surgery, from which she  <br/>
dies. In the meantime, Ronald has created a fantasy world in his own  <br/>
head consisting of a prince and a princess that live happily until a  <br/>
devil appears and a struggle begins.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after her death, the house is sold to a new family. After  <br/>
they move in, the second act of the movie begins.<br/>
<br/>
As Ronald needs food to eat, and begins to crave human interaction,  <br/>
mysterious disappearances of food and odd noises are experienced by  <br/>
the new family. The youngest daughter of the family becomes  <br/>
identified with Ronald&#39;s princess and he identifies himself as the  <br/>
prince. Darren Matthews, the boyfriend of the oldest daughter (who  <br/>
was well liked by the family), and brother of the previously  <br/>
mentioned Matthews girls becomes identified with the monster that  <br/>
threatens their happiness. Ronald&#39;s goal is to &quot;regain&quot; his princess  <br/>
and remove anything, including the members of her family, that stops  <br/>
that dream from becoming reality.<br/>

there to be natural water on a high mesa like that, in the desert.  I&#39;ll put it on the list, but I&#39;m <br/>
sure it&#39;s a better movie for people who live far from such formations.    And any kids who <br/>
love that movie should probably have it pointed out to them, if they go hiking, not to climb a <br/>
mesa looking for a spring. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Sure!<br/>
<br/>
Kid to kid relationships:<br/>
<br/>
The Sandlot- group of friends, also some relationships with adults, both parents and others, but the story focuses on the kids<br/>
<br/>
Brother Bear- 3 brothers, and an adopted brother of sorts.  My favorite animated movie.<br/>
<br/>
The Outsiders- group of friends<br/>
<br/>
The Goonies- group of friends<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both kid-kid and kid-adult:<br/>
<br/>
Whale Rider- Girl&#39;s relationship with her parents and grandparents, and her culture.  Also some interaction between her and local kids.  Awesome movie.<br/>
 <br/>
Tuck Everlasting- older kids, teens, love<br/>
<br/>
Christmas Story- Boy and his brother growing up, lots of him ignoring his brother, some sweetness.  Lots of interactions with friends.  Many examples of not so great kid-parent relationships.  Maybe my favorite movie, close anyway.<br/>
<br/>
E.T.- Kid-kid, kid-alien, and kid-adult relationships.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Beetlejuice- Mostly kid being ignored by parents, ghosts treat her nice.  No other kids in movie I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
It is funny that Holes was just being mentioned, Richard just found our long, long lost Holes movie in his uncle&#39;s truck tonight.  I figured it was gone forever, almost threw away the case!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654413827">Strange connection, but Christmas story being on the list reminded me<br/>
that when I was a kid my siblings and I loved to watch one of Bill<br/>
Cosby&#39;s stand up shows, &quot;Bill Cosby, Himself&quot;.  It is on DVD now.  He<br/>
spends a lot of time talking about his kids so there is a ton of<br/>
parent child stuff and some description of kid/kid stuff.  I was one<br/>
of 5 kids and there was a sort of wildness of life and much wider<br/>
variety of interactions with so many of us, that the perfect 2 kid<br/>
families on tv seemed alien to our lives and this seemed more real and<br/>
we could identify with it more (even though no parent in my family<br/>
ever announced &quot;There will be beatings!&quot; as he describes his wife<br/>
doing).  Not an unschooling familing, but in spite of the discipline<br/>
it seemed very real and loving as well as very very funny.<br/>

  Love these movies!! Whale Rider is awesome (and filmed in New Zealand so great scenery). Tuck Everlasting is such a fantastic film! I love the mom in it. The Christmas Story is really funny. We still say &#39;frageelee&#39; whenever we see the word fragile &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
