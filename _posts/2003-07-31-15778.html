<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882981804">I was at another list today, hearing a complaint about THIS group <br/>
(Gosh I&#39;m sick of all the whining lately) and I just had to say <br/>
something HERE, as to not disrupt another list with my frustration.<br/>
<br/>
This list is for die hard unschoolers. It&#39;s not a newbie list for <br/>
figuring it all out...although I&#39;ve seen newbie questions handled <br/>
quite patiently several times if they are not overly annoying.<br/>
I read the introduction again and thought it was pretty clear:<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure <br/>
unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling discussion--there are <br/>
hundreds of general homeschooling discussions for newcomers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need even MORE of a description Sandra? I hate to think <br/>
people can&#39;t figure it out on their own, but I&#39;m just getting fed up <br/>
with people whining about lists that don&#39;t fit their needs rather <br/>
than just finding lists that do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad to have this little spot of the internet where <br/>
everyone &quot;gets&quot; unschooling in it&#39;s purest form. I guess I&#39;m feeling <br/>
it needs to be very protected! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088397435">A complaint about this group?<br/>
<br/>
Man. <br/>
<br/>
These people are unschooling real kids and still have enough time to<br/>
complain about THIS group?  Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t complain about anything today until just now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We found a moth we&#39;ve never seen before and we&#39;re trying to identify her.<br/>
 We pulled up big radishes today and picked the first peas from our<br/>
little garden.  I have too many zucchini and will have to sneak around<br/>
the neighborhood tonight in my jammies leaving unwanted squashes on the<br/>
neighbor&#39;s door steps.   We practiced a Christmas duet on the piano. (We<br/>
should have started in January.&lt;G&gt;)   We found some inner tubes to take<br/>
to the lake on Tuesday.   We saw ten Killdeer at the river and four<br/>
Spotted Sandpipers.  <br/>
A Hummingbird landed on Dylan&#39;s arm.  We&#39;re starting the new Harry Potter<br/>
book tonight.  It was 93 degrees here today and it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>
hotter tomorrow.  (should make that zucchini grow!)  AND I like this<br/>
list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you had a bummer moment Ren.<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, no complaints.</div>

Hi, Deb --<br/>
<br/>
My peas were done 10 weeks ago and I don&#39;t have any squash yet, although <br/>
I have blossoms.  I have to mock whine that I don&#39;t think you are <br/>
keeping your veggies ON Grade Level!!!!&lt;g&gt;  They sure aren&#39;t growing in <br/>
lock-step with mine.  I guess my peas were in the accelerated program <br/>
and my squash is on some kind of remedial track.  I won&#39;t tell them how <br/>
your veggies are doing, because I wouldn&#39;t want to damage their plant <br/>
esteem.<br/>
<br/>
Is there such a thing as &quot;ungardening&quot;?  Or only &quot;unwatering&quot; and <br/>
&quot;unweeding&quot;?<br/>

that I coudn&#39;t do it before.  I&#39;m so glad to see a nice garden starting, <br/>

My squash plants came up, in like three days after planting.  Great big <br/>
healthy plants. I planted the squash a sidewalk away from my other <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828996463">ooh ooh, someonew as talking about taking squash to neighbors... I saw <br/>
in Reader&#39;s Digest tonight that August 8th is--let me quote--Sneak Some <br/>
Zucchini Onto Your Neighbor&#39;s Porch Night.  <br/>
<br/>
I sure hopes someone leaves it on my porch.  I LOVE fresh squash.  It <br/>
was horrid having to buy it a few weeks ago.  Can&#39;t wait for mine to be <br/>
ready.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping the garden karma will come visit us too.  We do have some <br/>
tomatos coming up and I planted the tomato plants I bought.  Janene <br/>
really wanted to grow blueberries and GRAPE tomatoes.  She is a tomato <br/>
kid, when she was three I had to convince her to not eat the tomatoes <br/>
off the vine--I really mean off the vine, she wouldn&#39;t pick it, she&#39;d <br/>
just bend down and take a bite and then bite the next one.  Please <br/>
Janene, wash it first?  We planted, let&#39;s see, Lettuce, carrots, <br/>
Zucchini, another type of squash (banana?), tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes <br/>
(I LOVE tomatoes too, so a good 1/3 of our garden, which is total 15 x 5 <br/>
feet and about 8 containers are tomatoes) cucumbers (another favorite), <br/>
artichoke (one container), bell peper, lavender, basal, chocolate mint, <br/>
another herb that&#39;s supposed to help with migraine headaches if made <br/>
into a tea) and sunflowers, giant ones, all the way around the edge of <br/>
the garden.  I think when we get back at the beginning of Sept there <br/>
might be food to eat.  Also, I did finally find a grape tomato plant for <br/>
Janene, and we&#39;ll get another container tomorrow to put that in.  Daron, <br/>
you&#39;ve seen our small back yard, so you can imagine how much space is <br/>
devoted to plants.  I also plan on taking a few of the tomatoes and <br/>
maybe the artichoke and bell pepper plants into my classroom, in Sept. <br/>
 I think growing things is good for kids to see, especially these kids.<br/>
<br/>
On a tangent, I subbed in a 3rd grade class today--it was so much fun. <br/>
 I really liked the kids and had a great time.  I was asked to return <br/>
for four days next week, so that is good as I am unpaid this month and <br/>
am planning that extensive vacation.  It really did help me to see the <br/>
difference between Lexie and these other 3rd graders (who will be in 4th <br/>
grade in Sept so a year older than Lexie.)  But they were a lot of fun <br/>
and so sweet and cute.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I borrowed something like 36 books on tape from my school, for us to <br/>
listen to on our trip.  I can&#39;t wait!  <br/>
<br/>
Ok that&#39;s enough, Ineed to go to sleep.<br/>

    Thanks for the lift this morning. ;-) We were counting monarch<br/>
butterflies yesterday on our butterfly bush. Only one moth ;-) I&#39;m hoping to<br/>
see more hummingbirds too. They like that bush. That was really cool that<br/>
that hummingbird landed on Dylans&#39; arm. Wow what a thrill. Up close and<br/>

    I&#39;m sure by Christmas you&#39;ll have it down. What song?<br/>

    Waht a Hoot! Now what about my tomatoes. I really didn&#39;t know I was<br/>
getting cherry tomatoes but here they are. I wanted to make salsa too. Can&#39;t<br/>
exactly doi that since these *ltttle* buggers are eaten as fast as they<br/>
grow. I guess having them right out the back door in planters did help with<br/>
that. LOL!<br/>

Weeeeellll, an &quot;unschooling&quot; answer &lt;g&gt; would be to distract your <br/>

something they really want to do away from home so that you can get them <br/>

called Seedfolks.  I think it&#39;s about on a Jr. High School reading <br/>

&lt;&lt; all the seed packets<br/>
were a year past their &quot;Plant by&quot; date &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a kind of &quot;lather/rinse/repeat&quot; deal, those seed expiration dates.  <br/>
Their claim is it guarantees some percentage of germination, but people have in <br/>
the past few years been getting really excited about old jars of seed found in <br/>
barns and cellars, and doing heirloom plants.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t save the link, but there was archeological work done at some abbey <br/>
from the 15th century (I think, 1400s was the last time the garden had been <br/>
active/full) and some old old plants sprouted just from them having disturbed the <br/>
earth.   Two kinds of plants that hadn&#39;t been growing there in hundreds of <br/>
years.  One was for a dye.  The other, I don&#39;t remember, but they were common <br/>
medieval plants.  I doubt they&#39;re totally died out elsewhere or it would&#39;ve made <br/>
bigger news.<br/>
<br/>
At my old house we had some hollyhocks come up where we&#39;d been mowing and so <br/>
never noticed they were there.  One year we didn&#39;t mow that corner, and some <br/>
of the plants came up really big and strong, so the roots were there even <br/>
though each year it had lost its bid to flower and seed.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, most of the botany I learned came from seed packages, and they <br/>
WANT you to throw the old ones out and buy new ones.   The next most botany I <br/>
learned was in a geology class where they talked about primary growth in the <br/>
desert (and secondary and tertiary), so you can judge how long it&#39;s been since <br/>
surfaces were disturbed, or how long they&#39;ve been undisturbed, by the type of <br/>
plants growing there.<br/>
<br/>
Tumbleweeds can only grow in newly disturbed sandy dirt.   (&quot;Newly&quot; in the <br/>
desert can be a few years, but it can be disturbed by road graders, mowing, <br/>
plowing, water erosion, or by walking and vehicles.)  So they grow along arroyos, <br/>
fence lines, under power lines when people have dug or driving the dirt really <br/>
loose, etc.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe I should try cherry tomatoes, cuz I love &#39;em and maybe they <br/>
will feel sorry enough for me, that they will actually take root &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in a naturally humid and wet place, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in a dry place, tomatoes need a lot of water.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661505082">I didn&#39;t save the link, but there was archeological work done at some abbey &lt;br&gt;from the 15th century (I think, 1400s was the last time the garden had been &lt;br&gt;active/full) and some old old plants sprouted just from them having disturbed the &lt;br&gt;earth.   Two kinds of plants that hadn&#39;t been growing there in hundreds of &lt;br&gt;years.  One was for a dye.  The other, I don&#39;t remember, but they were common &lt;br&gt;medieval plants.  I doubt they&#39;re totally died out elsewhere or it would&#39;ve made &lt;br&gt;bigger news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At my old house we had some hollyhocks come up where we&#39;d been mowing and so &lt;br&gt;never noticed they were there.  One year we didn&#39;t mow that corner, and some &lt;br&gt;of the plants came up really big and strong, so the roots were there even &lt;br&gt;though each year it had lost its bid to flower and seed.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s it, my curiosity is tweeked and I&#39;m going to have to search for that link.<br/>
<br/>
You know when I quit my job and college to stay home w/the kids there were a few things I wanted to learn myself and gardening was one of them. I&#39;m happy to say this summer I have a beautiful, full, green garden consisting of lemon, thai, and sweet basil, tomatoes, rosemary, lavender, several flowers, some of which I don&#39;t even know the name of, I got them really cheap at the swap meet, mint, and papaya trees. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m interested in finding out what plants were native before any building was done on the property. Thanks for reminding me.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Darlene<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46568588">giggle yes I am home still sick but home.<br/>
getting better every day.<br/>
In fact had some great news from area. In Iowa you have 3 options for &quot;home <br/>
school&quot;<br/>
and the best for our needs is  finding someone who understand UN schooling and <br/>
will sign the supervising teacher papers. The place I was telling you about in <br/>
kolona and I had a long talk and they went to the district for me got them to <br/>
let them take me and 2 others (also UN schooler) will show me how to write it <br/>
up for state and be done with it.so We can get it for free, and still do as we <br/>
want. only thing I have to ck out 2 books (free) and read how two&#39;s.I am <br/>
hopeful but keeping options open. and still looking for a separate UN <br/>
schooling teacher with Iowa certifaction so to get out all the way with in my <br/>
fincial budget. and as we are under adoption subsidy in Iowa I had to have  <br/>
meeting with the adoption worker handling her case and I explained to him <br/>
look  more  attachment is my issue. he herd me out and agreed and said if you <br/>
fallow the law then no one can touch you, good luck  and  lucky kid and lucky <br/>
mom says you know you may have found the key there are so many with this  they <br/>
usually end up in institutions or worse something tells me Lisa won&#39;t.<br/>
 Not sure why he needed to have this talk with me and I had to do it on phone <br/>
due to being sick. I wonder if someone called trying to report me. I asked why <br/>
the fuss he said just herd was all and had to call.<br/>
Dee<br/>
Thank you for not being annoyed<br/>

&gt; Weeeeellll, an &quot;unschooling&quot; answer &lt;g&gt; would be to distract your<br/>
&gt; children with trips to a theme park or friend&#39;s houses or camping or<br/>
&gt; something they really want to do away from home so that you can get them<br/>
&gt; gone long enough that a few tomatoes survive!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or, you can send up a little prayer to the universe that the plants<br/>
&gt; start to bear more heavily later in the season.  Could happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or, if you are a straight-forward person and not twistedly devious like<br/>
&gt; me, you could say &quot;Kids, I&#39;d like to make salsa.  To make a small batch<br/>
&gt; I need 30(?) tomatoes.  Would you help me collect them?&quot;<br/>
