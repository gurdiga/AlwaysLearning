<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131878692">There&#39;s a saying I can&#39;t find to quote or credit that&#39;s something  <br/>
like &quot;using one source is plagiarism; using two is research.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With things like unschooling, I always assume that people are using  <br/>
three or ten sources, but then I&#39;m reminded of times when someone  <br/>
seems to have glommed on to one source and ignored all others.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not the best.  I&#39;m thinking of someone years and YEARS ago on  <br/>
*Prodigy who was bemoaning her kids not staying together on their  <br/>
lessons (she wasn&#39;t an unschooler; most weren&#39;t there, then).  The  <br/>
girl would happily have done several language arts lessons in one  <br/>
day, while the boy could hardly finish one.  The mom had to force the  <br/>
girl to stop, and force the boy to go.<br/>
<br/>
To my very sensible (&quot;sensible&quot; in the range of &quot;DUH!&quot; I thought)  <br/>
suggestion that she let the girl do as much as she wanted, and help  <br/>
the boy with his, or let him do something else entirely, she said  <br/>
that I could not possibly BEGIN to understand the situation, as I was  <br/>
not the mother of twins.<br/>
<br/>
Rejecting other people&#39;s ideas because they&#39;re not the mothers of  <br/>
whatever particular &quot;problem&quot; a parent has labelled is legal in all  <br/>
English-speaking countries as far as I&#39;m aware, but just because  <br/>
something&#39;s legal doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the best plan.   Had that mom  <br/>
joined a list of homeschooling parents of twins, she might or might  <br/>
not have gotten better information, but past the early childhood  <br/>
shared language likelihood and the lifelong comparisons and  <br/>
irritations, learning works the same way with a twin as with any  <br/>
other person.  A twins group could have given her some good ideas,  <br/>
but couldn&#39;t have provided everything in the whole wide world she  <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, she kinda glommed onto me, and I&#39;m reminded of this  <br/>
because I pulled out two fat file folders of things she sent me-- <br/>
photos and long letters and copies of handouts she had made for  <br/>
crafts and painting classes she taught.  It&#39;s some very cool stuff,  <br/>
but because I made suggestions she really liked, she thought *I*  <br/>
should be the source of all her input.  That went on for a few years,  <br/>
with me making lots of suggestions for other sources and resources,  <br/>
and her writing and saying how clever I was to have suggested that  <br/>
(rather than going to those other places for other ideas).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind people recommending other lists in addition to this  <br/>
one.  I think everyone should have several sources of information.  I  <br/>
assume that all-to-most of the people on this list are also on  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion (and if you&#39;re not, you might look into it!).   <br/>
Sometimes I throw the link out to other lists ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandadodd.com/">http://sandadodd.com/</a> <br/>
lists/other ) not because I want to suggest people should leave this  <br/>
list, or that one, but because if they&#39;re hungry for more input  <br/>
quickly, more than one list is a way to get more ideas, other voices  <br/>
and more points of view.<br/>
<br/>
Is it because of our culture&#39;s experience with religion that some  <br/>
people tend toward choosing one list and dropping all others? Is it  <br/>
like changing churches or something?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes , it seems, some want to just have one source and otherwise  <br/>
they feel disloyal or in danger of terminal confusion.  Like their  <br/>
soul won&#39;t be saved, or they&#39;ll have sinned by going to a  <br/>
Presbyterian service if they&#39;re Pentecostal.  But if you want to  <br/>
learn about Christianity,  you have to go to LOTS of kinds of  <br/>
churches.  And if you want to know about religion other than  <br/>
Christianity, you have to explore, and read, and meet people and  <br/>
watch movies and...<br/>
<br/>
If people want to know about unschooling, they need to know something  <br/>
about structured homeschooling and unit studies, so they know what  <br/>
they could do and why they&#39;ve chosen not to.  it will help  to know  <br/>
enough about homeschooling in general to carry on a conversation with  <br/>
people who aren&#39;t even homeschoolers who know a little or a lot about  <br/>
it.  It helps to know enough about unschooling&#39;s range and history to  <br/>
be able to understand and defend what you&#39;re doing.  That&#39;s unlikely  <br/>
to come from one list or one website or one book.<br/>
<br/>
Mix it up, explore, and don&#39;t forget that no one has gathered all of  <br/>
any one sort of person all in one places.  They&#39;re out and about.   <br/>
Some are using labels and some aren&#39;t.  Go with the principles and  <br/>
ideas and underlying truths of learning, and it won&#39;t matter so much  <br/>
anymore about the particulars.  Learn enough about learning that you  <br/>
the mom (or dad) really get it.  Learning isn&#39;t just for kids.  We  <br/>
can feel how WE learn and grow and that helps us understand how other  <br/>
people do.    Yes there are differences in preference and  <br/>
&quot;intelligences&quot; (I mean Gardner-style, not IQ style).  Some MUCH  <br/>
prefer books to conferences, or vice versa.  Some would like to talk  <br/>
for hours, and others would rather sit back and just watch and  <br/>
think.  But still the learning is personal and should not ever be  <br/>
dependent on just one source.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. I just wrote something similar to another list:<br/>
<br/>
***But isn&#39;t this the purpose of having multiple lists, each with its <br/>
own distinct &quot;flavor&quot; and community? Why do the multiple voices need to <br/>
be on the same list, in the same spot? Why isn&#39;t okay if different <br/>
people set up lists with the different purposes and definitions from <br/>
which everyone can freely choose? I think that&#39;s the glory of having <br/>
multiple lists and exactly why I&#39;m a member of different lists.<br/>
<br/>
Why so much angst over how people define their own lists? That&#39;s the <br/>
part I&#39;m not getting. If someone doesn&#39;t like one group&#39;s definition, <br/>
move on to another or create one. That&#39;s true diversity, imo--allowing <br/>
different definitions to exist without needing to blow them apart in <br/>
their own house, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo lists are a weird hybrid between public and private. Kinda like <br/>
churches. Each group gets to define who and what they are though they <br/>
welcome and depend upon (with certain restrictions) public exploration <br/>
and membership.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kinda like running a 4-H group or a community book discussion <br/>
group. People can join and participate, and even have respectful <br/>
disagreement and input on the topics, but that&#39;s not the same thing as <br/>
going in and insisting that people discuss a totally different book or <br/>
that their approach to the activity is all wrong. Participation is a <br/>
kind of tantamount acceptance of the scheduled activity or book, though <br/>
if one didn&#39;t like it, they could leave and start their own group where <br/>
they&#39;d have more control over the choice of activities/ book selections.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m not saying people shouldnt speak their truth...Im saying people <br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; speak their truth...and noone can really control how another does <br/>
&gt; that....not<br/>
&gt; unless they moderate a list...but thats irrelevant here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, this is what I&#39;m not getting at all. Not every group needs to be a <br/>
total free for all cacophony of voices. There comes a point at which, <br/>
imo, that multiplicity/ diversity actually takes away from in depth <br/>
exploration rather than adding to it.<br/>
<br/>
Really, what&#39;s wrong with an on-topic, lightly moderated or even heavily <br/>
moderated list? As long as there&#39;s freedom in list-making, in other <br/>
words not a monopoly on a topic, then the freedom is there and can&#39;t be <br/>
lost. The key is in the free proliferation of lists, as I see it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And  it takes so much time and good energy  to focus on other people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, amen to that. I&#39;ve stuck around here and have been really enjoying <br/>
the thoughtful dialog where energy isn&#39;t wasted trashing other people. I <br/>
just don&#39;t understand the need to define oneself against someone else <br/>
when people can stand alone in such interesting and unique ways with <br/>
really great things to say. ****<br/>

I&#39;m like that too.<br/>

while back and she about had a heart attack.:)<br/>
I started remembering my early days in &#39;00 and&#39;01 (I&#39;m waaaaay after<br/>
the AOL times) when I could just log onto unschooling.com and one or<br/>
two lists and it sounded so nice and simple!!!<br/>

But there are some nice things about more lists, one of those being<br/>
that you can focus on helping newer folks or give die-hard RU&#39;s a safe<br/>

understand to apply unschooling principles when it isn&#39;t as simple/ <br/>

Yes, and some of us have children that could easily carry one of those<br/>

I understand there are some challenges you NEED greater insight for,<br/>

<br/>
There have been times when people have felt that their questions haven&#39;t <br/>
been taken seriously, which was one of the biggest drives for me to <br/>
create the AlwaysUnschooled list.<br/>
<br/>
Although I can totally understand the argument that kids aren&#39;t <br/>
unschooled until they are legally and literally *not doing school* <br/>
whatever age that may be in whatever state/ country, I still take the <br/>
unschooling lifestyle--unschooling as it spills into parenting--very <br/>
seriously and think that if parents do it from the very beginning, so <br/>
much the better, so much less to undo.<br/>
<br/>
I felt that a place where all these parents of young kids could be <br/>
encouraged, get information and engage in self-examination would be a <br/>
really good thing. In much the same way that I think ubasics is a really <br/>
great place for all those initial what ifs and howcoulditpossiblys.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just not sure that an elist lends itself to the broadness your <br/>
talking about. I think message boards can do it, but they&#39;re a very <br/>
different beast to me, and I&#39;m not as fond of them, personally. They&#39;re <br/>
more permanent in many ways, but slower, too. I like the immediacy of <br/>
email.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just me. *shrug*<br/>

Yes, and the only way to &quot;prove&quot; to those who are claiming one has no  <br/>
experience whatsoever is to out your kids and that defeats the  <br/>
purpose of avoiding the differentiations and labels.<br/>
<br/>
It happens in discussions about giftedness.  If one says &quot;you don&#39;t  <br/>
need to do this&quot; the other mom might say &quot;If you&#39;re not the mother of  <br/>
a gifted child, you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;   If you  <br/>
DO know what you&#39;re talking about, how do you prove it?<br/>
<br/>
In a discussion of IQ, if one is saying &quot;IQ needs to be ignored;  <br/>
don&#39;t test them, because you&#39;ll never forget the number,&quot; they might  <br/>
say &quot;well that&#39;s fine for an average/normal person to say, but...&quot;   <br/>
and so at that point, does the first speaker pull out the old IQ score?<br/>
If someone will only listen to a person with a high IQ<br/>
and if someone with a high IQ says IQ doesn&#39;t matter<br/>
and BECAUSE that person showed a score,<br/>
then IQ matters.<br/>
<br/>
If the person who won&#39;t listen to someone who won&#39;t prove their  <br/>
officially-measured IQ &quot;worth,&quot; then she is left assuming she&#39;s  <br/>
correct, and that anyone with a high IQ would flaunt it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know I said I was done, but these two comments hit me...actually hurt.<br/>
I&#39;ve released those feelings for the most part and want to tell you what<br/>
bothered me about these comments.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean Ren with &quot;choosing not to separate them in any<br/>
way&quot;. It SOUNDS like you are saying that adding another list that has lots<br/>
of parents with kids with similar situations is separating the kids in some<br/>
way. Could it be more that there is a union happening? That&#39;s what it feels<br/>
like to me. And since we are having this discussion here on this list...what<br/>
are we separating from?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like MY SON is on the shine list...he knows nothing about the<br/>
differences between the lists I&#39;m on. These are my lists. They help me and I<br/>
hope I&#39;ve helped someone else along the way.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t see Andrew in any negative or limited way. In fact, we see him<br/>
shine more than ever! I am a better parent from being reminded over and over<br/>
again through reading posts that my child is an absolute perfect part of the<br/>
universe and my job is in part to see where he shines and support that 100%.<br/>
Them&#39;s healin&#39; words for a parent who can&#39;t escape that their path with<br/>
their child in unschooling doesn&#39;t look like most of the posts on other<br/>
lists, or even like it does for the three other children in her own home.<br/>
<br/>
And that advice seems like good regular unschooling advice, but it is not<br/>
what I&#39;ve gotten anywhere else. So yes, joining another community is just<br/>
that...a joining...not a separating.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think good advice stands well all on its own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;avoiding the differentiations and labels.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am wondering why would we avoid differentiations when they are right<br/>
there. In our case, we would be avoiding parts of my son. Same for all kids<br/>
I assume. We all ARE different. Having words that describe with accuracy can<br/>
certainly help understand one&#39;s self and others as well. I mean, it&#39;s not as<br/>
if the word &quot;autistic&quot; is a BAD thing, is it?<br/>
<br/>
It seems like there is a great resistant to use the word &quot;autistic&quot; &lt;insert<br/>
any other label&gt;. I&#39;d like to explore that for a sec. The way I see it,<br/>
&quot;autistic&quot; is only a *bad* word if you see it as meaning limiting and<br/>
debilitating and damaged. For two of my family, it has opened limitless<br/>
doors and has meant joy and understanding and appreciation in what otherwise<br/>
was a very confusing existence in this world.<br/>
<br/>
It has helped my husband ENORMOUSLY...more on that in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It *seems* a reason people don&#39;t want to use labels is the thought that the<br/>
label creates a box.<br/>
<br/>
For us, it was just the opposite. Having this descriptive word provided<br/>
explanations that finally opened the box.<br/>
<br/>
My son said a couple of weeks ago to the teacher of a drama class he is<br/>
taking, &quot;Oh. You&#39;re probably wondering why I am so blunt about what I think.<br/>
You see, I am working on making that easier on people around me, but it is<br/>
somewhat hardwired for me. Please don&#39;t be offended. If you ask my opinion,<br/>
I will give you the honest answer, no matter how offensive it seems. You<br/>
might know about it as an autistic thing.&quot; The moment he used the word<br/>
&quot;autistic&quot; the teacher suddenly realized that he wasn&#39;t an asshole, he<br/>
really spoke without the editing that most of us do. She was MUCH more<br/>
understanding after that. The label gave her some information to work with<br/>
without him having to say &quot;I have sensory issues and my brain really hasn&#39;t<br/>
figured out yet what is okay to say to people and what isn&#39;t, no matter how<br/>
much great modeling I&#39;ve had in my home my whole life and I&#39;m walking in and<br/>
out of the room because I can only take the noise and fluorescent lights for<br/>
a few minutes at a time and my bladder gets REAL active in situations like<br/>
this and I know I look like an adult and should have better manners but I<br/>
really am doing the best I can ...&quot; etc. &quot;Autistic tendencies&quot; has been much<br/>
easier for him to say.<br/>
<br/>
He knew that this teacher was a little freaked out by him and because of<br/>
knowing the word &quot;autistic&quot; he already had mechanisms to help him navigate<br/>
through the world of &quot;normal&quot; people (no there is no such thing as<br/>
normal...I know...he knows...just using it in this example, with quotation<br/>
marks). He has googled autism and sought out on his own resources for<br/>
self-help and self-awareness. And is a happy and healthy creature indeed!<br/>
<br/>
He has armed himself with some pretty dang useful tools that I would never<br/>
have thought to give him. It came from having a word to describe some of his<br/>
differences. Avoiding his differences would not help him in any way that I<br/>
can see.<br/>
<br/>
JUDGING his differences is another story. THAT is the area where I see work<br/>
needing to be done. But not avoiding.<br/>
<br/>
And now for my husband&#39;s story, if you are still reading :o)<br/>
<br/>
He was &quot;diagnosed&quot; with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome at age 50. He says this was the<br/>
biggest relief of his life. Because his life, particularly his younger<br/>
years, were spent wondering why he couldn&#39;t do things others could, why he<br/>
didn&#39;t fit in and didn&#39;t even know what &quot;fitting in&quot; meant, why people were<br/>
always getting mad at him, why he could understand so many things that most<br/>
people couldn&#39;t and why other people were so stupid. His parents hadn&#39;t a<br/>
clue as to why he was this way and ignored to their best ability his<br/>
differences. Didn&#39;t try to help him navigate in this world, and in fact,<br/>
joined the bullies and the rigid teachers and the cranky neighbors in just<br/>
thinking he was weird and defective and beating him up in one way or<br/>
another. Not like any of us, I know, and that is a great difference between<br/>
our children and this story. But the core of this story is that Charles KNEW<br/>
he had differences, but no one would address it or help him or give him<br/>
words to understand. Only lack of words that left him hanging. He said that<br/>
if he was given this label when he was 12, he would have had a much easier<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
If we are seeing our children no matter who they are as having no limits in<br/>
what they can do if they want to do it, then using a word to gain<br/>
information I see no harm in. We&#39;re not married to the word. The word isn&#39;t<br/>
defining us. We&#39;re just using it because it is a darned useful tool right<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t mean to make this so long. My apologies.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is statements like this, though, that can put a parent of those <br/>
&quot;a-typical&quot; kids on the defensive.   Maybe it isn&#39;t meant to, and maybe the <br/>
parent is just hyper-sensitive because everyone is telling them what they <br/>
should or should not do for their kids, but when someone says, &quot;My child <br/>
has autism&quot; and someone else comes back with, &quot;We have chosen not to label <br/>
our child&quot;, it can sound like a put-down, or maybe a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Recognizing that my kids have challenges and behaviors that are unique to <br/>
their particular a-typical neurological make-ups, and learning all about <br/>
those neurological differences and how others have helped their kids (and <br/>
dismissing some or most of it), and getting insight into other ways I can <br/>
help them that I might not have realized before makes me a better parent <br/>
for my children.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes using that word or label opens up a lot of information that might <br/>
not have be available before.  I could google &quot;temper tantrum&quot; and get a <br/>
set of websites with information, but if I google &quot;tantrum+autism&quot; I get a <br/>
whole other set of results.<br/>
<br/>
The labels aren&#39;t things that I use to separate them from others, or even <br/>
to define them to others in real life.  We don&#39;t go to Park Day and <br/>
announce, &quot;This is Aaron, and he has Aspergers, or possibly High <br/>
Functioning Autism&quot;.  But those words/labels are useful in discussing those <br/>
challenges and behaviors with others when I am looking for input, and in <br/>
knowing how to help my boys in real life situations too.<br/>
<br/>
We knew from an early age that Andrew had some sort of information <br/>
processing problem.  It was just obvious from watching him and having other <br/>
children around that somehow he was not getting the same messages as <br/>
everyone else.   But it wasn&#39;t until I had really researched it and had my <br/>
suspicions confirmed and then was surprised at the severity of it when the <br/>
test results were shown to me, that I really understood what the world was <br/>
like for him, and could begin to figure out ways to help.  Knowing that <br/>
Andrew has CAPD (central auditory processing disorder) meant that I then <br/>
had a reference point for finding out how to help him navigate those <br/>
challenging situations.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew&#39;s name isn&#39;t spelled CAPD, and it isn&#39;t a definition of Who He Is, <br/>
but it is a definition of some of the challenges he has that others <br/>
don&#39;t.  Aaron isn&#39;t autistic; Aaron has autism, and it does affect how he <br/>
interacts with others and how he behaves and thinks.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent has a child who is still having incredibly challenging moments <br/>
even with all the mindful parenting and unschooling environment and such, <br/>
and the parent has had to spend hours and hours researching to get that <br/>
greater insight in order to help that child, and that research has led them <br/>
to the door of a developmental pediatrician or neurologist or an auditory <br/>
specialist or a pharmacy or a therapist or whatever, does that mean <br/>
they  less accepting of their child as a whole being than a parent who has <br/>
chosen not to go that route?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure you understand the risks of labeling, too, of course. The  <br/>
worst case is that people have preconceived notions of what  <br/>
&quot;autistic&quot; means and they can relate to a person based on that,  <br/>
rather than based on the reality of the individual. Well - the worst  <br/>
is when people who have some authority over the child do this.  <br/>
Another danger is when a child believes that their diagnosis makes  <br/>
them incompetent - I&#39;ve seen that with kids I&#39;ve known.  And, this  <br/>
may not apply to autism as a label, but there are also self- <br/>
fulfilling prophecies because of labels -- we all know the studies in  <br/>
which teachers are told they are being give a class of gifted kids  <br/>
(even though the class is, in fact, a random sample of kids) and, lo  <br/>
and behold, the kids excel beyond the typical class. Other teachers  <br/>
are told they are being given a class of special needs kids and, no  <br/>
big surprise, the teacher sees the kids as having all kinds of  <br/>
problems and the kids don&#39;t achieve up to average levels.<br/>
<br/>
I SO understand the relief that you described your husband having - I  <br/>
know that even when we have symptoms of physical problems, sometimes  <br/>
it can be such a relief just to give it a name and know that there  <br/>
are others who share the symptoms, etc. I&#39;ve had RLS (Restless Leg  <br/>
Syndrome) for most of my life - but didn&#39;t know it had a name and  <br/>
that other people had it too, until fairly recently (because it got  <br/>
bad enough that my need for medical help became very apparent). It  <br/>
was certainly a relief to know it wasn&#39;t just me, that it was a real  <br/>
syndrome and not &quot;all in my head.&quot; So - with autistic characteristics  <br/>
I can imagine that the relief would be even greater.<br/>
<br/>
There are times that labels are useful, for sure. Just like John Holt  <br/>
decided not to give out information about his own college degrees,  <br/>
wanting his ideas to stand on their own, I decided many years ago to  <br/>
try not to utilize commonly assigned labels in describing my children  <br/>
- but instead to actually describe the individual child&#39;s specific  <br/>
characteristics and let those stand on their own. I didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
call my child ADD or ADHD or &quot;gifted&quot; or &quot;spirited&quot; or whatever the  <br/>
current trendy label was - and my reason was that I think those  <br/>
labels mistakenly indicate that we know something about the child -  <br/>
but we don&#39;t know ANYTHING much from those labels, in fact. And I so  <br/>
often saw the risks become reality - kids lived up to their labels.  <br/>
So - there are TIMES for labels - when needing a diagnosis in order  <br/>
to get treatment is an obvious time. And if my kids were in school,  <br/>
I&#39;d be getting them labeled in order to get certain services, too.  <br/>
And, yes, to find support might be one of those times - I&#39;m on an RLS  <br/>
email list, for example.<br/>

But that statement was made by a parent of children who do have  <br/>

If you think you can easily or clearly separate and label, then for  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think they&#39;re unique.  I think they&#39;re shared with very many  <br/>
people, in one degree or another.  There is a continuum, a spectrum,  <br/>
and there are not little dividing walls between degrees or &quot;make-ups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

those neurological differences and how others have helped their kids  <br/>
(and<br/>
dismissing some or most of it), and getting insight into other ways I  <br/>
can<br/>
help them that I might not have realized before makes me a better parent<br/>
for my children.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then that&#39;s great.<br/>
There are other ways to realize that because every child has  <br/>
different combinations, talents, intelligences, limitations,  <br/>
oddities, biochemical sets, etc. that flexibility and personal  <br/>
attention are important.  Some families can and do deal with those  <br/>
things without labelling the children or joining groups dedicated to  <br/>
seeing them as different.  That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>

Is it a disease?  If it&#39;s a condition, then &quot;autistic&quot; is a better  <br/>
way to state it.  It&#39;s not a disease he caught and might recover  <br/>
from, is it?  If someone is blind, he doesn&#39;t &quot;have blindness.&quot;  It&#39;s  <br/>
not an insult to say someone is autistic.  It&#39;s a way to indicate  <br/>
that those conditions are part of &quot;Who He Is.&quot;  Not all of who he is,  <br/>
but a part of the package.<br/>
<br/>

moments<br/>

such,<br/>

greater insight in order to help that child, and that research has  <br/>
led them<br/>
to the door of a developmental pediatrician or neurologist or an  <br/>
auditory<br/>
specialist or a pharmacy or a therapist or whatever, does that mean<br/>
they  less accepting of their child as a whole being than a parent  <br/>
who has<br/>
chosen not to go that route?-=-<br/>
<br/>
That question can&#39;t be answered for all the parents in the world.    <br/>
Parents are as different as children are.  The dyad relationships are  <br/>
different even within families.  It&#39;s too complex a question.  And it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t need to be answered on this list, either.  People should be  <br/>
on as many or as few lists as they want to be on.  No list can or  <br/>
should try to be everything to anyone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just for clarification, in case when you say &quot;or joining groups dedicated to<br/>
seeing them as different&quot; you are talking about the shine list, that does<br/>
not describe that place at all.<br/>
<br/>
That list sparks the thought &quot;my kid is perfect and cool and SO worthy of<br/>
admiration&quot; to people who often tended to focus on what was wrong instead of<br/>
what was right. In fact the &quot;dedication&quot; of that group is seeing and<br/>
nurturing the shine of our children, no matter who they are. Which is about<br/>
the opposite of a dedication to seeing them as different.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any other group joinings talked about in this thread, which<br/>
is what makes me think you may be talking about that list. I sure could be<br/>
wrong though!<br/>

severity.  I agree that autism is a spectrum disorder as far as severity, <br/>
but everyone isn&#39;t on that spectrum.<br/>

<br/>
Pam stated an opinion.  Ren stated an opinion.  Others stated  <br/>
opinions.  Their opinions were facts, in that Ren stated that she  <br/>
felt and believed and did (whatever), and Pam stated the fact that  <br/>
she thinks it&#39;s really good for this list.  It&#39;s a fact that those  <br/>
were their opinions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So what if their totally legitimate statements seem to be  <br/>
contradictory?  It doesn&#39;t matter.  We can&#39;t and don&#39;t need to try to  <br/>
come to a consensus.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a vote-off between people  <br/>
who agree with what Ren said and what Pam said (and knowing them both  <br/>
as well as I do, I didn&#39;t see it as contradictory anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t require labelling and sorting kids.  The  <br/>
principles of learning and of unschooling work the same with  <br/>
&#39;profoundly gifted&#39; and with people slower to learn; it works the  <br/>
same way with people who have high verbal intelligence and low; it  <br/>
works the same way with people who have high mathematical  <br/>
intelligence and low or anywhere in between.  It works the same way  <br/>
with people with high kinesthetic intelligence, low, or in between.   <br/>
Same with musical, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, nature  <br/>
intelligence...<br/>
<br/>
The moment to moment activities of a child or parent will be  <br/>
different depending on his or her own interests and abilities and  <br/>
opportunities, but the principles are the same.<br/>
<br/>
This list, unschooling.info, my site, Joyce&#39;s site, every other site  <br/>
anywhere relating to parenting or homeshooling or unschooling is  <br/>
presenting information, ideas, and experiences.   It&#39;s the  <br/>
responsibility of each parent to take what she likes and to leave the  <br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>
This list is what it is.  If I get really tired of it being what it  <br/>
is, or it becomes something I can no longer support, I&#39;ll go to  <br/>
yahoogroups and delete it.  It&#39;s like a party, and someday for some  <br/>
reason the party will be over.  Until that time, it seems a waste of  <br/>
time to complain about the party when there are so many others so  <br/>
nearby.  Party hopping is fine.  Complaining that one party should be  <br/>
more like another party is a kind of negativity that harms the  <br/>
complainant and the party both.<br/>

explosive behaviors, and so on - by seeming to be sending them away  <br/>
to the shining list. I just wish people who do that would be a lot  <br/>
more careful, go out of their way, to phrase their offering of other  <br/>
lists to be clear that they are still very much welcome to continue  <br/>
on the regular lists, too.  It is not an objection to the existence  <br/>
of the list or to giving people information about it - it is that I  <br/>
really want to be clear that people are not wrong to be having those  <br/>
discussions on the regular lists. Sometimes the people being given  <br/>
that advice - go to the shining list - say &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Then they&#39;re  <br/>
gone. End of our discussion. I just don&#39;t want that to happen so I  <br/>
REMIND people that it is perfectly okay and, in fact, valuable, for  <br/>
those conversations to continue on the general lists.<br/>
<br/>
But truly I am NOT talking about any one list. The same thing happens  <br/>
on my state list because people went off and started a special list  <br/>
for homeschooling gifted kids. As soon as someone says they have a  <br/>
kid who is unusually advanced in something or other, someone refers  <br/>
them to the gifted list and they go there and the conversation dies  <br/>
out on the main list.<br/>
<br/>
I do like message boards because there can be folders for specific  <br/>
topics, but we&#39;re all there together, too, and tend to interact with  <br/>
a greater diversity of subject matter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049247191">&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean Ren with &quot;choosing not to separate them in<br/>
any way&quot;. It SOUNDS like you are saying that adding another list that<br/>
has lots of parents with kids with similar situations is separating<br/>
the kids in some way. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Having a list for atypical children IS separating how we DISCUSS them....<br/>
But I think I need to define more clearly.<br/>
I was actually trying to give leeway, for those parents of more<br/>
difficult challenges and say I can understand a need for a diagnoses<br/>
or label when faced with certain issues. I certainly would want to<br/>
understand what was happening in my child&#39;s world with certain<br/>
challenges that would be beyond my understanding.<br/>
<br/>
When I said &quot;some of us&quot; I simply meant that there are a lot of us at<br/>
general lists dealing with some of these issues, and that there is a<br/>
lot of good advice and information shared on these general lists. Just<br/>
because someone isn&#39;t at a special list (which are also extremely<br/>
valuable) doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a wealth of information at a<br/>
general list.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. I wasn&#39;t trying to sound like labels are never helpfuly<br/>
(for understanding) and anyone that has read my posts in the past<br/>
knows this.  I could have worded the above better...my ONLY point was<br/>
that there are many, many parents dealing with issues but might not be<br/>
on a special, more distinct list.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I&#39;m on the shine list!!:) I don&#39;t post there very often and only<br/>
read occasionally because I find the volume overwhelming...but I am<br/>
not knocking the value of ANY list. They&#39;re obviously useful, or<br/>
people wouldn&#39;t join.:) And I&#39;m not knocking the value of a diagnosis<br/>
for some parents, or even a label when they need help understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only saying that there are parent&#39;s of atypical kids all over the<br/>
place.....many of them never having a label for what they&#39;re dealing<br/>
with, but still a great source of unschooling/atypical child information.</div>
