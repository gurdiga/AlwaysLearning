<div id="ygrps-yiv-763801336">As I&#39;ve mentioned in past posts, I have two sons, one 5, the other 7. My<br/>
wife and I have been unschooling-lite since they were born. By that I mean<br/>
we&#39;ve taken the approach of strewing and self direction, but haven&#39;t given<br/>
them total autonomy, and we have put lots of restrictions on their<br/>
environment (limits on video game time, no cable access, specific foods).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For the last month or so,  I&#39;ve been embracing a more RU approach, and<br/>
arguing for it in our house. My wife has expressed concerns, but has been<br/>
willing to give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Recently, after arranging for a second computer to minimize conflict,<br/>
they&#39;ve gotten into some pretty serious all day Age of Mythology marathons.<br/>
It&#39;s pushing dw&#39;s limits. They come down in the morning, begin playing, and<br/>
it&#39;s hard even to interest them in meals. In addition to making it difficult<br/>
for her to get out of the house, the kids are usually screechy, hyperactive,<br/>
and tweaky towards each other when they get off the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think the evidence on developmental problems in young children is<br/>
inconclusive and could easily be outweighed by the benefits, but I share her<br/>
concerns about the physical effects of this over the long run - ds5 has<br/>
recently complained about his legs and his wrist hurting.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I suspect deschooling, but my conviction isn&#39;t deep. We have tried waving<br/>
lots of alternative interests under their noses - no luck with ds5, who is<br/>
the more obsessed of the two. I also suspect that the computer provides a<br/>
safe haven for him against the age superiority of his older brother.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing with their young (5ish) kids?<br/>
And if so, how has it played out?<br/>

I haven&#39;t, because by the time they were five they had been free to  <br/>
make choices for... five years.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen in lots of others, though, the effects of limits and  <br/>
deprivation, and how desperately they cling to opportunity when  <br/>
they&#39;re afraid it will be short-lived.<br/>

Parent attitudes are SO important in unschooling. It&#39;s not just a matter of<br/>
&quot;tolerating&quot; a child&#39;s chosen activity (with gritted teeth no less)...it&#39;s a<br/>
matter of embracing it, being peaceful with it, engaging in it, loving them<br/>
in it.<br/>

hyperactivity [which may be more aptly described as &quot;need to be<br/>
moving&quot;...&#39;hyperactivity&#39; has a negative connotation to it])...rub their<br/>
aching body parts, give them a drink of water, run around with them if they<br/>
are needing/wanting to move...help them feel good. They really will choose<br/>
to feel good most if not all of the time if they know they are free to make<br/>
choices. But if they aren&#39;t, then getting what they really want for whatever<br/>
amount of time they can will win out over feeling balanced and relaxed every<br/>
time.<br/>

are no other options for them (always be thinking of better and more options<br/>
when the kids are unhappy with the only option given), then empathize with<br/>
them, stay loving as they emote, tell them &quot;I know, this is hard. We&#39;ll just<br/>
be gone for 1 hour, then you can get right back to it.&quot; Try NOT to feel<br/>
resentful that now that you&#39;ve allowed this freedom to your children<br/>
(especially if they know it is tenuous) you are having to &quot;deal&quot; with<br/>
behaviors.<br/>

<br/>
***I believe this is SO true. For example: I am not a fan of TV at all, it&#39;s <br/>
boring for me and I didn&#39;t want our kids *wasting * their time with it too <br/>
much. We were looking into the Waldorf School when they were really young. (they <br/>
are 21, 12 1/2 and 11 now) We limited their TV time a lot. My sil&#39;s kids were <br/>
in the Waldorf Schools for years and we began noticing that every time we saw <br/>
their kids, on holidays or in the summer when we would all meet for vacation <br/>
at my mil&#39;s summer home, all they wanted to do is watch TV. If the parents <br/>
weren&#39;t around the kids went for it every chance they got and if the parents were <br/>
there it was always an issue for their whole family. Although we still had <br/>
some limits for the kids at that time, we slacked off a lot and the Waldorf idea <br/>
went out the window! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling and slowly incorporating RU into our lives for <br/>
almost 2 yrs. now. Our kids do watch TV, but at this point in their lives they <br/>
could really care less about it. It&#39;s just not a big deal to them any longer. <br/>
There are some days the TV is never even on, but that&#39;s their choice, not ours. <br/>
It&#39;s the same with the computer. It is on way more than the TV, but they know <br/>
when they are tired/bored of it or their butts are getting sore from just <br/>
sitting and they will go find other things to do all on their own. We don&#39;t need to <br/>
tell them, they just do it on their own now. We&#39;ve noticed a big difference in <br/>
their attitudes also. They seem much more happier, relaxed and confident in <br/>
themselves. I think they are more conscientious of their choices because *they <br/>
know* *they are* capable beings. *They know* because they are free to find <br/>
out! :o)<br/>

Many people admire those who do certain things until it hurts.  No pain, no gain.  When the going gets tough, the tough get going.  And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie (10yo) bought a new toy Monday, called Bull&#39;s Eye Ball.  It is an electronic toy that somewhat resembles skee ball.  She has played for hours and complained several times that her arm hurts and feels shaky.  I suggested that she sometimes switch to her left hand.  She said she couldn&#39;t, but later decided to give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
Using this toy has led to discussions of angles and force and setting personal goals, so far.  And fun!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Marty&#39;s in the next room playing Guitar Hero (a Playstation game with  <br/>
a &quot;guitar&quot; as a controller—an electronic game control guitar-shaped  <br/>
thing with a guitar strap &lt;g&gt;).  I&#39;ve played that until my wrist  <br/>
ACHED.  I just don&#39;t notice until it&#39;s too late. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the repetitive motion syndrome studies should be shared with our  <br/>
kids some.  If I&#39;m typing and I leave my hand in position while I&#39;m  <br/>
reading or thinking, that&#39;s not as good as if I  pick them up and wag  <br/>
them around, stretch my wrists, stretch my arms, maybe stand up and  <br/>
move while I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
<br/>
My solution at home has been to rejoice in my scatteredness.  I think  <br/>
&quot;Oh!  I should make tea,&quot; and while the water&#39;s heating up, I go and  <br/>
turn the water on in the yard to water flowers or something and I see  <br/>
that there&#39;s a piece of trash to pick up, and then the tea water&#39;s  <br/>
ready, and...<br/>
<br/>
So when I&#39;m feeling stuck (muscle-stuck, or getting emotionally too  <br/>
keyed up, I try to get up and stretch and breathe, and if it can  <br/>
involve something useful (feeding the cat, starting another load of  <br/>
laundry, playing with the dog for a bit), all the better for  <br/>
everything and everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Kids might not want to get up, but if parents can come and remind  <br/>
them (at a good moment, not interrupting the game) to stretch their  <br/>
arms, that would be kind and generous.  If a parent waits until a kid  <br/>
says &quot;Ow&quot; and says &quot;serves you right&quot; or &quot;See?  TOLD you games were  <br/>
bad for you,&quot; that is not kind.  It is not generous.  It&#39;s  <br/>
adversarial, mean, and will take a gouge right out of the  <br/>
relationship with the child.<br/>

From: &quot;Ken Cooper&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ken@...">ken@...</a>&gt;<br/>
Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing with their young (5ish) kids?<br/>
And if so, how has it played out?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here is my experience.  I let up on the video game restrictions a month or<br/>
so ago.  Before that we were &quot;limitations lite&quot; as you say.<br/>
My teens probably play less now than they did when we had fixed limits.   My<br/>
10yo plays a bit more than he did when we had limits, but I like the way he <br/>
plays<br/>
now better.   Now he can feel boredom and stop by choice<br/>
and go on to something else.<br/>
<br/>
As for the younger set:  my 6yo never really had many video game or TV<br/>
restrictions.   This is because he is medically fragile and often in the<br/>
hospital where videos and TV are a key resource.   He also is not<br/>
that INTERESTED in spending a lot of time doing these things.  He will play<br/>
a game for a few minutes and then go on to something else.  Right now<br/>
he is recovering from having his feeding tube removed and we&#39;re trying to<br/>
encourage him to watch TV so he&#39;ll keep quiet and not stress his wound, but<br/>
he&#39;d rather be outside or playing ;-).<br/>
<br/>
 My 3yo is the one who is spending the most time on computer games right <br/>
now.    I remember my other kids going through the same stage when they were <br/>
his age.  They<br/>
suddenly realized how newly capable they were.    I&#39;m amazed at all the <br/>
things he&#39;s figured out how to do with the computer.  He can do things that <br/>
I can&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
I guess this feels a bit threatening to me in some ways because I can hear<br/>
Jane Healy&#39;s voice in my head telling me about his endangered mind and<br/>
failure to connect.  But this is not really what I SEE when I look at what<br/>
he&#39;s actually doing.   He&#39;s going through a developmental surge and the<br/>
computer is helping him.   He&#39;s becoming capable of doing things he couldn&#39;t<br/>
do a few short months ago, things that consolidate his membership in the<br/>
family.<br/>
So maybe the game is a haven for your 5yo but maybe it&#39;s also a challenge he<br/>
can meet and feel good about?<br/>
<br/>
My 3.5yo does seem to have a lot of wiggliness after he&#39;s played for a while<br/>
so Jacki&#39;s description of the &quot;need to move&quot; is helpful for me.   He will<br/>
charge at me and want to wrestle, without much warning.  So knowing this, I <br/>
can be ready to do some active interpersonal play after he gets off the <br/>
computer rather than being surprised and irritated by his sudden energy.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that if your 5yo is playing on the computer for a<br/>
long time and then showing energy and some irritation afterwards, he might<br/>
need a transition time.   My 6yo sometimes needs help and support in <br/>
transitioning from high focus activities to the broader stimulation of the <br/>
regular environment.   Some of the things on this page <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Spirited.html">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Spirited.html</a> are some of the same <br/>
things that have helped me with my high-intensity kids.   Especially the <br/>
calming/organizing activities suggested by treegoddess if you scroll<br/>
down a bit.<br/>

she had never yet once met a homeschooled teen.  Unschooled teens  <br/>
picked her up at the airport and she was impressed by them.<br/>
<br/>
When research is based on what contributes to school success, that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t really apply to unschoolers.<br/>
And when researchers haven&#39;t seen any &quot;natural&quot; behavior, in kids for  <br/>
whom school isn&#39;t a factor, and whose lives aren&#39;t being managed for  <br/>
them in light of school&#39;s schedules and expectations, then the  <br/>
research starts from a very flawed place, and our use of their  <br/>
&quot;proofs&quot; will be invalid.<br/>
