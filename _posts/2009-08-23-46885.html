<div id="ygrps-yiv-136500123">Two of my children, a boy, aged 12, and a girl,<br/>
aged 10, have enjoyed a very close relationship<br/>
for as long as they both can remember.  Lately,<br/>
though, they are finding that their interests<br/>
are diverging.  This is distressing for both of<br/>
them, but for my daughter especially.<br/>
<br/>
They had a relationship that was so close, they<br/>
almost seem telepathic.  Now, as they move into<br/>
puberty, they are having a really difficult time<br/>
finding mutually enjoyable things to do, which<br/>
means they aren&#39;t &quot;hanging out&quot; as much as they used<br/>
to, and they miss each other.  I should explicitly <br/>
state that this is a problem that they brought to<br/>
me, as something that is troubling them, rather than<br/>
a situation that I am looking at and seeing as a problem.<br/>
<br/>
They came to me, and asked me to mediate for them,<br/>
as they were feeling quite distressed.  We all talked,<br/>
and listened, to one another for quite awhile, and came<br/>
to the conclusion that it would be nice if they could find<br/>
activities that they could do individually but side by side.<br/>
So, my son could work a jigsaw puzzle and my daughter could<br/>
draw, and they could talk as they each did their own thing.<br/>
They feel it&#39;s not as nice as doing one thing together, but<br/>
better than not spending time together at all.<br/>
<br/>
But now, they can&#39;t think of &quot;enough&quot; (their words/their feelings) things that they can do individually but in tandem.  And so they feel that they still won&#39;t be spending as much time together as they would<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested that they might want to try making some new <br/>
friends, and also suggested that they might try taking <br/>
turns doing activities that one or the other liked, with<br/>
the explicit understanding that then they would switch off.<br/>
For example, she might shoot baskets with him, in return for<br/>
him taking some time to draw pictures with her.  Both suggestions<br/>
were rejected:  they reiterated to me that they want to repair<br/>
*this* relationship, not build others, and as to the second <br/>
suggestion, they said they&#39;d already thought of and tried it, and<br/>
that it didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, we came to the realization that relationships have<br/>
ebbs and flows, and that they might just have to weather this<br/>
period, with the realization that they love one another, even<br/>
though they don&#39;t necessarily enjoy one another&#39;s company as <br/>
much as they used to.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could do more to help them right now, and feel that<br/>
I am probably missing something obvious here.  I trust that<br/>
the wise people on this list will have some helpful suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve seen this happen in various combinations with my kids.  For most  <br/>
of her life, Holly loved Marty and was irritated and suspicious of  <br/>
Kirby.  Marty was her defender and translator when she was a baby.  He  <br/>
always knew what she was saying when the rest of us couldn&#39;t  <br/>
understand her; it was as though he read her mind.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty and Kirby were pre-pubescent, they played together really  <br/>
well, and could share other friends well, too.  When Kirby hit the  <br/>
change, he started excluding Marty and Marty was very sad.  But one  <br/>
day a couple or three years later I said, &quot;Thanks, Kirby, for  <br/>
including Marty.&quot;   He said &quot;Marty&#39;s cool!&quot;  Just almost all of a  <br/>
sudden, Marty was old enough that he was once again more cool than  <br/>
irritating.<br/>
<br/>
For a while Holly liked Kirby better than Marty, but that&#39;s about the  <br/>
time Kirby moved out and she was sad.<br/>
<br/>
Just earlier this week, Holly spent three days at Kirby&#39;s house in  <br/>
Texas, and had a great time.  She&#39;s said several really sweet things  <br/>
about how charming he is to people and how considerate to her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of saying &quot;you don&#39;t enjoy each other as much as you  <br/>
used to&quot; you could say &quot;It&#39;s rough now, but when you&#39;re older you&#39;ll  <br/>
enjoy each other as much as you used to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has been true here.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Marty are getting along well now, too, by the way, though  <br/>
there have been two times in the past three or four years that they  <br/>
were both complaining to me that the other was being irritating and  <br/>
mean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089667461">In our house ds 14 and dd 12 have definitely become much closer since we<br/>
added a second computer specifically<br/>
<br/>
for them to use since last summer.   They sit at one longish table and do<br/>
their individual computer interests<br/>
<br/>
right next to one another.  At first this was tough, they weren&#39;t used to<br/>
being so close so much of the time <br/>
<br/>
and would argue more than before (I realize this isn&#39;t the problem for your<br/>
dc).  No one really seemed to want to <br/>
<br/>
move though no matter how many different ideas we came up with.  Sometimes<br/>
they do the same things online but <br/>
<br/>
lately most of the time not.  They are each enjoying different things while<br/>
still being physically close and so sharing <br/>
<br/>
in the moment that something that really interests them.  They still may not<br/>
choose to go to the same places online<br/>
<br/>
but they know quite a bit about what the other person is interested in and<br/>
can talk about it with them.  <br/>
