<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929255678">Thank-you, that sounds about right.You know there is a feel to right.I <br/>
guess that is why for so many years I could feel my approach was <br/>
off.Funnily enough I never heard of attachment parenting until about a <br/>
month ago,yet all my children were part of the family bed.My two <br/>
youngest still sleep in our room and will until,like the oldest, ask <br/>
for their own room.I breastfed each child, although not nearly as long <br/>
as I should have.I have part of it right,but I see how alot of the <br/>
choices I made were from selfishness or laziness.It&#39;s easy to pay lip <br/>
service to something but actually doing it encompasses a whole new set <br/>
of rules or in this case no rules.This philosophy of unschooling feels <br/>
right,letting go of the NO mode,encouraging  natural development <br/>
within the child.Actually taking the cues from the child this is <br/>
right.There is great appreciation on my part for all the advice given <br/>
in this group,you can only glean so much from books which can be quite <br/>
static.Having real people respond honestly to questions that might <br/>
otherwise go unanswered is priceless.Bridget</div>
