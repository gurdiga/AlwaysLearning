I did a long research project on the Donner party in middle school, <br/>
the only thing I remember from my two years there. It was one of <br/>
those serendipitous things, where an interest of mine actually <br/>
collided with the school agenda. Fascinating story, and so many times <br/>
where a seemingly simple choice drastically changed the outcome.<br/>
