<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757557750">Hi,<br/>
  I haven&#39;t read this, but I want to after reading everything. I learned as<br/>
a child that Greek gods turned to Roman gods, and Roman gods turned to<br/>
Catholic Saints which seemed to make sense to me. Is that an Archie Bunker<br/>
sort of mentality?<br/>
So Athena evolved into Mary, and if you are British, Mary evolved into the<br/>
virgin queen, Elizabeth, not sure where that puts us now.<br/>
