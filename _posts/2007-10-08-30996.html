<div id="ygrps-yiv-777958631">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted here before, so here goes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping someone can help me with the following situation.  I am trying to<br/>
figure out how to explain what we are doing to my friend, A, who has<br/>
&quot;concerns&quot; about my 10 year old daughter, Karen.  I&#39;ve known A since she was<br/>
8 months pregnant with C.  We attended the same LLL group and became LLL<br/>
Leaders together.  Karen considers C to be her best friend from birth.  Her<br/>
daughter has been in school all along, first Montessori preschool (where her<br/>
mom worried that she wasn&#39;t reading like some of the other 4-year-olds),<br/>
then on to all-day kindergarten at a private school.  Karen has been<br/>
homeschooled the whole time, with attempts at a version of school-at-home<br/>
with K and 1st grade, transitioning into unschooling by the time she was 7<br/>
and I gave birth to my 3rd daughter.  We attend the same small neighborhood<br/>
church where A is one of the Sunday school teachers.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was picking up my daughter from a slumber party with C.  My<br/>
friend, A, hosted 3 kids, plus her own, and took them to church in the<br/>
morning.  We chatted as I gathered up Karen&#39;s things and A says she has a<br/>
question about homeschooling.  We had a short conversation that went like<br/>
this:  <br/>
<br/>
A: &quot;Do you ever have Karen evaluated?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Me: You mean do I test her?  <br/>
<br/>
A: Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
Me: No, I don&#39;t test her.<br/>
<br/>
A:  Oh, because I have some concerns<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The conversation stopped there because the kids were in and out of the room.<br/>
The other mom was also there picking up her kids and I did not want to have<br/>
this conversation with the other mom there also. This other mom has asked me<br/>
several times how I know how Karen is doing if I don&#39;t test her.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure I know what the concerns are.  My daughter does not read as<br/>
fast as her daughter and cannot answer &quot;pop quiz&quot; type math questions. I<br/>
recently learned that my friend has &quot;quizzed&quot; Karen at past playdates at<br/>
their house.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago in Sunday school, when A was the teacher, Karen was asked to<br/>
read part of a peace prayer out loud.  (This is a small church, by the way,<br/>
and this particular Sunday, there were only 3 kids in Sunday school.)<br/>
Karen&#39;s friend, C, is saying, oh I&#39;ll read it!  This is fine with Karen, as<br/>
she&#39;d rather not read.  But A (C&#39;s mom) says, no let&#39;s give Karen a turn.<br/>
Well, Karen gets stuck on the first word (almighty) and a few more after<br/>
that.  Her friend would supply the word quietly and really fast before Karen<br/>
could figure it out herself.  Karen says that this really bugged and<br/>
embarrassed her, and that she almost had a few of them figured out when C<br/>
said the word for her.  At some point, A quietly said C&#39;s name and she<br/>
stopped supplying the words.  Then it was C&#39;s turn to read, and Karen says<br/>
she reads really fast, &quot;like you mom.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When Karen told me about it, she showed me her copy of the prayer and the<br/>
words she got stuck on.  We went over the whole thing; she likes the prayer.<br/>
She explained that she just had not seen some of the words before and did<br/>
not recognize them.  I asked Karen, &quot;How do you feel about your reading?&quot;  I<br/>
was wondering, since she said she was embarrassed, that maybe she thinks she<br/>
should be reading better.  A couple of years ago, she used to state that<br/>
so-and-so could read better because they went to school.   Her answer, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
fine with it!  I don&#39;t care how long it takes me to read faster.  I just<br/>
want to be able to read in my own time [meaning her own pace] and without<br/>
someone telling me all the words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been avoiding a big conversation with my friend.  When we were newer<br/>
unschoolers, I was still figuring it out myself and did not feel confident<br/>
explaining it to others.  Especially to someone who believes so strongly in<br/>
traditional education.   Now I am more confident in our choices, but still I<br/>
hesitate to get into a debate.  Not that I &quot;have to&quot; debate with her, but I<br/>
feel like the whole things needs to be addressed if we are going to continue<br/>
to support the friendship between the girls.  I&#39;d like for her to understand<br/>
that I am not neglecting my daughter&#39;s education, and to just drop the<br/>
&quot;evaluations&quot;.  I don&#39;t hope to convince her that this is a better way.  My<br/>
husband is worried that she would become so &quot;concerned&quot; that she would<br/>
contact social services or something, thinking she was doing the right<br/>
thing.  I don&#39;t think that is likely, but still, the thought is there.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate any input anyone might have.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t need to have a big conversation with her.<br/>
<br/>
Give her some reading, and tell her that you&#39;ll be glad to discuss it  <br/>
with her after she&#39;s read whatever book(s) or articles you provide her.<br/>
<br/>
If she starts in right then, hold your hand up and say &quot;I&#39;ve read a  <br/>
lot about it, and you haven&#39;t, but I&#39;ll be willing to discuss it  <br/>
after you&#39;ve done this reading and whatever other research you want  <br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
That&#39;s a blog someone else started and I kinda inherited.  It has  <br/>
links to mainstream articles and research that might be of interest.<br/>
<br/>
The second article that&#39;s on there right now has a link (the second  <br/>
one) to a current article and the mom who set that up has put links  <br/>
to all the books and resources.  That whole thing might be too much  <br/>
&quot;required reading,&quot; but a couple or three of the books might not be.<br/>
