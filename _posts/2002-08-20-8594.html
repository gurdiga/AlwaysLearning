&lt;&lt; We are going to the conference! I was under the impression that they <br/>
couldn&#39;t <br/>
 do combat stuff until they were older. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a youth combat program, specifically to train the younger ones. Our <br/>
program here starts at seven years of age.....which really ticked Sierra off <br/>
(she&#39;s five and hankerin for battle!)<br/>
I guess it probably depends on your area and how interested a person is in <br/>
training the younger ones. We have a Baron that really loves the youth combat <br/>
and trains them as though their lives depend on it.  They get tired sometimes <br/>
and he just doesn&#39;t understand. SCA is his whole life though.<br/>
Check into it, you may have youth combat too.<br/>

<br/>
Some rules differ from kingdom to kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
I think the following is correct:<br/>
Society wide rules are fencing is okay at 14 (after authorization, and not in <br/>
certain war scenarios inter-kingdom).<br/>
For heavy weapons, the legal age is 16.  A fourteen year old can be trained <br/>
without getting his trainer in trouble but the training shouldn&#39;t be at <br/>
official events.  At 16, with authorization, one can enter tournaments but <br/>
NOT coronet or crown.  Not because the fighting will be more intense (though <br/>
it will), but because they&#39;re not considered mature enough for the <br/>
responsibility of being royalty.<br/>
<br/>
These rules weren&#39;t always in effect, but I was being a corporate-level <br/>
this&#39;r&#39;that when some of them came about so I remember.<br/>
<br/>
One of my protégés is now earl marshal here, so I can double check with him <br/>
if any of you really want the up to the moment info.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, my husband is deputy earl marshal and I could ask him <br/>
too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I argued for earlier ages, but it was a compromise with some adamant folk <br/>
from Meridies who would have wanted people to wait until they were 18 or 21 <br/>
to do heavy combat.<br/>
<br/>
At the time of those discussions, rapier combat wasn&#39;t really an issue, and <br/>
it&#39;s still not wholly accepted in every kingdom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257090023">I&#39;ve been reading about SCA but was unsure about how to join and <br/>
what would be required of us. I found all the detailsfor local <br/>
contacts but didn&#39;t know if I should just send them an email. It also <br/>
didn&#39;t say if we would be required to wear costumes at the <br/>
meetings (I can&#39;t sew and I can&#39;t afford to buy anything)<br/>
<br/>
Is it fun? Reading the Virginia homepage made me wonder if these <br/>
people don&#39;t take it so seriously that there isn&#39;t any room for fun. I <br/>
was in Sealed Knot in the UK (British civil War re-enactment - <br/>
1600&#39;s) and it was great fun. The main requirements seemed to be <br/>
the ability to have a laugh and drink copious amounts of beer :-)<br/>

All events are participation only.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a good excuse to learn to sew!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it fun? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can be.   Depends what you think is fun AND it depends on what the local <br/>
group is like.  Some are super kid-friendly, others not so much.  Some have <br/>
lots of music, some don&#39;t.  Some have people who drink a lot, some have none. <br/>
 Just a motley assortment of factors color the realities of each local group <br/>
and subgroup.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s expensive for those who can&#39;t sew or make or find most of their own <br/>
stuff, because you are expected to have costumes and feast gear and if you <br/>
camp it needs to try to be more period than not.  We have a brown nylon dome <br/>
tent which comes up from time to time, but also canvas tents for the main <br/>
part of camp.  We have metal folding chairs sometimes, but for big events we <br/>
have wooden benches.  Different people have different degrees of authenticity <br/>
and it&#39;s a constant and gradual improvement for most people, but the base <br/>
requirements do cost a bit of money.  <br/>
<br/>
Membership is $35 and $10 extra for each family member??  (or maybe I&#39;m <br/>
wrong, and I&#39;m too lazy right now to do anything but read my four days worth <br/>
of e-mail, but whatever it is that&#39;s where you get the newsletter that tells <br/>
where what&#39;s happening).<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley, if you were in another part of the country I would try to hook you <br/>
up with locals, but you&#39;re in Virginia.  I have SCA friends in Maryland, but <br/>
here is the reality:  You are in a part of the U.S. where people are *not* as <br/>
friendly and as welcoming as people are in other parts of the country.   And <br/>
you&#39;re in a part where SCA standards are really pretty high.  There are other <br/>
places where I could hook you up with someone who might lend you things and <br/>
help you out, but I&#39;ve tried getting even established SCA members with rank <br/>
and station hooked up with my Maryland contacts and it&#39;s a dud.  Hard to <br/>
explain, and it&#39;s not just the SCA (and not just MY friends &lt;g&gt;), it&#39;s a <br/>
regional phenomenon.<br/>

of my sons have welsh names, Bryn and Rhodri. Wales is packed <br/>
with &#39;em.<br/>
I noticed the celtic fervour here but managed to get myself chucked <br/>
off some neo-pagan lists for pointing out that the Celts never <br/>
reached the British Isles in any number. It was cultural <br/>
transmission, not physical. People from France and Germany have <br/>
more &#39;celtic&#39; genes than your average irishman.<br/>
I didn&#39;t dare go to a Celtic festival that was held in Virginia a few <br/>
weeks ago. My mouth has a habit of springing open all by itself. I <br/>
got nothing against having a bit of fantasy (like decorating houses <br/>
in all that knotwork and wafty music) but I don&#39;t lke it called &#39;truth&#39;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Trevor would LOVE that!  We made our boffers according to local <br/>
regulations....abc pipe/pipe isulations/tape etc..... I hope that&#39;s good <br/>
enough.<br/>
We have a youth combat program here to prepare the young ones for heavy <br/>
combat.<br/>
There are protection requirements but they practice without protection a lot <br/>
too.<br/>
For the events they must have the protective gear. For the younger ones it&#39;s <br/>
mainly the kidney, head and shoulder protection.<br/>
We practice at home without it.  He&#39;d just love to goof around with any other <br/>
SCA members, he&#39;s a die hard.<br/>

As far as monetary requirements.....we live in a really cool area where SCA <br/>
members are very helpful and not too hung up on authenticity. The look of it <br/>
is what matters to them more.<br/>
And I got started with very little investment. I don&#39;t have a tent as of yet <br/>
though, so  we&#39;ll see.<br/>
Most all of our feast gear came from stuff we had around the house or the <br/>
flea market....picked up pewter mugs for 4 and 5 bucks.  Someone gave us wood <br/>
bowls and a couple outfits for Sierra.<br/>
I re-worked some Goodwill stuff, purchased some leather and a grommet thingy <br/>
and we&#39;re pretty well set.<br/>
There&#39;s a lot we can add, but we just do what we can, when we can. And there <br/>
are people in our group that help with sewing. Either lessons or bartering <br/>
for their skills.<br/>
One of the guys is a leather genius. He makes stuff for the exotic dancers <br/>
around town and loves helping out everyone in SCA....doesn&#39;t even charge <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
Anyway, if you find the right group it&#39;s easy to get started and they don&#39;t <br/>
expect you to have everything up front. Most groups also have a chatelling <br/>
box (loaner box) with clothing and feast gear for you to borrow at your first <br/>
event.<br/>
Don&#39;t hold back for fear of not having money/gear, just like with <br/>
unschooling, you have to take the leap for it to work!!!<br/>
If you think you&#39;d enjoy it, go for it.<br/>
I think just about everyone in our group is in it for the revelry, among <br/>
other things.<br/>

<br/>
You want an SCA demo?   &quot;A&S&quot; is the lingo &lt;g&gt; for arts and sciences in the <br/>
SCA.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to try to check into that if you want.  Weekends are sometimes <br/>
bad, and some sites just want nothing to do with such things.  The SCA has <br/>
liability insurance, but the demos need to be publishe din advance.  They <br/>
have barely enough time to do that, though, so it&#39;s a possibility if you want <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s going to happen, though, maybe I should wear a costume and help <br/>
them out, and be sociable as AElflaed.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a time in my life when that would have sounded very cool, but right <br/>
now *I&#39;m* very cool about it, in a COLD kind of way.  But because Ren and <br/>
Shyrley are interested, I might force myself...   <br/>
<br/>
The gaming shop isn&#39;t so interested in doing a demo or having a table (and <br/>
discussing it with some other people, I understand why--just the logistics <br/>
and economics of it), and I guess Daved Korup didn&#39;t get it together, so if <br/>
I&#39;m going to impress anyone with anything cool, maybe an SCA demo would be <br/>
the thing.<br/>
<br/>
PROBLEM IS... it&#39;s a weekend and they might be having an event, in which case <br/>
we can prob&#39;ly forget about it.<br/>
<br/>
But do you want me to check?<br/>

If your husband can&#39;t see the physics in weapons study,  he&#39;s needing to <br/>
spend less time worrying about the kids&#39; learning and look to his own <br/>
application of what he knows!!!<br/>
<br/>
My kids know what 180 degrees is because that constitutes the last of the <br/>
legal swings.  They know 90 degrees because that&#39;s the recommended safe <br/>
range.  No &quot;roundhouse&quot; swings with even soft boffers; too much force.   That <br/>
is math and that is physics.<br/>
<br/>
The longer the blade or haft, the more force (if swung or arced).<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what a google search on physics and medieval weapons would turn up?  <br/>
Maybe you should send your husband to find out.<br/>

relevant. The important thing is too be able to put it in <br/>
mathematical terms. And cos I don&#39;t teach them math unless they <br/>
ask he&#39;s getting all cross.<br/>
Its all very well being able to adjust the trajectory of your arrow but <br/>
unless you can write down a mathematical formula to describe it <br/>
you wont pass any exams.<br/>
Unfortunately he can mathematically describe anything. But them <br/>
he&#39;s a mathematician.<br/>

Now that Heather is 10 he is worried about how far behind she is <br/>
when compared to skool-going peers. How will she pass exams to <br/>
get into university?<br/>
He bblames me for her hating maths cos I am a firm believer that <br/>
most of is a waste of time unless you want to be a scientist, i <br/>
mean, when was the last time you integrated an equation? He <br/>
accuses me of poisoning her mind and damaging her potential. The <br/>
fact that the skool made her hate maths cos she was 6 years <br/>
ahead of her peers so they used to parade her in front of the other <br/>
kids to *encourage* them seems to be irelevant to him.<br/>

a &#39;poor&#39; employee, not a rich employer!  (and yes, I am well aware that <br/>
there are better measures of success than money, but many people aren&#39;t <br/>

&gt; &gt;His retort would be he doesn&#39;t have to pass an exam in it so he<br/>
&gt; &gt;doesn&#39;t need to know. The kids have to pass exams therefore they need<br/>
&gt; &gt;to learn this stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right, but the idea is to try to shock him into laughing or at least<br/>
&gt; stopping and thinking about there maybe being any OTHER reasons for<br/>
&gt; knowing stuff.  After all, why did he go into the sciences?  Did he<br/>
&gt; love the subject, or was it because he was good at the tests and<br/>
&gt; thought he could make a lot of money? ...and what exams do your kids<br/>
&gt; have to pass?  Are you in one of those awful states that says folks<br/>
&gt; need to test their kids?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>English kids take exams called GCSE&#39;s at 16. Usually anything <br/>
from 3 to 10, each in a different subject. You need at least 5 <br/>
passes in order to do A levels. A levels are done between 16 and <br/>
18 - generally in 3 subjects. The academic level is higher than the <br/>
US Freshman year at college.<br/>
You need 2 or 3 A level passes in order to go to university.<br/>
<br/>
His parents are into science. Mother teaches physics at A level <br/>
and Father is a university lecturer and has been for 30 years.<br/>
DH got the best physics degree in the country for his year so he <br/>
tends to be academically inclined. He&#39;s now a mathematician <br/>
researcher.<br/>
It&#39;s very tricky getting into a UK university without A levels.<br/>

double-blind study or experiment to demonstrate effectiveness (or lack <br/>
thereof.)  After all, I&#39;ve got a degree (bada-boom) in Science!  Whoop-de-doo.<br/>

<br/>
...and make him read The Millionaire Mind - or better yet, let him see <br/>
*you* reading it.  Couldn&#39;t hurt, might help and it might give you more <br/>
&#39;success ammo&#39; to lob in his general direction.</div>
