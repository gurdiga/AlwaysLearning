<div id="ygrps-yiv-855378216">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
As I was writing my book, Homeschooling Reflections, I read a book on Getting <br/>
on Talk Radio to help market your product.  Now I have the data base for the <br/>
shows, and have my first booking!  Next Monday at 5pm (central) time I&#39;ll be <br/>
on 91.FM with Dave Glover in St. Louis.  If any of you are in that area, please <br/>
tune in.  I&#39;m not sure if they take callers or not.  <br/>
<br/>
Wish me luck.<br/>
<br/>
