&gt; I know I&#39;m not there yet, but I don&#39;t see that I have much of a choice in <br/>
&gt; the matter.  My kids have decided for me that we are going to be the best <br/>
&gt; unschoolers we can be.  I would rather do something that came with <br/>
&gt; instructions, it suits my personality.  The more control I give to my kids, <br/>
&gt; the more I am amazed how well this unschooling thing works.  In the past <br/>
&gt; month I have removed, TV limits, a set bedtime,  control over ear piercing, <br/>
&gt; control over dessert, required math, and an on-going battle over table <br/>
&gt; manners.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m ready to move on to the next level.  <br/>

wanting control is YOUR stuff, and not &quot;for the good of the children.&quot;  For <br/>
those of us raised being pretty controlled (at the least, in school), it <br/>
seems counter-intuitve to believe that this unschooling stuff could work. <br/>
It&#39;s a real leap of faith (in our children), and it&#39;s SO cool to watch happen.<br/>
