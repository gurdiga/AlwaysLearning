<div id="ygrps-yiv-707160670">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading alot, learning alot, composing wonderous posts in my mind<br/>
while I nurse toddler, non you all ever get to read.<br/>
<br/>
We started public school with my oldest, her request, last week. Boy have our<br/>
days changed. Up for lunch making, pick up from school right during napping.<br/>
Getting to know her teacher. We are adjusting.<br/>
<br/>
My most recent need. To help my little guy, 5.5, to learn to stop flaunting<br/>
his penis at me and his sisters. He gets such a laugh at dropping his shorts,<br/>
or wiggling around the house. We spend a lot of time in and out of the tub and<br/>
pool and I&#39;m not kidding 25-50 times a day he gets laughing with his little<br/>
sis, 2.5, about body parts. She starts showing everyone everything and I am<br/>
not tolerant anymore. Seems I spend my early part of the day redirecting, then<br/>
boy I&#39;m tired of the potty lanquage and the performimg arts, any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
He seems way interested in reproductive organs, all which make him laugh<br/>
hysterically. We have one bathroom, are mellow about nakedness, and he is<br/>
making such a fuss these days. Loves to talk about whose he has seen and how<br/>
he won&#39;t let others see him. Age appropriate, I know, yet like most things<br/>
Riley is intense in his passions.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing. I seem controlling lately. Like keep your shorts on. Keep<br/>
your feet off the table. Lock the car door. My kids are teasing the heck out<br/>
of me. More feet from more people go on the table. More doors start being<br/>
unlocked. Shorts come off of more people. My language has gone from mostly<br/>
positive to short sharp sentences, yuck. Any good reads to get me back up<br/>
liking to play sweetly most of the time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662847206">The more you try to force them to keep their clothes on the more they <br/>
will take them off!  I&#39;m looking at two naked butts right now, Lexie has <br/>
a big shirt on (one of mom&#39;s) but has a naked butt which is of course <br/>
sticking out.  Janene is completely naked, unless you count the marker <br/>
all over her body and face.  The only thing I said &quot;please don&#39;t draw on <br/>
your vulva.&quot;  She&#39;s four and she drew a circle around her belly button <br/>
then a square around that.  She said &quot;mom, look I drew a square.&quot;  I <br/>
said &quot;how do you know it&#39;s a square?&quot;  She said &quot;Because it has four <br/>
corners and four sides.&quot;  I have no idea where she got that, but she&#39;s <br/>
right.  It&#39;s a very nice square. Remind me to take a picture of her <br/>
masterpiece before we wash her tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s horridly hot here, so naked is good.  Lexie asked me the other day <br/>
why I didn&#39;t sleep naked, that it was cooler.  I had no idea how to <br/>
answer her.  How horrible that I am no longer comfortable enough with my <br/>
body to sleep naked.  How sad.  As for my kids--Lexie in that last year <br/>
has started wearing clothing around her daddy.  Except the other day, <br/>
when it was 107.  I asked her &quot;did the modesty go away or is it just too <br/>
hot to care&quot;  She giggled and said &quot;it&#39;s way too hot to care!&quot;  How <br/>
wonderful that is.  She&#39;s asked to go to a nudest beach.  I may see if I <br/>
can find one for her.  Of course, I absolutely hate the beach and the <br/>
sand, but if Lexie wants the experience, and asks again, I may find her <br/>
a nudest beach.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would quite worrying about your child and his facination <br/>
with his penis.  The more you give him attention for it the more he will <br/>
wiggle it at you.  I&#39;d ignore it, completely, have it become a nonissue. <br/>
 because really it is.  Same with your daughter.  The only thing I have <br/>
ever done with my girls is gently suggest if they are masterbating that <br/>
they need to go someplace more private.  But personally I think wiggling <br/>
and comparing, etc. are all normal.  <br/>
<br/>
In some cultures children are naked until they are older.  Do you think <br/>
they wiggle it at people.  No probably they put clothes on to make their <br/>
moms crazy.  <br/>

LOL.  I remember eyebrows raised in the Wal-mart when Dylan was showing<br/>
off and announcing to everyone, &quot;It&#39;s a big one&quot;.  <br/>
In my defense, so no one thinks I gave him that idea, everything was big<br/>
in those days, - it&#39;s a car, it&#39;s a big one - etc. I would just smile at<br/>
the strangers and blush a little maybe, but maybe not, because I had<br/>
three brothers.<br/>
He was younger than five though.<br/>
  <br/>
He used to sing the poopy song in stores too and in the post office where<br/>
it would really echo.  It went &quot;Poopy, poopy, poopy..&quot;.etc.  You&#39;ll be<br/>
happy to know at ten he isn&#39;t doing either any more.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun because it bothers you.  If you relax and act like you&#39;re not<br/>
even seeing it, it will eventually fade away.  (the behavior, not the<br/>
penis)<br/>
<br/>
Waggling body parts and feet on the table and naked bottoms won&#39;t really<br/>
harm anything.  As long as no one is in danger of getting frost bite.  If<br/>
you make it a big deal it will be a big deal and all the more fun to do. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The only thing I would redirect would be two small things. And I did both <br/>
when Jack went through the lets show everyone what I&#39;ve got stage. First we <br/>
talked about how his penis is his, and he should be comfortable with it, and <br/>
how glad I was that he was, and we talked about good touching and bad <br/>
touching. Then I gently suggested that if he was masturbating, that that is a <br/>
private thing, and he should do it in his bedroom or the bathroom. The other <br/>
thing I suggested was that if he was going to run around naked that he should <br/>
remember other peoples feelings. That his friend Alex has said she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to see his penis, so he probably shouldn&#39;t wave it around in front of <br/>
her or anyone else who he thought might not want to see it. He asked if he <br/>
could still be naked and I stated emphatically yes! Then he asked about Mrs. <br/>
Boos and I said no, probably she wouldn&#39;t want to see his penis either. Mrs. <br/>
Boos is our 93 yo next door neighbor who attends Mass twice daily. &lt;g&gt; Little <br/>
kids are curious about their bodies. And I want mine to be comfortable with <br/>
theirs. And I definitely want mine to be able to come to me about things too. <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re probably right. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I told my kids without alarming them, just matter-of-factly, that public <br/>
nudity is illegal, but people make exceptions for really little kids.  And <br/>
because most people WOULD be nice about them while they were little, they <br/>
needed to get with the program and cover up as they got older.  I told them I <br/>
didn&#39;t want trouble with social services, and some people might say I was a <br/>
bad mom if they were running around naked.  They understood that fine.<br/>

Wow, that is hilarious!  I bet the chickens weren&#39;t impressed with their <br/>
abilities.<br/>
Trevor and his bestest (very hyper) buddy saw some geese my sil had brought <br/>
over to show me....they had been rescued from an auction and were on their <br/>
way to being released in the wild, waiting patiently in their very tight <br/>
quarters (which was a box).<br/>
The boys thought geese MUST need water, I mean they live in ponds and lakes <br/>
right?<br/>
So they started pouring water on the poor birds, who became quite hysterical <br/>
at the cold dousing and staring trying to get out of the boxes.<br/>
My sil has never forgiven them I don&#39;t think. It took 1/2 hour to disentangle <br/>
and repackage the poor dears so they could be on their way to Battleground <br/>
lake.<br/>
Boys will be boys........<br/>

Maybe you are just plain ol&#39; tired. Anybody would be.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a wading pool for the kiddos to jump in<br/>
and out of with their little naked selves? When they<br/>
are all cooled off a nice towel and soft sweats<br/>
(pants)feel good and are acceptable in public. A<br/>
little &quot;muscle&quot; shirt isn&#39;t too bad, either. Do you<br/>
have any dress-up clothes and costumes to play with?<br/>
Maybe a cape or cowboy boots....some hats...paint?<br/>
<br/>
My DH used to put his (long, long) legs across the<br/>
table.....until DS4 started doing it too. Too late. Oh<br/>
well. Now DS4 (Roy, 8) puts his whole self on the<br/>
table. Drives DH batty. they both tip chairs back,<br/>
too, until the joints come apart....then blame each<br/>
other. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
When DS1 was 3 he would take everything out of the<br/>
drawers and shelves and fling it on the floor. I&#39;de<br/>
carefully put it all back when he was through. I put<br/>
the laundry away in the drawer and on the shelves.<br/>
Finally I said &quot;Why do you keep doing this? Is it fun<br/>
or do you just not like things to be on shelves and in<br/>
drawers?&quot;  The sweet little guy answered &quot;You are<br/>
always putting things away, I thought that was what<br/>
YOU liked to do.....so I was giving you something to<br/>
do after everything was all put away. I&#39;m helping<br/>
you.&quot; And his lovely little grin. Moral of the<br/>
story.....check out the motives of the kids<br/>
<br/>
.....your exasperation may actually be quite comical<br/>
to the kids. DS4 thinks I look really really funny<br/>
when I roll my eyes or make mad faces or look<br/>
exasperated (expecially).  He repeats actions that<br/>
evoke those faces....and I can&#39;t seem to help myself,<br/>
sometimes. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
A good read is Always_Learning list and the<br/>
Unschooling.com message boards.  :-) also Sandra&#39;s<br/>
web-sites. Really.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck....and YOU still like to play sweetly....the<br/>
kiddos just like excitement too.<br/>
