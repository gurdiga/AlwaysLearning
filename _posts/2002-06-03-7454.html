&lt;&lt;  Part of me is <br/>
game for trying school in that she will then know from experience just what <br/>
it is like to sit still, raise her hand, be burdened with homework, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could take a deep breath, go in there and talk to the counselor or <br/>
teacher or whoever, and say with all possible bravado something like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My daughter wants to try school.  I don&#39;t want her to, but it&#39;s really <br/>
important to me to give her educational freedom.   I&#39;m going to enroll her <br/>
and give you two weeks to wow her.  If she loves it after two weeks, I&#39;ll let <br/>
her stay as long as she&#39;s having fun.  If after two weeks she&#39;s ambivalent or <br/>
it seems like the same nonsense I expect it to be, she&#39;ll be gone.  Just <br/>
wanted to give you a fair shot at keeping her in.&quot;<br/>
