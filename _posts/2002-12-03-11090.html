<div id="ygrps-yiv-839926815">Our old cat, Mr. Fuzzy died early Wednesday morning.   He&#39;d been with me<br/>
for 17 years.  That&#39;s longer than my son, longer than my husband.  <br/>
He had kidney failure and had been sick for months, but found some<br/>
quality of life with subcutaneous fluids and other medications.   <br/>
The other cats are trying hard to cheer us up but things just aren&#39;t the<br/>
same here.   He should still be purring me to sleep, tapping my nose to<br/>
wake me up and dipping his fingers in my morning coffee.  He should still<br/>
be on my lap when I type e-mail.  <br/>
His pal, Ribbie, cries for him at night, and I get up and we sit together<br/>
on the floor by the heater, where he used to like to lay, and I cry with<br/>
her.   I know we won&#39;t feel this bad forever.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986933288">Oh Deborah, I&#39;m so very sorry.  :-(  Loosing a companion like that is so <br/>
hard.  I&#39;ll light a candle for Mr. Fuzzy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658428563">Poor Deb and Ribbie and family. :( We lost a cat 18 months ago and his <br/>
surviving brother looked for him for days. So did our then-3 year old. :/<br/>
