<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037188124">Nice to see other Canadians here!!<br/>
<br/>
I am in Ontario, Canada. Between Ottawa & Toronto. Except that I am VERY<br/>
rural being surrounded by all farmland near a small village. We live in a<br/>
forest (in a house of course :)  )<br/>
<br/>
My brother & his wife & 2 children live near Vancouver. They are<br/>
&quot;mainstream&quot; though.<br/>

&gt; In reply to the below:<br/>
&gt;  Tia I live in the Black Creek area which is in the Comox Valley.  I<br/>
&gt; have two daughters one is just recently 10 and the other is to be 12 in<br/>
&gt; a month.  We have been on the island for just about two years now coming<br/>
&gt; from central Alberta via a 2 year stint in Nelson, BC.  Thanks for<br/>
&gt; asking.<br/>
&gt;  Susan<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;[] This conference by title sounds very interesting but I have never<br/>
&gt; &gt;heard of it.  I am obviously in the dark up here on Vancouver Island,<br/>
&gt; &gt;BC, Canada.  When is it? Where is it? What is the website as I presume<br/>
&gt; &gt;there is one?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt;Susan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Susan, where are you on the Island? I&#39;m in Sooke. My unschooler is 16.<br/>
