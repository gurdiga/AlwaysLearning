<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236198646">Our family is traveling to Australia (where my husband is from and his family live) at the end of the month. My oldest daughter is 8 and is having a lot of angst about the trip. She doesn&#39;t want to fly over the ocean, she&#39;s worried about her ears equalizing on the plane and she doesn&#39;t want to go to the beach (where the family spends two out of the four weeks of our trip). It seems like the two of us keep having the same conversation over and over and maybe that&#39;s what needs to happen, but I feel &#39;stuck.&#39; I don&#39;t know how to love her very well through this...thoughts?</div>

Maybe ask your husband to talk to her, if you’re in a loop that’s not changing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some people won’t agree about this, but dramamine knocks me out.  I used to get motion sickness when I was younger, and anxiety, and would take dramamine.  For young kids, I don’t know if half a tab would do.  Benedryl is another possibility, if it will make her sleepy.   Maybe you could experiment on a day when she has nowhere to go.  If she takes it at home and it relaxes her or induces a nap, you both might feel better about the possibility of using it again on the flight.  If she has a different reaction, you’ll know in advance and not risk learning that on the plane. <br/>
<br/>
If you find and audiobook she would really like, that might help.  Harry Potter might get her all the way there, with headphones and a sleep mask.<br/>
<br/>
-=- and she doesn&#39;t want to go to the beach (where the family spends two out of the four weeks of our trip). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Audiobook continuation? :-)<br/>
Have you asked her what would help?  She might have ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve heard some parents making things worse by too much agreement or sympathy in such cases.  Saying “I know you don’t want to go” is deadly.  If you KNOW, then why would you press her to go?   A few times when one of three children balked, I sometimes said I hadn’t gotten to do much as a child that was this cool, and talk it up as a thing I would’ve liked to have done and how excited I would have been.  The emotion from me of “how cool” was honest, and not projected on that child. It wasn’t “This will be fun,” it was “When I was a kid, I would have really been excited if…”<br/>

Depending on her interests, there might be something special there that would make trip more appealing to her. You might be able to find contact information for a local unschooling group, and e-mail them to see what there is to do in her interest area in the part of the country you are visiting. You could also look at picture books about Australia to&nbsp; her excited. </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2656"><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2658" dir="ltr"><span id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2657">In addition, I am thinking that a tablet of some sort would really help (if she doesn&#39;t already have one).&nbsp; There are great deals on lots of tablets right now with the holidays coming up, especially on some of the Kindles. </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2725" dir="ltr"><span></span><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2730" dir="ltr"><span id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2744">Has she met your husband&#39;s family much? It could be that she is uncomfortable with being with new people. If she is shy, it might be overwhelming to be in a new environment with people she doesn&#39;t know.&nbsp; If she loves being around other kids, maybe she&#39;s worried about a 4 week trip with no one to play with. If she wants friends around, you can tell her about cousins who&nbsp; there (if there are any), or you can plan to meet up with a homeschooling or unschooling group while you are there.&nbsp; If she prefers time to herself or with you, you could make sure to reassure her that she&#39;ll still have some 1:1 time with your or time to herself or whatever (and make it happen!). </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2714" dir="ltr"><span></span><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2713" dir="ltr"><span id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2712">Has she been on a plane before?&nbsp; When I flew for the first time at her age, I thought that the plane would be metal and rounded on the inside, too, and I was really scared about how I was going stand up while it was in motion.&nbsp; If she hasn&#39;t seen the inside of a plane, she might benefit from seeing pictures or movies with people flying to ease her fears. If she is afraid of the ocean, you could watch movies or read books about happy times at the beach. Maybe she has a fear of sharks or of deep water or something.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;m wrong and she just doesn&#39;t like the beach.&nbsp; Just some thoughts to consider.&nbsp; </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2886" dir="ltr"><span></span><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2876" dir="ltr"><span></span><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2813" dir="ltr"><span></span><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2814" dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></div><br>  <div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2602" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue-Light, Helvetica Neue Light, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2601" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2600" dir="ltr"> <font id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2599" face="Arial" size="2"> <hr size="1" id="ygrps-yiv-1827904452yui_3_16_0_1_1449842257602_2659"> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> &quot;jessiwoodman@...

It was the beginning of learning mind tricks! &nbsp;It&#39;s such an opportunity for your daughter to learn how to not let her anxieties get in the way of living life! &nbsp;And it&#39;s a bonding opportunity for you both. &nbsp;If you become her supportive parent through the anxiety, she will always look back and be grateful for how you helped her, like I am to my dad!</div><div><br></div><div>I appreciate how he kept my anxious feelings compartmentalized away from what was actually happening. &nbsp;I learned that I was like him- we both got anxious tummies but we could both still do things like travel or play piano on a stage (this was another big issue for me as a kid.).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Preparation was key to alleviating anxiety for me. &nbsp;We worked on a plan well in advance. &nbsp;I always took Dramamine as a child to avoid the motion sickness I would get. &nbsp;I learned to sleep completely through a plane ride, even very long ones. &nbsp;Instead of dwelling on my anxiety, I learned to focus on the tasks at hand. &nbsp;I learned to think about something else whenever anxious thoughts came into my head. &nbsp;I learned about breathing slowly and deeply. &nbsp;I would do square breathing- breathe in for 1-2-3-4, hold for 1-2-3-4, breath out 1-2-3-4, hold 1-2-3-4 and again. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When she is feeling anxious and talking about it, it might help to use those times to try different techniques. &nbsp;&quot;Oh you&#39;re feeling anxious about the trip! &nbsp;Let&#39;s try this to help you feel better.&quot; &nbsp;Like slow breathing, distraction, &nbsp;Rescue Remedy pastilles (which I now find helpful during these times). &nbsp;I have a homeopathic remedy I keep around for when I&#39;m feeling anxious and it helps me a lot now. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And then plan through the time on the plane ride with her. &nbsp;Talk about the backpack she will have with whatever is fun and distracting for her. &nbsp;(DvD player, laptop, etc?).

      <p>Our family is traveling to Australia (where my husband is from and his family live) at the end of the month. My oldest daughter is 8 and is having a lot of angst about the trip. She doesn&#39;t want to fly over the ocean, she&#39;s worried about her ears equalizing on the plane and she doesn&#39;t want to go to the beach (where the family spends two out of the four weeks of our trip). It seems like the two of us keep having the same conversation over and over and maybe that&#39;s what needs to happen, but I feel &#39;stuck.&#39; I don&#39;t know how to love her very well through this...thoughts?</p>

<p>We live in Australia, and my family live in the UK, so my son and I have done a lot of long-haul flights.</p>

</span></div>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161267433Signature"><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:16px;line-height:19.52px;">Practice at home? You can make your ear equalize by holding your nose. Maybe if she realizes she can do it at home, she won&#39;t be so worried? Also chewing gum or candy
 helps with equalizing ears on a plane.<br>
<br>
==she doesn&#39;t want to go to the beach (where the family spends two out of the four weeks of our trip)==&nbsp;<br>
</span><br>
Do you know why? Can you tell her all the fun things about beaches in Australia? It&#39;s hot, you can surf, boogie-board, just generally play in the ocean and sand? When you say you are staying at the beach, I assume just near a beach - so can you and she come
 up with other things to do that don&#39;t involve the beach while you are there? Not sure whereabouts in Australia you are going, but most places have great zoo&#39;s, museums, wildlife parks, amusement parks (Gold Coast) - nothing to do with the beach!<br>
<br>
Talk about the fun parts of going on a plane - my son loves watching the movies and shows. Kids almost always get a little pack of toys/fun stuff. You get your meals brought to you. Last time my son took his camera and took photo&#39;s in all the airports we changed
 flights at. Help her pack a travel bag with things that will help comfort her - favourite toy, book, etc.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235139629"><p dir="ltr">Can you clarify why &quot;I know you don&#39;t want to go&quot; is deadly? With my kids, they seem to really appreciate that validation. My son will say, &quot;so why are we going then?&quot; and I can explain (again, because we talk it through from the start). We don&#39;t do an endless loop, but if he doesn&#39;t want to go and I know it, why wouldn&#39;t I be honest about that?</p>

<br/>
Because he has no choice, right?  Why go in that direction, toward negativity?  Sell it.  Inspire him.  Make the situation fun and positive in every possible way.<br/>
<br/>
It’s not about being dishonest, it’s about not feeding the angst or fear or reluctance, if there really isn’t an option.<br/>
<br/>
Discussing, “validating,” asking to hear more and more of the negative “no” isn’t moving toward the possibility of joy.<br/>

<br/>
I’ve heard parents “validate” about doctors, dentists, medical procedures, and it scares the kids more for the mom to share that emotion and say that it makes sense and she totally understands.  IF she totally understands, then WHY (the child must wonder) doesn’t she just cancel the whole thing?  So it’s not good for the relationship, nor for the upcoming event, for the mom to “validate.”<br/>

You can be honest and sympathetic without “validating.”  Maybe I just really don’t like that term, and what it can mean, in scripted conversations and in “methods” like “active listening.”<br/>
<br/>
I think people live better by principles than by rules and scripts.  <br/>

<br/>
What is your priority, in this trip to Australia?  To feel connected?<br/>
I don’t like the dentist.  If my husband distracts me (as he did this week, by taking me to lunch and play Dr. Mario with me, and laughing and talking about things OTHER than the dentist) that IS CONNECTING.  He knew what I needed.   I did NOT need to talk about why I don’t like the dentist or have him tell me he understands, that it makes sense, that it’s scary, and do I want to talk about it some more.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents feed fears and then justify it.  If you want ideas for making things better, don’t cling to or defend something that could make it worse.<br/>

If you’re to be your child’s partner in life, will you wallow or live?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107790641">I can see Sandra&#39;s point about &#39;validating&#39; which I think is what I&#39;ve been doing a LOT of and part of why I&#39;ve been feeling stuck in a loop. My daughter and I are very similar in a lot of ways and my husband is much better at being positive--so I think they could have a more helpful talk together--he&#39;s also the local so he can highlight selling points more vividly.<br/>
This will be her fourth trip to AUS, so she is a  pretty seasoned traveler and she does know her grandparents quite well from visits and almost daily Skype sessions.<br/>
We did have a conversation tonight about getting more apps for her tablet that don&#39;t require Internet--and maybe listening to Harry Potter together. She wants to look for snacks that aren&#39;t candy (I&#39;ve previously given each child a giant bag of lollies for the plane), and Dramamine is in my Amazon cart, so I&#39;m feeling hopeful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157431082">Caryn’s notes were great, and this could help:  &quot;armed with gum and phone numbers to call home and her trusty Panda, she was able to travel across the country on wings of excitement instead of trapped in the clutches of her fears. “<br/>
<br/>
This sounds morbid, but crossing the ocean is spooky, and it might make a child feel better to have information ON her—name, parents’ names, contact at the destination with phone number, etc.  And first I thought a laminated card.    But I have another idea.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids fly I make a laminated luggage tag with their information and their host family information on one side, and the flight numbers and times on the other.  I have a laminating machine, and a hole punch, and ribbon, so it might not be as easy for someone who doesn’t have those things, but it’s doable.<br/>
<br/>
But for a younger child over water, there’s another idea, also from something we used to do.  Write on a white men’s handkerchief or a scarf with a sharpie, and tie it on the child’s neck.  When my kids went to crowded places with other families (state fair, amusement park, a city event) I would make one for each with his name, my name and phone number and the host mom’s name and phone number.  If they got separated or hurt, someone could contact one or both of the adults.  It made me feel better, and made them feel better. <br/>
<br/>
For someone who sews, a 25” square of white cloth, hemmed or stabilized some way, with writing along the edges, could be pretty, even, with a colored sharpie, and waterproof. And can be kept as a souvenir.    The advantage of a real cotton handkerchief is that the cloth is very thin and designed to be washed and to dry quickly and easily.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was to give a short speech in a ceremony.  I wrote it around the edge of a handkerchief, turned the cloth in my hands and read it, without it being obvious that I was doing so, and then gave it to the honoree afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Another possibility if the child doesn’t want to wear a scarf and the parents don’t have lamination and hole-punching equipment might be to write on the child with a Sharpie (sharp-tipped permanent marker).  That will last a day or two, and if it makes her feel more secure, that someone would know who she was in an emergency, it might be an easy solution.<br/>

<br/>
Part of the problem is the connotations of these words.  Not the DEnotation (the literal meaning) but the add-on, cultural, historical, emotional meanings.<br/>
<br/>
Validation sounds comforting, soothing, kind.  But in the original situation in which the child seemed to be continuously frightened and the same conversation was happening over and over, it seemed more that the mother’s “validation” was solidifying the justifying and encouraging the fear (maybe—I was saying if any of that was true, something else needed to happen).<br/>
<br/>
Having the dad speak with the child instead seems the easiest cycle-breaker.<br/>
<br/>
As to “sales pitch,” that’s a VERY loaded term.  It’s very often important for a parent to encourage a child to do something—to persuade, to cheer on, to inspire.  To call it “sales pitch” deflates all the potential joy and progress.  <br/>

<br/>
Those are great ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
If there’s time and it seems like it might be interesting, the movie Fly Away Home has a young girl (how old is she supposed to be?  I don’t remember—young teen?) flying an ultralight plane to lead geese.  There is a car wreck at the beginning, though, and it’s in Australia, so maybe either ignore me totally, or skip past that and set the movie up to start after she gets to Canada to live with her dad.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my idea is really bad. <br/>
<br/>
Are there other happy movies about flight that could be distracting and desensitizing/inspiring?  <br/>
What’s the one with Gerard Depardieu and Whoopi Goldberg in a plane?  (vague images… )  [“Bogus” is the name.  Doh… just went and read.  Mother dies in a car wreck.  Don’t want to implant a new and different fear.]<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just go with lots of happy kid movies that distract until it’s time to go. :-)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/movies">http://sandradodd.com/movies</a> has a new list of movies families might like to share. <br/>
SandraDodd.com/t/movies<br/>
<br/>
Sylvia Woodman compiled it after a discussion on Radical Unschooling Info on facebook.<br/>
<br/>
Movies might be downloaded to an iPad, too.  There will be things in the plane, but that might be harder to operate, and if there’s a familiar movie that will remind her of home, she might fall into the story and feel at home.  If it’s a new movie she’s seeing only because she’s in a plane, she might think that the whole time.<br/>
