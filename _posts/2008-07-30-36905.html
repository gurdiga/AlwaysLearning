<div id="ygrps-yiv-620105624">Hi,<br/>
We have been unschoolers since I pulled my two boys out of school over 3 years ago.  <br/>
My husband agreed to my decision and belief about unschooling primarily because school <br/>
was so awful for our kids and not a good fit; but I think he is wanting something different for <br/>
them now.<br/>
My in-laws are mostly teachers and have become more and more hostile toward me over this <br/>
decision.  It has come to the point where they don&#39;t really seem interested in my kids except <br/>
to quiz them on whether or not my method is &quot;working&quot;!  One brother of my hubby was <br/>
incredulous that my son told him he was learning while playing a video game.<br/>
I&#39;m not as worried about the aunts and uncles as I am about grandma and grandpa.  And I am <br/>
saddened that this affects their relationship in such a negative way with my children.  It also <br/>
seems to give them amunition when the kids act up or do something &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
I am new to this group and hope this post is appropriate; I apologize if it is not.<br/>
I was just hoping to hear stories about this, advice, suggestions, etc.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Christine</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How old are your kids?  What do they want to do?  Is your husband still<br/>
on board with unschooling?  Is he feeling influence from his family, or<br/>
is his discomfort coming from not really understanding unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to limit interaction with inlaws?  How important is it<br/>
for your kids to have a relationship with their grandparents?  Does your<br/>
husband know what he wants for your kids?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that you need to talk about educational goals with your<br/>
husband to see if you are on the same page.  Some dads have really<br/>
strong feelings about it and some are more complacent about it.  Mine<br/>
was more complacent about it and gradually came to accept unschooling,<br/>
and now fully advocates it.  It took a while, but we also didn&#39;t have<br/>
extended family making things hard.  We are lucky in that both of our<br/>
extended family members butt out, wether they agree or not with what we<br/>
do, they love us and accept our decisions and find good things about<br/>
what we are doing and try to ignore the things they don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sad for others who have interfering in-laws that place judgement<br/>
on them and use it to manipulate the relationship with the kids.  It&#39;s<br/>
icky.  If it were me in that situation, I would find a way to get that<br/>
icky out of my happy life.  It&#39;s harder if it&#39;s a partner and parent.<br/>
<br/>
There has been a lot written about helping spouses come to unschooling,<br/>
but it really depends on how open the spouse is.</div>
