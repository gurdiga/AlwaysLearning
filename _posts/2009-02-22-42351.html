<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125094664">**My mom had kids born in 1953, 1955, and 1959 and breastfed all of us.<br/>
Southern California. Was this really unusual? I never knew that.**<br/>
<br/>
La Leche was founded in 1956. That year the breastfeeding rate in the US had <br/>
dropped to 20%. Rates didn&#39;t start climbing till 1972. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah. It was unusual. :)<br/>
