<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024328093">Is anyone aware of any well written criticism&#39;s of unschooling?  I <br/>
always find it helpful to read the other side of an issue.  I would be <br/>
surprised if there were not a few educational articles speaking out <br/>
against unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
At one time I found a meta analysis of a few older criticism&#39;s of Holt, <br/>
but can&#39;t even locate that anymore.  I also couldn&#39;t find the actual <br/>
articles reviewed by the meta analysis.  I remember those boiling down <br/>
to the arguments that it takes either an extraordinary teacher, an <br/>
extraordinary student or both for this sort of process to work.  In <br/>
other words, not very compelling.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not, and I&#39;ve been involved in it for sixteen years, and I&#39;ve  <br/>
looked.<br/>
<br/>
I collect articles here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There is a pattern followed when people interview unschoolers.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a predictable and frustrating pattern.  They spend many interesting  <br/>
hours interviewing children such as mine and parents (such as myself  <br/>
sometimes) and then they write the article.  Then they call two  <br/>
&quot;experts&quot; (always two), and although the experts know zip, know zero  <br/>
unschoolers, and only go on the maybe 20 word summary the interviewer  <br/>
give them, they revile unschooling.  And they&#39;re quoted.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There is NO &quot;process&quot; that works well with a dull teacher or a dull  <br/>
student.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling works if there are two factors:<br/>
<br/>
1) The parent understands it.<br/>
<br/>
2) The parent&#39;s goals for their child match what unschooling can do.<br/>
<br/>
Academics, who obviously have a lot invested in school working and  <br/>
being necessary, have a hard time grasping that it can work. So  <br/>
anything negative they write is from a point of not understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has goals that unschooling isn&#39;t meant to meet -- getting  <br/>
any child into Harvard, keeping a child academically on par with the  <br/>
schools, getting a specific type of feedback that learning is taking  <br/>
place -- is going to find things to complain about unschooling. But  <br/>
that&#39;s like complaining that the hammer didn&#39;t spread butter well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Which is an argument from a point of view of not understanding  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Which doesn&#39;t really answer your question but is a reason why it&#39;s  <br/>
hard to find solid writing against unschooling.<br/>

And although the schools don&#39;t do so well themselves at getting kids  <br/>

seems always to get a bigger hammer.<br/>

(supposedly) some kids get into Harvard that the process therefore  <br/>
works and just either needs tweaked for kids outside the norm or the  <br/>
kids are at fault for not taking advantage of the process.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From this week&#39;s e-Skeptic, an obituary by Michael Shermer about a <br/>
remarkable old friend:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Although Jerry [Andrus] had no formal degrees, he was one of the most <br/>
creative, eclectic, and diverse minds I have ever encountered, a true <br/>
polymath. (It sometimes makes me wonder if a college education, especially a <br/>
higher degree, can confine the mind and restrict thinking into pre-arranged <br/>
categories that attenuates cross- and inter-disciplinary pollination, but I&#39;ll <br/>
save that discussion for another day.) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if most people take the habit of categorical thinking with them <br/>
from school to college, or to put it another way, if the mind has already <br/>
been confined by school a long time before arriving at college.<br/>
