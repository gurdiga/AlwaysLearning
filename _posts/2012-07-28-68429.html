<br/>
If someone wants to contact the moderators, add -owner between the list name and @yahoogroups.com, e.g.,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning-owner@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
BUT, every single email has a link at the very very bottom, beneath the blue bar, a link to &quot;unsubscribe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are also links there to the website where there are other ways to unsubscribe.<br/>

I grew up Southern Baptist.  I know this book.  I know that life.<br/>

Each person who is on Always Learning joined of her (or his) own free will.<br/>

<br/>
I understand that when the fear of eternal damnation and the hope of eternal life are foremost in parents&#39; priorities that they might not want to be in conversations with people who feel differently.  That&#39;s fine.   There are unschoolers who are Christian, though, and the link above will lead to other sites.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some criticism of unschooling from a Christian point of view, if anyone things I&#39;m not being balanced.  I saved it myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599997860">Honestly???????<br/>
<br/>
I am a christian believer ~follower of Christ  and unschooling fits perfect with our family...because the same grace and mercy and loving kindness THE LORD has shown me and showered on me... i want to shower on my children. I love to learn from the parables and lovely Life Lessons  ~ like how Jesus drew in the sand to illustrate a point or the beatitudes , and how He just came alongside HIS Followers and LIVED LIFE with them as they learned from HIM. THAT is my Perfect example.<br/>

There&#39;s another group about unschooling when religion is a factor to take into consideration you might be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a website called Christian Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a believer as well, and probably use the Bible as a guidebook more than most Christians, since I&#39;m Torah Observant.  I agree that children sin.  However, I don&#39;t think the answer is ME and my teaching.  The answer is the Jesus and the Holy Spirit guiding their lives.  My job is to introduce them to God, explain to them my understanding of the Scriptures and dialogue with them about that, and then trust that as they get to know him, they will be led by the Spirit themselves.  No amount of teaching can force them into a relationship with God.  They have to choose that for themselves.  And most topics aren&#39;t addressed directly in the Bible.    <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Train up a child in the way he should go,&quot; was understood by the ancient Israelites to mean to train him up in the way HE should go- according to his natural skills and interests, because God gives us those for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
Deut: 6:4  &quot;You shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Not at the kitchen table from text books, but as a living breathing part of the way you interact.  It&#39;s something you model and live. <br/>
<br/>
Also, the ancient rabbis would say, when teaching a child, &quot;We are learning together,&quot; and would teach by asking questions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137319568">I am a Christian and find radical unschooling to be in line with my beliefs. It was actually my church that led me toward unschooling. I hope you will read all the wonderful radical Christian Unschooling blogs to gain encouragement of how in line with bible teachings this lifestyle truly is. And maybe read Gentle Christian Mothers website about gentle, mindful parenting.<br/>
I&#39;ve saved some of my favorite links regarding if Christians can Unschool here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cordovaacademy.blogspot.com/2011/12/christian-unschooling.html?m=1">http://cordovaacademy.blogspot.com/2011/12/christian-unschooling.html?m=1</a><br/>
