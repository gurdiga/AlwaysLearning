<div id="ygrps-yiv-569487983">Steph L.: Shan, can you send me more info about the gathering on the 10th?<br/>
<br/>
Steph, if you&#39;re on this list, info on the February 10th meetup in Halfmoon, New York is here:<br/>
<br/>
I found the question in the chatroom but Shan hadn&#39;t seen it and doesn&#39;t have contact info.<br/>

<br/>
The Uzoma Black Unschoolers Conference scheduled for early March in Atlanta has been postponed without a definite date.  Maybe late summer.  Maybe a one-day conference.  I&#39;m booked most of the summer and might not be in on it anymore (I offered the option, even if I&#39;m available, to lighten the financial and scheduling load, by leaving me out).  <br/>
<br/>
This, though, I hope you&#39;ll all consider:  late July in Albuquerque.<br/>
