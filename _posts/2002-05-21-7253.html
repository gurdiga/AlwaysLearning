&gt; Johnson&#39;s, walking distance from the play we were seeing, and only $30.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dar<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Walking distance, except for the mad rush after the play to drive you back<br/>
to your hotel before check-out time was over! That was one of the longest<br/>
plays I&#39;ve ever been to! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about you today, Dar, after watching the weather and seeing<br/>
the nasty storms and tornados in the Sacramento area and even snow at the<br/>
higher elevations! Everything okay with you guys out on the farm? I hope so.<br/>

interesting :-)<br/>

Cacie got a copy of Cyrano at the used book sale last weekend, BTW. I<br/>
love Bag Day...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was really stormy. I went from thinking it was time to get the swamp<br/>
cooler going to turning on the heater, all within 24 hours or so. They<br/>
even cancelled softball practice - I guess they&#39;ll play in rain, but not<br/>
in storms.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about tornados, though. The one thing I really miss living<br/>
out here is getting a daily newspaper... I don&#39;t like reading it online,<br/>
but I miss knowing what&#39;s going on...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s windy again today, although yesterday was lovely. My dad&#39;s coming to<br/>
visit from Tucson on Sunday, he said it&#39;s over 100 there already...<br/>
