<div id="ygrps-yiv-291875290">The trick here is to show him that learning <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to come from schoolbooks (in fact, <br/>
the best learning comes from anything *but* <br/>
schoolbooks).  Keep a learning log for a while, <br/>
and show it to him when he asks.  Jot down <br/>
discussions, observations, questions asked and <br/>
answered, explanations given, projects and <br/>
experiments, nature walks, anything you can <br/>
think of during the day that demonstrates <br/>
learning.  It will amaze you, and hopefully <br/>
convince him.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was against homeschooling at first, <br/>
but agreed to let me try it for summer school.  <br/>
We were supposed to discuss it at the end of <br/>
the summer and decide whether we would send my <br/>
son to 1st grade.  When the time came, there <br/>
was no need for discussion, and I continued <br/>
homeschooling.  This was almost 13 years ago, <br/>
by the way, when homeschooling was still pretty <br/>
rare.  We started with school at home, but <br/>
gradually went more and more toward unschooling <br/>
as I read John Holt&#39;s works and met other <br/>
unschoolers.  My son is now 18 and finishing <br/>
his sophomore year of college, and my 17-year-<br/>
old daughter is studying for the CHSPE, <br/>
volunteering at the local library, and drawing <br/>
incessantly.  I see them as proof that <br/>
unschooling works.<br/>
