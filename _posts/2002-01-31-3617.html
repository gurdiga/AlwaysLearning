<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651469139">I think that whole issue of calling oneself an &quot;unschooler&quot; before your child <br/>
is even of school age is showcases inexperience in some cases. I&#39;m not <br/>
talking about any certain person, but just in general.<br/>
Because until your child is old enough to attend school how can you UN <br/>
school? You could adhere to unschooling philosophies/ child-led <br/>
learning/attachment style parenting or whatever....but they aren&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
And there is nothing wrong with that, we&#39;ve all been there. But when you are <br/>
taking flak for not putting your child in school, answering concerned <br/>
relatives questions, trying to conform to state laws and still adhere to your <br/>
unschooling beliefs etc....THAT is where experience plays a huge part.<br/>
No one questions why a toddler would be home with you. It&#39;s a whole different <br/>
ball of wax, YK?<br/>
The arguements posed in defense of  different experiences/different wisdom <br/>
are missing the point! I think that is one of the biggest differences in my <br/>
30&#39;s...that I EXPECT to understand things deeper and with more experience in <br/>
my 40&#39;s, 50&#39;s and beyond. I also respect the wisdom of many elders I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have before. Most people in their 90&#39;s have a lot to teach me. Even if their <br/>
views don&#39;t strictly adhere to mine. Then let&#39;s take the people who ARE very <br/>
thoughtful, and have similar views. It would be silly to say &quot;oh, they just <br/>
have a different experience, my wisdom is equally as valuable&quot;. NO, it&#39;s not <br/>
in every case because (let&#39;s use Sandra here since I know she&#39;s older than <br/>
me) Sandra has lived life as a young mother, as a 35y,o. and an unschooler <br/>
and I haven&#39;t yet!! So that makes her input more valuable than mine on the <br/>
topic of unschooling, yes!<br/>
Now if we&#39;re talking about being raised in Alaska, I have more experience <br/>
although I&#39;m younger.<br/>
So your arguement only holds water if we&#39;re talking experience in different <br/>
topics.<br/>
I thought we were discussing unschooling experience and parenting.<br/>
It&#39;s rather shortsighted to say that it&#39;s all equal regardless of age or ages <br/>
of children.<br/>

can be completely different for people.  There are so<br/>
many factors, child&#39;s sex, closeness in age to<br/>
siblings, only child,.....If some one has raised an<br/>
only child for 15 years that is a girl, they will have<br/>
a different parenting experience than some one who has<br/>
raised 6 boys spanning the last 25 years.  Their<br/>
experiences as parents have been very different, even<br/>
if they were unschooling the whole time.  What would I<br/>
judge their wisdom on?  The number of years?  The<br/>
amount of children?  Or, better yet, how about I<br/>
listen to them regardless of those things and see if<br/>
they have anything to offer that I find useful?<br/>
<br/>
How does that not hold water?  <br/>

<br/>
Experience does not (necessarily) equal wisdom.<br/>
Youth does not (necessarily) equal naivete.<br/>
<br/>
Passion and theory also do not equal experience.<br/>
<br/>
There is, simply, no shortcut to experience. There is no substitute for it.<br/>
I can be the smartest person in the room, the most well-read, the most<br/>
thoughtful. I can&#39;t be the most experienced in every aspect of life,<br/>
unschooling or otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I am doing some research (casual, for my own enjoyment) about Navy SEALs. I<br/>
am learning things about them from a variety of sources. One of those<br/>
sources is an ex-SEAL. There is no way, no matter how much I study and how<br/>
many facts I can produce, that I can get his kind of experience. If someone<br/>
wanted to know about BUD/S, and he and I and an Admiral who had not been a<br/>
SEAL were all in the same room, Admiral So-and-So and I could, with probably<br/>
varying degrees of expertise, tell the person that BUD/S means Basic<br/>
Underwater Demolition/Swimming and is the training course that wannabe SEALs<br/>
go through, and what it entails.<br/>
<br/>
Only the SEAL could tell them what it felt like to be on day 7 of Hell Week<br/>
with four total hours of sleep for the week under his belt, soaking wet for<br/>
the 7th day running, with most of his class having quit already. Only he<br/>
would know what it was really like to really live through that. Only he<br/>
would know and might be able to communicate what it was in him that brought<br/>
him through, and what he learned from it at the time.<br/>
<br/>
If I am talking to a dog trainer who has trained only one Golden Retriever<br/>
thus far in her career, and she is about to train her first Pit Bull, she<br/>
will be able to tell me, from her reading and her observation, some things<br/>
that she has learned about training dogs in general and maybe some things<br/>
she&#39;s read or observed others doing with Pit Bulls in particular.<br/>
<br/>
If she and I were standing in a room of dog owners and she knew that for the<br/>
past five years I had worked with an animal rescue group specializing in Pit<br/>
Bull rescue and rehabilitation, who would it make the most sense for a new<br/>
Pit Bull owner to listen to?<br/>
<br/>
The reason that things like support groups and this list and Le Leche League<br/>
and classes and training courses and conversations with mentors exist are<br/>
because there is no substitute for experience and living through specific<br/>
stages of life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been through my 20s. I&#39;ve argued, passionately and with full sincerity,<br/>
what you&#39;re arguing. And I didn&#39;t believe my 30s would make any difference,<br/>
either. So I know none of this helps you now, but later, when you&#39;re feeling<br/>
different and might not quite know why, it might help you. It did me, and I<br/>
was grateful for the annoying people who had warned me of what was to come.<br/>

have any children yet?<br/>
<br/>
If not, then I think it&#39;s fair to say that you&#39;re not &quot;unschooling&quot; until<br/>
you have school-age children... although I think it&#39;s really cool that<br/>
people whose kids aren&#39;t yet &quot;school age&quot; hang out here and at the park<br/>
days and all that. <br/>
<br/>
I do know an awful lot of &quot;homeschoolers&quot; who sent their kids to school<br/>
starting in kindie or first, though. Not saying you&#39;ll be one of them,<br/>
but somehow it seems much easier to say you&#39;re a  an unschooler or<br/>
homeschooler with a 3 yr old.<br/>

was visiting yesterday.  She was delighted to tell my daughter that her <br/>
daughter was learning her alphabet.  This little girl, who is about 17 <br/>
months old is being taught to repeat the letters after her mother.  She <br/>
hasn&#39;t got a clue what it all means, but her mother thinks she&#39;s learning <br/>
her alphabet.  My grandson, at just about 16 months, isn&#39;t the least bit <br/>
interested in the alphabet, though he&#39;s crazy about books.  If he asked <br/>
Heather what the letters were, she&#39;d happily tell him.  Otherwise, it just <br/>
isn&#39;t an issue.  Now I know that lots of people who end up sending their <br/>
kids to school would have the same attitude when their kids are that <br/>
little, but isn&#39;t my daughter unschooling Kaelin?  Does it make a <br/>
difference that she&#39;s also unschooling Skye, age 7?   I&#39;ve always told <br/>
people who were worried that they wouldn&#39;t be able to do a good job of <br/>
homeschooling that they&#39;ve been doing it since their child was born.  I <br/>
think that if they&#39;ve also been letting their child make any educational <br/>
decisions during those &quot;preschool&quot; years, then they&#39;ve been unschooling <br/>
since birth.  Obviously they aren&#39;t experienced unschoolers in the sense <br/>
that people with older kids are, but I don&#39;t agree that they aren&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

preschool at age 2, and quite a few folks put infants as young as a couple months<br/>
into daycare -- and when our son was younger, we we&#39;re constantly asked what<br/>
daycare he was in, or, around age 2, what &quot;school&quot; he was attending.  he&#39;s a tall<br/>
kid, and it seems like since he was about 3 1/2 every time we went shopping during<br/>
the week someone would say, &quot;oh, and why aren&#39;t you in school today?&quot;  he used to<br/>
say he was &quot;too young for school,&quot; but now he just smiles and says, &quot;we&#39;re always<br/>
