We read them together, we talked a lot and at her request, I helped her with and reminded her of some of those techniques. I DID NOT do what a lot of the books, websites and experts advised—systematic desensitization, refusing to reassure her etc. I DID NOT seek a diagnosis nor put her in therapy. I did remove as many stressors from her life as possible, practiced patience and offered her as much of a safe and secure environment as I could. I observed her carefully and built her trust in me, learning what triggered her anxieties and helping her cope and overcome some of them.&quot;</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Times;font-size:16px;line-height:normal;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Times;font-size:16px;line-height:normal;">Thanks,</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Times;font-size:16px;line-height:normal;">Shira</span></div></div>

I coached her to use hand sanitizer just on the palms of her hands. &nbsp;Another manifestation of her anxiety was that she asked for reassurance constantly. While before I&#39;d resisted giving it to her, fearing that I was feeding her behavior, I switched to answering her questions and then reminding her that I&#39;d already answered her -- asking her to remember what I&#39;d told her, helping her to think about what my previous answer had been - gradually learning to reassure herself. &nbsp;I never withheld reassurance but I encouraged her to find it within herself, listen to her &quot;logical brain&quot; when she could.</div><br><blockquote type="cite"><div style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><div id="ygrps-yiv-2035757147ygrp-mlmsg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-2035757147ygrp-msg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-2035757147ygrp-text"><div class="ygrps-yiv-2035757147ygroups-quoted"><div id="ygrps-yiv-2035757147ygrps-yiv-1648893190"><div>Also, I&#39;m curious, if anyone else wants to chime in. &nbsp;If there is already a genetic predisposition in a family for OCD (meaning, a parent has it, or an aunt, or uncle, grandparent, etc), does that point to a more chemical/genetic cause and less environmental/stress cause (although stress would be a contributing factor in any case)? &nbsp;</div><div>I have a fear that no matter what I do this will inevitably follow some sort of biological route to worse and worse. &nbsp;I&#39;m scared for my child, scared for what she will go through, how she will feel, how she is already feeling. &nbsp;I guess reading that book will help. &nbsp;But I&#39;d like to hear more stories about OCD, if possible. &nbsp;Has anyone&#39;s child needed medication? &nbsp;Are there other cases like Chris&#39;s daugther, where the child pretty much got better?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I believe that OCD can be more prevalent in certain families. &nbsp;As far as I know, there isn&#39;t anyone with OCD in my daughter&#39;s genetic ancestry, but there are certainly other neuroses and even some psychoses. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know how old your child is but I&#39;ve noticed that many children go through a period of heightened anxiety around the age of 7-8-9 years old and can take a few years to come through it. &nbsp;My daughter was 8 years old when something happened that triggered her anxieties to spiral out of control. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We&#39;ve not used or felt the need for medication but I do have friends whose children have been medicated for OCD and other mental illnesses. &nbsp;They were not unschooled though, and so I can not know how or if their ability to cope would have been different if they had. &nbsp;I do know that if my daughter had been going to school, I would not have been able to take the approach with helping her that I did. &nbsp;She was given as much control as possible over her situation, and that often meant that she chose not to participate in activities that involved leaving the house, being in public, or risking being around people that she thought might be contagiously ill. &nbsp;Attending school on any kind of regular basis would&#39;ve been impossible for her.</div><div><br></div><div>Chris</div></span></blockquote></div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533761276"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m scared for my child, scared for what she will go through, how she will feel, how she is already feeling.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Around the age of 8 my son started playing a game called Tinkatolli.  It&#39;s a very cute game that uses found objects in the game to make new objects, and encourages kids to do the same thing at home.  The newly made objects were very cute, and my son, who was and is a very sensitive boy, thought these objects were so special that he developed an attachment to them.  The thing that really solidified his endearment to these cute found object creations was the fact that they would have been garbage otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
As a consequence, he started not wanting to throw any garbage out at all.  He felt that it all had potential and could be useful similar to what was being portrayed in the game.  He seemed genuinely disturbed by the thought of discarding these items and appealed to me to save them.  So I did.  I didn&#39;t tell anyone other than a good friend of mine because I was afraid people would think I was nuts.  But, I had bins and boxes stashed in corners of rooms filled with cereal boxes, granola bar wrappers, tin cans, straws, lids, cups, chip bags, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The most challenging part was when we travelled to Vancouver for two weeks and Ethan decided he wasn&#39;t going to eat because I told him we couldn&#39;t possibly save all the packaging while we travelled.  Obviously, not eating wasn&#39;t an option.  My forcing him to comply didn&#39;t feel comfortable to me.  So, I decided, and Doug agreed, that we would get an empty box from a grocery store, fill it with everything Ethan wanted to save, and mail it back to ourselves on our last day traveling.  Ethan loved this idea.  <br/>
<br/>
In the box we had the same stuff as we did at home - wrappers, boxes and cans - as well as a few items we found in the sand on the beach.  I tried to buy as much food as I could that didn&#39;t have packaging to save room.  At the end of the two weeks the box was completely full, and I mailed it out of Tofino, BC.  The cost was $20 in stamps.  Very inexpensive compared to the damage I feel I could have done.<br/>
<br/>
Once home, the collecting continued - though a little less, which was interesting to note.  One week or so later the box of collected items came.  I asked Ethan if he wanted to open it.  He said no.  His need to collect started to wane.  About a year later, when Ethan no longer was asking to save our wrappers and things, I asked him again if he wanted to open the box together.   He said sure.  We went through it all.  I asked if we could recycle some of the items and throw out the rest or if he would like to save it all as a memento.  He picked out a few items - mostly the things he found on the beach - and said to recycle the rest.  I did.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I was a bit worried.  But then I thought, what would be worse than a house full of wrappers and boxes and cans?  I decided it would be the potential for my son to live his life feeling a little (or a lot) less whole due to not having his very real attachment to these items taken seriously.  It all worked out fine.  Along the way we also collected stuffed birds, stuffed cats, and happy faces - all items he seemed to have a very deep attachment to.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like that now.  He&#39;s eleven.  He saves very little any more.  Actually, I save more than he does now for my own sentimental reasons.  I don&#39;t know if that was OCD.  It was a compulsion that might not have seemed ordinary to some.  For us it was something we needed to make room for.  So we did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325801800">For Ethan, for many years, saving things was really important to him.  We saved all his toys, books, drawings, creations, and things he simply touched - anything he requested.  We took pictures of things that would inevitably disappear, like snowmen or jack-o-lanterns or drawings in the sand.<br/>
<br/>
But, he would get very attached to surprising things as well.  Like, one time, when he was very young, I bought a fancy compost for our back patio, and I wanted to show him.  I picked up the closest piece of food to me, which happened to be a mushroom, and brought him out back with me.  I tossed the mushroom into the compost, gave the bin and spin, and said &quot;There!&quot;  He asked me what was going to happen to the mushroom.  I told him it would turn to dirt, and we could use the dirt to plant more food.  He fell in a heap on the ground a began to weep.  I quickly reached into the bin, pulled out the mushroom, rinsed it off and gave it to him.  &quot;Here it is!&quot;  I said.  He looked up at me with big tear filled, grateful eyes and held that mushroom like it was the most precious thing in the world.  I put it in our window.  It eventually withered, and I think he forgot about it, but I realized that day that he was very, very sensitive.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I&#39;ve had to be careful about talking about things like natural disasters.  Still do to some extent.  He would get very frightened about the idea of a tornado, for example, and ask the same questions over and over, needing constant reassurance that there wasn&#39;t going to be one soon.  He would pace, and have a difficult time sleeping.  I learned what his triggers were, and avoided them mostly. Sometimes I would talk lightly about the things I knew had bothered him, to see where he currently was, emotionally, with those things.  <br/>
<br/>
This past year we travelled to Japan.  While we were there, there were two hurricanes heading our way.  One hit lightly.  There was a 7.3 earthquake and a small tsunami.  I wasn&#39;t sure how much to reveal to Ethan, but it turned out he had a very natural reaction as I slowly revealed the news to him.  <br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t care what Ethan has.  I care who he is.  I understand what it&#39;s like to be very sensitive.  I&#39;m like that myself.  Doug (his dad) is too actually.  I understand what paralyzing anxiety feels like.  I&#39;ve felt it myself, many times.  I wish people had helped me navigate those things rather than try to fix me or make my sensitivities go away.  I&#39;ve had to learn to do that myself.  <br/>
<br/>
What I want for Ethan is that same thing I want for myself.  For him to know who he is, what his limits are, how to navigate difficult emotions, and how to make the most of his strengths.  <br/>
<br/>
If it helps another parent to get a diagnosis to better understand what their child is feeling and going through, then great!!  But don&#39;t look at the diagnosis more than the child.  The clues to how to move forward in the best way possible are held in the mannerisms and reactions of that child.  Pay attention to those.  To how they change in different environments, under different circumstances, and at different stages of development.  In my humble opinion, that will be the best guide for both you, and in the long run, for your child.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669395403">Thank you to everyone for your responses. &nbsp;Sandra - because of having followed along here for several years now, I was able to &#39;give&#39; myself the advice you gave after reading my words of fear and worry. &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;I spent the first day after noticing these behaviors freaking out inside myself. &nbsp;I spent the next day examining every little thing she did, trying to see what was normal child quirks and what was OCD. &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t tell! &nbsp;We were in a room full of kids at a program, and I was looking at her, judging all the things I saw her doing... and then I thought to myself, I&#39;ve never thought those things were OCD before this - so I looked around at the other kids just as intently, and saw them doing the same sorts of things. &nbsp;I realized that most of what she does is just normal, and only a few things she does are out of the ordinary. &nbsp;That was day 2. &nbsp;I kept all of this to myself (and my husband) - I think I was just working through it. &nbsp;By day three since noticing all this, I feel much calmer, I&#39;m waiting for those books Chris recommended from the library, I&#39;m asking around about a play-therapist, and I&#39;m focusing on appreciating all that my girl is, which is so much more than a few compulsions that get in her way some times of the day. &nbsp;She already commented today that getting out the door today was easier for her than its been in a while. &nbsp;And I think thats because I&#39;ve been thinking about how I can lessen her stress, and where I have been unconsciously leaning on her as an &#39;older&#39; kid now. &nbsp;Being kinder to her, more touching, longer patience (and deep breathing), etc. &nbsp;Its helped that my husband recently started taking a course at college two nights a week, and this is the first week I&#39;ve been home at nights alone. &nbsp;I thought it would be so much harder! &nbsp;But without him here, I find myself softer with them, and we&#39;ve spent more time cuddling, reading on the sofa, etc, until bedtime. &nbsp;Its been nice.<div><br></div><div>So, I appreciate all the stories everyone shared with good endings, and also Sandra&#39;s examination of my words.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Loads of appreciation for this list,</div><div>Shira</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-210407767"><p>One of my children went through a phase for several months of hand washing, lip licking, interrupting by shouting things like I dropped xyz on the floor a couple of times in a row and asking if he was good (the last part made me feel especially sad as yes! &nbsp;he is good!). &nbsp;That happened when he was 9 and after an incident with a friend whom he felt he disappointed and betrayed by telling the truth. &nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">Over time, he stopped doing most of those things except for the hand washing. &nbsp;The hand washing happened a few more times, but hasn&#39;t in a very long time now. &nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">What helped most I think was for me to believe in him...to trust him to figure out his big feelings, to give him space to learn about himself and time to gain confidence in trusting himself. &nbsp;I was there to help him if he needed me, and to step back if he didn&#39;t. &nbsp;</span><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br>Occasionally there are certain things that he feels he needs to do for a period of time. &nbsp;He continues to learn coping skills or moves past those things. &nbsp;<br><br>ie. There was a time when he didn&#39;t think the door was shut well enough and would shut it very hard many times over. I did ask him to stop shutting the car or house door so hard so many times. &nbsp;Eventually he asked me to shut the doors for him and he seemed to be relieved to not have to feel it might not be shut all the way. &nbsp;So I shut the doors and didn&#39;t make any big deal about it. &nbsp;I treated it like it was any other thing I&#39;d do when I left the house. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t mind doing it because it helped him. &nbsp;If we had made the shutting of the door a big deal, that would have added to our son&#39;s stress and likely make our son feel bad too. &nbsp;He certainly didn&#39;t need to feel ashamed on top of whatever feelings he was having that were making him feel uncomfortable shutting the door in the first place.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">That passed too. &nbsp;I can&#39;t even remember when he started shutting the door again, but he did. &nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Laurie&nbsp;</p></div>

As she relaxed and matured, she was better able to cope and face her anxieties when she wanted to. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, about eight years after her first problems surfaced, she persevered through six weeks of extreme anxiety taking driver&#39;s ed and getting her driver&#39;s license. &nbsp;I was really impressed that she stuck with it and passed all of her exams with flying colors in spite of being extremely anxious about driving. &nbsp;Not only is she an anxious driver, but she was driving with strangers… at night… and in snowstorms! I&#39;m not sure I could&#39;ve done it! She also experienced her first classroom-like situation sitting with 30+ other teens at desks set up in rows and with note-taking, hand-raising and pop-quizzes! &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I share this success story to let you know that your discovery of your child&#39;s OCD-like behaviors and anxieties - doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a life sentence of normal life crippling issues. &nbsp;I think you&#39;re well on your way to figuring that out - much faster than I did.</div><div><br></div><div>Chris</div></html></div>

For awhile, Mo was &quot;freezing up&quot; when we&#39;d go to the store and look at things she wanted - toys or books or games. I mean she&#39;d freeze in place like she was a statue, not speak, not respond in any way. It was... unsettling. A few times I carried her out to the car - poker stiff - and once we were at the car she was fine. I on &nbsp;the other hand, was a wreck. What was wrong with my kid?? So I started bringing a book with me - I figured if it happened again, I&#39;d sit down and read for awhile and see what happened - but I also decided to slow down a whole lot so I could try and figure out what was triggering that reaction. At the same time, I relaxed around the idea that my kid might turn into a statue in the middle of Walmart. I found out that what she needed was for me to drop any pressure around her making a choice - she was freezing up because I was standing there, waiting for her to Pick Something! Turned out, it was an easy fix. She&#39;d start shopping, and I&#39;d sit down and read until she was ready.&nbsp;<br><br>So it was really what Shira wrote - more kindness, patience, and reassurance from me. In Mo&#39;s case, that didn&#39;t include touching because touching isn&#39;t reassuring to her when she&#39;s stressed.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.541666030883789px;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13.541666030883789px;">---Meredith</span></p></div>

<br/>
I got so excited when I read this, because it is what I have been finding in my own process lately as well.<br/>
I start to compose an email to the group (usually in my head) - and the act of having to be very clear, very honest, and mindful of what I say and how I frame what I am asking is what helps me discover the answer, and different options I have for moving forward. <br/>
<br/>
I noticed when I read what you wrote, that I have been mentally composing emails much less, and instead, slowing down, breathing, and being clear and honest with myself first, before thinking that only people outside my home could have the answer.  I think that&#39;s growth.<br/>
<br/>
As being honest and mindful and calm becomes more immediate for me, it&#39;s become easier to focus more on my family, to see them and what they need clearly, and then the next right thing to do flows much more quickly and effortlessly to mind. And then doing that thing is a pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I still need help, then I can ask for it.<br/>
<br/>
I so so appreciate all the wisdom, patience, and generosity of spirit I have found here.<br/>

<br/>
Very much so.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Shira, and Lisa, for describing the phase in which you think of what to write and then think of what might be written by others.  I&#39;ve heard this described many times over the years, but never as well as here this week.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes. :-)<br/>
With &quot;make the better choice,&quot; the quality of the options gradually is raised far and away from the original starting-place options.  <br/>
<br/>
Some years back, someone was angry with this same sort of request to be clear and careful and on topic.  She wrote:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I read your entire website before I subscribed to the list. If all you can do is refer people to read more material – you cannot help me. If I wanted to read more about unschooling information I would buy a book. I have read everything I could get a hold of. What I need is rewording of everyday situations. ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the rest is here, the second item. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/feedback/rude">http://sandradodd.com/feedback/rude</a> She cursed me and my family, but I think by any measure my family was better off that day, and probably is better off now, than  when that was written.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In e-mail on the side, today, I got this:<br/>
<br/>
________<br/>
I&#39;m catching up on my emails and just read your post (see below).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s beautiful - what you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
I remember feeling like [that mom, with my child]. Every word you wrote was helpful. I especially loved this part: &quot;If you spin and spin in fear and panic and you can&#39;t think because you&#39;re afraid, then she&#39;s all alone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy I&#39;m not in that mental space anymore. I did a lot of work to get myself out of there. But I feel like Always Learning (and especially your writing/advice) was like the grease that helped me keep my wheels moving to get out of that space and stay out.<br/>
______________<br/>
<br/>
Some people come to this discussion, get what they need, and go on to live better without leaving a note.  That&#39;s fine. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Some flail and resist and complain and go away angry.<br/>
<br/>
Some flail and resist and complain and get pissed off, and then calm down and live better lives.<br/>
<br/>
Some stay and help others get it. <br/>
<br/>
Any of that is fine.  My kids are grown and whole and good.  I&#39;m grateful that they all lived and that I lived long enough to see them grown.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t expect to still be helping other unschoolers, but it&#39;s satisfying to have found a way to help improve the world, and I plan to keep doing this—helping people directly, if they come and ask—until I don&#39;t feel like it, or I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the positive feedback.  It might tip an undecided reader toward peace and calm.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484769731"><html><head></head>
 
<div dir="ltr">
<div style="FONT-SIZE:12pt;FONT-FAMILY:'Calibri';COLOR:#000000;">
<div>Dylan was a little like Karen’s Ethan. I could usually save just the labels 
from cans, and sometimes cut out portions of cereal boxes or cracker boxes. 
There was no urgency because most things went into bins to be recycled and sat 
around for a month until we went to the recycling center.&nbsp; That wasn’t 
troubling because I often saved pretty labels or wrappers and used them in 
journals or projects, so saving appealing things seemed normal to me.&nbsp; He 
especially liked six pack rings and used dryer sheets and saved them all. But 
those things were incorporated into games he played. Dryer sheets were the silk 
Mothra’s babies sprayed on enemies, or they were force fields, or a snowy 
mountainside. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was hand washing. Like Alex I tried to provide mild soap and soft 
towels. He wouldn’t use creams or lotions, they only made him feel he needed to 
wash his hands more. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And there was straightening of untidy stacks of cards or papers or books. I 
had a friend was very sure Dylan had OCD. She would come play cards with us 
sometimes and she would ask him questions like, “What do you feel will happen if 
you don’t straighten those cards.” His answer was always some version of 
“They’ll be crooked.”&nbsp; It probably amused me more than it should have. She 
so wanted him to say his family would be in some dire peril if those cards 
weren’t put just so.&nbsp; He liked to order the knives and forks and spoons in 
the drawer. He liked arranging the food storage bags and foil and parchment 
paper. I didn’t mind. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He was already quirky. He wore some of his clothes inside out because he 
hated feeling the seams. Certain kinds of lights in certain stores bothered him. 
Loud noise bothered him. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But about the hand washing, I think his skin felt weird. A few years later 
he was diagnosed with psoriasis. I think he was very sensitive to the oil in his 
skin and so his hands felt dirty. In retrospect I probably shouldn’t have been 
providing mild, moisturizing soaps, but Dawn dishwashing liquid... something 
that would have felt like it got rid of the oil. I think he would have washed 
less. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Those were kind of hard times, my dad was dying and we were caring for him. 
Everyone one in Dylan’s life was a little sad and worried. I think the stress 
made his (at the time unknown) psoriasis a little worse and the hand washing was 
a way to manage weird feeling skin. <br><br>I’m not suggesting every frequent 
hand washer has a skin disease. Only that there are more possibilities than an 
anxiety disorder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I think adults have a pretty narrow window of what normal is and anything 
outside that window becomes a disorder or syndrome. I think our window could be 
bigger. I think kids very often have reasons for behaviors that adults don’t see 
any point in.&nbsp; And it’s harder for kids who aren’t really sure how to 
explain how they feel or what they’re experiencing.&nbsp; I would be very 
careful about assuming a psychological problem in someone so young.&nbsp; I 
would default to all other possibilities first, and one would be that just 
because I didn’t understand it, didn’t necessarily make it outside the window of 
normal. Children’s lives are so scrutinized. There is nothing they can do that’s 
private. Adults aren’t constantly judged on their little weirdnesses, in part 
because they’re not being watched and assessed all the time.&nbsp; Parent’s just 
aren’t as intimately aware of the quirks and private habits of their adult 
friends, nor do they feel any special right or responsibility to fix them.&nbsp; 
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dylan is still a frequent hand washer but the very up side to that is that 
he is never sick. He doesn’t care about knives being properly aligned or stacks 
of cards being perfect, and he wears all his clothes the right way. <br><br>Deb 
Lewis</div></div></div></html></div>
