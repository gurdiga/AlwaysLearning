<div id="ygrps-yiv-206069700">That bastion of the English language, the ultimate authority of  <br/>
English word usage, currently at 20 volumes, the Oxford English  <br/>
Dictionary will no longer be printed.<br/>
<br/>
It will only exist on line.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an article in the NYTimes:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5utjba">http://tinyurl.com/5utjba</a><br/>
<br/>
(You&#39;ll need to register to see it.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved my Roget&#39;s Thesaurus for years. Not one of those  <br/>
dictionary ones. The ones that categories words by meaning. The ones  <br/>
with an index in the back where you alphabetically look up your word  <br/>
then scan down through related words to find the number where the  <br/>
full entry for that word is. It involves lots of flipping back and  <br/>
forth from index to entries to find that exact right shade of  <br/>
meaning. Highly superior to dictionary thesauruses which are for word  <br/>
peons.<br/>
<br/>
I think I used it once last year. It&#39;s just so much easier to right  <br/>
click on a word and choose Thesaurus.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the last time I used a print dictionary. It&#39;s gotten  <br/>
to the point where the only time a print dictionary was used was for  <br/>
games since the computer was upstairs and the games downstairs. Now I  <br/>
have a laptop and the last time we played Quiddler -- a word card  <br/>
game -- I looked up questionable words on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
See, now I even have to qualify dictionary with &quot;print&quot;. There&#39;s a  <br/>
word for that phenomenon where the word for a common object needs  <br/>
modified because the word is being used for something else, eg, watch  <br/>
used to mean what we now call pocket watch. And I bet a few minutes  <br/>
search online and I&#39;ll find it.<br/>
<br/>
(Yes: Retronym (just coined in 1980 BTW, ironically in the NY Times)  <br/>
with some more examples: guitar used to mean exclusively acoustic  <br/>
guitar, The Great War was renamed World War 1, talkies became films  <br/>
and films became silent films, clock gets distinguished as analog or  <br/>
digital, rotary phone.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve even found myself getting annoyed with non-fiction print books  <br/>
because they don&#39;t have a search feature.<br/>
<br/>
The dictionary on my new Mac has an option to look up words on  <br/>
Wikipedia.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, the NY Times puts out daily email of headlines -- which is  <br/>
where I saw that article -- that I&#39;ve been reading for years even as  <br/>
I&#39;ve pared so much stuff down that I don&#39;t have time for:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/regi">http://www.nytimes.com/regi</a><br/>
<br/>
With that and 3 minutes of time a day I don&#39;t get that deer in the  <br/>
headlights look when someone mentions some current happening in the  <br/>
world ;-)</div>

<br/>
Last winter I had weekly discussions for some SCA friends, at my   <br/>
house.  A couple of times we looked things up in the OED, and a  <br/>
couple of times in the American Heritage.   Once when a laptop- <br/>
attached friend of ours was there (to say &quot;with his laptop&quot; would be  <br/>
totally redundant to those who know him), he looked things up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One week we were going to talk about &quot;games&quot; and &quot;playing.&quot;  I don&#39;t  <br/>
have OED access.  A friend who works at the university does, so I  <br/>
asked her to send me the OED entries on &quot;play&quot; and &quot;game.&quot;  She did.   <br/>
I opened &quot;play&quot; and hit print and left the room. IT WAS 80 PAGES!!!!   <br/>
That&#39;s crazy.  I didn&#39;t print &quot;game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Years back I re-upped for paperback of the month club because they  <br/>
promised online access to the OED, but it never did work with my Mac  <br/>
on dial-up at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be glad when it&#39;s freely available to people someday.  I guess I  <br/>
could take classes at the university to get access that way.<br/>

That is sad news. I use my dictionary often-much quicker and easier than  <br/>
using one online. It also has bonuses I can&#39;t get from online dictionaries, like  <br/>
finding new words on the same page or nearby pages of the word I was <br/>
originally  looking up. There have been many, many times when a quick definition check <br/>
has  turned into 15, 20 even 30 minutes of adventuring through the  <br/>
dictionary. Dictionary games with my dad are my first memories of  learning outside of <br/>
school and learning being so much fun. Bummer. I  guess I&#39;d better go out and <br/>
get a good one before they&#39;re all gone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765268845">Hi. I just joined. I have a three year old and just started reading <br/>
John Holt this week and had to find an outlet for my enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, did  I feel like I came to the right place when I saw a post <br/>
mourning the print OED. I love the OED! I have the two volume version, <br/>
but nothing beats the complete ones with all the etylomology in <br/>
libraries. It was always the starting point for me whenever I would <br/>
parse poems in college or grad school. Looking up a word in the OED is <br/>
a lovely rabbit hole you could be lost in forever.</div>
