just big enough to bury the pet. In New England you don&#39;t dig unless  <br/>
you really really have to. The rock walls everywhere around here  <br/>
aren&#39;t just quaint. They&#39;re built from what the farmers dug up every  <br/>
time they plowed the fields.<br/>

Sports games: soccer, home run derby.  They are very useful when they are on your team and you can have as many as you want.  If the ball landed in the hole, it might be a goal or a perfectly trapped ball by my ghost man.  Or I might do a World Cup quality fake around the hole and pass the ball to the tree for the perfect give and go.  <br/>

When he digs a big hole all of Molly&#39;s chickens follow him around looking<br/>

Our house was built in the 1880&#39;s, and they must have dug pits in the<br/>

broken china from the 19th century, hatpins, toy metal cars that look like<br/>

<br/>
This is the kind of answer I expected (except the 4-1700 ft answer,  <br/>
which I figure involves a typo).<br/>
Joyce&#39;s was the kind I expected.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know what will happen if you ask a bunch of unschoolers about  <br/>
holes in back yards.  They&#39;ll respond with cool things to do with  <br/>
holes that are already dug!<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s assume the hole isn&#39;t there, but the shovel and the ground are.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give a few examples from families I knew.  At my house, about a  <br/>
foot down the ground was cool.  There might be worms.  There might be  <br/>
a &quot;child of the earth&quot; (looks like a glow-in-the-dark cootie from the  <br/>
&quot;Cootie&quot; game) if you dig deep enough.  They come out clean.<br/>
<br/>
My cousins in Amarillo would have been spanked and grounded if they  <br/>
had dug in their back yard.  It was totally landscaped. They were made  <br/>
to pull weeds until the lawn was perfect before they could go and do  <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Debbie wouldn&#39;t have been digging in her back yard because  <br/>
she trained horses.  So that would&#39;ve been another &quot;Don&#39;t even think  <br/>
about it.&quot;  It&#39;s not worth laming a horse.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend named Hamilton who grew up in an apartment in double  <br/>
digits, in Manhattan.   No yard.  His mom took him and his sister on a  <br/>
picnic in New Jersey once.  Two hours on public transportation each  <br/>
way.  He never dug a hole in the ground until he was a grown man.<br/>
<br/>
I worked with a man who owned land in Mississippi--Mr. Thompson, a  <br/>
math teacher.   It was a farm he had inherited from his dad, who had  <br/>
been a sharecropper, I think, but bought the land eventually.   I  <br/>
asked if he had ever gone into a storm cellar to escape a hurricane.   <br/>
He laughed and said they don&#39;t have storm cellars there--that if you  <br/>
dig a hole, it fills up with water.  And it turns out that&#39;s what he  <br/>
was doing with his farm, too--raising catfish.  They dug ponds and  <br/>
were breeding fish to sell to restaurants.  But he was living in  <br/>
northern New Mexico and other relatives were doing that fish business.<br/>

Our house has only been here since the 1970&#39;s, but I was digging in  <br/>
the side yard and found LOTS of nails and other construction scrap,  <br/>
and a Monopoly marker (the shoe) and a green Monopoly house. That side  <br/>
of the yard is hard to dig in, because it&#39;s very gravelly.  Before  <br/>
there were houses here, the part that became our yard used to be the  <br/>
arroyo, the drainage, so we have way more gravel in our yard than the  <br/>
neighbors so, but gradually I&#39;m working through some of that,  <br/>
replacing it with compost and planting things.  For this part of town,  <br/>
our yard is very green and shady in the summer!<br/>

<br/>
The holes were there for months as the boys worked on their zany buildings and bridges, dams, decorations and whatever they thought of and I just walked around them and made sure to carry a torch if I ventured into the back yard after dark.

When I was a kid, my dad dug a hole in the yard about the size of a swimming <br/>
pool and concreted it.  The concrete wasn&#39;t thick enough though, and it <br/>
eventually cracked and didn&#39;t hold water.  My sister and I LOVED to play in <br/>
there, affectionatly named &#39;the hole&#39;.  We dug holes in the walls, caves and <br/>
tunnels, and played with our my little ponies in it.  When it rained, and it <br/>
filled up with water temporarily, we made boats out of old containers and <br/>
sticks and sailed them in there.  Our toys had some great adventures.<br/>

children make &#39;dinosaur poo&#39; there, and sometimes they fill it with water<br/>
and play with plastic dinosaurs, and sometimes the older girls dig it a bit<br/>
deeper to &#39;mine&#39; for lumps of chalk. We had a huge pit in our last garden<br/>
too, which they and their friends dug just for the sake of digging, or there<br/>
might have been treasure maps involved sometimes. It&#39;s very heavy clay soil<br/>
with loads of flint and chalk, so not too easy to dig in.<br/>
<br/>
In my parents&#39; garden we used to find Roman nails and bits of melted glass<br/>
and misshapen beads, from the Roman kilns which were built to produce goods<br/>
for the mansion down in the valley. We keep hoping to find things like that<br/>
in our current garden which is close to my parents&#39; but so far have had no<br/>
luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785258963">According to the guy who dug a hole for the foundation for a kitchen extension in my back yard when I was 9 or 10, you just miss burrowing Chinamen. Behind the garage was where my gang and I would dig holes and bury birds and other dead animals in religious ceremonies, I usually performed the rituals, being the only Unitarian in a neighbourhood of Catholics I clearly had the experience and training in rituals and mass. The ground behind the garage was great for that because my parents had dug holes there earlier for a compost pile, nice and soft and occasionally potato peel-y. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know for Simon and Linnaea. We&#39;ve dug a hole and buried a cat, we&#39;ve dug lots of holes to plant things. They aren&#39;t active hole diggers. The dog digs holes occasionally and gets told off. There are bees making a hive underground on the patio where the crazy paving has big enough cracks to access the sandy soil underneath, unfortunately for them it is right where the hot tub will drain, I may try and build a dam to protect them before draining the hot tub. <br/>

In our back yard, you&#39;ll first hit granite, then a thin vein of uranium, and then, after 4-1700 ft of dirt, the aquifer.  (In our back yard, probably 7-30ft to the aquifer).<br/>

<br/>
Part of the year the ground is frozen so if you want to dig you build a smoldery fire and feed it for hours.   Then, move the coals and dig a bit and then put the coals back and feed them and do that until you get past the frost.   <br/>
<br/>
There are rocks and boulders for the first two feet or so, a little bit of sandy dirt mixed in, then three inches of clay.   When we dug  holes for fence posts, just past the clay we found a layer of charred wood from some ancient fire.    It was fantastic, we used it to make cave drawings on our basement walls. <br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was little we had a big hole by the vegetable garden that was sometimes a lake (when filled with rain water or water from the hose) or burrow that monsters emerged from when it was time to destroy Tokyo. <br/>

<br/>
We have an area of our back garden (about a quarter of the total) that has been variously a river-water-run, a dino park, Kenya etc etc. We live in a terraced house in a city and our elderly next-door neighbours have been surprisingly delighted by our sons&#39; outdoor exploits, despite the fact that this area borders their own garden and is in full view from their property. I had worried that they would consider us to be lowering the tone of the neighbourhood but instead they talk fondly of all the freeplay they had as kids, although in their day it was in woods etc because every inch of garden was for grown ups stuff like a neat lawn or vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of children around here have neither the freedom to play outside nor to dig up their own back gardens.<br/>

<br/>
First our pet rabbit who lived free in our back yard was put in the hole to see the various ways he got out of the hole.  Then he decided to stay in the hole and build a system of tunnels under our back yard.    These tunnels because unuseable in the summer because we lined the hole with tarps and filled it with water to make a pool.  we also fashioned a slide for the pool.  then after a few years we got tired of it, filled it back up and planted grass over it.<br/>

We have a big hole we left there that Marty and a friend of his dug 11  <br/>
or 12 years ago.  When we have parties we mark it off.  On Sunday a  <br/>
four year old girl was here and jumped down in it to play.  When I  <br/>
drain the hot tub, the first clean 450 gallons goes onto plants and  <br/>
trees in the yard, and the last part that ends up having 409 or bleach  <br/>
or dish soap in it (I use different things depending what kind of  <br/>
dirty it seems or how long since bleach), that goes in &quot;Marty&#39;s  <br/>
hole.&quot;  Keith figures we should save the hole to bury our dog  <br/>
someday.  She&#39;s pretty big.<br/>

melted glass<br/>

goods<br/>

that<br/>
in our current garden which is close to my parents&#39; but so far have  <br/>
had no<br/>
luck.-=-<br/>

I was kinda hoping someone would say &quot;Time Team might come.&quot;  In the  <br/>
U.K. there&#39;s a TV show where archeologists dig where people have found  <br/>
interesting things.   It&#39;s hosted by Tony Robinson who played Baldrick  <br/>

It depends on if it had been pre-fire, or now post-fire.<br/>
<br/>
On May 10th, 10 years ago, we lost our home in the Cerro Grande wildfire, along with about 400 of our neighbors: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Lessons-from-a-fire">http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Lessons-from-a-fire</a><br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s my father-in-law and our rebuilt house directly behind him; he built our house and his house, which are side-by-side. They are huge supporters of our choice to Unschool.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a picture of our lot (2nd one up from the bottom) immediately after the fire. The building was a quadruplex--a 4-unit house: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.life.com/image/1416293">http://www.life.com/image/1416293</a><br/>
<br/>
Pre-fire, you would found bedrock, welded volcanic ash called Tuff, and some old army-men, marbles, lost pieces of metal toys.<br/>
<br/>
Post-fire, we find melted and re-hardened pieces of glass, china, ceramics, metal, plastic, and various burned unknowns, and worms.  Every now and then we find intact marbles that burned and shattered on the inside, but are still smooth and round on the outside. <br/>
<br/>
Our lot was cleared of burned debris, and portions of the yard were filled with dirt from Espanola (it was free, and full of of sun-spider eggs, which never lived here before the fire, but are ubiquitous now.) Now, when we dig a hole, we plant in it.</div>

The landscape makes for some fun outdoor adventures, though...huge downed logs over run-off streams make great bridges.</div>

<br/>
Last time we went to the home improvement store my 6 year old asked for a new shovel because his had been broken. We got a shovel for him and a rake for my youngest. The shovel and rake are left out in the yard to be used. Currently, they are working on a hole next to the house. It&#39;s mostly sand. They found a frog while digging there that my 6 year old decided to adopt. That led to making a pool for the frog in the empty sandbox and trying to use an old dog food dish table for another habitat for the frog. I was assigned with trying to catch flies for the frog to eat. I wasn&#39;t very successful at that. :) <br/>
