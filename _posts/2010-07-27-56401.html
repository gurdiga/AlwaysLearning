what does &quot;radical unschooling&quot; mean to you?<br/>

&quot;Radical unschooling means going against the grain and fighting social  <br/>

<br/>
It seems tiring and negative and scary and isolating.  The children in  <br/>
that family are young.  That means a dozen or fifteen years MORE of  <br/>
going against the grain and fighting social norms.<br/>
<br/>
One of the questions I&#39;m going to be asked in an interview (video, at  <br/>
HSC in August) is, in part, about when I started unschooling:   <br/>
&quot;...what resources were out there? Did you feel isolated and  <br/>
unsupported?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t feel isolated.  I don&#39;t want anyone to feel isolated.  One  <br/>
thing that might help is encouraging people to see unschooling in a  <br/>
soft, positive, gradual-growth way rather than a sudden jump behind  <br/>
sandbag barriers in opposition to society and tradition.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t have to be about society at all. Some people&#39;s<br/>
interaction with life is a big focus on society and they&#39;re likely to<br/>
notice how unschooling is different from many things in mainstream<br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
The same thing is true of religion or sexuality or whatever. It&#39;s<br/>
possible to view one&#39;s religion as a personal spirituality only or how<br/>
it works in society OR as a combination of both (either strictly or<br/>
just somewhat).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;a sudden jump behind sandbag barriers&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling as war seems more than a little anticlimactic to me. To<br/>
learn all the wonderful ways it&#39;s possible to open the world to a<br/>
child to learn from and then it seems one must avoid a great deal of<br/>
the world after all? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing local homeschooling laws and expectations can help with<br/>
unschooling confidently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES. I love that you said this. I haven&#39;t been able to articulate this, <br/>
even to myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am a suburban Southern Californian hippy/surfer girl who got an <br/>
advanced degree in econometrics when there were probably only about a <br/>
dozen other females in the field, changed my religion (to Baha&#39;i), <br/>
married an Iranian refugee, quit a high-paying job where I was on track <br/>
to become one of the first female officers in a company that was the <br/>
largest employer in Southern California, and didn&#39;t send my kids to <br/>
school and, what&#39;s more, didn&#39;t even school them at home.<br/>
<br/>
With all that - I was truly taken by surprise, one day, when Sandra <br/>
called me unconventional. I don&#39;t feel anti-society in the slightest. I <br/>
don&#39;t feel like I am &quot;fighting &#39;The Man&#39;&quot; or &quot;The Establishment&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Corporate America.&quot; Nothing like that. I&#39;m making my own individual <br/>
choices for completely personal reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Well - as soon as I wrote that I thought - &quot;Uh-uh - not so true.&quot; I made <br/>
the choice to get my degrees in economics under the strong influence of <br/>
the women&#39;s movement with the idea of breaking into a completely <br/>
male-dominated field and not at all out of any passion or even real <br/>
satisfaction in the subject or work itself.   And that&#39;s the one <br/>
decision I have regrets about, too.<br/>
<br/>
Living &quot;against&quot; something is negative by definition. Negativity isn&#39;t <br/>
conducive to a happy life with children.<br/>

<br/>
It seems to me, that this is an aspect that turns some men off, when it comes to <br/>
unschooling.  Some men, partners and fathers, would like to be &quot;normal&quot;, they&#39;d <br/>
like to have kids that won&#39;t be weirdos, they don&#39;t want to go against the <br/>
grain.  Even my artsy, musical husband was a bit that way at first.  Standing <br/>
out isn&#39;t something that everyone strives for.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to blend in a bit.  My teenage daughter makes it hard to blend in, <br/>
while in public, hanging out together.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think of unschooling as going with what works the most peacefully, not <br/>
going against things.<br/>

Me too!<br/>
<br/>
And I think unschooling families should be a part of the world, not  <br/>
&quot;apart from&quot; the world.<br/>
