<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713578168">This is the counterpoint to my other post.<br/>
The coolest thing is that Julian and I went to his Movie Premier!<br/>
Last October I had read about a film maker, Andrew Mudge, who was looking for <br/>
kids to be in his movie, The Perfect Gooseys, mostly as extras. Julian got to <br/>
do it. Mudge&#39;s previous film had been accepted to the Sundance Film Festival. <br/>
This one was just screened at the Telluride Film Festival (and will be in a <br/>
bunch of other ones too. He missed the deadline for this year&#39;s Sundance, and <br/>
is hoping for next year.)<br/>
<br/>
This week they had a premiere of the movie in the Boston area!  You can see <br/>
Julian three different times (once from behind, running down a hill), <br/>
including singing, twice!  They also had a DVD for sale, so we got that.<br/>
<br/>
So...my son is a movie star! <br/>

available at the SC conference?I could bring the DVD. (The movie is only 17 <br/>
minutes long) I&#39;ll have to make sure it&#39;s okay with Juls, but I suspect he&#39;d <br/>
say yes.<br/>
