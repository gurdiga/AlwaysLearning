<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094340012">This is a work in progress I think you should all know about.<br/>
It&#39;s a map of inclusive/natural learning support groups from all over the <br/>
WORLD, the first time anyone has done this.<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll all check it out and email him if you know of any groups that <br/>
meet the criteria that aren&#39;t listed.<br/>
I&#39;m the U.S. contact person, which is scary and exciting.<br/>

Save it to faves and pass it on to everyone you know!<br/>
