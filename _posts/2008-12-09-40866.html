unless we all speak up! Don&#39;t let the government prevent us from<br/>
having access to safe toys, carriers and clothes for our children and<br/>
put countless small American toy and baby product makers out of<br/>
business. Many safe European toy companies such as Selecta and Kathe<br/>
Kruse have already begun to make plans to stop selling their toys in<br/>
the U.S. Don&#39;t allow the big toy companies to dominate the market with<br/>
all their Chinese made toys. Please if you care about the products<br/>
that we have available to us then read the following information,<br/>
spread the word NOW, and contact your Representative and<br/>
Congressperson. Don&#39;t don&#39;t wait this needs to be done immediately as<br/>
they are meeting to finalize this week.<br/>
<br/>
Help Save Handmade Toys in the USA from the CPSIA<br/>
The issue:<br/>
In 2007, large toy manufacturers who outsource their production to<br/>
China and other developing countries violated the public&#39;s trust. They<br/>
were selling toys with dangerously high lead content, toys with unsafe<br/>
small part, toys with improperly secured and easily swallowed small<br/>
magnets, and toys made from chemicals that made kids sick. Almost<br/>
every problem toy in 2007 was made in China.<br/>
<br/>
The United States Congress rightly recognized that the Consumer<br/>
Products Safety Commission (CPSC) lacked the authority and staffing to<br/>
prevent dangerous toys from being imported into the US. So, they<br/>
passed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cpsc.gov/ABOUT/Cpsia/cpsia.htmlin">http://www.cpsc.gov/ABOUT/Cpsia/cpsia.htmlin</a> August, 2008. Among<br/>
other things, the CPSIA bans lead and phthalates in toys, mandates<br/>
third-party testing and certification for all toys and requires toy<br/>
makers to permanently label each toy with a date and batch number.<br/>
<br/>
All of these changes will be fairly easy for large, multinational toy<br/>
manufacturers to comply with. Large manufacturers who make thousands<br/>
of units of each toy have very little incremental cost to pay for<br/>
testing and update their molds to include batch labels.<br/>
<br/>
For small American, Canadian, and European toymakers, however, the<br/>
costs of mandatroy testing will likely drive them out of business.<br/>
<br/>
* A toymaker, for example, who makes wooden cars in his garage in<br/>
Maine to supplement his income cannot afford the $4,000 fee per toy<br/>
that testing labs are charging to assure compliance with the CPSIA.<br/>
* A work at home mom in Minnesota who makes dolls to sell at craft<br/>
fairs must choose either to violate the law or cease operations.<br/>
* A small toy retailer in Vermont who imports wooden toys from<br/>
Europe, which has long had stringent toy safety standards, must now<br/>
pay for testing on every toy they import.<br/>
* And even the handful of larger toy makers who still employ<br/>
workers in the United States face increased costs to comply with the<br/>
CPSIA, even though American-made toys had nothing to do with the toy<br/>
safety problems of 2007.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The CPSIA simply forgot to exclude the class of toys that have earned<br/>
and kept the public&#39;s trust: Toys made in the US, Canada, and Europe.<br/>
The result, unless the law is modified, is that handmade toys will no<br/>
longer be legal in the US.<br/>
<br/>
If this law had been applied to the food industry, every farmers<br/>
market in the country would be forced to close while Kraft and Dole<br/>
prospered.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;d appreciate it if it&#39;s not discussed here.  It&#39;s not about my  <br/>
belief in toys or imports or government, it&#39;s about my belief about  <br/>
keeping this list on the topic of unschooling.  Occasionally we stray  <br/>
a little bit, naturally, but this is a huge leap into political  <br/>
action and this is not that kind of list.<br/>

wasn&#39;t trying to spam the list with political issues, I am just<br/>
worried for the safety of our kids, as well as for many unschooling<br/>
families who have these types of businesses in their homes thus<br/>
allowing for them to continue keeping their kids at home. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very sorry and won&#39;t post again about it again:( Thanks for<br/>
clarifying here which is something I asked about in the email but<br/>
didn&#39;t see until now. <br/>
