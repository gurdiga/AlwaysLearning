<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882484765">I have this book that LeaAnn loaned me, her dd needed it for a college <br/>
course. It&#39;s a congolmeration of studies done on homeschoolers, I&#39;m sure it <br/>
would work well for backing up any point you wanted to make on the structured <br/>
end.<br/>
So far, what I&#39;ve read is about structured and semi-structured homeschoolers. <br/>
But it&#39;s actuall studies and very scientific sounding.<br/>
It&#39;s one of the Peabody Journal of Education issues, you are probably <br/>
familiar with those?<br/>
This one is Volume 75, numbers 1 & 2, 2000<br/>
&quot;The Home Education Movement in Context, Practice, and Theory&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I bet it would help if you needed to provide footnotes for any comments in <br/>
the article.....if you want me to look up stuff in it, let me know.<br/>
Or I could loan it to ya! I&#39;m sure LeaAnn won&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
