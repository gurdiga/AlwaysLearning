I might never catch up with e-mail, but we had a good time working on  <br/>
this.  Holly will finish it tonight and tomorrow, I think.  She&#39;s off  <br/>
taking her boyfriend from a day&#39;s work at the comic book store to a  <br/>
World of Warcraft raid.  His sister has his car.  She&#39;ll be back.   <br/>
But I&#39;m glad she let me share some of the progress and the plan.<br/>
