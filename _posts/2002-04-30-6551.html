LEVER: The lever is a simple machine made with a bar free to move about a<br/>
fixed point called a fulcrum.<br/>
There are three types of levers.<br/>
<br/>
A first class lever is like a teeter-totter or see-saw. One end will lift an<br/>
object (child) up just as far as the other end is pushed down.<br/>
<br/>
A second class lever is like a wheel barrow. The long handles of a wheel<br/>
barrow are really the long arms of a lever.<br/>
<br/>
A third class lever is like a fishing pole. When the pole is given a tug,<br/>
one<br/>
end stays still but the other end flips in the air catching the fish.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned quite a lot about levers today. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
