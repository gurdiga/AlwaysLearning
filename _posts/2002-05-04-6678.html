<br/>
My former husband did a career in the military.  When we were stationed in <br/>
Okinawa Japan,  my son Shawn was twelve.  The Japanese people liked to use <br/>
American kids in their advertising and commericals.  Shawn was a skateboarder <br/>
and was auditioning for one of these as such.<br/>
<br/>
When he came home from the audition I asked how it went.  He said the woman <br/>
in charge wanted him to come back next week, and bring his blond <br/>
skateboarding friends.  Then he stopped, did a mental inventory, and stated, <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t have any blond skateboarding friends.&quot;  We ran over the list and <br/>
found many nationalities, all of which tended toward dark hair.  In Shawn&#39;s <br/>
mind you were divided only on the basis of do you, or don&#39;t you skateboard!<br/>
<br/>
He was so oblivious to race, that once when he told me his little girlfriend <br/>
was SO short, I asked him if her mom was oriental.  Oh, yes she is, he said, <br/>
surprised at the thought.  The idea of race just didn&#39;t matter or register <br/>
with him at all.<br/>
