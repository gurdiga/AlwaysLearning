<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128926748">&quot;E-mail is like  a prison.<br/>
A prison with no walls, and no toilet.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Quiz game.  Anyone recognize the quote?<br/>
Throw some out for other to see if they can identify.  <br/>
 <br/>
Using google&#39;s fair, I guess.<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s another one:<br/>
 <br/>
We might as well be dead. Do you think death could possibly be a boat?  <br/>
(Spoken on a small ship.)<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no...Death is.... not. Death isn&#39;t. You  take my meaning?<br/>
Death is the ultimate negative. Not-being. You can&#39;t not-be  on boats.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve frequently not been on boats.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no- what  you&#39;ve been is not on boats.<br/>

 &quot;Justice is a knee in the gut from the floor on the chin at night sneaky with a knife brought up down on the magazine of a battleship sandbagged underhanded in the dark without a word of warning. Garroting. That&#39;s what justice is when we&#39;ve all got to be tough enough and rough enough to fight Billy Petrolle. From the hip. Get it?&quot;<br/>
