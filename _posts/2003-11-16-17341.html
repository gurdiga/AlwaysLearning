<div id="ygrps-yiv-818126749">I am so happy to see that Sandra is on this list!  I am a fellow John <br/>
Holt fan, but no less a Sandra Dodd fan.  Any of you who haven&#39;t met <br/>
her or heard her speak are missing out!  I met her and Holly at a <br/>
small conference last year here in Albuquerque when I was first <br/>
introduced to the idea of unschooling.  Our family had been <br/>
unschooling for a year instinctively but had never heard the word!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra offered great support and encouragement, as I was facing a lot <br/>
of pressure from my mother at the time.  I would like to say thank <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, who else is in New Mexico?</div>

Good!<br/>
I&#39;m glad something I said helped.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a small unschooling list set up for New Mexico and southern Colorado. <br/>
 I did the list but was really hoping someone(s) else would have a bout of <br/>
organizational fervor and get us something going locally.  It&#39;s not too late. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t mind more activity on that list a bit, if you&#39;d like to join <br/>
it.   <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolarama@yahoogroups.com">unschoolarama@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Welcome to this list, which is also relatively quiet (but not THAT quiet).<br/>
<br/>
Other more booming-business (and slightly more dangerous) places I post <br/>
regularly are the message board at www.unschooling.com and <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I also have a steadily growing collection of stuff collected in a maze of <br/>
pages which can start here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
or here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life">http://sandradodd.com/life</a><br/>
<br/>
or just sandradodd.com<br/>
<br/>
Those have been fun to do.  They don&#39;t match, and nobody will ever hire me to <br/>
do a webpage for them (good, because I don&#39;t want the responsibility anyway), <br/>
but for lack of flash, they still do have some good information, because I <br/>
try to swipe from the best.   Many of the pages, like reading and math, are <br/>
mostly quotes and articles from other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read e-mail for many hours, having had company (another <br/>
homeschooling family is having marital problems and the kids chose to camp out here for a <br/>
while) and a party Friday night (good party, and exhausting--we played games <br/>
mostly run by Kirby and Marty, though it was an birthday party for an adult <br/>
friend of ours).   So I&#39;ll read more mail and maybe think of something new and <br/>
clever to bring to this list.<br/>

We&#39;re not, but wish we were, miss it every day.  Hunkered down in <br/>
Ohio.  What&#39;s good about Ohio?  Hmmmmmmm?  Besides the long period of <br/>
grey skies, mold and mildew to let, weather that changes radically <br/>
from day to day, moment to moment, no solar snow removal, tornadoes <br/>
(one hit in &#39;99 just blocks from our house turning brick houses into <br/>
brick dust!), floods, streets that wind all over the place (much <br/>
worse than Santa Fe), and that change names every so many blocks to <br/>
be sure you don&#39;t know where you are (no mountains to guide you), and <br/>
Cincinnati being the second most popular place for Dubya to come for <br/>
campaign funding? <br/>
<br/>
Okay.  What&#39;s good about it is a large homeschooling population, of <br/>
all varieties, oodles of great community-based learning resources, <br/>
and dozens of ice surfaces within two hours drive (which is what <br/>
brought us here in the first place).  But we will be back in New <br/>
Mexico!  We have not been won over by the Queen City, far prefer the <br/>
Duke City.  Plan to be back to visit the Appleturkey in March.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410600962">I always think of when I met Sandra and she left some great lasting <br/>
impressions on me too.<br/>
<br/>
I heard Sandra speak at the Bayshore conference in Long Beach, CA. I <br/>
was first impressed with her respectfulness to the kids who asked <br/>
questions. Joylyn&#39;s daughter Lexie was mostly devouring a Harry <br/>
Potter book while Sandra was speaking, but piped up with some <br/>
questions and comments which Sandra addressed without overlooking <br/>
her. I liked that.<br/>
<br/>
Then I remember (everytime I do laundry in fact) her analogy on <br/>
leaving wet clothes in the washing machine. It went something like: <br/>
What happens when you leave wet clothes in the washing machine and <br/>
she answered her own question...nothing...well at my house, that <br/>
is..they are actually pretty dry by the next day. But I hear in <br/>
California they are all smelly the next day and mildew in even more <br/>
humid states. <br/>
<br/>
When I type it all out and re-read it it seems kind of silly, but it <br/>
made me think more deeply on some of my own absolute kind of <br/>
thinking and how there isn&#39;t always one answer or even two. Mostly <br/>
it has made me take my children&#39;s requests more seriously and to <br/>
look at things from their eyes rather then my own. This was/is <br/>
important to me and is a constant internal dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
I just have always liked this line of thinking...more global, not so <br/>
black and white so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, in southwestern Ohio (Cincinnati) they have Seven Hills, little <br/>
hills, intertwined with lots of rivers.  These hills only succeed in <br/>
interrupting one&#39;s view enough so that getting anywhere is a guessing <br/>
game, at best.  Maps sometimes help, but not always.  Whenever we <br/>
start out for somewhere new we say we are going on an &quot;adventure.&quot;  <br/>
That way it doesn&#39;t really matter if we never find what we were <br/>
looking for.  We print out our Yahoo! maps and head out.<br/>
<br/>
After six years here we started off for a new ice rink the other <br/>
night, for figure skating ice, and spent 1-1/2 hours wandering <br/>
around, asking at gas stations and Walgreen&#39;s to no avail.  I mean, <br/>
you&#39;d think it would be hard to hide an ice arena!  But the way the <br/>
roads are designed contributes greatly to the maze effect. Finally we <br/>
arrived near the end of the skate session, frustrated.  One of the <br/>
other moms totally sympathized with us, told us she had done the same <br/>
thing her first time at this huge old arena.  And she had lived here <br/>
all her life!  <br/>
<br/>
At one time Cincinnati was trying to hype having the Olympics here, <br/>
had a big group raising funds to make that happen.  I got wind of <br/>
this and sent off a letter to the editor asking if they were trying <br/>
to start World War III.  There would be so many foreign nationals <br/>
wandering around, unable to find the Olympic venues, or their hotels, <br/>
or restaurants, that surely an international incident would erupt!  <br/>
<br/>
What I have learned is that lots of folks who live here never really <br/>
leave their own little neighborhoods, never venture very far from <br/>
where they feel secure.  That would be like the South Valley folks <br/>
never venturing to Winrock or Corrales folks never leaving the North <br/>
Valley.  As newbies here, and unschoolers, we made a habit of taking <br/>
off on &quot;adventures,&quot; usually with some specific vector in mind, but <br/>
often ending up somewhere else entirely.  Consequently we have <br/>
learned to get around pretty well, better than many locals, at <br/>
least.  And we have discovered lots of neat little hidden resources, <br/>
like the Russian store where one can buy all things Russian, and the <br/>
little Mexican place called Miscellaneous Rodriguez where we can get <br/>
some of our favorite foods.  Or the little tobacco store we stumbled <br/>
on that has great empty wooden cigar boxes for sale for a dollar or <br/>
two for lots of neat projects.  This is great fun when you have the <br/>
time and aren&#39;t worried about getting somewhere for something.  <br/>
Otherwise it is pure aggravation.  I keep seeing Albuquerque as we <br/>
used to come in from the mountains (lived in Cedar Crest for 27 <br/>
years) or as it looks arriving on I-40 from the west.  So much easier <br/>
to get around out there!<br/>

experiment&quot;!  Never know what lethal form of mold or mildew will be <br/>
growing there next morning.  Even hanging clothes out can net strange <br/>
results here.<br/>

I think there are some people like that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard there are people who live in New York City who have never seen the <br/>
Statue of Liberty, and who have never driven a car, and some who&#39;ve never <br/>
even BEEN in a car.<br/>
<br/>
Carlsbad Caverns, I didn&#39;t see until I was 28 or so, and we had relatives in <br/>
Carlsbad we visited.  But they&#39;d all been, and my parents had been, and they <br/>
figured &quot;next time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do my best touristing when I have out of town guests who want to go to <br/>
Santa Fe or see a mountain from the top end. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That view of Albuquerque from Nine Mile Hill, coming in from the West is SUCH <br/>
a welcome sight sometimes.    ANY lights are welcom sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
A week ago Saturday, Keith&#39;s car broke down 6 mile north of Cuba (N.Mex.) <br/>
which is almost to Farmington, which is almost to Utah.   Marty and I left at <br/>
8:30 to pick him up at a convenience store (which was going to close at 10:00).   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t drive so well in the dark, and I was already tired, so I got Marty to <br/>
go with me to keep me awake, even though he was going to miss hanging out <br/>
with his friend Brett to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I nearly hit a deer.<br/>
<br/>
I had written down mile marker 12, and it was 112.   <br/>
<br/>
I was trying not to be a nervous adrenaline-loaded wreck when we found the <br/>
place and Keith was sitting huddled in the cold.  He had walked six miles (in <br/>
his medieval boots) to find a phone.  He hadn&#39;t taken his glasses with him, so <br/>
he couldn&#39;t even buy a newspaper to have something to read.  He had waited two <br/>
and a half hours.  <br/>
<br/>
He drove until Marty had to say &quot;Dad!&quot; to keep him from going off the road. <br/>
That woke me up (and the adrenaline came back) and I chipperly offered to <br/>
drive and let Keith sleep.  He was snoring before I pulled back on the road and <br/>
whispered to Marty &quot;Get me a Dr Pepper.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Even coming in from the north, and getting off at the Tramway exit, I was <br/>
thrilled to see all those too-many lights and roads.<br/>
<br/>
But from the west, the whole town looks like an aerial map and you can just <br/>
point at where you&#39;re headed.   People get used to such things. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My husband worked at the State Pen near Santa Fe and there was many a <br/>
night when he said that whole stretches of that twisty-turny route <br/>
just disappeared.  He&#39;d have no memory of driving them, but somehow <br/>
he always made it home alive.  Nothing short of a miracle after 16-24 <br/>
hour mandatory overtime stints   <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something very hypnotic about driving in NM, perhaps the <br/>
openness.  Here it&#39;s just the opposite.  Every stretch between exits <br/>
is filled with heart-stopping insanity!  Is it any wonder that my 16-<br/>
year-old is vacillating about learning to drive?  We get up early on <br/>
Sunday mornings and head for big parking lots to get her started.  <br/>
But road driving may be best left up to the professionals here.  Let <br/>
them take the risk and the high anxiety.  She wants the freedom, but <br/>
fears the crazy traffic.  She will work it out, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<br/>
 I tried to make light of it when I point it out, but I guess I&#39;ll just have <br/>
to go ahead and say it right out.  <br/>
<br/>
What you basically said was that people in Ohio isolated themselves because <br/>
it was too hard to get around without mountains. I just kinda find this <br/>
attitude arrogant and insulting.  I&#39;m not from Ohio, btw.  <br/>
<br/>
I navigate by bodies of water that I can&#39;t even see 80% of the time and the <br/>
slant of the sun and landmarks that I know, and the direction I just came.  I <br/>
do this in Ohio, Florida, California, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, St. Croix and <br/>
lots of other places and wherever I&#39;ve been.  What if I said, it&#39;s harder to <br/>
do it that way, so I guess that makes people without mountains more adaptive <br/>
and intelligent than people with mountains.  <br/>
<br/>
See how ridiculous that thinking is?  Maybe you should reframe your stance <br/>
about lack of mountains into the attitude that most newcomers and non-natives <br/>
have about their area--that of not understanding how it&#39;s done in the new area <br/>

&lt;&lt; What you basically said was that people in Ohio isolated themselves <br/>
because <br/>
it was too hard to get around without mountains. I just kinda find this <br/>
attitude arrogant and insulting.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are places where people don&#39;t have to drive very far and so they don&#39;t. <br/>
 It would be kinda crazy.<br/>
<br/>
There are places, like New Mexico, where the population is so sparsely spread <br/>
over such a huge area that if you want to do things or get together with <br/>
people, you HAVE to drive a long way, and so people dno&#39;t think it&#39;s that big a <br/>
deal.  <br/>
<br/>
Because people have moved here from other places and commented on it, I know <br/>
it&#39;s unusual in much of the country.<br/>
<br/>
I have to drive three hours to see my sister.  It used to be only two hours.  <br/>
That&#39;s only really two towns away.  We still have to pass through the <br/>
two-hour town now, and we pass through two REALLY small towns, Abiquiu and Tierra <br/>
Amarilla to get to Brazos, which isn&#39;t really a town.<br/>
<br/>
For Thanksgiving we&#39;ll drive four hours to get to Alamogordo.  We won&#39;t pass <br/>
through another large town at all.  Places with one business which might not <br/>
be open.  Corona.  Carizozo.  There are two turns in all that 200+ miles that <br/>
we have to take to get to Alamogordo.<br/>
<br/>
There are places where the road&#39;s high enough you can see the road for 50 <br/>
miles ahead of you.  We can tell we&#39;re making progress because mountains appear, <br/>
loom larger, and eventually disappear behind us.  Otherwise, it&#39;s the same <br/>
barbed wire fences and the same cholla cactus with a few cows and a windmill for <br/>
a long, long time without anything but mountains to break up the monotony.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if I said, it&#39;s harder to <br/>
do it that way, so I guess that makd thing to say, but I doubt people would <br/>
jump on you about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;See how ridiculous that thinking is?  Maybe you should reframe your stance <br/>
about lack of mountains into the attitude that most newcomers and non-natives <br/>
have about their area--that of not understanding how it&#39;s done in the new <br/>
area <br/>
or pining away for the &quot;better&quot; things and ways of home.  Maybe it&#39;s not lack <br/>
of mountains to navigate by, but a natural longing for the familiarity of <br/>
what <br/>
you had, and what was &quot;easier&quot; because you knew it from birth. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could be some ofthose things, but it doesn&#39;t make it ridiculous.  I think it <br/>
was friendly humor rather than serious commentary.<br/>

<br/>
No need to reframe.  It is easier with mountains, at least mountains <br/>
like there are in Albuquerque, where the mountains form a clear <br/>
border to the east rising almost another mile above the city.  So you <br/>
always know where east is.  And they stick up nice and high above <br/>
everything else, since Albuquerque is built on a flood plain.  Plus <br/>
Albuquerque is laid out on a nice grid system with streets labeled by <br/>
quadrants, NE, SE, NW, SW.  Very easy to get around.  In addition the <br/>
normally clear skies allow you to see those mountains 99% of the <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really say why people don&#39;t get around much in Cincinnati.  <br/>
But I meet people all the time who just don&#39;t get far from their home <br/>
turf.  Neighborhoods are very divided here, very separate. And you <br/>
must have a car here, since mass transit is nearly non-existant, and <br/>
grocery stores are not very convenient.  But I do know that streets <br/>
that change names all the time, and lots of missing signs contribute <br/>
to the confusion.   I meet lots of homeschoolers who determine what <br/>
they will do solely on how close it is to home.  Not that I blame <br/>
them because traffic can be a killer around here.  But that is true <br/>
in lots of places. <br/>
<br/>
You said:  &lt;&gt;What you basically said was that people in Ohio isolated <br/>
themselves because it was too hard to get around without mountains. I <br/>
just kinda find this attitude arrogant and insulting.  I&#39;m not from <br/>
Ohio, btw.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do not need other people translating what I said.  I said that *I* <br/>
find it more difficult to get around without mountains.  And without <br/>
a grid system.  And without street signs.  And with streets that <br/>
constantly change names.  What happens to anyone else is not my <br/>
problem, just that people I meet here say they don&#39;t seem to get <br/>
around much here. <br/>
<br/>
You said:  &lt;&gt;What if I said, it&#39;s harder to do it that way, so I <br/>
guess that makes people without mountains more adaptive and <br/>
intelligent than people with mountains.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And you might be right!  At least relating to that particular kind of <br/>
intelligence.  Like rats who run complex mazes.  I simply do not like <br/>
to spend so much of my time figuring out the maze.  I would rather be <br/>
doing other things.  I&#39;m a pretty good navigator.  I have traveled <br/>
around a good percentage of the world and navigated just fine, though <br/>
never by boat, at least not for a long journey.  But I find <br/>
Cincinnati to be one of the most confusing cities.  Could very well <br/>
be my personal failing, for I do prefer mountains.  I also know of <br/>
folks in NYC who found themselves disoriented when the WTC towers <br/>
were gone, because they used them, much like mountains, to help them <br/>
navigate that city.  But I grew up, learned to drive and navigate, in <br/>
Detroit.  And some folks think that is a very difficult city to get <br/>
around.  But it is an auto city, designed for the car.<br/>
<br/>
You transmitted:  &lt;&gt;Maybe you should reframe your stance about lack <br/>
of mountains into the attitude that most newcomers and non-natives <br/>
have about their area--that of not understanding how it&#39;s done in the <br/>
new area or pining away for the &quot;better&quot; things and ways of home.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
New Mexico was &quot;home&quot; for 27 years, but the 26 before that I lived in <br/>
my native state, Michigan.  I navigated just fine there, but still <br/>
prefer Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;Maybe it&#39;s not lack of mountains to navigate by, but a natural <br/>
longing for the familiarity of what you had, and what was &quot;easier&quot; <br/>
because you knew it from birth.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Definitely longing for what was easier.  Why not?  I do not enjoy <br/>
driving around in circles, wasting time and gas, especially at <br/>
today&#39;s gas prices.  Especially at night when &quot;adventuring&quot; can get <br/>
dicey at times.  I just think that Albuquerque, despite its problems, <br/>
is a better planned city.  Cincinnati, a city originally settled by <br/>
carpetbaggers and slave traders and other assorted scoundrels, is on <br/>
the other hand, predominantly controlled by the interests of certain <br/>
corporations whose home offices are located here.  What does and what <br/>
does not happen here is often determined by whether it will serve <br/>
their corporate interests.  And the taxpayers end up paying for it.  <br/>
I know that happens elsewhere, too.  But it is annoying.  Exits on <br/>
the highways are determined by how well they will work for certain <br/>
corporate entities.  If you get off the freeway along certain long <br/>
urban stretches you will not be able to get back on.  Because these <br/>
exits were not designed for anyone else but those who work at or are <br/>
delivering goods to the corporations whose plants are located near <br/>
those exits.  Pity the poor tourist who loops off and then finds him <br/>
or herself wandering around significantly lost. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;See how ridiculous that thinking is?&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One person&#39;s ridiculous is another person&#39;s opus or chef d&#39;oeuvre, <br/>
or, &quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,&quot; <br/>
(Emerson).  To each his or her own.  I don&#39;t feel the need to insult <br/>
anyone to express my opinion.  I like Albuqerque.  It is a friendly <br/>
city, I think.  Cincinnati is, generally, not.  Much more racist, <br/>
very &quot;neighborhood,&quot; very economically segregated.  The terrain here <br/>
and the roads that access it have been designed to keep that kind of <br/>
separation going, most successfully, too.  My opinion.  That&#39;s all.<br/>

Would you mind posting the name and addresses (or at least area of<br/>
Cincinnati) of the Russian store and the tobacco store?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
