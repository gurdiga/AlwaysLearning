   <br/>
  My 8 1/2 and 6 yr. old daughters both love Club penguin.  Another Unschooling family recently reccomended it to us.<br/>
   <br/>
  My daughters club penguin names are : <br/>
  auntiechar ( for the 81/2 yr. old)  and <br/>
  jordanet ( the 6 yr. old) <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love to meet other homeschoolers.  What&#39;s you daughter&#39;s club penguin name?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a 13 yr old stepson who loves Runescape. We don&#39;t limit him - <br/>
but we currently have four people sharing a computer *and* it&#39;s dial-<br/>
up. We&#39;re looking to expand those options, but in the moment we do a <br/>
lot of communicating and looking for solutions that work for <br/>
everyone. One of those solutions has been dss shifting to a more <br/>
nocturnal cycle - its his choice, and one that appeals to him in <br/>
other ways, too (creature of the night and all that). <br/>
<br/>
That involves a bit more planning for some things - today he&#39;s going <br/>
to the skatepark with some friends, so he&#39;s asked me to wake him up <br/>
in time to go do that. I&#39;m also making sure he has &quot;breakfast&quot; that <br/>
he can eat in the car. I&#39;m also working on budgetting my energy <br/>
differently, since he&#39;s waking up around the time I usually start <br/>
lagging :(<br/>
<br/>
What aspects of Runescape appeal to Jonah? Ray loves the social <br/>
aspects. He seems to spend a great deal of time sending and <br/>
receiving messages!<br/>
<br/>
Just as a side note - I know there&#39;s a unschoolers guild for World <br/>
of Warcraft, is there something similar for Runescape? The dial-up <br/>
is keeping us off WoW for now, but I think Ray would enjoy touching <br/>
base with other unschoolers. <br/>

  *****My ds has gotten back into playing Runescape, maybe they can get on each others friends list. We can exchange user id&#39;s privately, that way they can find each other if he wants. <br/>

<br/>
I definitely think it will be easy to find runescape friends.  My 13yo <br/>
ds has gotten away from it a bit due to SW Galaxies but he still <br/>
plays.  We don&#39;t know any other unschoolers but he does have homeschool <br/>
Runescape friends to play with.  Feel free to email us too if you <br/>
want.  Chris<br/>

p.s Since we&#39;re on the topic, are there any Star Wars Galaxies players <br/>
here?</div>
