<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794679687">Hi Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group. In fact I have been a &quot;lurker&quot; over the past few<br/>
weeks.  I live in New Zealand and I still on the verge of fully embracing<br/>
unschooling but feel I am well  on the way.  I know where you are coming<br/>
from as I withdrew my children from ps aged 8 and 6.5.  In NZ children start<br/>
school at 5.  My then 8yo dd was totally demotivated especially about<br/>
reading which she had previuosly enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
After taking lots of advice from a lot of people who home educated -<br/>
unschoolers through to school at homers - I let things be but read all sorts<br/>
of great books to the childen.  I did not ask them to read I just gave them,<br/>
the opportunity to listen and enjoy.  It took a yearto 18mths but I now have<br/>
a daughter who can&#39;t find enough time to erad.  It is her choice and she<br/>
loves it.<br/>
<br/>
With my son we built on interests he had in computer games - not educational<br/>
software but games - he loves Age of Empires and he said he wanted to find<br/>
out more about the Egyptians so I searched out some fun activities about<br/>
Ancient Egypt.  He mummified apples, made clothes and weapons, looked at<br/>
library books and this led to a full blown interest in history.  Right now I<br/>
am reading him a book he found in the adults section of the library about<br/>
Vikings.<br/>
<br/>
We also started music lesson which was a non-school activity which they both<br/>
really enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I have found demonstrating the things I value - finding out new things,<br/>
reading etc in my everyday activities has be a motivator to my children.<br/>
<br/>
Give things time - he will deschool but it may take a year or more to<br/>
happen.  Take advantage of that year to enjoy things together.  Something<br/>
will eventually hit the spot and spark his interest.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ve talked a lot about what he isn&#39;t doing. You haven&#39;t told us anything<br/>
that he is doing.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning doesn&#39;t look like academics. It looks like playing. That&#39;s why<br/>
kids do it :-)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think in terms of field trips. Field trips are for schools. Think<br/>
about fun places to go that you and he might do on a weekend or over the<br/>
summer if you were already confident that the school were handling his<br/>
education. Go for walks. Go shopping and stop and admire his admiration of<br/>
what he calls you to see. Take him to places where he can do the kinds of<br/>
things he enjoys doing (rollerblading, biking, whatever). Go for leisurely<br/>
trips to museums and just look at the stuff *he* wants to.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect he&#39;s picking up the nervousness that&#39;s coming through loud and<br/>
clear in your post. He can feel you hovering over him waiting for him to do<br/>
something that will calm your fears.<br/>
<br/>
Calming your fears isn&#39;t his job. Your fears are your own. His &quot;job&quot; is to<br/>
live the life of an 8 year old. Let him do and be an 8 year old rather than<br/>
a product in preparation for adulthood. Kids spend way too much time<br/>
training to be adults. There&#39;s a reason kids are 8. It&#39;s a stage they need<br/>
to pass through and he only gets one chance at it! He needs to be involved<br/>
in 8 yo things. *His* 8 yo things. Nintendo. TV. Games. Puzzles. Tickling.<br/>
Seeing if he can cram a whole hamburger into his mouth. ;-) Playing with<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t hand him books. Snuggle up on the couch under a quilt and hot<br/>
chocolate and read to him. Put books on tape on in the car. Watch movie<br/>
versions of favorite books and talk about what you liked and didn&#39;t like.<br/>
Your job isn&#39;t to make him read. Your job is to make sure he has pleasurable<br/>
experiences with reading. And has reasons that are meaningful to him to<br/>
read. (Like if he likes to play video games, make sure he has the guides. It<br/>
will be reading for meaning.)<br/>
<br/>
You might try posting your question at the message boards at Unschooling.com<br/>
(http://www.unschooling.com) or on the Unschooling.com email list. (Address<br/>
an email to unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com) There are a lot<br/>
more newbies there and you&#39;re more likely to read about the beginnings of<br/>
unschooling. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22892951">Lisa, <br/>
<br/>
Why do you feel he must do something &quot;academic&quot;? A summer is not nearly long <br/>
enough for him to get his head back on straight. And worrying about whether <br/>
he&#39;s doing &quot;academics&quot; is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We pulled our son out after 6th grade. He floated around here for two <br/>
years---mostly sleeping all day and watching tv and playing on the computer <br/>
(with occasional jaunts on the skateboard &lt;g&gt;). REALLY! He&#39;d go with us to <br/>
the park or the zoo or the museums, but not always. We did send him (by <br/>
himself) to Australia for three weeks and Washington State for four weeks and <br/>
we went on family trips to St Louis, Chicago, New York (2x), MA, CT, PA (2x), <br/>
and Pensacola & Jacksonville, FL. But mostly, he slept a lot and spent time <br/>
in front of the TV or &#39;puter. The only things he read or wrote were IM&#39;s! <br/>
(although I picked up many books I thought might interest him from the <br/>
library and tossed them in his room.)<br/>
<br/>
This past month, he wrote a screenplay (in school, he HATED to read or <br/>
write). He and his friends will begin filming next weekend. He&#39;s learned all <br/>
this on his own. It&#39;s pretty amazing, too, how well-written it is. (He asked <br/>
me to look it over and fix things. He had misused lie/lay, so I corrected <br/>
that.) He had tons of questions about plots and tension and character <br/>
development. He now has tons of questions about lighting and camera <br/>
work/angles and editing (he&#39;s also directing the film).<br/>
<br/>
The film deals with typical teen thoughts: boy/girl relationships, drugs & <br/>
alcohol, differences, and skateboarding &lt;G&gt;---and is sprinkled with music <br/>
(some of which he&#39;s writing, but mostly from bands he likes). Regular stuff: <br/>
sex, drugs and rock & roll!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been an amazing few years watching him lose the school mentality. A lot <br/>
of &quot;veging out&quot;, but he NEEDED that. He&#39;s now waking a bit earlier and <br/>
wanting to go places with us more and more. As I work on this conference, <br/>
he&#39;s taken on almost all of the housework and a lot of the care for his <br/>
little brother---just to help me out. (Only four weeks to go!)<br/>
<br/>
Give your son time to find himself again. Dispense with the academics. Let <br/>
him veg out or pursue an &quot;unacademic&quot; interest. Understand what UNschooling <br/>
really is!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136446523">Hey {{{Lisa}}}<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has never been to school so I can&#39;t tell you about deschooling.<br/>
All I can tell you is I pay attention to what he likes and help him find<br/>
as much of it as he wants.  Lately it&#39;s been insects and doesn&#39;t that<br/>
sound academic?  Also lately he likes to color fuzzy velvet posters.  (No<br/>
Elvis so far) but fuzzy velvet posters don&#39;t sound nearly as academic as<br/>
insects.  And always it is cartoons and Godzilla and X-files, and<br/>
M*A*S*H, and Playstation and Gameboy and Calvin and Hobbs and Peanuts.  <br/>
My point is that we tend to see certain things as learning and other<br/>
things strictly as entertainment.  But I can tell you he&#39;s learned more<br/>
useful things from all that entertainment than he has from being able to<br/>
tell a bee assassin from a milkweed beetle.  That&#39;s cool and impresses<br/>
big people but what he really uses every day is his sense of drama, and<br/>
humor and compassion and  his quick thinking and dexterity and his<br/>
observation skills.  He has an astounding visual memory which helps him<br/>
all the time.  <br/>
Dylan couldn&#39;t sit down and do the multiplication tables like a third<br/>
grader here could do but he can count the money in his wallet and<br/>
determine if there is enough for the things he wants to buy.  He can<br/>
figure how much he&#39;ll have left, how much change he&#39;ll get back, how much<br/>
he needs to save for the next thing.  He plays cribbage with his dad and<br/>
can count by 15&#39;s like nobody business.  He can add his score in Yahtzee<br/>
and that&#39;s because he likes to play.  He&#39;s awsome at SET.  So is he<br/>
behind?  Maybe according to the school but not according to his life. <br/>
What he needs in his real life right now he knows or will know as the<br/>
need arises because he gets to live and use what he learns.  He has never<br/>
encountered a situation in ten years of life that required knowing the<br/>
multiplication tables.    <br/>
<br/>
Why does Nate need to read right now Lisa?  He&#39;s not driving around in<br/>
your car, he&#39;s not going to work, he&#39;s not walking around town by<br/>
himself.   What does he absolutely NEED to read right now that you can&#39;t<br/>
help him with?  <br/>
The only reason kids are forced into reading so early at school is for<br/>
the convenience of the teachers.   No little kid needs to read at six or<br/>
seven or eight or even 10 or 12.   Maybe by the time he wants a job, or<br/>
wants his drivers licence but how far away is that?  In between there is<br/>
so much time to hear wonderful stories and see great movies and play. <br/>
 (And in fact, my husband works with a man who has his high school<br/>
diploma and never learned to read.  He makes an excellent living as an<br/>
equipment operator, he&#39;s better paid than our Mayor,  has a nice home a<br/>
lovely wife and a loyal dog.)<br/>
<br/>
If you start to look at what Nate likes to play as meaningful to his life<br/>
right now you will begin to see a world of learning in it.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to be measured or judged against someone else&#39;s standard, he just<br/>
needs to be a kid and play and have you involved with him.  Just read to<br/>
him when he wants, play with him, take him places he likes to go, tell<br/>
him what a cool kid he is and how much you like to be with him.  Tell him<br/>
everything will be ok.  <br/>
<br/>
You already do lots of cool things with your kids Lisa.  You&#39;re doing ok.<br/>
 It&#39;s probably so much easier for moms whose kids never went to school,<br/>
because we don&#39;t have that idea in our minds about what school would<br/>
expect.   What if Nate just played and healed and found joy in his life<br/>
everyday and knew you were proud of him no matter what?  Would you trade<br/>
that for reading right now?  Which is more important in his life at this<br/>
moment?  <br/>
<br/>
Love & Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127291917">Hi Lisa.  I have two boys (ages 7 adn 11) that I<br/>
pulled out of school at the end of the 2000 school<br/>
year.  My older son, Thomas, was like your 8 year old.<br/>
 Do not panick.  Your son needs to &quot;detox&quot;, and he<br/>
will.  I would totally stop trying to school him for<br/>
quite awhile.  Don&#39;t worry, he will learn.  There are<br/>
also things you can do and he won&#39;t even know he&#39;s<br/>
learning: ask him to help you bake cookies, play fun<br/>
card games with him like &quot;Go Fish&quot; or &quot;War&quot;.  Also,<br/>
read to him if he likes that.  I am still having to<br/>
read to Thomas because he associates reading with<br/>
learning.  He&#39;s getting much better and is reading<br/>
some of his current book, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; by himself.<br/>
 The difference in his attitude this year as opposed<br/>
to last year is amazing.  He is MUCH more positive. <br/>
Hang in there.  He&#39;ll come around.<br/>

the summer my youngest (7) and his grandmother were talking and she asked<br/>
him something about doing multiplication and division (not in a mean,<br/>

but would learn it later. The next day we were at an Arab souk and she was<br/>
trying to figure out how much something cost. He told her to cut the number<br/>
into somewhere between 3 and 4 pieces and then you would know how much in<br/>
dollars -- he then did it for her (the exchange rate is 3.68dhs to the<br/>
USD). Later at home he showed her how to do this exactly with a calculator!<br/>
She cracked up to me because he was so sure he didn&#39;t know that &quot;mathy<br/>
stuff&quot; and yet was able to calculate way beyond most of her kids --she&#39;s a<br/>

Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] deschooling<br/>
 <br/>
Hey {{{Lisa}}}<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has never been to school so I can&#39;t tell you about deschooling.<br/>
All I can tell you is I pay attention to what he likes and help him find<br/>
as much of it as he wants.  Lately it&#39;s been insects and doesn&#39;t that<br/>
sound academic?  Also lately he likes to color fuzzy velvet posters.<br/>
(No<br/>
Elvis so far) but fuzzy velvet posters don&#39;t sound nearly as academic as<br/>
insects.  And always it is cartoons and Godzilla and X-files, and<br/>
M*A*S*H, and Playstation and Gameboy and Calvin and Hobbs and Peanuts.  <br/>
My point is that we tend to see certain things as learning and other<br/>
things strictly as entertainment.  But I can tell you he&#39;s learned more<br/>
useful things from all that entertainment than he has from being able to<br/>
tell a bee assassin from a milkweed beetle.  That&#39;s cool and impresses<br/>
big people but what he really uses every day is his sense of drama, and<br/>
humor and compassion and  his quick thinking and dexterity and his<br/>
observation skills.  He has an astounding visual memory which helps him<br/>
all the time.  <br/>
Dylan couldn&#39;t sit down and do the multiplication tables like a third<br/>
grader here could do but he can count the money in his wallet and<br/>
determine if there is enough for the things he wants to buy.  He can<br/>
figure how much he&#39;ll have left, how much change he&#39;ll get back, how<br/>
much<br/>
he needs to save for the next thing.  He plays cribbage with his dad and<br/>
can count by 15&#39;s like nobody business.  He can add his score in Yahtzee<br/>
and that&#39;s because he likes to play.  He&#39;s awsome at SET.  So is he<br/>
behind?  Maybe according to the school but not according to his life. <br/>
What he needs in his real life right now he knows or will know as the<br/>
need arises because he gets to live and use what he learns.  He has<br/>
never<br/>
encountered a situation in ten years of life that required knowing the<br/>
multiplication tables.    <br/>
<br/>
Why does Nate need to read right now Lisa?  He&#39;s not driving around in<br/>
your car, he&#39;s not going to work, he&#39;s not walking around town by<br/>
himself.   What does he absolutely NEED to read right now that you can&#39;t<br/>
help him with?  <br/>
The only reason kids are forced into reading so early at school is for<br/>
the convenience of the teachers.   No little kid needs to read at six or<br/>
seven or eight or even 10 or 12.   Maybe by the time he wants a job, or<br/>
wants his drivers licence but how far away is that?  In between there is<br/>
so much time to hear wonderful stories and see great movies and play. <br/>
(And in fact, my husband works with a man who has his high school<br/>
diploma and never learned to read.  He makes an excellent living as an<br/>
equipment operator, he&#39;s better paid than our Mayor,  has a nice home a<br/>
lovely wife and a loyal dog.)<br/>
<br/>
If you start to look at what Nate likes to play as meaningful to his<br/>
life<br/>
right now you will begin to see a world of learning in it.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to be measured or judged against someone else&#39;s standard, he just<br/>
needs to be a kid and play and have you involved with him.  Just read to<br/>
him when he wants, play with him, take him places he likes to go, tell<br/>
him what a cool kid he is and how much you like to be with him.  Tell<br/>
him<br/>
everything will be ok.  <br/>
<br/>
You already do lots of cool things with your kids Lisa.  You&#39;re doing<br/>
ok.<br/>
It&#39;s probably so much easier for moms whose kids never went to school,<br/>
because we don&#39;t have that idea in our minds about what school would<br/>
expect.   What if Nate just played and healed and found joy in his life<br/>
everyday and knew you were proud of him no matter what?  Would you trade<br/>
that for reading right now?  Which is more important in his life at this<br/>
moment?  <br/>
<br/>
Love & Peace,<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ve talked a lot about what he isn&#39;t doing. You haven&#39;t told us<br/>
anything<br/>
that he is doing.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning doesn&#39;t look like academics. It looks like playing. That&#39;s<br/>
why<br/>
kids do it :-)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think in terms of field trips. Field trips are for schools. Think<br/>
about fun places to go that you and he might do on a weekend or over the<br/>
summer if you were already confident that the school were handling his<br/>
education. Go for walks. Go shopping and stop and admire his admiration<br/>
of<br/>
what he calls you to see. Take him to places where he can do the kinds<br/>
of<br/>
things he enjoys doing (rollerblading, biking, whatever). Go for<br/>
leisurely<br/>
trips to museums and just look at the stuff *he* wants to.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect he&#39;s picking up the nervousness that&#39;s coming through loud and<br/>
clear in your post. He can feel you hovering over him waiting for him to<br/>
do<br/>
something that will calm your fears.<br/>
<br/>
Calming your fears isn&#39;t his job. Your fears are your own. His &quot;job&quot; is<br/>
to<br/>
live the life of an 8 year old. Let him do and be an 8 year old rather<br/>
than<br/>
a product in preparation for adulthood. Kids spend way too much time<br/>
training to be adults. There&#39;s a reason kids are 8. It&#39;s a stage they<br/>
need<br/>
to pass through and he only gets one chance at it! He needs to be<br/>
involved<br/>
in 8 yo things. *His* 8 yo things. Nintendo. TV. Games. Puzzles.<br/>
Tickling.<br/>
Seeing if he can cram a whole hamburger into his mouth. ;-) Playing with<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t hand him books. Snuggle up on the couch under a quilt and hot<br/>
chocolate and read to him. Put books on tape on in the car. Watch movie<br/>
versions of favorite books and talk about what you liked and didn&#39;t<br/>
like.<br/>
Your job isn&#39;t to make him read. Your job is to make sure he has<br/>
pleasurable<br/>
experiences with reading. And has reasons that are meaningful to him to<br/>
read. (Like if he likes to play video games, make sure he has the<br/>
guides. It<br/>
will be reading for meaning.)<br/>
<br/>
You might try posting your question at the message boards at<br/>
Unschooling.com<br/>
(http://www.unschooling.com) or on the Unschooling.com email list.<br/>
(Address<br/>
an email to unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com) There are a<br/>
lot<br/>
more newbies there and you&#39;re more likely to read about the beginnings<br/>
of<br/>
unschooling. <br/>

<h4>Liza Sabater</h4>
<time>13 Sep 2002, at  8:05am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511888074">Hi Lisa and all,<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking on this list for months now but the coincidence <br/>
of your subject is too big to pass. This month&#39;s HOME EDUCATION <br/>
MAGAZINE has two articles on deschooling: Sandra Dodd&#39;s DESCHOOLING <br/>
FOR PARENTS and my article TAKING THE SCHOOL OUT OF HOMESCHOOL. I do <br/>
not know if it was fate or a coincidence arranged by the editor :-) <br/>
but the main argument in both of our articles is simply this:<br/>
<br/>
It has been argued for many years that children need to decompress or <br/>
deschool after being removed from school in order to clear the path <br/>
to homeschooling or unschooling. Well, children don&#39;t homeschool or <br/>
unschool in a vacuum; they do so after all with their parents. <br/>
Parents need to deschool as much as, if not even more than, their <br/>
children since most have many more years of schooling than their <br/>
brood.<br/>
<br/>
I sent out a questionnaire to about 7 homeschooling and unschooling <br/>
email lists. The response about this topic was overwhelming (I wish I <br/>
had been able to include most of my respondents quotes). From their <br/>
wisdom I got what I call the &quot;The Three Rs&quot; or stages of deschooling:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;RESISTANCE is the stage in which children or parents are opposed to <br/>
&gt;the idea of homeschooling or any learning at all, not because they <br/>
&gt;want to go back to school but because homeschooling is too much like <br/>
&gt;school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>REGROUPING is about backing off and backing down from expectations <br/>
and judgements. It is a time to play, to hang out and to reassess <br/>
priorities. This is the decompression period a lot of homeschoolers <br/>
talk about and which many homeschoolers believe should be one month <br/>
for every year our kids attended school.<br/>
<br/>
RESEARCH comes along with resistance and regrouping: This is the time <br/>
spent immersed in the homeschooling community, meeting and learning <br/>
more about the different styles and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
This last stage I like to think also about it as a time for <br/>
REDISCOVERY in the sense that, through learning more about all the <br/>
options available in homeschooling, both parents and children can <br/>
find new ways of doing what they had thought they could not do or <br/>
were not allowed to do because it was not schooling. So, in a sense, <br/>
by learning about the different ways one can learn through <br/>
homeschooling, hopefully children and parents alike can find the joy <br/>
they lost at school for learning.<br/>
<br/>
The article came after an AHA! moment I had on an email discussion. <br/>
If you take into consideration that my parents sent me to school at <br/>
the age of three and that I had not stopped being in a school setting <br/>
until I quit teaching college and decided not to write a <br/>
dissertation; then that would have made me a SCHOOLER for 27 <br/>
CONSECUTIVE YEARS.<br/>
<br/>
So the issue of DESCHOOLING became very clear to me. My son (who is <br/>
still not of compulsory age) attended nursery schools and pre-k for 2 <br/>
years (he just turned 5). He is an incredibly social child so it took <br/>
him about 6 months to get over the fact that his friends were in <br/>
school and he was not. I, on the other hand, am still getting the <br/>
hang of NOT doing school.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is just 8 years old. I cannot find the links (will post them <br/>
later) of some of the child development researchers who believe they <br/>
can change schools by actually having them throw away academic work <br/>
----or stave it until kids reach the age of 11 or 12. Your son needs <br/>
to play and just be and right now you are still trying to cram things <br/>
down his throat by being worried about his &quot;academic&quot; future.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. isn&#39;t it weird for us to worry about this? Academic <br/>
work is what you do when working in a university and writing a <br/>
thesis. What your son and all children should be doing at the age of <br/>
8 is playing, growing and being because that is the way that most <br/>
mammals, including humans, learn. All this academic poppycock is <br/>
actually stunting children&#39;s, and in the end human, development. <br/>
Sorry about the rant but I get really passionate about this.<br/>
<br/>
You said you did some field trips. I say, do some more. You and your <br/>
guy need to go on some adventures, get away from it all, and <br/>
reconnect as mother and child, as Lisa and Nate, and not as teacher <br/>
and student or &quot;assessor&quot; and &quot;academic achievement grade&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling is going to be a bumpy ride but y&#39;all be fine. You just <br/>
need to find the fun in learning and forget about the &#39;academic work&#39; <br/>
--and when I say you I mean, YOU. Your son said already what he wants <br/>
and how he wants it. Lisa needs to reassess how she wants to help <br/>
Nate accomplish that. I would start with some chamomile tea and a <br/>
bubble bath. Oh, and I rented a whole slew of AbFab and Monty Python <br/>
tapes  --nothing like good ol&#39; brit humor and silliness to put things <br/>
into perspective. Then, do things together. Find things the both of <br/>
you LOVE, not just like but LOVE doing together. Then, hang out some <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792363679">**I recall reading in a Home Education magazine<br/>
that a mom pulled a 9th grader from class and didnt offer anything<br/>
academic for a year.  He was a special needs kid in school and when he<br/>
graduated from home school he went on to go to law school.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known a few people who &quot;succeeded&quot; all the way through law school<br/>
and then discovered that they didn&#39;t like the work they had to do as<br/>
lawyers.  (Does that help any?)<br/>
<br/>
**He said that he could not handled having things crammed down his throat.**<br/>
<br/>
The very beginning of the book The Teenage Liberation Handbook, has a<br/>
long parable comparing school to force feeding cafeteria slop to a kid<br/>
who just wants to graze and eat wonderful fruits and berries.  If you<br/>
can get your hands on a copy of this book, your son might really relate<br/>
to this story and feel understood.<br/>
<br/>
I also like The Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank Smith.  This<br/>
book makes it clear that drilling and trying to memorize stuff that<br/>
doesn&#39;t interest or confuses us is a terrible way to learn and works<br/>
against our natural learning abilities.  (You probably already got that<br/>
idea from How Children Fail.)<br/>
<br/>
I believe that deschooling is important.  Your son probably has mental<br/>
and emotional scars that need to heal.  You don&#39;t want to &quot;poke&quot; him in<br/>
his sore spots.  People say to expect at least a month of deschooling<br/>
for every year that a child was in school or preschool/daycare.  And it<br/>
might take more time if the school experience was especially nasty or<br/>
the child is particularly sensitive.<br/>
<br/>

read  your whole article (or Sandra&#39;s), but that won&#39;t slow me down on<br/>
asking questions.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to ask about helping very new homeschoolers (who may or may not<br/>
be unschoolers) who come to park day with our support group.  Sometimes<br/>
it feels like they are looking for a very complete, turnkey solution. <br/>
They seem to feel uncomfortable with the freedom that they have (if they<br/>
know that they even have it). <br/>
<br/>
Are there ways that your insights about deschooling can be applied to<br/>
how I help new homeschoolers deschool?  Maybe I should get over myself<br/>
and not get sucked into &quot;helping&quot;.  I could just stick with &quot;Nice to<br/>
meet you.  Have a cookie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  <br/>

read  your whole article (or Sandra&#39;s), but that won&#39;t slow me down on<br/>
asking questions.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to ask about helping very new homeschoolers (who may or may not<br/>
be unschoolers) who come to park day with our support group.  Sometimes<br/>
it feels like they are looking for a very complete, turnkey solution. <br/>
They seem to feel uncomfortable with the freedom that they have (if they<br/>
know that they even have it). <br/>
<br/>
Are there ways that your insights about deschooling can be applied to<br/>
how I help new homeschoolers deschool?  Maybe I should get over myself<br/>
and not get sucked into &quot;helping&quot;.  I could just stick with &quot;Nice to<br/>
meet you.  Have a cookie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872418315">Dear Liza:  Thanks.  Nate is growing and changing.  We went to an art<br/>
museum which was free on 9/11 and he actually looked at the paintings<br/>
and some he did for several moments.  Perhaps, I am not putting the<br/>
times table in front of him but subtly I have been pushing him<br/>
academically.  He rebelled and I yelled my head off and when Barry, my<br/>
ol&#39; man, came home, he talked to Nate, and Nate talked like a person<br/>
really in tuned with his feelings.  Barry said that Nate never talked<br/>
like that before.   So I continue to be affirmative and look forward to<br/>
the greater days.  Lisa of MT  P.S.  I subscribed to HEM but haven&#39;t<br/>

Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] deschooling<br/>
 <br/>
Hi Lisa and all,<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking on this list for months now but the coincidence <br/>
of your subject is too big to pass. This month&#39;s HOME EDUCATION <br/>
MAGAZINE has two articles on deschooling: Sandra Dodd&#39;s DESCHOOLING <br/>
FOR PARENTS and my article TAKING THE SCHOOL OUT OF HOMESCHOOL. I do <br/>
not know if it was fate or a coincidence arranged by the editor :-) <br/>
but the main argument in both of our articles is simply this:<br/>
<br/>
It has been argued for many years that children need to decompress or <br/>
deschool after being removed from school in order to clear the path <br/>
to homeschooling or unschooling. Well, children don&#39;t homeschool or <br/>
unschool in a vacuum; they do so after all with their parents. <br/>
Parents need to deschool as much as, if not even more than, their <br/>
children since most have many more years of schooling than their <br/>
brood.<br/>
<br/>
I sent out a questionnaire to about 7 homeschooling and unschooling <br/>
email lists. The response about this topic was overwhelming (I wish I <br/>
had been able to include most of my respondents quotes). From their <br/>
wisdom I got what I call the &quot;The Three Rs&quot; or stages of deschooling:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;RESISTANCE is the stage in which children or parents are opposed to <br/>
&gt;the idea of homeschooling or any learning at all, not because they <br/>
&gt;want to go back to school but because homeschooling is too much like <br/>
&gt;school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>REGROUPING is about backing off and backing down from expectations <br/>
and judgements. It is a time to play, to hang out and to reassess <br/>
priorities. This is the decompression period a lot of homeschoolers <br/>
talk about and which many homeschoolers believe should be one month <br/>
for every year our kids attended school.<br/>
<br/>
RESEARCH comes along with resistance and regrouping: This is the time <br/>
spent immersed in the homeschooling community, meeting and learning <br/>
more about the different styles and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
This last stage I like to think also about it as a time for <br/>
REDISCOVERY in the sense that, through learning more about all the <br/>
options available in homeschooling, both parents and children can <br/>
find new ways of doing what they had thought they could not do or <br/>
were not allowed to do because it was not schooling. So, in a sense, <br/>
by learning about the different ways one can learn through <br/>
homeschooling, hopefully children and parents alike can find the joy <br/>
they lost at school for learning.<br/>
<br/>
The article came after an AHA! moment I had on an email discussion. <br/>
If you take into consideration that my parents sent me to school at <br/>
the age of three and that I had not stopped being in a school setting <br/>
until I quit teaching college and decided not to write a <br/>
dissertation; then that would have made me a SCHOOLER for 27 <br/>
CONSECUTIVE YEARS.<br/>
<br/>
So the issue of DESCHOOLING became very clear to me. My son (who is <br/>
still not of compulsory age) attended nursery schools and pre-k for 2 <br/>
years (he just turned 5). He is an incredibly social child so it took <br/>
him about 6 months to get over the fact that his friends were in <br/>
school and he was not. I, on the other hand, am still getting the <br/>
hang of NOT doing school.<br/>
<br/>
Your son is just 8 years old. I cannot find the links (will post them <br/>
later) of some of the child development researchers who believe they <br/>
can change schools by actually having them throw away academic work <br/>
----or stave it until kids reach the age of 11 or 12. Your son needs <br/>
to play and just be and right now you are still trying to cram things <br/>
down his throat by being worried about his &quot;academic&quot; future.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. isn&#39;t it weird for us to worry about this? Academic <br/>
work is what you do when working in a university and writing a <br/>
thesis. What your son and all children should be doing at the age of <br/>
8 is playing, growing and being because that is the way that most <br/>
mammals, including humans, learn. All this academic poppycock is <br/>
actually stunting children&#39;s, and in the end human, development. <br/>
Sorry about the rant but I get really passionate about this.<br/>
<br/>
You said you did some field trips. I say, do some more. You and your <br/>
guy need to go on some adventures, get away from it all, and <br/>
reconnect as mother and child, as Lisa and Nate, and not as teacher <br/>
and student or &quot;assessor&quot; and &quot;academic achievement grade&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling is going to be a bumpy ride but y&#39;all be fine. You just <br/>
need to find the fun in learning and forget about the &#39;academic work&#39; <br/>
--and when I say you I mean, YOU. Your son said already what he wants <br/>
and how he wants it. Lisa needs to reassess how she wants to help <br/>
Nate accomplish that. I would start with some chamomile tea and a <br/>
bubble bath. Oh, and I rented a whole slew of AbFab and Monty Python <br/>
tapes  --nothing like good ol&#39; brit humor and silliness to put things <br/>
into perspective. Then, do things together. Find things the both of <br/>
you LOVE, not just like but LOVE doing together. Then, hang out some <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>

Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] deschooling<br/>
<br/>
Hey {{{Lisa}}}<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has never been to school so I can&#39;t tell you about deschooling.<br/>
All I can tell you is I pay attention to what he likes and help him find<br/>
as much of it as he wants.  Lately it&#39;s been insects and doesn&#39;t that<br/>
sound academic?  Also lately he likes to color fuzzy velvet posters.<br/>
(No<br/>
Elvis so far) but fuzzy velvet posters don&#39;t sound nearly as academic as<br/>
insects.  And always it is cartoons and Godzilla and X-files, and<br/>
M*A*S*H, and Playstation and Gameboy and Calvin and Hobbs and Peanuts.  <br/>
My point is that we tend to see certain things as learning and other<br/>
things strictly as entertainment.  But I can tell you he&#39;s learned more<br/>
useful things from all that entertainment than he has from being able to<br/>
tell a bee assassin from a milkweed beetle.  That&#39;s cool and impresses<br/>
big people but what he really uses every day is his sense of drama, and<br/>
humor and compassion and  his quick thinking and dexterity and his<br/>
observation skills.  He has an astounding visual memory which helps him<br/>
all the time.  <br/>
Dylan couldn&#39;t sit down and do the multiplication tables like a third<br/>
grader here could do but he can count the money in his wallet and<br/>
determine if there is enough for the things he wants to buy.  He can<br/>
figure how much he&#39;ll have left, how much change he&#39;ll get back, how<br/>
much<br/>
he needs to save for the next thing.  He plays cribbage with his dad and<br/>
can count by 15&#39;s like nobody business.  He can add his score in Yahtzee<br/>
and that&#39;s because he likes to play.  He&#39;s awsome at SET.  So is he<br/>
behind?  Maybe according to the school but not according to his life. <br/>
What he needs in his real life right now he knows or will know as the<br/>
need arises because he gets to live and use what he learns.  He has<br/>
never<br/>
encountered a situation in ten years of life that required knowing the<br/>
multiplication tables.    <br/>
<br/>
Why does Nate need to read right now Lisa?  He&#39;s not driving around in<br/>
your car, he&#39;s not going to work, he&#39;s not walking around town by<br/>
himself.   What does he absolutely NEED to read right now that you can&#39;t<br/>
help him with?  <br/>
The only reason kids are forced into reading so early at school is for<br/>
the convenience of the teachers.   No little kid needs to read at six or<br/>
seven or eight or even 10 or 12.   Maybe by the time he wants a job, or<br/>
wants his drivers licence but how far away is that?  In between there is<br/>
so much time to hear wonderful stories and see great movies and play. <br/>
(And in fact, my husband works with a man who has his high school<br/>
diploma and never learned to read.  He makes an excellent living as an<br/>
equipment operator, he&#39;s better paid than our Mayor,  has a nice home a<br/>
lovely wife and a loyal dog.)<br/>
<br/>
If you start to look at what Nate likes to play as meaningful to his<br/>
life<br/>
right now you will begin to see a world of learning in it.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to be measured or judged against someone else&#39;s standard, he just<br/>
needs to be a kid and play and have you involved with him.  Just read to<br/>
him when he wants, play with him, take him places he likes to go, tell<br/>
him what a cool kid he is and how much you like to be with him.  Tell<br/>
him<br/>
everything will be ok.  <br/>
<br/>
You already do lots of cool things with your kids Lisa.  You&#39;re doing<br/>
ok.<br/>
It&#39;s probably so much easier for moms whose kids never went to school,<br/>
because we don&#39;t have that idea in our minds about what school would<br/>
expect.   What if Nate just played and healed and found joy in his life<br/>
everyday and knew you were proud of him no matter what?  Would you trade<br/>
that for reading right now?  Which is more important in his life at this<br/>
moment?  <br/>
<br/>
Love & Peace,<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have backed off completely<br/>
<br/>
anything academic and we have taken a few field trips. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The deschooling needs to be yours, not your child&#39;s. <br/>
Just for one example, &quot;field trip&quot; means a departure from school out into the <br/>
real world.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re at home, you already are not in school, and so a field trip is just <br/>
the same sort of trip to a museum or historic site or factory or zoo as any <br/>
tourist or local with a day off might take.  Only you have 365 &quot;days off,&quot; <br/>
and you can treat any or all of them like a Saturday of a vacation.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don’t why he<br/>
<br/>
is testing me so much.  Is this a message that he rather be in school? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t begin to guess why he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing without knowing more <br/>
about what you&#39;re doing.  And what you&#39;re saying, and what your attitude <br/>
toward learning is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Am I<br/>
<br/>
suppressing my fear of his not succeeding if he has no academic<br/>
<br/>
background.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Apparently you&#39;re not doing it very well!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

There are over 100 unread messages in my box, so I&#39;m hoping someone else has <br/>

&lt;&lt; Are there ways that your insights about deschooling can be applied to<br/>
how I help new homeschoolers deschool?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I recommend to the moms that they make lists and charts, but just do it late <br/>
at night after the child is asleep and keep him out of it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The urge doesn&#39;t usually last long.  They start to see how much learning is <br/>
taking place, and how much time it would take to document it, and they decide <br/>
to just let it go.<br/>
<br/>
But for some particularly organized or nervous or anal moms, &quot;assigning&quot; them <br/>
to document learning in secret satisfies their need to spy on the kid totally <br/>
and KNOW what&#39;s happening.  Then they see that it&#39;s silly (in secret, without <br/>
being embarrassed by anyone else) and they lighten up altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Someone (maybe not on this list) mentioned the world book link .  It&#39;s <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.worldbook.com/parents/course_study_curr6.asp">http://www2.worldbook.com/parents/course_study_curr6.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
and that set of listings can satisfy the organizationsl urges for a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
But I would tell her seriously NOT to share that information with the child, <br/>
because every bit of measuring and categorizing inhibits natural learning and <br/>
she should keep the &quot;progress&quot; to herself.<br/>

&lt;&lt; People say to expect at least a month of deschooling<br/>
 for every year that a child was in school or preschool/daycare.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe some people completely miss the point of deschooling.  They may <br/>
patiently wait until their children begin to show signs of being interested <br/>
is something and then they pounce, &quot;Okay, now it&#39;s time to homeschool!&quot; and <br/>
wonder why their children are still resistant.  &quot;Oh, they are just <br/>
rebellious, that&#39;s been the problem all along, it had nothing to do with <br/>
deschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Parents almost always require more deschooling time than children.  So what <br/>
we should suggest is that for every year the PARENT was in school or <br/>
preschool/daycare they deschool at least a month! (more like a year!!)<br/>
<br/>
I heard one time from somewhere.........Unschooling is right for every child <br/>
but not every parent.  Sounds right to me.<br/>

William Wallace came about because of Age of Kings. The game <br/>
also taught him a great deal before he even went loooking fora book.<br/>

I love computer games myself (although I&#39;m terrible at Age of <br/>
Kings) and have never really got my head round the idea that these <br/>
things should be limited.<br/>

I&#39;ve been wondering how parents deschool from their own institutional<br/>
experiences of being told to sit down and shut up.  I think school<br/>
really, really encourages passivity.  What helps people (parents)<br/>
transform from being passive widgets in a machine to being large and in<br/>
charge with their own lives?  I don&#39;t think my dh and I have made it<br/>
through that change yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739863084">Hey Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
I guess you can tell them to take a year off and call you on the <br/>
morning of their anniversary :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sandra pointed out that deschooling is more of a process that parents <br/>
have to go through  --not just the kids. I think that kids get over <br/>
things faster than adults because they are in perpetual motion. <br/>
Adults on the other hand live with the fallacy that life is always <br/>
the same and hence &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;suffering&quot;, &quot;trauma&quot; is something that <br/>
you will live with for the rest of your life. Kids do not have a <br/>
&quot;rest of your life&quot; concept of time, they live in the moment and for <br/>
that reason deschooling is easy on them.<br/>
<br/>
On the parents, it is a whole other thing. If a child resists <br/>
lessons, teaching of just a parents &quot;good advice&quot; it is not out of <br/>
spite. This is their way of saying &quot;YOU JUST DON&#39;T GET IT&quot;. Fights <br/>
are not about violence, they are about broken communication. So if a <br/>
child is hostile to a parent&#39;s style of homeschooling, they are not <br/>
asking to go back to school. What they are telling the parents is <br/>
that THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM. When it comes to homeschooling, <br/>
resistance comes out of the kids knowing clearly what they want but <br/>
feeling frustrated the &#39;rents have not caught up with that insight.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;homeschooling hostilities&quot; are all about changing the paradigm <br/>
of learning. It is going from the paradigm of &quot;school&quot; to the <br/>
paradigm of &quot;education&quot; to the paradigm of &quot;learning&quot;. They are very <br/>
different ideologies and practices. For this reason, if you need to <br/>
fill out portfolios or what not, learn how to do so effectively with <br/>
what you have and are doing right now because in this first year you <br/>
should really do no &quot;schooling&quot; at all. Really. People should take <br/>
the first year of homeschooling as a present to themselves and just <br/>
not do anything but explore what this new way of life means to them.<br/>
<br/>
Then, after that year, you can offer them a cookie as well ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are there ways that your insights about deschooling can be applied to<br/>
&gt;how I help new homeschoolers deschool?  Maybe I should get over myself<br/>
&gt;and not get sucked into &quot;helping&quot;.  I could just stick with &quot;Nice to<br/>
&gt;meet you.  Have a cookie.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any ideas? <br/>
