<div id="ygrps-yiv-348981587">Here&#39;s what Marty and Keith were doing the past few days.  They&#39;re  <br/>
home safely and unloading the trailer (tents need to be dried  <br/>
out).    They&#39;re not photos of Keith or Marty.  If any of those come  <br/>
up I&#39;ll send a link, but for those wondering what older unschoolers  <br/>
sometimes do for learning experiences, there&#39;s Marty Dodd&#39;s recent  <br/>
activity.<br/>

The second photo in that set, the people wearing green, that&#39;s our  <br/>
kingdom.  Marty says &quot;That was the first march on the first day,&quot; and  <br/>
they were farther back.  He was wearing a black and gold tabard,  <br/>
because he&#39;s on the baronial guard (local group&#39;s colors are black  <br/>
and gold).<br/>
<br/>
There are some photos of Marty in armor (and other SCA clothes and  <br/>
times) here:<br/>
