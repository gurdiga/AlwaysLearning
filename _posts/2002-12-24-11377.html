I have a friend that breeds Weimaraners (grey bird dogs). Her name is Elena <br/>
Smith. Her kennel name is &quot;Silversmith&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I got a puppy from Elena several years ago. The dog&#39;s mother&#39;s name was <br/>
&quot;Page&quot;, so we were supposed to use the word &quot;Page&quot; in her registered name. We <br/>
chose &quot;Silversmith&#39;s Electronic Page&quot; and called her &quot;Beeper&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I had a mobile dog grooming business called &quot;Dogs By The Yard&quot;. It was <br/>
between that and &quot;At Your Bark and Call&quot;. DBTY won out by two votes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
