<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007905369">I would have enjoyed pulling out the sliver but that&#39;s me.  Last <br/>
summer a neighbor boy (10 or 11) got &#39;stabbed&#39; in the arm with the <br/>
shattered end of a stick.  He came to me (as his parents were &#39;gone&#39; <br/>
somewhere).  I pulled 4  3/4 inch slivers the width of toothpicks <br/>
out of his arm.  And they were straight it!!  It was awesome!  <br/>
Several summers ago my nephew cam in screaming and full of &#39;fence&#39;.  <br/>
Bug chunks of fence board in his arm.  I got to take those out.<br/>
<br/>
I was the one who did piercings for friends and stuff in highschool <br/>
too.  I don&#39;t want to be a doctor though!  No chance!  I am a <br/>
picker.  Scabs, hangnails anything that will bleed is very <br/>
gratifying.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I know you all think I&#39;m wacko now so I won&#39;t tell you about the <br/>
vampire fantasies I used to have as a teenager :)<br/>
<br/>
And I think you might be right about the genetic link Sandra because <br/>
my dd&#39;s favorite shows are the opperation ones.  And she&#39;s 4!  :)<br/>

Well, YEAH.  If he had been willing to leave it in I would have been happy to <br/>
mess with the big boil of pus it would have produced after a few days.  But <br/>
Keith, he had been picking up dog poop and was afraid of gangrene.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe HE was the wimp!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

The children&#39;s museum in St. Louis is very cool.  Huge and wonderful.  Part <br/>
of their display is a freeway overpass!  The museum straddles the freeway and <br/>
you can go up there and look down.  <br/>
<br/>
But something they had I couldn&#39;t really watch was two operations on video.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you with that proclivity:  St. Louis!  (Though now I guess they <br/>
can probably be rented and watched at home with popcorn.)<br/>
<br/>
Neither Marty nor Kirby pick.  They get good zits and won&#39;t pop them.  <br/>
Commendable.  Yeah.  Whatever. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
But I picked as a kid and had scabs, so they&#39;re way better off.  Holly is <br/>
going to pick, I bet.  She can recite the tale of every scar on her body.  <br/>
She knows when moles appeared.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to &#39;pick&#39; my teenage zits (or &#39;squeeze&#39;!) - and couldn&#39;t *Stand* it <br/>
when others didn&#39;t!  It was the aesthetics and knowing that sometimes zits <br/>
were uncomfortable and folks didn&#39;t need that discomfort..  ...I&#39;d always <br/>
want to go up and ask them if I could show them how to get rid of them... <br/>
but never did!   Too chicken maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d squeezed for years (sometimes still find the need to) and never <br/>
had a scar from it.<br/>
I clean my hands and face with soap, break the middle of the zit with a <br/>
flame-sterilized sewing needle and squeeze away!  It was usually completely <br/>
painless if they were surface, not &#39;deep&#39;.  Anyway, if Holly decides to <br/>
&#39;pick&#39;, you might choose to share how one person did it and came out of it <br/>
just fine.<br/>

I pick, horribly.  Especially those nasty deep ones that take forever to<br/>
come to a head (if they ever do).  I don&#39;t have any scars, and I&#39;m not<br/>
particularly careful about cleanliness.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time my zits have been part of my PMS.  Even when I got<br/>
irregular, the zits would be a hint that a period was coming.  Now I haven&#39;t<br/>
stopped getting periods (they go several months in between but there&#39;s<br/>
always another one at some point) and the zits are whenever.  I was really<br/>
hoping they&#39;d finally stop.<br/>

Yeah,  I think it would be only fair that if we get a grey hair we don&#39;t get zits any more!    Don&#39;t you think?    I wish!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah,  they aren&#39;t grey hairs,  they&#39;re wisdom hairs.   I must be quite wise then.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
