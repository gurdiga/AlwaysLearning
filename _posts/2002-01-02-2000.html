What a fabulous party!!! I never had such a cool party when I was a <br/>
kid....they were good, but HAGRID? <br/>
Your speech was beautifully written.<br/>
I am going to make a copy.<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that since you posted it we can do that?<br/>
How fun....you&#39;ve inspired me to think of some fun party theme for my dd&#39;s <br/>
Birthday. I&#39;ve been a bit lax on the Birthday&#39;s the last year or so.<br/>
