<div id="ygrps-yiv-436325742">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am too, unschooler&#39;s mother of 9yo.  I too, am not good at games and don&#39;t<br/>
enjoy playing them.  But I have found that there is one game that I like to<br/>
play.  And when dd asks me to play a board game with her, we play that one.<br/>
<br/>
But ever since I decided to become a full time mother, when dd turned 3, I<br/>
decided at that time that playing was the most important aspect of<br/>
childrenhood. So I did my best to go outside when she demanded it.  And when<br/>
outside I had, have set that I will be there.  I would have fun.  (I am a<br/>
firm believer of what O. Fred Donaldson &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; writes in this<br/>
book.)<br/>
<br/>
We are the only hs of our area but I am glad that I was lucky to find always<br/>
playmates for dd; I invited children to play at my place, I offered mothers<br/>
to look after their children, I opened my home to children.<br/>
<br/>
To this day, playing is what dd does all day long, and that is what she<br/>
likes the most. She is healthy and I have nothing to complain about her.<br/>
(If I could wish, I wished that she read and wrote a little bit more...).<br/>
As she plays all day long, she leaves me time to my own reading!<br/>
<br/>
I believe that one does not have to like playing with its children to become<br/>
a unschooler; one needs to believe that children are a learning machine and<br/>
be honest all the time.<br/>
<br/>
love and peace, noemi fm Tokyo.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360653957">I always thought I was the only one who didn&#39;t like to play!!  Now I know that I &#39;only wanna play what I wanna play.&#39;  Participating in a game is what I sometimes do, but that to me, isn&#39;t  the purest form of &#39;playing.&#39;  I like the play definition of &quot;frolic.&quot;   I love to experiment with clay (hand building or wheel throwing) - but it&#39;s serious for me.  I like to play with words too.  That&#39;s probably as close as I come to frolicking.   My repressive, abusive upbringing seriously damaged my ability to frolic really freely (not to mention my nervous system.)  Sadly, we somewhat repressed our firstborn, a 15yo, but not as severely as his Dad and me got.  I feel pretty badly about that, but he&#39;s more than making up for it now.  Our 10yo is really free though.<br/>
 <br/>
My teacher told me that I&#39;m not responsible for teaching the kids anything.  I&#39;m responsible for following my own joy, then they&#39;ll understand that it&#39;s ok to follow theirs.  I offer them as much support as possible.  Sometimes the 10you will play with my clay or pastels, or dough, whatever I&#39;m playing with at the moment.  We do lots of things together, but only what is joyful for both of us.  Torture is useless - I had to write this on the fridge as a litmus test for unschooling for months.  I was really in bad shape.  I&#39;m a Recovering Schooler.<br/>
 <br/>
I just read a great unschooler book, &quot;And the children played&quot; by Patricia Joudry.  Her kids did nothing but play until they were 12, then they were insatiable for information.  This helped me relax all over again.  Funny book, good writer - 10yo loved it.  That&#39;s one of our favorite ways of playing, reading funny books together.  Atleast it feels like play to me, maybe because I was never read to.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much hope of me loosening up much more, but I keep investigating things that might inspire...<br/>
