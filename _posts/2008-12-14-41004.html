<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119160066">Youngest dd, Kirsten is 4 1/2.<br/>
Dh likes to wrap up presents and have them under the tree.  Yes, it makes<br/>
for a pretty tree, but it feels like pure torture for Kirsten.  She has sat<br/>
beside that tree holding one of her presents asking to open it off and on<br/>
since she noticed it was there.  It seems to be making her<br/>
miserable.......the exact opposite of the intention!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling to find a balance between dh&#39;s and dd&#39;s desires.  ~Not to<br/>
mention my sanity!<br/>
<br/>
Dh wants dd to learn to wait.  He tells stories of how his mom used to have<br/>
to run him away from the presents and such so now, it seems, the<br/>
anticipation is just fun for him.  However it&#39;s not fun for Kirsten.  It&#39;s<br/>
causing much frustration that seems to be completely avoidable.<br/>
<br/>
I waited to put out her birthday presents until just a few hours before her<br/>
party this past summer and she was literally miserable.  She didn&#39;t even<br/>
want to go on with her party she just wanted to open her presents.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand it concerns me.  I don&#39;t want her to be selfish and only think<br/>
about the presents, but on the other hand she&#39;s only 4!  I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
the expectation of her waiting patiently is a realistic one at this age.  Is<br/>
selfish even the right word?  Maybe *impatient* is better.  But aren&#39;t we<br/>
all impatient at times?  She *has* learned to wait for things and be as<br/>
patient as her age and temperament allows her to be.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose *I* am frustrated because I don&#39;t want to undermine dh yet I don&#39;t<br/>
want to put my child through what I see as unnecessary frustration.<br/>
<br/>
......thoughts, ideas, examination of perceptions are appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998688171">Could you come to an agreement with hubby to wrap a small gift - go buy another small one if you have to - and let her open that one?  See if that helps maybe.  You could even have the 12 days of Christmas tradition where you give a small gift each day until Christmas.  Maybe a trip to the thrift store or the dollar store would do the trick for these gifts.  I remember when the dollar store and thrift store held great fascination and inexpensive items for our son at that age.<br/>
<br/>
Are there gifts your daughter could help wrap for others so she gets in on the other end of the specialness of surprises and gift giving?    Maybe craft projects of making gifts for others.  You know everyone thinks they are fantastic if the kid made them no matter what they look like.  I saw at Wal-Mart the other day packages of craft projects - like decorating a snowflake or tree made out of craft foam - there were something like 25 to a package for 4.98!!!!!  Oh and they had photo frame ornaments too in the shape of a snowman, penguin and something else for the same price - even drawing and coloring pictures for others, tracing your hands to make a wreath, a Christmas tree, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe fill her life up with other fun filled activities - maybe let her set the gift of her choice (her gift from under the tree) right beside her - let her carry it around.  If the paper gets worn out or ripped you can always tape it or wrap it again.  OH how about a colorful cloth sack - or a gift bag to carry it in so it won&#39;t be as likely to get worn out or messed up.<br/>

Dh likes to wrap up presents and have them under the tree. Yes, it makes<br/>

beside that tree holding one of her presents -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell her it was hers?<br/>
<br/>
I figure a gift belongs to the giver until the day/time/place where  <br/>
it&#39;s presented to the person.  At a birthday, that&#39;s when the gifts  <br/>
are opened during or after the party, but if someone comes and says  <br/>
&quot;Please open this one now, because I have to leave,&quot; the reason  <br/>
that&#39;s okay is that the gift belongs to the giver at some point.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little I told them not to touch the gifts because  <br/>
some were fragile and some could be guessed, and I didn&#39;t want that  <br/>
to happen.  When they got older I started to disguise gifts by  <br/>
putting noisy things in with them or packing them so they didn&#39;t make  <br/>
noise.  Marty loved to pick them up and rearrange them, so by the  <br/>
time he was four or five, I let them do that if they wanted to.  But  <br/>
by then they weren&#39;t wanting to open them, just play around with  <br/>
artistically arranging the packages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was a mistake to say &quot;This is yours.&quot;  I&#39;d say &quot;These are  <br/>
ours, it&#39;s part of Christmas tradition, that they stay here until  <br/>
Christmas.&quot;  And if you&#39;ve make the point that the gift has an  <br/>
intended time and place for opening, she won&#39;t be so confused if  <br/>
someone gives your family cookies or a decoration and says &quot;open it  <br/>
now.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971346566">The idea that people learn good things (restraint, or responsibility, <br/>
or whatever) from being miserable is a common one.  It&#39;s also <br/>
flawed.  People learn all the time, so they do learn from bad <br/>
experiences--but they are probably not learning what you want them to <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could explore with your husband the things your daughter <br/>
may actually be learning from having the presents under the <br/>
tree: &quot;Mom and Dad care more about when presents get opened than <br/>
about whether I&#39;m happy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If that seems too difficult (after all, that would involve your <br/>
husband also admitting that his parents made this mistake, and that <br/>
can be hard), maybe you can look at some other examples of &quot;learning <br/>
from misery&quot; that he already agrees are wrong, and then draw the <br/>
parallel to the current situation.<br/>
<br/>
You might also point out the many opportunities life affords people <br/>
to learn about waiting (until the store opens, until the cookies come <br/>
out of the oven, until the rain stops, and nineteen zillion other <br/>
examples), and that your ds will have plenty of chances to learn <br/>
about waiting without her parents making her miserable with it.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot; is a quick read <br/>
and includes some great explorations of the unintended consequences <br/>
of intended-to-be-educational situations.</div>

<br/>
That&#39;s too harsh, and those aren&#39;t the only two options.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad isn&#39;t AT ALL trying to be cruel, and it shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
presented or considered in that light.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Big gift occasions (birthdays, Christmas, weddings, graduations) are  <br/>
like feasts.  The difference between a feast and a meal is that  <br/>
feasts have TOO MUCH food.  They are, purposely, symbolic of  <br/>
abundance.  If there weren&#39;t leftovers, it wasn&#39;t a proper feast.<br/>
<br/>
So when you&#39;re making spaghetti on a Thursday and a kid wants a  <br/>
sandwich, no big deal.  If you&#39;re making Thanksgiving dinner or a  <br/>
formal Christmas dinner and a kid wants a sandwich, that&#39;s  <br/>
different.  I&#39;d still give a child snacks or let them taste what&#39;s  <br/>
cooking, but I wouldn&#39;t provide a whole meal in the couple of hours  <br/>
before a formal feast-style dinner.<br/>
<br/>
And a pile of gifts is like a feast, in that way.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a traditional thing to help kids know how long until the  <br/>
pile of gifts:  Advent calendars.  You can buy one or make one, and  <br/>
they sometimes involve a little gift every day (candy or a charm or  <br/>
something very small).<br/>

<br/>
Wrap some presents and put them where she can&#39;t see them, but your  <br/>
husband can. Then HE can have the joy of anticipating her joy when she  <br/>
does see them and gets to open them.<br/>
<br/>
Give her others to open and rewrap as she feels like it. My kids  <br/>
unwrapped and rewrapped gifts all the time when they were that age.  <br/>
That was the norm for us.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for birthday parties, we opened each gift as it arrived with the  <br/>
guest - we didn&#39;t pile them up and have a massive present-opening  <br/>
session. That always seemed a bit much to expect of the other kids -  <br/>
to sit and watch one kid open a bunch of presents. Fun for older kids  <br/>
who enjoy seeing what the birthday kid got, maybe. But not for little  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
-pam<br/>
<br/>
And, by the way, they are grown up now and they&#39;re not selfish,  <br/>
materialistic, or greedy. They love getting presents, but it truly  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to matter that much to them what it is, they like seeing  <br/>
what someone else has thought of giving them. THAT is the fun of it,  <br/>
for them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083236990">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We had a similar recent experience with a similar age kid, so I<br/>
thought I&#39;d let you know how things played out here in case it is at<br/>
all useful.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter (Larkin) will be 4 on christmas eve and our son will be 2<br/>
on dec. 30th, so there&#39;s a whole lot of winter holidays at our house.<br/>
:) Emile and I have been trying to come up with ways to make birthdays<br/>
feel special in the face of all the holiday hoopla (this is the first<br/>
year it will really matter since they are both so young). So we went<br/>
out and bought a bunch of fireworks after the fourth of July. About a<br/>
month ago, Larkin found them where they were not particularly hidden<br/>
in the pantry. She was *very* excited and wanted to set them off right<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
We told her that we bought them for her birthday party and if we set<br/>
them off before then there wasn&#39;t any way to buy more for the party<br/>
(although in retrospect there might be online...). We then gave her<br/>
the choice to use them immediately or save them (the point, after all,<br/>
was mostly to make her happy in the first place) and she chose to save<br/>
them: &quot;But let&#39;s hide them better so they don&#39;t keep taunting me.&quot; So<br/>
we found a place to keep them where she wouldn&#39;t come into daily<br/>
contact with them and she talks about them occasionally but has not<br/>
wanted to get them out. She actually ran laughing from the room in<br/>
which they are hidden in the closet at some point because she could<br/>
hear them calling to her. :)<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, we talked about the awkwardness at birthday parties when<br/>
one kid is opening lots of presents and all the other kids are<br/>
watching them. Sounds like you could hardly devise a better torture<br/>
for young children to me! She&#39;s been on the watching side of that one<br/>
and didn&#39;t enjoy it very much. She suggested we put the presents in<br/>
our room (and close the door!) during the party so she can play<br/>
without seeing them and they can be opened after the other kids go<br/>
home. I think it would have been a very tricky situation to negotiate<br/>
if we hadn&#39;t discussed it beforehand and let her have a say in the<br/>
decision making process.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll wait until the kids are older (and think it sounds like fun)<br/>
before putting out gifts with a long timeline before opening.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
<br/>
Jenny (Larkin, almost 4; Finn, almost 2)<br/>

<br/>
Christmas wrapping paper is not usually expensive.  If it seems so to  <br/>
you, buy lots right after Christmas and stash it.  Sometimes you can  <br/>
buy it for nearly  nothing then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I always did let my kids wrap things up--their own toys, gifts for  <br/>
their dolls and stuffed animals, gifts for each other, and to play  <br/>
around with things that way.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the point of view of the dad who wants the gifts under  <br/>
the tree.  It&#39;s that way here.  The gifts are part of the  <br/>
decorations.  The tree looks cool with gifts under it.  It&#39;s  <br/>
something kids will see elsewhere, too, and they can&#39;t open gifts  <br/>
under other people&#39;s trees, or public trees with empty boxes wrapped  <br/>
for decoration.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some kids do have a harder time than others though - I coached all of  <br/>
my three the same way, but Roya was especially awesome, from the  <br/>
beginning, at being a great guest. She had no problem with it being  <br/>
someone else&#39;s birthday or with someone else getting all the gifts.  <br/>
She &quot;got it&quot; that her turn would come, but, even more importantly, she  <br/>
completely got into making the birthday kid feel special. Roya was  <br/>
happy if the birthday kid was happy. But my other two had a little  <br/>
less of that kind of strong empathy and were a little more wishing it  <br/>
was them getting certain of the presents or being the center of  <br/>
attention. Not awful - they behaved just fine, but I knew they were  <br/>
feeling envious.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I figured most kids weren&#39;t probably that thrilled to sit and  <br/>
watch another kid open a lot of cool gifts - so we started opening  <br/>
gifts as the guests arrived. Turned out to be very very nice - that  <br/>
meant each gift was accepted and oohed and ahhed over and thanks given  <br/>
individually, rather than as part of a slew of gifts. We also tended  <br/>
to have open-ended get-togethers for birthdays and people were coming  <br/>
and going at different times.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
My kids have a huge amount of things they like to wrap. From  old toys to <br/>
snacks to letters to a bit of fuzz found underneath something, they  like to wrap <br/>
it. Sometimes it needs Wrapping Paper, sometimes just a piece of  notebook <br/>
paper, sometimes it is all tape, sometimes it is scraps of other  things found <br/>
around the house or in the recycle container. They ask me to wrap  things for <br/>
them, sometimes, to open. Something they pick, something I dig around  and pick <br/>
out for the surprise... often they like to wrap some small something or  a <br/>
note or drawing they&#39;ve made, for me to open, so they can see the surprise and  <br/>
happiness on my face. Wrapping and unwrapping are big, here, all year &#39;round. <br/>
In  a way, it is kind of like hide and seek, but they&#39;re &quot;outside&quot; the game,  <br/>
watching, when they give a gift. I make sure we have *plenty* of tape at all  <br/>
times, and I try to have scissors available, but those aren&#39;t always  <br/>
necessary-tape is required most of the time, so I make sure I buy a dispenser of  the <br/>
cheap stuff every time I go to the grocery store.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870111589">I&#39;d be very disappointed if the person receiving the gift from me set it aside in another room, shut the door and never opened it while I was there.   The joy in giving a gift for me is to see the person open it - to see their reaction and joy or surprise.  Though I do mail gifts to family all the time and do not get to see them open it.  Still, if I handed it to them, I&#39;d like to see them open it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often seen young children - well anyone - hover and urge the receiver to open the gift as they too are experiencing the joy of gifting.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is just family history playing a part in this - my family was a huge extended farm family.  For Christmas Eve we&#39;d gather and a few people at a time would open gifts and &quot;show&quot; everyone else and even pass it around so everyone could see what each person received.  It was an informal ritual, noisy & very fun that lasted the evening.  We moved around, got snacks, drinks, chatted and played around.  When I married, my husband&#39;s family would pass out all the gifts and open them all at the same time (in about 5 minutes) and I was very disappointed as I did not know what people &quot;got&quot; and did not get to see them open my gifts to them - it seemed like we were not sharing the experience together - it was more of a &quot;what did I get&quot; feeding frenzy.<br/>

little things-we just put them in little decorated lunch bags with some  gelt and <br/>
we light candles and talk about traditions and history of the holiday.  <br/>
SinterKlaas is different and fun as well, and again, lots of history and  <br/>
differences in the way folks do things. There&#39;s Los Posadas, Solstice, Festivus,  <br/>
Advent, Boxing Day, Kwanzaa, Family Day, Feast of the Sacrifice, just to  name a <br/>
few. Here&#39;s where I found most of what we celebrate: <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earthcalendar.net/index.php_">http://www.earthcalendar.net/index.php_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earthcalendar.net/index.php)">http://www.earthcalendar.net/index.php)</a>    I look at it as an <br/>
opportunity to give a little trinket, learn about other  cultures, beliefs and <br/>
traditions and a way to diffuse the &quot;is it Christmas,  yet??&quot; anxiety. They <br/>
still get a huge kick out of The Big Day, but it tends to  take the &quot;torture&quot; <br/>
aspect out of it and lends it more toward &quot;anticipation&quot;.  That might just be my <br/>
kids, it might not work for everyone, but we have so much  fun with it!<br/>

***We do something similar.  We don&#39;t celebrate all the holidays, but we have been busier this month than usual.  Some of it is things only available (and often free) around Christmas and some of it things always available.  I did not want the kids focused on Christmas all month, but instead we are focusing on making the whole month special and fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139794273">Jayn has also not been good at waiting, and becomes very agitated. She <br/>
really feels the taunting thing if she can see the boxes. Especially when we <br/>
have a fairly steady stream of things coming in the mail. Sometimes I am <br/>
able to intercept the box and hide it before she sees it, but if a box is <br/>
emblazoned with the name of the toy company as many are, it is futile to try <br/>
to hide that the gift is for her. She was not of the temperament to happily <br/>
play with boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn opens her presents as they arrive if she wants to, and sometimes she <br/>
just wants to know which have her name on it. Dh was saying that he wanted <br/>
to be able to keep gifts for Christmas morning, so his idea was to change <br/>
how he did things, rather than try to change Jayn. If we want to keep gifts <br/>
for Christmas day, we hide them out of the house, like in the trunk of dh&#39;s <br/>
car. Hiding them in our house, which was possible when Jayn was smaller, <br/>
doesn&#39;t work as we don&#39;t have hiding places (full to overflowing closets <br/>
already) and she snoops. The only consequence for her is that she will have <br/>
fewer on the day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that last year we had a sequence of small gifts for her to open <br/>
in the week leading up to the big day. We sometimes re-wrap also, and we <br/>
will arrange the opened things from the couple of weeks under the tree to <br/>
look at also. Jayn is very clear on what is a &quot;Christmas present&quot; as against <br/>
just a doll, for example. Meanwhile we see her aunt at some point and give <br/>
and get gifts so sometimes Christmas keeps going on.<br/>
<br/>
However this year, Jayn being 9, she had the opportunity to pick up her gift <br/>
from her grandfather well in advance of Christmas. It is a doll ordered from <br/>
a local toy store. Instead she chose to wait until he arrives here to spend <br/>
the holidays with us, and make an outing of going to pick it up with him on <br/>
Christmas eve. Doing this was all her delightful idea.<br/>
<br/>
As for the tree looking nice, there are plenty of other gifts for other <br/>
family members under it, an a porcelain village that I put under when the <br/>
gifts go to keep it pretty. We don&#39;t miss Jayn&#39;s parcels.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272840819">&lt;For Christmas Eve we&#39;d gather and a few people at a time would open gifts<br/>
and &quot;show&quot; everyone else and even pass it around so everyone could see what<br/>
each person received. It was an informal ritual, noisy & very fun that<br/>
lasted the evening. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is also what we do on Christmas morning both at home and at my mom&#39;s<br/>
house.  That sharing of the special moments for other is a large part of<br/>
what makes Christmas special to me. (that and the great food!)   I love the<br/>
giving part of Christmas and seeing the faces of the gift receivers too.  I<br/>
also coached my kids when they were younger before going to a party about<br/>
how to behave and they have always  loved going to parties and they<br/>
especially love watching someone open a gift they brought them.  They would<br/>
sometimes try to place their gift near the front on the pile in hopes that<br/>
it would be one of the first ones opened.<br/>
<br/>
Although I do love the looks of presents under the tree, the only ones we<br/>
put under the tree before late Christmas eve are ones that people deliver to<br/>
us personally and only if they want us to wait until Christmas and not open<br/>
it when they give it to us.  I did it mostly so it would be a big surprise<br/>
when Santa came and all the kids would wake to see them all.  I grew up in a<br/>
large family and I always loved walking down the stairs to see the huge<br/>
amount of presents under the tree.  My tree always looks a bit barren<br/>
compared to our tree when I was a kid.<br/>

one that thrills him or her, and starts playing with it and forgets  <br/>
about the waiting unopened gifts. Or they are tearing into the gifts  <br/>
and tossing one after another aside without showing much interest,  <br/>
just obligatory &quot;thank you&#39;s,&quot; until they get to one they really like.<br/>
<br/>
I was sensitive to people&#39;s feelings, even as a little kid or 6 or 7  <br/>
years old. I&#39;d sit at birthday parties and watch the present-opening  <br/>
and know when the party child was disappointed in a gift and when they  <br/>
were thrilled. And I felt bad if it wasn&#39;t mine that thrilled them and  <br/>
I&#39;d feel embarrassed if it was mine that was the big deal and the  <br/>
other kids gifts were being ignored. And, I&#39;d think about how much  <br/>
time and care people took to pick out the perfect present to see it  <br/>
tossed into a pile with a bunch of other presents.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are really interesting advent calendars available (probably an <br/>
idea for next year, as it&#39;s a little late for this year!).  My boys <br/>
both chose Playmobil calendars, and each picked a different theme.  <br/>
Each day, they open a numbered box that has one toy in it.  Little by <br/>
little, they make up a scene (one has a pirate theme, and the other <br/>
is a medieval theme ... there are lots of themes available - I found <br/>
a nice selection of advent calendars to choose from on eBay).<br/>
<br/>
This year, I also purchased elf cones (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what <br/>
they&#39;re really called, but it&#39;s what they look like) from <br/>
Hearthsong.com.  I hung them on my sons&#39; bed posts, and each evening, <br/>
after they fall asleep, I put a little treat in the cone - could be a <br/>
small toy, or some candy.  They look forward to checking for their <br/>
treats as soon as they open their eyes each morning.<br/>
<br/>
As for the gifts under the tree, we don&#39;t do that in our house - I, <br/>
too, think it would be torture for my kids.  If your husband really <br/>
enjoys the look of wrapped gifts under the tree, maybe you could wrap <br/>
empty boxes.  Your daughter could help you wrap them.  As she gets <br/>
older, the anticipation might not be so difficult, and may eventually <br/>
be fun - until then, at least you&#39;d have a way to enjoy the look of <br/>
gifts under the tree.  <br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t do gifts under the tree either, although it started out with <br/>
having a cat that ate ribbons and wrap, then was sick everywhere!  Now, <br/>
our 8yo has difficulty with the concept of time, so it is easier for <br/>
him NOT to have presents in plain sight.<br/>
<br/>
My 11yo son said to me the other day that one of his favorite Christmas <br/>
traditions is having the decorated tree up with nothing there and then <br/>
watching me bring all of the presents out the day before Christmas and <br/>
putting them under the tree.  He said that it gets him all excited, <br/>
seeing the colorful paper and wondering what&#39;s in them.  My husband and <br/>
I had no idea that avoiding cat sick could start such a nice tradition!!<br/>

Just wanted to throw in what has come about at our house-<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One year, my MIL gave gifts in sturdy, reusable decorated gift boxes. After<br/>
Christmas, we put them away with the holiday decorations. When we pulled<br/>
them out the following year, we put them empty under the tree until we were<br/>
ready to wrap gifts, really just for lack of space to put them anywhere<br/>
else. The next day, the kids started using them to &quot;play Christmas&quot;- putting<br/>
various toys and belongings in them and &quot;giving&quot; them to each other. They<br/>
now do this every year. I usually wait until Christmas Eve to actually put<br/>
gifts out under the tree and they always get to open one gift that night. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thought I&#39;d throw that idea out there. <br/>

*As for the gifts under the tree, we don&#39;t do that in our house*<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do gifts under the tree either, although it started out with <br/>
having a cat that ate ribbons and wrap, then was sick everywhere! Now, <br/>
our 8yo has difficulty with the concept of time, so it is easier for <br/>
him NOT to have presents in plain sight.<br/>
<br/>
My 11yo son said to me the other day that one of his favorite Christmas <br/>
traditions is having the decorated tree up with nothing there and then <br/>
watching me bring all of the presents out the day before Christmas and <br/>
putting them under the tree. He said that it gets him all excited, <br/>
seeing the colorful paper and wondering what&#39;s in them. My husband and <br/>
I had no idea that avoiding cat sick could start such a nice tradition!!<br/>
<br/>
You never know how things will turn out.<br/>

&gt; When I was a kid my mom had little boxes that hung on the tree with <br/>
&gt; little gifts in them.  She usually bought toys from the quarter <br/>
&gt; machines at the grocery store (bouncy balls etc)she also would by <br/>
 </span></blockquote>small <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; raisin boxes, put money in them (ranging from a penny to a dollar) <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wrap them and hang them on the tree.  They made cute decorations <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and we <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; always looked forward to finishing dinner so we could &quot;pick a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>box&quot;.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of what we started doing a couple of years ago.  I <br/>
cut out some small stockings (probably about 6 inches tall or so) out <br/>
of different colored felt (not just the traditional Christmas colors) <br/>
and the kids and I decorated them with fabric paint, felt scraps, <br/>
jewels, etc.  I attached little ribbon loops for hanging them.  I <br/>
then put either small gifts in each stocking, or pieces of candy, or <br/>
even notes that I made using gift tags with things written on them <br/>
like &quot;Let&#39;s make sugar cookies!&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s watch a Christmas movie <br/>
together&quot; or I write a specific Christmas craft we get to do as a <br/>
family such as decorating gingerbread houses (made from graham <br/>
crackers) or doing one of those cheap oriental trading company crafts <br/>
which I have a ton of, or another craft that I found online.  Each <br/>
day my two children get to take turns opening the stocking for that <br/>
day.  There are always two items in each stocking, one for each of <br/>
them, except for the notes.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a large piece of stiff white fabric (I think it was some sort <br/>
of pellon) that is probably 5 feet long.  I sewed different buttons <br/>
on it, 4 across and 6 down, to hang the stocking on.  I made a hem in <br/>
the top, ran a dowel rod through it, attached a ribbon which I tied <br/>
to both ends of the dowel rod to hang it on the wall.  It makes a <br/>
nice Christmas decoration and the kids have had a blast with it.  <br/>
This is our third year to use it.<br/>
