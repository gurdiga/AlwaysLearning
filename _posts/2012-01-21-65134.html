<div id="ygrps-yiv-531716594">I believed moving would be fun and an adventure for my 8 y/o daughter and myself. Her and I embarking on our own for the first time since she was a toddler...decorating a new place that she and I picked out, painting, fixing things up, even the apartment hunting was fun. She&#39;s excited to have her own room again which we havnt had in 4 years. She seems to feel free and excited. <br/>
<br/>
Now our big move is a week away. And I havnt even started packing. I didnt even get a new calendar til this week for 2012 and realized we havnt been out anywhere fun in 20 days like we used to. Now today I wake up to find snow on the ground and want to go sledding or DO something but i must be either stressed, overwhelmed or full of anxiety because ive had a headache all week that wont quit. Im scared if I&#39;m doing the right thing now at all. <br/>
<br/>
We do HAVE to move...the full effects of my divorce have set in- not having the money to afford but half of where we currently live, and I realized now that we stopped spending our free time with my boyfriend and his son to accomplish this move, (the working on blending our families thing has to be shelved right now since the holidays). The only thing I&#39;ve gotten my daughter &quot;out&quot; to is Girl Scout meetings. We even had to let go of dance and other activities we couldnt afford, and spent alot of days this month at the DPW office, SS office, lawyers&#39; and realtors&#39; offices for all the transitioning thats occured. And of course we signed a lease. <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to go somewhere far (like opposite coast) and really start over, but again, financial restrictions. I am feeling sad over the upcoming conferences we wont make and my daughter is begging to go now. I&#39;ve asked her before the new year which she would rather have- to put everything we own in storage and travel to conferences and other things, living out of a cheap hotel room, or to have her own enviroment for all her toys, experiments, books. dolls etc. It was extreme but there were no other options but a shelter, which i avoided. I dont know if it was wise to let her choose, and I&#39;m not currently seeing the point in staying in the area we are going to be living in again for another year, as we are still around the same school minded people, if thats even a proper term. <br/>
<br/>
Point is, I&#39;m feeling so nervous about it and it was worse when I&#39;ve been attending the weekly womens support group against domestic violence (Women in Transition) thats mandatory for me to go to every week since they funded our move with a downpayment. Yet this has been the highpoint of my daughter&#39;s week. She enjoys going in the childcare room to make things on her own for 2 hours and I keep thinking- when we get moved in our new place she&#39;ll be able to do that again and have her toys out, and do arts and crafts without her father breaking them. <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m still feeling guilty, as much as the counselors there have told me i gave her the pricelsss gift of freedom against violence in the home, they think strongly that she should be in school. I feel concerned about these remarks. I dont even know where to go from here with this, but i am afraid perhaps of any consequences that could negatively affect her. I see school right now as something that would hinder us both further, but is our situation not prime for unschooling anymore and Im refusing to see it??? <br/>
<br/>
or could it be just the moving? I was reading a topic somewhere that the poster said, &quot;this is just a season of life&quot; over and over, about their own situation and it helped me feel better. but I&#39;m more concerned about my daughter feeling ok, as I do know at times, she&#39;s lonely, and the close friend of hers she was doing sleepovers with had to end due to the girl&#39;s house amongst many in the city where we live, is infested with bedbugs. apparently its a big problem in certain neighborhoods right in the center of our city, and i had no idea but was grateful enough that they told us to stay away for awhile and vice versa til they get it under control. Thats been the only thing my daughter&#39;s cried over, missing that friend. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, she seems ok, but I&#39;m looking out for more opinions, anything to learn more from all of you.<br/>
Thank you. Sincerely, Lynne, Mom to Faith</div>

Put on some happy music and pack.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t look at the negative part. If you&#39;ve  made an agreement that makes these meetings mandatory, find the good parts and go there happily.  Find ways to be happier than sadder.<br/>

<br/>
If you can&#39;t afford to stay home with her and having her in school would help you get a job to support her, then school for a while wouldn&#39;t be as bad as bedbugs and a homeless shelter.  <br/>
<br/>
Make choices.  Decide what you want for her--safety?  Friends?  Learning?  Her own room?  You can&#39;t decide &quot;unschooling&quot; as a primary choice if you&#39;re in danger of needing to be in a shelter.    Your duty to provide for her and keep her clothed, fed and educated is above and beyond any alternative education considerations.<br/>

 <br/>
i definitely need some whistle while you work friends around, just no one  <br/>
seems to be available, i find more people on line that answer than irl. <br/>
everyone  seems to have stuff going on.  there have been a lot of good things to <br/>
 come out of the meetings, i have exchanged some emails and they all mean <br/>
well,  im grateful for it, just nervous that ayone would call DHS on her not <br/>
being in  school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I am  getting assistance to be able to stay at home with her, and luckily <br/>
we wont be  in danger of having to go in a womens shelter. as much as the <br/>
welfare system  needs reforming for people on drugs or abusing it, im glad its <br/>
there for us  right now to provide medical and food benefits. We also have <br/>
plenty of clothes  from swaps. If i get us packed and moved im looking <br/>
forward to a smoother  enviroment of no negative energy where we can have learning <br/>
happen. friends are  the only consideration, and new friends whether it be <br/>
a school or homeschooling  playgroup, i hope to find. <br/>

I&#39;ve moved several times, so I tend to be more relaxed than most about it, and it&#39;s still stressful to me, even when I&#39;m happy and excited about the move. I tend to go into a bit of a funk right before I start packing and kind of push through that to my &quot;lets get it done&quot; mode. How do you usually deal with big stresses and changes? Thinking about that might help you figure out your process, see where you need a nudge and what kind, and where you need to &quot;just do it&quot; as it were. <br/>

<br/>
Well of course they do? &quot;Everyone Knows&quot; children &quot;need&quot; to be in school, right? &lt;wink&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does your daughter want to go to school? If she&#39;s used to being home, school may seem like one more giant transition. So if she&#39;s even on the fence, maybe interested  maybe not, it&#39;s probably better for her on an emotional level, to deal with the transition of moving and getting her life together after the move before school is even on the table. But if she&#39;s eager to go to school, that&#39;s another matter. Tell your support group, if they&#39;re badgering you, that you only want her to have one big transition at a time, but of course school is always an option. <br/>

Thank you for your words, yes it all is overwhelming, and i know i usually do well under pressure but my usual support beams are lacking right now. <br/>

<br/>
She is used to being home now and has no desire to go back to school, i think it would be way too much for her or i to take on. We are in essence just alittle lonely. The situation in the marriage pushed away alot fo local friends, wheres our true friends live over an hour away or more. The support group is nice, but i dont know them well enough to trust what anyones opinions could do, i actually feel safer coming tothis group and reading every day what i can, knowing that when i have something i need to talk about  regarding my daughter, no one gets it better than here. Once i can drum up some free activities and time, im sure we&#39;ll be back on track, until then, i gotta push through this, as you said definitely, a &quot;funk&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-621305005">What really helped me when we had to move was to not look so much at the big picture, not too far into the future, too overwhelming, but to just do something.  One step at a time.  <br/>
1.  Go on line (or ask friends) and look for good packing advice so I can do it quickly, effeciently, and cheaply. Done.<br/>
2.  Ask for help and be specific with what you need.  Sometimes I ask for help from people that are not that close.  I am frank and often say something like, &quot;I promise to pay this forward to someone in need in the future but right now I need this...  Can you help me out?&quot; How about the girl scouts.  My boys troop would jump in if one of the members needed something.  Done<br/>
3.  Get the boxes, check, (bulk meat packing boxes from restarant supply stores have handles, are sturdy and an fold down lid). Done.<br/>
and on down the line.  <br/>
etc....<br/>
Fun stuff to do is always there waiting.  When I am in survival mode, I focus on that and just don&#39;t access the information that would cause me to feel like we were missing out on something.  I eliminate all distractions and let people know that.  If they want to help in some way, I will find a use for them but otherwise I am in Mama Bear survival mode an it is all business right now. <br/>
Mantra&#39;s help me also.  This too shall pass has always been a good one when things are stressful.<br/>

i definitely need some whistle while you work friends around, just no one  <br/>
seems to be available, i find more people on line that answer than irl. <br/>
everyone  seems to have stuff going on.  there have been a lot of good things to <br/>

<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make more misery for yourself than already is. Don&#39;t let worry about DHS being called keep you from asking for help to move your lives forward. Don&#39;t cripple yourself with fears of what might be. And if you are unable to get help in doing the things that need doing, roll up your sleeves and get it done as quickly and as painlessly as possible. <br/>
<br/>
It is easy, when you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, the stresses that seem to be piling up more and more and more, to shut yourself down into a place where you can&#39;t move forward. Or, it is hard to not be tempted to do so. Joanne made very good and practical suggestions. See if help is available and while looking, take solid steps toward getting all of the things taken care of that need to be taken care of. One box at a time, one step at a time. Small incremental steps toward getting all that you need done is better than eddying about in a place where you can&#39;t seem to do what you need to do. Make a molehill of your mountain. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846080031">It sounds like you have some other online places to go and chat. I have something that sometimes works for me. It wouldn&#39;t work on this group as this is unschooling discussion rather than general support but if you have a group or facebook where people are likely to usually be around to talk it might work.<br/>
What I do is go on and say today I really want to get xyz done so in a moment I&#39;m going to go and do x for half an hour followed by y for 15 mins and then I&#39;m going to make a cup of coffee and come back on here and tell you all I&#39;ve done it. Will you cheer me on? <br/>
Then when you go on to tell them you&#39;ve done it set a timer for 10-15 mins chat and at the end tell them what you are going to do next and so on. The chat is your reward/ boost and the group are your virtual cheer leaders.<br/>

If you really have a lot that needs to be done, set a timer. Give yourself a few online minutes in the morning to mentally prepare yourself for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea -- Try to find people that can help outside of the &quot;normal&quot; school hours. Your daughter&#39;s being home might not come up if it&#39;s a time of day when most kids are home (evenings and weekends).<br/>
