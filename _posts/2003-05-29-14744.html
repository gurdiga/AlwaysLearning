<div id="ygrps-yiv-717211292">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
DD Kree had an ear infection last week and had to go to the doctor for ear <br/>
drops. She gets one every year at this time, when swimming season begins. While <br/>
we were there the doctor who saw her, not her regular doctor, stated that her <br/>
shots needed to be updated. Apparently 7th grade shots that are standard in <br/>
California. I&#39;ll admit that as babies, I did do the standard round of shots, but <br/>
now that we have changed our lifestyle and I have so many medical issues of <br/>
my own, I am constantly looking at pros and cons regarding side effects and <br/>
overall betterment when it comes to drugs. So I am at a crossroads, Kree was very <br/>
concerned at the doctor stating these shots were &quot;needed&quot;. I don&#39;t feel they <br/>
need these shots, but am unsure where to go for the info where the bias is not <br/>
toward automatically getting your child immunized. I have a compromised <br/>
immune system and it is believed to have a strong genetic link in my family. They <br/>
twins have not been diagnosed, but both have strong symptoms that makes me <br/>
worry about it enough to wonder if by having them immunized, could it ultimately <br/>
compromise them later. I know this is not a medical posting list, but I trust <br/>
that the parents here are well versed in thinking outside the box and figured <br/>
you all would give me some heads up. Plus I know everyone here does their <br/>
homework when it comes to their children. That&#39;s the part of this list I love the <br/>
most. <br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>

<br/>
They also used to carry a book - or maybe I got it at our local bookstore, <br/>
that had information on the pluses, minuses and general concerns of each of <br/>
the vaccines.  I&#39;ll see if I can find it, but I think it&#39;s gone and buried <br/>
itself somewhere...  It was enormously helpful - although it&#39;s not if I <br/>
can&#39;t come up with the name/author!<br/>
<br/>
While I usually embrace &#39;western medicine&#39; in general, I didn&#39;t vaccinate <br/>
my second child at all, and stopped the first child at about 2 years old, <br/>
simply because of the dramatically bad reactions she had to the vaccines <br/>
and my own tendency to contract almost everything I was vaccinated against <br/>
(except, so far, polio.)  It&#39;s a personal decision every parent has to make <br/>
for themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538176078">Rhonda, <br/>
I have that mothering book and another I think.  I can bring to coffee <br/>
tonight or<br/>
next park day.  My main reason for not vaccinating was my concern for <br/>
possibly <br/>
compromising the immune system and to a much lesser degree vaccine<br/>
injury and toxicity. The web sites referred to you are probably much more up <br/>
to date<br/>
than the books that I have but probably still worth reading.  <br/>
