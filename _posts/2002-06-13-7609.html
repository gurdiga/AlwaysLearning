<div id="ygrps-yiv-530268063">I don&#39;t have time to go back and highlight all of the questions, so <br/>
I&#39;ll try <br/>
to answer everything as well as I can....<br/>
I&#39;m in Florida. The law here states that a person must be at least 14 <br/>
years <br/>
of age to apply for the permit. You study certain books that cover <br/>
Hawks and <br/>
Falcons, medications and diseases, equipment, state law etc..... and <br/>
take a <br/>
test with the local Fish and game person.  That makes you licensed to <br/>
own one <br/>
bird, I believe only two different species as your choices. Very <br/>
limited. <br/>
Also, you need a master falconer that agrees to sponsor you, which I <br/>
now have.<br/>
Side note: the guy I found to be my sponsor (found him online) just <br/>
happens <br/>
to be from the same town I am, and we were in HS at the same time!! <br/>
Too <br/>
bizarre when you figure the odds of two Fairbanksans being in <br/>
Pensacola! And <br/>
a strange hobby to boot....<br/>
Anyway, Your sponsor does all the hands on training. They teach you <br/>
how to <br/>
make your own equipment (saves a LOT of money) like the jesses <br/>
(teathers on <br/>
the ankles) and what not.  They make sure you know how to trap and <br/>
handle the <br/>
bird, train it properly (a daily affair) build correct facilities for <br/>
it, <br/>
medicate it etc....<br/>
There is a lot to learn.<br/>
After two years of owning a bird and being apprenticed, you are <br/>
considered a <br/>
&quot;general falconer&quot;. Five more years and you earn the title of &quot;master <br/>
falconer&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s a sport that takes a lot of patience as the bird needs daily <br/>
attention <br/>
and training. <br/>
During hunting season you are out in the field 3-4 times a week for 2-<br/>
3 hours.<br/>
The bird brings the kill to you and you have to prepare it. A lot of <br/>
it gets <br/>
frozen for feeding the bird later, but most people eat what the bird <br/>
catches <br/>
too.<br/>
You have to either raise or buy quail to feed your bird in addition <br/>
to the <br/>
hunting. This is not a sport for people that can&#39;t be home a lot!!<br/>
The cost is prohibitive unless your a do-it-your-selfer. Even then, <br/>
you have <br/>
to consider the fact that without telemetry (radio transmitters) you <br/>
may lose <br/>
a bird. Not a good idea.<br/>
Sometimes they get blown just far enough away that they can&#39;t find <br/>
their way <br/>
back to you. After all the weeks and weeks spent trapping and <br/>
training a good <br/>
bird, you don&#39;t want to lose them!!<br/>
My sponsor offered to let me use his receiver if I just buy the <br/>
transmitter <br/>
to start with.<br/>
The first bird I plan to trap is a red-tailed hawk. The facility I <br/>
have to <br/>
build is an 8x8x8 cube basically.  There are specific requirements <br/>
for the <br/>
size depending on what type of bird you have.  The perches, walls, <br/>
windows <br/>
etc... all have specifications in order to keep the bird from hurting <br/>
itself, <br/>
keep proper airflow and protection from wind, heat etc...<br/>
You need to make lures, jesses, hoods, tethers, special perches for <br/>
training <br/>
(like a ring perch), there is so much to do!! Oh, and I need to buy a <br/>
chest <br/>
freezer for the kill....I&#39;d hate to have frozen rabbits in my regular <br/>
freezer, ugh.<br/>
<br/>
I think a year is more realistic....my sponsor thinks I can do it <br/>
sooner.<br/>
We&#39;ll see.<br/>
Just having the permit will make me happy.<br/>
