<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218129918">Today&#39;s mail has been heavier than any week before this.  I dont want to <br/>
loser readers over the volume, but it was a pretty interesting day.<br/>
<br/>
By private e-mail I receive this (and some more I&#39;m not going to quote):<br/>
<br/>
-=-I really don&#39;t have to defend all of my statements that are tangential to<br/>
the thread. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I will ask that people not post anything on this list that they&#39;re not <br/>
willing to defend.<br/>
<br/>
We have enough to think about in the world with what is factual, or true <br/>
experience of someone or another, without things that nobody&#39;s willing to <br/>
defend.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, on my list people really do have to defend their statements, or back <br/>
off making them.  Because I don&#39;t want to lose readers just because one or <br/>
two or three people want to make unfounded assertions.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how many yahoo lists there are, but I bet there are 20 just on <br/>
unschooling and eclectic.  There are other places to go.<br/>
