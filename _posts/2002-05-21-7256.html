 </span></blockquote>We have a Portlander staying with us this week.  He<br/>
says in Portland there are two seasons: Warm Drizzle<br/>
Season and Cold Drizzle Season.  Occassionally they<br/>
are interrupted by sun, real rain, or a hard freeze,<br/>
depending on the season.  I have been to Portland a<br/>
number of times and really like the town, but have to<br/>
agree about the weather.  We live on the Eastern side<br/>
of the Olympic Peninsula now, the sunny side of the<br/>
Olympic Mountains.<br/>
