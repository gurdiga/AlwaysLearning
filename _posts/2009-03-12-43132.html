<div id="ygrps-yiv-446687716">hi,<br/>
the other day i was given a compliment about my children that they seemed more animated and alive than a whole class of children. this was a great confidence booster for me.  today i was told that two of my children have smiles on their faces all of the time.  <br/>
i would like to ask does it matter where your children&#39;s interests lie.  my children do not lean towards any one area of interest eg.  i know a few people who say that their child is into for example dogs and knows every breed of dog and it&#39;s markings etc.  i also have other friends who say their children are really into for example a particular period in history etc.  we go to lots of different places like the other day when we went to Isaac Newton&#39;s house and tomorrow we are going to a dance performance.  we had a play day at a soft play area today.  i try to offer varied things they can take or leave and they mostly enjoy it when we go places.  when we are home we chat about anything and everything, watch tv and dvds, computer etc. BUT does it matter that they prefer Club Penguin, acting out the panto my dd starred in, over and over and just hanging with me AND that they don&#39;t know all about Romans in-depth.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have three kids. One was always into all things artistic - but I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t say she was &quot;knowledgeable,&quot; more that that was what she most <br/>
loved to do (along with other stuff). My middle child IS a kid who <br/>
always delved deeply into her passionate interests and she seems to soak <br/>
up detailed knowledge like crazy. She is one who people might think <br/>
knows everything there is to know about -- name the subject. &lt;G&gt; My <br/>
younger one is more of a dabbler/sampler - she enjoys lots of things, is <br/>
very happy, doesn&#39;t separate learning from living. Her passions tend to <br/>
be physical activities - karate and soccer these days.<br/>
<br/>
This is at 18, 21, and 24. When they were younger, they played with <br/>
their American Girl Dolls - played Star Trek a lot. Swam in the pool <br/>
every day for about 8 hours all summer. Watched tv. Played video games. <br/>
All good!<br/>
<br/>
You sound fine. Enjoy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760156763">My daughter Lanora (18) tends to concentrate on one thing at a time, her<br/>
most constant passion has been drawing.  Jonathan (11) tends to concentrate<br/>
on the computer but dabbles in many things via that tool.  I have always<br/>
been a dabbler in many things, perhaps due to this I can&#39;t claim to be an<br/>
&quot;expert&quot; in any field but what it gave me was enough knowledge on almost any<br/>
subject to learn more.  I can start a good search based on what I already<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
I think we learn what is important to us and the most valuable thing we can<br/>
possess is confidence that we can find the information we need.  I think you<br/>
stated the important thing about your kids, they are happy and feel free to<br/>
indulge their desire to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211244210">My oldest has a tendancy to get very intested in things and kind of delve into them. He is 7.  But he doesnt learn lots of facts and stuff to rattle off, he just enjoys the things.  My other kids just enjoy life and move from interest to interest.  Right now, sports are big around here (soccer and gymnastics primarily).  A few years ago it was vikings and pirates.  We just got rock band and so that is a big thing and honestly we have spent several days doing little else.. although they havnt gotten it out today yet.<br/>
<br/>
I have at times worried about the fact that my kids dont know their birthdays or the months of the year for example.  But then we move on.</div>

Holly was particularly interested in the Great Depression for a while,  <br/>
and I suppose she&#39;ll be collecting more information on it for the rest  <br/>
of her life, and making more connections.  There&#39;s no hurry.  She  <br/>
might have learned all she&#39;ll ever learn about it, and that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
Your description of your days sounds great to me!<br/>

I wrote something about WWII once, and am looking for it.  Not about  <br/>
WWII, but a response to a mom who said her son didn&#39;t care about  <br/>
anything except WWII.<br/>
<br/>
++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
Can one intense interest come to represent or lead to all others? A  <br/>
mom once complained that her son was interested in nothing but World  <br/>
War II. There are college professors and historians who are interested  <br/>
in nothing but World War II. It can become a life&#39;s work. But even a  <br/>
passing interest can touch just about everythingâ€”geography, politics,  <br/>
the history and current events of Europe and parts of the Pacific,  <br/>
social history of the 20th century in the United States, military  <br/>
technology, tactics, recruitment and propaganda, poster art/production/ <br/>
distribution, advances in communications, transport of troops and food  <br/>
and supplies, espionage, prejudices, interment camps, segregation,  <br/>
patriotism, music, uniforms, insignia, religion....<br/>
<br/>
When someone really understands one war, he can easily understand  <br/>
another, because he will have all the framework and questions in his  <br/>
mind. When he understands how countries are born, invaded, and how a  <br/>
government can die out, he understands truths about all nations and  <br/>
civilizations.<br/>

<br/>
I often hear &quot;she&#39;s so sweet&quot; and &quot;she&#39;s so smart&quot; about my dd, from  <br/>
people out in the world, when we are out in the world (which doesn&#39;t  <br/>
happen too often these days - she&#39;s quite the homebody right now).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have thought about this recently. Michelle is 14 now and has  <br/>
definite preferences of what she wants to do and think about. They  <br/>
don&#39;t always have much to do with things we did when she was younger.  <br/>
However, one constant for her has been a fascination with animals.<br/>
<br/>
That early interest has evolved into a huge collection of stuffed  <br/>
animals, computer games (Zoo Tycoon, Impossible Creatures) clay  <br/>
sculpture of animals, horse riding, playing a hunter in World of  <br/>
Warcraft (because they have pets &lt;g&gt;), reading novels that feature  <br/>
animals (Warriors, Guardians of Ga&#39;hoole, Silverwing series),  <br/>
collecting Zoobooks, watching Animal Planet, and delving into anime  <br/>
and manga that have an animal focus, just to name a few.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s learned to read, type, spell and punctuate correctly; to read  <br/>
maps; to sculpt beautifully; to add, subtract, figure out percentages  <br/>
and estimates; to appreciate music (the Broadway version of The Lion  <br/>
King&#39;s songs and the music written and performed expressly for games  <br/>
like WoW, for example); to learn some Japanese; and to host funshops  <br/>
at conferences, all as a result of that continuing interest. But it&#39;s  <br/>
not all in-depth or even about knowledge (though there&#39;s that, too).  <br/>
It&#39;s about what makes life fun and happy for her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I facilitated her love of animal stuff, because it&#39;s led her  <br/>
in so many directions, some of which I didn&#39;t expect. I could have  <br/>
tried to funnel her into being a vet or volunteering at shelters or a  <br/>
starting a dog-walking service. I see many parents trying to turn  <br/>
their child&#39;s passion into something &quot;worthwhile.&quot; But, I think it  <br/>
would have limited her if I&#39;d put her in a &quot;this is what animal lovers  <br/>
do&quot; box. She&#39;s taken it where she wanted it to go.<br/>
