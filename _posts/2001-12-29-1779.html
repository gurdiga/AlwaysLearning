<div id="ygrps-yiv-464236807">I&#39;ve uploaded a photo of the Vilter family. I spent some time looking for<br/>
one that was taken in this century and couldn&#39;t find one we all liked so we<br/>
took this one today.  Sandra, thanks for motivating us. Now I have something<br/>
to send my brothers and friends.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all of you who have posted photos. It is very nice to have a picture<br/>
to connect the names to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72038644">That&#39;s a very nice picture of the three of you, Dan!  You guys are just <br/>
as I remembered you.  <br/>
<br/>
I put one up of Will, when he still had all his baby teeth, from July <br/>
4th (usual pose for loud noises--fingers in the ears).  Didn&#39;t have one <br/>
of all of us available, but maybe I&#39;ll get one in soon.  Or not.  :)<br/>

OH NO.  Mine is over four months old.  Now I need a newer one than Dan&#39;s.  <br/>
Then someone will put up a webcam link so THEIRS can be the most current.  <br/>

Ok it just dawned on me who you guys were!  Sometimes I don&#39;t pay much<br/>
attention to names/screen names LOL.  It&#39;s Kathy here &lt;waving arms <br/>
wildly&gt; who organized the September Refugio campout!  Great family<br/>
pic! Good to see you!<br/>
<br/>
 Just got a digital video camera that takes still photos so hopefully<br/>
sometime in the near future I can get a pic of our family up on the site.<br/>
