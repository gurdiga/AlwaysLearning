<div id="ygrps-yiv-990504863">I and my sons found these in-crowd behavior difficult to deal with at <br/>
first.  They have never been to ps. They wouldn&#39;t qualify as christian <br/>
also.  But they have been bullied by christians in a  home schooling <br/>
group, we obviously don&#39;t belong to any more.<br/>
  <br/>
I have seen children who have just been pulled out of the school system <br/>
behaving that way.  They are , at times, rude and cruel, and attempt to <br/>
create a separation, a group, an in-crowd, like the ones they were <br/>
familiar with.  So it is them versus the rest of the kids for a while. <br/>
 Some times it take them months to get back, to what they were probably, <br/>
before they entered the school system.  But you can see the <br/>
transformation over the months.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad my sons were not brought up with values based on what you wear, <br/>
the apparent color  you might be, the length of the hair, your culture <br/>
or religion.  They are more apt to adapt to a wide variety of people and <br/>
can relate to others , perhaps in more depth. How you behave as a human <br/>
being becomes more important than your  perceived status.<br/>
This is a good thing , also, because although my sons are rather <br/>
conservative ( more or less, whaterver that mean) in their out-look, <br/>
their mother doesn&#39;t like to be.  Considering our mix bag  of ancestors <br/>
( french, english, two different groups of natives, irish, scotish, <br/>
belge...)  we don&#39;t fit in an ethnic group either.  I&#39;m definitely <br/>
grateful for that.<br/>
Friendship<br/>

&gt;&gt;When I put Brianna in public school, for grade 1, it was hell! She didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;have the same &#39;values&#39; the kids in class had. One of the girls told her <br/>
&gt;&gt;that<br/>
&gt;&gt;she should have blonde highlights in her hair, that she would be &quot;hot&quot;.<br/>
&gt;&gt;A boy told her she was too tall to be pretty,<br/>
&gt;&gt;She was told that I was a bad parent because I worked from home.<br/>
&gt;&gt;She was told that I was a lesbian because I have no husband.<br/>
&gt;&gt;She didn&#39;t dress right. They made fun of her.<br/>
&gt;&gt;She&#39;s not a Christian. They hit her.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have two boys in our play group what went to public school prior to <br/>
&gt;homeschooling and they have such a &quot;girls vs boys&quot; attitude.  My boys don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;even understand that concept.  &quot;why can&#39;t we all play together.&quot;  Most of the <br/>
&gt;children have never been to ps.  I find that refreshing.  My boys aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt;picked on because of their long hair etc.<br/>

Yes.  The unschooling group we used to have &quot;socialized&quot; several boys who <br/>
came out of school swingin&#39; at anyone and any thing.  When they figured out <br/>
the unschoolers honestly just wanted them to be themselves they settled out <br/>
and got happy and mellow.<br/>
