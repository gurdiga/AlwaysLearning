<div id="ygrps-yiv-712923430">We were up at five AM.<br/>
Dylan&#39;s father is a heavy equipment operator.  Today he had a job running<br/>
a delimber.<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know, a delimber sits on tracks or a flat bed and has<br/>
a long boom with front and back grapple hooks, a swinging butt plate and<br/>
a front and rear saw.  It is designed to pick up trees, remove all the<br/>
limbs and cut the log to the proper length.   <br/>
It was an interesting job because it was a local private land owner who<br/>
has a select cut every year and it was located in Gold Creek, MT.  site<br/>
of an 1862 gold dredging operation that left huge, vast mounds of river<br/>
rock for miles and miles.   At the time of the gold discovery the<br/>
landscape was decimated by gold mining operations. <br/>
Douglas fir and lodge pole have been growing there for about 102 years<br/>
now.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a low impact select cut which means, basically, not a clear cut. <br/>
The land owner is not a lumber corporation, but a fourth generation MT<br/>
native who uses the lumber sale to pay his property taxes.  <br/>
<br/>
All this said, you can&#39;t believe the mess.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan sat in and ran the delimber for about thirty minutes and he seems<br/>
to have his dad&#39;s skill at operating.  He said it was just like<br/>
Playstation. ( for those of you wondering what video games will do for<br/>
kids )   Then we watched his dad tear through this deck of trees ( the<br/>
trees were all hand felled and skidded into a pile )<br/>
while we talked about why someone would cut trees.  His dad can de limb,<br/>
cut and deck a log about every twelve seconds, for perspective.  While we<br/>
talked the truck driver showed up, in a self loader, to take the logs to<br/>
the mill.  He let Dylan climb into the loader seat, located above and<br/>
behind the cab, and swing the boom around.  He wouldn&#39;t let him load,<br/>
mumbling something about not wanting a log shoved through his cab.  We<br/>
watched him load logs onto his truck, which he did in thirty minutes,<br/>
start to finish.  Dylan sang the Lumberjack song from Monty Python to his<br/>
dad over the radio. <br/>
<br/>
We counted rings on logs.  The oldest tree we found was seventy two, a<br/>
Douglas fir, about twenty four inches in diameter. <br/>
<br/>
We climbed the mounds of boulders from years of dredging.  We talked<br/>
about gold and greed and impact and reclamation.  We had a fir cone<br/>
fight.  We saw a rattle snake, we saw white tail deer who are so nosey<br/>
they came right to the deck to check us out.  We saw bear scat, but no<br/>
bear.   We hiked,  we rode in a log truck,  we had a memorial ceremony<br/>
for the dead trees.  We found a mouse head with no mouse.   We found a<br/>
shady bank of snow and made angels.  We pulled wood ticks off our socks. <br/>
We climbed on the remains of an old sluice and part of the original<br/>
dredge, now half submerged in a dredge pond.   We found a cow skull.  <br/>
<br/>
When we came home we ate peanut butter and jelly and went to Karate where<br/>
Dylan sparred everyone in the class, and learned a new kata.  He talked<br/>
with his instructor about Ki and they tested each other&#39;s inner strength<br/>
in a game where all the students line up one behind the other and try to<br/>
push over one student who is focusing his Ki.  <br/>
<br/>
He came home and found a package from friends in Arkansas filled with<br/>
dried mushrooms, okra, mud dauber nests, persimmon seeds, acorns, sweet<br/>
gum seeds, organic popcorn  and pictures of salamanders.  <br/>
<br/>
He wrote an e-mail to the green party, which he joined two months ago,<br/>
and volunteered to collect signatures for a ballot initiative to buy back<br/>
Montana&#39;s hydro electric plants.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s eating popcorn and watching Spartacus.  He says he wants a chariot<br/>
for his tenth birthday, or a sling shot.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost 8:30 PM on a day that started with only a vague plan to be at<br/>
the dojo on time.   We have no plans for tomorrow  but it will be worlds<br/>
better than a desk and math book, what ever it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018967019">That was one big damned AWESOME day!! <br/>
I really enjoyed reading that.  I bet your kids slept like stones after that <br/>
much mental stimulation.  (Slept like LOGS!!!)<br/>
<br/>
I love those days, when you wake up and stretch and life takes you off on <br/>
some swirly ride.  But this big logging day with the karate dessert was an <br/>
especially sweet one!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990845605">Deb L., that was an entertaining post.  Thanks for telling us about your <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Do you live anywhere near Bozeman by chance?<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who recently moved there to be part of an intentional <br/>
community.  She moved from Arkansas, so those two things kind of melded <br/>
together from your post.  She has a young son and a baby, and I&#39;m sure <br/>
she&#39;s looking for some other unschooling folks to hook up with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021331655"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Do you live anywhere near Bozeman by chance?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m about 95 miles from Bozeman and we there a few times every year to<br/>
the Museum of the Rockies, and Lewis and Clark Caverns.   <br/>
<br/>
We have a Montanaunschoolers e-mail group ( yahoo ) she&#39;d be welcome to<br/>
join.   There are only about 15 or so on the list, but it&#39;s an active<br/>
list and we talk about everything.  There are a lot of interesting folks<br/>
on this list and several &quot;rabid&quot; unschoolers as one likes to call<br/>
herself.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally know anyone else unschooling in Bozeman but maybe<br/>
someone on our list does.  I&#39;ll ask.  I know there&#39;s a big group of<br/>
Christian homeschoolers there.  <br/>
<br/>
Please give her my e-mail address if you think she&#39;d like it.  <br/>
<br/>
We have some land in Arkansas, in Newton county, and my husband was just<br/>
down there looking things over.  He went to a big mushroom planting part<br/>
(no not THAT kind of mushroom )  and is now inspired to grow some here. <br/>
Might be interesting.<br/>
