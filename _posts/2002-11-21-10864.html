<div id="ygrps-yiv-434723479">I am Anglo and grew up in an Anglo world with few interactions with ethnic<br/>
groups.  I think there were maybe 3 black families in the county I grew up<br/>
in.  The Hispanics were mainly migrant workers who kept pretty much to<br/>
themselves.  I grew up in a family where &quot;n---er&quot; jokes were common place.<br/>
I never agreed with it but didn&#39;t think much of it, just good old boys<br/>
goofing around, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Then I adopted my kids.  Adriane is Anglo, Zach is Anglo and Hispanic,<br/>
Marsie is Hispanic, Danny is Hispanic and Michelle is Black/Hispanic/Anglo.<br/>
The first time I heard a racist comment after we got Zach, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
breathe.  I realized, possibly for the first time, that someone really,<br/>
REALLY did think less of him because of his genetics.  I have to say that<br/>
stuff I hear about blacks now really scares me.  There really are people,<br/>
lots of people not just  a few nuts in white capes, that truly think<br/>
Michelle is less than human.  That it would be ok to hurt her or at least it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be any big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I used to blow off ethnic groups complaining about a joke that some<br/>
politician made or some black guy complaining that the police discriminated<br/>
against him.  I used to think &quot;oh please, give it a rest already. Most<br/>
crimes are committed by blacks, so what?&quot;  Now it scares me and infuriates<br/>
me.  Because now they aren&#39;t talking about some &quot;other&quot;, they are talking<br/>
about people I love.<br/>
