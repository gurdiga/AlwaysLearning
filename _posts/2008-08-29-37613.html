<div id="ygrps-yiv-350856738">We are back in the rut again with my daughter Allie.  She has been <br/>
crying today because she has no friends and is bored and lonely.  The <br/>
last time I wrote about this was in early April.  (see message at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/33996">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/33996</a> )<br/>
<br/>
She is now talking about public school again.  She thinks it&#39;s the <br/>
only place to find friends.  I believe she feels that way because of <br/>
compulsory attendance.  She hasn&#39;t had much luck hanging out with <br/>
friends outside of school but she sees them every day in school.<br/>
<br/>
She wants to hang out with friends, specifically girls around her age <br/>
not necessarily her exact age.  She has met 2 unschoolers who live <br/>
about 30 mins. away but they haven&#39;t wanted to hang out with Allie <br/>
lately.  She&#39;s completely given up hope that they will ever want to <br/>
see her again because it&#39;s been about 7 weeks.  I certainly have no <br/>
ill feelings toward them.  My heart hurts for Allie though.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s in cheerleading right now.  She practices 3 nights a week and <br/>
has saturday games.  That will last through the first week of <br/>
November.  She says it&#39;s not the same as being with friends though.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t find any homeschool classes around us.  The classes at the <br/>
local parks & recreation dept. for her age are either dance or art, <br/>
and she isn&#39;t interested in either.  She was taking piano lessons <br/>
last year but it was one on one with an adult teacher so even if she <br/>
starts back, which she is considering, it&#39;s not an activity that <br/>
leads to friendships.  She learned to knit at a local shop but it was <br/>
all adults.  She did taekwondo a few years ago and earned a black <br/>
belt but no friends.  She tried basketball and didn&#39;t like it so <br/>
isn&#39;t in trying other sports.<br/>
<br/>
She shares a room with her sister, dd16 Claire.  But she says that <br/>
isn&#39;t the same as a friend, either.<br/>
<br/>
While showing me her pros and cons list and talking about enrolling <br/>
this week, I reminded her of why she left the last time.  It didn&#39;t <br/>
turn out well.  She cried because I wasn&#39;t as enthusiastic as as <br/>
her.  I just see so many bad things about doing this yet again.  <br/>
<br/>
Last April when she was feeling this way, we found weekly summer day <br/>
camps beginning in early June.  She eagerly anticipated those camps <br/>
and absolutely loved them.  Her last one was in late July though.  So <br/>
it&#39;s been a month and she&#39;s bored and restless again.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do to help her.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter 11 starting cheering about 3 years ago.  She&#39;s on a<br/>
competitive team (where they travel and do competitions) and it last<br/>
year round.  In fact she&#39;s been with the same group of girls for 2 years<br/>
(she was on a rec team the first year).  Anyway, they have really bonded<br/>
and she has made some good friends this way.  They do pool parties, pot<br/>
lucks and those that she&#39;s made close friendships with she has sleep<br/>
overs and playdates with.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s an idea??  If she likes it, that would be a way to do it<br/>
all year?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my daughters team at one of their competitions last year (they&#39;ve<br/>
improved immensely this year and I&#39;ll post one of those when we get it<br/>
downloaded!  Sorry my video taping is not the best quality!<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TETL7mk7PA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TETL7mk7PA</a><br/>
<br/>
But this cheerleading has been GREAT for Lydia!  She is so dedicated and<br/>
works so hard.  In fact, she just got her backhandspring this year.  She<br/>
worked on this for almost a year.  The little (shorter) ones, the<br/>
backhandspring came so quickly for them but for tall, lanky Lydia is was<br/>
hard work.  But she was determined.  In fact, I was sooo impressed by<br/>
her determination.   I know she can do anything she sets her mind to!<br/>
[:)]<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have much of an unschooling community in our area but there are<br/>
quite a few homeschoolers and quite a few unschool friendlies.  For my<br/>
son, I started a boys club.  A monthly (which were gonna move it up to<br/>
bimonthly) time for the boys to get together and do fun stuff (creek<br/>
stomping, bowling, survival skills classes, fossil park hunts,<br/>
woodworking, etc.)  If you&#39;re not finding groups that fit for your<br/>
daughter, start one yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Lydia started school this year thinking it would meet more of her social<br/>
needs.  I don&#39;t think it is, but she&#39;s not giving up yet.  Personally, I<br/>
think it&#39;s taking away from them (she is just worn out when the day is<br/>
over) but she&#39;s beginning to see that!<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas, start a book club, movie club, rollerskating day/night,<br/>
park day, art club, game club, dance club!  Last year Lydia couldn&#39;t get<br/>
enough parties in her life so she started her own &quot;club clone&quot;.  She<br/>
tried to do it monthly but (we really are BUSY) it ended up being<br/>
bimonthly.  She had a crazy hat party, a toga party, a 70&#39;s party, and I<br/>
can&#39;t even remember what else!  Nothing big, just some games, chips, pop<br/>
and she would have a blast decorating the basement, making food and<br/>
picking music!<br/>
<br/>
What about girl scouts, 4-H, roots and shoots  or a club like that?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s late and my brain is fading!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

common.   When Lydia was about 10 her and her unschool buddies and<br/>
homeschool friends each started becoming more independent and interest<br/>
changed.  It&#39;s not that Lydia doesn&#39;t care for her friends, it&#39;s just<br/>
they don&#39;t have much in common and have very different personality<br/>
styles.  So, maybe seeking out kids with similar interest?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are at least 3 gyms around the area that offer gymnastics and <br/>
cheerleading.  Allie did try gymnastics at one of them but left after <br/>
a few weeks.  She got frustrated that she couldn&#39;t do a cartwheel <br/>
while the other girls were moving beyond that skill.  Her strengths <br/>
are her attitude and spirit.  She cheers at the local public park <br/>
that doesn&#39;t require athletic ability.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here&#39;s my daughters team at one of their competitions last year<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They look fabulous!  I bet she loves it!  My daughter loves the cheer <br/>
bowl the public park does each year.  She loves to base for stunts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on my local homeschooling groups and can&#39;t find many people <br/>
in my area who have children my age.  It seems most of them are under <br/>
the age of 6.  I&#39;ve asked Allie if she&#39;d like to go to one of the <br/>
park days they offer but she declines.  There are some cool things <br/>
happening outside our area but the drive is just too much.<br/>
<br/>
I am listening to your suggestions and trying to find a way to make <br/>
something work.  I really don&#39;t want to be negative and have an <br/>
excuse for every suggestion.  I know that doesn&#39;t help me.  Bottom <br/>
line is that I have a 10 year old daughter who wants to be with other <br/>
girls but who is turning away from all my suggestions.  <br/>
<br/>
I got a new job a couple of weeks ago working part-time.  I have <br/>
talked with her wondering if my being away from home is bothering <br/>
her.  It does, to a point.  And I have asked management to reduce my <br/>
hours to 3 hrs. a day (which would mean I&#39;d be home before she even <br/>
wakes up for the day) or accept my resignation.  Allie says it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t matter if I was home all day again.  She says &#39;no offense <br/>
mom, but you&#39;re not a girl like me&#39;.  <br/>

Nobody is going to &quot;find&quot; you if you&#39;re sitting at home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Too much to support a lonely child? I don&#39;t know what your &quot;too much&quot;  <br/>
is - but it might be that you have to step outside your own comfort  <br/>
zone a little more. I&#39;m making a 2 1/2 hour drive each way this week  <br/>
to take my daughter to spend the day with a friend.  Her two closest  <br/>
friends live about 40 miles away - in opposite directions. Maybe you  <br/>
need to reassess what you&#39;re willing to do?<br/>
<br/>

there other things going on that are bringing your energy and  <br/>
positivity down a little? Are you more tired than usual from working,  <br/>
maybe? Or did you start working because of financial problems and is  <br/>
that worrying you? I was glad to see you say the above about not being  <br/>
negative - glad you&#39;re aware of that possibility!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bottom  line is that I have a 10 year old daughter who wants to be  <br/>
&gt; with other<br/>
&gt; girls but who is turning away from all my suggestions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is just the right time to join 4H or Girl Scouts or Campfire Boys  <br/>
and Girls. The YMCA&#39;s have what used to be called Indian Maidens -  <br/>
they&#39;ve changed the name and I can&#39;t remember the new one - but that&#39;s  <br/>
a mother-daughter social group.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you do - help her understand that friends aren&#39;t made  <br/>
instantaneously. They develop over months, not minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I think the very hardest thing I ever have had to deal with as a  <br/>
parent is when my own child is being negative and not willing to &quot;even  <br/>
try&quot; suggestions that I offer in response to her own expressed  <br/>
desires. Sometimes kids need us to help them over some kind of &quot;hump&quot;  <br/>
that is looking insurmountable to them. This might be the case for you  <br/>
two, right now. You might need to both do something that gets you  <br/>
moving in a positive direction, even though that &quot;something&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>
look like &quot;the answer&quot; to your problems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has been true for us.  Chamille has only made a few connections<br/>
within the unschooling/homeschooling community of people.  When I<br/>
suggest doing things like park days, she doesn&#39;t like to go because she<br/>
knows that there will not be people she identifies with there. <br/>
Sometimes she goes with me and Margaux, but she isn&#39;t anticipating<br/>
finding anyone when she goes with us.  Sometimes her experience with<br/>
other homeschool girls has been really bad, it seems that you can&#39;t<br/>
entirely escape the bitchy girl deva hierarchy even in the homeschool<br/>
community, and this is what she intesely dislikes over ANY other social<br/>
thing.  If she catches even one whiff of that, she closes up entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has a couple of girl friends that she likes a lot, spends time<br/>
with on occasion, but they don&#39;t have a terrible amount in common.  It<br/>
does help ease loneliness.   Still, I know what she&#39;s feeling like not<br/>
having a core group of like-minded friends, even I would like that.  I<br/>
have that online it seems, and so does she.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when it feels discouraging, but we keep trying. <br/>
Sometimes it feels like hit and miss, with mostly missing, but unless<br/>
you keep at it, you&#39;ll never get there.  My sister was like this for<br/>
most of her life and she went to school surrounded with other kids, so<br/>
it could be a personality thing too, which I sense from Chamille<br/>
sometimes.  That need for like-minded individuals, but being so<br/>
different from other people, it&#39;s hard to actually find them because<br/>
they are so rare.  A lot of people thought my sister was snotty, but<br/>
really she just had a really high standard of who she wanted to spend<br/>
her time with, not just anyone would do, so she was with herself and her<br/>
thoughts a lot, lonely, but not with people she knew she would be<br/>
annoyed with shortly.<br/>
<br/>
This is so like Chamille, however she&#39;s much more open to possibilities<br/>
and people, largely because she hasn&#39;t been forced to be with people she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to be with, like school did to my sister.  I see a direct<br/>
think to that, the way my sister closed up, and Chamille remains open<br/>
and friendly.<br/>
<br/>
One time Sandra said something very similar to the above, and I knew she<br/>
was right.  I had to stop looking in the homeschool arena, and look<br/>
elsewhere, which was less convenient and much harder.</div>

make friends despite the fact that people behave in certain ways  <br/>
naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Any of those behaviors can be avoided or amended, or overcome by  <br/>

most people.  She&#39;s really a very kind a gentle person, but within her,<br/>
she anguishes over social things like this.  She wants to fit in and<br/>
find her groove, but doesn&#39;t seem to connect to many.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-A lot of people thought my sister was snotty, but really she just<br/>
&gt; had a really high standard of who she wanted to spend her time with,<br/>
&gt; not just anyone would do-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t that the definition of (not a nice word, but...) &quot;snotty&quot;? (I<br/>
&gt; think &quot;snooty&quot; might be better. And snooty means looking down your<br/>
&gt; nose at others for whatever reason.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe.  It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t like people or that she felt people<br/>
were inherintly bad, or that she was too good for them.  It had more to<br/>
do with who she was willing to invest time and energy in and who she<br/>
wasn&#39;t.  I never viewed my sister as snotty or snooty, she was sad and<br/>
shy and didn&#39;t venture out socially into arenas that made her<br/>
uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time explaining this.  I do see similarities in<br/>
Chamille, only Chamille is more self aware and more open and receptive<br/>
and friendly.  I&#39;m very much not like this, so I am trying to explain<br/>
how this looks and feels based on what I&#39;ve seen.</div>

<br/>
My point is that it isn&#39;t a game.  It&#39;s natural human behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying, maybe, that she&#39;s not good at interpersonal  <br/>
situations?  She could use coaching or encouragement.  Telling her  <br/>
it&#39;s an irritating game she can opt out of doesn&#39;t seem helpful to me.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone whose life would be worlds better if her parents  <br/>
hadn&#39;t told her she was smarter than everyone else and that&#39;s why  <br/>
they didn&#39;t like her, because they were just jealous.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the words are yours or someone else&#39;s, you chose them to  <br/>
express the situation, so to some extent that is the way you perceive  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s young and might just not be ready to interact in those ways.  I  <br/>
think maybe having friends who are older and younger might help,  <br/>
instead of &quot;same age&quot; for a while.<br/>

Responding to myself.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s natural human behavior, but usually age and experience make the  <br/>
hierarchy clear and sensible.  When same-age kids are thrust together  <br/>
they create the hierarchy based on other things, which will end up  <br/>
seeming like bullying (or BEing bullying, in some cases).<br/>
<br/>
People are rarely equal in a situation, and the precedence changes  <br/>
depending on the activity and the situation and the people present.   <br/>
But that&#39;s not a game.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088384272"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You could say, &quot;I&#39;d like to go check it out if you&#39;re willing<br/>
&gt; to go along with me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That actually never occurred to me, but it sounds like a great idea. <br/>
And I could even go without her if it would help her feel like I&#39;d be <br/>
finding out ahead of time what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Too much to support a lonely child? I don&#39;t know what your &quot;too<br/>
&gt; much&quot; is - but it might be that you have to step outside your own<br/>
&gt; comfort zone a little more.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know!  I know!  I have great difficulty balancing the needs of <br/>
everyone in my family.  My son has a best friend who lives almost an <br/>
hour away.  It&#39;s not really the distance that makes the difference, <br/>
but rather how I can fit that activity in the family schedule.  And <br/>
yes, I know realize I wasn&#39;t opening myself to new activities that I <br/>
saw happening more than an hour away from my home.  And of course now <br/>
my job hours are going to interfere with the freedom of having the <br/>
whole day open.  After this coming week, I&#39;ll be working 11am to 2pm <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You&#39;ve sounded more &quot;flat&quot; and noticeably down lately, Beth. Are  <br/>
&gt; there other things going on that are bringing your energy and  <br/>
&gt; positivity down a little? Are you more tired than usual from<br/>
&gt; working, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;ve been tired from my lifestyle change.  Not only working <br/>
outside the home, I am still the transportation provider for most of <br/>
the kids activities.  My dd16 isn&#39;t a driver yet because she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to be and I don&#39;t want to rush her.  My working hours have me <br/>
getting home after 6:30pm and it&#39;s not been easy.  But I&#39;m changing <br/>
those hours to be more flexible.<br/>
<br/>
I started working because I wanted to pursue something that is really <br/>
dear to my heart.  I don&#39;t have alot of interests as I tend to have a <br/>
more narrow focus for my energies.  My son Jeffrey takes after me in <br/>
that respect.  I&#39;ve been very bored at home, just laying on the sofa <br/>
watching tv and playing on my laptop or reading books.  I absolutely <br/>
love little children.  I love singing kid songs and playing kid <br/>
games.  I love Dora the Explorer and Barney.  I love the alphabet and <br/>
simple counting, building block towers, playing with kitchen toys, <br/>
crawling on my hands and knees as pretend animals, and just generally <br/>
being immersed in a young child&#39;s world.  I got a job in a one-year <br/>
old room at a childcare center and I&#39;ve loved it!  But I&#39;ve also felt <br/>
guilty because I felt like I was putting my needs above my family&#39;s <br/>
needs.  My family has been supportive and thankfully the center is <br/>
also helpful in finding a work schedule that will be a happy <br/>
compromise for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes kids need us to help them over some kind of &quot;hump&quot;  <br/>
&gt; that is looking insurmountable to them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve been trying to do.  I believe she sees <br/>
school as her only possibility right now.  By yesterday afternoon, <br/>
she reached a point where she was no longer listening to my <br/>
suggestions and told me I wasn&#39;t being supportive of her desire to go <br/>
back into school.  So I made an appt. for Wed. morning to complete <br/>
the paperwork to get her back into school.  She&#39;ll start Thursday <br/>
morning.  My DH and I have talked and have a clear understanding that <br/>
she will stay as long as she wants to stay and knows she can come <br/>
home at any time.  My DH is the kind of person who feels that once a <br/>
decision like this is made, the person ought to stick it out.  So I <br/>
felt like I better be very clear that I wasn&#39;t going to go into this <br/>
with that attitude.  <br/>
<br/>
And Allie is very excited about school.  She went through her closet <br/>
yesterday to see what clothes she can wear and has made a list of <br/>
things she&#39;d like to purchase this weekend.  She&#39;s set her alarm <br/>
clock for this morning so she can begin waking up earlier each day.  <br/>
I guess there&#39;s still a part of me that is hoping she&#39;ll change her <br/>
mind by Thursday.  But I will be positive and supportive of her <br/>
choice and help her as she needs me, like I do with anything else she <br/>
shows an interest in doing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, true.  In an earlier post, I mentioned she had two unschooled <br/>
friends and someone else pointed out that friends didn&#39;t have to be <br/>
unschoolers.  Those were the only two friends she&#39;s made.  In the last <br/>
homeschool group we were in, the oldest girl was 3 years younger than <br/>
her.  There were a few little girls younger than that one.  It was <br/>
mostly boys who didn&#39;t like girls playing with them, much to Allie&#39;s <br/>
disappointment.  I feel that experience, along with not finding a <br/>
friend in the homeschool classes she took, has given her a bleak <br/>
outlook.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, she wants a friend that she can see at least twice a week <br/>
but would enjoy even more time than that.  School has been the only <br/>
place that has met that need of hers.<br/>
