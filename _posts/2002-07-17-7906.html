<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733325018">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for overreacting to what was really no big deal.  My coping skills <br/>
pretty much flew out the window yesterday when I learned that my brain tumor <br/>
has come back.  I know that&#39;s no excuse to be rude.  I guess I am just shaken <br/>
up a bit more than I realized.  I don&#39;t know what the future holds. Please <br/>
accept my apology.  <br/>

tumor three times and is coping very well and feeling positive?  I have no <br/>
idea whether she has email, but if you&#39;re interested, I could ask her.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know where you are, so I don&#39;t know if phone contact is feasible.<br/>

Thanks for your suggestion.  I&#39;m not quite ready for that at this point, but <br/>
I will let you know if/when it seems like it would be helpful.  What a great <br/>
idea, and how kind of you to think of it for me!  Right now I just need to be <br/>
still and try to absorb the blow this has been.  Thank you.<br/>
