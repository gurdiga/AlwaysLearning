&lt;&lt; But I am always fascinated by people who give up so much<br/>
of their own control. It seems to me to make life very easy. No decisions<br/>
are made by a person therefore they can never make any mistakes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with putting kids in public school.  <br/>
<br/>
We doom other families to a life of mistake-making. <br/>
<br/>
When/if a family believes that they have absolutely no option but to put <br/>
their child in school, then nothing that happens at or around school is their <br/>
fault.<br/>
<br/>
Once we let them know there&#39;s an option, even if they don&#39;t take it, they <br/>
become responsible.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a problem.  We remove the ignorance and therefore the bliss.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my sister&#39;s in law was really angry at our decision to homeschool.<br/>
  She later confessed that she saw it as a judgement of *her* parenting. <br/>
 She was really the only one judging her parenting.  We never gave it any<br/>
thought.<br/>
