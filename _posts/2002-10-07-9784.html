husband and four children in a chaotic little house in the opposite corner<br/>
of the country in Pensacola, Florida. She assists her husband in running a<br/>
decking company, works part-time for Estee Lauder, and occasioanlly sells a<br/>

things messy. Eclectic interests include falconry, kayaking, storytelling,<br/>
medieval times, and triathlon competitions.<br/>
<br/>
Born in Yakima, Washington, Nancy Basket began unschooling her children in<br/>
the early 70&#39;s. She took her youngest daughter out of public school<br/>
thereafter for as long as needed, thru high school. Nancy is an<br/>
artist-in-education in the Carolina&#39;s since 1990. She works in her 100 year<br/>
old barn built out of kudzu bales in Walhalla, SC.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer Deets is an unschooling mom of three young children. In her other<br/>
job as an assistant professor of education, she brings her unschooling<br/>
philosophy to her university courses hoping that future school teachers<br/>
might in some small (or large) ways experience the joys and benefits of<br/>
letting learning unfold according to the students&#39; needs and desires.<br/>
Jennifer uses photographs and scrapbooking in her efforts to capture and<br/>
share the diverse realities of unschooling in action.<br/>

juggling while on recess duty!<br/>

<br/>
After sending his son to private school for eight years, Ben Lovejoy and his<br/>
wife took a sharp LEFT turn and plunged head-first into unschooling. A<br/>
private school and military college (The Citadel) graduate with a military<br/>
background and an orderly sense of &quot;the way things should be done&quot;, Ben<br/>
seems---at first---an unlikely candidate for the unschooling lifestyle. A<br/>
full-blown convert, he&#39;ll share his journey into unschooling with you if you<br/>
just ask. When he&#39;s not riding his bike, you might find him selling drugs<br/>
for a living. <br/>

Presentations<br/>
<br/>
Hard Thinking Made Easy - Sandra Dodd<br/>
Sometimes people fear to think. Have you had many unauthorized thoughts?<br/>
Would you like to have many more? Think where no thoughts have gone before.<br/>
<br/>
Learning, Yes. Schooling, No Thank You - Luz Shosie and Ned Vare<br/>
We&#39;ll talk about how we unlearned years of schooling and trusted our son to<br/>
direct his own education. And we&#39;ll answer your questions about how<br/>
unschooling really works.<br/>
<br/>
My Parents Trusted me - Fiona Hutchison<br/>
My parents trusted me to live on my own in New York City as young as 13<br/>
years old. My &quot;schooling&quot; was extremely limited and relatively ignored (my<br/>
father used to say, &quot;F is for fantastic, my dear!&quot;), but my &quot;education&quot; was<br/>
rich and colorful and intense. I will give a brief account of my unschooling<br/>
life and then be happy to answer any questions you may have about a teen on<br/>
her own. I certainly don&#39;t have all the answers to how unschooling works,<br/>
but I can tell you what worked for me when I was given the freedom to pursue<br/>
my dreams<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling as Mindful Living - Anne Ohman<br/>
As an educational choice, unschooling has infinite benefits. Yet unschooling<br/>
can also bring so much more into our family&#39;s lives when we allow it to be<br/>
used on a greater scale - as a path to more mindful living. Come explore<br/>
Mindful Unschooling with Anne Ohman, and we&#39;ll discuss how to not only free<br/>
and empower your children through unschooling, but also bless your own life<br/>
in rewarding and enlightening ways.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling Changes - Lisa Bugg<br/>
The old adage, &quot;nothing remains constant but change&quot;, should be the maxim<br/>
for all unschoolers. Unschooling demands that we challenge our long held<br/>
beliefs about children and education. The changes we move through, while<br/>
welcome, are at times very stressful. And then, just when we think we have<br/>
our educational philosophy pinned down, the children change! Many<br/>
adolescents have sent their unschooling parents scurrying for support when<br/>
they come in and demand A PLAN. Your budding 8 year old, who still wants to<br/>
be a firefighter, turns around; and you discover a 17 year old who wants to<br/>
work in the matter-antimatter lab over at NASA. Let&#39;s talk about how<br/>
unschooling changes us, as we move through our ever-changing lives.<br/>
<br/>
Why You Can&#39;t Let Go - Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
Do you secretly lust after the perfect math program? Do you dog ear all the<br/>
pages in homeschooling catalogs and end up feeling guilty for not doing<br/>
enough? Do you sometimes envy the school at homers because they have it all<br/>
planned out for them? Let&#39;s talk about why packaged learning is so appealing<br/>
and explore some ways that may help you let go.<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Funshops <br/>
<br/>
Advanced Juggling- Ruth Glowacki<br/>
More of the same (Beginners Juggling), just a day&#39;s more experience!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At The Movies - Ben Lovejoy<br/>
Since learning is constant and doesn&#39;t fit neatly into a package nor is it<br/>
restricted to any one category, we all use what&#39;s most helpful to improve<br/>
our understanding of certain things. Using the movie, Dead Poet&#39;s Society,<br/>
Ben Lovejoy explores one of his passions, movies, to help dicuss how the<br/>
tenets of unschooling resonate throughout this intriguing piece of art.<br/>
Although we will be showing the video on Saturday night, please take the<br/>
time to watch the movie before you come to the conference. Look for those<br/>
parts of the movie which help you understand (or maybe further confuse you)<br/>
about unschooling. We intend to discuss those parts and more.<br/>
<br/>
Beginners Juggling - Ruth Glowacki<br/>
Learn the basics of juggling 1, 2, 3 (or more!) balls, clubs, beanbags, or<br/>
scarves.No experience necessary. Folks who can already juggle can pair up<br/>
and work on skills, tricks, routines,etc. (I bet we can get into the talent<br/>
show, eh?) Bring your own balls or bean bags, but I will have some to share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fun and Games on a Budget - Ren Allen<br/>
Get inspired with new ways to use old things! From common household items to<br/>
inexpensive craft store goodies, there are a lot of fun games, crafts, and<br/>
recipes to be made! Easy on the pocketbook, easy to make, and easy to clean<br/>
up (OK, the clean-up part is flexible!). From tangrams to unusual<br/>
sculptures, find out how to spark some good times in your home without<br/>
spending a lot. Great ideas for all ages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fun with Static Electricity - Dr. Kevin Dunn<br/>
In this workshop we will explore the nature of electricity. We will learn to<br/>
build simple electrostatic devices from commonly available materials. We<br/>
will discuss the design of a hand-operated electrostatic generator capable<br/>
of generating over 100,000 Volts. A kit will be available for building this<br/>
generator as well as instructions for building one from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
Gym&#39;n Around - Kelly&#39;s Gymnastics with Joe Mulero<br/>
Tumble, somersault, flip, and roll! Come have a ball with us as we play<br/>
around with gymnastics!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hand-spinning for Fun and Profit - Dr. Kevin Dunn<br/>
In this workshop we will explore principles fundamental to all textiles. We<br/>
will learn the history of spun fibers and woven cloth. We will learn to spin<br/>
yarn with a drop spindle and to weave belts with a card loom.<br/>
<br/>
Kudzu Papermaking for all ages - Nancy Basket<br/>
Kudzu is good for everything....food, clothing, building material, paper,<br/>
and baskets. Learn to make your own paper from kudzu and recycled junk mail.<br/>
Create cards for all occasions. Find out how to paint with paper, make<br/>
faces, bowls and quilt patterns!<br/>
<br/>
Mother Goose Rhymes: &quot;Oldies But Goodies&quot; - Nina Smith as Mother Goose<br/>
Mother Goose rhymes are shared by all English-speaking countries and have<br/>
passed the highest standard of quality literature - the test of time. Fun,<br/>
whimsical, and captivating, they have much to offer toward language<br/>
development in the young child. To the older child they present a myriad of<br/>
opportunities to advance them on their journey of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Native American Storytelling - Nancy Basket<br/>
Come hear stories of respect passed down from old to young for hundreds of<br/>
years. Learn Native American history of the area through ancient petroglyphs<br/>
(rock carvings). Unlearn stereotypes. Teach the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; - Nina Smith as Mother Goose<br/>
&quot;Once upon a time&quot; are magical words that open the doors of imagination and<br/>
set listeners on a journey into a world of enchantment, mystical encounters,<br/>
and formidable quests. Fairy tales have been told for hundreds of years and<br/>
are valued by cultures worldwide. They deal with universal themes and<br/>
ageless wisdom - there is far more to fairy tales than entertainment alone.<br/>
Research shows that frequent trips to the land of fairy tales and fantasy<br/>
help children become creative thinkers and problem solvers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Play with Your Food! - Alicia Yarbrough<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t play with your food!&quot; Many of us have grown up with that admonition.<br/>
But food (especially fruits and vegetables) is quite playful! At one time or<br/>
another, we&#39;ve all seen something other than the vegetable itself: a funny<br/>
face, a cute animal, a monster, a bug. Fruits and vegetables seem to invent<br/>
their own visual puns! Our goal will be to &quot;produce&quot; new images suggested by<br/>
the fruits and veggies themselves. We will look to be empowered to<br/>
create---to make art out of food. We will be using some &quot;tools of the<br/>
trade&quot;---knives and such, so please be sure that the younger child has an<br/>
adult by his side. <br/>
<br/>

Reluctant Husbands/Reluctant Fathers - Ben Lovejoy<br/>
Ben Lovejoy, recently an unschooling father and husband, facilitates a<br/>
roundtable discussion about the unique opportunities and challenges which<br/>
face fathers and husbands in an unschooling home. Topics intended for<br/>
discussion include: 1) Why unschooling?, 2) &quot;You&#39;re doing WHAT?&quot; and<br/>
numerous other questions from family and friends, 3) What about sports,<br/>
college, and other &quot;organized&quot; rites of passage into adulthood? 4) What do I<br/>
have to offer when their mom does all the fun things with the kids? and 5)<br/>
Whose life is it anyway? This discussion isn&#39;t just for fathers, husbands,<br/>
or males; nor is it intended to anwer all of our questions. It&#39;s merely a<br/>
discussion to help us all along our unschooling journey.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;That&#39;s Not Educational&quot; - Sandra Dodd<br/>

educational, you win a prize. Great tips for remembering that life is a<br/>
learning experience no matter what the day brings.<br/>
<br/>
UnEquilibrious Art: Junk Drawer Mobile Sculpture - Errol R. Alger<br/>
Participants will see how unidentified items from dad&#39;s tool box, or mom&#39;s<br/>
kitchen...or the contents of that one catch-all drawer that stays full of<br/>
dead batteries and spent rubber bands can become elegant works of kinetic<br/>
art! Students will learn that art is actually a balance (pun intended) of<br/>
science (in this case, the physical balance) and aesthetics (visual balance)<br/>
as we suspend say...a cheese grater next to a uh...hand saw so that they<br/>
begin a new life as space enhancing &quot;dancers&quot; in perhaps yellow and red. The<br/>
final product of this hands on (audience participatory) Funshop will be a<br/>
large graceful hanging sculpture made of brightly painted household &quot;found<br/>
objects.&quot; Bring your camera!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unweaving: Indoor Larger-Than-Life Soft Sculpture - Errol R. Alger<br/>
Participants will use a variety of fibers including rope, yarn, string and<br/>
ribbon to temporarily change a carefully selected portion of the Funshop<br/>
environment. &quot;Warp&quot; strings (the verticals) will be positioned from floor to<br/>
ceiling ahead of time to provide an &quot;anchor&quot; for horizontal line, texture<br/>
and color (a very loose definition for &quot;weft&quot;). The real &quot;product&quot; is a<br/>
dynamic one: the teaming process of individuals working together for the<br/>
visual enhancement of a given space. Bring your camera!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Within The Eye Of The Beholder - Christian Thee<br/>
A slide show illustrating Christian&#39;s work. Primarily in the art of Trompe<br/>
L&#39;oeil painting, but with some references to his theatrical background and<br/>
of course anecdotal references to some of his &quot;quirkier&quot; clients. Questions<br/>
are encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
What Unschooling Looks Like - Jennifer Deets<br/>
Explore ways to create scrapbook pages that capture what you do in your<br/>
daily unschooling lives. Learn how to use the same materials to document<br/>
different accomplishments. Learn also to see what your design and content<br/>
choices reveal about your views on education and learning. Please bring your<br/>
own pictures, postcards, letters, brochures, ticket stubs, etc. or<br/>
experiment with mine. Several sets of tools (scissors, adhesives, paper,<br/>
etc.) will be available, but you might want to bring your own as well.<br/>

Because this is an UNschooling conference, sometimes things may run over a<br/>
bit! We just might be too interested in something to quite let it go at the<br/>
scheduled time. We will try to run on schedule as much as possible but,<br/>
other than start times, we will not be ruled by the clock. Thanks for your<br/>
understanding!</div>
