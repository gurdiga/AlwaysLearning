Sandra, the thing is that it was never a comparison at all.  I was simply saying it was sad and we loved the chick, it was a life to us no less important then any other species and it made us sad.  It had no comparison to my son at all whom I adore and would do anything for.  Of course I love him more and value his life more.  You are reading into it the wrong way.  I apologize if my wording made it seem that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra&#39;s point, *the* relationship building point, is did your son  <br/>
believe that in the moments when you were addressing the chick and the  <br/>
cat with him?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s important isn&#39;t what Sandra&#39;s reading *into* it. What&#39;s  <br/>
important is what it looks and feels like from outside of you. Intent  <br/>
doesn&#39;t change what actions feel like to the other person. Which is  <br/>
why it&#39;s important that people not put a positive spin on a mom&#39;s  <br/>
actions and assume good intent. She needs to see what the child is  <br/>
experiencing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540246598">While growing up, when the cat (my cat, whom I adored) would get out, my Mom would react so strongly that I was sure she loved the cat more than she loved me.  So much so that I ran away from home at 8 years old. (Only for a few hours) And that was just over the cat being outside.  What you intend to say isn&#39;t as important as how your reaction is perceived.  You might not make the comparison, but your son just might.  <br/>
