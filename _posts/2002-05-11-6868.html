<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- More than 3,700 seniors at eight San<br/>
&gt; Fernando Valley high schools cannot take part in graduation ceremonies<br/>
&gt; unless their future plans include college, military service or trade<br/>
&gt; school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Officials in the Los Angeles school system&#39;s local District C in the<br/>
&gt; southwest San Fernando Valley defend the policy as a way to encourage<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; students to consider college or at least get them to think about the<br/>
&gt; future. But civil libertarians are calling the new policy elitist, and<br/>
&gt; students complain it violates their right to graduate before an audience<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; parents and friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t like it,&quot; said Kassie Finch, who said she got a letter of<br/>
&gt; acceptance from Pierce College so she can participate in the ceremony<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; will likely work at her mother&#39;s law office after graduation. &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt; if I&#39;m going to college or not.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Initial estimates show that up to 95 percent of District C seniors have<br/>
&gt; made a post-secondary commitment this year. Last year, without the<br/>
&gt; policy,<br/>
&gt; 54 percent took that step.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The policy basically says to our community that we hold very high<br/>
&gt; expectations of our graduates,&quot; said District C Superintendent Robert<br/>
&gt; Collins. &quot;Is the policy harsh? I don&#39;t think so at all. A harsh policy<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; when we ignore youngsters.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Holy shit!!! Those who are NOT doing further education need that graduation <br/>
ceremony more than anyone else!  If that&#39;s to be the height of their <br/>
formal-recognition life, they absolutely should get that whole cap and gown <br/>
extravaganza. <br/>
<br/>
What dipwads.  Those who are going to college don&#39;t need this; they&#39;ll surely <br/>
have a college graduation! &lt;g&gt;  Maybe that would be a better policy.  Those <br/>
going to college must commit to graduating and THAT will be their graduation. <br/>
 Others can have the high school graduation ceremony.<br/>

you don&#39;t get your high school diploma? Even if you pass all the exams?<br/>
At the end of high school in England, we take 3 &#39;Advanced level&#39; exams<br/>
and never see the school again. The results arrive by post. There&#39;s no<br/>
graduation. Thats saved for university and is optional even there. I<br/>
didn&#39;t go to mine. It was held 6 months after my degree finished and<br/>
was meaningless. I had my degree certificate so what was the point!<br/>
<br/>
What happens to home schooled kids? I&#39;m lucky in that mine plan to<br/>
take English A levels at some point and that is their pass to<br/>
university if they decide to go.<br/>

Every time the school systems do something like this I see a silver<br/>
lining, it&#39;s bound to open a few eyes.  Hopefully it will be the last<br/>
straw for some students who will understand how bogus it all was. <br/>
Hopefully it will be a catalyst to free them from the years of propoganda<br/>
and conditioning.  Maybe they&#39;ll even unschool their own children.<br/>

more kids give up on education. Whether we as a group like public school or<br/>
not, for some kids it&#39;s the only chance they have. It&#39;s terrible to take<br/>
that small opportunity away from them. <br/>

of the Sea in San Francisco) with those little plaid<br/>
skirts and everything.  She was an honor student with<br/>
very high grades all the way through.  But her widowed<br/>
mother of 4 could not afford to pay the last part of<br/>
her senior year tuition.  Money was tight at that<br/>
time.  So they refused to let her participate in her<br/>
graduation ceremony and withheld her diploma.<br/>

parents will raise enough of a protest that they system is forced to back<br/>
peddle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In most public schools, participation in comencement<br/>
exercises (graduation) is not mandatory.  The diplomas<br/>
are either mailed (often kids have gone on to other<br/>
things, already) or handed out personally, on request<br/>
at another date and time.  This avoids handing a<br/>
diploma to the wrong person....and discovering the<br/>
mistake later. <br/>
<br/>
Diplomas or participation in the ceremonies are<br/>
sometimes withheld for punitive reasons, but<br/>
graduation is still accomplished and can be confirmed<br/>
in other ways. I don&#39;t think it ever is, though.  I<br/>
don&#39;t believe anyone has ever actually checked to see<br/>
if I actually graduated in 1967. I was enrolled in<br/>
college prior to graduation.  So it may have been<br/>
ommitted, then, too.<br/>

I agree, the commencement ceremonies are not mandatory and are at times withheld. For instance, I was not permitted to attend graduation because I was 6 weeks pregnant. However I did get my diploma, which was mailed to me. Unfortunately for me, my diploma didn&#39;t mean anything. When I went to the Community College, they told me they didn&#39;t accept my diploma, I had to take the GED any way. What a waste of my time... going through all those classes only to be told my diploma wasn&#39;t worth the paper it was printed on.<br/>

waste of time?<br/>
Maybe standardised exams nationwide are a good idea in that <br/>
case. everybody knows what they mean and wherever you are in <br/>
the country you take the same exam paper and the grade you get <br/>
means the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;m against exams although i can&#39;t quite see what would <br/>
replace them until employers and universities look at you as a <br/>
person rather than how you did during 6 hours on a hot June <br/>
afternoon.<br/>
