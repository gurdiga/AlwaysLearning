&lt;&lt; Now, someone tell me:  What does math have to do with religion?  Who <br/>
<br/>
brought that up?  How could they possibly be related or connected to <br/>
<br/>
eachother? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d have to call myself an atheist -- though I&#39;m not entirely sure that&#39;s <br/>
what best describes my usual state of confusion -- so maybe I&#39;m not <br/>
particularly qualified to comment on this. But on the other hand, I am &quot;good <br/>
at math&quot; and I love it, and I find it is in many ways indistinguishable from <br/>
the spiritual beliefs I do have. Perhaps the closest I can come to a belief <br/>
in a god is believing in infinity.<br/>
<br/>
We can start smaller and simpler though, with one -- the sense of self, <br/>
wholeness, independence, perfection, unity, consciousness, existence, center, <br/>
and many other concepts that flow from oneness. Beyond one, the universe <br/>
unfolds in amazingly complex and beautiful relationships of number, position, <br/>
shape, space, time, motion, change and so on in patterns, cycles, rhythms and <br/>
vibrations. Math is the study of all that. Math IS all that. It is a way of <br/>
understanding what is within our grasp, and of imagining what is beyond. It <br/>
is (for me), in addition to the symbolic and practical, the philosophical as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Many civilizations have studied math to understand the sacred, and understood <br/>
math to be sacred in some respects. Religious art, symbolism, music and <br/>
architecture were often based on the &quot;perfect&quot; forms (geometry) found in <br/>
nature, perfect numbers (number theory), the mathematically determined <br/>
movement of heavenly bodies, etc. <br/>
<br/>
We tend to relegate math to commercial purposes, for the most part, or at <br/>
least to think of it in that limited aspect. I wonder if that&#39;s an inevitable <br/>
result of pretending that it exists apart from everything else in the world <br/>
so that we can teach it efficiently? &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked about books about math. I started to make a big long list, but <br/>
maybe it would be better to start with just a few.<br/>
<br/>
A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Constructing the Universe: The Mathematical Archetypes <br/>
of Nature, Art and Science by Michael S. Schneider -- This one is <br/>
fascinating, odd, passionate, and occasionally flawed. Schneider takes a <br/>
journey of the numbers from 1 to 10, exploring the secular, symbolic, and <br/>
sacred aspects of math along the way. It&#39;s heavy on the visual (geometric) <br/>
archetypes in nature, art, science and religion (which ranges from the <br/>
ancient to the new age). The book is full of interesting quotes and <br/>
illustrations, and is almost worth it for those alone.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics: The Science of Patterns by Keith Devlin -- Devlin has written a <br/>
number of books that are good introductions to math, but this one is <br/>
especially good, imo. It also has great illustrations that really bring the <br/>
patterns to life. Though you&#39;ll encounter some formulas and notational stuff, <br/>
the emphasis is always on the significance of the particular concept in the <br/>
scope of things. This book is like a survey course in mathmatics, giving a <br/>
great overview, but not enough depth to be scary.<br/>
<br/>
A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar -- If you like biographies (or even if you <br/>
don&#39;t)... this biography of mathematician John Nash is a fascinating glimpse <br/>
into the world of math and madness.  <br/>
<br/>
Fermat&#39;s Enigma by Simon Singh -- This one doesn&#39;t really fit into any neat <br/>
category, but it&#39;s one of my favorites.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like the writing of someone who took a lot of drugs in the 70&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Very seriously, the 1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s saw the addition of a couple of things <br/>
in this culture:  drug experimentation and mandala art.   Jung&#39;s books about <br/>
the subconscious including especially the heavily illustrated &quot;Man and his <br/>
Symbols&quot; which was remaindered and in used book stores in the early 70&#39;s had <br/>
some great symmetrical pattern art.  And that&#39;s not just in one culture <br/>
either.  There are Navajo sand paintings, Hindu patterns, Tibetan sand <br/>
paintings, Chinese symbol patterns, and because they look like some patterns <br/>
people see when they&#39;re tripping, and because they exist in relation to <br/>
spiritual practices, people got (yet another) mental connection between <br/>
patterns and religion.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I taught a workshop on medieval music a year or so ago, and one of the points <br/>
I made was that Gothic cathedrals had a connection to music of the time--they <br/>
were, in some eerie ways, transmitters.  They were shaped as they were in <br/>
very numerical ways (the relative size of transept nave and other parts whose <br/>
names escape me, the height to width, the entire architecture building up to <br/>
point and spires.  And inside those there was music, based on patterns of <br/>
perfection (&quot;perfect&quot; intervals, &quot;perfect&quot; chords), and harmonies (all of <br/>
which turn out to be straight math in physics-sense).  They were trying to <br/>
communicate with God in code--trying to crack the perfection-patterns.  <br/>

It&#39;s something i am trying to cultivate more in my<br/>

open that their might be a conection to<br/>
see/understand. <br/>

stupid or something. Because if I remember correctly<br/>
we had had the technology previously to build<br/>
buildings without the need for all the arches to<br/>
support the walls. (at least I think I am remembering<br/>
it right) Yet when my instructor explained some of the<br/>
reasoning behind their choices and the mathematical<br/>
spiritual ideals I found I had a much greater<br/>
appreciation for the cathedrals. <br/>

fact. He writes books and screenplays and journal articles and lots of <br/>
letters to the editor. He also writes computer code as part of his job. His <br/>
writing never sounds like this. Maybe he&#39;s got too many brain cells missing. <br/>

Very sweet in a dark kind of way.<br/>
But not for children or me a second time (not too soon anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Rainman&#39;s in interesting math movie too.    I&#39;ve always been fascinated by <br/>
the idea of idiot-savants, those who are functionally... non-functional.  <br/>
Someone &quot;retarded&quot; in all but one slice of intelligence.  A musician who <br/>
can&#39;t wipe his ass, or as in Rainman, someone with only math thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you know of any websites or books about that?  Or have any of you <br/>
ever known a totally non-functional genius?  I&#39;ve known &quot;absent minded <br/>
professors&quot; for sure, but they&#39;re at least going to work, if without keys and <br/>
books sometimes.<br/>

I&#39;m not *just* being funny.<br/>
I&#39;m rarely &quot;just being funny.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Just because something&#39;s funny doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not profoundly true.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that because it sounded like the ideas many people had who took lots <br/>
of drugs in the 70&#39;s and I went on to expound on what the connection between <br/>
drugs and spirituality and patterns was.<br/>
<br/>
So it was a joke, in a way, but it wasn&#39;t an insult and it wasn&#39;t without <br/>
value of meaning or intent.<br/>

humor yet I often view humor as negative rather than<br/>
positive/still valid. I also asked because I think the<br/>
prevailing attitude about drugs in our culture is<br/>
negative rather than positive.<br/>
