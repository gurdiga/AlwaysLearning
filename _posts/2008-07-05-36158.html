<div id="ygrps-yiv-850617024">This has been an ongoing problem but not a huge issue in the past <br/>
because my kids hardly see this particular grandmother (my mother).  <br/>
She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (very low grade, <br/>
excellent prognosis) and she called to say she was miffed my kids <br/>
didn&#39;t send her cards or call her.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you my kids have never been close to her at all.  When the kids <br/>
were younger she&#39;d come over and all she&#39;d want to do was take <br/>
pictures and create Hallmark card moments.  She&#39;d bear gifts but <br/>
then expect my kids to drop everything and play with them the way <br/>
she envisioned.  She would get ticked that they wanted to do <br/>
something else, or play with whatever in a different way, etc.  She <br/>
always has and still does speak to them in a sing-song-y baby voice <br/>
(they&#39;re 10 & 14).  She can&#39;t just BE with them and spend time with <br/>
them and talk to them. Consequently my kids have never sought her <br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t have (and never have had) a good relationship <br/>
with my mother.  She has demonstrated time and time again that she <br/>
prefers to go out of her way to help other people and not her own <br/>
family.  Holidays are supposed to be picture-postcard perfect and no <br/>
deviations from what she envisions allowed.<br/>
<br/>
I give this background because after she mentioned that my kids <br/>
didn&#39;t send her cards (and hinted that I should have forced them to <br/>
because it was the right thing to do she said) that she said that <br/>
she has never and will never agree with unschooling, that it&#39;s <br/>
horrible and my kids are going to pay for it later.<br/>
<br/>
This came out of the blue.  I was taken aback a bit because she&#39;s <br/>
never even tried to get to know my kids as people.  Why does she <br/>
hate unschooling?  Because I have deprived her of her rights as a <br/>
grandmother because there are no awards to hang on the fridge, no <br/>
bragging rights, no soccer games, no graduations or plays or all <br/>
that stuff, therefore she can&#39;t brag on her grandkids.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the point of this ramble is that she blames unschooling for <br/>
the bad relationship with her grandkids.  The fact that she never <br/>
even tried to just spend time with them and be with them and get to <br/>
know them fell on deaf ears.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t want to educate herself on unschooling (obviously hasn&#39;t <br/>
in 14 years).  Any way to repair the relationship between <br/>
grandmother and grandkids?  <br/>

I don&#39;t know if it could be possible if your mom is as you&#39;ve described -<br/>
someone who doesn&#39;t try to know and just BE her grandchildren.  (My mom&#39;s<br/>
like that too, but without the negativity.)  If your kids aren&#39;t close to<br/>
her now, I doubt that could really change.  I have 2 different relationships<br/>
with my two grandmas.  One is mutual adoration and the other one I tolerate<br/>
but generally ignore.  The latter was the one who&#39;d tell on me and rat me<br/>
out to my parents when I was little, and by the time I was 10, I&#39;d spend<br/>
time with her but that *closeness* was not there.<br/>
<br/>
Now your mom&#39;s calling out your way of life and probably hasn&#39;t considered<br/>
at all what her part in the issue is.  Granted, it could part of her dealing<br/>
with her cancer, but it almost seems like it&#39;s made her bolder than she was<br/>
prior.  What&#39;s your motivation to patch things up?  Is she the only<br/>
grandparent alive?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think one of the reasons difficult relationships between parents  <br/>
and grown children seem complex is 1) the parents want their grown  <br/>
children to change and the children resent it and 2) the grown  <br/>
children want advice on how to change their parents and don&#39;t see the  <br/>
dichotomy there.<br/>
<br/>
The answer is: detach. You can&#39;t change her. She has to change  <br/>
herself and she has a right not to change if she doesn&#39;t want to. Let  <br/>
go of wanting that. She isn&#39;t yours to change any more than you are  <br/>
hers to change. No matter that you think everyone would be happier if  <br/>
she changed in the way you want. She probably thinks the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the door open. Make offers to connect you think are reasonable  <br/>
and then detach from her answer. Don&#39;t expect her to accept. Don&#39;t  <br/>
expect her not to accept. Let her be who she wants to be. If she says  <br/>
things intended to shame you into changing, let it roll off you. She  <br/>
only has power over you if you let her.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s easier said than done but it really is as simple as that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lots of labeled photographs of the kids doing cool things. For  <br/>
example, if one has built a cool lego creation, take a photo of the  <br/>
kid with the lego creation and label it.<br/>
<br/>
My mom got unschooling and supported it, but she also liked to have  <br/>
grandchildren &quot;brag&quot; photos - to share with the other grandmas she  <br/>
hung out with. I used to give her pictures of all kinds of weird  <br/>
things - a photo of my kid climbing a tree, playing with the dog,  <br/>
playing a game. I&#39;d label them: &quot;Roxana Climbing Higher and Higher&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Rosie - the Animal Lover&quot; or &quot;Monopoly Whiz&quot; or whatever. Something  <br/>
cute (not brilliant &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I always made sure to give her photos of the kids in any kind of  <br/>
&quot;formal&quot; activity, too - karate class, guitar lessons, dance lessons,  <br/>
science museum, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Inundate them with photos - it is really the best way to give them the  <br/>
sense that your kids are DOING stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes things that parents complain about to us are things they  <br/>
brag about to other grandparents:<br/>
<br/>
Grandmother to mother: &quot;Don&#39;t you think he spends too much time on the  <br/>
computer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grandmother to other grandmas: &quot;You should SEE my granchild - he is a  <br/>
WHIZ on that computer.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054332327">I give you credit for trying - in a similar situation, I would have a hard<br/>
time making a go of it.  Perhaps it would best to start off with your<br/>
relationship with her and see how it progresses.  I bet you would be a lot<br/>
more comfortable about trying to bring her closer with your children if you<br/>
could repair your relationship first.  Either way it&#39;s tough - especially if<br/>
she&#39;s not willing to understand or accept another point of view.<br/>

gives her a window into your real world and gives her something to  <br/>
talk to the kids about. You can&#39;t &quot;make&quot; them (her and the kids) have  <br/>
a better relationship, but you can set the stage so that it is easier  <br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if she&#39;s willing to buy them gifts, that&#39;s nice and maybe she&#39;d  <br/>
take your advice about things they really want so that they WILL be  <br/>
appreciative and show it.<br/>
<br/>
Another bit of useful advice - set it up so that they are not expected  <br/>
to just &quot;visit.&quot; For example, invite her to go with you when you&#39;re  <br/>
going to a play or musical together - or a movie. Watching something  <br/>
together is really valuable because it provides a point of commonality  <br/>
and is a source of something to talk about. If your kids like museums  <br/>
- science, art, natural history - those can be fun to do with  <br/>
grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
My sister, grandma to two boys, makes sure she and her dh do lots of  <br/>
things with the boys so that they have lots of experiences together.  <br/>
Otherwise, grandparents can sort of seem like they&#39;re interviewing or  <br/>
questioning, even when they are really trying to find some way to have  <br/>
a conversation. My sister and her dh took the grandkids to a mud park  <br/>
last weekend - it is a place where the park department has created a  <br/>
huge mudslide and a big lake of mud that they can raft on and a rope  <br/>
swing and all kinds of fun stuff. My sister and her dh just wandered  <br/>
around behind the boys and watched them have a blast - but you can  <br/>
imagine that the boys think grandma and grandpa are really awesome to  <br/>
take them there. The boys are 9 and 7, I think. They also take them to  <br/>
lots of community theater shows for kids - Wizard of Oz and stuff like  <br/>
that.<br/>

If you try to make amends and that gives her access to insult the  <br/>
kids directly instead of indirectly, there will be something else  <br/>
(possibly) to feel guilty about.<br/>
<br/>
I bet the photos will help, and regular offers of outings might help  <br/>
too.  Maybe it will at least tip the balance and she&#39;ll be feeling  <br/>
guilty for not going instead of you feeling guilty for not trying.<br/>

Keith&#39;s parents did seem disappointed there in the middle of it all  <br/>
because there weren&#39;t school achievements to brag about, but by the  <br/>

Some of our best memories when my older two kids were small came from meeting g&#39;ma and g&#39;pa at a small farm close to their house.  The kids loved the animals (and the pancakes in the small restaurant) and we weren&#39;t &quot;messing up&quot; g&#39;ma&#39;s house.  I agree that meeting on neutral ground is a great idea!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563878935">Hi Jay-<br/>
<br/>
Speaking from personal experience with an extremely dysfunctional<br/>
family---(alcoholic mean mother, completely selfish and self absorbed<br/>
father, multiple messed up siblings as a result.....) I can say, at the ripe<br/>
old age of 38, that trying hard, over and over, to get your family to be<br/>
different or understand you and your point of view, is really a waste of<br/>
time and a waste of energy for you and your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ll get flack for this, as it&#39;s just so not socially acceptable to<br/>
&quot;give up on&quot; your family.  And it&#39;s just commonly accepted that it&#39;s the<br/>
&quot;right thing&quot; to do to keep a comfortable relationship going with your kids&#39;<br/>
grandparents.  But from my experience, when you finally stop making all this<br/>
effort, which in my case resulted in all sorts of stress for me and my<br/>
household (three little kids, a husband who&#39;s awesome and patient), your<br/>
life dramatically improves.  There&#39;s room for new friendships, new<br/>
interests, more time and energy left for your kids and spouse, the list goes<br/>
on....  I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say this:  Quitting my family made me a<br/>
much happier person.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not suggesting that you tell your mom to stay away or stop<br/>
answering the phone.  I did these things and they worked for me.   But I<br/>
think my relationship with my mom, based on your description of yours, was<br/>
way more deteriorated than yours, so.... But I do think stopping any back<br/>
and forth exchange that puts you in the position of explaining yourself or<br/>
placating your mom or apologizing for being who you are or pretending like<br/>
some mean thing she said never happened, should stop.  For your own peace of<br/>
mind. Don&#39;t call her back if she leaves mean messages.  Refuse to discuss<br/>
topics that are critical to your kids.  Just end them.  She can leave your<br/>
house if she doesn&#39;t like it.  I really believe it helps to have<br/>
boundaries.  I figure if my kids want to have a relationship with my mother<br/>
or father when they&#39;re older (right now they have zero interest---there was<br/>
never much of a connection to begin with)  then they can pursue that.  But<br/>
right now, it&#39;s my job to teach them by example that letting people treat<br/>
you like crap isn&#39;t a necessary part of life.  I realized that I was just<br/>
playing out an old script from my childhood, over and over again, and that<br/>
no one was interested in changing that script.  So I quit the play.<br/>
<br/>
I came to this over many years of struggle, so it&#39;s hard to just tell<br/>
someone to implement it right away.  But I was compelled to write because I<br/>
think my approach, what might be called the zero tolerance approach, is way<br/>
underrated in our society.  Whenever I bother to tell any new person in my<br/>
life about it, I usually get knee- jerk arguments to the contrary.  I don&#39;t<br/>
post a lot, but the thing that always gets me going is when someone talks<br/>
about how they&#39;re tying so hard to make a mean person be nice or learn to<br/>
live with someone being mean to them.  It just isn&#39;t necessary.  And it<br/>
isn&#39;t your job to learn to live with it and &quot;rise above it.&quot;  That&#39;s not<br/>
human nature.  When your mother says repeated mean things to you, you<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be expected to just let it roll off.<br/>
<br/>
My little bit o&#39;wisdom--<br/>

&gt;   This has been an ongoing problem but not a huge issue in the past<br/>
&gt; because my kids hardly see this particular grandmother (my mother).<br/>
&gt; She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (very low grade,<br/>
&gt; excellent prognosis) and she called to say she was miffed my kids<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t send her cards or call her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mind you my kids have never been close to her at all. When the kids<br/>
&gt; were younger she&#39;d come over and all she&#39;d want to do was take<br/>
&gt; pictures and create Hallmark card moments. She&#39;d bear gifts but<br/>
&gt; then expect my kids to drop everything and play with them the way<br/>
&gt; she envisioned. She would get ticked that they wanted to do<br/>
&gt; something else, or play with whatever in a different way, etc. She<br/>
&gt; always has and still does speak to them in a sing-song-y baby voice<br/>
&gt; (they&#39;re 10 & 14). She can&#39;t just BE with them and spend time with<br/>
&gt; them and talk to them. Consequently my kids have never sought her<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I personally don&#39;t have (and never have had) a good relationship<br/>
&gt; with my mother. She has demonstrated time and time again that she<br/>

&gt; deviations from what she envisions allowed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I give this background because after she mentioned that my kids<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t send her cards (and hinted that I should have forced them to<br/>
&gt; because it was the right thing to do she said) that she said that<br/>
&gt; she has never and will never agree with unschooling, that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; horrible and my kids are going to pay for it later.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This came out of the blue. I was taken aback a bit because she&#39;s<br/>
