<div id="ygrps-yiv-532929199">Can you set up one of the kids rooms with a bed big enough (or other<br/>
space) for all three of you to go sleep in? Let your dh have the<br/>
queen, but that doesn&#39;t mean your kids have to sleep without you!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of &quot;musical beds&quot; over the years. My dh has finally<br/>
relented over his stance on this (his views haven&#39;t really changed, he<br/>
just decided that if he&#39;s married to me he has to deal with it) and<br/>
things are peaceful as far as co-cleeping now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m perfectly fine with sleeping in the kids rooms though, maybe that<br/>
would make him chill out?  Yeah, he might like more time with you, but<br/>
if you&#39;re choosing to sleep with your kids, rather than having them in<br/>
with you, what&#39;s he going to say? He can&#39;t bitch at you about where<br/>
you&#39;re choosing to sleep, can he?;)<br/>

You know, I JUST realized who I was responding to about the sleeping<br/>
arrangements!! Hi Joanna, I&#39;ve missed you.<br/>
<br/>
Tell Bob that a Dad who sings &quot;spongebob squarepants&quot; in front of<br/>
hundreds of unschoolers, is not allowed to gripe about sleeping<br/>
arrangements and that I said PPPpppppffffffftttt!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, seriously...he and my dh could commiserate with one another if we<br/>
ever had them in the same place. Mine&#39;s just given up, that&#39;s all.;)<br/>

<br/>
My husband would want in on that commiserating! He also gave up and,  <br/>
guess what, at 21, 18, and 15 - the kids hardly ever climb into bed  <br/>
with us anymore. When they do, it is just for notalgia&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
Once they got old enough to feel comfortable off in their own room,  <br/>
I&#39;d lay down with them in their room - oh, all three shared one room  <br/>
for many years. Sometimes one or more would get in with us, but I&#39;d  <br/>
usually move them to their own bed in the middle of the night. Or  <br/>
they&#39;d come get in with us in the early morning. Sometimes my husband  <br/>
would go sleep in one of their beds - if he really needed a good  <br/>
night of uninterrupted sleep. All KINDS of combinations and  <br/>
possibilities.  Maybe Bob would feel better just knowing that he&#39;s  <br/>
not the only dad not thrilled with the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Back home in Iran, where my dh comes from, people usually all slept  <br/>
in pads on the roof in the summer and in one warmed room in the  <br/>
winter. So my husband was used to the idea of families all sleeping  <br/>
in the same place - but he is a light sleeper and sometimes the kids  <br/>
woke him up too much when we were in one bed. Sometimes they&#39;d sleep  <br/>
on the floor beside the bed - that was better. Then we had a daybed  <br/>
in our room and a kid could sleep on that or one of us could move to  <br/>
that if our bed started to get too crowded. That was great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558302432">Well, my husband wants in on the chat, too!  We have a<br/>
king sized bed and a couch bed in our room.  We&#39;re<br/>
lucky they will both fit.  We sleep in many combos<br/>
through the night.  Usually, though, my husband is on<br/>
the couch bed and the girls and I share the king.  <br/>
<br/>
When Sophia, age 7, does sleep in her own bed<br/>
(rarely), I miss her all night!  <br/>

He laughed.<br/>
Thankyou all for the ideas.<br/>
When he got home yesterday, I gave him a hard time for having a fit in <br/>
front of the kids and said we needed to figure out a solution that <br/>
will work for all of us.  I had been thinking we need to get cable in <br/>
the kids room, cause after stories in mine, we usually watch &quot;That&#39;s <br/>
So Raven&quot; or some other Disney channel or Nick shows.  On the times we <br/>
tried to sleep upstairs, we would have to pick out a video to watch <br/>
and that usually didn&#39;t work as well, it kept them up longer or we <br/>
didn&#39;t have something they wanted to watch.  It was just a lot easier <br/>
to be in my room.  As I was about to suggest cable to Bob, he <br/>
said, &quot;yeah, I think we should get cable upsairs, that would probably <br/>
solve everything.&quot;  <br/>
I have a mattress I can throw on the floor, so I can be up there too.<br/>
I figure I&#39;ll start coming back down, after they fall asleep, after <br/>
they get use to being up there.  <br/>
Thanks again everyone!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>========================<br/>
<br/>
In various combinations and times here, people have gone to sleep to  <br/>
tapes, CDs, videos or TV.  When I was exhausted and couldn&#39;t stay  <br/>
awake but a kid was zingy-awake, I would sometimes say &quot;Watch this,  <br/>
and if you&#39;re still awake when it&#39;s over, you can come and wake me  <br/>
up.  Rarely did a kid last through the &quot;timer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One trick there is to make sure the input is long, peaceful,  <br/>
familiar, and doesn&#39;t have any jump scenes (and in little-kid terms,  <br/>
that can be a loud or funny part, something that would rouse a nearly- <br/>
asleep kid).<br/>
<br/>
You can make long CDs of familiar, comfort-songs, maybe.  Don&#39;t put  <br/>
anything they really need to sing along to, or that makes them want  <br/>
to get up and dance or start laughing.<br/>
<br/>
And making them that deal about &quot;if/then&quot; gives them hope that it&#39;s  <br/>
not really final bedtime (in my experience).<br/>
