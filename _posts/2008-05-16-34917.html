<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903824862">I only have a 2 and a half year old so far (planning on having one or<br/>
two more children), and I&#39;m wondering: how was it when your kids were<br/>

make new ones and how did you go about doing that? Also: what did you<br/>

<br/>
I live in Belgium where the overwhelming majority of people send their<br/>
kids to daycare, and even the most mindful parents send their kids to<br/>
&quot;school&quot; at 3 (only one person homeschools in my LLL group) and I&#39;m<br/>
feeling very lonely. I&#39;m moving to Montreal in 2 months and have found<br/>
a new homelearners group there that looks promising, so hopefully I<br/>
won&#39;t feel so lonely soon... (oh, and I&#39;m going to Live and Learn in<br/>
September :-)<br/>

<br/>
I lucked out hugely, when my three were little.  I was in a  <br/>
babysitting co-op (pre-Holly-birth too) of all La Leche Leaders and  <br/>
some of the invited others (I was an other; started to become a  <br/>
leader but then didn&#39;t).  So we had several families whose kids knew  <br/>
mine well, and some of those kids are still in our lives.  I got a  <br/>
dance recital notice from one this morning!  Holly&#39;s going to the  <br/>
birthday party of another next week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So with that, but somewhat even without it, we had one day a week  <br/>
that we went to a park just for the kids to play and the moms to  <br/>
visit and get to know the other kids better.   We had other kids who  <br/>
could come over and play, and though sometimes I was getting  <br/>
babysitting-co-op points for it, sometimes they were just over for  <br/>
fun, or a parties.<br/>
<br/>
We had lots of toys (lots used, and things to play with that weren&#39;t  <br/>
specifically toy-store things) and lots of kid-videos with sing- <br/>
alongs and lots of recorded Sesame Street things (DVDs and internet  <br/>
make that all very easy these days).<br/>
<br/>
We built a big sand box in the back yard and made a shade with sheets  <br/>
and tent poles (a home-job, nothing bought) and on very hot days it   <br/>
helped to spray water on that shade cloth, and the kids would play  <br/>
with the hose in the sand.<br/>
<br/>
We pulled all the sticker-plants out of our yard even before  we had  <br/>
babies, and so they could go barefooted outside which is a luxury in  <br/>
the desert.<br/>
<br/>
We slept together, or I&#39;d sleep with the babies in another room when  <br/>
my husband really needed a full night&#39;s sleep for something pressing  <br/>
or important.<br/>
<br/>
When we went on drives to see grandma or whatever, we&#39;d allow an  <br/>
extra hour or two to stop and walk around at the side of the road, so  <br/>
the kids got to see and touch and explore and not be stuck in the car  <br/>
so long.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d take them to the store when it wasn&#39;t crowded and we&#39;d take our  <br/>
time and look at things and talk about stuff and use the store as one  <br/>
big museum.<br/>
<br/>
We would got to kid-food places with playgrounds so they could play  <br/>
when it was cold or wet.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t know we were going to homeschool.  We just considered it  <br/>
all part of attachment parenting and a joyful childhood for them, but  <br/>
it easily turned into unschooling, and there were two unschooling  <br/>
families in that co-op and two structured homeschooling families, so  <br/>
I didn&#39;t have to do much research or angsty thought to decide what  <br/>
and how, because I KNEW and could see that the unschooling families  <br/>
were happier and had better relationships than the other ones.<br/>

&gt; two more children), and I&#39;m wondering: how was it when your kids were<br/>

&gt; do when you were pregnant and had less energy? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t know about less energy... I had my first child when I was <br/>
really young so I had a lot of energy!  None of my friends had <br/>
children, and I didn&#39;t know any others with children besides my sis-in-<br/>
law, so my daughter had cousins she saw sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
My friends were great and loved my daughter and welcomed her coming <br/>
along to outings and whatnot.  I believed at the time that I didn&#39;t <br/>
really need to change my lifestyle just because I had a child, but that <br/>
my child could be incorporated into our lives.  We took her <br/>
everywhere.  I was in college still and took her to classes.  I worked <br/>
at an outdoor art and craft market on the weekends and took her with me <br/>
sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
We lived rurally at the time, but close to a big city, so we were kind <br/>
of isolated.  To do stuff we got out of the house a lot, A LOT.  We <br/>
were on the go frequently and she just came along.  She was easy going <br/>
about it, I think because that is how it was since she had been born.  <br/>
<br/>
By the time she was 4, she really wanted to be around other kids, which <br/>
also coincided with me really needing a full time job for a while, so I <br/>
put her into a child care.  We were talking about this last night.  I <br/>
was telling her how hard it was for me to take her there everyday and <br/>
be apart from her.  She, 14 now, told me that she loved going there, <br/>
which I knew already, and it was the only way I was able to keep doing <br/>
it.  If she had cried every time I left her there, I don&#39;t think I <br/>
could&#39;ve done it, but she never did, she was always happy to be there <br/>
and happy to see me when I came to pick her up.<br/>
<br/>
Then a year later, we decided to homeschool, and I took her out of <br/>
childcare and took her with me to work, a different job, where I taught <br/>
dance classes.  Then I continued doing that at a different dance <br/>
teaching job where she wasn&#39;t the only homeschooled child that came to <br/>
work with her mom, pretty unusual, but that&#39;s what it was and it was a <br/>
wonderful experience for both of us.  She was able to take all kinds of <br/>
classes like gymnastics, sports, spanish, arts and crafts, and the <br/>
place had a huge jungle gym that was about three levels or about 2 <br/>
stories high in a huge room that was bigger than a gymnasium.  It was a <br/>
kid&#39;s dream come true!<br/>
<br/>
Then I had my second child where my maternity leave coincided with the <br/>
place that I was working for going bankrupt and I was out of a job and <br/>
at home fulltime for the first time since ever!  I&#39;ve tried other <br/>
ventures here and there since but nothing has really panned out, so we <br/>
go and do stuff just us girls and sometimes in the evening with dad <br/>
too.  We team up and do things seperately too because my older daughter <br/>
needs to get out and my younger daughter never wants to.  A lot of our <br/>
days are spent at home and when dad gets home I go and do stuff with my <br/>
older daughter while my husband spends time with our younger daughter, <br/>
it isn&#39;t perfect but it works for now.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a lot of homeschooling friends.  We need help in the <br/>
friends department.  I always have my feelers out, but it&#39;s pretty hard <br/>
to make friends when we never go anywhere and we don&#39;t go places <br/>
because my younger daughter makes it miserable more often than not when <br/>
we do go anywhere, not always, but often.</div>
