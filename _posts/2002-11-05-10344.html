I think you answered yourself, Stephanie. In your mind, being a parent is<br/>
being controlling about food. How wonderful that you&#39;re seeing that for what<br/>
it is (a problem with the parent, not the child) and you&#39;re changing it for<br/>
this generation!<br/>
<br/>
My parents were controlling too (but not as grandparents, leaving my son to<br/>
ask once if we were talking about the same people!) and I&#39;ve had to become<br/>
very aware of my &quot;instincts&quot; so that I don&#39;t just repeat their mistakes. I<br/>
remember as a young adult watching how other families parented, just soaking<br/>
it up, so that I could see that there were other ways to go about it without<br/>
restricting everything. Respecting one&#39;s child was a revelation to me.<br/>
