<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;My father says that almost the whole world is asleep.<br/>
 &gt;Everybody you know.  Everybody you see.  Everybody<br/>
 &gt;you talk to. He says that only a few pople are awake<br/>
 &gt;and they live in a state of constant total amazement.<br/>
 &gt;From Joe Versus the Volcano (1990)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with this, and I try so hard to be<br/>
awake all of the time.  I do live in a constant state<br/>
of amazement.  I sometimes feel twinges of<br/>
embarrassment or regret when I let my enthusiasm carry<br/>
me away, worrying that I have talked to much or<br/>
something.  Then I shake myself, laugh and say &quot;who<br/>
cares!&quot;  Better to live with that kid at Disneyland<br/>
look on your face, in love with the world at all<br/>
times.  I try so hard to live in the moment, with that<br/>
kind of passion, every day.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I agree with Deb.  I love to write<br/>
and recieve long letters.  The internet is great for<br/>
information and for instant contact with larger<br/>
groups.  But for meaningful, sustained, intimate<br/>
contact with friends at a distance, I prefer to use my<br/>
own script and write long letters by hand.  I love to<br/>
get them even more.  I wish I had more friends who<br/>
wrote me.<br/>

arthritis in my thumbs makes writing letters longhand torture.  Snail mail <br/>
