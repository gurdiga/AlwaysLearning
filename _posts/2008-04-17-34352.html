<div id="ygrps-yiv-914776988">Hello again--<br/>
<br/>
First I want to thank all of you who so patiently answer all of these<br/>
newbie questions :-) The more I read, the better I understand; but,<br/>
when I look back on some of my previous posts I am a little<br/>
embarrassed (because most of the information can be found without<br/>
posting). I really appreciate all of the responses from those of you<br/>
with more experience - it must feel like you are answering the same<br/>
questions a lot though!<br/>
<br/>
So, I feel like I have been on an unschooling &quot;high&quot; for about a month<br/>
now and am slowly coming down. This list has been kind of like a drug<br/>
for me - I can&#39;t get enough (It&#39;s definitely the best one that I<br/>
joined)! The advice given to &quot;chill&quot; and to start living the<br/>
principles with my husband and daughter is the best though. So that is<br/>
the direction I am trying to move in now.<br/>
<br/>
I am feeling a little bit... I don&#39;t know what word I am looking for<br/>
here -- unprepared... overwhelmed... oh, I guess INADEQUATE would be<br/>
the best. I have actually always considered myself a pretty<br/>
interesting person -- my passions range from different sports, to<br/>
science, to music -- playing instruments, singing, dancing... I grew<br/>
up on a farm, and then taught in the city. However, when I read about<br/>
some of your lives I don&#39;t feel all that &quot;sparkly&quot;. Part of my problem<br/>
I think is that I am in &quot;deschooling&quot; mode for myself right now....<br/>
School WAS my life (as a student and then a teacher) until my daughter<br/>
was born 2 years ago. I am with my daughter every day and watch a<br/>
little boy that is her age and I LOVE it, which is why I love the idea<br/>
of unschooling and continuing this way of life. His mom (the little<br/>
boy I watch) suggested a &quot;loose curriculum&quot; and I kind of half<br/>
heartedly agreed, but have not done anything like that (I love NOT<br/>
having &quot;lesson plans&quot; now that I am not a teacher!)<br/>
<br/>
This is getting long again (stream of consciousness)... I want to<br/>
start working towards becoming a more INTERESTING and INTERESTED<br/>
person now.... while my daughter is still little... I am just so used<br/>
to the &quot;school way&quot; (and this goes back to the research idea too) that<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to break out of that mold. I know people have said<br/>
little things -- Like going to a new store, going a different way to<br/>
places etc. I feel so lazy sometimes though -- like in my mind I am<br/>
not an &quot;activity&quot; or &quot;crafty&quot; person (some things that might be great<br/>
for 2 year olds) and I also feel like I just don&#39;t KNOW that much -- I<br/>
was GREAT at school (learn it all and dump it out). I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
this is part of me just &quot;deschooling&quot; or something I can &quot;work&quot; on...<br/>
Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated... I&#39;m trying to get out<br/>
of &quot;schooly research&quot; mode (been reading and LOVING this stuff for a<br/>
few months now) and more into LET&#39;S DO THIS mode! <br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
<br/>

This post speaks to me and helps me clarify a question that I have.  We&#39;ve been unschooling/deschooling for 13 months.  Still very new.  We are still very happy with this lifestyle.  But here is my question:  the kids say they are bored.  I offer &#39;field trips&#39; and inevitably 1 or 2 (of my 3 kids) don&#39;t want to do them. Even if they asked for it. We&#39;ve all had a lot of viral illnesses this winter, and the unschooling journey has very clearly meshed with some intense psychological work, which as we all know is tiring. Anyway, our days have a &#39;doldrum-y&#39; feeling.  We all seem to feel stuck, and yet so far the kids resist my ideas to bring the world home or go out and see it up close.  Sometimes the kids seem really happy and sometims very unhappy.  Is this an unsurprising phase?  I think that I&#39;d like to trust this phase and just ride with it.  But I don&#39;t want to miss something I could do to make this beter for us all; we could use it.  Thanks...Cameron<br/>

<br/>
So do you just not go?<br/>
What about the 1 or 2 that did want to go?  What about if you really <br/>
wanted to go?<br/>
Things I&#39;ve done in this situation:<br/>
Make sure the day before that everyone is definitely in on the plans.<br/>
If not.  Try to arrange a good alternative for the ones that aren&#39;t.<br/>
Like, going to a friends, going to work with dad, going to grandmoms, <br/>
and as they got older, staying home.<br/>
If the day came and one (or two)changed their mind, I would ask them <br/>
to come along anyway if we couldn&#39;t arrange for anything else.  It <br/>
would be doing me a favor.  Unless they really didn&#39;t feel well, they <br/>
would come and usually be happy that they had.<br/>
It&#39;s not always going to work out smoothly, but brainstorming for all <br/>
involved (including you) might get you out and about more.<br/>
We can&#39;t help but going outside these days.<br/>
The warmth is finally coming back.  I see little green buds on the <br/>
trees!  Today is suppose to get into the 70&#39;s here in MD.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been day dreaming about laying in the warm sand on the beach.<br/>
Maybe we&#39;ll go today!<br/>

<br/>
When you and your  husband were first dating, did you go on field  <br/>
trips?  What kinds of things did you do?   That&#39;s what you can do  <br/>
with your kids.  Something fun, interesting, memorable.  Not &quot;field  <br/>
trips.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re willing to tell us where you are, or at least what kind of  <br/>
place you&#39;re in, we could help you brainstorm.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not unsurprising, and I understand your desire to unravel it now  <br/>
instead of letting it slowly untangle.<br/>
<br/>

it up close-=-<br/>
<br/>
It might help to remind yourself that your home IS in the world, and  <br/>
that the world is in your home.  Are you northern hemisphere?  If so,  <br/>
it&#39;s getting on time to open the windows!  (unless you&#39;re in Phoenix  <br/>
where it&#39;s already too hot, or Minnesota where it&#39;s still snowing)<br/>
<br/>
One of the easiest one-thing-leads-to-another things is the  <br/>
internet.   I have some launch-pad places here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/art">http://sandradodd.com/art</a><br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t really even need to engage your kids in those things, just  <br/>
explore them yourself, if anything on any of those looks interesting,  <br/>
and each thing can lead to other things and soon you&#39;re everywhere!<br/>
<br/>
Today I&#39;m going shopping with Marty, for more black pants for his  <br/>
job.  He only has one pair, and they have a bleach splash on the  <br/>
bottom of one leg from when he worked at the grocery store.  We will  <br/>
not *just* shop for pants.  We&#39;ll probably look around the store  <br/>
some, maybe get a snack or a meal, maybe think about a gift for  <br/>
someone, and he&#39;ll tell me about the gaming sessions he ran last  <br/>
night.  I printed out character sheets for him, and I centered the  <br/>
half-page image in the middle of heavy, brown paper and told him it  <br/>
was the closest to a rock I could make them.  The game is called Og  <br/>
and it&#39;s a cave-man themed RPG.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s boyfriend bought her a new phone yesterday.  Hers was lost on  <br/>
a roller coaster last weekend (or somewhere at the amusement park).   <br/>
I went with them, because I could get a discount on a phone if I  <br/>
renewed my contract.  The crummy little phone I have is fine for me.   <br/>
Holly needs a camera and spiffy this&#39;n&#39;that.  I just need to be able  <br/>
to call Holly.  They took me to the mechanic to pick up Keith&#39;s car  <br/>
because he had the air conditioning charged up so we can better  <br/>
survive driving to Austin next weekend to see Kirby, our oldest!  I  <br/>
paid for the service on my Amazon card, and with that I&#39;ll get points  <br/>
with which I can buy the book Heidi just recommended on  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went to the thinkingsticks blogspot and was so excited to see the <br/>
part on the Russian Nesting Dolls.  One of my sisters lives in Russia <br/>
with her family of 5 kids and husband.  They are missionaries.  I&#39;m <br/>
not sure I agree with all that they do as far as their mission work <br/>
goes, but they do send back cool things, like Matryoshka dolls!  I <br/>
have two sets and my dd has three sets.  They are so much fun.  Megan <br/>
and Matthew and I all watched the Sesame Street Youtube on the <br/>
Nesting Dolls and enjoyed it!<br/>
<br/>
There is a book at our library called, &quot;The Littlest Matryoshka&quot; by <br/>
Corinne Demas Bliss which Megan has checked out several times.  She <br/>
asked me to go to the library website and order that book again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sandra, for sending that link.  <br/>
<br/>
Off we go to play with nesting dolls!<br/>

anything, go anywhere, for a really long time after he got out of  <br/>
school. She&#39;d always invite him, but let it go if he didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
go. She and her younger son went anyway and had a great a time. One  <br/>
day, Cameron calmly just joined them. Pretty soon he was an eager  <br/>
participant.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen my kids get that excited about things they were doing and  <br/>

it seems like a drug for them.  It&#39;s cool to be around.  I think it&#39;s  <br/>

Apprehensive is better, I think. And it&#39;s another learning word!    <br/>
Maybe you&#39;re alert with the anticipation that something big is going  <br/>
to happen and you&#39;re not sure what it is.  Tony sang about it in West  <br/>
Side Story. &lt;bwg&gt;  I&#39;m sure your adventure will have a MUCH better  <br/>
