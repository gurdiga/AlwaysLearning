&gt; decades of school and paid workforce determining how I spent the majority<br/>
&gt; of my time.  Now I&#39;m SAHM with SAHK&#39;s (stay at home kids :-)and I have to<br/>
&gt; figure out how to live (spend my time).  I got some good ideas from a<br/>
&gt; book called Wishcraft.  The author has exercises that helped me figure<br/>
&gt; out some of the things I want to be doing and I have/am doing some of<br/>
&gt; them.  Isn&#39;t it enriching for a child to be around adults who are really<br/>
&gt; living?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I LOVE&lt; LOVE LOVE Wishcraft (by Barbara Sher). It&#39;s one of those books I&#39;ve <br/>
purchased many of to give to people. PERECT for unschoolers... she assumes <br/>
you can do anything (without becoming a better person first).   Really...buy <br/>
this book immediately :)<br/>
