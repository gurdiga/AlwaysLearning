Are you sure it&#39;s not AOL itself? I have this problem with the Smartgroups I<br/>
moderate; AOL recognizes some (but not all) mail from that server as spam<br/>
and will not deliver it. Those members just have to check the archives<br/>
frequently, regardless of what method of delivery they choose. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, have you had problems? <br/>
