<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481058447">I have a good reason for this auto response to your email.  : ) <br/>
<br/>
In the month of November I am writing my next awesome novel (it&#39;s a zombie book, fun)  Well, I can&#39;t write a book AND read all my messages (i just can&#39;t) I do scan my inbox a couple times a day but I often miss stuff so if your message is urgent and you require a response, the best bet is to call or text me.  Otherwise, I&#39;ll do my best to keep up but no promises.<br/>
<br/>
See you in December,<br/>

&gt; &gt; -=- But I have no idea what arbitrary age I&#39;m setting that would make me say yes to as much candy as she chose to eat. -=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Your controls and expressed fears will create the situation you fear. You are making the sugar bigger than it is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I have a good example of that. My 2 middle sons, ages 5 and 8, can eat as much of their Halloween candy as they want the night they get it and every day until it runs out. They can eat it first thing in the morning if they want. I don&#39;t put it up or away or try to dole it out a piece at a time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went around the neighborhood with some friends whose parents are very strict and controlling about candy. We had some left over candy so I figured we&#39;d all share that. My kids only took one or two pieces out of the share bowl. The friends grabbed handfuls of as much as they could possibly hold. They wanted to hoard it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That bowl is sitting out for everyone to take some candy whenever they want. Again, my kids might take a piece here or there while the friends grab handfuls. My kids don&#39;t get upset if someone else (their little brother) gets in their candy buckets. They say the other person can have something they like. The other kids get upset and don&#39;t want to share anything.<br/>

&gt; My 9 year old asked us to buy him &quot;a seriously colossal container of<br/>
&gt; Twizzlers&quot; after he only received one Twizzler (red licorice for those who<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t familiar) in his trick-or-treat haul. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We found a container of 105 pieces and he decided that was colossal enough<br/>
&gt; :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He ate one piece when he opened them on Thursday afternoon. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later in the day, as we were cooking dinner, he announced loudly, with a big<br/>
&gt; smile, &quot;I am now going to do like they say on TV and RUIN MY DINNER with<br/>
&gt; candy.&quot; He ate two Twizzlers, and then a huge meal :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday, he told me each time he went to get one. He ate three.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Today the container was sitting next to him on the kitchen island as he ate<br/>
&gt; lunch. He didn&#39;t eat any - didn&#39;t even mention them being there - and he is<br/>
&gt; now off playing with Pokemon cards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s more a fan of salty snacks than candy, so that may have some bearing on<br/>
&gt; the story. But he likes red licorice and Peeps. And we&#39;ve never restricted<br/>
&gt; his intake of those or of any other food. When we have Peeps around, we<br/>
&gt; throw away more that go stale than he ever eats - and the Colossal Container<br/>
&gt; of Twizzlers is not any more a draw for him than the sweet potato chips,<br/>
&gt; bananas, and cinnamon toast that made up his lunch. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe others linked the article earlier in this thread, but what Pam<br/>
&gt; Sorooshian wrote about restricting TV, which in turn applies to restricting<br/>
&gt; anything, is well worth a read by anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it yet: <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When Kirby was 13, 15, in there, he always wanted to own a big container of Red Vines (very much like twizzlers; fans of one or the other will argue as if they were as different as Coke and Pepsi ;-P<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What Kirby wanted to do with his was take them with him when he went to conventions (anime, gaming, sci fi) and give them away. We would get them at Costco, in a round container like candy stores put out sometimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When people from the world of limits and &quot;candy will kill you&quot; try to communicate with unschoolers whose kids haven&#39;t grown up that way, it can seem like they&#39;re talking about two entirely different substances, but it&#39;s not the candy that&#39;s different. It&#39;s the people. <br/>

&gt; I recently bought a really fabulous book called &quot;Unbored.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hilobrow.com/2012/10/16/unbored/">http://hilobrow.com/2012/10/16/unbored/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is described as an activity book for kids, but it is really more than that. It is a book that tries to get people to try new experiences and learn about things just for the joy of it and, hopefully, to find interests that you are passionate about. For example, under the DIY section one of the activities is &quot;Unschool Yourself&quot;, and it actually has some great suggestions on how you can start to take control of your own learning even if you are a person who must attend school. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The book also has great activities/ideas like taking stuff apart to see how it works (faucets, dishwashers etc,), how to properly short-sheet a bed, decorating your room with spray paint and stencils (or not), how to make a horse out of timothy grass, lists of &quot;best ever&quot; for different book and film genres, making and downloading music, different ways to journal (visual, written, audio) etc. It really has a very wide variety of things to offer. Think of it a bit like a very, very detailed version of Mary Gold&#39;s ABC&#39;s of Unschooling list of activities:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gold/abc">http://sandradodd.com/gold/abc</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I read through this book I thought that it really makes a great strewing resource for experienced unschoolers, but also, it would be incredibly helpful for new unschoolers who are at that stage where they have just started out and are asking themselves (and others) &quot;what should I do with my kids all day?&quot; The next time someone asks that question, I would direct them to this book.<br/>
