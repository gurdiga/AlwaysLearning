&lt;&lt; Hi, just wondering if the hatchet can be buried. Did you check out my <br/>
e-mail <br/>
<br/>
from today, (the one I wrote before seeing your latest reply to me). Have I <br/>
<br/>
been &quot;removed&quot; from the list? I&#39;ve been receiving a lot of e-mails from <br/>
people <br/>
<br/>
who have felt equally reamed by your words, so I know it&#39;s not just me.  Is <br/>
this <br/>
<br/>
a tough love thing? I hope it is not a power trip thing. I would like some <br/>
advice <br/>
<br/>
(constructive) about what I wrote today, regarding unschooling vs schooling, <br/>
<br/>
but I noticed that my e-mail is not on the list of messages.  As one human to <br/>
<br/>
another, I really can&#39;t see how my replies from last night could be seen as <br/>
<br/>
negative, but your e-mails are to be seen as only constructive/helpful. It <br/>
takes <br/>
<br/>
a big person to admit when she is wrong and to apologize when she has hurt <br/>
<br/>
someone&#39;s feelings. That said, where is my post from today, the one I wrote <br/>
<br/>
about my son&#39;s experience in art&quot;class&quot;? Do I get official notice of being <br/>
<br/>
removed from this list? Thanks for your time, [name] &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went to the site and approved seven pending messages without reading them.  <br/>
Pam Hartley is the one who approves message for Always Learning, and I <br/>
usually don&#39;t even see that end of that list, though it is my list.   Pam does that <br/>
to keep spam off the list, and she&#39;s a volunteer, so the fact that she hadn&#39;t <br/>
gotten there today was nothing to do with power trips or tough love or <br/>
judgment or negativity.  Pam&#39;s busy, and that&#39;s all.<br/>

Do you not see how antagonistic this is?  In the same paragraph in which you <br/>
accuse me of having a hatchet that might need to be buried, you accuse me of <br/>
reaming people (lots of people).  I have nothing personal against you, I didn&#39;t <br/>
even recognize the e-mail address or know which list you were talking about.  <br/>
I&#39;m involved with several lists.     I just want it to be about unschooling, <br/>
and I want people who come for help not to be hateful to those who are already <br/>
on the list being helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the list description from the yahoo site:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning All <br/>
the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made unschooling a sweet and <br/>
viable option for thousands of families. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not <br/>
moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an <br/>
idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, <br/>
general homeschooling discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling <br/>
discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how people learn no matter <br/>
where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular <br/>
country or jurisdiction. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To the author of the words quoted above, if you can&#39;t be nicer, I&#39;ll open <br/>
that trapdoor and you won&#39;t be on the list anymore, and you won&#39;t get a notice.<br/>
<br/>
To the alleged lots of people who wrote to her, grow up.  <br/>
If you can do so much better, go to yahoogroups and form your own group and <br/>
give the excellent  advice you know people want. <br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable for me to expect that <br/>
people who would come to a list like this could be adult and mature and discuss <br/>
issues like rational people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90154556">Well, Sandra, mature and adult, I can be. I was referring to our <br/>
hatchet, not yours. I can admit to antagonistic feelings here, can you? <br/>
There is a time and a place for being harsh and unsympathetic. I don&#39;t <br/>
think my letter (the first one ) was the time nor place for such <br/>
harshness. My husband read all of the e-mails and feels I should send a <br/>
formal complaint to the Yahoo Groups folks for your unusually rude <br/>
replies to my simple request.  I wrote to your personal e-mail to keep <br/>
this bizarrely angry exchange just between us. When does the <br/>
&quot;be-nice-to play&quot; rule include you/your replies to people? I am acting <br/>
mature, being sensitive to harshness is not an immature state of being. <br/>
Not being able to see how one moves about in the world is not a virtue, <br/>
especially when one tends to steamroll people for no particular reason. <br/>
Attacking someone who is quite obviously already down is just plain <br/>
mean, and in this case starting to look pathological. Trap door me all <br/>
you want, you need to look at yourself and ask if you are truly doing <br/>
good work on this earth and in this life.  If you really can&#39;t see how <br/>
mean-spirited you are being (at least in my particular case), then <br/>
there is nothing anyone can do or say to open your eyes to this <br/>
problem. If growing up means being mean for no particular reason, and <br/>
then getting self-righteous and fully denying being mean in the first <br/>
place, I hope to never grow up. Nadine<br/>
