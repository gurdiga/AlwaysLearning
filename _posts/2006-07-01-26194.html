<div id="ygrps-yiv-439085759">Yesterday we headed to the dollar store, Breanna was needing  <br/>
something so we picked up some McD&#39;s french fries and went shopping.  <br/>
She picked out some coloring books, but suddenly I remembered  <br/>
something I read online here, (and I&#39;m crossposting because I know it  <br/>
was one of these groups, but don&#39;t recall which, and plus it&#39;s so  <br/>
cool that maybe someone else could try it). So I picked up a CASE of  <br/>
the glowsticks. It was maybe $10 altogether.<br/>
<br/>
We came home, grilled out, sat out and played cards (FLUXX and  <br/>
WaterWorks) for a while, and after everyone was ready to transition,  <br/>
I suggested maybe it would feel good to swim (honestly, 100 degrees  <br/>
today and too hot to swim in the afternoon! 80 degrees at ten pm last  <br/>
night, and it felt wonderful!) It&#39;s just odd enough, because usually  <br/>
I&#39;m hesitant to get them swimming so late, cranky neighbors, hard to  <br/>
see, I&#39;m exhausted....So while they jumped in, I ran inside, got my  <br/>
swimsuit and opened up all those glow sticks. In the pool, I cracked  <br/>
them all open and started quietly distributing them around the pool.  <br/>
THe girls were THRILLED. We had so much fun swimming around diving  <br/>
for sticks. The girls experimented with placing them in different  <br/>
areas and distribution, and we all agreed that we need to have a  <br/>
party and invite everyone over to swim late at night.<br/>
<br/>
It was so beautiful to see their happiness and contentment shining in  <br/>
pool late at night. The soft glow through the water was enough to  <br/>
light their faces, and they were happy to be out and playing games  <br/>
with dad and mom. We floated in the noodle chairs and watched  <br/>
lightening bugs. We counted stars and adopted some as our own. We all  <br/>
gathered around Avari in her baby floatie and laughed as she splashed  <br/>
her way around to try and get the floating glow sticks. Rachel  <br/>
learned to dive under water so she could catch as many as Emily was  <br/>
getting.<br/>
<br/>
I took the big plunge with unschooling, and I&#39;m still finding little  <br/>
things I didn&#39;t realize I was ruining for everyone. We stayed up  <br/>
swimming until midnight. The little ones got out on their own and  <br/>
climbed into bed as they got tired. i was surprised to come in and  <br/>
see them down. Josh had stayed inside to play video games, and he  <br/>
helped settle Dan into bed with kisses and storytime. :-) He&#39;s so  <br/>
helpful...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I might blog it later, I&#39;m still tired and maybe not  <br/>
verbalizing well how cool it was. Even if you have a wading pool, it  <br/>
would be cool. We were also talking about how it would be fun to use  <br/>
the necklace length ones and tape them onto our homemade water park....<br/>

I don&#39;t mind that people will cut out of my site and go elsewhere.   <br/>
It&#39;s a good model of how unschooling can work best that they&#39;ll zig  <br/>
and zoom hither and yon around the internet and other places, from  <br/>
something they read that an unschooler wrote.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490579634">I had some connected roaming thoughts today in the car about my oldest son<br/>
(17) and unschooling. Ds gets something deep from poetry and music. He<br/>
listens deeply to words and musical notes, and they actually have an<br/>

because I recognize that HE does, I honor it, respect it, find opportunities<br/>
for more of it for him. I deeply listen to him recite his writings, listen<br/>
to his music, engage in extensive discussions with him, look for things of<br/>
interest on the internet and in stores, look for what&#39;s going on in the<br/>
poetry and music scene in the local venues, etc. Even though my juices don&#39;t<br/>
get turned on by these things, my life has certainly expanded because of my<br/>

trouble with (myself included at times). Video gaming for example...for so<br/>
many, just the mention of the word &quot;video games&quot; turns off the connection<br/>
switch right there. Parental interest engines shut down...no help, no<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578530002">That&#39;s a great story, Melissa.  Isn&#39;t it wonderful what can happen we open<br/>
the door on the world for our kids by saying yes and doing things we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have done before.  Of course, then on the other hand I always feel<br/>
regretful about all those moments I said no to in the past, but now the<br/>
future sometimes seems limitless to me.  I love reading about these moments<br/>
from other families.  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
 I think this is soooo important!<br/>
<br/>
  I know *my* world has been opened in so many ways by my children&#39;s and <br/>
my husband&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
  But I also know it&#39;s so much easier when they coincide in some <br/>
way---or if the boys are engaged in something I deem &quot;worthier&quot; in some <br/>
way. It was so much easier to shell out the big bucks when it&#39;s <br/>
something *I* am interested in. Like magic. When Cam was into magic, I <br/>
was delighted to pay for new effects &#39;cause I loved magic. It was <br/>
harder when he was into skateboarding. I had to make myself pay for new <br/>
wheels or trucks---ans smile at the same time. Going to the magic <br/>
Phoenix Gathering i n Baltimore was easy. I had had to almost force the <br/>
smile as I drove him to Woodward Skateboard camp; but Cam was so <br/>
excited, that smile was contagious! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Ben would *love* to buy Duncan a $500 bicycle. I know he hesitates <br/>
when he pays for $10 Yu-Gi-Oh decks! &lt;g&gt; But I think that&#39;s a huge, <br/>
important necessity in unschooling. We really do need to accept and <br/>
embrace what our kids find fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t care for jazz. It&#39;s no secret! &lt;G&gt; But I&#39;ll sit and listen for <br/>
hours because it&#39;s what Cam loves (until my teeth hurt! &lt;g&gt;). I&#39;m not <br/>
wild about Yu-Gi-Oh!, but I happily painted a bunch of the characters <br/>
on Duncan&#39;s bedroom walls, and we threw a big Yu-Gi party for Duncan&#39;s <br/>
birthday this year.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m lucky that my parents let me have pets and a horse when I was a <br/>
child. Do I wish they had been even *more* into my interests? You bet! <br/>
But I can&#39;t change that. I *can* change my thinking about my kids <br/>
though! I *can* make a much further effort in enjoying what they love, <br/>
in paying for their passions, and in helping further their journeys.<br/>
<br/>
  A lot of it is simply changing the way we look at things. Seeing their <br/>
passions through *their* eyes! Well, as much as we can! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities of <br/>
what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible. They <br/>

 </span></blockquote>SO important -- and I could list MY biases, too. Mostly in terms of  <br/>
money spending.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids want to go to yet another musical - another $25 apiece  <br/>
(for the cheapest seats) - I need to ask myself, what if they wanted  <br/>
to spend $25 on a math book - how would I be reacting?<br/>
<br/>
But Kelly&#39;s point about having to force some enthusiasm is good too -  <br/>
it isn&#39;t just about money. I felt chastised by Sandra once, because  <br/>
it was clear that Roxana was wanting me to watch CATS with her (the  <br/>
video) and let her stop and talk about it, throughout the show. I had  <br/>
been putting her off - let&#39;s just say my enthusiasm for CATS was not  <br/>
super high. Sandra did it for me - and Roxana adores her and always  <br/>
will (not just for that, I&#39;m sure, but really it was such a gift). It  <br/>
happened another time that Roya wanted to go walk around at the  <br/>
college she was going to attend - I put her off and she got my sister  <br/>
to go with her. I felt awful to miss out on that with Roya - awful  <br/>
enough to tell her I was really sorry and it ended up that the three  <br/>
of us went and had a blast.<br/>

<br/>
Well I did it for me, too, because when Holly tried to talk to me  <br/>
about it I zoned out and couldn&#39;t find a hook to get into it by.  And  <br/>
so I did it for Roxana because she was overflowing with enthusiasm  <br/>
and I needed some of it, and so I did it for Holly too, because when  <br/>
I got home I had things I had learned that I could share with Holly,  <br/>
and I understood enough to know what Holly was trying to tell me  <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I need to balance that good incident with the confession of a big  <br/>
failure.<br/>
<br/>
Though I kept up really completely with the original Teenage Mutant  <br/>
Ninja Turtles shows and could converse freely about Shredder and the  <br/>
Foot Clan,  and then I knew who the Power Rangers were, and what  <br/>
parts came from the Japanese show and which didn&#39;t, and why the  <br/>
particular actors were chosen, and I cared who the White Ranger would  <br/>
be, and we watched that week&#39;s episodes as avidly as some people  <br/>
watched NASA broadcasts...   when Pokemon came along I couldn&#39;t bring  <br/>
myself to care as much as I should have.  Keith was working  out of  <br/>
town, we were hosting a weekly get together that had gone from being  <br/>
in parks to just being at our (newer, bigger) house every week, and  <br/>
Holly was bigger and needed lots of attention, and I failed to get  <br/>
the names of Pokemon characters straight.  Kirby told me repeatedly  <br/>
he thought I would like the TV show, and finally there was one  <br/>
episode he was sure I should watch.  I tried, and to my great shame,  <br/>
I fell asleep. In his room with three or four other people there.  It  <br/>
hurt his feelings.  I was embarrassed.  I&#39;ll never recover.<br/>
<br/>
I wish one of you who were up on Pokemon could&#39;ve hung out with Kirby  <br/>
a while.  But really, he was doing okay (except for me).  There was  <br/>
one mom coming to the meetings and she was TOTALLY into it and used  <br/>
to dress up like the female trainer character.  And I appliqued a  <br/>
sweatshirt for her son&#39;s birthday of the bluish frog-looking guy with  <br/>
the flower on his back (but I don&#39;t remember his name).  That was  <br/>
sewing, though, not &quot;Pokemon.&quot;  And I&#39;m glad his favorite was one  <br/>
that lent itself easily to applique!  And I&#39;m sorry he grew up to be  <br/>
6&#39;3&quot; or so and as big as a freezer, because had he been a scrawny guy  <br/>
that shirt might&#39;ve fit him a long time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I still to this day sometimes find a Pokemon card stuck in some odd  <br/>
place, and I put them all in a lost-parts collection drawer.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby got his first job because of Pokemon, and the adult aversion to  <br/>
it.  Those who worked at the gaming shop where he hung out couldn&#39;t  <br/>
understand the game or learn the cards quick enough,  and the  <br/>
tournaments had many precise rules.   Those Pokemon tournaments were  <br/>
very elaborate, with weekly pins you could only get by participating  <br/>
that week, and special cards sometimes.  Kirby understood it really  <br/>
well, at thirteen, and used to help them.  The rules said only store  <br/>
employees could run the tournaments (because it involved  <br/>
responsibility for inventory, and judging, and reporting), so they  <br/>
hired him as soon as he turned 14 and Pokemon was his chief  <br/>
responsibility.  (And before that he ran them, but they had to claim  <br/>
an employee had done it.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m embarrassed that something that was THAT BIG in his life was not  <br/>
something I pressed myself to fathom.<br/>

My son has one on his computer.<br/>

BTW, I didn&#39;t brag on *this* list, but said son qualified for the <br/>
Pokemon TCG (Trading Card Game) World Championships next month.  <br/>
Nintendo is paying for transportation and three nights at the Hilton in <br/>
Anaheim.  Too bad we live so close &lt;g&gt; but they do pay for gas and <br/>
parking.  Too bad dad decided he should be the accompanying parent... <br/>
oh well.  I&#39;m taking a road trip to Oregon with our daughter at the end <br/>
of this month, so I guess it&#39;s fair.  (He played last year, too, <br/>
getting in by finishing in the top 8 out of about 250 players in a <br/>
last-chance qualifier.  The top 32 went on after the first day of play; <br/>
he placed 33rd.  He had a blast anyway :-)<br/>

Oh, I hear you.  But you know, that game is complex!  I listen to Alex <br/>
and his friends talk, usually as I&#39;m driving them somewhere to play, <br/>
and eventually he&#39;ll say, &quot;Sorry, mom, I know we&#39;re speaking another <br/>

Japanese ones as well (I shouldn&#39;t say &quot;kids,&quot; as he plays in the 15 <br/>

Japanese players; they use a specific sign language to communicate.  <br/>
And yes, they do a lot of trading.<br/>

The man who created Pokemon was there to celebrate the winners at the <br/>
end.  Winners get scholarship money, all the new release cards <br/>
automatically, a bye into the next year&#39;s worlds, and tons of stuff.  <br/>
For making it into the first round, Alex got a really nice backpack, <br/>
binder, cards, baseball cap, t-shirt, and all kinds of stuff in the <br/>
backpack like pens, notebook, etc.  There were side events going on, so <br/>
his friends were there hanging out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Where was it last year?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here, in San Diego.  It was held at the old convention center in <br/>
Mission Valley.  The next big thing in Alex&#39;s universe is the ComiCon, <br/>
which hosts Pokemon tournaments in addition to the enormous comic book <br/>
convention stuff (I want to go to the &quot;Lost&quot; discussion board :-)  That <br/>
event is at the new convention center.<br/>
<br/>
It would be cool if they&#39;d hold it overseas, but it&#39;s much easier for <br/>
them to move the American players around here, as they outnumber the <br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>About this, I guess you&#39;re right :-)  I want a replica of the bumper <br/>
sticker on one of the South Park kids&#39; parents car:  &quot;Proud parent of a <br/>
World Chinpoko Master.&quot;  (We dearly love that episode!)<br/>

Pokemon was my true introduction to whole-life unschooling!  Hayden was <br/>
obsessed and I was not, not, not!  In fact, I black-listed the show and <br/>
the propaganda... then I met an unschooler, who threw open the back of <br/>
her van, filled with give-aways and my then 4.5 year old found the <br/>
motherlode of POKEMON!!  The look on his face gave me great pause, cause <br/>
that whole tirade was on the tip of my tongue -- Hayden had heard it so <br/>
often, he wouldn&#39;t even watch the cartoon with adults who didn&#39;t <br/>
know/care about my opinion -- and I swallowed every single bad thing I <br/>
had ever thought or felt about Pocket Monsters!!!  I slapped a big ol&#39; <br/>
grin on my face and reveled in my little guy&#39;s JOY! <br/>
<br/>
Since then, I&#39;ve come a looooong way &lt;vbg&gt; Hayden inherited Kirby&#39;s <br/>
collection last year and they&#39;re one of the few things Hayden knows the <br/>
exact location of at all times, so sacred a gift they are!  We don&#39;t <br/>
play *the* game, but he spends lots of time sorting them out with his <br/>
own organizational systems, discussing Pokemon powers vs super heroes vs <br/>
humans.  They even came all the way (back) to California with us this <br/>
spring, as a comfort for the boy...<br/>

<br/>
Diana, I can SOOOO relate to this as Pokemon was my initiation into self-regulation. I too banned it (the thought of it makes me shudder with disgust) and would politely say; &quot;we don&#39;t have that in our home&quot; or &quot;we don&#39;t play those kinds of games in our home&quot; (double yuck!). When Lewi got interested in Pokemon through our neighbour at the time, I was so concerned. I tried as many ways as possible to try to manipulate him out of Pokemon. (so too with pretend gun play which started around the same time) The more I did this the more he wanted it. The poor little thing! Once he turned 5, he was still into it and I realised that the way  I was handling it was really not working nor helping. I started looking into self-regulation and what that means for children. Although I&#39;d been unschooling for a little while and practicing attachment parenting the whole of Lewi&#39;s life, I hadn&#39;t fully grasped the self-regulation concepts. It made me realise how much I still controlled in his life and I decided I wanted to change some things about the way I was manipulating him (regarding TV watching and &#39;violent&#39; type stuff). On looking into it I relaised there was even more freedom to be had and since then, (especially since finding this group!) I&#39;ve grown continually forward. It&#39;s so freeing and so beautiful to relish in our children&#39;s joy - whether it&#39;s our cuppa of tea or not. The bond only flourishes between us. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so pleased that I found it all out sooner rather than later (I&#39;d say Lewi would agree on that one too!)<br/>
