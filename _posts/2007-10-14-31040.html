<div id="ygrps-yiv-938456108">I was looking for art for a background of a page, and came upon this  <br/>
site.  You might think you&#39;re not much interested in England, but  <br/>
you&#39;ll find something fun.  Just in the few moments I played with it,  <br/>
I looked at Flemish paintings I hadn&#39;t seen and  section on &quot;2000  <br/>
years of art and sex&quot; (article on an exhibit at the Bubicon), and  <br/>
there&#39; something about seaside resorts which Jane Austen fans might  <br/>
need to read, and some history of Punk art and....    Well there it is:<br/>

It&#39;s history and art and geography and archeology and politics/ <br/>
finance and there&#39;s a link called &quot;Trails&quot;--check that out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872727726">In the &quot;Naked Portrait Laid Bare at Compton Verney&quot;, there is this <br/>
quote that I liked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It may not be easy to look at so many naked portraits, but they <br/>
certainly are revealing.&quot;</div>
