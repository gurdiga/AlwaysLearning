<div id="ygrps-yiv-506913140">Actually there is also a huge difference in the nutrients needed to grow brain and bones and muscle then the nutrients required to maintain it. When you limit your kids food intake based on what you feel is appropriate you are working from a model that is appropriate for later maintenance and not for earlier development. Sugar and fats are good for brains. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776917819">I think, too, that if I could close my eyes and not watch what they<br/>
ate, or did, etc., that I&#39;d be fine.<br/>
<br/>
I honestly DO trust my kids more than what you think. What I DON&#39;T<br/>
trust is myself. Let me explain.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I let my kids eat x amount of cookies. I think, &quot;I&#39;m such a<br/>
horrible mom! Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have done that....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most of this journey hasn&#39;t been about them, but about ME. I have<br/>
watched them wondrously become smart little beings who are creative,<br/>
bright, funny, caring, etc. I have poured out my time and energy into<br/>
letting them be who they want to be as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
But each step I&#39;ve taken on this journey has been more stretching than<br/>
you might imagine. This stuff is so far removed from the way I have<br/>
always known things, and I&#39;ve changed SO much in the past 6 years,<br/>
that I almost feel I don&#39;t know who I am anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s hard for me to be confident. It&#39;s hard for me to &quot;trust&quot;<br/>
anything since I trusted my parents completely, and now I realize that<br/>
they weren&#39;t perfect, either. I don&#39;t trust myself at all...I can&#39;t<br/>
trust other parents who don&#39;t understand where I come from, and most<br/>
of the people who have been unschooling for awhile are SO confident<br/>
that it feels like &quot;We have it all together, and you need to just get<br/>
your act together already!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying...I really am. I&#39;m not great at debating about something I<br/>
have no clue about. So I&#39;m trying to ask questions to get deep answers<br/>
because I am the type of person that needs to be convinced of<br/>
something before I just go and do it (didn&#39;t someone on here mention<br/>
that their child was the same way because they choose to think before<br/>
acting?)<br/>
<br/>
I have to play devil&#39;s advocate in order to prove to myself that what<br/>
I&#39;m learning will hold up. So I hope you understand that I AM actually<br/>
on the road, traveling. I just haven&#39;t arrived, yet.<br/>

Join the club!  I don&#39;t know who I am anymore either.  I like my life better<br/>
now, BY FAR.  But it&#39;s not familiar.  Parts of it are.  This is not exactly<br/>
180 degrees from the way I was brought up, in some ways.  In other ways, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t even seem to be in the same universe.  It&#39;s a bit uncomfortable<br/>
traveling to another galaxy and knowing that when you come back across all<br/>
the lightyears later the departure point where you sprang from has changed<br/>
too but not in the same way you have.  Unsettling.<br/>

If you wait until you&#39;re convinced, until all the traces of doubt have been<br/>
removed, too much time will have passed and your kids will be grown or half<br/>
grown.  But in the meantime, continue to read and move through whatever you<br/>
need to in order to get more &quot;in your skin.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Is this the goal of unschooling for you?  For you to be fine?<br/>
<br/>
Someone who speaks at unschooling conferences sometimes made a  <br/>
statement that unschooling is giving a child as many choices as the  <br/>
parent is comfortable giving.  Huh.  Maybe parents need to sacrifice  <br/>
their comfort level for it to work.  That speaker  has three  <br/>
children, all of whom have gone to school.  Unschooling wasn&#39;t quite  <br/>
at the children&#39;s comfort level in that family.<br/>

<br/>
The &quot;deep answers&quot; won&#39;t make any sense if you aren&#39;t going to trust  <br/>

answers about how bicycles work before you rode a bicycle?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have to play devil&#39;s advocate in order to prove to myself that  <br/>
what I&#39;m learning will hold up.-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, you don&#39;t &quot;have to,&quot; and if you do it too much and too long, what  <br/>
are your kids doing during that time?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/haveto">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a><br/>
<br/>
Please read that and the links.  It will help your children.  When  <br/>
your children feel better you will feel fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I hope you understand that I AM actually on the road,  <br/>
traveling. I just haven&#39;t arrived, yet.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nobody here&#39;s getting paid to help you.  Everyone&#39;s volunteering.  We  <br/>
don&#39;t have to report your progress.  You can take you time to get to  <br/>
unschooling eventually, when your kids are older, or maybe understand  <br/>
it well enough to help them with their kids someday if they decide  <br/>
they wish you had unschooled them when they were little.<br/>
<br/>
Although you&#39;re assuring us that your path is much harder than we  <br/>
will expect (where do you think the rest of the 1800 people on this  <br/>
list came from?), I think your children probably age at the same rate  <br/>
everyone else&#39;s do--another day older every day.  If you take your  <br/>
time at this point, you&#39;re taking their time too.<br/>

cheapest you CAN buy!  At least in the US, I don&#39;t know about other<br/>
locations, but the big box mart kind of stores sell this stuff really<br/>
cheap!  Your kids could eat and eat and get sick of it for very little<br/>
money!  Homemade cookies could cost more depending on the ingredients<br/>
you put in them.<br/>
<br/>
As a nice example of a kid who is forbidden such things, just look at<br/>
Calvin and Hobbes.  That poor Calvin is always inventing ways of getting<br/>
into the cookie jar and longing for Saturday morning to eat his frosted<br/>
sugar bombs with cartoons and wishing it would last forever!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m betting there are few people here who don&#39;t understand where  <br/>
you&#39;re coming from. But you&#39;re in essence focusing on your spinning  <br/>
wheels asking us if they&#39;ll ever stop spinning. And we&#39;re saying it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t help to look at the spinning wheels. It helps to look at  <br/>
where you&#39;d like to be.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes just focusing on where you want to be can make all the  <br/>
difference!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; because I am the type of person that needs to be convinced of<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually what your words have asked for are the surface answers, eg,  <br/>
do classes damage kids as much as school? The answer (yes or no)  <br/>
doesn&#39;t get to why. As much as the engineer in me would like the  <br/>
world to be nothing but yes or no ;-) it&#39;s not that orderly. Most of  <br/>
the time the answer is &quot;It depends.&quot; And that&#39;s where deep begins.<br/>
<br/>
The deep answers get into goals and philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I think what you&#39;re asking is &quot;Does this work?&quot; But you haven&#39;t  <br/>
clearly defined what &quot;this&quot; is to yourself and you&#39;re not sure if our  <br/>
&quot;this&quot; matches yours. If you were certain our &quot;this&quot; matched yours,  <br/>
then you wouldn&#39;t need to ask *if* kids bodies will find the right  <br/>
balance (another question designed for a yes or no answer). Because  <br/>
if kids bodies don&#39;t find the right balance, then we&#39;re a bunch of  <br/>
loonies with kids who do nothing but watch TV and eat cookies and you  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be asking us!<br/>
<br/>
The questions that will help you get to the deep stuff aren&#39;t the yes/ <br/>
no questions but the how and why questions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I guess the question is, will the kids figure out what&#39;s good for<br/>
&gt; them in spite of &quot;bad&quot; conditions, or do I need to change the<br/>
&gt; conditions in order to better favor their bodies needs?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends!<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s another yes/no question and won&#39;t dig deep.<br/>
<br/>
The healthier the model -- and model implies the ideas aren&#39;t being  <br/>
imposed -- the more likely they&#39;ll eat healthy. It&#39;s not the only  <br/>
factor, though. Nothing&#39;s that easy when it comes to humans.<br/>
<br/>
If mom smokes and tells kids not to smoke, what are the chances the  <br/>
kids will smoke? Is it different if the mom doesn&#39;t smoke and tells  <br/>
the kids not to smoke? The answer is: it depends!<br/>
<br/>
If mom doesn&#39;t smoke and shares honestly about why *she* chose not to  <br/>
smoke -- and the kids aren&#39;t in school -- the chances that the kids  <br/>
will smoke will go down. It comes down to trust and freedom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Luckily, I&#39;m not waiting. But as I&#39;m moving, I&#39;m putting out feelers.<br/>
Like a snail, perhaps, testing the &quot;waters&quot;, if you will, as he moves<br/>
along. I am moving forward, but I always test things first. Otherwise,<br/>
aren&#39;t I simply being a sheep to the unschooling shepherd?<br/>
Unschooling, like anything else, should be able to be examined and<br/>
tested and hashed about. If it&#39;s true, it will hold up. If it&#39;s for<br/>
me, I will feel at peace.<br/>
<br/>
The first changes I made were as a mother and parent. Then this past<br/>
two years it&#39;s been as a person and my faith. And now it&#39;s as a parent<br/>
yet again...always changing, testing, questioning. And sometimes I<br/>
just want to rest and be SURE that I&#39;m &quot;okay.&quot; I am such a darn people<br/>
pleaser and I so want to be right, and for once I just wish I didn&#39;t<br/>
care what people thought, and just did what *I* want to do, but then I<br/>
don&#39;t really know what that is...<br/>
<br/>
At this point, like in the past 6 years, I feel pressure more from the<br/>
people I&#39;m moving TOWARDS, in this case, all of you wonderful people<br/>
here! I want you to like me, I want to feel like I belong, like I&#39;m<br/>
one of you, a part of something. I know that&#39;s not at all what it&#39;s<br/>
about, but that feeling is still present. It&#39;s been there since the<br/>
first grade when I first became an outsider.<br/>
<br/>
While I mostly feel confident in who I am and the decisions I make,<br/>
the other part of me just wishes I could be like everyone else and not<br/>
fight the system. No home births, no nursing toddlers in public, no<br/>
homeschooling, whatever. I hate being the odd ball out. And yet at<br/>
night when I think about my choices, I&#39;d have it no other way. But I<br/>
do wish I had someone to travel this road with. I DO have my DH and my<br/>
family (the kids, not extended) who have wholeheartedly supported me<br/>
every step of the way, but it&#39;s nice to have other mothers who share<br/>
your ideals.<br/>

it says &quot;What will help? What will hinder?&quot; That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to<br/>
figure out. Maybe I&#39;m off base, but I thought that people learn by<br/>
asking questions, or at least SOME people learn that way, and I am one<br/>
of them. Always have been. Why do you insinuate that I&#39;m NOT<br/>
unschooling simply because I&#39;m questioning the details? My kids have<br/>
no set schedule, eat when they want, and mostly what they want (hence<br/>
the questions about food so I can learn more about how you do that),<br/>
they play when and where and what they want. They create all the time,<br/>
and ask questions constantly. Just because I&#39;m trying to define what,<br/>
exactly, I need to be as an unschooling parent doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t<br/>
unschooling currently. The journey isn&#39;t over, but it doesn&#39;t mean it<br/>
hasn&#39;t begun. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although you&#39;re assuring us that your path is much harder than we  <br/>
&gt; will expect (where do you think the rest of the 1800 people on this  <br/>
&gt; list came from?), <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When did I say that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think your children probably age at the same rate  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; everyone else&#39;s do--another day older every day.  If you take your  <br/>
&gt; time at this point, you&#39;re taking their time too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I said I needed to take time on anything - I was asking<br/>
the people on this list to be patient with me for asking so many<br/>
questions because I obviously haven&#39;t gotten to the place where you<br/>
are yet that you are so comfortable with your decisions.<br/>
<br/>
And if it seems that I am being self-centered, then I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
you expect from me. I am trying to change my thinking and outlook and<br/>
way of doing things so that my kids can learn in freedom. Maybe you<br/>
are the kind of person who can just do something without thinking it<br/>
through and asking everyone around you about it. I&#39;m not, at least not<br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
You encourage your children to test things and to question things, and<br/>
that is all I am doing. Why can&#39;t I question unschooling like I do<br/>
other things that I learn? <br/>
<br/>
As for the bike analogy. If I were to learn to ride a bike today,<br/>
never having ridden one before, then I probably WOULD question<br/>
everything about it. &quot;where do you put your foot?&quot; &quot;but what about<br/>
your other foot?&quot; &quot;what about when I start to fall off and I loose my<br/>
balance?&quot; &quot;should I peddle fast, or slow?&quot; &quot;are you going to hold on<br/>
to me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter asked me today as she tried her &quot;new&quot; used bike that<br/>
she could just barely reach, &quot;What if I fall?&quot; I didn&#39;t tell her to<br/>
just go out there and find out. I replied, &quot;If you start to feel like<br/>
you&#39;re going to fall, then move off into the grass where you&#39;ll slow<br/>
down and falling won&#39;t hurt as bad. But just in case, I&#39;ll also jog<br/>
behind you and if I see you waver, I&#39;ll catch you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped that this list was a place I could learn more about the<br/>
finer details of unschooling in a positive way. Maybe this is why<br/>
people seek support of a different kind. I don&#39;t need to you pat me on<br/>
the back if I&#39;m not doing things the right way, but at the same time<br/>
it would be nice to have the offer of &quot;I&#39;ll hold your hand through this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s obvious that I can&#39;t just &quot;do it&quot; as you keep saying, because<br/>
when I tried, in the store, I apparently got it wrong. I redirected my<br/>
son&#39;s words instead of ....well, I still don&#39;t know what I should have<br/>
done. Sitting and playing with the toys isn&#39;t really an option for me<br/>
because the two babies get tired of shopping now as it is, and they<br/>
don&#39;t like sitting in the cart, so I have to get done quickly in order<br/>
to keep them happy.<br/>
<br/>
And when you gave the suggestion to the other poster about telling the<br/>
kid to be quiet while she was driving, &quot;and mean it.&quot; I thought, &quot;but<br/>
how does that fit into letting him have a choice?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just not THERE, yet. I&#39;m still on the path, I&#39;m still unschooling,<br/>
but I don&#39;t have all the details. And just doing it won&#39;t bring them,<br/>
because I&#39;m not sure what to do in place of the things I&#39;ve been doing. <br/>
<br/>
Apparently I&#39;m getting the point of this forum wrong, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I truly am. I didn&#39;t mean to waste your time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-=-I feel the need to answer the questions that are asked in my<br/>
direction. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The list isn&#39;t about your needs.  It&#39;s about discussing unschooling.   <br/>
Most of the questions people ask are questions asked rhetorically, in  <br/>
order for you to clarify your own thinking, so that you can see the  <br/>
flaws in your reasoning.  They&#39;re not  asking because they need to  <br/>
know,  usually, but because they think you need to think about the  <br/>
answers to move closer to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If what you need is to be involved in a discussion of unschooling,  <br/>
this list will be great for you!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I AM trying things out. I AM watching my kids-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not while you&#39;re writing to the list you&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t had time to see  how these things play out at your house  <br/>
before you&#39;re back writing more and more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Did you wait for deep  answers about how bicycles work before you  <br/>
rode a bicycle?<br/>
<br/>
**I was five and believed anything anyone told me.<br/>
<br/>
This misses the point.  You didn&#39;t NEED to know how bicycles worked  <br/>
before you could ride one.  You were five, but you were able to ride  <br/>
a bike without waiting to understand mechanics and physics.  You can  <br/>
unschool without a million words passing between you and the list.   <br/>
You canNOT unschool if you wait until a million words pass.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m not sure I said I needed to take time on anything - I was  <br/>
asking the people on this list to be patient with me for asking so  <br/>
many questions because I obviously haven&#39;t gotten to the place where  <br/>
you are yet that you are so comfortable with your decisions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is the kind of writing that neither helps you nor others on the  <br/>
list.  We don&#39;t need to be patient.  You need to read what people are  <br/>
sending you more and post less.   You WILL get it if you read a  <br/>
while, try some things, and only send your real, new questions, and  <br/>
your successes and thoughts that will help other unschoolers.  There  <br/>
are lots of people reading, but if the list is too busy and  <br/>
repetitive, fewer will read.  So I&#39;ve asked regularly and often that  <br/>
people not post &quot;me too&quot; or &quot;thanks,&quot; and that they&#39;re careful to  <br/>
send what will help other people understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the list is to discuss what helps and what hurts, and  <br/>
we&#39;ve been doing that.  Anyone can dip a cup in and partake of the  <br/>
discussion, or make requests for topics, or throw situations out, but  <br/>
no one can try to subvert the flow of the list toward a different  <br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about ideas, not about individuals.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m wondering if you are thinking that an unschooling lifestyle means <br/>
freedom to do anything you want.  It&#39;s not quite like that.  In the <br/>
example above about the child being a backseat driver, he wasn&#39;t <br/>
looking for choices to explore life.  He was being rude and distracting <br/>
the driver which is dangerous.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen other homeschoolers talk about unschooling and they equate it <br/>
with unparenting.  I&#39;ve seen them say stuff like, &#39;But if I let my <br/>
child do anything they want, they&#39;ll run into the street and get hit by <br/>
a car!&#39;  Now think about that.  What child would intentionally run into <br/>
the street to get hit by a car?  But in these parent&#39;s lives, their <br/>
child running away is something that has happened.  Why would the child <br/>
feel a need to run away?  Because the parent isn&#39;t listening to and <br/>
respecting the child. Maybe the child just wanted to run.  So in that <br/>
case, the parent should find a safe place for the child to run.  Maybe <br/>
the child didn&#39;t want to get into the car.  Let&#39;s question why not.  Is <br/>
it too hot in the car?  Is he not ready to go home or to the store?  <br/>
The kids don&#39;t listen because they&#39;ve learned it from their parents, <br/>
who don&#39;t listen to them.<br/>
<br/>
This list is great for learning things like that.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my favorite homeschooling families that I really connect with has<br/>
never ever claimed to be unschooling.  They have one child who is a<br/>
teen.  They&#39;ve always done what I guess people call relaxed<br/>
homeschooling.  However, the amount of respect and consideration they<br/>
give their daughter is amazing and wonderful.  It&#39;s a little of the the<br/>
reverse of unschooling everything but math and bedtimes.  Their life is<br/>
really all about what they can do for and with their daughter that will<br/>
make her happy and content and allow her to flourish.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met other unschooling families claiming to be unschooling, but<br/>
having school rooms set up in their house and heavily regulating video<br/>
games and food and stuff.  I think that&#39;s weird, I mean, why put a label<br/>
on yourself that doesn&#39;t even begin to describe what your about?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met a few unschoolers IRL, even a few that live near me, but I<br/>
don&#39;t ever see them even though I think the world of them for a variety<br/>
of reasons, (MLewis, Emily...).<br/>
<br/>
One way that helped me feel accepted was to go to a conference and put<br/>
myself out there.  I can be secure within myself, but it is nice to feel<br/>
a sense of belonging with something bigger than oneself.</div>

helping you get him from point A to point B safely and calmly, it should<br/>
be addressed, and if he isn&#39;t responding to nicey nice, be very clear<br/>

<br/>
I know what works and what doesn&#39;t with my own kids.  I know which words<br/>
to use and what tone of voice works best when I really need something<br/>
from them.  Other kids that are from other families won&#39;t be the same. <br/>
Over the years, I&#39;ve found that a lot of kids don&#39;t respond to asking<br/>
nice, I think because at home asking nice was just a polite way to<br/>
demand something, and kids learn to ignore that.  So, with kids that are<br/>
used to that, it&#39;s better to be firm and direct and clear that you mean<br/>
what you say.</div>

Maybe you&#39;re selling yourself short.  Broaden those horizons, stretch<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648801896">-=-Maybe I&#39;m off base, but I thought that people learn by asking<br/>
questions, or at least SOME people learn that way, and I am one of<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People learn by thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Some people can ask a question to their diary, and over the course of  <br/>
a few days or weeks or months, figure out the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Some people ask a question of someone they think might know, but  <br/>
asking the question isn&#39;t learning.  Trying to understand the answer,  <br/>
thinking about it, trying it out--that *might* lead to learning.<br/>
<br/>
Asking a question, and then another and another and another and not  <br/>
listening to the answers and saying &quot;I know but&quot; and &quot;yeah but&quot; isn&#39;t  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once assured me she had read my whole website, about the  <br/>
third day she had been around.  I seriously doubt anyone here has  <br/>
read my whole website.  That&#39;s fine!  It&#39;s not meant to be read  <br/>
throughout.  It&#39;s a resource center, an archive.  Saying &quot;Yeah, yeah,  <br/>
I read all that, but...&quot; is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling takes a long time.  Months.  Lots of tools and tricks are  <br/>
on my site and Joyce&#39;s--enough to get people started, and the list  <br/>
can help them people with rough spots and unexpected incidents, and  <br/>
it&#39;s a good place to share successes and progress.<br/>
<br/>
I really like this list, even when it&#39;s not going smoothly, and even  <br/>
when there&#39;s a quiet day or week.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, all of you who stick around a while to  help even after you  <br/>
don&#39;t need it so much yourself.  I really appreciate it.<br/>

as he moves along. I am moving forward, but I always test things <br/>
first. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a long and comprehensive thread which I&#39;ve finally caught up. <br/>
So this is what&#39;ve I understood so far from each and every post. <br/>
<br/>
Like you, I too question things alot. I also dissect and analyse <br/>
situations, and mull over it. I then to solve my own problems and <br/>
issues, which makes me unique and alone. Occasionally I get stuck, I <br/>
have since learnt to ask for help. I do not follow any shepard but I <br/>
do listen and adopt from their experiences and methods that works <br/>
for me. Most of which goes thru tweakings here and there, to make <br/>
them mine.<br/>
<br/>
Please bear in mind, my message and tone here is gentle and caring. <br/>
It is not my intention to tell you off, or sound cruel. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; At this point, like in the past 6 years, I feel pressure more from <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the people I&#39;m moving TOWARDS, in this case, all of you wonderful <br/>
people here! I want you to like me, I want to feel like I belong, <br/>
like I&#39;m one of you, a part of something. I know that&#39;s not at all <br/>
what it&#39;s about, but that feeling is still present. It&#39;s been there <br/>
since the first grade when I first became an outsider.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know you, so I cannot like you nor hate you. I can truly <br/>
understand the feeling of feeling an outsider. I&#39;m a foreigner, <br/>
living in UK, i have only 1 or 2 friends. I too have always been an <br/>
outsider, coming from a background of my parents spliting up, <br/>
remarried, moved away leaving me behind with my grandma. <br/>
<br/>
You will not feel belong if you&#39;re constantly seeing yourself un-<br/>
worthy of anything just because you&#39;ve not learn enough or do <br/>
enough. Just because you cannot measure your doings by means of <br/>
praises or approval, you do not think you&#39;re equal enough to anyone! <br/>
So, you&#39;re an oddball. So am I. Now does help makes you feel less <br/>
alone? Or do you resent being label as such, and will outcast me <br/>
because you do not wanna be in my group? <br/>
<br/>
You have to stop deciding what&#39;s constitute as right,  and what&#39;s <br/>
constitute as wrong. How many rights do you have to do before making <br/>
it to the aproval-able state? How many ticks off the checklist you <br/>
must have before it&#39;s classified as acceptable.  <br/>
<br/>
You are already part of something even tho you don&#39;t see it. We all <br/>
classified ourselves differently - enlightened,  happy, intelligent, <br/>
open minded, advance, far sighted, loving, caring and many more. But <br/>
most of all, we are all unique, individual unschooling families. <br/>
You, like all of us ARE different - accept that! We are all <br/>
considered so because until unschooling becomes a majority, we are <br/>
not the norm. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the advice - I am part of many lists. I have emailed you a <br/>
group which I think might possibly be good for you. You may not <br/>
accept it but I do not expect you to reply. I believe even in <br/>
unschooling lists, there are certain levels. I&#39;m finally at the <br/>
level I think I can understand what Sandra and the others are <br/>
saying, which is why I&#39;m here. In my early days, I too would have <br/>
been like you, questioning naively thier wisdom.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve since discovered that there is such a thing as being on a wrong <br/>
list, at a wrong time. The fact that Sandra is actually very nice <br/>
and polite is in contrast to views I&#39;ev understood from other new <br/>
unschoolers, one year ago.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While I mostly feel confident in who I am and the decisions I make,<br/>
&gt; the other part of me just wishes I could be like everyone else and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>not fight the system. No home births, no nursing toddlers in public, <br/>
no homeschooling, whatever. I hate being the odd ball out. And yet at<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; night when I think about my choices, I&#39;d have it no other way. But <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do wish I had someone to travel this road with.<br/>
<br/>
Your full confidence is not there yet. You have to continue work to <br/>
eradicate the other half. <br/>
<br/>
Finding the right list is like finding your kindred spirit, a <br/>
healing balm to your soul. Just like any other organisations, be it <br/>
the choir or football or reading club, they all have distinct <br/>
personality and voices. <br/>
<br/>
This list is not the place to be airing your insecurities, <br/>
questioning your unhappy state because it seems like your <br/>
unschooling is going well. It&#39;s only your own insecurities that&#39;s <br/>
playing up. <br/>
<br/>
And with all the numerous replies you&#39;ve recieved, you have yet hear <br/>
the right thing that can help snap you out of it. Because of that, <br/>
you retaliate your refusal by stating you&#39;re doing the opposite, <br/>
Like you did to Katherine&#39;s &quot;waiting&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Katherine gives alot of her time here and a few more group. I resent <br/>
your rebelling, and snapping back at her kindness!!! I think you <br/>
should keep your anger and frustration of your confusion to <br/>
yourself, and not let it spill out onto the group. <br/>
<br/>
This is not a therapy group, and we dont&#39; need to put up with your <br/>
defensive and bear the brunt of your &quot;refusing to let go that last <br/>
bit of comfort blanket&quot; manner. Do not muse out loud on the <br/>
postings, because we will take it as your answer to us. <br/>
<br/>
We are here to help anyone who needs it, the best we can. You have <br/>
baggage and issues, so do a few of us. The fact that we are not <br/>
ignoring you, say enough that you are part of this group. But the <br/>
replies will soon end because that&#39;s what happens when you snap at <br/>
the hand that reaches out to you.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am such a darn people pleaser and I so want to be right, and for <br/>
 </span></blockquote>once I just wish I didn&#39;t care what people thought, and just did <br/>
what *I* want to do, but then I don&#39;t really know what that is...<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the advice - Only please those who DESERVES YOU- so decide <br/>
who they are!! Otherwise,  ignore the rest because you do not <br/>
benefit kindess and happiness from them. Stop living your life <br/>
according to anybody&#39;s rules, because you are not them. <br/>
<br/>
Stop being such a perfectionist!!! There is no hard and fast rules <br/>
in unschooling, other than the basics - we do not co-erced. We treat <br/>
and respect our kids - which is seems you are already doing. <br/>
Becareful when considering other people&#39;s opinion. I have this line <br/>
I use on my family and friends. If it&#39;s not helpful, I dont&#39; want to <br/>
hear about it.   <br/>
<br/>
Do not compare. What we unschooler is doing, and you&#39;re not. We are <br/>
all very unique in our very own ways which is why unschooling works, <br/>
and &quot;cookie cutter&quot; school system don&#39;t. So just read more, explore <br/>
and consider each and every unschooling option you can think, nt <br/>
forgetting all the replies you&#39;ve got. <br/>
<br/>
Take what&#39;s relevant, disregard what&#39;s not. But be gracious about it <br/>
by not challenging their beliefs. I am happy to share and explain my <br/>
beliefs if someone wants to learn, but I can be very rude if they <br/>
are questioning my beliefs and decisions for my family.  <br/>
<br/>
Like you said &quot;examined and tested and hashed about&quot;. Until you&#39;ve <br/>
done and hashed out mentally what&#39;s suggested, do not tell us it <br/>
doesn&#39;t work!    <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know everyone here personally but I accept that I am part of <br/>
this group just as much as everyone, in the short period of less <br/>
than a month here. I don&#39;t need an object or any signal to state I&#39;m <br/>
accepted or not here. I just made myself part of it- just like that. <br/>
<br/>
You mentioned wanting to move forward but on the other hand you&#39;re <br/>
struggling. You asked for help but yet refused to accept our advice. <br/>
But still you&#39;re asking. <br/>
<br/>
Your justification for this:-<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Otherwise,aren&#39;t I simply being a sheep to the unschooling <br/>
 </span></blockquote>shepherd? &gt;If it&#39;s true, it will hold up. If it&#39;s for<br/>
me, I will feel at peace. The first changes I made were as a mother <br/>
and parent. Then this past two years it&#39;s been as a person and my <br/>
faith. And now it&#39;s as a parent yet again...always changing, <br/>
testing, questioning. And sometimes I just want to rest and be SURE <br/>
that I&#39;m &quot;okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so hard fo rme to see why, if you have been unschooling for <br/>
so long, why you are still so unsure and suffering.  It seems to me <br/>
you are still hanging onto rules that&#39;s been banged into your head <br/>
since young. You still have a need to please and seek approval in <br/>
order to reflect that you&#39;re on the right path. In the past few <br/>
years, you did everything you think is best for your kid, without <br/>
analysing and understand why you&#39;re doing it. You were effectively <br/>
being the sheep, following the shepard? <br/>
<br/>
Which explains this panic and unsure of yourself. Which is why you <br/>
cannot defend your beliefs. Which is why you feel odd, compared to <br/>
the people surrounding you because they are just so confident in <br/>
what they believe in, and you&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you asking these questions now, when you have been <br/>
unschooling for so long? <br/>
<br/>
We cannot tell you if you&#39;re right or wrong. Because we don&#39;t know <br/>
you and your circumstances. But I can tell you, the fact you&#39;re <br/>
asking question, perhaps maybe your unschooling is finally <br/>
beginning. You&#39;re no longer blindly doing and following things, you <br/>
are finally questioning the logic, and suitability, and application <br/>
of certain unschooling practices. You are finally awake, realising <br/>
that you need to fix yourself because there&#39;s so many loopholes in <br/>
your beliefs. And you are getting fed-up of feeling defenseless, <br/>
unable to defend all the goodness and right-ness of your unschooling <br/>
decisions when your parenting skills and choice is being contested <br/>
by society.<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps the answer can be simpler. YOU&#39;RE BURNT OUT!!<br/>
Quite a common thing to happen. Take a few weeks out of being so <br/>
concern about what other people thinks, and do some soul searching <br/>
and analyse your life, and where you&#39;re going. It&#39;s only thinking, <br/>
so you can have full permission to daydream as far fethced as you <br/>
want, visulise how you want to feel and indulge in that glory. Think <br/>
of how you can formulate your answers of defense when being <br/>
challenged on your ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Remind yourself everytime, you&#39;re doing your best, and in time <br/>
you&#39;ll understand better. When the going gets tough, just surrender <br/>
to the defeat, throw your hands in the air, and breath out, and <br/>
forget it! Remind yourself that you have so many other options to <br/>
explore. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is all about confidence and faith, of your love for your <br/>
kids. Keep your love for your kids as your beacon of sanity. In my <br/>
early days of unschooling, I too do things I don&#39;t understand other <br/>
that I know it&#39;s the best for my kid, and eventually it will makes <br/>
sense to me - that&#39;s my hold to sanity.  Remind yourself that if <br/>
you&#39;re unhappy, they will feel it. So it is important that you do <br/>
what you can to make yourself happy again. <br/>
<br/>
Again don&#39;t be the perfectionist and think to yourself that you need <br/>
that expensive dinner or that spa taht you can&#39;t afford. Be <br/>
realistic, if you can&#39;t have that, what next best options you have? <br/>
<br/>
Indulge yourself - throw your caution to air and to hell with it. <br/>
Put some music on and go crazy dancing to your favourite song. I put <br/>
Abba if I&#39;m defiant, Andrea Borcelli on if I&#39;m feeling sorry for <br/>
myself. I have been know to go to great lenghts cooking my favourite <br/>
food to cheer myself up. I have many times crawled back into bed <br/>
with my child and read or daydream. <br/>
<br/>
My sanity recuperation is every evening on bed, catching up on my <br/>
reading, son watching Youtube or video. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this is of help to you in some ways. Pls excuse the typos, <br/>
i&#39;m short on time here. <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes<br/>

beginning. You&#39;re no longer blindly doing and following things, you<br/>
are finally questioning the logic, and suitability, and application<br/>
of certain unschooling practices. You are finally awake.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I really think what you said here... &quot;finally awake&quot; ...is exactly what<br/>
often happens of a long time unschooling enthusiast who has yet to come full<br/>
circle and make the life they envisioned their own.<br/>
<br/>
I do sometimes get concerned with how to better make unschooling available.<br/>
The ideas are so abundantly here!  Yet here we are, most of us having gone<br/>
to school and many weighed down with baggage.  I like what someone said<br/>
(Robyn I think) about seeing childhood baggage as no longer part of<br/>
childhood, which is past, but as now part of our current lives!!  We can win<br/>
then and win now, improving and healing both our present and our past, and<br/>
unschooling is sort of like a time machine window for doing that.  What a<br/>
great thing.<br/>
<br/>
Once a person wakes up (and has the distinct possibility of coming full<br/>
circle and making unschooling one&#39;s own), much of what still lies before a<br/>
person to work through seems overwhelming and incongruent with the goal to<br/>
realize a happy life that&#39;s fluidly inclusive of the wonderful freeing<br/>
principles of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There must be quite a few approaches for doing it.  There must be as many<br/>
ways as there are to learn anything else.<br/>
<br/>
One approach is to refrain from meditating by direct thought on<br/>
inconsistencies.  Instead meditate with some side activity along with your<br/>
thinking.  (Side activities can be thought of as a similar notion to<br/>
Sandra&#39;s Truck analogy but with oneself rather than with others in this<br/>
instance).  Activity that sort of puts brain chatter to the left of present<br/>
conversation has some great benefits.  One benefit is to be convinced that<br/>
you are learning even when you&#39;re not directly concentrating on it.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples of such activities:<br/>
yoga<br/>
draw/scribbling in sand/dirt<br/>
play with clay<br/>
sand art<br/>
work puzzles<br/>
play solitaire, tetris, computer games<br/>
<br/>
Some people need more.  Therapy doesn&#39;t always have to be talking and<br/>
thinking more about ourselves when we don&#39;t want to.  We can get into<br/>
self-directed therapy ... like dance, art, music.  If there&#39;s no class<br/>
billed as therapy, take an art, dance or music class with the intent of<br/>
distracting oneself from an over analyzing tendency.  If we need more<br/>
attention, a great thing to do is get a massage or go to a day spa or more<br/>
cheaply, go get made up at the makeup counter.<br/>
