Sorry.<br/>

<br/>
I swear--no offense to any religious people--that Christianity is out to <br/>
get me. A friend of mine teases me about it all the time--wherever I go, <br/>
there it is! For a long time our bedroom phone broadcast a religious <br/>
station in the background. Whenever I was having a conversation, I could <br/>
hear &quot;the LORD sayeth&quot; and &quot;JEsus spoke&quot;--and the person to whom I was <br/>
speaking could hear nothing! One other example, among many: our house is <br/>
being worked on (remember the toilet overflowing upstairs?) and one of <br/>
the subcontractors was playing a Christian radio station so loudly the <br/>
other day that I had to ask him to turn it down. I was going to joke <br/>
about it to his boss and then I found out he, the boss, is also a <br/>
born-again Christian!<br/>

During my 4th pregnancy the midwife was coming to the house for checkups<br/>
and every time she tried to use the doppler to hear the baby&#39;s heart we got<br/>
a country music station playing! It was very strange hearing that coming<br/>
out of your stomach!<br/>
<br/>
We live surrounded by religion here. At first the blasting of the call to<br/>
prayer around the whole city would wake us up but now we barely notice it.<br/>
Sometimes when you are walking you can have 3 mosques within sight of each<br/>
other all with prayers blasting out of loudspeakers. It&#39;s weird at first<br/>
but funny how fast you adapt. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s actually easier to live in an Islamic country than it was to live in<br/>
TN where everyone pushed fundamentalist christianity on you. At least here<br/>
the gov schools aren&#39;t breaking laws when they have enforced prayers unlike<br/>

those people waving their Bibles and shouting. Now I just sigh and roll my <br/>

population of 26,000.  They are all Christian, most of them <br/>
fundamentalist (The Baha&#39;i Faith is here as well, but I have no <br/>
idea what that is.  Hmm, I think I&#39;ll do a search on it).  Saying that, <br/>
I&#39;ve found quite a few &#39;alternative thinkers&#39; up here.  There seems <br/>
to be more diversity moving in.  They don&#39;t seem to sermonize <br/>
around here though.  Apparently, they believe that you can only <br/>
be in God&#39;s favour by associating with fellow Christians (how <br/>
they are supposed to &#39;save&#39; anyone if they aren&#39;t willing to <br/>
associate with them is beyond me).<br/>

We are churchgoers and our faith tradition is important to us in our<br/>
everyday life.  The way I meld this with unschooling is that I have tried<br/>
to encourage an atmosphere where my daughter is comfortable in asking about<br/>
anything and questioning anything, even subjects or words that<br/>
traditionally wouldn&#39;t be allowed or discussed in churchgoing families.<br/>

&quot;Some religions are conducive to unschooling and others, not so much. There&#39;s no reason to sort through them, because each parent who looks at unschooling is looking through her own eyes, with her own knowledge and base beliefs. It doesn&#39;t work for everyone.&quot; is from this page:<br/>

Don&#39;t try to persuade her to believe the &quot;right&quot; way. Share what&#39;s special about it for you.<br/>
<br/>
Not following the rules doesn&#39;t &quot;count&quot; until they&#39;re 13, right? So, depending on how strict your interpretation, you may not want to bring pork into your home, but you can let her know you&#39;ll support her in exploring it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908829102">This thread interests me a lot! My husband and I are both<br/>
semi-practising Muslims... our daughter is only 18 months old, but<br/>
working out how religious practice might fit in an unschooling context<br/>
is something I&#39;ve been thinking about quite a bit lately. Mainly<br/>
because we recently came back from a family holiday (the rest of my<br/>
family aren&#39;t Muslim) where my family drank alcohol and ate bacon on<br/>
occasion... When our daughter showed an interest in either one they<br/>
would be very sweet and say things like &#39;No, this one&#39;s not for you&#39;<br/>
or &#39;No, you don&#39;t want this. You&#39;ll never want to try this one!&#39;. I<br/>
appreciated them trying to take account of our own practices, but<br/>
wasn&#39;t comfortable with their choice of words at all!<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t yet worked out what we&#39;ll do if she wants to try pork or<br/>
alcohol at a later stage, or what we&#39;ll say to my family if it comes<br/>
up again, but the thoughts I&#39;ve had so far are...<br/>
<br/>
In terms of praying and things we&#39;d like her to actively do, we just<br/>
let her see what we&#39;re doing and include her if she wants to (e.g. she<br/>
likes one of us to hold her while we pray and enjoys getting to pass<br/>
our folded prayer mats and other bits and pieces to someone to put<br/>
away when we&#39;re done). We&#39;re very happy with the idea of letting her<br/>
start praying if and when she decides it&#39;s something she wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of pork and alcohol, we still have a bit more talking to do,<br/>
but two of the points Joyce made are definitely part of the plan so<br/>
far. Firstly, I plan to really think through why those things and<br/>
others are important to me (and my husband) so we can come up with a<br/>
clear explanation when she asks, something beyond simply &#39;Because<br/>
we&#39;re Muslim&#39;. And I also like to keep in mind the story of an adult<br/>
friend of mine in Indonesia who happily told me one day that he had in<br/>
fact tasted pork when he was younger. He wouldn&#39;t eat it now as he&#39;s<br/>
an adult, but until he reached puberty (adulthood religiously<br/>
speaking) it wasn&#39;t a &#39;sin&#39; for him to try some. The story is unusual<br/>
(I don&#39;t know if his parents knew about it) but it does actually<br/>
completely fit with religious teachings.<br/>
<br/>
The other religious practice questions we&#39;ll have eventually (much<br/>
further down the track!) will be things like dating and sex before<br/>
marriage... At this point in time I imagine we&#39;ll just approach those<br/>
things the same way any other family would approach practices or<br/>
principles that they value... by being as honest as we can with our<br/>
daughter about why those things are important to us.<br/>
<br/>
One of the main things I feel like we still need to work out is<br/>
whether or not we&#39;re both comfortable with the idea of letting her try<br/>
things like pork (or alcohol!) before she reaches puberty. e.g. what<br/>
if she wants to try some bacon when she&#39;s three or four? I think I&#39;m<br/>
okay with the idea of her trying it, but I have no idea what I&#39;d do if<br/>
she decided she liked it!<br/>
<br/>
I would be really interested to know what approach vegetarian families<br/>
have taken to the issue of their children trying meat... I know it&#39;s<br/>
not exactly the same as a religious practice, but for families where<br/>
their choice to be vegetarian is based on strong ethical objections to<br/>
killing other living beings I imagine there might be some<br/>
similarities?<br/>

I explain them why I choose and prefer not to eat meat. They simply<br/>
wouldn&#39;t eat any as for them eating a piece of dead animal isn&#39;t a choice<br/>
now. It puts them off. They really feel sorry for all those animals being<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m vegan and the other adults in the household are somewhere between<br/>
&quot;vegetarian in practice&quot; and &quot;rarely eats meat&quot;. As a household we<br/>
agreed not to have/cook meat in the house. Currently Leon (17 months)<br/>
eats what we do, so mostly vegan, some eggs, very little dairy as he&#39;s<br/>
growing out of some variety of intolerance.<br/>
<br/>
My current approach is that I would prefer him not to eat meat until<br/>
he&#39;s old enough to understand what he&#39;s eating. At that point if he asks<br/>
I will explain why I don&#39;t eat it (moral/ethical reasons), and if he<br/>
wants to try it, will talk to a nearby close friend who is very<br/>
into cooking, eats good quality free range meat, and is a &quot;whole of the<br/>
animal&quot; eater. (Not that I would want or expect her to talk about all<br/>
that stuff with him unless he was interested, but I&#39;d be more<br/>
comfortable with him trying ethically-farmed meat at least initially.)<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, if what he really wants to try is a McDonald&#39;s<br/>
hamburger, then I think I would prioritise supporting that / our<br/>
relationship over my ethical concerns about fast food meat. Though again<br/>
would be honest about why I choose not to eat there.  <br/>
<br/>
If he decides that he wants to eat meat more often, then we&#39;d have to<br/>
work out how to support that and what would work best for everyone.  I<br/>
confess that I hope he will prefer to stay at least mostly veggie as I<br/>
do like having a meat-free kitchen! <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if he eats a ham sandwich at a party or whatever... I<br/>
won&#39;t be thrilled but I&#39;m not going to freak out about it either. I have<br/>
asked our families not to offer meat, and if they ever make a big deal<br/>
about not offering (unlikely) I will ask them not to do that either  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046179834">My husband and I are vegetarian and our 7 and 5 year old children had never tried meat until very recently when our 7 year old decided to try chicken. My husband and I do not have the exact same reasoning behind our vegetarianism and our kids have heard many different reasons that some people choose not to eat meat. We&#39;ve discussed it casually over the years but never flat out said &quot;You cannot eat meat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got to be frank that it took me a bit to process it when my daughter chose to try meat but I&#39;m so glad that I am making the effort to live my values while supporting her in hers! My husband and I were not with her when she tried chicken for the first time. She and her brother were out with my dad and I got a phone call - my dad said our daughter asked him to call us to check in with us about it and make sure it was ok with us. We found this very thoughtful and sweet. At first I was concerned that she felt she had to ask permission to eat something but, after talking with her about it and getting a feel for the situation, it seems it was more that she was considering how we might feel about it. I am pretty sure she would have been willing to forgo trying it if we had asked her to. <br/>
<br/>
It was amazing to hear her thought process and excitement behind going from vegetarian to omnivore. Several days after her first trying it, she cried and said she wondered if it makes her a bad person for eating meat because she loves animals. She definitely feels some internal conflict between liking the taste/feeling proud of herself for trying something new while loving animals and not wanting them to be killed. <br/>
<br/>
I struggled within myself with the notion that she tried meat. I quickly realized that I liked the IDEA of my children being vegetarians...more that I was comfortable admitting. Fortunately, something I read here once popped into my head. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m wording it wrong but the sentiment was this: Your relationship with your kid needs to be more important than your IDEA of your kid. <br/>
<br/>
I am putting that into practice and enjoying the journey of watching my daughter  wrestle with her ideas and feelings about this; and supporting her along the way.<br/>
<br/>
I realize I didn&#39;t really offer any advice to your specific questions but I wanted to share our recent experience around the topic of vegetarianism.<br/>

&gt; This thread interests me a lot! My husband and I are both<br/>
&gt; semi-practising Muslims... our daughter is only 18 months old, but<br/>
&gt; working out how religious practice might fit in an unschooling context<br/>
&gt; is something I&#39;ve been thinking about quite a bit lately. Mainly<br/>
&gt; because we recently came back from a family holiday (the rest of my<br/>
&gt; family aren&#39;t Muslim) where my family drank alcohol and ate bacon on<br/>
&gt; occasion... When our daughter showed an interest in either one they<br/>
&gt; would be very sweet and say things like &#39;No, this one&#39;s not for you&#39;<br/>
&gt; or &#39;No, you don&#39;t want this. You&#39;ll never want to try this one!&#39;. I<br/>
&gt; appreciated them trying to take account of our own practices, but<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t comfortable with their choice of words at all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We haven&#39;t yet worked out what we&#39;ll do if she wants to try pork or<br/>
&gt; alcohol at a later stage, or what we&#39;ll say to my family if it comes<br/>
&gt; up again, but the thoughts I&#39;ve had so far are...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In terms of praying and things we&#39;d like her to actively do, we just<br/>
&gt; let her see what we&#39;re doing and include her if she wants to (e.g. she<br/>
&gt; likes one of us to hold her while we pray and enjoys getting to pass<br/>
&gt; our folded prayer mats and other bits and pieces to someone to put<br/>
&gt; away when we&#39;re done). We&#39;re very happy with the idea of letting her<br/>
&gt; start praying if and when she decides it&#39;s something she wants to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In terms of pork and alcohol, we still have a bit more talking to do,<br/>
&gt; but two of the points Joyce made are definitely part of the plan so<br/>
&gt; far. Firstly, I plan to really think through why those things and<br/>
&gt; others are important to me (and my husband) so we can come up with a<br/>
&gt; clear explanation when she asks, something beyond simply &#39;Because<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re Muslim&#39;. And I also like to keep in mind the story of an adult<br/>
&gt; friend of mine in Indonesia who happily told me one day that he had in<br/>
&gt; fact tasted pork when he was younger. He wouldn&#39;t eat it now as he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; an adult, but until he reached puberty (adulthood religiously<br/>
&gt; speaking) it wasn&#39;t a &#39;sin&#39; for him to try some. The story is unusual<br/>
&gt; (I don&#39;t know if his parents knew about it) but it does actually<br/>
&gt; completely fit with religious teachings.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other religious practice questions we&#39;ll have eventually (much<br/>
&gt; further down the track!) will be things like dating and sex before<br/>
&gt; marriage... At this point in time I imagine we&#39;ll just approach those<br/>
&gt; things the same way any other family would approach practices or<br/>
&gt; principles that they value... by being as honest as we can with our<br/>
&gt; daughter about why those things are important to us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the main things I feel like we still need to work out is<br/>
&gt; whether or not we&#39;re both comfortable with the idea of letting her try<br/>
&gt; things like pork (or alcohol!) before she reaches puberty. e.g. what<br/>
&gt; if she wants to try some bacon when she&#39;s three or four? I think I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; okay with the idea of her trying it, but I have no idea what I&#39;d do if<br/>
&gt; she decided she liked it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would be really interested to know what approach vegetarian families<br/>
&gt; have taken to the issue of their children trying meat... I know it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not exactly the same as a religious practice, but for families where<br/>
&gt; their choice to be vegetarian is based on strong ethical objections to<br/>
&gt; killing other living beings I imagine there might be some<br/>
&gt; similarities?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28092563">I&#39;ve been a vegetarian for 20 years, but my partner and kids are omnivores. I buy and cook the best organic meat I can, while also cooking lots of meals without meat. I give my kids the foods they like. <br/>
<br/>
For me, being a vegetarian is a profound philosophical choice that I arrived at through my own inclination, reading and experiences. It doesn&#39;t make sense for me to impose this choice on others because they are not me. In the same way, adhering to a religious faith is/should be a profoundly personal decision. Until children are old enough to make up their own minds, I don&#39;t think they should be considered to &#39;be&#39; a particular faith. Children of religious parents grow up within the traditions/practices of their parents&#39; beliefs, and the more those practices make sense, and the more that scope is provided for experimentation outside those practices, then the more likely it is that the children will genuinely respect their parents&#39; choices, whether they choose to adopt the same religious creed or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Morgan was younger I worried about what &quot;approach&quot; to take - with food as well as other things. What actually happened was that she saw something and wanted to try it and I wanted to help her explore the world. So she had some McD&#39;s chicken nuggets and liked them. For awhile it was the only meat she would eat - while at the same time not liking to eat cookies shaped like animals! I bought her some at McD&#39;s, some in the freezer section of the grocery, made some from scratch, and made some veggie nuggets out of chick peas. She liked McD&#39;s best of the lot. Eventually, she decided she didn&#39;t want to eat chicken nuggets even though she liked them.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that helped me most as an unschooling parent was stepping back from ideas like &quot;what approach should I take?&quot; and &quot;how am I going to expose my kid to this?&quot; and instead look at my kid and think about what she wants, what interests her, what she seems to be trying to discover - and be curious about and amazed by that. Thinking about approaches and exposure was a way of seeing life with my kid as a series of lessons with hoped-for outcomes and right answers, which left me disconnected from my real kid, her interests and desires, and our relationship. It has helped instead to think about what kind of person I want to be, and what I value - what do I want to see More of in the world? And then make choices that take me in those directions. I want more peace and sweetness and communication - so it&#39;s important to me to be sweet, to look for peaceful options, and to open myself up to understand what my kid is telling me... especially as she&#39;s not much of a talker!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That especially as she&#39;s not much of a talker&quot; really hits home with me.  My middle son (10 years old) is so hard to read.  He talks but when and where he feels comfortable.  And it&#39;s often not when and where I want him to.  For example, at a restaurant he suddenly becomes sullen and uncommunicative,  he insists he wants to leave and begins to get upset.  Typically, I&#39;m patient, I know him well enough to know its a smell, the noise, confusion about the menu, so we go through each thing like a guessing game.  With very little communication from him, we usually muddle through it, often leaving early.  Then some days later her will tell me what it was.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are all vegetarians,  they have all eaten meat, and it is my guess they will again at some point, especially my youngest who just loves all food.  I have my reasons but they are mine, each person has to figure out theirs.  I don&#39;t cook it though, I think I&#39;d get sick.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042266509">We are Indians and I was born into a practicing Hindu family. Hindus do not<br/>
eat beef because of religious reasons. As a child I lived in Dubai with my<br/>
parents. My sister and I explored different kinds of meat there. Especially<br/>
beef burgers. My parents did not stop us from exploring. However they did<br/>
not eat themselves. When I asked my mother she would say..&quot;I am just not<br/>
used to eating beef. But you guys can eat if you want to.&quot; She did not cook<br/>
beef at home. When I married, my husband&#39;s family was also Hindu but they<br/>
ate all sorts of meat. I started to cook beef, pork and all else! When my<br/>
sister and I got together at mum&#39;s place I cooked beef in her kitchen and<br/>
she did not mind it or object. She continued to not eat.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to unschooling and food and other religious practices, I<br/>
personally feel for me unschooling has been about allowing my children to<br/>
find out for themselves what religion means to them. And they do this by<br/>
asking me and others. We do this in our family through conversations and<br/>
sharing our deepest values. I myself have been practicing only meditation<br/>
as a daily practice. I do not pray as a Hindu anymore. For me the Hindu<br/>
signs and symbols and gods and goddesses have taken deeper meaning about<br/>
nature, Universe or life forces and compassion and empathy.<br/>
<br/>
Religion for me has been for a long time now about personal choices and<br/>
deeper values that move me as a human being with relation to the world. I<br/>
encourage my children to perceive the world according to their inherent<br/>
perceptions or consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
In our family, a lot of emphasis is on the individual consciousness and<br/>
what that consciousness brings to the child in terms of food choices and<br/>
other choices they make for themselves naturally and organically. I see<br/>
myself as an observer and partner in those choices and facilitating them. I<br/>
try not to polarize choices that my children make. By polarization I<br/>
mean...calling a food choice or other choices right or wrong, bad or good,<br/>
healthy or unhealthy. Instead we try to talk about them and see from what<br/>
space the choice is stemming from. There are many choices that are<br/>
imitations from the surroundings and environment that we as a family live<br/>
in..and then there are choices that are naturally emerging from a deeper<br/>
authentic place within...I do feel it is important to live through choices<br/>
to learn what stays and what doesn&#39;t stay with the child&#39;s true nature, for<br/>
the parent and the child.<br/>
<br/>
In Advaita the philosophy of Non-duality which is the absence of Polarity<br/>
there is a saying called ..&quot;Neti neti neti&quot;...which means negating through<br/>
living choices...it means in English..&quot;Not this not this not this&quot; And<br/>
equally there is another word which is said in the same breath that means<br/>
&quot;this too that too&quot;<br/>
