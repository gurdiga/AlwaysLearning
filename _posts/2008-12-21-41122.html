<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277677560">It is funny how similar the growth of unschooling is like the  growth of <br/>
kids: when you&#39;re exposed to the incremental sproutings all day long,  every day, <br/>
you just don&#39;t notice how far they&#39;ve grown until you turn around one  day and <br/>
are surprised at how much taller they are...<br/>
 <br/>
Gradually, over the last 2 years, my kids have been more  willing to spend <br/>
time with my parents without either Dave or I-always their  choice, but <br/>
something keeps drawing Wyl back. I don&#39;t think Storm&#39;s gotten quite  old enough to be <br/>
more &quot;controlled child&quot; from the &quot;adored baby&quot; stage, so I  don&#39;t think he&#39;s <br/>
really gotten much negativity at their house. Wyl, on the other  hand, has at <br/>
times, gotten the brunt of their, &quot;He needs discipline&quot; attitude.  He wanted <br/>
to go with his brother today to visit them. They were gone about 5  hours, and <br/>
as he entered the house from being dropped off by them, he said,  &quot;Finally-I&#39;m <br/>
somewhere where people respect me!&quot; Poor kid... he keeps hoping for  the best <br/>
from them and they keep disappointing him. (I used to know the  feeling)<br/>
 <br/>
What a wow for me, though. After I welcomed him home and heard  what he had <br/>
to say, I wondered when that had become such a &quot;given&quot;. The path we  were on <br/>
before we found unschooling would never have led us here to this point,  <br/>
certainly. A year ago, a comment like that from my eldest would likely have  given me <br/>
a feeling of pride, or maybe &quot;ah-HA! I told you so!&quot; kind of feeling.  Today, <br/>
though, I was sad for my son. Sad that he had to learn that so many  adults <br/>
have a condescending or even demeaning attitude toward kids, for no other  <br/>
reason than because they&#39;re young.<br/>
 <br/>
I am *SO* glad, though, that Dave and I have come far  enough as parents that <br/>
our kids know they deserve to be respected. I can&#39;t begin  to imagine how far <br/>
this will take them in their lives... to start so many more  years younger <br/>
than I, to believe - no, to inherently *know* they are whole,  respectable <br/>
people who deserve better from people than they get sometimes.  What kind of <br/>
self-confidence and inner knowledge does that give a person? I  don&#39;t know myself, <br/>
but I&#39;m happy to find out what the future  brings.<br/>
 <br/>
Just one of those, &quot;Wow! When did you grow so much?!&quot; kind of  moments I <br/>
wanted to share.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
I note the &quot;had to.&quot;  He chose to!  He&#39;s learning it near to home,  <br/>
with grandparents who love him, and a respectful home to return to!   <br/>
Many more children learn it with teachers and other public figures  <br/>
they didnt choose to be with, and then they return home to more of  <br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that story, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so sad, really!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With all the neighbor kids being out of school for holidays and snow<br/>
days, they&#39;ve been out and present.  Margaux went out several times to<br/>
play with them and each time came back almost in tears by their mean<br/>
behavior.  She&#39;s upset by it, but now won&#39;t play with them because her<br/>
desperation to play with other kids is less than her desire to be<br/>
treated kindly.<br/>
<br/>
The other day was particularly bad.  Margaux still wanted to be out<br/>
playing in the snow, so I told Chamille that Margaux was being dissed by<br/>
the neighbor girls and Chamille promptly put on snow gear with me and we<br/>
both went out to be her friend.  We made a nice snowman together.  I<br/>
love that while Chamille is so much older than her sister and they<br/>
rarely play together, that in time of need, she jumps to the occasion to<br/>
be there for her sister.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille never had this issue when she was little.  It could be<br/>
personality, and I&#39;m sure part of it is, but Chamille said that a huge<br/>
difference is that, when she was out playing with neighbor kids, she<br/>
played with sibling groups and none of these kids are like that.  It&#39;s<br/>
more like school playground behavior, with a bunch of individual girls,<br/>
none of them are very nice, yet they seem to play just fine with each<br/>
other.  For some reason they ostracize Margaux.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the reason is, I&#39;m really glad that Margaux doesn&#39;t put up with<br/>
the behavior just to play with kids, she has more self respect than<br/>
that, and I&#39;ll be her buddy until she finds some nicer kids in the<br/>
neighborhood.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-838718641">Karl has this with relatives and it&#39;s evident to me during holidays when we<br/>
travel to see them.  They are fine with certain things but not Karl who is<br/>
used to doing some things he likes and then trading off to do things others<br/>
like for a while.  At the relatives it&#39;s mostly what they like and since he<br/>
is only one, he doesn&#39;t get a turn much with others playing what he wants<br/>
to.  When we first got here Monday, the cousin his age wanted to play by his<br/>
rules not Karl&#39;s, and Karl refused to play for a bit because he thought rule<br/>
making should be shared not monopolized.  His cousin *really* wanted to play<br/>
and agreed when I explained that Karl wanted to make some of the rules too.<br/>
Oh.  Ok he said.  And away they went.  Gradually though, not being used to<br/>
sharing but more prone to competing for dominance, the cousins have<br/>
basically just done what they&#39;re used to.  I don&#39;t expect them to change<br/>
what they usually do.  Karl is overall glad to go by the time we&#39;ve been<br/>
there for a while (several states away from home).  Nice for a visit ... not<br/>
the place to live though.<br/>
