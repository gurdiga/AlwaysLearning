&gt; I was so lucky in my first divorce that my husband and<br/>
&gt; I were able to be so fair with each other.  Nobody<br/>
&gt; could believe it.  We had married at 17 and had been<br/>
&gt; married almost 17 years and it wasn&#39;t easy on either<br/>
&gt; of us to divorce but we wanted to keep things as easy<br/>
&gt; as we could.  We did a do-it-yourself divorce for $75<br/>
&gt; and I let him have the house and basically everything<br/>
&gt; in it, traded our weekends with the kids when we<br/>
&gt; needed to...  The judge sure seemed to have not seen<br/>
&gt; such an easy divorce.  Of course, we weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; homeschooling...<br/>

we could have lawyers on base advise us, and we just would have to pay the <br/>
filing fees.  I tried to do that, but each time I&#39;d present the papers to <br/>
Russ he&#39;d spend over a month with them, and then do them incorrectly.  He was <br/>
messing with me - as he had the house, and all the military retirement going <br/>
to him (by law half was mine, but he didn&#39;t have to give it to me until the <br/>
divorce was final).  Russ&#39; orginal family history was that control of the <br/>
money was tied to &quot;love&quot;.  He was mad, and I was to suffer.  It didn&#39;t matter <br/>
that the kids were suffering too.  He constantly re-enforced my decision to <br/>
end the marriage!<br/>
