<div id="ygrps-yiv-735762632">I was hoping to get some advice about a situation we are dealing with right<br/>
now. <br/>
<br/>
We have just moved to a new area (rural) with only one neighbor. They have 2<br/>
children (5 & 2) and are a blended family with grandma raising the children.<br/>
I have 2 (7dd & 9ds). We have lived here just 3 weeks. I was excited at<br/>
first that my children would have new friends but it seems to be turning in<br/>
a bad direction. My dd has been called a stupid b**ch numerous times and<br/>
been hit and shoved many times. My ds came home crying and very upset today<br/>
that the little boy who is 5 had just thrown a kitten down 2 flights of<br/>
stairs. They are also very belligerent and rude to their grandmother. I am<br/>
not comfortable at all with the situation but I have never been in a<br/>
situation of having to step between mine and other people&#39;s children. My ds<br/>
has just about had it and is choosing not to play with the children much the<br/>
last few days but my dd, who is very social, still wants to play with them<br/>
all the time. How do you all feel about telling a child who they can play<br/>
with and who they can&#39;t? Is this a decision she needs to come to on her own?<br/>
I have talked to the little boy about how he was treating my dd and he seems<br/>
receptive and apologetic, but dd is back just a few minutes later crying.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it is okay for me to ask this here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Dawn<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You protect your kids and find a way to say &quot;yes&quot; to your kid&#39;s  <br/>
desire to play with them. I&#39;d think that would mean they play at your  <br/>
house, under your supervision, only. And then you watch closely and  <br/>
help those kids learn how to behave at your house. Send them home any  <br/>
time your kids say they should go, but, unless things get worse, with  <br/>
the option of them returning soon. They&#39;re very little, there is a  <br/>
chance they could learn to behave better at your house than they do  <br/>
at home - a good chance.<br/>
<br/>
If the neighbors want to know why your kids don&#39;t play at their  <br/>
house, you can say, &quot;They&#39;re just not comfortable with that, right  <br/>
now.&quot; No more explanation needed.<br/>

It will give you lots to discuss that might not have come up otherwise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405027402">Yikes, Dawn. My heart goes out to you. My dd (nearly 7) says that you <br/>
consider letting your daughter make her own choices. She has had at least <br/>
one relationship turn around. I greatly reduced the number of opportunities <br/>
for the offender to be in our company. I insisted that the offender (there <br/>
has been more than one abusive girl in our lives) be with my dd when I was <br/>
within earshot, at least and the moment that there was something that my <br/>
daughter was upset to tears, the &#39;date&#39; immediately ended. I also have <br/>
spoken to at least one of the girls, letting her know that I understand that <br/>
her homelife may be contributing to her choices and that I expect her to <br/>
make respectful choices in her words and actions and that nothing else works <br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about me too.<br/>
