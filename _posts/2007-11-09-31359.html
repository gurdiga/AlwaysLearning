<div id="ygrps-yiv-734602610">I &quot;see&quot; things through my own history, my own experiences and my kids have  <br/>
far different experiences and histories than I do, so sometimes I&#39;m just not  <br/>
sure about whether to share, to strew, to offer. Just because it would affect <br/>
me  one way doesn&#39;t mean it would affect them that way.<br/>
 <br/>
Wyl (8 1/2) is a drawer of Pokemon-type, RPG-type monsters that he has  <br/>
created in his own imagination. His family on his dad&#39;s side and my parents are  <br/>
very artistic and can draw and paint *very* well (I&#39;m absolutely NO talent in  <br/>
this area, myself), but I haven&#39;t experience myself with what &quot;age&quot; or when,  <br/>
developmentally, the details blossom-if there is even a &quot;something&quot; that can be <br/>
 pinpointed for details. He was showing me some of his fabulous creations <br/>
today,  complete with names and &quot;skills&quot; (he didn&#39;t use to include their skills <br/>
on  paper, but would tell us-at this point, he is making them &quot;roadsign&quot;  <br/>
mini-pictures and explaining what the mini-pictures mean). His drawings are  still <br/>
mostly stick-figure, but bodies kind of fleshed out from the stick part,  <br/>
IYKWIM, and I was wondering if I should bring a book about &quot;how to draw&quot; into  the <br/>
house. If it were me at that age (heck, likely if it were me at *this* age),  <br/>
I would likely take a book like that to mean that my drawing was being judged <br/>
 and found lacking, so I don&#39;t want to induce this in my child(ren), but <br/>
who&#39;s to  say their thoughts would even venture that way? (I know, I&#39;m probably <br/>
WAY  overanalyzing things, but....) Anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on <br/>
this?  Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
De<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974375120">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I was wondering if I should bring a book about &quot;how to draw&quot; into  the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; house. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dd is a huge artist, and uses her drawings to tell stories and to comment <br/>
and process her life and things that she has seen.<br/>
<br/>
One of our relatives sent her a &quot;How to draw Disney Fairies&quot; kit - a book, <br/>
some paper and some little pencils etc. This was of course well meant, and <br/>
with the intention of supporting Jayn&#39;s interest in both drawing and <br/>
fairies.<br/>
<br/>
She was interested in looking at the book, which was a fairly classic <br/>
step-by-step to producing the finished character, and she particularly <br/>
enjoyed when I read the instructions out loud to her because they were <br/>
written in a didactic way that I could make sound funny and exaggerated. Eg: <br/>
&quot;Are her lips pointed? No. Make them rounded and soft&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, Jayn did a couple of drawings following the instructions and then <br/>
decided herself that she preferred to just look at the characters and do her <br/>
own drawing. She felt that her results from her own techniques were better <br/>
and more in tune with her creative vision. And tbh I think her own drawings <br/>
have a lot more life in them than the structured ones from following the <br/>
instructions.<br/>
<br/>
In this case she didn&#39;t take the book as a criticism, but I have noticed in <br/>
general that she prefers her own method to any kind of intructional thing, <br/>
even though she will often give the thing a try. For example she watched a <br/>
person doing fabric painting and making illustrated pillows on a craft show, <br/>
and then drew a couple of her own renditions on paper to try out the style. <br/>
But her purpose in watching such craft shows is to be inspired, not because <br/>
she or I or anyone else in her life see her as somehow lacking something.<br/>
<br/>
Every now and then when we are at the bookstore I will come upon an art book <br/>
and show it to her. Also we get several magazines that are about her <br/>
interests - Art Doll Quarterly, Doll Crafter, Haute Doll etc - which <br/>
sometime feature how to&#39;s, plus the couple of artist magazines that I get <br/>
which have how to articles. She enjoys looking at the sometimes, but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t take them as being a comment on her own work.<br/>
<br/>
I think that rather than bringing a drawing book home unasked, point out <br/>
books about pokemon artistry and the art of anime characters next time you <br/>
are at the store, or pick up some magazines about Pokemon and anime that are <br/>
not necessarily kids mags (ie not Nickelodeon magazine) and aren&#39;t how to <br/>
draw publications, but still support his interest and will foster his <br/>
ability to visualize the characters.<br/>
<br/>
Also just keep supplying high quality tools and real art supplies. The <br/>
drawing tools make a big difference to Jayn&#39;s various styles - fine line <br/>
markers and mechanical pencils produce a much different result than starting <br/>
with crayons or colored pencils. She likes having the variety and choices of <br/>
all her materials.<br/>

What she did like was the big posters of all the Pokemon (which at  <br/>
the time could fit on a poster ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d take him to the library or a book store and show him what&#39;s  <br/>
available that has Pokemon in it. They also have Pokedex type books   <br/>
with one Pokemon per page and all their stats. She loved those too.<br/>
<br/>
His drawing might not be a need to reproduce what&#39;s in front of him,  <br/>
as the books assume it is. It could very well be an exploration. Kat  <br/>
has several 3&quot; binders of creatures she&#39;s designed, literally thousands.<br/>

It isn&#39;t. He rarely draws &quot;actual&quot; Pokemon-it is 99% his own creations. Wyl  <br/>
has at least 40 of the 70-page spiral notebooks, some of which are filled,  <br/>
some are about half full and some just have a few. I love the creativity and  <br/>
enjoyment he gets from sitting, sometimes for hours, putting the stuff in his  <br/>
head onto paper. I thought maybe I could &quot;do something&quot; to enhance it, but now  <br/>
I&#39;m thinking the best thing I can *do* is to continue to provide supplies, be <br/>
 available for viewing when he&#39;s ready to share and quit *trying so hard*.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter is 8 and she loves how to draw books.  She gets several of them each week when we go to the library.  She will usually draw one picture a week from the books and about 20 of her own pictures.  She is constantly drawing, but she always asks other people what to draw.  She doesn&#39;t usually decide on her own.  <br/>
<br/>
You could always point out where they are at the library and then she can decide if she wants them or not.  I do this all the time when I find a new section at the library.  I just ask the kids &quot; Hey, did you know they have _____ books over there?&quot;  Sometimes they are interested, other times not.  <br/>

drawing,&quot; instead of &quot;this is *HOW TO DRAW*.<br/>
