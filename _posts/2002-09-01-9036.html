I was expelled from highschool for a week my sophomore year. I wore a shirt  <br/>
that said something like (I would have to dig it out to get it right, so  <br/>
don&#39;t quote me. &lt;G&gt;) *Nuke a godless, communist, gay, baby seal for Christ*  <br/>
One of the principals saw me in the hall, stopped me, and told me I had to go  <br/>
change my shirt. I told him I would have to go home because I wasn&#39;t in the  <br/>
habit of bringing a change of clothes to school. He huffed and said, *Just  <br/>
turn it inside out right now!* so I made motions to take my shirt off, right  <br/>
in front of him, asking if he knew how much trouble he could get into for  <br/>
asking a teenaged girl to turn her shirt out right in front of him. He got  <br/>
real pissed and marched me into his office and called my Dad. My Dad asked  <br/>
him if he knew what the shirt meant, and the principal told him he didn&#39;t  <br/>
have to know what a shirt meant, to know it was wrong! &lt;g&gt; My Dad told me to  <br/>
wear it every day for a week (he washed it for me every night.) and that&#39;s  <br/>
how I got suspended.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I should clarify. My dad is great in many ways, and he loves us the <br/>
best way he knows. But as a person, and not a father, he is a great guy, but <br/>
he is also in many ways, a closed minded, verbally abusive, hard edged, <br/>
bigoted, opinionated, jerk. He was very intune to problems I had at school, <br/>
and helped me in many ways, but he was also remote, and unforgiving. I was <br/>
very depressed for years, I had been sexually abused, and I tried to kill <br/>
myself. Dad saw that (my attempted suicide, not the abuse. He has never been <br/>
told about that.) as a reflection on him and our family and since that time <br/>
has never been able to forgive me for that particular sin. And has, since <br/>
that time been very distant towards me, and that has extended to being <br/>
distant toward my kids as well. So I guess, if you needed a guy to stick up <br/>
for you, he is probably the best, but if you needed to be understood for <br/>
something different, well then, I wouldn&#39;t send my worst enemy to him. <br/>
