<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362143403">-=-I&#39;m still not sold on the argument about the violence factor being  <br/>
negligible, but I&#39;m exploring all that.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Where are you doing your exploring?<br/>
Guessing you&#39;ve already followed links here:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page_">http://sandradodd.com/games/page_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page)">http://sandradodd.com/games/page)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
What might help a lot is going to a gaming shop, hanging out casual-like,  <br/>
looking at the model paints or the used DVDs or the magazines, and listening and <br/>
 observing the behavior of the older boys.   To make it useful, though,  you <br/>
need to think of some other places where teens hang out and go there and  look <br/>
at them there too.  See who seems peaceful and thoughtful and  courteous.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re going  to the Live and Learn conference, find Kirby or  Marty, and <br/>
see what you think.   YEARS of video game playing.   Try to piss them off, if <br/>
you want to, and see if they get violent.  Hit  them and see if they hit back. <br/>
 I won&#39;t warn them, because that would mar  the science of your exploration.<br/>
 <br/>
Just two nights ago, Marty came in and said the online games are becoming  <br/>
fashion shows, and that Kirby and his clan were in there designing matching  <br/>
pirate outfits for themselves on World of Warcraft.    One of  Holly&#39;s favorites <br/>
of the past few months is a group game called Karaoke  Revolution.  I&#39;ve <br/>
played.  The first thing you do is name your  character, choose what you&#39;ll look <br/>
like, and pick some clothes.  One of the  things you can gain by playing well is <br/>
more choices of clothes.<br/>
 <br/>
This probably developed out of games where you could choose which character  <br/>
you wanted to be, such as Mario 2, where you could be Mario or Luigi or the  <br/>
Princess or Yoshi (I think).  Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, let  you <br/>
choose your persona.  And Kirby just said &quot;All of these games do,&quot; and  <br/>
gestured in such a way as I think he meant Halo 2, World of Warcraft,  Morrowind.<br/>
 <br/>
In my experience with people who have grown up to be violent, they were  <br/>
either tormented physically or verbally, they were controlled and limited, they  <br/>
were made to feel small, they were shamed, punished and spanked.  Unless  <br/>
violence came along sometime after video games, it is ludicrous to blame  violence <br/>
on that, particularly when schools have never been so controlling,  limiting, <br/>
small-making and punishing of older kids before now.  When  schools were new, <br/>
it was not at all unusual for people to go for a couple or  three years and <br/>
drop out after they learned to read and learned some math.   Three of my four <br/>
grandparents dropped out in what would now be considered  elementary school.  <br/>
One finished high school.  Both my parents dropped  out in what would be <br/>
considered high school.  By then (the 40&#39;s) people had  to be pregnant to get out of <br/>
school earlier than 15 or so, and some got pregnant  just to get the heck out <br/>
of there, I hear.   My sister dropped  out.<br/>
 <br/>
None of those people would nowadays be legally allowed to stop going to  <br/>
school.  They would keep them until they were 18.  Home lives are  adjusted to <br/>
match, and 17 and 18 year old boys are treated like little  children.   When that <br/>
naturally and understandably makes kids violent,  the schools and the parents <br/>
love to blame TV, movies and video games.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s really okay to think, to look around and SEE directly without anyone  <br/>
else&#39;s interpretation what IS oppressive and what is not.  You don&#39;t need  to <br/>
shop for an expert.  You can become a direct observer of your son and of  the <br/>
behaviors around you.  If something seems like bullshit, look at it  critically <br/>
and curiously and turn it around and look at the back, and at its  history, <br/>
and at the motivation of its maker.  Don&#39;t reject it whole and go  to the next <br/>
expert.<br/>

-----------------<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s not the point.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t want people to take my word for anything, I want them to find ways  <br/>
to know for themselves what is real and useful and where unschooling can take  <br/>
them.  <br/>
 <br/>
If anyone depends on another person&#39;s word as a source, she is susceptible  <br/>
to being duped or to deciding at some point that her chosen leader isn&#39;t  <br/>
flawless, and might reject ALL of what that person says.<br/>
 <br/>
Finding out for oneself is learning.<br/>
Trusting blindly is ignorance.<br/>
 <br/>
Learning who to trust, for real reasons, and knowing that trust isn&#39;t  <br/>
enough:  that&#39;s commendable.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I learned from personal experience that it&#39;s no longer possible to  <br/>
hit Kirby.  Four or five years ago I was really angry at something he had  said <br/>
about something obnoxious he had done (I don&#39;t remember what) and I tried  to <br/>
slap him.  He blocked it gently and calmly.  That was  however-many-years ago <br/>
in his karate training.  Now he could probably dodge  it without physical <br/>
contact.  I no longer have the urge to try  anyway.  We both got older. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Seamus would likely hit back, and has bouts of &quot;violence&quot; (losing <br/>
his temper), but he&#39;s been like that since toddlerhood, way before <br/>
he started playing videogames or watching much on tv but Blue&#39;s <br/>
Clues. Other than the occasional bouts of &quot;losing it&quot; he&#39;s <br/>
rarely &quot;violent&quot;...in fact the older he&#39;s gotten, the better his <br/>
control is, and yet he plays more video games than when he was <br/>
littler. I wouldnt really define his behavior as &quot;violence&quot; though <br/>
so much as a biological surge of adrenaline that he is learning to <br/>
control/manage.<br/>
<br/>
I do think playing videogames or computer games does bring out alot <br/>
of frustration,in a way that ,say, playing legos does not, and he&#39;s <br/>
the type of kid to want to throw the game down or pitch it across <br/>
the room, become incoherent and sob about how nothing ever goes <br/>
right in his life and he never wants to play that stupid game again. <br/>
What usually helps in these situations is reminding him how he <br/>
*always* gets past that difficult point, and then helping him look <br/>
up cheats and walkthroughs on the internet.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seamus is into the online game Everquest right now (and we&#39;ve also <br/>
kept busy playing the PS version Champions of Norath...much fun, and <br/>
easier for me than Everquest, i can&#39;t think that fast, nor battle a <br/>
huge spider while chatting with someone and tallying up how much <br/>
platinum i need to buy that cool sword...but i digress....)Even <br/>
though the game involves &quot;violence&quot; (killing creatures and such)he <br/>
seems way more interested in making his armor look super cool or <br/>
upgrading his weapons. He&#39;s totally into getting &quot;stuff&quot; (potions, <br/>
clothes, scrolls, whatever), but discovered that perhaps instead of <br/>
spending all his &quot;money&quot; on amassing large amounts of stuff, he <br/>
should put it in the &quot;bank&quot; and save it for something he truly <br/>
wants, and that if he leaves it where he can easily spend it, he <br/>
usually will just spend spend spend. I told him that principle can <br/>
apply to &quot;real&quot; life as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think its also important to think not in terms of &quot;do videogames <br/>
make kids violent?&quot; but rather will videogames cause your specific <br/>
child to be more violent? It seems that a child raised with respect, <br/>
in a fun, caring unschooling home would be way more impacted by that <br/>
environment than whatever virtual game they may play.<br/>
<br/>
I also think there is alot of hysteria out there...i was watching <br/>
some news program in which a man was being interviewed <br/>
about &quot;keeping our kids safe from videogames&quot; or something, and his <br/>
example of the evils of videogames was some porn-type game that you <br/>
can get online that i&#39;ve never heard of. Thats not what kids are <br/>
playing. Its like saying kids shouldnt read magazines because <br/>
Hustler is really bad for them.<br/>

 <br/>
I flipped the quotes backwards.  <br/>
YES, helping kids find a way to do things is central to being a good  parent, <br/>
I think, unschooling or not.  Drives me crazy when parents pat  themselves on <br/>
their lazy heads for &quot;letting the kids figure it out on their  own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do  think playing videogames or computer games does bring out alot <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So school wouldn&#39;t be better for him, and forbidding games probably  wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be better for him.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems to me WAY more useful for him to learn to control frustration at  <br/>
home with a game than to be channeled away from frustration so that he might get <br/>
 his first experience in a bar or at a bowling alley.<br/>
 <br/>
Some people were never in fights at school, but for many people it&#39;s  <br/>
considered just a regular part of being at school, that people will get in  fights.  <br/>
Asking them, &quot;So, are there many fights where you work?&quot; makes  them look at <br/>
you like you&#39;re stupid, but the stupidity is sticking kids in a  <br/>
kid-prison-farm situation far from adults who really care about their  feelings.<br/>
 <br/>
So.  Video games cause that?  In a student body of 300ish kids  when I was <br/>
teaching Jr. High, we had one fight a week, usually, but three if it  was going <br/>
to snow.  Weird.   Video games weren&#39;t even invented,  except for Pong.  <br/>
 <br/>
At the gaming store where Kirby worked for years, nary a fight.  <br/>
In his own life/room, a few yelling matches about people&#39;s games getting  <br/>
deleted accidentally by another kid, a couple of broken controllers years back,  <br/>
much parental peacemaking instead of punishment, advice on keeping tempers  <br/>
(reasons to in the realm of morality, law, finances, peace and personal  <br/>
satisfaction).  No fights school-style.  No sneakiness or  dishonesty.  <br/>
 <br/>
Games are scapegoated for too much by too many, I think.<br/>

And -- by the way - you should had heard Rosie&#39;s frustration the other <br/>

book has gotten closed without her place being marked. So - maybe we <br/>
should limit the length of books she is allowed to read, because she <br/>

spend a LOT of time sitting around with other moms - not homeschooling <br/>
moms, much less unschooling moms.<br/>
<br/>
So - I get to hear a LOT of this kind of stuff. I just look at them. A <br/>
bit blankly. If pressed, I just say, &quot;Do you think Angel would be <br/>
interested in that?&quot; Fill in their kid&#39;s actual name - I mean - at <br/>
least get them thinking about their OWN child as opposed to just <br/>
following some general guidelines meant to apply to everybody.<br/>
<br/>
Someone (a teen) organized a little holiday party for a bunch of <br/>
homeschooled teens - mostly unschooling, not all, but all SUPER nice <br/>
kind of geeky extremely wholesome &lt;G&gt; kids.  She just followed sort of <br/>
a &quot;template&quot; for those who organize teen events - and included in her <br/>
invitation: &quot;No drugs, alcohol, or weapons.&quot; She&#39;d probably read <br/>
somewhere that that&#39;s what you should say. Or she&#39;d gotten an <br/>
invitation from somewhere else that said that. The kids thought it was <br/>
very very funny. First - the idea that they&#39;d be doing drugs or <br/>
drinking was odd to them -- but the funny part was the &quot;no weapons&quot; - <br/>
the party was in a karate studio and there are weapons hanging all OVER <br/>
the place in there. Many of the kids study at that studio and use those <br/>
weapons all the time!<br/>

You could require her to read to the end of a chapter, or lose her reading  <br/>

 <br/>
You could take the book away from her for a week if she whimpers or cries  <br/>
about losing her place.<br/>

But limiting her to very small books she can read in one sitting seems to  <br/>
solve the frustration problem in the traditional fashion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   You beat me to posting it Pam! My 7 yo ds is much more <br/>
comfortable with computer games as well, although he has just this <br/>
week - on his 3rd try - been able to erect a small lego structure <br/>
using the actual small legos. My ds is like dh in that he has large <br/>
fingers that arn&#39;t good for really small things without a lot of <br/>
work. Although he will get frustrated at either when things aren&#39;t <br/>
going as planned. <br/>
   I think I am starting to see his &quot;plan&quot; emerging though - if he <br/>
gets too frustrated then he quits, then later he either comes back & <br/>
trys it again (IF it is important to him otherwise he may have just <br/>
quit it for good -for now) and sometimes he will even get frustrated <br/>
again, sometimes he will ask for help (occasionally I will ask him <br/>
if he wants help as well, but most of the time he gives me a brick <br/>
wall and I am becoming confident in his ability to ask me for what <br/>
he needs as he becomes older as well, but I also like for him to <br/>
just know that I&#39;m available for him.) Anyhow if it is important to <br/>
him (I should probably add &quot;at the time&quot; as well because sometimes <br/>
he will quit something for months or years before trying again) he <br/>
will work at it until he gets it, even if that means quiting several <br/>
times. <br/>
    When he was younger I got upset at him when he quit and he quit <br/>
a LOT (in my opinion then) like baseball, soccar, gymnastics, <br/>
swimming lessons, etc. But now I&#39;m pretty happy that I did listen to <br/>
him and let him quit, although I think I could have even been more <br/>
accepting of it, as I am learning to be now that I see his &quot;plan&quot;. I <br/>
am so happy to have figured that out! I think children handle <br/>
frustration differently but if we follow their lead then we can <br/>
learn how we can be more helpful to them. Once again my ds is <br/>
teaching me stuff!</div>
