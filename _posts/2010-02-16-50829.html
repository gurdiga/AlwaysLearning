<div id="ygrps-yiv-986962640">I subscribe to the blog Quantum Learning and today&#39;s post reminded me of how often fear is mentioned as a factor in making unschooling difficult when starting out.  At first I was confused by the article, thinking Why would you want to live with fear?, but as I read it, I started to understand the tone.  It&#39;s a very good summary of the different ways we can be fearful, often unconsciously, and why doing these things is hurtful.<br/>

There are other Quantum Learning blogs and sites I saw, but that one  <br/>
has an article on fearfulness.<br/>
