<div id="ygrps-yiv-711890736">I am trying to get things together for my 7 yr old dd&#39;s birthday .   I had<br/>
 this idea to have the kids make puppets and put on a puppet show at the<br/>
end.<br/>
     Unfortunately,  due to a certain Fly lady&#39;s influence,  I am lacking in<br/>
 spare socks.<br/>
 Can someone suggest simple things to make puppets from?   I have plenty of<br/>
 pom-poms,  pipe cleaners,  scprap materials,  scrap felt.....<br/>
 I&#39;ve got about 10 kids 7-12 coming.....and 3-5,  3-5 yr olds.<br/>
 help<br/>

paper or cardboard, decorate and then glue it on a popsicle stick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381495611">Thanks&lt;  Mary.....I&#39;m too sleep deprived to think this through...oh,  that&#39;s<br/>
another thread.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking those little round paper plates on a stick would be good...and<br/>
quick to get the stuff together for the procrastinator that I&#39;ve been on<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
So we have little round paper plates....maybe a few other shapes of scrap<br/>
card board....popsicle sticks,  scrap yarn,  fabric scissors, glitter glue,<br/>
scrap fabric,  glue,  pom-poms, NO paints! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Voila!  Let &#39;em have fun,  be creative,   make a BIG mess (why did the<br/>
temperature have to drop 40 degrees NOW and I can&#39;t have this done<br/>
outside?!)<br/>
Sounds fun?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had forgotten about this but my brother used to make puppets for Dylan<br/>
out of paper bags.  He had a lot of them with different faces and we<br/>
called them &quot;Mr. Glad Sack&quot;  &quot;Mr. Mad Sack&quot;  &quot;Mr. Bad Sack&quot;  Those kinds<br/>
of things.  Very silly, but it was fun.  If you use big enough bags and<br/>
cut out eye holes ( eyesholes?)  they can be masks too and then you can<br/>
have a bunch of bruised up kids  &#39;cause they&#39;re running into stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
You could do Frodo BAGgins.  Ed BAGley Jr.  Osama BAG Ladin.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve done a few puppet shows with our homeschool group.<br/>
Once my 2 boys acted out the entire story of &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot; in<br/>
puppets. I helped draw some of the characters on cardstock and cut them out<br/>
in paper-doll fashion and then they were glued to sticks. The whole play was<br/>
a big hit!<br/>
<br/>
The kids in our homeschool group also did entire puppet shows on &quot;the<br/>
Grinch&quot; and &quot;Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer&quot; and also the whole &quot;Christmas<br/>
Story&quot; with Mary, Joseph, baby Jesus, wise men and donkeys.<br/>
<br/>
The kids used all sorts of materials for making the puppets from socks to<br/>
styrofoam to foam padding, cardstock, all sorts of crafty materials (lace,<br/>
fur, interesting fabrics) and attached everything to long dowels. These<br/>
shows were hard work in preparation but well worth it and they had so much<br/>
fun performing them. They even performed for a local preschool group 2<br/>
times, not to mention adoring family members. Great fun!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mary&#39;s ideas are better than my thrift-shop-socks one, and reminds me that <br/>
you could use paper towels wrapped around the kid&#39;s hand and taped, so they <br/>
can hold the stick puppets.  You can just make the stick part out of the <br/>
cardboard too, so you have a long piece of cardboard to hold and the face is <br/>
painted and then you put a paper &quot;dress&quot; on it.<br/>
<br/>
Or it could be a whole cutout person, flat, and the kid holds it with a <br/>
handle fastened on behind.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s been making marionettes out of toilet paper tubes and empty paper <br/>
towel rolls, string and dowels.  She tapes tissue paper on and then makes <br/>
faces with balloons.  It&#39;s odd and complicated, but she makes them work!  <br/>
One&#39;s kind of a horse-looking thing, or a dog, and it&#39;s big.  And one was... <br/>
I don&#39;t know what it was.<br/>

<br/>
If they  hang the puppets down (like marionettes) they won&#39;t get as tired as <br/>
if they crouch and hold them up.   And they could have a string on each one <br/>
(fastened to the top of the dowel so they ARE, in part, marionettes, or have <br/>
one &quot;moving part.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We were reading a book about marionette-making, and one guy makes the hands <br/>
with pipe-cleaners, and then puts a glove over that.  So it &quot;just&quot; looks like <br/>
a stuffed hand, but he can pose them between scenes, or they can hold swords <br/>
or goblets (it was Aladdin they were showing in the book).<br/>

  Oh, they attached everything to the top of the dowels. The kids were crouching/kneeling underneath a stage curtain for the puppet show above. I don&#39;t know how all these kids could have hung the puppets marionette style without some staging to standing on. They were all trying to be hidden from view - they even wore all black clothes and black socks on their hands against a black curtain background. Now that I think about it though, it could have been doable. They could have stood on the ground and had the stage lower and had a curtain covering their legs. We have a few marionettes that we picked up on a trip to Mexico. They are really fun to play with.<br/>
<br/>
  BTW, speaking of curtains, seeing my e-mail addy up there makes it look like I&#39;m hiding from something, too. I&#39;m Karin Curtin and live in Phoenix, AZ.<br/>
  I&#39;m not hiding from anyone and not afraid of stalkers.<br/>
  But I&#39;ve heard some stories about people having their identities stolen from strangers.<br/>
  And it really messes up your credit and is a hassle to straighten out.<br/>
  Has anyone else ever heard of that happening?<br/>
  It does sound pretty paranoid to be afraid of that, though.<br/>
  Since ya&#39;ll are being so let loose and carefree about your names on the internet, maybe I should relax a little too!<br/>
