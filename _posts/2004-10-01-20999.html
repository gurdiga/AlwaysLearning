<div id="ygrps-yiv-160931106">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I have an interesting new situation (interesting and new to me anyway &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
My 14 yo ds has been going to an art high school after unschooling for two<br/>
years. He says he&#39;s thinking about unschooling again, and two of his friends<br/>
want to join him, go figure. They have similar aspirations to make music<br/>
together. Now these other two boys&#39; parents have called me saying their sons<br/>
want to join my ds &quot;homeschooling&quot;, and would I mind talking to them about<br/>
that. I had one conversation with one of the moms, and tried to explain that<br/>
the way we &quot;homeschool&quot; probably looks different from how she may be<br/>
thinking, and went on to talk about learning through living and kids<br/>
deciding what they do each day. She&#39;s intrigued and interested, but is also<br/>
ingrained with typical public school thinking (&quot;Now, how will they keep up<br/>
with math exactly?&quot; &quot;I really like your ideas, I believe that way too. I<br/>
just need Taylor to keep up with his grade level...how would that work?&quot;) I<br/>
really have no interest in convincing her of anything, and I certainly have<br/>
no interest in &quot;educating&quot; her son. I also will not do anything that would<br/>
take away any of my already somewhat stretched energy for my own four. I am<br/>
happy to include him when it makes sense for us, and even more than that<br/>
sometimes, but not otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to include these other boys in our unschool environment, I also<br/>
wonder whether I should do something to make sure there is no liability<br/>
involved. If this evolves into them being over here, do you recommend I put<br/>
something in writing for the parents to sign acknowledging that I take no<br/>
responsibility for their sons&#39; learning? Seems like crazy/paranoid<br/>
questions, but they seem pretty real right now. Has anyone added their kids&#39;<br/>
friends from the p.s. system into their days as unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t get all worked up about it. Chances are it won&#39;t happen.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been asked to be in the same position numerous times----but  neither the <br/>
parent OR the child is actually willling to go through with  it.<br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;ll be talked out of it by  <br/>
parents/spouse/in-laws/friends/neighbors/teachers/themselves. They won&#39;t want to  file the paperwork that the state <br/>
requires.<br/>
They won&#39;t read anything on unschooling, so they won&#39;t even learn what it  <br/>
really is.<br/>
They&#39;ll still want *proof* in the form of  booklists/tests/grades/whatever.<br/>
 <br/>
Seriously----don&#39;t get worked up over it. It probably won&#39;t happen. They  <br/>
don&#39;t really WANT it to happen. If they DO, they can do it themselves.  Really.<br/>
 <br/>
If they insist, give them a booklist and websites to read. (They won&#39;t!)  <br/>
Then they can make an informed decision and do it themselves. It&#39;s THEIR  <br/>
responsibility, not yours.<br/>

<br/>
I appreciate your feedback...I&#39;m not worked up about it. Just a serious<br/>
question based on where I think this is going. I had another conversation<br/>
with the same mom...she says she&#39;s really interested. I know that her<br/>
driving force is her son feeling desperate in his school situation and just<br/>
wanting out. She works. She wants help for her son. She&#39;s asking about him<br/>
spending time here. My son wants to create with him. So for my son, it would<br/>
be a good situation. The two of them are good friends.<br/>
<br/>
But because she works and isn&#39;t available to help her son the way that he&#39;s<br/>
asking, I think she will settle for what she can get to ease him right now.<br/>
Which I foresee puts him here, if we get this worked out. I want to be<br/>
prepared. I don&#39;t want to be blamed for anything 5 months down the line when<br/>
he&#39;s not up on his calculus. By agreeing to have him here, I want it to be<br/>
real clear what that means. I will certainly continue to give her resources<br/>
for reading about unschooling, but I can&#39;t make her read them.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m coming to the conclusion that I&#39;m not going to feel comfortable<br/>
without a signed acknowledgement and permission form by the mom. Otherwise,<br/>
I have no recourse if things get weird. I have been in a few unfortunate<br/>
situations where head nods and &quot;yeah&#39;s&quot; did not end up meaning a person<br/>
understood or agreed in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Sudbury Valley School has some documents parents have to sign saying things<br/>
like &quot;kids do what they want here&quot; so that it&#39;s clear they are not taking<br/>
responsibility for what kids choose to do each day. I think I&#39;ll look that<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Any similar situations out there?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
How about --&quot;Unschooled kids learn math as they need it.  They may not progress at the same rate as kids in school.  If there is some math they never need, they may never learn it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And -- &quot;If you want to unschool, you have to let go of the idea of steady, linear progress at the same rate as in institutional school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a very positive spin on it, but it might break through her preconceptions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975641731">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
this reminds me of our first experience with homeschooling, 4 years <br/>
ago... we decided to not attend kindergarten but had no idea what else <br/>
we would &quot;do&quot;, and met another mom who had lots of ideas, she *liked* <br/>
us a lot and proposed we could all meet for impromptu classes... she <br/>
planned all this stuff and wanted everyone to follow her lead, we <br/>
didn&#39;t want to follow her lead it was too complicated... so we went to <br/>
another group which catered to homeschoolers, it was pretty <br/>
unsatisfying, just a smaller less strict school... I called the &quot;ideas <br/>
mom&quot; into the class thinking she wanted this, but instead she <br/>
identified the things she wanted for the school and started to <br/>
introduce changes... then the group got agitated and split up a few <br/>
months later, the final straw...<br/>
<br/>
we finally stopped attending any and all type of class, now we just <br/>
drop in occasionally on a free day... when other homeschoolers call us <br/>
to join their cub scouts, field trips or reading groups, we think about <br/>
the terrible year we spent with the &quot;organized people&quot; and decline... <br/>
it&#39;s so much easier on our own, and that&#39;s enough for me... my story <br/>
isn&#39;t too similar to yours but the thing that seems familiar is the <br/>
*other person* getting involved in your life, asking you to do things <br/>
for her... after going through my experience, I feel like keeping to <br/>
myself and answering questions about our interests, but not at all <br/>
excited about sharing our situation or extending an invitation to come <br/>
and join us...<br/>
<br/>

It won&#39;t be homeschooling, and you could make that really clear--that he will <br/>
be learning ALL the time, in his life, but that if he&#39;s to be homeschooled, <br/>
the mom will still be responsible for that during the hours she&#39;s not at work.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of hours in a week.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d be basically just doing daycare, not running a private school.<br/>

<br/>
Is she planning on paying you? There is a lot of difference between setting<br/>
yourself up as what might in legal terms be a tutor, and having your son&#39;s<br/>
buddy hanging out at your house and doing a bunch of interesting stuff.<br/>
Check the State Laws in your state ( www.nhen.org for info) and maybe laws<br/>
covering tutoring organizations (I&#39;m thinking of those places that advertise<br/>
&quot;up a full grade level in reading&quot; as a guarantee). The liability laws you<br/>
may want to research probably have to do with day care providers more than<br/>
tutors. Also check your home owner&#39;s insurance.<br/>
<br/>
If your friend is expecting you to ensure that her son keeps up with the<br/>
state standards in calculus or any subject, she clearly doesn&#39;t understand<br/>
unschooling. Maybe *she* should get clearer on that before you start<br/>
offering to keep her son busy in a full time manner. <br/>
