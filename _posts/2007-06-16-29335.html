<div id="ygrps-yiv-144448782">With the discussion about hair colour / personal expression, I thought<br/>
I&#39;d add in the following warts and all account of my internal<br/>
processes and some of the external around a piercing not-in-earlobe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
K: Mum, can I have a labret for my twelfth birthday? <br/>
Me: What&#39;s a labret? <br/>
K: A lip piercing. <br/>
Me: &lt;pause&gt; Oh, well let&#39;s look into it. <br/>
<br/>
Call me oldfashioned and uncool, but I would&#39;ve felt more relaxed if<br/>
she&#39;d been asking for more holes in her earlobes. I&#39;ve always fancied,<br/>
but never gotten a nose piercing. I have a tattoo on my back that I<br/>
got when I was in my twenties (I&#39;m 42 now). So it&#39;s not that I&#39;m<br/>
averse to body art / piercings, I just wasn&#39;t sure how much some of<br/>
the rest of the world might have a prob with it on a youngish person.<br/>
Of course, what school would say about it wasn&#39;t an issue for us by<br/>
then, still, there were questions I thought worth thinking about. <br/>
<br/>
I wondered about the possible dental prob&#39;s with mouth piercings; how<br/>
the local Home Ed group would feel about it (would we be asked to<br/>
leave because they thought it inappropriate?); how might future<br/>
employers perceive piercings not-in-ears (my sibling was good here,<br/>
she had a brow piercing and hadn&#39;t had prob&#39;s getting part-time work<br/>
in our fairly conservative town at a chain book store and pizza place<br/>
with it - though she did have to take it out for her shifts - and<br/>
could only think of one employer she&#39;d ever had who would definitely<br/>
NOT have taken her on because of it). <br/>
<br/>
K did a major google search (something I used to do for her, mostly -<br/>
though she does it much more herself nowadays). There were a lot of<br/>
hits to dental sites that warned of possible prob&#39;s, mostly with<br/>
tongue piercing, not so much lips, wearing on enamel and such. She<br/>
looked at sites of people who did have labrets to get the real life<br/>
experiences side of things, and got some good tips about care and the<br/>
occasional problem people had experienced. <br/>
<br/>
It was pretty close to her birthday at the time and I kinda had other<br/>
plans, so I ended up saying &quot;well, howabout for your thirteenth, if<br/>
you still want it, or if before then, probably paying for it<br/>
yourself&quot;. We&#39;d checked out the costs of the piercing itself, care<br/>
products, etc, and had discovered that one piercing place in town<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do under 14&#39;s, even with parental permission. Thankfully, one<br/>
professional place was fine with it, though I still had to sign my<br/>
permission. <br/>
<br/>
So, K got a labret about two months after her twelfth birthday, (she&#39;s<br/>
14 now), which she paid for herself mostly with birthday money from<br/>
other family members. She&#39;d decided she wouldn&#39;t have cared much if<br/>
the local HE group didn&#39;t continue to welcome us (nobody&#39;s said<br/>
anything, though we don&#39;t do much with them since our very busy first<br/>
year). <br/>
<br/>
K had her last visit to the &quot;school&quot; dental nurse she&#39;d been seeing<br/>
since she was three, post piercing, and the dental nurse was fine with<br/>
it from her personal and professional pov. <br/>
<br/>
There wasn&#39;t any acrimony around my sort of stalling on saying yes,<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t saying no outright, and have no habit of doing so<br/>
arbitrarily. K knows I can be a tad bit fogeyish in my outlook<br/>
sometimes, a little slow to embrace some things - much as I&#39;d like to<br/>
deny that altogether - just `cause I was raised differently, in<br/>
different times. And it is oftentimes wise to explore before<br/>
committing, I reckon.  <br/>
