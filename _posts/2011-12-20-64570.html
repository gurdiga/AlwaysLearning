<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569619687">&lt;&lt;&lt;THIS September? You mean the other day, two or three months  ago?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Yep, my divorce began this September. I had felt like the b/f from 11 years <br/>
 ago was &quot;sent&quot; to us by fate or guardian angels or whatever, and i was <br/>
feeling  vulnerable, alone, and the knight on the white horse rode up at the <br/>
right time.  I immersed myself into the new relationship. Definitely never <br/>
planned it. My  normal support networks were gone due to many circumstances <br/>
that happened with  my ex-husband. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I would go more slowly, put your daughter first, don&#39;t get  involved in <br/>
the other business, raise your kids &quot;in parallel play&quot; for a bit,  and see <br/>
what comparisons naturally arise.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After this weekend, we have chosen to keep out visits to one day a weekend. <br/>
 Im sad, but relieved at once. Someone else mentioned about that&#39;s why <br/>
these  types of intimate close connections are saved til marriage, & i agree <br/>
with  part because i am feeling that separation from the person, but longed for <br/>
more  productive time with my daughter. I didn&#39;t get involved with the <br/>
business of the  other child this weekend, for the first time, and while i had <br/>
my daughter bring  her own toys, books, etc, the little boy still was jumping <br/>
all her with joy for  some attention. She has no space, had given up on <br/>
trying to show or discuss  things with him. It seems impossible to parallel <br/>
play, she has tried. the son  enjoys her, but she grows weary of his <br/>
breakdowns. Being only 8, i cant blame  her for not having that much patience anymore. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;That could change after a while, when the kids miss them or  situations <br/>
change. It could happen.&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
Neither parent in both situation got even supervised visitation, its  <br/>
probably healthier in both cases if neither sees the other abusive parent again.  <br/>
The court&#39;s call. Things could change, but not in the forseeable future, <br/>
both  have PFA&#39;s of 3 & 5 years. <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Also having an impact on your daughter, whether she&#39;ll admit it  or <br/>
realize it or not. Your unschooling can&#39;t thrive in the sad shadow of another  <br/>
kid&#39;s sorrow, and it&#39;s not your responsibility to keep the other child happy <br/>
if  it&#39;s at your daughter&#39;s expense.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I agree. I&#39;ve done enough, and &quot;robbed Peter to pay Paul&quot; as the saying  <br/>
goes. My daughter&#39;s time has been compromised. We even took him to and picked  <br/>
him up from school a few times, where they played in the playground after <br/>
there  for a bit, but my daughter felt compelled to look after the boy, as <br/>
she seemed  to get along well with the children there, and the boy was crying <br/>
constantly  over something. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Maybe the best thing you can do for that boy is to step aside a  way and <br/>
show what unschooling can look like. But even you can&#39;t see what it will  <br/>
look like if you&#39;re embroiled in school-fueled sorrow.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you, and I feel I had tried such, and it seems everything i try to  <br/>
set a subtle example, causes chaos and upsets the father because his son is  <br/>
thrown off a schedule by playing too long and &quot;getting cranky after bedtime&quot; <br/>
or  other such- hate to say it, but silly myths. <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;His grandmother isn&#39;t her grandmother. I wouldn&#39;t stay there.  Visit, <br/>
but don&#39;t live there. If your house is peaceful and his is increasingly  not, <br/>
you will be a lure. If you stay there, you just keep THEIR house from being  <br/>
peaceful. No peace for anybody.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Our house is in turmoil right now as we are preparing to move, and also  <br/>
filled with my exes stuff that he left behind so its not the most comfortable  <br/>
setting. I admit, i used his place as a refuge for my own peace for a bit, <br/>
but  the honeymoon stage is blowing over, and the grandmother&#39;s opinions are <br/>
starting  to have an impact on me. She once referred to my daughter as her <br/>
new  granddaughter, this made me happy and afraid all at once. What i went <br/>
through  with my own mother to understand our choice to unschool was enough. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;The first part seems right. The middle part, maybe not even a  full <br/>
school year. the last part!? MY ALARM WENT Woop/Woop/Woop. Don&#39;t justify  your <br/>
romance with it being good for your daughter. I don&#39;t know (don&#39;t need to  <br/>
know) details, but he might be a relatively positive male role model, but he&#39;s <br/>
 recently divorced and is letting his mother persuade him to do old-timey,  <br/>
sorrow-inducing things to his own child. Perhaps some distance is in order <br/>
while  you consider how positive it all is.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I agree also on these points. My desire to have a real &quot;family&quot; was winning <br/>
 over my logical and enjoyable everyday life with my daughter. We are free <br/>
from  the abusive marriage i was in, but while he agreed with unschooling, <br/>
it was not  healthy. This boyfriend, while helping us through the healing <br/>
part of the  fallout, & not physically abusive, isnt seeming to adhere or any  <br/>
longer to our lifestyle or allowing us the time to enjoy or freedom.  <br/>
Therefore could be just as emotionally damaging. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Not your responsibility.<br/>
He can&#39;t look up to her if she&#39;s  being a faker about bedtimes, and hiding <br/>
food.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
True, the answer used to be &quot;because she&#39;s older&quot;, not now. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It would sure make his life easier, for a week or so, if  you would put <br/>
your daughter in school, wouldn&#39;t it? And honestly, if your  daughter DOES <br/>
really like the guy, and she wouldn&#39;t mind school, and if this  could lead to <br/>
marriage and the guy could support you all, maybe it&#39;s worth  considering. <br/>
Practicalities are real.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, make his life easier, not mine. not hers. She and i had talked about  <br/>
the possibilities of the future, and briefed over these. This time last <br/>
month he  & i were discussing living together in New Jersey, (we are in PA) and  <br/>
next year looking at bigger plans, and i admit the school his son attends <br/>
is  much different than ANY ive seen or witnessed in my experience. But time <br/>
and  stress over things lately have cancelled out his father asking us to <br/>
live  there. So we are currently looking for a place nearby, where he even <br/>
said way  back, &quot;i would never put my son into the Philadelphia school system, <br/>
no wonder  you dont do school!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;We can&#39;t change the situation for you. I can tell you, though,  for <br/>
sure, that if you allow that negativity to poison your daughter&#39;s happiness,  <br/>
and your relationship with her, you aren&#39;t being a very good partner to your  <br/>
daughter.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I appreciate just having a group to bounce the stuff around that&#39;s in  my <br/>
head. No unschooling friends or networks near me. Thank you. I had hoped  <br/>
coming here for words get me back in a clear place with some perspective.  <br/>
Sometimes i wonder if its me, &quot;treating her like a 20 year old rather than a  <br/>
kid&quot;, yes that was said to me by a so-called friend i no longer talk with.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;You can still love them, just from a little greater  distance, maybe.<br/>
You could tell him that he seems to be hurting his son, and  you&#39;re not <br/>
interested in expanding that hurt to your  daughter.<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
thank you. I feel he&#39;s really struggling right now and at one time i  may <br/>
have seemed like a good gentle step mother material for them both, to help  <br/>
out, but now i think he realizes without me saying it that theres something <br/>
else  more here with his son that needs addressing with his acting out and i <br/>
wont be  adding anymore advice anytime soon. <br/>
 <br/>
Your inputs so appreciated! -Lynne<br/>
