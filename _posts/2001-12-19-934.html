<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030928176">Mine are 7 and 4 and believe. I have started to lay groundwork, though, for<br/>
the future. We talk a lot about myths and make-believe and I&#39;m getting a lot<br/>
of questions these days about, &quot;Is this real?&quot; from my 7 year old. The<br/>
latest was Pokemon. I knew she was hoping desperately they WERE real, so I<br/>
let her down easy, the one before that was a dead body on a TV drama and she<br/>
was relieved to know it was an actor.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in some aspects of Santa myself (the spirit of altruistic giving<br/>
at Christmas time) so I don&#39;t mind the girls believing in the actual jolly<br/>
fat guy for awhile. If they are upset down the road, I&#39;ll apologize for not<br/>
being more factual than fun, but for now, I think we&#39;re doing the right<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Part of anyone&#39;s decision may be how they felt when they found out as<br/>
children - I was filled with a sense of my own cleverness (not an unusual<br/>
reaction from me &lt;g&gt;) in figuring it out, followed quickly by a<br/>
determination to intentionally continue to believe at a certain level.<br/>

Something I&#39;ve been wondering.<br/>
How does Santa fit in with unschooling?<br/>
How many here have kids who believe in Santa?<br/>
What age, if any, should this belief stop?<br/>
<br/>
My kids do believe in Santa. They are 8 & 10.<br/>
I am beginning to squirm.<br/>
I would love to hear how other&#39;s have handled this, and still managed to<br/>
maintain some dignity for their kids.<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to wonder if we have handled this the wrong way.<br/>
My thinking has changed a lot since we&#39;ve started unschooling, including my<br/>
thoughts about Santa.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus<br/>
<br/>
Editorial printed in the New York Sun in 1897.<br/>
<br/>
We take pleasure in answering thus prominently the communication <br/>
below, expressing at the same time our great gratification that its <br/>
faithful author is numbered among the friends of The Sun:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Editor---<br/>
<br/>
       I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no <br/>
Santa Claus. Papa says, &quot;If you see it in The Sun, it&#39;s so.&quot; Please <br/>
tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?<br/>
<br/>
      Virginia O&#39;Hanlon<br/>
<br/>
Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by <br/>
the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they <br/>
see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by <br/>
their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men&#39;s or <br/>
children&#39;s, are little. In this great universe of ours, man is a mere <br/>
insect, an ant, in his intellect as compared with the boundless world <br/>
about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the <br/>
whole of truth and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love <br/>
and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and <br/>
give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would <br/>
be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as <br/>
if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, <br/>
no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should <br/>
have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The external light with <br/>
which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.<br/>
<br/>
Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies. <br/>
You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on <br/>
Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa <br/>
Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, <br/>
but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real <br/>
things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. <br/>
Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but <br/>
that&#39;s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or <br/>
imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.<br/>
<br/>
You tear apart the baby&#39;s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, <br/>
but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest <br/>
man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever <br/>
lived could tear apart. Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push <br/>
aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory <br/>
beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is <br/>
nothing else real and abiding.<br/>
<br/>
No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives and lives forever. A thousand <br/>
years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will <br/>
continue to make glad the heart of childhood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135195296">As a heathen, I find Santa fascinating. We all celebrate Santa to the hilt. <br/>
You just won&#39;t find a manger scene here!<br/>
<br/>
Our motto: &quot;If you don&#39;t believe, you don&#39;t receive!&quot;  (said in the Johnny <br/>
Cochran voice!)<br/>
<br/>
We even went so far as to have a friend who dresses up as Santa for many <br/>
charities in town to come over late one night a week before Christmas (this <br/>
was when my oldest son was 5 or 6). We removed the fireplace screen, set out <br/>
cookies and milk, lit the tree, etc. The place looked exactly like the house <br/>
on Xmas eve. With the video camera on, we taped &quot;Santa&quot; as he backed out of <br/>
the fireplace with his bag. He put all the presents under the <br/>
tree---including the new bike, stuffed the stockings, ate his cookies and <br/>
drank his milk, and hung candy canes on the tree.<br/>
<br/>
The clean up from that was far worse than the cleanup Christmas morning!<br/>
<br/>
Christmas eve, after we removed the screen, set out the milk and cookies, <br/>
etc. AGAIN, my husband had the &quot;really neat idea&quot; to set up the video camera <br/>
to &quot;catch Santa in the act&quot;. Cameron was SOOOO excited to see the film the n<br/>
ext morning: he had PROOF that there was a Santa for YEARS even when his <br/>
friends insisted there wasn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
I was teribbly worried about the &quot;truth&quot; when he got older. But by then, he <br/>
had a younger brother (8 years apart) and was willing to &quot;play Santa&quot; for <br/>
him. So the let-down wasn&#39;t bad. There had been MUCH talk of fantasy and <br/>
fairy tales and spirits up to that point too---it was kind of a natural <br/>
growing-up progression.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Santa&quot; was here today for a party for the 5-6 year olds. Cameron was <br/>
excited, as an almost 14 year old, to see Hal and they talked a while about <br/>
the film and how many parties Hal has left before Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
We also celebrate Nicholas Day on the 6th (since Cameron was born in <br/>
Germany)---and he fills shoes with candy and fruit and nuts. You can NEVER <br/>
have enough Santa!<br/>
<br/>
Santa also doesn&#39;t come to a dirty house, so it gets right clean here on the <br/>
24th!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, the tooth fairy&#39;s big here too! She leaves beautiful coins (foreign <br/>
coins or silver or gold dollars) and fairy dust (glitter) everywhere!<br/>
The Easter bunny leaves bunny turds (mini-marshmallows) and bunny dust <br/>
(xxxsugar) all over the house.  (I vacuum a lot)<br/>
And you ought to see what kind of havoc those leprechauns can create! Green <br/>
EVERYwhere!<br/>
<br/>
We LOVE fantasy creatures! There&#39;s a lot of fantastic stuff that happens <br/>
everyday; we just really go crazy on a holiday. I can&#39;t speak for Duncan (5), <br/>
but Cameron has always loved the idea of Santa. And he said that he had no <br/>
problem with finding out---and over the years, he&#39;s thought of several new <br/>
&quot;tricks&quot; for the leprechauns and those slippery elves that show up every year <br/>
as we trim the tree!<br/>
<br/>
Long live Santa!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100172142">My 10yo son very much believed in Santa until this year. It was <br/>
worrying me because I had a nephew who at 13 found out the truth and <br/>
it really upset him. He&#39;d been telling his friends for years that of <br/>
course Santa was real, his parents wouldn&#39;t lie to him. When he found <br/>
out he was furious with them and didn&#39;t trust them nearly as much as <br/>
he had before. So I kept hoping my son would question me about Santa <br/>
so I could tell him. He never did. Before Easter this year I worked <br/>
the subject around to the Easter Bunny in such a way that he did ask <br/>
me about that reality. I told him, with reassurances of continuing <br/>
visits by said bunny and lots of love in those visits. He cried :-( <br/>
He went away, came back and asked about the tooth fairy. I told him, <br/>
he nodded. He went away and cried some more then came back and <br/>
said, &quot;Please tell me that Santa is real, that it&#39;s not just you.&quot; I <br/>
just hugged him and he knew and he cried a LOT. I don&#39;t know how I <br/>
should have handled the whole thing better but that much crying was <br/>
not a sign that I&#39;d done the right thing. He wouldn&#39;t even discuss it <br/>
for a while after that but gradually got around to jokes about me <br/>
ruining his childhood and spoiling his innocence! Now that it is <br/>
close to Christmas, he is back to being happy about Santa even <br/>
knowing what he knows. He&#39;s been working on a Santa website. He&#39;s <br/>
sewed a felt Santa for a decoration. He bought a couple of Santa <br/>
figurines this year. All seems to be well, thank goodness. <br/>

&quot;Santa&quot; on it, I would really know there was no Santa Claus.  Well, I was so<br/>
afraid of bursting the bubble for my parents that I held on to the fantasy<br/>
for another 2 years before I told them I knew the truth.  My parents got<br/>
SOOO excited for christmas, etc &quot;I&quot; had to let them down easy.  My fathers<br/>
family had this elaborate christmas eve celebration when he was young and it<br/>
was so fun maybe he didn&#39;t want to give it up, I will never know.<br/>
<br/>
In our home now, we have &quot;mom and dad&quot; gifts and &quot;Santa&quot; gifts.  Gifts do<br/>
not go under the tree until Christmas Eve.  We celebrate St. Nicholas day on<br/>
December 6th(a family/german tradition).  We talk quite a bit about the<br/>
spirit of christmas, the spirit of the Santa figure etc, but Dana has yet to<br/>
dive full and ask questions.  I told her that the tooth fairy wasn&#39;t real<br/>
and she said, &quot;Mom, you just don&#39;t know about fairies and wishes&quot;.  So, I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728857070">My niece was TERRIFIED of Santa. She was scared scared SCARED silly that he&#39;d <br/>
come in their house during the night. I can&#39;t remember how old she was <br/>
exactly, but maybe 3, when she realized that they had NO FIREPLACE. She was <br/>
GLEEFULL -- there was no WAY Santa could get into their house if they were <br/>
careful to lock the doors and windows!!!! My sister and bil didn&#39;t know what <br/>
to do -- she seemed to be oblivious to the fact that Santa had come the year <br/>
before (maybe she assumed they&#39;d left a window open or something). She was so <br/>
SURE and so HAPPY that Santa wouldn&#39;t come - they didn&#39;t know what to do <br/>
about it. My sister and bil are serious traditionalists - it was just killing <br/>
them to think of not having Santa at all. So - somebody said to my niece, &quot;I <br/>
bet Santa will leave your presents at Grandma&#39;s house, if he can&#39;t get into <br/>
your house.&quot; That was FINE with her -- she was thrilled. So - that&#39;s what my <br/>
sister and bil did for years -- put all my niece&#39;s Santa presents at my mom&#39;s <br/>
house - just a few blocks away - and they&#39;d all get up on Christmas morning <br/>
and go over there in their jammies and slippers and open Santa presents. <br/>
She&#39;d give them cocoa and toast and I&#39;m sure my mom just really loved it!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad they were creative with their solution - because it turned out so <br/>
nice. <br/>

the whole Santa thing with his daughter so I went along with it.  Then we <br/>
did the same with our son.  I was uncomfortable with it at first, but then <br/>
I realized my husband&#39;s reasons.  He *loves* giving, and his favorite way <br/>
of giving is anonymously.  All those presents from Santa were presents that <br/>
he wasn&#39;t taking credit for giving.<br/>
<br/>
My step-daughter remembers being a bit disappointed when she found <br/>
out.  (She refused to believe my older son when he told her Santa wasn&#39;t <br/>
real, which he wasn&#39;t supposed to do.  It wasn&#39;t until my mother told her <br/>
that the Easter Bunny wasn&#39;t real that she accepted that Santa and the <br/>
Tooth Fairy probably weren&#39;t real either.  LOL!)<br/>

Lars seems to have figured out the truth around age 7, but he never <br/>
admitted it until I finally asked a year or two ago.  (He&#39;s 14.)  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it hurt either of them, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d do it again.  (Then <br/>
again, I won&#39;t be doing the kid thing again, so it&#39;s a moot point.)<br/>

<br/>
Well, at our house, Santa was a much celebrated figure -- still is, although <br/>
this is the first year both my kids know for certain that I do much of the <br/>
Santa stuff (they&#39;re 12 and 9).<br/>
<br/>
Nick was content to pretend along and would have never mentioned the fact <br/>
that he knew -- but Emma, my passionate demanding child, had to have the <br/>
truth out there.  She was fine with it.  She was amused by all that I&#39;d gone <br/>
through to create and sustain the myth.  And I still believe ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It was a good thing.  For us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174824435"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In our home now, we have &quot;mom and dad&quot; gifts and &quot;Santa&quot; gifts.  Gifts do<br/>
  &gt;not go under the tree until Christmas Eve.  We celebrate St. Nicholas day on<br/>
  &gt;December 6th(a family/german tradition).  We talk quite a bit about the<br/>
  &gt;spirit of christmas, the spirit of the Santa figure etc, but Dana has yet to<br/>
  &gt;dive full and ask questions.  I told her that the tooth fairy wasn&#39;t real<br/>
  &gt;and she said, &quot;Mom, you just don&#39;t know about fairies and wishes&quot;.  So, I<br/>
  &gt;dropped it - we will cross the Santa/Easter/Fairy bridge when we come to it<br/>
  &gt;next time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  This is how it is at our house, too, except for the St. Nicholas day, although we are part german! Santa gives way more gifts than mom and dad.<br/>
  The tooth fairy is a regular, too, except some nights she is forgetfull and the poor kids have to try again the next night! The second try always works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733883135">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Something I&#39;ve been wondering.<br/>
How does Santa fit in with unschooling?<br/>
How many here have kids who believe in Santa?<br/>
What age, if any, should this belief stop?<br/>
<br/>
My kids do believe in Santa. They are 8 & 10.<br/>
I am beginning to squirm. I would love to hear how<br/>
other&#39;s have handled this, and still managed to<br/>
maintain some dignity for their kids. I&#39;m beginning to<br/>
wonder if we have handled this the wrong way.<br/>
My thinking has changed a lot since we&#39;ve started<br/>
unschooling, including my thoughts about Santa.<br/>
<br/>
Karin&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Karin,<br/>
Tamzin (age 7) was told this year (by friends that<br/>
have never believed in Santa) that there&#39;s no Santa.<br/>
She then came to me and asked me directly if there is<br/>
a Santa Claus. I told her the truth as I see it. I<br/>
told her that there was no Santa in the way that he<br/>
comes down the chimney, but that to me he will always<br/>
exist in spirit. I told her that for me Santa is the<br/>
spirit of giving. This happened about 6 months ago. A<br/>
few weeks ago, Tamzin informed me that she thinks that<br/>
there IS a Santa (as in a real man in a red suit) and<br/>
that&#39;s that. So Santa will still be leaving presents<br/>
for her this year. And life goes on. She will give up<br/>
the literal belief in Santa when she&#39;s ready, at her<br/>
own speed, just as we approach the rest of her<br/>
&#39;education&#39;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849769913">My boys have also been told by friends that there is no Santa. They simply do not believe it.<br/>
They have not come right out and specifically asked the question to me.<br/>
I imagine when/if they do, I will say something like you said below.<br/>
I like the way you put it. You are not really saying &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. It is more open-ended.<br/>
<br/>
And this sentence, I believe, is where Santa and unschooling fit together:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26290087">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hey, the tooth fairy&#39;s big here too! She leaves<br/>
beautiful coins (foreign coins or silver or gold<br/>
dollars) and fairy dust (glitter) everywhere!<br/>
The Easter bunny leaves bunny turds<br/>
(mini-marshmallows) and bunny dust <br/>
(xxxsugar) all over the house.  (I vacuum a lot)<br/>
And you ought to see what kind of havoc those<br/>
leprechauns can create! Green EVERYwhere!<br/>
<br/>
We LOVE fantasy creatures! There&#39;s a lot of fantastic<br/>
stuff that happens everyday; we just really go crazy<br/>
on a holiday. I can&#39;t speak for Duncan (5), <br/>
but Cameron has always loved the idea of Santa. And he<br/>
said that he had no problem with finding out---and<br/>
over the years, he&#39;s thought of several <br/>
new &quot;tricks&quot; for the leprechauns and those slippery<br/>
elves that show up every year as we trim the tree!<br/>
<br/>
Long live Santa!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow! The holidays at your house sound fun! I would<br/>
like to implement some of those ideas around here. I<br/>
especially like the fairy dust and leprechaun ideas.<br/>
Tamzin will love the &#39;bunny turd&#39; thing! What do the<br/>
elves get up to?<br/>

during the night (a divided circle in the garden made of marigold seeds with <br/>
tomato seeds, pepper seeds, basil, & onions.) He was so excited about that <br/>
Easter present---and that the bunny did it all that night. <br/>
<br/>
The leprechauns are really bad. There&#39;s green everywhere---all the windows <br/>
are painted green (tempera with liquid soap). The mirrors have Irish sayings <br/>

paint his finger and toe nails with green nail polish one time and spray his <br/>
hair with green spray---heavy sleeper! The white parts on the dogs are dyed <br/>
green. They overturn trash cans, move furniture around, and of course leave <br/>
chocolate coins and gold hershey bars everywhere. We always have Lucky Charms <br/>
for breakfast and corned beef & cabbage for supper.<br/>

the grandfather clock in the hall, and my husband chases him through the <br/>
front yard with kids in tow. They&#39;ve &quot;seen&quot; him and can even describe what he <br/>
wore. (Ben grabbed his hat one time!) They always leave chocolate candy in <br/>
special containers in different places (while the boys are in the yard and <br/>
running down the street) and maybe a note saying how kind the boys are. They <br/>
come back sometimes during the holidays and move presents and decorations <br/>
around and leave candy here and there.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sometimes we &#39;stay&#39; in a place for a week or two (boy, can that get confusing - to the rest of the world!). We really go for it and make the money, food (or an edible version thereof), clothing (Once I walked around for a week with my clothes on backwards! I&#39;m sure people thought I was &#39;unbalanced&#39;), decorate the house, and what ever else we can think of. It&#39;s so much fun. I highly recommend it! You could get the wand thing in there by waving it and reciting a *spell* before you go somewhere. It might help to make it more magical to do some of the prep work before you *go*. Have fun!<br/>

The book is better than the video. As usual! Tamzin<br/>
watched the BFG when she was 6 & 1/2, I don&#39;t think<br/>
she would have been ready for it before then (she has<br/>
a low fear threshold - takes after me &lt;g&gt;). <br/>
Why does there usually have to be a bad guy (or scary<br/>
part) in a lot of kids videos? We watched the cartoon<br/>
version of The Secret Garden last week and Mrs Medlock<br/>
was out to KILL Colin and take over Mistlethwaite<br/>
Manor! Talk about twisting the story!<br/>
