<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443855856">...sort of.<br/>
<br/>
Each morning I dose my elderly cat with a half-dropper-full of ginko. <br/>
The vet thinks he may be slightly senile (he walks around HOWLING with a <br/>
furry toy in his mouth) and she thinks this might help.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I squirted in the liquid as usual and he got a VERY <br/>
surprised  look on his face and immediately started foaming at the <br/>
mouth, walking around the kitchen dragging (don&#39;t read if you&#39;re eating) <br/>
long, slimy strands of white froth along the ground behind him. I looked <br/>
down at the bottle in my hand and it read...&quot;echinacea&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
This is a &quot;lighter note&quot; because he quickly recovered. I spent about an <br/>
hour on Google typing in &quot;overdose herb cat&quot; and &quot;echinacea dosage cat&quot; <br/>
and before I could find anything he was on my lap purring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823161163">I have a geriatric cat.  He howls in the middle of the night and tries to<br/>
crawl inside the pictures on the wall.  <br/>
Poor old geezer, we love him.  So far we haven&#39;t resorted to cat torture<br/>
though.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope yours has forgotten the whole affair.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
