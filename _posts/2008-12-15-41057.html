<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995473830">I saw this in our local paper and thought it was very interesting:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s an article about several college campuses where students are <br/>
forming large groups for playing a &quot;Zombies vs. Humans&quot; game, using <br/>
foam dart guns.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the students are for the game and those who play feel part of <br/>
a team or family, of course. But as usual, there&#39;s also criticism from <br/>
those who deem it as dangerous or inappropriate. I thought this part <br/>
near the end was pretty telling:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ultimately, there&#39;s something poignant about Humans vs. Zombies. When <br/>
asked to explain the appeal of the game, players talk about the <br/>
friends they&#39;ve made. The game bridges divides between men and women, <br/>
seniors and freshmen, computer scientists and poets.<br/>
<br/>
And on a campus where students refer to each other as &quot;kids,&quot; Humans <br/>
vs. Zombies is a chance to bring back a childhood that some never even <br/>
got to experience. Growing up with structured activities, safe <br/>
playgrounds and schools that ban dodgeball, they didn&#39;t get the primal <br/>
appeal of the chase out of their system.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My mom didn&#39;t let (toy) guns in the house, and I didn&#39;t get TV till I <br/>
was 18,&quot; Modine said. &quot;This is just me catching up.&quot; &quot;<br/>

<br/>
If my kids went to college, they would already have gotten to play  <br/>
games like that.  Kirby ran two &quot;killer&quot; games that involved the  <br/>
whole town (with some rules about people being on the clock at work  <br/>
or in classes), and I &quot;car-bombed&quot; the assistant DA (with box tape  <br/>
and a note on the edge of his car door), and I was felled by a star  <br/>
trek phaser (one of those that shoots little discs) in a store.  Our  <br/>
house was &quot;burned down&quot; by crepe paper streamers (photos are here)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042756509">Speaking of large-scale games,<br/>
<br/>
If you want to have lots of (wet) fun at a national level, go to <br/>
Ecuador during the &quot;carnival&quot; in late January/early February where <br/>
they have a national-scale water fight. Anyone, anywhere (except for <br/>
in the city of Ambato) is fair-game. It&#39;s not just water balloons <br/>
that go flying, there is flower, toothpaste and a lot more...so <br/>
beware! I as there as an exchange student and never had so much fun in my life!<br/>
<br/>
Beware if travelling to Cuenca though...foreigners score &quot;high <br/>
points&quot;...hit an Ecuadorian male..1 point Ecuadorian female...2 <br/>
points  gringo...10 points.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is super cool! I want to do that when my kids get older! The <br/>
neighbor kids, who are a few years older than all mine, have had <br/>
friends over in the summer and they&#39;ll run between their yard and the <br/>
neighbor&#39;s yard between our houses, and then through out yard on to <br/>
the playground, with those large squirt guns in their arms. We&#39;ll <br/>
catch one of them sneaking through the woods waiting for the others, <br/>
or they&#39;ll ask us if we&#39;ve seen their comrades, and I often wish I <br/>
could join in. Thanks for the story and link!<br/>
