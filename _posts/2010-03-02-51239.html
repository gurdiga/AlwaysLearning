<div id="ygrps-yiv-953909237">Someone from this list chose to criticize the common practice of  <br/>
providing links to pages (on this list, it seemed, and on the other  <br/>
list, though it was more rare there).<br/>
<br/>
In case any others very new to unschooling wonder why people tend to  <br/>
provide links instead of lengthy explanations, it&#39;s because the same  <br/>
questions are asked year after year after year, and some of us have  <br/>
been answering those same questions for five or ten or fifteen years.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to refer someone to a collection of the best of former  <br/>
discussions than to write 300 words every time someone asks &quot;but what  <br/>
if they watch TV instead of reading books?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
That&#39;s what.<br/>
All kinds of cool things.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone offended by me or Joyce or ANYone here providing a link to  <br/>
something that was already collected up from other discussions of the  <br/>
same year-after-year topics should reconsider staying on this list.   <br/>
There WILL be links.  That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
