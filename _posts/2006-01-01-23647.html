<div id="ygrps-yiv-996850668">&quot;A friend of mine had a birthday party for her son this weekend and I <br/>
was shocked<br/>
to find out that she had rented one of those big blow up bouncy <br/>
castles. (Her<br/>
son turned five.) I can&#39;t help feeling that it is so unnecessary to <br/>
spend so<br/>
much money on a child&#39;s birthday party.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Apparently they can afford it...GREAT!! She was making her child&#39;s day <br/>
special and fun, what is wrong with that? I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s <br/>
commercializing anything. <br/>
Maybe examine why you think it&#39;s bad to spend lots of money on your <br/>
child. Examine why you&#39;re reacting to something joyful and lovely, <br/>
given in love.<br/>
If your child wanted a party like that and you could afford it, would <br/>
you say &#39;no&#39;? Why?<br/>

(and I!) remember that VERY fondly.  We all had a great time with it <br/>
and maybe we&#39;ll do it again sometime if we have some extra money.  <br/>
Those great memories are worth it.  If we hadn&#39;t rented the bouncy <br/>
castle, I&#39;m sure we would have found things to do that weekend, but <br/>
they may not have been memorable things.<br/>

Anyone know of a copy? Can I borrow it?<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re asking in the wrong place.<br/>
<br/>
Go to  North Carolina list and ask them.  An unschooling list  <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t be the best place to ask, either.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously...  I&#39;ve aid straight out and have hinted.  This list is  <br/>
not a place for local discussion or for discussion of technicalities  <br/>
of laws.  Really.  Honest.   I&#39;d rather it be quiet than to veer away  <br/>
from natural learning toward laws and local stuff.  There are other  <br/>
places to get that information.<br/>
