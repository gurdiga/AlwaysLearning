<br/>
When Dana was 2ish, she used to talk about her life before she &quot;picked&quot; us<br/>
to be her family.  And she always made sure to hold my hand in parking lots<br/>
because she didn&#39;t want me to be hit by a car again( I had NEVER been hit by<br/>
a car in a parking lot).  She would go into incredible detail on the<br/>
incident and I didn&#39;t know if she was psychic or lived through that before -<br/>
but I made SURE I held her hand.  Dana doesn&#39;t remember those stories<br/>
anymore.  It is sad for me, that she has forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
When my niece was the same age, she would say &quot;when I was a boy&quot; and tell us<br/>
lovely stories.<br/>

&gt; imagination, or if whe was recalling a past life, or (I hope not) seeing<br/>
&gt; into the future (we now live where there aren&#39;t many trees and it&#39;s white<br/>
&gt; for 6 months out of the year.) No matter what, it was an odd conversation<br/>
