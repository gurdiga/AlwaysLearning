I saw a few things on that chart I didn&#39;t know, and even more I <br/>
don&#39;t believe.<br/>
Our lemonade isn&#39;t the same as English lemonade at ALL.<br/>
And I know what popovers are, and I&#39;ve had Yorkshire pudding in <br/>
Yorkshire, and they&#39;re not even nearly related.<br/>

Re popovers: are you thinking of pastry triangles with fruit <br/>
filling? My husband calls those popovers, but I call them turnovers. <br/>
A popover, to me, is pretty much like Yorkshire pudding--a not-sweet <br/>
batter baked in muffin tins (though I know Yorkshire pudding is <br/>
sometimes baked in a roasting pan with meat).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the English have something they call &quot;still lemonade&quot; <br/>
or &quot;old fashioned lemonade&quot;, which is like ours. Otherwise <br/>
British &quot;lemonade&quot; is fizzy, which I&#39;m sure you know.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t explain at all why they think we don&#39;t have spinach, though!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, you&#39;re right.  I was thinking of turnovers.  So I had no idea  <br/>
of popovers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
*Never mind.*<br/>
