<div id="ygrps-yiv-811918054">Okay, not TOO ancient--Was it only 1997 that AOL&#39;s homeschooling area was <br/>
still lively and good?  I&#39;m so glad I found this, though!  (Of course it&#39;s <br/>
not what I was looking for either, when I found it...)<br/>
<br/>
The first quote was from me (I didn&#39;t save my post) and the rest is NOT me.<br/>
I thought it would be amusing and maybe useful here.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I&#39;m working on (goofing around with) the possibility of a &quot;test&quot; to give <br/>
people (a checklist, or list of questions, or something) so that they can <br/>
start to figure out what they have that they can use to unschool, or whether <br/>
the whole thing is too foreign and odious to them (and if the latter, why).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You guys want to contribute to it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t resist.  For the math portion of the quiz: &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
1.  Estimate the number of cleaning products in your home (x).  Compare to <br/>
the number of books (y).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Estimate the number of times per week you say: &quot;Don&#39;t touch.&quot;  (a).<br/>
<br/>
3.  Do a probability analysis of the likelihood that you will be playing <br/>
outside on any given day. Label the result (z). <br/>
<br/>
4.  Chart the number of pairs of comfortable shoes you own (b).  Compare to <br/>
the number of umbrellas (c).<br/>
<br/>
5.  If you were a geometric figure, which would you be?  Write a brief essay <br/>
explaining why.<br/>
<br/>
Scoring:<br/>
1.  If x&gt;y, deduct one point.  If x&lt;y, add one point.<br/>
2.  If a&gt;5, deduct one point. If a&lt;5, add one point.  If a&lt;0, add two points.<br/>
3.  If z&gt;2:4, add one point. If z&lt;2:4, deduct one point.<br/>
4.  If b&gt;c, add one point.  If b&lt;c, deduct one point.<br/>
5.  Add one point for each dimension included in your figure beyond 2. Add <br/>
two points for each dimension beyond 4.  Essays will be graded at a later <br/>
date and returned to you.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your attention and good luck with your homeschooling decision.<br/>
<br/>
Maura<br/>

<br/>
Sandra, I think that a test is sure to make a lot of people mad.  Maybe a <br/>
list of personal attributes would be more helpful.  Something like...<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents tend to have:<br/>
<br/>
1.)  A stronge sense of curiousity<br/>
<br/>
2.)  A love of life<br/>
<br/>
3.)  A love of learning that supercedes their love of order<br/>
<br/>
4.)  A high tolerance for noise<br/>
<br/>
5.)  Access to lots of children&#39;s books and resources...etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the &#39;right&#39; answer for leaving the house is.  If we&#39;re <br/>
going to the park, I need to pack diapers, wipes, extra clothes for my <br/>
potty-training daycare kiddo, sunscreen, sunhat, water, cups, snacks, <br/>
blanket, toys for the baby...so it takes me quite a while.  Also, whenever we <br/>
leave the house I wear makeup (3 minutes, tops) and my kids have their long <br/>
hair brushed and pulled back, and their faces and hands clean.  But at the <br/>
park I don&#39;t tell my kids what to play or bore them with lectures on botany, <br/>
so I guess we&#39;re still unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think you have to be contantly on the go in order to unschool, and <br/>
I think you can unschool and still be clean and neat.  (But nobody would get <br/>
that idea from looking at my house.  &lt;g&gt;)  I have a fairly low tolerance for <br/>
noise so either I stay away from the area where my kids are being noisy or <br/>
they go to another area.  (That&#39;s why God created basements and back yards.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, a few things I would add are <br/>
<br/>
6.)  Ability to withstand criticism from friends and relatives.  <br/>
<br/>
7.)  Ability to trust children&#39;s innate capacity for natural learning.  <br/>
<br/>
8.)  A loving, non-adversarial relationship with their children.  <br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;What other kinds of factors should I be considering? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget my personal favorite. A sense of humor.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure how to put this as a &quot;test&quot; question, but I think one factor <br/>
might have to do with how naturally interactive a person is. That is, Sandra <br/>
frequently describes the way she uses whatever&#39;s on the radio or TV or a <br/>
billboard or whatever in talking to her kids, throwing out interesting <br/>
historical tidbits all the time, for example. I&#39;m guessing that Sandra sees <br/>
and thinks and talks, involving her kids in her own thought processes, <br/>
without conciously trying to. I think that must make it easier to unschool <br/>
for her than it is for me, a natural introvert, because my thinking and <br/>
talking are all more deliberate. I don&#39;t speak off the top of my head, <br/>
typically; I see and think and think some more, and it may not occur to me to <br/>
tell the kids what I&#39;m seeing and how I&#39;m thinking about it. Doesn&#39;t mean I <br/>
can&#39;t unschool (I am!), but it may mean I need to be more deliberate about <br/>
it. Does this make any sense?<br/>

<br/>
Kathrn did a good job taking the picture, and thanks for putting it up, Joyce!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re both wearing Albuquerque sweatshirts.  That&#39;s so sweet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The lamp behind me there is hanging over the entryway.  The door&#39;s straight <br/>
behind me, down half a flight of stairs.  The front door opens onto stairs.  <br/>
You see the kitchen floor as you come into the house.  Not perfect, but home!<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s the new Risk game Keith got for Christmas, which has the new <br/>
version of Earth, and the moon on a separate little game board.  And the <br/>
Apples to Apples game we&#39;re so fond of this season.<br/>
<br/>
I like getting to meet people I&#39;ve met online even when they live really far <br/>
away, but I don&#39;t like that then they go far away again and I might never see <br/>
them again.<br/>
<br/>
But... I get to see Joyce in South Carolina before the years&#39; over.<br/>

I looked at them last night.  The graveyard is at San Ysidro Church in <br/>
Corrales, a little farm community north of Albuquerque. The church has been <br/>
retired/desanctified, but the cemetary is still being used.<br/>
<br/>
Near the end is a photo of my house, my van, my mailbox.  My office and <br/>
archive (junk room) is the window upstairs and to the right of the front <br/>
door, to the right of the vine (I see it IF I ever look up from the <br/>
computer).   [Oh!  Joyce said that in her captions.]   So from here I see the <br/>
big juniper tree, the mostly-dead honey-locust or whatever it is (gets red <br/>
and black bugs in summer), and beyond those the Sandia Mountains.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819121573">Love the pictures of New Mexico.  I am feeling rather homesick these<br/>
days.  The cactus in the graves is interesting--keeps people from<br/>
robbing the grave I bet, or animals frm digging it up.  Luminarios are<br/>
also interesting, aren&#39;t they to light the way for Baby Jesus?  To show<br/>
there is room for Mary and Joseph and the baby at that house? So having<br/>
them on the grave is a bit strange.<br/>
<br/>
My dad just sent me a bunch of slides for a presentation I&#39;m doing in a<br/>
few weeks on the anasazi, at this homeschool camp (maybe slow camp).  I<br/>
could get $20 off the price of the camp if I did something, planned an<br/>
activity or something, so I said I would give a presentation, and picked<br/>
the anasazi as my subject.  The pictures are beautiful, like yours, and<br/>
makeme homesick.  Except the picture of the pit.  That made me laugh!<br/>
And the space ship house, I used to live right by there and drove by it<br/>
on the way to UNM.  Lexie got a kick out of it, I&#39;ll have to show it to<br/>
her next time we are in Alb.<br/>
<br/>
I did love the pictures, thank you so much for sharing!<br/>

I helped fill them one year.  It was a *LOT* of work.  <br/>

So there was the symbolism of leading people to church, but I never heard the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666507622">&lt;&lt;Oooo I HATE HATE HATE the patriot act&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I figure I&#39;ll help them work the bugs out of their system.    After the<br/>
Enron debacle (makes me want to puke) and the big oil company that just<br/>
bought dh&#39;s company threatening the employees who don&#39;t contribute to United<br/>
Way and the political action committee, I was telling dh that the time is<br/>
ripe for a good coup.<br/>
<br/>
I was joking (ok half joking) but the fact that Che Guevara is one of my all<br/>
time heroes has dh a little worried.  We also live in the birth place of<br/>
The Republic of Texas group.  A couple of their members decided to take on<br/>
the government a few years ago and took a family hostage.  The secretary of<br/>
the group, not involved in the hostage situation, is still in prison because<br/>
she refused to give the government their membership list.  Guilt by<br/>
association, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I was researching a paper on guerrilla warfare (military strategy is an<br/>
interest of mine) a few years ago and was emailing some interesting sorts<br/>
down in Mexico and South America.  For the first time ever, my passport made<br/>
little blips on the screen when I entered the country.<br/>
<br/>
I figure Big Brother has been watching and listening in to the internet<br/>
since its inception.  They just don&#39;t use the information in court.<br/>
<br/>
There, I have &quot;political action&quot;, &quot;coup&quot;, &quot;Che Guevara&quot;, &quot;Republic of<br/>
Texas&quot;, &quot;hostage&quot; all in one email.....that ought to brighten some suit&#39;s<br/>
day.<br/>
