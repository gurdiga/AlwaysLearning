 </span></blockquote>I have been thinking about this alot lately too... I always figured my 3 biggest problems were that 1. I cant remember the rules! 2. I am so inconsistant when it comes to all of them  3. I want to be a Mom, not a COP. My mom comes and visits and comments all the time that I just need to make this a rule or that a rule.  I am always trying to explain to her that if I cant remember all the rules how are my kids going to.  I am trying hard to wrap my brain around principles... I can remember them.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the kids that live near us, said rather astonished, &quot;you don&#39;t<br/>
have any rules do you?&quot;  I looked at him and said, &quot;yes we do, they are,<br/>
play nicely and behave kindly.&quot;  He didn&#39;t think those were rules, and<br/>
they aren&#39;t really, but that&#39;s where it all seems to come down to.  A<br/>
rule of no hitting, could be summed up nicley with &quot;be nice&quot;, because<br/>
clearly hitting isn&#39;t nice.  Being nice, covers it all.<br/>
<br/>
A kid could easily not break the rule of &quot;no hitting&quot;, by pinching or<br/>
kicking, and completely get away with it, and feel pretty darn good<br/>
about getting away with being mean without getting in trouble.  If the<br/>
idea is to &quot;be nice&quot;, pinching or kicking won&#39;t work.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078340820">I went to add Jenny&#39;s quote to the principles page, which I did.  I  <br/>
also added it to the Jenny Cyphers page.  But on the principles page I  <br/>
found this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Living from principles, rather than fears, is the easiest way to  <br/>
grok unschooling, as far as I can tell. (But maybe it isn&#39;t easy,  <br/>
because it took me a long time to figure that out for myself, haha. I  <br/>
was all, &#39;what is all this rules vs. principles stuff anyway?&#39; Now, in  <br/>
my unschooling, it seems like the most important part.)&quot;<br/>
