Well then why don&#39;t we just quit giving advice and send all the kids to <br/>
school?<br/>
Why don&#39;t we tell people that spank to just &quot;do what works best for them&quot;.<br/>
Doing what works best for whom? The adults or the children?<br/>
I think the kids would have a different view on this. And I think their view <br/>
is just as important as yours.<br/>

Perhaps more.  I&#39;ll be dead before the views of my children have stopped <br/>
influencing the world.  That&#39;s the good news and the bad news.  If I screw <br/>
them  up, the world has three times as much screw-up as when it was just me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why don&#39;t we tell people that spank to just &quot;do what works best for them&quot;.<br/>
Doing what works best for whom? The adults or the children?-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the biggest question.<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo didn&#39;t shake the poor mom loose who was determined to limit the video <br/>
games and determined to get away from here.   She saw some more posts (maybe <br/>
still seeing some) and wasn&#39;t happy.<br/>
<br/>
So I woke up this morning, thinking, and thought that if ANY mother went away <br/>
from this list &quot;happy&quot; and determined to keep controlling her children&#39;s time <br/>
and thoughts, I would feel like a failure.  <br/>
<br/>
On a list I don&#39;t own, I have to scoot over and sit next to things I think <br/>
are wrong.  Here I don&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I agree with you, Ren, I think that sentence you quoted is quite handy <br/>
when dealing face to face with hot button issues like breastfeeding and <br/>
spanking, etc.  I know it&#39;s saved my behind and the atmosphere in the room <br/>
over and over again.  whew.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, and this is more important than just a BTW, but I&#39;m reminded.  If anyone <br/>
here practices Attachment Parenting, that organization lost a very important <br/>
member this week.  Christie Watts Kelly, who wrote 6 books and collaborated <br/>
with Dr. Sears on some of those, was killed in a car accident near her home <br/>
in Memphis this week.  She was pregnant with her third child, who was removed <br/>
from her body at 26 weeks gestation.  Baby Ian is in critical, non-stable <br/>
condition.  She leaves behind her husband and two young children.  The AP <br/>
community here is rallying to see what they can do to help Ian and the family <br/>
survive.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of her books you might recognize were Baby On The Way, and What Baby <br/>
Needs.  She also founded the Memphis chapter of Attachment Parenting, Int&#39;l., <br/>
taught yoga, and people who know her said she was the sort of person who <br/>
glowed.  She was the kind of person the world needs more of, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>

Just thought I&#39;d pass on the sad news.<br/>
