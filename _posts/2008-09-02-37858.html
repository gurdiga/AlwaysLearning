&gt; Labels are a useful form of communication and a way to categorize<br/>
&gt; information.:) I just think it&#39;s harmful to label people in regards to<br/>
&gt; behavior or traits making them &quot;less than&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like being one of the crew.  And even labeling someone&#39;s behavior or<br/>
traits to make too much of them, whether it&#39;s less than or more than, can<br/>
exaggerate something about them too much one way or the other.<br/>

When Karl was a baby, he didn&#39;t mind being called a baby at all, even up to<br/>
3 or so.  Once he didn&#39;t consider himself a baby, even talking about when he<br/>
was a baby annoys him a little (sometimes a lot) if it seems to him an<br/>
exaggeration of who he is (or sometimes maybe a preference for his babyhood)<br/>
or in any way an inaccurate picture of how he sees himself now.  ;)<br/>
