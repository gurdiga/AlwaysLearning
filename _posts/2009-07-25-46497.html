<div id="ygrps-yiv-945272338">Thank you very much for that. I also do not think my son is &quot;broken&quot; and needs fixing. I love him and see him as he is. But when your child is &quot;typically&quot; developing and then one morning wakes up with no verbal skills, eye contact and is screaming for 4-6 hours at a time you feel helpless as a parent. So I took him to Childrens Hospital and he saw many specialist to find out why he lost every skill he has naturally obtained. It worried me. Then I found out almost 18 mo. later that he is diagnosed with Autism, it does help a bit. Autism is not who he is, it is a label but it does help others understand the way he responds to them. <br/>
I love my son very much and Unschooling is a wonderful thing for him. It allows him to be him, there is no telling him to be &quot;normal&quot; or to stop making sounds when he is stressed out or to stop playing with his cars in an &quot;inappropriate way&quot;.( He likes to just stare at the wheels while he rolls them very close to his face on a table). <br/>

<br/>
I do think it&#39;s important to clarify that the child about whom this  <br/>
was written isn&#39;t unschooled.  I know there are times and ways that  <br/>
it&#39;s advantageous to have a label.<br/>
<br/>
For the mom who described Asperger&#39;s in great detail, all those things  <br/>
are known and familiar to me.   We know some Asperger&#39;s kids very  <br/>
well.  My nephew has those traits.    I know all that.   Many people  <br/>
do.   Few of those people know unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 From the point of view of unschooling, no matter what or how a child  <br/>
learns or is, if the parent helps him where is is, in a way that he&#39;ll  <br/>
understand in that moment, and lets him make choices about what to do  <br/>
and whether to stop or continue, and how to go about doing it, will  <br/>
find the child learning.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is what unschooling is about.<br/>
<br/>
Today I&#39;m still at the London Unschooling conference.  A couple talked  <br/>
to me for a long time, and a mom sat and talked afterwards, and both  <br/>
about having Asperger&#39;s Syndrome kids.   Here are some of the things I  <br/>
told them:<br/>
<br/>
Rather than comparing him to the other kids in their home ed groups,  <br/>
remember to compare him to the way he might have been had he been in  <br/>
school.<br/>
Keep him safe and as sheltered as he wants, and when he&#39;s eighteen  <br/>
he&#39;ll care in different ways and the parents will be able to advise  <br/>
him about social situations in a way younger children wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
understand no matter how &quot;normal&quot; they might be, but that he might, at  <br/>
18 or so, understand and care about.   Everyday things like shaking  <br/>
hands and introducing himself.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent of a ten year old imagines that non-Asperger&#39;s kids are  <br/>
all socially suave, that&#39;s not true.  Comparing a child to an imagined  <br/>
ideal isn&#39;t great.  Comparing him to other kids isn&#39;t much better.   <br/>
Compare him to the real pain you see in other kids who have no  <br/>
choices.  Compare him to the way he might have been.<br/>
<br/>
Find the things he does like and that he&#39;s good at, no matter how  <br/>
&quot;narrow,&quot; and learn to see all the connections and history and  <br/>
geography and art and music that can connect to that, one way or  <br/>
another.  Let him grow in his own way and at his own speed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31376480">I couldn&#39;t agree with Sandra more:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Find the things he does like and that he&#39;s good at, no matter how <br/>
&quot;narrow,&quot; and learn to see all the connections and history and <br/>
geography and art and music that can connect to that, one way or <br/>
another. Let him grow in his own way and at his own speed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I share that with parents who come to me for advice about AS - love<br/>
them, accept them, help them to do what they love and help them to build<br/>
the connections.  And then I advise them to the same for all their<br/>
children and for all the people in their lives - help the people you<br/>
care about do what they are good at!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If all the doctors, specialists, therapists, nutritionists, etc. had<br/>
said this to me each time when we came to work them - it would have made<br/>
such a difference in our lives!  For many years we taught to compensate<br/>
for Dave&#39;s weaknesses.  He obsessively read books - we were &quot;in trouble&quot;<br/>
all the time at traditional school.  They tortured him for not being<br/>
able to hold a pencil and creating art projects on demand (haven&#39;t<br/>
computers made a joke about learning cursive and you should see him whip<br/>
out a power point presentation!).  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Around 9 or 10 he started to be able to recognize if he had food on his<br/>
face after eating, he began to looked into our faces (I wept the first<br/>
time he looked deeply into my eyes - I had no idea his eyes were such a<br/>
beautiful color of green), he could recognize teachers and classmates<br/>
when they were at the grocery store (but wouldn&#39;t know their names), he<br/>
could ask for help in a library, he stopped melting away to be found<br/>
after much searching under a picnic table, in a quiet corner of a<br/>
community center behind the bean bag chairs, in between racks of<br/>
clothing in stores...  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Once we had some basic life skills were mastered we let him direct his<br/>
learning.  He&#39;s been &quot;traditional school free&quot; since after two months of<br/>
sixth grade he was too stressed out to return.  He&#39;s worked with tutors<br/>
in areas that interested him in math, science and history.  Now that he<br/>
is 16, he&#39;s been taking 6-8 units of college classes on line for the<br/>
last two years.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As we travel across America I make it mandatory that both teens join us<br/>
at the art, science and history museums - but once they see the film or<br/>
hear the orientation talk, they are free to roam.   They must attend the<br/>
tours offered by the rangers at the national parks and participate in<br/>
local activities like fish boils, polka festivals, ferry riding,<br/>
sledding in the snow or the white sands, farmers markets etc.  Dave is<br/>
required to do household activities - he hooks up the tow car, cleans<br/>
the tile floors (he hates to vacuum - too loud), grocery shops and<br/>
washing the family laundry which his sister folds and puts away.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I meet people who don&#39;t think that studying the Oregon Trail by<br/>
following it as meaningful as reading about it in a book.  These same<br/>
types of people think that spending two days at Abraham Lincoln&#39;s<br/>
library isn&#39;t much of a learning experience if there isn&#39;t a test at the<br/>
end.  I wonder if they&#39;d consider experiencing a blizzard,<br/>
sleet/snow/black ice, torrential rains, flooding, tornados, a part of a<br/>
science curriculum?  Dave decides what he wants to learn in the places<br/>
we are at traveling too.  Both kids read the travel books and help us<br/>
decide where to &quot;adventure&quot; to next.  But when we are there, I insist<br/>
that we live fully - do corn mazes, tour Nasa, hike Canyon de Chelly,<br/>
visit Thomas Edison&#39;s birthplace, visit mineral pools. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I always laugh about who is an unschooler.  The rest of the world views<br/>
that Dave doesn&#39;t &quot;do school.&quot;  I am not able to teach trigonometry at a<br/>
college level and the five unit chemistry class we took together at the<br/>
local college was extremely humbling for me - fortunately Dave was there<br/>
to help tutor me.  He has spent the summer volunteering 40 hours a week<br/>
doing office work at the local science museum and now he&#39;s a camp<br/>
counselor for K-2 for five weeks.  He&#39;s chosen his crazy schedule and<br/>
the areas he wants to volunteer.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My unschooler friends question my &quot;If we are in Oklahoma - we must go to<br/>
the Will Roger&#39;s museum, visit the hour races and tour Cowboy Museum&quot;<br/>
mentality.  I don&#39;t keep a portfolio, give tests or keep track of<br/>
accomplishments besides the family blog.   I&#39;m teaching at the HSC and<br/>
SHEA conferences in a couple weeks.  If I were going to describe what<br/>
type of learning I do with Dave - what would I say?  I guess we are not<br/>
unschoolers.  So what are we?<br/>

<br/>
I never do.<br/>
I spend a GREAT deal of my time and energy helping people unschool.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun having you visit, Mary Ann, and I had a great time hanging  <br/>
out with you, but you told me then and have said since (in writing,  <br/>
but not here) that you weren&#39;t really unschooling, that you just  <br/>
lately started unschooling your daughter after some years.   You told  <br/>
me you were requiring schoolwork.  Now you&#39;re saying you require field  <br/>
trip (in whatever other terms you want to put it).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a crime and it&#39;s surely more fun than school, if the kids  <br/>
want it and like it more than they would like school.<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of this list, though, it&#39;s helpful for the readers  <br/>
(and there are very many of them) to know whether the person whose  <br/>
ideas they&#39;re reading really understands and practices unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Eclectic homeschoolers, maybe.  Relaxed homeschoolers.  Depending how  <br/>
Sarah&#39;s unschooling is unfolding.<br/>
<br/>
For this list to be as helpful as it can be, clarity is better than  <br/>
vagueness.  Vague is okay for some things, but for a clear picture of  <br/>
unschooling, not so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494690656">-=-I always laugh about who is an unschooler.-=-<br/>
I never do. I spend a GREAT deal of my time and energy helping people<br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m one of those people you&#39;ve helped!   You are accurate in how I used<br/>
to view our educational style.  I used to think we weren&#39;t<br/>
unschoolers..., in large part because I thought we&#39;d want to &quot;go back&quot;<br/>
when the trip was over.  Then as we&#39;ve done more homeschooling<br/>
conferences, it&#39;s obvious to me to I sit more in the unschooler crowd<br/>
and agree with the philosophies.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But since  I still teach in some of the areas know more than the kids -<br/>
this morning was about fish tank maintenance and yesterday was about<br/>
catering for 40 - which is not unschooling because I require them to<br/>
participate.  I do make field trips and volunteering activities<br/>
mandatory....  There is a list on the fridge with household<br/>
responsibilities.  I&#39;ve tried to &quot;set free,&quot; but I&#39;ve still got further<br/>
to go.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now that we are back to &quot;living traditionally&quot; for another year, I&#39;ll<br/>
use the term eclectic homeschooling for Dave and relaxed homeschooling<br/>
for Edith-Sarah.  I loved the term road-schooling, but that isn&#39;t<br/>
accurate anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Thanks! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159814289">Unlike Sandra, I don&#39;t know Mary Ann (as far as I know), but I think there <br/>
are enough clues described in her schooling practices for me to agree with <br/>
her own assessment that she is not an unschooler. I would have thought <br/>
Eclectic homeschooler, if you need a helpful label. It takes more than <br/>
eschewing testing to be an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Having requirements about following or participating in whatever programs at <br/>
museums, even insisting on attendance, are some of the factors that take it <br/>
out of being unschooling. I guess I&#39;d be curious to know what happens when <br/>
one or other of the kids says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However this is the idea I want to notice, as an example of a barrier to <br/>
unschooling:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Once we had some basic life skills were mastered we let him direct his<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; learning. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have requirements, he isn&#39;t the director. But that&#39;s an aside.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the specific of Dave was that he had extra challenges. <br/>
However the broader principle is that all kids, all people, will have the <br/>
need to master basic life skills. There may be some debate over the fine <br/>
details of what is a &quot;basic life skill&quot;, but in general everyone has areas <br/>
to be mastered in order to live happily and comfortably in a community, <br/>
including a famly.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;mastered&quot; is too great a word too. Some of us are spending a lifetime <br/>
improving some of our basic life skills, especially as our circumstances <br/>
change. Maybe there is a point short of mastery that is &quot;good enough&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One of the tentpoles of unschooling is that everything counts. Therefore <br/>
basic life skills count as learning. This is exactly where the whole <br/>
&quot;radical unschooler&quot; comes from - that children can be trusted to learn and <br/>
make good choices about their personal needs, daily living and life skills. <br/>
My daughter has come and is coming to competence in basic life skills in <br/>
exactly the same way as she is learning to read and do math - in her own <br/>
way, in her own order, and in her own rather erratic time - usually with <br/>
announcements about her thought processes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I have helped by making resources available, sometimes I have <br/>
hindered by unasked for advice. But at no time was her freedom to then do <br/>
the other learning and creative work (and forays into academic thinking) <br/>
tied to some timetable of having mastered some life skill or other. Frankly <br/>
I can&#39;t understand how that would work. &quot;I&#39;ll trust you to learn to read <br/>
without lessons only after you&#39;ve learnt to dress yourself, until then it&#39;s <br/>
lessons and primers&quot;....&quot;Until you&#39;ve learnt to carry your plate to the <br/>
kitchen yourself, I&#39;ll be choosing your tv shows&quot;....&quot;Oh you&#39;ve learnt to <br/>
put your dirty clothes in the hamper. Great, now you get to choose what to <br/>
study today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course I don&#39;t think Mary Ann said any of these absurd things. I don&#39;t <br/>
think any real person has said any of these things. I&#39;m deliberately <br/>
exaggerating to point out what unschoolers might see as the illogic of that <br/>
position that life skills have to be mastered first, before unschooling can <br/>
be allowed to begin; to notice the lack of clarity expressed with that idea.<br/>
<br/>
The question of  &quot;directing learning&quot; is another problematic concept for <br/>
unschooling. It implies the separation of learning activities from living <br/>
life (oh just like the learning portion of the museum visit versus the free <br/>
time to play there). It makes it all sound deliberate, a pre-planned road <br/>
map (or train track) of learning with a final &quot;learnt that&quot; goal.<br/>
<br/>
That sure isn&#39;t how learning works around here. It is much more organic - <br/>
intertwined with life, automatic, constant. The inner work has been done by <br/>
the time Jayn announces that &quot;3 and 12 make 15 because 5 and 5 and 5 make 15 <br/>
and 3 and 2 are 5 and 5 and 5 are 10, see?&quot; or some amazing polysyllabic <br/>
word pops out of her regular speech in perfect context.<br/>
<br/>
For us unschooling is about helping Jayn do what she wants to do (sometimes <br/>
working around her lack of life skills), without her having to earn the <br/>
right to do it by demonstrating her mastery of one or more life skills.<br/>

Chamille, at 15, still gets 4&#39;s and 7&#39;s mixed up.  I don&#39;t know why and<br/>
I doubt she does either.  She doesn&#39;t think in mathematical, as in<br/>
number pattern sort of ways.  She knows how to deal with money, she<br/>
understands spatial relationships, and probably many other math related<br/>
skills, but as for traditional school style math, she couldn&#39;t do it to<br/>
save her life.  I call that basic life skills, using as much math as she<br/>
needs to know at her given point in life, which right now includes money<br/>
and various spatial related elements, as well as video game stats.  That<br/>
could be the extent of it for the duration of her life and it won&#39;t<br/>
matter one iota because she will be able to get along in life with those<br/>
skills.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The question of &quot;directing learning&quot; is another problematic concept<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling. It implies the separation of learning activities from<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; life (oh just like the learning portion of the museum visit versus the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>free<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time to play there). It makes it all sound deliberate, a pre-planned<br/>
 </span></blockquote>road<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; map (or train track) of learning with a final &quot;learnt that&quot; goal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where it always comes back to for me.  How in the world do we<br/>
know that a kid who is forced to attend a learning portion of the museum<br/>
is learning exactly what is supposed to be learned from it?  We have no<br/>
way of knowing what goes on in someone else&#39;s head.  The kid could be<br/>
tuning it all out and examing the patterns on the floor tiles, and I use<br/>
that as an example because that is what I would have done as a kid.  The<br/>
kid could be thinking about the color of the sky outside and wondering<br/>
why it&#39;s blue and not yellow.  If a kid must regurtitate the info, they<br/>
may pay just enough attention to be able to do that and then push it all<br/>
out of their head afterwards, or read the museum boards, which again, is<br/>
what I would have done after examing the floor tiles.<br/>
<br/>
If given the freedom to explore the museum at my own pace and will, I<br/>
still would have examined the floor tiles and read the museum boards and<br/>
also the museum collections connected to the boards.  I would have<br/>
gotten the free pamphlets from the place and taken them with to examine<br/>
later.  In fact, this is still the kind of thing I do.  I was never much<br/>
interested in guided tours or ranger talks or any of that stuff, I<br/>
wanted to do my own thing at my own pace.  I&#39;m still this way and I give<br/>
my kids the gift of being able to do that too, or not going at all, and<br/>
I&#39;ve done that too.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t want my kids to learn, is that my way is more important<br/>
than their way, that their desire to not go and do, is less important<br/>
than my desire for them to go and do.</div>

In the past week I&#39;ve had a couple of incidents of the risk of mixing  <br/>
up 1&#39;s and 7&#39;s, because of the difference in European and American  <br/>
handwriting.  What makes a seven for them is part of what makes a four  <br/>

makes a 7 for us (the angle at the top of the vertical line).<br/>

<br/>
Me too.  And I might have chosen to attend &quot;the learning portion&quot; or  <br/>
the presentation, too!  And when I did, it was a world different from  <br/>
being &quot;made&quot; to attend it.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m reading these things I&#39;m thinking of my own family and museums  <br/>
and zoos.  If there&#39;s a bird show or a &quot;meet the animals&quot; (where you  <br/>
can hold or touch an animal), my kids would WANT to do that.  If  <br/>
there&#39;s a physics demonstration or something, they WANT to do that.   <br/>
Maybe part of the reason they want to is that I&#39;m enthusiastic about  <br/>
it myself.<br/>
<br/>
When they were little, Marty didn&#39;t like the darkness and noise of the  <br/>
IMAX or omnimax theaters, so I didn&#39;t always press even when I wanted  <br/>
to see that, but if I did really want to, I would ask Marty nicely and  <br/>
offer to let him sit in my lap or whatever would make him braver, and  <br/>
the fact that he was never forced and that he got older every single  <br/>
day made it not too long before he was willing to go anytime.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s enough information on Will Rogers online that someone  <br/>
who passed through Oklahoma and missed a particular presentation could  <br/>
catch up with it later, pretty easily.<br/>
<br/>
There will never be enough online to reclaim a day of life with one&#39;s  <br/>
child.<br/>
I know unschoolers are working on putting enough online to help  <br/>
parents repair relationships that have been damaged by control and  <br/>
pressure, but the main message of unschooling is not to create the  <br/>
damage in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably there are many on the list who know know who Will Rogers is,  <br/>
and some who don&#39;t care, and some who, having seen the link below,  <br/>
will still wonder why it would be such a big deal.  I live one state  <br/>
over, and while I appreciate Will Rogers some, it&#39;s not more than I  <br/>
appreciate Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams.   Anyone  <br/>
who doesn&#39;t know why I named those three particularly could find out  <br/>
why.  Maybe someday there will be a museum dedicated to them, after  <br/>
they&#39;re dead, and people re-enacting them.  But today they&#39;re alive,  <br/>
and so if a child stayed back from Will Rogers to watch videos of  <br/>
living speakers, they might not be &quot;behind&quot; at all.<br/>

Last year we used a maths tutor to help Emma prepare for an  exam she needed to complete to move on to where she wants to go - he pointed out to me that I had not shown her to write x in algebra as a backwards c joined to a c kind of like )(  , so it wasn&#39;t confused with a multiplication sign.  Apart from the fact that most of her maths was self taught, we all ended up far from being on the same page due to differing symbolism.  Sometimes we can assume we are working with a common code when in fact that is not the case.<br/>

<br/>
Huh.  News to me.  Probably an old system from the days of chalkboards  <br/>
and moveable type.<br/>
<br/>
Our algebra always came out of a book, and not a 19th century book,  <br/>
and so X was X, only the &quot;times&quot; x was smaller and vertically centered  <br/>
as a plus or minus or division sign was.<br/>
<br/>
And in typing it&#39;s small x, like X x 3 = 12 (once a person knows one  <br/>
is about to break into mathematical notation, I mean).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763140813">Once again, a discussion about labels.  If you, as the parent, find the<br/>
label helpful for finding information to help a child that is a lot<br/>
different than putting said label on your child--or allowing a professional<br/>
to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Within unschooling I don&#39;t see how using the label itself helps one to<br/>
unschool.  Using the label is not the same as understanding the ins and outs<br/>
of your particular situation.  Nor is using the label itself helping you<br/>
to meet the needs of your child.  These things can be done sans labels.<br/>
<br/>
This phrase within the conversation about labels reminded me of something:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If all the doctors, specialists, therapists, nutritionists, etc. had<br/>
&gt;said this to me each time when we came to work them [. . .]<br/>
<br/>

specialists, therapists, nutritionists] and many others including schools,<br/>
special education specialists, book publishers, drug companies, non-profit<br/>
agencies and governments all profit from people using labels.<br/>
<br/>
I think long and hard about who is benefiting from the use of labels before<br/>
using one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838879628">-=-Once again, a discussion about labels.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Every topic will come back up every few months.  That&#39;s how it works.   <br/>
If anyone feels the same, same topics are coming up over and over,  <br/>
you&#39;re right.   That&#39;s because people join the list every day.   <br/>
Nineteen people have joined in the past week.<br/>
<br/>
One common thing is for people not to understand the question the  <br/>
first time, and to understand it better the next time.   Another thing  <br/>
to be expected is that some people might not have any suggestions or  <br/>
stories the second or third time they see the question, but as time  <br/>
goes on they will have.<br/>
<br/>
Because the questions are asked, people are aware, when  the  <br/>
situations come up in their own lives that they can go to the archives  <br/>
of this list (and other places) to look for ideas from past discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this:<br/>
<br/>
-=- Using the label is not the same as understanding the ins and outs<br/>
of your particular situation. Nor is using the label itself helping you<br/>
to meet the needs of your child. These things can be done sans labels.- <br/>
=-<br/>
<br/>
And when people think about this, remember that none of it applies to  <br/>
unschoolers.  If the label won&#39;t help anyone else make money, then  <br/>
there&#39;s much less reason to use it or to seek out a diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Labels can be as much about the money as they are about helping.  <br/>
[Doctors,<br/>
specialists, therapists, nutritionists] and many others including  <br/>
schools,<br/>
special education specialists, book publishers, drug companies, non- <br/>
profit<br/>
agencies and governments all profit from people using labels.-=-<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst things I see done with a label, I see done *all the  <br/>
time*:   a mother wants a piece of paper that says it&#39;s not her  <br/>
fault.  That there&#39;s something wrong with her child.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re being partners with our children it&#39;s not about who&#39;s at  <br/>
fault, the mother or the child.  It&#39;s another good argument against  <br/>
labels.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857678594">This discussion has been great for my sister who joined the group a month or two ago.<br/>
She was not interested in homeschooling until her son went into 1st grade last year and it was a nightmare of trying to label him and drug him.<br/>
They pulled him out. He did not want to go anymore either. Then my sister started talking to me about homeschooling and learning all she could. She took home &quot; Moving a Puddle&quot;  to read and than about a month or two ago she joined this list. She is loving it. She is really  into this discussion she told me.<br/>
I am sure there are other lurkers like her that are getting a lot out of yet another discussion about labels.<br/>
