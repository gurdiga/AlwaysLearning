<div id="ygrps-yiv-488624713">:-) I&#39;m so happy reviving the unschooling carnival got such a good<br/>
response and that all of you want to see it happen, as I do. It&#39;s <br/>
going to be great!<br/>
<br/>
The first one will be out on July 1st. I put together a web page with<br/>
all the details. Here&#39;s the link:<br/>

<br/>
I think I covered everything on it, but if you have a question, just<br/>
holler. Being this is a new, I&#39;m kinda thinking as I go along so<br/>
please bear with me if I don&#39;t have all the details worked out <br/>
yet. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you can blog, post or add this to your website, that would be a <br/>
big help in getting the word out. I&#39;ll be posting this in several <br/>
places so I apologise if you see it more than once.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is going to be fun for all of us and I am looking <br/>
forward to reading all of your posts. :-)<br/>
