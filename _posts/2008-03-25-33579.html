<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472928790">I am wondering about the people who list their blogs in the signature <br/>
line and if they get heckler comments from people and how they deal <br/>
with it. I would like my blog to be more open and was considering using <br/>
it as a signature line but since blogging about world of warcraft I <br/>
have this person telling me how bad the game is and how worthless. I <br/>
respond back but am wondering if others get strange comments or am I <br/>
just lucky and how others have dealt with it. <br/>

Depending on the comment, I will either ignore it (delete it!!) or I will<br/>
pull out comments and create a response. Lucky me ::bg:: most of my hecklers<br/>
are &quot;anonymous&quot; family members ;)<br/>
I also use statcounter.com to see how people find my blog and where they<br/>
come from (I love the google searches that end up at my blog!)<br/>

comments before they&#39;re displayed. Then you can delete the ones you  <br/>
don&#39;t want.<br/>

<br/>
I have gotten the occasional comment from someone I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
get many comments at all and I&#39;ve yet to be heckled. Maybe someone was just  <br/>
searching for World of Warcraft to pick a fight...?<br/>
