 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve loved him for years, and my favorites were the books about The<br/>
Incredible Dr. Matrix, which I think were titled something like that, and<br/>
then there was great one that was within the past 10 years or so , and I<br/>
can&#39;t remember the title but Cacie and I had a ball with it, there was a<br/>
whole section on experiements and things with eggs, and another about<br/>
Taxicab geomtery, which is basically geometry on a grid system.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone mentioned The Man Who Counted? That was a cool book.<br/>
<br/>
We used to go to Lawrence Hall of Science when we lived near Berkeley and<br/>
play a lot of mathy games, like Hex, and Nim... I think LHS has some<br/>
books out, too. Some of their games were kinda dull, but we liked those<br/>
two.<br/>
