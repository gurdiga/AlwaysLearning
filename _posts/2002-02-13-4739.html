<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145212802">&lt;&lt;I vote for &quot;How to use google.com.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m just a few minutes behind knowing everything--I just have to figure out<br/>
what to put in the search box.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love and adore Google--I even love the name, and how the &quot;o&quot; stretches out<br/>
to make room for each new page.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I spent about two hours looking for information that I couldn&#39;t<br/>
find, though. I&#39;m writing a script for the book Pollyanna and I&#39;d like to<br/>
find out when beauty parlors started showing up in small towns (Pollyanna is<br/>
set in Vermont in 1910). I tried &quot;beauty parlors 1900&quot; and &quot;beauty shops<br/>
1900&quot; and &quot;first beauty parlors&quot; and &quot;beauty history&quot; and &quot;hairstyling<br/>
history&quot; and myriad other things. I got, once in awhile, something that<br/>
would suggest when they started, like a reference to permanent waves (which<br/>
I assume probably wouldn&#39;t be at home), but nothing definitive.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone just happen to know?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047446037">You might just try using &quot;permanent wave.&quot; I think they were invented in<br/>
the teens. I know one machine at least was invented by a black woman who<br/>
founded a whole beauty-type empire, sorry I can&#39;t remember her name. I<br/>
would guess they would be a factor in the rise of the beauty parlor because<br/>
it took hours and hours to have one done and a big ole machine they hooked<br/>
up to your head (from what I remember my grandma telling me).<br/>

Oooh!! I just read something about hair dryers and can&#39;t remember where.  <br/>
This history of hair dryers &quot;like they used in the beauty parlors,&quot; it said, <br/>
and they were first unheated,  just air.<br/>
<br/>
Did you try &quot;beautician&quot; or &quot;hair stylists&quot; too?<br/>
<br/>
There were starting to be phones then.  But there weren&#39;t phone BOOKS yet, I <br/>
don&#39;t think--you just asked the operator to connect you.  And a beauty parlor <br/>
might not have had a phone.<br/>
<br/>
Newspapers had advertising, though, and if you can find a newspaper whole....<br/>
<br/>
Or a high school annual with ads...<br/>
<br/>
Or a ninety year old woman.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s a historian, local to here, but she might know.  She <br/>
mostly knows the history of buildings in Albuquerque.  She&#39;s a <br/>
photo-archivist, not really a historian, but she works at a history  museum, <br/>
doing history. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This is an example of how people *actually* learn and remember stuff, as<br/>
opposed to the linear time-line memorization dogma; I never heard her name<br/>
until yesterday, when it was mentioned in the cartoon strip, &quot;Jump Start.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My dd and I were watching &quot;Today&quot; this morning, as they did a feature on the<br/>
Zamboni.  Did you know people can go to &quot;Zamboni camp,&quot; kind of like<br/>
baseball fantasy camp?  That each event at the Olympics requires a different<br/>
kind of ice, that there is even a difference in the ice of speed skating<br/>
sprints and long-distance races, and that the 4,000 ft. elevation makes for<br/>
better ice, since there is less oxygen in the water molecules?  Or that the<br/>
curling venue adds droplets of water to its ice sheet, in a process called<br/>
&quot;pebbling&quot;?  I added my own knowledge of Zambonis in conversation with dd,<br/>
telling her how I learned the word from &quot;Peanuts,&quot; and how Charles Schultz<br/>
owned an ice rink and drove his own Zamboni.<br/>

Learning is uncircumscribed.  Or, &quot;Everything is Educational.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391409710">I know where I read about the hair dryer!<br/>
<br/>
On the CD of David MacCaulay&#39;s &quot;The Way Things Work,&quot; which I bought <br/>
at the flea market, which Holly put in the other day and walked away <br/>
from.  I came in and was clicking pictures (mostly the musical <br/>
instruments/physics stuff) but something was talking about tools.  It <br/>
was on a timeline, the hair dryer stuff!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just got back from a theater meeting and we decided not to have a beauty<br/>
parlor after all, so don&#39;t hurry to find out anything on my account. I&#39;m<br/>
curious now, but I can&#39;t afford the time to search anymore since it&#39;s not<br/>
information that I really need at this point.<br/>
<br/>
One of the articles I ran across while searching said that before hair<br/>
dryers, some parlors used to have women put their heads on the window sill<br/>
and let their hair hang down outside in the breeze to dry. They&#39;d switch<br/>
their position every once in awhile to dry all sides. People walking by<br/>
could often tell who&#39;s hair was being washed because they recognized the<br/>
color. Hey! I could look up the history of hair dryers and salons would have<br/>
to pre-date them. Back in a minute....<br/>
<br/>
.....I&#39;m back. Here&#39;s what I found:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the early 1900&#39;s, it was quite common to walk down a street and see a<br/>
long length of hair hanging out the window. As there were no hair dryers in<br/>
those days, salons resorted to simply opening the window and offering their<br/>
client&#39;s a chair.<br/>
<br/>
In 1920, the first true hair dryer came on the market, but it was extremely<br/>
large and heavy, and frequently overheated. Handles were often made of<br/>
wood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same information, but this time it came with dates. I think it&#39;s safe to say<br/>
that beauty parlors were around in 1910.<br/>

I also like the way the Google logo changes to reflect current events and<br/>
historic anniversaries. Click on the logo on Boxing day to find a wealth of<br/>
information about it. Today you would be off to 477,000 sites about the<br/>
Winter Olympics.<br/>
