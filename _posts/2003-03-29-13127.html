&lt;&lt; I&#39;m thinking lately I&#39;m not patient enough to answer anyone&#39;s questions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here.<br/>
I find myself growing shorter with people, more direct.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing in my case....I took a break from one <br/>
thread at unschooling.com because I was so incredibly frustrated and drained <br/>
from the negativity.<br/>
<br/>
I had to analyze it....I don&#39;t mind answering people&#39;s quesitons over and <br/>
over and over again. It&#39;s when they scream that &quot;it can&#39;t work in MY family&quot; <br/>
or accuse you of trying to control them when you&#39;re simply offering another <br/>
information.<br/>
If a person is truly interested in understanding, regardless of whether they <br/>
plan to implement the information, it&#39;s easier to have patience.<br/>
I read back over my paradigm shift posts and I didn&#39;t see where I ever <br/>
screamed mean things at anyone, though I did disagree loudly. There was some <br/>
level of respect for the people I disagreed with.<br/>
And that is what seems to be lacking in some of the recent conversations.<br/>
So I probably shouldn&#39;t answer questions for a while.....I need to build up <br/>
some reserves of patience...sigh.<br/>

magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

DARN it.  There had been a couple of posts quoted that I hadn&#39;t seen in the <br/>
original, but this one&#39;s crucial enough that I have to go into the evil <br/>
homepage archives.  ::shudder::<br/>
<br/>
Ren quoted and I don&#39;t know who she quoted!<br/>
<br/>
I get lost and slowed down in there, and I don&#39;t like lost or slow.<br/>
