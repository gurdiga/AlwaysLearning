&lt;&lt; The reason they won&#39;t use real-life examples is because they think it&#39;s  <br/>
wrong to talk about their own children.  It IS part of the philosophy to  not <br/>
use <br/>
real-life examples.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think Sandra is going to want to talk about TCS here, though. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind talking about it, but I can&#39;t be as supportive as some people <br/>
might like me to be.     It&#39;s not that it&#39;s a bad idea, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an idea <br/>
that doesn&#39;t allow examination in the form in which the main proponents present <br/>
it.   <br/>
<br/>
It would be like announcing the reason for an experiment, saying it&#39;s <br/>
successful, and then not showing any data.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard bad reports from a couple of people who met families whose main <br/>
philosophy was TCS and who had bad visits and never wanted to visit again.    <br/>
That can happen with families of ALL kinds, really.  Kids don&#39;t hit it off, bad <br/>
day for those kids, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But one complaint I have with kids who are &quot;out of hand&quot; (to use a telling <br/>
common phrase, and I&#39;ll get back to that) is when the parents seem entirely <br/>
unaware that things aren&#39;t going smoothly.   And my preference in cases where <br/>
things are going bad and my children or my possessions are suffering because of <br/>
the choices and actions of someone else&#39;s kids is that the parents would try to <br/>
persuade them, reason with them, remind them to share, to lighten up, to be <br/>
considerate.  <br/>
<br/>
In discussions in AOL&#39;s unschooling area years ago, which is where I and some <br/>
others here were first confronted with TCS&#39;s bold assurances that we weren&#39;t <br/>
doing it right with our kids, it was made clear that compromise is NOT the <br/>
goal, compromise is telling a child he can&#39;t have his way.  It was made clear <br/>
that persuasion is coercion and manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
So &quot;manipulation&quot; leads back to &quot;out of hand.&quot;   &quot;Manipulation&quot; literally <br/>
means to move something or someone around with your hands.  And &quot;out of hand&quot; <br/>
means off the leash/lead/reins, or out of reach of one&#39;s hand (as with a horse, <br/>
dog, child).  So &quot;out of hand&quot; might seem good and right to a TCS promoter. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 In its literal, philosophical, sense anyway.    My kids might be &quot;out of <br/>
hand&quot; (I don&#39;t control their moves) but they are not out of conscience.  They <br/>
feel responsibility for their own actions, and I feel secondary responsibility.  <br/>
If my mothering (or my genetic input) resulted in difficult children,  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t just throw up my hands and say &quot;Gosh, what can I do?  There&#39;s nothing can <br/>
be done within my philosophy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One mom in the big AOL-homeschooling days was writing lots and  wouldn&#39;t even <br/>
tell us whether she had children, how many, how old.  &quot;Irrelevant,&quot; she said. <br/>
 Just believe the philosophy for its own sake.   Y&#39;know, though, lots of <br/>
philosophies work VERY well in the theoretical stage.  Communism is one.  It&#39;s <br/>
just the addition of actual humans that makes it fall apart.  Some monastic <br/>
systems work pretty well (Buddhist and Christian), but they work well by <br/>
elimination of disruptive elements.<br/>
<br/>
So as a philosophy, it would need to start, I think, with &quot;Given an ideal <br/>
parent and an ideal child...&quot;   And maybe those families in which it&#39;s working <br/>
well, that IS the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Two families whose moms adopted TCS later on were families with LOTS of kids, <br/>
and both started off fundamentalist Christian, but moved away from that and <br/>
moved toward TCS.   <br/>
<br/>
I think in both situations because the moms were bright and loving and <br/>
involved, and because the children were already VERY &quot;in hand&quot; that letting them <br/>
make choices from that point was a luxurious bonus round to an <br/>
already-unschooling life.  It probably did seem the other swing of the pendelum.<br/>
<br/>
But for those who begin more in the middle, not at an extreme edge, the <br/>
arguments about coercion seem less crucial.  One classic argument that comes up is <br/>
seatbelts.  The TYC response seemed to be if the kid doesn&#39;t want to go in the <br/>
seatbelt, you just can&#39;t make the trip.   I just reported truthfully that I&#39;m <br/>
not above bribery, and was kinda blasted for being clearly coercive.  But <br/>
&quot;coercive&quot; in their lingo is defined even to asking nicely, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
Another conversation that just about did it permanently for me was whether a <br/>
kid could walk on a coffee table.    A toddler, wanting to walk on a table.  I <br/>
have two ratty coffee tables and I don&#39;t mind if kids dance on them.  BUT... <br/>
in the discussion, I said it&#39;s up to the owner of the coffee table.   That <br/>
seems clear to me.   But what wasn&#39;t clear from the TCS end was that it has other <br/>
political overtones, and the conferences at which it&#39;s presented are <br/>
libertarian and related conferences.<br/>
<br/>
I think another person&#39;s liberty ends where my coffeetable begins.<br/>
<br/>
And since I&#39;m more likely to let a kid walk on a coffeetable whose mother <br/>
would have totally forbidden it had she been there, I just cannot get worked up <br/>
to look more deeply into something it seems even the proponents haven&#39;t <br/>
examined.<br/>
<br/>
And my conclusion after years of reading bits of it here and there, and lumps <br/>
of it (there are a couple of full workshop things online, and one I read <br/>
lately), is that it&#39;s a way that some people who are lacking in interpersonal <br/>
skills justify not even trying to communicate with or know their children.  They <br/>
say &quot;Well, it&#39;s a violation of their space and personhood and that&#39;s why I <br/>
don&#39;t.&quot;  I think maybe some of them don&#39;t have the ability to communicate well <br/>
with others.<br/>
<br/>
That Howard Gardner stuff shed light on a lot of memories in my life, <br/>
honestly.  Looking back at the world through the lens of multiple intelligence <br/>
theory, I had a little festival of &quot;OH!  No WONDER!&quot; about lots of unsolved <br/>
mysteries in my past, with friends and relatives and schoolmates and those who taught <br/>
with me and people&#39;s reactions to me.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s EASY for someone to assume the rest of the world is like they are.  It&#39;s <br/>
comforting.  It&#39;s not true, though.   Another unschooling mom was over here <br/>
not long ago, and she was vehemently against jocks/sports.   Her derision was <br/>
thick.  It was STUPID.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be that way, because I didn&#39;t understand it, and because I wasn&#39;t <br/>
athletic, and because school had taught me that what&#39;s really important is <br/>
writing and reading, not glorified recess.    Because we played kickball and <br/>
dodgeball at recess, and because school is as school is, I saw sports as <br/>
over-glorifed P.E. (a very UNDERglorified class).  <br/>
<br/>
That was my own prejudice and ignorance, and I&#39;m glad I got over it.  By my <br/>
mid-20&#39;s I was looking at people without knowing their school records, whether <br/>
they were &quot;good students&quot; or not, and I started seeing the beauty and skill <br/>
involved in soccer, skiing (I wasn&#39;t DOING those things, but watching <br/>
boyfriends, best friends and other buddies do them with extreme grace, speed, amazing <br/>
skill), and then I joined the SCA and saw that even make-believe sword fighting <br/>
was something with depth and beauty and I couldn&#39;t begin to do it, so I&#39;d <br/>
better shut up about it.<br/>
<br/>
Gardner says interpersonal intelligence is as real as verbal or mathematical <br/>
or kinestheti or spatial.   I believe him.<br/>
<br/>
Some people who don&#39;t have any can seem just as derisive of those who do as I <br/>
was about jocks, when I was a teenager.  They were &quot;stupid&quot; because I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand what they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
If I can persuade my children (and my friends, and other people) to think <br/>
about why they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing, and to consider doing what will make <br/>
them and others feel better, that is just friendship, just parenting, just <br/>
discussion, in my life.  To others who can&#39;t do it, it&#39;s coercion and <br/>
manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong, but that&#39;s my theory about it this year.<br/>

&quot;success&quot;   The reason one follows the TCS theory is because one <br/>
believes it is the right and moral way to behave, not because it will <br/>
give you a &quot;good&quot; outcome.  The only outcome, I suppose, it that your <br/>
children will have the life that they want.  Not that they will turn out <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this is not an accurate description of the theory.  According to <br/>
TCS, one should share their theories and morality with their children.  <br/>
Not impose it, but certainly share it.  There is no such thing as <br/>
throwing up your hands and saying&quot; nothing can be done within my <br/>
philosophy.&quot;  That would be the antithesis of TCS which says that a <br/>
solution can always be found (or certainly that one should always be <br/>
sought). <br/>
<br/>
If children are &quot;out of hand&quot; as you say, and their parents are <br/>
completely unaware, then this is not really TCS as it is proposed <br/>
either.  This is more laissez faire.  TCS parents try to be very hands <br/>
on and help their children with conflicts and difficult situations.  Of <br/>
course, as you say elsewhere, theory is fine until you involve people <br/>
:-)  TCS parents do not necessarily implement TCS theory flawlessly <br/>
;-).   So sometimes laissez faire will slip in instead of coercion, when <br/>
being hands on would have been better.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, here&#39;s where you say the part about adding people to the <br/>
implementation of the theory.  But saying it is irrelevant whether one <br/>
is a parent or not really speaks to the issue of relying on &quot;experts.&quot;  <br/>
Are you saying that only parents can have an opinion about parenting?  <br/>
If one can only comment on something because they have experience or are <br/>
expert in that area, then we could say that you can only comment on the <br/>
problems of teens if you have one, or on Communism if you&#39;ve lived in a <br/>
communist country.  TCS proponents argue that one can have an opinion <br/>
based on a philosophy without having experienced every situation.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some monastic<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Backwards.  If we were all ideal, then maybe we wouldn&#39;t even need <br/>
philosophy or theories.  Everything would already be ideal!   TCS at its <br/>
core is about finding solutions to problems and about acknowledging our <br/>
fallibility.  It has nothing to do with being perfect. <br/>

TCS response is the common preference that you work out with your child. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think TCS people are all about being nice to your children.  So I&#39;m <br/>
not sure where asking nicely is not ok.  Parents also have needs that <br/>
need to be taken into account.  So a parent might say that they want to <br/>
get something done so they want to find a way to make it pleasant for <br/>
everyone.  Maybe that means stopping at a fun place on the way home, or <br/>
having certain games in the car or whatever.  I think where TCS and what <br/>
you are saying part ways is in the idea that one would use bribery in <br/>
the sense that the child could only get the pleasant thing if they do <br/>
something a certain way.  Realistically of course, if one is going to <br/>
stop for ice cream on the way home and there is no ice cream in the <br/>
house, then one would most likely need to get in the car to get the ice <br/>
cream.  So one could view it as bribery but if the child could have some <br/>
other goodie that you do have in the house without leaving, then it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be bribery, just an idea to try.  In other words, it would be <br/>
bribery to say you can only have a sweet if you come with me.  But to <br/>
say, come on let&#39;s go get this thing done and then we&#39;ll go have some <br/>
fun.  That has a different feel to it in my opinion.  So again, I have <br/>
to take issue with your characterization.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And my conclusion after years of reading bits of it here and there, <br/>

or know their children, then I&#39;d say they don&#39;t understand it yet.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Are you saying that only parents can have an opinion about parenting?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, but the opinions of non-parents are less valuable to me as a parent than <br/>
those of parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The opinions of people who had had babies were valuable to me when I was <br/>
pregnant.<br/>
The opinions of mothers who had nursed babies successfully were priceless to <br/>
me when I was nursing babies.<br/>
<br/>
And it DID matter to me whether their children seemed happy, and whether the <br/>
families seemed  content.<br/>
<br/>
Before I had any school-age children, I knew four homeschooling families <br/>
closely (same playgroup, same babysitting co-op. all through La Leche League).   <br/>
Two used structure and school at home.  Two were unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish everyone who considered homeschooling knew four families, two of each. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  What a good deal for me.<br/>
<br/>
It mattered to me that the unschooling families were close and happy and <br/>
their homes felt safe and calm.   It mattered to me also that the other two fam<br/>
ilies had punishments and kids who were sneaky and afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Theory wouldn&#39;t have taught me what observation and experience did.  I had <br/>
had all those kids at my house without their parents, and their behavior away <br/>
from their parents was revealing as well.<br/>
<br/>
People who know my kids, whether they know me too or not, know something <br/>
about unschooling that no theory will tell them.<br/>

position to know, my opinion would be much more than opinion.  It would be experience.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; systems work pretty well (Buddhist and Christian), but they work well by<br/>
<br/>
&gt; elimination of disruptive elements.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;How do you know?  Do you practice one of these systems ;-)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know because  people who have lived in them have written honestly and <br/>
openly about their experiences, without saying &quot;I can&#39;t tell you what order I was <br/>
in,&quot; or &quot;I operated a monastery, but I&#39;m not telling you whether there were any <br/>
monks, or how it went.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know because the information is available, and the concept and practice <br/>
have been around for thousands of years.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote &quot;The TCS response seemed to be...&quot; (only I typoed it, sorry)<br/>
and got &quot;There is no TCS response. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I say what seemed to be, that is more true than &quot;there is no response.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In previous conversations there have been responses.  Unless there&#39;s a <br/>
central TCS steeering committe deciding what &quot;the TCS response is or isn&#39;t, what I <br/>
learned from experience is valid when stated clearly as &quot;it seemed [to me].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe that means stopping at a fun place on the way home, or <br/>
<br/>
having certain games in the car or whatever.  I think where TCS and what <br/>
<br/>
you are saying part ways is in the idea that one would use bribery in <br/>
<br/>
the sense that the child could only get the pleasant thing if they do <br/>
<br/>
something a certain way.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Well yeah, they can&#39;t go for ice cream if they don&#39;t want to go at all.  So <br/>
if &quot;I&#39;ll get you ice cream&quot; gets a kid to agree to an outing with several <br/>
stops, that was called (clearly, overtly, accusingly) coercion.<br/>
<br/>
-=- That has a different feel to it in my opinion.  So again, I have <br/>
<br/>
to take issue with your characterization.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t characterizing your opinion.  I was reporting the very bad outcome <br/>
of what could have been a friendlier exchange on AOL when that was the <br/>
homeschooling place to be on the internet, and a TCS proponent came on and told us all <br/>
how badly we were treating our children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Again, not TCS.  If people use TCS as an excuse to not communicate with <br/>
<br/>
or know their children, then I&#39;d say they don&#39;t understand it yet.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe so.<br/>
But unless TCS eliminates those without social skills (as I suggested helps <br/>
keep the quality of monasteries high, and keep the peace there), they will have <br/>
to accept that their theory (understood or not) can be used as a <br/>
justification and a shield by those who weren&#39;t going to communicate well with children <br/>
anyway, so they are happy to find a group saying &quot;let them do what they want to <br/>
do; anything less is a violation of their rights.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Debra, where would you recommend people go for more information if they do <br/>
want to discuss TCS at length with people who are not as rigid as those couple <br/>
who came to make TCS look unattractive those years ago?   Is there a good <br/>
discussion group or website?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, but the opinions of non-parents are less valuable to me as a <br/>

&gt; those of parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if I said what I wanted to say as well as I might have.  <br/>
Thinking about it more, I want to say that if a person says something <br/>
that resonates for you, then it shouldn&#39;t matter whether or not they are <br/>
parents.  I certainly know the feeling of having non-parents say things <br/>
that don&#39;t ring true and you think, &quot;Well they have no idea.&quot;  But I <br/>
think that you can still learn from people who don&#39;t have children.  You <br/>
say later that we all have been teens.  We have all also been children, <br/>
and most of us have experience with being parented.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; pregnant.<br/>
&gt; The opinions of mothers who had nursed babies successfully were <br/>
&gt; priceless to<br/>
&gt; me when I was nursing babies.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course they are valuable.  I&#39;m just saying that others may have <br/>
something to offer as well.  I wouldn&#39;t discount someones information or <br/>
opinion just because they hadn&#39;t experienced it.   Especially if it <br/>
supports my own ;-) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And it DID matter to me whether their children seemed happy, and <br/>
&gt; whether the<br/>
&gt; families seemed  content.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before I had any school-age children, I knew four homeschooling families<br/>
&gt; closely (same playgroup, same babysitting co-op. all through La Leche <br/>
&gt; League).  <br/>
&gt; Two used structure and school at home.  Two were unschoolers. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish everyone who considered homeschooling knew four families, two <br/>
&gt; of each.<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;  What a good deal for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It mattered to me that the unschooling families were close and happy and<br/>
&gt; their homes felt safe and calm.   It mattered to me also that the <br/>
&gt; other two fam<br/>
&gt; ilies had punishments and kids who were sneaky and afraid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Theory wouldn&#39;t have taught me what observation and experience did.  I <br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; had all those kids at my house without their parents, and their <br/>
&gt; behavior away<br/>
&gt; from their parents was revealing as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People who know my kids, whether they know me too or not, know something<br/>
&gt; about unschooling that no theory will tell them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-If one can only comment on something because they have experience <br/>
&gt; or are<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; problems of teens if you have one, or on Communism if you&#39;ve lived in a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; communist country. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nobody grows up without having been a teen.<br/>
&gt; Communism is documented, socially, economically, politically, <br/>
&gt; financially. <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a part of history and current events, available for anyone to study.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-TCS proponents argue that one can have an opinion<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; based on a philosophy without having experienced every situation.  -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some opinions are more valuable than others.<br/>
&gt; Not all opinions are equal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree.  I just don&#39;t agree on the criterion used to decide <br/>
who&#39;s opinion is most valuable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;How do you know?  Do you practice one of these systems ;-)-=-<br/>

&gt; openly about their experiences, without saying &quot;I can&#39;t tell you what <br/>

&gt; in,&quot; or &quot;I operated a monastery, but I&#39;m not telling you whether there <br/>
&gt; were any<br/>
&gt; monks, or how it went.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one of the most difficult parts of TCS theory for me.  And I&#39;m <br/>
not sure what the answer is.  I know there are people on the TCS list <br/>
that could argue forcefully about why but I&#39;ve never been completely <br/>
clear.   I do believe in protecting other people&#39;s privacy.  So I try <br/>
not to talk about people that I know on email lists.  I do it in person <br/>
but I wish I did it less.  I&#39;m specifically talking about things that <br/>
the person you are talking about would be embarrassed or upset to know <br/>
that you were discussing them.  It&#39;s hard when you are needing support <br/>
from your friends.  But on an email list, I think we can discuss it more <br/>
objectively and less personally.  <br/>
<br/>
But the other part about  giving details has to do with the idea of not <br/>
needing to prove anything.  Do we not spank our kids because it would be <br/>
wrong to spank, or because we think spanking will make them turn out the <br/>
wrong way (angry, abusers, timid, whatever)?  We may have an opinion <br/>
about the second, but I think the reason we don&#39;t is because it&#39;s <br/>
wrong.  So I think that TCS argues that there is an objective search for <br/>
truth (not that we know what it is, but that we&#39;re always seeking) and <br/>
that it has nothing to do with what &quot;works&quot; the best.  I hope that makes <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; me].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I meant is that since there is no central committee, then there is <br/>
no one TCS response.  Sure, TCS proponents have ideas about how to <br/>
handle situations, but my point is that the only one that matters is the <br/>
common preference you find between the parties involved in the <br/>
situation.  The people on the outside (TCS or otherwise) could be <br/>
wrong.  But you knew that :-)  I did not mean to say that what people <br/>
said to you on lists were not responses. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve been in discussions where some considered it a good idea.  Most <br/>
TCS discussions (on the TCS list) I&#39;ve paid attention to (and I  ignore <br/>
a lot of them) have people arguing different points of view.  Of course <br/>
there are those on the list expressly to criticize the whole theory.  <br/>
But I mean even among those who consider themselves TCS.   So I guess <br/>
some &quot;TCS&quot; folks would consider that coercion but many would not.  Many <br/>
would view it as a creative way to solve a problem. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t mean my opinion.  I meant the characterization of TCS.  I was <br/>
trying to convey my different understanding of the theories than how you <br/>
were describing them.  I did not mean to suggest that you weren&#39;t <br/>
accurately describing what others have said.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; do; anything less is a violation of their rights.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That may be true but since TCS is not a religion and doesn&#39;t ask for a <br/>
statement of faith it would be hard to keep anyone from calling <br/>
themselves TCS.  Sounds kind of like unschooling :-)  Anyway,  I was <br/>
trying to explain my understanding of the philosophy.  Someone else <br/>
could come here and say I&#39;ve completely misunderstood it.  I guess <br/>
that&#39;s the problem with no central committee.  LOL. <br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good question.  There are other lists that have attempted to be <br/>
the &quot;kinder, gentler TCS.&quot;    There is one called Common Preference <br/>
Parenting.  I think the person who started this list chose the name in <br/>
an attempt to deal with the problem you mentioned about Taking Children <br/>
Seriously implying that everyone else is not.  Unfortunately it is not <br/>
that active at the moment.  The address is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:common-preference-parenting@yahoogroups.com">common-preference-parenting@yahoogroups.com</a>  if anyone wants to join and <br/>
ask questions.  Maybe we can get a conversation going.  There are many <br/>
TCS sublists (with TCS in the title) but all seem to be very quiet right <br/>
now.   In any case, I know that there are a few people on the TCS list <br/>
who have a non-confrontational, helpful style (in my opinion anyway).  <br/>
But I&#39;ve also learned to listen to the argument without taking it <br/>
personally.  It wasn&#39;t easy at first.  The first TCS discussion I was on <br/>
scared me to death.  It was mostly the non-TCS folks that got <br/>
particularly nasty but still the confrontation was very scary for me.  <br/>
In any case, these people who I think are very helpful also are on the <br/>
CPP list so perhaps that&#39;s a place to start. <br/>

-=-You <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
and most of us have experience with being parented.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
The latter two were not on your list of examples.<br/>
Having experience with being parented is the catalyst for many people to do <br/>
things more gently and compassionately than their parents did.  But when <br/>
someone intends to do just what their parents did because that&#39;s easier than really <br/>
considering what and why and how, then I don&#39;t have much respect for their <br/>
advice.  &quot;I was a slave for my parents, and my kid is going to be the same way.&quot;  <br/>
Those words were spoken by Bob Cooke, someone I&#39;ve know personally for a long <br/>
time who&#39;s about to have his first child, from not being careful with birth <br/>
control.  He won&#39;t be one of my sought-out sources of advice.  He has always <br/>
been clueless about children, but never had any so it didn&#39;t matter before.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is one of the most difficult parts of TCS theory for me.  And I&#39;m <br/>
<br/>
not sure what the answer is.  I know there are people on the TCS list <br/>
<br/>
that could argue forcefully about why but I&#39;ve never been completely <br/>
<br/>
clear.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not part of the theory, though.  That&#39;s part of the package.<br/>
The mystique.  The delivery.  The &quot;ooh, we&#39;re cool&quot; part.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are rarely mysterious.  They&#39;re out there helping people all <br/>
kinds of ways, and telling stories and inviting people over and going to <br/>
conferences and mixing it up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
But the other part about  giving details has to do with the idea of not <br/>
<br/>
needing to prove anything.  Do we not spank our kids because it would be <br/>
<br/>
wrong to spank, or because we think spanking will make them turn out the <br/>
<br/>
wrong way (angry, abusers, timid, whatever)? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If it turned out not spanking kids DID create axe murders (or whatever) then <br/>
spanking would be good.  But it turns out it&#39;s quite the other way around.  <br/>
People in prison report some horrendous abuses.  So if it is proven to turn out <br/>
better not to spank AND it&#39;s a more respectful, humane, loving thing, you have <br/>
the theory and the results both together.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I think that TCS argues that there is an objective search for <br/>
<br/>
truth (not that we know what it is, but that we&#39;re always seeking) and <br/>
<br/>
that it has nothing to do with what &quot;works&quot; the best.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe so.  But if so, it  needs to stay where it is and not mix with <br/>
unschooling, because unschooling help can&#39;t help but involve itself with reality and <br/>
what works well for children and for families.  It&#39;s not a political statement. <br/>
 It&#39;s a way of helping children learn and grow without school.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I did not mean to say that what people <br/>
<br/>
said to you on lists were not responses. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You are sayig they&#39;re not TCS responses, but they were clearly indicated as <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
-=- In any case, I know that there are a few people on the TCS list <br/>
<br/>
who have a non-confrontational, helpful style (in my opinion anyway).  -=-<br/>
<br/>
For my tastes, confrontation is better than evasion.<br/>
Anecdote is better than theory.<br/>
<br/>
I guess interested people could just go to google and put in <br/>
TCS Taking Children Seriously <br/>
and read what they find, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243041514">I want to chime in and support Debra&#39;s interpretation of TCS. It is <br/>
touted as an educational philosophy. It does not assume that it is a <br/>
parenting method. It attempts to indicate the obsticles to effective <br/>
learning. It does not object to coercion in the face of danger, but <br/>
it does indicate how coercive actions can interfere with learning.<br/>
<br/>
Many responders on the site are not as creative as others at problem <br/>
solving. Neither am I, or other individuals in my family, ALL THE <br/>
TIME. But that doesn&#39;t mean that we are not learning to find common <br/>
solutions through trial and error. However, on the rare occasions <br/>
that we don&#39;t find a common preference it does not mean that there <br/>
wasn&#39;t one available. We just did not find it. Not finding a common <br/>
preference indicates that we resigned ourselves to coercion. Someone <br/>
having to do something that they did not want to do IS damaging to <br/>
the process of learning that consensual living can be done.<br/>
<br/>
While learning other information (such as math or drawing or <br/>
cooking,etc), the learning can similarly be damaged by having to do <br/>
something that one does not want to do. Learning is an active <br/>
process. If one has no choice but to do something they are learning <br/>
that sometimes force can be used. We learn by participation. There is <br/>
an old German saying: one convinced against his will, is of the same <br/>
opinion still.<br/>
<br/>
TCS is a philosophy of learning. The process of learning can <br/>
perpetuate the idea that force can be used or not. TCS is a process <br/>
of interacting with children so that they can learn that consensual <br/>
living does exist. The use of coercion damages this life lesson. <br/>
Living without the alternative of force enhances problem solving. <br/>
Every problem is new. Every solution is unique. These problem-solving <br/>
lessons are damaged by coercion. Coercion eliminates possible <br/>
solutions. So no one solution is THE solution for car seats or <br/>
bedtimes or whatever. There are an infinite number of creative <br/>
possibilities. <br/>
<br/>
All of this is actually just a rudimentary aspect of consensual <br/>
living.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is another facet of learning about life. Consensual <br/>
living is a philosophy of living life.<br/>
<br/>
I would like a group of people who are more globally interested in <br/>
discussing the philosophy of consensual living. The arenas of <br/>
consensual living include politics, economics, family, relationships, <br/>
and education, etc. As we embrace consensual living as a philosophy, <br/>
it makes life learning so much easier to conceptualize and experience.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Several of my friends strongly dislike the format of TCS&#39;s <br/>
preaching due to the harshness and negativity associated with failing <br/>
to be creative. Ironically, this &quot;failure&quot; attitude of TCS&#39;s site <br/>
obstructs learning about consensual living itself. But the TCS site <br/>
does state that the site responders are fallable. Don&#39;t shoot the <br/>
messenger, the message is relevant.<br/>

&gt; &gt; dog, child).  So &quot;out of hand&quot; might seem good and right to a TCS <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not impose it, but certainly share it.  There is no such thing as <br/>

&gt; solution can always be found (or certainly that one should always <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sought). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If children are &quot;out of hand&quot; as you say, and their parents are <br/>
&gt; completely unaware, then this is not really TCS as it is proposed <br/>
&gt; either.  This is more laissez faire.  TCS parents try to be very <br/>

Sorry, I snipped the text and mis-remembered your name -- I thought I had it right. <br/>
 <br/>
I guess what there is to discuss is that I&#39;d like to find some way to resolve safety issues without feeling heavy-handed, but with two kids (and two adults) it often seems impossible to honor everyone&#39;s position and get anything done without coercing someone.  I sometimes wonder if there&#39;s a better answer that gives results without insisting someone bend, because I&#39;m often able to resolve less &#39;important&#39; situations without any concession.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187247789">I just don&#39;t find TCS all that mysterious.  I think it&#39;s pretty <br/>
straightforward.  For me, the day to day examples of unschoolers lives <br/>
(for example) are not that useful.   I&#39;d much rather learn from talking <br/>
about the ideas.   You can call not sharing the details of one&#39;s life <br/>
and of one&#39;s children&#39;s lives evasive but it doesn&#39;t feel that way to <br/>
me.  To me it&#39;s a matter of respect, not evasion. <br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I find the day to day examples to often be tedious, <br/>
self-congratulatory, and sometimes embarrassing, even painful to read.  <br/>
So are those who want to give all of these examples/details right and <br/>
those who don&#39;t wrong?    Does it mean that a discussion can&#39;t take <br/>
place?  And why would you assume that those who don&#39;t share all of these <br/>
details in public forums mean that they don&#39;t invite people over, go to <br/>
conferences, and mix it up?  <br/>
<br/>
You also say about my spanking example:<br/>
So if it is proven to turn out better not to spank AND it&#39;s a more <br/>
respectful, humane, loving thing, you have<br/>
the theory and the results both together.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m saying that the theory is enough for me.  We know that there are <br/>
people out there that would offer &quot;proofs&quot; that spanking IS good.  I <br/>
don&#39;t need proof (or anecdotes from parents that say something &quot;works&quot; <br/>
for their family) to do the what I believe to be the respectful, humane, <br/>
loving thing. <br/>
<br/>
You also say TCS needs to stay where it is and not mix with <br/>
unschooling?    Gee, tell us what you really think!  Are you talking <br/>
about the theory or the people?  Because in the end, it&#39;s just people <br/>
sharing ideas.   People like me who unschool and do my best (very <br/>
imperfectly) to parent consentually.    And you may just run into me, <br/>
&quot;mixing it up&quot; at an unschooling conference :-)<br/>
<br/>
Debra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s not part of the theory, though.  That&#39;s part of the package.<br/>
&gt; The mystique.  The delivery.  The &quot;ooh, we&#39;re cool&quot; part.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschoolers are rarely mysterious.  They&#39;re out there helping people all<br/>
&gt; kinds of ways, and telling stories and inviting people over and going to<br/>
&gt; conferences and mixing it up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the other part about  giving details has to do with the idea of not<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; needing to prove anything.  Do we not spank our kids because it would be<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; wrong to spank, or because we think spanking will make them turn out the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; wrong way (angry, abusers, timid, whatever)? -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it turned out not spanking kids DID create axe murders (or <br/>
&gt; whatever) then<br/>
&gt; spanking would be good.  But it turns out it&#39;s quite the other way <br/>
&gt; around. <br/>
&gt; People in prison report some horrendous abuses.  So if it is proven to <br/>
&gt; turn out<br/>
&gt; better not to spank AND it&#39;s a more respectful, humane, loving thing, <br/>
&gt; you have<br/>
&gt; the theory and the results both together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-So I think that TCS argues that there is an objective search for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; truth (not that we know what it is, but that we&#39;re always seeking) and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; that it has nothing to do with what &quot;works&quot; the best.  -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe so.  But if so, it  needs to stay where it is and not mix with<br/>
&gt; unschooling, because unschooling help can&#39;t help but involve itself <br/>
&gt; with reality and<br/>
&gt; what works well for children and for families.  It&#39;s not a political <br/>
&gt; statement.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a way of helping children learn and grow without school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=- I did not mean to say that what people<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; said to you on lists were not responses. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are sayig they&#39;re not TCS responses, but they were clearly <br/>
&gt; indicated as<br/>
&gt; such.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=- In any case, I know that there are a few people on the TCS list<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; who have a non-confrontational, helpful style (in my opinion anyway).  -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For my tastes, confrontation is better than evasion.<br/>
&gt; Anecdote is better than theory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess interested people could just go to google and put in<br/>
&gt; TCS Taking Children Seriously<br/>
&gt; and read what they find, though.<br/>

<br/>
Some ideas to consider.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve tried some but don&#39;t know which <br/>
ones so I&#39;ll just throw them out there.  Explain the safety issues.  <br/>
Children can be very rational.  Demonstrate the dangers in less <br/>
dangerous ways.  Move very slowly in the driveway then gently but a <br/>
little quickly apply pressure to the brake.  Let the child feel the <br/>
force of the car without a seatbelt  (in this controlled way that is).   <br/>
Then they can feel that they won&#39;t be able to hold themselves down when <br/>
you are moving fast.   Scary but might be worth a try if wearing <br/>
seatbelts is the issue.  Maybe there are other ways to demonstrate this <br/>
that are safer or maybe I should say less scary???  Maybe just having <br/>
them run fast into your arm.  Then explain how they doubled over your <br/>
arm and couldn&#39;t stop their upper body from going forward.  I&#39;m assuming <br/>
a child small enough that wouldn&#39;t break your arm ;-)<br/>
<br/>
See if it&#39;s an issue of comfort with a particular car or booster seat.  <br/>
Maybe it can be made more comfortable.  There&#39;s that theory that kids <br/>
need to learn that sometimes they just have to do something.  Rather <br/>
than go there, maybe find out what the specific problem or problems are <br/>
and try to address those. <br/>
<br/>
Brainstorm with the kids when you aren&#39;t on your way out the door.  A <br/>
tough one, I know!  But it&#39;s something that comes up over and over again <br/>
so maybe have some ideas ready.  I sometimes find it hard to remember <br/>
that it just isn&#39;t that exciting for one kid to shlep for another&#39;s <br/>
activity.  What if that activity signalled something special for the <br/>
child not doing the activity?  Special mom and kid time to read a book <br/>
or do a craft.  Maybe something that you just never get around to at home.<br/>
<br/>
A few ideas.  Hope something strikes a chord.<br/>

Frankly, I find the day to day examples to often be tedious, <br/>
self-congratulatory, and sometimes embarrassing, even painful to read.  <br/>
So are those who want to give all of these examples/details right and <br/>

I usually do say what I really think.  And when it&#39;s my own lit, I don&#39;t even <br/>
hesitate.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to start a list and slant it your own way, yahoo makes it easy, <br/>
and I&#39;d be fine with you advertising it here.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s the beginning.<br/>
In the end, it&#39;s children living the best lives their parents can or will <br/>
provide them.<br/>

The theory isn&#39;t enough for me. My children can&#39;t eat, read or play with <br/>
theory.<br/>

<br/>
I went to La Leche League.  People talked about nursing babies.  They nursed <br/>
babies right in front of me.  They saw me nurse, and gave me advice.  Those <br/>
who weren&#39;t giving examples and details weren&#39;t doing me any good.  The theory <br/>
isn&#39;t always enough.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So are those who want to give all of these examples/details right and <br/>

I have no interest in &quot;discussion&quot; when examples aren&#39;t given, personally.<br/>
I&#39;m sure the world is big enough for you to find some theory-only people to <br/>

at some point when they were moving from a safety seat into a seat belt had a <br/>

<br/>
I have never had anyone say I don&#39;t want to buckle up or just &quot;no&quot;.  So not <br/>
sure what to do with that.  I guess I would talk with them about why I think it <br/>
is important, what the law is.  Find out what their reason is for not wanting <br/>
to buckle up etc.  Sometimes the reason can be for comfort issues that can <br/>
easily be resolved.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t use a certain &quot;philosophy&quot; in the way I communicate.  It does <br/>
incorporate techniques from NVC, and the principles that Jan Fortune-Wood talks about <br/>
ring true with our family and work very well.  Finding agreed upon solutions <br/>
or common preferences.  Without coercion.  I feel that my boys truly feel <br/>
heard.  They know that we are all on the same side. They know that we will talk <br/>
and work until we do find that common preference, and that the common preference <br/>
is in there somewhere.  With that knowledge they are willing to work for it <br/>
too.<br/>

Us, too, or neither.  :)  Modelling is a big part of it.   Having always <br/>
buckled up is another.  Having car seats that the annoyed  toddler could not undo <br/>
by himself helped, too.  Still, my youngest always  hated the car seat, but he <br/>
could be persuaded.  I don&#39;t remember ever  buckling him in when he was <br/>
throwing himself backwards to prevent it.  He  just always consented.  We tried to <br/>
make going places as fun as possible,  tbough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050654040">We&#39;ve not had a problem with seatbelts and our own children since toddlerhood, but sometimes with visiting children it&#39;s been an issue.  My own kids are more likely to freak out if I even start the car before they&#39;re buckled in, but they&#39;ve all resisted the carseat after age 3 or so.  The most recent version of this is that Dan wants his carseat moved to the middle of the backseat (right now they each sit at a window).  Sure, I could buckle his seat in there, but it would really crowd his brother.  What do you say when the only reason you can&#39;t comply is fairness to others?  He&#39;s never acknowledged it would be unfair to his brother -- I&#39;ve just told him I won&#39;t do it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I find my biggest challenge with consensual living is reaching a compromise when one of us wants/needs to go somewhere and others resist going along.  My kids are too young to stay home alone, and we simply don&#39;t have the income to pay a sitter (besides where would I find someone mid-day on a weekday during the schoolyear?).  It seems the more I try to convince for the activity or commitment, the more resistance I get.  Fortunately, it&#39;s not terribly often, but invariably it&#39;s when I simply don&#39;t have the time to negotiate.<br/>
 <br/>
A recent example is that Andy has decided we doesn&#39;t want to go along to LaLeche meetings.  I&#39;m one of two leaders in our group, so skipping the meeting really isn&#39;t an option.  I&#39;m on call for the phones one day a week, and also listed online, so I sometimes get calls when it&#39;s not my day.  When I interrupt or have to put off something he wants to take a call, he&#39;s very upset.  This week, he&#39;s said several times that he&#39;d like me to quit LaLeche League.  That&#39;s not an option -- I really enjoy this and it&#39;s important to me.  <br/>
 <br/>
And what do you do/say within TCS for those instances where two children are at complete odds over something and there&#39;s just no physical way to accommodate both?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know lots of LaLeche League Leaders and they have created a network of <br/>
sorts for this area.  I know they communicate with each other and are all good <br/>
friends etc.  They work together to actively seek out new people interested in <br/>
becoming leaders to take all the work off of one or two individuals.  They keep <br/>
in touch so that if one has another engagement someone else will help out with <br/>
her meetings etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I have also heard many of them talking about their children not especially <br/>
liking the meetings to they make it fun for them as well.  For one family there <br/>
is a ritual of going out to eat before hand.  Each child getting to pick the <br/>
restaurant on a rotating basis.  For one family she bring toys and games etc.  <br/>
And a few families have gotten together to switch off child care.  <br/>
<br/>
I have always believed that there is a solution in there somewhere we just <br/>
need to put in the time and effort to find it.  It really helps to accurately <br/>
label our feelings and define our needs first and to really feel heard.  <br/>
<br/>
I do know how he feels with the phone calls.  I get upset when Jackson and I <br/>
are talking or doing something and he stops everything to take a phone call <br/>
from the hospital.  I feel unimportant to him.  Like a stranger is more <br/>
important than I am.  But we have talked about it and worked out a solution so that <br/>
everyone is happy.  He answers the page or phone call but if it is not important <br/>
he will call them back when we are finished talking.  So I know that if he <br/>
continues to talk on the phone it is important.  I feel heard.  I feel <br/>
important.  I feel that he is considering my feelings and needs.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Not finding a common <br/>
<br/>
preference indicates that we resigned ourselves to coercion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We planted bamboo this morning.  A friend gave us root cuttings.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I had different ideas about where they should best go.  Nobody <br/>
coerced anyone, but neither totally &quot;won&quot; either.   We agreed on different <br/>
plans.  We compromised.  We didn&#39;t have unlimited bamboo.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not young enough to believe it&#39;s now or never, though.  We both know <br/>
that that bamboo can be moved next year if we get a better idea.<br/>
<br/>
But we didn&#39;t resign ourselves to coercion.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;Someone having to do something that they did not want to do IS damaging to <br/>
<br/>
the process of learning that consensual living can be done.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People have to do things they don&#39;t want to do LOTS and lots of times.  When <br/>
Kirby was little he never, ever wanted to take a crap.   But he had to.   <br/>
<br/>
I think having to do things you don&#39;t want to do is evidence against the <br/>
theory that consensual living is always possible.  Even if you live all by <br/>
yourself, you&#39;ll end up doing some things you&#39;d rather not have done.  A philosophy <br/>
that allows for that seems healthier to me than one that says &quot;If you felt you <br/>
had no choice, someone wasn&#39;t working hard enough to provide you with a <br/>
choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it promises something that can&#39;t really be delivered.<br/>
<br/>
As with most things, I wonder if the best people can do is approach <br/>
consensual living, not accomplish it.  Making the more-consensual choice will gradually <br/>
edge nearer to it.<br/>
<br/>
It does bother me to get yet another condescending lesson on how coercive <br/>
outsiders to that theory are, though, when my own real life is the least coercive <br/>
of any real-life family I personally know.  And it wouldn&#39;t bother me or feel <br/>
so condescending if those who assure me/us that we just don&#39;t get it would <br/>
tell some personal stories to show that they really DO get it, and that it&#39;s <br/>
really workable.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way easier to critique another&#39;s stories if it&#39;s all theoretical than to <br/>
compare your own life to theirs and then pick apart threads and ideas and <br/>
practices and trade successes.  In a one-sided exchange, where one person won&#39;t <br/>
&quot;show theirs,&quot; it&#39;s just a lecture or a benign/veiled/oozing attack, and not a <br/>
sharing at all.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a theoretical list, it&#39;s a real discussion of and about real <br/>
families.<br/>

My first choice is not to cook today at all, and I kinda wish someone would <br/>
come and cook for me.  But my wishing isn&#39;t going to make it happen.  And I&#39;ll <br/>
probably cook something later on. &lt;g&gt;  Not my first choice.  But I will choose <br/>
to do it.  Not REALLY what I want, but what I will settle for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that makes more sense.  I still think it&#39;s a lot about attitude but<br/>
I see where you are coming from.   I think when you see it&#39;s always a<br/>
choice it is powerful and not self defeating like &#39;I *have* to cook again&#39;.<br/>
I&#39;ve just found changing my feelings about those types of tasks makes all<br/>
the difference in my feelings of happiness and my ability to do all the<br/>
things to help my family run smoothly.  <br/>

<br/>
There is a difference between &quot;having&quot; to do something you don&#39;t want <br/>
to do (it requires force by another) and always doing what you want <br/>
to do (no one is forced to provide what you want). <br/>
<br/>
I do believe that what one really wants is what one chooses if no <br/>
fear or threat of force exists. Why wouldn&#39;t one choose what they <br/>
really want? <br/>
<br/>
I really want my family to have a clean house (actually I need to be <br/>
cleaning right now! lol.) and a cooked meal and save for other things <br/>
than catering or a live-in cook. So I really do want to cook tonight. <br/>
I just didn&#39;t consider my real priorities throughly. In essense, I <br/>
changed my mind: I do want to cook. We all can change our minds when <br/>
we understand our priorities and choices.<br/>
<br/>
We can choose to be happy with the choice or choose to believe we had <br/>
no choice. But we always have a choice. Only force or coercion <br/>
between people eliminates choice. Even life is a choice. I choose to <br/>
be happy with life because experiencing life is my main priority, <br/>
sometimes even over doing things that I don&#39;t like to do.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;Ok, have to step in here :)  You and I JUST had the <br/>
conversation last<br/>
&gt; &gt;month.  I mentioned it was a hot button issue for me.  We ALWAYS <br/>
have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;choice - especially the choice of attitude but even the choice of <br/>
action.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes.   We can&#39;t always get our way.  If a choice I insist on is <br/>
going to land <br/>
&gt; me in prison, I didn&#39;t get my way.  I&#39;ll need to look at all <br/>
aspects of the <br/>
&gt; results of my choices and follow-ups.  If I REALLY really don&#39;t <br/>
want to pay <br/>
&gt; taxes I don&#39;t really, really have to.  But I can&#39;t withhold taxes, <br/>
not report,  <br/>
&gt; stay home and spend all the tax-free money.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have to feed my children.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have to stay here another night.  I can leave today, run <br/>
and hide, <br/>
&gt; &quot;start a new life.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m choosing not to leave.   I like it here.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew when I wrote that that I&#39;d be called on it, so that&#39;s fine.<br/>
&gt; -=-&gt;&gt;People have to do things they don&#39;t want to do LOTS and lots <br/>

&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People choose to do things they didn&#39;t really want to do lots of <br/>
times.  <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s closer to what I meant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My first choice is not to cook today at all, and I kinda wish <br/>
someone would <br/>
&gt; come and cook for me.  But my wishing isn&#39;t going to make it <br/>
happen.  And I&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; probably cook something later on. &lt;g&gt;  Not my first choice.  But I <br/>
will choose <br/>
&gt; to do it.  Not REALLY what I want, but what I will settle for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (If someone can think of a swift, tight phrase to say what I&#39;m <br/>
saying <br/>
&gt; awkwardly, jump in and save me!)<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Not finding a common<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; preference indicates that we resigned ourselves to coercion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We planted bamboo this morning.  A friend gave us root cuttings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband and I had different ideas about where they should best go.<br/>
Nobody<br/>
&gt; coerced anyone, but neither totally &quot;won&quot; either.   We agreed on different<br/>
&gt; plans.  We compromised.  We didn&#39;t have unlimited bamboo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re not young enough to believe it&#39;s now or never, though.  We both know<br/>
&gt; that that bamboo can be moved next year if we get a better idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But we didn&#39;t resign ourselves to coercion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &lt;&lt;Someone having to do something that they did not want to do IS damaging<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the process of learning that consensual living can be done.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People have to do things they don&#39;t want to do LOTS and lots of times.<br/>
When<br/>
&gt; Kirby was little he never, ever wanted to take a crap.   But he had to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think having to do things you don&#39;t want to do is evidence against the<br/>
&gt; theory that consensual living is always possible.  Even if you live all by<br/>
&gt; yourself, you&#39;ll end up doing some things you&#39;d rather not have done.  A<br/>
philosophy<br/>
&gt; that allows for that seems healthier to me than one that says &quot;If you felt<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; had no choice, someone wasn&#39;t working hard enough to provide you with a<br/>
&gt; choice.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it promises something that can&#39;t really be delivered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As with most things, I wonder if the best people can do is approach<br/>
&gt; consensual living, not accomplish it.  Making the more-consensual choice<br/>
will gradually<br/>
&gt; edge nearer to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It does bother me to get yet another condescending lesson on how coercive<br/>
&gt; outsiders to that theory are, though, when my own real life is the least<br/>
coercive<br/>
&gt; of any real-life family I personally know.  And it wouldn&#39;t bother me or<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; so condescending if those who assure me/us that we just don&#39;t get it would<br/>
&gt; tell some personal stories to show that they really DO get it, and that<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really workable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s way easier to critique another&#39;s stories if it&#39;s all theoretical than<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; compare your own life to theirs and then pick apart threads and ideas and<br/>
&gt; practices and trade successes.  In a one-sided exchange, where one person<br/>
won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &quot;show theirs,&quot; it&#39;s just a lecture or a benign/veiled/oozing attack, and<br/>
not a<br/>
&gt; sharing at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This isn&#39;t a theoretical list, it&#39;s a real discussion of and about real<br/>
&gt; families.<br/>
