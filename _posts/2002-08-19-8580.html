<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128949057">How awful for her to be labelling her children! And the unfortunate <br/>
&quot;ungifted&quot; one! Geez! I think I&#39;m gonna be sick! Perhaps &#39;Controlled <br/>
Unschooling&#39; (isn&#39;t that an oxymoron?) is a better term. I guess I&#39;m not <br/>
in such a magnanamous mood as you were. Please forgive my jumping in <br/>
with a negative post.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Marla and I try to unschool my 3 boys (7, 3 and 1) and the 7 <br/>
year old goes from the TV to the computer to his gameboy back to the TV <br/>
unless I take a stand and make him go outside to play (without the <br/>
Gameboy)!! He&#39;s learned to read on his own (I just read books to him) <br/>
and I swear he will write his own computer game programs soon. I&#39;m <br/>
having a hard time deschooling myself and occasionally I will push math <br/>
problems on the 7 year old (he&#39;s a whiz at it, really) to appease my dh <br/>
who is afraid the kids are learning nothing all day.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Marla<br/>
<br/>
PS Pokemon is a learning experience in itself! Wow, the creative minds <br/>
that come up with this stuff!! I&#39;m surprised how much I can talk with my <br/>
7 year old now that he tells me all about the Pokemon he has captured <br/>
and how he did it and what type they are and how they evolve and what <br/>
special attacks they have and on and on.<br/>

&gt; Prodigy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Children (I know many people who have Prodigy Children. I do not.) and <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; she was unschooling them. I was in a magnanimous mood, so I did not <br/>
&gt; get into<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the whole idea of &quot;unschooling them.&quot; But as she talked about all the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Prodigious Activities her PC&#39;s were participating in, I wondered aloud <br/>
&gt; at how<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; motivated they must be, to be doing so much, as Unschoolers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She explained that, &quot;Of course, my children are Gifted (well, except for<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is a New Movement where one plunges one&#39;s child into <br/>
&gt; intensive<br/>

&gt; actitives everytime he or she casually mentions an interest that could be<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; academic or Arts related. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I started thinking about what REAL Accelerated Unschooling would look<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; like. I decided it has very little to do with your kid. I think it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; speedily<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504292847">No, I&#39;ve never heard of Accellerated Unschooling, and it sounds like the <br/>
stupidest thing in the (heavily stupid, at times) world!<br/>

MY children are gifted, too, without exception, and WE (please read this <br/>
sentence with facetious emphasis) unschool like this: get train books <br/>
from the library, ride on trains, go to train museums, play with train <br/>
sets at home, play with train sets at toy stores and bookstores, read <br/>
books and websites about trains, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Does Poor Nate get to do any Pokemon, in and around all this <br/>
Unschooling? Somehow, I doubt it. Why do all these people think <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379375233">Accelerated Unschooling sounds like a sure fire way to make sure your <br/>
kids never tell you what they are really interested in.  Geez what a <br/>
wacky idea.  Sounds like mom has a some big issues :).<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and Pokemon.  My husband was breifly into it.  And I love <br/>
figuring out the names.  And making the connections with the names <br/>
and what they do.  Ok I have a lot of time on my hands but the names <br/>
are cool and a lot of them are informative if you break them down.  <br/>
It has renewed my intrest in scientific names for animals and things <br/>
names that really mean something.  Makes me really want to learn <br/>
latin *sigh* it&#39;s amazing how things flow together.  <br/>

young boy who was a gifted chest player and the parents got involved and<br/>
how the family learned to back off and let the kid enjoy chest without<br/>
him being a world champion.  Believe me, there are tons of parents who<br/>
put their  entire egos in their kids, not just homeschoolers.  Last year<br/>
I helped out with a science fair.  All the other parents were parents of<br/>
&quot;gifted&quot; public school program.   One mom said that her kids get 4.0<br/>
average no matter what.  I asked her wonder if they are not learning<br/>
anything.  That question didn&#39;t make sense to her.  Lisa Hardiman  <br/>

WERE 8 a.m. workshops (didn&#39;t read my program very well).  At 12:30, I ran<br/>
off to the one Tad Williams talk I could schedule into my weekend, *with* my<br/>
otherwise never before interested in writing daughter, who had attended<br/>
another of his workshops Saturday and was keen for more.<br/>
<br/>
Shoulda hit the bar, I guess!<br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;Of course, my children are Gifted (well, except for <br/>
Nate), so we have begun Accelerated Unschooling.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Poor Nate!! (whoever he is)<br/>
<br/>
Poor Nate being a retarded accelerated unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be so far BEHIND, and so disabled and disadvantaged and different.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, I started thinking about what REAL Accelerated Unschooling would look <br/>
like. I decided it has very little to do with your kid. I think it&#39;s speedily <br/>
letting go of all those preconceived notions about Education and Learning. <br/>
It&#39;s very quickly getting past those &quot;Ohmygod, I&#39;mdestroyingmychild&#39;slife!&quot; <br/>
episodes. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES.  The mom should quickly get OVER her serious desire to accelerate life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Have any of you heard of Accelerated Unschooling? This woman says there are <br/>
support groups throughout the country, but I couldn&#39;t even find a web site <br/>
notice about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NO.  Find her and ask her to write to me.  I&#39;m serious.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  In my opinion, <br/>
there can be no such thing as accelerated unschooling.  You <br/>
either let your kids learn what they want at their own mental pace <br/>
and for how long (or short) a time as they want, or you don&#39;t <br/>
unschool.  Period. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No kidding.  How fast can &quot;at their own speed&quot; really go!??</div>
