<div id="ygrps-yiv-168589827">Forwarding info -- thought many of you might be interested in this very <br/>
public bashing of public schools... If you are interested in a national <br/>
teleconference about this topic after the show, please read to the end.<br/>
*****************************<br/>
Subject: Stossel 20/20 ABC special on weaknesses of public<br/>
schooling....Alliance hosts two public teleconferences to discuss<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stupid In America: How We Are Cheating Our Kids&quot; <br/>
with John Stossel airs Jan. 13 (10 to 11 p.m. ET) on ABC. <br/>
See below how to order a copy or transcript.<br/>
<br/>
In the words of E Ray Moore, good friend and<br/>
president of Exodus Mandate:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Now Stossel and 20/20 are set to puncture the last myth of <br/>
complacent suburban <br/>
parents who delude themselves by thinking that, whatever problems <br/>
there may be <br/>
elsewhere, their schools are &quot;different.&quot; As Stossel and 20/20 point <br/>
out, not <br/>
only do our 12th graders do worse in math and science, for example, <br/>
than students <br/>
in almost all other industrialized countries, the longer our <br/>
students are in <br/>
public schools, the worse they do in relation to their international <br/>
peers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While I hate to quibble with my friend Rev. Ray, I suspect<br/>
it&#39;s NOT the last myth. The &quot;public school&quot; establishment<br/>
is certainly adept at making up new myths when the <br/>
public sniffs the rat in the current myth du jour.<br/>
<br/>
The special is set to run Friday night at 10pm Eastern,<br/>
9pm Central, and again at 10pm Mountain, then Pacific,<br/>
Alaska, and Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
The Alliance is hosting two teleconferences on<br/>
Friday night.... open to all our Signatories of the<br/>
Proclamation.... and the public! <br/>
<br/>
That means you are welcome to forward this to<br/>
your own email list .... or even your pesky brother-<br/>
in-law who thinks things are just ducky in HIS<br/>
local school.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how you connect:<br/>
<br/>
FIRST TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>
<br/>
This will be held 15 minutes after the show<br/>
airs in Eastern and Central time zones:<br/>
<br/>
11:15pm Eastern.......10:15pm Central<br/>
<br/>
Mountain and West Coast people are welcome<br/>
to come on and get a preview, if you will, from<br/>
the reactions of those who have already seen it.<br/>
<br/>
9:15pm Mountain....... 8:15pm Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
Alaska and Hawaii folks.... and even those in<br/>
Europe who want to get up in the middle of<br/>
the night....are welcome, too. But you gotta<br/>
figure out the time for yourself. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SECOND TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>
<br/>
A second teleconference will be held three hours<br/>
later: 15 minutes after 20/20 airs on the West Coast:<br/>
<br/>
11:15pm Pacific<br/>
    which is 12:15am (Sat) Mountain<br/>
    and 1:15am Central, 2:15am Eastern<br/>
<br/>
We may get some Brits on the second teleconference,<br/>
as it will be 7:15am Saturday morning in England.. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, I was on the phone for an hour this morning with<br/>
James Stanfield at the E G West Centre in England<br/>
discussing the show. James Tooley, Director of the centre<br/>
(who will receive the Alexis de Tocqueville Award at SepCon2007,<br/>
May 4-6, Dallas, was just back from India and his sleep<br/>
pattern may have him fit to join us. <br/>
<br/>
HOW YOU DIAL THE TELECONFERENCE-----<br/>
<br/>
Using your cell or regular telephone, from your<br/>
own easy chair at home---or driving down the<br/>
highway---- dial this number at the appointed hour <br/>
in your time zone above:<br/>
<br/>
1 (319) 632-1100   pass code 682-129 #<br/>
<br/>
If you have a noisy background, just press 6<br/>
to mute yourself. When you want to say <br/>
something, press 6 again to un-mute.<br/>
<br/>
MISCELLANEOUS STUFF-----<br/>
<br/>
John Stossel is apparently quite active in his<br/>
blog and frequently responds to emails.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to sound off with praise or a <br/>
suggestion about a future education special,<br/>
or both, you can do so here:<br/>

<br/>
Earlier, he wrote &quot;If you would like to purchase a tape or dvd, dial <br/>
800-505-6139; <br/>
for a transcript dial 818-848-6500. Some of my shows can be <br/>
purchased from Laissez <br/>
Faire Books 800/326-0996 or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.laissezfairebooks.com">http://www.laissezfairebooks.com</a> (I&#39;m <br/>
told that Laissez <br/>
Faire Books expedites the orders faster).<br/>
      Just as we had finished the Education show, we had to &quot;open it <br/>
up&quot; again <br/>
because Florida&#39;s Supreme Court ruled that public money can&#39;t be <br/>
spent on private <br/>
schools because the state constitution commands the funding only <br/>
of &quot;uniform <br/>
? high-quality&quot; schools. How absurd. As if government schools are <br/>
high quality. <br/>
In Florida, and most places, competition, which made even the Postal <br/>
Service <br/>
improve, is unconstitutional when it comes to public education.<br/>

======================================<br/>
<br/>
PS: Here is an interesting attack<br/>
on Stossel for his attack on public<br/>
schools in an earlier &quot;Give Me a Break&quot;<br/>
segment.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It shows the stretching the Public School<br/>
Establishment can do to parry all attacks<br/>
on it. Here is the beginning of this piece<br/>
Note it was done six years ago, about the<br/>
time I first met John and we had a nice<br/>
chat.<br/>
