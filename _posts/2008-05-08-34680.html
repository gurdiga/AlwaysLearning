<div id="ygrps-yiv-83309258">My dh recently found out he&#39;ll be traveling to New Mexico for work<br/>
(about 5 days). Neither of us have ever been in that part of the<br/>
country. Unfortunately, the kids and I can&#39;t go because of money and<br/>
social committments. :(  I know Sandra is from N.M. as are others on<br/>
this list. Could you give us any info on what to expect? What to do?<br/>
He&#39;ll be flying in to El Paso, TX and driving up to the White Sands<br/>
Missile Base.<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t about unschooling. Send me an email if that&#39;s more<br/>
appropriate.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

Katy Jennings lives in Alamogordo.  (Katy..., help!)<br/>
<br/>
Keith grew up in Alamogordo and his dad worked at White Sands.  He  <br/>
was the missile controller for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Keith asked if your husband is staying in El Paso.  He says though  <br/>
it&#39;s a temptation to visit Juarez, he recommends against it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just the scenery of the drive and a visit to White Sands will  <br/>
be enough.  Maybe co-workers could take him to a restaurant in  <br/>
Alamogordo or wherever.    The Rocket Museum/Space Cube in Alamogordo  <br/>
is good, but might be closed when he&#39;s not working.  It&#39;s easy to get  <br/>
to.   You can see it up on the hill to the right/east, when you&#39;re in  <br/>
Alamogordo, and you go on the highway until you come to the New  <br/>
Mexico School for the Blind, turn right and go until you&#39;re there.   <br/>
Indian Wells is the road.  There&#39;s a light.   http:// <br/>
www.nmspacemuseum.org/<br/>
<br/>
If he likes model trains, there&#39;s a small model trains museum in  <br/>
Alamogordo, on the main highway on the left/west, past the zoo.<br/>
<br/>
Tell him to drink lots of water (or whatever liquids he prefers).   <br/>
He&#39;ll be evaporating all the time even when he doesn&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
If, in a restaurant he&#39;s asked &quot;red or green?&quot; they&#39;re talking about  <br/>
chile.  Red is dried and ground up and made into a sauce.  Green is  <br/>
the vegetable, the chile, roasted and sliced or chopped or made into  <br/>
a sauce.  Same plant, two preparations.  Both hot.  Use the bread  <br/>
(tortilla or sopaipilla [so pah PEE ya) to defend from the heat.   <br/>
Honey can help.  Sweet drinks can help.  Water or hot coffee don&#39;t  <br/>
help at all.   Some people say &quot;Christmas&quot; meaning red and green  <br/>
together, but I think that&#39;s a waste; you miss the good taste of  <br/>
either.   Kinda like which wine to use with which food, too, here&#39;s a  <br/>
common thing:  pork/red, beef/red,  chicken/green   Breakfast/eggs,  <br/>
either.   &quot;Huevos Rancheros&quot; is red chile by default, but you can ask  <br/>
for green chile with just about anything, even a burger at McDonald&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
As to hamburgers, though, Blake&#39;s LotaBurger (a New Mexico chain) is  <br/>
great.  Their fries are wonderful.  There&#39;s one in Alamogordo and a  <br/>
couple or three in Las Cruces.<br/>

I grew up on Tex-Mex but over the years have been exposed to El Paso style<br/>

Oh!  Good point.  I always think of honey, because they usually have  <br/>
it on the table.  Sometimes if an enchilada or salsa is too hot, you  <br/>
can just put honey in it/on it.   But sour cream DEFINITELY helps,  <br/>
and if you&#39;re a milk-drinking person, yes.  That too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At Blake&#39;s or Mac&#39;s Steak-in-the-Rough (I don&#39;t think they have one  <br/>
of those in Alamogordo, though) or other burger places where milk  <br/>
shakes are available, that&#39;s another good possibility.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343581879">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;He&#39;ll be flying in to El Paso, TX and driving up to the White Sands Missile Base.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
About Southern New Mexico/El Paso:<br/>
<br/>
Water and sunglasses, water and sunglasses!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is dry and windy right now, and fire season is in full swing.  If he is a smoker make sure that he knows that it is NEVER ok to just throw a cigarette butt.  We have a big fire less than an hour away that is just now, after a week, getting under control, and a worse one up north.  Many of our devastating fires are caused by cigarettes.<br/>
<br/>
White Sands is crazy when it is windy.  Bring a light jacket or windbreaker.  The sand blows and can really pelt you.  It also gets all over everything.  He will see a layer of what looks like dust after only one day, it is most likely from White Sands.  (Not sand, by the way, it is Gypsum, a crystal formed at Lake Lucero (by the mountain) when the water evaporates.)  Sandra mentioned a drive through tour, if he has time it is worth it.  No place like it in the world.  It is illegal to take the sand, but it gets in your shoes and everywhere, I am sure that if he got out and walked in it a little would come home to the kids whether he likes it or not.  &lt;g&gt; It is easy to get disoriented in the dunes though, so be careful about walking too far from vehicles.  <br/>
<br/>
If he is going to be out at night, he may want a sweatshirt or a jacket.  It really does get cold in the desert at night especially if it is hot and clear during the day.  My son goes out to our local dirt race track (cars) on Friday nights, and I send him with a long-sleeve t-shirt under a regular t-shirt, a warm hat, and a warm coat.  Layering is good.  <br/>
<br/>
Tell him that it is important to always have with him water and sunglasses, and a hat if he is going to be outside at all.  The sunglasses are important, your eyes really can get burned, especially if you are not used to it.  And if he is going to be working outside, sunscreen!  Really, water and sunglasses.<br/>
<br/>
Is he staying in El Paso or on base?  I don&#39;t know much about the facilities on the base, I am sure that there are restaurants.  El Paso isn&#39;t bad, I would get a map or check out mapquest and stay near the highways.  I don&#39;t know where you are from, but we consider it a big city, and it has all of the big city stuff that we expect.    I would ask at the hotel about a good mexican restaurant nearby to try.  Tell him to be careful if he seems to be heading into Juarez, watch the highway signs.  Once you get going that direction there is really only one turnaround and lines to come back are LOOONG!  If he really wants to see it he can drive along the river on our side and look across.  Makes me feel thankful for all that I have.  <br/>
<br/>
If he makes it to Alamogordo, Margo&#39;s is a good mexican restaurant right off of the main road (highway turns into White Sands Blvd.), it is on First Street right in front of Wal-Mart.  Si Senor is pretty good too, it is on White Sands Blvd further north towards our little tiny mall, as is Blakes Lotaburger, which Sandra mentioned.  Both are just south of the School for the Blind, which you cannot miss, it is a huge green campus.  If he is a burger eater the green chile cheeseburger at Blakes is a must-try.  <br/>
<br/>
As was mentioned, if the chile is too hot sour cream is really a big help!  And tortillas.  You can also usually ask to have your chile on the side.  By the way, chile is not the same as chili!  Chile is a vegetable, chili is a spicy meat or meat and beans dish.  In many places the red chile will be hotter than the green, but that is not always true!  They have very different tastes, some love both, some are very particular about having one or the other.  I like both, but tend to lean towards green.  Huevos Rancheros is usually red, and is an awesome breakfast.  A trip to the southwest really isn&#39;t complete without at least trying the local cuisine.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a little rocket museum on the base at White Sands, one in Las Cruces (right on highway 70), and our bigger one in Alamogordo that Sandra mentioned.  If he is into that it is really worth a trip.  Then there is the little train museum on White Sands Blvd, a little petroglyph site about 30 minutes away, Friday night car racing, lots of nearby mountain activities, lots of places to hike,  we have a new nice movie theater... let me know if he will have time on his hands and I will send a longer list.  <br/>
<br/>
One more thing, driving in New Mexico is different than a lot of places.  We have long, deserted spaces between towns.  Make sure that he has extra water in the car, a fullish tank of gas, and we always take along a blanket.  It is only an hour from El Paso to Alamogordo, then less than a half hour to White Sands, but that is an hour plus of almost empty desert!  The highway is nice now though.    <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there are any questions that he has, I am kind of rambling!  I can give you/him my number too if you want.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and water and sunglasses!  Really!  By the time you notice that you are getting dehydrated you are REALLY dehydrated!  And a headache in the desert is a sure sign of dehydration.  Start drinking water early.  <br/>

Beans will probably be offered with most entrees.   Try the different<br/>
varieties.  Refried is easier for spreading on tortillas (or feeding<br/>
babies!),  black have a different taste that some prefer,  borracho can vary<br/>
from mild to extremely hot as can the amount and intensity of the liquid. In<br/>

Probably there will be no variety.  A formal table-cloth-restaurant  <br/>

ones) will have &quot;refried&quot; beans--traditionally the mushed-up leftover  <br/>

No. Probably not in El Paso either.  I googled it, porridge type breakfast made of left over tortillas.  <br/>

<br/>
I have had borracho beans, but not in New Mexico!   I had them at at restaurant in Colorado, and once in Las Vegas, NV.  Never seen them in New Mexico or El Paso.  Never heard of pot liquor, wikipedia says it is the liquid left over after cooking collard greens.  You definitely won&#39;t find those around here.  <br/>
<br/>
You are not likely to find much Tex-Mex around here, even in El Paso.  Or Spanish food for that matter.  Lots of Mexican food though, there is a difference!  <br/>
<br/>
The beans will almost exclusively be Pinto.  Whole or refried, most likely refried.  They (and the rice) are great for cutting the hotness of the chile on the entrée.    <br/>
<br/>
El Paso is a weird little piece of Texas, not like Houston or Dallas.  It is a little more &quot;southwestern,&quot; probably because it is a border town.  There are towns in New Mexico that are more &quot;Texas&quot; than El Paso is.  That is not to say that it doesn&#39;t have its Texas like traits, but it is different from most of the rest of Texas.  <br/>

leftover crispy corn tortillas (sometimes with soft corn tortillas cut in<br/>
strips).<br/>
I did not grow up with it and only learned about it after moving to central<br/>
Texas because a few friends prefer breakfast at whatever restaurants we have<br/>
found that have migas...............usually &quot;hole in the wall&quot; places.  My<br/>
introduction to migas came about after the last time I visited New Mexico so<br/>
my question was idle curiosity.  I decided to google too figuring it is<br/>
another of those very much &quot;varies by region&quot; thing.   The migas I know<br/>
about (sometimes called huevos con tortilla)  is a northern Mexico item,<br/>
whereas the porridge type is more central Mexico.  Even talked about a<br/>
Portuguese version using bread rather than any type tortilla. I imagine some<br/>
of the tex-mex versions will add chorizo or ground beef and more vegies and<br/>
cheese..................just like there are upscale versions of the lowly<br/>
but wonderful bread pudding or rice pudding that used to be a &quot;leftover&quot;<br/>
item.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>********Around here (central and south Texas, especially Austin/San Antonio<br/>
region)  borracho beans refers to the pinto beans cooked with lots of liquid<br/>
and sometimes added peppers,onions with or without beer added to the<br/>
liquid.  Used generically to distinguish between the smooth, pasty, drier<br/>
refried beans and the pintos that do better in a cup/bowl than on a plate<br/>
(unless served via slotted spoon) or any type of tortilla  for eating out of<br/>
hand. Supposedly the addition of beer is as much to aid flatulence reduction<br/>
as for flavor but that may have no scientific basis :-).<br/>
<br/>
 The pot liquor reference I just made up.........visualize what one can do<br/>
with the liquid from any cooking.  &quot;Pot Liquor&quot;  is a traditional southern<br/>
term....including Appalachia and parts of lower East Coast.    In my<br/>
childhood it came more often from turnip greens than collards but I have<br/>
encountered it referenced even from cooking field peas.   My uncles liked<br/>
their greens in a pile on their plate with the pot liquor in a separate bowl<br/>
for sopping with cornbread and then drinking what was left. I was always<br/>
told that the vitamins and nutrients from the greens leached  into  the pot<br/>
liquor so it shouldn&#39;t be thrown away.  I guess I was too quick to assume<br/>
just how much blending of culinary terms has occurred with population<br/>
mobility and the proliferation of small eating establishments &quot;everywhere&quot;.<br/>
Probably got led astray when I heard a reference to &quot;Tex-Mex&quot;  in a<br/>
television soap set in Hartford, Connecticut!  (Although when I called a<br/>
Hartford friend to ask about it, she said that indeed the term was<br/>
used....mostly for taco places.... but that I would probably not be<br/>
satisfied with any of the food obtained under that name).<br/>
<br/>
I figure if one gets pot liquor cooking fresh crowder peas with a few green<br/>
hulls thrown in, or even from green beans or pole beans,  that it isn&#39;t a<br/>
far stretch to call the liquid from pintos (especially if drunk from a cup)<br/>
the same thing :-).<br/>
<br/>
vicki<br/>
P.S.: I still elicit chuckles or frank stares from acquaintances when I ask<br/>
for &quot;light bread&quot;  or &quot;sweet milk&quot; or &quot;real&quot; ice cream or butter. And we<br/>
won&#39;t even mention what &quot;regular&quot;  coffee means. Or &quot;barbecue&quot;<br/>
:-)..........now there is a topic for variety in seasoning, texture, cut of<br/>
meat!<br/>

details could vary depending on who is talking in what environment.<br/>
It&#39;s a good question.  In my extended family light bread usually meant<br/>
storebought sliced white bread.   Definitely not biscuits although  it was<br/>
ok to substitute stale light bread for biscuits in  the cornbread dressing<br/>
(I never heard of  &quot;stuffing&quot;  until  I  went  up north).   I think that<br/>
dinner rolls or especially yeast rolls &quot;could&quot; be called light bread but we<br/>
typically would say &quot;hot rolls&quot;.   Storebought  sliced wheat or whole wheat<br/>
bread was &quot;brown bread&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and &quot;pancakes&quot; was something I never had until IHOP came around after I<br/>
was in high school.   I grew up on &quot;hot cakes&quot;  even when we went to a<br/>
diner.    I had forgotten about &quot;sweet corn&quot;  as opposed to field corn.<br/>
My paternal grandmother made the most wonderful creamed corn that she<br/>
started by slicing kernels from the cobs.   I&#39;ve never tasted anything like<br/>
it since she passed away.   Nor been able to duplicate her fried apricot<br/>
pies.   I liked my mother&#39;s corn bread (cooked in a cast iron skillet on<br/>
stovetop and never put in oven at all) better than my aunts or<br/>
grandmother&#39;s.   Even after I inherited her skillet and heavy lid (with the<br/>
handle long gone) I never could duplicate that cornbread :-(.   My cousins<br/>
quest with me trying to figure out the secret!<br/>

could cook 3 at a time in a large skillet (or for a few years we had a stove<br/>
with a built in griddle between the burners).    When I was 7 or 8 I made my<br/>
first foray out of state.........staying at Platte National Park in<br/>
Oklahoma.   Somewhere along the way, not sure if it was on Oklahoma side or<br/>
Texas side, we stopped at a diner for breakfast.   I didn&#39;t believe the<br/>
waitress when she said probably no one would want more than a &quot;short stack&quot;<br/>
because they were &quot;big&quot;.   When they arrived, MY opinion was that they<br/>
&quot;should&quot; have offered a single instead of even a short stack.  These were<br/>
gigantic.........went all the way to the edge of full sized dinner plates<br/>
and were probably 3/4 inch thick.   I prefer smaller and thinner and maybe<br/>
even a little &quot;crusty&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We used Karo syrup or sometimes sorghum (&quot;real&quot; maple syrup was a delicacy I<br/>
didn&#39;t taste until college) and the grownups sometimes used cane syrup but I<br/>
never developed a taste for that.  A  friend who grew up outside Ft. Worth<br/>
has fond memories of her grandma making &quot;golden sugar syrup&quot;  without<br/>
scorching it and without it becoming brittle.  I&#39;m thinking that may be<br/>
similar to the sauce on flan and keep meaning to try it.    &quot;Melting&quot; sugar<br/>
still seems magical to me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489775537">In my childhood what made it &quot;real&quot; was having a base of higher butterfat<br/>
milk and at least some actual cream.   That was in the days of &quot;mellorine&quot;<br/>
or &quot;ice milk&quot; or tubs of economy ice cream, which my parents bought for<br/>
economic reasons.    My aunt would refer to a few specific brands as being<br/>
real ice cream.........those are probably forerunners to what is considered<br/>
premium ice cream today.   More natural ingredients, more cream.   She made<br/>
pretty nice homemade ice cream too and that was certainly &quot;real&quot; :-).<br/>
<br/>
Soft serve ice cream?  Reminds me of an old joke about the list of<br/>
ingredients on Banquet coconut cream pie....................no coconut, no<br/>
cream, just pie.<br/>

OH!  My friend  Helena went to a campout of several families when she  <br/>
was living in England (she&#39;s from New Mexico) and for breakfast she  <br/>
made pancakes.  She said everyone around got really excited about it  <br/>
so she made more and they were surprised she would cook something  <br/>
like that outside.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they were surprised she would cook something like that at all! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
