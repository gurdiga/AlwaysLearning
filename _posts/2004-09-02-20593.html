<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023174734">What does right wing religious conservatism have to do with <br/>
racism?<br/>

8,000&gt; attendees and they&#39;re &gt; basically right-wing Christian revivals?<br/>

If you&#39;ve found some who aren&#39;t racist and you&#39;re happy with that, good for <br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known many (and was related to some) who justified their racism <br/>
biblically.<br/>
<br/>
But here we are on the edge of not even KIND of talking about unschooling, <br/>
so if your question was honest, go to google and put in some of those words <br/>
andread.  And if it was more a challenge to me, or sarcasm, it&#39;s not worth <br/>
pursuing.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe I just haven&#39;t thought much, or maybe I&#39;m just not very smart.<br/>
Investigation and humor are just no fun for some people, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Living lightly and curiously are good unschooling attributes.<br/>
I&#39;m willing to be wrong, but I prefer evidence or counter-ideas to simple <br/>
insult.<br/>
&quot;Oh huh&quot; doesn&#39;t cut it for me, in philosophical or historical discussions.<br/>
<br/>
The conference was good.   Over 550 unschoolers--men, women and children.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t my imagination.  <br/>

<br/>
Oh this reminds me of a sitcom I saw years ago...it was like &quot;Roseanne&quot;, but<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was &quot;Roseanne&quot;. The star was a free thinking happy person,<br/>
but her sister was an uptight religious misery who, in one episode was<br/>
explaining how it was necessary to say &quot;Bless her heart&quot; when you were<br/>
saying something mean and cruel about someone, justified or not. That<br/>
charming statement just made it all OK to be as judgmental and nasty and<br/>
hypocritical as you liked. All this time I thought it was the humorous<br/>
construct of a script writer.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, justifiably, simply doesn&#39;t like people who actively promote the use<br/>
sticks and whips to hit kids, including in the name of any religion,<br/>
regardless of their ethnic background. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, you&#39;ve misunderstood the concept of &quot;strewing&quot;, which is putting out<br/>
things that might actually be *interesting* to people. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657041946">I just had to reply to this. You are aware it says to Stone your<br/>
rebellious children as well in the bible.Hmm I wonder why we dont do<br/>
that anymore? If you dont believe me look in Deut.21 Of course Im sure<br/>
someone will say that is not what it really means...Well spanking<br/>
children with rods should have gone out with stoning your kids..You do<br/>
realize the quote about Sparing the rod is in Proverbs written by a guy<br/>
with something like 500 wifes and concubines(mistresses),,,Sheesh can<br/>
you imagine how many kids he had, bet he didnt spend much individual<br/>
time with each of them and I bet the only way to keep them in line was<br/>
to beat the sh*t out off them.Sorry for the tangent. I have issues when<br/>
it comes to religion having spent way too much of my life confind in<br/>
that nonsense...<br/>
