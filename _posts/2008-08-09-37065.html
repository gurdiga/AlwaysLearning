<div id="ygrps-yiv-790811396">As I&#39;m sitting here exploring on the computer I realize that one thing I like about homeschooling / unschooling / my son is that not many 14 year old boys would sit and watch Disney&#39;s Pocahontas - all because he was flipping channels and chose to watch it.<br/>

So far we&#39;ve discussed the non-authentic clothing of the Native Americans in the movie - we looked that up on the internet.

 were making chocolate daleks with a bunch of girls ranging from 6 up <br/>

all the advantages of it, I am just scared to actually &#39;let go&#39; and do it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995227450">For some reason he got caught up in watching old Disney movies the past few days - the animated ones.  They were on TV and he was just having a really great time.  Robin Hood has some really funny scenes; Hercules too.  These were funny and entertaining for us and yet they led to many more connections throughout the day & spilling into more days too.  He even wanted to know when they were made so he could discuss/analyze how time periods effected things like dance scenes, jokes, political correctness/acceptance of the time, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hercules led to his reviving a computer game he likes called Age Of Mythology and dragging out his mythology books.<br/>
Then he told me yesterday he was glad he decided to play Mythology again because now he knows how to spell &quot;Trojan&quot;.  This moment of joy and confidence for a child that flunked every spelling test in first, second, and third grade because he could not write fast enough to keep up with the teacher as she gave out the words for the test - so then he decided he could not spell ;(  was so simple in the making - all on his own by playing a game he likes.  Which started with a TV movie.  Well I say all on his own - his dad and I have spent countless hours sitting next to him and spelling for him when he asks us to spell a word so he could play games, and do searches on the internet.  <br/>
<br/>
We are enjoying &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; as a family too.  Actually there are several &quot;old&quot; shows we are enjoying together on an ongoing basis, Hogan&#39;s Hero&#39;s and MASH are two more.  Plus we&#39;ve always enjoyed the Loony Tunes cartoons.  Loony Tunes is how he was exposed to (learned about) opera and grand classic piano concerts when he was very young.<br/>

Holly (my youngest) is 16.  Kirby (my oldest) is 22.  She went with  <br/>
him to Texas for a few days last month.  When she got back she asked  <br/>
me if I knew a certain song, and sang a little of it.  I said yes.   <br/>
She asked if I had it and would I put it on a CD for her.  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
  She heard it in Kirby&#39;s car, and he told her it was one of his  <br/>
favorite songs.<br/>
<br/>
It was a Kermit the Frog song, done by Jim Henson.  It was on a  <br/>
cassette tape Kirby loved when he was little, and then years later I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it on CD and a very nice unschooling mom (Chris/zamozo)  <br/>
sent me a copy of hers.   I put it on my computer and went about my  <br/>
happy life.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t press Holly to listen to it.  She has her own busy, happy life.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to get the lyrics I found them, and more.  I didn&#39;t find  <br/>
the composer, but when I know I&#39;ll add it here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com/2008/08/all-i-have-to-do.html">http://biochemicallove.blogspot.com/2008/08/all-i-have-to-do.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
STUNNINGLY, I was able to *easily* embed the song, and I already had  <br/>
a place to put it.  I have a blog called<br/>
<br/>
LOVE: ROMANTIC BIOCHEMISTRY<br/>
LYRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES KNOWN AS &quot;BEING IN  <br/>
LOVE,&quot; AND SIMILAR BUSINESS<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to see the lyrics and even hear the song Holly loved  <br/>
so much from Kirby&#39;s iPod... there it is.<br/>

Marty used to play a game called Alliance of Nations (AON) which was  <br/>
all chat-room and IM based, on AOL.  It was elaborate and lasted a  <br/>
long time (might still be going).  It was an interactive role-playing  <br/>
thing with unlimited opportunities for others to join in, and it was  <br/>
well organized, and Kirby and Marty were both fairly advanced in the  <br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
Marty could hardly spell, though.  So he would call out &quot;How do you  <br/>
spell [something]&quot; and someone would call it back out to thim, me or  <br/>
Keith or Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
One night he kept playing after others were asleep or gone, and he  <br/>
said the next day that one of the other players had said kinda  <br/>
hatefully &quot;Dude, you write like a 10yo&quot; and Marty wrote &quot;I AM a  <br/>
10yo.&quot;  I wish Marty had kept the script of it, but I am reporting  <br/>
from memory from years ago, so it might not be letter for letter, or  <br/>
even the right age.  But Marty read at 9 so I&#39;m thinking it was  <br/>
probably 10.  (I have a very hard time remembering numbers.)<br/>
<br/>
His age had just never begun to show before that. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309745986">Zoe (10) started playing World of Warcraft last month.  She shouts  <br/>
out for help with spelling words a lot.  She recently started her own  <br/>
guild and has a great time recruiting members and fostering a  <br/>
cooperative and positive theme for her guild.  She told me that her  <br/>
guild is about the more experienced helping the less experienced.  I  <br/>
understand there&#39;s a lot of that in WoW.  She structured her guild  <br/>
based on her favorite book series, Warriors, about wild cat clans.   <br/>
She is the leader and then she has deputies, warriors and  <br/>
apprentices.  She spends a lot of time chatting with her guild  <br/>
members when she&#39;s online -- encouraging them, inquiring about their  <br/>
day-to-day activities that they&#39;ve shared.  I talked to her about the  <br/>
concept of paying it forward and suggested that that phrase might be  <br/>
an efficient way for her to communicate her idea about how the guild  <br/>
should function.  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll use it but she does like to  <br/>
come up with positive, encouraging  guild messages of the day.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about not sharing personal information online even when  <br/>
it feels like you know the other player well. I wonder how many of  <br/>
her guild members would be surprised to find she&#39;s only 10 years old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828930912">All day long when my son is playing Roblox on line I am called to read or write things for him.<br/>
He can read some and write some , he just turned six. He says he cannot read because for him reading is when you can read all.<br/>
I told him that you learn a little all the time.<br/>
He loves to &quot;talk&quot;to other kids on line.<br/>
At Roblox he has made a few games and once he got a message that I am going to paste  and copy here: ( he was still 5 at the time)<br/>
This is what his profile says ( it said 5 before instead of 6 years old):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hi I am Mario and I am 6 years old. I will accept any friends request and I will help many people here on Roblox . I am a Super Mario fan and I have almost all of Mario&#39;s games on my Nintendo DS and Wii. I will have Mario Sunshine soon and keep on visiting my games so I can build it. Please everyone keep visiting all my 3 games so I can make a Mario Sunshine soon I will have all of the Mario games built. I will also have a Super Mario Galaxy that is cute and fun&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
He dictate that for me to write when he first got into Roblox.<br/>
Ok so he got a message that said:ok seriously are u lying? cus if ur 5 years old then ur like a genius <br/>
 <br/>
and this is what followed:<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713864068">Looking at the wikipedia article on &quot;genius&quot;, her comment that you are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076166927">I think one of the discouragements for me with school is the constant rule<br/>
working at all times to limit students who like to move through things they<br/>
don&#39;t understand just for experience and to see what they can gather on the<br/>
off-chance.  That way global learning yields new ideas.  For the most part,<br/>
school is much more deliberate, step-oriented (regimented) and managed than<br/>
that.  After a while, all the students get accustomed to living slow and<br/>
waiting around, so that if --one day-- an offer comes to fly through freely<br/>
and have fun with ideas, most kids don&#39;t have the skills to do it, even the<br/>
ones who naturally gravitate to zooming around with ideas.  It&#39;s been worked<br/>
out of them.... at least for the time being ... and translates to a loss of<br/>
confidence.  That&#39;s why a kid who hasn&#39;t been waiting and slowed down and<br/>
losing confidence is overwhelming to the school kids.<br/>
<br/>
We know that because of our own kids if they&#39;ve been unschooled for any<br/>
length of time.<br/>
<br/>
Like you say, it *is* possible to move through and thrive in school while in<br/>
your own dreamworld and ignore the dynamics of a certain amount of school<br/>
stuff.  To a degree I could hide in the world of books, but I needed more<br/>
than that to really thrive.  At home, music was very much restricted as were<br/>
&quot;certain&quot; TV shows and movies.  We lived in the boondocks so socially...<br/>
forget about it.<br/>
<br/>
It *is* good to know that not everybody can &quot;swim&quot; so be careful not<br/>
to &quot;splash water in their faces or dunk &#39;em underwater.&quot;  There are just<br/>
naturally all kinds of levels in any given situation, and bumping people<br/>
around conversationally is a risk.<br/>
<br/>
The unintended effect of telling students who zoom through to tone down is<br/>
to strike fear into the hearts of those who might otherwise be encouraged to<br/>
try zooming around too.  School can&#39;t accommodate much chaos, noising about<br/>
or motion.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unmanageable.  Homeschoolers can embrace a few more levels of chaos<br/>
without falling apart.  Unlike school, consideration to others takes the<br/>
place of the school intolerance for what looks like chaos.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also worth nothing that chaos is not a set of objective facts.... it&#39;s<br/>
a perception of what someone considers to be chaotic, which in the mind of<br/>
one person is one thing, and in the mind of another is an entirely different<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Well.. I went on longer about this than I intended but there it is.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lately, Chamille has been running into age restrictions for things that<br/>
she really really wants to do and is fully capable of doing.  It&#39;s hard,<br/>
she&#39;s 14 and really is so much more capable than the average 14 yo. <br/>
We&#39;ve seriously considered lying about her age.  I&#39;m not sure yet if we<br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
What she wants to do, she has to be 16 to do.  If she waits until she&#39;s<br/>
16, she may have lost the interest.  That would be a shame, because<br/>
she&#39;s passionate and capable now, but that could change if it&#39;s<br/>
thwarted.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really tough to have to wait simply because of an age requirement. <br/>
In general, our attitude is to find a way to do it, to empower our kids<br/>
to do what they want.  This one issue keeps coming up.  Years ago, it<br/>
was that she had to wait until she was 14 to do some thing or another,<br/>
and now at 14, she&#39;s moved on to other things.  She was fully capable at<br/>
the age of 12 to do the things that had the 14 yr age requirement.<br/>
<br/>
So this time, we are seriously considering saying that she is older than<br/>
what she is.  Nobody would ever notice, she looks and acts much older<br/>
than what she is.  We both still think it a bit unethical, and are<br/>
trying other ways first.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; losing confidence is overwhelming to the school kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That makes a lot of sense to me!  I do see many kids afraid to step out<br/>
and step up.  I don&#39;t see that in my own kids.  They aren&#39;t afraid of<br/>
their own self knowledge or finding answers in creative ways or<br/>
unconventional ways.<br/>
<br/>
To add to that dynamic, there is a &quot;one up you&quot; mentality involved.  It<br/>
seems a lot of kids want the right answer and the pat on the back and<br/>
will lie and cheat and try to stand out in other ways to get that<br/>
attention.  It&#39;s very competitive.  We were at the zoo yesterday and<br/>
there were a lot of summer camp and daycare programs with school kids<br/>
there.  We saw it all around us the whole time we were there.<br/>
<br/>
Kids pushing and shoving to get there first, to get the answer first, to<br/>
see it better without any regard for their neighbor or others around<br/>
them, or for the actual knowledge.  How hard it must be for kids like<br/>
that, so desperate for that, to have a kid in the midst who gets it with<br/>
ease and confidence without having to do that all the pushing and<br/>
shoving and clamboring to the top.<br/>
<br/>
I love kids.  I can see the beauty in every kid, but that aspect is<br/>
really hard to get around.  To me, it is ugly making behavior, one that<br/>
I don&#39;t see my kids doing, even in the midst of competition, they are<br/>
gracious and kind.  It is really hard for me to see an otherwise smart<br/>
and sweet child pushing themselves into that &quot;one up you&quot; role.  Some<br/>
kids don&#39;t do it, they don&#39;t play the game, and they get ignored and<br/>
miss out on turns.  It&#39;s a yucky dynamic that schools foster!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah... now that&#39;s something different from chaos control.  In school, I was a<br/>
kid who hung in the back.<br/>
<br/>
Competition is an all or nothing deal... some win and everybody else loses.<br/>
Creativity isn&#39;t addressed much in that.  And to me, that&#39;s chaotic.... that<br/>
competition at school, work and many areas of our lives centers around the<br/>
&quot;one up&quot; thought.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to.  I have learned more through challenging myself to reach<br/>
higher than from any externally applied competitive pool of play or school<br/>
life.  It&#39;s possible to compete with your past &quot;levels&quot; rather than with<br/>
other people.  Mentally you can do that even if you are playing with others<br/>
in a competitive game.  It makes it way more fun... realizing that the real<br/>
competitor you&#39;re playing against is yourself not other people.  Because if<br/>
you can keep expanding past previous levels and attain more knowledge<br/>
through such challenges to yourself, then you can continue to play for a lot<br/>
longer with happier motivation.  Of course, many people never understand<br/>
that point and they may be happier with the idea of beating others out than<br/>
challenging themselves.  The problem with that only occurs if you lose and<br/>
others win, where does it leave you?  One down.  In challenging yourself,<br/>
you&#39;re never really in the one down position but always winning.<br/>

Yeah I would not go that route either. There is always a way that does not involve lying.<br/>
What are the things she wants to do that she needs to be older. Maybe someone here can help find solutions.<br/>
I also started doing things very early when was a professional dog handler at 14 years old.<br/>

that it cam become generalized to other areas of her life.  It is a form of<br/>
over-indulgence that has been studied to show that children who are indulged<br/>

the duration of the class, possibly leading to more lies as she tries to<br/>

<br/>
My husband runs a survival school, and he often gets requests from parents<br/>
to allow their 16 year olds into the class.  He works with them - and will<br/>
often allow it if the parent attends as well.<br/>
<br/>
A really important lesson for children is not to CHEAT the system but CHANGE<br/>
the system, or CREATE a new system.  If that is not possible, then learn to<br/>
live with the frustration and focus on other legitimate goals.<br/>
<br/>
I know you said you were looking for alternatives, so I just wanted to weigh<br/>

I do feel it is unethical to lie about ones age.  We&#39;ve discussed this<br/>
thoroughly together.  She never lies about her age in any other area,<br/>

thoughtful unschooled child making a calculating decision.  I have a<br/>
hard time with the concept in general that children are ever indulged<br/>
with priviledges they don&#39;t deserve.  My children deserve all the<br/>
priviledges that I can give them, really!  All children deserve<br/>
priviledges, especially highly controlled by adult ones.  This is<br/>
something that we really try to avoid at all costs through unschooling,<br/>
controlling priviledges.   What makes someone deserving of priviledge<br/>
and not others?  I&#39;m not sure I agree with this line of thought at all!<br/>

theoretical, I&#39;m talking about making a concious choice to do something<br/>
while fully aware of consequences.  Chamille and I have not agreed to<br/>
actually lie about her age.  It is something that we&#39;ve considered as a<br/>
way of working around arbritrary rules, among other brainstorming ideas.<br/>
Lying about her age isn&#39;t going to turn her into a criminal, or even<br/>
cause her to shoulder a heavy burden.  It&#39;s just one of many many ways<br/>
around a hurdle to get what she wants.<br/>

rather just get involved in the actual doing of what you want to do. <br/>
I&#39;ve created my own systems before, and tried to change existing ones. <br/>
However that is not where my daughters talents lie (no pun intended<br/>
there).  This aspect of life frustrates her.  She doesn&#39;t want to change<br/>
or recreate everything, she just wants opportunity that is fair and<br/>
equitable.  Unfortunately for her, our culture in general looks down on<br/>
children and the abilities they possess.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve found a way without having to lie about her age.  It took a lot of<br/>
time on my part, but we did it.</div>

She wants to be involved in theater, but not as a diva.  She wants to do<br/>
costuming and make-up.  There are theater classes, a dime a dozen for<br/>
acting, but really none for what she wants to do unless you go in<br/>
sideways through community theater volunteer.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically she wants to do the haunted houses for halloween. <br/>
Every time we went to the volunteer webpages for the dozens of these in<br/>
the area they required an age of 16.  We found one that didn&#39;t have a<br/>
requirement in print and sent out the form.  We got an okay from them in<br/>
an odd way because we couldn&#39;t get the form to process correctly so I<br/>
had to contact someone personally and through the exchange I explained<br/>
our situation and it was okayed, with me being a chaperone.  If this<br/>
fluke of fate hadn&#39;t happened she wouldn&#39;t have been given a chance at<br/>
all simply because of her age, they would&#39;ve tossed the form outright<br/>
because it turns out they do have an age restriction, just an unposted<br/>
one.</div>

I really liked this, Sandra. J Thank you for writing it. (I love your<br/>
website by the way. It�s just so much fun to read and I�ve gotten so much<br/>
out of it!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think I�ve been lurking on this group. I am new to unschooling. We just<br/>
made the decision to home school a week and a half ago. Since then I have<br/>
been devouring everyone�s blogs and posts. It just makes so much sense to<br/>
me. Thank you to everyone who posts on here. You�ve really helped me<br/>
articulate what I want for my children, what I think will add more value to<br/>
their lives, and what I think they deserve. I wish I could meet you all at<br/>
the conference in a couple weeks, I just couldn�t afford it this year<br/>
(single mom, grad student, basically indigent). But, hopefully we�ll be<br/>
there next time! J<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I thought I would add that my children, though we are technically living<br/>
below the poverty level :), have wonderful grandparents and extended family<br/>
members who provide them with EVERYTHING! They have so much stuff, it<br/>
literally looks like someone emptied a truck at our front door that was<br/>
supposed to fill a toy store. My kids don�t really know we (appear to) live<br/>
way out of our means. To keep living expenses down, we live out of the city<br/>
and share our house with another single mom and her two daughters. There is<br/>
a big difference in our children, even though they have access to all the<br/>
same stuff. I think that stuff is not what gives kids bad attitudes, rather<br/>
it is the treatment they get from their parents. A lot of parents would<br/>
rather buy a kid a toy than play with them. But, I�ve never personally seen<br/>
a �spoiled� child who was truly listened to, respected, and cared for,<br/>
regardless of how much stuff they had. And being someone who researches<br/>
behavior for a living, I would be very interested to see convincing data<br/>
(not just anecdotal evidence) otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, as always, for such interesting brain food. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799192505">I suppose it could be seen as an &quot;unhealthy precedent&quot;  -- even literally<br/>
--  back in the day to hide Jews during Nazi raids or escaped African slaves<br/>
here in the US.  People could be and were easily implicated, imprisoned and<br/>
even lost lives by taking such crazy risks but of course the risk takers&#39;<br/>
motives were ethical.  It was not simply about creating new systems or<br/>
changing the current system.<br/>
<br/>
By comparison what we&#39;re talking about is not so crazy ... bending rules.<br/>
People who really believe children deserve privileges are taking a risk to<br/>
slip them into age groups that are barred to them, but hopefully it&#39;s with<br/>
the considered research, decision-making and permission of parents.  After<br/>
all, people under 18 are defined as legally underage in the US, and parents<br/>
are legally held responsible.  That&#39;s the reason for the checkmark.  And it<br/>
isn&#39;t enough.  The computer and that checkmark don&#39;t do anything but get<br/>
clicked, so it&#39;s all unenforceable baloney, legalese and pablum.<br/>
<br/>
I like what I&#39;m hearing in this thread from unschoolers.  Parents are<br/>
negotiating and facilitating a passageway where they feel that their<br/>
children are barred unnecessarily.  Amazingly their children trust them<br/>
enough to ask in the first place.  To my mind, this takes a lot of lead out<br/>
of the risk for these children because everyone is sharing information:<br/>
children with parents and parents with children.  They&#39;re making decisions<br/>
together.  Nobody&#39;s flying solo or taking a big ugly risk.  On the other<br/>
hand, I rarely expected my parents to go to bat for me, and if it was the<br/>
internet and I could gain access without them knowing I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have troubled to ask.  Here&#39;s hoping I would have been savvy enough not to<br/>
trust a complete stranger over the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, one more thing!  There are 18 year olds so sheltered that they are<br/>
no better off than a 7 year old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785396110">I think lying is very bad.  I think setting precedents that lying is  <br/>
okay is bad, in general.  I also think that when a child and parent  <br/>
together decide to say &quot;Okay&quot; about something like agreeing to a  <br/>
photo-storage site, or MySpace, or a game, that it&#39;s NOTHING on earth  <br/>
like a child lying behind her parents&#39; back to get into a bar, or a  <br/>
parent lying to a child in ways that erode faith and trust.<br/>
<br/>
If I were organizing a class or workshop (as I have done) and I had  <br/>
an age cut-off or recommendation (as I&#39;ve done a few times, but not  <br/>
often), I would NOT appreciate anyone lying to get around it, or  <br/>
ignoring it.  I wouldn&#39;t mind someone requesting an exception, if  <br/>
they were willing to take no for an answer.<br/>
<br/>
What makes more sense to me is to explain what it is about the age:   <br/>
maybe the person needs to be able to read, or to read music, or to  <br/>
get into a place where you have to be 21, or maybe the site owner  <br/>
doesn&#39;t let people under 18 be there without signed waivers from  <br/>
parents or whatever all.  Sometimes there are real conditions, and  <br/>
those shouldn&#39;t be lied about.<br/>
