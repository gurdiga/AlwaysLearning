<div id="ygrps-yiv-954578174">I am sorry.  I wrote the THN part first and then went to the top<br/>
of the page and wrote about the chinese ideograms.  When I<br/>
finished it, I thought that the posting were done.<br/>

U. 6yo came on her wheelchair. Close to the end of the event, I<br/>
told her father that I was reading Dalai Lama and C. &quot;The way to<br/>
Happiness&quot; and that I finally understood what compassion was and<br/>
how to develop it.  I was looking for this understanding since<br/>

He mentioned that there must be a reason for the handicapped to<br/>
be born. I also told him that I think that just the presence per<br/>

The 17 of us shared the 40 m square.  There we cooked, bathed and<br/>
sleeped.  The space was smaller than my mother&#39;s living room in<br/>
brazil but of the same size of our apartment here in Japan.  This<br/>
place is available for group for a fee of US$ 10.00 per person.<br/>
for US20.00 per person, we had dinner, breakfast, tea, coffee,<br/>
and a sleeping place.  The children played at the park.<br/>

love and peace</div>
