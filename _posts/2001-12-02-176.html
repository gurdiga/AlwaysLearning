<div id="ygrps-yiv-411985982">Sandra and Pam,<br/>
Thanks for sharing the info about the golden rule.  As a non-Christian I am constantly trying to offer bits of information to my children to let them know of the many beliefs in the world, both past and present.  We talk when the subject comes up about the validity of everyone&#39;s belief system and that no belief is right or wrong if you feel it in your heart.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, can you list the titles of books you use for comparative religion?  I think you said they were Usborne or DK books?  We read picture books together of stories of the Bible or Chanukah or ancient Indian myths and tales of old that show how different people believe different yet similar things.  Can anyone recommend other books....my kids are 9 and 5.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a book called &quot;The Story Of Religion&quot; by Betsy and Giulio Maestro <br/>
that I really like. It&#39;s a small (45 pages) book, with nice illustrations, <br/>
aimed at kids. It&#39;s starts with the beginnings of rituals and religious <br/>
beliefs as far back as cave men and moves through explanations of the major <br/>
religions. It also makes mention of lots of the minor ones. It talks about <br/>
their similarities and differences. It ends with this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is no one way to seek God-no one way to look at the world.There are <br/>
countless paths to Enlightenment, Truth, Paradise, and Heaven, and there are <br/>
many ways to worship. Some people believe that their ways and ideas are the <br/>
only right ones. But intolerance has only led to tragedy-to religious <br/>
persecution and violence throughout human history.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that in this world there are so many people following so many <br/>
different paths to God shows that there is no one right way. What is right <br/>
for one person may not be right for another. Learning about the beliefs of <br/>
others helps people to understand and respect one another. Appreciating <br/>
their similarities and their differences helps people to learn tolerance. <br/>
Then people can truly be neighbors, living in harmony, each group in its own <br/>
way-living every day by the Golden Rule.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108616252">My kids who haven&#39;t experienced a death of a loved one<br/>
they know yet seem to like When Dinosaurs Die by Mark<br/>
Brown (original creator/author of Aurthur books) It&#39;s<br/>
not about Dinosaurs at all. It talks about all the<br/>
ways people die it even goes into suicide. At the end<br/>
it has ideas how to process/remember someone you love.<br/>

In January, Usborne is issuing a new book , Replacing World Religions - the <br/>
Encyclopedia of World Religions.  From the publisher:<br/>
<br/>
This thought-provoking book offers a balanced expploration of the beliefs, <br/>
history and customs of all the major world religions, as well as many lesser <br/>
known faiths, past and present.  Spiritually inspiring photographs and <br/>
illustrations, as well as inormative maps and a time chart, will help you to <br/>
gain a better understanding of:<br/>
    * What people of different faiths believe<br/>
    * Where and how people worship<br/>
    * The impact of religion in society<br/>
    * Rites of passage, customs and festivals<br/>
