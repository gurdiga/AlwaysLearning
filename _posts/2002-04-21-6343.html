<div id="ygrps-yiv-45775345">I would *love* to come to the conference and I&#39;m working on it. I&#39;m not too<br/>
worried about 11 yo ds; he&#39;d find plenty to do. But what about 6 yo dd? Any<br/>
programs for the younger ones? I know I could have her sit with me and bring<br/>
books, etc, but she&#39;d get antsy with talks all day. Plan B is grandparents,<br/>
which would mean I&#39;d drive :p .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As the conference coordinator, I have a 14 year old and a 6 year old. I know <br/>
FOR sure those two ages will be well-represented! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funshops and activities are non-age-discriminatory---all ages may participate <br/>
in any activity, although some may be more age-appropriate than others.<br/>
<br/>
If she has any particular interests, send them to me---I&#39;m very open to <br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Right now (---tentatively, as the contracts aren&#39;t all in!), we have 2 <br/>
storytellers (one&#39;s a native American and makes all sorts of things with <br/>
kudzu!, the other&#39;s a Mother Goose freak), bead-working, legos, costume <br/>
closet, felting, many card/board games, puppeteers (marrionettes), magicians, <br/>
scrapbooking, bookmaking, origami, drumming, ecology lab (she might bring <br/>
baby alligators!), a mime, and a leadership/cooperative organization. <br/>
<br/>
My six year old is trying to talk me into a space walk tent. We&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll <br/>
be looking into the gaming store---and my 14 year old wants a skateboarding <br/>
funshop (?!). I&#39;m adding more every day as people get in touch with me.<br/>
<br/>
Keep ideas coming!<br/>
