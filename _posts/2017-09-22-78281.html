<div id="ygrps-yiv-955835265">I quoted Ronnie Maier on Just Add Light yesterday, and she had mentioned unschooling.com.  I noted that it was great, but gone.  Someone went to look for it in archives, and found the second, later version, which wasn’t nearly as good, and wasn’t what Ronnie was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
So for the benefit of anyone who’s out of reading material and wants to see some twelve year old (and older) stuff, here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Here’s the Just Add Light and Stir post, with a link to the rest of what Ronnie had written, too.<br/>

This is all incidental, but might be useful to some.<br/>
