<div id="ygrps-yiv-779505161">Perfect connections!!!!  I&#39;m glad this is coming up because there was a situation the other day where three kiddos where in the closet playing Truth or Dare.  Sorscha was not one of them but this situation has got me thinking for several days now.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The kids were kissing.  It did not concern / bother (not sure if either of those words is what I am feeling but the best choice I can come up with because Sorscha wants me to come play) that the two 6-year-olds (1 boy /1 girl) were experimenting.  What concerned (again lack of a better word because I&#39;m typing quickly) me was that one of the children was 10 (boy) and the parent describes him as very sexual (which does not bother me) but with two 6-year-olds it does.   Why does this bother me?  Should it?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Again, Sorscha was not involved but it has got me thinking about how I would feel if it had been Sorscha (age 9) with someone who was 13 or 14.  I&#39;m feeling like I would be very uncomfortable with a very sexual child who was older (at this stage in life) kissing Sorscha.  It seems inappropriate to me and I&#39;m not sure if I am just conjuring up feelings from my childhood or if this is a legitimate concern.  I&#39;d rather face the emotions I&#39;m having now even though this might never happen.  Sorscha is not sexual at all.  She does not think anything of boys or girls as other than friends.  She has never said, &quot;Hey so and so&#39;s hot.&quot;  As she is getting older, more and more boys are falling for her and she is completely oblivious.  Currently there are four boys who are enamored with my booger faced, rats-nest hair, up until Thursday food filled braces daughter.  Heehee. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sorscha and I are very open with our &#39;sex talk&#39;.  In fact, she told me the other day that she did not want me to kiss her without her permission.  I told her she had every right to decide whom she wanted to kiss her or not.  Therefore, I think that if a situation like this came about that I have complete faith in her to make a reasonable decision for her self.  But then I&#39;m having those mommy feelings that a child that much older and who is &#39;highly sexual&#39; would be taking advantage of a smaller child.  Then I had another very traditional parenting friend say to me, &quot;Well, if she has complete freedom over her own body, are you okay if she wanted to have sex?&quot;  Sooo, this whole situation has sparked a beautiful avalanche of thoughts in my head.  I do not want to project any of my &#39;junk&#39; onto Sorscha so I think that it is great that this situation came up because it has really got me thinking and hopefully I can organize my thoughts and feelings for the &#39;maybe&#39; or &#39;maybe not&#39; future. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to your ponderings based on being RUers.  <br/>
<br/>
Seriously need to go play! <br/>
<br/>
~Crystal~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: And yes Diana...I&#39;ll be at your talk.  I did not realize I had any issue with this until now.  Guess I&#39;m always learning. Heehee. <br/>

<br/>
I just despise those snarky question.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So if it&#39;s okay for your child to have a Twinkie, is it okay for him  <br/>
to shoot heroin?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Uh...  Well, for one thing, my kids CAN have Twinkies but I&#39;ve never  <br/>
known one to buy a Twinkie or to ask for one . Yet they&#39;ve had them,  <br/>
when others bought them, and didn&#39;t say &quot;WOW!  These are great!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And...<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that if some decent random sample of heroin users  <br/>
(current or former) were polled about whether their mother said it  <br/>
was okay, or whether they ASKED their moms, the restults would do no  <br/>
harm to the theories behind unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How many teenaged girls ask their moms if it&#39;s okay to have sex!?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t (and never did) encourage young kids to play kissing  <br/>
games.  Neither did I make any big deal when Holly was 12 or 13 and  <br/>
had played truth or dare a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
If moms are nervous, and can react calmly and verbally, how cool for  <br/>
the kids!<br/>
And if kids feel informed and empowered, how cool for them (and their  <br/>
moms).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877889703">I just went and read the pages that Sandra left in the cyber-bathroom<br/>
the other day, so that I don&#39;t double up here. Since many of us wont<br/>
get to the Fireside Chat, what with living in far away places and<br/>
such, I thought I&#39;d mention a few things round this topic as it has<br/>
been and is talked about in our house. I&#39;m happy to be critiqued and<br/>
open to be told &quot;too much for the list!&quot; as well, though I don&#39;t<br/>
believe what I say will be in that territory. Depending on the<br/>
individual levels of comfort readers here have around sex(uality) and<br/>
learning, I could come off anywhere between a big vanilla prude or in<br/>
need of a whole lot of saving. I think I&#39;m pretty middle of the road<br/>
really, and I hope, sensible and sensitive about sex and<br/>
children/younger people.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I hope this post doesn&#39;t take days to come through and become<br/>
redundant because of that, seeing as a lot of yahoo! group mail is<br/>
lost in space right now... one post I sent a couple of days ago is<br/>
still missing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, Crystal, I think that if someone let me know their child was<br/>
very sexual, I think I&#39;d like to know that their child was aware that<br/>
not all other children or young people of varying ages are necessarily<br/>
likewise. I was trying to think how I would broach the conversation if<br/>
I&#39;d decided I&#39;d like more information from the parent(s), like the<br/>
level of awareness/knowledge their child had around others&#39; sexuality<br/>
or lack there of, and around consent. How to set about that<br/>
conversation if I&#39;d decided it might be wise and possible to have it,<br/>
would depend on how well I knew the family and what I knew about the<br/>
way they relate in their family whether mainstream, RU or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
It is possible that a family who seems RU in many ways might not have<br/>
gone so far as to talk about being respectful of the bodily autonomy<br/>
of other children when it comes to sexual things. They might not do<br/>
that for numbers of reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Two I can think of are: not thinking further than &quot;all children<br/>
play/experiment some&quot; or, with the intention of not shaming their own<br/>
child, because they don&#39;t know how or aren&#39;t comfortable talking about<br/>
consent in matter of fact ways, even around the games that children<br/>
might play that seem low key, like truth or dare, for instance.  Even<br/>
that can have elements of coercion, I would think, just because it is<br/>
what it is. <br/>
<br/>
In discussing this with another parent, especially one who&#39;d let me<br/>
know their child was very sexual, I&#39;d do my best to reassure them that<br/>
I had no intention to shame them or their child, only to be matter of<br/>
fact (with the probably unspoken goal of ascertaining that my child<br/>
would be safe, or finding out what my child might need to know in<br/>
order to be/feel/remain safe).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I decide long ago that I would like for my own child to<br/>
be as clued up as it is possible and comfortable for her to be, so<br/>
that she not only knows herself (and what all else there is) well but<br/>
is able to also be respectful of others. I&#39;ve been open and<br/>
informative in the ways it is possible to be gradually through the<br/>
years. Talking about different aspects of sex and sexuality as they<br/>
came/come up, often presented on our television screen. In fact,<br/>
everthing I talk about from this point all is about sex in the media,<br/>
so I do want to say that conversations and information giving and<br/>
requesting have happened in other ways - just so as people will know<br/>
for sure that my child&#39;s sex ed hasn&#39;t all happened via tv and movies.<br/>
<br/>
For example, watching Four Weddings and a Funeral years ago with K,<br/>
when the scene where Hugh Grant&#39;s character ends up hiding in a<br/>
cupboard while a newly wed bride and groom are... going at it like<br/>
bunnies... it&#39;s just plain bonking (euphamisms can be fun and<br/>
interesting to talk about too sometimes), I said what popped into my<br/>
head, which was something like, that sex doesn&#39;t always, or even ever<br/>
have to look like that. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;ve been multitudes of images of sex we&#39;ve seen together.<br/>
Everthing from Marge and Homer Simpson rockin&#39; the casbah, through<br/>
CSI&#39;s furries and all sorts in between and far out, with explanations<br/>
given by me when asked, and sometimes also proferred unasked in a<br/>
conversational way that is comfortable to us. That mutual level of<br/>
comfort grows from the little beginnings. <br/>
<br/>
K, now 13 and not yet sexually active, has a clearly defined sense of<br/>
what is sex she can comfortably watch and what is sex she will turn<br/>
her head from. The latter is mostly where it looks a little or a lot<br/>
like something you see on one of the Crime shows (which she chooses<br/>
not to watch any longer, having checked them out to her satisfaction),<br/>
where  usually plastic looking people are clearly performing and often<br/>
kind of violently.  <br/>
<br/>
Images she will comfortably watch, are those that look like real<br/>
people in real relationships that don&#39;t have that patina, that<br/>
&quot;glamour&quot; of  performance being wrought (when the actual<br/>
people/characters most often seem on some level dissociated from what<br/>
they&#39;re doing), nor an overlay of scariness nevermind downright danger<br/>
and violation. <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a pretty healthy place for her to be at right now. <br/>
<br/>
Parody, of the bodice or pant ripping variety, whether overt like in<br/>
an old movie called Yellowbeard the Pirate (rip-roaring, UK, Pythonish<br/>
cast), or less obvious like in American Beauty (the mother as realtor<br/>
in one scene in a home she&#39;s trying to sell, which K read as parody)<br/>
do not make her uncomfortable, because that&#39;s all just downright funny<br/>
to her.  <br/>

<br/>
Is this child unschooled? How well do you know the family and the child&#39;s<br/>
living situation?<br/>
<br/>
In my experience it is somewhat unusual for children to be &quot;very sexual&quot; at<br/>
age 10...at least in the way that comes to mind for me when I think of<br/>
sexual. One symptom of sexual abuse can be an over interest in, and activity<br/>
with, sex. Obviously, there isn&#39;t any information here for us to make<br/>
determinations, but if my child was in that situation, I would be very<br/>
watchful...not shameful of course, like you said, but I wouldn&#39;t leave kids<br/>
alone in a closet with those dynamics known.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked with many sexually abused children over the years, and though<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that is what is going on here, I do think it is something to<br/>
watch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886168165">Are you just trying to get clear on what your personal feelings are on<br/>
this situation? You aren&#39;t actually passing judgment on this without<br/>
getting all the facts are you? I think that if you are having personal<br/>
feelings about what went on then maybe a conversation needs to be had<br/>
with the parents. You never know what they actually know about their<br/>
children, or what they have talked to them about. In essence it could<br/>
help clear up some of those feelings. Unless you were just wanting to<br/>
vent about the sex situation then all is null and void. <br/>
<br/>
That being said I want to say that a lot of conclusions are being made<br/>
here without all of the facts. So I hope that some level of respect<br/>
will be maintained. Saying that someones else&#39;s children are very<br/>
sexual or possibly suffer from sexual abuse is voicing some pretty<br/>
strong opinions. Are these judgments we would want someone to make<br/>
about our kids with out actually talking to the parents? I notice that<br/>
while reading all that is being said I am wishing that a conversation<br/>
would have been had before this as I do not think this is the big deal<br/>
that is being made of it. That is just my feeling and opinion. <br/>
<br/>
However, if you are just getting clear on your feelings and your<br/>
personal parent stuff then this too is null and void. <br/>

No one has a right or a need to get &quot;all the facts&quot; about anyone  <br/>

<br/>
-=-Saying that someones else&#39;s children are very<br/>

<br/>
Not it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
ANYone else&#39;s child might be more sexual than mine and might possibly  <br/>
have suffered from sexual abuse.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t hurt my kids a bit to know that some other kids might not  <br/>
have the same calm or self control that mine have.<br/>
<br/>
There are sometimes reasons that young teenaged girls want to have  <br/>
sex with any boy who will do it.  My boys were warned years ago that  <br/>
some girls would rather be pregnant than not.  Some girls would  <br/>
welcome a reason to make their parents angry, or to move away (or get  <br/>
thrown out).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s matter of fact.  I knew girls like that grown up, I&#39;ve read  <br/>
what some teenaged moms said about their feelings surrounding their  <br/>
first pregnancy.  I have a cousin who had four children by the time  <br/>
she was 21, by four different fathers.<br/>
<br/>
One of my husband&#39;s ex girlfriends told me once that her earliest  <br/>
memory was of lying on  her back in a treehouse, looking at the  <br/>
trees, and the other boys taking turns on her.  It wasn&#39;t a horrible  <br/>
memory for her, just a matter-of-fact memory.  Her ex husband just  <br/>
found out in the past few months that his oldest daughter was not his  <br/>
biological daughter.  This came up when she needed a blood transfusion.<br/>
<br/>
To pretend such situations aren&#39;t all around us isn&#39;t good or  <br/>
healthy.  To focus on them and make the whole world about them is  <br/>
equally as unhealthy.  Being realistic about dangerous situation, and  <br/>
being cautious but not reactionary, is the best we can do for our  <br/>
children.  They will be out in a world with those things all around  <br/>
them, and they need to know enough to protect themselves from abuse  <br/>
or entanglement while still knowing they can be friends with such  <br/>
people and have relationships with them that don&#39;t involve sexuality.<br/>
<br/>
I am NOT fishing for responses or confessions here, but there are  <br/>
people who will read this who were abused as children, or raped, or  <br/>
who have had abortions, or given a secret baby up for adoption under  <br/>
duress and pressure and live with a deep sorrow.  There are people  <br/>
here who might be married to people who were sexually abused in small  <br/>
or large ways, and that might affect their sexual behavior and  <br/>
attitude even if they don&#39;t have clear memories of what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone&#39;s experience is different, and secrecy and covering and  <br/>
ignoring can be partly healthy and partly UNhealthy.  We should not  <br/>
tell children everything we know and we shouldn&#39;t refuse to tell them  <br/>
anything at all.  They need some information, and what and how much  <br/>
they need depends on the situations they&#39;re coming into and the  <br/>
stages they&#39;re growing through.<br/>

If a parent uses that to suggest to a child that she not voluntarily  <br/>
be closed in a dark closet with the child, that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You never know what they actually know about their<br/>
children-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true of anyone, and some things are not other people&#39;s  <br/>
business, really.  And some parents who might think they know  <br/>
everything about their child don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You never know what they actually know about their<br/>
children, or what they have talked to them about. In essence it could<br/>
help clear up some of those feelings. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Or it could screw up relationships all kinds of ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds really nosy and pushy to me.  If I warn Holly about a  <br/>
particular boy because of things I know from other sources, I don&#39;t  <br/>
have to prove or cite.  I just say &quot;Be careful; be aware.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are these judgments we would want someone to make<br/>
about our kids with out actually talking to the parents? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If Marty is acting in such a way that a girl&#39;s parents believe him to  <br/>
be a sexually dangerous kid, why should they talk to me?  They should  <br/>
warn their daughter, advise her, not leave them alone.   (Marty and  <br/>
Kirby both have been reported to be very gentlemanly, by girls and  <br/>
their parents, so I&#39;m using him as an excuse knowing it is NOT a  <br/>
current situation.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People will and do &quot;make judgments&quot; about my children.  That&#39;s part  <br/>
of life.  I have and will advise my children in ways that optimize  <br/>
the liklihood that other people&#39;s judgments about them will be  <br/>
favorable.<br/>
<br/>
-=I notice that<br/>
while reading all that is being said I am wishing that a conversation<br/>
would have been had before this as I do not think this is the big deal<br/>
that is being made of it. That is just my feeling and opinion. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s making a big deal.   It&#39;s e-mail.  It&#39;s a discussion list.   <br/>
We&#39;re going to discuss things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428054245">&lt;&lt;Are you just trying to get clear on what your personal feelings are <br/>
on this situation?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Not the exact situation, it does not involve my family.  However, the <br/>
situation is what sparked feelings within myself that I am <br/>
uncomfortable with that I would like to explore as a RUing parent.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You aren&#39;t actually passing judgment on this without getting all <br/>
the facts are you?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This question has nothing to do with the actual situation so there <br/>
can be no passing judgment. I think I made that clear in my original <br/>
post.  The complete facts do not need to be stated and my original <br/>
post gives a simple version of what sparked my feelings that I would <br/>
like input on.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think that if you are having personal feelings about what went on <br/>
then maybe a conversation needs to be had with the parents. You never <br/>
know what they actually know about their children, or what they have <br/>
talked to them about. In essence it could help clear up some of those <br/>
feelings. Unless you were just wanting to vent about the sex <br/>
situation then all is null and void.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Null and voidmy feelings are not about the particular children <br/>
involved so there is no need for me to have any conversations with <br/>
the parents.  I do not have any concerns with the children involved.  <br/>
I have concerns about my sparked feelings.  It is not venting that I <br/>
am after but serious conversation with serious dialogue.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That being said I want to say that a lot of conclusions are being <br/>
made here without all of the facts.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that the original question swirled and moved around.  That <br/>
seems to happen with RUers.  I like when that happens but I would <br/>
like to explore my original question. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So I hope that some level of respect will be maintained. Saying <br/>
that someones else&#39;s children are very sexual or possibly suffer from <br/>
sexual abuse is voicing some pretty strong opinions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me, I do not jump to the `child is sexual so child was molested <br/>
and watch out&#39;.  I think that some people are just more sexual than <br/>
others are.  To me it is kind of like saying that a child read early <br/>
so everyone jumps to conclusions that they were forced or pushed.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are these judgments we would want someone to make about our kids <br/>
with out actually talking to the parents?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do not think anyone is judging here.  I am taking it as open <br/>
dialogue.  This is a discussion list and that is why I posted my <br/>
feelings here so I could receive a ton of information that I could go <br/>
process.  However, I do wish that the discussion would morph back to <br/>
the original question. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I notice that while reading all that is being said I am wishing <br/>
that a conversation  would have been had before this as I do not <br/>
think this is the big deal that is being made of it. That is just my <br/>
feeling and opinion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was no need to have a discussion with anyone in the situation <br/>
because the situation was only a catalyst for my feelings.  I am <br/>
exploring my feelings about RUing, parenting, and Sorscha.  These <br/>
feelings have nothing to do with the families involved in the <br/>
original situation but have everything to do with my life with <br/>
Sorscha.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;However, if you are just getting clear on your feelings and your <br/>
personal parent stuff then this too is null and void.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Null and void.  I am exploring my feelings, my personal tapes, and <br/>
traditional society rhetoric.  I was unaware that I was uncomfortable <br/>
with Sorscha kissing a child 4 years older. <br/>

parents. Possibilities are being discussed and the individual who  <br/>
brought it up (and anybody else with similar concerns) can do what  <br/>
she wants with them, including ignoring those that are off base.<br/>

gearing up to take any drastic action, just pondering.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Saying that someones else&#39;s children are very<br/>

&gt; strong opinions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really what happened. You might consider why this is how it came  <br/>
across to you, since your perspective seems skewed on this.<br/>
What really happened was that she said that the child&#39;s own parent  <br/>
mentioned that the 10 yo child is sexual and she said that child and  <br/>
some others, not her own, were playing kissing games in a closet, and  <br/>
it got her to pondering the circumstances and how she felt about it,  <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are these judgments we would want someone to make<br/>
&gt; about our kids with out actually talking to the parents?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She has no business talking to the parents - her child wasn&#39;t even  <br/>
involved.<br/>
<br/>
When kids are overly sexual in ways that are not usual for their age,  <br/>
it makes sense to point out that that can be a possible warning sign  <br/>
that the child might have been abused.<br/>
<br/>
The kid down the street from me, 11 years old when I was 10, tried to  <br/>
get me to do sexual stuff with him, a few times. I was disturbed by  <br/>
it and got away, but didn&#39;t tell anybody.<br/>
He&#39;s in prison for murder and rape.<br/>
  I don&#39;t know if he did anything to any of the other girls on our  <br/>
street or in our school.<br/>
A little warning, &quot;You might want to be cautious about being alone  <br/>
with Richard,&quot; would have been good - and it would have opened up the  <br/>
conversation to allow kids to talk about anything that HAD happened  <br/>
and maybe he&#39;d have gotten help. Who knows? Just a possibility.<br/>

see my nephews much, but I do know they aren&#39;t getting the kind of <br/>
information they should be getting about sex/sexual feelings, so I do <br/>
worry about them doing (or trying) inapropriate things with my <br/>
girls.  So I try to arm my kids with the information they need if <br/>
something happens, or something is tried.  Having these kinds of <br/>
conversations BEFORE something happens hopefully will make it easier <br/>
for them to come to me if something does happen.  <br/>

That&#39;s fine.  When ideas spring from ideas, we can follow those  <br/>
trails.  That&#39;s the whole idea of unschooling and natural learning  <br/>
and connections and strewing, honestly.  We CAN&#39;T be saying &quot;stick to  <br/>
the curriculum,&quot; can we? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
