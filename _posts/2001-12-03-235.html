<div id="ygrps-yiv-951044065">This group has one hundred members now.<br/>
<br/>
I had decided that at that point I would make a speech.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for being here.  I&#39;m really enjoying these discussions.  I <br/>
consider this group to be a kind of party.  Parties are temporary, and when <br/>
this one&#39;s not fun anymore we can &quot;go home,&quot; or to other lists or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
There are three other moderators, so if I&#39;m out of town or unavailable there <br/>
will be people to help people with list problems, or to open trapdoors under <br/>
any who seem more interested in fighting than discussing.  If at a party at <br/>
my house I couldn&#39;t talk a drunk down, and then my hairy friends couldn&#39;t <br/>
convince him to leave, I would call the cops.  So to maintain the peace of <br/>
the party, belligerent drunks and their ilk will find themselves in the dark <br/>
on the sidewalk.  Here in the student ghetto known as &quot;yahoogroups&quot; there is <br/>
always another party just up the street.<br/>
<br/>
Those who feared this list might just be refugees from &quot;another network&quot; will <br/>
be pleased to know there are people here who won&#39;t even know what I&#39;m talking <br/>
about with that statement.  There are people here I had missed from other <br/>
discussions in years past, and some new people who are just plainly new to <br/>
this.  So I&#39;m revelling in the broadened base of information.<br/>
<br/>
If the list never gets much bigger, that&#39;s okay.  I&#39;m enjoying the challenge <br/>
to my thinking and the happy rough and tumble of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for coming to my party.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758349864">&lt;&lt;Thanks for coming to my party.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m so glad you invited us!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I haven&#39;t written yet, but I&#39;m sure enjoying the reading! It&#39;s been<br/>
fantastic. I got stumped early on with Dan&#39;s expensive games issue...I<br/>
pondered that for days. Thanks to all that participated in that thread. I<br/>
felt like my brain was taking an unexpected journey, trekking along one way,<br/>
hearing something, readjusting the course... and that just kept happening. I<br/>
loved it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten behind a little in some of the other threads, but I&#39;ll get to<br/>
it. It will be my pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Sandra!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587330979">Hi all & Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unlurking for a moment just to say I&#39;m happy to be here and be listening in on your conversations.<br/>
I&#39;m new at unschooling (about 3 months now) and still learning so much every day, and absorbing everything like a sponge. You are all giving me food for thought. I feel like over the past few months I have changed my thinking so much I almost feel like I have joined a new religion, for unschooling has touched every aspect of my life. It has made me a better mother and a better person, or at least I feel that it has. I know I have a much better relationship with my kids since unschooling.<br/>
So anyway, I&#39;m glad to be one of one-hundred, glad to be *here* at this cool party.<br/>
<br/>
Karin<br/>
who hardly ever was invited to cool parties in school<br/>

great list. I plan to join in more, it is just that I have been so dang busy <br/>

<br/>
The internet, groups like this, people like you all here....well without you <br/>
I would not be unschooling. You are important and we are sure enjoying this <br/>
unschooling adventure. Thanks for the list Sandra<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023349508">Hello :)<br/>
100 members? How cool is that? WAY!!!!!! I joined when it was like 28!?<br/>
I am one from the other network, and I must say, I enjoy this much more than <br/>
the other! Havent posted much, but have enjoyed the reading much so!(major <br/>
lurker, but avid reader!) I would have to say Thank you Sandra for bringing <br/>
this list about! I was lost when you left the other network, still do not <br/>
care for it,(other network), but hanging around because its where I first <br/>
found out about unschooling! Habits die hard!<br/>
I am pleased to be here, and hope to contribute when I am able, but for now <br/>
due to my own circumstances will remain a lurker :) Thank you again for <br/>
creating wonderful list, as wonderful as you!!!!!!!!!!! You are the reason I <br/>
started unschooling, and I will always be grateful to your words of wisdomw <br/>
and your (if somewhat painful at times) honesty!!!!<br/>
