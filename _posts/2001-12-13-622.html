<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On paper, this looks good. It may work in practice for some, too. However, <br/>
from the time I was pretty young, I was involved daily with &quot;Real Man [Woman] <br/>
Work&quot; (everything from hauling mulch and firewood [seasonally] to hauling <br/>
laundry and ironing to painting fences and walls to cleaning washbasins and <br/>
scrubbing sidewalks). In the youngest days, I&#39;d reach the end of the day <br/>
tired, but somehow when I hit my teens, I was still full of energy for roving <br/>
at nighttime. The thrill of being out on my own in the moonlight was sleep <br/>
itself. <br/>
<br/>
This continued through young adulthood when I took college classes in the <br/>
a.m., worked a vet tech job at a mixed animal practice (meaning large and <br/>
small: lots of field work with big animals who often don&#39;t WANT to do what <br/>
you&#39;d like, plus all the poodle kissing), and at night did full-on theatre. <br/>
Most nights, I got about 4 hours&#39; sleep and did just fine.<br/>
<br/>
O, how I long for those days of abundant energy. :^D<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
