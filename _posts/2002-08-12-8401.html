<div id="ygrps-yiv-480903404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Maybe we could create our own unschool-family<br/>
&gt;friendly-non authoritarian scout group!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh If ONLY!  I hate that scouts is seperated into<br/>
different sex groups.  I wish there was an all family<br/>
inclusive, non-authoritarian, non-military,<br/>
non-religious (or multifaith embracing) group like<br/>
that.  The legal implications alone of trying to<br/>
create a scouting alternative is so daunting, not to<br/>
mention the financial aspects.  <br/>
