<div id="ygrps-yiv-750375140">Claire, 18, is wanting to know how she can find out about other unschooled young adults. She withdrew from school 2 years ago and has done some correspondence courses off and on in that time to please her disappointed and worried dad & stepmom. <br/>
<br/>
This week, many of her friends left for college. A few are seniors in high school. No one she knows who has gotten out of school has chosen to work. She is questioned and harrassed by friends about what she&#39;s going to do if she doesn&#39;t have a diploma. One told her she&#39;d be seen as a loser. All she wants to do is work. I think she wants to know that other people her age are doing fine without accredited diplomas. Georgia doesn&#39;t allow homeschool parents to award diplomas, but I can call her graduated. Her dad/stepmom told her she&#39;d be a liar because she didn&#39;t fulfill the GA requirements for a high school graduation. She&#39;s worried about future job applications because they all ask if the applicant has graduated. I told her if she decided later to go to college, we would figure out what to do because of their requirements. Even the 2-yr colleges want a certain set of courses to be completed, which she doesn&#39;t have. She&#39;s rather angry about it all.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But realize unschoolers are few and far between. Ray (16) has had better luck making friends with people in their early twenties who&#39;ve been away from school for a few years. He&#39;s met some socially, going to open-mike nights at a local coffee house and at larger social events, and some through work. <br/>
<br/>
Realistically, your dd is facing a situation that many adults face - how Do you go about meeting other people once you&#39;re out in the real world, which has entirely different social situations and mores than school? College provides a transitional enviroment, with some real-world aspects and some schoolish aspects, but plenty of people don&#39;t go to college. <br/>
<br/>
What does she like to do? Join a book club, yoga class, volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, get a job because it sounds interesting, go to art openings, go to political rallys, go to city council meetings - whatever appeals. Check the social calanders on unschooling sites to find meet-ups and camps and conferences for unschoolers:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Er... I think you need to help her get something other people can understand, whether that&#39;s a diploma or GED or enough college credits to obviate either. You&#39;ve fallen down on the job, there, and she has a right to be angry! It doesn&#39;t help in the least to tell someone &quot;its okay if you don&#39;t have a diploma&quot; if everyone else that person knows is going to make trouble about it - its not okay. Do more research and see what you can do - is there an umbrella school option in GA? Look into getting her a diploma through one of those. Depending on the school, they may have a way to give a diploma based on an interview or portfolio, or you may have to wait a year. Look into that and the GED, and lay out some realisitc options for your dd. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853699414">I think your premise (that homeschoolers in GA cannot award diplomas) is incorrect:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How does a home school handle transcripts and diplomas?<br/>
According to the Georgia Home School Law that recognized home schools as an educational entity along with private and public schools, you as the officials of the school have the right to determine graduation requirements, recognize graduation status, grant diplomas, and issue transcripts. Since colleges, universities, and businesses have certain unspecified expectations on these documents, check with the institution or business to determine what they require.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ghea.org/pages/resources/tips.php">http://www.ghea.org/pages/resources/tips.php</a><br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be a GA-accredited diploma, but, as in most states, since homeschooling is, like private school, a legal, recognized alternative to public school, the awarding of a diploma by the homeschool is perfectly fine.<br/>
<br/>
Andrea<br/>

 All she wants to do is work. I think she wants to know that other people her age are doing fine without accredited diplomas. Georgia doesn&#39;t allow homeschool parents to award diplomas, but I can call her graduated. Her dad/stepmom told her she&#39;d be a liar because she didn&#39;t fulfill the GA requirements for a high school graduation.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think she had a chance to truly come away from the school mindset, though I did see her trying. She talks to me alot but the guilt from her dad & stepmom just overwhelm her sometimes. Recently, she went on a vacation with her dad & stepmom and they surprised her by driving her to a college campus where they started in on her again. It totally caught her off guard. She&#39;s angry that no one other than me understands how she feels, and worse, they won&#39;t even try. <br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t regret leaving school at all. She doesn&#39;t know how to handle the people who say she has quit. She doesn&#39;t like that they believe she gave up, when she&#39;s proud of herself for choosing her own path. She doesn&#39;t want to finish school because she feels she&#39;s had more than enough. She&#39;s also had enough of trying to explain to her friends and dad about how she feels because they really don&#39;t listen.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to help her connect with other people who choose not to follow a traditional path and get a diploma. Right now, she doesn&#39;t know anyone beyond high school age that does not have a diploma. I tell her to believe in herself and over time, her friends will just stop thinking about her education. Right now, it&#39;s all important to them and her dad because she would have graduated last May if she had stayed in school. And now, it&#39;s time for them to go to college and she&#39;s left behind, in their eyes. She&#39;s happy to see a few of them go, but she&#39;ll miss the rest. She is happy that she isn&#39;t going because it&#39;s not something she wants to do.<br/>

<br/>
What DOES she want to do?  That would be a key question I think!  She wants to <br/>
work, so how do you help her incorporate the skills she has, the things she <br/>
likes into a job?  What about working from an intern position, non pay, to <br/>
establish a resume or have something to put on a job application?<br/>
<br/>
It surprises me how many people don&#39;t even question the college track.  College <br/>
is very expensive and doesn&#39;t necessarily have the pay off return that people <br/>
think it has.  Not any more anyway.  This has an interesting take on it, from a <br/>
purely financial aspect: <br/>

Maybe she could look at that, or you could look at that and help her  <br/>
to feel angst without finding a culprit or a cause.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And now, it&#39;s time for them to go to college and she&#39;s left behind,  <br/>

the rest. She is happy that she isn&#39;t going because it&#39;s not something  <br/>
she wants to do-=-<br/>
<br/>
Over the next few years some will drop out, and be stuck with loans.   <br/>
Some will finish and not get the job they wanted.  Some will stay in  <br/>
because college was going well, and get advanced degrees.  Judging by  <br/>
this list, some of those will become stay-at-home moms.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe conversations about the range of existence and uses of high  <br/>
school diplomas and college degrees would help her.  Maybe list  <br/>
everybody you know, all your relatives, all your neighbors, and try to  <br/>
fill in what you know of  their education and current and former  <br/>
employment.  Maybe that could be a soothing hobby and also a kind of  <br/>
study of happiness.  Which of those people seem the most content and  <br/>
helpful to others?  It might help her decide she does want to go to go  <br/>
to college, at some point, but not necessarily this year.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, too, she could keep in touch with those going-to-college  <br/>
friends and see how they&#39;re doing.  They&#39;ll be having fun, and then  <br/>
they&#39;ll have tests and papers due...  Maybe she could vicariously  <br/>
chart their emotions without having to do those papers or buy those  <br/>
$120 books herself.<br/>
<br/>
As to connections, though, of meeting unschoolers, I have a couple of  <br/>
observations.  Holly was talking just this afternoon (not in a  <br/>
positive way) about some unschooled teens who seem to have no friends  <br/>
other than other unschoolers, and it seemed they did NOT live in the  <br/>
real world.  (Holly has friends who were unschooled--tons of them.   <br/>
She has that many or more friends who did go to school.)   And knowing  <br/>
someone who didn&#39;t go to school if it comes up naturally is okay (and  <br/>
that&#39;s part of what conferences are for; I don&#39;t know whether you went  <br/>
to conferences when she was 16 or 17, but that would&#39;ve been the time  <br/>
to get her connected with other teens), but unschooled kids don&#39;t have  <br/>
any obligation to befriend someone who tried to but didn&#39;t really  <br/>
quite unschool, nor even those who did unschool for 12  years.  That&#39;s  <br/>
as little to base a friendship on as going to the same high school  <br/>
is.  Some kids really do hit it off, and some don&#39;t, but the idea that  <br/>
unschoolers have social obligations to other unschoolers can be  <br/>
problematical.<br/>

leaves school tells her that it&#39;s fine not to have a diploma, but then  <br/>
can&#39;t make that so, that was falling down on the job.  If the daughter  <br/>
is angry at the mom for leading her to believe that she would be as  <br/>
other unschoolers, but unschooling never really happened, that might  <br/>
be the cause of the anger.<br/>
<br/>
This is another tale of divorce as a factor, I think.  The parents  <br/>
didn&#39;t agree on creating a supportive space in which the teen could  <br/>
recover, blossom and change.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I&#39;m sorry! I didn&#39;t realize I didn&#39;t mention her job. She adores her job. She&#39;s worked there about 10 months now and was made a shift manager just a few weeks ago. It&#39;s a small Asian cafe in an outdoor mall area. Right now, she wants to become a full manager and then at some point in the future, she would like to become a business owner like my brother-in-law. He became a franchise owner of Domino&#39;s Pizza after working as a manager for a couple of years. Also, her boss became a business owner in the same way. Neither of them attended college before becoming business owners and so she sees it isn&#39;t a necessary step in fulfilling her dream.<br/>

We were talking and I told her it would be nice if we could find people who have positive experiences without a high school diploma, since the only experiences she is hearing are all negative.<br/>

<br/>
Does her father know that this is her plan?  If he doesn&#39;t know, then perhaps <br/>
she should tell him.  Down the road, she could leave it open to her father <br/>
helping her find business classes that might help her with that goal, or help <br/>
with a small business loan instead of paying for college.  Maybe it&#39;s just a <br/>
matter of wanting to know that she has a plan and that she will be okay.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t clear - I meant that you, personally, need to do more research not &quot;you&quot; meaning &quot;you and her&quot; or that you should force her do anything in particular. A diploma, or something other people recognize as one, is a tool your dd can use to protect herself against other people. Without that tool, she&#39;s wide open to attack. <br/>
<br/>
It looks like Georgia has several different possible avenues for &quot;graduation&quot;. Its worth looking into them, and checking with some umbrella schools. Some will accept a portfolio or interview and provide you with a diploma, others will likely want you to &quot;enroll&quot; for a year. The point, though, isn&#39;t to make your dd jump through more hoops, but to find her a tool she can use to get other people off her back. Here are a couple links pulled off the top of a pile with some information on the subject:<br/>

<br/>
Another tool she may prefer is cutting off relationships that don&#39;t support her choices, at least in the short term. Its not a gentle and graceful option, but its good to at least have it on the table, especially if she&#39;s likely to be taken somewhere against her will.<br/>
<br/>
 Another option is simply to agree with people, to their faces, and so put an end to the conversation. &quot;You&#39;re right&quot; can bring an arguement to a grinding halt and provide the opportunity to change the subject. <br/>
