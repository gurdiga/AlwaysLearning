<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560652484">My oldest, Kirby, is thirty-one years old, and is married since October.  Last week, he and his wife signed a 20-year mortgage on a two-bedroom place a third of a mile from me and Keith.  <br/>
<br/>
When Keith and I were his age, we were living in the house Keith’s parents had bought in the 1950’s, paying cheap rent.  Marty’s living in that house (with his wife) now, paying cheap rent to us.  Keith and I didn’t actually choose and buy a house until we were in our 40s.  <br/>
<br/>
There’s a photo here of Kirby and Destiny, before they were married, when they were zombies (one night, with some pretty nice make-up), and it’s on a page I’ve just fixed up, added to, and announced on the site-news blog I mentioned here recently. <br/>

The photo shown in the new new-to-site post is by Roya Dedeaux (formerly Roya Sorooshian) of her son, Wyatt, playing with an iPad.  Roya had a daughter last week.  <br/>

<br/>
Kirby and Roya, who have been the subjects of so many stories here and in other unschooling discussions over the years, are living their own big lives.<br/>
<br/>
Other grown unschoolers are doing cool things, too.  Tell stories if you want.  I didn’t want to suggest those were the only two, just that the zombie page came up which reminded me to mention the mortgage (a good milestone for a young person) and Roya’s baby pops up in lots of photos on facebook lately.<br/>
