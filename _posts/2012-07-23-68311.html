<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333915981">My 6 year old stepped on a nail the other day, and it led to me telling her about Tetanus bacteria.  Now she wants to learn more about bacteria.  We found some interesting videos on youtube, but we were hoping to find some sort of game.  Does anyone know of an online game that shows the structure of the bacteria cell?  <br/>
