<div id="ygrps-yiv-864669385">ok I have been pretty busy here the last few weeks  so this may be a long one <br/>
and I will try to condence it.<br/>
june 18th i went to let my dog out the basement sliding door for his <br/>
morning &quot;pee pee&quot;my grand daughter (4 almost 5) was with me as she likes to <br/>
open the door and  yelled &quot;kitties&quot; about that same moment a  gressy gray  <br/>
protive mother cat  jumped about  10 feet and clawed the door.<br/>
I quickly grabed her hand as she was still fixed on the 6 &quot;kitties&quot; took them <br/>
up stairs and sat there. Not knowing what to do as i have a old lab and a 3 yr <br/>
old pit and defently didnt want them in the back and didnt want any  one hurt <br/>
i called the shelter in nearest city. nope they cant help me. Call sherrif <br/>
nope no help. Call city, they say call sherriff nope again. Called old freind <br/>
city  councilman. Says call city or take care of it yourself.call city again <br/>
well to bad.<br/>
gbaby kept wanting to see kitties. ok after many calls and every one saying to <br/>
bad. I went back out decided catch em get out of yard . well i was lunged at <br/>
by what looked to be a six week old kittie. not good, here comes another. the <br/>
mother cat disappered.(leaving her 6 kittens behind) and then here comes the <br/>
13 yr old. another attack. we all went in again made the same calls these <br/>
cates are acting weird. Still nope to bad.Found the mayor was called,and she <br/>
said to bad not a city problem.<br/>
(and well her and I havent gotten along for years  seems i was to good of a <br/>
scout leader and  10 years ago and well she lost that one  council steped in <br/>
said nope she our leader and if the girls want to meet weekly and  go every <br/>
other mo somewhere u have the opertuiny to tell your child nope.)<br/>
and was again told handle it.<br/>
so i did i went about the busness of trying to catch them, got 4, got clawed a <br/>
lot.put in a small dog training cage. Gee they excaped . back to the phone. as <br/>
when i caught them I noticed they where draing  puss stuff  and blood and some <br/>
green stuff from rectom.Still to bad till they bite no way no help.<br/>
so out i go i am noy having these animails live under my deck and in my yard!<br/>
one jumped me and bite me.So now i was angery.got it put this one in a canary <br/>
cage. went in called and gee transport it 30 miles in yourself with kids in <br/>
tow.nope hubby came in said there is no help unless it in county and out of <br/>
city limits? that what they where saying so he took it while i was  on phone <br/>
and the woman on phone said Dee please tell me i didnt just hear what i <br/>
thought i herd.i said yepp he left in car.her answer was quite... Dee what if <br/>
they have rabies?..Dang (ok not the word I used)to late he was gone. so on to <br/>
doctor calls who starts making loads of calls. andwer rabies 4 cases in area <br/>
recently ,dog,skunk,coon,badger. ok in to doc i go.gee surprise i have to get <br/>
rabie shots. 1500 a shot.er cost doc cost. and they are now not thru navel but <br/>
6 first day and 4 others in spaced intervels.<br/>
 Good news is i can catch em take to area  3 hr drive pay 600 min. to have <br/>
them tested not just the bitter but the scratchers also as cats can transfer <br/>
rabies thru sctarches as rabies are transfered thru saliva and cats lick.<br/>
went home told hubby, and sherrif arived gee now there dangerious but acording <br/>
to there code only if it bites not if it lunges or trys to bite or scratches. <br/>
The city code says cats arent dangerious at all.<br/>
12 hours after this all starts they borrow a trap set where the one was <br/>
relised.Next day way after they gone they set in my yard one.<br/>
Newpapers come out. Mayor  says gee funny no one but there family ever see the <br/>
catsand tells paper cat &quot;if&quot; it was there only reacted cuz i have a pit. Well <br/>
it was the old 18 yr old dog there he so blind he didnt even see it. and the <br/>
pit was still upstairs in its kennel waiting to go pp.<br/>
in a small town this is getting out of controll with  sue em, sue em.<br/>
and to make matter worse.I am now alergect to the shots and i an severly <br/>
alergect to all steroids so i have to deal with it but the next shot my last <br/>
and each one worse than the last with the reaction,and last one no feeling in <br/>
left 2 fingers and crept up my neck with the sweeling.<br/>
Tonight they had city council and others showed up also with pictures of <br/>
strays as mayor in one paper said there is no strays in our lil town. There is <br/>
she is blind i guess. My kids have quit playing in the park that  ajoins my <br/>
back yard  and the back yard.They have now seen the bad side of strays and <br/>
goverment red tape and now understands the phrase &quot;passing the buck&quot;<br/>
well end result of past few weeks: i am facing hosptial,council will have <br/>
special meeting to see if there is a problem at end of mounth and  my insurice <br/>
wont cover the main part of the shots or the er visits.i do have a 500.00 <br/>
decuct so after that the er and doc visits will be covered but there is a cap <br/>
on meds.and spesial permission dont cover rabie and they are 1500.00 each shot.<br/>
thank you for alowing me to vent I cant seem to unwind from the futer beating <br/>
I am reciving from my lil town goverment.<br/>

&gt; I have some stories just like Sandra&#39;s.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But as to the above, we talk about that just like we talk talk talk about<br/>
&gt; everything else. Both my kids, 9 and 13, are really interested in politics,<br/>
&gt; especially the 9 yr old who is into reading and creating political cartoons.<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s imperative for us to help our kids with their decoding skills<br/>
&gt; about propaganda, just like product advertising (and aren&#39;t they one and the<br/>
&gt; same now these days anyway?).<br/>
