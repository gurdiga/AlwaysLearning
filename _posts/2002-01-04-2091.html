<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391457025">I like the way you think Kelly.  We are wonderfully<br/>
immersed in the holidays in that sense as well.  I<br/>
LOVE to decorate with Santas.  Santa is real in the<br/>
same sense that dreams and visions are real and<br/>
important to us.  When our kids are older we will be<br/>
discussing with them the importance of embodying for<br/>
each other (and others) the virtues of Santa.  Santa<br/>
is very real in a spiritual sense.  We ALL do<br/>
stockings here, mommy and daddy too, not just the<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I also love to point out the pagan beginnings of so<br/>
many various traditions.  It&#39;s so much fun to watch<br/>
the faces of people that don&#39;t understand what we mean<br/>
by &quot;pagan&quot; when they come over and see our tree, and<br/>
santa&#39;s and candles and decked halls and hear carols. <br/>
But, it&#39;s all one, one web, one energy, one Higher<br/>
Power, so it doesn&#39;t matter whether the chicken or the<br/>
egg comes first.<br/>
