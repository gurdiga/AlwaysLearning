 </span></blockquote>&quot;He&#39;s six, he&#39;s old enough to deal with adults on his own&quot; <br/>
is not at all in the realm of &quot;He&#39;s six, and I&#39;m willing to talk to the <br/>
coach/teacher for him, but he wants to do it himself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That parent wasn&#39;t expecting that six was old enough, but was willing to let <br/>
a child call the exception.<br/>
<br/>
A six year old, despite our &quot;ship them off to school&quot; tradition, is very <br/>
young and shouldn&#39;t have to be negotiating him own safety and interpersonal <br/>
life UNLESS he himself really wants to.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the point I was trying to make, and the defenses and examples are <br/>
going away from that (which is fine, expected, etc., but I wanted to point at <br/>
the technical difference).<br/>

It was someone quoting someone already--sorry I just let my automatic <br/>
responder-thang go without deleting or looking back to see who originally <br/>
said what.  It more means what post I got it from than who first put those <br/>
words together.  Nothing meant by it.  I wasn&#39;t even looking at names.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552567654">Dawn wrote this - it is just a bit of the overall point she was making and <br/>
I&#39;m not really so much responding to the particular situation she brought up <br/>
but starting from what she said in this bit and from it I&#39;m moving on to <br/>
another issue which it made me think about...... <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I said the sentence below, but there was more to it and it has been snipped.<br/>
&gt; My question was why use age as a difference?  If as unschoolers it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; advocated that we are all equal what does the teachers age have to do with<br/>
&gt; my six year old?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who says we&#39;re all equal - I didn&#39;t see that in my unschooling instruction <br/>
booklet &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Equal is such a tricky word -- it is usually assumed by the user that <br/>
everybody knows what they mean by it - but that is often not the case. I <br/>
don&#39;t know, in this case, what it means to Dawn. A 6 yo and and adult teacher <br/>
are equal in what ways? There are many ways they are clearly not equal, of <br/>
course, and one of those would be physical size and another would be the <br/>
&quot;authority&quot; typically vested in them by the rest of society. These may matter <br/>
in some circumstances and not in others. If a 6 yo knows all about some topic <br/>
and a 40 yo knows little about it, then they are once again not equal in terms<br/>
 of knowledge about that topic and in this example the 6 yo is more of an <br/>
authority. It happens all the time in unschooling circles - that kids are <br/>
actually given recognition of such expertise that they have. <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m pretty sure that Dawn didn&#39;t mean &quot;equal&quot; in any of these senses -- <br/>
maybe just in terms of being equally worthy human beings? Something more <br/>
along those lines?<br/>
<br/>
There were times when my kids were young that they themselves handled <br/>
uncomfortable situations with adults/teachers/leaders/etc. and times that I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have let them handle it alone because I didn&#39;t think they understood <br/>
what they were getting themselves into. I wouldn&#39;t let them handle it if I <br/>
thought the adult would become physically or verbally abusive, for example. <br/>
But - that is parenting judgement - knowing the situation and our own kids <br/>
and so on. I don&#39;t see it as an &quot;unschooling&quot; issue at all - unless someone <br/>
wants to argue that unschooling means always leaving kids to deal with stuff <br/>
on their own based on the principle that kids are &quot;equal&quot; to adults. But I&#39;ve <br/>
never heard any unschoolers seriously argue that parents shouldn&#39;t act as <br/>
responsible parents.<br/>
