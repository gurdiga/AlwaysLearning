<div id="ygrps-yiv-704170305">Dee, you and your daughter are on the right track.  The school system does<br/>
NOT care about your daughter or her future.  They care about the funding<br/>
they get from her warm body in a chair all day, and if she&#39;s in any special<br/>
classes because of RAD, they get even  more.<br/>
<br/>
I say, pull her out NOW, let the healing begin, and to HE** with the school<br/>
system.<br/>
<br/>
The people in the system (teachers and administrators) can&#39;t see past the<br/>
system or your daughter&#39;s diagnosis.  You, on the otherhand, are much more<br/>
qualified on your daughter than they are.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you (as your 18yr old already has) that straight A&#39;s means diddly<br/>
squat in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Janet, mom to Thomas, 4.5, and Caroline, 8.5<br/>
