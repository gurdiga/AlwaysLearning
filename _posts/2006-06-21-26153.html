<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892812294">I know some of thesepeople, but most I don&#39;t.  Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s  <br/>
there.  I know Pat Farenga.  I&#39;ve met Grace Llewellyn but don&#39;t know  <br/>
her.  David Freidman, who&#39;s in the same section I am, I know from the  <br/>
SCA (as Duke Cariadoc, and he knows me as Countess AElflaed, but we  <br/>
had some years of correspondence on paper and by e-mail too, before  <br/>
he had any children).  Others might be people I only know by online  <br/>
code names or e-mails.<br/>
<br/>
But this is from the thank-you section of someone&#39;s master&#39;s thesis.   <br/>
People who like that sort of thing might want to take a look.  She&#39;s  <br/>
considering expanding into a book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125441698">I&#39;m slogging through the thing I mentioned the other day.  There are  <br/>
some really interesting parts, and some frustrating bits.  First,  <br/>
it&#39;s written in that language used only in college text books and  <br/>
scholarly &quot;studies.&quot;  It&#39;s not regular English.  It&#39;s a language I  <br/>
used and read when I was in college, but was glad to leave behind for  <br/>
real English.<br/>
<br/>
But what&#39;s more interesting to me is that although the researcher did  <br/>
&quot;get unschooling&quot; better than many people who come to it as a  <br/>
reporter or a researcher, the things she didn&#39;t get are telling too.   <br/>
Because she worked hard to try to understand, it&#39;s interesting to see  <br/>
what is so hard to grasp.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t cut and paste from it because it&#39;s a PDF, but I want to  <br/>
transcribe a bit of it.  Page 74, in the first of five studies, about  <br/>
a boy who started liking opera when he was six, and goes to yard  <br/>
sales and asks for opera records.  He&#39;s 11 and his brother&#39;s seven,  <br/>
in this part of the account.  First the research quotes the mom and  <br/>
then comments.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; &#39; The operas [Peter] chose [to rent on DVD] were the ones he  <br/>
thought would also appeal to our younger son, Richard,&#39; Mary  <br/>
remarked.  Clearly, Peter hopes to cultivate another opera fan in the  <br/>
household, another person to share his interest and enthusiasm.   <br/>
Peter also attempts to initiate his younger brother into the practice  <br/>
of becoming an opera fan. Mary&#39;s family engages in the social  <br/>
practice of learning.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The way unschoolers access media resources and people underscores  <br/>
the importance they place on authenticity.  When unschoolers re- <br/>
conceptualize the world around them, they see an abundance of real- <br/>
life resources. ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So although she&#39;s kinda getting it, and doing her best to help the  <br/>
academics who will read her paper get it, it amounts to stilted  <br/>
nonsense on another level.<br/>
I know from these sorts of things with my own family that it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
need to even begin to be about &quot;cultivating&quot; or &quot;initiating.&quot;  It&#39;s  <br/>
about  saying &quot;Listen!  This is cool!&quot;  and if the person says &quot;wow&quot;  <br/>
that&#39;s great and if they say &quot;Not now,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t like it,&quot; that&#39;s  <br/>
great too.  Within the analytical construct (see?  Those phrases  <br/>
beget more of themselves, damn it) above, if Richard doesn&#39;t like  <br/>
opera, then Peter has failed to cultivate; he has suffered   <br/>
initiation failure which would seem to show a faulty cultivation  <br/>
methodology.   It&#39;s just too much structure.  It&#39;s a false structure  <br/>
over a lack of structure. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;the practice of becoming an opera fan&quot; jars in the light of  <br/>
unschooling too.  There was a REAL becoming there, not a plan of  <br/>
action after which (if one&#39;s practice proved sound) one would be a   <br/>
certifiable or completed opera fan.  And the family is NOT &quot;engaging  <br/>
in the social practice of learning.&quot;  That scaffolding can be  <br/>
removed.  Mary&#39;s family learns for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Given all that, the fact that the next paragraph talks about  <br/>
&quot;authenticity&quot; is kinda cute!   &quot;When unschoolers re-conceptualize  <br/>
the world...&quot;   WHOA!    Those of us who were interviewed failed in  <br/>
our attempt to initiate this researcher into the practice of becoming  <br/>
someone who understands unschooling.  If anyone has &quot;re- <br/>
conceptualized the world,&quot; it&#39;s academia, which defines things in  <br/>
terms of what helps with school success, and comes up with words like  <br/>
&quot;extracurricular&quot; and &quot;co-ed&quot; and &quot;screentime&quot; and &quot;chapter book&quot; and  <br/>
uses them outside the bounds of school as though they still  make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad the project was done, and I&#39;m really glad to be able to read  <br/>
it, but I&#39;m sorry that the semester ended and so it was written up to  <br/>
match the calendar, regardless of whether the work of understanding  <br/>
it well enough to analyze it was really finished.  The end-of-session  <br/>
bell rang.  Summer vacation.  No more learning.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668418413">-=-In an IM interview with Kirby, an unschooling teen in New Mexico, he<br/>
spoke about the real-time strategy that gets honed as he takes part  <br/>
in the SCA and<br/>
MMPORGs. &quot;In a fast paced game, the main reason people will play is  <br/>
for the quick<br/>
thinking it requires and the rush of the game.&quot;164 Going in-character  <br/>
while<br/>
simultaneously remaining aware of meta-level strategy work to make  <br/>
improvisation a<br/>
practice that at once sharpens skills of the individual-in-play-with- <br/>
the-group.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Before any of you point out to me that it is possible to lift text  <br/>
from a PDF, Keith has shown me.  Good!<br/>
I&#39;m glad he came home early and asked what I was doing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
