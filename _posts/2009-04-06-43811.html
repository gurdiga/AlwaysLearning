<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210400557">H there.  My son is ten.  He has always had less than average impulse control, and seems to also just have a lot more impulses than many kids.  He&#39;s matured over the years in many ways to where his physical impulses are more often just to bang on things, fiddle with things, etc., and not used against others *as much*.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing, though, seems to have gotten worse, his impulsive words and expressions.  He is, so I&#39;m told by my friends, pretty good with them, like when he&#39;s at a sleepover with them or something, he&#39;s respectful.  But at home with us, his parents and brother, he&#39;s really tough to take.  He says to us all manner of hurtful things all the time.  Examples are, &quot;Duh.&quot;  &quot;Shut the frick up.&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re fat.&quot;  &quot;Stupid lady.&quot;  &quot;You&#39;re such an idiot.&quot;  And sings about his brother, at the top of his lungs, &quot;Boogie&#39;s an idiot.&quot;  And please forgive me for posting this one, it&#39;s so crass to me, but helps illustrate the extent of this issue, &quot;Suck my butt.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The context of these things is totally random.  He shouts them out out of no where, or in response to simple questions like, &quot;What do you want to eat?&quot;    It&#39;s so prevalent I have wondered if he has Tourettes Syndrome, but can&#39;t figure that out, and besides, the fact that he mostly does this at home, or where he&#39;s comfortable makes me think it can&#39;t be; he must have some control.  (Although I think people with Tourette&#39;s also have *some* control.)<br/>
<br/>
When he says these things, I used to always correct him, but it never changed anything.  When he was younger, when I still used &quot;consequences,&quot; or punishment, we would succeed at getting rid of particular words that we were singling out, but soon after other words would just take their place.  Now, sometimes I ignore them (at one time as a strategy to make them go away if not paid attention to, but now mostly because I feel so powerless, and don&#39;t know what else to do.)  Sometimes I will get angry, and say, &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me that way!!!!!&quot;  Other times I will more calmly ask him to stop.  Mostly, though, it&#39;s anger or resignation.  I&#39;ve talked to him, and he pretty much says he just says things, and when I&#39;ve laid into him in anger sometimes at my wits end, he&#39;ll cry and say he doesn&#39;t know why he does it, and can&#39;t help himself.  It&#39;s horribly sad, and I feel so guilty for being mad at him, but sometimes I feel so beaten down, I feel battered and can&#39;t muster patience or understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to him, when he&#39;s saying he can&#39;t help it, about quickly apologizing, like saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I didn&#39;t mean to say that.&quot;  He never does that, but instead says, &quot;Just kidding.&quot;  I think it hurts him/scares him so much to have this thing he can&#39;t control that it&#39;s hard to admit, so he instead takes on this clown nature, everything&#39;s a joke.  I personally, even though I can articulate an understanding of how this comes to be, end up seeing him sometimes as a jerk - who would joke *like that*; it&#39;s not funny.<br/>
<br/>
I will add, to clarify, that he is not only like this with us, but to a lesser extent with friends too.  He&#39;s always calling his friends stupid, &quot;You&#39;re so stupid.  How could you not know that?!&quot;  But I must say, I hear a lot of the friends talk like this to each other too, but it does feel like he&#39;s worse.<br/>
<br/>
Another quality of all this is the criticism.  I will say, like a recent mention on this list, that my son has some qualities that will be awesome when he matures, but now are rough.  He is very observant, very critical, sees hypocrisy, catches incongruencies, sees others&#39; mistakes, etc..  He is bright, and much of the time his observations are spot on, but he lacks any grace, understanding, or compassion.  It&#39;s like he sees absolutely no connection between his critical words and how someone might *feel* in response to them.  <br/>
<br/>
A recent &quot;last straw,&quot; although it feels like last straws many days, was this weekend after his soccer game a mom of a teammate came up to him and laid into him, saying, &quot;Jesse, you need to stop criticizing your teammates.  I&#39;ve heard you since the beginning of the season, and we talked to the coach at the beginning of the season, and you haven&#39;t stopped.  I hear you out there constantly criticizing my son and the others, and.......&quot;  And on and on some.  She didn&#39;t call him names, and didn&#39;t yell at him, but really told it as it was.  I wanted to protect him from this public confrontation, but was torn, thinking, in desperation to help him, that maybe he&#39;ll hear this, and eventually get it.  <br/>
<br/>
I did talk to her after, and told her I understand her frustration, but wished she had come to me, and not confronted him directly (they have no relationship; we don&#39;t know her at all).  She was very apologetic for that, said she was just so upset that here her son was crying, even after a game they won, hurt by something/s my son said.  <br/>
<br/>
I talked to him, and he says the kid is mean to him, always was.  The mom said that her son has been fed up with him since early on, and so has since not been nice.  My son *does not see* how things like, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you pass it?&quot; are critical and hurt people or make them mad.  I hate to admit it, but I believe my son started it, that his criticisms pushed this kid over the edge.  It may be true that he had a low tolerance, but I think it probably is true that is started with my son&#39;s insensitivity.  (The other day he pointed out to his teammates that one boy - a skinny boy who is not one of the more athletic on the team - had his shorts on inside out and said, &quot;Hey, everyone laugh at Ryan.  He has his shorts on inside out.&quot;  And all the boys laughed.  Just another example to support why I believe he started the problem with the other boy.  He did not see how getting everyone to laugh at Ryan was bad.  He says, &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
So, finally, to clarify, summarize, some of the things my son says just seem like random outbursts, while others seem understandable observation, criticism, but ones that when shared hurt people.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one final thing, I think a lot of my son&#39;s more random outbursts, obnoxious mean sayings come out of boredom.  He needs a lot of stimulation - intellectual and physical - and we can&#39;t keep up with that need.  He chooses to spend his mornings in front of the computer, and after a while I think he&#39;s almost busting out of his body.  We used to say, when people would say we should make him sit in his high chair that we couldn&#39;t because we knew he would combust, or his head would blow off.  He&#39;s a bundle of energy.<br/>
<br/>
What can I do to help my son?  I know his heart, and although he acts like such a jerk I know how he cares about people.  He loves animals, and babies, and feels joy when others are joyful.  He is sooooo hard to live with, and I am so sad how he hurts others.  (Especially his little brother.)  I feel a duty to do all I can to protect others - like his teammates.  But I also want to help him so he is not perceived as nothing but a jerk, and treated as such by the world.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;m afraid this is way too long for this list.  It seems like something where all the context is important to understand and to find solutions.  Maybe also this &quot;problem&quot; is beyond the scope of this list.  I&#39;m asking here because I know I will get responses from people who will give my son the benefit of the doubt, and not expect that I can or should just &quot;not tolerate it,&quot; as the rest of the world would say, and where people will offer creative &quot;solutions&quot; that I have not yet considered.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
-=Sandra, I&#39;m afraid this is way too long for this list.  It seems  <br/>
like something where all the context is important to understand and to  <br/>
find solutions.  Maybe also this &quot;problem&quot; is beyond the scope of this  <br/>
list.  I&#39;m asking here because I know I will get responses from people  <br/>
who will give my son the benefit of the doubt, and not expect that I  <br/>
can or should just &quot;not tolerate it,&quot; as the rest of the world would  <br/>
say, and where people will offer creative &quot;solutions&quot; that I have not  <br/>
yet considered.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should tolerate it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m asking here because I know I will get responses from people  <br/>
who will give my son the benefit of the doubt,=-<br/>
<br/>
What doubt?<br/>
Tourette&#39;s isn&#39;t directed comments to people.  It&#39;s more like a tic,  <br/>
like a word or phrase repeated without direction.     If he&#39;s  <br/>
directing meaningful words toward individuals, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s  <br/>
Tourette&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
-=- My son is ten. He has always had less than average impulse  <br/>
control, and seems to also just have a lot more impulses than many  <br/>
kids. He&#39;s matured over the years in many ways...-=-<br/>
<br/>
How long has he been unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
-=- He&#39;s always calling his friends stupid, &quot;You&#39;re so stupid. How  <br/>
could you not know that?!&quot; But I must say, I hear a lot of the friends  <br/>
talk like this to each other too, but it does feel like he&#39;s worse.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Always&quot; is too much.  If one of my kids called a friend &quot;stupid,&quot; I  <br/>
would pull my child aside immediately and say it&#39;s not okay to say  <br/>
&quot;stupid.&quot;  That was the worst word of all at our house.  It&#39;s rarely  <br/>
said about any person or thing or idea.  It&#39;s just too negative and  <br/>
crushing, and says more about the speaker than the target.<br/>
<br/>
-=-A recent &quot;last straw,&quot; although it feels like last straws many  <br/>
days, was this weekend after his soccer game a mom of a teammate came  <br/>
up to him and laid into him, saying, &quot;Jesse, you need to stop  <br/>

<br/>
What was Jesse&#39;s reaction?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I did talk to her after, and told her I understand her frustration,  <br/>
but wished she had come to me, and not confronted him directly -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why?  She must had seen you were unable to persuade him.  She said she  <br/>
had already talked to the coach, and that didn&#39;t help either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I talked to him, and he says the kid is mean to him, always was.  <br/>
The mom said that her son has been fed up with him since early on, and  <br/>
so has since not been nice. My son *does not see* how things like,  <br/>
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you pass it?&quot; are critical and hurt people or make them  <br/>
mad.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Had you not seen the behavior earlier in the season?<br/>
Did you consider pulling him from the activity, to protect others from  <br/>
him, and to protect his own reputation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My best ideas are to talk to him about making choices, and to ask him  <br/>
to rephrase this:  &quot;He says, &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ask him what he means by &quot;kidding.&quot;   Maybe he&#39;s just not thinking  <br/>
about what he&#39;s saying.  If he says &quot;Stupid&quot; say What do you mean by  <br/>
&#39;stupid&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s parroting phrases and not thinking about what he&#39;s saying,  <br/>
that&#39;s important to know.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe talk to him about making choices, too, before he speaks.  If  <br/>
he&#39;s not able to think before he speaks, maybe he should be  <br/>
discouraged from speaking for a while, until he and you can work  <br/>
through some ideas about thinking of two choices and making the better  <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend that your son listen to this, but that you listen to  <br/>
it and think of ways to make some examples for him:<br/>

<br/>
i just wanted to say that my son, also 10, has been very similar - at times - in all the ways you mention - the impulse control, the lack of understanding of impact on others, the  mean words - AND in the &quot;positive&quot; ways - the insightfulness, sensitivity to nuance, etc.<br/>
<br/>
it is *exhausting* to say the least, to live with such a firecracker, and to help him grow and thrive while minimizing damage to relationships and most importantly, in my experience, to his own self image/self esteem.<br/>
<br/>
i agree that it shouldn&#39;t &quot;just be tolerated&quot; (although i understand how hard it is to continuously address it in a positive/proactive way), but i also wanted to say that in my experience, it was necessary to *significantly* &quot;pull inward&quot; for about a year (and still we are very selective about what we participate in) - we don&#39;t do anything, really, that puts him in a situation to be challenged beyond what he can handle and still be moderately &quot;appropriate&quot; with other people.  it&#39;s pretty easy for us because my son has no interest in team sports or groups of kids.<br/>
<br/>
i found that the constant negative feedback with regard to his impulse control issues and intense feelings was incredibly erosive to his self esteem and it fed the cycle you described of &quot;clowning&quot; and even more scornful or hurtful/aggravating behavior, because he felt uncomfortable, embarrassed, or bad about himself.  <br/>
<br/>
i have found that over time, as his life has been simplified more and more, and there has been less and less exposure to that negative feedback, he&#39;s been more and more receptive to non-confrontational, but honest conversation about my preferences for how he talks to me, etc, and, on his own, he&#39;s doing more and more self-checking, or self-correction after the fact, and can hear alternatives from me more as well.  things have gotten significantly better with name calling and other issues.  <br/>
<br/>
the last thing that i have found that&#39;s been helpful in our own home is to just be more quiet myself in my interactions with him.  i noticed that i was trying to interact/connect around things and perhaps wasn&#39;t quite hitting the mark, and he felt, maybe, misunderstood, or alone and would lash out with &quot;stupid&quot; comments.  my silent or listening presence seems much more appreciated than my joking, analogizing, or even just many &quot;normal&quot; conversational interactions.  i noticed when i tuned in i could understand the &quot;triggers&quot; for the name calling or mean words.  <br/>
<br/>
anyhow  - it never &quot;worked&quot; with my son to just pull him aside and tell him something was mean and wasn&#39;t ok.  i have always had to work very hard to understand  the *need* behind his behavior and address that, in addition to, or instead of, talking to him about the issue.<br/>
<br/>
i also wonder how long you&#39;ve been unschooling, although i know several unschooling families with similar intense kids, so although we are new to unschooling, i still think there are some temperamental/constitutional elements to this scenario as well as just parenting and school history.<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117612694">Almost a mirror image of my son, Jonathan.  He is 11 now but and a year ago<br/>
he was behaving just like this.  A year later now he is still impulsive but<br/>
MUCH less hurtful with his words.<br/>
<br/>
I used to say something but finally quit, for the most part.  When the<br/>
subject would come up naturally I would tell him how it hurt.  One time he<br/>
called me a horrible name and I cried, it was unexpected and I had never<br/>
responded like that before.  I was even more surprised by his reaction,<br/>
initially he mocked me but later let me know that he felt horrible.<br/>
<br/>
Since this he has curtailed his insults and seldom says anything hurtful to<br/>
family members, he&#39;s rude to friends his age but they seem to be the same<br/>
way.  There was only one change and that was with me, I quit the sighing and<br/>
&quot;reminders&quot; which (I realize now) implied blame and were just irritating.<br/>
<br/>
It was the only thing I was sure of at the time, I knew how the folks her<br/>
would advise me.  Be genuine, don&#39;t make up reactions in order to &quot;teach&quot;<br/>
him, give up the role of his reminder.  In retrospect it was his bond with<br/>
us that curbed his behavior and I think that the &quot;reminding&quot; and &quot;teaching&quot;<br/>
only acted as an interference with that bond.<br/>
<br/>
I had to stop protecting him from other&#39;s reactions.  He reached a point of<br/>
maturity where I knew he &quot;got&quot; why people were upset and stepped back.  We<br/>
had talked about this and I let him know that I couldn&#39;t stand between him<br/>
and the consequences of his choices.  I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t protect him<br/>
physically, just allow reality happen.  Because I was consistent by not<br/>
trying to &quot;teach&quot; or remind I think he made a realistic leap to calculating<br/>
possible reactions because he hasn&#39;t gone off on anyone outside of trusted<br/>
friends and family and very little of that.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What was Jesse&#39;s reaction?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He only said &quot;OK.&quot;  Then, when we walked away,  he said to me, &quot;I hate that kid.  He&#39;s so mean,&quot;  and went on to tell me a story of what the kid did once.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, she never said a word to me, and I had no idea there was a problem. Jesse says the coach never said anything to him.   While I obviously know Jesse can behave this way, I never heard it, and never miss his games.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; Had you not seen the behavior earlier in the season?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I did not see this behavior, except that I know how he thinks, and what he shares with me.  He&#39;s super critical, and always compares everyone.  He talks about who is the worst player, and shares his criticisms of other with us after games and practices.  He also, though, does talk about how good some players are.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did you consider pulling him from the activity, to protect others from  <br/>
&gt; him, and to protect his own reputation?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all.  Not this season or any recent season.  I see the way kids banter, and didn&#39;t know he was going too far....except for what I wrote about the one boy.  I wouldn&#39;t thought of pulling him.  To me it&#39;s not that black and white, not so glaring.  That&#39;s what&#39;s so tough about him, always has been....he&#39;s challenging, but not enough to say, &quot;Well, my son has - fill in the blank - and can&#39;t play team sports,&quot; or something.  If he calls a teammate an idiot (not saying he did) once, it might not necessitate pulling him, and not if he says it twice, but what about if he says it three times?  Do you see the difficulty?  <br/>
<br/>
I have, though, made some choices to control an environment or activity knowing it would not be a good fit, and I totally get the need to protect his reputation.  Problem is, and this refers also to Lyla&#39;s thoughts about pulling in some, and keeping her son away from many things, Jesse is and always has been what I&#39;ve called &quot;hyper-social.&quot;  He, even from when he was little, seemed to need to be out in the world, doing stuff, and being with friends.   Even if he is a bit of a bull in a china shop, it doesn&#39;t seem a viable solution to keep the bull in the house, or to keep the bull away from the activities he loves and needs.  (He needs the physical outlets, not saying he needs soccer, per se.)<br/>
<br/>
I will share with you a recent time when I considered skipping an activity I knew he&#39;d love (if it went well)  because he had some (not a lot, but maybe enough to warrant protecting others and his reputation as you say) trouble last year.  After much consideration decided to go ahead, and he had no problems.  It&#39;s hard when he&#39;s maturing, because I don&#39;t know what to expect.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My best ideas are to talk to him about making choices, and to ask him  <br/>
&gt; to rephrase this:  &quot;He says, &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ask him what he means by &quot;kidding.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know what he means.  It&#39;s his way of trying to take it back, act like he didn&#39;t really mean what he said. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe he&#39;s just not thinking  <br/>
&gt; about what he&#39;s saying.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If he says &quot;Stupid&quot; say What do you mean by  <br/>
&gt; &#39;stupid&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it&#39;s funny, because he&#39;s very bright, but he surely doesn&#39;t have a very good vocabulary for expressing himself.  Everything is gay or stupid.

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe talk to him about making choices, too, before he speaks.  If  <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s not able to think before he speaks, maybe he should be  <br/>
&gt; discouraged from speaking for a while, until he and you can work  <br/>
&gt; through some ideas about thinking of two choices and making the better  <br/>
&gt; choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, but I laughed big time when I read this.  Anyone who knows Jesse would laugh out loud too.  I can&#39;t imagine how to discourage Jesse from speaking.  I&#39;m not unwilling, I just need to know what that would look like.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336339537">Hi Lyla, and any friend of Pam T&#39;s is a friend of mine!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. I receive some much needed empathy from your post.  I will respond to some of what you said.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; it is *exhausting* to say the least, to live with such a firecracker, and to help him grow and thrive while minimizing damage to relationships and most importantly, in my experience, to his own self image/self esteem.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is huge to me, and I think damage has already been done that I did not protect him from when he was younger.  And admittedly I am sure I have inflicted some myself in my exasperation.  He went to one pre-school for a few months that wasn&#39;t a good experience.  Then he went to another where the teacher got him, and was awesome with him, but I think the feedback he got from some peers was harmful.<br/>
<br/>
Then he went to Kindergarten for three weeks or a month - I forget now - and that was really bad.  But he also has always been involved in things, homeschool groups, where he had a lot of problems in one particular group, sports where he did OK, and lots of play with neighborhood kids.  I&#39;m sure he got problematic feedback from all these experiences, but with a kid who begged for things, people, I don&#39;t know what I could&#39;ve done to sufficiently protect him.  I know I could have done some things differently, but I can&#39;t imagine that I could&#39;ve or could now, keep him away from experiences that might give him negative feedback.<br/>
<br/>
But that said, I can and will give more thought to this issue.  I used to think about it a lot more, and have thought about these things less as he&#39;s matures and gotten to much better, but maybe I need to not let my guard down.<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; i agree that it shouldn&#39;t &quot;just be tolerated&quot; (although i understand how hard it is to &gt;continuously address it in a positive/proactive way), <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a huge understatement.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;but i also wanted to say that in my experience, it was necessary to *significantly* &quot;pull &gt;inward&quot; for about a year (and still we are very selective about what we participate in) - &gt;we don&#39;t do anything, really, that puts him in a situation to be challenged beyond what &gt;he can handle and still be moderately &quot;appropriate&quot; with other people.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, as I said above, I will try to make more choices about activites more conscious with this in mind.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s pretty easy for us because my son has no interest in team sports or groups of kids.<br/>
<br/>
No the case for us at all.  Jesse may be about done with soccer - I have the feeling - after six years, but he just started wrestling, and is, so far, loving it.  He badgered me to sign him up, not that I wouldn&#39;t, he just badgered to make sure I was going to do it....and, well, because he badgers about most things...<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&gt; the last thing that i have found that&#39;s been helpful in our own home is to just be more &gt;quiet myself in my interactions with him.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the opposite would be said about Jesse.  He may, if anything, need more from me.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; i noticed when i tuned in i could understand the &quot;triggers&quot; for the name calling or mean words. <br/>
<br/>
This may be helpful for me...to see if there are triggers...maybe thing are not as random as they seem. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; i also wonder how long you&#39;ve been unschooling, although i know several unschooling &gt;families with similar intense kids, so although we are new to unschooling, i still think &gt;there are some temperamental/constitutional elements to this scenario as well as just &gt;parenting and school history.<br/>
<br/>
I think his issues are very constitutional, as you say, but our/my parenting may have not always helped....but may have also helped in some ways...he surely could&#39;ve been worse off in a strict, authoritarian home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Lyla! </span></blockquote></div>

I see this (the implied blame), and if I&#39;m capable, may want to see if this can help us, but it seems counter to what others may say - not sure yet - and so will take it all in, and see. <br/>
 <br/>
&gt;  In retrospect it was his bond with<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806622620">I&#39;ve found with my high energy 10 year old, that kind of  behavior tends to <br/>
be a request for closeness. His strong points are not social  niceties and <br/>
social cues *right now*, so a lot of what you&#39;re saying is  familiar.  For Wyl, <br/>
more one-on-one time with me, snuggling and together  time (especially at night <br/>
time) seem to be what he craves. He doesn&#39;t seem to  know how to ask for it <br/>
(or maybe even that he *is* craving it) and it comes out  in harsh tones of <br/>
voice and language. The more I try to explain or point out or  cope with it more <br/>
&quot;intellectually&quot;, the worse it gets. If I stop and give him a  big hug and talk <br/>
about what we might do together now (rarely does he want to  stop in the <br/>
middle of the day to do something) or later, the intenseness ebbs.  After a few <br/>
nights or so of intense one-on-one time, his cup seems to be filled.  I am <br/>
getting better at judging when to &quot;top off&quot; his cup before it gets too low,  but <br/>
sometimes we still need to adjust.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems that he has too much going on in his head and in his  high-energy <br/>
activities to tolerate a whole lot of snuggling and one-on-one...  Kind of like <br/>
his eating. He gets to involved to eat food that&#39;s right there next  to him, <br/>
even with suggestions, sometimes, and his blood sugar gets out of whack  and he <br/>
needs to eat some simple carbs backed up with some protein and complex  carbs <br/>
to balance it out. Eventually, he&#39;ll learn to balance &quot;go, go, go!&quot; with  <br/>
replenishment-be it emotional, mental or fuel-and things won&#39;t be so much like a  <br/>
roller coaster. In the meantime, I can help him recognize hints and warning  <br/>
signals and help him remember the solutions, and help him get the solutions. I <br/>
 also have to learn where the balance is between accepting the refusal of the <br/>
 remedy and the need to press for the remedy before things get &quot;to the <br/>
breaking  point&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
It took me a long time to &quot;get&quot; that the same old &quot;remedy&quot;  (talking it out, <br/>
reminders) was not the right solution for Wyl in these  instances, and <br/>
sometimes I still slip into them before I remember what really  works. At some point, <br/>
I may need some more trial-and-error solution-finding if  what works now <br/>
becomes ineffective... As I&#39;ve heard said before, it&#39;s all a  dance... ebb and <br/>
flow.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

he was behaving just like this.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking along these lines, too, Maura.  I&#39;m on my 2nd 10 year old boy now and I have this sense that their powerful-ness grows earlier than their ability to control it.  Kind of the way their feet grow first.  &lt;g&gt;  I have seen my kids play around with their power, relatively unconcerned with the consequences, between about ages 6 and 10.  They&#39;re getting a certain competence in the world but maybe not getting the social ramifications ahead of time.  Even with MUCH guidance, it took a certain maturing to have the power and also control it.  For my first, 11 was a big shift.  I&#39;m sure it happens at different times for different kids.<br/>

I have another question.<br/>
<br/>
What was he doing when the question was asked?  Or why can&#39;t food be  <br/>
put where he can see it and smell it without asking what he wants?   <br/>
Are meals on a schedule and is he hungry?  Was he asked to stop  <br/>
playing a video game to eat?  Is he out in the car against his well  <br/>
and then asked what he wants to eat?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when a story is brought to this list, the context is too  <br/>

frustrated, and not back before he felt like lashing out.<br/>

When parents take a problem out of the house and ignore it in public,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690249909">Yeah, I didn&#39;t phrase this well.  What I meant was that I gave up the role<br/>
of micro manager or &quot;constant&quot; reminder.  This, in no way, means that there<br/>
wasn&#39;t consistent communication, we have many and regular conversations<br/>
about his behavior and what is not &quot;okay&quot;.  The difference is that I wait<br/>
for calm and receptive moments when he can actually &quot;hear&quot; me, preferably<br/>
when HE brings up the topic (he usually WANTS to talk about negative<br/>
encounters).<br/>
<br/>
One of the main issues with Jonathan (and it seems the same with other kids<br/>
I&#39;ve known who are like him) is that they have many times when they just<br/>
can&#39;t listen, there is way too much emotion/adrenaline.  These are also the<br/>
times when they tend to lash out, it&#39;s useless to begin talking about how<br/>
other people are feeling at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do remove him from others if at all possible and have explained that<br/>
it&#39;s not fair to let people be treated badly.  He understands that I won&#39;t<br/>
invite people over if he doesn&#39;t treat them well.  But by a certain age and<br/>
understanding it has all been said and he knows what is harmful and why it<br/>
is harmful and that it&#39;s not okay.  He also knows that just because I<br/>
haven&#39;t said something in the moment does not equal my approval.<br/>
<br/>
Because of his age and understanding our conversations have moved on from<br/>
what is not okay, he knows that.  It has moved on to how words impact others<br/>
and how his actions earn him a reputation and what kind of relationships he<br/>
wants to have with people.  I tell him how I cringe when I hear him being<br/>
rude to a friend and how I try to see other kids with the same concern I<br/>
have for him, that I feel so much sadness that his friend might feel like he<br/>
really IS stupid.<br/>
<br/>
At some point kids move beyond our immediate control and they are able to<br/>
leave and see others without us.  I can&#39;t control that and I HAVE to let him<br/>
choose how things happen.  Sometimes it means that he finds friends who tend<br/>
to be rude as well and I have to hope that the glaring difference between<br/>
that atmosphere and the one he knows at home will be a motivation to choose<br/>
peaceful and beneficial friendships.<br/>
<br/>
With my oldest there were behavior issues but never aggression and she<br/>
became socially adept by age 6.  She got how to treat people and it was<br/>
easy.  Jonathan was different from day one, he was aggressive, emotional and<br/>
unaware of others feelings.  I&#39;ve had to learn to appreciate him in spite of<br/>
my own dismay and let him encounter the painful consequences of his actions<br/>
(natural not manufactured).<br/>

<br/>
This, in a round about way, gave me a new appreciation for him and better<br/>
understanding of our differences.  Our bond got stronger for many reasons<br/>
I&#39;m sure but I have to believe that appreciation comes through and the more<br/>
I value who he is without blame the more he values others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83227281"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing, though, seems to have gotten worse, his impulsive words<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and expressions. He is, so I&#39;m told by my friends, pretty good with<br/>
them, like when he&#39;s at a sleepover with them or something, he&#39;s<br/>
respectful. But at home with us, his parents and brother, he&#39;s really<br/>
tough to take. He says to us all manner of hurtful things all the time.<br/>
Examples are, &quot;Duh.&quot; &quot;Shut the frick up.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re fat.&quot; &quot;Stupid lady.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re such an idiot.&quot; And sings about his brother, at the top of his<br/>
lungs, &quot;Boogie&#39;s an idiot.&quot; And please forgive me for posting this one,<br/>
it&#39;s so crass to me, but helps illustrate the extent of this issue,<br/>
&quot;Suck my butt.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A few years back, Chamille and I were meeting another mom and daughter<br/>
for the first time, in a public place.  Chamille was behaving somewhat<br/>
aggressively towards me.  It made me uncomfortable, even though I knew<br/>
she was doing it in a teasing sort of way.  I made an excuse to find an<br/>
ATM machine and had Chamille walk with me to find it.  I asked her to<br/>
please not do what she was doing because it embarrassed me and made me<br/>
uncomfortable, and that she had probably given a very unfavorable<br/>
impression of herself to these new potential friends.<br/>
<br/>
She hadn&#39;t even been aware that she was doing something potentially<br/>
damaging.  She stopped doing what she had been doing, and we went back<br/>
and had a pleasant rest of the visit, in which she was extra kind to me.<br/>
I honestly believe that we never saw those folks again because of that<br/>
incident.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing, it&#39;s our job to help our kids navigate the social<br/>
world.  If a kid is having difficulty doing this, perhaps the kid isn&#39;t<br/>
ready to be out there so much.  If the kid is really wanting social<br/>
outlets and is still doing mean and hurtful things, the parent needs to<br/>
step in and navigate with the kid.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux tends to be more like this than Chamille ever was.  Some kids<br/>
are more empathic naturally than others.  I still supervise and oversee<br/>
many of Margaux&#39;s social interactions, there are only a few kids that<br/>
she can navigate solo.  When she starts getting mean and aggressive, I<br/>
pull her aside, lure her, or simply ask her to come with me to another<br/>
location for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
I hug her up and sympathize with the situation she is dealing with, give<br/>
her a chance to explain her frustration, then we find some ways to solve<br/>
it.  When she is calm again, she goes back to playing with her new<br/>
solutions in hand to use.  It almost always works.  Sometimes, for<br/>
whatever reason, she&#39;s too tired, too hungry, too whatever, and she gets<br/>
right back in the thick of things.  When that happens, I jump in and<br/>
take over the social situation entirely.  That could mean that I find a<br/>
different activity for them, or I lay out some ground rules that will<br/>
avoid the conflict.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I have talked to him, when he&#39;s saying he can&#39;t help it, about<br/>
 </span></blockquote>quickly apologizing, like saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to say<br/>
that.&quot; He never does that, but instead says, &quot;Just kidding.&quot; I think it<br/>
hurts him/scares him so much to have this thing he can&#39;t control that<br/>
it&#39;s hard to admit, so he instead takes on this clown nature,<br/>
everything&#39;s a joke. I personally, even though I can articulate an<br/>
understanding of how this comes to be, end up seeing him sometimes as a<br/>
jerk - who would joke *like that*; it&#39;s not funny.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only funny if everyone is laughing, otherwise, it&#39;s a bad joke.  A<br/>
good comedian can gauge his audience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I did talk to her after, and told her I understand her frustration,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but wished she had come to me, and not confronted him directly (they<br/>
have no relationship; we don&#39;t know her at all). She was very apologetic<br/>
for that, said she was just so upset that here her son was crying, even<br/>
after a game they won, hurt by something/s my son said.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the other mother had every right to do that, and I think<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s extremely helpful for kids to hear from other people, not<br/>
just their parents.  If the mother was kind about it, not yelling, or<br/>
shaming, she actually did your son a favor.  Part of getting along in<br/>
the world is dealing with other people, and for a kid that includes not<br/>
only kids, but the parents of those kids.  The other mother treated your<br/>
child as another individual, not just some kid, hence not coming to you<br/>
first.</div>

&gt; &gt; &quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have said this many times. It doesn&#39;t change his behavior.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve sent kids home and told them directly that Margaux was having a<br/>
hard time being nice and that it wasn&#39;t fair to them if they were being<br/>
treated meanly, and that clearly Margaux needed a break.  Sometimes the<br/>
break is for the rest of the day, and sometimes it only takes a few<br/>
minutes or an hour of recouping and refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; No, I did not see this behavior, except that I know how he thinks,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and what he shares with me. He&#39;s super critical, and always compares<br/>
everyone. He talks about who is the worst player, and shares his<br/>
criticisms of other with us after games and practices. He also, though,<br/>
does talk about how good some players are. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you need to have more dialog about sportsmanship and sports<br/>
abilities, and rephrase the way he says things so that he has a better<br/>
way to say things, than the very negative way that he does.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;That&#39;s what&#39;s so tough about him, always has been....he&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>challenging, but not enough to say, &quot;Well, my son has - fill in the<br/>
blank - and can&#39;t play team sports,&quot; or something. If he calls a<br/>
teammate an idiot (not saying he did) once, it might not necessitate<br/>
pulling him, and not if he says it twice, but what about if he says it<br/>
three times? Do you see the difficulty? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because other kids banter and can treat each other cruely, does not<br/>
give ANYone else an excuse to do so too.  I&#39;ve told both of my girls<br/>
that they have the power to set the tone.  Kids will follow positive<br/>
others just as easily as following negative others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but I laughed big time when I read this. Anyone who knows<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jesse would laugh out loud too. I can&#39;t imagine how to discourage Jesse<br/>
from speaking. I&#39;m not unwilling, I just need to know what that would<br/>
look like. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If your son says something rude or loud or insensitive, can you rephrase<br/>
it in a better way, or encourage him to see positive things in others<br/>
before the negative ones.  Sometimes kids, and adults, get used to<br/>
seeing what is bad about people first, instead of what is good about<br/>
people.  Everytime he says something negative you could counter it with<br/>
a &quot;maybe, but so and so is sooo awesome at ____&quot;.  Sometimes, it&#39;s true<br/>
that if you don&#39;t have something nice to say, you should say nothing at<br/>
all.</div>

&gt; &gt;&gt;No the case for us at all. Jesse may be about done with soccer - I<br/>

wouldn&#39;t, he just badgered to make sure I was going to do it....and,<br/>
well, because he badgers about most things...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is doing this, it is a clear sign that the parent isn&#39;t nearly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting comment!  My kids have started karate, and I see how it feeds my daughter in one way, but it feeds my son in a different, more primal way.  It&#39;s like deep senses get activated--the ones that are actively discouraged in all other instances in his life.<br/>
<br/>
Maura--has Jesse tried a martial art?  Maybe that would be a place that would value his aggressive energy and channel it into appropriate discipline at the same time.  My kids are LOVING learning how to fight--they have sparring once a week where they are encouraged to bring all the force they can muster to bear on the teachers--with appropriate padding and safety precautions.  <br/>
<br/>
But I have to say that I have been surprised by how encouraged aggression is, after having it be so actively discouraged in the rest of life (for obvious and good reasons!).  I can see how it takes a while for new kids to click into the zone of having it be o.k. and desirable--at first they are very tentative and try not to &quot;hurt&quot; anyone.  Then they figure out that they aren&#39;t going to hurt anyone, and in fact, that if they don&#39;t dial up the aggression, they don&#39;t progress.<br/>

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on for him.  But there may be story to something that&#39;s going on with him.....I think it&#39;s more of a personal frustration  or boredom *if anything*.  I mean, my husband will come home from work and say &quot;Hey bud!&quot;  And Jesse will say, &quot;You stink.&quot;  It&#39;s really random, inane stuff that seems to not have connection to anything....except as I&#39;ve said, boredom, and bad habit.  (Not sure I said the habit part.)</div>

&gt; When parents take a problem out of the house and ignore it in public,  <br/>

&gt; that, they aid and abet the abusive person.  They team up with an  <br/>
&gt; abuser.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand this, but I don&#39;t know how we know where to draw the line.  Aren&#39;t kids mean sometimes?  I know a lot of kids who are mean sometimes.  So when does a parent know that her child is a particular menace that warrants protecting the world?  When we let our kids out into the world - parks, parties, sports, etc. - do we really all know that they will not say or do anything unkind?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this defensively.  It&#39;s something I&#39;ve struggled with.  What can we expect the world to &quot;take.&quot;  What do we have an obligation to protect others&#39; from?  And what about the fact that many people can handle things, and some people are more sensitive to things?  How do we know that this kid in particular, or this mom, in this soccer case, aren&#39;t very sheltered and sensitive?  I&#39;m totally not saying anything he said was OK, I&#39;m just saying, wondering...we can&#39;t always judge the appropriateness of our kids behaviors by others&#39; reactions to them.  I mean, if I took a poll of the kids, or was able to hear everything they all say to each other, what if I found that most people didn&#39;t care what Jesse said, and that, in fact, a number of the kids talk like that,  would I then be OK letting him play on the team?  I&#39;m not asking these things literally, but just trying to explain how challenging it would be to know when to intercede, and how far to go.<br/>

&gt; &quot;The role of reminder&quot; implies that the problem goes on and on and on  <br/>
&gt; and on the same way, with the parent giving the same reminders over  <br/>
&gt; and over and over and over.  Part of being genuine is finding words to  <br/>
&gt; say that communicate what the problem is and WHY it needs to stop, and  <br/>
&gt; what the parent will change until it does stop.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have done all this, the explaining, etc.., but where I am stuck is this part:  &quot;and  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what the parent will change until it does stop. &quot;  Since we did away with punishment a few years ago, there are times when all the environmental manipulation (not taking him to such and such place), the talking, the listening, just haven&#39;t fixed things, and I&#39;m left not knowing what else I can do. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If I had a best friend who said  things like &quot;Duh,&quot; &quot;Shut the frick  <br/>
&gt; up,&quot; &quot;You&#39;re fat,&quot; &quot;Stupid lady,&quot; or  &quot;You&#39;re such an idiot,&quot;  I  <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t meet them in public for lunch, and I wouldn&#39;t invite other  <br/>
&gt; people over to hang out at the same time, but it&#39;s not a good  <br/>
&gt; example.  I wouldn&#39;t HAVE a friend who said things like that<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nor would I.  Don&#39;t get that choice here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;not  <br/>
&gt; without me saying clearly and unequivocably that she needed to STOP  <br/>
&gt; being that way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not saying this provocatively, Sandra, I&#39;m really wanting to understand your belief, but do you really you think if we say things unequivocably that has the power to create change in our kids?  I&#39;m not saying you are, but I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re implying that we have this issue because we&#39;ve tolerated it?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
