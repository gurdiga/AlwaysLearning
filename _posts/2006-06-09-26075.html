<div id="ygrps-yiv-807890184">Would you be interested in participating in the unschooling blog<br/>
carnival if it was started up again? Ron & Andrea<br/>
(atypicalhomeschool.net) used to run it but had to stop and I&#39;ve<br/>
been thinking about trying to get it started again.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that don&#39;t know what it is...a blog carnival is a<br/>
bunch of related blog posts on one topic, such as unschooling. It&#39;s<br/>
a great way to find new blogs, read some great posts and let other<br/>
people know about your blog. Not to mention, it kinda build a nice<br/>
unschooling community feel among the bloggers. :-)<br/>
<br/>
For now it would be held once a month (a lot of carnivals are held<br/>
every week but we can build up to that).<br/>
<br/>
All you would do is submit one of your posts on unschooling to me<br/>
every month and I&#39;ll put the whole thing together.<br/>
<br/>
Can you please reply at this link if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like to keep the replies in one place so I know how many people<br/>
are interested without having to remember all the places I&#39;m going<br/>
to post this. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Also, can you please ask on your blog? If you could direct your <br/>
visitors to the above link so they can reply, it would be a big <br/>
help.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>

Anyone know why links are being cut off?  Maybe it&#39;s part of yahoo&#39;s  <br/>
new format?<br/>
