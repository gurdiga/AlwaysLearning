<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099111540">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am in the process of learning about unschooling my daughter in September.  I just finished Linda Dobson&#39;s book The First Year of Homeschooling Your Child and found it very helpful.  I&#39;d now like to read a book specifically on unschooling since that is the approach want to take.  I also found some homeschooling magazines and didn&#39;t know if anyone could recommend one or if they were worth subscribing to.  I unfortunately don&#39;t have a lot of spare time to read so something quick and to the point would be preferred.  I want the books more for reference and support for what I am doing. I understand the unschooling concept, but my friends and family do not.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jen<br/>

The unschooling magazines are all out of business.   I&#39;ve heard (but  <br/>
don&#39;t know for positive) that Home Education Magazine won&#39;t last long,  <br/>
or might be done.    The other magazines are NOT good for unschoolers.<br/>

There&#39;s not any single unschooling book that will provide everything  <br/>
you need to know.   The best resources are<br/>

<br/>
Time spent becoming an unschooler isn&#39;t &quot;spare time.&quot;  If you don&#39;t  <br/>
have enough time to learn how to be a good unschooler, you don&#39;t have  <br/>
time to do it.<br/>
<br/>
For support, you need a list like this, and to stay on it.   When  <br/>
people leave and go off on their own, they tend to lost confidence and  <br/>
get off track and spend $700 on a curriculum and end up with kids and  <br/>
moms in tears and so if a $20 is going to make you feel &quot;referenced  <br/>
and supported&quot; enough to unschool based on no more than that, I  <br/>
recommend strongly against ANY book.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes at least as much time as a child would have spent in  <br/>
school.  Moms need to be dedicated to spending MANY hours with their  <br/>
children, doing things that make unschooling better, and not doing  <br/>
things that make unschooling worse.<br/>

I do not view unschooling as a part time thing and understand that it is a lifestyle I need to embrace.  I have started shifting my thinking and approach to parenting based on the information from this group and from what I have read.  I like having tangible information such as books to be able to reference if needed.  I didn&#39;t mean to infer that unschooling is a new hobby that I am trying out.  It is simply new to me so the more information I have on it the better I feel.  I have checked out the websites you mentioned and find them very helpful.  I find this group helpful too and am glad I joined it.  It is great to have other unschoolers willing to point me in the right direction and tell me what I am doing wrong or how to look at things differently.  I think a lot of my need for reading is to help decrease my own anxiety and fear about doing this and to have information to give the doubting relatives and friends.  I feel like I<br/>
 am literally jumping off a cliff without a parachute. This journey is exhilarating but scary at the same time.  I have to unlearn everything I know in order to free myself to re-learn a different and better way to live..  I see the books and magazines as crutches, they will help support me until I feel confident to walk this path on my own.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341688923">If you want something for relatives, Linda Dobson&#39;s Homeschool Book of  <br/>
Answers might be good.   It leans toward unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Griffith&#39;s unschooling book is good too, for that.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t count on either of them to give you everything you need to know  <br/>
as an unschooling parent, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Print out some of your favorite articles from Joyce and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
websites and favorite posts from this and other unschooling lists - keep <br/>
in a 3-ring binder. That gives you something tangible to grab and read.<br/>
<br/>
Books - there are a number of good ones, depending on your purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has a book - a collection of essays. They are great for really <br/>
&quot;getting&quot; the underlying why&#39;s and how&#39;s of unschooling. Rue Kream&#39;s <br/>
book is especially good if your interest is in how unschooling <br/>
principles apply to everything in life. If you&#39;re still trying to get <br/>
out of the school mentality, then the first half of Grace Llewelyn&#39;s <br/>
book is wonderful (Te Teenage Liberation Handbook) or even John Gatto&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Dumbing us Down.&quot; These will help you remember why you don&#39;t want to do <br/>
school. Frank Smith&#39;s, &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting,&quot; has had a <br/>
huge influence on many of us; it isn&#39;t about unschooling, although most <br/>
unschoolers who read it immediately feel that unschooling is the only <br/>
thing that makes sense in the light of what he tells us about how <br/>
learning happens.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not so much. I don&#39;t think there is such a thing as &quot;un-learning.&quot; <br/>
You&#39;re learning &quot;more&quot; - not unlearning. Other people&#39;s writing will <br/>
inspire and inform you - but you&#39;ll learn the most from your own kids. <br/>
Watch them more carefully. Try to think like them. Try to create joy and <br/>
comfort and security and lots of interesting swirling experience around <br/>
them. THAT is unschooling!<br/>
