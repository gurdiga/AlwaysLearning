<div id="ygrps-yiv-326113554">Okay, maybe he is learning to prioritize.  He came upstairs to tell me I could do something with him from 1:30 to 2:00, or my next chance would be at 3:00.  I guess it&#39;s progress.  He&#39;s learning some shows are boring.  Problem is that I was already doing something with my 10 year old daughter, and he did not want to join in.  Together they couldn&#39;t decide on a game we all three could play. After a very short time he lost patience in trying, and ran downstairs for more TV.  Makes me feel like a failure for not providing for my kids.  If it happened once in a while, I could understand - it&#39;s just life with four kids.  But it happens ALL the time.<br/>

10yo DD objected, hug her too. Hugs say something...to<br/>
all of the children. <br/>
