&quot;Steinkuehler&#39;s goal is to figure out when and how learning takes  <br/>
place in online games, and how popular games made for entertainment  <br/>
might become educational tools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t they realize the whole article is about how the &quot;popular&quot; game  <br/>
is already an &quot;educational&quot; tool?<br/>
