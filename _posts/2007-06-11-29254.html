 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you&#39;re caught in the mindset that your job is family  <br/>
maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d bet that it isn&#39;t that you don&#39;t have ideas, but that they seem  <br/>
so far down below the priority list of household tasks that &quot;need&quot;  <br/>
done that it seems indulgent and playing hooky from your  <br/>
responsibilities to exercise them. So they&#39;re really rusty.<br/>
<br/>
It might help you to see the &quot;have tos&quot; in your life as choices.  <br/>
There isn&#39;t anything you have to do. You&#39;re saying &#39;What???&quot; I have  <br/>
to clean up. I have to feed the baby.<br/>
<br/>
But wait. While the baby may need fed, you do it because you don&#39;t  <br/>
want her to starve, not because you have to. You *want* to and  <br/>
*choose* to feed the baby.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll help yourself a lot if you go through all your have tos and  <br/>
really examine them. I&#39;ve done a lot of writing about &quot;have tos&quot; Lots  <br/>
of it is at:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Check over on the right. There are two titles that specifically  <br/>
mention &quot;have to&quot; but its sprinkled throughout the writings. It&#39;s one  <br/>
of the common hurdles people have blocking their paths to unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
It seems you see unschooling as a thing you do to them (even the one  <br/>
year old).<br/>
That must just seem more of a huge burden of things you have to do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i&#39;m being driven mad by housework and baby stuff and the usual daily<br/>
grind-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could put your daughter in school (a bad idea I see someone else  <br/>
has already recommended, but I don&#39;t recommend).<br/>
If you decide NOT to put your daughter in school, then you should  <br/>
immediately rethink all of you &quot;usual daily&quot; EVERYthing.<br/>
<br/>
If, in school, your daughter would be in an environment different  <br/>
from &quot;the usual daily grind&quot; for six or eight hours, then YOU should  <br/>
provide six or eight hours of interesting activities for her.  If  <br/>
that means you don&#39;t get to vacuum or rearrange a closet, that&#39;s how  <br/>
it goes.  You shouldn&#39;t expect unschooling to fit in the spare time  <br/>
you might have if you acted like she was at school already.<br/>
<br/>
If a family decides to keep children at home, then they OWE those  <br/>
children to make it worthwhile and stimulating.  You have no good   <br/>
choices but to do that.  The other option is to be a failure at  <br/>
unschooling.  So if you&#39;re going to base your life around that, DO  <br/>
IT.  Now.  Today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438204156">-=-She would peobably love it. My daughter 4ys wants<br/>

<br/>
School is school.  You get some or most of the problems of school no  <br/>
matter how much you call it &quot;free&quot; or &quot;co-op&quot; or &quot;democratic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because the recommendation &quot;send her to school&quot; can be found in  <br/>
magazines, phone book, billboard, TV ads, and from every chit-chatty  <br/>
person at the grocery store, I would much prefer that this list not  <br/>
become a place where one of the first recommendations is &quot;send her to  <br/>
school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Children who have never been to school are rare, and sending them to  <br/>
school for a while isn&#39;t the path to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Not all paths lead to unschooling, and that&#39;s fine.   And I disagree  <br/>
with people who say &quot;School is not an option.&quot;  It sounds good to  <br/>
them to say it, I&#39;m sure (to write it in public to hundreds of  <br/>
strangers), but it&#39;s not true.  School is always an option, and it&#39;s  <br/>
infinitely better for the family if they see that option and choose  <br/>
against it every year, instead of declaring at some point that they  <br/>
will NEVER, &quot;could&quot; NEVER, send their children to school.<br/>
<br/>
That thinking of &quot;not an option&quot; makes all involved more powerless,  <br/>
more trapped, less free.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom doesn&#39;t come from &quot;a free school,&quot; it comes from making  <br/>
conscious choices and then acting on those choices.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing to unschool and then not DOING it, but waiting for it to  <br/>
start to develop on its own after all the floors are mopped isn&#39;t the  <br/>
way for it to take firm hold.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since you&#39;re new to the area, do some exploring. Pick up some local <br/>
papers and magazines and find out what&#39;s going on. Look for local <br/>
unschoolers and &quot;eclectic homeschoolers&quot; - check online but also ask <br/>
at the library and any locally-owned businesses. Tell everyone you <br/>
talk to that you&#39;re new and a homeschooler - the cashier at the gas <br/>
station and the teller at the bank. You never know when someone else <br/>
will have a resource for you. <br/>
<br/>
Go to the library or bookstore or craft shop or even a dollar store <br/>
and look for &quot;rainy day&quot; idea books. You don&#39;t have to think of <br/>
everything yourself! When I&#39;m feeling stuck I have shelves of books to <br/>
look through to get new ideas, or remember old ideas that I never &quot;got <br/>
around&quot; to doing. <br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things does your 7yo enjoy right now? If she could do <br/>
anything she wanted, what would that be? Ask her! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604722775">I just thought of a suggestion that hasn&#39;t been made here for a  <br/>
while, but used to be made pretty frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Get out of the house more.  Not out to &quot;field trips&quot; or things you  <br/>
think would be &quot;educational activities,&quot; but just out.  Walks, the  <br/>
park, watch building construction.  Watch the trash guy.  Watch road  <br/>
repair.<br/>
<br/>
Go to grocery stores you don&#39;t usually go to.  Take your slow, sweet  <br/>
time.  Talk about what you see.  Buy something you&#39;ve never tasted.   <br/>
Let the kids rearrange things in the cart if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
Go to a mall and just walk, baby-pace.  Go in any store the kids want  <br/>
to go into, and none that they don&#39;t want to.  Buy a pretzel to share  <br/>
and eat it really, really slowly.  Talk about window displays and  <br/>
signs and store logos.<br/>
<br/>
Just *be* out with your kids, at their pace.  Maybe it will last  <br/>
twenty minutes and they&#39;ll be all done.  Maybe an hour or two.   <br/>
Develop that flexibility.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an excellent suggestion. My kids right now are six, four, and <br/>
one. I&#39;ve noticed things to go better for everyone when we stop <br/>
trying to do outings with &quot;groups&quot; or even a particular friend, and <br/>
just go about our business together.<br/>
<br/>
The older two just love going to Trader Joe&#39;s. They love having the <br/>
samples, searching for the stuffed animal, picking out new things to <br/>
buy, pushing the kid shopping cart, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Once I had to stop at a music store and pick up something. We saw <br/>
that in the same shopping center there was a gymnastics center. We <br/>
went in and stood by the glass wall and watched the classes for a <br/>
while. They we walked a little further down the strip to the bagel <br/>
store and got bagels to bring home. It was nice.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I&#39;ve developed a lot of serious health problems <br/>
recently, but even that has led to some interesting things. My girls <br/>
loved to cut, sort, and count my pills to put in my weekly pill <br/>
minder. They have taken many trips with me to the lab; they enjoy <br/>
riding the elevator and watching the tech draw my blood. A couple <br/>
times we&#39;ve even gone to a nearby park afterwards. To them, it&#39;s a <br/>
fun outing with mom, not an annoying chore they have to be dragged <br/>
along to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580366497">I&#39;ve noticed my younger kids usually only talk about boredom when my head is elsewhere. <br/>
If I&#39;m present for them, it seems like they don&#39;t care WHAT we&#39;re doing, as long as we&#39;re <br/>
doing it together. They&#39;re happy to sit on the edge of the tub and talk to me while I clean, <br/>
if I&#39;m listening to them instead of thinking &quot;gotta do this, gotta do that&quot; thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I give them spray bottles of soapy water and let them do the squirting for me. <br/>
<br/>
Another good thing is to ask &quot;what would you like to play?&quot; sometimes, instead of &quot;what <br/>
would you like to do&quot; (which is also good of course, but can sometimes overwhelm a <br/>
young child--too many possibilities! And--I&#39;m in the middle of grasping this right now--if <br/>
they&#39;re used to you saying No or Not Now a lot, then they might be hesitant to put an idea <br/>
out there for fear it&#39;ll be shot down. Once they see that you&#39;re receptive to their <br/>
suggestions, the suggestions begin to come fast and thick.) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What should we play?&quot; is an exciting question. It means mom is open to PLAYING with <br/>
you--not just setting you up with something to do so she can go back to her stuff. I really <br/>
think there is nothing my 7 & unders like more than for me to play Pretty Ponies with <br/>
them, or Playmobil, or something like that. <br/>
<br/>
My older ones are more into making stuff. Sculpey, paper crafts, knitting, etc. Oh, and <br/>
baking.  I have never known a child (of any age) to turn down an offer to make cookies. :)<br/>
A 7yo can scramble eggs or make pancakes, with mom&#39;s help. My 6yo could happily spend <br/>
an entire morning flipping pancakes.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday the 6yo, 8yo, and I sat for 45 minutes watching a spider in our sunroom trap <br/>
ants. I was laughing inside, because it was like I was being rewarded for this big shift I&#39;m <br/>
making to saying yes as often as possible--earlier, I had been about to sweep that room, <br/>
broom in my hand and everything, but one of the kids asked for help with something, and <br/>
instead of my usual &quot;hang on, I need to do this first&quot; (believe me, with five kids I know <br/>
about the daily grind!!), I said, &quot;Sure, honey.&quot; And I never did get back to sweeping that <br/>
room. Which is why the spider and the ants were still there for my kids to find later. We <br/>
watched them for the longest time. There were dozens of dead ant bodies lying under the <br/>
web. If we poked the web, the spider would run around and around in circles so fast we <br/>
couldn&#39;t see his legs. He was looking for the next ant. <br/>
<br/>
Today they want me to read them Charlotte&#39;s Web. :)<br/>

school.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The &quot;send her to school&quot; response is a personal pet peeve of mine.  I&#39;ve<br/>
received this advice many times from family and well-meaning friends in<br/>
my own life.  I have three children, Julia (9), Ian (5) and a 10 month<br/>
old baby, Adam.  Julia adores being at home and proudly tells anyone who<br/>
asks that she is &quot;unschooled.&quot; &quot;Not homeschooled, UNschooled,&quot; she will<br/>
say.  Ian is autistic and caring for him, keeping him safe and<br/>
unschooling him within his &quot;special needs&quot; can be extremely challenging.<br/>
So my family doesn&#39;t understand why I wouldn&#39;t &quot;send&quot; Julia to school<br/>
because it would then be easier for me to care for Ian at home and still<br/>
&quot;manage&quot; the baby.  Nice message this would send Julia-&quot;Hey kid, I can<br/>
sacrifice your needs and send you to school over your brother&#39;s needs.&quot;<br/>
Unschooling for me is really about meeting my children&#39;s needs first and<br/>
finding other solutions to challenges in my life that don&#39;t require that<br/>
my children suffer or give up what they deeply desire and love.  <br/>
 <br/>
I really liked the previous advice about slowing down and really taking<br/>
the time to see what your kids want to do and enjoy.  I&#39;ve let go of so<br/>
many &quot;have to&#39;s&quot; and have learned to outsource (cleaning lady, lawn<br/>
guy), in order to really be with my kids.  <br/>
 <br/>
I haven&#39;t posted before because I really don&#39;t have much time during the<br/>
day (or night!).  But I am really enjoying the list.  It is wonderful to<br/>
read what all you strong unschooling parents have to say.  It really<br/>
helps me in my unschooling journey.<br/>

I recently let go of school being an option in my mind, and I found <br/>
it tremendously powerful and freeing.  School was lurking in the <br/>
back of my mind, always there as the last resort.  When things went <br/>
bad around here, I found myself thinking that maybe a little school <br/>
for a little whiie wouldn&#39;t be such a bad idea.  <br/>
<br/>
By consciously dropping that option from my mind, I was more able to <br/>
concentrate on what the real sources of the difficulties were, and <br/>
to fully focus on solutions and ways to make our unschooling <br/>
experience better for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
If my kids were to feel like school was somewhere they really, <br/>
really, wanted to go, then I would discuss that with them and we&#39;d <br/>
go from there.  But I needed to let go of the idea that I could <br/>
always &quot;send them.&quot;</div>

If children &quot;have to&quot; be homeschooled and it&#39;s not their choice, if  <br/>
homeschooling &quot;has to&quot; work because school is not an option, it&#39;s not  <br/>
freely chosen, and resentment will flow in.<br/>

If my kids were to feel like school was somewhere they really, <br/>
really, wanted to go, then I would discuss that with them and we&#39;d <br/>
go from there.<br/>
