<div id="ygrps-yiv-558986610">Two recent incidents:<br/>
<br/>
A year and a half ago, we were trying to clean up a room for it to become <br/>
Holly&#39;s room, but it had been a shared toy room and art-storage place.  So I <br/>
got all the kids to help decide what could go.  <br/>
<br/>
Some was easy--stinky paints, dried up markers, old game parts to games we <br/>
were going to throw away for being in too bad a shape, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But we had a lot of Duplo.  And we had just lately gotten to know a sweet, <br/>
cute, four year old boy named Django.  So we gave him the Duplo.<br/>
<br/>
A year later, Holly missed the Duplo.  She was pretty grumpy that it was <br/>
gone.  So (embarrassed) I contacted Django&#39;s mom to confirm, for Holly&#39;s <br/>
benefit, that yes he DID like the Duplo and played with it a lot, and that <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t let him give it away to someone else.  So when Django thinks <br/>
he&#39;s too old for the Duplo, Holly&#39;s supposed to get it back.  I&#39;m hoping that <br/>
when that time comes, Holly will be old enough to let him keep it.  Because <br/>
if he gives it to Holly, he might come to miss it too.  And his mom might <br/>
have other babies, but Holly&#39;s mom&#39;s not!!<br/>
<br/>
The other was a box of coloring books from when Kirby was little.  He loved <br/>
coloring books, but wouldn&#39;t color them all (sometimes none--just look at all <br/>
the pictures).<br/>
<br/>
I thought we had decided to chuck them.  Holly looked for them and was sad.  <br/>
Looking for something else in the garage, she found the box of coloring books <br/>
and brought some in to color in.  Super Mario Brothers. &lt;g&gt;  Lion King. <br/>
(Stuff that used to be readily available and now is antique!)  Tom Sawyer <br/>
(which makes her aske me about Tom Sawyer quite a bit, but she declines to <br/>
have me read it to her.  Maybe I&#39;ll just read her the fence chapter, or the <br/>
picnic at the cave.<br/>

Jane here:  &quot;Because at THAT time, we made the decision to pass it along.  <br/>
And somebody has enjoyed it all this time. <br/>
<br/>
But NOW, do you think you&#39;d like that?  What exactly is it you are seeking?  <br/>
Let&#39;s find a way to make it happen!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EVERYTHING, to me,  meets the definition of &#39;might be useful later&#39; - <br/>
especially with these creative unschooling minds!  <br/>
<br/>
Some architect/designer said something about holding onto things that you <br/>
KNOW to be useful or that you KNOW to be beautiful.....that is how I choose <br/>
for myself....anyone else heard of that idea or trying to implement such <br/>
ideas?  I think tied into that is a trust that what you need will come to <br/>
you.  And if friends are seeking something, I trust that their needs will be <br/>
met, too.  Just a different perspective....<br/>
<br/>
btw, I do not go through the house in the middle of the night and start <br/>
tossing books and toys!  It all happens in the light of day!  Any items that <br/>
are &#39;precious&#39; or we are uncertain about, go into the basement storage area.  <br/>
These are things that were kept in clear view in the playroom and weren&#39;t <br/>
used.  Now, on a &#39;rainy day&#39;, we can go in the basement and get a &#39;new toy&#39;.  <br/>
Any toys that the kids shrugged their shoulders about, I offered to pass them <br/>
along (or put them in the yardsale area for the &#39;save the earth club&#39;) and if <br/>
they didn&#39;t object, that&#39;s what happened.   <br/>
Same with books.  Keepers are kept - that includes favorites and reference <br/>
books.  Questionable ones may be kept out for a time.  Then if still nobody <br/>
chooses them, we make the decision to let them go.  I tell the kids, too, <br/>
that if they decide later that they want a particular book, we can find it - <br/>
library, half.com, etc....I figured it is worth passing along 3 boxes of <br/>
books in exchange for the possibility of having to re-buy some, if any, of <br/>
them....<br/>
<br/>
The space, glorious space, has become so useful!  For found treasures from <br/>
outside to be displayed.....for sword fights without stepping on blocks (or <br/>
having to pick them up!).....for stimulating creativity......<br/>
<br/>
I DO NOT mean to imply that this is something everyone should do....clearly <br/>
many of you are happy with your homes.....I write only to 1. offer my take on <br/>
the subject of &#39;doing nothing&quot;....and how I&#39;ve applied the concept of <br/>
&#39;uncommitted/unproductive time&#39; to my physical space.....AND 2. to elicit any <br/>
other ideas/support along those lines......<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day!<br/>
Jane<br/>

We do the same!  Rotating things through the basement is very useful when <br/>
living in a small space. I don&#39;t like clutter.....I don&#39;t believe in just <br/>
getting rid of things to get rid of them, AND I absolutely adore books.<br/>
