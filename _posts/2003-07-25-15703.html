<div id="ygrps-yiv-975022362">Hi All:  Just wanted to introduce myself.  My name is Sheila and I <br/>
have homeschooled my dd 11 1/2 and ds 9 1/2 since birth.  I asked my <br/>
dd and ds recently if they were excited to start school in <br/>
September.  He was and she said she wasn&#39;t.  That was it.  I knew <br/>
after much experience with trying every curriculum out there that I <br/>
better start to deschool myself and allow both of them to unschool.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been afraid because of the &quot;what should be done&quot; in my head <br/>
routine.  I&#39;m not anymore.  I read the Unschooling Handbook and found <br/>
it my favorite homeschooling book ever.  I&#39;ve just finished reading <br/>
Real-Life Homeschooling which consists of 21 different families.  <br/>
This book allowed me to find what my thoughts and philosophies always <br/>
were deep deep down.  Any story I read about the child unschooling I <br/>
loved.  When I would read about the families that used a boxed <br/>
curriculum I myself would break out in a cold sweat knowing how it <br/>
has not worked here. (Could only imagine what my daughter thinks.) I <br/>
said to my husband a couple of weeks ago, &quot;If I allowed her to <br/>
unschool - she would soar!&quot;  My husband and I discussed it further <br/>
and knew this is what we need to do.  I did not commit to this for my <br/>
children (1) to hate learning and (2) butting heads with my dd on a <br/>
day to day basis.  It seems to be that way lately and I feel down and <br/>
out about it.  SO, HERE WE ARE!  I look forward to hearing how you <br/>
Let Go and let them learn in freedom.  I intend to read, read read <br/>
and keep my mouth shut in order to learn myself and let my kids learn <br/>
in freedom.  Thanks for listening.  I plan on putting this on another <br/>
loop I joined, so if you read it twice, I apologize - just looking to <br/>
get good advice wherever I can!  Toodles.  Sheila</div>

It all new to me too , but makes so much sense..<br/>
HUH&gt;?&gt;?Last year we  had our first homeschool<br/>
adventured with my six.. THis year we are on a<br/>
unschooling adventure..The days that went best last<br/>
year were the days they led and I followed.  When I<br/>
lead it went well sometimes, but mostly turned into me<br/>
pushing and them resisting. This group is so fun to<br/>
gather stories from and people letting their kids be<br/>
kids and it helps me let go of that picture in my head<br/>
of what I was supposed to be teaching them.. <br/>
Have a great adventure<br/>
