I find the same results---just being open and honest and sharing. I also have <br/>
a fifteen year old son; our relationship is envied by all his friends. And I <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s that hard, so why is it seemingly impossible for his friends&#39; <br/>
parents? And why would they risk that relationship and that trust?<br/>

I would love to hear more about how you&#39;ve cultivated this <br/>
relationship.  Has it always been this way, or did you have rough <br/>
patches?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is only 10, but he&#39;s very independent and strong willed.  <br/>
Good traits, yes, but I tend to be a worrier and have a hard time <br/>
finding the balance between accepting his desire to be on his own <br/>
and make his own decisions (like ride his bike everywhere, including <br/>
high traffic areas, without a helmet for example) and my very strong <br/>
need to protect him.  It sometimes feels like protecting our <br/>
relationship is in direct conflict with protecting *him*. <br/>
<br/>
Another example... there was a party at the beach near us the other <br/>
day that went on past dark... a very big party with bonfires etc.  <br/>
The ocean was quite rough due to the aftermath of the hurricane, and <br/>
he was swimming and riding the waves while I was there during the <br/>
day to pay close attention in case he needed help.  I needed to <br/>
leave after dark because my 4yo was tired and cranky and 10yo wanted <br/>
to stay with friends.  That was fine with me, but one stipulation <br/>
was that I didn&#39;t want him to go back in the water again... the <br/>
combination of rough surf, no lifeguards, after dark, and the fact <br/>
that the only other adults he&#39;d be in the presence of had been <br/>
drinking and were socializing and not paying attention was too much <br/>
for me.  This resulted in a very tense argument between the two of <br/>
us, and I&#39;m alarmed that these clashes are happening more frequently <br/>
as he gets older.  The *most* alarming thing to me is his seeming <br/>
belief in his own invincibility.<br/>
What&#39;s a mother to do in these situations?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Frustrated mom moment:<br/>
<br/>
Marty is at his third day/meeting/time of a newly organized homeschooled teen <br/>
get-together thing here.  The first two times, I just dropped him off, <br/>
because Holly was with me and she&#39;s underage for that group.  Once was at the mall <br/>
and once outside a movie theater.  I saw the other moms, one I knew and others <br/>
I didn&#39;t, and I waved and smiled and drove off.<br/>
<br/>
Today it was at someone else&#39;s house, a video game playing marathon thing.  I <br/>
went in and hung out and introduced myself.<br/>
<br/>
A mom I&#39;ve known for some time was there, with her only child, a son who&#39;s <br/>
probably 14.  He&#39;s very unhappy and has been since I&#39;ve known him.  He was taken <br/>
out of school for being bullied and for being profoundly unhappy.  That was <br/>
seven years ago, at least.<br/>
<br/>
I was having fun today until his mom started in on soda.  He&#39;s only allowed <br/>
to have soda on weekends, because he needs a high protein diet and so they <br/>
don&#39;t let him have any soda on weekdays and if he has soda the sugar in it makes <br/>
him really sick.<br/>
<br/>
She said that probably faster than it took any of you to read it.<br/>
<br/>
I thanked the hostess warmly for having the kids over, and I left.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say &quot;Soda doesn&#39;t prevent a high protein diet from working, and <br/>
why is it okay for him to be sick on the weekends but not weekdays?  What <br/>
difference does it make?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known her son half his life.  He&#39;s not happier now than he was when I <br/>
met him.  He might likely be happier now than he would be had he stayed in <br/>
school all that time.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be happy if I were him either.<br/>
<br/>
His relationship with his mom isn&#39;t sensible and warm.  COULD be.<br/>
Isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was already involved in setting up a four-player game in another room, <br/>
and will walk to Active Imagination afterwards, or call for a ride.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s friend was walking up to the house as I got home.  They&#39;re playing <br/>
Barbies.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has a friend up playing video games.  In forty minutes, Kirby will <br/>
drive for the first time, by himself, to karate.<br/>
<br/>
This morning we got his provisional license, and he&#39;s on the insurance now, <br/>
and today&#39;s the day he takes my van away and I stay here.<br/>
<br/>
I trust his driving.  I don&#39;t trust everyone else.  He&#39;s never changed a <br/>
flat.  He doesn&#39;t have a cell phone.  That worries me some.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel the adrenaline in my elbows, from thinking about him driving alone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll both be fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
