took them over there and stayed with them, rather than using her as a<br/>
babysitter.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t leave my children with my mother, for a variety of what I consider<br/>
good reasons. That doesn&#39;t mean the girls never get to spend time there.<br/>

&gt; I should add that even though my mil uses this time-out chair and<br/>
&gt; chooses not to believe my children...she would never hit them, she plays<br/>

&gt; re-sizes them for dress-up play for the girls.  That&#39;s way more than my<br/>
