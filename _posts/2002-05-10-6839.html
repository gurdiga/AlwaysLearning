<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887481644">Dear Group,<br/>
<br/>
First let me state that I have never posted here<br/>
before, though I am a list member.<br/>
<br/>
My group partner is a regular.  Kelly Lovejoy and I<br/>
are co-founders of SOS, School&#39;s Out Support, the SC<br/>
Unschoolers group hosting a conference in October.  <br/>
<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, we are the only unschool<br/>
support group in the state.  Notice of the bill in<br/>
question was prominently posted on our site.  In fact,<br/>
I sent out 2 notices to members urging them to call<br/>
and email the sub-committee members.  It also urged<br/>
any members who could do so to come to the hearing on<br/>
Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
I have no interest in re-igniting the conversation<br/>
regarding this bill.  I am not an HSLDA member or<br/>
advocate.  I do know their policies and can&#39;t imagine<br/>
how it is possible to be an unschooler and comply with<br/>
their requirements. (I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m going to stir<br/>
up some dust with this statement.  Oh, well  ; )<br/>
<br/>
I would like to point out that legislation, and its&#39;<br/>
ramifications, is COMPLICATED.  <br/>
<br/>
Not to acknowledge that is naive.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned a lot about how the legislative process<br/>
works and what types of action/inaction are<br/>
appropriate re. HS issues.  I have learned mostly by<br/>
hanging out with those who have been in the trenches.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, my partner at SOS spends a lot of her<br/>
online unschool time here.  I spend mine at the<br/>
NHEN-legislative and other legally oriented sites.<br/>
<br/>
It is very easy to dismiss as unimportant what you do<br/>
not understand. <br/>
<br/>
The reasons that legislation is introduced are often<br/>
locally specific.  Sometimes they are specific to the<br/>
bill sponsor alone.  Every state is different.  SC is<br/>
not PA or FL.  Legislation that impacts homeschoolers<br/>
is not an ongoing threat in every session here. So ...<br/>
when it does come up, paying attention is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I could go into detail about why the outcome of this<br/>
particular situation was so important, including why<br/>
not having it pass or even be further considered is<br/>
important to all who homeschool in this state  ...  if<br/>
I didn&#39;t have to get ready to go to ice skating.<br/>
<br/>
But, hey, don&#39;t take my word for it.   Get to know the<br/>
climate in your state.  Research and draw your own<br/>
conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
I simply understand that my ability to do all those<br/>
things- to live the life of an unschooler-  is easier<br/>
with less rather than more legal regulation. <br/>
Additional regulation = more of my time wasted.  <br/>
<br/>
Legislatively speaking, firmly closing a door does<br/>
make it less likely to be opened again anytime soon. <br/>
The turnout on Wednesday was a display of strength and<br/>
unity in the SC homeschool community.  That&#39;s how the<br/>
legislators perceived it.  It does help us maintain a<br/>
position of influence. As an interested party, I am<br/>
more than happy with the results and believe that it<br/>
will serve us well in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
It should also be noted that the proposed bill had the<br/>
potential to impact qualification for college<br/>
scholarships that are supposed to be coming soon as a<br/>
result of the recently introduced state lottery.  Not<br/>
to mention eligibility for any/all state employment. <br/>
I&#39;m in Columbia, the capitol.  It is the largest city<br/>
in the state and a huge proportion of the jobs<br/>
available are through state government agencies<br/>
<br/>
I could go on ...  but I think that the oft&#39; quoted<br/>
&quot;All politics are local&quot; applies here, and most<br/>
everywhere re. HS legislation. <br/>
<br/>
No Chicken Little,<br/>

Sorry I did that, then.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps instead of &quot;Chicken Little,&quot; our analogy should turn to &quot;The Boy Who <br/>
Cried Wolf.&quot;  After so many false and created alarms, I have learned to <br/>
ignore HSLDA&#39;s screams for help.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad others were aware and involved then.  <br/>
<br/>
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT than the above, though, is the discussion you&#39;re <br/>
intending to affect didn&#39;t take place on this list, but on <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;First let me state that I have never posted here<br/>
before, though I am a list member.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay that you&#39;re not reading your digests. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to join that group and post your objection there, I will <br/>
reiterate my apology.  If you want me to take your post to this group and <br/>
share it with the other group, I&#39;m willing to do that too.<br/>
<br/>
It might be worth knowing that the person who brought the matter to the other <br/>
group&#39;s notice WAS supportive of HSLDA and seemed to be giving them full <br/>
credit for the action.<br/>
<br/>
(Apologies to others who are just on this group and not unschooling-dotcom <br/>
for the side-story.)<br/>

&gt; I feel a bit defensive, that just because I&#39;m not jumping on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the &quot;fight anti-hs legislation&quot; bandwagon you assume naivety.<br/>
Some of us choose to put our energy into other places in this world, <br/>
mine right now is focused on my four children and I don&#39;t choose to <br/>
be political.<br/>
That does not equal naivety.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not very grateful for people like you, that are <br/>
NOT HSLDA proponets, that are willing to fight unfair legislation.<br/>
I personally will not take up any battles in FL for a couple of <br/>
reasons.<br/>
One being that the legislators are very tight with a former <br/>
homeschool Mom, Brenda Dickinson, who is a very fundamentalist <br/>
Christian and does not propose changes I agree with.<br/>
She has strength with the legislative body here and to tangle with <br/>
all that would take an incredible amount of time and energy which I <br/>
don&#39;t have for that right now.<br/>
She proposed legislation to block kids from being homeschooled that <br/>
had a record of delinquency and truancy.<br/>
I was the ONLY person in the homeschool support group here that spoke <br/>
out against it....the only one that could see it wasn&#39;t right.<br/>
And that&#39;s legislation being proposed by HOMESCHOOLERS!!!???<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m not tangling with these deeply entrenched, semi-powerful <br/>
people at this time in my life.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t care.<br/>
Please don&#39;t assume that just because some of us question a post that <br/>
is singing the praises of HSLDA, that we don&#39;t care a bit about <br/>
political goings on.<br/>
That would be naive.<br/>
