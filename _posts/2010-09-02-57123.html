<div id="ygrps-yiv-247868313">&quot;Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life&quot;, by Rue Kream. Hands down the best book I&#39;ve read on unschooling and parenting; it completely helped turn the page for me!<br/>

      I&#39;m at the beginning stages of unschooling.  I&#39;m in the sit on my hands and watch stage and was wondering if anyone has any books to recommend while I am in this phase.  I just finished Sandra Dodd&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling and think I may just read it again and again but having a little variety that still keeps me focused would be nice.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you deschooling and trying not to direct your children? Is that  <br/>
what you mean by &quot;sitting on your hands and watching&quot;? How old are  <br/>
your kids?<br/>
<br/>
Before I can give you more book ideas, there&#39;s more for you to do  <br/>
right now than read. Give us some more info, please!<br/>

hands and watch stage and was wondering if anyone has any books to  <br/>

Rue Kream&#39;s book is linked here (and my first book, *Moving a Puddle*):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/books">http://sandradodd.com/books</a><br/>
(it&#39;s ordered directly from Rue; that&#39;s a link to her page)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want anyone to badmouth any particular books, please.    If  <br/>
you have a favorite, maybe name it.   No sense naming every book that  <br/>
ever was, but there are a few sources to read about some and decide  <br/>
which ones you might like. Different people have different tastes.<br/>

<br/>
A couple of those I have that I&#39;ve read, given away or loaned out:<br/>
<br/>
101 Reasons I&#39;m an Unschooler<br/>
ps pirro<br/>
<br/>
and Sara McGrath&#39;s book Unschooling: A Lifestyle of Learning<br/>
It&#39;s a how-to laid out in a traditional way, expanded from her nice  <br/>
treatment of unschooling at the Suite101 site:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/seminar">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/seminar</a><br/>
(that&#39;s been linked from my page for a long time, here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a> <br/>
  )<br/>
<br/>
Also you can search Amazon.com or go to the Unschoolers Emporium site,  <br/>
which is selling books and more:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theunschoolersemporium.com/">http://www.theunschoolersemporium.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Some of those sites have sound files for sale.<br/>
I have sound files free here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/listen">http://sandradodd.com/listen</a><br/>
<br/>
This list and my site are evidence that I think people should be  <br/>
helping other unschoolers freely.<br/>
Some of the books offered for sale are by people who are not on  <br/>
discussion lists, who unschooled off at the side and then wrote a book.<br/>
I really like the polished ideas that have been in the tumbler with  <br/>
other people&#39;s.<br/>
