developmental paediatrician with all my worries about autism. I had <br/>
just finished explaining to the woman that he never spoke, never <br/>
looked at anyone when he got up, said &#39;Hello lady, I like trains.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
After I picked my jaw up she smiled and said sometimes the <br/>
youngest doesn&#39;t really need to say anything with all the others <br/>
entertaining him.<br/>
She was very nice but a more pushy paed could have got it all <br/>
horribly wrong. She sat down on the floor with him and chatted with <br/>
me about toys, and wildlife. All sorts of things. She also played <br/>
with the toys herself. The same way that toddlers often play <br/>
alongside each other without acknowledging the others presence.<br/>
Sometimes I wonder whether a private paediatrician who is being <br/>
paid by the patient might have been more pro-active in finding <br/>
something wrong with R. Free medicine certainly cuts back on <br/>
that. But I&#39;m terrible cynical about doctors here.<br/>
<br/>
As irony would have it, it is my middle child who is autistic. He has <br/>
never been formally diagnosed as there didn&#39;t seem any point.<br/>

time with him?<br/>
It would probably really upset him if you took him and might make <br/>
him feel that you were not on his side.<br/>
My youngest is very self sufficent. He plays with his brother but <br/>
doesn&#39;t really need friends. He&#39;s happy if we *do* see people but <br/>
just as happy to stay home for weeks on end without seeing <br/>
anyone but family.<br/>

Liam McClure was a very late talker, and he still doesn&#39;t talk much, but he&#39;s <br/>
18 and you&#39;d never ever know he talked very little as a toddler <br/>
&quot;pre-schooler&quot; (he didn&#39;t go to school, but if he had, he would&#39;ve gone <br/>
hardly talking), and didn&#39;t read until he was fifteen or so.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known him since he was two.  He was just that way.  Had he been <br/>
&quot;labelled&quot; it would have been &quot;severely developmentally delayed.&quot;   Well... <br/>
with unschooling it doesn&#39;t much matter.<br/>

Holly was incomprehensible to me when she first started talking, but Marty <br/>
could understand her clearly, and sweetly served as her interpreter.  So as <br/>
long as Marty was there, Holly only needed to talk to Marty.  <br/>

I agree.  Maybe go to some natural place, for a leisurely hike, where you <br/>
don&#39;t have to stay right together and don&#39;t have to talk if you don&#39;t want <br/>
to, and see what he shows you.  And it might not be with words, but if he <br/>
comes to get you to show you things and wants to hear more about what he&#39;s <br/>
seen (or not), you&#39;ll be able to get a calmer, better grasp of his <br/>
communications skills, maybe.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730687225">If his behavior suddenly changed or followed an innoculation, I might get <br/>
him checked out.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t worry just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Besdies, you have my son there!<br/>
Damian didn&#39;t talk until he was 3.  His older sister did most of his <br/>
talking for him, he used gestures or he screamed in frustration/rage to <br/>
communicate!  When he did decide to speak, it was in full sentences.  His <br/>
first sentence was &#39;Me want donut!&#39; in a most imperious tone and he hasn&#39;t <br/>
shut up since.  He played alongside kids until he was maybe 5 or 6 or <br/>
something then played with them.  He&#39;s also extremely agile.  I call him my <br/>
tree-monkey or mountain-goat because he&#39;s always clambering up on <br/>
something.  ...and he can tune out like anything.  If you want to know that <br/>
he&#39;s heard something you said, you have to ask him to repeat it, otherwise, <br/>
it can look like he&#39;s heard you, but it&#39;s gone right on by.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also a bit of a control freak.  He likes to know what&#39;s going to <br/>
happen with him, what it&#39;ll be like, how long it&#39;ll take and the power to <br/>
say &#39;no way&#39; to it if he doesn&#39;t want to do it.  But then, maybe that&#39;s all <br/>
of us who are that way.  He very much likes to know what&#39;s going to happen <br/>
next, versus just going with the flow.  He doesn&#39;t like a lot of change in <br/>
routine or surroundings (unless he&#39;s causing the change!)<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s 13.  He&#39;s still a tree-monkey and tunes us out when he&#39;s busy.  He <br/>
adores things mechanical or electronic.  He doesn&#39;t like to read, but <br/>
enjoys books-on-CD.  He&#39;s brilliant at math and he has a goodly number of <br/>
wonderful friends.  He likes going to sleep-away camp and has a riot while <br/>
he&#39;s there.  He&#39;s great at interior design.  He still doesn&#39;t like a lot of <br/>
change, unless he&#39;s causing it.  If it were totally up to him, he&#39;d wear <br/>
the same shirt for a week, grungy and everything.  (I ask him to humor me <br/>
and change, please.)  He&#39;s not romantically interested in girls yet (or <br/>
boys, for that matter.)  He&#39;s incredibly bright, interested in the world <br/>
and good at video games.  He keeps trying to teach me how to play them so <br/>
we can play online together and I can&#39;t quiet manage it... maybe &#39;cause I&#39;m <br/>
not really into them.  Poor kid.  He loves chess and is always looking for <br/>
someone to play with.  ...and poker.  He&#39;s built a remote control glider <br/>
all by himself (well, with the hubby pitching in on some of the <br/>
4-hand-needing glue bits) although he still has to reverse the servos.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he&#39;s a pretty great and &#39;normal&#39; kid, and he sounds a lot like your <br/>
kid at 3.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about his behavior at this stage.  ...and if <br/>
you think you&#39;re kid is pretty great now, think of what a great kid he&#39;ll <br/>
be when he&#39;s 13!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Well, are you sitting comfortably.....then I&#39;ll begin ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I would also say that things that seem like huge problems and <br/>
issues become less so as the years go on. (Remember the <br/>
anxiety you get with your first baby about how often they pooped <br/>
and what it looked like?)<br/>
B was a very quiet baby and a shy anxious toddler but he <br/>
developed normally. Walking and talking. He had terrible excma <br/>
(sp?) which didn&#39;t clear up until I took him to a homeopath. And I <br/>
mean terrible. From the neck down he was a mass of sores that <br/>
cracked and weeped. I had severe PND plus H who I&#39;ve described <br/>
before (think Atilla the Hun) and R who was a baby so the conty <br/>
helped me with a nursery place for the older two. It was them that <br/>
first reported that he seemed odd. By the time he went to skool at <br/>
4 it was obvious. He wouldn&#39;t look at people, he screamed when <br/>
there was loud noises, he threw tantrums when I moved anything in <br/>
the house. At skool he hid under the desk much of the time and <br/>
lashed out at other kids if they were noisy. He cvouldn&#39;t cope with <br/>
strong smells or tastes. If I tried to hold him he went rigid  - like a <br/>
surfboard. You could tuck him under one arm. He couldn&#39;t bear to <br/>
be touched. Changing his nappy was an ordeal. He became afriad <br/>
of the toilet - the noise and the fact it is a big hole. He wouldn&#39;t eat <br/>
cos it made his tummy feel strange (ie.Full).<br/>
I started by saying his name when I spoke to him. Every single <br/>
time. We kept the TV volume low, didn&#39;t change the furniture. <br/>
Gradually I got him to look at me when we spoke. Nothing <br/>
aggressive but sometimes I would guide his chin so that we looked <br/>
into each other&#39;s eyes. I sat next to him at bedtime and read <br/>
stories and asked him what he thought. At first he didn&#39;t answer <br/>
but gradually he began to offer opinions about the story and <br/>
eventully came out with his thoughts about the day. A friend who <br/>
was a Shiatsu practitioner gave him free sessions. That really <br/>
helped. As did homeopathy.<br/>
When B was 6 and a half he hugged me for the first time ever. It <br/>
really was a slow gradual process of getting him to interact with the <br/>
world, to take note that there were other people in it. I always made <br/>
sure I was looking into his eyes when I spoke to him. At 6 we <br/>
bought him a kitten. He still has her and she&#39;s his best friend. <br/>
Fortunately she&#39;s one of those loyal cats and follows him <br/>
everywhere. That cat made a huge difference in his life.<br/>
B now seems almost &#39;normal&#39; but I still can&#39;t touch him without <br/>
permission. He will hug me often but dislikes being hugged back.<br/>
Taking him away from skool when he was 7 made an enormous <br/>
difference. He stopped being an angry tired little boy and began to <br/>
explore the world on his own terms.<br/>
Most of it is standing back and seeing how he likes to interact and <br/>
then responding to that. When he&#39;s tired or upset he reverts into a <br/>
withdrawn child and refuses to communicate.<br/>
Hope that helps. It wasn&#39;t very well written cos I&#39;ve never really <br/>
thought about how I did it, I just did it. It was slow and took several <br/>
years but not once did I think about taking him to see an &#39;expert&#39;. <br/>
That would have traumatised him greatly so I just followed my <br/>
instincts.<br/>

I can&#39;t find it now, but I read some research not too long ago that showed <br/>
that MOTHERS were as good or better at diagnosing their own children&#39;s <br/>
autism then professionals.<br/>
<br/>
In the article I read, it talked about how professionals questioned the <br/>
mothers/fathers about the child&#39;s actual behaviors, but tended to <br/>
completely ignore the conclusions the parents had drawn. And the parents <br/>
were mostly distrustful, themselves, of their own conclusions too.<br/>
<br/>
But - when they did studies where they asked parents, in advance of <br/>
consultation with various kinds of professionals, what THEY thought was the <br/>

<br/>
You know yourself -- if you&#39;re not a person who tends to get carried away <br/>
and worry needlessly and horribilize things, in general, then you ought to <br/>
trust your own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that if your child does have some sort of autism, the very <br/>
best response could likely be to just do what you would have done anyway as <br/>
an unschooling mom -- supporting and working with that child - accepting <br/>
that he is who he is - and building on strengths and working around <br/>
weaknesses -- that isn&#39;t any different than what you do with other kids. So <br/>
getting a &quot;diagnosis&quot; isn&#39;t  necessarily all that important unless you <br/>
think there are some sorts of services you want where a specific diagnosis <br/>
is necessary. Be careful of thinking that getting a diagnosis means that <br/>
much -- doing these kinds of diagnoses are often nothing more than giving <br/>
technical descriptions to a set of behaviors that you, as a parent, are <br/>
already familiar with since you live with him. Getting someone else to <br/>
confirm that, yes, these behaviors are happening and grouped together they <br/>
are called some technical name, doesn&#39;t really provide you with more <br/>
information than you already have.<br/>
<br/>
You can read up on autism of all kinds and what kinds of work people do <br/>
with autistic kids and you can use their ideas to the degree they make <br/>
sense to you to use with your kid - and ignore what doesn&#39;t make <br/>
sense.  You might find some ideas that will help you - but more likely <br/>
you&#39;ll find a lot that you&#39;d find entirely inappropriate. You&#39;ll have to <br/>
sort it out. BUT - trust yourself, don&#39;t just believe any specific expert <br/>
-- remember, people can find an &quot;expert&quot; to support any approach they want <br/>
to take.<br/>

I was diagnosed (after 36 hours of starvation, four big blood-draws, missing <br/>
a weekend of my 19 year old life) with &quot;borderline hypoglycemia,&quot; and the <br/>
doctor said we should run the test again.<br/>
<br/>
NO!!! No, no no, it was awful.  I was in the infirmary at the university <br/>
which is all that kept me from eating.  And I had to quit looking at <br/>
magazines and tv because of the food ads.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;WELL, if it hadn&#39;t been borderline, what would have been the <br/>
treatment?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[sad pause here for the storytelling effect...]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We would have just asked you to eat protein snacks several times a day <br/>

They tortured me for THAT!??<br/>
<br/>
So ever since then, if I&#39;m feeling that light-headed depth-perception <br/>

<br/>
No sense getting a diagnosis if the &quot;treatment&quot; is a normal, everyday thing.<br/>

And if a child doesn&#39;t like being touched, or hearing loud sounds, that&#39;s <br/>
EASY.<br/>

My son was a late talker.  We had his hearing tested and then went to a <br/>
speech therapist.  His hearing was fine, but he had a whole lot of ear wax.  <br/>
I&#39;ve never been sure if the intervention helped or if he would have picked it <br/>
all up anyway.  FWIW, at 2 he tested at the 15 month level, at 3 he tested at <br/>
the 4 year level.  I&#39;m not sure what the levels are anymore, but at the time <br/>
I did a whole lot of research.<br/>
<br/>
He started really talking through music.  We have been taking a music class <br/>
since he was 18 months old and he loves to sing.  So his first sentences were <br/>
songs.  We made up songs for everything.  &quot;This is the way we brush our <br/>
teeth, brush our teeth, brush our teeth, this is the way we brush our teeth <br/>
so early in the morning.&quot;  Even now he is interested in math and we&#39;ve made <br/>
up a scale song for addition.  So, had we kept on with just the singing and <br/>
not done the early intervention program, he might have had the same results.<br/>
<br/>
early intervention used to be a bigger business when the state picked up all <br/>
the costs.  But in the last two years, Illinois has changed the definitions <br/>
and far fewer kids are being treated.<br/>
<br/>
I had the testing done at the house, for the most part.  They evaluated him <br/>
on a lot of things, not just speech.  He didn&#39;t jump on two feet at 2 either, <br/>
for some reason.  And I was really worried about his speech.  I remember <br/>
begging and pleading with him, trying to get him to say things, crying over <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
He responded well to the therapy because he thought his therapist had the <br/>
best toys.  She was really good at picking up on what he was good at and <br/>
using it as a tool to get him to speak.  Puzzles were a favorite, for <br/>
example.  He just thought of it as a play group.  My dd and I went with him, <br/>
so we all had fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Having his hearing tested might not be a bad idea.  Or you could just stand <br/>
behind him and whisper about something he&#39;s interested in, like chocolate <br/>
chip cookies.  If you can find a good speech therapist, it really can&#39;t hurt. <br/>
 But you have to zone out all their paperwork bullshit stuff. Of course, the <br/>
state may pick it up and then you&#39;ll be part of that general filing system.  <br/>
I refused to have him tested by the school district here at age three because <br/>
I didn&#39;t really want them to know we existed.  The goals they set have to be <br/>
yours and you need to participate actively.  I would never let a session <br/>
happen without me being there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tricky dilemma.  I remember reading a book, which may have been called <br/>
something like Late Talkers, which put my mind at ease.  Not all kids are <br/>
social, they all have different strengths.  And many late talkers tend to be <br/>
logical, mechanical, scientific types.  I think Einstein may have been a late <br/>
talker.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42089681">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group but i thought i&#39;d give you my 5 cents worth of<br/>
experience on this one!<br/>
My youngest was also like you describe your boy. I went to a speach language<br/>
therapist who suggested autism, but i&#39;ve never gone down the path of a<br/>
clinical diagnosis. They also cannot accurately diagnos an autistic spectrum<br/>
child until they are older anyway ( and I still havn&#39;t gone down the path).<br/>
At your stage we concentrated on speech as this is essential for future<br/>
prognosis and were advised to use single words when speaking and playing<br/>
with him (the rest of us are prone to verbal excess), not to ask questions<br/>
of him. If language computation is taking it&#39;s time this is too much info to<br/>
locate. It comes in time.<br/>
Boys use one side of their brain to compute language where girls use two<br/>
sides thats why language delays are more common wih boys. Basically build on<br/>
what he&#39;s already got, and the child in front of you. (Our usual parenting<br/>
skills anyway!!)<br/>
 I wish I never told anyone I know, even in the homeschooling circles as<br/>
people do treat him differently, and I found that listening to the<br/>
proffessionals too much went against my instincts and made life harder for<br/>
him and us in the end.<br/>
Socially, lots of kids that age still parrallel play. We assisted him to at<br/>
least look at what others were doing (a useful tool was to track my finger<br/>
across his path of vision and that would drag his eyes to whatever i wanted<br/>
to point out). Keeping socialising to small numbers helped, thats where<br/>
homeschooling is perfect. I wish I had done it then.<br/>
All things change with age.<br/>
Listen to your instincts. Let me know if you&#39;d like to know anymore actual<br/>
activities that helped. ( by the way does he love Thomas the Tank Engine?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-956753684">When did he turn 3? My oldest was a later talker (2.5) and I know it can be<br/>
worrying. <br/>
But the things you are describing seem to indicate a problem bigger than<br/>
just late talking. The way he plays can show levels of development and if<br/>
he isn&#39;t really able to interact socially then there may be more going on.<br/>
<br/>
As others have said parents are often the best judges of their children and<br/>
if &quot;you&quot; are worried that there is a problem then there is a good chance<br/>
that there may be (especially since he&#39;s your 4th child).<br/>
<br/>
Again as others have suggested I would try and find a developmental<br/>
psychologist or therapist who is supportive of AP or HS (or at least<br/>
familiar with it). You can always interview them before taking your child.<br/>
Ask questions that &quot;test&quot; how this person would handle things. There are<br/>
some really great psychologists out there and they truly want to help. But<br/>
you have to do your work as well by finding one who is in sync with your<br/>
beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
Some of these problems may be lessened as he grows older but if he truly<br/>
does have a problem then it makes more sense to try and get him (and the<br/>
family) some good help. If he had a physical problem you would seek help so<br/>
it should be the same with something like this IMO!<br/>
<br/>
Kate -- who as a child psychologist is probably a little biased:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684659388">I&#39;m almost embarrassed to admit this because of the mixed reaction of <br/>
television viewing but one of Daniel&#39;s favorite things to do is watch videos. <br/>
 He&#39;s not usually interested in television programs unless it&#39;s Teletubbies <br/>
but he loves his videos (elmo, teletubbies, raggedy ann & andy, little bear, <br/>
peanuts etc...)  He likes to match the covers with the video (that was before <br/>
they became all worn and/or lost.)  Sometimes all he wants to do is watch the <br/>
previews at the beginning but usually it&#39;s related to another video or <br/>
pictures in a book.  I know he can read all the titles. Remember there are no <br/>
covers anymore. Some days he gets on a kick where all he wants to do is watch <br/>
a particular &quot;genre&quot;.  Some videos he may not like part of so he leaves the <br/>
room just outside the door until that part is over and comes back.<br/>

I&#39;m new to your list. We are unschoolers and non-coersive parents.<br/>
Okay, so we really try anyway!<br/>
Our son is 9, but on any given day appears to be 3 or 30. We pulled him out of third grade last year in frustration and anger. Why we ever thought it was a good idea to send him to school in the first place, I attribute to our own compulsory education and midwestern work ethic. Friends and family generally think we&#39;re nuts and a little radical, but that&#39;s the idea, isn&#39;t it?? LOL!<br/>
So, it will be nice to sit in with some like-minded folks and feel understood and supported. I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know all of you!<br/>
