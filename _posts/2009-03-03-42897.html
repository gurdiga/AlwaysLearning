<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476775191">Wyl (10 next month) was asking me questions from the back seat  a week ago. <br/>
The first one being, &quot;Mama... What&#39;s pot do?&quot; Not being exactly sure  what he <br/>
was talking about and wanting to buy time, I said, &quot;Cook broccoli?&quot; That  was <br/>
definitely not the &quot;pot&quot; he meant. &quot;No, I mean the drug.&quot; Hmmm... well, we  had <br/>
a frank series of questions and answers (involving words like &quot;pot,  <br/>
&#39;shrooms, smack, blow&quot;) and I tried to be as wide-ranging as I could in the  moment (I <br/>
really was not expecting this kind of talk already, nor from this  angle), <br/>
touching on illegal/recreational drugs, addiction, unpredictability, the  money <br/>
involved in illegal drugs and a few other things that aren&#39;t coming to  mind <br/>
now. It all went pretty well, I think, except very near the end when he  said, <br/>
&quot;So, you&#39;ve never taken drugs, Mama?&quot; I felt like a lug, sidestepping the  <br/>
issue, but I said, &quot;I take drugs every day, Wyl. Each morning, I take my  <br/>
synthroid medication.&quot; I knew that&#39;s not what he meant and I bet he suspects at  <br/>
least a teeny bit that I was sidestepping, but I wanted to get some input from  <br/>
others, first.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t want to pass along the idea that it&#39;s harmless or  perfectly fine to <br/>
smoke pot because &quot;Mama did when she was younger&quot;, but I  definitely want to <br/>
be honest, too. I didn&#39;t have any horrible experiences to set  a &quot;warning&quot; on <br/>
(if I even wanted to do that, but it seems preachy at any rate),  and I really <br/>
wasn&#39;t up for discussing it with Storm (4) sitting right beside  him. Maybe <br/>
that&#39;s heeding old tapes, I don&#39;t know...  I thought about  treating it as I <br/>
would alcohol, nicotine and other things that have *always*  been part of our <br/>
conversation-or at least for as long as I can remember... but  those things <br/>
aren&#39;t illegal. I&#39;m unsure if that makes a big difference or not...  It&#39;s taken me <br/>
a while to ask, because I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to ask the  adults here or <br/>
the kids on Cameron&#39;s &quot;Offspring&quot; group, but since there are so  many youngers <br/>
there, I figured here was better. I&#39;m not really scared or  anything, just <br/>
uncertain, so I thought I&#39;d ask for some guidance and words of  wisdom. Thanks.  <br/>

Thanks. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t ask it there, because it&#39;s one thing for parents to know  <br/>
their kids use pot and not &quot;Do anything about it&quot; but it&#39;s a whole  <br/>
different thing for other people to ask them to put it in writing in  <br/>
public.  Kids (even teens and young adults) don&#39;t always know the  <br/>
potential dangers of that sort of information being in public.   And  <br/>
in some states it&#39;s barely illegal, and in some states you can be put  <br/>
in prison.  Arizona&#39;s very bad.  Last I knew, if a man was put in  <br/>
prison in Texas, he&#39;s circumcised (if he isn&#39;t already).  I don&#39;t know  <br/>
if it&#39;s still true, but this is BIGtime.<br/>
<br/>
So please don&#39;t be asking for any details like who&#39;s said and done  <br/>
what that&#39;s illegal.   it&#39;s probably better discussed in person, in  <br/>
private.  Seriously.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would alcohol, nicotine and other things that have *always* been part<br/>

 </span></blockquote>things<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; aren&#39;t illegal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They are just as illegal for a kid as other drugs are!  I&#39;ve had a lot<br/>
of conversations about drugs and alcohol with both of my kids, and some<br/>
of it has revolved around the prohibition.  What makes some things legal<br/>
and not others, what made people think alcohol needed to be banned?  Did<br/>
it work?  How has it impacted society?  Is it fair to tax cigarettes?   <br/>
Are cigarettes bad and why is it, is it tobacco, or is the fact that it<br/>
has severe health impacts for a lot of people?  Then we can look at all<br/>
the relatives we have personally that smoked until they were very old,<br/>
with no ill health effects related to smoking.<br/>
<br/>
I live in OR and maybe that makes a difference and maybe not, but pot is<br/>
very available.  If I wanted to buy some tomorrow, I could easily do it.<br/>
I know many many people that smoke it and a lot of people grow it around<br/>
here.  Most of them aren&#39;t highschool kids, they are working<br/>
professionals with degrees.<br/>
<br/>
The war on drugs really hasn&#39;t done anything to curb drug usage, in<br/>
fact, the way I see it, it&#39;s made it worse and more dangerous.  The new<br/>
era of drug use is all legal anyway, pharmacueticals are much bigger<br/>
with the younger generation than cocaine.  That started in the 80&#39;s, I<br/>
think, and just continued to get bigger and more popular as it was<br/>
easier to attain.<br/>
<br/>
Watch the movie &quot;Blow &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221027/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221027/</a>&gt;  &quot;.  Well,<br/>
preview it first, it&#39;s pretty intense.  It&#39;s a good drug movie, one that<br/>
sparked a lot of questions and understandings about drug culture.  (And<br/>
it has Johnny Depp in it.... so of course it must be good right?)<br/>
<br/>
Another drug movie, Party Monster, really showed the whole rise and fall<br/>
of drug use, in the 80&#39;s rave fashion, clubbing world.  I don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily recommend that one for a number of reasons, but my daughter<br/>
loved it.  It has a lot of very graphic drug and sex things in the<br/>
movie.  (it&#39;s a true story too.)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good way to approach it--side by side rather than face to  <br/>
face, maybe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Easy Rider is very drug-heavy.<br/>
Holly likes Dazed and Confused.<br/>
<br/>
You could talk about what&#39;s going on in the movies, and connect it  <br/>
lightly to stories you know, without a full-out confessions of  <br/>
everywhere and with whom you ever engaged in anything illegal.<br/>
<br/>
The first few times my kids asked anything, I was directly vague.  I  <br/>
said &quot;Lots of people did in the 60&#39;s&quot; or &quot;Some people lived through  <br/>
the 60&#39;s and never touched it.&quot;  True statements.    They used to stay  <br/>
with relatives sometimes, where it was out in a tray on the table all  <br/>
the time (pot, not cocaine) and the kids never knew or cared or asked.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said the first time he was around anyone smoking marijuana he  <br/>
laughed, because he totally recognized the smell from his dad&#39;s  <br/>
friend&#39;s house and related outings and places.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the &quot;I&#39;m in Oregon&quot; attitude, because New Mexico has  <br/>
never been very scary, but we&#39;re nestled between Arizona and Texas,  <br/>
and too many locals become complacent here and get in SERIOUS trouble  <br/>
passing through AZ or TX.  A friend of a friend is in jail in Texas  <br/>
right now, partly because of having a sword.  Texas also has bizarrely  <br/>
strict weapons laws.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of aspects of the question can be discussed without personal  <br/>
revelations.<br/>

No, I had already decided not to ask there, but I was talking  more <br/>
theoretical in what I was considering (and thought better of), such as: how  would you <br/>
feel if your parents told you they had done something like smoke pot  when <br/>
they were younger, before you were born? Not asking people about their  personal <br/>
experiences, more theory and feelings and trust and that sort of thing.  But, <br/>
I won&#39;t post there.<br/>
 <br/>
Good idea to put that out there, though, for those that don&#39;t  know and for <br/>
people like me, who tend to have it on the back burner and  sometimes forget.<br/>

<br/>
Though there can be a curiosity about the experience of others, the best<br/>
answers to such questions don&#39;t seem to be about individual experiences.<br/>
With movies, true or fictionalized, a child can feel free to accept or<br/>
reject the behavior or opinion of people on drugs.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more at stake when hearing about the experience of those a child<br/>
knows and/or is very close to.  A child may not really want to know that<br/>
even if they wonder.<br/>
<br/>
The questions are aimed at finding out basic info, if it&#39;s a big deal or<br/>
not, if it&#39;s worth it, etc.  All of which I don&#39;t think are answered by<br/>
personal confessions or stories about one&#39;s experience.  Experience is<br/>
highly subjective in the first place, and I think memories can be even more<br/>
subjective.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this book is for someone Wyl&#39;s age, yet it helped me to put<br/>
some things into perspective about drug use that I had been confused on for<br/>
a while:* *Over The Influence: the harm reduction guide for managing drugs<br/>
and alcohol by Patt Denning, Jeannie Little, Adina Glickman.  It&#39;s an<br/>
even-handed sane book about an oversensationalized subject.  Maybe a book<br/>
for a parent to read or skim through for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I like the movie idea that Sandra mentioned.  And anyway, as prevalent as<br/>
drug use is, everybody probably knows of people in one&#39;s community whose<br/>
lives have been impacted by risk behaviors associated with drug use, and<br/>
other experiences of that nature, right?<br/>

day I am sure, being that we have 4 kids.  A few days ago I asked my <br/>
oldest (7) what he would do if someone offered him a cigerette.  We <br/>
were talking about different situations and good responces to them.  He <br/>
said, &quot;smoke it&quot;.  I was a little surprised and asked him why, to which <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978611433">i personally think that when kids ask, they are ready for info - honest info.  and i have always been honest and answered questions my kids have asked me about my past, but always qualifying it with more information.  i also think we are seen as more knowledgeable and a good source of info if we are open about our personal experiences - as long as we aren&#39;t glorifying it...just providing information, like with any other subject.  i have also found that, almost without fail, if my daughter brings something up  - asking me if *i* have ever done something in particular - it almost always means she is encountering that same something in her life- either in reality or in conversation or reading, etc. - and is needed help thinking about it and exploring it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163345976">Warning: some very very sad stuff.  And some emphasis on the importance of<br/>
information vs. opinion sharing.<br/>

<br/>
A family member who was on drugs for years died young.  His biological mom<br/>
rejected him and, no small thing either, he had muscular dystrophy.  My<br/>
guess is that he was also self medicating to replace treatment for his<br/>
condition that he despised as well as for mental health reasons.  He spent<br/>
lots of time in and out of various prison hospitals for burglary and things<br/>
of that nature.  His adopted mom wished she knew anything he could do to<br/>
decrease the risk involved in doing drugs.  She spent a good bit of time at<br/>
her wit&#39;s end.  She just wasn&#39;t part of that world and didn&#39;t have the<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
I ran into the same thing, being concerned for people I care about.  I<br/>
wanted to know what I could do to protect myself better and help them if<br/>
possible.  Turns out that there are some options.<br/>
<br/>
Personal experience is enough info if it answers problems like the above.  I<br/>
would hazard a guess that most people who have some experience probably<br/>
don&#39;t know enough for their experience to be of much informational value.<br/>
It&#39;s great for sharing personal values and opinion.  That&#39;s not always<br/>
enough though.  Which is why I posted the name of a book that did help me.<br/>
It has good information.  Information that might help some people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857849499">You watch Family Guy, I see on a separate post -- watch the Toad Licking<br/>
episode together ;) lots of fodder for this very conversation.    ::vbg::<br/>
<br/>
I started the drug talk pretty early in our house, too. For me, it&#39;s kind of<br/>
informed consent in our everyday consumption (and I thought I was being<br/>
informative... these were the years before unschooling found me ;)) - Mama&#39;s<br/>
Red Can contains drugs, pure and simple. Caffeine is a strong stimulant, it<br/>
is indeed a drug. (and it helps one poop!) Common - yes, accepted - yes, not<br/>
talked about - sadly, yes.  I don&#39;t use the term &quot;drugs and alcohol&quot; because<br/>
alcohol *IS* a drug, a very fun-at-times depressant. Drugs are drugs are<br/>
drugs. Different effects in different doses in different situations in<br/>
different people at different times in life.  That&#39;s a truth.  Drugs are<br/>
everywhere, hypocricy about drugs is everywhere. Truth is the best thing you<br/>
can offer. With a balance of information, pros and cons.  Just as I think<br/>
that Sex Information *is* birth control, I think Drug Information is<br/>
personal responsibility.  If one says Cocaine kills (as it has) and someone<br/>
witnesses cocaine use that *doesn&#39;t* result in death. That statement is an<br/>
lie of omission - it&#39;s not full of useful information with which one can be<br/>
expected to make a reasonable responsible personal decision.  In that<br/>
instance any previous wisdom shared is moot.<br/>
<br/>
Then the societal component is the government of the United States has<br/>
decided that instead of allowing the people access to all the drugs there<br/>
are, some drugs are forbidden.  This can lead to a conversation about hemp<br/>
in america, levi-strauss, Howard Hughes, the cotton industry, the FDA<br/>
(nutrasweet vs sativa is a good story) OPEC, NORML, Christopher Columbus<br/>
(who&#39;s sails and ropes were of the finest european hemp), Amsterdam, the<br/>
farmers of the midwest during the war were paid to grow hemp, hemp is grown<br/>

I&#39;m very matter of fact. Hayden&#39;s experienced a lot of different situations<br/>
in his life, he&#39;s asked questions, he&#39;s gathered answers, he has plenty of<br/>
anecdotal information with which to make his own decisions when that time<br/>
comes.  I imagine I will be a large part of the decision to use process.<br/>
I take great care to not be hypocrytical with my information. I&#39;m honest<br/>
(and age-appropriate) and I use the term medicate when talking about any<br/>
drug use - aha! yet another 12 billion connections with the true medical<br/>
value of most illicit drugs :)  Coca-cola had cocaine, to help housewives<br/>
have enough energy to do the ironing happily. Opiate-sythetics are used<br/>
medicinally (because they can be pantented and profited from) and are quite<br/>
popular by prescription.  Hell, even heroin has it&#39;s benefits; I *can*<br/>
imagine the kind of pain required to desire the relief from Heroin. I didn&#39;t<br/>
do it, I&#39;m scared to death of it, I&#39;m not willing to commit my LIFE to it,<br/>
but by golly, I&#39;ve been so deep in the barrell of pain I *wanted* the sweet<br/>
relief it I knew I could provide, if only temporarily.  I&#39;m far past that<br/>
now, it was a quick and powerful moment in my life.<br/>
We went to a going away party for Scotty, when we moved. I told Hayden (then<br/>
8) it was a Keg and informed him folks would probably be standing around<br/>
smoking pot.  Our car ride home conversation:<br/>
H: There were drugs at the party<br/>
D: That&#39;s why we told you beforehand...<br/>
H: No mom, not just beer and pot, there was cocaine and acid.<br/>
D: Really?! How do you know? Did you see it?<br/>
H: No, in the kitchen someone said, &quot;you shouldn&#39;t combine cocaine and<br/>
acid&quot;  ... why not?<br/>
D: Well cocaine creates a euphoric high, with lots of energy and acid<br/>
creates hallucinations which may be tough to deal by themselves, let alone<br/>
when you&#39;re possibly jittery from the coke.  Not a safe experiment,<br/>
necessarily.  Coke&#39;s pretty easy to overdose on, one must be really careful<br/>
if they&#39;re using.<br/>
H: Cool.  So when we get home, can we.... [off to another subject]<br/>
<br/>
It does help to be in Oregon :) I like to say in our town, if you dont&#39;<br/>
smoke pot, you probably live downwind from someone who does :D<br/>

&gt; he<br/>
&gt; was talking about and wanting to buy time, I said, &quot;Cook broccoli?&quot; That<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; definitely not the &quot;pot&quot; he meant. &quot;No, I mean the drug.&quot; Hmmm... well, we<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; a frank series of questions and answers (involving words like &quot;pot,<br/>
&gt; &#39;shrooms, smack, blow&quot;) and I tried to be as wide-ranging as I could in the<br/>
&gt; moment (I<br/>
&gt; really was not expecting this kind of talk already, nor from this angle),<br/>
&gt; touching on illegal/recreational drugs, addiction, unpredictability, the<br/>
&gt; money<br/>
&gt; involved in illegal drugs and a few other things that aren&#39;t coming to mind<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; now. It all went pretty well, I think, except very near the end when he<br/>
&gt; said,<br/>
&gt; &quot;So, you&#39;ve never taken drugs, Mama?&quot; I felt like a lug, sidestepping the<br/>
&gt; issue, but I said, &quot;I take drugs every day, Wyl. Each morning, I take my<br/>
&gt; synthroid medication.&quot; I knew that&#39;s not what he meant and I bet he<br/>
&gt; suspects at<br/>
&gt; least a teeny bit that I was sidestepping, but I wanted to get some input<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; others, first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to pass along the idea that it&#39;s harmless or perfectly fine to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; smoke pot because &quot;Mama did when she was younger&quot;, but I definitely want to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; be honest, too. I didn&#39;t have any horrible experiences to set a &quot;warning&quot;<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; (if I even wanted to do that, but it seems preachy at any rate), and I<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t up for discussing it with Storm (4) sitting right beside him. Maybe<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s heeding old tapes, I don&#39;t know... I thought about treating it as I<br/>
&gt; would alcohol, nicotine and other things that have *always* been part of<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; conversation-or at least for as long as I can remember... but those things<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t illegal. I&#39;m unsure if that makes a big difference or not... It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; taken me<br/>
&gt; a while to ask, because I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to ask the adults here or<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the kids on Cameron&#39;s &quot;Offspring&quot; group, but since there are so many<br/>
&gt; youngers<br/>
&gt; there, I figured here was better. I&#39;m not really scared or anything, just<br/>
&gt; uncertain, so I thought I&#39;d ask for some guidance and words of wisdom.<br/>

I agreed and expanded, but it was someone else&#39;s original mention.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-And anyway, as prevalent as<br/>
drug use is, everybody probably knows of people in one&#39;s community whose<br/>
lives have been impacted by risk behaviors associated with drug use, and<br/>
other experiences of that nature, right?-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Impacted&quot; is too light a word.  Ruined.  Destroyed.  Killed.<br/>
<br/>
Yet my own personal stories are all flowery peace&#39;n&#39;love and non- <br/>
disasterous.  So my personal recollections don&#39;t make it seem nearly  <br/>
scary enough.  The side stories of friends homeless from crack and  <br/>
speed...   killed in drug deals (more my sister&#39;s friends on that  <br/>
list).   NOT making it seem good.<br/>
<br/>
I think discussions based on fictional characters are safer, socially  <br/>
and legally. I think factual non-sensationalized neutral information  <br/>
is better than photos of death or stories of having the giggles two  <br/>
hours into an LSD trip in a safe environment.  None of the old-days  <br/>
stories matter anymore anyway, because the prices are way high and the  <br/>
stakes are even higher, for dealers now.  We&#39;re close enough to Mexico  <br/>
here that the danger of the wars in Juarez aren&#39;t  very foreign or  <br/>
distant.<br/>

nephew, for example, who is hooked on Heroin.  Chances are, not the first<br/>
mind altering chemical he tried - H isn&#39;t known as much of a gateway drug.<br/>
So perhaps he was told, as I&#39;m sure he lived through life after Nancy<br/>
Regan&#39;s Just Say NO campaign with the rest of us: Drugs are Bad.  Then he<br/>
went out into the world and he tried some drugs that really weren&#39;t so bad,<br/>
in his experience; maybe a beer here, a joint there. So he&#39;s lost faith in<br/>
those who told him Drugs are Bad in general terms, without truly discussion<br/>
drugs with names and their effects and with honesty and connection in a<br/>
loving relationship with a parent (or other super trusted adult). If those<br/>
same Drugs are Bad people try to warn him away from Heroin, where is their<br/>
credibility? They&#39;ve already lied by omitting the true information about the<br/>
Bad Drugs of which they spoke. That credibility is very important to me. I<br/>
want to be honest and open, information is power. At least, should Hayden<br/>
use, I will be comfortable in knowing he is informed. At our house, Heroin<br/>
is described as a lifetime commitment, not a recreational toy. We&#39;ve talked<br/>
of the heroin program in Amsterdam. You&#39;re not alone in wishing your nephew<br/>
had lived a happier life, one without the need for this powerful<br/>
medication.  I hope he finds the salve he needs to heal his underlying<br/>
wounds.  Is this the musician nephew?<br/>

substance which were kept a mystery to me by my own folks who honestly<br/>
probably had little knowledge themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The risks I alluded to are not limited just to one&#39;s own bodily harm.  The<br/>
risks to one&#39;s pocketbook, of relationships with others who might turn you<br/>
in, to one&#39;s sanity, one&#39;s freedom, of being controlled by others who put<br/>
one in to dry out or whatever against one&#39;s will (which may not take), of<br/>
prison sentencing, of limiting oneself and the kinds of people one can<br/>
befriend or love.  Also the risk of not being such a good social outlet for<br/>
people who need a social life and happen to get involved with what one is<br/>
doing because it&#39;s there (like Mount Everest) or because one insists in<br/>
order to get funds for one&#39;s substance.<br/>
<br/>
The risk to one&#39;s children who go without food, shelter, clothes, stability,<br/>
happiness and friends in favor of a substance.  For a parent, I don&#39;t see<br/>
any benefit there to outweigh those particular risks. Feeling unable to<br/>
break away for oneself or those one loves because one doesn&#39;t realize it&#39;s<br/>
possible to control the level of involvement with a substance so that the<br/>
quality of life doesn&#39;t go all the way to nonexistent.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t subscribe to the theory that pot is a drug gateway.  People can be<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different if people aren&#39;t getting messed over and take good care of<br/>
themselves<br/>
<br/>
All kinds of risks that at first blush may not be on a person&#39;s mind as they<br/>
partake and imbibe.  Some risks which they only come to know after building<br/>
a social life and way of living that isn&#39;t very easy to change after one<br/>
figures out some of the more insidious problems it entails.<br/>

&gt; smoke pot because &quot;Mama did when she was younger&quot;, but I  definitely want to <br/>
&gt; be honest, too. I didn&#39;t have any horrible experiences to set  a &quot;warning&quot; on <br/>
&gt; (if I even wanted to do that, but it seems preachy at any rate),  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The ambivalence here doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.  There is clearly a part of you that wants to express caution or warnings about drugs.  This is valid in the spirit of honesty.  I&#39;ve let my son, who has asked, know that for some people they can lead to addiction, misery and death--although some people can use them and not experience this.  But it is very real--it&#39;s not someone&#39;s paranoid fantasy.  Just because that wasn&#39;t your personal experience doesn&#39;t make it less valid that some people get in trouble with them.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because you haven&#39;t been personally hit by a car crossing the street (I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t, but I could be wrong), or maybe haven&#39;t even seen anyone ever been hit by a car, isn&#39;t going to cause you to express less caution to your children about the possibility.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had lots of discussions with my children, but in my case I&#39;ve had close family members devastated (and dead) because of drugs, so I don&#39;t feel any need to pull any punches in this area.  I keep our conversations to what they want to know and can handle, so I&#39;m not overwhelming them, but I&#39;m definitely letting them know that there are risks with both the illegal and addictive natures of various drugs.  As in all other areas of our relationship, I honestly share the experience, information and perspective that I&#39;ve acquired.  And we talk about the deeper reasons that someone may be susceptible to doing and relying on drugs.<br/>

<br/>

We&#39;re all wanting to present lots of information to our kids, and I think that the op was really looking more for perspective than whether or not to share information.  Hopefully we&#39;re all past &quot;Just Say No.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok.  I&#39;ve really said enough on this subject.  I&#39;m revisiting the<br/>
thread one more time to put the description of this book with the<br/>
title.  I&#39;m sure there are similar books out there.  This just happens<br/>
to be the one I found.  Most sources I&#39;ve come across either totally<br/>
recommend drugs or totally (and unrealistically) push the &quot;just say<br/>
no&quot; thought.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link at Amazon books if you can&#39;t find it in a library and<br/>
want to peruse it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/dl2gyd">http://tinyurl.com/dl2gyd</a> or just click on the book<br/>
image to read the first pages.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a review that describes what the book is about:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Over the Influence is not only the best-named book about recovery<br/>
from drug and alcohol addiction, it is also the best written, most<br/>
concise, and most emotionally real of all the books in the field.<br/>
Denning, Little, and Glickman translate the controversial concepts of<br/>
harm reduction into practical guidelines for people who want to<br/>
improve their lives--whether or not they achieve abstinence.&quot;--Lonny<br/>

<br/>
If a parallel can be made about kids learning to read in school, or  <br/>
out of school, that creates &quot;a lie of omission,&quot; then let&#39;s talk about  <br/>
it some more.<br/>
<br/>
Unless someone has sworn she&#39;s stated all she knows, under oath, in  <br/>
court, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any such thing as &quot;a lie of omission.&quot;   <br/>
Even in the court otah, it&#39;s the statement that&#39;s a lie, not the lack  <br/>
of information.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about anything here except being careful with words  <br/>
and ideas.  I don&#39;t even know who&#39;s been quoted above.<br/>
