<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523004530">Hi Laurie..<br/>
This is my first year to make &#39;real&#39; cheese, like mozzerella and Chevre. Its<br/>
not difficult at all, you just need a few special pieces of equipment..then<br/>
patience, and lots of stirring , watching the temperature, then waiting<br/>
around for the curds to form and then hanging it in cheesecloth to drip. I<br/>
love mixing Chevre with fresh herbs from my garden. I made Garlic and Chives<br/>
last week..yummy.<br/>
<br/>
Living in the country as we do..makes unschooling so easy I think..we have a<br/>
pond, fields, woods nearby, a creek too..the girls are always bringing home<br/>
frogs, tadpoles, minnows and other creepy crawlies to observe. They help me<br/>
birth baby goats.. they have the horses to ride and care for..and each<br/>
planted their own garden spot this year..we all stay very busy.<br/>
We recently built a chicken house as a family project..talk about real life<br/>
math..and fun too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping my oldest doesn&#39;t rush the Grandma thing for me.. BG... but she<br/>
and her boyfriend are in a serious relationship. I really wish she would<br/>
have chosen college/tech school or travel instead..but that&#39;s how it goes I<br/>
guess.<br/>
I think it&#39;s so cool that you plan to unschool your Grandchildren!<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to getting to know you.<br/>

&gt; Oooo cheese making. how cool I would like to learn to<br/>
&gt; make cheese so that me and my son Levi, who is 13<br/>
&gt; could do that together. I&#39;ve just started the<br/>
&gt; unschooling for Levi,but I love it! I used to just<br/>
&gt; duplicate school in my home ( I thought that was what<br/>
&gt; homeschooling was) But now we play Yahtzee and make<br/>
&gt; alot of trips to the creek to play and explore<br/>
&gt; things.I&#39;m a single mom. My other two childern are<br/>
&gt; grown and I&#39;m already a grandma. I love it though. My<br/>
&gt; grand kids are 2 & 3 I&#39;ll be homeschooling them also .<br/>
&gt; My daughter and I never want them to have to go to<br/>
&gt; public school. So nice to hear from you, Julie I hope<br/>
&gt; we can share Ideas with both of us having 13 yr.<br/>
&gt; olds;) Laurie </span></blockquote></div>

<br/>
I was reading fast (and still trying to catch up with my mail!) and what I <br/>
read was &quot;I think we have a pond, fields, woods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought, &quot;How can she not KNOW if she has a pond!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m in New Mexico where a pond isn&#39;t always a pond, and arroyos are <br/>
usually sandboxes, but occasionally raging rivers of certain death, so it did take <br/>
more parts of a second for me to look back and see what it REALLY said.  It <br/>
was a fun second-section, though, to think someone could have a pond, or THINK <br/>
she had a pond.<br/>
