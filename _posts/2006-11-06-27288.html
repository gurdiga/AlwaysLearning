just down-right hostile on a daily basis.  Sorscha is growing up in an <br/>
exactly opposite scenario.  Growing up in that environment did not <br/>
desensitize me.  In fact, because I experienced it I am able to make choices <br/>
every day based on knowledge that I have gained from that experience.<br/>
