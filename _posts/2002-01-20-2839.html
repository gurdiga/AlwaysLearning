And have you thought about this?  Who cloned sheep?  The Scots.<br/>
After centuries of having the reputation for buggering sheep and not getting <br/>
any offspring, they&#39;ve bypassed that stage and are creating their own <br/>
sheep-offspring the direct way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not that I know of but you can buy an insurance policy to compensate you if<br/>
it does happen. The  Nessie-Safe Aquatics All Risks Insurance is only £260<br/>
and insures you for £1,000,000. They will also insure against alien<br/>
abduction or impregnation with their ET Safe Alien All Risks Insurance. They<br/>
will also insure against virgins births.<br/>

<br/>
Though they are real insurance policies, they say half are bought as jokes.<br/>
(Of course that means half aren&#39;t!) It&#39;s rather significant that they<br/>
haven&#39;t paid out on any yet.<br/>

Yes, I got that. I meant it to be sarcastic, but I<br/>
always forget that sarcasm doesn&#39;t translate very well<br/>
via internet communications &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

Hey Shyrley,<br/>
Chris (my ex) drove his moped up to Scotland when he<br/>
was 16 to look for Nessie. Needless to say, he didn&#39;t<br/>
have any luck in locating the great beastie, but he<br/>
had a great time trying!<br/>

Well that was a nice thing for him to do.  Poor monster, being hunted and <br/>
spied on.  And how environmentally responsible of him to cut down on traffic <br/>
in that area.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what his next project will be?  Maybe he could magically keep anyone <br/>
in Scotland from using drugs.  That would be nice and environmentally sound <br/>
too.  Maybe he could put a spell on some roundabouts so nobody would have an <br/>
accident.<br/>
