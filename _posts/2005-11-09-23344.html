<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540179554">Hello,<br/>
We are pondering a move to Vermont but after looking at the state&#39;s <br/>
rather tough requirements for homeschoolers, we&#39;re a bit uneasy.  I <br/>
would really appreciate any advice, recommendations from people who <br/>
have unschooled their children in the state of Vermont (or another <br/>
state that is known for being a strict regulator of homeschoolers) as <br/>
to how they went about this process (without slipping bits of schooling <br/>
back in just to come into compliance...) without undermining our <br/>
committment to unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
