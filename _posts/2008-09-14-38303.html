<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072034601">I follow several unschoolers&#39; blogs, and two I read right in a row  <br/>
seemed similar enough I wanted to set them side by side:<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
It was really fun walking with them - this is the most relaxed I&#39;d  <br/>
felt taking them both on a walk like this by ourselves. In the past  <br/>
it tended to end up where one kid was way ahead of the other, and not  <br/>
usually wanting to slow down and wait. Or they&#39;d want to go in  <br/>
different directions. Or they&#39;d both want to be carried. That kind of  <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Not so last night. I think part of it is my increased ability to go  <br/>
with the flow and be more relaxed in general, and part of it is where  <br/>
the kids are right now.<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
and<br/>
---------------------<br/>
I actually did dishes and laundry and found the joy in it. I think I  <br/>
enjoyed it because it was peaceful enough for me to be in deep  <br/>
thought and I was almost done before I realized that I was almost done.<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
I really like the stories of those moments of recognition that life  <br/>
is changing for the better.<br/>
