 But ultimately I said I thought maybe what she wanted to do when she grew up <br/>
 was to watch Mr. Rogers&#39; factory tour videos! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe travel and VISIT many factories. <br/>
They had a &quot;top ten factories to visit&quot; on the travel channel last night, it <br/>
was SO cool!!<br/>
There was the Kellogs factory where you can get froot loops and such on your <br/>
icecream, the Tootsie Roll factory where they have &quot;lickometers&quot;, the Ben and <br/>
Jerry&#39;s one where you can visit the grave yard of deceased flavors.....and so <br/>
on.<br/>
I want to do a U.S. factory tour some day!!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

Made in the USA_  Full of factory tours all over the us.  We take it on<br/>
every trip we make.  You can find it on Amazon or used probably on Half.com<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve gone to a fortune cookie factory, the Stanford Linear Accelerator and<br/>
the Celestial Seasonings plant (don&#39;t miss the peppermint room), just to<br/>
name a few, as a direct result of owning this book.<br/>

kinds of factories.  One of the reasons he liked me when we first met was <br/>
that I understood when he said &quot;automation&quot; he didn&#39;t mean &quot;automobiles&quot; like <br/>
the other women he met.  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
When he travelled for a living, we would go with him, and sometimes we would <br/>
get to see his robots in action, or look at the conveyor or vision system in <br/>
the shop before it was shipped to the customer.  I still love going on field <br/>
trips to factories with the unschoolers around here.  <br/>
<br/>
My dad was always fascinated with any kind of process, too.  I&#39;ve sat in cars <br/>
with him by the side of the road while we watched stuff happen, listen to him <br/>
explain how things are made, etc.  He took my sons to the opening of a tunnel <br/>
on a new interstate that was the first tunnel through a mountain ever built <br/>
in Arkansas, and they were all on the news.  And now I find myself pulling <br/>
over to watch a crane lift a steeple to the top of a church.  Will and I are <br/>
keeping track of the progress on a new radar tower they&#39;re builidng on our <br/>
route (it looks like a giant golf ball on a tee).  We thought they&#39;d get all <br/>
four quarters of the ball up in one day, but it took them 2 weeks.  <br/>

thought it was too interesting but Jonathan does.  He and I will stop and <br/>
watch forever, even people doing remodeling work inside a building.  Lanora <br/>
has learned to wander off by herself and come back when she thinks we are <br/>
satisfied.<br/>
