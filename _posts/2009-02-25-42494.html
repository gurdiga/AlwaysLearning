<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902112069">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this group.  My name is Kate, and I&#39;m a soon-to-be-24<br/>
(next week!) mommy to one little girl, Bekah, who is 13 months.  We<br/>
have another little one on the way this summer.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was homeschooled, I was not, and we&#39;ve always known that we<br/>
wanted to homeschool.  Lately I&#39;ve been reading more and more on the<br/>
subject, including books on unschooling, to figure out what will work<br/>
best for us.  Although my DD is not yet &quot;really&quot; old enough to school,<br/>
we are thinking of beginning some activities with some other<br/>
interested moms of toddlers/preschoolers.  We live in a major city and<br/>
have a lot of great things we can do even with very young children<br/>
(hands-on science museums, tons of parks and events, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
The more I read, the more I realize I can&#39;t &quot;homeschool&quot; in a<br/>
traditional sense.  I don&#39;t want workbooks, and tests, and having to<br/>
be accountable to a curriculum or other outside source.  I want us to<br/>
choose our learning and projects as they appeal to us.<br/>
<br/>
So, I joined this group for ideas and support as we discover what<br/>
works for us.  I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know everyone!<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve been in activities groups and playgroups both, with young  <br/>
children.   Activities groups sometimes cause stress and  <br/>
disagreements.  DO the kids have to stand in line quietly, or can they  <br/>
play until they&#39;re called?  At a pizza-place kitchen tour, when they  <br/>
give the kids a free pizza, can one parent buy soda without the other  <br/>
parents glaring?  (My personal experience:  No.)<br/>
<br/>
But a playgroup is much lower-pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some recently collected ideas for things you could do at your  <br/>
house, maybe with other kids you invite over, if it seems more fun  <br/>
with groups:<br/>
