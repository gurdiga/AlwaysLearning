 What I am looking for may not be unschooling by your definition, I<br/>
want a relaxed fun atmosphere where children are treated as individuals <br/>
and have<br/>
choices in what they do and how they do it.  Has anyone ever done that <br/>
with a<br/>
large group of kids?  If not, I will just keep doing what I am doing <br/>
and trying<br/>
different suggestions that I get.<br/>
