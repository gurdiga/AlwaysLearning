WHAT A GREAT LINE!<br/>
<br/>
We have a little rubber or early-plastic Italian creche set.  At Christmas <br/>
one year I put it out.  It guys are about six inches tall.  So were Kirby&#39;s <br/>
Teenanged Mutant Ninja Turtles.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was interested in the story, and I told him everyone&#39;s names.  <br/>
<br/>
One day I came in and one of the shepherds was gone, and a Ninja Turtle was <br/>
in its place.  Other days others were in and out.  Baby Jesus checked out the <br/>
Fisher Price playhouse another time.<br/>
<br/>
Action figures. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
