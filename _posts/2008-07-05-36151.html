<div id="ygrps-yiv-762201082">Is Unschooling about activities?<br/>
I think yes, largely--life is learning and an active life is better  <br/>
than a quiet/still/dull life where nothing&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
So Amanda has put this on her blog:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/2008/07/45-year-old-">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/2008/07/45-year-old-</a> <br/>
activities.html<br/>
It&#39;s the 4/5 year old activities thread--she&#39;s put the ideas and  <br/>
suggestions in there in one long list.<br/>
<br/>
At first I was excited and went to find a place to put it on my page.<br/>
As I looked here and there for where to put it, I realized it didn&#39;t  <br/>
fit.  If I added &quot;activities&quot; to the top of my list of topics, it  <br/>
would mar the whole operation.<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t &quot;unschooling activities.&quot;  There are real-world  <br/>
activities.  Unschooling is a different way of seeing those  <br/>
activities, a different way of engaging in them, and of valuing them  <br/>
in retrospect.<br/>
<br/>
Brainstorming on this list is one thing and it&#39;s not a bad thing!   <br/>
Having those ideas where people will come across them isn&#39;t a bad  <br/>
thing at all.  But if I start collecting activities for 4 and 5 year  <br/>
olds, will people want a new and different set of activities for 6  <br/>
year olds?  Or if there&#39;s a list of things to do, will people come  <br/>
back and say &quot;We did all that.  Now what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still thinking, but it seems it&#39;s more important to discuss why  <br/>
and how than what.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 17 yo has been coloring for the past few days. I bought really good  <br/>
quality colored pencils (Prismacolor) and coloring books for our cross- <br/>
country train trip and all the girls on the trip really enjoyed them.  <br/>
I got Dover coloring books - one is costumes, another is cats, another  <br/>
is fashion, one is butterflies, and there was also an art masterpieces  <br/>
one. And I got some of those beautiful geometric shapes coloring books  <br/>
by - Ruth Heller? (I think)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - they were enjoyed on the long train trip, but also since we  <br/>
got home, Rosie has been spending a lot of time coloring.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting this to reinforce what Sandra is concerned about regarding  <br/>
these activities being listed as for specific ages. What makes sense  <br/>
to me is to say that 4 to 5 year olds might like these activities, but  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t make sense to think of the activities as being &quot;for&quot; four  <br/>
to five year olds. It was fun to think back about what my girls loved  <br/>
doing at that age - but, really, what I had was either a 4 yo and 1 yo  <br/>
or a 7 yo, 4 yo, and 1 yo, or an 11 yo, 7, and 4 yo. And they all  <br/>
enjoyed the activities I mentioned, it wasn&#39;t specifically or only the  <br/>
four year old.<br/>
<br/>
For several years I ran a girl scout troop that had girls from 4 to 16  <br/>
years old. What we noticed, in a big way, was that the activities we  <br/>
thought were aimed at the younger girls were very very often taken up  <br/>
with great gusto by the older girls - they were visibly thrilled to  <br/>
have the chance to engage in a lot of the activities that most people  <br/>
would have judged were &quot;too young&quot; for them. And, sometimes, the  <br/>
younger girls would work with the materials intended for the older  <br/>
girls and have a great time - sometimes surprising us with their  <br/>
competencies, sometimes using the same materials to do simpler things.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re better off to think in terms of what a particular child  <br/>
might enjoy, rather than generalizing about certain ages of kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-257367112"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There aren&#39;t &quot;unschooling activities.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  I looked on the blog you referenced and couldn&#39;t find the <br/>
entry you mentioned.  I remember having a list of things for my kids <br/>
to do when they were younger, but it wasn&#39;t categorized into age <br/>
levels.  That sounds like schoolish thought.  My list was more of <br/>
a &#39;I&#39;m bored, what can I do next&#39; type list where I used pictures to <br/>
remind the kids of all the things we had around the house.  I think <br/>
you&#39;re right that if there is a list for 4 & 5 year olds, someone else <br/>
will ask for something more than that.  They might think one list is <br/>
for before school age, and another during school age.  But school age <br/>
is not an unschooling idea.<br/>

I forgot the trick to get a URL to stay whole.<br/>
I&#39;ll try a few things.  But for the reader who couldn&#39;t find the thing, it&#39;s a worthwhile thing to <br/>
learn to restore broken URLs.  If only the first part &quot;lights up,&quot; cut and paste the whole thing, <br/>
and put it in the URL box.  You might need to take out a space.<br/>

If neither of those works straight out, go to the first part of it (delete everything past the <br/>
.com part) and then look for a post that looks like 4/4 year old activities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323114494">The title&#39;s honest, though--that was the topic, and that was the  <br/>
question.<br/>
If you wanted to change it maybe add<br/>
(or any age)<br/>
but you don&#39;t need to change it.  I just need to not link it.  And  <br/>
that felt odd.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there&#39;s a part of the explaining of unschooling that needs  <br/>
more sanding, because it&#39;s kind of rough or people rarely go there or  <br/>
something (vague thoughts here, too).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy AND simple to tell people what unschooling isn&#39;t.  Don&#39;t do  <br/>
school, don&#39;t do lessons, don&#39;t use a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
Then comes the next step:  What TO do.  But a list of things to do  <br/>
doesn&#39;t help much, or it doesn&#39;t in itself become unschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
The parents have to change, for unschooling to really take root.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can go to the store and buy a bulb in a pot and watch it bloom  <br/>
and own a plant.  But to have bulbs living in your yard, dividing  <br/>
themselves, coming up every year without any further work from you  <br/>
other than watering them (where applicable--I live  in the high  <br/>
desert, where yards get watered or they turn back to dusty dirt),  <br/>
then you&#39;re going to have to have a good place for them to live, and  <br/>
loosen up the dirt, and put them in there and keep them from dying  <br/>
until they get established.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling becomes like an established bulb garden (way better and  <br/>
bigger and broader, but for purposes of this analogy, stay with me a  <br/>
bit).  Bulbs will arise that you didn&#39;t plant.   And maybe you  <br/>
originally bought some bulbs, or someone gave them to you, or you  <br/>
bought a house where some were already in the ground.  But there were  <br/>
original bulbs.<br/>
<br/>
This list and the sites and blogs you can get to so easily from it  <br/>
are like a big bulb exchange.  You can gather up TONS of ideas and  <br/>
inspirations and warnings and reminders, but nobody can put those  <br/>
bulbs in the ground at your house but you.  Carrying a bulb around in  <br/>
your pocket, or having one in a pot in the kitchen isn&#39;t going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a page that should help the parents of anyone, any age.  It  <br/>
will help childless young adults.  It will help empty-nest older folk:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wonder">http://sandradodd.com/wonder</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what unschooling needs.  Not lists of activities (those are  <br/>
available all over the place) but new ways to see the same old things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515591561">Maybe wording it something like:<br/>
&quot;A few ideas for playing and having fun&quot;<br/>
will be better then anything that says:<br/>
&quot;Activities&quot; or &quot;things to do&quot;<br/>
List like that give me ideas of fun usually for me to do with my kids.<br/>
Sometimes I am too busy cleaning ( trying to ) or other projects and I read ideas like those <br/>
in this list and I drop those things to go play with my kids and be a kid with them.<br/>
New ideas are fun for me. I am not that creative. My mom is like that she is super full of ideas that just pop<br/>
on her head of fun things to do. Like painting my garden rocks and creating animals with them. <br/>
Making bird houses of oranje juice and milk jugs and decorating with old bark , pine cones,pine needles, and many other materials found in the ground.<br/>
Just going out for a walk and picking up flowers, rocks, leaves and creating things with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918942674">And I am adding, even if someone else has already, the pseudo<br/>
gender-orientation of activities is also easy to do and not particularly<br/>
happy for kids.  Dress up being a great example.  5 year old ds has loved it<br/>
since he was about 2 1/2.  He wants capes and drapy headpieces along with<br/>
the ninja faceplate and the monster masks.  He enjoys polly pockets every<br/>
bit as much as his action figure toys.  He adores dollhouses as much as<br/>
those racing tracks for hotwheels.<br/>
<br/>
The fruit of that is a wild confident imagination about what beings there<br/>
are and how they interact.  Yesterday his dad began a story for ds to<br/>
complete.  &quot;A little boy and his lion were walking in the forest one day.<br/>
They came upon a spider and the spider said....&quot;  then without missing a<br/>
beat ds added &quot;Don&#39;t step on me.  I&#39;m a electric spider and I&#39;ll electrocute<br/>
you.&quot;<br/>

I was putting some of Kirby&#39;s toys away just the other day.  The  <br/>
Ninja Turtle Sewer is a dollhouse for ninja turtles.  That&#39;s not the  <br/>
preferred terminology for boys.  It&#39;s a stage for action tableaux, at  <br/>
least.<br/>
<br/>
And there were miniature Turtle like-dollhouses, too, like Mighty Max  <br/>
(like Polly Pocket, kinda) but all Ninja Turtles from the early 90s.<br/>
