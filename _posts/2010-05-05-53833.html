<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007145296">With all the talk of dirt and mud, I just had to share my sons latest fascination: dorodangos.  Balls of mud that are molded by hand and polished.  He spent spent 3 hours working on one yesterday, and got his siblings totally into it as well.<br/>

It ties in with the digging, but also with things you can learn from tv.  He saw a Mythbusters about these shiny mud balls (the guys on Mythbusters try to mimic the Dung Beetle, thus use poo), then looked up information online (there are dozens of websites about these), and then went out in the yard and worked for hours to make one.<br/>
<br/>
In the gallery on the linked website are several dorodangos of different colors, all made from mud and dirt found in different locations in NM.  Fascinating how much color variation there is in dirt!<br/>

In New Mexico there is.  That&#39;s why there are so many different stucco  <br/>
colors here, because people got attached to the color where they grew  <br/>
up, or their grandmother&#39;s house, and so when commercial stucco came  <br/>
along they gathered up every possible color from localities around the  <br/>
state.<br/>
