<div id="ygrps-yiv-23817656"><div dir="ltr">Hi all,<div><br></div><div>We started radically unschooling mid-February of this year, so about 2 1/2 months ago. Very recent! Most everything has been going very well as the kids (and parents) deschool.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m having a problem with how late my oldest son (nearly 10) is going to bed.  The past few nights, he&#39;s been downstairs watching TV and playing video games until 3am.  He is a growing boy, so he has been waking up daily between about 1pm and 3pm. </div>
<div><br></div><div>This going to bed so late makes me uncomfortable and I&#39;m not sure why.  I think it&#39;s because I worry about his health.  He woke me up with the TV last night around 2:50am and I had a mini-freak out, telling him (not so sweetly) to get upstairs and go to bed and that he was going to start a midnight curfew on the TV use.  He didn&#39;t argue with me at all and jumped up, turned off the TV and lights, and came upstairs.  When I woke up this morning, I knew setting an arbitrary curfew was not the answer.</div>
<div><br></div><div>My feeling is that he is binging out and even though he wants to go to bed, he just isn&#39;t ready to shut down the TV/games.  I think that&#39;s why whenever it ends up being me to tell him to get in bed, he does it so obligingly.  My son is not the type to do what he is told if he doesn&#39;t want to do it.  </div>

<div><font size="4">Hi Megan, we are very new to unschooling too. Our eldest 
daughter did that a couple of times on her ipod. I woke up at 1 am to find her 
still on the couch researching on her ipod. We have never adhered to a strict 
bedtime as such but we have faciliated bedtimes when it became apparent they 
have needed to go to sleep. This is just an extension of attachment parenting. 
For us that meant reading the tired signs in our babies and either babywearing 
or breastfeeding (or driving about in a car!) to help sleep happen. I feel the 
ipod or computer or television continues to stimulate and enable our daughter to 
ignore her tired signals and stay awake much longer than she would if she wasn’t 
watching something. She’s ok to have us help her to just turn the tv or the 
computer or the ipod off and go to bed. It’s a process of facilitation, is the 
best word I can think of to describe it. Sometimes its 9 or 9 :30, sometimes its 
10:30. She’s much happier that we are with her in this bedtime process than for 
her to be left alone to figure it out by herself.</font></div>
