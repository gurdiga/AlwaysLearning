<div id="ygrps-yiv-85893551">Holly and I were just talking about a depressing/depressive family we  <br/>
know and in summary I said<br/>
&quot;The cup is half empty, and it&#39;s a stupid cup, and what&#39;s in it sucks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If that sounds like anything at anyone&#39;s house here, the antidote is  <br/>
to look for beauty and then feel it, see it, smell it, touch it,  <br/>
taste it, and acknowledge it.<br/>
