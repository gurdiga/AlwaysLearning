Sorry for any confusion.<br/>

That&#39;s not the same group.  That&#39;s a wishful thinking and channelling  <br/>
group (my paraphrase, not their description).<br/>
<br/>
This was on the UnschoolingDiscussion list last month, from Schuyler:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
Peaceful Partnerships (not trademarked) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/</a> <br/>
Peacefulpartnerships/. I&#39;ll send you an invite, if you want or just  <br/>
come over and join and I&#39;ll approve you.<br/>
<br/>
The list description is:<br/>
This &quot;Peaceful Partnership&quot; list is for adults who live the radical  <br/>
unschooling and peaceful/respectful parenting lifestyle with their  <br/>
children and who wish to bring a similarly-peaceful and -respectful  <br/>
feeling to their relationship with their partner.<br/>
<br/>
Our focus is on how the actions and shifting of perspective of just  <br/>
one of the adults in the partnership may bring more joy to their own  <br/>
lives and, hopefully, bring more joy into the relationship with their  <br/>
partner.<br/>
<br/>
We have seen that living an unschooling life brings an amazing amount  <br/>
of harmony to our relationships with our children and, to a certain  <br/>
extent, that carries over into the whole familial relationship. But  <br/>
we want to take that a step further and do for our partnerships what  <br/>
we&#39;ve done for our relationships with our children.&lt;/&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This list is for people who already practice radical unschooling and  <br/>
peaceful/respectful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
If you are new to the idea of radical unschooling and peaceful/ <br/>
respectful parenting, please visit Sandra Dodd&#39;s and Joyce  <br/>
Fetteroll&#39;s websites to obtain more information about those concepts.<br/>
<br/>
This list&#39;s discussion will center on the partnership relationship.  <br/>
There are more appropriate lists on which to discuss the parent-child  <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: The list owner is not relationship experts. This is  <br/>
simply a forum for discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064274518">When you create a yahoo group, one of the options is to not have the<br/>
group show up in the search results to keep it more private.  When you<br/>
do that, anyone who knows the exact name of the group can find it by<br/>
using a url like this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExactNameOfThePrivateGroup">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExactNameOfThePrivateGroup</a><br/>
<br/>
A few of the local homeschooling groups around here do that.   It<br/>
really confused me when I first ran across it and, remembering my<br/>
confusion, I thought an explanation of why you couldn&#39;t find the group<br/>
might be of interest.<br/>
