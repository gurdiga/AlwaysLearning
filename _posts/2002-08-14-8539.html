&gt;&gt;Subject: JAY GORDON&#39;S MOST IMPORTANT POST EVER--NO HUMOR<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Please pardon the pretentious title to this post but there is a very large<br/>
&gt;&gt;problem brewing.  (Also pardon the caps.  I wanted to emphasize a few<br/>
 </span></blockquote>points.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This is NOT a rumor.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics &quot;New Mother&#39;s Guide to<br/>
&gt;&gt;Breast-Feeding&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;(sic on the hyphenation) has been purchased by ROSS LABORATORIES in large<br/>
&gt;&gt;quantities to be distributed WITH THEIR NAME AND LOGO to &quot;give&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;to hospitals<br/>
&gt;&gt;so that they may be given to new mothers with their discharge pack.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I repeat, this is NOT a rumor and may be confirmed by writing to either<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Betty<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Crase (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:BCrase@...">BCrase@...</a>) or to Maureen DeRosa, Director, Department of<br/>
&gt;&gt;Marketing and  Publications at American Academy of Pediatrics<br/>
&gt;&gt;(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:MDeRosa@...">MDeRosa@...</a>)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I do not know Ms. DeRosa, but I have certainly known and loved Betty for<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;years.  She is one of the finest LLLI people I have ever met and has been<br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;inside&quot; the AAP for some time now.  Her job is important to us<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I would assume that La Leche&#39;s plan to also put this book into their<br/>
&gt;&gt;catalogue will be canceled.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Not only will LLL not be &quot;two clicks away&quot; from formula<br/>
&gt;&gt;marketing, LLL will<br/>
&gt;&gt;be selling a book, favorably reviewing a book and supporting a book which<br/>
&gt;&gt;will be in the hands of tens of thousands of new mothers looking at<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I appreciate the response I get from many of you when I write tongue in<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;of a parody than anything I could ever have imagined or written, I have<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;been more serious.  I would like to repeat, this is not a rumor and I have<br/>
&gt;&gt;confirmed all the facts in this post.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I would ask that you all urgently email the AAP and Betty to stop this<br/>
&gt;&gt;stunningly deceptive plan.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am disgusted that the AAP would allow this.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;This bizarre between breastfeeding&#39;s biggest enemies and the AAP and La<br/>
