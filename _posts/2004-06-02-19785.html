<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370846221">My 6 yo son has started playing soccer this year, and enjoys it very <br/>
much. At the end of the game, 2 certificates are awarded - player of <br/>
the day, and the magic moment. (I had to explain the significance of <br/>
certificates to my son - he had never come across the concept!)<br/>
Anyway, each week a different parent gets to decide who gets the <br/>
awards, and this week, it was my turn. It was explained to me that <br/>
each child would be awarded the certificates, until everyone had <br/>
one, and after that it would be awarded on true merit. This was so <br/>
everyone had a turn, and no-one felt bad.<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t really agree with the whole certificate thing, but this <br/>
just makes it even worse to me - the only goal scored by our team <br/>
had to go un-acknowleged, because it was scored by the most <br/>
competant player, who has already had both awards. I was really <br/>
scratching for reasons to give the awards to the players I did, as <br/>
they truely weren&#39;t outstanding.<br/>
How can I raise this issue with people who don&#39;t even home-school, <br/>
let alone unschool? Or do some people think this is a fair way of <br/>
doing it? I just think the kids know the best players got the awards <br/>
first, and that it is a bit meaningless. Am I missing something?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340935175">I&#39;m not sure I agree with the certificate thing, but I do think that <br/>
it&#39;s really easy to find player of the day and magic moment award winners. <br/>
<br/>
The kid who just doesn&#39;t have the same skill level as everyone else, but <br/>
works his butt off for the team.   The kid who sits out one quarter each <br/>
game because for him, he likes to just play and watch, he doesnt&#39; have <br/>
to play all the time--while other kids want to play all the time.  The <br/>
kid who usually just is in the fray but today got a bit of that ball, <br/>
kicked it, was not just running and in the group.  The kid who stopped <br/>
for a minute to check if his opponent was OK after being hit by the <br/>
ball.  The kid who helped his opponent to his feet, or tied his shoe for <br/>
him.  Lexie a few times went in for the other team, just so teams would <br/>
be even and fair!  The kid who usually picks daisies, but today actually <br/>
spent a few minutes following the play and trying to be involved! <br/>

knowing the people, how entrenched the practice is, etc., but I think<br/>
I might try to talk about it with the other parents. You might not be<br/>

~~~<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to blend my unschooling life into where it intersects with <br/>
school-minded people.  We have the same kind of thing going on with the 9-10 yo <br/>
baseball team my husband coaches.  We give out the &quot;game ball&quot; after most <br/>
games.  <br/>
<br/>
After reading what you wrote, I think the point that is being missed by the <br/>
coach is that recognition of extra effort is what counts, not the game-winning <br/>
point.  I don&#39;t know soccer, so let&#39;s give examples from baseball.  The kid <br/>
who very nearly strikes out every time at bat was awarded the game ball for <br/>
finally swinging the bat, making contact with the ball (foul), turning his likely <br/>
strike-out into a walk, AND getting his glove on the ball when it was hit to <br/>
him, and throwing it into second just as he had been taught to do.  Did he win <br/>
the game?  No, but he performed beyond his own ability so far, he showed <br/>
improvement and had a good attitude.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t pointed out to him that he always strikes out.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>
patronized.  The kid KNOWS he strikes out almost every time.  Our team operates on the <br/>
principles of &quot;Fun, Fundamentals, Teamwork, and Winning without violating the <br/>
first three.&quot;  Within that framework, Daniel was an excellent example of the <br/>
principles we try to foster.  He has a great attitude, which means he&#39;s still <br/>
having fun; he&#39;s getting better at hitting, which means he&#39;s working on his <br/>
fundamentals; and he threw the ball to second because he knew his teammate would <br/>
be expecting it there.  <br/>
<br/>
In most of the games we&#39;ve played, the kid who got the game ball was clearly <br/>
outshone in a particular play or at bat by another kid.  Those are usually the <br/>
kids who will perform well game after game, i.e., rarely make errors and <br/>
usually get on base.  We don&#39;t give game balls to those kids unless their effort <br/>
was indeed beyond their usual effort, or indeed win the game for us.  Yes, the <br/>
standards are different for each kid, because each kid&#39;s ability is different. <br/>
 The game ball is for individual effort, which also sometimes advances the <br/>
team&#39;s goals, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Our last two kids who haven&#39;t received a game ball are the two best players.  <br/>
One is our son Will.  He&#39;s an unschooled kid.  He knows when he plays well <br/>
and does better, and he understands why we give game balls the way we do and he <br/>
understands the issue of favoritism of the coach&#39;s son, etc.  More <br/>
importantly, since he&#39;s never gone to school and earned gold stars, the outside <br/>
reinforcement of the game ball is not as important to him as his own performance.  <br/>
Playing the game and making good plays and winning *is* the reward for him in <br/>
baseball.  So, he&#39;s willing to wait for everyone else to go first, and he&#39;d be <br/>
okay if we left him out entirely.   <br/>
<br/>
The other kid is who we call our Ironman.  His statistics are way beyond <br/>
everyone else&#39;s.  He makes clutch plays almost every game and hits the ball in the <br/>
outfield and scores runs.  He has a great attitude, too.  We knew going in <br/>
that he would be performing above and beyond and there would be plenty of <br/>
chances for recognizing his sheer talent.  So we decided to wait until the end and <br/>
give him the last game ball to recognize his solid, steady performance through <br/>
all 20 games.  We&#39;ve told him in subtle ways that he has not been forgotten.  <br/>
<br/>
The recognition received through the game ball is important to the kids.  We <br/>
recognize all the kids after each game, give them a chance to talk about what <br/>
they did right.  We emphasize the positive and ignore the negative.  But the <br/>
game ball is just a little extra recognition of a &quot;personal best&quot;.  This is <br/>
where the schooled mind bumps up against the unschooled one.  We make it as less <br/>
school-like as we possibly can.  <br/>
<br/>
I think if done well, recognition like awarding the game ball can be a <br/>
positive thing.  Passing it around just to take turns isn&#39;t positive, IMO.  We have <br/>
to do a bit of turn-taking on our team, but it&#39;s very easy to recognize extra <br/>
individual effort if you know what to look for, AND it&#39;s not in the context of <br/>
winning first.<br/>
