<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015310371">We can choose to be happy with the choice or choose to believe we had <br/>
no choice. But we always have a choice. Only force or coercion <br/>
between people eliminates choice. Even life is a choice. I choose to <br/>
be happy with life because experiencing life is my main priority, <br/>
sometimes even over doing things that I don&#39;t like to do.<br/>
