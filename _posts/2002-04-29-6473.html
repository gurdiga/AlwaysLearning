<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580539914">I thought I&#39;d take a minute and introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I have been homeschooling my kids for 7 years now. I have 2 <br/>
daughters, 12 and 10, and 2 sons, 4 and 2 (in June). Until this year <br/>
I always used text books... YUK ! We all hated it, but I didn&#39;t know <br/>
what else to do. This year I started out like all other... bought the <br/>
books, cried the tears, constantly heard... &quot;I hate school&quot; &quot;Why do I <br/>
have to do this again?&quot; and so on. It was when I found the <br/>
words, &quot;Why don&#39;t we just enroll them in real school&quot; that I realized <br/>
this is a bad thing we are doing. So, I went on ebay.. sold all the <br/>
school text books (except math... please don&#39;t hate me). I don&#39;t know <br/>
if I have officially become an unschooler. We have done more unit <br/>
type things, (I think). Basically I let my girls choose a topic, at <br/>
first I had to come up with an idea... after all I have stunted there <br/>
own desire to learn. And we went out and found information. We used <br/>
the internet a lot... the book stores were fun, and the library. <br/>
Whenever I could we would go to a place, field trip. For instance we <br/>
studied Florida and since we live near St Augustine, we went there. <br/>
<br/>
This year we did so much more than we have ever done any other year. <br/>
Now, near the end of the year, my girls are choosing the topics on <br/>
their own. I find them on the computer all the time, looking up <br/>
something that they saw. We got a Beta fish and my oldest daughter <br/>
can&#39;t seem to find enough information about it. This has been such a <br/>
wonderful year. <br/>
<br/>
Now, my questions are... is this the way other Unschoolers approach <br/>
learning? Or can someone give me pointers. And... I know the math <br/>
issue is going to hit a nerve with many of you. I am very open and <br/>
would love to through away that book as well. Can you tell me how to <br/>
teach math without a book? I know that math is in everything we do... <br/>
cooking, sewing, and more. But I do have to have an evaluation or <br/>
testing done at the end of every year here in FL. So how would <br/>
I &quot;prove math&quot; in an evaluation, if we have no book? Gosh, I hope I <br/>
don&#39;t get a bunch of hate mail over this.... :)<br/>
<br/>
I really want to learn and grow. So, please feel free to give advice.<br/>

<br/>
We can help you learn how to see math being learned where it&#39;s not &quot;being <br/>
taught,&quot; but my best advice is to go to www.unschooling.com and read as much <br/>
as you can stand to--library (essays), and whatever topics on the forum <br/>
strike you as interesting.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now, my questions are... is this the way other Unschoolers approach<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and no. Sometimes it might look like that. But by seeing the learning in<br/>
a topic they&#39;re researching you&#39;ll only see a small portion of their<br/>
learning. Learning is in whatever interests them, regardless of how closely<br/>
it resembles something they&#39;d do in school. It&#39;s in their favorite TV<br/>
programs, video games, pretending to be Pokemon, playing with Barbies,<br/>
discussions with you and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or can someone give me pointers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Sandra suggested <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.Unschooling.com">http://www.Unschooling.com</a>  The getting started thing<br/>
has been asked there loads of times :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you tell me how to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well you can&#39;t expect to get the math on tests from living life. At least<br/>
not in the style and order that&#39;s done in school.<br/>
<br/>
To unschool math you&#39;ll need to see math in a totally different way.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t we just have a math discussion on the Unschooling-dotcom list? Try<br/>
subscribing by sending a blank email to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">unschooling-dotcom-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> and go to the webpage for the<br/>
archives. Type in math and some recent posts should show up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try the Across the Continent folder at the Unschooling.com message boards.<br/>
They have a Florida folder. And I know there are a number of Florida people<br/>
there.<br/>
