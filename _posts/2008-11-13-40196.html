&lt;&lt;&lt;The fact remains <br/>
that needs and wants are  different...that needs and wants are  diff<br/>
want what&#39;s available.  Our life has limitations on not only material <br/>
things but emotional things  as well. For example, &quot;Why does <br/>
Christmas come sooner?&quot; or &quot; Why can&#39;t  Grandma and Granpda live with <br/>
us?&quot; are things I cannot change no matter  how much I may want to.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The willingness to do what one can to get a kid as close as  possible to that <br/>
goal (&quot;need&quot; or &quot;want&quot; becoming fairly irrelevant in the  process) goes a <br/>
long, long way to being able to cope with things that just can&#39;t  be when they do <br/>
come up. These things sound like &quot;in the box&quot; thinking-why can&#39;t  Christmas <br/>
come sooner? It is easy to conjure up the attitude of giving and love  that is <br/>
Christmas, easy to set up an artificial tree or decorate a big  houseplant or <br/>
even cut out a tree from cardboard. It is fairly simple to box up  and wrap <br/>
homemade things or something that&#39;s been put away for a while, or even  &quot;gift <br/>
certificates&quot; for things like hugs, help with dishes, an hour or two of  game <br/>
play together, etc. (granted, most of these are things unschoolers do, but  this <br/>
is a mainstream person-plus, I&#39;ve always found it fun just to have those  <br/>
little certificates or coupons to &quot;spend&quot;.)<br/>
 <br/>
What about Grandma and Grandpa&#39;s? Maybe visits could be more  frequent or <br/>
longer. Maybe &quot;sleepover&quot; time would do the trick. Maybe meeting  half way in <br/>
between would make the visits more do-able. Maybe a video camera  would help <br/>
phone calls or e-mailing seem more &quot;in person&quot;. Maybe the kids and  the Grands <br/>
could play online games in real time together like World of Warcraft  or Wii <br/>
games wi-fi or something in that realm.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems from my point of view that the original statements  are something <br/>
easily grabbed at that mainstream parents would toss aside as  &quot;impossible to <br/>
change&quot;, where unschoolers see it as an open opportunity, a way  to get those <br/>
creative juices flowing and find as many solutions as possible. It  hasn&#39;t been <br/>
that long since I was in that mainstream way of thinking, but it  seems so <br/>
distant and I&#39;ve forgotten a lot. It *seems* mainstream folks grab at  &quot;certain&quot; <br/>
&quot;impossibles&quot; just to shore up their need to say no, &quot;... because I&#39;m  the <br/>
parent.&quot; If it really is that way, that&#39;s a pretty sad way to go about  having a <br/>
relationship with your child-and if so, I&#39;m SO glad we&#39;re not there any  more.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is also a big difference in attitude of saying something is  <br/>
impossible, &quot;Nothing you can do to make Christmas come any sooner.  <br/>
Sorry about that.&quot; versus saying, &quot;Don&#39;t you think it would be cool if  <br/>
we could have Christmas once a week instead of once a year?&quot; Very  <br/>
often, just going with the idea of something is fun and satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
My family played a sort of game, in the car, on long road trips. We&#39;d  <br/>
imagine what fun it would be to have different things IN the car with  <br/>
us. It might start with someone wanting a drink of water and I&#39;d say,  <br/>
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be cool to have a drinking fountain in the car?&quot; &quot;What  <br/>
about a soda fountain?&quot; But we&#39;d move on to, &quot;What about a REAL  <br/>
fountain that we could play in?&quot; I&#39;d say I&#39;d want a hot tub! And so on  <br/>
- it would get silly and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Economists do not distinguish between needs and wants - we call them  <br/>
all wants. What other people call needs, we consider to be more  <br/>
intense wants.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We would see those yearnings of the kids as information about what  <br/>
they are interested in and we&#39;d find ways to support their interests.  <br/>
If they are wishing Christmas would come sooner, most parents would  <br/>
probably assume it was because they want to get their presents sooner  <br/>
- greedy impatient kids!<br/>
<br/>
But really, why are the presents they get at Christmas so special? It  <br/>
probably has a lot to do with all the excitement and joy and spirit of  <br/>
giving and celebration - it wouldn&#39;t be the same if you just handed  <br/>
them the new toy without all the rest of what makes up Christmas for  <br/>
them. So, really, it is not materialistic greed for new toys, it is  <br/>
wanting to experience the joy and excitement. When we know what  <br/>
they&#39;re really interested in, we can find ways to support that  <br/>
interest. Get into the joy and excitement and spirit of Christmas in  <br/>
all kinds of ways - baking Christmas cookies, making special gifts for  <br/>
friends and relatives, make your own holiday cards or wrapping paper,  <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
If our attitude is that something our kids express desire for is JUST  <br/>
a &quot;want,&quot; not a real &quot;need,&quot; then it is easy to discount or ignore it.  <br/>
The big difference between being good unschooling parents versus being  <br/>
good, but conventional, parents, is that we are committed to putting a  <br/>
very large effort into paying attention to our child&#39;s interests and  <br/>
finding ways to support them. We don&#39;t get to disregard them -  <br/>
supporting our kids&#39; interests is not &quot;extracurricular&quot; or just  <br/>
something to be done to occupy their spare time, it IS our chosen job/ <br/>
role/lifestyle; it is what we&#39;re doing instead of schooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667445027">When my girls were littler, as each holiday approached, they would get into<br/>
the spirit by playing that it was that holiday over and over.  Around Easter<br/>
time they would hide eggs for each other or for their stuffed animals. (or I<br/>
would hide them for them) Around Christmas they would wrap gifts for their<br/>
stuffed animals.  They would use scotch tape and dish towels or face clothes<br/>
or sometimes even toilet paper.  My kids&#39; play has always seemed to emulate<br/>
what has been going on in our lives.  When it was something stressful their<br/>
play would seem to be the way they worked through it emotionally.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; come sooner? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Living on priciples has meant that Christmas does come sooner within <br/>
our household. The principle was that this time of year was for <br/>
sharing with family. The reality was that I am a shift worker (away <br/>
for up to two weeks at a time), and therefore sitting down at midday <br/>
for a christmas lunch was often something outside of my control. <br/>
Living by the principle, meant that we could share time together <br/>
(often from the first day of December - more time to fit in cookies!) <br/>
and Christmas came on the 14th or the 18th or whenever. <br/>
Aswell as children and relatives being looked after with this, I was <br/>
also able to enjoy my Christmas day (whether I was working or not) <br/>
knowing that I was not missing any one BIG day, and that we were all <br/>
truly sated on love and companionship and caring for each other. <br/>
Pressies could be opened with me before I went on a trip, on <br/>
Christmas morning, or when I got home. It was the children&#39;s and our <br/>
choice and we weren&#39;t bound to stay with any choice from one year to <br/>
the next. I am also not bound to stay a shift worker from any one <br/>
year to the next - I enjoy what I do, I enjoy the time that it allows <br/>
me to spend at home and I choose to fit it into my own familylife, I <br/>
then need to pass exams to be qualified to continue working and I <br/>
need to turn up to work even on a public holiday. The needs and wants <br/>
become intertwined in this way. <br/>

ones! My then-three-year-old began getting interested in what holidays<br/>
were coming up &quot;next.&quot; She&#39;s still very much this way and loves<br/>
counting down to birthdays, visits from friends, etc. That March she<br/>
decided to follow St. Patrick&#39;s Day with &quot;Mushroom Day.&quot; It didn&#39;t<br/>
entail a whole lot as we didn&#39;t know how to celebrate it, yet, but all<br/>
day she kept mentioning the new holiday and would draw mushrooms and<br/>
ask me to tell her all about mushrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Just think - you can come up with as many holidays as you want and<br/>
just as many ways to celebrate! Almost any age child could enjoy their<br/>
own made-up holiday :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A couple of years ago, after we celebrated Mother&#39;s Day and Father,s <br/>
Day, my boys asked, &quot;When is Brothers&#39; Day?&quot;  So, we decided to create <br/>
it.  My older son, then 4, decided that it should be on 4th of July, <br/>
because there would be fireworks.  I loved his line of thinking about <br/>
what makes a celebration!  This year, we celebrated our 3th annual <br/>
Brothers&#39; Day.  They get small gifts (usually something they can play <br/>
with outside).  We make a special breakfast, and then head outside to <br/>
play games together.  Of course, the day is topped off with <br/>
fireworks ... which my boys still insist are for them!<br/>
