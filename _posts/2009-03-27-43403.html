<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565197920">Thanks for your post Kelly, I am in the same situation so I&#39;d also like advice on this.  I am going to unschool my 6 year old in September and was going to use some structure and have been looking for the curriculum materials they use at her school.  I have been learning from this list that even though I feel my approach is better than formal school it is still very controlled and will most likely not work.  I am working on letting go and working with my child, not directing her or making her conform to my needs.  It&#39;s a hard process, but I think the rewards are going to be great.  I have already seen a difference in her using an unschooling approach..  <br/>

<br/>
  i feel funny giving advice, because we are relatively new to unschooling in our family, although not to the ideas, and we are still &quot;in process&quot; but then again i think everyone is!  i have a 10 year old DS and we&#39;ve been through many phases in the last 14 months of &quot;deschooling&quot; - he&#39;s not so social, so the waiting for friends hasn&#39;t been an issue, but he definitely went through a loooong period of just watching tv and playing video games and not being interested in much else, even if i WAS being interesting, interested, inviting, and engaging.  in fact my invitations and engagement were experienced as pressure by him - pressure to be doing something different than what he was doing - yet another way in which he was &quot;wrong&quot; or needed fixing- even though i *tried* to be concious of not sending that message.  <br/>
<br/>
  but eventually, he moved on from that and started taking an interest in things and expressing that he was bored and needed more activities, interests, passions.  in  my experience, the two things you mentioned are important - being interesting and also offering and engaging him in things (if he&#39;s receptive), but a third thing was even more important in our case - *following* my son.  there were little, almost imperceptible ways in which i could choose to follow his interest and expand on it, and support it, or in which i could tamp down the interest and make it less likely to grow.  for my son, *too* much excitement or overt expansion on an interest actually backfired into him losing interest.  it was / is a delicate balance. <br/>
<br/>
   but key to it has been *my* willingness to be completely available, primarily on his timing, to follow his lead, in his way, with whatever takes his fancy.  so - he has since gone through phases of interest in baking, and jewelry making (which he still does, and i&#39;ve, over time, created avenues for him to expand this into a business - helped him make a web site, created a market for him to sell at, etc. - but first it was JUST a creative outlet and he had no interest in  selling, growing it.)    he also seems to be an &quot;interest jag&quot; type person - so he does one thing intensively for a while.  we rode bikes every day for a few weeks last summer, for instance.  <br/>
<br/>
  yesterday, my son, out of the blue, expressed a desire for more &quot;routine&quot; in his life.  for him, this doesn&#39;t mean a schedule, and it certainly doesn&#39;t mean &quot;having&quot; to go somewhere he doesn&#39;t want to go, or an irreversable commitment, but what it means, he explained - is something to look forward to.  so we pulled out our dry erase calendar board and together we decided on a few general things that would repeat every week in some form.  thursdays would be &quot;day trip day&quot; - could mean just to our local amusement park for a couple hours - could mean to the coast or somewhere bigger/further.  sunday would be &quot;project&quot; - he apparently wants to create a project to work on  (with his dad available) that spreads out over weeks or longer - his current vision is a marble run/domino effect thing made of wood or metal piping.  <br/>
<br/>
  i also put on there the two regularly occuring things every week that do not involve him but take me out of the house - so he can anticipate and not feel blindsided or out of the loop.  and we put a few tv shows on too - when they air.  that&#39;s ALL that&#39;s on there reoccuring.  and each week he wants to put, in a different color, the things that are just for that week - a movie that he wants to see, or a one time activity that is happening.<br/>
<br/>
  this is just an example of what is happening in our lives NOW vs. where we were a year ago and how the deschooling process is intricate and long.  just when i start to think - &quot;ug, what are we doing?&quot; he comes up with something that makes it clear we are still moving, flowing, and growing and not as stuck as it might appear.<br/>
<br/>
  anyhow - i don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ve been unschooling/deschooling, but i was relieved to hear during a chat the other day that a year is not really that long.  i think one of the main things that i needed to do is LET GO  and TRUT and *then* i could be more genuinely interesting, and interested, and engaging - without a hidden agenda.<br/>
<br/>
  warmly, Lyla<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126951656">-=-I think that I&#39;ve been waiting for child led learning.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I went to see what&#39;s in my unschooling collection about child led  <br/>
learning, and found that on the first page of the search, the  <br/>
references were all explaining away from the idea--it would appear in  <br/>
quotes and then be discussed as a concept that&#39;s not so good.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/c4r5wu">http://tinyurl.com/c4r5wu</a><br/>
<br/>
That might be a good place to look for now!<br/>
<br/>
One of those references was the unschooling nest page:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/nest">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>
<br/>
Unschooling starts off as what you don&#39;t do, but within a few months  <br/>
it needs to become what you DO do.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I need to be more engaging, more interesting. I want my ds to be a  <br/>
person in this family, not a child that needs to be kept apart from  <br/>
&quot;grown up&quot; concerns, issues or tasks.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You want him to be a person in the world, I think.  A real person. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
There are lots of people in the world, and you don&#39;t share with all of  <br/>
them your finances or your chores.<br/>
<br/>
Treating him as an adult isn&#39;t what unschooling is, either, though you  <br/>
might be interested in The Continuum Concept.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/toddlers">http://sandradodd.com/toddlers</a><br/>
There&#39;s a link there.  In extreme cases, the recommendation is against  <br/>
toys or kid-stuff.   But toys have an ancient lineage, and there&#39;s  <br/>
clearly value in playing.<br/>

Find interests you both might like.  Watch TV with him.  Find  <br/>
interesting information about the shows he likes.  If something comes  <br/>
up in one of the shows and you have something around the house that  <br/>
would tie in to that, maybe get it out.  Leave it on the coffeetable.<br/>

That is a great phrase, &quot;moving, flowing, and growing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- so - he has since gone through phases of interest in baking...-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When kids want to make cookies, they probably do NOT want to find a  <br/>
recipe, go shopping, gather all the ingredients, blah blah blah to the  <br/>
point where all the baking tools have been washed and put back in  <br/>
their places.    They *might* want to help break the eggs or measure  <br/>
the flour or form cookies, or take them off a baking sheet with a  <br/>
spatula or something fun and brief.<br/>
<br/>
When parents try to turn a curiosity into a long forced-march through  <br/>
an hour and a half of kitchen work, kids learn to not express curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
Same with yard work.  If a child asks to help in the yard or garden,  <br/>
find a short, simple, fun thing.  Smile and than him even if he only  <br/>
does it for two minutes.  He still learned.   Don&#39;t shame him with the  <br/>
idea that what he did wasn&#39;t worth anything because he didn&#39;t get up  <br/>
early and sweat for two hours straight.    If he wants to pull three  <br/>
weeds, that&#39;s three weeds pulled!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes parents in such moments are overcome by the voices of the  <br/>
relatives they had when they were little, and they start saying weird  <br/>
things like &quot;You&#39;re not any help,&quot; or &quot;If you really want to help, why  <br/>
are you quitting?&quot; or &quot;If you&#39;re not going to do it right, don&#39;t do it  <br/>
at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If learning is your goal and not &quot;discipline&quot; or chores or training or  <br/>
teaching, then you will see the learning in a kid even passing by long  <br/>
enough to hand his dad a wrench or bring his mom a glass of ice water  <br/>
when she&#39;s mowing.   Help is help.   Learning is learning.<br/>

Engaging kids in activities is a good thing as long as you have willing<br/>
participants.  What makes unschooling really work well, is bringing<br/>
things to your kids to explore and your kids to things.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m interested in things, my kids may find them interesting too, in<br/>
the same way that when one of my kids are interested in things, I may<br/>
find them interesting too.  I do think that the more things that I find<br/>
interesting, especially the things they like, the more learning happens<br/>
and the more engaging things are for everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
TV can be very engaging, yet I&#39;ve found that almost always, my kids will<br/>
drop the TV for an engaging activity, and sometimes they are<br/>
simultaneous activities.</div>

<br/>
Yes, cooking has been turned into many a math lesson for homeschoolers. <br/>
While it&#39;s nice to note in a parent&#39;s mind, that a child is doing some<br/>
mathematics while measuring, to see how natural it can be to learn math,<br/>
I&#39;ve seen more often, forced lessons in math through measuring.<br/>
(however, it&#39;s about the same kind of learning that happens in schools<br/>
on worksheets, so if one is counting for making portfolios or such, I&#39;d<br/>
count it)<br/>
<br/>
Cooking, for my kids, is all about the outcome!  Pouring and mixing are<br/>
all good fun, but they like to eat the cookies more than all of that! <br/>
One day, they may want to double a recipe or half a recipe, but until<br/>
that day comes, making cookies, is still about making cookies for the<br/>
sake of having cookies and licking batter off of spoons.</div>

off my feet for a while due to a postpartum complication. We had just put in<br/>
a vegetable garden (we&#39;re in southern California) and weeds were threatening<br/>
to overtake it, so I asked a couple of my kids if they would mind helping<br/>
out by picking 10 weeds each. The 8yo ran out to the garden & was back in a<br/>
flash, happily announcing she&#39;d picked 11 weeds. The 10yo was outside for<br/>
almost an hour. When she came back in, she had a whole bouquet of weeds in<br/>
her hands. She spread them out on the table to show me what she&#39;d found.<br/>
Instead of picking 10 weeds from the garden, she&#39;d hunted all over the yard<br/>
for *10 different kinds* of weed. In the middle of showing each different<br/>
one to me & describing where she&#39;d found it, she suddenly gasped and ran<br/>
back outside. Came back with yet another species--&quot;I just remembered seeing<br/>
these in the side yard yesterday!&quot; She was so excited and we had a great<br/>
time trying to ID them.<br/>

<br/>
YES.  I loved fairy tales, Mother Goose and folktales as a kid, and  <br/>
was always thrilled when one of our &quot;readers&quot; (school literature books  <br/>
in elementary school) had folktales!  I have a fair-sized collection  <br/>
now, some from then, some from when my kids were little, and some from  <br/>
before my time.<br/>
<br/>
Two that I never liked were Rumplestiltskin and The Little Red Hen.    <br/>
The messages they &quot;teach&quot; and what seems to be the moral of the story  <br/>
baffled me in both cases.   Their good guys were bad guys<br/>
<br/>
When parents feel they have a very short time to turn their children  <br/>
in to &quot;responsible adults,&quot; the chance of a botch-job is huge.   When  <br/>
those same parents can decide rather to provide those same children  <br/>
(if they haven&#39;t messed them up totally, I mean) with happy learning  <br/>
opportunities, the cartoon sun comes up and the cartoon birds sing.   <br/>
(Or in my back yard today between snow clouds, real sun and real  <br/>
birds. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
For those on the cusp of getting it, or about to beat another level  <br/>
and move on to new unschooling perspectives, there&#39;s a collection of  <br/>
those &quot;Hey, I really get it!&quot; or &quot;I used to get it and now a TOtally  <br/>

If what you mean is to offer up a life with lots of interesting stuff to <br/>
do and see and experience, then yes.<br/>
<br/>
You might put on music in the car that you think he&#39;d like.<br/>
You might point out a construction site and take the time to stop and <br/>
watch the machines at work.<br/>
You might buy a new kind of fruit when you&#39;re shopping.<br/>
You might notice he likes certain video games and look up other similar <br/>
games and get one for him.<br/>
You might just tell him a joke you think would appeal to him.<br/>
You might record a tv show or movie you think he&#39;d enjoy.<br/>
You might take him on a trip, stopping at all the national monuments <br/>
along the way, if that&#39;s something he&#39;d enjoy.<br/>
You might volunteer together in an animal shelter.<br/>
You might go camping.<br/>
You might invite a friend over.<br/>
You might go to a baseball game.<br/>
You might buy really good colored pencils.<br/>
You might put a puzzle out on a table in the living room.<br/>
You might ask him to help you cut up apples for apple pie.<br/>
You might go for a walk together and listen to him tell you every single <br/>
little detail of a comic book or a movie or a video game.<br/>
<br/>
Some people say &quot;offer&quot; and I picture them just asking a kid, &quot;Do you <br/>
want to go for a walk and tell me about your new video game?&quot; Doesn&#39;t <br/>
sound too appealing, put that way. Sounds like you&#39;re asking for a book <br/>
report.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people come here and say, &quot;Yeah but...my kid isn&#39;t interested.&quot;<br/>
Unschooling parents do &quot;entice&quot; - make new experiences seem appealing. <br/>
After a while, our kids are easily enticed because they have the <br/>
experience of knowing that we won&#39;t insist on continuing something that <br/>
isn&#39;t interest to them and that much of the time what we offer does turn <br/>
out to be fun.<br/>

<br/>
I think this is a bad thing for him to &quot;understand,&quot; as it&#39;s false.<br/>
<br/>
His thoughts on how much he wants to tooth fairy to leave him are not  <br/>
as important as yours are (especially if he believes there&#39;s a tooth  <br/>
fairy &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
It is VERY valid to give children lots of choices and freedoms.<br/>
It&#39;s not at all valid to claim or tell them or even to talk as though  <br/>
his ideas, feelings and thoughts about money, home ownership and car  <br/>
maintenance are as important as anyone else&#39;s.   And it&#39;s just as  <br/>
wrong for a mom to think her thoughts about how or whether he sits,  <br/>
sleeps, plays games, picks his nose are just as valid as his.  Some  <br/>
things are more his business than his parents&#39; (when parents are  <br/>
trying to live generously with their children and let them have lots  <br/>
of choices).   Some things are way more your business than his  <br/>
(whether to switch from an electric stove to natural gas, or whether  <br/>
to use birth control, or whether it&#39;s more important to have the sewer  <br/>
line repaired than to go to Disneyland (if there&#39;s not money to do  <br/>
both).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sure.   If you can&#39;t decide whether it&#39;s appropriate, imagine whether  <br/>
you would do it for an adult friend with a similar interest.  That&#39;s  <br/>
been a good tool for me to use.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess in the end, I&#39;m confused as to where the line is between  <br/>

<br/>
If a young child asks &quot;where do babies come from?&quot; the first and best  <br/>
answer is the shortest.  &quot;From inside their moms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That might be all he wants to know for years.   Or he might have  <br/>
another question in a few seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Be willing and available and open to a very short discussion or a long  <br/>
one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It depends on how much he wants to know and how long he wants to dwell<br/>
on that particular idea.<br/>
<br/>
After a while it feels more authentic to interact with your kids in a<br/>
natural way.  It&#39;s the same way you&#39;d have a conversation with a good<br/>
friend or spouse.  You wouldn&#39;t lecture your spouse about some cool<br/>
subject that you guys stumbled across together, you&#39;d likely discuss it<br/>
and look things up until one or the both of you moved on to something<br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it is with kids, if you treat them as another human being,<br/>
rather than a &quot;little&quot; kid that is less than or subject to your<br/>
authoritarian adultness.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite lines in the movie Matilda is &quot;I&#39;m smart your dumb,<br/>
I&#39;m big your small, I&#39;m right your wrong, and there&#39;s nothing you can do<br/>
about it.&quot;  The two really big adult figures in the movie said that to<br/>
Matilda.  She was smart enough to know differently.  The dad also said<br/>
&quot;When a person is bad, that person deserves to be punished.&quot;, then<br/>
Matilda repeats that to herself, with an emphasis on the word &quot;person&quot;. <br/>
She reflects on that, because the dad had intended to say &quot;kid&quot;, but<br/>
said &quot;person&quot; instead, which introduced the idea that a kid can punish<br/>
their parents when they are bad.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that kids and adults are seperate and inequal in many<br/>
households has been a topic of conversation in our house many times<br/>
because of that movie.  It&#39;s so pervasive in our culture that it takes a<br/>
complete shift in our thinking and attitudes to &quot;get&quot; how to be<br/>
authentic in our interactions with our kids.</div>

Sounds to me like you need to stop the speech therapy or at least find a <br/>

<br/>
You can find a speech therapist who will help you work with him, rather <br/>
than taking him in to a stranger. There isn&#39;t anything magical about <br/>

would like to see him not have this to deal with, after all that he&#39;s <br/>
already had going on in his short life.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of when some kids really want to be able to read, but they <br/>
simply aren&#39;t cognitively ready. It can be upsetting to them. <br/>
Unschooling parents might feel really bad for them, really wish they <br/>
didn&#39;t have to go through the frustration. We commiserate. And we try to <br/>
find ways to help them do what they want to do - we read to them and for <br/>
them and we protect them from other people who might shame them.<br/>
<br/>
So - you could do the same. Be close at hand to speak for him when he <br/>
wants it, protect him from anybody who might shame him, and commiserate <br/>
with him. Reassure him that his speech is going to improve in the same <br/>
way we reassured our later readers that they would, when the time was <br/>
right for them, learn how to read.<br/>
<br/>
Again, he is only 8. Lots of kids still have speech problems at that <br/>
age. I&#39;ve seen kids play with other kids who don&#39;t speak the same <br/>
language at all, though, and seem to have a good time together. If his <br/>
friends are not being patient with him, maybe you could help him find <br/>
some kinder more patient friends. Maybe playing with just one friend <br/>
would work out a lot better for him.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she is doing with him during sessions:  making art with Blo pens<br/>
&gt; and such.  It is fun and light, but we usually don&#39;t do the homework<br/>
&gt; because he doesn&#39;t bring it up and I am not going to force him<br/>
&gt; to do it.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My personal alarm bells go off at any type of therapy activity that risks <br/>
turning a creative art making action into something forever then associated <br/>
with the negativity of &quot;I&#39;m broken/ I need to be fixed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the blowing action in that exercise that&#39;s important right? Getting him <br/>
to purse his lips firmly and strengthen those muscles.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some blowing things that my dd, now 9, enjoys very much:<br/>
Blowing up balloons and then letting them fly around the house and chasing <br/>
them.<br/>
Blowing bubbles through a straw into bubble bath or soap suds (still at 9).<br/>
Blowing bubbles through a straw into milkshakes (normally frowned upon - <br/>
:p~~~~)<br/>
Blowing into a harmonica, kazoo or penny whistle.<br/>
and yes sometimes blowing paint for the specific purposes of making <br/>
something with those painted textures, at *her* instigation and desire.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us some of the other exercises. I bet we can come up with at least <br/>
three other &quot;just play&quot; activities that our kids enjoy for their own sake, <br/>
that your son might find fun and would still be moving the muscles properly, <br/>
so maybe he need not go for his weekly reminder that he&#39;s still failing at <br/>
speaking right.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And for the HARD work of learning<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; where the palate is and how to move it, she is doing<br/>
&gt; things like this:  they each take a blue popsicle and each<br/>
&gt; use it to paint their own palate blue.  Then they use flashlights<br/>
&gt; and mirrors to watch as they try to open and close their<br/>
&gt; palates.  DS is very successful at the actual activities...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is it genuinely &quot;hard&quot; work? Or are you being told it is hard work to <br/>
justify the need for an expert and an expensive series of therapies? Babies <br/>
learning to talk don&#39;t learn how to move their palate as a special skill - <br/>
it is part of making sounds that is automatic and developmental. I wonder <br/>
how good it is to be moving the palate in isolation from making sounds. Are <br/>
you passing on to your son that this is &quot;hard work&quot; instead of something <br/>
that will flower naturally as he heals from his surgery and becomes more <br/>
accustomed to speaking with his new mouth in (maybe) a new language?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m making an assumption, that you can correct if I&#39;m wrong, that he is also <br/>
learning a new language, English - or perhaps hearing English being spoken <br/>
all around him with different accents than he might have become used to. <br/>
That might be part of his slow pace in learning to make fully intelligible <br/>
sounds after his surgery.<br/>
<br/>
What about singing, karaoke (we have a machine Granny gave us for Christmas) <br/>
or playing monsters or lions or dragons (roaring sounds to open the throat)?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be like me trying to learn to write neatly using my toes.  Sure, I<br/>
&gt; could learn, but it would take real effort. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could consider it work. Or you could consider it fun that would improve <br/>
with practice. People do learn to write and paint with their toes if they <br/>
have lost their arms for some reason. (Also with their mouths) They learn <br/>
because it enables them to communicate with writing or drawing. If they were <br/>
being prevented from making marks until they had done a bunch of toe <br/>
strengthening exercises, I bet their progress would be slower than if they <br/>
were given the means to make marks and the opportunity to look at the <br/>
results. I bet their family members and close associates would be able to <br/>
read their foot written words sooner than strangers seeing it for the first <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Real effort need not be a negative if there is a personally meaningful real <br/>
reason to make the effort. All the good reasons that I might have for my dd <br/>
to learn something that is challenging to her are pointless if she doesn&#39;t <br/>
have a good reason of her own.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, if it were me, I would not continue with this therapy that is <br/>
distressing my child for the time being, and see how things go. You can <br/>
always return to therapy, perhaps with a different therapist, later. If you <br/>
do, involve your ds in the choice of therapist.<br/>

gregarious, funny, wry kid being ignored by people who<br/>
won&#39;t take the time to understand his really amazing<br/>
insights. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Harder than speech therapy and fear?<br/>
<br/>
I had a thought overnight.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s &quot;therapized&quot; into speaking better, he might be convinced that  <br/>
learning is pain and takes professionals.   The methods speech  <br/>
therapists use could be used at home, occasionally, maybe for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Holly didn&#39;t have &quot;r&quot; when she was six or so (maybe seven; the story  <br/>
will be in archives somewhere from that time, maybe).   She wanted  <br/>
speech therapy.  I said it would come around.    She pressed.  I took  <br/>
a speech therapist friend to dinner and Holly went.  She gave us some  <br/>
ideas.   She loaned us a game that might help with R.   Another speech  <br/>
therapist friend was at a music party we went to and she and Holly  <br/>
went into the kitchen for a while to get food for people and she told  <br/>
Holly a couple of things about the way people&#39;s mouths are shaped on  <br/>
the inside and the places tongues touch to make sounds.   Nothing  <br/>
deep; no test; no fingers in the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
So Holly thought about it and practiced on her own, and asked me &quot;Does  <br/>
&#39;room&#39; have an R in it?&quot;  The best little practice tool she had was  <br/>
&quot;Roger Rabbit&#39;s buried treasure.&quot;  She would say that to herself  <br/>
sometimes, listening to see if her &quot;r&quot; was getting better.<br/>
<br/>
And one thing I knew was that if she could read she would have made  <br/>
faster progress.  I also was sure that &quot;faster progress&quot; wasn&#39;t as  <br/>
important to me as her learning to read in her own, natural way.<br/>
<br/>
Her speech became clear and her reading blossomed, but not right then  <br/>
that year.  But she knew then and knows now that with just a little  <br/>
help and with interested friends who will answer her questions, she  <br/>
can work things out gradually on her own.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe an occasional visit to a speech therapist (or different ones  <br/>
different times) every couple of months would help.  Ask them for  <br/>
ideas and tricks, rather than offering to pay them to take  <br/>
responsibility for seeing him through to perfection.  That might take  <br/>
the pressure off of everyone.   Maybe ask this professor to recommend  <br/>
one or two of his best students who need to make a little money, and  <br/>
invite them over just to hang out, play cards or watch movies, and to  <br/>
make suggestions you and your son could use on your own.<br/>
<br/>
If he feels he did it himself in his own way, it will make other  <br/>
things easier in the future.<br/>

Blowing into a harmonica, kazoo or penny whistle.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kazoos only work if you hum.    That might be therapeutic too (or  <br/>
not)--the action of making a sound with a kazoo by the action it  <br/>
takes.  It&#39;s not technically humming, because the lips aren&#39;t closed,  <br/>
but it&#39;s vocalizing in the throat the way humming works, only with a  <br/>
kazoo in the lips instead of lips closed.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, blow REAL stuff!  Blow out candles.  Make paper boats and  <br/>
blow them across the table with a straw.  Not &quot;paper boats,&quot; but you  <br/>
fold a strip of paper 90 degrees--a little strip like the size of your  <br/>
finger, and fold the paper in half and set it on edge so it&#39;s like a  <br/>
corner, and blow into the corner.  You can race them on a table or  <br/>
knock each others&#39; off the edge.<br/>
<br/>
You can do it at fast-food places while you&#39;re waiting for your order,  <br/>
with half a straw paper or part of a receipt.<br/>

<br/>
Just another thought on this whole subject. The mom hasn&#39;t really said how extensive of a cleft or how much surgery was needed.<br/>
<br/>
Speech therapy for a child with a cleft palate repair is usually so much more involved than for a child with just some articulation errors.? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s true that simple articulation therapy can often be done at home, this might not be the case with an involved cleft palate and lip repair.? I&#39;m a speech language pathologist but this is not my area of expertise and I would definitely refer any child with a cleft to someone who is more specialized in this area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It can involve multiple surgeries, a prosthetic palate, and even swallowing difficulties.? This may be something that initially needs a more intensive approach in a therapy setting because of medical issues.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
will be in archives somewhere from that time, maybe).   She wanted  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just thinking about straw paper when reading about excerises that<br/>
one could do for blowing!  I also thought about blowing on blades of<br/>
grass to make that high pitched wistle sound, or blowing across the top<br/>
of bottles or through a hole in cupped hands that are clasped together,<br/>
or spit wads blown from a straw.  Each one of those activities would<br/>
require a different mouth motion to produce the desired outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn by playing!  Of course this could be done naturally without a<br/>
therapist!  School professionals take something they consider drudgery,<br/>
like math, and try to make it fun by adding games and such.  Outside of<br/>
that context, it could be just fun and games, no drudgery attatched. <br/>
The same could be applied to the speech therapist, calling the<br/>
excercises work and offering rewards.  The reward is being able to speak<br/>
and be understood.  All those excercises can just be fun and games,<br/>
without the drudgery attatched.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717739270"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can find a speech therapist who will help you work with him, rather<br/>
 </span></blockquote>than taking him in to a stranger. There isn&#39;t anything magical about<br/>
what the do there - you can do it and keep it fun and light. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
When I had speech therapy it was short (only 2 or 3 weeks), and not<br/>
conclusively done and finished, but helpful.<br/>
My speech was better from those moments on.  And I enjoyed what I learned<br/>
and did during those sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t take place easily in discomfort and what he may actually<br/>
learn in therapy he doesn&#39;t want may not be things you want him to learn<br/>
about, like what others think one &quot;has&quot; to do.<br/>
<br/>
Speech therapy is not deep stuff to learn or to do.  It shouldn&#39;t be hard.<br/>
Maybe he just doesn&#39;t like the person doing the therapy.  Or maybe he just<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do it right now.  Couldn&#39;t he wait and do speech therapy in<br/>
his own time?  I had no therapy until I was about 10.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is telling you there&#39;s a window of opportunity for him to get<br/>
this done, that theory has been debunked.  Studies are finding that nerve<br/>
growth and cognitive development (in the absence of nerve disease or<br/>
degeneration) are possible throughout life.<br/>

he really just wants to express that it is hard and wants you to help <br/>

I&#39;m not sure if you said, before, but are you in the room with him <br/>

It is sounding to me like you really feel like he needs this and needs <br/>
it now and that it would be wrong of you to not make it happen somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Even given what Gail said, I still think you might be able to set it up <br/>
more comfortably for him - to go, say, once a week, and spend that time <br/>
with the therapist figuring out what you&#39;re going to work with him on <br/>
during the week. And also that you might, as his mom who knows what is <br/>
fun for him, be able to do some of the exercises in more fun and natural <br/>
ways. Can he sit in your lap there? Can one of his siblings do it with him?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073562121">Here&#39;s something to consider.  If her son is supposed to learn from the<br/>
therapist, I am not quite sure why the mother couldn&#39;t also learn with him<br/>
and cut the sessions from 3 (or 4?) times a week to fewer, and do more with<br/>
him rather than it being so *much* therapy-from-the-therapist.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine why it *must* be done -that- often anyway.  I&#39;m not the<br/>
therapist.   Has the mother asked if that frequency is really essential and<br/>
what would a slower pace likely mean?<br/>
<br/>
And has the therapist suggested a timeframe for this to end up?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another thing:  why is the mother asking about this if the therapy is<br/>
not a choice but absolutely necessary *right now* ??<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that therapy is a choice.<br/>
<br/>
And if it is the unschooling mother&#39;s choice, why couldn&#39;t it be the<br/>
unschooling child&#39;s choice?  He is young for therapy.  But is he really so<br/>
young that he can&#39;t help in making the decision about this therapy?  It<br/>
seems to me that he is trying to.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the absence of choice for therapy could be misconstrued as<br/>
absence of choice in other things too... if they&#39;re deemed important<br/>
enough.  I would feel the same way if it were a life or death situation or a<br/>
situation that would definitely lead to permanent irremediable disability.<br/>
Has the mother asked if that&#39;s the case?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that more options may be had than appear at first glance.<br/>
Which would be a really great reason to bring the situation to a list.  If a<br/>
mother isn&#39;t sure, and wants to be sure, some readers could come up with<br/>
good questions to ask for the purpose of finding better options, if that&#39;s<br/>
what&#39;s being looked for.<br/>
