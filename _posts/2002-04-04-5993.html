&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll introduce myself, belatedly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I live in Burke and have 4 kids and WAY too many pets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, what do you consider WAY too many pets?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have 2 dogs, 1 cat, 1 rat, 1 leopard gecko, 1 kingsnake, 1 parakeet, 2<br/>
&gt; fish, and up until last night, 1 mouse (now resting in peace with 3 ex-rats<br/>
&gt; in a consecrated corner of the yard).  Oh, and I work with horses 3 days a<br/>
&gt; week but none of them live with us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (The house is about 1,000 sq ft. but we have a decent sized suburban lot.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nancy, in San Diego with 2 kids, one dh, and many pets.  I&#39;ll be one of<br/>
&gt; those eccentric 90-year-old ladies who keeps pet snakes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re looking into snakes at the moment. What is a good snake for beginners?<br/>
ATM we have 2 dogs, 3 cats, 10 guinea-pigs and some fish. I&#39;d like some rats<br/>
too but DH says we have enough mouths to feed :-(<br/>
And the weird thing is, so many people in North Virginia are allergic to<br/>
animals. In the UK I never met one person who had any allergies except pollen.<br/>
the people here are just sick all the time :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We only have one dog, one cat, a tortoise, and a squirrel right now but<br/>
that&#39;s because we are living in an apartment. Grandma has our other dog (a<br/>
border collie ---THE best breed:) other cat and snake (a boa constrictor<br/>
called Monty). But we have had almost every kind of pet you can think of<br/>
(love ferrets).<br/>
I think snakes and rats are great pets for kids and hey snakes don&#39;t do the<br/>
allergic thing either -- although we also have never had any problems with<br/>
allergies in our house. The only pet I would hesitate against again would<br/>
be a large iguana. We had one who was about 3 foot long and extremely mean.<br/>
She looked like a little dinosaur and we were all afraid of her:(<br/>

<br/>
We had, at one point, three dogs, one cat,<br/>
one bird, and one snake.  Now we simply have<br/>
2 dogs, a collie cross we just got in<br/>
Janurary (she was a rescue dog, beautiful and<br/>
sweet, but too damn smart for her own good,<br/>
she can clear our 6 foot fence with out even<br/>
touching it!  We have long talks about the<br/>
garden which has a 2 foot fence--we call it<br/>
the dog deterent, and I&#39;m just hoping she&#39;s<br/>
smart enough to realize it&#39;s meaning).  Our<br/>
other dog is a 13 year old malamute/shepard<br/>
cross, who I picked up when he was about 6<br/>
weeks old.  We had hampsters but they have<br/>
gone onto hampster heaven.  I&#39;d like to get a<br/>
fish tank but have no where to put it!<br/>
