<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; **So maybe this should go on the list of songs to inspire unschoolers<br/>
&gt; too.  Not quite an anthem, but maybe a lullaby.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More anthem-y would be Kodachrome, by Paul Simon, which contains the<br/>
&gt; immortal words &quot;When I think back to all the crap I learned in high<br/>
&gt; schoool, it&#39;s a wonder I can think at all.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay!  They&#39;re both in, for the future &quot;UNSCHOOLING COLLECTION&quot; to be sold <br/>
&gt; for $19.95 late at night on local UHF stations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have to include John Mayer&#39;s &quot;No Such Thing&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NO SUCH THING &quot;Welcome to the real world&quot;, she said to me<br/>
Condescendingly<br/>
Take a seat<br/>
Take your life<br/>
Plot it out in black and white<br/>
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings<br/>
And the drama queens<br/>
I&#39;d like to think the best of me<br/>
Is still hiding<br/>
Up my sleeve<br/>
They love to tell you<br/>
Stay inside the lines<br/>
But something&#39;s better<br/>
On the other side<br/>
I wanna run through the halls of my high school<br/>
I wanna scream at the<br/>
Top of my lungs<br/>
I just found out there&#39;s no such thing as the real world<br/>
Just a lie you&#39;ve got to rise above<br/>
So the good boys and girls take the so called right track<br/>
Faded white hats<br/>
Grabbing credits<br/>
Maybe transfers<br/>
They read all the books but they can&#39;t find the answers<br/>
And all of our parents<br/>
They&#39;re getting older<br/>
I wonder if they&#39;ve wished for anything better<br/>
While in their memories<br/>
Tiny tragedies<br/>
They love to tell you<br/>
Stay inside the lines<br/>
But something&#39;s better<br/>
On the other side<br/>
I wanna run through the halls of my high school<br/>
I wanna scream at the<br/>
Top of my lungs<br/>
I just found out there&#39;s no such thing as the real world<br/>
Just a lie you got to rise above<br/>
I am invincible<br/>
As long as I&#39;m alive<br/>
I wanna run through the halls of my high school<br/>
I wanna scream at the<br/>
Top of my lungs<br/>
I just found out there&#39;s no such thing as the real world<br/>
Just a lie you&#39;ve got to rise above<br/>
I just can&#39;t wait til my 10 year reunion<br/>
I&#39;m gonna bust down the double doors<br/>
And when I stand on these tables before you<br/>
You will know what all this time was for <br/>
<br/>
