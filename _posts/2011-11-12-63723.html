<div id="ygrps-yiv-705454545">A couple of times lately, maybe three times, a mom has said she keeps yelling at her kids.<br/>
My neighbor behind me keeps yelling at her kid, her boyfriend, her (quite grown) brother, that poor new puppy they got.  She just yells and yells and it seems nobody&#39;s listening.<br/>
<br/>
Playing around, I came to a page on Joyce&#39;s site that will help, and if that&#39;s not enough, there&#39;s a second page, on mine, that might.<br/>

<br/>
That second page talks about yelling being a better choice than hitting, and it is!  But one step away from hitting isn&#39;t all the way toward peace and partnership.  If you&#39;ve only gotten as far as yelling, keep moving.  Make a better choice than yelling, as often as you can.  If that&#39;s not very often, work on that.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want your kids to hear you, you might try not saying anything sometimes, and whispering sometimes.<br/>
If you want your kids to hear you, maybe say less.  <br/>
