<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578899874">I think I just read some reviews about that one at Netflix.  Directed by<br/>
Roman Polanski, if it&#39;s the same one.  There are probably 50 versions listed<br/>
at IMDb, but many are very very old, and probably not easy to get hold of<br/>
anyway.  I read some references to _Throne of Blood_ by Akira Kurosawa<br/>
saying that it was the best version of all, even though it is not the exact<br/>
story.  Anyone seen that?<br/>

I remember seeing the BBC verions of Shakespeare&#39;s plays on TV when I was a<br/>
kid. Some were better than others. I don&#39;t remember seeing Macbeth<br/>
specifically but I know they did it.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t find video, there&#39;s Marcia William&#39;s Tales from Shakespeare<br/>
that includes Macbeth. She did it in comic book format. It&#39;s really good and<br/>
not dumbed down.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve read Bruce Coville&#39;s picture book versions before going to a couple of<br/>
plays. I loved his version of the Tempest.<br/>
William Shakespeare&#39;s Macbeth<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655738893">MacBeth news frm the Simpsons is below.  I cut off the end of the article on <br/>
purpose.  I&#39;m sorry I read it.  I don&#39;t want the rest of you to know what <br/>
will happen. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t know when the episode will be shown, and I&#39;m <br/>
guessing not until next season, considering the time of year, but I could be <br/>
wrong.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 The creator of Harry Potter, the world&#39;s most popular boy wizard, is set to <br/>
cast a spell over &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; her spokeswoman said Wednesday.<br/>
 <br/>
J.K. Rowling will bring a touch of magic to the animated sitcom by appearing <br/>
as herself in an episode set in England. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can confirm that she did a voice-over for &#39;The Simpsons,&#39; &quot; the <br/>
spokeswoman told Reuters. <br/>
In the episode, Rowling will meet beer-guzzling Homer Simpson and his family <br/>
when they visit England to find a girl with whom Grandpa Simpson had a <br/>
wartime fling. <br/>
<br/>
&quot; &#39;The Simpsons&#39; bump into J.K. Rowling outside a bookshop and they talk all <br/>
about Harry Potter,&quot; Don Payne, executive producer of the show, told the Sun <br/>
newspaper. <br/>
<br/>
The episode will also feature &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; star Sir Ian McKellen, the <br/>
paper said. <br/>
<br/>
The family go to see him perform the Shakespeare play &quot;Macbeth,&quot; but bring <br/>
him bad luck by saying the play&#39;s name aloud -- in defiance of a well-known <br/>
theatrical superstition.</div>

Escondido in February...  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Googling around film/Shakespeare sites, most recommend Orson Welles version<br/>
of Macbeth, it seems.  I remember seeing the Scottish play in Los Angeles<br/>
with an 8th grade field trip, with Vanessa Redgrave as Lady Macbeth.<br/>
<br/>
Ian McKellen starred in a BBC version made in 1979, with Judi Dench.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve just spent an hour Googling without breakfast!  (trying to remember<br/>
the actor Vanessa Redgrave must have upstaged :-)<br/>

of good film versions accounts for the recommendation.<br/>

<br/>
Did anyone see Patrick Stewart on The Daily Show last night?  He had a few<br/>
good jokes about his X-Men co-star &lt;g&gt;  And it appears he&#39;s a bit tired of<br/>
ST:TNG, can you imagine???<br/>
