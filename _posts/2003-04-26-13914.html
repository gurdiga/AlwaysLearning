If you have something to tell us about your own unschooling life, please do.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a question, great.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in a bad mood, so if this came from someone who&#39;s sincere and wonderful <br/>
and it was just a little error and I&#39;m overreacting, first weigh how much <br/>
time it will take everyone on the list to open that e-mail with no forward <br/>
attached and THEN see if it&#39;s worth getting grumpy at me.<br/>
<br/>
And to the rest of you:  Hi!  <br/>
I&#39;m trying to get unschoolers in contact with each other again here. I had <br/>
taken a few years off (three?) when the boys got tired of helping me maintain <br/>
a weekly meeting.  But Holly&#39;s interested and several families are too, so <br/>
I&#39;m back at local activity.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s going to a prom.  For a bit it looked like he was going to two of <br/>
them, and he reserved a tux for two weekends, but he&#39;s down to just one prom. <br/>
 Los Alamos High (90 miles away), so not convenient.  But the good news is he <br/>
saves over $100 by not taking his now-former girlfriend to her high school&#39;s <br/>
prom.<br/>
