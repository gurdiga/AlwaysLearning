<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770363927">I have a quote on my John Holt page.  I&#39;ve just been called to defend  <br/>
it. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t remember where I wrote it, though.  I Do see the  <br/>
problem with it.    I thought someone here might remember where, as it  <br/>
was only last year.   Here&#39;s what&#39;s on my page:<br/>
<br/>
RECENT QUESTION AND COMMENT<br/>
<br/>
Someone wrote to me: &quot;Iâ€™m starting to see why you admire John Holt.  <br/>
Will you tell me more about him?&quot;<br/>
I responded:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I admire his courage and his writings.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He had oddnesses, and I don&#39;t admire him so much as a human. He  <br/>
wasn&#39;t married. He didn&#39;t have kids. What he learned he learned from  <br/>
other people&#39;s kids in classrooms and when visiting in their homes,  <br/>
and he was SO interested in kids that their lives were different just  <br/>
for his being there, so what he saw often was how a child is in the  <br/>
presence of a really interested and interesting adult. That&#39;s the part  <br/>
I want to emulate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because John Holt was SO interested in children, every time he  <br/>
interacted with one, he saw a child interacting with a fascinated  <br/>
adult. THIS is one of the things unschoolers need to remember. When  <br/>
the adult brings boredom, cynicism, criticism and doubt to the table,  <br/>
that&#39;s what he&#39;ll see and that&#39;s how he&#39;ll see it, and it will be no  <br/>
fault of the child&#39;s whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
With your happiest, most open mind, read what John Holt wrote years  <br/>
ago and leave this place stronger.<br/>
