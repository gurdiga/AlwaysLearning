&lt;&lt; I will dig out my lemon curd recipe....I may have a crumpet one somewhere <br/>
although I&#39;ve never made these since leaving home. It would be fun to do with <br/>
the kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you go to google.com and put in lemon curd recipe<br/>
or crumpet recipe<br/>
you&#39;ll probably get 35 of each.<br/>
<br/>
I almost don&#39;t use my cookbooks anymore, unless it&#39;s for a favorite <br/>
particular thing.  <br/>
