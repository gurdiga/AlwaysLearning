<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526869320">Holly:   That&#39;s a pretty sunset.<br/>
<br/>
It just so happens that lately we&#39;ve been goofing with the words to songs, <br/>
and had already, yesterday, messed with &quot;Tomorrow&quot; from Annie, so I started <br/>
singing:<br/>
&quot;The sun&#39;ll go downâ€¦<br/>
<br/>
(and I paused, thinking she would sing &quot;in a minute&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Holly, full voice, on key, with feeling:  &quot;Tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me, <br/>
&quot;It&#39;ll be tomorrow in a minute<br/>
   If that&#39;s true.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly repeating the last line of the verse, in rhythm, without (literally!) <br/>
missing a beat: <br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re a Jew.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, reporting from where Holly&#39;s musically connecting the dots.</div>
