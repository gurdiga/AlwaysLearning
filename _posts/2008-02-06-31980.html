beta site with free downloads until March.  After that I&#39;m not sure  <br/>
what the charge will be, but I&#39;m enjoying it right now!<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t know how you feel about such things, but at the<br/>
UnitedHollywood.com site, there&#39;s a lot of information about the<br/>
ethics of many of the TV show download mechanisms, the writers&#39;<br/>
strike, and residuals.<br/>
