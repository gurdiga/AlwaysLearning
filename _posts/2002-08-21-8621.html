<div id="ygrps-yiv-296379876">Did anyone get to see the asteroid on the weekend?<br/>
We dragged the tumbling mat out to the front yard and our hot chocolate<br/>
and layed there with binoculars looking at Vega and westerly along the<br/>
edge of Hercules and never saw it.  We did have fun watching the bats<br/>
though. <br/>
<br/>
Did anyone see auroras last night?  It was raining here, no sky to watch.<br/>
