<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095077381">I joined this board recently and have been reading through some of the<br/>
posts.  I&#39;m not new to homeschooling or unschooling. In my later high<br/>
school years we became friends with a family of homeschoolers which<br/>
led us to try it for a short time. I and my younger brothers were sort<br/>
of homeschooled the year I would have been a senior.  I never did any<br/>
work and ended up getting my GED.  <br/>
When my wife became pregnant and our first child was born, we<br/>
discussed homeschooling as basically the only option that we were<br/>
willing to consider.  Neither of us were happy with the schooling we<br/>
had gotten or the overall experience of schools.<br/>
I&#39;ve just recently gotten around to reading How Children Learn and am<br/>
playing with reading Learning All The Time, though I may need a break<br/>
for something a little more fun.<br/>
I&#39;ve kind of filled my brain the last week or two, reading this board<br/>
and another local board.  I&#39;ve been reading a lot of stuff on Sandra&#39;s<br/>
site as well as all those links.  I&#39;m also in the middle or rethinking<br/>
my treatment of my boys in terms of punishment and getting them to act<br/>
a certain way, thanks again to Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>
So I&#39;ve basically got a lot of thinking to do, a lot of personal<br/>
change/growth.  I keep seeing the error of my ways in different areas<br/>
and finding areas in which I&#39;m satisfied with how we&#39;ve been working.<br/>
 I suppose in a sense I&#39;m deschooling, but I don&#39;t really feel that I<br/>
have a lot of the hang ups that so many of us have to work on.  My<br/>
biggest hurdle is just relaxing, knowing that things will be okay.<br/>
I would like to say thanks to Sandra because I feel I&#39;ve learned so<br/>
much the last couple of weeks, and so much of this started by<br/>
stumbling onto her site.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re welcome!   I love to hear when people have benefitted from all that.<br/>
<br/>
And I need to say thanks to the dozens of people who have said &quot;Sure!&quot; when <br/>
I&#39;ve asked if I can appropriate their words that I find hither and yon around <br/>
the discussion lists and message boards!   <br/>
<br/>
Another site, if you haven&#39;t already discovered it, way more organized than <br/>
mine and more...   more... logical?   Engineerly?   is this:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/</a><br/>
<br/>
One cool thing about Joyce&#39;s is that you can start and finish it, wheras with <br/>
mine, you can start and get lost, and come back out and start and get in a <br/>
loop, and come back out and...   I have pages I&#39;ve lost.   Some I&#39;ve found after <br/>
months and realized I never announced its presence and never linked it <br/>
because I had wanted to find that leafy background, or make a particular set of <br/>
links. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
