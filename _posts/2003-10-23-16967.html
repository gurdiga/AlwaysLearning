&lt;&lt;  I know some people like this and others who<br/>
<br/>
never run into situations like this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Don&#39;t you think it says alot about how open we are to others?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES.<br/>
Some people are too still and don&#39;t make eye contact (figuratively or <br/>
literally) and are paranoid of others, and so they can&#39;t get much excitement-business.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend just because we have the same birthday (to the year).   <br/>
Wolfgang Marquardt.  He sent me an IM on AOL.  I could have ignored it, but I <br/>
thought &#39;what the heck.&#39;  He was in northern Germany and just loved American <br/>
cultural trivia like how much does a Christmas tree cost?  What do we pay for <br/>
natural gas and electricity?  He&#39;s living in Washington now, about to marry an <br/>
American.  He&#39;s been to visit me twice, and I need to send him a wedding gift!  He <br/>
has sent me birthday cards in German (which is cool) and we&#39;ve had LONG long <br/>
chats by instant message about his impressions of the U.S. once he came here, <br/>
after all those years of distant interest.  He&#39;s lived in Texas and Washington.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think it has alot to do with our desire to know things and discover <br/>
things.   Also, whether we are open to others.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am unquestionably a nosy curious kind of &quot;how come?&quot; person and always have <br/>
been.  There&#39;s a kind of hyperactivity in the social area of my mind. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This Friday night (yikes!  Tomorrow!) I&#39;m going to a potluck to visit friends <br/>
I&#39;ve known since second grade (three of them) but one I hadn&#39;t seen since <br/>
high school.  I don&#39;t know who else will be there, but I&#39;m really excited.  I <br/>
just need to cook.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or maybe some of us just attract weirdness?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is true of me too.<br/>
You might have noticed it even onlinory.  I poke them back and say &quot;WHY are <br/>
you being this way?  What&#39;s the deal?&quot;  Most people clam up, squint their eyes, <br/>
turn the other way.<br/>
<br/>
I have another couple of very swirly-lifed friends, and our conversations can <br/>
go on for HOURS when we catch up with each other.<br/>
<br/>
I have come back up to warn that no one with seizure disorders or heart <br/>
conditions or a life should read the following paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
Holly thinks it&#39;s funny that my stories of childhood friends and later <br/>
relationship and marriages is so interconnected and confused.  Yet lots of them are <br/>
still in contact with one another.    A girl she really likes would have been <br/>
my neice if I hadn&#39;t divorced my ex-husband and on the other side, she&#39;s the <br/>
daughter of someone I knew since he was born, whose sister married somone I had <br/>
(have?) a pact with since we were 15 that as soon a both of us were <br/>
unattached, we&#39;d get together.  I&#39;m still in contact with him (though she&#39;s divorced) <br/>
and I talked to him Monday, and I&#39;ll see her (the ex-wife still-aunt of Holly&#39;s <br/>
friend Naomi) on Friday night with the others.   We saw Naomi and her mom <br/>
Ruth (the younger sister of my ex-husband, who was one of the three kids I was <br/>
&quot;raising&quot;  when I was 21 to 23 years old--she was 12-15 then) at my sister&#39;s <br/>
housewarming last the 12th.  Turned out my sister&#39;s new house is three miles from <br/>
Keith&#39;s best friend Bob who was our best man.  Up the same road, between <br/>
Brazos and Chama.  One of Bob&#39;s ex-girlfriends once kinda stalked my friend Jeff <br/>
and she got crazy for a while, but she&#39;s fine.  I WAS going to go with her to <br/>
Denver this last weekend for an SCA ceremony involving our former housemate <br/>
Wendy...  I&#39;ll just stop because the story doesn&#39;t ever stop.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make a chart of all those stories for my friend Barbara once, and <br/>
it would have had to be a three-dimensional thing with some kind of overlays <br/>
on some of the characters.  Could not figure out how to chart it.   <br/>
