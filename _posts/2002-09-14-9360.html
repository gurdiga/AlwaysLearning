<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462745067">The last week has been hard in a lot of ways. It started quite nicely, though <br/>
frantically, as my son turned 13, we had his birthday party, and church <br/>
started up for the year (I am Director of Religious Education at a Unitarian <br/>
Universalist church), all in the same weekend. (This is not remarkable...it <br/>
happens every year.)<br/>
<br/>
We have had an ongoing problem with a sick cat, and now it looks like the <br/>
other cat has the same thing. They&#39;re both elderly, and have thyroid <br/>
problems. One of them keeps missing the litter box when she pees, so much of <br/>
the time when you go into the bathroom there is cat pee on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Then a couple days ago my mom, who has been fighting cancer for almost five <br/>
years, went into the hospital, as the cancer has spread to her brain. It <br/>
looks like it&#39;s very treatable, and that she&#39;ll be okay for now. But she had <br/>
a seizure and the law in FL, where she lives, says she can&#39;t drive until <br/>
she&#39;s been seizure-free for six months. She&#39;s also worried she&#39;ll lose her <br/>
job. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, my father, who left my mom when she got sick, is being totally <br/>
bizarre and my sister is taking it very personally and is hurting very badly <br/>
from it. (My family was really quite sane and normal up until a few years <br/>
ago.)<br/>
<br/>
I am just overwhelmed. My family (partner and son) are being so wonderful and <br/>
supportive, but it&#39;s hard. Last night I screamed at Julian. He was just being <br/>
sweet-obnoxious-noodgey to Beth, and she asked him to stop several times, but <br/>
he didn&#39;t...and I just screamed. He was so startled and his eyes filled with <br/>
tears. I apologized and he said he knew I was upset.  But...argh!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have another Good Week post, that I will put in another post. Don&#39;t <br/>
want to water it down with this stuff. Thanks for listening,<br/>
Kathryn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356850681">Kathryn, I&#39;m so sorry.<br/>
<br/>
We had a long spell of this when my dad was sick, and then right after,<br/>
my husband&#39;s dad.  You end up feeling like you have to be strong for<br/>
everyone, especially your child.  I wish I&#39;d given in to the little<br/>
crumples along the way, it might have saved me from the falling down hard<br/>
when it was all over. <br/>
 <br/>
I have an old sick cat, he has kidney failure, and so I know what you<br/>
mean about missing the box more often than not.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t really help to know other people understand because you still<br/>
have to live it every day.  But things are always changing and this will<br/>
change too. <br/>
Hold on Kathryn and let the people who love you help, that&#39;s what they<br/>
really want to do. <br/>
