I have more questions:<br/>
What about the warning by even mainstreem pediatrics that there<br/>
should be no tv for children under the age of two because it will<br/>
inhibit their developement? Why wouldn&#39;t you be concerned about that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Why should I? Do these &quot;mainstream&quot; pediatricians spend a lot of time <br/>
with unschooled, mindfully parented children?<br/>
<br/>
I have proof it doesn&#39;t. They are 19 and 11 and 46 and 45.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you have ever read Naomi Aldort or listened to her CD&#39;s you know<br/>
that she highly recommends unschooling and yet she says no tv until<br/>
age 9.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
ANd if you want to believe what she says without question, we cannot <br/>
stop you. But if you want to question *WHY*, we can give you our <br/>
opinions too.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that none of us are expecting you to believe anything *we* <br/>
say either without deeply questioning us and, more importantly, <br/>
*YOURSELF*!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have taken many classes from Tom Brown at his willderness Awareness<br/>
school. A man named John Young who was his student for 10years taught<br/>
a class on Cayote teaching(basically unschooling by answering a<br/>
childs questions with another question)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like the Socratic method.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that you are believing everything these people are <br/>
TELLING you *without* ASKING questions!!!<br/>
<br/>
Kind of ironic. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, I don&#39;t answer each and every question my kids ask <br/>
with a question. Very often, they simply want an answer, so I give them <br/>
what they ask for.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 He showed us that tv and more<br/>
so video games limit the mind to the point where they did studies on<br/>
kids that played alot of video games and were only using 5% of there<br/>
brains.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: Huh??? How is that measured?<br/>
<br/>
OH! You mean the &quot;researchers&quot; were only using 5% of their brains? <br/>
Gotcha! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 How exactly they test that I am not sure except that I know<br/>
that some kids lost the ability to see in three D and an Art teacher<br/>
had to take them out side and show them that this tree was actually<br/>
farther away then that tree.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: You *know* this? How?<br/>
<br/>
And yet my 11 year old gamer is an artist. And completely understands <br/>
dimensions and depth of field. How do you explain this?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
For me watching tv puts me in tunnel vision and takes me away from<br/>
hearing my inner voices (messages from my spirit guides)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
But you didn&#39;t have TV as a child and don&#39;t have one now as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: Why do you think that is? Would that be the same with <br/>
a child/adult who has always had free access to tv? What would make the <br/>
difference?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What about the power of subliminal over the tv.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: What about it?<br/>
<br/>
I believe my mind is stronger than a box. Is yours?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it really allowing<br/>
for a young child to choose for themself when they are bombarded with<br/>
commertials that push hard for kids to get addicted to say soda etc?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: Do you think children are so powerless and able to be <br/>
manipulated? Mine aren&#39;t. Why do you think yours are?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is that really freedom of choice for them?.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: What? Being able to choose whether to &quot;get addicted&quot; <br/>
to soda??? Or free access to TV?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those advertising companies study extensively how to brainwash kids <br/>
into wanting there<br/>
stuff and the government does not protect the people from very toxic<br/>
ingredients in some so called food that is directly targeted towards<br/>
children.(Aspertame, propalene glysol etc.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: Why do you think SOOOO much money is poured into <br/>
advertising? Don&#39;t you think that, if it WORKED, they wouldn&#39;t have to <br/>
spend really big bucks to figure out how to brainwash kids? If it were <br/>
*that* easy, wouldn&#39;t they find cheaper and easier ways to do it? Why <br/>
do you think they spend so much money every year on advertising? <br/>
Because it WORKS???<br/>
<br/>
Do you think it&#39;s the GOVERNMENT&#39;S job to protect you from toxic <br/>
ingredients? Why can you protect yourself? Do you not know what&#39;s toxic <br/>
and what&#39;s not? Why? How would you change that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
What about these issues?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: What about them?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that if you are able to<br/>
completely let go of these fears even subconsiously that none of<br/>
these will effect you or your children?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: What do *you* think?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I am fearful?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I believe that could be true but I am not sure how to do that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: How do you get over fear?<br/>
<br/>
Would you hide from it? Would you run from it? Would you instill that <br/>
fear into others?<br/>
<br/>
Or would you embrace it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
These are all the deepest darkest fears I have about tv. I have never<br/>
heard anything that challenged thier validity until now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: Then how could you make an informed decision?<br/>
<br/>
Did you hear many others challenging the school system before you <br/>
decided to pull your children out of school? *Very* few people <br/>
challenge the validity of school; most praise it and worship it. Give <br/>
money to it (voluntarily even!)). Why did *you* buck that system and <br/>
remove your kids from it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Now I am all about letting go of fear and expanding my awareness..<br/>
First you have to be aware of the fear.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: Why must *I* be aware of fear?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did not see myself as<br/>
fearing tv for my children before, but now I see where the fear has<br/>
been instilled in me. I did not miss tv as a child tho. My dad would<br/>
read us esp stories around the table after dinner.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Socrates/Coyote: Do you fear not being able to read to your children <br/>
around the table after dinner? Do you believe them (TV and reading) to <br/>
be exclusive of each other?<br/>
