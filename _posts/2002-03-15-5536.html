<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027082480">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m Kate and I currently live in Abu Dhabi which is in the United Arab<br/>
Emirates (everyone used to have to look this place up until recently!) It<br/>
is next to Saudi but actually very liberal and life is not that much<br/>
different from the west. I&#39;m originally from England and my husband is from<br/>
Louisiana.<br/>
<br/>
We have 3 boys aged 14, 12, and 7. My husband is currently a SAHD and I am<br/>
a developmental child pscyhologist. I am a professor at an Arab women&#39;s<br/>
university here and involved in setting up the child development program<br/>
and doing lots of research on Bedouin families.<br/>
<br/>
We have homeschooled/unschooled/learnt at home/played since we decided<br/>
formal schooling wasn&#39;t for us after our oldest son tried kindergarten 9<br/>
years ago. I usually tell people we unschool as that title seems to define<br/>
us as well as any. We have been thru various levels of our own development<br/>
within this process and so at times have been more &quot;schooly&quot; than others.<br/>
Currently we have journals in which I help the boys to define their weekly<br/>
goals and then they work independantly to accomplish those. <br/>
<br/>
Dh, Mark, has been more nervous about our lack of formal sit-down work than<br/>
I have been but since he has been home fulltime for the last 2 years has<br/>
really come around. Our youngest wanted to read last year so they worked<br/>
thru &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Lessons&quot; and now Ben is reading very<br/>
well. His dad is really feeling great about the whole thing which is nice.<br/>
<br/>
Other things about us: We attachment parent (also another research area of<br/>
mine:) I&#39;m vegetarian, we like to travel, love animals, the boys are into<br/>
skateboarding, playing guitars, soccer, and karate and dh is into rocks<br/>
(he&#39;s a geologist).<br/>
<br/>
Anything else anyone wants to know just ask:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804363036">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you all would consider me an old hat at this, but <br/>
have been unschooling my 3-yr-old since birth. I&#39;m a SAHM in <br/>
Asheville, NC and decided to join your group a month ago, but we have <br/>
been vacationing in Colorado. What a learning adventure! Driving <br/>
cross-country with a toddler. Jacob had a great time (driving time <br/>
included). I also heard about your group from my friend, Pam Tiger.<br/>
I don&#39;t know why she thinks she doesn&#39;t know anyone home/unschooling.<br/>
We were both part of a homeschool playgroup for all ages. I have <br/>
given her LOTS of info on unschooling (I have always known I was <br/>
going homeschool, unschool ray of light came while I was pregnant). <br/>
I am also part of a HOME group here and a Waldorf-insipred handwork <br/>
group. Thanks to you Sandra for your advocating unschooling. My family<br/>
have heard info from some of your articles and Unschooling Hdbk <br/>
to &quot;explain&quot; unschooling. Waiting for my unschooling bumpersticker <br/>
from Home-Ed discussion board (Anne Ohman). Let me know if you would <br/>
like one; she is asking $3. Hope to be able to go to conference.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings on your journey,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132392475">Since I have decloaked, I guess I should introduce myself.  :-)  I&#39;m Karen <br/>
Gibson and live in north Alabama.  We began homeschooling August 1996 and <br/>
within a few short months discovered unschooling.  Since then, there&#39;s been <br/>
no turning back!  You can&#39;t put the genie back in the bottle. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hubby and I have three children.  The eldest graduated (Kat, 19) last year <br/>
and recently married.  The younger two (David, 16, and Charles, 14) still <br/>
live at home (thank god!) and busy pursuing their various interests, <br/>
including karate, legos, computer programming, computer games, and various <br/>
other stuff.    I write, crochet, and maintain my own <br/>
website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.leapingfromthebox.com">http://www.leapingfromthebox.com</a> .  And hubby is a network <br/>
administrator, so you can imagine the assortment of networked computers we <br/>
have here!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking a couple of weeks and so far enjoyed the tone of this <br/>
list.  Glad to be here!<br/>

&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>

Yup, Kat&#39;s life has changed so drastically in the last year.  She got her <br/>
license Jan of 2003, first job April 2003, engaged in May 2003, moved out <br/>
and in with her fiance July 2003, and then tied the knot at a civil <br/>
ceremony two weeks ago.  &lt;sigh&gt;  She was ready, but her dad and I were <br/>
not.  What is it with these kids?  You raise them to think for themselves, <br/>
make their own decisions, and then they really go out into the world and do <br/>
just that!!!  Scary!!   LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059571216">Hi all,<br/>
My name is Tracy.  I just joined this group because I am trying to get <br/>
a grasp on the unschooling idea.  I have been homeschooling for 3 <br/>
years.  My 7 year old is extremely bright but &quot;school&quot; has been <br/>
torture for us both.  This isn&#39;t want I wanted for him, or his two <br/>
younger brothers.  I want learning to be exciting and natural.  Not <br/>
forced and frustrating. I need to make a change and someone suggested <br/>
unschooling.  I guess I just need some guidance.  I wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
where to begin.  I&#39;ve read a number of posts and many people&#39;s <br/>
definition of unschooling.  But I don&#39;t even know what kinds of <br/>
resources I should have available or anything like that.  I would <br/>
really appreciate some advice.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all answered these <br/>
kinds of questions over and over but I hope you don&#39;t mind one more <br/>
time.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

newer unschoolers called Unschooling Basics.   It&#39;s listed at <br/>

I doubt these links will be useable directly if you get this by e-mail, but <br/>
if you go to the yahoogroups site and click on messages, they might be.   Or <br/>
just go to the main page and branch out from there, but...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529454455">Hi!  I&#39;ve been lurking for the past couple of weeks. We are all <br/>
recovering from the flu here, so I haven&#39;t had the energy to jump in and <br/>
participate, but have certainly enjoyed reading everyone&#39;s posts!<br/>
My name is Jennifer. I live in NC with dh and our 3 children Webb(18) <br/>
Rebecca(14) and Joe(8) We&#39;ve unschooled all along.<br/>
2 of my sisters 4 kids are unschooled as well (the other 2 go to <br/>
school). Since my sis is a single mom, my niece and nephew spend most of <br/>
their days with us (they are 16 and 8)<br/>
My oldest is thinking in terms of going to college next year, so we have <br/>
been navigating the ins and outs of that!<br/>
anyway, I just wanted to say hi!<br/>

mean and miserable? Some of those parents should&#39;ve swatted themselves<br/>

++++++++<br/>
<br/>
This conversation reminds me of a book the children and I just started called THE WILLOUGHBYS (by Lois Lowry.)  The parents are awful and don&#39;t &quot;like&quot; their children.   <br/>
<br/>
Hi all!  I&#39;m Jill, mother to Benjamin (age 11 yrs.) and Margaret (age 8 yrs.)  We live in Augusta, Maine.  We have always homeschooled and were introduced to the concept of unschooling by Angela about 5 or 6 years ago. (Hi Angela!)  It&#39;s a concept I believe in entirely.<br/>

Stop quite frequently because Jeffrey (12) is really into video games.  <br/>

video game.  I hear &#39;we&#39;re just looking&#39; the most.  Why do adults <br/>

right in front of them, I think it&#39;s too much for the child to handle.  <br/>
If you have to drag the child out of the store or yell at the child to <br/>
leave the store, that child is being put in a position too challenging <br/>
to handle.  I&#39;m not talking about a parent who is holding a rational <br/>
conversation with the child.  I&#39;m talking about a parent using an angry <br/>
or mocking voice.<br/>
<br/>
If I can&#39;t buy a video game and my children still want to visit the <br/>
game shop, we go in with the knowledge that we aren&#39;t buying today but <br/>
just looking at options for when we are ready to buy.  I&#39;ve had my son <br/>
specifically decline visits to the game store when he knew he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be able to handle browsing only.  <br/>
