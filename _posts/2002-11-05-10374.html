<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895465041">One other thing...<br/>
<br/>
Something I&#39;ve started to do when we travel is to<br/>
search out the local homeschooling groups online<br/>
before we go & email them for info.  I&#39;ve even made it<br/>
to a couple of park days in other parts of the<br/>
country, which is kinda fun.  And they can tell you<br/>
about the kid-friendly attractions in their area.<br/>
