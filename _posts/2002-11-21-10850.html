&lt;&lt; Actually, Tuck brought it up, twice.  She said that all the kids she has <br/>
 seen of this race beg for money and that the child is of a different <br/>
 race than she is.  I&#39;m curious what race that is, as her comment seems <br/>
 rather stereotypical. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had some experiences with gypsies up North. Many of them had moved into the <br/>
Portland area and there were large groups living in communal style areas.<br/>
I had three experiences in which they joined the health club I worked at. <br/>
They misused the sauna, (washing their clothing in the sink and hanging it <br/>
all over the sauna to dry) wore inappropriate clothing on the work out <br/>
equipment (women had to wear LONG dresses no matter what) and had a party in <br/>
our loft that was very interesting to say the least (included a goat).<br/>
Does that mean I treat any Gypsies I meet with contempt. Certainly not.<br/>
But I do recognize that there are cultural differences BIG time!!<br/>
<br/>
There was a large group of them that sued a CA club over &quot;discrimination&quot; <br/>
when they wouldn&#39;t allow them to hang clothing in the saunas and wear <br/>
innappropriate clothing on the workout equipment among other issues.<br/>
So were we being &quot;prejudice&quot; when a large group tried to join our club and we <br/>
very, very carefully covered all of our rules regarding those issues? (more <br/>
so than with other potential members probably) Or were we using our past <br/>
experiences with them to protect ourselves?<br/>
I&#39;d like to think the latter. We ended up asking a huge group of them to <br/>
leave when they refused to comply.<br/>
Fortunately, the threat of a lawsuit was stopped when the club showed the <br/>
paperwork they were required to sign, stating those very things were against <br/>
club regulations.<br/>
Judgement? Yes.<br/>
Prejudice?  I don&#39;t believe so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599557248">I disagree. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said all, so I&#39;ll ammend my statement <br/>
to &quot;many children on occassion take things that are not theirs to take.&quot; <br/>
 For instance, Lexie was taking the coins and dollars that I would take <br/>
out of my pocket and put them in her piggy banks.  When I asked her <br/>
about it, it was obvious she didn&#39;t realize there might be a problem <br/>
with that.  I told her just to ask as I might have plans for that money. <br/>
 Now she comes in and says &quot;can i have these coins?&quot;  Janene was taking <br/>
the money from the girl scout dues tin.  She didn&#39;t realize she was <br/>
doing anythign wrong.  When I discovered this, I asked her to not do <br/>
that anymore as it wasn&#39;t our money and that if she needed money to <br/>
simply ask me.  No big deal.  At age four, I&#39;m sure she thought that it <br/>
was just a nice place to get money to put in her special wallet.  (I <br/>
also replaced what she took).  But she was technically stealing.  <br/>
<br/>
I was wrong to call it stealing.  But yes, I do think that the majority <br/>
of children need to be taught that they have to pay for things before <br/>
they eat them or leave the store, and that the toddler rule of <br/>
possession is not necessarily true.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I was also remembering my nephew when he was two took a candy bar <br/>
from a store.  I didn&#39;t notice until he was out of the store. <br/>
 Technically this is stealing.  But the reality is--he didn&#39;t understand <br/>
the rules of aquisition.  (spelling?)  I understood it, the candy was <br/>
right there, at his level, and so he took one.  There is candy at the <br/>
bank that you can just take (in a bowl on the table, suckers, for the <br/>
kids).  The rules of our society are often complex.  The other day we <br/>
were at the store and after getting the items I wanted, I said, OK, <br/>
let&#39;s go home and Janene said, astonished, &quot;but mommy, we have to PAY <br/>
first.&quot;  Like I had meant, let&#39;s leave without paying.  But she&#39;s <br/>
getting the rules down.  <br/>
<br/>
And there are also children that steal for other reasons.  A need that <br/>
is not being met, whether attention or food or happiness.  but for most <br/>
kids, it&#39;s simply a part of learning the rules.<br/>
<br/>

How completely stereotypical AGAIN!! Funny, but everyone accusing Tuck of <br/>
having that problem is displaying THEIR prejudices.<br/>
I&#39;ve met Tuck.<br/>
I can NOT imagine that her merely mentioning the cultural differences as a <br/>
reason to explain a certain behavior (yes, begging IS acceptable in some <br/>
cultures and she didn&#39;t say it was the answer, she said it was possible) <br/>
means she would treat that little girl any differently than any other child <br/>
in the group that did the same!!<br/>
Sheesh people.  The kid stole, that&#39;s a good reason to be cautious with her.<br/>

I never said I was above anybody. This is not about being right or <br/>
wrong. This is an invitation to become part of a process of stripping <br/>
away the bull and going straight for the guts of the situation. You <br/>
can either accept or decline and, really, that is cool.<br/>
<br/>
But, I leave you with this --this may be the most challenging <br/>
unschooling experience that a lot of people in this list might want <br/>
to consider. It is right up our alleys. We could even start making a <br/>
list of those &quot;catch phrases&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
You aren&#39;t enlightening me Liza. I know about a lot of those phrases.....hate <br/>
&#39;em.<br/>
Even hymnals have some phrases that need stripping (&quot;white as snow&quot; was used <br/>
for a reason).<br/>
I was raised in a multi-ethnic family. Indian, Swiss, Norweigan and Scot <br/>
being the bloodlines....Eskimo and Athabaskan Indian being my adopted family.<br/>
I lived in Hawaii and was spit on, called names and otherwise tortured in <br/>
ways I choose to not think about often over MY race.<br/>
So don&#39;t start on some soapbox over prejudice and racism with me please.<br/>
I&#39;ve lived it.<br/>
I&#39;m related to many ethnic backgrounds. Love them deeply. I don&#39;t need your <br/>
help in getting enlightened on the topic, believe me.<br/>
<br/>
I have a Barbadian friend that gets lumped in as &quot;African American&quot; all the <br/>
time, from black people too. She&#39;s tired of it. Lots and lots of people don&#39;t <br/>
realize the ways they are insensitive to race or cultural differences.<br/>
<br/>
Tuck didn&#39;t state anything bad about the fact that many people of the race <br/>
this child was were begging in her experience.<br/>
She only noted it as a possible explanation. She never said all people of <br/>
that race do this. Get over it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  He&#39;s never had his parentage challenged or cry because a <br/>
 neighbor child tells his child that she is not welcome in their home <br/>
 because her child is the wrong color.  I am not calling you a racist, <br/>
 but I am asking you to think hard.  To get past the defensiveness and <br/>
 look closely at things.  Ultimately, only you can say. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming that we haven&#39;t been touched by racism just because we aren&#39;t <br/>
black. Don&#39;t assume that.<br/>
Maybe your bad experiences, which were all too real and very related to <br/>
racism, have caused you to assume wrong things about people.<br/>
Like the fact that people saying how cute your girls are and so on, are only <br/>
cloaking racism. You sound very prejudice yourself.<br/>
