<div id="ygrps-yiv-416547829">Hello Pat and all -<br/>
I had such a similar situation with ds (5yo) who was on the computer ALL the <br/>
time...it was quite obsessive, imo....I REALLY struggled with whether it was <br/>
&#39;appropriate&#39;, whether I should do something, etc.....<br/>
<br/>
He LOVES playing the Disney Tarzan computer game and any Magic School Bus <br/>
games....neither of the other 2 kids in the house are so <br/>
computer-oriented.....<br/>
<br/>
Even when we were on vacation in a rental house with a computer last fall, he <br/>
played the Tarzan game....he identified who in the family was good at each <br/>
level and would summon that person to play....he showed incredible <br/>
persistence bec. at that time we didn&#39;t know you could go back to a level <br/>
when you &#39;died&#39; - we thought you had to start all over and even though we <br/>
started from the beginning again and again, he still pursued trying to <br/>
&#39;master&#39; the game....I would have quit after starting over once or twice but <br/>
he really persisted....kind of like Thomas Edison and the lightbulb!  <br/>
<br/>
As I said, he really loves the magic school bus computer games....and altho, <br/>
I felt more &#39;comfortable&#39; with these games bec. they were &#39;educational&#39;, he <br/>
was still on the computer a lot.....like you, it would be a beautiful day and <br/>
he would be drawn to the computer....<br/>
<br/>
He and his sister (7yo) would have discussions about how she missed him bec. <br/>
he was on the computer so much.....they made a schedule so that she could <br/>
play with him and then he could be on the computer and back and forth....<br/>
<br/>
He asked for all the Magic School Bus computer games that were advertised on <br/>
the ones he had.....I REALLY hesitated bec. I thought, &quot;I&#39;ll NEVER see him <br/>
then!&quot;  But he was serious so we got the ones he was missing.....he was so <br/>
eager....after they arrived, he played with each one intently for a short <br/>
while....that was in February.....he is hardly on the computer at all right <br/>
now.....<br/>
<br/>
My point is that you never really know how situations will play <br/>
out....Imagine if you could know that they will be on the computer for a <br/>
whole month of the year and then hardly at all for the rest of the time - <br/>
would that be &#39;balanced&#39;?  Does &#39;balance&#39; mean in a day? In a week?  In a <br/>
year?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, look at the value in the computer game....that&#39;s what helped me <br/>
tolerate Tarzan....I admired his persistence at the game and how he asked for <br/>
help in levels that he was not comfortable with....What would happen if I <br/>
denied him the experience of persisting at an activity until he figured it <br/>
out?  What would happen if I denied him the experience of working at <br/>
something when the motivation was there - as opposed to &quot;it&#39;s 9am, time to <br/>
work...it&#39;s 5pm time to not work&quot;?.....I want him to follow his heart and <br/>
intuition - and I can&#39;t do that if I decide for him what he &#39;should&#39; do.....<br/>
<br/>
Try to do what is right in each situation.....sometimes you&#39;ve got to step <br/>
away from the big picture and look at each step....It felt right to honor his <br/>
request for the computer games.....it didn&#39;t feel right to deny him something <br/>
he really wanted based on my own bias and concern for how he spent his <br/>
time....it&#39;s not all up to me.....I wanted to be respectful, and being so <br/>
meant finding the games.....Similarly, it never felt respectful - always <br/>
arrogant the way I did it - when I would fuss about his computer time.....and <br/>
now it is not an issue and I wish I had trusted him that it would work <br/>
out.....in whatever way......<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could say that I handled it all so smoothly....I had many days of <br/>
frustration and &#39;it&#39;s such a beautiful day!&#39; and &#39;exercise&#39; etc etc <br/>
etc.....You &#39;should&#39; _____ .....<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah, one way I thought to help me through it was to join the play - I <br/>
told myself that I could join him for an hour of computer play - can do <br/>
anything for an hour, right?....so I put myself there by him on the computer <br/>
and we did have fun......<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s the computer story here.....hope you can work things out in your <br/>
home....<br/>
