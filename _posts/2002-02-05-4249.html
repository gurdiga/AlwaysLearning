<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745085563">We also try to eat dinner together.  There are 7 of us and we all have many<br/>
and diverse interests.  About the only time all of us are home together is<br/>
during dinner.  It isn&#39;t a formal thing (other than trying to convince the 3<br/>
yo to ask for things to be passed rather than to climb on to the table to<br/>
help himself).  We have running jokes (like how many minutes it will take<br/>
someone to mention a bodily function--one of grandma&#39;s pet peeves).  The<br/>
kids don&#39;t seem to feel coerced about it (it is like a stampede when the 2yo<br/>
hollers &quot;Time E-e-e-a-a-at.&quot;)  When each is done, they wander off, back to<br/>
what they were doing before.<br/>
<br/>
We do almost all of our eating at the kitchen table.  Numerous spills,<br/>
ruined carpets, etc. have given us a lesson.<br/>
