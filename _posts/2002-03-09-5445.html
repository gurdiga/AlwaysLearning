&gt;What are the rules about kids for the Sacramento deal?  I&#39;ve been planning to <br/>
&gt;take Holly with me to Sacramento this year, but she&#39;s only ten, and if that <br/>
&gt;means she has to be with an adult all the time I&#39;d rather leave her home.  I <br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t want to impose on anyone else, and she won&#39;t want to hang around <br/>
&gt;with me all the time.  I&#39;ve never had kids with me before, so could always <br/>
&gt;ignore that part of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seriously, I need to know this, too.  The only reason Will loves <br/>
conferences is because he is able to be free to move about the hotel on <br/>
his own.  (Between the 4 of us--dh, me and the two teens--we kept up <br/>
with him most of the time, but he didn&#39;t realize it.)  Not having that <br/>
freedom, or *rules* about it, would be a serious disincentive for us to <br/>
fly across the country.<br/>
<br/>
And Kelly, one of the best parts about the Mindful Conference, for kids, <br/>
anyway, was the Box City and the Ball room.  Box City was just that--a <br/>
room full of moving boxes to be done with as they will.  And the ball <br/>
room was full of foam balls or those ball-pit balls like at McD&#39;s (can&#39;t <br/>
remember now).  There was also a quiet room, where kids could go if they <br/>
wanted to do quiet things.  And a girls only room, and a boys only room, <br/>
too.  And a game room.  And a piano that anyone could play set up in the <br/>
middle of the common areas of the conference part of the hotel. And one <br/>
year there was a room set up as a Waldorf style kindergarten.  (That was <br/>
the year it wasn&#39;t so unschooly.)<br/>
<br/>
Those were all the things Will liked.<br/>

&lt;&lt; .  It&#39;s probably about the same at a Christian <br/>
 conference, except starts with a prayer and more of the speeches would be by <br/>
 men who were saying America needed to get back to its Christian purpose, and <br/>
 the family was the model of the nation and of the church, and men were the <br/>
 head of the family. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And everyone asks you what church you go to.<br/>
I avoid Christian sponsored conventions or workshops...and I&#39;M a Christian <br/>
for crying out loud!! Just not their brand I&#39;m afraid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of following directions....<br/>
I like to just figure things out, I hate reading directions. But when putting <br/>
furniture or BBQ grills together, I&#39;ve discovered I have to read the enclosed <br/>
directions (yuck) or I can&#39;t figure it out, silly me.<br/>
My 12y.o. ds buys the gaming guides for nearly everything he plays and reads <br/>
them intently.  He loves having directions to help him figure out the games.<br/>
Not sure if that will spill over to him liking directions on other topics, he <br/>
tends to dabble with other materials, not do step by step things.<br/>
But I totally agree that it&#39;s more to do with an individual&#39;s learning style <br/>
and personality than anything.<br/>
And just because a person likes to figure things out on their own with no <br/>
directions, does not mean they won&#39;t be good at the directions should they <br/>
need them.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to have some get togethers away from the conference in SC too. <br/>
Like meeting up at a family friendly place...don&#39;t know what&#39;s available in <br/>
Columbia.<br/>
Maybe an unschooling.com reunion?  Or union perhaps, since you can&#39;t have <br/>
&quot;re&quot; when you&#39;ve never met!! LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Monday&#39;s a holiday. We can certainly plan something else for afterwards if <br/>
anyone&#39;s interested. Unfortunately almost everything &quot;cool&quot; is closed on <br/>
Mondays in town ;-( We have a beautiful zoo, though, that&#39;s open on Mondays. <br/>
The beach is only 2 hours away. We have a lake here, too with a public <br/>
&quot;beach&quot;. (I like water!) Y&#39;all don&#39;t HAVE to go home at all---stay around a <br/>
week or so and visit! We have a big garage, big back yard for tents, and lots <br/>
of floor space ( just NOT for the conference weekend! I&#39;M not even staying at <br/>
home!)<br/>
<br/>
Or do you mean some time OTHER than conference weekend? Columbia&#39;s fairly <br/>
centrally located on the east coast if you&#39;re talking about NY to <br/>
Disneyworld/land (whatever)---10 hours.<br/>
<br/>
On the registration form I&#39;m asking for your unschooling.com/AlwaysLearning <br/>
screen name. I&#39;ll have that on your badges so that we can &quot;know&quot; who we all <br/>
are. For the &quot;union&quot;.<br/>
