<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934663320">Reading Sandra&#39;s book Big Book Of and was thinking about principles versus rules this morning.  Came across this article this morning<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In there is the statement  &quot;Whether or not I agree with the guidelines, we have to follow the rules&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I find that idea horrible but fascinating, because it seems to be common (not on this list, but in the world at large).  The rule is there, so no further thinking required, apparently.  Eeeeek.<br/>
