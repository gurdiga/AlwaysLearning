-=-If  it&#39;s possible to see inside the mind of a character it&#39;s more likely<br/>
to  happen in a movie, where body language and facial expression, eye<br/>
movement  and breathing are actually visible to the viewer.    Good<br/>
character development in a movie won&#39;t need narration to convey  the<br/>
character&#39;s thoughts and motivations.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
 <br/>
Something else about this:<br/>
It&#39;s the kind of subtle acting not seen since storytelling around a fire in  <br/>
castles or woods, if even then.<br/>
 <br/>
Stage acting doesn&#39;t do it.  But very-close-up (&quot;over edited&quot;?   Was that the <br/>
disparaging word?) TV and movie acting can show facial twitch and  eye <br/>
movement that can be read by those with interpersonal intelligence to read  it.   <br/>
Denzel Washington.  Robin Williams.   When  they&#39;re not talking, it&#39;s as though <br/>
they&#39;re thinking through the thoughts their  character would be thinking at <br/>
that moment, and it shows in their posture,  tension of muscles, the pupils of <br/>
their eyes.   <br/>
 <br/>
Some people don&#39;t read that.  Some people can be standing next to  someone <br/>
who is distraught or anxious or embarrased or bursting with excitement,  and <br/>
unless the person says, &quot;HEY, BUBBETTE,  I am  <br/>
[distraught/anxious/embarrassed/full-of-news,&quot; Bubbette might act entirely  inappropriately to the situation.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe (possibly) that&#39;s one clue to why someone would reject TV/movies and  <br/>
prefer books, which can be experienced in the absence of social skills.   But I <br/>
suspect a large percentage of the anti-TV contingent consists of  parrots.<br/>

Ds is Tivoing &quot;Death to Smouchie&quot; right now for his dad. We watched it <br/>
the other night and ds thought it was so funny, strange, distrubing that <br/>
his dad would like it.<br/>
He&#39;s right.<br/>
Its also just campy and comic bookish for me.<br/>
Too bad the foul language (my stock and trade) is edited...its just <br/>
loses something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593703838">Keith and I really liked Death to Smoochy.  It is disturbing, but in a <br/>
satisfying kind of way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I bought a cheap used video of Good Will Hunting today.  There&#39;s a Robin <br/>
Williams movie with some foul language.   That would be kind of a hoot all edited <br/>
out, I think.   More beeps than words.<br/>

mouth is either dubbed or beeped.<br/>
