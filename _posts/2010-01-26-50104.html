<br/>
Susan May wanted to talk about vaccinations, and I recommended the  <br/>
FamilyRUNning site, so I&#39;d also like to get her some traffic over there.<br/>
<br/>
If there are people here who are unaware of that site, it can be the  <br/>
perfect place for thing that aren&#39;t ideal for this list--about custody  <br/>
or TV or documentaries that go bump in the night.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the main page:<br/>

<br/>
and here&#39;s my page:<br/>
