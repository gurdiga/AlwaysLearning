I finally paid attention to this ad this morning.  After she looks at the report card, the mom and her son exchange glances of love and approval.  And the tragic thing is the implication that as long as the mom was seeing &quot;bad&quot; grades she was unable to love and approve of her son in the same way.<br/>

(Yes, I may be reading to much into this short scripted slice of fake life, but I thought you all would agree.)<br/>

blessingway before I went on my hike to the Appalachian Trail.  The masseuse <br/>
was telling me that she had homeschooled her son last year.  Before that he <br/>
was in school and was getting F&#39;s.  She said when she talked with people at his <br/>
school they were so concerned with the grades, and didn&#39;t listen to her when <br/>
she stated that her goal was to have her child grow up to be a decent human <br/>
being.  Anyway, after one year at home (using materials thro the school system), <br/>
the child elected to go back to school for his high school years and is now <br/>
making A&#39;s.  Like the mom said, she doesn&#39;t care about the grades, but it makes <br/>
school easier for her son to get better ones.  She was sad that he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to stay at home.<br/>

I&#39;m new to the group.  I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks ... reading, enjoying and learning from your posts.  I have a question that perhaps you can help me with.  My son, who is 7, insists on stating what &quot;grade&quot; he is in.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s largely because most of our friends are schooled.  I tried to explain that we really don&#39;t have grades, just as we don&#39;t have school days, and non-school days.  It&#39;s hard to make a 7 year old understand that his parents find value in everything he does, and we consider it all learning.  Should I even try to stop the grade labeling, or just let him go with whatever makes him comfortable?  I have the feeling it&#39;s more my discomfort with looking or sounding schoolish more than anything else.  I&#39;d love to hear anyone else&#39;s input/experience.<br/>

Tamzin usually just says ___ grade (whatever fits for her age at the time &lt;g&gt;) when someone asks her. She realized long ago that it was often an adults way of figuring out her age. If it&#39;s another homeschooler, she will say, &quot;I&#39;m not in a grade, we unschool. I&#39;m ___ years old&quot;. Often it is easier for kids to give the &#39;expected&#39; answer rather than going into a whole homeschooling/unschooling discussion.<br/>

OH!!! I just remembered something I had forgotten.  When the kids  <br/>
were really little we went by ages for grades, so at five someone  <br/>
could start saying &quot;kindergarten&quot; and six meant &quot;first grade&quot; but it  <br/>
was kind of a goof.  It helped make the point that our &quot;school years&quot;  <br/>
weren&#39;t really based on school&#39;s count at all, and that none of it  <br/>
was real or pressing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263452488">yeah, i agree, i&#39;d make it a non issue.  Which it is... <br/>
<br/>
Alexx and I went to LBCC to register her again--guess if you are 13, you have to reapply each semester, and also have an interview each semester.  It&#39;s a bit annoying, but the classes are free.  Anyway, technically, Alexx would be going into 8th grade.  However, I&#39;ve skipped her ahead.  Now, we just put her back into 8th grade.  why?  because if she &quot;graduates&quot; she can&#39;t take college classes for free any more.  So, it seemed, for the purposes of college, that she be back in 8th grade.  Gives her more semesters at college for the free price. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, i would let him be whatever grade he wants.  Janene, when she was 6, told everyone she was in the 6th grade.  I never corrected her..., it was kinda cute.<br/>

For some reason 2nd grade is a big deal to her and it seems to hold some mystery or difficulty.  I think it comes from the Jumpstart computer games.  It took her awhile to master 1st grade and she seems to be worried about how difficult Jumpstart 2nd grade will be.<br/>

Lately, she has been playing Nintendogs quite a bit.  Maybe this year she&#39;ll say she is in grade &quot;Chihuahua and Friends&quot; or grade &quot;Dalmatian and Friends&quot;<br/>

I think asking kids what grade they are in is an easy way for adults to figure out how old a child is and maybe gives them an opening for conversation.<br/>

It is impossible for Megan not to talk to people.  She tells anyone who will listen her name, her sister&#39;s name, that we&#39;ve recently moved to Oregon, that I sunburn easily, that she loves dim sum, and what pets we have.  Her enthusiasm for everything can be overwhelming for some people.  She&#39;s awesome.

-=- I had the pleasure<br/>
of having to start researching legal stuff.   My daughter received a  <br/>
summons<br/>
first thing this morning.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Summons to a hearing?  To speak to a judge?  What?<br/>
How old is she?<br/>
<br/>
Is it your dad or her paternal grandfather?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503734689">hi robin, <br/>
 my friend here had this happen to her as well, the father (not<br/>
husband) refused to acknowlege the baby, but after 7 years (must be a<br/>
magical number) he sued for visitation rights etc...<br/>
<br/>
He lost the case.<br/>
The judge thought that he was being absurd...considering the<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
i realize this is italy, so things are not exactly the same as in US--<br/>
I hope things work out for you all.<br/>

As for our learn nothing day: I drove Connor to Seattle and we picked <br/>
up a couple I found on Craig&#39;s List to share the ride.  I had spoken <br/>
with the man and knew his name but not the woman&#39;s.  When picking <br/>
them up I said &quot;I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s the &#39;first annual&#39; Learn Nothing Day <br/>
so I won&#39;t ask for your name&quot;.  The learning nothing pretty much went <br/>
downhill from there ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  He&#39;s fine. Been having some long term stomach problems so it was time to go in and see what was going on. Also look biopsies on his esophagitis and for celiac disease. <br/>
   <br/>
  He is severaly autistic and nonverbal though and was quite pissed when he woke up from surgery and realised he was still there. The hospital has their standard protocol of getting them woken up, making sure they can hold down some liquid, blah blah. Its all understandable for most kids. My son would have just gotten more and more upset trying to make me understand that he wanted to go , would have probably made himself throw up. Once he saw that we were going he calmed right down . <br/>
