Now if they would just take the kitty litter back out,<br/>
maybe on the way down....<br/>
<br/>
Do they actually choose good veggies and other fresh<br/>
stuff? and expiration dates?<br/>

Yes, I was concerned about this as well at first.  But they (&quot;Marsh&quot; is our<br/>
local delivery grocery store) have never brought me any bad veggies or meats<br/>
and the expirations dates are in line with what I would choose normailly..<br/>
I can also select &quot;no substitutions&quot;on any item I order.  I rarely do this<br/>
because if they don&#39;t have something I ordered they usually do a great job<br/>
substituting it with a similar brand or larger size.<br/>
One of the coolest parts is that when I log onto their website www.Marsh.net<br/>
I can use my &quot;quick shopper list&quot; which is a running list of all items I<br/>
have ever ordered from them or I can search the database or browse the<br/>
store.<br/>
<br/>
If/when we move from the city I will miss this the most.<br/>
But  I can also choose to order online then pick-up my own groceries at a<br/>
specified time and store location for about $4.  This works well for people<br/>
who work in the city but don&#39;t live in the delivery area.  So this may be an<br/>
option if we move to the country, hubby could pick up on his way home but<br/>
still not have to shop at the store.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve rambled on again!  But I really hate to goto the store!<br/>

<br/>
They mostly choose not bad stuff, and if there&#39;s any problem they will <br/>
redeliver or credit you. It&#39;s not perfect, but particularly for heavy stuff <br/>
or a big shopping, it&#39;s VERY nice not having to wander the aisles or carry it <br/>
up.<br/>
