<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485988253">Hi Shyrley,<br/>
Sorry to hear about your daughter&#39;s arm, summer is extra lousy for a <br/>
break!  I&#39;m glad you enjoyed your visit to my area (recently the <br/>
Finger Lakes, now near Rochester and have been to the falls many <br/>
times).  I&#39;d recommend trying to come back when the leaves are <br/>
changed, it&#39;s absolutely beautiful then!!<br/>
