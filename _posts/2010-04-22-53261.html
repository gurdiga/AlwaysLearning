&gt; -=-When something comes to me as an issue I have found myself<br/>
&gt; formulating it as a question for this list and then imagining what the<br/>
&gt; answers might be. What I have only now realised is that this is<br/>
&gt; indicative of how extraordinarily difficult I have found it to think<br/>
&gt; for myself. I am so used to being spoonfed the &quot;right answer&quot; that<br/>
&gt; even now, in my forties, I sort of wait for someone to tell me what to<br/>
&gt; do. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re describing is unusual at all, though.<br/>
&gt; People have voices in their heads, and they have the images of people<br/>
&gt; whose approval would make them feel better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Knowing I&#39;m in control of those voices (I found volume!) and that I am the<br/>
one who can shape the things said to me *inside my OWN head* are very<br/>
important day-to-day tools.  You can fire the voices you no longer agree<br/>
with. Crazy but TRUE ;)<br/>
<br/>
I used to &quot;bring in&quot; Sandra to virtually sit in the corner of the room while<br/>
I played with my kids. She would *in my head* watch and approve of the<br/>
interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Once I heard her voice IRL and listened to Parenting Peacefully about 857<br/>
times, she moved from the corner of the room to the head of the choir!<br/>
Slowly, slowly through the years, I&#39;ve collected the voices of the moms I<br/>
want most to be like (and lucky us, there are lots of &#39;em here!) and allowed<br/>
them to speak to me in ways I&#39;d never heard before!  While waiting for that<br/>
next, better option (a PP tool), I&#39;ll poll my mental-mamas for suggestions.<br/>
(hmmm, I&#39;ve not used this lately, perhaps this is a reminder to me more than<br/>
any of the general you ;))<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have TONS of people in my head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dad&#39;s voice *in my head* was incredibly critical, though he&#39;d not spoken<br/>
that way (to me or anyone else) in over 25 years. I&#39;ve incorporated a lot of<br/>
New Dad-isms, while finding humor (instead of shame or pain) in the Old<br/>
Dad-isms.  i.e. He used to say, &quot;If you had any brains, you&#39;d take &#39;em out<br/>
and play with &#39;em!&quot; Part of me remembers the insult, while there&#39;s a part of<br/>
me that remembers how I would internally smile and think, &quot;At least I&#39;d have<br/>
something to PLAY with!&quot; Today, my dad would laugh at my thought, he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have then. Imagining us laughing together is a better thought to<br/>
carry than the insult. As an unschooling mommy, I can&#39;t imagine the pain<br/>
little-boy-Ed felt about having things said to him. I know Papa Ed<br/>
appreciates seeing it not happen to his grandson.  So changing those old<br/>
voices, improves the now relations.  And no one outside your mind need know<br/>
how it was done! :D<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have Holly in my head when I want to buy something that I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really need. Darn that Holly.<br/>
&gt; __<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My most favorite Holly-ism:<br/>
&quot;Does that need to be heard?&quot;<br/>
I didn&#39;t imagine this could be said in a non-snarky way - IT CAN!  With a<br/>
genuine concern to make life better, it can, it was.<br/>
In that gap between getting riled up and taking that deep breath to begin to<br/>
spew, in comes Holly&#39;s voice & I&#39;m deflated like a balloon. I step back and<br/>
examine what I&#39;m about to say; I can still say it in 38 seconds if it&#39;s<br/>
deemed worthy of being heard.  78.53% of the time (scientifically) the<br/>
thought doesn&#39;t need to leave me; the rest of the time, the editing option<br/>
should still be used ;)<br/>
