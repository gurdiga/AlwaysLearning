<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084160707">I don&#39;t mean to flood this group with posts, but I HAD to share this.  I run an organic home daycare and have a 21 month boy here today who was playing with the dot markers (they are like bingo markers).  On his own he took the caps and put them on the corresponding markers while looking at me trying to say the name of each color.  The look on his face when I encouraged him and acknowledged the great job he did was priceless.  He did this activity over and over again and now is off doing something else.  Obviously I took the markers out for him to color with, but he used them a different way to teach himself about colors.  It was pretty cool to realize and see the power unschooling in action!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

<br/>
I LOVE our pattern blocks.  They&#39;re flat, stained wood &quot;attribute  <br/>
block,&quot; and for me, the &quot;right way&quot; to use them is to make patterns  <br/>
radiating out from a central point.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s &quot;right way&quot; was to make stacked designs, little sculptures.    <br/>
Since then I&#39;ve used them that way too, but I tend to make artsy  <br/>
fences, so they&#39;re rows standing up instead or row lying flat.  But  <br/>
Marty&#39;s weren&#39;t on a plane that way.  He was using them like blocks,  <br/>
WHICH THEY ARE!  But I saw them as flat shapes meant to be laid flat.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe (I&#39;m not sure) it&#39;s because of school, and getting in trouble if  <br/>
I didn&#39;t use things the way they were supposed to be used.  My mom was  <br/>
that way too, when I was little.  When she was older and all the kids  <br/>
were gone she started being pretty good at using things &quot;the wrong  <br/>
way&quot;--more creative ways.   Maybe (I&#39;m not sure) she thought part of  <br/>
being a mom was training kids to use things &quot;right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty used bungie cords in the back of his jeep to keep the back  <br/>
window plastic safe from other things back there.  It&#39;s not &quot;what  <br/>
bungie cords are for,&quot; but I&#39;ve used bungie cords in the house and in  <br/>
the yard for ALL kinds of things his whole life, and so from his point  <br/>
of view, they&#39;re to be used however the heck one wants to!  So in that  <br/>
way I think I&#39;ve moved away from my upbringing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For the person who wanted to know the differeneces between Montessori <br/>
and unschooling - there&#39;s one for you. In Montessori schools, equipment <br/>
is specialized and designed to be worked with in one specific way. The <br/>
kids get a formal lesson on how to use it, before they are allowed to <br/>
work with it.<br/>
<br/>
And, notice I didn&#39;t use the word &quot;play&quot; in my description. They call <br/>
what the children do &quot;work&quot; - intended to remind the adults around them <br/>
that it is important and should be respected, but still it has a grim <br/>
sense to it.<br/>
<br/>
I love those dot markers. My mom used to make paint rollers using old <br/>
roll-on deodorant containers, for her preschool. Those were really fun, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie just asked me to buy pattern blocks. Ours were lost in a fire in <br/>
our house 3 years ago and I didn&#39;t replace them.A few days ago, she was <br/>
trying to find crayons and we didn&#39;t have any. I was thinking that the <br/>
other things that were lost and I didn&#39;t replace were what you might <br/>
call the &quot;preschool art supplies.&quot; We had a lot of it - colored tape, <br/>
ALL kinds of paper, glue of various kinds, lots and lots of doo-dads for <br/>
collaging, paintbrushes, different kinds of crayons and markers and <br/>
colored pencils, paints of various kinds. Boxes of buttons and dried <br/>
flowers and beans and rubber stamps and stencils.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Rosie is 18 and missing the accumulation of all that stuff. I&#39;m <br/>
going to buy her a big box of crayons today. And I&#39;ll order pattern <br/>
blocks. And I&#39;ll start accumulating all the cool preschool art supplies <br/>
again, to have available a good supply for the future grandchildren - <br/>
since I plan to someday be the grandma with the most fun house in the <br/>
world. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Rosie was 4 or so and Roya was 10, thinking it was cool <br/>
that Roya still had an excuse to play with the &quot;little kid&quot; stuff and <br/>
have so much fun with it, because of having littler sisters. Rosie <br/>
doesn&#39;t have any little sisters, but she has no need of an excuse to <br/>
play with whatever she feels like playing with. She&#39;s a very mature 18 <br/>
year old college student with a responsible job and a boyfriend. She <br/>
wants some crayons and pattern blocks.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE the way unschooled kids are growing up with such a childlike <br/>
playful enjoyment of things that other kids their ages would not even <br/>
remotely be caught dead showing an interest in.<br/>
<br/>
I see it in all the unschooled young adults I know - not necessarily a <br/>
love for preschool art supplies &lt;G&gt;, but that childlike sweetness that <br/>
has survived within them.<br/>
<br/>
Really, THAT is why we unschooled. Looking back I can see that that was <br/>
it - call it &quot;love of learning&quot; but that doesn&#39;t really get to the core <br/>
of it. It is more that an inner core of what it means to be human, a <br/>
love of LIFE, has been allowed to blossom instead of being destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
And - whew - that was a lot to say about dot markers, huh? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Being in daycare will never be like unschooling, but it can be better or <br/>
worse. It can crush that inner child-spirit in no time. So, I&#39;m happy to <br/>
hear about it when a daycare provider is more enlightened.<br/>

<br/>
Same with Holly.  She&#39;s been doing a lot of Shrinky Dink art and  <br/>
giving it to her friends.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has two jobs, a boyfriend who turns 25 next week, and she was  <br/>
listening to &quot;Rainbow Brite&quot; and &quot;Zoobilee Zoo&quot; themesongs yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Those associated with schools and traditional parenting could look at  <br/>
Holly or Rosie and say &quot;immature,&quot; but they would be as wrong as any  <br/>
wrong could be.<br/>
<br/>
People who &quot;decide&quot; what they like by doing what will not be made fun  <br/>
of by others aren&#39;t deciding much at all.  They&#39;re deciding to let the  <br/>
crowd make their decisions for them.   That&#39;s not a mark of self  <br/>
knowledge or maturity.  It&#39;s some kind of slide-through-life-without- <br/>
living-it move.<br/>

<br/>
I am aware that daycare is like school, it is an outside learning environment.  Fortunately from the help of this group I am becoming an &quot;enlightened daycare provider&quot; and can work on providing an unschooling environment.  I now understand that I don&#39;t need to have a set curriculum to teach the children in my care.  Today&#39;s example with the dot markers showed me that.  A lot of the personal work I am doing is around being aware of and recognizing these wonderful moments.  I need to work hard on letting go of structure and preconceived ideas of how children should learn.  I am realizing that unschooling is a lifestyle that I need to practice in every aspect of my life which includes my daycare business.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Things I&#39;ve learned from the years in La Leche League and unschooling  <br/>
have changed the way I see everything, but it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; everwhere and all the time.  It means that I see the  <br/>
world differently, and that&#39;s been good!   But nothing will make  <br/>
daycare the very same thing as unschooling at home with one&#39;s own  <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to discourage you from changing the way you are with kids  <br/>
in your care, if you want to.  That sounds great!<br/>
What I want to discourage is the idea that creating an alternative  <br/>
learning environment in a daycare situation is identical to  <br/>
unschooling one&#39;s own children at home.<br/>

<br/>
I believe playing and being happy is enough, unfortunately the powers that be (the Department of Early Education and Care which is the state agency that licenses me) does not.  There are regulations that require curriculum and it is only getting worse.  New regulations and a Quality Rating Scale are in the pipeline that will require licensed providers to be much more regimented and structured.   If you are not licensed it is illegal to run a daycare in MA so I have to follow the rules.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 I don&#39;t think this would ever be possible since the children I am caring for are not my own children and this is not their home, therefore it is going to be a different experience for them.  I am simply stating that I see how I interact with the children and the environment I create differently since I am trying to live an unschooling lifestyle.  Since I run a business out of my home and my own children are going to be here at the same time as the daycare children the two are going to overlap, but the experience with my own children and those of the daycare children will naturally be different.   I realize my daycare is an alternative learning environment and therefore can never truly be an unschooling experience.  I expect that both my own children and the daycare children will benefit in different ways from my approach.<br/>

I came to unschooling through the early childhood education route - <br/>
through learning about developmentally appropriate curriculum and the <br/>
value of delayed reading instruction. I feel like I took all that stuff <br/>
to its logical conclusion - unschooling.  I&#39;m always happy to hear about <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172716291">I purchased this book years ago (Better Late than Early) and it tremendously helped (until we changed direction, that is).  We didn&#39;t do formal phonics and reading with my two oldest, and they are both avid readers and self-learners.  We started out learning naturally, in everyday life.  (I guess we all do that when the children are very little, and then, with some, all of a sudden they hit school-age, and they stop.)  Great read.  I didn&#39;t really connect it with unschooling, though, as it does seem to recommend more structure and routine.  Still a good read, though.  Jimi Ann<br/>
