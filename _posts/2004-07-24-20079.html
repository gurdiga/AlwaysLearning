<div id="ygrps-yiv-414020031">I have read this discussion about TCS etc. with a great deal of interest not<br/>
because I really want to know what TCS says (although that is interesting<br/>
too). I am very interested to hear about/from people who belong to a lot of<br/>
groups or espouse many different philosophies or theories in contrast with<br/>
those people who just live life in the way they want/see fit, without any<br/>
particular books or theories leading them.  We are all on an unschooling<br/>
discussion list so clearly we have all sought out this &quot;community,&quot; many of<br/>
us have had past experience with La Leche League, in fact an extraordinary<br/>
number of us are or were Leaders, there are people on this list who often<br/>
talk about their SCA participation or sports or a religious institution--we<br/>
are already living our lives outside the &quot;norm&quot; in our country by<br/>
unschooling.  I find it absolutely fascinating to learn about how others<br/>
create identities for themselves and their families and find ways to<br/>
&quot;belong&quot; while living this &quot;outside the box&quot; life.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the point of my email is to ask people to think about, or write to<br/>
the list about what kind of affiliations they find helpful in their lives.<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard of most of the organizations mentioned on this list.  I was<br/>
a LLL Leader so I know about things along that route.  I guess our family<br/>
doesn&#39;t really affiliate ourselves with any particular philosophy, we don&#39;t<br/>
even call ourselves &quot;unschoolers.&quot;  That may change, at this point we are a<br/>
family of three (2 adults and a 4 year old) who like each other and have way<br/>
more fun together than other families we know.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a bumper sticker I liked today it said &quot;You may all be laughing at ME<br/>
because I&#39;m different, but I am laughing at YOU because you are all the<br/>
same.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts,<br/>

<br/>
Our (dh & I) two main communities are our church (UU)<br/>
and our homeschool group.  I&#39;m very involved in both. <br/>
  My dh works at home and has an on-line work<br/>
community but nothing in real life for the most part. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I only went to one LLL meeting before my son (now 8)<br/>
was born & I didn&#39;t enjoy it so I never went back.  I<br/>
was a member of a local Moms Club for awhile, but I<br/>
thought the monthly meetings were boring and dropped<br/>
it finally.  But I did meet a couple of great friends<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I&#39;m in a small babysitting co-op.  Started by<br/>
a friend at my church, so there is lots of overlap.<br/>
<br/>
My dh & I started dancing last year, so we now also<br/>
&quot;belong&quot; to the West Coast Swing dancing community :)<br/>

=======================================================<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve have no affiliations with any groups and I am perfectly fine with that.<br/>
I&#39;ve finally gotten to a point in my life that I am happy just being me and<br/>
I don&#39;t feel any need to belong to any group unless that group is serving a<br/>
purpose for me at that time. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to join a group if it were<br/>
going to help me out or if I wanted to help them out, but I don&#39;t feel a<br/>
need to define myself by who I am affiliated with. I felt a strong<br/>
affiliation with the word *unschooler* for several years but now it doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter to me either way.  For those several years that I felt very connected<br/>
to that identity I wanted to shout from the roof tops all that I had<br/>
discovered.  I&#39;ve pretty much figured out that most people either don&#39;t feel<br/>
like they have a choice or don&#39;t think they can do it.  I&#39;ve settled into<br/>
enjoying our easy laid back life and I&#39;ve stopped feeling the need to share<br/>
it with others unless I know they are genuinely interested and feel it&#39;s a<br/>
possibility for them.  I am comfortable just being me, not affiliated with<br/>
anyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157635504">Some years back, early 80&#39;s I think, I read an article that discussed <br/>
identification and belonging in the changing world, and it said that people will <br/>
identify with another person over common preference, like a favorite drink or <br/>
candy bar.<br/>
<br/>
At the time I thought that too extreme, or maybe just coming out of applied <br/>
psychology research for advertising.  But since then I&#39;ve seen something <br/>
similar happening, and it makes sense after all to me.<br/>
<br/>
It happens with hair, and automobiles, favorite TV shows, &quot;fandom&quot; of various <br/>
sorts (anime, science fiction, particular movies or characters like <br/>
Highlander, Beauty and the Beast TV series), and now lately with websites and video <br/>
games.   <br/>
<br/>
There are people who play Halo and who get all the jokes on Red vs. Blue.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who can converse in the manner of Sinfest (we got Kirby a <br/>
Sinfest t-shirt years back, with a martial arts theme, and he told some stories <br/>
of who would recognize it and what they would say).  There are homestarrunner <br/>
fans.<br/>
<br/>
It gives people something in common.<br/>
<br/>
Where they live isn&#39;t as &quot;in common&quot; as what they like, or how they live, or <br/>
what they support or concentrate on.<br/>
<br/>
Our next door neighbors don&#39;t take good care of their dog.  They&#39;re not &quot;dog <br/>
people.&quot;  But their kid does softball or little league or whatever and their <br/>
team won some district thing so their car was painted up and their visitors <br/>
praise and congratulate him heartily.  So one other family in our cul-de-sac <br/>
identifies with that aspect of their lives, because they are &quot;sports people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big topic.  The possibility for it affecting how people make decisions <br/>
from where they live, to decorating their houses, to what car to own, to how <br/>
their kids find mates is that many other topics, maybe.<br/>

<br/>
I think sometimes there&#39;s an infatuation period with new things, and that can <br/>
be really good for the cause, or the group.  It&#39;s kind of like being in love, <br/>
biochemically and emotionally (if those can be separated, and if they can&#39;t <br/>
I&#39;m being redundant).   I was really dedicated to helping people breastfeed for <br/>
years, and now I&#39;m not.  It came up a a week ago at a party, and someone <br/>
said, &quot;Oh, are you a possible resource for new moms?  My daughter in law is about <br/>
to have a baby.&quot;  I was seriously hesitant, even though the woman was a friend <br/>
of mine.  I said yes in the most almost-no way I can remember having said it. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  And another friend just had a baby this week.  Two days before <br/>
(induction, about which I was grumping when he told me), I was talking to him about <br/>
circumcision and birth issues and they were all new thoughts for him, so I didn&#39;t <br/>
even bother to ask if the mom was planning to breastfeed.  I decided not <br/>
caring was easier than caring.   I&#39;m not in love with that anymore, with my <br/>
youngest being 12.<br/>
<br/>
But some people make a more long-term relationship with the thing they&#39;re <br/>
involved in (church, LLL, environmentalism, whatever) and that&#39;s fine.  They&#39;re <br/>
probably all experienced with the waves of newcomers who have two or three <br/>
years of real fervor in them and then it fades.  I think both are normal and <br/>
natural.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No missionary like a convert,&quot; they say.<br/>

************************************************************************<br/>
I have been thinking about the &quot;identity&quot; question and enjoying the responses.  Maybe it&#39;s the theme of the week for me because I just finished<br/>
reading an anthropological study on marriage and community yesterday too.<br/>
I realized even three year olds bond over common preferences.  They will do<br/>
it over underwear.  &quot;Look I have Power Rangers too!&quot;  It opens up a conversation.  I had an experience last week of having a blind date with a mom and her kids at a local park.  We had conversed through a yahoo group and we had unschooling as a commonality.  They stopped by after the park because I wanted to share some of the fish we caught in Alaska.  While<br/>
she was in the kitchen she saw a picture I had and asked a question and we <br/>
both realized we had something very personal in common.  I feel very linked<br/>
to her because of the common preference.  We also had a great playdate.  <br/>
I realized in the last month or so none of my friends were AP or unschooling.  We get together for playdates regularly but I realized it would be in my families best interest if I broaden our horizons and try to make some connections within our local community with others of &quot;like mind.&quot;  I have never really thought of myself as a &quot;group&quot; person although I was involved in the 12 step community for some time.  We are not involved with a church and have very few family members.  I never clicked with the Mom&#39;s club in our area and the friends we have now we met in Kindermusik a couple of years ago.  So, thanks to the internet and yahoo groups we have recently joined both unschooling, homeschooling the gifted, and attachment parenting groups to find local get togethers.  I am really not a social creature but I feel it is one of those consensual things I need to do for Alex&#39;s needs as well as my own.  It is quite humbling to my ego to admit I want to &quot;belong&quot; somewhere.  That&#39;s where I am at the moment.  Grateful that there is commonality in our large county and grateful to connect.<br/>

 <br/>
================================================================<br/>
Is it?  It says something about me, but it doesn&#39;t really affiliate me with<br/>
a particular group of people. <br/>
 <br/>
================================================================== <br/>
<br/>
What about screennames?   Lots of people on the unschooling lists have <br/>
screennames about parenting or their children or homeschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
=========================================================================<br/>
I guess I see screen names differently than identifying myself with a group.<br/>
(church, LLL, homeschool group, knitting group, book club, etc.) I think<br/>
screen names can identify something about you  (that I love games) without<br/>
affiliating you with a group. <br/>
 <br/>
We recently got a new email server and I had to come up with a new email<br/>
name. It was such a hard decision. (life&#39;s hard when you hardest decision is<br/>
your email address.  LOL!)  Over the last 4 plus years my email has been<br/>
unschooling@------.  And I kept the unschooling part even when we changed<br/>
providers.  This last change I decided to step away from identifying myself<br/>
to the world as &quot;unschooling&quot;. Sometimes there are times when I want to be<br/>
more discreet about who I am and what we do. (or don&#39;t do)  Everyone I know,<br/>
it seems, comes up with such cute, creative email addresses.  I drew a total<br/>
blank at first.  We were on a roll of playing Who-ville Opoly at the time<br/>
and I almost picked Grinched or Whobilation.  I ended up picking something<br/>
more broad but on the same topic.  We just love games at our house and I did<br/>
want my email to say *something* about me while at the same time not causing<br/>
too much controversy in any circle.  It doesn&#39;t however, affiliate me with a<br/>
group of people.  I am sure there are other people who love games, but I am<br/>
not part of a group with that as their focus.  I don&#39;t really care if anyone<br/>
else loves games or not.  (except my family or I&#39;d have no one to play<br/>
with.) <br/>
 <br/>
When someone asks how we homeschool I definitely say I&#39;m an unschooler.<br/>
There are words that I identify with....unschooler, attachment parent, etc,<br/>
but I am not affiliated with any groups that have these things as their<br/>
focus. <br/>
  <br/>

That&#39;s true, but so not me.  I tend to get into something and be really<br/>
enthusiastic for a while. Then I move on to something else.  Although,<br/>
loving games has never changed and I can&#39;t begin to imagine that wanting to<br/>
unschool my kids would ever change.  But my enthusiasm for sharing it has<br/>
definitely changed.  I don&#39;t want to change the world so much as I want to<br/>
live happily in my own little world.  Sounds selfish, doesn&#39;t it?  Although<br/>
if someone were actually interested, I&#39;d happily share what works for us.<br/>
 <br/>
People are definitely brought together by the things they share in common.<br/>
I&#39;m glad we have ways to identify (label) ourselves so we can find like<br/>
minded people to hang out with.  I can&#39;t even imagine not having unschooling<br/>
support via the net.<br/>

Right. I think my best virtual friend HAS to be Deb Lewis, hands down.  Among <br/>
other things, we&#39;re both HUGE Sandra Dodd fans; we&#39;ll both stay up late to  <br/>

Maybe Gardner needs to think about another intelligence, about wanting to <br/>

about attachment parenting and unschooling. I have been fortunate to <br/>
have several women friends with both of these same common <br/>
preferences. We have been able to support each other on the phone, <br/>
mostly. However, as our children have grown, it has become increasing <br/>
more difficult to coordinate our families&#39; schedules and play <br/>
preferences: some like physical outdoor play at parks more than <br/>
others, some don&#39;t like the heat, visiting with a third or fourth <br/>
child is more difficult due to the &quot;luggage&quot; just to go anywhere for <br/>
several hours, etc. So, we are able to see each of the families about <br/>
once a week or so. <br/>
<br/>
My son is an only child, 3y/o. He loves to have children around. He <br/>
would like lots of children to play with every day for long periods. <br/>
So we go to the park and the pool. But here children are yelled at, <br/>
scolded, directed, restricted, given time-outs, grabbed, ignored, <br/>
etc. You know, conventional parenting. Nothing &quot;abusive&quot; just the <br/>
authoritarian attitude of &quot;do it my way, or else&quot;. I have actually <br/>
heard a mother tell a child &quot;stop right now, or else you won&#39;t get <br/>
dinner, I am that serious&quot;. Apparently, the child wanted to play with <br/>
something and wasn&#39;t even allowed to explore it, not breakable, just <br/>
noisy.<br/>
<br/>
So we tried organized activities: Music Together, gym classes at the <br/>
YMCA. Same thing, parents not treating the children with respect. Not <br/>
listened to. Not given a chance to voice their point of view. Told to <br/>
just stop. Stop having an opinion. Do it my way, now.<br/>
<br/>
So we tried the La Leche park date. Same thing. Attachment parented <br/>
babies, but as soon as they are toddling around a bit, the children <br/>
are discussed in front of them as: &quot;misbehaving&quot;, &quot;talking <br/>
back&quot;, &quot;disobiedient&quot;, &quot;belligerent&quot;, told &quot;don&#39;t talk to me with <br/>
that tone&quot;, &quot;won&#39;t clean up their room&quot;, &quot;won&#39;t help with their <br/>
younger siblings&quot;, &quot;immature, old enough to know better&quot;, &quot;being <br/>
stubborn, I told you to do it&quot;, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Then the children are &quot;goin to be in trouble&quot;, &quot;going to have to <br/>
leave, if they don&#39;t mind&quot;, told &quot;listen, I told you, do xyz&quot;, &quot;not <br/>
going to be able to play later&quot;, &quot;won&#39;t get to watch videos&quot;, etc. <br/>
<br/>
So, how do I meet my child&#39;s desire to have playmates and his need to <br/>
learn by watching others, when the environment and atmosphere with <br/>
some parents is domineering to the children? How do I create social <br/>
opportunites for him to learn about life when the environment is so <br/>
full of judgement, threats and intimidation? I know that these women <br/>
all mean well. They love their children dearly. They don&#39;t agree that <br/>
the pattern of coercion interferes with the child learning to love <br/>
life. And I really don&#39;t want my son to learn that the coercion that <br/>
is being modelled is a way to interact with people, especially <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
How have you all handled similar situations over the years?<br/>

both unschooling, homeschooling the gifted, and attachment parenting <br/>

moment.  Grateful that there is commonality in our large county and <br/>
grateful to connect.<br/>

So we tried the La Leche park date. Same thing. Attachment parented <br/>
babies, but as soon as they are toddling around a bit, the children <br/>
are discussed in front of them as: &quot;misbehaving&quot;, &quot;talking <br/>

stubborn, I told you to do it&quot;, etc. **<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I didn&#39;t have this experience with the LLL park days that I attended.  In fact I still have two great friends who are wonderful examples for me of how to parent sweetly and calmly.  (I don&#39;t think they were *always* calm;  they are human!  But sometimes having a witness can help you stay teetering on the brink of reasonableness and not totally lose it.  So it was mutually beneficial for us to hang out and &quot;parent&quot; together.)   I still see these friends for playdates, and our kids are now 10.  (Sadly, we don&#39;t live in the same cities any more, but we do live in the same region.)<br/>
<br/>
I was not particularly good as a parent in the 1-3 year age range.  I think it was a help for me to have attachment parenting friends to set an example for me.  Maybe in this group, you will have to BE the example, the &quot;exemplary&quot; parent?<br/>
<br/>
Nursing my kid was my best tool for calming upsetting situations at that age.  Maybe if people in some areas feel more pressure to wean early they are going to fall back more on &quot;traditional&quot; parenting techniques?<br/>
<br/>
Can you hang in a little longer and see if you can spot the most patient moms in the bunch.  Then maybe cut them out of the herd and have one on one playdates with them?   Your parenting style can influence their&#39;s and maybe it will spread to the wider group.  <br/>
<br/>
It also occurs to me that (overall) parents who are on their second or third kid have more sense about what behavior to expect at what ages.  You *might* find some older and wiser mamas with trailing 3 year olds that would be pleasanter to be around.  (Sorry for the &quot;ageism&quot; but the parenting approached quoted above sound kind of ignorant to me.)   (Oh, if you are looking for more &quot;literate&quot; parents who are parenting &quot;by the book&quot; but using the newer books &lt;g&gt;, you might try story time at a bookstore or library, or hang out at parks in yuppie neighborhoods.)<br/>
<br/>
I personally hate the word &quot;disobedient&quot;.   I like &quot;cooperation&quot;, but my goal is never to extract &quot;obedience&quot; from the people around me.  You have my sympathy for having to be around people who are &quot;obedience training&quot; their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I live in the leftist CA Bay Area.  Mostly we hate authoritarianism, so authoritarian parenting isn&#39;t widespread here.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
They don&#39;t agree that <br/>
the pattern of coercion interferes with the child learning to love **<br/>
<br/>
PPS   I am the least coercive parent of everyone that I know well.   And I don&#39;t agree that a tiny bit of coercion, like &quot;c&#39;mon get your shoes on&quot; or &quot;please come with me to the store I want an orange now&quot; are going to interfere with a child&#39;s love of learning or even his love of me.  So maybe I don&#39;t fit with the philosophy you are looking for.  BUT, I don&#39;t use any of the icky parenting techniques that you quoted above as negative examples.</div>

find the shoes&quot;, or something like that.  A reminder isn&#39;t necessarily coercion.<br/>

<br/>
In our home lives a very distracted person, so saying to him, &quot;Put your shoes on before you get in the car&quot; is necessary. We&#39;ve been halfway to our destination to find that he has no shoes on, no coat on in the middle of our midwestern winter, is still in his pajamas, forgets his choir music, whatever. One time, when we were halfway to Chicago for a week&#39;s visit, I turned back to see that he was wearing...garden clogs! This was his only pair of shoes for the week. <br/>
<br/>
I think that what some families would consider coercion is simply necessary for other families. Every child and every family is different. For me, helping my memory-challenged son to remember his shoes is a help that he needs and appreciates, if I do it with the right heart. This same reminder is not necessary for my other children. <br/>

<br/>
Yeah.  This came from an example in my post where I said that I&#39;m less coercive than nearly everybody, but sometimes I still say &quot;put on your shoes and come with me.&quot;   (That&#39;s not necessarily how I start the conversation, but I have ended it that way.  My son is 10 and in my opinion not ready to be left at home alone, even for 20 minutes.)<br/>

I don&#39;t personally believe that this is harmful.   We do lots to make our son&#39;s life sweet and rewarding and interesting.  But I don&#39;t believe I can find common preferences 100% of the time and I&#39;m not shooting for that as my goal.<br/>

It gets pretty confusing, but pretty much no one thinks I&#39;m too thin or too conservative. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone watching the convention?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a kid watching, without coercing them to do so?<br/>
<br/>
I can remember watching the &#39;72 convention at a friend&#39;s house when I was only 13.  I thought McGovern gave a great speech, so I&#39;m a terrible barometer of American public sentiment.<br/>

regard to the enrichment activities over all though.  Although, as my previous share mentioned the kids are getting to an age<br/>
in which they are going to be in school full time and I suspect changes as well as time restrictions will develop.  I did choose<br/>
quite consciously who I wanted to pursue friendships with and playdates with by the behavior of the children and the parents behavior.  I am fortunate the La Leche in my area was full of AP mom&#39;s.  I went to my first Attachment Parenting get together <br/>
tonight.  Mark came with too.  I had such a wonderful time.  Much better time than I have had at any of the past three homeschooling park play dates.  The get together was a potluck too.  It just seemed to me that the parents were conscious, gentle involved, and intelligent and the children all got along together.  Probably because they were modeled a lifetime of respect and had<br/>
no need to fight because they are coming from a place of security.  I found this group through yahoo groups and it was recommended to me from someone I met online through unschooling basics.  Anyway, I look forward to another park date and the group itself online seems to be very active.  Maybe there is an AP group in your nearby area.  Alex is at an age now where the enrichment classes usually do not involved parents within the enviroment so the choice of teacher for me is very important.  I becoe very stressed when I am near anyone who is threatening or screaming at a child.  Another thing I am very grateful for<br/>
is Alex&#39;s sensei.  She is a wonderful person and he spends two 45 min. private sessions a week with her.  I think for me the priority<br/>
is to have connections.  It&#39;s wonderful if they are peer group but if I can not find that I will find someone he can interact with through mentoring.  He chooses what he is interested in learning though.  Another idea is maybe setting up a playdate in an environment where a vocal/controlling parent may be less likely to act out.  Example being someplace like a science museum.  I think some people are at there absolute worse at the park and beach.  Sometimes there are once a month classes for the young at place like the Aquarium of the Paciific and the children can learn and interact and even if a lifetime bond is not made they still have some moments with peers.  Anyway, didn&#39;t mean to write a novel.  Sorry, for the length.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927658939">Anyone watching the convention?<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
I watched a bit of it -- some of Hillary&#39;s intro and Bill Clinton&#39;s speech.  What I can&#39;t get over in all the recent coverage is the Republicans saying that this is the most liberal ticket in Democrat history.  Okay, and is that supposed to be a bad thing?<br/>
