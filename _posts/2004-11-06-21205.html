<div id="ygrps-yiv-979333501">Hi ladies-<br/>
I&#39;m a mom to 6 (w/twins in there) and have always homeschooled...<br/>
I was just wondering how or what you all do as to -schooling or &quot;un-<br/>
schooling&quot; each day? Or if you even have a set schedule or what? We <br/>
kind of &quot;go w/the flow&quot; as of now... and pick and choose what we <br/>
like/dislike and go from there. Thanks for any input and take <br/>
care! :)<br/>
Blessings-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796196906">Our schedule involves appointments, people coming over, parties, movies <br/>
needing to be returned, and when/whether Kirby (and lately Marty) has to work.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were little, we scheduled around the homeschooling park day and <br/>
babysitting co-op exchanges (which for the kids were just playtime <br/>
opportunities).<br/>
<br/>
After a lot of scheduled days, a day or three of &quot;nothing&quot; can seem heavenly. <br/>
 After a week of &quot;nothing particular,&quot; though, a few firm commitments can be <br/>
a relief.<br/>
<br/>
So I think maybe you could schedule some unscheduled days. :-)<br/>

Forgot to mention...<br/>

There&#39;s a collection of reports of unschooling days here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306932096">Lately, our days revolve around our new horse.  :0)  It doesnt get any<br/>
better than that!  Every time I watch the school bus go by or talk to a<br/>
homeschool family who cant play because they arent done school yet, I<br/>
think to myself, we are *so* lucky!  What a life we have!  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We got our first horse two weeks ago.  My girls are 8 and almost 10 and they<br/>
are horse crazy!  Our horse is boarded at a barn ½ mile from our house.  We<br/>
are there first thing in the morning to clean her stall, groom her, and ride<br/>
her most days. We go back and help shovel stalls later on and help feed and<br/>
bring the horses in to their stalls. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we are home, we are either playing with friends, just playing, reading<br/>
about horses, watching horses on TV, or keeping the house running.  Weve<br/>
been enjoying a new card game called Websters Word Madness.  The girls have<br/>
gotten back into Zoo Tycoon and Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Theres a new Roller<br/>
Coaster Tycoon  3 out with very cool graphics.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have no worries that my girls wont learn what they need to know.  They<br/>
are little sponges who absorb everything around them, as they need it.  It<br/>
seems so natural to me.  It saddens me when I listen to other peoples<br/>
concerns for their childrens education.  They are missing out, in a big<br/>
way, on today.  <br/>
