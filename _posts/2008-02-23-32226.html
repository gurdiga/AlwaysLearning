<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433597425">I love when people list a blog or personal page in a sigline, so I  <br/>
can go and look at their families and their smiles and their dogs and  <br/>
boats/trailers/decks/whatever.<br/>
<br/>
For those who miss pictures in all this text-based discussion...<br/>

<br/>
Here are photos of Marty taken last night, and of Holly on Wednesday  <br/>
and our friend Ben on Wednesday.  Ben is Marty&#39;s &quot;squire  <br/>
brother&quot; (they&#39;re both squired to the same knight in the SCA), and a  <br/>
student of mine (SCA context also).  He and Holly are good friends  <br/>
and we got to go to his wedding a  year and a half ago in Silver City.<br/>
<br/>
The one behind Marty is Holly&#39;s special friend.  If you know Kirby  <br/>
and it occurs to you that Brett looks kind of like Kirby somehow,  <br/>
you&#39;re right.  We can all see it.  They have similarities of  <br/>
personality and behavior too.  So Holly&#39;s not looking for her dad, in  <br/>
a man, it seems.  Maybe she&#39;s looking for her oldest brother.   (And  <br/>
Brett was Kirby&#39;s friend before any of the rest of us met him too,  <br/>
from the realm of table gaming, CCGs, or whatever, a few years back.)<br/>
<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know Holly&#39;s photoshop proclivities, some of her  <br/>
stuff is also here:<br/>

Cameras and computers have been very very good to Holly.<br/>
