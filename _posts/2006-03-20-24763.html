 </span></blockquote>There aren&#39;t &quot;early learning necessities.&quot;  It&#39;s all learning.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to teach them to read sentences, or write sentences.   <br/>
Just help them understand whatever is in front of them at the moment,  <br/>
and they&#39;ll do their own learning.<br/>
<br/>
Workbooks don&#39;t help, but they won&#39;t hurt either IF the kids can use  <br/>
them or not, use them &quot;wrong&quot;â€”just treat them as you would a coloring  <br/>
book or puzzle book.  (Assuming you don&#39;t make them start at the  <br/>
beginning of a coloring book and have each page checked before going  <br/>
to the next one &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>

has any advice on how to teach them to read, because they want to<br/>
learn how, then please feel free. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t teach them to read.  Read to them, play word games, maybe write  <br/>
down stories they tell you or the words to songs they like and print  <br/>
them out for them.  Read them to them.  Don&#39;t pressure them.  They  <br/>
can learn to read on their own, in a word-rich and trusting and  <br/>
peaceful environment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t.  Teach them, that is.   Unschooling is trusting that your <br/>
children will learn what they need to know when they need to know it.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to read more about it at Sandra&#39;s website<br/>
<br/>
www.sandradodd.com<br/>
<br/>
And at Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s website:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm....well, since you can&#39;t do both, you are probably more of an <br/>
eclectic, or relaxed type of homeschooler.  You&#39;ll understand the <br/>
difference after you read a lot at those two sites I just gave you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can help them as they learn to read by answering their questions, <br/>
making yourself available to read to them whenever and whatever they want <br/>
or need you to, and just being with them, using language and playing with <br/>
language and enjoying language.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t teach someone else to read, though.  Learning is an internal <br/>
process that happens as a person&#39;s brain sorts and categorizes and recalls <br/>
bits of information.<br/>
<br/>
A really great book to read is by John Holt, called _Learning All The <br/>
Time_, and is about how young children make such connections through their <br/>
play and interaction with the people in their lives.<br/>

&quot;Real, natural learning is in the living. It&#39;s in the observing, the <br/>
questioning, the examining, the pondering, the analyzing, the watching, the <br/>
reading, the DO-ing, the living, the breathing, the loving, the Joy. It&#39;s <br/>
in the Joy.&quot; ~Anne Ohman<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511772240">Hi Jen,<br/>
<br/>
My dd will be 7 in May.  She isn&#39;t reading yet.  We did get 100 Easy Lessons <br/>
but barely use it.  She writes letters to her friends and extended family <br/>
members.  She used to ask me how to spell every word, but can write a few <br/>
sentences/words on her own now.   She wanted to be an Author so she put <br/>
paper together and taped it (I would have prefered staples bc its a mess, <br/>
but its a book nonetheless).  Its called Harry Potter and the Fearful <br/>
Snowman.  She has about 8 pages written so far, all her own words - she asks <br/>
me how to spell the words and writes them.  She even asked our local <br/>
Librarian if she could write a copy of her book to put on the library shelf <br/>
and they said they would!  &lt;grin&gt;  She has written her own address book with <br/>
friends and family names, addresses and phone numers.  She loves maps, like <br/>
her daddy, and she points to a country, copies the name and draws a <br/>
picucture of the country and the flag.  I&#39;ve never taught her geography, and <br/>
she knows many country flags and how to spell the country name.  My point is <br/>
that we haven&#39;t done any *traditional* or scheduled reading or writing <br/>
lessons.  Everything we&#39;ve done has come from my dd and she does whatever <br/>
she can on her own and when she asks how to spell or do something then I do. <br/>
She is starting to pick up words here and there and can sound out some <br/>
things to spell on her own.<br/>
<br/>
