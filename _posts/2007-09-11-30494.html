These fears usually creep in for me if I have ventured into the shopping<br/>
mall.  My children, snuggled against me or running at my feet, seem wild<br/>
- especially compared to the spaced out kids who are happy to be pushed<br/>
around, placid and quiet, in strollers.  Sometimes I think I *really*<br/>
want a quiet child.  I think that this has a lot to do with our societal<br/>
dislike of children and normal child behavior.  We are conditioned to<br/>
believe that children should be quiet, controlled, unnoticed.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to remind myself that what I am told is good in children is not<br/>
what I like in adults.  I don&#39;t want to hang out with people who are<br/>
bored (and boring), quiet, indifferent.  I want to hang out with people<br/>
who care, think, want, question, and dream - people like my kids.  So<br/>
while they make shopping difficult, they make life interesting.  They<br/>
are fabulous kids, and I am confident that they will make fabulous<br/>
adults too.  I am sure that at some point my kids will learn to be quiet<br/>
when necessary - but I am not sure that those other kinds of kids will<br/>
learn to be vivid life livers.<br/>
<br/>
When I really doubt myself I read an article like &quot;Raise Children with A<br/>
Wild Streak&quot; which I have copied below.<br/>

Raise children with a wild streak<br/>
Many &#39;ideal&#39; students lack inventive, restless and self-reliant spirit<br/>
<br/>
by: Mark Pruett<br/>
<br/>
A new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics stresses the<br/>
importance of childhood playtime. It reinforces my own belief that many<br/>
young adults have been cheated by years of excessive schoolwork and<br/>
teamwork, too many extracurricular activities, and a straitjacketed<br/>
&quot;just say no to anything risky&quot; upbringing. I am convinced that modern<br/>
childhood generally does not build enough independence and thirst for<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
For the past few years I helped interview high school seniors seeking<br/>
scholarships to come to Appalachian State University. These applicants<br/>
come from all over the state. They play instruments and sports,<br/>
participate in church and charity, and work in diverse jobs.<br/>
<br/>
They also display remarkably similar accomplishments. They are at the<br/>
top of their high school classes and possess generically good manners.<br/>
They lead teams, groups and clubs. They are smart, solid and<br/>
hardworking.<br/>
<br/>
They might be surprised to learn that I, like many college professors,<br/>
yearn for rarer traits -- curiosity, passion, a wild streak. Yes,<br/>
teamwork and leadership skills will help your child to implement someone<br/>
else&#39;s ideas, and extensive extracurricular activities will foster<br/>
responsibility. What your child really needs, though, is an inventive,<br/>
self-reliant, restless spirit.<br/>
The key questions<br/>
<br/>
For me, the heart-wrenching interview moment is when we ask these<br/>
teenagers what they would choose to do on a day spent alone. Many say<br/>
they never have the chance. Worse still, some have no answer at all.<br/>
This should disturb and sadden any parent. In the end, my scholarship<br/>
votes ride on two questions: Is this someone that I&#39;d be excited to have<br/>
in my class? And is he or she open to being changed by my class? Class<br/>
rank and extracurricular activities are less important than genuine<br/>
individuality or enthusiasm. It matters not whether someone is bold or<br/>
shy, worldly or na&#65533;ve. Is there a flash of determination, a<br/>
streak of independence, a creative passion, an excited curiosity?<br/>
<br/>
We need more students like the ones who leave after graduation to work<br/>
as missionaries or in the Peace Corps. More like the ones who start<br/>
successful businesses while in school. More like the ones who find the<br/>
courage to go overseas for a summer or a semester because they know<br/>
their own worlds are far too small.<br/>
<br/>
Some students are team players and high achievers, but I&#39;d trade them<br/>
for stubbornly creative iconoclasts. Some students as children were<br/>
taught to color inside the lines, watch Barney the purple dinosaur, and<br/>
always ask permission. We need students who found out what Crayons<br/>
tasted like, loved reading &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot; and paid little<br/>
attention to rules -- students whose parents encouraged their children&#39;s<br/>
curiosity.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
Something&#39;s missing<br/>
<br/>
The irony is that many students begin to perceive late in college that<br/>
they&#39;ve missed something along the way. They regret not taking risks<br/>
with difficult professors, unusual courses or semesters abroad. They<br/>
berate themselves by equating self-worth with grades, and they are<br/>
saddened by the realization that they have only glimpsed the breadth of<br/>
the university. They begin to grasp that their uncomfortable sense of<br/>
passivity has its roots in the highly controlled existence foisted on<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Parents: love, guide and support your children, but don&#39;t insulate them,<br/>
control them or let them be too busy. Independence, confidence and<br/>
creativity come from freedom, risk and a good measure of unstructured<br/>
solitude.<br/>
<br/>
Encourage studying but make them play hooky, too -- partly to learn what<br/>
it feels like to be unprepared and partly to foster spontaneity,<br/>
irreverence and joy. Study chemistry together, then blow up a television<br/>
in the backyard.<br/>
<br/>
Foster camaraderie and connectedness through group activities<br/>
(especially family ones), but be unyielding in your commitment to<br/>
teaching them to love doing things entirely on their own. Make each<br/>
child plan and cook the family&#39;s dinner on his or her own once a week.<br/>
<br/>
Surround them with books, not video games. Raise a garden or build a<br/>
deck together. Send them on solo trips.<br/>
<br/>
However you choose to do it, give your children, their teachers and<br/>
society one of the greatest gifts of all: Help your kids become<br/>
creative, independent, curious, interesting people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that you have to remember that we are not raising &quot;well <br/>
behaved&quot; kids we are rasing REAL kids- I think that it is so amazing <br/>
that kids have the choice to say no-<br/>
<br/>
I know many adults that when someone says go here or do that or say <br/>
this in a group they automatically do it even if they would really <br/>
rather not. <br/>
<br/>
These types of adults will not be our kids- our kids will say &quot;no&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it is the fear that unschooling &quot;might&quot; not &quot;work&quot; but it <br/>
will not produce the &quot;well behaved&quot; kids it will produce kids who <br/>
can and will say what they want and think and feel.<br/>
<br/>
Are these kids that way because they are more mature and maybe<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my son is &quot;behind&quot; or have they been threatned,hit or rewarded? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I get a niggling that says if you just make them then it <br/>
will be soooo much easier but then I see amazing things from them <br/>
and I smile and know it is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
people assume that kids should be willing to &quot;do&quot; anything you tell <br/>
them- maybe less kids would walk off with strangers if they knew the <br/>
power of saying NO- that their NO matters<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise kids are kids and it is ok to NOT answer someone and to <br/>
NOT go do something<br/>
<br/>
I was outside with my girls and there was this little five yr old <br/>
was a block from his home and he walked right over to me and started <br/>
talking- I could have easily got him to my car or house and then <br/>
snatched him- I felt soooo bad for him- I kept asking if his mom <br/>
knew where he was- he said yes- <br/>
<br/>
We might always compare but compare the good things too or look at <br/>
them another way</div>

<br/>
It&#39;s not the comparison, it&#39;s the emotional feelings that go with it  <br/>
that might be harmful.<br/>
<br/>
I dont think people can stop comparing and analyzing.  It&#39;s just part  <br/>
of thought and language, and those are absolute parts of instinctive  <br/>
human behavior.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You didn&#39;t remind us of his age.  I forget the details of who&#39;s who;  <br/>
I&#39;m sorry about that.  Remind us, if it might help with people&#39;s  <br/>
respnses, please.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby moved and talked more than others his age when he was four,  <br/>
five.   When he was two and three he tended to sit with me.  Then he  <br/>
got brave and curious and wanted to touch and mess with things.    <br/>
Friends and strangers commented sometimes, and we would try to keep  <br/>
him reined in to the point that he wasn&#39;t disturbing other people  <br/>
actually (not counting them being disturbed that we were letting him  <br/>
pick things up in stores and such, because outside the store owner it  <br/>
was okay with us--if store owners seemed uncomfortable I would hold  <br/>
the thing and let him touch it while I held it, or something like that).<br/>
<br/>
Other kids were being prevented.<br/>
<br/>
The result I saw in some of the prevented-kids, when they got older,  <br/>
those I knew longterm (and some I know still, in their young adult  <br/>
lives) is that the spark of active curiosity was left cold.  By the  <br/>
time they were old enough for their parents to allow them to move and  <br/>
touch, they didn&#39;t so much want to anymore.  They were embarrassed,  <br/>
because they didn&#39;t want to act like kids.  A false-ish maturity was  <br/>
on them.  They were acting mature.  Meanwhile, Kirby knew enough  <br/>
about the world around him that he was *being* mature.<br/>
<br/>
A comment was left on my blog this morning, not about Kirby but the  <br/>
other two (who are 18 and 15) that said the teenagers in general (at  <br/>
the L&L conferences in general) are an inspiration and source of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Not often in this world do people describe teens as an inspiration  <br/>
and a source of wisdom.  Pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
When I went to get the exact words, there was a newer comment:   <br/>
&quot;Marty and Holly continue to be inspirations to me :)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wowie!  Wow.  That&#39;s very cool.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am comparing my kids to other kids.  I can&#39;t help it.  But  <br/>
I&#39;m happy with them, and they&#39;ll be home at 10:30 tonight and I&#39;ll  <br/>
tell them thanks for my cut of their glory.<br/>
<br/>
My friends who kept their kids so close and quiet when they were  <br/>
little did it, I think, in hopes of praise from others down the line,  <br/>
in hopes of success for their children.   I let mine explore and talk  <br/>
and play in the same kind of hope.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t see or rightly guess the future.  We can only look at other  <br/>
people&#39;s lives and problems and behaviors and results and make our  <br/>
own best choices in light of what we see and think.<br/>
<br/>
When you compare, maybe look for the best things.  Look at him as you  <br/>
would an adult visitor from another culture.  Moving around a room  <br/>
isn&#39;t bad in a hospital.  There are some times and places when it&#39;s  <br/>
worse or better than others, and you can talk to your child about  <br/>
that and find him places where he can be more active.   As you help  <br/>
him figure out where the better places are, he&#39;ll be learning to  <br/>
think of that on his own.<br/>

I have to remind myself that what I am told is good in children is not<br/>

bored (and boring), quiet, indifferent.  I want to hang out with people<br/>
who care, think, want, question, and dream - people like my kids.&quot;<br/>

My son is older now and the issues of being physically quiet and<br/>
controlled in social settings are pretty much behind us.  Now that<br/>
same social expectation that kids should be made to &quot;behave&quot; crops up<br/>
when he engages in conversation or verbal exchanges with many adults.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes feel uncomfortable when he doesn&#39;t just go along with what<br/>
some other adult says, as a way of smoothing an awkward social moment.<br/>
 But he has a keen BS detector, and knows when someone is being<br/>
patronizing -- which, he says, grownups often are when they&#39;re talking<br/>
to kids who want to discuss and disagree with something they&#39;ve said.<br/>
 Lots of adults think a child who disagrees with them (however<br/>
politely) is being disrespectful, and they will go to great lengths to<br/>
force that child to agree with them, or in some way verbally roll over<br/>
and say &#39;uncle&#39;.<br/>

But you&#39;re right - the world NEEDS people who &#39;care, think, want,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778764907">-=-Lots of adults think a child who disagrees with them (however<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
In light of various other recent incidents, though, I want to jump  <br/>
off from here.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, parents tell their kids that to disagree is okay, and  <br/>
those kids go on to be disrespectful because their mom told them some  <br/>
version of &quot;if an adult isn&#39;t nice to you that&#39;s THEIR problem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same with kids in malls or stores.  It&#39;s possible to be curious and  <br/>
active and still not a holy terror.  And it&#39;s possible for a mom to  <br/>
think (it seems, by comments some have made on discussion lists like  <br/>
this one) that as an unschooler she is forbidden (!?! yeah...) to  <br/>
&quot;control&quot; her child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s somewhere between &quot;let them do nothing at all&quot; and &quot;let them do  <br/>
anything they damned well please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hanging around a lot with a 22 year old, schooled but curious  <br/>
young man.  We&#39;re discussing lots of serious topics.  He feels he&#39;s  <br/>
been deprived of lots of knowledge and ideas.  (He&#39;s right.)  He  <br/>
wants to be more like Marty and Brett, he said (another unschooled  <br/>
young man of his social acquaintance).   I&#39;m willing to help him.   <br/>
But sometimes he wants to disagree in such a way that he implies (or  <br/>
says) that his opinion is as valid as mine.<br/>
<br/>
On some topics his opinion is way MORE valid than mine.  On some they  <br/>
might as well be equal.  On some, he needs to shut entirely up.  He  <br/>
will *tell* me how it is about marriage and love.  He will TELL me  <br/>
that there&#39;s nothing more important than defying authority.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to be more mature.  He has a reputation for being wild and  <br/>
immature.  He earned it, but he&#39;d like to shed it.  I&#39;m trying to  <br/>
help.  He said he didn&#39;t want to lose it completely.   I&#39;m trying to  <br/>
persuade him that there are times to let loose and be a smart-aleck  <br/>
and to take the jab if people leave themselves open to a snappy  <br/>
comeback.  As an example, I said  that he wouldn&#39;t behave the same  <br/>
way at a funeral as at a wedding (and the wedding reception would be  <br/>
different again).  He has never been to a funeral.  He&#39;s been to two  <br/>
weddings, one very informal in a park.<br/>
<br/>
So he can&#39;t talk to me about funerals and weddings.  He can&#39;t talk to  <br/>
me about relationships in an equal way, but he has several times said  <br/>
things like &quot;Well I disagree&quot; or &quot;Marriage only affects those two  <br/>
people and it&#39;s nobody else&#39;s business.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He himself is fairly well trashed by a divorce and remarriage of his  <br/>
mom.  He despises his step father.  Yet his ideas are inflexible and  <br/>
based on nothing real.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when he disagrees with me he&#39;s being deeply disrespectful.<br/>
Sometimes when someone says they doubt my kids really are as I  <br/>
describe them, that&#39;s being very disrespectful.<br/>
Sometimes when people say that if we cared about our kids we wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
risk them by unschooling...<br/>
<br/>
So please don&#39;t think that unschooling requires parents to encourage  <br/>
children to do whatever they want to regardless of other people&#39;s  <br/>
feelings.  THAT would be disrespectful to others, to your kids, and  <br/>
to those who&#39;ve been advising for so many years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840738142"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When i am at a place like the hospital waiting room(my husband had a<br/>
&gt; stroke a week ago,i have been quiet)and Lukas is running around the<br/>
&gt; chairs and i glance over at the little girl sitting soooo nice with<br/>
&gt; her mommy or <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We were visiting a hospital not that long ago too and experienced <br/>
something similar.  My youngest daughter just turned 6.  We weren&#39;t <br/>
visiting anyone sick (sorry about your husband), we rode on a new <br/>
tramway that went from a neighborhood way below to the hospital up on <br/>
the hill.<br/>
<br/>
The kids wanted to walk around the hospital so we did.  At one point <br/>
we had to wait in a waiting room area for someone to use the <br/>
bathroom.  Both my girls wanted to play, my oldest is 13.  They took <br/>
one unoccupied loveseat and one chair and tried to steal each others <br/>
by sitting on each other.  There was some running around and some <br/>
general wildness.<br/>
<br/>
When they got too loud I just reminded them that there were people <br/>
trying to have conversations or read quietly or talk on the phone.  <br/>
When they were running too much, I reminded them that they needed to <br/>
be careful going around corners and watching out for others needing <br/>
to get through.  When my youngest was getting too wild, I physically <br/>
redirected her in a pleasant way.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to gage how I was directing my kids to behave by the other <br/>
people using the same area.  The old ladies sitting near us actually <br/>
seemed to enjoy watching my kids play all happy and fun and a little <br/>
rowdy.  They were smiling, and watching my kids was bringing them <br/>
joy.  There were a few other people that tried to ignore them and <br/>
moved elsewhere in the sitting area.  When the sitting area got more <br/>
crowded the kids stayed more in one smaller space and were a little <br/>
quieter.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t an all or nothing deal, we weren&#39;t at a park, we were in a <br/>
hospital where people don&#39;t feel good and visitors might be worried <br/>
or sad, or maybe needing a lift in spirits, where others were doing <br/>
business or eating lunch or taking a brief moment to read.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have to tell my kids &quot;no&quot; or &quot;behave&quot;, I just reminded them <br/>
when they were going too far or too much and helped guide them to <br/>
settle down a little.</div>

like, today at the doctors, the office waiting room was empty. So,<br/>
Lukas wanted to climb on the chairs i thought that would be okay, he<br/>
had his shoes off but then he wanted to move the chairs around and i<br/>
said the people want the chairs where they have them, they are not our<br/>
chairs. Then i thought well, if moves them back where they were what<br/>
harm is there? He did move them back. Was my thinking on that okay?<br/>
A man and woman entered the waiting room. The woman took that clip<br/>
board and sat writing and Lukas was maybe 7feet away from<br/>
her,pointing,doing his Goblin laugh....har har har at her and she gave<br/>
him a look. I asked him to come outside with me for a walk. I said to<br/>
him that the woman was trying to do some paperwork and that was<br/>

It&#39;s not about twisting negative behavior and turning it to a  <br/>

Maybe you could think of it not as &quot;disciplining Lukas,&quot; but of  <br/>
guiding him as you would a visitor from far, far away, or someone who  <br/>
hasn&#39;t been on the planet long (which is exactly what he is, anyway-- <br/>
the latter).  Advise him.  Help him.  Remove him or distract him if  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Talk back&quot; has a bad connotation.<br/>
Think of other ways to word what it is you both agree you&#39;d like, and  <br/>
that might help you clarify your concerns.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t keep our kid from  using &quot;bad words.&quot;  We did tell them  <br/>
that there were places it wasn&#39;t okay to use them.  They  understood  <br/>
that early on.  (They&#39;re better at it than I am.)<br/>
<br/>
If your child isn&#39;t able to even consider sitting still, then he&#39;s  <br/>
not choosing to run around.  Only when you have choices can you choose.<br/>

 trouble with what the limits should be. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do not consider myself to be a permissive parent - in many ways I am<br/>
stricter than my peers.  If I am going to spend all day everyday with my<br/>
kids we need to be able to get along.  It can&#39;t be like the Wild Animal<br/>
Park over here.  I try to treat my kids with the same respect and<br/>
compassion that I bring to my spouse, friends, and other adult<br/>
relationships.  I ask myself how I would respond if it was another<br/>
adult.  Certainly I wouldn&#39;t stand in the doctor&#39;s office and scream<br/>
&quot;Sit the hell down and be quiet!&quot;  I might lean over and say &quot;You seem<br/>
really antsy, wanna go get a snack?  Or go for a walk?&quot;  I would not<br/>
allow my child to stand close to someone else, point and laugh - I do<br/>
not consider that to be respectful behavior.  If things got to that<br/>
point I would tell my child that was not a polite way to behave, and<br/>
then I would guide him out of the area into a space where he had more<br/>
room to be himself.  For us things wouldn&#39;t have gotten to that point -<br/>
I probably would have had him sitting with me talking, or looking<br/>
through magazines for pictures of cars or babies.  I would have worked<br/>
hard to set up the appointment for a time when I had the best shot at<br/>
having good behavior.  We would have eaten and used the bathroom before<br/>
coming inside.  We would have arrived unhurried, and probably looked at<br/>
a few bugs or rocks on the way in to the building.<br/>
<br/>
I often see parents who seem to be expecting more of their little ones<br/>
than they would of another adult.  I think that it is unreasonable to<br/>
assume that in an interesting or novel environment kids aren&#39;t going to<br/>
want to touch anything, see anything, or ask any questions.  I mean that<br/>
isn&#39;t how *I* behave!  My husband would know better than to try to get<br/>
me to walk past a new yarn store without going inside to check it out. <br/>
I should know better than to try to get my kiddo to walk past a toy<br/>
store without wanting to go in.  Just because my agenda doesn&#39;t involve<br/>
wanting to go to the toy store - that doesn&#39;t make his desire<br/>
unreasonable or invalid.  If I had a friend visiting I would say things<br/>
like &quot;its going to be a long drive, do you want to take a drink for the<br/>
car?&quot; or &quot;sometimes it is really cold in the city, let&#39;s bring your<br/>
coat.&quot;  I try to say these things to my kids too, in the same way, out<br/>
of love, caring, because of my greater understanding of the whole<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
If my child wants to run around, I try to honor that impulse.  Yet I do<br/>
not think that it is okay for him to run around during a wedding<br/>
ceremony, and I would not allow that behavior.  I believe that it is<br/>
ultimately in my child&#39;s best interests to learn to move in the adult<br/>
world - so that he can maximize his opportunities to do the things he<br/>
finds interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513264942">I&#39;ve been thinking the same thing.  Even IF a parent plans ahead, <br/>
tries to engage a child in a quiet activity, brings a snack, etc., <br/>
that doesn&#39;t guarantee that a child will sit and be quiet in the <br/>
waiting room.  My daughter will always choose to talk to anyone <br/>
that&#39;s there.  If I see that the person is busy or obviously doesn&#39;t <br/>
not want to converse, I will talk to my daughter about it.  She can <br/>
almost always be enticed by an elevator or escalator ride if it&#39;s <br/>
available :)<br/>

And I&#39;m not sure why a 5-year old boy pointing and doing a pirate <br/>

pretending, maybe he was trying to engage the lady or amuse her - <br/>
who knows?  I might tell my child that most people don&#39;t like to be <br/>

most people would be offended.  He&#39;s five.  <br/>

I have never liked the phrase &quot;talking back&quot; or the word <br/>
disrespectful even, probably because they are most often used to <br/>
describe children who do not act in a way that makes situations easy <br/>
on adults.  <br/>

Pointing at kids he&#39;s playing with and laughing at them might be part  <br/>
of the game.<br/>
<br/>
A woman at work with a clipboard wasn&#39;t playing with him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always rude to laugh right at someone.<br/>
It&#39;s nearly always rude to point at someone.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth letting kids know that.  If they point because they have  <br/>
no idea it&#39;s rude, the parents have failed to provide information.   <br/>
If  they laugh at people because they have no idea it&#39;s rude, the  <br/>

<br/>
Should unschoolers be exempt from social expectations like that?   <br/>
 From courtesy or consideration or thoughtfulness?<br/>
There aren&#39;t really any exemptions.<br/>
<br/>
Well, there are--but to claim an exemption, one must also give up  <br/>
hope of being taken seriously and being given serious respect and  <br/>
opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe he was just<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s only playing if everyone&#39;s playing, as we always told our kids  <br/>
when they tried to shoot people who weren&#39;t in their game, or make  <br/>
fun of someone who really wasn&#39;t in the mood.  It&#39;s only fun if  <br/>
everyone&#39;s having fun.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I might tell my child that most people don&#39;t like to be<br/>
pointed at, but I wouldn&#39;t really think it rude, and I don&#39;t think<br/>
most people would be offended. He&#39;s five. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Right after five comes six.  When should a parent advise a child on  <br/>
expectations?  If the parent chooses not to, will it be offensive if  <br/>
a seven year old points at you in public and laughs?  What if he&#39;s  <br/>
twelve?  Fifteen?<br/>
<br/>
The question was about whether the mom should say something and where  <br/>
the line might be.  To say &quot;There shouldn&#39;t be a line; others  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be offended&quot; isn&#39;t helpful in considering where the line  <br/>
might be, is it?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have never liked the phrase &quot;talking back&quot; or the word<br/>
disrespectful even, probably because they are most often used to<br/>
describe children who do not act in a way that makes situations easy<br/>
on adults. -=<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Talking back&quot; seems to have to do with &quot;speak when spoken to&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;seen but not heard&quot; traditions, and I have no interest in that.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always been as respectful of our children as we could be, and  <br/>
it has caused them to be pretty respectful of others. Holly had a  <br/>
quickie meltdown when she was in pain from an ear ache, and  <br/>
exhausted, and feeling crowded, she said.  She told me about it today  <br/>
at lunch; it happened when she was at a conference and I wasn&#39;t.  But  <br/>
she talked about people who helped her out, and she was remorseful  <br/>
about having not having had the wherewithal to be more gentle and  <br/>
patient.  And when the tea tree oil and the Motrin (thank you to moms  <br/>
who aided her!) took effect and she was able to stand up and move  <br/>
again, after about an hour, she said, she went and did better.<br/>
<br/>
Respect is regard.  Respect is consideration.  Respect is  <br/>
acknowledgement and recognition.<br/>
In my life at this point respect and disrespect aren&#39;t words about  <br/>
children, so I don&#39;t have the association of that with &quot;talking  <br/>
back.&quot;   I want my children to be respectable.  For others to respect  <br/>
them, they need to be respectful of others.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s what one gives away when one consciously chooses to  <br/>
disregard etiquette and tradition:  respectability.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, when my kids were pretty young, I wrote about how it was  <br/>
going with our giving them lots of respect.  That&#39;s here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>
<br/>
A little part of that:<br/>
***********&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I really believe unschooling works best when parents trust a child&#39;s  <br/>
personhood, his intelligence, his instincts, his potential to be  <br/>
mature and calm. Take any of that away, and the child becomes smaller  <br/>
and powerless to some degree.<br/>
<br/>
Give them power and respect, and they become respected and powerful.<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
To encourage irritating behavior doesn&#39;t help his potential to be  <br/>
mature and calm.  It takes it away and makes him smaller.<br/>

<br/>
The OP said that she did take her son away and tell him that what he <br/>
did was rude.  I was trying to say that it didn&#39;t have to be a huge <br/>
deal.  We can give information and move on, and I think that most <br/>
people wouldn&#39;t think too much of the incident from a young child.  <br/>
It can be a long process with some children to figure out what is <br/>
inappropriate and think before doing.<br/>

rude.  Sometimes children try to engage people in odd ways as they <br/>
are trying to figure out social nuances.  You don&#39;t always know how <br/>
a person will respond.  My daughter has been confused in the past <br/>
when her grampa laughs at something she does and hugs her, but then <br/>
a stranger looks at her like she did something really strange. <br/>

  This is Tamzin totally! Even when she was a toddler, she would just want to sit quietly and observe people. If someone talked to her, she would just look at them and then turn her head into me. She still doesn&#39;t like new situations and it&#39;s hard for her to walk into a situation where she doesn&#39;t know anyone. I&#39;ve role played with her and given her &#39;script&#39; ideas for what to say/do, but unless she knows at least one other person, she&#39;s really uncomfortable. She won&#39;t approach anyone new by herself. It&#39;s still just too scary for her.<br/>
  She&#39;s always been a deep thinker and I think her &#39;quiet/stillness&#39; is an intregal part of that. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s also why she&#39;s never been very comfortable in a large group setting (although that&#39;s changing now).<br/>
  I remember when she was about 18 months, I looked after a friends kiddo for a couple of hours and it was a shock to the system (& my house LOL). Any surface that had anything on top of it at her level was cleared in one huge sweeping movement &lt;g&gt;. Tamzin would go pick stuff up and look at it or play with it, but she never just cleared a table top for the hell of it (she could&#39;ve, but she just never did). I remember Tamzin just watching Eva with a puzzled look, like &#39;why would you want to do that?&#39;. I kind of expected Tamzin to experiment with the concept either while Eva was there or maybe later on, but she never did.<br/>
  So, yes, people would comment on how &#39;well behaved&#39; she was (especially when she was smaller).<br/>
