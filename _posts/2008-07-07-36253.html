<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445496060">Here&#39;s part of an e-mail I received offlist from the &quot;How to Screw it Up&quot;  <br/>
thread that I thought I&#39;d bring here with my response:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I tell  my kids all the time to &quot;go look it up&quot;  or find the answer for <br/>
themselves, and I tell them WHY I want them to look  it up. There are <br/>
three reasons. First reason: they are less likely to seek  out the <br/>
answers for themselves. What will they do when I am no longer  around? <br/>
Ask another person??? Second reason: I want them to RELY on their  <br/>
ability to find the &quot;right&quot; answer for them. Third reason: Seeking  <br/>
answers aids in development of critical thinking  skills.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I was told to &quot;look it up&quot; all the time when I was a kid. I often  ended up <br/>
feeling frustrated, sad, angry, lonely and/or misunderstood *and*  it often <br/>
made me lose the enthusiasm I had for the project I was working on. How  <br/>
frustrating it was to me to be writing a story, the flow of ideas running  quickly and <br/>
smoothly from my brain through the pen onto paper, completely  immersed in <br/>
the idea I was conveying, when I&#39;d get stuck on a spelling or  needed to know if <br/>
the word I wanted to use in that particular spot was the right  definition <br/>
for what I was trying to say and I&#39;d search around for help. Parents.  They were <br/>
older, wiser, had more information than I did, and they were right  there! It <br/>
would have been so wonderful to have the person who knew the answer to  just <br/>
give it to me so I could go on learning and creating. Instead, I got the  rote <br/>
response and my enthusiasm dulled. Add to that, the time it took to go to  <br/>
the other end of the house and dig through the book to get the item I needed  <br/>
often broke my train of thought so thoroughly that I couldn&#39;t finish my project  <br/>
as well as I could have if someone could have just inserted the item directly <br/>
 into my flow of thought. Yuck.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes, my dad would say something to the effect of, &quot;Let&#39;s go get the  <br/>
encyclopedia and see.&quot; When that happened, we often spent at least 20 minutes,  <br/>
sometimes an entire afternoon looking at things in the set, one thing leading <br/>
to  another, Dad&#39;s experiences being shared and filling the &quot;search&quot; periods. <br/>
It was  truly &quot;connections&quot; as one thing led to another which led to another <br/>
and yet  another.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;First reason: they are less likely to seek out the <br/>
answers  for themselves. What will they do when I am no longer around? <br/>
Ask another  person???&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
I always gladly spell whatever my son asks me to-even using a dictionary or  <br/>
spellcheck to make certain that I&#39;m correct. It hasn&#39;t yet hampered his desire <br/>
 to look things up, learn or his desire to acquire knowledge. It definitely <br/>
helps  him keep the flow in his projects. It also solidifies our relationship <br/>
so that  he knows if he needs help with anything, I am always willing to <br/>
help-even if I  need to get help myself to help *him*. And I *love* looking things <br/>
up together  with him! I&#39;m sure I will with his younger brother as well, when <br/>
that time  comes.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t plan on not being around for my son to ask for a mighty long time,  <br/>
yet. By the time I&#39;m no longer around, he should have a full understanding of  <br/>
the many, varied ways he can find the answers he seeks. And asking for help  <br/>
won&#39;t be something taboo or to be avoided because it was required. I feel <br/>
giving  my son answers or looking them up with him is a joy and another way to not <br/>
only  spend time with him, but to show him that learning need never stop and <br/>
that it  is fun as well as something people can do together-not a lonely chore <br/>
one has  had foisted upon them. If I were gone, I would heartily hope that he <br/>
would ask  someone else! If he had a need, I would want him to ask, not keep <br/>
silent and  feel that he should know or be able to figure something out on his <br/>
own. Or  heaven forbid-that it was shameful to ask.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Second reason: I want them to RELY on their <br/>
ability to find  the &quot;right&quot; answer for them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Once I knew how to look something up, I knew how. I didn&#39;t need years of  <br/>
repeating the process to &quot;ingrain&quot; it in my brain. A handful of tries and I was  <br/>
confident in my ability to use that source and find the answer(s) I was  <br/>
seeking. It&#39;s fairly simple-well, it was in those days. There is a vast  wellspring <br/>
of resources now, and the difficulty may be in choosing one or two! <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Third reason: Seeking <br/>
answers aids in development of  critical thinking skills.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Okay, I can buy that &quot;seeking answers leads to critical thinking skills&quot;,  <br/>
but honestly, I haven&#39;t found anything yet, in our unschooling lives, that  <br/>
*hasn&#39;t* lead to critical thinking skills or just plain old &quot;thinking skills&quot;.  <br/>
Too many negatives there... maybe like this: So far, everything in our  <br/>
unschooling lives has lead to critical thinking skills or just plain old  &quot;thinking <br/>
skills&quot;. My providing answers for my son or looking things up together  has not <br/>
stunted his ability to question or evaluate anything he hears that  doesn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;jive&quot; with him. Really, like those rare times with my dad, it tends to  lead to <br/>
deeper conversations, more connections... more learning and more  trust.... <br/>
and better relationships.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
Well yeh.  The culture we live in may promote being totally independent and<br/>
not being a &quot;burden.&quot;  The truth is people getting something done, say for a<br/>
job, ask for help when needed.  If someone right there has the specific info<br/>
needed, it&#39;s inefficient to spend extra energy and thought running around<br/>
looking things up just to say --to yourself mainly-- that you did it.<br/>
There&#39;s nothing incompetent about asking for help.  Anybody can choose to<br/>
ask for help, and it works very nicely most of the time if you do.<br/>
<br/>
I will never forget the awful advice from a counselor who evaluated my<br/>
hearing when I was in my twenties.  Her idea is that people with<br/>
disabilities charm others into helping them and thereby become too<br/>
dependent.  What she said just isn&#39;t true.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459192196">First, a note to whoever wrote this offlist.  I&#39;m guessing you were  <br/>
afraid to put it on the full list.  That&#39;s okay.<br/>
Don&#39;t take offense that it will be discussed.  That&#39;s what discussion  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll start at the top, saving the best for last.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the first was a typo/error.  I&#39;m guessing the writer  <br/>
intended &quot;they are more likely to seek out the answers for  <br/>
themselves&quot;--otherwise it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense.<br/>
<br/>
But this...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What will they do when I am no longer around?   Ask another person??? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just coldly illogical.  What will your husband do when you&#39;re  <br/>
no longer around?  What will your children do for food when you&#39;re  <br/>
not around?  Do you want them to start finding solace and sustenance  <br/>
from other people now?  Or do you want to be there for them while  <br/>
you&#39;re still alive?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Second reason: I want them to RELY on their ability to find the  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; answer for them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps they want to rely on you.  Perhaps you could show them how to  <br/>
look things up, and show them that it can be fun.  Perhaps it&#39;s not  <br/>
something that needs to be looked up.  Maybe you already know the  <br/>
answer and could share it.<br/>
<br/>
When Keith and I were young, early 20&#39;s, he wasn&#39;t a good speller and  <br/>
I didn&#39;t know the times tables up around and among 6, 7 and 8.  We  <br/>
made a deal that we would  never shame the other or explain, just  <br/>
spell or give a number.  So I would yell across the house &quot;What&#39;s 7  <br/>
times 8? and he would yell back the answer.  Or he would come and say  <br/>
&quot;How do you spell &#39;committee&#39;?&quot; and I would just spell it, nicely,  <br/>
generously.   So when we had kids it was easy to help them the same  <br/>
way--NICELY.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew used to call me and ask me all kinds of questions, if his  <br/>
parents would say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  They got to saying &quot;Call Aunt  <br/>
Sandra,&quot; in fact, instead of &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  I didn&#39;t mind at all.   <br/>
It gave us a chance to share something.  I got to know what he was  <br/>
thinking about or writing about, and he got to know more about me.<br/>
<br/>
It makes more sense to ask a person than to look in a book anyway, as  <br/>
a first pass.  And these days it makes more sense to google than to  <br/>
look in a book.  You get photos and facsimiles and sound files.  If  <br/>
you got to google and put in &quot;define angst&quot; (or whatever) you get  <br/>
several dictionaries and a thesaurus all in one move, and you can cut  <br/>
and paste the information you find.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Third reason: Seeking answers aids in development of critical  <br/>
thinking skills.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nothing improves and clarifies thinking like explaining something.   <br/>
And critical thinking can be employed and shared by the parent  <br/>
including, in the explanation, how she knows what it is she&#39;s  <br/>
sharing, and if she knows more than one version or theory (depending  <br/>
what kind of question).  And then if the child wants to know more,  <br/>
they can look it up together.  It becomes a shared experience.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what unschooling is about.<br/>
<br/>
A very short article I wrote in early 1998 is here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/aradicalthought">http://sandradodd.com/aradicalthought</a><br/>
<br/>
A RADICAL THOUGHT<br/>
<br/>
Never tell a child &quot;Go look it up.&quot; Parents, teachers, friends and  <br/>
countrymen, how would you like it?<br/>
<br/>
When a child wants to know why flowers have a scent, they want  <br/>
someone to say &quot;To attract bees&quot; not &quot;GO LOOK IT UP.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go look it up&quot; tends to mean &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I know but I&#39;m not  <br/>
going to tell you.&quot; What&#39;s the advantage of that?<br/>
<br/>
Either a child will opt NOT to look it up (and the trust in the  <br/>
parent will erode a little) or he will, under duress, perform this  <br/>
task which might be difficult for him, or might take so long that he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t care anymore (and the trust in the parent will erode a little).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT saying to discourage kids from looking things up. I never  <br/>
said not to show kids how to look things up. I mean don&#39;t treat it  <br/>
like something parents won&#39;t do, parents don&#39;t have to do, but that  <br/>
kids do, or that kids have to do, because they are powerless kids.<br/>
<br/>
Encyclopedias should be alluring, not forbidding. Dictionaries should  <br/>
be a playland, not a dark, scary place you dart into for one thing  <br/>
and slam shut behind you. If you believe they ARE fun, you should  <br/>
look things up in front of your children, often, and with enthusiasm.  <br/>
That will teach them how to use reference materials, and will make  <br/>
them want to do so, because they will see it as something useful and  <br/>
enjoyable that adults do. If you believe dictionaries and  <br/>
encyclopedias ARE dark, scary and forbidding, why on EARTH would you  <br/>
send your children there?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t make my kids look up information.  I have always happily<br/>
provided the answers to their questions.  They&#39;ve seen me look things<br/>
up, so they know how to do it for themselves.  My older daughter looks<br/>
things up for herself mostly, and my younger daughter relies on me or<br/>
her dad for answers.<br/>
<br/>
I put that link up because I found it really fascinating how she<br/>
describes the making of dictionaries.  After listening to that, I<br/>
started giving my kids definitions of words that they asked the meanings<br/>
of, from my own understanding, then I would look it up and see how it<br/>
compared and give them the dictionary definition as well.<br/>
<br/>
What she says is that when someone is involved in compiling words and<br/>
meanings, they come to their answers and understanding of words based on<br/>
how they&#39;ve been used in all kinds of sources.  So, in that sense, how I<br/>
understand the meaning of a word, is perfectly valid, and then I can<br/>
expand on it based on how others have come to understand a word.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it, my kids could get a prepared answer on their own from<br/>
a dictionary, or they can have a more holistic version from all the<br/>
people around them that influence their thinking.<br/>

I just wanted to say how lovely this is and that it brought tears to my eyes. I still feel uncomfortable about my lack of tables knowledge (especially in the 6,7&#39;s and 8&#39;s!) and adding up yet am a goodish speller.<br/>
<br/>
 I recently had a garage sale and I felt so much pressure just adding basic numbers up and giving change (especially when they were all lining up which was something I hadn&#39;t predicted would happen). It&#39;s something I&#39;ve had issues with ever since primary school and I think it comes from being labelled as &#39;fantastic at English, bad at maths&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
How lovely for you and Keith to come up with this lovely, lovely means of helping each other out. Out goes the shaming and with it, the boxing and labelling.<br/>
<br/>
What a perfect example for how it must feel for our children to be free from those labels and shaming and just be given (kindly and lovingly) the answers. <br/>

Reading that, Sandra. has really made my day !<br/>

  Encyclopedias should be alluring, not forbidding. Dictionaries should <br/>
  be a playland, not a dark, scary place you dart into for one thing <br/>
  and slam shut behind you. If you believe they ARE fun, you should <br/>
  look things up in front of your children, often, and with enthusiasm. <br/>
  That will teach them how to use reference materials, and will make <br/>
  them want to do so, because they will see it as something useful and <br/>

  encyclopedias ARE dark, scary and forbidding, why on EARTH would you <br/>
  send your children there?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201415030">This reminds me of something I used to do (up to about two days ago!).<br/>
<br/>
Every time the kids did something I wanted them to &quot;learn not to do&quot; <br/>
like leave their socks around, not pick up all the wrapper from <br/>
something they opened, etc. I would call which ever kid was <br/>
&quot;responsible&quot; (often after a heated &quot;who done it&quot; discussion) and ask <br/>
them to remedy their &quot;mistake&quot; or pick up after themselves. The day was <br/>
a constant string of my nagging them about minutia. I would even prevent <br/>
others from doing it for them, &quot;no! They&#39;ll never learn if you do it for <br/>
them.&quot; For some reason, I thought that this was a good method of <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; them to be responsible for their stuff. What have they <br/>
&quot;learned&quot; after 5 years? Nothing. Nada. (We&#39;ll except not to listen when <br/>
  I nag...). They still take socks and shoes off where ever and just <br/>
drop them. Cloths are found dropped where they stepped out of them. <br/>
Wrappers get left where ever something was opened, etc. (They actually <br/>
pick up after themselves quite a bit, but they just don&#39;t notice what <br/>
they are doing with clothes and shoes especially.)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d think I&#39;d have &quot;learned&quot;. This is not the way to &quot;teach&quot; the kids <br/>
anything (except that I&#39;m a nag).<br/>

game that was supposed to teach her &quot;reading skills&quot;. She likes it <br/>
because it&#39;s set in a spooky haunted house. One of the tasks involved <br/>
building sentences where the squares are labeled with the kind of word <br/>
(verb, subject, direct object, adverb, etc.). She kept saying, &quot;what&#39;s a <br/>
subject?&quot; and I tried explaining what kind of word they were looking <br/>
for. This frustrated her. &quot;No, is it &#39;turtles&#39; or &#39;ate&#39; or what?&quot; She <br/>
wanted me to &quot;give her the answer&quot; (my internal dialog). I finally <br/>
realized that telling her which of the choices would work in the game <br/>
would bring a lot more joy than my making her think about what kind of <br/>
words were &quot;subjects&quot; and figuring out which of the choices fit that <br/>
category. I squelched my pangs of &quot;she&#39;s missing the whole (educational) <br/>
point of the  game,&quot; but allowed myself to think (but not say), &quot;at <br/>
least she&#39;ll get something by osmosis.&quot; (I think of my thinking, &quot;at <br/>
least she&#39;s learning something,&quot; as unschooling training wheels. <br/>
Thoughts that slave my old fears/way of thinking that I expect to grow <br/>
out of as I become less newbie at this).<br/>

Am I on the right track?<br/>

No doubt.  Instead of explaining what kind of word, you could&#39;ve said  <br/>
&quot;Who&#39;s the star of the sentence&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s doing something or  <br/>
thinking something or being something?&quot;<br/>

In the past two days I&#39;ve had teens offer me food, offer to take my  <br/>
dirty dishes up to the kitchen, offer to get me something when they  <br/>
were going out...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was from other people on this list (or one or another that came  <br/>
before it) that I really let go of all my expectations about &quot;chores&quot;  <br/>
and getting help.  It works on the same principles as other aspects  <br/>
of unschooling and mindful parenting, though.  It has to do with  <br/>
choices and respect and generosity.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They&#39;ll never learn if you do it for<br/>
&gt; them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;ll learn. Not what you want them to learn, but they&#39;ll learn from  <br/>
your behavior. My husband had a hard time with this. He&#39;d see me  <br/>
picking up the kids&#39; shoes or other &quot;droppings&quot; and he&#39;d say, &quot;They  <br/>
should pick that up for themselves, you should be doing it for them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, you know what that made ME want to do? He would leave  <br/>
his teacup sitting next to his chair almost every evening and, in the  <br/>
past, I&#39;d picked it up in the morning and rinsed it and put it into  <br/>
the dishwasher. For years. He also often left a little bowl of  <br/>
sunflower seed shells and I&#39;d put those in the compost bucket and  <br/>
rinse the dish and put it into the dishwasher.<br/>
<br/>
When he bugged me a lot not to pick up after the kids - I stopped  <br/>
picking up after HIM! &lt;G&gt; There would sometimes be four or five  <br/>
teacups sitting there by his chair. Sometimes the dog would get into  <br/>
his sunflower seed shells and make a mess and I&#39;d leave that too. I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t doing this out of spite - but just somehow, without realizing  <br/>
it, I wasn&#39;t getting around to taking care of it. It hit me like a ton  <br/>
of bricks, one day, that I was doing this. So, I started cleaning up  <br/>
beside his chair again and, next time he said something about cleaning  <br/>
up after the kids I just said, &quot;You know - we all clean up after each  <br/>
other and I think that&#39;s nice. I clean up your stuff from beside your  <br/>
chair every morning and I&#39;m happy to do it. You empty the bathroom  <br/>
trash even though most of the trash in it isn&#39;t even yours, and I  <br/>
really appreciate that. I think we&#39;re fine - the kids are learning  <br/>
that we all help each other out, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He grumbled a  <br/>
little more - using the usual expressions - &quot;They need to learn we&#39;re  <br/>
not their servants,&quot; and stuff like that. But I let it slide because I  <br/>
know that he does that - he grumbles a little, but then he goes off  <br/>
and thinks about what I said and often it sinks in. He&#39;s logical, if  <br/>
it makes sense, he&#39;ll get it - I don&#39;t try to argue him into things  <br/>
(anymore).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the more we bug the kids to pick up their own stuff, the more  <br/>
focused they get on what&#39;s &quot;theirs&quot; and what isn&#39;t. Yesterday I asked  <br/>
Roxana if she&#39;d mind sweeping the bathroom floor - something had  <br/>
spilled. She said she&#39;d do it (I was leaving, she was staying home.)  <br/>
Later, I thanked her and she said something about not having even been  <br/>
in that bathroom for months and I suddenly realized - she doesn&#39;t even  <br/>
use that bathroom. But still she swept up for me, just to be nice. If  <br/>
I&#39;d been saying, &quot;Pick up your own shoes, I&#39;m not doing it for you,  <br/>
they&#39;re YOURS,&quot; to her, she&#39;d have said, &quot;Sweep your own bathroom, it  <br/>
is YOURS not MINE.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What do the kids learn when you force them to pick up their own stuff  <br/>
and refuse to do it for them? They learn to be ungenerous with their  <br/>
time, and unhelpful (with other people&#39;s stuff). They learn to be more  <br/>
selfish, not more responsible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432939064">Before I had kids I was pretty OCD about certain things being perfectly clean in my house. Then I had 3 kids ....one of them happens to be autistic, nonverbal and Oh does he love to make messes &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
   <br/>
  I spent the longest time felling so overwhelmed and felt I had to make my kids pitch in. They could at least get *their* stuff cleaned up ...I was having to clean so much. <br/>
  One day I realized that while I dont enjoy other people having negative opinions when they come to my trashy house my kids emotional well being was far more important. I also realized that to me having kids who remember a mom that ( insert fun activity here ) was far more important than letting myself get spazed out about a messy house. <br/>
   <br/>
  So I gave myself permission to let go , stopped demanding, and for a while didnt even ask my kids to do anything. I did things around my house that made life easier for me ..like the dishes cause Im not a friend of bugs :) but I took lots of deep breathed and learned to stop stressing about everything. <br/>
   <br/>
  Time went by where I was the only one doing any housework and I had to work hard to choose hapiness and not feel resentful. <br/>
   <br/>
  Then my kids did start doing things without being asked. Nate made a big mess in his room smearing stuff on the walls and in the carpet. I got in there and started shampooing the carpet and Alyssa came and asked if she could clean the walls. I got her a spray bottle then Courtney went and found another a few minutes later and started helping. She got tired of the walls and offered to run the shampooer so we switched for a while. <br/>
   <br/>
  Grandma is coming down tomorrow and yesterday Courtney asked if Id help her clean their room up. Their bikes , scooters and wagons have been out in the yard for a few days now. No one reminded them or asked them to but a few minutes ago when it started to rain they ran outside and pulled them all up under the porch real quick. <br/>
   <br/>
  Now their shoes? They still get left wherever and it was a pain when we had to take dad to work and didnt have time to search the house for shoes. I took on old pair for each kid and tossed them in the back of the van so if we needed them we&#39;d have shoes. <br/>

&gt; &gt; They&#39;ll learn. Not what you want them to learn, but they&#39;ll learn from<br/>

&gt; &gt; picking up the kids&#39; shoes or other &quot;droppings&quot; and he&#39;d say, &quot;They<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When he bugged me a lot not to pick up after the kids - I stopped<br/>
&gt; &gt; picking up after HIM! &lt;G&gt; There would sometimes be four or five<br/>
&gt; &gt; teacups sitting there by his chair. Sometimes the dog would get into<br/>
&gt; &gt; his sunflower seed shells and make a mess and I&#39;d leave that too. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t doing this out of spite - but just somehow, without realizing<br/>
&gt; &gt; it, I wasn&#39;t getting around to taking care of it. It hit me like a ton<br/>
&gt; &gt; of bricks, one day, that I was doing this. So, I started cleaning up<br/>
&gt; &gt; beside his chair again and, next time he said something about cleaning<br/>
&gt; &gt; up after the kids I just said, &quot;You know - we all clean up after each<br/>
&gt; &gt; other and I think that&#39;s nice. I clean up your stuff from beside your<br/>
&gt; &gt; chair every morning and I&#39;m happy to do it. You empty the bathroom<br/>
&gt; &gt; trash even though most of the trash in it isn&#39;t even yours, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; really appreciate that. I think we&#39;re fine - the kids are learning<br/>
&gt; &gt; that we all help each other out, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He grumbled a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little more - using the usual expressions - &quot;They need to learn we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; not their servants,&quot; and stuff like that. But I let it slide because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know that he does that - he grumbles a little, but then he goes off<br/>
&gt; &gt; and thinks about what I said and often it sinks in. He&#39;s logical, if<br/>
&gt; &gt; it makes sense, he&#39;ll get it - I don&#39;t try to argue him into things<br/>
&gt; &gt; (anymore).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, the more we bug the kids to pick up their own stuff, the more<br/>
&gt; &gt; focused they get on what&#39;s &quot;theirs&quot; and what isn&#39;t. Yesterday I asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; Roxana if she&#39;d mind sweeping the bathroom floor - something had<br/>
&gt; &gt; spilled. She said she&#39;d do it (I was leaving, she was staying home.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Later, I thanked her and she said something about not having even been<br/>
&gt; &gt; in that bathroom for months and I suddenly realized - she doesn&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; &gt; use that bathroom. But still she swept up for me, just to be nice. If<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d been saying, &quot;Pick up your own shoes, I&#39;m not doing it for you,<br/>

Funny thing.  Our house is finally *off* the market, we&#39;re moving out this<br/>
week, have to be out in 3 days. The house has gone from spotless (mommy<br/>
running around all day preparing it for showings, mumbling things under her<br/>
breath, stressed out for 4 weeks) to crazy messy, as everything we own has<br/>
spilled from the cupboards onto the floors, people are tripping over things,<br/>
hard to maneuver around.  My six year old said today &quot;AHH!  I hate a messy<br/>
house!&quot;  as she was trying to reach something in the kitchen.  I just said<br/>
&quot;me too&quot; and we smiled at each other.  We&#39;re in it together.  Not an us<br/>
against them thing.  They might not get it, the moment of explaining and<br/>
reasoning with them, but they get it in a practical way, if we (I) shut up<br/>
and let them.  Hope your house sells quickly and painlessly!<br/>

Lots more helpful is -- to first not be making them! ;-) -- but when  <br/>
they ask, share with them why *you* like it done but accept that your  <br/>

others might do it. Let the information go in and swirl around. Let  <br/>
them play with the idea or set it aside. But ideas can&#39;t swirl around  <br/>
if they&#39;re being used as a rope to bind them to your way. They can&#39;t  <br/>
decide what&#39;s important to them if they don&#39;t have the choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110238134"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; what IS the way to get them to pick up the socks?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Role-modeling!  I pick up after the kids without nagging them.  I even <br/>
ask their permission in some cases, like if I&#39;m doing laundry and I <br/>
need to collect clothes from their rooms that didn&#39;t get put into the <br/>
hampers.  I&#39;ll say, &quot;I&#39;m doing laundry and I&#39;m looking for dirty <br/>
clothes.  May I wash these?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My youngest daugher, Allison (10), has a habit of leaving her shoes <br/>
all over the living room and dining room.  She&#39;ll have 3 or 4 pairs <br/>
laying about that we trip over.  I usually pick them up for her but <br/>
sometimes I&#39;ll ask if she&#39;d like to help.  We keep all our shoes in a <br/>
hinged-chest near the door.  It&#39;s rather fun to toss the shoes across <br/>
the room into the box!  :)<br/>

mother...whatever I did, there was always something I could do better! I <br/>
noticed myself doing that with my kids awhile back. But even noticing I <br/>
couldn&#39;t always stop (though I tried, even before realizing that <br/>
unshcooling is what makes sense for us). But you guys aren&#39;t my mother <br/>
and I truly appreciate suggestions for how I can be better and better.<br/>
<br/>
It does help to have somewhere to talk about the process we&#39;re going <br/>
through, though. Just writing things out helps me see stuff I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have seen otherwise. Yesterday, I was with the youngest most of the <br/>
day--her siblings were overnighting at friends (today is the opposite). <br/>
We both felt a little down and bluesy (probably because we&#39;re both short <br/>
on sleep from the new &quot;no bedtime&quot; &lt;g&gt;). But there&#39;s also emotionally <br/>
upsetting stuff going on right now (or the ongoing upsetting situation <br/>
is in a &quot;flare up&quot;). I helped her find stuff to do but I just didn&#39;t <br/>
feel very fun to be around. We did the newspaper logs thing but my <br/>
attitude was more like it was a chore than a fun project.<br/>
<br/>
So my new level of understanding is that I first need to find stuff that <br/>
*I* enjoy doing and is fun for me that I can do with the kids. Not that <br/>
newspaper logs wouldn&#39;t be fun for me if I let them be fun but I wanted <br/>
to take it over and do what I wanted. And we were short on tape and <br/>
newspaper. So today I think I&#39;ll try to buy enough newspaper and tape so <br/>
that there&#39;s enough for me to play and enjoy the way I want and whatever <br/>
kid wants to join in can join in with mine or make their own or <br/>
something like. Making it all &quot;I&#39;ll help you with your project&quot; sapped <br/>
all the fun out of it for me yesterday and left her frustrated when what <br/>
she wanted to do didn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; (her word). The structure she chose to <br/>
build was wobbly and unstable and some of the joins tore apart from lack <br/>
of tape but my suggestions that she add tape, etc had been met with <br/>
resistance, so I kept them to a minimum--she wanted to &quot;do her own <br/>
thing&quot; so I just tried to be supportive (literally by holding up pieces <br/>
she was joining, etc.). We&#39;re still very much de-schooling and I&#39;m not <br/>
the most trustworthy yet (I&#39;m bossy and I lecture and I always know a <br/>
better way to do *everything*--at least that&#39;s the me they are used to). <br/>
So I suggested we put it up for later. I&#39;m hoping to get the chance to <br/>
make supplies more abundant, and maybe take it up again when there&#39;s <br/>
more kids around and see if I can&#39;t let *myself* have some fun.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I used to put that on my yearly goals: &quot;Learn to have fun.&quot; Never <br/>
did achieve it back then ;)<br/>

least ankle deep if not knee deep--he doesn&#39;t like not being able to <br/>
find things and that things get stepped on and broken, but he feels <br/>
emotionally more comfortable in disarray (probably because that&#39;s the <br/>
way its always been--not just in his room but in the whole house to some <br/>
degree--and that&#39;s the way the kids&#39; room was the last time he lived <br/>
with his mother).<br/>
<br/>
Not that long ago, he even claimed he preferred wearing dirty socks <br/>
(when we pointed out that if he just tossed them under the rubble they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get clean...) but more recently he&#39;s started complaining that <br/>
he has no clean socks. We bought him a new pack to go to camp with, but <br/>
only 3 pair came home. I honestly will have a hard time keeping him in <br/>
clean socks if I don&#39;t have some cooperation from him. (His cousin was <br/>
the worst, though, 6 months after he was no longer even living at our <br/>
house I&#39;d still find one of his socks every time a moved something in a <br/>
corner or under a chair! The boy must have actively thrown his socks in <br/>
random directions every time he took them off.) Maybe we&#39;ll just budget <br/>
a pack of socks for the boy every week or two until we&#39;re more balanced? <br/>
Otherwise he&#39;ll just have to tolerate wearing dirty socks (which I can&#39;t <br/>
stand myself, I hate dirty socks the most, I think).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270172249">-=-I helped her find stuff to do but I just didn&#39;t<br/>
feel very fun to be around. We did the newspaper logs thing but my<br/>
attitude was more like it was a chore than a fun project.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you think your attitude was negative enough that it created a bad  <br/>
memory?<br/>
<br/>
-=-So my new level of understanding is that I first need to find  <br/>
stuff that *I* enjoy doing and is fun for me that I can do with the  <br/>
kids.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Not that newspaper logs wouldn&#39;t be fun for me if I let them be  <br/>
fun but I wanted to take it over and do what I wanted. And we were  <br/>
short on tape and newspaper.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Baking a cake would be NO fun if you didn&#39;t have eggs and vanilla.   <br/>
Don&#39;t start a project if you don&#39;t have the stuff for it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So today I think I&#39;ll try to buy enough newspaper and tape so that  <br/>
there&#39;s enough for me to play and enjoy the way I want -=-<br/>
<br/>
Eeeeek.<br/>
<br/>
#1, why don&#39;t you wait for enough newspaper to build up naturally so  <br/>
that you&#39;re working with extra, scrap, abundance?<br/>
<br/>
#2, Do your kids want to do that?  It sounds all about you.  YOU to  <br/>
play and YOU to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-(I&#39;m bossy and I lecture and I always know a better way to do  <br/>
*everything*--at least that&#39;s the me they are used to). -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to get used to it to, but I&#39;d rather not! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Never did achieve it back then ;)-=-<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t now either.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t learn how to have fun.  They either have fun or they  <br/>
don&#39;t.  There might be some stuff between you and having fun. If you  <br/>
wanted to play in the water but you were wearing tights, socks,  <br/>
shoes, pants, underwear, two shirts and an undershirt and a hat, lots  <br/>
of jewelry, a jacket...  Would you need to learn to play in the  <br/>
water?  Or would you need to figure out to take all that stuff off  <br/>
and then just play?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re wrapped in layers and layers of negativity and excuses and  <br/>
rules and expectations that things will go wrong and be not fun.<br/>
<br/>

EVERY YEAR you spent not having fun is gone.  Don&#39;t let another day  <br/>
go by.<br/>

others&#39; homes more, but useful to point out.)<br/>

It may not specifically be the disarray he&#39;s attached to but to the  <br/>

see it in a different light.<br/>

bunch, I can do a load of laundry&quot; then throw them in with some other  <br/>
stuff that needs done. The more options he has, the easier it is to  <br/>
make useful choices.<br/>
<br/>
I think too often parents approach kid problems with the attitude of  <br/>
fixing the child to fix the problem. Rather than taking on  <br/>
responsibility of the problem yourself, give him ideas and help and  <br/>
support in finding solutions. But detach from the need to fix the  <br/>
problem.<br/>

Not that long ago, he even claimed he preferred wearing dirty socks<br/>
(when we pointed out that if he just tossed them under the rubble they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get clean...) <br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
I might prefer wearing dirty socks to having my stuff referred to as rubble. It helps, it really, really helps to find joy in the things your children do. <br/>
<br/>
Right now, in front of the television, there are a slew of oragami papers and markers and paper dolls and other bits and bobs from Linnaea crafting one or another thing. As I peer closer I can see a bird she made and drawings she&#39;s drawn and planes she designed as toys for the kittens. I will probably go over and tidy it up in a little bit, to keep the pieces safer from folks walking around and to make sure that there isn&#39;t food for the ants. It takes only a moment to turn what you describe as rubble into a series of activities, of joyous moments. They are still lifes waiting to be interpreted. I can see the shadow of her sitting there and doing and making and talking and turning to Simon to show him or running to fly the plane she made in the hallway to see if it would fly well enough to engage whichever kitten it was designed to amuse, or calling to me to come and interpret whichever fold the origami book was describing onto the paper she was folding.<br/>
 It isn&#39;t rubble, it is her life. <br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
I honestly will have a hard time keeping him in <br/>
clean socks if I don&#39;t have some cooperation from him.<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean? It&#39;s summer, right? It isn&#39;t much of a season for socks, clean or otherwise. Go buy tons of socks, find them on sale, don&#39;t worry about quality, get quantity. Put them near the washing machine and bring him pairs every time you wash his clothes. Fill his drawers with socks. Make him feel rich in socks. It won&#39;t cost a lot. It seems a very strange moan needing cooperation to keep him in socks. They are just socks. Just minutia. Just a small thing to make his life better and more comfortable. Not something to need cooperation to obtain. <br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
 (His cousin was <br/>
the worst, though, 6 months after he was no longer even living at our <br/>
house I&#39;d still find one of his socks every time a moved something in a <br/>
corner or under a chair! The boy must have actively thrown his socks in <br/>
random directions every time he took them off.)<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
Move all the furniture and see if there are still some socks around and wash them and offer them to this boy who lacks clean socks. What a wonderful way to remember this house guest, to picture him winging his socks around as he felt his toes freed. Maybe he hated his socks and it was such joy to get them off that he couldn&#39;t help but make them fly!<br/>
 <br/>
------------------<br/>
Maybe we&#39;ll just budget <br/>
a pack of socks for the boy every week or two until we&#39;re more balanced? <br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
Yes, good idea. I don&#39;t know what your balance has to do with it, but definitely if he needs more socks buy him more socks. <br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
Otherwise he&#39;ll just have to tolerate wearing dirty socks (which I can&#39;t <br/>
stand myself, I hate dirty socks the most, I think).<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
But he is different than you, right? So maybe it isn&#39;t that which he hates the most. Maybe dirty socks are kind of comfortable. Maybe finding two that match is exciting, or being cool and indifferent and wearing whatever was on the floor appeals. Maybe going barefoot is better. Maybe he likes shoes without socks sometimes. Maybe there is more between buying and tolerating. Maybe. <br/>

<br/>
this is so true.  <br/>
we have so many socks it is overwhelming *if* I let myself get caught<br/>
up in the idea of keep em all washed paired and sorted...<br/>
<br/>
we have 9 people of all sizes and lots of socks.  I really found it a<br/>
waste of energy to be always lecturing about pairing their socks after<br/>
they are worn to put them in the wash, about how they (who ever) never<br/>
remember where they left their socks...asking for help to sort them,<br/>
It is just not worth it. <br/>
<br/>
then we started just collecting all the socks possible.  I have way<br/>
too many (so says some) but on the other hand, I dont have to stress<br/>
that there arent enough paired clean socks to go round.<br/>
<br/>
how many socks do we have? a bushel full (and over flowing).  Really!<br/>
<br/>
just let those socks flow! And make sure that you dont get different<br/>
sized sock in similar colours.  Lorenzo dh found a bargain on organic<br/>
white socks once in 4 different sizes (we have friends in the<br/>
business) and those socks just sit there, never getting paired as it<br/>
is so difficult to sort them out by size shape (some are short some<br/>
long, some plain some with ribbing) and no colours.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a hanging 6 tiered basket (ikea) that I hung up near my laundry<br/>
area. As the clean socks come in (sometimes already paired)from drying<br/>
in the sun, they get tossed in the bushel basket. As we find a pair,<br/>
we toss into the tiers (Lidia lucia and I share our socks, as do Raff<br/>
and Matteo so 6 is perfect). <br/>

My wife and I have similar-looking plain white short socks we wear under<br/>
athletic shoes.  They&#39;re almost the same size, but mine are larger.  To keep<br/>
them separate and avoid the frustration of her smaller socks ending up in<br/>
*my* sock drawer, I just used Sharpie (permanent) markers to put<br/>
different-colored marks on the sole/toe area and make it easier to sort<br/>
them.  Sharpie markers are available in about a dozen colors in the<br/>
USA...not sure about other parts of the globe.  <br/>
