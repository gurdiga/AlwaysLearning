<div id="ygrps-yiv-210771878">My son and I were talking today about fear. What we each fear. And what&#39;s a <br/>
&quot;natural&quot; fear. What&#39;s self-imposed. What causes fear?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the two &quot;natural fears &quot; we came up with were falling and the <br/>
unknown. Fears other than that we figured were self-imposed or caused.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of people/children with a fear of dogs, spiders, bugs, snakes <br/>
(my mother-in-law&#39;s---maybe we should get one! &lt;g&gt;), closed spaces, heights <br/>
(or is this falling?), darkness.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of anything I&#39;m really afraid of. Falling scares me a bit <br/>
(that&#39;s why the top half of the house is still unpainted!)---but the plan is <br/>
to have the house painted before October---and I&#39;ll be doing it. I have an <br/>
irrational fear of public schools---in fact, I&#39;ve never set foot in a public <br/>
school classroom---literally---NEVER! But now that we&#39;ve learned so much <br/>
about them and chosen unschooling, I guess the &quot;fear&quot; is hardly irrational! &lt;<br/>
g&gt; Seems justifiable!<br/>
<br/>
Do y&#39;all have any fears? Were thay caused by anything (being knocked down by <br/>
a Great Dane when you were two?)? Why are snakes so fear-inducing? <br/>
<br/>
Do ya&#39;ll have anything to add to our conversation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217904278">I&#39;ve heard that heights and the dark are the two &quot;natural&quot; fears. I have<br/>
vertigo with heights, but I chip away at it a little at a time. Last week I<br/>
went rock-climbing on a rock wall at ds&#39;s birthday party; I just didn&#39;t look<br/>
down!<br/>
<br/>
My niece and nephews are all terrified of dogs, and my sister (their mom)<br/>
has always been afraid ever since one jumped on her when she was little. I<br/>
have to wonder how much of that was communicated; she&#39;s no longer afraid,<br/>
but she is cautious and I think the body language comes across. I knew my<br/>
kids would be around animals of all kinds, so I started early telling them<br/>
about dogs&#39; communication and exposing them to different breeds and sizes.<br/>
They&#39;re both as easy around animals as I am.<br/>

enough for me!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t actually have a snake fear, but I can just look at them and know why <br/>
others would have.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid of breaking down far from home and having more kids with me than I <br/>
can take care of and keep safe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid of falling asleep while I&#39;m driving.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think those are the same kinds of fears you mean, though, but I do <br/>
think of them more often than it seems I should.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid of dying while I&#39;m out of town, so I usually have a whole day <br/>
before each out-of-town trip dedicated to doing little oddments of stuff that <br/>
I&#39;d be really embarrassed to be caught not having done if I don&#39;t make it <br/>
back after the weekend or whatever.   I realize I could die going to the <br/>
grocery store near my house, but the fear has more to do with going a <br/>
thousand miles away (or even 300) and never coming back.<br/>
<br/>
As I get older I&#39;m more afraid of falling down.  I&#39;ve fallen three times <br/>
since we&#39;ve moved to this house.  I do NOT like to see the world spin by.  <br/>
This one is based on having broken my leg bigtime, in the mountains, in the <br/>
dark, in 1985, and being afraid of being similarly in pain and laid up.  Now <br/>
that my kids are older the fear is fading (they can wipe their own butts and <br/>
do their own laundry, although none is driving yet), but it&#39;s being replaced <br/>
by my age coming on and my fear of slower healing.    So I&#39;m cautious about <br/>
walking on ice, about running, climbing, walking in the dark, etc.<br/>

told me how to deal with them when we were going to be going into <br/>
rattlesnake country.  After that I used to have horrible nightmares about <br/>
them.  I&#39;d see one on the trail ahead of me, so I&#39;d turn back and there&#39;d <br/>
be one behind me.  I&#39;d keep turning until I was surrounded by coiled, <br/>
rattling rattlers, then try to jump out of the circle.  I&#39;d wake up doing <br/>
that, but then I&#39;d half believe that there was one at the foot of my <br/>
bed.  I&#39;d know it wasn&#39;t really there, but I still wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>
extend my feet down to the end of the bed.  I didn&#39;t manage to lose *most* <br/>
of that fear until I had grown up and moved to a place where there are no <br/>
poisonous snakes.  Even then, I had to de-sensitize myself gradually, by <br/>
making myself look at pictures and then touch the pictures.  Then I could <br/>
touch a snake at the science museum.  Then one day, I was with a group of <br/>
adults and kids who had spotted an injured snake on the lawn.  We figured <br/>
it had been injured by a lawn mower.  I was the only one willing to pick it <br/>
up and move it to a safer spot, and I was *so* proud of myself.  I still <br/>
startle when I see one, but only briefly.<br/>

but I hadn&#39;t skated much in years and was trying to skate on figure <br/>
skates.  I landed on my knee and shoulder, and neither hurt a lot at <br/>
first.  But the shoulder was really painful the next day, and it took *2 <br/>
years* before the pain completely went away.  You bet I don&#39;t skate <br/>
anymore.  Between the slower healing at my age and the extra weight I&#39;m <br/>
carrying, I&#39;ve gotten very cautious about falling.<br/>

developed more of a fear of this as I&#39;ve gotten older.  I used to be <br/>
scared of spiders, but I married a completely phobic man and <br/>
have a phobic child and that has made me pretty immune to <br/>
squeamish attacks.  After all someone has to get the spiders out <br/>
of the bath!  Rattlesnakes are the only fear inducing snakes for <br/>
me. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Fear is how evolution keeps you alive long enough to reproduce. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I think reproducing causes more fears to surface.<br/>
For me anyway....I always envision horrible things happening everytime I have <br/>
a baby. It subsides somewhat as they get older, but it&#39;s always there.<br/>
One of the irrational fears that plays through my head more than it should, <br/>
is a fear of the car crashing into water.  There is just no way I could get <br/>
all the kids out and save all of us. Maybe it&#39;s living near water and driving <br/>
over bridges all the time?<br/>
I think about it too much.<br/>
Another very reasonable fear I have is sharks.<br/>
Never did until the Jesse Arbogast incident. It did something to me, to see <br/>
the news coverage at MY beach and to drive past the hospital he was in every <br/>
day (three blocks from our house).<br/>
The timing was bad, I was just starting to train for triathlons. Jesse&#39;s <br/>
uncle is a triathlete (I watched the competition he was in last summer) and <br/>
so was another man that got attacked in summer 2000 not far from this beach.<br/>
Ugh.<br/>
The only two serious attacks in 100 years, both triathletes? Makes me feel <br/>
really good about training in open water. yk?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478236741">I&#39;m not so sure that falling and the unknown are the anly natural fears. I<br/>
used to have this creepy feeling going into the basement that there was<br/>
someone behind me. (It was a finished basement so it wasn&#39;t dungeon like<br/>
though it was dark.) It continued right into college.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have it any more so I&#39;d be real surprised if I passed it on, but<br/>
Kathryn (10) only occasionally will go upstairs or down alone. Sometimes the<br/>
dog is enough. Sometimes she needs another person with her. (Rather oddly if<br/>
she can&#39;t get back to sleep in the middle of the night, she will go<br/>
downstairs to watch TV. But if we go upstairs to bed in the evening, she<br/>
won&#39;t stay downstairs by herself.)<br/>
<br/>
So that sounds like it might have a genetic component.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Kathryn likes bugs in general and even likes spiders when<br/>
they&#39;re safe in a jar, she gets very nervous when they&#39;re loose and says<br/>
it&#39;s just the way they move that creeps her out. As far as I know, she<br/>
didn&#39;t have any bad experiences with spiders. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great<br/>
stretch to see a genetic predisposition to avoiding things that move in<br/>
certain ways.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any coping strategies for fears? Kathryn has a great fear<br/>
of lightning striking the house. She came to appreciate spiders after<br/>
reading a couple of books but lightning is one of those things where<br/>
learning more about it only confirms that you have something to be nervous<br/>
about! ;-) Anyone have ways of helping kids deal with the fears?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d always been curious how creatures know that great big creatures like<br/>
cows aren&#39;t a threat. One day I was sitting at our campsite reading when a<br/>
groundhog popped up and began nibbling in the grass. I noticed that when I<br/>
stared at the groundhog it would scurry back into the burrow. When I read,<br/>
it would venture out. I wonder how much of that is learned and how much is<br/>
hardwired. I know cats don&#39;t mind being stared at but it makes dogs nervous.<br/>
I can see wolves learning that social convention from pack behavior but why<br/>
would dogs keep passing that on if it was entirely taught? There doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem a reason for it in pet dogs. So it sounds suspiciously genetic.<br/>

My dog&#39;s always guilty of something.  Drinking my coffee, sneaking cat<br/>
food, stealing sandwiches, sleeping in the kitchen sink.    If I stare at<br/>
her she will first hang her head, then begin to scream, and eventually<br/>
fall over and show me her belly.   I think that&#39;s a &quot;How&#39;d you know?...<br/>
Yes, I did it....How can you be mad when I&#39;m so cute?&quot; <br/>
Just like people, dogs wonder what you&#39;re thinking if you stare at them. <br/>
They wonder what you know.   <br/>
In a thousand years I expect they&#39;ll have religion.   Cat already have<br/>
it.  They worship themselves.  That&#39;s why they don&#39;t care if you stare.<br/>

&quot;afraid&quot; of your staring at them. A dog sees you either as alpha-dog or a <br/>
threat or a bug to be crushed. It IS genetic (and possibly fine-tuned by mama <br/>
and siblings and other pooches he meets along the way). <br/>

I think humans are very handicapped in the dark because sight is our best <br/>
sense, and that&#39;s why people commonly have dogs around--either pets, or <br/>
natural symbiotic neighbors who come to eat human-food scraps, and stick <br/>
around for the possibility of more food.  But dogs having scent and hearing <br/>
as their strong senses, and NOT being good visually, dogs will bark, and <br/>
people will get up and grab a tool or weapon and look, and so the two species <br/>
have been found in relationship to one another since cave-days.<br/>
<br/>
Other animals can serve that purpose too--alerting people if there are <br/>
strange people or animals outside the house.  Geese.  Horses.<br/>

I don&#39;t understand cats, so I can&#39;t guess.  We have three.  You can walk <br/>
right up to them and touch them if they&#39;re asleep.  Mabye it&#39;s because we&#39;re <br/>

standards, mostly-awake anyway.<br/>

How could dogs pass it on without a pack anyway?   They might have few to no <br/>
examples of older dogs to watch.   I think it&#39;s innate.<br/>

I can see wolves learning that social convention from pack behavior but why<br/>
would dogs keep passing that on if it was entirely taught? There doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem a reason for it in pet dogs. So it sounds suspiciously genetic.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Mother dogs teach this to puppies, who then practice it with each other in<br/>
the litter, and dogs who then meet other dogs reinforce it. It&#39;s still a<br/>
useful social skill among dogs when sorting out pecking order, etc., so I&#39;d<br/>
argue environment and upbringing on this one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had dogs (notably Pugs, who are about as far removed from wolves/wild<br/>
canid ancestors as you can get &lt;g&gt;) who had no objection at all to being<br/>
stared at. I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying it with an Alaskan Malamute.<br/>
<br/>
For the humans :), I&#39;d agree that fear of being left alone (we&#39;re pack<br/>
animals, too) and fear of things that could poison us (spiders, snakes) make<br/>
sense.<br/>

Guilt.<br/>
My dog&#39;s always guilty of something.  Drinking my coffee, sneaking cat<br/>
food, stealing sandwiches, sleeping in the kitchen sink.    If I stare at<br/>
her she will first hang her head, then begin to scream, and eventually<br/>
fall over and show me her belly.   I think that&#39;s a &quot;How&#39;d you know?...<br/>
Yes, I did it....How can you be mad when I&#39;m so cute?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You may be totally kidding throughout, in which case let me apologize for<br/>
coming on serious dog trainer at you &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Hanging head, vocal shrillness and belly showing are all submissive<br/>
behaviors, in escalating order. She&#39;s telling you you&#39;re top dog when she<br/>
hangs her head and breaks eye contact. When you don&#39;t seem to get that, she<br/>
tries to sound like a puppy. When that fails, she rolls over and says, &quot;See?<br/>
I&#39;m just a baby puppy. Please don&#39;t kill me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Submissive urination is next, so watch how you tease the dog. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Rabbits don&#39;t stay with their young, and will not return them to the nest if<br/>
they wander out of it (they don&#39;t have a &quot;carry the baby&quot; instinct like dogs<br/>
or cats).<br/>
<br/>
Rabbit moms leave the babies (albeit, together if there&#39;s more than one and<br/>
usually there is) and visit them only once or twice in 24 hours to feed and<br/>
clean them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599396376">Reading this thread, I was thinking that most of my fears tend to be<br/>
things I am afraid to experience.  Off of the top of my head, I can<br/>
think of four things I feared and survived:  childbirth, root canal,<br/>
divorce and jury duty<br/>
<br/>
None of them were anything like what I had feared.  Labor I found more<br/>
annoying than painful.  The root canal was pain free.  The divorce was<br/>
one of the friendliest I&#39;ve ever heard of.  And four and a half weeks of<br/>
jury duty (which just ended yesterday) were an enriching and<br/>
enlightening experience.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe I just fear the unknown.<br/>
