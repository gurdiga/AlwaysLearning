1746 - Jacobite memoir  <br/>
<br/>
 Bonnie Prince Charlie&#39;s attempt to win back the crown for the Stuarts is one<br/>
of the<br/>
 most famous episodes in British history. This eye-witness account of his<br/>
defeat at<br/>
 Culloden is written on a pack of playing cards. It describes the battle and<br/>
the<br/>
 Prince&#39;s ensuing flight through the Highlands and Islands with government<br/>
forces<br/>
 hot on his heels.<br/>
<br/>
 The author of the memoir was an Irish Jacobite officer, Captain Felix O&#39;Neil.<br/>
He took<br/>
 part in the Battle of Culloden and then accompanied the Prince until Flora<br/>
MacDonald<br/>
 was able to spirit the fugitive to safety. Perhaps playing cards were the<br/>
only paper<br/>
 he had to hand at the time.<br/>
