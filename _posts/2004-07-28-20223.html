<div id="ygrps-yiv-325672059">Some background:<br/>
We&#39;ve always unschooled, at least as I understood it at the time. Except <br/>
for the one foray into insisting Lars do phonics to learn to read when he <br/>
was 12, and one period when he wanted to go to school and I insisted on <br/>
&quot;playing school&quot; for a couple of months so he&#39;d know what he was getting <br/>
into, his learning has all been his choice. He&#39;s never chosen much that <br/>
would be considered academic, but I&#39;ve been fine with that, seeing that <br/>
learning was happening even if it didn&#39;t look like school learning.<br/>
<br/>
Since he was 7, he&#39;s been signed up with one of the public school distance <br/>
learning programs here in BC. The first 2 years, they just left us <br/>
completely alone, helping only if asked. Then the government wanted &quot;proof&quot; <br/>
that learning was taking place, and we had to send them info on what our <br/>
kids were doing. That was still fine. I wrote anecdotal reports of some of <br/>
the stuff we did, and they were happy with it. I kept Lars right out of <br/>
that process, never showing him the &quot;report cards&quot; the government insisted <br/>
they send us, and not asking him to do anything specific to please &quot;them&quot;. <br/>
Two years ago the government wanted more, and after one year of &quot;more&quot; <br/>
(with me still shielding him from the process)we got out and into a much <br/>
more flexible program run by a private unschooling type school. For this <br/>
program we just had to log 25 hours a week of learning, and *anything* counted.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was great and was planning to go with the same program for the <br/>
coming year. (The plus is $1,000 to spend on almost anything remotely <br/>
educational. We got him a new computer last year.) Now he&#39;s just asked me <br/>
if he was going to be doing the same program this year. I told him there <br/>
was some question this last week about whether the school was going to <br/>
allowed to offer the program to high school aged students again this year <br/>
because the government figures they should be offering a diploma, with all <br/>
the huge changes to the program that would require. He asked me what would <br/>
be wrong with that, because he &quot;hardly did anything last year&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the only reason he did anything academic last year was <br/>
because he &quot;had to&quot;. I never told him to do academic things. I just asked <br/>
him every day what he *had* done and wrote it down. We counted all his bike <br/>
riding, all his sports, any movies he watched, anything he read, <br/>
conversations we had. I really wanted him to see that he was learning all <br/>
the time and didn&#39;t need to worry about  &quot;doing stuff&quot; as he calls academic <br/>
learning. At one point I asked him to see if he could think of some <br/>
different things that he was doing anyway that he could write down. It was <br/>
more an exercise in seeing the learning happening, at least that&#39;s what I <br/>
thought at the time.  He did actually do a bunch of academic stuff through <br/>
the year, but I thought it was because he was thinking ahead and wanted to <br/>
be able to get into whatever program he might want to enter in terms of <br/>
career. (I was thinking trades training, since he had shown so little <br/>
interest in any kind of book learning over the years.)<br/>
<br/>
Now it seems that he doesn&#39;t believe he&#39;ll do anything without being made <br/>
to. I tried to point out how hard he works on all his sports stuff, because <br/>
he wants to, and that I assume he&#39;ll do academic stuff when he wants to <br/>
learn something (or needs a certain amount of math or reading and writing <br/>
ability to get into some program). He still doesn&#39;t believe that the <br/>
motivation can come from within. He clearly doesn&#39;t see unschooling the way <br/>
I do, and I don&#39;t know how to help him understand it. I&#39;m not sure where to <br/>
go from here. Any thoughts?<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Tia --<br/>
<br/>
Do you suppose Lars doesn&#39;t share your faith that he *can* do academics, if he needs them?  Does he assume that it will be horrendously difficult and take years?<br/>
<br/>
That may explain why he&#39;s more worried than you are.  I have to say that I read the John Holt claims that all school mathematics could be learned in three (?) months and the first several times I read that, I didn&#39;t believe it.  (I spent years doing math homework and figured that it was building my brain somehow.)  Over time I came to believe that what Holt claimed was possible was possible, but I denied it at first.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a developmental stage when kids get skeptical about everything that their moms have to say.  For me, when my mom told me that I wasn&#39;t fat as a teen (weighing 140), I just shook my head and figured she had to say really blind, dorky things because she was my mother.  I knew she was not objective, and I figured she was also hopelessly out of touch.<br/>
<br/>
You and I understand, from experience and lengthy discussions that learning something &quot;in context&quot; is different from learning it out of context.  (Especially for those of us who like illustrative examples.)  I realize you can&#39;t really &quot;manuever&quot; him, but IF he ended up in situations with the potential for on the job learning, he would probably learn a lot.<br/>
<br/>
(Manuevering him would be a bad idea.  At his age, I think it&#39;d piss him off.  It would p-o me!)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have been listening to books on tape recently, while quilting and while doing housework.  I&#39;m enjoying it.  I don&#39;t know if Lars would like it at all, but if he did, I would recommend some books about different learning styles.  The last one I read (which I only read parts of) was _The Myth of Laziness_, by Mel Levine.  (It&#39;s written by a man, not a mom, and he&#39;s a doctor, so maybe &lt;g&gt; Lars would find him credible.)  It&#39;s very accepting of the idea that there are learning differences.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming to accept that my kid doesn&#39;t love books the way I do (except read aloud) but he learns a lot from television.  I do tend to believe that Nova is more educational than Ed, Edd and Eddy, but I see some value in even the shrillest cartoons.  A locally produced PBS show, called Real Science (I think) has young teens interviewing different scientists about careers, so it&#39;s the TV show that comes to mind when I think about TV as a form of &quot;career education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Have you even seen any of the Standard Deviants videos?  They don&#39;t substitute for a whole semesters course in anything, but they give a fast familiarity with the terminology in a &quot;subject&quot; and maybe take the fear and mystery out of something like Trigonometry or Geology.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend seeing Farenheit 911 for anyone who is a budding filmmaker, just to analyze it and see what makes it powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Overtime, now that we have the technology, pictures and moving pictures will replace words on the page as how we communicate.  Lars&#39; is just ahead of his time.  (But his time is rapidly arriving.)<br/>

go from here. Any  thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I know that my son Will doesn&#39;t see all the nuances of unschooling.   He&#39;s <br/>
too young yet (10)to have any goals other than being a pro baseball player  <br/>
(which he works towards every day). I recently signed him up for Which Way  USA? <br/>
books from Highlights.  We&#39;ve had the Mathmania and Puzzlemania books  come <br/>
before and the mystery ones about a country which I can&#39;t remember the name  of <br/>
right now.  He did the mystery ones for a while, with my help, when he  could <br/>
barely read, but never even looked at the others.  (I&#39;m keeping them  for <br/>
later.)  We got our first two Which Ways last week and he dove right  into the one <br/>
about New York.  It was really exciting for him because he  knows we&#39;re going <br/>
there before the L&L conference and he loves the  Yankees.<br/>
 <br/>
But...this is where I know he&#39;s not getting what all unschooling can really  <br/>
mean for him.  He came to me and was hugging the New York book to his  chest.  <br/>
(He really loves doing those books.)  He said, &quot;You know how  kids in school <br/>
study geography?  I think that&#39;s what they call it.   This could be MY <br/>
geography book.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I smiled my agreement and I said, &quot;There is a lot about geography in  those <br/>
books.&quot;  Then he said something that made me sad.  He said, &quot;I  just want to be <br/>
smart, and so I&#39;d like this to be my geography.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Will, you ARE smart.  You know many things that kids in  school <br/>
don&#39;t know and never have a chance to learn.&quot;  I explained about how  school <br/>
divides things into subjects like geography and history and social  studies.  But <br/>
that life is not really like that, that everything&#39;s mixed up  together and <br/>
they teach that way in schools to make it easier to test the kids,  and that&#39;s <br/>
why we get the idea that what&#39;s in the book is what is the most  important thing <br/>
to know, because that&#39;s what will be on the test.  <br/>
 <br/>
And I said, &quot;There&#39;s geography all around in lots of the things  you do.  <br/>
Think about how much you know about different cities and states  just because you <br/>
know about their baseball teams.&quot;  Well, that just lit him  up in a way I <br/>
rarely see, so I went on, &quot;You can learn so many things that kids  learn in <br/>
school just by learning about MLB:  math, geography, history...and  you could write <br/>
about it, too.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
On another day after that we were in the car and the New York book was with  <br/>
us, and we got to talk some more about how much is to be gained  from books <br/>
and how much is to be gained in the experiences that we&#39;ve had,  and he&#39;s lucky <br/>
to be able to do both.  We&#39;re going to be gone for 3 weeks  on our way to and <br/>
from the conference and there&#39;s no way we could get all that  experience from <br/>
books.  We talked about connections we make and how he can  relate almost <br/>
everything in his life back to baseball, and probably always will  be able to.  <br/>
 <br/>
I need to tell him about hooks and his &quot;model of the universe&quot;, too.   One <br/>
thing I&#39;ve thought of doing is hanging a fish net on the wall and putting  stuff <br/>
up there that remind us of connections we&#39;ve made.  (I saw an  artpiece like <br/>
that in a movie --&quot;Man of the House&quot;, I think--and I&#39;ve thought of  doing that <br/>
ever since.)  We made a giant map of the trip to the conference  and we&#39;ve <br/>
been making connections like crazy since we started it in  May.  These kinds of <br/>
visual aids help me and I think they help him by  extension.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, I&#39;m having a similar thing going on that you&#39;re having with Lars.   Will <br/>
is getting it bit by bit, and he readily defends the idea that everyone  <br/>
should have a choice about what goes in their head.  But he doesn&#39;t  see how to <br/>
extrapolate that to the rest of his life, and I think he just doesn&#39;t  have <br/>
enough experience, yet.  He has zero school experience so he doesn&#39;t  have anything <br/>
to hook that to, and he is getting the wrong ideas about it,  anyway.  I try <br/>
to correct those, or at least put them in perspective of the  unschooling <br/>
life.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think Will&#39;s too young at this point to be interested in what&#39;s going on  <br/>
with older unschoolers.  No context, I think.  One of his favorite  unschooled <br/>
teens is starting high school in 2 weeks just so he can play  football.  Max <br/>
is 15 and had to cut his middle-of-the-back hair to be on  the team.  Will is <br/>
impressed with that commitment, and he totally gets the  desire to play sports. <br/>
 But I don&#39;t think he gets what Max had to go  through to make the test score <br/>
to be put in the grade he wanted to be in.   And I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll get it <br/>
for some time.  There&#39;s just no  context.<br/>
 <br/>
When it comes up again like it has lately (&quot;geography&quot;), I&#39;ll just keep  <br/>
telling him what I think, and expand and expound on that as he gets more  <br/>
experience, and give him more hooks for his net.  And then we&#39;ll do some  reading <br/>
about what older unschoolers do, too.<br/>
 <br/>

of watching Zoe do so many academic looking things and then his closest<br/>

so smart, and funny, and learns so much all the time, but he&#39;s still<br/>
struggling with reading and that&#39;s wearing away at him a little. When I<br/>

Poor guys!  <br/>
<br/>
A kid his age in school would have some ratty notebooks and old tests and <br/>
writing assignments (unless he threw every bit of it away), and a 4th grade <br/>
report card with some grades (maybe really bad ones).   And a whole lot of <br/>
lack-of-freedom.  That would be his &quot;life.&quot;<br/>

Aww...My 19 yo said something similar like that to me once.<br/>
 <br/>
I kept an old bird cage, smallish, sitting around and I always left the  door <br/>
open.  One day Jon (then about 16) and I had a nice long conversation  about <br/>
how I went from just opening the door on the cage for him (getting him out  of <br/>
school in 6th grade) to realizing that the very cage was just an illusion  <br/>
(total freedom and autonomy).  We talked about how whenever he felt like he  was <br/>
backed up against a wall, that he should just imagine it melting away under  <br/>
him and realize the cage was totally gone and had been for some time.<br/>
 <br/>
It was a profound moment for him and he did say his thanks.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.<br/>
More background. Lars has no homeschooling friends anymore. All his friends <br/>
go to school. He&#39;s met them through his sports activities. He hears them <br/>
talk about what they have to do and learn in school, and he seems to feel <br/>
he could never do any of it, or at least not &quot;in time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That may explain why he&#39;s more worried than you are.  I have to say that I <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always believed it in my head. My gut is another matter. Math was a <br/>
huge obstacle for me, and I still haven&#39;t gotten past that. I&#39;ve tried to <br/>
mostly stay out of it with Lars because my explanations of things never <br/>
seem to make sense to him. Rod seems to be able to help him better than I <br/>
can, but his work keeps him too busy to do much of it. I found a website <br/>
that seemed to be working for him. It goes through the basics of arithmetic <br/>
with an emphasis on understanding and mental math. He did a bunch of it, <br/>
even taking some time off from it to learn the multiplication tables. But <br/>
he works in spurts and then has to go back quite a ways when he starts <br/>
again after some time off.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t seem at all interested in a profession that would require <br/>
&quot;higher math&quot;, but the trades courses in the colleges here usually require <br/>
grade 10, 11, or 12 math, depending on the course. My feeling is that he <br/>
could learn the stuff he needs quite quickly *if* he really wanted to. So I <br/>
tend to think he just isn&#39;t interested and leave it at that. But if he <br/>
thinks he can&#39;t . . . I&#39;m not sure what to do about that.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help at all that his girlfriend of the past year is a straight A <br/>
student who does very well in math. And no, he would never consider getting <br/>
her to tutor him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh absolutely. His dad and I are from the stone age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You and I understand, from experience and lengthy discussions that <br/>
&gt;learning something &quot;in context&quot; is different from learning it out of <br/>
&gt;context.  (Especially for those of us who like illustrative examples.)  I <br/>
&gt;realize you can&#39;t really &quot;manuever&quot; him, but IF he ended up in situations <br/>
&gt;with the potential for on the job learning, he would probably learn a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The job he&#39;s been doing has given him a lot of knowledge about forestry, <br/>
which he doesn&#39;t want to do for a living. &lt;g&gt; His volunteer work, helping <br/>
sometimes at the bike store, has shown him that he&#39;d need to improve his <br/>
writing and probably arithmetic skills in order to do that kind of work. <br/>
He&#39;s fine with assembling and repairing bicycles. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(Manuevering him would be a bad idea.  At his age, I think it&#39;d piss him <br/>
&gt;off.  It would p-o me!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t go there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Personally, I have been listening to books on tape recently, while <br/>
&gt;quilting and while doing housework.  I&#39;m enjoying it.  I don&#39;t know if <br/>
&gt;Lars would like it at all, but if he did, I would recommend some books <br/>
&gt;about different learning styles.  The last one I read (which I only read <br/>
&gt;parts of) was _The Myth of Laziness_, by Mel Levine.  (It&#39;s written by a <br/>
&gt;man, not a mom, and he&#39;s a doctor, so maybe &lt;g&gt; Lars would find him <br/>
&gt;credible.)  It&#39;s very accepting of the idea that there are learning <br/>
&gt;differences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a thought. He isn&#39;t interested in listening to fiction on tape. I <br/>
tried that. He used to love being read to or listening to fiction on tape. <br/>
That all stopped when I coerced him into learning to read . . . sigh. I <br/>
think one trouble with listening to tapes is that he doesn&#39;t like just <br/>
sitting and listening. And if he&#39;s doing something, it&#39;s probably riding <br/>
his bike or something. I&#39;ll ask him though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m coming to accept that my kid doesn&#39;t love books the way I do (except <br/>
&gt;read aloud) but he learns a lot from television.  I do tend to believe <br/>
&gt;that Nova is more educational than Ed, Edd and Eddy, but I see some value <br/>
&gt;in even the shrillest cartoons.  A locally produced PBS show, called Real <br/>
&gt;Science (I think) has young teens interviewing different scientists about <br/>
&gt;careers, so it&#39;s the TV show that comes to mind when I think about TV as a <br/>
&gt;form of &quot;career education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve definitely gotten over my distrust of TV. &lt;g&gt; *I* know that he learns <br/>
lots from watching, but I don&#39;t think he knows. Also, he tends to watch <br/>
when he can&#39;t think of anything to do, so he thinks of it as a boredom <br/>
buster rather than something interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Have you even seen any of the Standard Deviants videos?  They don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;substitute for a whole semesters course in anything, but they give a fast <br/>
&gt;familiarity with the terminology in a &quot;subject&quot; and maybe take the fear <br/>
&gt;and mystery out of something like Trigonometry or Geology.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They sound good, but I just checked the library. They have a bunch of <br/>
Spanish and French, and one biology. I&#39;ll order that one for him. Ah, the <br/>
other library system I use has one about mythology, including LOTR. I&#39;ve <br/>
ordered that one too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would recommend seeing Farenheit 911 for anyone who is a budding <br/>
&gt;filmmaker, just to analyze it and see what makes it powerful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s seen it. I don&#39;t really know if he&#39;s looking at feature type films <br/>
with editing in mind. I know he&#39;s not interested in making fictional films, <br/>
and so far the only non-fiction type film he&#39;s shown an interest in making <br/>
is biking videos.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I even wonder how interested he really is in film. I understood <br/>
when it took him ages to decide what he wanted in a computer, in terms of <br/>
being able to do editing. But he&#39;s had the computer, the camera, the right <br/>
cables, and some film for several months now and hasn&#39;t done much. He keeps <br/>
saying he needs to get more footage in order to edit, but he doesn&#39;t go out <br/>
and get footage. I never know whether to just leave it or keep asking if he <br/>
needs anything else, any help, etc.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Overtime, now that we have the technology, pictures and moving pictures <br/>
&gt;will replace words on the page as how we communicate.  Lars&#39; is just ahead <br/>
&gt;of his time.  (But his time is rapidly arriving.)<br/>
<br/>

me. (This goes back 52 years!) I called it my &quot;homework&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I said, &quot;Will, you ARE smart.  You know many things that kids in  school<br/>

&gt;that life is not really like that, that everything&#39;s mixed up  together and<br/>
&gt;they teach that way in schools to make it easier to test the kids,  and <br/>
&gt;that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;why we get the idea that what&#39;s in the book is what is the most  important <br/>
&gt;thing<br/>
&gt;to know, because that&#39;s what will be on the test.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it really hard to give him answers when he asks, &quot;*What* do I know <br/>
that the other kids don&#39;t?&quot; It&#39;s so subjective. He&#39;s thinking school <br/>
subjects when he asks that. And he doesn&#39;t know all that much about school <br/>
subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt;know about their baseball teams.&quot;  Well, that just lit him  up in a way I<br/>
&gt;rarely see, so I went on, &quot;You can learn so many things that kids  learn in<br/>
&gt;school just by learning about MLB:  math, geography, history...and  you <br/>
&gt;could write<br/>
&gt;about it, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Took me a minute to figure out what MLB stands for. &lt;g&gt; Do you know Sandy <br/>
Keane up in Vancouver? She&#39;s written about all the stuff her boys have <br/>
learned from their interest in baseball. They even used to make scale model <br/>
baseball stadiums. I&#39;ve seen them. They&#39;re wonderful. Now the younger one <br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I kept an old bird cage, smallish, sitting around and I always left <br/>
the  door <br/>
&gt; open.  One day Jon (then about 16) and I had a nice long <br/>
conversation  about <br/>
&gt; how I went from just opening the door on the cage for him (getting <br/>
him out  of <br/>
&gt; school in 6th grade) to realizing that the very cage was just an <br/>
illusion  <br/>
&gt; (total freedom and autonomy).  We talked about how whenever he felt <br/>
like he  was <br/>
&gt; backed up against a wall, that he should just imagine it melting <br/>
away under  <br/>
&gt; him and realize the cage was totally gone and had been for some <br/>
time.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>

&quot;higher math&quot;, but the trades courses in the colleges here usually <br/>
require grade 10, 11, or 12 math, depending on the course.**<br/>
<br/>
OK, I wish there was a way he could stealthily find out what the hardest math is that is used in those courses.  (I&#39;ve taken courses for which you are required to take a whole course in statistics or a whole course in calculus, and I recall needing only a tiny bit of that math to do the work in the class.)  Flipping through a textbook or reading a course syllabus or talking to a former student might reveal some useful information.<br/>
<br/>
What are the potential alternative ways he could learn the content of the trades courses without enrolling in the courses?<br/>
<br/>
Are there self-paced kinds of learning that he could do, knowing that if he had to stop and bone up on math there would be no time penalty?  I don&#39;t think the fast clip of many classes is conducive to thorough learning.<br/>
<br/>
I studied Electrical Engineering in college and it was so abstract that it was terrible preparation for what I needed to know on the job.  (I tend to be very abstract, so I&#39;m better with formulas and homework problems than I am with reality.  Most jobs, &#39;cept maybe the gov&#39;t ones, tend to be reality-based. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I learn well from textbooks while, one of my friends&#39; husbands learns well by doing things.  Which one of us do you suppose adapted better and was more successful as a technology worker?  (Hint: it wasn&#39;t me.)<br/>
<br/>
So I believe that book-learning isn&#39;t the be all and end all of life.  You believe it too.  But Lars isn&#39;t buying it?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I just heard about a PBS series called Roadtrip USA, and at least part of it was asking about how people got started in their careers.  You and I know that lots of people do poorly in school and do well in life.  Lot of people do well in school and end up pulling down the tiny paycheck that school teachers get. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Sometimes I even wonder how interested he really is in film. I understood <br/>

needs anything else, any help, etc.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my gut is telling me that I would need to be in a cave with a door that locked and have complete privacy from my mother before I could start doing something like this.  (And she&#39;s not at all a bad mom, just kind of intrusive.)  I&#39;m really good at imagining things that I want to do, but not so good at dealing with the disappointment if they don&#39;t turn out well.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s not interested in film, per se, but just wanted to see what mountain biking looked like from different angles?  Wanted to be able to make a bike do things on the screen that it can&#39;t do on land? (or in air?)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I had my unemployed brother here for nearly 6 months. Even though he&#39;s fortyish and has worked before and pulled down big paychecks, he could still be adolescent about living in the present and not looking for work.  It&#39;s a challenging transition to make.</div>

money that went through all the trades they teach, classroom and field <br/>
trips. Unfortunately they both conflicted with important ball tournaments. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you mean to get the requirements? He can test out of those, but he has <br/>
to learn the stuff. The local school district has a couple of alternative <br/>
schools that allow the kids to work towards a diploma at their own speed. <br/>
I&#39;ve thought about suggesting it, but I&#39;m a bit cautious about those for <br/>
two reasons. One, they&#39;re designed for the discipline problems. My older <br/>
son went to one and just ended up making a lot of friends that I wished he <br/>
hadn&#39;t. The other has to do with not wanting to cause problems for <br/>
homeschoolers. You can imagine the thinking of the bureaurcrats if very <br/>
many older teens started going to these places knowing not much about <br/>
either arithmetic or writing. Then again, a young man I know went through <br/>
one of those programs recently (in another city) and was quite happy with <br/>
it and has his diploma now. It didn&#39;t take him very long.<br/>

He has said he&#39;d like to take the one week film course given near here. <br/>
They have some weeks that are just for filming extreme sports, but they&#39;re <br/>
all in the spring. If he ends up doing the same program as last year, we <br/>
could use the money for that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534986093">What a wonderful thread! I hope my son has something &quot;in mind&quot; when <br/>
the time comes as well, even if that doesn&#39;t turn out to be his <br/>
life&#39;s work, just having &quot;something&quot; to work towards can be <br/>
empowering. As for the maths, could he perhaps go over a basic high <br/>
school math book? Or perhaps get one of the GED math study guides? <br/>
Perhaps a look at a bit of what is out there would help - it&#39;s not <br/>
like he is going to be needing calculus unless it is something like <br/>
engineering, plus they teach calculus in college anyhow, most kids <br/>
who come out of high school only know basic math - everything else <br/>
they have already forgotten anyhow and so the colleges are ready to <br/>
reteach it to them fo them to get a degree. Me and my nephew <br/>
(traditionally homeschooled with ABecka and will graduate this fall <br/>
and is almost 19, VERY smart!) were talking about that he would <br/>
mabye like to be a chemical engineer and he was worried about that <br/>
he had only had so much math, etc. I know that if he studies he can <br/>
do anything he wants and I told him so, not to let the fear of <br/>
the &quot;unknown math&quot; hold him back from what he wants to do. I think <br/>
he&#39;s going to start off with only 2 courses a semester from a small <br/>
college because he really wants to experience the &quot;work&quot; world <br/>
somewhat as well (he has never worked) and luckily his parents are <br/>
highly in agreement with him. I asked him if he has minded using a <br/>
curriculum and he said that except for a few times when the courses <br/>
seemed overly long or overly indepth about subjects he didn&#39;t have <br/>
much interest in that he really enjoyed schooling at home and was <br/>
glad that his parents gave him the opportunity to be closer to them <br/>
as well. Anyhow I think he should be able to do ANYTHING he sets his <br/>
mind to and I can only hope my son (6 yo) will have that &quot;clue&quot; of <br/>
what he wants to do at his age, even though we are following an <br/>
entirely different path with my son picking his own activities now, <br/>
and me being his advisor/ guide ,etc and not his TEACHER.</div>

I find  it really hard to give him answers when he asks, &quot;*What* do I know <br/>
that  the other kids don&#39;t?&quot; It&#39;s so subjective. He&#39;s thinking school <br/>
subjects  when he asks that. And he doesn&#39;t know all that much about school  <br/>
subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Just now in the car we had the same conversation.  All I could think  of was <br/>
all the things he does know about baseball, and all the trips he&#39;s taken  and <br/>
the places he&#39;s been.  What he knows is what he knows, and it&#39;s not  <br/>
quantifiable and it&#39;s in him and it can&#39;t be measured.  The whole reason we  measure <br/>
kids is ONLY because they are in school.  <br/>
 <br/>
I explained it to him like this:  <br/>
 <br/>
Most of the kids born in 1993 all learned the same things by the time they  <br/>
were 5.  They learned how to walk and talk and letters and colors and  numbers, <br/>
etc.  Then some of them went to school.  So those kids were  all in the same <br/>
grade and in the first year they learned this and this and  this.  (I gestured <br/>
with my hands to signify a brief section of time.)   Then they moved into the <br/>
next grade and learned this and this and this (using my  hands to form <br/>
another section of time).  And the next year, this and this  and this.  But you, <br/>
Will, and other unschooled kids, they get to age 5 and  they learn this (I put my <br/>
hand in the first section) and this (I moved my hand  far ahead on the <br/>
imaginary line) and this (then moved it back a little), and  THIS (and I moved my <br/>
hand to way past the end of the line into something most  people learn only as <br/>
adults), and that&#39;s the same way you&#39;ve been learning your  entire life.  When <br/>
all of you that were born in 1993 get to be 18 or 20,  most of you will know <br/>
pretty much the same things as everyone else born  then.  Except YOU might not <br/>
know what Plymouth Rock is until you&#39;re 25, and  that&#39;s okay, because you went <br/>
25 years without ever having a NEED to know  what Plymouth Rock is.  And THEY <br/>
might not know so much about New York,  because they might never have a NEED <br/>
to know that.  Just like you learned  to read when your brain was ready, you <br/>
will learn the things you need to know  when you need to know them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then I picked up a piece of junk mail off the dashboard.  It had a  bullet <br/>
list of four things on it.  I said, &quot;Teachers sometimes decide for  instance, <br/>
that this is a list of all the things a kid should know in 4th grade  about a <br/>
certain thing.  The best students in the class might sit and listen  to all <br/>
that, learn something, and be able to remember it all and put it on a  test.  Some <br/>
of the kids who aren&#39;t such good students might get one of the  things and <br/>
vaguely remember the rest.  And then some of them will pick out  #2 on the list <br/>
and really want to know much much more about that one thing,  but they won&#39;t <br/>
be able to learn anymore than the teacher is willing to give  them, or what&#39;s <br/>
in the textbook.  You are not forced to learn anything at  all, but if you <br/>
wanted to pick out #2 on the list and learn all you can about  it, you could do <br/>
that and keep on doing it until you are through.  Or you  could learn about #2 <br/>
and then be slightly interested in 3 and 4, or just ignore  the list <br/>
altogether.  Kids in school don&#39;t have that choice.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then he said this, &quot;I know!  It&#39;s like a &quot;learn sandwich&quot; and  someone&#39;s <br/>
trying to stuff it in their mouth!&quot;  and he put his hand  to my mouth as if to <br/>
stuff in a sandwich.  I said, &quot;Yes!  And  what happens if you eat something you <br/>
don&#39;t like?&quot;  He stuck out his tongue  and made vomit noises as only a 10 yo <br/>
boy can do.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was a nice conversation, fun and animated.  I think he has  something to <br/>
think about.<br/>

What is  models of the universe?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure I first heard about this in the heyday of AOL&#39;s homeschooling  <br/>
forum.  I can&#39;t remember who first used it, Sandra or Pam or maybe Mary  Kate or <br/>
someone else.  There maybe something written about it on the  internet <br/>
somewhere, and I&#39;m sure Sandra can explain it better than I can.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s the idea that everyone is building a model of the universe in  their <br/>
head, and every experience and idea they have either is added to what the  <br/>
universe looks like to them, saved for later or discarded.  Everyone&#39;s  model is <br/>
different because everyone&#39;s experiences and chemistry are different,  even <br/>
though there are things in common.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s easier to see it when you think in terms of little babies with &quot;so  <br/>
little experience, you might not be cognizant...&quot; A baby&#39;s first experiences,  <br/>
feeling mother&#39;s touch for the first time, hearing her voice unmuffled, seeing  <br/>
the lights, are the building blocks of their model of what the world is  like.  <br/>
Soon they are experiencing their body and gravity and sound and  these things <br/>
start to make sense in context of what else they know.  <br/>
 <br/>
A model of the universe is a very powerful visual for me.  I can&#39;t  believe I <br/>
haven&#39;t shared the idea with Will, yet.<br/>

Thanks!  It was at LEAST 6 or 7 years ago when we first discussed  that on <br/>
AOL.  It was very profound for me and one of the things that most  helped me on <br/>
my way to unschooling.  <br/>
 <br/>
So thanks again.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151554984">Mary Ellen, I think this certainly a problem.  When I was in <br/>
college, I started working toward a degree in education, preparing <br/>
to be a teacher.  I liked the idea less and less as I took the <br/>
classes, and when I was nearly finished, I was sure I did NOT want <br/>
to be a teacher!  I think that many people would go ahead and finish <br/>
since they were nearly done anyway.  Many people end up having jobs <br/>
they dislike because they &quot;don&#39;t want to waste their education&quot;.  <br/>
They feel guilty about changing their minds.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I got my degree in English literature instead.  I have NEVER <br/>
regretted not becoming a teacher.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528644002">My 13  year old son asked me if I would pay his friend to tutor him. When asked why he wants to be tutored, he replied, so I can get smarter. Seems innocent enough. But, I know he is comparing himself to his schooled friends when he makes that assessment. He was in school up until 1 & 1/2 yrs ago.  We are definitely still deschooling in a big way, and I feel like I am not providing enough &quot; stimulation&quot; or opportunities for him to feel that schooling is not the answer. Anyway, feedback would be appreciated. I am posting this rather quickly and can give more info, if needed. Thx.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563490094">I&#39;d be curious to know whether it was the friend&#39;s idea (whether he&#39;s convinced your son needs the help; our kids have had a couple of kids think so) or whether the friend just needs money, or your son is worried.<br/>
<br/>
But in any case, if you don&#39;t feel deschooling &quot;took&quot; in your house, or your son was in school a long time, and he&#39;s already a teen, maybe it couldn&#39;t hurt too much.<br/>
<br/>
Ways in which perhaps it could hurt, some: <br/>
The friend goes to school and says a homeschooled boy doesn&#39;t know any of that stuff.<br/>
The friend isn&#39;t very good at explaining whatever it is (odds are fairly good that he won&#39;t be, but he might be wonderful!  Teachers are rarely told how to to present material.  Some people are naturals at explaining and coaching.<br/>
Your son feels it&#39;s hard and frustrating and somehow sees that as evidence against natural learning, rather than evidence against traditional presentations of traditionally separated-out subject matter.<br/>
<br/>
But it might not hurt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-368731654">***When asked why he wants to be tutored, he replied, so I can get smarter.***<br/>
<br/>
What are his natural abilities?  Sometimes what a kid might need is recognition of what they ARE good at, what they ARE smart about.  If he really wants a tutor, maybe one that helps him do something that he already really enjoys.  For instance, if he&#39;s into cars, maybe being around another person who is also really into cars can help your kid expand his knowledge of that.  Every time a kid does better at something they love, they will know more and feel more confident in what they know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What does he want tutoring help with?  Perhaps it really is something he&#39;s interested in knowing more about, to be smarter about.<br/>
<br/>
***We are definitely still deschooling in a big way, and I feel like I am not providing enough &quot; stimulation&quot; or opportunities for him to feel that schooling is not the answer.***<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could come up with a list of fun things that he might like to do.  Include tutoring in that list.  Then he could pick and choose out of that list.  I do this with my own kids when they want to do things, especially things that cost money or are very time consuming.  It helps them make clear choices about what is or isn&#39;t a high priority for their/our resources.<br/>
