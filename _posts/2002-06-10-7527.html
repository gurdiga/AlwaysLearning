<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701263097">&lt;&lt;Encourage her to find her passion for life again. It is a vital part of coping with any chronic <br/>
condition.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Her passion prior to fibro was gymnastics.  She was a competitive gymnast and a dancer, very active and vibrant.  I think it might take a while for her to find a new passion.  She loved writing, but is very reluctant to keep journals now.  Maybe it brings her too face to face with her illness.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;for me that is the best way to deal<br/>
with chronic pain...to remove yourself from it as much<br/>
as you can. Think about other things, other people,<br/>
ideas outside of ones own body. Doing, thinking,<br/>
creating, laughing.......and yes, a pain med to help<br/>
over a hump, because sometimes the pain is too<br/>
demanding to even attempt to ignore and there are<br/>
things to be done anyway.  Like living. :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I admire you.  I don&#39;t know how I would be able to deal with chronic pain, so I&#39;ll copy these wise words and send them to my daughter to read.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It can be really hard to find the balance.  (I&#39;m still working on it.)  It <br/>
*is* important to move, but it&#39;s also important to listen to your <br/>
body.  For your daughter, it might start out as simple exercises done in <br/>
bed, *very* gently and gradually&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She seems so resistant to trying anything.  Maybe because it is all so new.  I&#39;m not sure I know the exact differences between fibro and CFS, but I think my daughter may have a couple of the CFS symptoms.  She says she is fatigued, but I don&#39;t know if she is using the term accurately.  She can and does get up occasionally to walk downstairs to her room to get something needed.  She is no worse afterwards.  But a trip to the dr&#39;s office makes her pain worse.  She still has no problem getting up to use the bathroom, though.  I don&#39;t need to help her shower.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, yes, she should be as active as she *can*, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t tell<br/>
her to push through her pain.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is so hard to understand exactly how someone else feels.  I guess all I can do is give her this advice, and be there for support as she discovers her limits on her own.  I think this is the most respectful approach.  She already gets enough disrespect from doctors who don&#39;t really understand, although they claim to.  They use phrases such as:  &quot;She has failed all medications.&quot;  Or, &quot;I suspect she is fighting the effects of the medicine.&quot;  Or, &quot;I think her mental state is making the pain seem worse than it is.&quot;  He suggested we see a psychologist that runs a pain management clinic, and after speaking with him I learned he uses techniques such as self-hypnosis and relaxation to help deal with pain.  This sounded great, but then I read some literature he sent, which mentioned his research into the mind/body connection, and now I am worried he is assuming Tiffany is contributing to her own illness.  The GP that referred us already consulted with him prior to the appointment.  The one who made the above remarks.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I had friends who lost children to terminal illness or<br/>
accidents.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A nice reminder that we do have a lot to be grateful for;  There is always someone worse off, and we still have the capability to help others in some way. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have to tell Roy, that I just can&#39;t do it....I feel<br/>
so ashamed then, and I pray, inside, that Roy learns<br/>
compassion rather than feeling deprived. Though I fear<br/>
it is both.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your love for your son is so evident, I can feel it in your words.  We are all deprived at times, but your son KNOWS you love him.<br/>
<br/>
People with fibro and other chronic pain illnesses are some of the nicest people I have met, off or on-line!  And they know so much more about the illnesses than the doctors.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your evening!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; disrespect from doctors who don&#39;t really understand,<br/>
&gt; although they claim to. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some doctors are such ass-holes!!!!! Poor Tiffany.<br/>
Poor Mama.  She is NOT doing to herself!!! She didn&#39;t<br/>
earn this and it isn&#39;t bad karma. It just is. <br/>
<br/>
Those &quot;pain management techniques&quot; are because the<br/>
docs are concerned about pain-med addiction.  It is a<br/>
valid concern. But, if  or have a root canal, you get<br/>
some relief, without asking, but if you have something<br/>
that hurts worse, but doesn&#39;t have a foreseeable<br/>
ending, you get zilch. You are supposed to improve<br/>
your meditation techniques. I would suggest asking for<br/>
something for menstrual cramps....really bad<br/>
ones..describe the abdominal spasms and<br/>
headaches....bloating isn&#39;t the problem (so they don&#39;t<br/>
include a diuretic) tell them Tylenol just doesn&#39;t<br/>
help.....and save it for the REAL pain.  Knowing that<br/>
you have something to help a little bit, if ou need<br/>
it, does push the unbearable threshold back some.  <br/>
<br/>
I broke a foot a few of years ago, and was given a<br/>
prescription for some pain-meds.  &quot;Good grief&quot; I<br/>
thought, &quot;this little ding is nothing, and it is going<br/>
to get better in a few weeks&quot; It really did hurt, and<br/>
it LOOKED bad. &quot;If this is what is unbearable ,<br/>
according to the doc, then why should I have to put up<br/>
with this other all the time?&quot;  I saved the meds for<br/>
when I just couldn&#39;t overcome my pain induced inertia,<br/>
and called in the prescription for renewal. Over and<br/>
over.  I have to do a liver-function test every 6<br/>
months, now.  After about two years  I had to go to<br/>
the doctor and justify myself.  It was sort of<br/>
obvious.  But.  Relief was NEVER OFFERED for chronic<br/>
pain. I had to insist.  And also had to point out that<br/>
there were times when it peaked that needed extra<br/>
relief. Perhaps as a mother you can advocate for her?<br/>
<br/>
A sympathetic neurologist is most likely to help. But<br/>
they are into all sort of tests.  Dunno if they do all<br/>
the neuropathy tests for Fibro that they do for MS,<br/>
but after one series, I got off the table and told &#39;em<br/>
&quot;NO&quot;. And I&#39;m not taking any more nuclear waste for<br/>
contrast MRIs either.  There is only so much<br/>
radioactivity that a body can tolerate. I understand<br/>
it is cumalitve, if you start at 13 that can really<br/>
add up. I am post child-bearing too. After an<br/>
&quot;inconclusive&quot; lumbar puncture, I refused to have it<br/>
redone. One&#39;s enough.<br/>
<br/>
Does Tiffany like weaving?  A lap or table loom is<br/>
fun. On a weaving list (that I used to be on....it was<br/>
very active) there were a couple of weavers with CFS<br/>
and they found it soothing to sit in a recliner near a<br/>
window and weave.  Beautiful things they did too. No<br/>
rush. Just weave as the spirit moved them. Used those<br/>
plastic &quot;childrens&quot; needles and yarn. Just a thought.<br/>
I use rag strips to make things......<br/>

I take long-term narcotic pain killers every day.  While I don&#39;t like the <br/>
idea of being a dope fiend, it is the only way that my pain is bearable.  <br/>
You&#39;re right - just having the meds available, whether I take them or not, <br/>
does seem to push my tolerance level just a bit further.  As long as the meds <br/>
are helping me to function at my best, I will continue taking them.  <br/>

&gt;and a dancer, very active and vibrant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh that&#39;s really harsh.  I wasn&#39;t all that active before I got it, but I&#39;ve <br/>
heard that a lot of people were.  At least she can know inside herself that <br/>
it is *not* a matter of laziness.  I often battle that myself.  How much is <br/>
the fibro and how much is my own dislike of exercise?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think it might take a while for her to find a new passion.  She loved <br/>
&gt;writing, but is very reluctant to keep journals now.  Maybe it brings her <br/>
&gt;too face to face with her illness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe journals are not the right kind of writing for her at this <br/>
time.  Maybe she&#39;d enjoy writing stories or poetry or something.  This <br/>
would be a good time to do lots of &quot;strewing&quot; with her.  Maybe offer her <br/>
books and videos about various crafts (like the weaving suggestion).  Find <br/>
interesting books on topics that used to interest her even a little, <br/>
internet sites.  It really will help if she can get her mind on other <br/>
things.  It doesn&#39;t take the pain or fatigue away, but can make it easier <br/>
to bear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

&gt;I think my daughter may have a couple of the CFS symptoms.  She says she <br/>
&gt;is fatigued, but I don&#39;t know if she is using the term accurately.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> From what I can tell, fibro and CFS are almost exactly alike.  The <br/>
differences are that people with fibro have the tender points, and people <br/>
with CFS get sore throats and swollen glands.  I&#39;ve got both of those, even <br/>
though I&#39;ve only been diagnosed with fibro.  Other than that, you&#39;ll find <br/>
much the same list of symptoms for both, especially fatigue and pain.<br/>
<br/>
The fatigue for me is a lack of stamina.  I can still run if I have to . . <br/>
. but only for a minute or so, and then I&#39;d be wiped for the day.  Any kind <br/>
of upward movement is difficult, from walking up hills or stairs to getting <br/>
myself up from sitting or squatting.  From what I&#39;ve read, it seems to have <br/>
something to do with the muscles not getting the oxygen they need, or not <br/>
processing it properly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She can and does get up occasionally to walk downstairs to her room to get <br/>
&gt;something needed.  She is no worse afterwards.  But a trip to the dr&#39;s <br/>

&gt;the bathroom, though.  I don&#39;t need to help her shower.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no trouble moving around the house, etc., but a trip to the store is <br/>
tiring.  The day I go to town (1 hour drive, stops at library, grocery <br/>
stores, and maybe other errands) completely fries me.  I try not to plan <br/>
anything at all for that evening.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It is so hard to understand exactly how someone else feels.  I guess all I <br/>

&gt;her limits on her own.  I think this is the most respectful approach.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Keep encouraging her to find ways to move without making her feel <br/>
guilty for not taking your advice.  Some people say that doing Tai Chi <br/>
helps them a lot.  I haven&#39;t tried it yet.  Apparently you can do it at <br/>
your own level, even sitting down if need be.  It&#39;s definitely a gentle <br/>
form of exercise, and with her background she might find it easy to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She already gets enough disrespect from doctors who don&#39;t really <br/>
&gt;understand, although they claim to.  They use phrases such as:  &quot;She has <br/>
&gt;failed all medications.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s such a dumb way to put it.  You can explain to her that what it <br/>
really means is that the medications have failed *her*.  In other words, <br/>
they didn&#39;t work for her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Or, &quot;I suspect she is fighting the effects of the medicine.&quot;  Or, &quot;I think <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There *is* a mind/body connection.  But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s all in her <br/>
head.  This guy might be able to help her, but I&#39;d suggest talking with him <br/>
further before she sees him.  Get it really clear that he&#39;s not going to <br/>
hit her with &quot;It&#39;s all in your head.&quot;  Yes, what&#39;s in our heads does affect <br/>
how we feel, but there&#39;s biochemical stuff going on in the first <br/>
place.  Here&#39;s something I just got on another homeschooling list (where <br/>
we&#39;re also discussing fibro).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2002/fibromyalgia.htm">http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2002/fibromyalgia.htm</a><br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;Fibromyalgia pain isn&#39;t all in patients&#39; heads, new brain study finds<br/>
 &gt;fMRI scans give first objective measure of mysterious ailment, provide road<br/>
 &gt;map for future study<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;ANN ARBOR, MI - A new brain-scan study confirms scientifically what<br/>
 &gt;fibromyalgia patients have been telling a skeptical medical community for<br/>
 &gt;years: They&#39;re really in pain.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;In fact, the study finds, people with fibromyalgia say they feel severe<br/>
 &gt;pain, and have measurable pain signals in their brains, from a gentle<br/>
 &gt;finger squeeze that barely feels unpleasant to people without the disease.<br/>
 &gt;The squeeze&#39;s force must be doubled to cause healthy people to feel the<br/>
 &gt;same level of pain - and their pain signals show up in different brain areas.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;The results, published in the current issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism, the<br/>
 &gt;journal of the American College of Rheumatology, may offer the proof of<br/>
 &gt;fibromyalgia&#39;s physical roots that many doubtful physicians have sought. It<br/>
 &gt;may also open doors for further research on the still-unknown causes of the<br/>
 &gt;disease, which affects more than 2 percent of Americans, mainly women.<br/>

&gt;someone worse off, and we still have the capability to help others in some <br/>
&gt;way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used this thought a lot when my first baby was struggling with a heart <br/>
defect.  I watched kids at the hospital slowly dying of cancer and others <br/>
with neurological problems so severe that their parents didn&#39;t even visit <br/>
anymore.  It was heartbreaking but also helped me deal with my own <br/>
situation better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve mostly found this to be true as well.  Just be really careful if you <br/>
spend time on the alt.med.fibromyalgia newsgroup.  There are wonderful <br/>
people there with tons of useful info.  There are also people who will jump <br/>
into flame war mode at the drop of a pin, even some of the same <br/>
people!  I&#39;m *very* selective about which posts I actually download and read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884688939">There is a less than a week old fawn coming to live<br/>
with us today.  Does anyone know how frequently it<br/>
needs feeding? I would guess every two hours, more or<br/>
less,for a couple of weeks, then 4 hours. Will it<br/>
tolerate goat formula (it is being fed calf starter<br/>
with molasses added, now)?  Can I used dog flea/tick<br/>
stuff on it?  I&#39;ve just gone through a flea purging<br/>
here :-(  <br/>
<br/>
While Roy and DH were gone for a week (my alone time,<br/>
at last :-) I found that I was unable to keep up with<br/>
all the critters and asked my sister to come help me<br/>
take 3 of the dogs to the pound.  People were asking<br/>
for the dogs before I even got them inside :-) Though<br/>
I have mixed feeling here....Roy will be heart broken<br/>
when he gets home tonight.  I cry too :-(  Anyway, I<br/>
just upgraded (all by myself) the chicken pen,<br/>
rabbits, ducks, with help took the dogs away. Gave up<br/>
gardening altogether....and now I get a phone call<br/>
that they are brining ME a present.  Another animal. <br/>
A baby deer.  So.  I made it a little manger (I call<br/>
it that to make it more acceptable to me),  with a<br/>
chair for the people, on a small porch we have, that<br/>
will probably be OK for a couple of weeks  Then what?<br/>
<br/>
How active are they, when?  When will it need solid<br/>
food? Will hay be sufficient? Or does it need wild<br/>
stuff?  which wild stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Lucky I decided to give up gardening (except for the<br/>
potted things).  <br/>
<br/>
The Rudd Petting Zoo....another something to take me<br/>
outside myself (more of that instant Karmic<br/>
feedback...when will I learn to hush?!)<br/>
<br/>
Help!!!! It is a male White Tail. Roy named him Legs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just saw the cutest baby deer on TV on Saturday.<br/>
Our local Wildlife World Zoo brought 2 babies on the local news show and<br/>
were bottle feeding them ~ oh so cute!<br/>
<br/>
Will you plan on keeping this baby deer indefinately as a pet, or do you<br/>
plan on letting it go in the future, to be wild again?<br/>
If you plan on letting it go, I would think about handing it over to a wild<br/>
animal rescue organization, so the baby won&#39;t be permanently imprinted by<br/>
humans and then won&#39;t know how to fend for itself when it grows up. That is<br/>
a real concern. The wildlife rescue orgs. know how to have minimal contact<br/>
or even may have a foster mom available to help raise the baby with it&#39;s own<br/>
kind.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, here&#39;s a website I found on the care of newborn or orphan<br/>
fawns.<br/>
Hope it helps some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137600782">Legs is here!  He is so cute, and tiny. Smaller than I<br/>
expected....the wire on the gate I arranged is too<br/>
big. We&#39;ve fixed that problem.<br/>
<br/>
We have checked into a permit, already, as DH is<br/>
planning to raise deer.  He is in the process of<br/>
making a HUGE, humongous fence and all the permit<br/>
required trimmings.  But.  The plan was to start with<br/>
ADULT deer.  We have a friend who does this already,<br/>
and has promised us some (adult) does and a<br/>
buck.....but I thought this was a LONG way down the<br/>
road. <br/>
<br/>
So little Legs is here.  Poor lil&#39; guy. So trusting.<br/>
Corky (DH) wants to keep it to be his and<br/>
semi-domesticated. It still means me.  When kids and<br/>
DH bring home critters it seems to be Mama who always<br/>
has to make sure that they are cared for consistently.<br/>
That&#39;s why I need to know what to do now, and was<br/>
caught unprepared. Seems very goat-like, but MUCH more<br/>
fragile.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for web-site...will check it out tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Falcons? As in peregrine and ? Ooooooo Tell us. Tell<br/>
us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-957300098">Believe it or not people give them to me.  They hear I<br/>
like animals or I have raised such and such and they<br/>
come knocking whenever they find something.   I once<br/>
raised hamsters  and people would leave hamsters in<br/>
cages on my front porch while i was gone sometimes<br/>
with anonymous notes about names or food.   The baby<br/>
raccoons were washed out of drain of a large public<br/>
swimming pool when the city was trying to clean out<br/>
the pool and get it ready for summer.   A lifeguard<br/>
fished 2 babies out of the waterway  they were flushed<br/>
into.   They were tiny and I did&#39;nt think they would<br/>
live.   The baby squirrel was left in the nest and its<br/>
mother was electrocuted in a transformer in my parents<br/>
yard.   My mother knew about the babies  but by the<br/>
time we got to the nest  only one baby was alive.  <br/>
The rabbits were babies  whose nest and mother were<br/>
hit by a brushhog(we live in a rural area)  the<br/>
kestrel(sparrow hawk) was blown out of the nest in a<br/>
storm soon after he hatched.  We left him alone all<br/>
day  and the parents soon gave up on him   so we<br/>
brought him in and wrapped towels into a nest shape<br/>
and put a heating pad underneath  and we fed him<br/>
hamburger with long handled tweezers at first.   We<br/>
taught him to fly by walking around the yard flapping<br/>
our arms while he sat on our hands and had to use his<br/>
wings to keep balance and finally one day he flew  but<br/>
it was a week or so after his siblings did.   After he<br/>
learned to fly he rejoined the parents and siblings<br/>
and we would throw raw chicken wings on the roof for<br/>
the birds to eat.  The whole family stayed around for<br/>
a couple of years and then they all just went away and<br/>
didn&#39;t come back.   All the animals that have come<br/>
from the wild  I attempt to put back in the wild<br/>
eventually  usually they just slowly move out on their<br/>
own  but I also go to great lengths not to over handle<br/>
them.   All the exotic pets I have  I have bought from<br/>
breeders or have had them given to me and all are<br/>
captive bred.  I still feel sorry for my lizards that<br/>
seem like they are unhappy much of the time. <br/>
There are alot of animals out there but many people<br/>
keep the fact that they have them to themselves <br/>
because like where I live  if I was caught with a wild<br/>
animal  I would face $5000 fine and up to 5 years in<br/>
prison.  For people that are truly interested and have<br/>
time and money   many states have people who are<br/>
trained to rehabilitate animals orphaned or taken from<br/>
the wild.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695388091">That is really interesting.  When I was a kid, I had a pet racoon.  He was my all time <br/>
favorite.  I kept him all summer and by fall he left.  He came back a Christmas time for a <br/>
while.  By Spring, he left for good.  He was a wonderful pet.  <br/>
<br/>
Saturday, the girls found a baby bird in the yard and wanted to help it, but I think it <br/>
had just come out of its shell, and was too small to help.  It was sad.  <br/>

Two falls within a few months may be an indication of<br/>
something else going on. Please ask your doc.<br/>
Love and Prayers<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what I told Keith.  I said &quot;My ankles aren&#39;t working anymore.&quot;  He <br/>
said coincidence, and that all I lack to be an absent-minded professor is the <br/>
professor part.<br/>
<br/>
BUT... the three nights before this last fall, I put icy-hot on my ankles <br/>
because they were hurting.<br/>
<br/>
So I think I&#39;m going to get some new shoes, if nothing else, and not wear <br/>
slippery-bottomed flip-flops for a while and see if that helps.  <br/>
<br/>
So what are the brainstorm guesses on ankles not working?  <br/>
arthritis?<br/>
MS?<br/>
I don&#39;t know of others from the experience of close friends, just those two.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of stairs in the house, and ordinarily I can run up them, so <br/>
it&#39;s not a total lack of exercise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26081350">Could be any of innuerable things.....ask your<br/>
doctor(s) to test you for EVERYTHING. If you feel like<br/>
something is wrong.....it is. Could be several things<br/>
at once.<br/>
<br/>
This is a weekday. Call today, get started. <br/>
<br/>
Keith would feel awful if you listened to him, this<br/>
time. He is wishfull thinking, trying to be an<br/>
optimist. Guess you have to waite for your foot to<br/>
heal up to get new shoes...that fit the new size your<br/>
foot will be.<br/>
