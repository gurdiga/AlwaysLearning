<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441919401">Someone sent a dopey song about homeschooling to my Plano Unschoolers list and it got forwarded to another list where one of the members came up with unschooling verses.  I created a 13th day reply and the 14th day verse.  I&#39;m sure others could come up with some great 13th day replies.  The cadence doesn&#39;t match for the last two days very closely, but it&#39;s funny.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notice, it says the first day of PUBLIC school.  Why would unschoolers say first day of home school?  Besides, the questions usually start during back-to-school time for the ISD&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
And uh one, and uh two...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
On the Sixth day of public school my neighbor said to me, &quot;Don&#39;t you set limits? PLAY CAN&#39;T BE &quot;WORK&quot;!! Don&#39;t you use workbooks? What about the TAKS test? Where&#39;s your curriculum? Don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the seventh day of public school my neighbor said to me, &quot;Life isn&#39;t like that.  Don&#39;t you set limits? PLAY CAN&#39;T BE &quot;WORK&quot;!! Don&#39;t you use workbooks? What about the TAKS test? Where&#39;s your curriculum? Don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the eighth day of public school my neighbor said to me, &quot;John Holt was crazy!   Life isn&#39;t like that.  Don&#39;t you set limits? PLAY CAN&#39;T BE &quot;WORK&quot;!! Don&#39;t you use workbooks? What about the TAKS test? Where&#39;s your curriculum? Don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the Ninth day of public school my neighbor said to me, &quot;You have no structure. John Holt was crazy!   Life isn&#39;t like that.  Don&#39;t you set limits? PLAY CAN&#39;T BE &quot;WORK&quot;!! Don&#39;t you use workbooks? What about the TAKS test? Where&#39;s your curriculum? Don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the tenth day of public school my neighbor said to me, &quot;Kids need a schedule.  You have no structure. John Holt was crazy!   Life isn&#39;t like that.  Don&#39;t you set limits? PLAY CAN&#39;T BE &quot;WORK&quot;!! Don&#39;t you use workbooks? What about the TAKS test? Where&#39;s your curriculum? Don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the eleventh day of public school my neighbor said to me, &quot;I just don&#39;t get it  Kids need a schedule.  You have no structure. &quot; John Holt was crazy!   Life isn&#39;t like that.  Don&#39;t you set limits? PLAY CAN&#39;T BE &quot;WORK&quot;!! Don&#39;t you use workbooks? What about the TAKS test? Where&#39;s your curriculum? Don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?<br/>

Don&#39;t your kids just watch TV all day?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the thirteenth day of public school I smilingly replied: &quot;We like being different, go read these websites, kids don&#39;t need a schedule, we don&#39;t like structure, Holt was a genius, Life isn&#39;t like school, No, we don&#39;t set limits, LEARNING NEVER ENDS!!  We use what the kids like, Tests don&#39;t accurately measure knowledge, Our curriculum is in a landfill  ..and the purpose of unschooling is JOY!<br/>
<br/>
On the fourteenth day of public school, my neighbor said to me... My kids really hate school, maybe I should withdraw them, I don&#39;t really know them as people, their friends are kind of nasty, the parents seem even worse, there&#39;s just so much stress, I hate the government raising my children, UNSCHOOLING SOUNDS SO COOL (but kind of scary at first), I would like to try it, I think my kids would like it, my spouse might need some work, but I know you&#39;ll help me out cause you&#39;re so awesome!<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Objective of Unschooling is JOY! <br/>
