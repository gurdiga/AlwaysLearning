<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096651444">There is a site called fiverr.com where people offer services.  <br/>
<br/>
I’ve used it quite a bit over the years, and I just saw a new section there.  People offering to help with video games, or play with people, or record a session, or provide “cheats” (codes, tricks, useful glitches), starting at $5 or $10.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For a family with NO gaming experience and a gaming kid, this could be helpful, especially if the parents hang out and listen, take notes, or maybe play themselves and then help the kid.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve used fiverr mostly for Learn Nothing Day art, but there was an offer to write something on a banana and then go and feed it to monkeys.  I ordered two of those.  :-)   Those folks aren’t living where they were anymore (Vietnam is where the monkeys were), but there have been other things.  <br/>
<br/>
My orders have been images and video, but there are reviews there you can read, on personal-interaction things.  If you look at a gig by one person, you might be able to click the person’s fiverr ID/name and see other offers by that person, with other reviews.<br/>

Here you can see some others I’ve bought for $5 or $10, for Learn Nothing Day.  I love “coconut&quot; the best.<br/>

There are other peeks into my house and life, or things I saw.  Nothing very profound unless you want to see how a birds nest turned an umbrella, and how to shell boiled eggs (rather than peeling them):<br/>
