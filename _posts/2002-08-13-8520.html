the biggest sweet tooth/carb tooth on the planet!  Ds (almost 4) is just<br/>
about 100% weaned, and he can take it or leave it.  He&#39;s the one always<br/>

I like it cold (I&#39;m constantly putting it in the freezer to be really cold -<br/>
if it forms little ice crystals it&#39;s perfect!).  My kids don&#39;t care about<br/>
cold or if it&#39;s flat (I  need BUBBLES, lol) so I save the flat stuff for<br/>
them (well, it&#39;s flat for me but not totally flat).<br/>

Tamzin&#39;s eating patterns are remarkably like her father&#39;s.  She <br/>
has not lived with him for 4 years and before that, did not have <br/>
many meals with him (he was out gigging, practising and <br/>
recording a lot).  She is picky, but definitely has a &#39;savory tooth&#39; <br/>
and doesn&#39;t like her food &#39;mixed together&#39;, just like Chris.  But <br/>
she also loves fruit, like me (her dad only ever eats bananas and <br/>
apples).  She breastfed until she was almost 3.  Her tastes are <br/>
definitely expanding as she gets older, and now she tries a lot <br/>
more foods than she used to.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869163150">Some new experimental research has shown some interesting stuff with babies<br/>
in utero. Apparantly we learn about tastes while still in the womb.<br/>
Researchers fed mothers lots of carrot juice during the last half of<br/>
pregnancy and those babies whose moms had had the juice responded<br/>
positively to cereal flavored with carrot when they were 4 months old as<br/>
opposed to the babies whose mothers had a regular diet. There are other<br/>
studies as well. But it does help explain why Indian kids happily munch<br/>
their way thru spicy curries from infancy!<br/>
<br/>
I love food and eat a wider variety (no pickiness here unfortunately for my<br/>
bum:) and my kids are all open to eating all kinds of things. I think taste<br/>
is something that develops from an early age but does change regularly over<br/>
the years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627169405">This has definatly been true for my sisters twins.  One was breastfed <br/>
until she was almost 3 and the other only (exclusivley)for a few <br/>
weeks (nipple confusion, mommy confusion, call it what you will).  <br/>
The nurser eats anything including hot salsas, and other spicey foods <br/>
any veggi, anything.  While the bottler eats only familiar foods.  We <br/>
could also chalk it up to personality except that the bottler is <br/>
generally the more adventurous so that theory doesn&#39;t hold at least <br/>
in this case.  It is also interesting to note that her other kids <br/>
(all brestfed less than six months) are picky eaters with the second <br/>
who was brestfed for the shortest time existing almost entirely on a <br/>
diet of Eggos and Gogurt.  So in this cross sampling of genetically <br/>
simular children.  Your theory definatly holds true.<br/>

so much.  When she first started grabbing for food, she went for <br/>
avos and anything  garlicy.  I must have eaten at least 2 avos a <br/>
day and a ton of garlicy food when I was pregnant!<br/>
