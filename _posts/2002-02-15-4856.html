We are just the opposite!<br/>
I am a HOMEBODY!<br/>
I love being at home, but my 5yo is getting squirrely. Our local hs group has started a 6 and under play group, and she wants to go- I will take her, but am apprehensive about it- for no logical reason of course, I just do not prefer anything &quot;organized&quot;. I guess I am getting rebellious in my 30&#39;s! (ha- another story altogether)<br/>
We also have signed up for swimming lessons in April. And I promised her gymnastics in June, after she is 6. (trying to spread out the expenses) I am not worried about her being &quot;socialized&quot;, she is just lonely. Our best friends (also homeschoolers) recently moved out of state and everyone else we know is in public school. Anyone elsoe have this dilemma?<br/>
