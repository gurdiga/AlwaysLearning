<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674917231">Just had to chime in a say how happy I always am to see other HUGE Kevin Smith fans out there in the homeschooling world!!  We have been big fans ever since Clerks first came out.  And I never miss an opportunity to tell people that Kevin personally wished my husband and I a Happy Anniversary on our 7 year Anniversary...told us to watch out for the 7 year itch...LOL.  And that was 7 years ago!  And he always puts such great stuff in the special features of the DVDs.<br/>
<br/>
Kevin has such an incredible gift for dialogue between characters and it has sparked many a &quot;jumping off point&quot; around here!<br/>
<br/>
Okay...back into lurker mode now.  :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123426720"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We are big Kevin Smith fans here...HUGE, actually.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Us, too! Chasing Amy is my personal favorite, particularly the scene<br/>
where Silent Bob finally speaks - that&#39;s great! Two other favorite<br/>
parts are the cartoon drawing (the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus...) and<br/>
the really awkward moment between the 3 main characters when Holden<br/>
decides he&#39;s got it all figured out, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Dogma is DH&#39;s favorite and we both like Clerks and yes, Mallrats. I<br/>
know, it&#39;s cheesy in so many ways but it&#39;s also a lot of fun. The<br/>
chocolate pretzel thing always makes me laugh in awed disgust.  ;)<br/>

I feel the need to put out a huge flashing warning sign on Kevin  <br/>
Smith stuff.  I enjoy it immensely, but I have two young-adult sons  <br/>
who&#39;ve been watching it for a few years, since they were young teens,  <br/>
and they&#39;re not fragile in the language-and-concept areas.<br/>
<br/>
Any families with young kids or squeamishness about anything sexual  <br/>
or anatomical or religious or emotional might want to wait another  <br/>
ten years or so to pick up any Kevin Smith habits.<br/>
<br/>
Those who were already exposed and survived might really enjoy the  <br/>
DVDs of the question and answer sessions he does with students at  <br/>
universities.   And there&#39;s a great mime DVD menu on the first one.   <br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to say &quot;everyone go watch Kevin Smith movies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there might be a felony charge in there somewhere if I were.  <br/>
Interstate contribution to the warping of tiny little minds, at  <br/>
*least.*  (That last line would need to be read with a Cartman voice,  <br/>
but anyone who doesn&#39;t know the Cartman voice, PLEASE don&#39;t go watch  <br/>
South Park just to get that joke.  Oh my gosh, I&#39;ve mired myself in  <br/>
deep now.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about Sesame Street.  I LOVE Sesame Street, but can&#39;t get  <br/>
&quot;Frog in the Glen&quot; on playlist or iTunes or YouTube.  I have it on a  <br/>
cassette tape and a VHS homemade tape.  Those are practically  <br/>
inaccessible anymore.  You Tube has a fantastic Steve Wonder version  <br/>
of Superstition from the early 70&#39;s and at the end of the song they  <br/>
pick it up again and are Sesame Sesame Street to the music. Here.<br/>

Forget Jay and Silent Bob.  They may NOT lean outside the store on  <br/>
Sesame Street.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713749940">I am loving the Sesame Street connection!  I was at the library looking in<br/>
the free magazines that people bring in and I got 26 Sesame Street Parents&#39;<br/>
Guide magazines from the late 80&#39;s.  They should be interesting to read.  I<br/>
just glanced at one, looking at the advertisements and the clothes is so<br/>
funny.  Its &quot;schooly&quot; mostly but sure brings back memories of watching the<br/>
show that love so much.  I sit and watch an episode tomorrow just for fun!<br/>

p.s.  I just turned the page and there is a coupon for Kix cereal that<br/>
expired on 12/24/1989  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

No luck finding a DVD yet... it was Sesame street episode 2122 if that <br/>
helps...<br/>
<br/>
OOH! They do have dvds of the old school episodes from 1969 - 1974<br/>
though.<br/>
