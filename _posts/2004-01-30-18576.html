<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338397225">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
After MANY &quot;challenges&quot;, I&#39;m thrilled to announce:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                 THE BOOK IS HERE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra was so kind to take her precious time to read the rough and offer me <br/>
editing help plus her endorsement.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling Reflections, my self-published book about some of the <br/>
experiences I have had while un/homeschooling my five children (now ages 15-32) since <br/>
1981 is hot off the press! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to send you a copy.  You can order one at my website: <br/>
 www.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>
<br/>
My oldest two sons attended school through the fourth grade and kindergarten. <br/>
 After that none of the kids have gone to school until college.  My oldest <br/>
son now works as an accountant, the next one just graduated with a degree in <br/>
theatre - he&#39;s currently applying for grad school, the next son works as a <br/>
journeyman in the heating/AC field, my daughter attends community college majoring <br/>
in dance and music, and the youngest still learns at home. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the full responses which were edited to use for the book back cover <br/>
blurbs:<br/>
<br/>
Homeschool pioneer and author Connie Colten applied her <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t-let-them-see-you-shake&quot; theory to conquer her fear of taking the first step to homeschool in <br/>
California in 1981. Using an intimate journalized style, her book, <br/>
Homeschooling Reflections, provides a peek into the lives of her homeschooling family of <br/>
five children over two decades. It is riveting reading as she recounts <br/>
the fear, anxiety, joy, sorrow, and ultimately the celebrations of self-discovery <br/>
and self-directed learning when day-to-day life and education are naturally <br/>
entwined. This book provides an exceptional look at the constantly changing lives, <br/>
interests, and needs of a growing homeschool family. Read Homeschooling <br/>
Reflections and you&#39;ll rest assured that you too, can successfully homeschool your <br/>
children.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">    &gt; &gt;&gt; This book has something others miss:  the changes that take place in <br/>
&gt;&gt; a parent    who lives consciously and mindfully with children.  Natural <br/>
&gt;&gt; learning is quite different from &quot;school at home,&quot; and can be hard to explain or <br/>
&gt;&gt; imagine.   It comes not from &quot;what to do&quot; stories, but from considerations <br/>
&gt;&gt; of how to live.  Not all homeschoolers have models and mentors, but this <br/>
&gt;&gt; book can be the next best thing.  Not only are the Coltens&#39; lives shared, but <br/>
&gt;&gt; other homeschooling families have offered glimpses of their own herein as <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Connie Colton has bravely poured out her heart about her family life <br/>
homeschooling. As with many families, homeschooling for the Colton&#39;s <br/>
makes sense as they move often as a Military family. She tells us about <br/>
routine and special days, and how she, like many of us, become more <br/>
radical homeschoolers when threatening incidents occur, and it becomes <br/>
necessary to be part of The Movement to affect political changes. The <br/>
book reads like a blog, or online journal, though the messages are <br/>
sorted into logical topics. This is a rather new form of written <br/>
expression, which I think you will find refreshing and enjoyable.<br/>
