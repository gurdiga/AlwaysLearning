I LOVE these stories.<br/>
I love that a child can get to the age of 11 before she discovers how  <br/>
punitive the neighbors and relatives can be.<br/>

<br/>
I was defining grounding in my head as centering, as in &quot;that was a very grounding conversation&quot; so I couldn&#39;t figure out why your daughter thought it was pointless.  I still had to really think about it when you mentioned punishment and control before I had my AHA moment and realized what you were referring to.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is SO huge for me because I used to be a punitive parent and this is just proof to me that that mindset has been totally expunged from my thought process.  YAY!  <br/>

Grace and Peace!<br/>

    I&#39;m new to the group but I just had to say that when I first started reading this message, I didn&#39;t understand. <br/>
<br/>
  I was defining grounding in my head as centering, as in &quot;that was a very grounding conversation&quot; so I couldn&#39;t figure out why your daughter thought it was pointless. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

  cynthia - me TOO!! and then i started thinking electrical grounding - like a science question!  i was never grounded as a kid, nor have my kids been, but we&#39;ve had plenty of experience with it through my daughter&#39;s friends, as she&#39;s gotten older and her friends have branched out to be beyond the kids of my friends.   i don&#39;t think my son knew what grounding was until recently though, and even then, it was third hand because of my daughter&#39;s friend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303244853">Funny... when I read the title of your this post, I assumed the definition your daughter was inquiring about was &#39;coming down to earth&#39; as in grounding oneself... perhaps she would prefer that definition?  The other use of the word completely escaped me... and it sounds like it was lost on her too.... wonderful!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*laugh* Apparently that was a common interpretation and I didn&#39;t even think about that definition!  But it&#39;s a great example of the importance of saying (typing) ideas in very clear words.  Sorry!  :)<br/>
