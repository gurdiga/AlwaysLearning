<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805024822">This is from my husband&#39;s best friend&#39;s wife... (wow.. that was hard <br/>
to spit out....!)  Anyway...  I read the letter the first time and <br/>
thought... oh man, I am being set up big time.. then I read it again <br/>
and thought... ok, she is being open... maybe I could say <br/>
something...  I read it to my husband... (he just grinned...)<br/>
<br/>
I think she really just wants to tell me that she has a really smart <br/>
little boy and (as she should!) be very proud of him! I wrote to her <br/>
and sorta blew off much of her point and recmdedd John Holt&#39;s <br/>
Learning all the time... I said that with all kids born wanting to <br/>
aborb everything Holt believes that we should run with their <br/>
interests!  It is great that she sees that he craves learning...  <br/>
Any... any other books that you would rec to her along the lines as <br/>
to what she is talking about?   My dh suggested The Hurried <br/>
Child....  (still grinning of course...)<br/>
<br/>
thoughts?  here is her letter<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s (her son 17 months) a pretty exceptional little boy.  Since <br/>
you&#39;re so into home schooling I&#39;m sure you have lots of resources.  <br/>
Would you mind taking a few minutes and helping me find some.  I know <br/>
every mother says this but I swear Noah&#39;s IQ must be huge.  I taught <br/>
him how to count to ten already, and now we&#39;re working on the <br/>
alphabet (after just a few sessions he&#39;s already showing some <br/>
memorization).  He&#39;s also recognizing most of his colors and all of <br/>
his body parts even the hard ones.  I just feel like he&#39;s learning <br/>
everything so quickly that I don&#39;t want to slow down.  He&#39;s really <br/>
enjoying it so where can I go from here.  Are there books that I can <br/>
read to help me deal with an exceptional child?  My mother says I&#39;m <br/>
pushing him too hard but I feel like he&#39;s pushing me to learn new <br/>
things.  John agrees with me that Luke has a true love of learning.  <br/>
What do you think can you push a kid too hard when they are the <br/>
instigator?  If you can just point me in the direction of some <br/>
literature I&#39;ll be sure to read it.  <br/>
Thanks a million,<br/>
Shauna<br/>
Hey are you still home schooling?  I was just curious to know if this <br/>
was a permanent situation or what.  Obviously if you are it&#39;s working <br/>
well for you but let me know because I&#39;m curious how it works with <br/>
two kids of different ages</div>

<br/>
   &quot;Creative Homeschooling for Gifted Children&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are some of my favorites:<br/>
<br/>
   &quot;Magical Child&quot; by Joseph Chilton Pearce<br/>
   &quot;Homeschooling and the Voyage of Self-Discovery&quot; by David Albert<br/>
   &quot;Young at Art&quot; by Susan Striker<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You also might want to tell her about tagfam.org, they have a mailing list<br/>
for talented and gifted families.<br/>
