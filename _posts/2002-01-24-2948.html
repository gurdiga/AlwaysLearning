<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272804714">I must have missed your post about your health problems Karen, I am so sorry.<br/>
My Mom is fighting metasasized (sp?) breast cancer, it is so hard to see a <br/>
loved one deal with this.<br/>
I know there are so many options now and great alternative support, knowledge <br/>
is power when dealing with your health.<br/>
<br/>
I think in my dd&#39;s case (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s like this with Tamzin too?) it <br/>
definitely seems to be a &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk to you&quot; thing. She is very <br/>
outgoing and talkative with anyone she&#39;s comfortable with...which isn&#39;t a <br/>
whole lot of people. But it takes her a while to &quot;warm&quot; to people. They have <br/>
to be very famliar. Even a clerk at the grocery store we see every week <br/>
doesn&#39;t get a hello. She won&#39;t look at them but it seems very much to be a <br/>
shy behavior.<br/>
It bothers people though. They take it personally sometimes. And asking a <br/>
four y.o. a huge series of questions isn&#39;t very helpful. She has told me &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want to&quot; when I ask her why she won&#39;t talk to people. I&#39;ve even <br/>
explained that it makes some people feel bad because they just want to be her <br/>
friend, but it doesn&#39;t seem to make any difference.<br/>
It may have something to do with dh and I separating because it seems like it <br/>
started during that time.<br/>
Maybe her confidence will grow and she&#39;ll get over it....I wish I knew what <br/>
caused it.<br/>
<br/>
Ren, who definitely believes life begins at conception and murder is murder <br/>
but doesn&#39;t want a debate either.</div>

&gt;Abortions were &quot;outlawed&quot; by a Roman Catholic clergy in an attempt to <br/>
&gt;increase the number of members, I heard. So every anti-abortionist <br/>
&gt;who protests against others&#39; abortions is behaving as a Roman.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a complete mischaracterization of the Roman Catholic view of <br/>
life.  I&#39;m not Catholic, nor do I want to be, but I just had to point <br/>
that out.<br/>

means pre-Christian, in which case this makes no sense; didn&#39;t Romans deal<br/>
with their unwanted children by straight-forward infanticide?<br/>
