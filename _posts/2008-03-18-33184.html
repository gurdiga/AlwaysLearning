<div id="ygrps-yiv-810779068">&quot;Be careful with words and thoughts on this list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote that and deleted it from another post.<br/>
<br/>
I dropped that line of exploration somewhere else, but here I&#39;m going  <br/>
to go down a couple of trails.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful with words and thoughts in your whole life.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
enough to mindfully make choices about what to do; make choices about  <br/>
what to say (or write), and how, and when.   Listen to the words your  <br/>
subconscious is offering up for you to speak.  What are you  <br/>
thinking!?  (Nobody needs to tell us what they&#39;re thinking, but it&#39;s  <br/>
good when you&#39;re at least wondering, to yourself, what you&#39;re  <br/>
thinking. &lt;g&gt;  Especially when posting about your children in public.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And for the purposes of this list, it&#39;s often much more valuable when  <br/>
someone is NOT careful with words and thoughts and they give us  <br/>
something to poke at, turn over, examine and analyze.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And so I will rephrase:<br/>
<br/>
If you (the reader) don&#39;t want what you write to reveal things you  <br/>
didn&#39;t intend to reveal, be careful with words on this list.<br/>
<br/>
If you want help discovering how confusing thoughts are blocking your  <br/>
ability to think clearly, pour it on out here and people will poke at  <br/>
your words, turn them over, examine and analyze.<br/>
<br/>
If you think that sounds horrible, don&#39;t post.<br/>
<br/>
If you think it sounds wonderful but you don&#39;t want it done to YOUR  <br/>
words, read but don&#39;t post.<br/>
<br/>
If you think it&#39;s horrible and should never be done anywhere, scoot.   <br/>
There are other lists.<br/>
<br/>
For any purposes in your entire life, private or public, choose your  <br/>
words.  Don&#39;t be bullied by your own unconscious thoughts!<br/>
<br/>
