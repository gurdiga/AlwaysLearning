<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761261327">Hi all,<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted in a very long time. I&#39;m more of a lurker, I guess.<br/>
I would like to get recommendations for unschooling conferences that <br/>
are fun for the whole family (ds 11, dd 7) to go to.<br/>
Warnings about where not to go are appreciated too!<br/>
We have been to Rethinking Education several times and may want to <br/>
go there again (although it is now in Sep.), but we&#39;d like to see <br/>
what else is available.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sybelle</div>
