<div id="ygrps-yiv-315192107"><html><head></head>I wrote this in another discussion that only has moms. &nbsp;It&#39;s been rough this week beause some moms complained harshly about husbands, and wanted (said so) &quot;support&quot;—wanted agreement, sympathy, &quot;empathy,&quot; in their insulting rants.<div><br></div><div>I held back a lot, but still was insulted by some who make it a habit to insult me (and perhaps others, but sometimes it seems personal). &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Probably it is true that some people do NOT see why agreeing with someone who has just pretty much said her husband sucks and is ruining her life, but she doesn&#39;t want a divorce, is in any way a problem for their children or unschooling. &nbsp; I get tired around people who can&#39;t perceive the difference between down and up, between negative and positive, between hurts and helps.</div><div><br></div><div>But I wrote something (in a new topic there, which may or may not help someone) this, and I thought my best writing should always be HERE, not other places.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>With apologies to those for whom it will be a repeat, i think this is valuable:</div><div>_______________________________</div><div><br></div><div><p style="margin:0px 0px 6px;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:19px;text-align:left;">Antagonism is a problem for any family, but for an unschooling family it will keep unschooling small and ineffectual. &quot;Be his partner, not his adversary&quot; was what I heard at the first La Leche League meeting I attended, and it helped more than anything else in my life to make relationships with my children, and their learning, wonderful.</p><p style="margin:6px 0px;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:19px;text-align:left;">Extending that to my husband wasn&#39;t as easy and not as &quot;automatic,&quot; but shouldn&#39;t it have been? Didn&#39;t I swear in front of our relatives and friends to live with him for life? I didn&#39;t swear to be his enemy, the thwarter of his desires, or the boss of him. And that&#39;s not about religion. It&#39;s about being his partner, not his adversary.</p><p style="margin:6px 0px;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:19px;text-align:left;">My entry point in any of these discussions is what&#39;s good for an unschooling family—what is good for the children. Parents who can work together to make their kids&#39; lives great have—because of that—a common project and a shared success.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin:6px 0px;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:19px;text-align:left;">I have no interest in supporting less than that, or other than that. To side with a mother against the dad is siding against what is good for the children.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin:6px 0px 0px;display:inline;color:rgb(20, 24, 35);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:19px;text-align:left;">When a mom or dad asks unschoolers to side with the parent against the children, we EASILY remind them to be their child&#39;s facilitator and helper and support. WHY and how could anyone who already sees that part of peace and prosperity not also want to extend it from mom to partner (of whatever gender, married or not)?</p><div><br></div></div><div>Sandra</div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447581478">This group, Sandra&#39;s words and all the great advice givers here have also helped me through this topic ...<br><br>I can&#39;t remember the exact words, or if the topic was family or divorce related but the main point was that peace is important. If your true aim is peace then things tend to fall into place.&nbsp;<span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">Being peaceful is still something I need to &#39;turn on&#39; everyday. I hope that one day it&#39;s more natural of a feeling, but for now, it gives me some good ideas on how to help my kids turn it on when they want to.<br><br>My son&#39;s father and I split up when my son was only 1 and I had a lot of people saying to me that my little baby wouldn&#39;t &quot;be affected&quot; by it at all, since he was so young. That never made any sense to me. It directly affected me and my son is there, seeing it and most likely feeling it too.<br><br>I was drawn to this group trying to steer away from people&#39;s advice telling me that my son was just a little empty vessel waiting to be filled. That way of thinking, that children are these empty robots waiting to be programmed has always bothered me, and I was relieved to find other people that disagreed as much as I did with the notion.&nbsp;<br><br>Since then, I have learned that my son absolutely should have as much of a relationship with his dad as he does with me. His father and I didn&#39;t make a good pair, per our own struggles, but my son deserves to experience a relationship with someone who shares the same emotional ups and downs, personal likes and dislikes, etc. I find happiness in seeing my son&#39;s relationship with his dad. It brings so much peace to my house, to my son, to myself. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

My experience is a spouse who is a firm believer in the gospel of schooling. &quot;The kids should be in school.&quot; &quot;Kids who don&#39;t go to school end up in jail.&quot; &quot;They aren&#39;t learning anything.&quot; &quot;They should be reading by now, doing math worksheets, learning school survival skills, getting up early, etc.&quot; &quot;You are hurting our kids by ruining their future.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re brainwashing yourself by reading all that stuff, and now you&#39;re brainwashing our kids.&quot; </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679">He even takes it to the kids. &quot;You aren&#39;t learning anything.&quot; &quot;You need to be in school.&quot; etc. I compromised at first, I sent the kids to school a couple of years, I opened my mind and dove all in and let go of my own beliefs. But after watching them struggle to &quot;keep up,&quot; and lose their love for learning and life, I just couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I couldn&#39;t physically drive them to school, the thought made me ill.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679"> I apologized to my husband and offered him several books, videos, short essays to read that explained my point of view. But he only sampled a few, and disagreed with them. </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679">I have been unschooling the kids by myself. It is a very me and the kids vs. dad type of environment. How can we change this? This has been a very win/lose marriage as of late. I don&#39;t believe in spanking, he does.(I put my foot down and will not allow spanking, and he resents me for it.) </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679">Once upon a time we were on the same page. We used to listen to parenting CDs together and we stood together against our traditional family and friends. But then he changed back to his old beliefs, I don&#39;t know why. I became MORE radical. He said he changed back because he basically lost faith in me and my ability to teach and raise our children properly as he watched our daughter fail to learn to read, then watched our second child struggling with me homeschooling as well. </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-104667465ygrps-yiv-1963979679">He was trying to follow me because I seemed so sure. But he didn&#39;t hold the beliefs firmly for himself. He felt betrayed in that trust watching us struggle, and seeing me uncertain of what to do for awhile. I found my answer in unschooling. But he felt like the answer was to go back to what he felt was &#39;safe.&#39; He and I split beliefs there and have continued to travel separate paths of thought. </div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106462636"><p dir="ltr">Further to the Gatto recommendation,  while the best of the living unschooling books and posts are written by the Moms who have been doing it every day for years, there&#39;s some male writers who go more toward theory and why, with credentials/background that might be useful for some of the skeptical Dads. I was the Dad leading the charge, and some of them spoke to me. Strew some of these,  depending on his learning style.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gatto, as a teacher</p>
<p dir="ltr">Peter Gray as a psychology professor, writing at Psychology Today, and his articles touch on a bunch of different aspects and can be read online instead of pushing a book on a resistant husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carlo Ricci as a professor of education and unschooling Dad, who also has videos in addition to the journal of alternative education he coordinates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">John Holt as a math teacher trying to make school work better, or at all, initially,  then evolving into an unschooling proponent over the course of his books</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leo Babauta, not as some academic expert, but a blogger and entrepreneur, who writes mindfully and peacefully about why unschooling made sense for his family, preparing for life and work the way it exists today. He has an intro at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://zenhabits.net">zenhabits.net</a> that is great for dads with an entreprenurial bent, and expands on ideas at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschoolery.com">www.unschoolery.com</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Find the bits from those sources that can work for where he is now. Intro mite later. And don&#39;t start with (this group of women on the internet told me X). You don&#39;t want to get his back up, or make it Always Learning + you  vs him. (Yes, this group is fantastic, but mentioning that can be counter productive)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Good luck with the Dads, connecting the right ideas to them so they can start their own deschooling, at a pace and on a twisting route very different from yours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cheers, <br>
Jamie (the Dad)<br>
