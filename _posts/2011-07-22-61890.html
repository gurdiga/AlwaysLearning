Had to grab?<br/>
Pull the headphones OUT of her head?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your reaction caused her to be more fearful than if you had been a little more calm.  It&#39;s late for that now, and tornados are scary, no doubt, but the description as it was sounds like you were angry at your daughter and the headphones and the computer.   She didn&#39;t cause the tornado.  Was she made to feel that she caused the problem or made the problem awful, just because she was on the computer?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s afraid after  a traumatic experience will likely gradually and eventually feel better.  Holly was in a car accident that wasn&#39;t her fault, and it was a while before she wanted to drive again.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now my daughter had develop this fear of wind and thunders<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a common aftermath of being traumatized. What will help is lots  <br/>
of big sympathetic hugs (or whatever she finds most comforting) and  <br/>
empowerment. That&#39;s won&#39;t make her feelings go away. It will avoid  <br/>
making the processing of it more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to fix her. She&#39;s not broken. She&#39;s doing what she needs to  <br/>
do to internalize what happened and it could be about anything life  <br/>
might throw at her. A fire. A car accident. A animal dying. When she&#39;s  <br/>
having problems be sympathetic and soothing. Hug her. Be a big  <br/>
comforting pillow she can snuggle into that won&#39;t try to talk her out  <br/>
of her fears. Create a comforting nest around her rather than trying  <br/>
to change her insides.<br/>
<br/>
Help her to become knowledgeable about tornado response. If she&#39;d  <br/>
like, have her make the plans for the family of what everyone should  <br/>
do if there&#39;s another tornado. Where are the safest parts of the  <br/>
house? What should you keep stocked?<br/>
<br/>
A big part of fears is feeling powerless. Knowledge can help her feel  <br/>
she does have some control.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but we can&#39;t afford in a 100 degrees to have the windows close and  <br/>
&gt; the a/c off also<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve got some of my windows closed (to keep the heat out) and no A/C.  <br/>
We use fans. (Though obviously they would create a much bigger breeze!)<br/>
<br/>
Having a ridge vent in the roof installed was a *big* help in our  <br/>
previous house. While it would get warm during the day, it cooled off  <br/>
much faster at night. That&#39;s not just a response to her fears, but a  <br/>
practical thing that could lower your A/C bill.<br/>

<br/>
What are you saying to her? If you&#39;re saying &quot;its okay, don&#39;t be scared&quot; then stop saying that ;) its not helping. Something terrible and scary happened. It&#39;s okay to still be scared a couple months later. Have you talked about being scared? That might help if you haven&#39;t done it already. Joyce suggested making emergency plans - that&#39;s a good idea, too. <br/>
<br/>
When Ray was 4, he was in an auto accident - not a bad one, but the truck rolled over into a local creek. For months he played games involving car crashes. Have you done any playing with wind at all? Gone kite flying or held paper air-planes over the a/c to watch the wind push them? That might interest her - or if it scares her all over again, its a chance to talk about it in a new way, say something you haven&#39;t said before.  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;she is always looking at the weather channel<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might help to have the weather channel on when she gets up - have it on somewhere in the house all day. Or you could get a weather radio that makes a loud noise when there&#39;s bad weather coming. <br/>
<br/>
It could help to get some books on clouds and how to &quot;read&quot; the weather from clouds and other signs. It could help to look at the big national maps on the weather channel and show her what a front looks like, what indicates rain or a super-cell. It might even help - in the sense of her understanding tornados better - to get some documentary movies about tornados and storms. It could be reassuring to watch &quot;storm chasers&quot; and see them Not get hit by one tornado after another, to give her a sense that they aren&#39;t everywhere all the time. <br/>
<br/>
But its still okay for her to be scared, too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490487018">Sounds like a scary incident! I&#39;m sorry you guys had to experience it.<br/>
It might be helpful for you to contact your local red cross. They<br/>
might have some groups of people that might be meeting to talk about<br/>
tornados, or their experiences, and your daughter might find it<br/>
healing to understand that her fears and feelings are normal reactions<br/>
to a strange event.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930187020">Wow, how scary for everyone!  I don&#39;t want to sound like a public service<br/>
announcement.... BUT, one way to give all of you a sense of control is to<br/>
have an emergency plan, maybe even several for different types of<br/>
emergencies.  There are lots of good suggestions on the homeland security<br/>
web site and they aren&#39;t too &quot;here comes armegeddon&quot; (if you get my<br/>
meaning).  Learning about weather in general and dangerous weather in<br/>
specific  AND the real risks--lots more people are hurt by cars than<br/>
tornadoes, may go a long way to quell fears.  We learned about how to<br/>
recognize tornado warnings and sounds and I am in Maryland (hardly tornado<br/>
alley) when I was in school.  You might also want to look at the history of<br/>
when tornadoes hit and where on the national weather service site and see<br/>
that very few tornadoes occur where you are.<br/>
<br/>
Playing out the incident, if she chooses, is one way to normalize an<br/>
incident and to allow her to process the feelings.  I was a therapist back<br/>
in another life.  Let her be the driver of the play.  Certainly let her know<br/>
that talking about it and telling the story is okay, and the feelings are<br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
You can learn about different kinds of wind--I would get a wind toy, and you<br/>
can use an electric fan or a/c, blow on it or take it outside and see if it<br/>
will move.  Talk about how only natural wind comes from a tornado and that<br/>
they are very rare.  Don&#39;t try to paint the truth better or worse, but the<br/>
facts are really not that bad since even with the increased activity that<br/>
they predict tornadoes are still very rare in your area.  You might be able<br/>
to find stories about tornado alley and talk about how many people have<br/>
lived there for years through lots of tornadoes and have been able to tell<br/>
the tale because of careful planning and alertness.  Learning about the<br/>
warning systems that are in your area would probably be good for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I am sure that she will be able to move on and have a normal<br/>
life, I would think that it could take a few months, maybe even 6, but<br/>
probably less.<br/>
