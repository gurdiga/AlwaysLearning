 There are unschoolers making it work in every state.  A couple are famously <br/>
 irritating (Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, and a few others have <br/>
 peculiarities but also have trailblazers to follow), but most are simple. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I am still trying to figure out why FL is on the bad list.<br/>
It&#39;s easy here.....easier than OR actually.<br/>
All you have to do is pay $10 per year to sign up under an umbrella school <br/>
and nobody ever bothers you again.<br/>
Or just ignore the laws...that worked for me. snark, snark.<br/>

Because you have to pay $10 and find an umbrella school! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

NO, not at all. The umbrella schools can be started by anyone!! The ones I <br/>
recommend to unschoolers are RUN by unschoolers to simply help them fulfill <br/>
the law if they wish.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021861817">Just saying hello, I&#39;m new to homeschooling/unschooling and am <br/>
listening in to see how it is &quot;done&quot; IRL. I have 2.5 yo b/g twins that <br/>
I am currently homeschooling/unschooling in that we have decided not <br/>
to send them to preschool like almost everyone does here in our area <br/>
of NY. Over the past couple of years as I find my way as a new parent <br/>
I am finding that I particularly like advice/wisdom given from parents <br/>
who did or are currently unschooling b/c they are so child-friendly <br/>
and respectful. I have also been told several times by some <br/>
acquantainces who are former teachers that I am probably more of an <br/>
unschooler when they learn how we parent our kids. So, here I am to <br/>
listen and learn if I am indeed an unschooler as they said &lt;G&gt; and to <br/>
see where this journey will take us if it is so. -Arlynn</div>

Someone just left another list I&#39;m on with the parting shot that we  <br/>
weren&#39;t as nice to him as we claimed to be to our children.<br/>
<br/>
Well... yeah.  But I expect adults to get their own glass of water  <br/>
and do their own butt-wipe.<br/>
<br/>
Just picking up that little bit to make a general point, Arlynn--it&#39;s  <br/>
not to or about you at all.  The conversations here are toward the  <br/>
group and for the group, and anything anyone throws out there is  <br/>
likely to be dissected and laid out in the unschooling light.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE advice and wisdom from unschooling parents.  There&#39;s a book  <br/>
out by Rue Kream that would probably be perfect for you if you&#39;re new  <br/>
to this (and one by me that might help, but Rue&#39;s is great for people  <br/>
with really young children).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a list specifically for parents of very young children, too,  <br/>
you might want to join instead of or in addition to this one.   <br/>

didn&#39;t know that.  I&#39;m just now learning the ins and outs of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949274857">On www.yahoo.com there is a front page news item about a 4 yo in India who<br/>
drives. It links to a video of the boy and his dad, and his dad&#39;s<br/>
description about how the boy asked to learn to drive and so he started<br/>
teaching him the next day. He now drives their van all around with the dad<br/>
in the car.<br/>
<br/>
The video is a little scary actually, with the boy looking at his dad for<br/>
long periods of time while he&#39;s driving, but it was very cool to hear the<br/>
dad describe how it came to be. The boy asked and the dad responded. Didn&#39;t<br/>
spend time thinking &quot;this is bad for you&quot; &quot;you&#39;re not old enough&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The roads in India look kinda scary to drive on in general in the video<br/>
though...maybe there are few regulations, like an age to learn to drive?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018071553">Hi There,<br/>
I have been educating my 5 kids at home for over 18 years and I can<br/>
see we are shifting from &quot;homeschooled&quot; to unschoolers. I was really<br/>
encouraged to find Sandra&#39;s site on unschooling, as I read all the<br/>
different things I thought &quot;wow, our family has had all the symptoms<br/>
of unschoolers for years now&quot; honestly I am very excited and relieved<br/>
about my discoveries so far and look forward to learning more from you<br/>
who have known you are &quot;unschoolers&quot; all along. I have tended to be<br/>
critical of myself and my kids in the way we&#39;ve been approaching<br/>
&quot;school&quot; recently, but now I am beginning to see that its just time to<br/>
remove a layer of wrong beliefs about how my kids are learning.<br/>
/sigh/...this is good!<br/>

These kinds of discussions often get quieter near holidays, so don&#39;t  <br/>
expect much this week but it will perk up sometimes and ovewhelm you  <br/>
some other times. In the meantime, there are lots of trails to follow  <br/>
if you go to the other writers and sites listed at the bottom of  <br/>

<br/>
I have a friend, 23, male (not a parent and not involved with  <br/>
homeschooling) who was over talking to me about improving his life.   <br/>
A few months ago I took him out in the yard and showed him some grass  <br/>
growing where we didn&#39;t plant any, and some of the trees I grew from  <br/>
seed, and some plants we were given, and told him we didn&#39;t work hard  <br/>
on the yard, we just pulled the weeds, and watered, and gradually all  <br/>
these things grew.   I told him if he just weeded out his bad habits,  <br/>
good stuff would appear.<br/>
<br/>
This week I read a similar thing in a book, that people have mental  <br/>
health inside them, if they just weed out the things that are unhealthy.<br/>
<br/>
Same with unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461292536">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group and thought I would introduce myself. I&#39;m not<br/>
usually a big poster when it comes to my groups, but I do tend to read<br/>
and follow along with then posts a lot. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve decided to join this group in order to facilitate my<br/>
decision-making progress. I only have one child so far and he&#39;s only<br/>
13 months, so any kind of schooling decisions are a little ways away.<br/>
Before he was born my thoughts were public school all the way. While<br/>
pregnant, my thinking evolved to &quot;maybe homeschooling.&quot; Now I&#39;ve been<br/>
at &quot;definitely homeschooling&quot; for awhile. But I&#39;m also in the<br/>
territory of &quot;perhaps unschooling&quot;. I hope I&#39;m making sense to someone<br/>
besides just me!<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, my thinking regarding schooling has been in transition for<br/>
some time. I&#39;d really like to explore unschooling. The idea fascinates<br/>
me as I LOVE to learn and am constantly reading up on things that<br/>
interest me and taking on projects that require me to learn new<br/>
skills. That&#39;s what&#39;s natural to me. I remember feeling very jaded as<br/>
a student even though I was a &quot;good student.&quot; I just felt so tired of<br/>
learning what everyone else thought I should learn, instead of what<br/>
interested me.<br/>
<br/>
So, now I&#39;m researching unschooling for the sake of my little one, so<br/>
that I can make a choice that will be best for him and that will<br/>
preserve his love of learning and zest for life.</div>
