<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014248935">I just thought I would let you all know that the Vilter family has been<br/>
making progress in our world.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout my life my mother has always been supportive of my endeavors.<br/>
However, there has often been a &quot;but &lt;fill in worry here&gt;&quot; expression of her<br/>
concerns. It comes along with her support if she feels strongly enough about<br/>
the subject. So when I told her we were homeschooling she thought Matthew<br/>
would end up smart enough - but how would he learn to deal with difficult<br/>
people and function in a group and be able to work all the jerks he will end<br/>
up working with professionally? I tried all my discussion and persuasion<br/>
techniques to help her see that we were all going to be better people going<br/>
this route. Discussion would go back and forth but I&#39;ve known that it was a<br/>
serious worry to her. It even broke down at one point where, in a<br/>
discussion, as heated as they get with her, I said that I should send him to<br/>
prison to see to her concerns.  So I just stopped talking with her about<br/>
that particular aspect of Matthew&#39;s development.<br/>
<br/>
When I started discussing Unschooling concepts I could see that same worried<br/>
tension behind her eyes. I knew this was too big a jump for her to make. So<br/>
I backed off and have never gotten to discuss or explain our motivations for<br/>
taking this path.   She was very concerned when he wasn&#39;t reading at age<br/>
ten. And questioned &quot;how does he learn History?&quot; - Knowing that it was never<br/>
a subject I excelled at in public school. [And perhaps leading me to infer<br/>
&quot;who would study history if there wasn&#39;t a class requiring it.&quot;]<br/>
<br/>
Matthew is now 13 years old.  He can sit down with a novel and not look up<br/>
until it&#39;s done.  He practically begs me to read history books to him<br/>
because it&#39;s interesting and a fun thing we do together.  Most importantly,<br/>
he has grown into being a pleasant person who is sensitive and can deal with<br/>
difficult people on his own, something he has proven to my mother during<br/>
discussion with my father.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I was driving my mother home from a doctor&#39;s appointment.  I had a<br/>
printout of an article that Sandra had posted here about a month ago called<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s work to stop snuffing out the joys of learning &quot; by Andrew Hanson.<br/>
The article talks about the damage formal schooling does to the passion for<br/>
learning through study. It describes how formal schooling changes the active<br/>
learners we all are at the start of our lives, into passive, disinterested,<br/>
learners.  I had passed it around our Park day group and it was still in my<br/>
car.  I don&#39;t normally pass on information that blatantly bashes schooling<br/>
to my mother who retired from the Los Angeles city school district a few<br/>
years back.  But this article was written by a teacher, a Fulbright Exchange<br/>
Teacher, and touches on many key concepts of unschooling. And I thought<br/>
maybe she could see that Jocelyn and I (and Unschooling) are part of the<br/>
revolution of schooling Hanson calls for. And that the outcomes are clearly<br/>
illustrated in her grandson...        So I asked her if she wanted to read<br/>
any more homeschooling propaganda. And she replied &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think I need<br/>
any more propaganda, I am already convinced that you&#39;ve made the right<br/>
choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        Well, knock me over with a feather.<br/>

mother, let alone my mother-in-law. (she is a teacher)<br/>
When she realised I hadn&#39;t taken my kids out of school so I could <br/>
hot-house them in maths and physics, she had a little turn. She <br/>
wants to know how they will become world renowned scientists if I <br/>
don&#39;t have a laboratory in my basement.....<br/>
The fact that they are not interested in science (and she may have <br/>
turned them off) is an anathema to her. Physics and maths are the <br/>
goal of all rational beings. They are the only careers worth pursuing <br/>
etc etc.<br/>
Her son is a mathematician. I sometimes wonder if he would have <br/>
liked to have been an artist.<br/>

Q.  When the devil tempted Jesus after his 40 day fast (40 days would kill anyone) what form did the devil take and is he still roaming the earth as we speak? <br/>
A. It is quite clear from scripture (Satan showing Jesus all the Kingdoms and offering them) that Lucifer took the form of a ReMax RealtorÂ®</div>

would be thrilled if Tamzin went to school.<br/>
My  (ex) in-laws are worried and baffled by my homeschooling.  <br/>
MIL is a retired Latin teacher and FIL is a retired headmaster and <br/>
both taught in public schools (that&#39;s private schools in <br/>
Amerispeak &lt;g&gt;).  Their son (my ex) rebelled and is a musician, <br/>
much to their horror.  MIL once said to me, &quot;We wasted our <br/>
money on a public school education for Chris, he&#39;s done nothing <br/>
with his life.&quot;!  Of course I had to then list some of the many <br/>
things he has accomplished in his life (like maybe happiness <br/>
and personal fulfilment, what a concept!).<br/>
