<div id="ygrps-yiv-547476198"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>think it&#39;s just as important to discuss how to transfer your values to<br/>
your children... does anyone seriously think it&#39;s not desireable? or just<br/>
not possible? or what? You actually can&#39;t help transferring at least some<br/>
values, so why not to do more of it, or should everyone conscientiously<br/>
try to do less of it?   &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think much about &quot;transfering&quot; my values to my kids. I do think about <br/>
what kind of values they are developing. <br/>
<br/>
This might seem like semantics - but I think there is a world of difference <br/>
in practice.<br/>
