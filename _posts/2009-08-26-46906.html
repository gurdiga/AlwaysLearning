<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569230570">A quote, about food, and a tie-in to Hitler.<br/>
<br/>
-=-On my 21st birthday, I woke up in the morning and drove to Dairy  <br/>
Queen.  I got soft serve vanilla ice cream with strawberry topping and  <br/>
I ate it for breakfast.  Why?  When I was a child I asked once if I  <br/>
could have ice cream for breakfast, and my mother said, �You can have  <br/>
ice cream for breakfast when you�re 21.�  And so I did.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the first paragraph of some writing about a man whose father  <br/>
was in a German prisoner-of-war camp.  That part is not about  <br/>
unschooling, though it is largely about food, and has some limitation  <br/>
of TV...  it&#39;s of slight interest,  unschoolingwise.<br/>
<br/>
But what I wanted to remind people of was that freedom is relative,  <br/>
and desires shouldn&#39;t be discounted just because it could be worse.   <br/>
The parents might have thought &quot;at least he&#39;s not a prisoner of war.&quot;   <br/>
But it wouldn&#39;t have hurt to have let him have some ice cream in  <br/>
childhood instead of putting it in his mind for over a decade that  <br/>
when he was 21 he could have ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure the mother thought it was for his own good.  Alice Miller  <br/>
studied Hitler and other WWII German leaders.  They were raised  <br/>
harshly, for their own good.<br/>
