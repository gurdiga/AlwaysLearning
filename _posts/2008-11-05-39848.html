<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863236303">First I have side-comments on this, for the benefit of newer readers  <br/>
to the list, mostly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Other friend comment about how &quot;far<br/>
behind&quot; they are. They are almost teenagers and they can&#39;t read, do<br/>
basic addition or subtraction, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Almost teenagers&quot; all at once?  I had an 11 year old who couldn&#39;t  <br/>
read.  Was she &quot;almost a teenager&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby first went to take a math course, he could figure  <br/>
percentages and do easy algebra in his head, but when he saw it on  <br/>
paper (traditional vertical layouts for addition and subtraction;  <br/>
equations) he didn&#39;t know what it was.  So some people might have  <br/>
said he couldn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; basic addition or subtraction.<br/>
<br/>
But you now these kids.  Can they do real-world addition and  <br/>
subtraction?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know that wasn&#39;t the main thrust of the question, but as I read it  <br/>
I was a little worried about the thoughts of those who are here to  <br/>
figure out what unschooling is and isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll respond to the real issue in another post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-870461181">-=-she still tells people that she unschools like I do-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been helping (and trying to help) unschoolers for a dozen years  <br/>
now (more, I guess) and twice a very sad thing has happened.  A mom  <br/>
called and asked if I could help her in court, in a divorce and  <br/>
custody situation.<br/>
<br/>
The answer was no.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like saying &quot;No, you&#39;re on your own,&quot; but the profoundest  <br/>
truth is that every unschooler is on her own.  It&#39;s homeschooling.   <br/>
For someone to choose to unschool instead of using a curriculum, she  <br/>
needs to REALLY get it.  She needs to understand, herself, what it is  <br/>
and why and how it works, and then she needs to create an environment  <br/>
in which is IS working, for sure, for real, right in her house.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no signing up and then slacking off and then having &quot;the  <br/>
company&quot; or &quot;the tribe&quot; (I don&#39;t like that term at all, but for those  <br/>
who use and understand it, this will make sense) or &quot;unschooling  <br/>
experts&quot; come and save her or say &quot;Yes, she&#39;s really unschooling and  <br/>
unschooling works.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s more like AA.  It works if you work it.<br/>
If someone is court ordered to stop drinking, or just wants to stop  <br/>
drinking, saying &quot;I&#39;m an AA member&quot; does not mean squat.  There&#39;s  <br/>
drinking (with or without AA attendance) and there&#39;s not drinking  <br/>
(with or without AA).<br/>
<br/>
And so someone can be on a list for two years or ten years and still  <br/>
be a crappy unschooler (if an unschooler at all).<br/>
There  have been cases of people being on this list or others like it  <br/>
for years, literally.  Two years, three.  Four.  And then they&#39;ll say  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m still thinking about it&quot; or &quot;We haven&#39;t really started  <br/>
unschooling.&quot;  And then there are others who claim they ARE  <br/>
unschooling, but like your friend, they&#39;re just kinda basking in the  <br/>
attention and not changing their lives.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a newcomer to this list but have been mostly lurking on other<br/>
unschooling lists for two years.<br/>
<br/>
The situation of Harmony&#39;s friend raises an important question for me.<br/>
Just how dedicated, in terms of time, do you need to be in order to do<br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I have been unschooling with daughters Sofia (5 this<br/>
month) and Nora (2 1/2) for two years since taking S out of preschool.<br/>
My partner works 1/2 time outside the home, and I work from home as a<br/>
freelancer (which varies from being pretty busy to not busy at all).<br/>
We are also in the slow process of building a house, which is a great<br/>
but time-consuming adventure for us.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I am really passionate about unschooling (my partner less<br/>
so) I/we often feel that I/we really don&#39;t have enough time to spend<br/>
with the girls. Some days I have to tell them &quot;listen, I really need<br/>
to work, you will have to look after yourselves for a while.&quot; (Today<br/>
was one of those days, by the way.) I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m always patient<br/>
with them on days like this, but the fact is I&#39;m often feeling grumpy<br/>
and resentful, and I&#39;m sure it shows. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m just<br/>
being selfish and neglectful by keeping them at home when I can&#39;t<br/>
dedicate enough time to them.<br/>
<br/>
Hell, I&#39;ve wanted to post questions or ask for support to unschooling<br/>
lists at least thirty times in the past two years and haven&#39;t had time<br/>
to properly formulate them.<br/>
<br/>
I should say that I/we do many, many different things with the girls<br/>
(parks, museums, playing games, gardening, rollerblading/biking,<br/>
beach, walks in the woods, looking for creepy crawlies, etc.) so it&#39;s<br/>
not a case of my being slothful and uninterested like Harmony&#39;s<br/>
friend, but rather the sheer pressure of time and the feeling of not<br/>
having enough to spend with them.<br/>
<br/>
This September, my partner wanted S to try the small local school in<br/>
the village near where we&#39;re building the house (previously she went<br/>
to preschool in the city). S was very reluctant to go but my partner<br/>
insisted, and I felt that, especially as this was an exceptionally<br/>
busy time for us, it wouldn&#39;t be such a terrible idea for her to<br/>
experience school for a while, mornings only. After struggling for a<br/>
week, she turned out to like it, and is actually keen to go most days.<br/>
This is very different from our experience with the city school, where<br/>
she had to be dragged out of the door. <br/>
<br/>
In fact Nora, who has to do _everything_ her big sister does (anyone<br/>
else have a toddler like that?), is upset because she&#39;s too little to<br/>
go to school. <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m now in the position of a passionate advocate of unschooling<br/>
with two daughters who actually (in one case, desperately) _want_ to<br/>
go to school. <br/>
<br/>
I tell myself it&#39;s temporary, this is the best year for her to try<br/>
school, next year they start getting heavy with curricula and<br/>
homework, by then the house should be nearing completion and I can<br/>
devote more time to the girls. But realistically, I know I have other<br/>
things that I want to do in life (writing and ecological design are my<br/>
passions), not all of which can be done with the girls, so I question<br/>
whether, even in the hypothetical absence of the need to earn a<br/>
living, I would be happy as a full-time unschooling dad. Does this<br/>
mean I should just give up and let the school system take over?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, for what it&#39;s worth, we live in Northern Spain, in an area<br/>
where there&#39;s not much support for unschooling, although we know a lot<br/>
more people who are into the idea now than we did two years ago, thank<br/>
heaven.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always worked part time as a consultant, college teacher and in  <br/>
other part-time jobs, and my husband full time. Plus, I&#39;ve spent a LOT  <br/>
of time on volunteer work - starting up organizations such as the  <br/>
National Home Education Network, being on the board of our state  <br/>
homeschooling organization, helping run our state conference, speaking  <br/>
about homeschooling. I&#39;ve also done a lot of volunteer work that  <br/>
involved the kids - Girl Scout leader, 4-H project leader, and lots  <br/>
and lots of homeschool events and activities.<br/>
<br/>
I really think people who are high-energy multi-tasking types CAN  <br/>
unschool successfully and do a whole lot of other stuff. Your work set- <br/>
up sounds really good. Is it demanding and tiring? Yes. Expect that. I  <br/>
bet you wouldn&#39;t settle for a lifestyle that wasn&#39;t demanding and  <br/>
tiring, anyway, &lt;G&gt; If it is making you resentful, though, then I&#39;d  <br/>
look for a solution to that.  I know that when I was doing a lot of  <br/>
consulting from home, the frustration for me was that I&#39;d be focused  <br/>
on something and be interrupted - over and over. I would really start  <br/>
to feel I desperately wanted a few straight non-interrupted hours.  <br/>
Perhaps you could find someone else to spend some time with the kids  <br/>
every day or three days a week - maybe to take them on outings. That  <br/>
would give you some hours of time that you could count on to devote to  <br/>
work. I had this and it was really helpful - my mom was a high school  <br/>
teacher and had a student who was looking for part-time work. She came  <br/>
every day after school and played for a few hours with my then-3 year  <br/>
old and little baby while I worked from home.<br/>

<br/>
It depends how old the kids are, in part.  And don&#39;t hesitate to  <br/>
&quot;double-dip.&quot;  If you&#39;re building a house, are the girls around  <br/>
seeing that as it happens, and asking questions, and maybe getting to  <br/>
help or watch or make suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I/we often feel that I/we really don&#39;t have enough time to spend  <br/>
with the girls. Some days I have to tell them &quot;listen, I really need  <br/>
to work, you will have to look after yourselves for a while.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
One thing to compare it to is a school  year.  It might be different  <br/>
where you are, but here, it&#39;s 180 days a year, six hours a day, at  <br/>
most, for instruction.  And of course it&#39;s less, because there&#39;s a  <br/>
ton of administrative task and busy-work and repetition.  So if it  <br/>
would help you to keep track of the intense, real one-on-one time, I  <br/>
bet you have more time with them than you think.<br/>
<br/>
That said, though, putting them off when they have questions or need  <br/>
help isn&#39;t good.  Maybe you can spend a little more energy making  <br/>
sure they have new and interesting things to look at or mess with or  <br/>
hear or watch while you&#39;re busy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m always patient with them on days like this,  <br/>

<br/>
If they did go to school, how much time, money, energy and effort  <br/>
would you spend getting them ready, delivering them, dealing with  <br/>
teachers, finding supplies and uniforms and equipment they need,  <br/>
replacing it when they lose it or use it up, picking them up,  <br/>
bringing them home, getting them ready for the next day...<br/>
<br/>
Compare to those things, not just to an ideal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In fact Nora, who has to do _everything_ her big sister does  <br/>
(anyone else have a toddler like that?), is upset because she&#39;s too  <br/>
little to go to school. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Would it be easier for you to have both girls home so they could do  <br/>
some things together?<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, I&#39;m now in the position of a passionate advocate of  <br/>
unschooling with two daughters who actually (in one case,  <br/>
desperately) _want_ to go to school. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you&#39;re a passionate advocate of unschooling them against  <br/>
their will.  But it sounds like it wasn&#39;t her idea to go.  At the age  <br/>
of five, she&#39;s been to two schools (at least), and that&#39;s not much in  <br/>
the direction of unschooling.   If you do go back to unschooling,  <br/>
there will be schooling ideas and possibly damage to get past.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I question whether, even in the hypothetical absence of the need  <br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only two option.<br/>

home and use, but these things will absolutely help, if you read them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553791690">hi, <br/>
This thread really hit a chord in that unlike the op&#39;s friend I think<br/>
I may be &quot;overdoing&quot; the unschooling, in that I spend all day,every<br/>
day with my children (except the older one (dd7) who does visit with<br/>
friends and goes to clubs like brownies).  I have two younger ones: a<br/>
(ds4) who at the moment is not keen to visit his friends alone and<br/>
would rather be home all day, altho he does enjoy himself when he does<br/>
come out and about, and a dd(2) who is just becoming independent and<br/>
will now happily go off with daddy, but won&#39;t go anywhere long with<br/>
anyone else.  We go out and about together a lot some weeks, visit<br/>
friends, go to home ed. clubs etc. and some weeks we r home and<br/>
pottering and enjoying each other&#39;s company.  I love being with them,<br/>
but now wonder is it ok for me to say put the TV on and watch<br/>
something i want to watch IN THE DAY or read a magazine or just do<br/>
something for me (not including housework  :-)  ).  The reason for the<br/>
capitals is that I do feel that IN THE DAY are my &quot;work hours&quot; and<br/>
that I should be &quot;on duty&#39; in case &quot;someone&quot; happens to come round and<br/>
catch me &quot;not doing my job&quot;.  I can relax in the evenings and at<br/>
weekends and happily combine doing my own thing and being with them,<br/>
but I just have this hang up about what I perceive others percieve as<br/>
&quot;my work time&quot;.  I don&#39;t have family close by and I know I could ask<br/>
some of the older home ed. boys and girls to come over but I even feel<br/>
this could be seen as &quot;cheating&quot;.  Silly I know.  I know I don&#39;t have<br/>
work hours but as I said I just wonder about other&#39;s perceptions of me<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73553714">Hi Robert,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m technically new too although I have been practicing and thinking <br/>
about something like unschooling for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I know that, like you, I am often too busy to do my ideal, too <br/>
divereted to devote everything that I wish I could. <br/>
<br/>
But I do trust their unique paths and my heart and intentions.<br/>
<br/>
I want to share with you that is hardest for me when I move into a <br/>
place of comparison. In my case, I usually do it to myself about my <br/>
past self. When my oldest was born I was single and I raised him and <br/>
intended to homeschool him sometimes with my mother and mostly alone <br/>
until he was 4. Then I got together with my today husband and step-<br/>
daughter who is the same age as my son and had two more children, now <br/>
2 and 1/2 and 6 months. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I get thinking that I SHOULD be able to give my son all <br/>
that he had before everyone else became, by my choice, a part of our <br/>
lives. <br/>
<br/>
It feels the same as when, during times of stess I think I SHOULD <br/>
enroll in a curriculum or enroll them in school or preschool. <br/>
<br/>
At bottom, for me the answer comes to knowing my heart. It is not so <br/>
cut and dry for me. I know I am making mistakes. I know I yell <br/>
sometimes out of my frustration of lack of space. I know I shine <br/>
sometimes because of my joyful heart or my classical education.<br/>
<br/>
I know I am human. I know I trust my children. and everyone else when <br/>
I&#39;m at my best.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you&#39;re doing more than fine. You&#39;re thinking. <br/>
You love. You&#39;re open. You&#39;re trying.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that you trust yourself, your instincts and those of your <br/>
children and partner.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re doing great because you&#39;re asking and you love!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; This September, my partner wanted S to try the small local school in<br/>
&gt; the village near where we&#39;re building the house (previously she went<br/>
&gt; to preschool in the city). S was very reluctant to go but my partner<br/>
&gt; insisted, and I felt that, especially as this was an exceptionally<br/>
&gt; busy time for us, it wouldn&#39;t be such a terrible idea for her to<br/>
&gt; experience school for a while, mornings only. After struggling for a<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tell myself it&#39;s temporary, this is the best year for her to try<br/>

works best is when I take them out in the mornings, have fun and then<br/>

find things that they can do which are actually helpful. (This is made<br/>

part-time for 2 months (the second at least partly voluntarily, in<br/>
that we made it clear that we wanted her to try it for a period and<br/>
after that she was free to stay or leave, and she decided to stay for<br/>
the time being). The rest of the last 2 years have been unschooling (I<br/>
don&#39;t count the first 3 because I hadn&#39;t really gotten the idea yet.)<br/>

as it is implicitly, later explicitly, directed at &quot;moms&quot; and doesn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
I guess this message hit a chord for me as well and it reminds me of <br/>
something I expereinced years ago when I was in school for a masters <br/>
in transpersonal psychology. <br/>
<br/>
I was there in school even though I was a single mom and I had a lot <br/>
of guilt aboout taking my son away from the home and friends and his <br/>
grandma in order to fulfill my dreams. So I was going to class and <br/>
working at home doing intuitive phone consults, but only after he was <br/>
sleeping, and devoting every other second of my life to him. In <br/>
retrospect, to insure that he had all he needed, according to my <br/>
criteria, I was creating a dynamic that wasn&#39;t helping anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in a process class where we were sharing kept bringing up <br/>
a &quot;Mary&quot; image and long story short it ended up with me. What stayed <br/>
with me the most was someone saying &quot;But how will he be able to live <br/>
his life against this view of perfection you&#39;re establishing. If you <br/>
never fail or even have darker emotions or time for yourself, how <br/>
will he?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That did it for me. Thank goodness!<br/>
<br/>
Now, everytime I find myself stuck in a battle with one of my 4 kids <br/>
or myself about taking time for me, I remind myself of that.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, the joyful me that comes from 2 o&#39;clcok PJs, is exactly <br/>
what we all need. (And if need be, I just don&#39;t answer the door!)<br/>
<br/>
Trust yourself. And thanks for helping medo the same,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965430297">Robert I just want to share that I am in a very similar situation.  I have a<br/>
5 year old and an 18 month old and my husband and I both work from home.  He<br/>
wakes up with the kids and is with them in the mornings, then works in the<br/>
afternoons while I am with the kids.  That is the &quot;plan.&quot;  There are lots of<br/>
days I take the kids to town, or he needs more time to work outside during<br/>
the day when there is light, or I need extra time right after dinner to<br/>
work...  It is always juggling and we don&#39;t spend much time all of us<br/>
together -- but in comparison to other families of course we DO.<br/>
<br/>
I just try to really focus when I&#39;m with my kids and try NOT to work when<br/>
I&#39;m with them, as I rarely get much accomplished and we all end up crabby.<br/>
I have to remind myself of this almost daily, when I think I could just read<br/>
this email while we have the TV on...  But my son wants to sit in my lap<br/>
instead, and email can be read (or mass deleted) later!  Then, my husband<br/>
and I both try very hard to work efficiently when we have the chance.  So<br/>
much computer time could be spent surfing, reading, (writing posts to this<br/>
list...) etc.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s about &quot;have to,&quot; a phrase you used at least three times in<br/>

&gt; two extremes per situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Letting go of &quot;have to&quot; and replacing it with &quot;want to&quot; opens up  <br/>
possibilities. It returns control to you rather than handing control  <br/>
over to some vague unseen power that&#39;s making you use up your time in  <br/>
specific ways.<br/>
<br/>
Shopping can turn into an adventure if you go to new stores, explore  <br/>
new items, give the older one a list.<br/>
<br/>
You can also think up ways to simplify so that you shop less (buying  <br/>
and cooking in bulk for instance). Find people to trade kids with so  <br/>
you can drop them off for an hour or two and you take their kids for  <br/>
an hour or two.<br/>

person is no reflection on another unrelated person.<br/>

The list isn&#39;t a good place for why you can&#39;t do something. It&#39;s very  <br/>
easy not to do something. &quot;Can&#39;t&quot; needs no support. If you do want to  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668424962">-=-&gt; Perhaps you could find someone else to spend some time with the  <br/>
kids<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; every day or three days a week - maybe to take them on outings. That<br/>
 &gt; would give you some hours of time that you could count on to  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>devote to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; work.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We tried this for a bit, but the person was useless.<br/>
<br/>
It might be worth another try or two, and maybe having more than one  <br/>
person.   A teen perhaps, or a young mom whose child or children  <br/>
might have fun with yours on an outing you could finance and she  <br/>
could organize.    A concept isn&#39;t wrong just because one person  <br/>
didn&#39;t get it or wasn&#39;t a good match.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; Would it be easier for you to have both girls home so they could  <br/>
do  some things together?  They are home together during the  <br/>
afternoons, at any rate. In fact this week we are at home together  <br/>
all day due to a combination of factors.-=-<br/>
<br/>
School has been known for creating distance between people--between  <br/>
children and parents, and between siblings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, when you&#39;re asleep, is that &quot;mom&quot; (&quot;dad&quot;) time or &quot;kid&quot;  <br/>
time, since we&#39;re all in the same room / bed so they can easily have  <br/>
a cuddle or a drink of water, etc. if they need one during the night?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I never advocated keeping the kids awake for 23 hours.  Some parents  <br/>
want eight hours of child-free sleep at night.  Other parents make  <br/>
themselves available, even in the same room or the same bed.  The  <br/>
idea isn&#39;t to count hours.  The idea is to be aware that this kind of  <br/>
parenting can&#39;t be done, with small children, in just four or ten  <br/>
hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have a bit of a problem with the article as a whole, including  <br/>
the chart, in as much as it is implicitly, later explicitly, directed  <br/>
at &quot;moms&quot; and doesn&#39;t mention that there may be another (or poss. an  <br/>
only) adult person in the child&#39;s family, to wit, a dad.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The webzine for which it was written had one male author and all the  <br/>
rest were female.  It had very few male subscribers.   This list has  <br/>
over 1500 members. Maybe twenty of those are male.  It was a little  <br/>
essay designed to make a point.  It&#39;s one small page of over a  <br/>
thousand on the site.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things written by dads, if that will make you feel more  <br/>
comfortable.<br/>

&quot;Can&#39;t&quot; gets lots of support, though, and sometime people like to  <br/>
hear &quot;Don&#39;t worry.  There&#39;s really nothing you can do.  You&#39;re a  <br/>
great mom/dad and your children are lucky to have you.&quot;  That does  <br/>
support &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;have to&quot; and &quot;later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t always support unschooling.<br/>

Here&#39;s my support page:<br/>
