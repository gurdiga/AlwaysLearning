-=-My 3-yr-old doesn&#39;t show symptoms until the day after eating  a<br/>
gluten-containing food. Even when I see those symptoms and ask her  if<br/>
she feels sick, she often says no. She doesn&#39;t know which food  caused<br/>
the symptoms.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a few bites of donut produce some symptoms, that might be how she  learned <br/>
*herself* about her condition and how to be aware and conscious and to  <br/>
manage her choices wisely.   Donuts don&#39;t have to come in increments  of WHOLE <br/>
donut, half a dozen or a dozen.  <br/>
 <br/>
What if a few bites of donut would produce NO symptoms?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even when no noticeable symptoms are present, any amount of gluten<br/>
damages the intestines. It may also cause depression and irritability.<br/>
It&#39;s not just a tummy ache. You&#39;d have to know more about celiac&#39;s<br/>
disease to understand the variety of dangers. The intestines are slow<br/>
to heal, and while they do so, they don&#39;t absorb nutrients well, and<br/>
the person feels terrible. Even foods that don&#39;t contain gluten can<br/>
cause a reaction if they were produced on the same equipment as<br/>
something that does. That&#39;s why you see those types of warnings on<br/>
labels.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m unsuccessfully preventing my daughter from experiencing<br/>
gluten reactions since gluten is so hard to avoid, so she gets plenty<br/>
of opportunity to know that something is wrong, just not a direct<br/>
association between a bite of food and how she feels.<br/>
<br/>
And I think this is where my dislike of sugar comes in. Because gluten<br/>
causes depression in me, and I think in my daughter as well, I crave<br/>
sugar to balance out the damage, but this isn&#39;t a healthy choice. It&#39;s<br/>
a negative cycle. My daughter goes crazy for sugar. I saw that when<br/>
she was under two years old. It doesn&#39;t make her happy. She becomes<br/>
obsessed, and will not stop until an entire pan of brownies is gone.<br/>
And contrary to my inclination, I have never limited her when there&#39;s<br/>
a treat available. I&#39;ve never told her no when she asks for one.<br/>

==========<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of depression and damage and negativity.<br/>
It&#39;s not making either of you happy.<br/>
 <br/>
There are other factors in life and health besides nutrition.  A  person on a <br/>
perfect diet could die of depression and negativity.  <br/>
 <br/>
If there&#39;s no room for a person to discuss choices or  natural  learning or <br/>
freedoms, it&#39;s not a good discussion for this list.<br/>

with older kids wouldn&#39;t be able to take advantage of that but no  <br/>
reason you can&#39;t. Make fruit and other things she likes easily  <br/>
available and more fun. Cut up fruit and veggies for her and keep  <br/>
them handy in the refrigerator. Bring plates of food to her when she  <br/>
might be hungry. Cheese cubes on a plate with toothpicks. Non sugared  <br/>
PB to dip bananas into.<br/>
