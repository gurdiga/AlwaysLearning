 </span></blockquote>Hi Patti,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to learn of your marital challenges.  As you know from reading my <br/>
book, the judge in my divorce didn&#39;t even know about homeschooling, and wasn&#39;t <br/>
interested in learning about it from my lawyer.  He didn&#39;t care if the <br/>
children were at home or off to school, he just didn&#39;t count the hours of the <br/>
&quot;schoolday&quot; as parent time, which is why I ended up paying child support.  I have <br/>
been able to continue unschooling because by law I was entitled to half the <br/>
military retirement, which covers the rent - tho the rest of the budget is often <br/>
VERY tricky.<br/>
<br/>
I second Sandra, that if the issue is having the children at home to learn, <br/>
it may be more important to have the marriage intact.  Divorce slams everything <br/>
in your life into a new place.  It&#39;s tough, and if you can make the <br/>
relationship work out, I would encourage you to examine all possible options.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you find you do need to be separate from your husband, then I wish <br/>
you stength, and good supportive friends - they were my lifeline.<br/>
