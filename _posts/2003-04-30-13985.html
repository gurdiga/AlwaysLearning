<div id="ygrps-yiv-613454026">****She MADE a birth certificate on her home computer. Copied one that was real <br/>
and made it look all official. No one questioned it EVER.******<br/>

<br/>
Do you mean she used it to get a US Passport or something? That&#39;s scary. (Unless she wants to go into the fake birth certificate business :-)<br/>
<br/>
Or do you mean she used to get in/out of Mexico? That wouldn&#39;t surprise me. Customs agents in Mexico, the Caribbean, etc are so used to US tourists they barely even look. Ditto with the &quot;regulation&quot; about bringing in a child without a permission letter from the other parent. I&#39;ve done it a million times -- nobody ever asked to see anything, and my kids and I do not have the same last name.<br/>
<br/>
I arrived in Italy with an expired passport. No comment from Italian customs. I lost my passport in France and came home without it. Short explanation to the French agent. Short explanation to the US agent. The airline was more diligent than customs!<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm. Maybe I just look trustworthy. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

them both.  But babies change so much so fast that within a month the <br/>
passport looked nothing like them. Not to mention at a year what they looked <br/>
like.  We went in and out of so many countries and no one even questioned it. <br/>
LOL.  We did carry their birth certificates in case anyone ever did question <br/>
it but no one did.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a birth certificate for Max and it&#39;s completely in Arabic so we<br/>
have no way of knowing if it&#39;s actually accurate and the name spelling<br/>
could be anything because the translation becomes an issue of phonics. <br/>
<br/>
But they did let us get a US passport. What is interesting is that for 2 of<br/>
my kids who were born out of the US they are listed as being born out of<br/>
wedlock (even though we&#39;ve been married 18 years). When you have kids<br/>
overseas you have to show proof of divorce for either parent who&#39;s been<br/>
married before. DH was but the papers are in storage somewhere.<br/>
I have no idea what this might mean (if anything) down the road for the kids??<br/>
<br/>
I did get nervous here in the UAE about it because you go to jail for<br/>
having a child if you aren&#39;t married! But apparantly the state department<br/>
keeps it a secret.<br/>

divorce papers.  Also, since the birth certificate was in German, I had to <br/>
have a translation, done by the hospital, sent with the birth certificate for <br/>
their American birth certificate and passport.  We were in the military that <br/>
is why they got American birth certificates.  It says US citizen born abroad.<br/>

We had a hard moment bringing our kids out of Canada because we only had <br/>
COPIES of birth certificates, not originals.  And both parents were right <br/>
there, with IDs...  <br/>
<br/>
I guess they randomly put the fear of customs into a few people to keep <br/>
everybody on their toes.<br/>

Yes. That&#39;s all you need for travel between here and Mexico. No one ever <br/>
questioned it, not once. She also used it to get her drivers license. Never <br/>
questioned again.<br/>
All of the information on it was accurate, it just wasn&#39;t issued by the state.<br/>
