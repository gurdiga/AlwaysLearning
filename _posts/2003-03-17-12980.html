<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Where should we draw the line and how do we let people know and keep peace<br/>
&gt; here without that itself being a conflict on the list?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, there&#39;s a difference between discussing what&#39;s going on in our own<br/>
families and discussing political ideas.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s going on in my family involves unschooling a little boy who learned<br/>
recently that his father&#39;s going to this mess soon.  I haven&#39;t been having<br/>
troubles with him and his fears lately, but did a month or two ago.  I hope<br/>
that you all would have ideas if I did bring my concerns here.<br/>
<br/>
But when I&#39;m reading my emails late at night and I find things in my mailbox<br/>
on the evils of war, that&#39;s beyond what&#39;s part of unschooling discussions,<br/>
in my mind.  I should NOT have nightmares based on what I read on an<br/>
unschooling list!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m dealing with these same sorts of issues, except kind of from the other <br/>
side, but with the same effects.  My youngest is *extremely* concerned <br/>
about the people involved (here and there), and is trying to understand the <br/>
issues and connections.  He&#39;s a pretty sensitive guy and while I thought <br/>
we&#39;d done a decent job of buffering him, it seems maybe not.  We&#39;re talking <br/>
occasional nightmares and LOTS of child-sought discussion.  I&#39;m shut down <br/>
from talking about it here because our family beliefs might hurt someone <br/>
else on the list.   Okay.  I can wholly abide by those rules, but then <br/>
*it&#39;s my hope that others will keep to those rules as well* to keep from <br/>
hurting me and others like me in return.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has the addy for a list where unschoolers are discussing the <br/>
impacts of extreme social events on their kids, I would greatly appreciate <br/>
that info.  I want to honor this list&#39;s preferences and take that <br/>
particular bit elsewhere!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your forbearance on my broaching this item,<br/>
And Peace and Health to EVERYONE, near and far!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628976540">Hi Heidi - It&#39;s up for discussion on RUL, which is another yahoo group.<br/>
RUL is a list meant for radical unschoolers - we don&#39;t discuss<br/>
curriculum, most members are attachment parents/nonpunishing/thinking<br/>
outside the box kinds of parents.  (I think it sometimes gets confused<br/>
with RU, which is different and I don&#39;t think as &#39;radical&#39;). ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s really easy to make a yahoogroup yourself, and they&#39;re easy to dissolve <br/>
when your discussion is passed.  You can totally make one just even for a <br/>
temporary purpose, like planning a surprise party, and just close it <br/>
afterward.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly L. is thinking about making one for military unschooling families, but <br/>
she had company coming and was making a big dinner tonight (with chocolate <br/>
bread pudding)...<br/>
