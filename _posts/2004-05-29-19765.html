<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029719999">Didn&#39;t someone here lately claim the world was becoming more violent?  Here <br/>
are two excerpts from an article.  It&#39;s interesting in any case, but the <br/>
statistics make more recent violence seem minute.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Lewis&#39; P-51 fighter was shot down Sept. 11, 1944, over eastern Germany <br/>
during a fierce air battle in which 57 U.S. aircraft were lost. Lewis&#39; plane was <br/>
last seen nose-diving into a forest. <br/>
A German naturalist, Adelbert Wolf, found Lewis&#39; wreckage and buried what <br/>
remains he could find in a field near Oberhof. Wolf marked the grave with a cross <br/>
and tended it for decades. <br/>
<br/>
-=-About a decade before the Berlin Wall fell, Wolf notified an American <br/>
about the grave, and a U.S. delegation visited the site but was not permitted by <br/>
the Communist government to exhume the remains. -=-. . . .<br/>
<br/>
-=-About 78,000 soldiers are still missing in action from World War II, and <br/>
about 30 bodies are found, identified and brought home each year. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a CNN version of an AP story that was on the Netscape splash page today. <br/>
 I have no idea whether just everyone can get there, but in case:<br/>
