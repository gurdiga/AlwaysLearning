<div id="ygrps-yiv-902689928">Dear Fellow Homeschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Mimi and I have been homeschooling  my 7 kids for the past <br/>
14 yearsway back when people did not even know what it was.<br/>
<br/>
In 1997 every parents nightmare came true for my husband (of 23 <br/>
years) and I lost our beloved Andrew to an unnecessary and <br/>
preventable death. Rather than become debilitated by our devastating <br/>
loss, the Lord gave me the hope that He would use this tragedy for <br/>
His glory. Immediately following Andrew&#39;s death, another son, Riley <br/>
Josiah, became critically ill and required life support, 24 hour <br/>
nursing, and 26 operations in 2.5 years. During this time of mourning <br/>
our loss, caring for our sick child I was caring for a newborn and <br/>
homeschooling 4 other kids. The Lord taught me two invaluable <br/>
lessons - not all loving parents are able to homeschool by themselves <br/>
and that there was an enormous need for a homeschooling help to come <br/>
to parents when they cannot do it all.<br/>
<br/>
To fulfill this need and God&#39;s promise that our loss would be used <br/>
for good, my husband and I founded The Grace Academy, an online <br/>
school (pending licensing) that delivers world class curriculum to <br/>
children throughout the world. <br/>
<br/>
Many have called The Grace Academy the &quot;best of both world-<br/>
homeschooling and Christian private school.&quot; Grace provides a <br/>
comprehensive, world class Christian K-12 curriculum, daily Bible <br/>
studies, devotions, and dedicated Christian teachers - all while your <br/>
child(ren) learn in your safe and nurturing home.. Grace&#39;s curriculum <br/>
uses many of the leading Christian publishers like Bob Jones,Alpha <br/>
Omega, and Saxon Math. Choose from over 150 courses that all have a <br/>
balanced Christian world view.<br/>
<br/>
The Grace Academy provides everything you need to provide your child<br/>
(ren) with a thorough and standards based education. Our interactive <br/>
technology allows student and teacher to communicate directly in real <br/>
time. Our faculty will mentor each student individually through out <br/>
Live Tutor technology.<br/>
<br/>
Information about Grace can be found just a click away  at <br/>
www.thegraceacademy.org. <br/>
Demo our courses, browse through our course catalogue, read our <br/>
mission statement and sign up for a free library of over 1300 etexts <br/>
on CD that we will send to your home as a blessing to you for <br/>
visiting our website.<br/>
<br/>
The Grace Academy provides outstanding curriculum where students can <br/>
learn at their own pace, anytime, anywhere, any path. <br/>
<br/>
Leave your children in the hands of Grace. <br/>
<br/>
Abundant Blessings in Him,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632704088">Not that it matters, since this is an unschooling list and nobody here&#39;s <br/>
likely to want to consider buying into a Christian homeschooling service, <br/>
but...<br/>
<br/>
Is Grace one of the Einstein-related groups that was just being discussed on <br/>
another list this week?  If anyone knows, please put that information here.  <br/>
Even though the people on this list are unschooling, several of us end up <br/>
being contact and resource people and it&#39;s worth knowing what&#39;s out there and <br/>
what&#39;s having difficulties, when we&#39;re helping others.<br/>

hit the one I moderate, and now you&#39;re here.  I think you&#39;re barking up the<br/>
wrong tree with this one.<br/>

&lt;sarcasm on&gt; Hmmmm, nice sales pitch.  &lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but this post really left a bad taste in my mouth.  It is touting<br/>
school at home ideals mixed with a &quot;Christian private school&quot; flavor that<br/>
boasts &quot;a thorough and standards based education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not sure that I missed something but I was sure the description of this<br/>
email list was for unschoolers not school at home people.  Guess they have<br/>
to try their best to sell their product even in what I would consider a<br/>
&quot;hostile environment.&quot;  (not sure &quot;hostile environment&quot; is the phrase I<br/>
wanted to use as I mean an environment that really frowns on<br/>
structructured school type cariculum for learning.)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve written to Mimi Mandel at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mimi@...">mimi@...</a> to ask her not to <br/>
post anymore since this is an unschooling list.  Since she was unable to read <br/>
the comments last time, if anyone would like to send something for her to <br/>
read, just post it here or write to her directly.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to say that sending a solicitation once to a clearly-marked <br/>
unschooling group was not too rude.  Sending it twice wasn&#39;t cool.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think we&#39;ll be getting a third one.<br/>
