<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037370053">Deb you are such a blessing!!  I am sitting here dog tired from play <br/>
rehearsals. (I am doing my first Shakespeare show and we open tonight so this <br/>
week has been &quot;hell week&quot; with rehearsals every night until late and adding <br/>
all the tech stuff like costumes, make-up, lights, and sound.)  With one <br/>
short &quot;swirl&quot; you&#39;ve picked me up and made me appreciate where I am Right Now!<br/>
<br/>
Here in Western North Carolina we are experiencing a cold front.  I say <br/>
Hurrah!  This means it won&#39;t be 85 when I get to the show tonight and I won&#39;t <br/>
sweat buckets in the setting sun wearing all the costume pieces.  Today it is <br/>
only supposed to be in the mid-70s.  I can deal with that!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and if I come help clean the pool will Dylan make some more <br/>
frozen soy dessert?  Strawberrry is my favorite!<br/>

Epilepsy and EEG Feature Prominently in Determining<br/>
Cobalamin Congenital Deficiency <br/>
Seizures associated with failure to thrive occurring<br/>
in infants during their first year of life may be due<br/>
to cobalamin deficiency. Evaluation of plasma amino<br/>
acids and urinary acid organic analysis in these and<br/>
other children with convulsive status epilepticus will<br/>
help lead to a diagnosis. Cobalamin (Cbl) is an inborn<br/>
error of intracellular Cbl ... Full Story <br/>

strawberry&#39;s so dessert&#39;s just a crank or two away. <br/>
<br/>
It was 103 here yesterday and we were in that pool and will be today by<br/>
the looks of things, so bring your swim fins and I&#39;ll furnish the<br/>
spoon.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
