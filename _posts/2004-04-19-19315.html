<div id="ygrps-yiv-351694807">I did it last year.  My kids weren&#39;t interested in being involved but I was<br/>
the &quot;adult sponsor&quot; for the teen drama group.  We had a ball.  It was an<br/>
unschooled production from kids who have been raised as school at homers.<br/>
<br/>
The kids were fantastic.  Dealing with the adults was tiresome.  So tiresome<br/>
that I didn&#39;t do it again this year.<br/>

&gt; Hey everyone,<br/>
&gt; I am wondering if anyone has been able to be part of a co-op and<br/>
&gt; unschool well?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Basically, there is a &#39;gym&#39; group we have attended for several years,<br/>
&gt; which I find &#39;too schooly&#39;, though the kids want to go mainly to connect<br/>
&gt; with other families. Plus, I get to hang out with other parents....a<br/>
&gt; generally good support system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to lose them as a general community, but I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; subject my children to schoolthink.  Many if the people who will<br/>
&gt; volunteer are trained teachers, though some are seasoned enough as<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers that I think they at least have some creativity and<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm, as well as flexibility.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we sit around and discuss it, it seems exciting in some ways.    I<br/>
&gt; can see myself contributing by facilitating a session (I refuse to say<br/>
&gt; &#39;teaching&#39; a &#39;class&#39;....but that&#39;s what they say.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Later, when I think about it at home, I don&#39;t think it would suit us. I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t say whether my children will be interested because they only speak<br/>
&gt; in broad subject words like &#39;science&#39;, &#39;drama&#39;, &#39;art&#39;, even &#39;study hall&#39;<br/>
&gt; and &#39;homework&#39; - and I am so sensitive about language usage....it tells<br/>
&gt; me they are thinking &#39;schoolish&#39;; though they say they don&#39;t want it to<br/>
&gt; be like a school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am just thinking out loud here, but wondered if any of you had ever<br/>
&gt; tried it and what type of experience you had.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426691948">Hi Susan,<br/>
I think your awareness to your sensitivity to language and usage is an important key.  I have never thought twice about referring to Alexander&#39;s enrichment activities as class.  He is still young but we do live in America and the term like it or not does denote something and always will.  His enrichment classes are night and day from his preschool.  He was looking forward to school and going to class until it happened.  Well, as I have said before live and learn.  Alex has many classes and all of them denote a fun enjoyable experience.  There is a structure, a beginning and an end but he is joyful when they are through.  Perhaps if you can bring your own unique talent and joy to the environment the term &quot;class&quot; will begin to mean something different.  I too, have found myself in a defensive position with friends at times.  I hang on to the knowing the proof shall be in the pudding.  I am guilty of using the term homeschooling when we are far more unschooling but I am not ready to educate every person who crosses my path.  Those are just some thoughts that came up.  I wish there was a co-op we could go to close but the only one I am aware of is a 45 minute drive and not worth it.  <br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

I am wondering if anyone has been able to be part of a co-op and<br/>
unschool well?  **<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done it, very loosely, for a couple of years with a smallish group (4 or 5 moms at a time and about 10 kids from the ages of 2-12.)  Because I was already friends with all of the moms and because there are few of us and we aren&#39;t focusing on one age, we&#39;ve always been able to keep it loose.   (We can&#39;t really make it look like school with the range of kids we have.)   Originally our biweekly get togethers had a story or two read aloud and then an art, craft or science project that everybody could do their own way.  I would let my kid wander off if he wasn&#39;t interested.  (He&#39;d usually start the craft but be &quot;done&quot; in less than 10 minutes.)<br/>
<br/>
Gradually the group got looser and squisher.  (Probably my disruptive influence. &lt;g&gt;)  Now we mainly go on nature hikes, but sometimes band together to go on field trips.  Nature hikes are great because we can walk, socialize, relax, feel inspired and learn something about nature all in the same afternoon.  That kind of efficiency appeals to even the most achievement oriented moms. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I kind of prefer a small group over a big one, because I don&#39;t like the feeling of being badly outnumbered.  Creating a relaxed group may not work with people who are skeptical about unschooling.  People in my group had known my kid for a long time and knew that my strange &quot;methods&quot; were NOT making him stupid.<br/>
