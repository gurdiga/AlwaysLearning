<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676020840">NBTSC is really only for kids who are 13 or older, so it won&#39;t really work <br/>
for the initial poster yet, but it&#39;s a great place for teens to connect and <br/>
both teach to and learn from each other.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has gone to NBTSC for several years (taking last year off to do <br/>
other things) and plans to go to both of this year&#39;s western sessions.  She <br/>
found NBTSC extremely inspiring and has made friendships that have lasted <br/>
outside of camp.  As a matter of fact, we just had &#39;The Canadians&#39; here to <br/>
visit for several days.  Lovely young people.  My 14yo son will go this <br/>
year for his first time and is very excited. He considers it a &#39;must-do&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I visited the camp myself and spent an entire day roaming the campus with <br/>
no influence except my daughter (when she wasn&#39;t busy talking to <br/>
camper-friends.)  It was a beautiful forested setting, and being fall, was <br/>
nippier than I would like (but then I usually like it about 74 <br/>
degrees!)  The day I was there, they sent the remote-controlled submersible <br/>
robot (that they&#39;d built themselves!) out into the pond for the very first <br/>
time - and it worked!  Even though we weren&#39;t expected (we didn&#39;t RSVP), <br/>
they graciously made room for us at the table.  The food was more <br/>
holy-granola-y than I am used to, but it was good and lots of kids went <br/>
back for seconds.<br/>
<br/>
The camp (and group?) is obviously not a good fit for every child, nor for <br/>
every family.  No group ever is.  Please don&#39;t take one parent&#39;s experience <br/>
of the camp (even mine) for the sum total of camp quality.  Check it out <br/>
for yourself and talk to a lot of people!  Shoot, if you go to the NBTSC <br/>
website, there&#39;s even some teen forums where you can ask the teens what <br/>
they think.<br/>
First Hand Info, without the parental slant.<br/>
Priceless!<br/>
