<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941838347">The power of words has always fascinated me - and curses are among the<br/>
most emotion-laden power words around.  I am interested in the curses<br/>
from different cultures and past times - and my kids and talk about<br/>
these all the time.  For example, in Jamaica, the absolute worst thing<br/>
you can call someone is &quot;blood clot.&quot;    Can you imagine if that curse<br/>
came into use in the US? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794134485">Apparently researchers were trying to show that swearing makes coping  <br/>
worse in bad situations but actually found it&#39;s the opposite.<br/>

I was going to post this because of the not-too-long-ago discussion  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282312715">I don&#39;t want to over-react, but I want to deal with the situation appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
My children and I went to the park today with two other families (moms and children).  Both of these moms are good friends of mine.  I had also brought along 2 children who weren&#39;t mine.  So, there were 9 children in total...ages ranging from 6 - 12.  <br/>
<br/>
For the 3 hours that we were there everything (I thought) was going fine.  The moms and I visited, and the kids played close by...but not close enough that we heard everything.<br/>
<br/>
Then we drove home and the conversation began.  :)<br/>
<br/>
One of the children that I brought (the 12 yr old) told me that my friend&#39;s son (11) was talking inappropriately.  What concerned him the most was that it was in front of the 6 yr old.  There was a particular word used over and over and also used in a challenge to the boy I brought asking if he knew what it meant.  (&#39;P&#39; word for women&#39;s genitalia)  Later they were playing the &quot;telephone&quot; game and it and other rude comments were passed down the line by this one child in particular.  Apparently, this boy has also been telling a crude joke with several swear word to mine and other children.<br/>
 <br/>
Swearing is not all.  This boy, also encouraged by another boy, was being rude and exclusive to the boy I brought.  <br/>
<br/>
Now.  I swore when I was a kid.  I think some of it is just trying it on.  I&#39;m more concerned with the bullying type behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m stuck!  The boy&#39;s mother is a VERY good friend.  We love spending time with her family - once or twice per week.  She struggles with comments about her boy (she&#39;s had many in the past) and I feel terrible that I am now going to be yet another person to complain to her about her son.  I don&#39;t know how to do with alienating her.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a no brainer?  My instinct is to call her and tell her what&#39;s going on in a matter of fact way. It&#39;s also, unfortunately, to lessen contact with her son.  :(<br/>
<br/>
Any opinions?<br/>

to interact more closely with the kids.  But if it seemed they were  <br/>
getting along, I can see letting it go.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If it were me, next time the families were together I would find a  <br/>
smooth way to be alone with that boy (ask him to help you get  <br/>
something out of the car or to carry something) and I would tell him  <br/>
calmly and nicely but in a definite tone that you didn&#39;t want him  <br/>
using punani or fuck or whatever the words were.  Don&#39;t be shy and  <br/>
embarrassed.  Don&#39;t say &quot;bad words&quot; and blush, because that would just  <br/>
amuse him and make him feel powerful, I think.  Tell him flat out what  <br/>
it is you know he said and that you want it not to happen that day.   <br/>
And I&#39;d smile and say &quot;okay?&quot;  Get his agreement.   [I wouldn&#39;t go  <br/>
with &quot;never again,&quot; I would say &quot;today.&quot;]<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that went back and forth between &quot;I would&quot; and &quot;you could.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t know whether you&#39;re going to talk to his mom or whether you  <br/>
already have.  That will make him more thoughtful and aware.<br/>
<br/>
Then if you hear that he did that again, you can say &quot;you agreed,&quot; or  <br/>
you could tell his mom that you had talked with him about it, and he  <br/>
had agreed, but...<br/>
<br/>
Eleven is old enough to make an agreement like that, I think.  Five or  <br/>
six wouldn&#39;t be (in my experience, not with most kids).  Another thing  <br/>
I did was to charge the older kids in the group (whether my kids or  <br/>
not) to make things better, not worse, for younger kids.  &quot;You&#39;re the  <br/>
oldest&quot; can have power, among kids.  Even if the oldest is being  <br/>
shamed a little bit, if it&#39;s that or continued damage, don&#39;t feel bad  <br/>
that you&#39;ve embarrassed him a little bit.  And I don&#39;t think it would  <br/>
be so embarrassing, especially if you and he have had a talk and he  <br/>
knows what you&#39;re reminding him about, in that case.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you decide he can&#39;t behave well enough for you, maybe you  <br/>
could say aloud in front of the group that you&#39;re uncomfortable about  <br/>
the bad language and might not want to meet so often until [name of  <br/>
that boy] is a little older, maybe, or your boys are old enough to  <br/>
speak up.  If you wait and talk to the mom alone, you risk the  <br/>
friendship more, maybe, than if you&#39;re matter-of-fact and treat it  <br/>
like a condition of the park, as you would it being too windy, or too  <br/>
sunny.  Too many bad words.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That all being said, I don&#39;t want my child swearing at the playground...or at home for that matter.  So, it&#39;s a fine line between boundaries and over-reacting, I think.&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
Hmmmm.... Maybe.   You lose the possibility of the direct relationship  <br/>
with the boy that way, and of the mother saving face.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could talk to the daughter too, or ask the boy to talk to  <br/>
his sister.<br/>
<br/>
If both families are there, it&#39;s like a meeting, it seems to me, more  <br/>
than a conversation with a little hint of ultimatum.   Giving the  <br/>
whole family an ultimatum in front of your family is a recipe for  <br/>
embarrassment and defensiveness and argument.   If you play it  <br/>
smoothly with the boy, maybe none of the rest will know you even  <br/>
talked to him.  He might play nicer without your kids having the  <br/>
knowledge that you &quot;told him to.&quot;  That&#39;s valuable to their friendships.<br/>
<br/>
Saving face is important when you can easily do it.<br/>
Sometimes public confrontation is called for, but if a side request  <br/>
does it, that&#39;s better for everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198164476">I try not to swear around kids. When I find one that does, I spend a lot of<br/>
time with him that is totally fun. I ignore all the swear words, and use a<br/>
lot of more &#39;fancy&#39; words that do the &#39;attention getting expression&#39; job<br/>
like &#39;outrageous&#39;, like an ice cube in the sun, etc. Just fancy sounding or<br/>
visual. Often metaphors. I think kids are looking to get attention and seem<br/>
stylish when they do stuff like this. Using loads of words that they can<br/>
pick up and use works to better the vocabulary and clean up the language at<br/>
the same time, not to mention developing an interest in expression. The<br/>
swearing is just not that &#39;in&#39; anymore. They go on to set new trends and be<br/>
cool with other kids and develop an ear for unusual words to keep roping<br/>
into their act. Never ever seen this fail. No fuss, no bother, loads of fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832802750">***One of the children that I brought (the 12 yr old) told me that my friend&#39;s son (11) was talking inappropriately. What concerned him the most was that it was in front of the 6 yr old.***<br/>
<br/>
Does this boy go to school or was he recently in school?<br/>
<br/>
Either way, 11 yr old boys are really entering the age of penis and fart language, and other sexual language.  I don&#39;t have a boy myself, this is something that I&#39;ve witnessed of other boys we&#39;ve known.<br/>
<br/>
Someone should be helping this kid know appropriate times and places to talk this way.  Mixed age and gender company isn&#39;t the setting for most sexual and swearing content.  Even if the parents don&#39;t mind swearing and naughty jokes at home, kids should know that not all those things need to be repeated in public.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with Sandra on this, confront the kid directly and just let him know what you know and ask him not to do that around your kids and friends of your kids.  Then I&#39;d also let my kids know to tell him to knock it off if he starts talking in inappropriate ways that make them uncomfortable.  Some kids may be too shy to do that, but mine have never been too shy to tell someone to stop doing something they didn&#39;t like.  Chamille was always good at changing things around, the diversion tactic if you will, and Margaux is VERY good at being extremely blunt.  I&#39;ve heard her tell the neighbor kids to stop doing whatever they are doing that is rude, or they need to go home right now.  She responds well to that sort of direct communication too.<br/>
<br/>
My experience with kids that use swearing and inappropriate language in this way, are kids that are trying to get attention.  Somewhere, this kid is needing that.  If you end up needing to talk with the mom, perhaps go about it with that in mind, that maybe she needs to be interacting more with her son when they are at home so that when they go to park days she can let him romp around without having to monitor his behavior.<br/>

<br/>
I always find it really amusing when I&#39;m out and about and see small groups of young teenagers or older preteens kind of doing the show offy loud talking, look at me, kind of stuff.  As if somehow it&#39;s so hugely shocking to say these powerful words.  And some kids fake embarrassment about having been so naughty to say something like that around little kids and adults.  That&#39;s the kind of stuff that happens when parents ban it from their homes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids swearing at the playground either!  They do swear at home.  There are many places that they don&#39;t swear at all because they don&#39;t want to offend others, like grandparents, neighbors, little kids and parents of little kids.<br/>
<br/>
I have a very good friend who swears and prefers the company of others who swear because, in general, she&#39;s found that people who swear are often more interesting people.  She really does use that as a benchmark of how close to another person she&#39;s willing to get.  It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t have good friends that don&#39;t swear, it&#39;s more that the friends she really connects with do.<br/>

I&#39;ve found these are usually phases kids go through and best downplayed <br/>

they are kids who otherwise like to hang out together. It usually isn&#39;t <br/>
worth it to make any kind of big deal about it - it usually just goes away.<br/>

they DO know that is inappropriate, so that&#39;s good. They are using some <br/>
judgment, but they are probably getting a big laugh or some kind of <br/>
wanted response out of the other kids, even though the kids are <br/>
reporting on it to their own parent, later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361704883">I see in the archives you&#39;ve had a few discussions on this topic previously with some great links on the history (which i&#39;m excited to check out!).  So, thanks for your patience and indulgence.  <br/>
<br/>
I told my friend about it, and she&#39;s very upset.  We went over to her house yesterday for a visit.  Very soon after she we arrived I started to tell her, but then asked if she would trust me to try  something with her  son.  She did.<br/>
<br/>
She asked him to come in the kitchen (as she would any other time) but once he got there she said I wanted to speak to him.  We went into the other room alone, and I said matter of factly:<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want you using the word, &#39;pussy&#39; today.&quot;<br/>
He nodded his head (with wide eyes).<br/>
&quot;I also don&#39;t want you telling jokes to my kids with the words &#39;bastards, bitches, cocks, shit, or fuck&#39; in them.  <br/>
He nodded again and said, &quot;okay&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Great.  Go have a good time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t exactly as you said, Sandra.  He likely knew right off the bat that his mom knew since she called him in, but oh well.  :)<br/>
<br/>
My friend is at her wit&#39;s end because this isn&#39;t the first complaint about her son.  It might be regarding swearing, but out of her three kids he&#39;s the one that gets into a lot of trouble. BTW, her children have never been to school.  <br/>
<br/>
She was crying at one point saying she just didn&#39;t know what to do.  I, unfortunately, had no words of advice to give her.  This swearing thing seems to be a straw and camel&#39;s back thing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for your help.<br/>

<br/>
Debbie, I&#39;m glad to hear that went well.  I have a suggestion, then.   <br/>
Maybe you can find an opportunity to be alone with the son for a  <br/>
little longer.  Maybe you and he could go out to the store or for food  <br/>
during an outing while she keeps your other kids, if that could be  <br/>
arranged in a smooth fashion that seemed natural.   And maybe in the  <br/>
car while you&#39;re riding side by side, you could tell him his mom&#39;s  <br/>
worried, and ask her if there&#39;s anything anyone could do to make  <br/>
things better.  Don&#39;t say &quot;I want to help you.&quot;  Make the offer more  <br/>
obliquely, without looking at him.<br/>
<br/>
He might confide in you, or he might just think about it and look at  <br/>
his behavior differently himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe at the end you could say &quot;If you ever want to talk, call me!&quot;  <br/>
just as you would with an adult friend.  Try to keep the tone of voice  <br/>
and intent as you would with a friend rather than big adult to little  <br/>
boy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is wonderful advice.  I&#39;m going to have really brainstorm a way this could happen because it&#39;s never happened in the 4 yrs I&#39;ve known them that I would be in the car (or something similar) alone with him.  Perhaps I could invite him over for some time alone with my son, and then finagle a way to be alone with him while we&#39;re doing a task.  Hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to put my intention out there and hope a situation serves itself up soon.  :)<br/>

<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

This is very much the experience that I&#39;ve had.  It&#39;s fun to mess around with those big words and ideas, and even more fun to joke around, but certainly not much fun to make others uncomfortable!<br/>

Hayden&#39;s expressions have increased in their *passion* since the onset of<br/>
hormones...<br/>
Volume control has traditionally more of an issue than content, so I took<br/>
steps to dampen the echo in his room (blanket on one wall, egg cartons on<br/>
another).<br/>
Only recently, with this new intensity of his language and interaction with<br/>
his X BOX live friends, have I had to be serious/stern about certain<br/>
words/phrases and their appropriate use/audience (if any!).  Lots of &quot;that&#39;s<br/>
what she said&quot; floats out of his room, which I giggle at or ignore; at &quot;ass<br/>
rape,&quot; however, I drew the line.  &quot;Guys, that&#39;s a really serious word and it<br/>
means a horrific act of violence. You say that in public and you&#39;re gonna<br/>
get *serious* reactions from emotionally charged people, who don&#39;t care if<br/>
you&#39;re &quot;just joking around&quot; -- it&#39;s not funny.&quot; I haven&#39;t heard it from<br/>
Hayden nor his friend, since. Are they still saying it? If they are, it&#39;s<br/>
with a new awareness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335718509">-=-I told them they&#39;re just words that we give power to, and that our  <br/>
society has deemed inappropriate. I despise saying &quot;these words are  <br/>
banned from our home&quot;. For ex. So many families I know say that  <br/>
&quot;stupid, idiot, hate, bored&quot; or what-have-you are not allowed in &quot;our  <br/>
home&quot;. I just think that&#39;s ridiculous. In fact, it increases the  <br/>
chances that the kids are going to use these words when you&#39;re not  <br/>
around. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I lost this when it was new so I&#39;m glad Ria found it for me.<br/>
<br/>
I had meant to comment when it was new.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;stupid, idiot, hate and bored&quot; are ANYTHING like  <br/>
&quot;swearing.&quot;   Bad language is often just like fart noises.  It&#39;s  <br/>
toilet humor of young children.  Or it&#39;s an exclamation, used when  <br/>
someone stubs a toe, or drops something.<br/>
<br/>
For an unschooling family, if ANYone in the family, parents or adults,  <br/>
is talking about people or situations, things or input of any sort as  <br/>
&quot;stupid&quot; or saying &quot;I hate that,&quot; unschooling will not flourish.   If  <br/>
anyone is calling anyone (even fictional characters or politicians)  <br/>
&quot;idiot,&quot; those kids will have a difficult to impossible time learning  <br/>
to be compassionate and kind.  If anyone is bored or talking about  <br/>
boredom, the parents should do better at providing a good unschooling  <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
I always say something if someone is visiting and says any of those  <br/>
things.  &quot;That&#39;s stupid&quot; is the sort of put-down that causes  <br/>
schoolkids to stop expressing curiosity, to stop asking questions, to  <br/>
stop doing things they were doing.  When kids stand around quietly  <br/>
instead of being, doing, talking, thinking, it&#39;s probably because  <br/>
they&#39;ve heard &quot;That&#39;s stupid,&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re an idiot if you like that,&quot;  <br/>
or other casual negativity.<br/>
<br/>
Casual negativity is pollution of joy.  It will not allow for effusion.<br/>
<br/>
You know what else is destructive of exploration and the desire to  <br/>
learn?   &quot;Ridiculous.&quot;<br/>
There have been three or four times in the past when someone used that  <br/>
word on this list, and I have said something about that too.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not more likely to say &quot;hate&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; outside the  <br/>
house.   I didn&#39;t say &quot;don&#39;t ever say that in my house.&quot;  I explained  <br/>
why it was bad to label things so damningly, and how it could keep a  <br/>
sibling from exploring or doing something, and that I was unwilling to  <br/>
risk having that happen.  If unschooling was going to work, people  <br/>
needed to be kind in the way they spoke of other people&#39;s preferences,  <br/>
hobbies, music, movies, clothes, hair, shoes, etc.<br/>
