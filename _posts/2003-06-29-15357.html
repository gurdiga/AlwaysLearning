<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129501235">I just got back from an eight day vacation with my family.  It was glorious!<br/>
<br/>
A little background.  My husnamd and I have been married 5.5 years.  We&#39;ve <br/>
been cmping together exactly twice.  Once at a huge Family Reunion where we <br/>
were very much the babies.  Ok, we were married and had a nearly one year <br/>
old but aside from driving ourselves there in a car bought for me by my <br/>
daddy we had little to no responsibility for the camping.  We didn&#39;t plan <br/>
the food or the campground or any thing.<br/>
<br/>
The second time was just last year when we went for a weekend at a friends <br/>
cabin.  Again, besides driving ourselves there (well following our friends <br/>
the whole way) we didn&#39;t do mych.  they purchased the food, they made all <br/>
the plans we were just along for the ride.<br/>
<br/>
So this vacation was really a first for us.  W planned the whole thing <br/>
ourselves, from where we&#39;d go to how long we would stay, what we would eat, <br/>
who would clean up.  All of it.  This IS a big deal for us, as taking <br/>
responsibility for ourselves is a rather new experiecne for us.  And we were <br/>
on our own.  Just us and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
We started off in Portland Or, visiting with my brother and his family.  We <br/>
were dismayed to learn that the more expensive a hotel the less free stuff <br/>
you get!  LOL  My sis in law has a friend who works at a Marriot and was <br/>
able to get us a friends and family discount for the weekend.  the hotel was <br/>
originally $114 a night (ok, that&#39;s a LOT to me, maybe not to some) and we <br/>
were able to get it for $54 a night.  The room was adequate but nothing <br/>
special, not even a microwave of anything!  Maybe I&#39;m spoiled but here at <br/>
home where I live we could have had a night in one of our best hotels for <br/>
$114 a night complete with in room Jacuzzi, mini fridge, microwave, the <br/>
works!  And this hotel didn&#39;t even have a complimentary &#39;continental <br/>
breakfast&#39;.  They had a breakfast buffet that was $8.95 a person(my four <br/>
year old too!) so we went to McD&#39;s instead.  :)<br/>
<br/>
OK enough about the bad time we had in the Hotel.  We went to the Portland <br/>
Zoo and didn&#39;t really get rained out!!  Yeah!!  The kids were pretty <br/>
disenchanted with the whole zoo experience. Maybe they&#39;re just too young at <br/>
2 and 4 to really get it.  Perhaps zoos are just really silly places when <br/>
you think about it.  Most of the animals weren&#39;t out and we were there with <br/>
my brother and his family who live where the zoo is and were &#39;jaded&#39; (as my <br/>
brother said).  I think the only one who really liked the zoo was me.  <br/>
Because heck, I like things like that.   By the time we left Portland we <br/>
were all GLAD to be leaving Portland.<br/>
<br/>
We were headed to the beach next.  Cape Lookout on the Oregon coast for <br/>
those who know the place.  It was great we camped in the woods and it was a <br/>
brief 3 minute (ok, maybe 10 minute with kids and crap) walk to the sandy <br/>
beach.  It was windy and chilly but wonderful!  It was so neat to watch my <br/>
kids in their &#39;natural habitat&#39; outside all the time.  :)  My son at two is <br/>
a natual explorer.  I don&#39;t think there would be anything better to him than <br/>
the last week.  So much to see!  I have so many pictures of him in the <br/>
adorable little 2yo discovery squat.  You know the one, the crouched down <br/>
sitting on heels staring intently at something in the dirt.  Everything <br/>
fascinated him!  At the beach or at the campsite he was never bored.  Even <br/>
when DH and I were both reading our books he was happy as a clam <br/>
entertaining himself endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
DD at 4 is not as easily entertained.  She&#39;s the most social one of the 4 of <br/>
us.  I knew this long ago but now it almost defies description (well to me <br/>
anyway).  Each time we would go to the beach she would immidiatly jump into <br/>
the middle of the closest group of kids and soon be by to introduce me to <br/>
her new &#39;best friend&#39;.  While my 2yo wandered all over the beach &#39;alone&#39; my <br/>
4yo was easily found by searching out the largest group of kids and looking <br/>
in the center of it.  She has a particular adoration of biys in the 11-14 <br/>
age range ;) ?!?!  All the kids were very nice.  When we went to the beach <br/>
one evening and there were no children she managesd to charm her way into a <br/>
group of teens who let her bury them in the sand.  And when the weather <br/>
drove us away from the bach and back to the campsite she made friends with <br/>
the lady camping &#39;next door&#39;.  She would go hang out at this woman&#39;s fire  <br/>
(Susan, who makes soap and ended up giving us some for my birthday which was <br/>
thursday).  When she packed up and went home on Thursday morning Kathrynn <br/>
waited about 15 minutes before introducing herself to the &#39;grandparents&#39; on <br/>
the other side of us.  :)<br/>
<br/>
It was really neat to see her interacting with so many people of so many <br/>
ages.  And my family is worried about &#39;socialization&#39; - HA!<br/>
<br/>
I so want to move to the coast!  My husband drags his feet (as always about <br/>
everything!) but I tried to explain to him that my soul needs to live close <br/>
to the ocean, the woods, the green, and the blue!  And glorious humidity!  <br/>
Where I live in eastern WA all is brown, tan, grey, and DRY!  *SIGH*<br/>
<br/>
So that was my summer vacation.  And we made it the whole way, on our own, <br/>
we&#39;re home now, happy, proud, and tired!  :)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Katrina, you&#39;re vacation sounds like it was wonderful. We just finished <br/>
up a semi-vacation last week. My parents rented a cottage on the lake in <br/>
our town for the week. I don&#39;t think I would recommend a vacation so <br/>
close to your own home because it involved a lot of running home to do <br/>
the laundry and water the plants, etc. On the other hand, it was good <br/>
because if we needed new clothes or food or whatever, it was less than <br/>
ten minutes to home.<br/>
<br/>
The absolute best part of the whole thing was the ducks. Aislinn, 7, and <br/>
Elysia, 5, sat out on the dock as still as statues for hours getting a <br/>
mother duck and her 8 babies to trust them. After the second day, even <br/>
Soleille the 2 yr old was sitting with them. That mother duck finally <br/>
let her family within 1 foot of the girls and let them play in the water <br/>
on the edge of the lake while she preened her feathers. It was awesome! <br/>
And the girls and I got to listen to her talk to her babies and see how <br/>
they would listen to her. We talked about how she was teaching them how <br/>
to live and stay alive on the lake. We also saw a male and female loon <br/>
but further out (the lake is called Loon Lake).<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was really fun and a lot cooler on the edge of the lake <br/>
than at home. The first few days of the week reached 96 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Next vacation: Myrtle Beach and Columbia, South Carolina, August, <br/>

sounds like a wonderful vacation.  Glad you shared it.  I too love the ocean, <br/>
although I am on the other coast I grew up by the ocean.  I live near the <br/>
mountains now and do miss the ocean even though I have plenty of green around.<br/>

 Maybe we can get together. We want to go to the Ripley&#39;s Aquarium, <br/>
Brookgreen Gardens, and the science center at Myrtle Beach.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know the name of the place, but it&#39;s supposed to be really &quot;hands-on.&quot; <br/>
 The Columbia Zoo looks good, too, if we have time.   Heidi<br/>

Have you forgotten that we live along the mighty Columbia, where the Yakima and Snake rivers empty into it?  There is plenty of water in this dessert!<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean, though.  I LOVE the ocean too.  Rivers are nice, but the ocean is spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that I spent nearly 30 years on the wet side, where it *is* woods, green, and blue.  I&#39;m enjoying dry for a change!<br/>

<br/>
For a while we lived near enough to the Pt. Defiance zoo to buy the annual pass.  It really changes the experience.  We felt free to go and visit just one or two animals per trip, rather than feeling that we must see everything in our one (expensive) day at the zoo.  Our visits spring through fall were the best - few crowds and the animals were usually more active.  When it gets to hot they like to hide in shady places and sleep.<br/>
<br/>
We visited the San Diego zoo two years ago.  Happened to hit it during October when kids are free.  It was cool to see the exotic animals that we&#39;d only seen on tv or books.  Up close, giraffes are REALLY tall and each zebra really does have a unique stripe pattern.  Is that black on white or white on black?<br/>
