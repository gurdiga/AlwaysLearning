<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415471366">Dear Fellow Homeschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Mimi and I have been homeschooling  my 7 kids for the past <br/>
14 yearsÂ…way back when people did not even know what it was.<br/>
<br/>
In 1997 every parents nightmare came true for my husband (of 23 <br/>
years) and I lost our beloved Andrew to an unnecessary and <br/>
preventable death. Rather than become debilitated by our devastating <br/>
loss, the Lord gave me the hope that He would use this tragedy for <br/>
His glory. Immediately following Andrew&#39;s death, another son, Riley <br/>
Josiah, became critically ill and required life support, 24 hour <br/>
nursing, and 26 operations in 2.5 years. During this time of mourning <br/>
our loss, caring for our sick child I was caring for a newborn and <br/>
homeschooling 4 other kids. The Lord taught me two invaluable <br/>
lessons - not all loving parents are able to homeschool by themselves <br/>
and that there was an enormous need for a homeschooling help to come <br/>
to parents when they cannot do it all.<br/>
<br/>
To fulfill this need and God&#39;s promise that our loss would be used <br/>
for good, my husband and I founded The Grace Academy, an online <br/>
school (pending licensing) that delivers world class curriculum to <br/>
children throughout the world. <br/>
<br/>
Many have called The Grace Academy the &quot;best of both world-<br/>
homeschooling and Christian private school.&quot; Grace provides a <br/>
comprehensive, world class Christian K-12 curriculum, daily Bible <br/>
studies, devotions, and dedicated Christian teachers - all while your <br/>
child(ren) learn in your safe and nurturing home.. Grace&#39;s curriculum <br/>
uses many of the leading Christian publishers like Bob Jones,Alpha <br/>
Omega, and Saxon Math. Choose from over 150 courses that all have a <br/>
balanced Christian world view.<br/>
<br/>
The Grace Academy provides everything you need to provide your child<br/>
(ren) with a thorough and standards based education. Our interactive <br/>
technology allows student and teacher to communicate directly in real <br/>
time. Our faculty will mentor each student individually through out <br/>
Live Tutor technology.<br/>
<br/>

mission statement and sign up for a free library of over 1300 etexts <br/>

learn at their own pace, anytime, anywhere, any path. <br/>
<br/>
Leave your children in the hands of Grace. <br/>
<br/>
Abundant Blessings in Him,<br/>
