*Changing the Game: How Video Games Are Transforming the Business World<br/>
(Hardcover)<br/>
*From the Back Cover*<br/>
At their best, videogames represent the very essence of what drives people<br/>
to think, cooperate, and create. Learning is not &quot;work&quot; in the context of a<br/>
game: it is puzzle-solving, exploration, and experimentation. Cooperation is<br/>
not a &quot;necessary evil&quot; in the context of a game: it is the best part of the<br/>
experience. And few communities are as prolific and generous as those that<br/>
form around games. The videogame paradigm offers powerful lessons for<br/>
business, and innovative businesses are using videogames in powerful new<br/>
ways. In *Changing the Game*, top Microsoft Xbox executive David Edery and<br/>
MIT videogame researcher Ethan Mollick explains how businesses can leverage<br/>
games&#39; interactivity to build far deeper relationships with a new generation<br/>
of customers and employees. The authors begin by reviewing the increasingly<br/>
effective use of videogaming in training. Next, they survey the growing use<br/>
of games in state-of-the-art advertising and marketing programs. They then<br/>
introduce more transformative potential opportunities for gaming: approaches<br/>
that are only beginning to emerge from research laboratories. These include:<br/>
the use of games to spur innovation, and to harness the wisdom of crowds.<br/>
Edery and Mollick conclude with concrete recommendations on how to work with<br/>
video game companies, and some powerful insights on the future of business<br/>
and games in general, drawn from their unique vantage point as MIT<br/>
researchers, an Xbox executive, and gamers.<br/>

It isn&#39;t out yet, but it hit my company&#39;s library today. Not that anyone<br/>
here needs confirmation that games are fine, but this might be a good thing<br/>
to hand to relatives. =)<br/>
