To me, <br/>
Math exists within the covers of public school textbooks, not out  here <br/>
where I live.  I can keep safe from it if I never open the  books.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s hard for some people to understand the difference between school&#39;s  <br/>
label/category/&quot;discipline&quot; and the real material out in the honest-to-God  <br/>
everyday whole, healthy world.<br/>
 <br/>
For instance, I used to teach English.  Was I teaching anyone to SPEAK  <br/>
English?  No, they all were native speakers.   And some schools,  realizing that, <br/>
got all modern and scientific and so call English &quot;Language  Arts.&quot;  And there <br/>
were many times and ways in which I was categorized and  identified as a <br/>
certified instructor of language arts.  That&#39;s a lot of  words, and that&#39;s why <br/>
professionals make more money.  (Joke.  Teachers  hardly make diddly.)<br/>
 <br/>
Some adults HATE &quot;language arts.&quot;  They used to think they hated  English, <br/>
but how could people hate their own native language?<br/>
 <br/>
So, these &quot;language arts&quot; that can come to be feared and despised...<br/>
Poetry, short story, novel; public speaking (at least show&#39;n&#39;tell); theatre  <br/>
awareness/appreciation; writing (fiction and non-fiction, along with which <br/>
come  parts of speech and formal outlines and citations and other common  <br/>
horrors).<br/>
 <br/>
Yet in the absence of even the idea of &quot;language arts,&quot; I have seen my kids  <br/>
enjoy, pursue and discuss as deeply as adults LOTS of poetry, poets, song  <br/>
lyrics, short stories, novels (whether they read them themselves or not), I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen them all perform or present in public to one extent or another (I&#39;ve seen  <br/>
Kirby teach in two different areas of his life).    <br/>
 <br/>
Kirby was in an English 101 class for a month and did the best outline in  <br/>
his class (said the teacher in writing, before she gave him a D for  <br/>
technicalities of her oppressive personal preferences), and used  citations.<br/>
 <br/>
BUT:  Kids on the internet use citations every time they reference  another <br/>
website or add a photo to a profile or order a trading card from a  publisher <br/>
or quote a gaming tournament update and document that it&#39;s later  information <br/>
than their target/correpondendent had.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly and I heard a Meatloaf song on the radio a bit ago that neither of us  <br/>
had heard, and she was discussing the similarities of form and subject <br/>
(without  using those terms) to other songs, and so figured it was probably a Jim <br/>
Steinman  song too.  <br/>
 <br/>
That is what &quot;analysis and criticism&quot; of poetry should be all  <br/>
about--real-life apprecation and discussion.  In school they&#39;ll ask the  kids questions, but <br/>
there are already pre-chosen &quot;right answers.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
From the beginning, I decided not to use the terms school uses for  &quot;academic <br/>
disciplines.&quot;  And my kids can neither love, hate nor fear  science, history, <br/>
math or English.  They have dozens of the elements  without the *false* <br/>
school-exclusive concept of the overriding grouping of those  VERY different areas <br/>
of interest into monolithic &quot;subjects.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s crazy to think that tank and fighter-plane technology of WWII is  &quot;the <br/>
same thing&quot; as Egyptian mummification, but in school it is the same  thing.  <br/>
They&#39;re both history.  And if a kid decides he  hates one, he will avoid the <br/>
other.   Same with math, history, science  and English.  I say NEVER NAME THEM.  <br/>
Leave that for kids who love the  world and are confident in their huge store <br/>
of knowledge and joy to discover the  silly idea of the labels when they&#39;re <br/>
too old for it to mar their growing  personal model of the universe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125622815">Sandra�s post makes me think of  �Life as Jeopardy�  (Hello, I�m Alex<br/>
Trebek, and I�ll be your guide�)  Seriously though.  The categories on the<br/>
show are very specific and mostly very real.  Yeah, sometimes they make no<br/>
sense, but Life is like that!  So, contestants aren�t faced with the<br/>
category �Math� and thus have no reason to think, �Oh geez�I suck at Math!�<br/>
Instead, they get something like �Easy as ��  Then they get an answer like<br/>
�2.14��  and they find that they know �pi� but they still think they suck at<br/>
math.  So, I agree.  Don�t name the �subjects��they�re too subjective<br/>
anyway.  Kids are taught US history in grade X, but don�t know who Susan B.<br/>
Anthony is.  Calling numbers and patterns and concepts and such �Math� is<br/>
creating a box for the HUGE thing that �math� really is.  And, just like<br/>
Shoeless Joe in �Field of Dreams�, �if you build it, they will come.�  If<br/>
you construct the box, the need to fit stuff in to it may be way too close<br/>
for anyone�s comfort.  (Yeah, I know Jeopardy categories are literally in<br/>
boxes, and I�m in effect mixing my metaphors, but I have nursing brain and<br/>
am lucky I remember how to spell �box�, let alone what pi equals.  Give me a<br/>
break :-))<br/>
<br/>
Tami (who was a �math Olympian� through 8th grade, but was thought to have<br/>
�no head for numbers�  by the middle of 9th grade algebra.  Perhaps this had<br/>
something to do with the girl-bullies who tried to smash my head into<br/>
lockers before 5th period algebra everyday?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amazing what needs done when children are removed from real life and <br/>
put into sanitized artificial recreations of it! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s basically a systematized way of trying to lead kids through the <br/>
things they&#39;ll discover on their own by living a full rich life.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that it&#39;s still divorced from real life meaning. And <br/>
it&#39;s likely to make parents nervous that kids can&#39;t possibly discover <br/>
these same concepts from life since kids don&#39;t naturally stumble on <br/>
counting boards and cubes, let alone lay out things in ways so parents <br/>
can see the concepts the child is working on.<br/>
