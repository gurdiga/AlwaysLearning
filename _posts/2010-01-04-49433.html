<div id="ygrps-yiv-778817376">Because three of the moderators will be in Santa Fe later this week  <br/>
and through the weekend, some posts might not be approved as quickly  <br/>
as they might otherwise have been.  If you&#39;re newish to the list and  <br/>
you post and you don&#39;t see it come through, if it&#39;s in your outgoing  <br/>
mail, don&#39;t re-post it please.<br/>
<br/>
If you post something and responses are slow, it might also be because  <br/>
some of the regulars are driving or in Santa Fe or are just elsewhere  <br/>
recovering from the holidays.  Please accept erratic list behavior for  <br/>
the next week or so.  Even though I&#39;m not going to Santa Fe until  <br/>
Wednesday morning, I feel like I&#39;m packing up half the house, and  <br/>
Holly&#39;s coming home from six weeks in England tonight, so I&#39;m sure  <br/>
I&#39;ll put a lot of energy toward hearing her stories and making her  <br/>
some favorite foods.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
