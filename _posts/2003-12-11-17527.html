&gt;A friend of mine has carved and drilled lots of heishi beads.  He uses <br/>

antique treadle-driven dentist&#39;s drill.<br/>
<br/>
I tried looking at google, and found this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I got a high-speed drill and used special tungsten drill-bits<br/>
first. As the first rather expensive bit broke I have tried then<br/>
dentist&#39;s bits which LJ got as a &#39;present&#39; from her dentist recently. <br/>
The<br/>
later ones worked fine but it has taken me the whole Sunday morning<br/>
drilling these tiny holes. I couldn&#39;t believe that shells have such a<br/>
hard housing crust in few cases even rather brittle too. <br/>
