<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332758642">I wrote a deschooling article years back, and recommended a short list of movies.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s that list with my note from the 2002 article:<br/>
<br/>
Mary Poppins<br/>
Heidi (with Shirley Temple)<br/>
The Sound of Music<br/>
Searching for Bobby Fischer (&quot;Innocent Moves&quot; is the British title)<br/>
Ferris Bueller�s Day Off<br/>
<br/>
You don�t need to think too hard about those movies. No tests, analysis or reports. Just let the images and ideas flow through and over you. Come back to them sometime, when you�ve been unschooling a while.<br/>
Today, Pam Laricchia sent out a newsletter with a really great deschooling take on Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day off:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551202687">Another, �School of Rock�.<br/>
In one scene of the movie, the principal of the school (Joan Cusack) is<br/>
being confronted by a crowd of angry parents and she says: �Let me assure<br/>
you that nothing is more important to us than for you *to feel* your<br/>
children<br/>
are in a safe and secure environment.� (emphasis added)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094982525">Nice quote, Virginia.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
School of Rock and Accepted are mentioned here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/movies/">http://sandradodd.com/t/movies/</a><br/>
and that&#39;s easy to find from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/movies">http://sandradodd.com/movies</a><br/>
<br/>
Watching movies can be healing and soothing, and watching them with children is bonding and helps you learn more about each other.<br/>
<br/>
There are ideas in there for following trails, too—letting one movie lead to another, through favorite actors, or writers, or directors, or soundtracks, or topics.<br/>
