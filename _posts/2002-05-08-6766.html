The first composer to write for a euphonium like instrument was Wagner . <br/>
Wagner wrote for a tuba (Wagnerian Tuba) which was a modified French horn. It <br/>
had a slightly larger bore but was not as large as a modern tuba. The <br/>
instruments Wagner scored for were in effect bass French horns.-=-</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949392987">I just found this tidbit at the Oregon Symphony Players website:<br/>
<br/>
**Wagner developed his own brass instrument, the<br/>
                                        tubin (now called a &quot;Wagner<br/>
tuba&quot;), which is not wholly<br/>
                                        realated. He used the tuba<br/>
extensively, notably for the<br/>
                                        dragon&#39;s music in Ring cycle. **<br/>
<br/>
That pretty much answers my question.  And I dug up a CD of horn music<br/>
and am listening to a bit of Wagnerian Siegfried stuff (when not drowned<br/>
out by strange sounds of boyish exuberance).<br/>
