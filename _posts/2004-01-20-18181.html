<div id="ygrps-yiv-785166935">Wow! This board is really busy today! Anyhow I wanted to give my <br/>
views on the topics being discussed.<br/>
As far as menstral periods I frankly prefer tampons, my parents <br/>
didn&#39;t tell me about them, instead they bought me these hughly thick <br/>
big pads when I started my period -- first day of jr high school -- <br/>
I really dislike thinking of those memories. Well luckily life has <br/>
moved on since then and I have found that OB tampons are my favorite <br/>
because you just use your finger to position them which for me is <br/>
more comfortable than cardboard or plastic applicator - when I&#39;ve <br/>
had to borrow one it always seemed like I used the applicator and <br/>
then had to &quot;reposition&quot; it until it was comfortable anyhow. I also <br/>
thought that tampons were just cotten so what else is in there that <br/>
is so unnatural? Also the OB tampons come in several sizes of which <br/>
girls can always use the smaller size.<br/>
As for potty training boys I&#39;ve done that a few times, my son was <br/>
totally trained and when he went to preschool (didn&#39;t last long but <br/>
that&#39;s another story) he was having an accident everyday. We finally <br/>
got it out of him that it was because he wasn&#39;t pulling his pants <br/>
down like he had learned at home but he was just pushing them down <br/>
far enough to get the penis out and then would pee because that is <br/>
what he saw the other boys in his class doing. I felt bad because I <br/>
had never shown this to him so he had no experiences at keeping his <br/>
elastic banded pants from going back up while he was peeing - <br/>
therefor the accidents!!! And of course his pants were only a little <br/>
wet in front but my son is particular about being dry so he would <br/>
always say he had an accident so the teacher would let him change <br/>
clothes. I of course also got onto my husband about needing to go <br/>
potty with him more as well. <br/>
Now as for the nakedness I will say that I don&#39;t censor what my ds <br/>
watches on TV or the language he uses (although he doesn&#39;t really <br/>
use much &quot;bad&quot; language and he is only 5 almost 6. I don&#39;t really <br/>
run around the house naked much because I can&#39;t stand to be naked <br/>
because my breasts went opposite directions after breastfeeding and <br/>
I am afraid I would give a poor view of what women look like. My <br/>
mother died of breast cancer and I have a sister who is recovered <br/>
(hopefully) so I am prettymuch terrified of what my breasts look <br/>
like to be honest, and that is something I need to deal with and not <br/>
him. However if my son does come into my room while I am getting <br/>
dressed or the bathroom when I&#39;m taking a shower I try to just go <br/>
about finishing what I&#39;m doing and not make a thing out of it. <br/>
Anyhow I do think if the first exposure my son got of sex was a <br/>
porno flick then it would be devistating, I would much rather him <br/>
see somekind of relationship going on as well as you do see in most <br/>
movies that have love scenes in them. But then he has sneaked up on <br/>
me and his father (my husband) while we were kissing pretty <br/>
intensely and didn&#39;t know he was standing there watching us and I <br/>
don&#39;t think he thought much about it! Like it was just something <br/>
natural for mom&#39;s and dad&#39;s to do - which it is.</div>

they&#39;ll absorb more. There&#39;s also the toxic shock factor. Leave them in too <br/>
long, and you&#39;re open to that. And then there&#39;s whatever chemical chlorine <br/>
bleach turns into that also isn&#39;t good, and that will be absorbed into your <br/>
bloodstream.<br/>

used to raise it...plus, they are rapped in rayon,<br/>
which is a product made from wood pulp, and all of it<br/>
is bleached, which makes it full of dioxins.<br/>

wall. I haven&#39;t used one since. Yuck.<br/>
