<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537266585">4. Surround your child with text of all kinds and he/she will learn  <br/>
to read. Read to them, read in front of them, help them, don&#39;t push  <br/>
them. Children allowed to learn on their own timetable do learn to  <br/>
read at widely divergent times�there is NO right time for all  <br/>
children. Some learn to read at three years old and others at 12 or  <br/>
even older. It doesn&#39;t matter. Children who are not yet reading are  <br/>
STILL learning�support their learning in their own way. Pushing  <br/>
children to try to learn to read before they are developmentally  <br/>
ready is probably a major cause of long-term antipathy toward  <br/>
reading, at best, and reading disabilities, at worst.<br/>
