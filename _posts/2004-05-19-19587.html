The Sound of Music<br/>
Annie  (the newer Disney version leaves out the alcohol abuse of the Carol <br/>
Burnett one)<br/>
Pirates of Penzance maybe<br/>
Cinderella (with Brandy and Paolo Montalban)<br/>
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat<br/>
<br/>
(Holly helped me think of these.)<br/>
<br/>
Cats  [not a classic example of musical, and hard to follow<br/>
<br/>
Would the assault of Aldonza in Man of La Mancha be too rough for them?<br/>
It&#39;s a little bit complicated to explain (the whole story), but you could <br/>
talk about early theatre and the inquisition.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Out along with the other two (JC Superstar  and Hair):  <br/>
Chicago<br/>
Paint Your Wagon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226169498">Oh, man, you&#39;ve knocked out two of our favorites... let me guess, no<br/>
Chorus Line either? Cabaret? Rent? Gypsy? Chicago? Ragtime? Les Miz? All<br/>
the ones we love seem a little questionable...<br/>
<br/>
Okay, thinking of wholesome family fare. How about:<br/>
Wicked (Rain&#39;s current fave)<br/>
Fiddler on the Roof<br/>
The Sound of Music<br/>
Bye Bye Birdie (just &#39;cause it&#39;s a fun one, and many 6th graders can<br/>
relate)<br/>
The Wiz (compare with the original, maybe?)<br/>
The Music Man<br/>
<br/>
I can count to 5, really, I just didn&#39;t know which to leave out... and I<br/>
know I&#39;m forgetting a bunch of good ones.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could try to find a community production playing near the<br/>
school and go see it, too....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235181077">I have always loved Kismet and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (Kismet being my fave)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it fits, but I also love O Brother Where Art Thou.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen it, but a couple of people where talking about Carmen: A HipHopra last night at work, may be to racy though.<br/>
<br/>
What about any of the remakes of Shakespears works? Could you show the older and newer versions? <br/>
<br/>
I never was able to &quot;get&quot; his work until I saw the remakes, I was then able to watch and read Shakespeare with a drame work that I could understand.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if this is what your looking for, it&#39;s early and the coffee has yet to kick in. ;)<br/>

<br/>
DOH!  <br/>
<br/>
WIzard of OZ!   I forgot it&#39;s readily available now. &lt;g&gt;  You don&#39;t have to <br/>
wait all year for one shot on TV.  Maybe the original.   <br/>
<br/>
Showing kids a movie with Michael Jackson in it might be too disruptive this <br/>
year.  Who knows what parents will get torqued off about.  Oh!  And Diana Ross <br/>
isn&#39;t having her best legal year either.   I know that shouldn&#39;t matter with <br/>
musicians and static performances captured on film and all, but some people <br/>
care more about a performer&#39;s morals than ability.<br/>
<br/>
I really like Fiddler on the Roof, but there are no little kids.  Kids like <br/>
to see kids.<br/>
<br/>
Music Man is one of my husband&#39;s favorites, but to me it seems draggy and the <br/>
main character being a con man is a possible negative.<br/>
<br/>
About the music/morality thing, I was at a thrift store and there was a whole <br/>
stack of Amy Grant cassette tapes.  Someone let go of his or her whole <br/>
collection, and it reminded me of one of my favorite (but not flattering) <br/>
homeschooling stories.  It&#39;s a flattering unschooling story, or at least a flattering <br/>
Kirby story (and I&#39;ve told it before but just in case, for new people...)<br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago or so when AOL was the hoppinest homeschooling source on earth, <br/>
there were kids chats sometimes, in an AOL chatroom (like a gang-instant <br/>
message).  Kirby was REALLY interested at first, and I had to type for him, but I <br/>
would read to him and he would say what I should write.<br/>
<br/>
Poor guy didn&#39;t know how lame the world could be.<br/>
<br/>
So in a chat with 15 or so kids, someone wrote &quot;Who&#39;s your favorite singer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby really thought, and said &quot;Julie Andrews,&quot; and I wrote that, as the <br/>
others were all, every one, entering &quot;Amy Grant&quot; and Kirby said &quot;Michael Jackson.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So in a sea of nothing but &quot;Amy Grant&quot; were Kirby&#39;s two.<br/>
<br/>
He actually thought the question had been whose singing voice do you like, or <br/>
who do you think is a good singer.    Seems the question had really been who <br/>
will your mom let you listen to?  So Kirby&#39;s next utterance was, &quot;Who&#39;s Amy <br/>
Grant!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But it does seem that the majority of families can care more about perceived <br/>
safety than actual value based on quality of music or performance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just saw my 1st Broadway show this past weekend.  My first trip to <br/>
NYC!  It was as great time.<br/>
Mother daughter trip.<br/>
We saw the new Broadway hit.  &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; and it really was <br/>
wonderful.  About 2 sisters coming to the big city from Ohio.<br/>
We also saw &quot;Gypsy&quot; with Bernadette Peters as the mother.  It was <br/>
good, but &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; was better.<br/>
We also like &quot;Cats.&quot;<br/>
&quot;My Fair Lady&quot;<br/>
&quot;Hello Dolly&quot;<br/>
&quot;Singing in the Rain&quot;<br/>
My 13 yo dd,  Carly is giving me this list.  She said &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
get &quot;Carousel&quot;, cause it&#39;s the stupidest musical ever&quot;. She also <br/>
didn&#39;t like &quot;Jesus Christ, Super Star&quot;, but it&#39;s been a while, and I <br/>
told her she should watch it again now that she&#39;s a little older.<br/>
She loves musicals and always impresses old people when she knows <br/>
actors of thier generation.  <br/>

I just read the other replies; one thing about Camelot is the story hinges<br/>
on adultery, if that matters to your group/parents.  It might matter to the<br/>
kids, if they&#39;re not into mushy stuff ;-)  Still, seeing Richard Harris as<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448974622">Rain would be a fifth grader if she were in school, and she owns the<br/>
video, and has memorized most of the songs... I&#39;m just thinking how<br/>
different life is now that everyone owns a VCR! <br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a huge difference between seeing a musical on video and<br/>
seeing a live show, though. Rain rented the video of Le Miz and stopped<br/>
watching halfway into it because she was bored (but left in on for the<br/>
songs), but the actual Broadway show was here fave ever. I almost never<br/>
watch shows on video, because it&#39;s generally such a pale imitation of the<br/>
real thing. I think movies are meant to be seen as movies, and shows are<br/>
meant to be seen live. I&#39;m not sure how that helps Joylyn - unless you<br/>
can take lots of field trips - but I&#39;m not sure there are many videos of<br/>
shows that will really hold kids&#39; interest for two hours. Maybe get a<br/>
script and some CDs of the music?<br/>
<br/>
Last night we were doing dinner and a show (Our Town) with some friends,<br/>
including Rain and two other girls a little older than Rain, all active<br/>
in local theatre and all current or former homeschoolers... we went to<br/>
Max&#39;s Opera Cafe, where the waiters sing show tunes in between serving<br/>
tables. We kept trying to suggest songs for our waiter to sing and he<br/>
kept apologetically telling us that the song wasn&#39;t appropriate for their<br/>
crowd, which did include some old ladies and young kids... but still, it<br/>
was amazing how how many musicals were full of objectionable songs.<br/>
<br/>
Into The Woods probably wouldn&#39;t be allowed either, huh? Maybe just the<br/>
first act?<br/>
<br/>
I agree with whoever said Carousel was deadly boring. Rain was in it, and<br/>
it was a pretty good production,  and I still found it deadly boring.<br/>
Carnival wasn&#39;t great either.<br/>
<br/>
I think Peter Pan would be fun. A lot of old stuff that isn&#39;t PC makes a<br/>
great springboard for discussion, as long as you make it clear that<br/>
you&#39;re not showing it because you agree with all of the stereotypes. Show<br/>
Boat might work, too, even with the &quot;Colored folks work on the<br/>
Mississippi&quot;, with the same caveats - although Joe and Queenie are<br/>
actually two of the wisest characters in that show. There&#39;s a really old<br/>
video of that that&#39;s really good, like from the 1930s.<br/>

<br/>
For the record, I&#39;m not arguing against Hair personally in any way. But many<br/>
of you might be amazed at what some people in schools object to. Here&#39;s a<br/>
recent example:<br/>
<br/>
In one of my husband&#39;s shows, he plays a penguin, and the penguin says &quot;we<br/>
just do that for the halibut.&quot; A teacher made him take it out of the second<br/>
show. Just the idea that a kid might understand it was a play on &quot;hell of<br/>
it&quot; was too inappropriate for them.<br/>
<br/>
Oy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23318596">Hi, There~We&#39;re pretty new to group w/not much time for intro. I&#39;m Debbie, <br/>
son Shane is 5 1/2 and we live just outside Santa Fe. I&#39;m single mom, editor, <br/>
writer supporting Shane in exploring his world his way. We live w/four dogs, two <br/>
cats and two fish.<br/>
<br/>
Had a few suggestions for the musical.<br/>
<br/>
The local kids theatre here in Santa Fe has done Charlie and the Chocolate <br/>
Factory, You&#39;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown, Alice In Wonderland, Through the <br/>
Looking Glass and also Little Shop of Horrors (a fave of mine and I feel <br/>
appropriate for 6th graders). Other suggestions: Annie, The Sound of Music, hosting a <br/>
world musicfest...teaching a little about countries, regional <br/>
culture...something like that tied to music, CATS. Also, remember perhaps the actual songs of <br/>
some musicals may be considered innapropriate but they can be modified or <br/>
ommitted.<br/>
<br/>
I did a quick search of &quot;easy children&#39;s musicals&quot; and found <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/9007/90241">http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/9007/90241</a> with some cute alternative ideas, they suggest <br/>
shows to actually see...but they seem to be also great springboard ideas to <br/>
work from.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
Debbie~:)  <br/>

&lt;&lt; also Little Shop of Horrors (a fave of mine and I feel <br/>
appropriate for 6th graders). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
performed by a children&#39;s theater would be GREAT for 6th graders.  <br/>
<br/>
If the movie is to be used, some parents might not like it.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer for us to be even discussing the sad decisions necessary for teachers <br/>
to make based on what parents will allow.  It&#39;s a good reminder, though that <br/>
we don&#39;t need to worry about those things at our own homes.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have watched Rocky Horror and Little Shop of Horrors for quite a <br/>
while, but that&#39;s my kids at my house.  When other kids are over I don&#39;t put on <br/>
the South Park movie (also a musical, with some GREAT parody of other musicals&#39; <br/>
styles and bits).  <br/>
<br/>
Holly and Marty got to see Little Shop of Horrors live before they saw it on <br/>
video.  That was fun.  We saw it in Minnesota, in a town called St Joseph <br/>
maybe?  A small town with live theatre.  Later we saw it at Menaul High School in <br/>
Albuquerque.  We had a little girl with us who was only seven or eight.  She <br/>
and Holly sat down near the front together.  When Mushnik was going to water <br/>
the plant, she sat up straight and yelled &quot;NO!  DON&#39;T!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was SO cool.  The actor turned and looked at her, still in character, like <br/>
he was thinking about what she&#39;d said.  The doowop girls and others on the <br/>
sides of the stage tried not to laugh.  The audience laughed and Mushnik and the <br/>
plant waited. <br/>
<br/>
So twice I&#39;ve gotten to be at performances with kids who didn&#39;t know what was <br/>
going to happen, and I LOVE that!<br/>
