2. Substitute &quot;property&quot; for &quot;parental&quot; and see how ideas play.<br/>
<br/>
Might be useful to play &quot;follow the money&quot;  and first trail to follow might<br/>
be path utilized by followers of &quot;firstest and bestest solution is amend the<br/>
constitution&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what I sent to unschoolingbasics in case anyone here is seeing  <br/>
worth in the site:<br/>
<br/>
Three clicks and I&#39;m looking at Michael Farris.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parentalrights.org/about/board-of-directors">http://www.parentalrights.org/about/board-of-directors</a><br/>
<br/>
I had a sneaking suspicion that site would lead to a fundamentalist<br/>
Christian connection. Michael Farris and company are big against the<br/>
UN  Convention on the Rights of Children.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some links I sent to someone last time Michael Farris&#39;s name<br/>
came up:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He and the pillars are responsible for crushing the livelihood of<br/>
&gt; the unschooling mother who ran Gentle Spirit magazine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A report is here:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeedmag.com/seelhoffvs.welch/news.html">http://www.homeedmag.com/seelhoffvs.welch/news.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Her reference to her court case against them is here (she won):<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jesus I believe would be appalled at the behavior done in his name.<br/>
&gt; Definitely not WWJD.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And that&#39;s just on a personal level. Reading extensively about<br/>
&gt; HSLDA is a good idea:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A very good article in Salon Magazine:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/10/02/">http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/10/02/</a><br/>
&gt; homeschooling_battle/index.html<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And a well organized collection of information at:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hsislegal.com/whoishslda.asp">http://hsislegal.com/whoishslda.asp</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is old and tough going but nonetheless eye opening:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeedmag.com/INF/FREE/hsinfo_far1.html">http://homeedmag.com/INF/FREE/hsinfo_far1.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, a lot of it is old. HSLDA and Michael Farris have gotten a lot<br/>
&gt; more savvy about how they go about business. And HSLDA is<br/>
&gt; fortunately no longer an exclusive storehouse of information on<br/>
&gt; homeschooling so people are more likely to go to other resources<br/>
&gt; than complain about HSLDA now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But better ability to spin their current actions doesn&#39;t change<br/>
&gt; past behavior and the choices they consciously made as<br/>
&gt; representatives of Christ.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately some people are so fearful and feel so powerless  <br/>
they&#39;re afraid not to believe.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA is good at scaring people into giving them money.<br/>
