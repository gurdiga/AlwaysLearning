<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701741548">I am new to the group and also new to unschooling.  I love reading all<br/>
the posts, but so far i have not introduced myself.  I have a 12 year<br/>
old daughter who has been to public school most of her life, but<br/>
neither of us could stand the &quot;girl fights&quot; that persist at this age.<br/>
 I thought  junior high was hell on earth (I am a 6&#39; tall intelligent<br/>
geek) so why would I put her through the same thing?  I was actually<br/>
pretty good at skipping school and forgery, which gave me some relief.<br/>
 I live in Colorado, but my daughter and I love to travel, which is a<br/>
nice way to learn and to spend time together. <br/>
<br/>
I have never wanted to nag my family about things (except Sunblock,<br/>
the call me a Sunscreen Nazi)and have low standards about the house. <br/>
I do actually like to pick up things at times just to see what she is<br/>
up to.        She still likes to play with American Girl dolls, Beanie<br/>
Babies, and stuffed animals but she doesn&#39;t want anyone to witness<br/>
this.  I think it is great that she can be a kid and enjoy pretending,<br/>
one of the benefits of being at home.  Occaisionally, I will say &quot;I<br/>
will be ready to go as soon as you take some of your shoes to your<br/>
room&quot; because she is highly motivated to get out of the house.  She<br/>
loves shoes, but does not wear them any longer than absolutely required.<br/>
<br/>
We spend time most days training dogs, a passion we share.  My two<br/>
older daughters (26 and 19) have created a web site together;<br/>
bordercollies.omegan.org.  My oldest daughter was homeschooled for<br/>
highschool, using a curriculum but little direction from me.  She went<br/>
to a college for younger scholars called Simon&#39;s Rock in Great<br/>
Barrington, MA when she was 15.  I mostly wanted to get her away from<br/>
an older boyfriend, which was only partially successful because she<br/>
went back to him after getting her Associates degree.  He was<br/>
emotionally abusive which I probably recognized since I was in a<br/>
similar situation with her father at about the same age.  Luckily, we<br/>
both came to our senses in time in spite of our concerned mothers,<br/>
whom we both ignored. <br/>
<br/>
She went back to college and majored in Religious Studies, deciding in<br/>
her final year of college that she did not care to work in this field<br/>
because she follows no specific religion.  She was also diagnosed with<br/>
M.S. her final year in college, which helped her decide not to go to<br/>
graduate school.  She took several web design classes, which has led<br/>
to several jobs in that area and also led her to meeting a nice fellow<br/>
who also works in that field.  She has been married for almost two<br/>
years and now works for Santa Fe Greenhouse making their online<br/>
catalog function nicely.  Together, she and her dh are involved<br/>
putting on an annual in a science fiction conference called Bubonicon<br/>
in Albuquerque.  <br/>
<br/>
I also found a much nicer fellow whom I have been married to for<br/>
almost 22 years.  He was not too supportive of homeschooling, but even<br/>
he recognized that you can lead a horse to water but you can&#39;t make<br/>
her drink!  My youngest daughter is now much easier to be around, and<br/>
much healthier emotionally.  We are enjoying deschooling, dogs, and<br/>
travel. <br/>
