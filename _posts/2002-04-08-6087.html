Cool! They are native to us here in FL but we never knew what to feed them. <br/>
No one was interested enough in capturing some to research what food they <br/>
needed...now that we know maybe we&#39;ll grab a couple! They&#39;re really hard to <br/>
see in nature, I almost walked right on one because they blend so well.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with you Dar, about rats.<br/>
When we were kids we always had Gerbils...usually a litter every so often <br/>
too. Once when we left town for a couple of days our cat got crafty and <br/>
actually pulled out one of the Habitrail components (that was taped down mind <br/>
you) and got to the Gerbils. It was awful, especially since there was a new <br/>
litter of babies that time. We always had very wise, very cunning cats around.<br/>
One of them got my two parakeets even! That&#39;s quite a story.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for all the info. I&#39;m thinking the Gecko would be really <br/>
cool....getting excited about a pet or two again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We sometimes found it hard to spot them in the jar!  Keep in mind that <br/>
yours might be a different variety and eat different things.  If I found <br/>
some in the wild, I&#39;d probably give them the raspberry or blackberry leaves <br/>
along with whatever kind of plant we found them on or near.  You&#39;d see <br/>
pretty fast what was being eaten and what wasn&#39;t.<br/>
