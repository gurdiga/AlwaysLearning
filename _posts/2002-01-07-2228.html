<div id="ygrps-yiv-329571385">OK, Dan took up my challenge and posted a photo from our wedding.  Can you<br/>
tell from the giant glasses what the year was?  No gray hair and skinny.  No<br/>
kid yet.  Hmmmmm, correlation?  Come on, someone else do this too or I&#39;ll<br/>
feel silly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556754691">Oh girl, you do not want to go there &lt;g&gt;.  Give me an inch and that whole<br/>
site will be nothin but me and the kin.<br/>
<br/>
I found a picture of me a couple months ago and it is the same age Dana is<br/>
right now, everyone who looks at it says &quot;what a cute picture of Dana&quot;, they<br/>
can&#39;t believe the resemblance when I say it is me.<br/>
<br/>
I do have some pics of Joe and I on our wedding day with the girls, they<br/>
look so sweet and innocent(they were 8 and 6 when we married).  There were<br/>
some tough days when I thought I made the biggest mistake being a<br/>
stepmother, but then I remember how much I love them and it all goes away.<br/>
