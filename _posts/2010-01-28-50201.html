<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402572432">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Negativity is unquestionably, absolutely, immediately bad for kids, though.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering if I could ask you to expand on this idea or explain it more? I can&#39;t think of any examples of negativity being good for kids, but I guess when I see a statement that seems so emphatic, it makes me want to know more about the thinking behind it.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m a little behind in reading my digests...this was in the TV thread, in response to something about micro-waves or EMFs or something like that. I can&#39;t seem to find it again. Sorry.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

But you had it to quote it.  And you could have gone to the groups page (at the bottom of the e-mails it has a link) and looked in the messages.<br/>

So you can&#39;t think of any situations in which it would be wrong, but you want more explanation?  Really?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure this link was with the other stuff there:<br/>

<br/>
If there are people here who think negativity is as good as happiness, go ahead and do what you&#39;re going to do with your families, but don&#39;t suggest to anyone that unschoolers told you it didn&#39;t matter what the tone and mood were in your homes.<br/>
