<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686181735"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Oh, we love Peapod here (where we order groceries online). Not only can <br/>
&gt;&gt;you shop in the serenity of your own home, they bring it in, up the <br/>
&gt;&gt;stairs. Including the enormous bags of kitty litter. It is a gift from the <br/>
&gt;&gt;goddess!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually did this job for a couple of years when Conor was 2/3/4 years <br/>
old. Does that qualify me for goddess status? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say Conor ws an &quot;easy&quot; toddler. He was just happy to be with me <br/>
and sat in the cart and smiled while we shopped. I would shop for 3 or 4 <br/>
people at the same time, pulling one cart and pushing another. Trouble was, <br/>
I would make the moms who ordered from us feel bad that they couldn&#39;t do <br/>
their own shopping (for whatevewr reason). I didn&#39;t try to, but they had a <br/>
hard time seeing Conor coming with me while I delivered their bags. :-/ <br/>
Which of course made me feel bad for making another mom feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do they actually choose good veggies and other fresh<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stuff? and expiration dates?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did. It was part of my &quot;training&quot;. ;-) And we would take back anything <br/>
that the customer didn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
It was a good service. I actually used them when Casey was born. There was <br/>
no way *that* kid was going to sit in a cart and smile at me. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

I think so! :-)<br/>
<br/>
My parents are both disabled.  It is very hard for them to shop.  I used to<br/>
do all their shopping for them until we moved away. Now they have a local<br/>
teenager do odd jobs for them, including grocery shopping, pick up meds,<br/>
drive them to doctor&#39;s appts, mow the lawn, move large items around the<br/>
house, etc.  They pay him  well for his time.  He is going off to college<br/>
this fall and his younger brother is going to take over most of the jobs for<br/>
him.  If the &quot;boys&quot; are unavailable sometimes their mother will help out<br/>
too.  It&#39;s a good deal for them and my parents.</div>
