<div id="ygrps-yiv-522901215">Today is day five of nine, halfway through driver&#39;s ed for Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
He got his learner&#39;s permit the second day, so theoretically could be driving <br/>
around.  But my car went into the shop two days before that and still isn&#39;t <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sunday night I took him to a parking lot near here, at midnight, and he <br/>
repeatedly started and stopped the 20 year old Jetta with the standard <br/>
transmission.  I told him if he could deal with a clutch, the automatic would <br/>
be click-and-point in comparison.  There was no shifting to 2nd, just driving <br/>
around in first, parking, going again, letting it die from letting the clutch <br/>
out too fast, getting it flooded from too much starting.... the usual.  He <br/>
felt bad about the herky-jerkiness of getting it to go, and half the time it <br/>
was pretty smooth.  I told him nobody learns to drive a standard without some <br/>
of those crazy jerky starts.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that he hasn&#39;t driven since he got the permit (he drove the van <br/>
some a couple of years ago, on not-real roads, as have Marty and Holly).  <br/>
Maybe the van will be done today.  The transmission had something broken.  <br/>
Truly broken.  But under warranty from the second full rebuild.  I shudder...<br/>
<br/>
So my washing machine is also broken and the part won&#39;t be here for four days.<br/>
<br/>
Today Keith&#39;s coming home early to drive us to the laundramat.<br/>
<br/>
But back to driver&#39;s ed.<br/>
<br/>
The first day they had a pre-test.  The teacher asked if everyone was <br/>
through.  Everyone was, but Kirby, who had three more left.<br/>
<br/>
My fear came true.  He had never been to school at all, and he didn&#39;t know <br/>
now to do it.<br/>
<br/>
There was a question sheet and an answer sheet.  Kirby was circling the right <br/>
letter and then writing out the right answer.  Everyone else just circled the <br/>
right letter (or whatever letter struck their fancy).   <br/>
<br/>
He got seven out of ten.  Missed one about hydroplaning which he said wasn&#39;t <br/>
worded well to get the answer they wanted.  I totally believe him.<br/>
<br/>
Th third day, Monday, they had a truck driver talk to them.  He told them how <br/>
to drive around big trucks, and other tales of big trucks.  Then they all <br/>
went outside where his actual Big Truck was and he asked if anyone wanted to <br/>
get in it.  Kirby said he looked around, and the kids were just kinda <br/>
shuffling and avoiding eye contact (something fairly new to him &lt;g&gt;), and so <br/>
he said &quot;I will!&quot; and did.  <br/>
<br/>
They went through showing and talking about blind spots.  Teenaged girls, <br/>
jumping and waving; Kirby couldn&#39;t see them.  Giant block of concrete with <br/>
just happened to be there.  Kirby couldn&#39;t see it with the mirrors at all.  <br/>
&quot;Nearly the size of a VW BUG,&quot; said the truck driver.<br/>
<br/>
So Kirby got out and he asked &quot;Who else?&quot;  Nobody.  Kirby said &quot;I&#39;ll go <br/>
again!&quot; and that shamed a couple of girls into volunteering.<br/>
<br/>
The first two days he didn&#39;t make any friends.  The third day he made three, <br/>
he said, and in the course of telling the story, he named them casually.  All <br/>
girls.  I&#39;m not surprised.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a homeschooled girl there, but Kirby hasn&#39;t introduced himself to her.<br/>
There&#39;s a girl he recognized from Active Imagination (a while back) but he <br/>
said she didn&#39;t seem to recognize him, probably because he used to have  hair <br/>
past the middle of his back that&#39;s now short.  He told me this morning he&#39;s <br/>
glad he didn&#39;t associate himself with her, because she&#39;s the one who&#39;s always <br/>
disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
He likes the teacher.  &quot;Mr. Martinez is cool,&quot; he said.   Yesterday they <br/>
talked about drugs.  They have to for six hours, Kirby said.  So two more <br/>
hours today, and that might mean that today is the scary-movie day.  &quot;Blood <br/>
on the Highway,&quot; I think Brett said it&#39;s called.  Everyone I&#39;ve talked to who <br/>
saw it was disturbed, and certainly it&#39;s mean to be disturbing.  But if <br/>
today&#39;s the day I&#39;ll give Kirby more privacy and more slack til he gets <br/>
settled.<br/>
<br/>
He works from 3:00 to 7:30 today anyway, so will only be home for a couple of <br/>
hours.  <br/>

Cross yesterday.  They taught them cpr and first aide along with <br/>
basic babysitting stuff.  As I dropped her off I realized that she <br/>
would be taking a couple of tests to earn her certificate.  I thought <br/>
of Kirby&#39;s story and wondered how she would do with it.  Never having <br/>
taken a test.  When I picked her up, I asked her how it went.  She <br/>
had a good time.  I asked about the test and she said it was multiple <br/>
choice and she thought she did fine.  I asked if she was nervous <br/>
about it since she hadn&#39;t done that before.  She said, &quot;I&#39;ve taken <br/>
tons of them mom.  In magazines.&quot;  Duh....the teenage girl magazines <br/>
are full of those quizzes.<br/>
