<div id="ygrps-yiv-934009042"> Understanding accents has a lot to do with how you feel about the person<br/>
speaking, and about differences in identity.  There&#39;s a study from the<br/>
University of Washington where college students were shown images of different<br/>
people as they listened to different accents.  They found that when people<br/>
heard a recording of a woman speaking with a generic American accent but the<br/>
image was of a Chinese woman&#39;s face, the accent was rated extremely difficult to<br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when people have been drinking a little bit, they understand each other&#39;s<br/>
accents much better (although drinking too much can create new pronunciation<br/>
difficulties! :-)  Being relaxed and open to understanding helps.<br/>
<br/>
A good waitress can understand almost anyone, because she already knows that<br/>
from among the infinite possibilities of what any person might randomly say to<br/>
her, what a person typically wants to say to a waitress is drawn from such a<br/>
small list of topics that she can usually guess based just on body language.<br/>
Success in learning a foreign language follows a bell curve - about 7% of people<br/>
can learn a new language or accent flawlessly, about 7% seem unable to learn one<br/>
at all, and everyone else falls somewhere in between, with most in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
But when someone retains an accent for years despite living in a new<br/>
environment, it is often because they want, consciously or unconsciously, to<br/>
maintain their identity as a person from &#39;that other place.&#39;  By contrast, a<br/>
person who adopts a new accent quickly does so because they identify strongly<br/>
with the new &#39;place&#39;.  My brother, forty-something, moved from California where<br/>
he grew up to Rhode Island for law school.  Within 2 weeks, he was saying &#39;pahk<br/>
the cah&#39; which to me screamed, &quot;I love this place and want to be one of these<br/>
people!!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dad moved to Canada from England when he was in short pants  <br/>
(elementary school) and 80 years later, he still had an English  <br/>
accent. It was part of who he was, though he didn&#39;t specifically  <br/>
identify with being an Englishman versus being a Canadian (of which he  <br/>
was very proud).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think, sometimes, that one can&#39;t help absorbing words or ways of  <br/>
speaking when you are living in a new country or part of the country.  <br/>
Part of it might be wanting to fit in better, to &quot;blend.&quot; Some of it&#39;s  <br/>
unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
I started saying &quot;*in*surance&quot; after I&#39;d been in WA for a couple of  <br/>
years. I didn&#39;t notice until a Canadian friend pointed it out  <br/>
(Canadians say &quot;in*sur* ance&quot;). I still say &quot;sem- ee&quot; instead of &quot;sem - <br/>
eye.&quot; My daughter says &quot;zee&quot; although she spent many more years saying  <br/>
&quot;zed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I pick up accents and even ways of speaking my own language when I go  <br/>
to different places. I&#39;ll start talking like a local in Hawai&#39;i (to  <br/>
the point that I got asked if I&#39;d gotten off work early that day).  <br/>
I&#39;ve talked like an Italian speaking English when I was in Italy. To  <br/>
me, it&#39;s a way to feel a part of things and it&#39;s usually unconscious,  <br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t say it screams anything other than relaxing into the  <br/>
place I am at the time.<br/>

<br/>
A good friend of mine is that way. He doesn&#39;t even know he&#39;s doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I know two people, one from Texas and one U.K. (mentioned previously)  <br/>
who are consciously maintaining that accent, hoping they can go back  <br/>
and not have lost it, in part.  Partly to be noticed.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases it can be tacky/rude not to blend a bit.  When my Brit  <br/>
friend says &quot;zed&quot; to people who have never, ever heard it, he&#39;s  <br/>
knowingly being antagonistic.  When I used to visit my granny in my  <br/>
tweens and teens, I said &quot;You guys&quot; ONCE and the blank stares or  <br/>
objections &quot;we ain&#39;t *guys*) reminded me.  I would use &quot;ya&#39;ll&quot; after  <br/>
that, if the plural was necessary.  They didn&#39;t hear &quot;ya&#39;ll&quot; at all in  <br/>
the &#39;60&#39;s, though nowadays it&#39;s fading some, I hear.<br/>
<br/>
If something is a conversation stopper, then using it isn&#39;t  <br/>
conversational.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088282052">My daughter Alma (8) is the same, whenever she stays with Belgium friends for <br/>
more than a day she comes back speaking Flemish instead of Dutch. It really <br/>
takes her a day again to revert back to Dutch. To me it sounds very endearing, <br/>
it has much softer consonants and longer vowels.<br/>

OMG I&#39;ve been having a tough time with regional American accents at work. I&#39;m not a waitress - I work in a Michaels crafts store, with a lot of choices. It&#39;s OK when people are asking about something simple and generic like &quot;glue&quot; - but for some reason I&#39;ve been getting people asking for &quot;balls&quot; or is it &quot;bowls&quot; and a few other similar sounding nouns and it&#39;s been tough.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily I have an obvious foreign accent - even though most mix it up as English rather than Australian - so I think the customers assume it affects my ability to hear them and people don&#39;t seem to mind repeating their requests to me. <br/>
<br/>
Funnily enough when I get another foreigner, it seems easier to get what they are talking about most of the time.<br/>
