Hi Tia,<br/>
I know this is off the topic at hand, but I wonder, where do you live now,<br/>
and how did you get out of the US?  Thanks.  Curious.  :)<br/>

I live on Vancouver Island near Victoria.  As to how I got *in* to Canada,<br/>
the immigration laws that we&#39;re criticized for by the US for making too lax<br/>
now, were a *lot* looser then.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now your email makes me think you&#39;re a musician or guitar maker or something<br/>
like that.  Can I ask about that?<br/>

&gt; I am having a similar problem with my Mom, although<br/>
&gt; not as severe, My thoughts are with you...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Kelly.  I hope things go well with your mother.  It&#39;s sure an<br/>
interesting journey, this role reversal we often have to do with our<br/>
parents.  The one thing my mother feared the most was her body hanging<br/>
around after her mind was gone.  It&#39;s not that far yet, by any means, but<br/>
it&#39;s a worry.<br/>
