<div id="ygrps-yiv-862377197">Just a week or so ago, I wrote this on my state list - it is NOT an <br/>
unschooling list, just a general list for all homeschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But,  I would also say that I don&#39;t think that is what unschooling is -<br/>
&gt; having a relaxed attitude about &quot;schooling.&quot; A &quot;relaxed attitude about<br/>
&gt; schooling&quot; could be someone who does schooling at home, but is relaxed<br/>
&gt; about it. I have a friend whose kids do Calvert Curriculum. They love<br/>
&gt; it. I&#39;m glad - it is right for them. They&#39;re very relaxed about it.<br/>
&gt; They do their lessons when they have time - they&#39;re okay with skipping<br/>
&gt; days, doing extra on other days. They gloss over stuff that doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem interesting to them and spend extra time on material they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; enjoying. They do the assignments that appeal to them and ignore those<br/>
&gt; that seem unnecessary. They&#39;re not stressed out over it, the kids enjoy<br/>
&gt; the time their mom spends working on their curriculum with them, the<br/>
&gt; mom grades their papers and kindly and gently helps them understand new<br/>
&gt; material and on and on. It is all very &quot;relaxed.&quot; But it is very very<br/>
&gt; far from unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling isn&#39;t being relaxed toward schooling, it is NOT schooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - at about the same time, my article (I Live Therefore I Learn) <br/>
came out in the state organization magazine - this same mom I was <br/>
writing about, above, showed it to her 12 yo son - and they got all <br/>
excited and started listing (right there in the margins of the <br/>
magazine) all the fun things they&#39;d like to do if they weren&#39;t spending <br/>
their time on the curriculum materials. They had a long list and they <br/>
decided that they&#39;re going to give up the curriculum and start <br/>
unschooling, instead, just because the curriculum is preventing them <br/>
from getting around to doing other things. She brought the magazine to <br/>
our park day yesterday and showed it to me - with all their notes <br/>
scribbled in it. This is such an interesting thing - her older son goes <br/>
to school this year - 9th grade. His choice to go to a special math and <br/>
science high school for gifted kids - he wants to go to the air force <br/>
academy, I think. He&#39;s very involved in Civil Air Patrol and already <br/>
flies gliders. So he has moved toward a more intense structured <br/>
demanding school life - while his little brother is becoming an <br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought it was interesting - and gratifying that an article could <br/>
really make such a difference in a kid&#39;s life. Our park day group is <br/>
pretty much made up of unschoolers and a few relaxed homeschoolers. <br/>
This is one of the founding families - even though they&#39;ve never been <br/>
close to being unschoolers, they have always hung out with unschoolers. <br/>
So, interesting to me that they&#39;ve decided to do it after many many <br/>
years of them doing curriculum while the rest of us unschooled.<br/>

<br/>
Just read your article. New to the list.  Always learning. :)  One <br/>
thing I was thinking when I read about your point that unschoolers <br/>
will have gaps in their education is so do schooled children.  No one <br/>
knows everything! :)  Of course.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just can&#39;t figure out how schools determine what should be <br/>
taught.  Having been schooled myself, I am having so much fun <br/>
unschooling my child as best I can since I get to share my interests <br/>
and share his and I am learning things I don&#39;t know every day as well!<br/>
<br/>
How fun!  :)  Sometimes I think I get the better end of the deal! :)<br/>
<br/>
Take care, c.<br/>

&gt; determine what should be taught.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Schools&quot; aren&#39;t really as monolithic as they seem.<br/>
Different schools choose different ways. And within<br/>
one school, different teachers choose different ways.<br/>
My parents were both teachers (now retired). <br/>
<br/>
My mom ran a grade school resource room (special ed<br/>
pullout program) and taught a lot of Colonial American<br/>
and English history because that&#39;s what she&#39;s<br/>
interested in. She did spelling or reading or writing<br/>
or whatever the kids were supposed to be working on<br/>
within that framework. She said her school taught far<br/>
too much Hispanic history (local interest) and she<br/>
felt the need to balance that.<br/>
<br/>
My dad taught high school history/civics type subjects<br/>
using standard (district-wide, I suppose) textbooks.<br/>
He required a weekly current events quiz in all his<br/>
classes, unlike his peers teaching the same course,<br/>
and taught history up to the present moment, unlike<br/>
most of his peers who quit at or before Vietnam.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all know from our own school careers how<br/>
different one teacher&#39;s class is from another. 3/4 of<br/>
the way through sixth grade I transferred to a new<br/>
school. Almost immediately, they did testing to<br/>
determine placement for junior high math. I was both<br/>
gifted and interested in math, but hadn&#39;t covered some<br/>
of the stuff on the test and was placed in average<br/>
math. I never recovered. While I fought the placement<br/>
and eventually got bumped up one level, I never got<br/>
onto the track to have calculus in high school. It&#39;s a<br/>
sore spot.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s no one set of things taught throughout<br/>
&quot;public schools.&quot; It varies hugely.<br/>

In both Britain and the United States, open classrooms contained no  <br/>
whole-class lessons, no standardized tests, and no detailed curriculum. The  best of <br/>
the open classrooms had planned settings where children came in  contact with <br/>
things, books, and one another at “interest centers” and learned  at their own <br/>
pace with the help of the teacher. Teachers structured the  classroom and <br/>
activities for individual students and small work groups. They  helped students <br/>
negotiate each of the reading, math, science, art, and other  interest centers <br/>
on the principle that children learn best when they are  interested and see <br/>
the importance of what they are doing.-=- <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577945180">When I was in public school, I spent one day a week in a pull-out &quot;gifted&quot; classroom, and we pretty much did get to do whatever we wanted to, within the confines of the school, anyway. As a fifth grader I did a year-long project about death, for example... I wrote a novel about how a family deals with a death, I read Elisabeth Kubler-Ross&#39; books about death and dying, and other books about death in other cultures. It was fascinating. The best part was that I never finished the novel or came up with any sort of final &quot;showcase&quot; for what I&#39;d learned, and it was okay. The next year I did a fairly long study of ESP...<br/>
<br/>
The message in gifted ed, during the seventies, anyway, was that because we were so brilliant, we would be interested in things besides schoolwork, and so they were giving us an opportunity to follow those pasions. The false assumption, of course, was that &quot;regular&quot; children didn&#39;t have thse kinds of interests and passions...<br/>
<br/>
Later, when I taught kids with ED/BD labels, I also got to &quot;teach&quot; pretty much what the kids were interested in. With my kids, the school mostly cared that they were engaged in doing *something* other than punching people, so we had the freedom to do a whole unit on boogers and butts, including pattern block patterns of anuses in action. I am not actually sure that the powers that be knew what we were doing all of the time, however...<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that the there tends to be a lot more freedom and leniency on the &quot;fringes&quot;, rather than in the mainstream. I see the same thought process in people who think unschooling is fine for children who are &quot;different&quot;, but not for &quot;regular&quot; kids. There&#39;s an assumption that if the system appears to be &quot;working&quot; for kids - they&#39;re not getting into trouble, their grades are good but not exceptional - then it&#39;s wrong to do anything else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767790686">I taught in an open classroom setting, only it was an alternative private school (started in the 70&#39;s, heehee) and they were going strong right up until this year. They are closing in June, and I understand that they changed their open concept to more structured learning due to pressure from parents. The only parents who could afford the tuition typically were &quot;highly educated&quot; profs from the local university and other professionals in the area who wanted the small private school setting but also wanted state standards met and formulaic curriculum. Being that it was a small town, there were no other choices. So they systematically forced the change at the only private school they had, through the parent-run board. Now it&#39;s closing. I&#39;m sure it lost its life and passion as soon as the kids lost the control.  <br/>
<br/>
In any case, open classroom settings, or open school settings like Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts can offer an unschooling setting within a community, I think.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I just can&#39;t figure out how schools determine what should be <br/>
&gt; taught.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Schools&quot; aren&#39;t really as monolithic as they seem.<br/>
Different schools choose different ways. And within one school, different<br/>
teachers choose different ways.<br/>
My parents were both teachers (now retired). <br/>
<br/>
My mom ran a grade school resource room (special ed pullout program) and<br/>
taught a lot of Colonial American and English history because that&#39;s what<br/>
she&#39;s interested in. She did spelling or reading or writing or whatever the<br/>
kids were supposed to be working on within that framework. She said her<br/>
school taught far too much Hispanic history (local interest) and she felt<br/>
the need to balance that.<br/>
<br/>
My dad taught high school history/civics type subjects using standard<br/>
(district-wide, I suppose) textbooks.<br/>
He required a weekly current events quiz in all his classes, unlike his<br/>
peers teaching the same course, and taught history up to the present moment,<br/>
unlike most of his peers who quit at or before Vietnam.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all know from our own school careers how different one teacher&#39;s<br/>
class is from another. 3/4 of the way through sixth grade I transferred to a<br/>
new school. Almost immediately, they did testing to determine placement for<br/>
junior high math. I was both gifted and interested in math, but hadn&#39;t<br/>
covered some of the stuff on the test and was placed in average math. I<br/>
never recovered. While I fought the placement and eventually got bumped up<br/>
one level, I never got onto the track to have calculus in high school. It&#39;s<br/>
a sore spot.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s no one set of things taught throughout &quot;public schools.&quot; It<br/>
varies hugely.<br/>
<br/>

I just read Summerhill and it&#39;s awesome! :)  I don&#39;t agree with all things,<br/>
esp the boarding school part and the bedtimes, but otherwise, it sounds like<br/>
a great place. :)  I know there are similar &#39;schools&#39; here, like Sudbury<br/>
Valley, but you&#39;d have to be a private school in order to avoid the testing<br/>
and curriculum rules here...  I&#39;ve read that Summerhill came under attack in<br/>
1999 from the British government because Blair wants to have more control.<br/>

Can&#39;t find anything more recent than 2000, so I take it they&#39;ve survived as<br/>
there&#39;s no reference on the Summerhill website.  Here&#39;s more info on open<br/>
learning...  Free Schools<br/>

On the open classroom model referred to in the link you sent, Sandra, I was<br/>
in such a physical space - new school built in 1970 when I was in<br/>
Kindegarten, which I attended I the old school, then moved to the newly<br/>
opened school in 1st grade in 1971, but although we had open classrooms, we<br/>
learned in traditional ways, as the article pointed out - just because it<br/>
was physically open, it was not educationally open. :)  I enjoyed being able<br/>
to overhear what was happening in the other parts of our &#39;quad&#39; but we<br/>
weren&#39;t often released from our group of 30. :)  Seems the architects and<br/>
the teachers may have been on different wavelengths. :)<br/>
<br/>
The school in my hometown still looks the same and has the open layout, but<br/>
I&#39;m sure it is still teaching the same as it did when I tutored there in the<br/>
80s as well. :)<br/>

-=-  <br/>
In both Britain and the United States, open classrooms contained no  <br/>
whole-class lessons, no standardized tests, and no detailed curriculum. The<br/>
best of <br/>
the open classrooms had planned settings where children came in  contact<br/>
with <br/>
things, books, and one another at &quot;interest centers&quot; and learned  at their<br/>
own <br/>
pace with the help of the teacher. Teachers structured the  classroom and <br/>
activities for individual students and small work groups. They  helped<br/>
students <br/>
negotiate each of the reading, math, science, art, and other  interest<br/>
centers <br/>
on the principle that children learn best when they are  interested and see <br/>
the importance of what they are doing.-=- <br/>

I was in an open classroom in 4th and 5th grades.  There were 4th, 5th  and <br/>
6th graders in it.  I learned a lot of stuff.  Mostly none of what  they wanted <br/>
us to learn.  I learned about blow jobs, and harassment of  smaller kids by <br/>
bigger kids.  I learned not to put a paper clip in the  light socket.  I was a <br/>
reader, so I read a lot, but mostly we just played  at the interest centers (I <br/>
don&#39;t think they called it that) and hardly ever did  we play what it was in <br/>
the center.  It was mostly social.<br/>
 <br/>
Occasionally they would set us up on chairs and try to teach us  something.  <br/>
Usually math.  But we got to paint the windows, which I  loved.  In the late <br/>
&#39;60s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046140270">That was much like the teacher Richie had in Montessori. Then in March, they<br/>
let her go. The new teacher took out all the old teacher did, saying it<br/>
&#39;wasn&#39;t Montessori&#39; and acted like it was September and that the other<br/>
teacher had never existed.<br/>
<br/>
After trying to give her benefit of the doubt for a few weeks, Richie asked<br/>
me why couldn&#39;t he stay home and I teach him. :)<br/>
<br/>
Ah, duh!  So, that&#39;s how I decided to homeschool, later to become unschool.<br/>
Because my 4 year old asked. :)<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think about Sudbury in general?  Do you consider that<br/>
unschooling or just a good alternative?  In your experiences, do you see a<br/>
Sudbury model as superior, equal or worse than unschooling at home or &#39;it<br/>
depends on the child&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I ask because I have a single child and we do a lot of park days, but he<br/>
would like more interaction with others, just not in a &#39;schooly&#39; way and<br/>
some of us here in Phx are talking about starting a Sudbury like school.<br/>
<br/>
Love to have your feedback!<br/>
<br/>
ALWAYS LEARNING! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   I am one of those who came to the unschooling/ life learning <br/>
place that I am in now by Summerhill & Sudbury research, they were <br/>
my first exposure to the ideas as I had never heard of &quot;attachment <br/>
parenting&quot; (although I did a lot of it without realizing there were <br/>
others who were doing the same or that was what it was called.) When <br/>
I first really started researching alternitives to my son going to <br/>
kindy I heard about the schools and I actually intended on opening <br/>
one of my own (I was still trying to make use of my college degrees, <br/>
LOL) and probably would have except that I couldn&#39;t talk anyone else <br/>
into the idea of sending their kids to my house everyday rather than <br/>
school! Now that it has been just my ds & I home learning together <br/>
most of the time & having a lot of freedom, I&#39;m not sure if I would <br/>
want other kids around as much. Yes I would like for him to have <br/>
more friends & playtime with friends but he does have a playdate on <br/>
occasion and frankly he seems pretty happy the way he is. He has <br/>
actually said on more than one occasion that he enjoys playing <br/>
alone, so I probably need to get over the socialization thing but I <br/>
also see that some things he learns better from others than from me, <br/>
and I&#39;m still a little worried that he will miss out on something. <br/>
(although I really don&#39;t like the way kids act most of the time in <br/>
school anyhow ie. teasing and such, I don&#39;t want him to learn <br/>
that!)  But for now he seems happy & learning more all the time so I <br/>
will just have to have hope that everything will be fine. But it&#39;s <br/>
not like I&#39;m closing doors to opportunities either as we are also <br/>
suppossed to have a playdate this week with another unschooling <br/>
family that has a boy that&#39;s about 2 years older than my ds, so I&#39;m <br/>
looking forward to that as well. Hopefully it will be nice but I <br/>
also know that there are a LOT of variations in unschooling as well <br/>
and just because we have some simalarities doesn&#39;t mean we will get <br/>
along well. Anyhow, I&#39;m getting long now, I just wanted to share my <br/>
experience that not everyone comes by unschooling or life learning <br/>
through attachment parenting, some of us go a longer way around. <br/>
