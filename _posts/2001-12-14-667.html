<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509736601">I know personally two women in arranged marriages who have been married a <br/>
long, long time.  Over 20 years.  One is Hindu, and in her 30&#39;s.   The other <br/>
is in her 40&#39;s and is, in the vernacular, a Moonie.  Officially:  The <br/>
Unification Church.   <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a fair amount online, and none of this discussion changes how <br/>
unschooling works--it&#39;s totally outside of how people learn, in my <br/>
opinion--but I think this answers the question of why someone would say she&#39;d <br/>
expect earlier marriages from Christian homeschoolers.<br/>

 -=-In the last several years, the term &quot;courtship&quot; has become more and more <br/>
popular among Christian circles to describe various methods of engaging in a <br/>
serious romantic relationship. For some Christians, courtship means an <br/>
approach to marriage that is almost the same thing as an arranged marriage. <br/>
Your parents pick your future mate and there is hardly any one-on-one contact <br/>
before marriage. For others, it means the same thing as a serious dating <br/>
relationship. You decide to court someone when you are thinking about perhaps <br/>
marrying that person.-=-<br/>

Part of a longer interesting article (citation afterward):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A father’s continuing interest in his daughter <br/>
<br/>
Having fulfilled all the foregoing and seeing his daughter married, a <br/>
father&#39;s responsibility to her is not ended. &quot;For this reason a man will <br/>
leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become <br/>
one flesh&quot; (Gen. 2:24). <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t say the wife will leave her family, perhaps because the transfer <br/>
of authority from father to husband makes that clear. Perhaps though the <br/>
father still has some responsibility for his daughter. Deuteronomy 22:13-19 <br/>
shows a father intervening to protect his daughter when she is slandered by <br/>
her husband. Combined with Matthew 18:15-17 God shows clearly how parents <br/>
might become involved in a daughters defense. Clearly, great sensitivity and <br/>
caution would be necessary in these situations. <br/>
<br/>
Laban said to Jacob as they parted, &quot;May the LORD keep watch between you and <br/>
me when we are away from each other. If you mistreat my daughter or if you <br/>
take any wives beside my daughter, even though no one is with us, remember <br/>
that God is a witness between you and me&quot; (Gen. 31:49-50). <br/>
<br/>
A father and a son-in-law have much in common. They are both heads of <br/>
households with responsibilities of self-sacrifice to those in their care. <br/>
They both operate as intermediaries in God&#39;s chain of authority and <br/>
protection. The daughter has passed from the loving authority of one to that <br/>
of another. They are united in their love, affection, and willingness to <br/>
sacrifice for her. The bond that develops as a result of their shared <br/>
interest and position will mature through the time of discipleship and become <br/>
strong in shared friendship, love, and purpose. The marriage of a daughter is <br/>
indeed not the loss of a daughter but a gain—the gain not of a son but of a <br/>
brother in Christ.<br/>
