<div id="ygrps-yiv-758698256">I don&#39;t like the truck as much as I&#39;d like to like it, and I&#39;ll probably <br/>
change that at some point.<br/>
<br/>
But the other art on that page is stuff I did myself yesterday from REAL <br/>
blocks and REAL puzzle pieces, so I&#39;m kinda jazzed now about the potential <br/>
for scanning and html in combination!<br/>
<br/>
The new article is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/truck">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>
<br/>
and one I&#39;ve added a new background to (VERY exciting for me, as it&#39;s a scan <br/>
of the cloth of the actual shirt about which the article is written) is at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/HippieShirt">http://sandradodd.com/HippieShirt</a><br/>
<br/>
I like the articles too, but the scanner stuff!!!!  I&#39;m so happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482766381">I like this Sandra, I like the truck.  <br/>
My husband leans on his truck and talks to our neighbor Harry.  Harry&#39;s a<br/>
chaplain at the Montana State Prison and needs a normal guy to talk with<br/>
sometimes, about normal guy stuff.  They talk about why &#39;64 chevy&#39;s are<br/>
great fishing trucks and why John Deere makes great tractors and how<br/>
Harry can mow the lawn in fifteen minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Three years ago when we moved into this house I told my friend from<br/>
Oregon I now had lots of cupboard space and closet space and a place to<br/>
put everything away.  She only comes once a year or so, and she doesn&#39;t<br/>
have kids but she said - you&#39;re not clearing all the cool stuff off your<br/>
table are you?   I told her I might even have room enough for two tables.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I was little my mom kept a tin of buttons on our table.  She had<br/>
lots of kids and so I&#39;m sure she needed the buttons handy, but so many<br/>
times I remember ladies at our table talking with my mom and sorting<br/>
around in the buttons.  <br/>
<br/>
I just loved your essay.  It swirled up a lot of memories for me.<br/>

&gt; Deb L<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My ds Jack (5) has long hair.  <br/>
It was something I agreed too because I thought as soon as he started <br/>
getting called a girl he would quickly have cut.  <br/>
WRONG!  <br/>
He just assertively  states his boyness.  <br/>
No problem.<br/>
It took me a long time to get comfortable with it.  I feel other <br/>
peoples confusion or discomfort when they mistake him.  <br/>
I offered him a hair cut on a weekly basis for quite while.  I&#39;m just <br/>
now getting to the point that I am really comfortable with it, and <br/>
actually like it!<br/>
I had a friend of mine&#39;s husband tease about taking him to get a hair <br/>
cut the other day.  I just jokingly replied &quot;goodluck!&quot;.   He went on <br/>
to question me about just who was it that wanted his hair long and <br/>
when I said it was completely him, with maybe a little help from his <br/>
dad who also has long hair, he was totally baffled.  He actually <br/>
said, &quot;he&#39;s 5!  No kid at 5 years old should have any say about <br/>
anything in their life.  The parents should decide what they wear, <br/>
what they eat, and definitely how they wear their hair.&quot;  All I could <br/>
say was &quot;I wholeheartedly disagree.&quot;<br/>
He got even more baffled and asked if when he is 14 would i let him <br/>
smoke because  &quot;that&#39;s what he wants to do&quot;? (said in a mocking tone)<br/>
At that point I realized I was arguing with a moron and pretty much <br/>
just said &quot;you&#39;re<br/>
talking health issues against basic appearance choices&quot;<br/>
It went a little further and I just basically laughed at his <br/>
assertions and made counter points that he had no reply to.  I now am <br/>
TOTALLY for my son and his individualness.  I realized the people I <br/>
was worried about offending(or whatever it was I was hungup about)<br/>
were people like him!<br/>
If he ever does decide to go short again Iwill so much miss the kid <br/>
who is so cool as to go against the norm.  I will look at pictures <br/>
and long for the time that I was such a cool mom as to &quot;let&quot; him be <br/>
who he wants to be.  It is really a statement of freedom to me.  <br/>
Freedom for children.  <br/>
Anyway....this is just another one of my break free from the masses <br/>
moment.<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m such a normal, go with the flow type person, then I <br/>
look at my choices I make(which all seem completely reasonable to me) <br/>
and realize I&#39;m a total freak to almost everyone I know.<br/>
Thankyou all for being here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331749856">Deb, I&#39;ve saved your response in &quot;new mail&quot; for days now.  The button box on <br/>
the table sounds just like &quot;it&quot; (whatever &quot;it&quot; is &lt;g&gt;).   <br/>
<br/>
My granny had a button box, in a fruit-cake tin.  The kind with Texas <br/>
pictures on it--a star, a cowboy, the Alamo.  I still see those tins <br/>
sometimes.  Even when I was older and went to her house I would ask to play <br/>
with those.  Partly she didn&#39;t have much to do.  Partly it was fun to see <br/>
which ones I remembered, and to look at them with more experience.  At first, <br/>
when I was little, I could only tell the big ones from the little ones, and <br/>
sort by color or number of holes.  And there used to be the BIG coat buttons <br/>
from the 1930s and 40&#39;s.  As I got older, they got older and more &quot;antique.&quot;  <br/>
And as I got older I could tell that some of those buttons were older than my <br/>
grandmother.  Nothing special in there, just the collection of her life, and <br/>
she hardly ever sewed anything but quilts, and she crocheted.  Most of the <br/>
dresses and aprons she made just tied.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had ever thought to put the out and talk about them, but they were <br/>
private with me, and she would have told me to get them off the table, <br/>
probably, anyway. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They talked over quilting, she and the older female relatives.  My papaw <br/>
didn&#39;t have a truck.  But the men talked walking slowly down to fish, and <br/>
while fishing, and while walking slowly back.<br/>
<br/>
But I wanted to ask, Deb, whether you&#39;d be willing to let me use what you <br/>
wrote.  I&#39;ve been thinking of having comments pages for some of my SCA <br/>
writings, and what you wrote made me think it might be a fun idea for the <br/>
homeschooling essays too, so that people could choose to read comments on <br/>
those or not.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what you wrote in case it&#39;s not handy for you.  I would put it on a <br/>
separate page with a link to that only from that one essay, if it&#39;s okay with <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I like this Sandra, I like the truck.  <br/>

purpose. <br/>
<br/>
I went hunting for my mom&#39;s button box.  She still had it, on top of a<br/>
high dresser,  in the same old tin I remember and we pulled it out, and<br/>
with my old auntie there, Dylan and mom and I sat and looked at buttons. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t know how many things came up and how many memories stirred out<br/>
of my 85 year old auntie and how really wonderful it was to sit with all<br/>
those buttons.  <br/>
<br/>
People do nice things for me all the time, but when you dredged up that<br/>
particular memory you really gave something back I&#39;d forgotten I had.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandra.<br/>

My mother never did figure out who was sending them.  Unlike anyone else I <br/>
know, she actually loves fruitcake and ate the whole thing, every year.  : P<br/>
