<div id="ygrps-yiv-599195997">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Check out www.half.com.  They have a copy of this for $9.22 and another<br/>
for $10.10.  Shipping adds a few bucks, but most of the vendors here<br/>
send by media mail and it&#39;s usually only between $2 and $4.  I&#39;ve bought<br/>
from folks on this site around a dozen times and have never had any<br/>
problem.  <br/>

PROBLEM:<br/>
<br/>
Very expensive.<br/>
<br/>
$15 and $20 used with loose pages, $30 and $45 used in paperback without<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
loose pages (but how long before that 1970 glue dries up? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Amazon had what I HOPE is a typo--they&#39;re taking orders for a new<br/>
edition, <br/>
<br/>
$15 or so (I forget numbers; sorry), and they say December 2012 but I&#39;m <br/>
<br/>
hoping they really meant December 2002.<br/>
<br/>
If so, I can wait two months! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
